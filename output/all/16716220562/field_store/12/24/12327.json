Maybe they thought they knew what he'd found and where it was ... and then found out that they didn't, after all. Maybe Dad hid it....\"  Johnny Coombs shook his head. \"No way a man can hide an ore strike.\"  \"But suppose Dad did, somehow, and whoever killed him couldn't find it? It would be too late to make him tell them. They'd _have_ to come back and look again, wouldn't they? And from the way they went about it, it looks as though they weren't having much luck.\"  \"Then whatever Dad found would still be here, somewhere,\" Greg said.  \"That's right.\"  \"But where? There's nothing on this ship.\"  \"Maybe not,\" Tom said, \"but I'd like to take a look at that asteroid before we give up.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They paused in the big ore-loading lock to reclamp their pressure suit helmets, and looked down at the jagged chunk of rock a hundred yards below them. In the lock they had found scooters ... the little one-man propulsion units so commonly used for short distance work in space ... but decided not to use them. \"They're clumsy,\" Johnny said, \"and the bumper units in your suits will do just as well for this distance.\" He looked down at the rock. \"I'll take the center section. You each take an edge and work in. Look for any signs of work on the surface ... chisel marks, Murexide charges, anything.\"  \"What about the dark side?\" Greg asked.  \"If we want to see anything there, we'll either have to rig up lights or turn the rock around,\" Johnny said. \"Let's cover this side first and see what we come up with.\"  He turned and leaped from the airlock, moving gracefully down toward the surface, using the bumper unit to guide himself with short bursts of compressed CO_{2}, from the nozzle. Greg followed, pushing off harder and passing Johnny halfway down. Tom hesitated. It looked easy enough ... but he remembered the violent nausea of his first few hours of free fall.  Finally he gritted his teeth and jumped off after Greg. Instantly he knew that he had jumped too hard. He shot away from the orbit-ship like a bullet; the jagged asteroid surface leaped up at him. Frantically he grabbed for the bumper nozzle and pulled the trigger, trying to break his fall.  He felt the nozzle jerk in his hand, and then, abruptly, he was spinning off at a wild tangent from the asteroid, head over heels. For a moment it seemed that asteroid, orbit-ship and stars were all wheeling crazily around him. Then he realized what had happened. He fired the bumper again, and went spinning twice as fast. The third time he timed the blast, aiming the nozzle carefully, and the spinning almost stopped.  He fought down nausea, trying to get his bearings. He was three hundred yards out from the asteroid, almost twice as far from the orbit-ship. He stared down at the rock as he moved slowly away from it. Before, from the orbit-ship, he had been able to see only the bright side of the huge rock; now he could see the sharp line of darkness across one side.  But there was something else....  He fired the bumper again to steady himself, peering into the blackness beyond the light-line on the rock. He snapped on his helmet lamp, aimed the spotlight beam down to the dark rock surface. Greg and Johnny were landing now on the bright side, with Greg almost out of sight over the \"horizon\" ... but Tom's attention was focussed on something he could see only now as he moved away from the asteroid surface.  His spotlight caught it ... something bright and metallic, completely hidden on the dark side, lying in close to the surface but not quite on the surface. Then suddenly Tom knew what it was ... the braking jets of a Class I Ranger, crouching beyond the reach of sunlight in the shadow of the asteroid....  Swiftly he fired the bumper again, turning back toward the orbit-ship. His hand went to the speaker-switch, but he caught himself in time. Any warning shouted to Greg and Johnny would certainly be picked up by the ship. But he had to give warning somehow.  He tumbled into the airlock, searching for a flare in his web belt. It was a risk ... the Ranger ship might pick up the flash ... but he had to take it. He was unscrewing the fuse cap from the flare when he saw Greg and Johnny leap up from the asteroid surface.  Then he saw what had alarmed them. Slowly, the Ranger was moving out from its hiding place behind the rock. Tom reached out to catch Greg as he came plummeting into the lock. There was a flash from the Ranger's side, and Johnny Coombs' voice boomed in his earphones: \"Get inside! Get the lock closed, fast ... hurry up, can't waste a second.\"  Johnny caught the lip of the lock, dragged himself inside frantically. They were spinning the airlock door closed when they heard the thundering explosion, felt the ship lurch under their feet, and all three of them went crashing to the deck.     5. The Black Raider   For a stunned moment they were helpless as they struggled to pick themselves up. The stable airlock deck was suddenly no longer stable ... it was lurching back and forth like a rowboat on a heavy sea, and they grabbed the shock-bars along the bulkheads to steady themselves. \"What happened?\" Greg yelped. \"I saw a ship....\"  As if in answer there was another crash belowdecks, and the lurching became worse. \"They're firing on us, that's what happened,\" Johnny Coombs growled.  \"Well, they're shaking us loose at the seams,\" Greg said. \"We've got to get this crate out of here.\" He reached for his helmet, began unsnapping his pressure suit.  \"Leave it on,\" Johnny snapped.  \"But we can't move fast enough in these things....\"  \"Leave it on all the same. If they split the hull open, you'll be dead in ten seconds without a suit.\"  Somewhere below they heard the steady _clang-clang-clang_ of the emergency-station's bell ... already one of the compartments somewhere had been breached, and was pouring its air out into the vacuum of space. \"But what can we do?\" Greg said. \"They could tear us apart!\"  \"First, we see what they've already done,\" Johnny said, spinning the wheel on the inner lock. \"If they plan to tear us apart, we're done for, but they may want to try to board us.... We'll wait and see.\"  An orbit-ship under fire was completely vulnerable. One well-placed shell could rip it open like a balloon.  Tom and Greg followed Johnny to where the control cabin was located. In control they found alarm lights flashing in three places on the instrument panel. Another muffled crash roared through the ship, and a new row of lights sprang on along the panel.  \"How are the engines?\" Greg said, staring at the flickering lights.  \"Can't tell. Looks like they're firing at the main jets, but they've ripped open three storage holds, too. They're trying to disable us....\"  \"What about the _Scavenger_?\"  Johnny checked a gauge. \"The airlock compartment is all right, so the scout ships haven't been touched. They couldn't fire on them without splitting the whole ship down the middle.\" Johnny leaned forward, flipped on the viewscreen, and an image came into focus.         *       *       *       *       *  It was a Class I Ranger, and there was no doubt of its origin. Like the one they had seen berthing at the Sun Lake City racks, this ship had a glossy black hull, with the golden triangle-and-J insignia standing out in sharp relief in the dim sunlight.  \"It's our friends, all right,\" Johnny said.  \"But what are they trying to do?\" Tom said.  Even as they watched, a pair of scooters broke from the side of the Ranger and slid down toward the sun side of the asteroid. \"I don't know,\" Johnny said. \"I think they intended to stay hidden, until Tom lost control of his bumper, and got far enough around there to spot them.\" He frowned as the first scooter touched down on the asteroid surface.  \"Can't we fire on them?\" Greg said angrily.  \"Not the way this tub is lurching around. They've got our main gyros, and the auxilliaries aren't powerful enough to steady us. Another blast or two could send us spinning like a top, and we'd have nothing to stabilize us....\"  There was another flash from the Ranger's hull, and the ship jerked under their feet. \"Well, we're a sitting duck here,\" Greg said. \"Maybe those engines will still work.\" He slid into the control seat, flipped the drive switches to fire the side jets in opposite pairs. They fired, steadying the lurching of the ship somewhat, but there was no response from the main engines. \"No good. We couldn't begin to run from them. We're stuck here.\"  \"They could outrun us anyway,\" Tom said, watching the viewscreen. \"And they're moving in closer now.\"  \"They're going to board us,\" Tom said.  Johnny nodded, his eyes suddenly bright. \"I think you're right. And if they do, we may have a chance. But we've got to split up.... Greg, you take the control cabin here, try to keep them out if you can. Tom can cover the main corridor to the storage holds, and I'll take the engine room section. That will sew up the entrances to control, here, and give us a chance to stop them.\"  \"They may have a dozen men,\" Tom said. \"They could just shoot us down.\"  \"I don't think so,\" Johnny said. \"They want _us_, not the ship, or they wouldn't bother to board us. We may not be able to hold them off, but we can try.\"  \"What about making a run for it in the _Scavenger_?\" Greg said.  Johnny chuckled grimly. \"It'd be a mighty short run. That Ranger's got homing shells that could blow the _Scavenger_ to splinters if we tried it. Our best bet is to put up such a brawl that they think twice about taking us.\"  They parted in the corridor outside control, Johnny heading down for the engine room corridors, while Tom ran up toward the main outer-shell corridor, a Markheim stunner in his hand. The entire outer shell of the ship was storage space, each"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23882"],["title","Gold in the Sky (#7)"],["body","separately sealed and connected with the two main corridors that circled the ship. On each side these corridors came together to join the short entry corridors from the scout-ship airlocks.  Tom knew that the only way the ship could be boarded was through those locks; a man stationed at the place where the main corridors joined could block any entry from the locks ... as long as he could hold his position. Tom reached the junction of the corridors, and crouched close to the wall. By peering around the corner, he had a good view of the airlock corridor.  Tom gripped the Markheim tightly, and he dialed it down to a narrow beam. Nobody had ever been killed by a stunner ... but a direct hit with a narrow beam could paralyze a man for three days.  There was movement at the far end of the airlock corridor. A helmeted head peered around the turn in the corridor; then two men in pressure suits moved into view, walking cautiously, weapons in hand. Tom shrank back against the wall, certain they had not seen him. He waited until they were almost to the junction with the main corridor; then he took aim and pressed the trigger stud on his Markheim. There was an ugly ripping sound as the gun jerked in his hand. The two men dropped as though they had been pole-axed.  A shout, a scrape of metal against metal, and a shot ripped back at him from the end of the corridor. Tom jerked back fast, but not quite fast enough. He felt a sledge-hammer blow on his shoulder, felt his arm jerk in a cramping spasm while the corridor echoed the low rumble of sub-sonics. He flexed his arm to work out the spasm ... they were using a wide beam, hardly strong enough to stun a man. His heart pounded. They were being careful, very careful....  Two more men rounded the bend in the corridor. Tom fired, but they hit the deck fast, and the beam missed. The first one jerked to his feet, charged up the corridor toward him, dodging and sliding. Tom followed him in his sights, fired three times as the Markheim heated up in his hand. The beam hit the man's leg, dumping him to the deck, and bounced off to catch the second one.  But now there was another sound, coming from the corridor behind him. Voices, shouts, clanging of boots. He pressed against the wall, listening. The sounds were from below. They must have gotten past Johnny ... probably the men on the scooters. Tom looked around helplessly. If they came up behind him, he was trapped in a crossfire. But if he left his position, more men could come in through the airlock. Even now two more came around the bend, starting up the corridor for him....  Quite suddenly, the lights went out.  The men stopped. Sound stopped. The corridor was pitch black. Tom fired wildly down the corridor, heard shouts and oaths from the men, but he could see nothing. Then, ahead, a flicker of light as a headlamp went on. The men from the airlock were close, moving in on him, and from behind he saw light bouncing off the corridor walls....  He jerked open the hatch to a storage hold, ducked inside, and slammed the hatch behind him. He pressed against the wall, panting.  He waited.  Suddenly an idea flickered in Tom's mind.  It was a chance ... a long chance ... but it was something. If they were going to be captured in spite of anything they could do, even a long chance would be worth trying....  He waited in the darkness, tried to think it through. It was a wild idea, an utterly impossible idea, he had never heard of it being tried before ... but _any_ chance was better than none. He remembered what Johnny had said in the control cabin. The Ranger ship would have homing shells. An attempt to make a run with the _Scavenger_ might be disastrous.  He thought about it, trying to reason it out. The Jupiter Equilateral men obviously wanted them alive. They did not dare to kill Roger Hunter's sons, because Roger Hunter might have told them where the bonanza was. And Jupiter Equilateral would not dare let anyone of them break away. If one of them got back to Mars, the whole U.N. Patrol would be out in the Belt....  The plan became clear in his mind, but he had to let Greg know. He fingered the control of his helmet radio. The boarding party would have a snooper, but if he was quick, they wouldn't have time to nail him. He buzzed an attention code. \"Greg? Can you hear me?\"  Silence. He buzzed again, and waited. What was wrong? Had they already broken through to the control cabin and taken Greg? He buzzed again. \"Greg! Sound off if you can hear me.\"  More silence. Then a click. \"Tom?\"  \"Here. Are you all right?\"  \"So far. You?\"  \"They got past me, but they didn't hit me. How's Johnny?\"  \"I don't know,\" Greg said. \"I think he's been hurt. Tom, you'd better get off, they'll have snoopers....\"  \"All right, listen,\" Tom said. \"How does it look to you?\"  \"Bad. We're outnumbered, they'll be through to here any minute.\"  \"All right, I've got an idea. It's risky, but it might let us pull something out of this mess. I'll need some time, though.\"  \"How much?\"  \"Ten, fifteen minutes.\"  There was an edge to Greg's voice. \"What are you planning?\"  \"I can't tell you, they're listening in. But if it works....\"  \"Look, don't do anything stupid.\"  \"I can't hear you,\" Tom said. \"You try to hold them for fifteen minutes ... and don't worry. Take care of yourself.\"  Tom snapped off the speaker and moved to the hatchway. The corridor was empty, and pitch black. He started down toward the airlock, then stopped short at the sound of voices and the flicker of headlamps up ahead.  He crouched back, but the lights were not moving. Guards at the lock, making certain that nobody tried to board their own ship. Tom grinned to himself. They weren't missing any bets, he thought.  Except one. There was one bet they wouldn't even think of.  He backtracked to the storage hold, crossed through it, and out into the far corridor. He followed the gentle curve of the deck a quarter of the way around the ship. Twice along the way he stumbled in the darkness, but saw no sign of the raiders. At last he reached the far side, and the corridor leading to No. 2 airlock. Again he could see the lamps of the guards around the bend; they were stationed directly inside their own lock.  Inching forward, he peered into blackness. Each step made a muffled clang on the deck plates. He edged his boots along as quietly as possible, reaching along the wall with his hand until he felt the lip of a hatchway.  The lights and voices seemed nearer now. In the dim reflected light he saw the sign on the door of the hatchway:       No. 2 Airlock      BE SURE PRESSURE GAUGE IS AT ZERO BEFORE OPENING HATCH  He checked the gauge, silently spun the wheel. There was a _ping_ as the seals broke. He pulled the hatch open just enough to squeeze into the lock, then closed it behind him. Then he switched on the pumps, waiting impatiently until the red \"all clear\" signal flashed on. Then he opened the outside lock.  Just beyond, he could see the sleek silvery lines of the _Scavenger_.  It was their only chance.  He took a deep breath, and jumped across the gap to the open lock of the _Scavenger_.     6. The Last Run of the Scavenger   To Greg Hunter the siege of the orbit-ship had been a nerve-wracking game of listening and waiting for something to happen.  In the darkness of the control cabin he stretched his fingers, cramped from gripping the heavy Markheim stunner, and checked the corridor outside again. There was no sound in the darkness there, no sign of movement. Somewhere far below he heard metal banging on metal; minutes before he thought he had heard the sharp ripping sound of a stunner blast overhead, but he wasn't sure. Wherever the fighting was going on, it was not here.  He shook his head as his uneasiness mounted. Why hadn't Johnny come back? He'd gone off to try and disable the Ranger ship leaving Greg to guard the control cabin. Why no sign of the marauders in the control cabin corridor? This should have been the first place they would head for, if they planned to take the ship, but there had been nothing but silence and darkness. Johnny had been gone near 15 minutes already. Greg became more uneasy.  He waited. Suddenly, bitterly, he realized the hopelessness of it. Even if Johnny did manage to damage the Ranger ship, what difference would it make? They had been fools to come out here, idiots to ignore Tawney's warning, the three of them. Tawney had told them in so many words that there would be trouble, and they had come out anyway, just begging for it.  Well, now they had what they'd begged for. Greg slammed his fist into his palm angrily. What had they expected? That the big company would step humbly aside for them, with a fortune hanging in the balance? If they had even begun to think it through before they started....  But they hadn't, and now it was too late. They were under attack; Johnny was off on a fool's errand, gone too long for comfort, and Tom ... Greg glanced at his watch. It had been ten minutes since Tom's call. What had he meant by it? A plan, he said. A long chance.  He couldn't shake off the cold feeling in his chest when he thought about Tom. What if something happened to him....  Greg remembered how he had grown to resent his brother. The time when they were very young and Tom had been struck by the sickness, a native Martian virus they called it. He remembered the endless nights of attention given to Tom alone. From then on somehow they weren't friends any more. But now all that seemed to disappear and Greg only wished that Tom would appear down the corridor....  A sound startled him. He tensed, gripping the stunner, peering into the darkness. Had he heard something? Or was it his own foot scraping on the deck plate? He held his breath, listening, and the sound came again, louder.  Someone was moving stealthily up the corridor.  Greg waited, covered by the edge of the hatchway. It might be Johnny returning, or maybe even Tom ... but there was no sign of recognition."]]]
