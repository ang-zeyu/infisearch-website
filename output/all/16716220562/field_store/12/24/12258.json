That's the outskirts of it down below.\"  \"The other trees? That jungle?\"  \"It's more'n a jungle, Sonny. When I landed here, along with the others from the _Arcturan Spark_, the planet looked pretty empty to me, just like it must have to--Watch it, there, Boy! If I didn't twist that branch over in time, you'd be bouncing off my roots right now!\"  \"Th-thanks!\" grunted Kolin, hanging on grimly.  \"Doggone vine!\" commented the windy whisper. \"_He_ ain't one of my crowd. Landed years later in a ship from some star towards the center of the galaxy. You should have seen his looks before the Life got in touch with his mind and set up a mental field to help him change form. He looks twice as good as a vine!\"  \"He's very handy,\" agreed Kolin politely. He groped for a foothold.  \"Well ... matter of fact, I can't get through to him much, even with the Life's mental field helping. Guess he started living with a different way of thinking. It burns me. I thought of being a tree, and then he came along to take advantage of it!\"  Kolin braced himself securely to stretch tiring muscles.  \"Maybe I'd better stay a while,\" he muttered. \"I don't know where I am.\"  \"You're about fifty feet up,\" the sighing voice informed him. \"You ought to let me tell you how the Life helps you change form. You don't _have_ to be a tree.\"  \"No?\"  \"_Uh_-uh! Some of the boys that landed with me wanted to get around and see things. Lots changed to animals or birds. One even stayed a man--on the outside anyway. Most of them have to change as the bodies wear out, which I don't, and some made bad mistakes tryin' to be things they saw on other planets.\"  \"I wouldn't want to do that, Mr. Ashlew.\"  \"There's just one thing. The Life don't like taking chances on word about this place gettin' around. It sorta believes in peace and quiet. You might not get back to your ship in any form that could tell tales.\"  \"Listen!\" Kolin blurted out. \"I wasn't so much enjoying being what I was that getting back matters to me!\"  \"Don't like your home planet, whatever the name was?\"  \"Haurtoz. It's a rotten place. A Planetary State! You have to think and even look the way that's standard thirty hours a day, asleep or awake. You get scared to sleep for fear you might _dream_ treason and they'd find out somehow.\"  \"Whooeee! Heard about them places. Must be tough just to live.\"  Suddenly, Kolin found himself telling the tree about life on Haurtoz, and of the officially announced threats to the Planetary State's planned expansion. He dwelt upon the desperation of having no place to hide in case of trouble with the authorities. A multiple system of such worlds was agonizing to imagine.                     *       *       *       *       *  Somehow, the oddity of talking to a tree wore off. Kolin heard opinions spouting out which he had prudently kept bottled up for years.  The more he talked and stormed and complained, the more relaxed he felt.  \"If there was ever a fellow ready for this planet,\" decided the tree named Ashlew, \"you're it, Sonny! Hang on there while I signal the Life by root!\"  Kolin sensed a lack of direct attention. The rustle about him was natural, caused by an ordinary breeze. He noticed his hands shaking.  \"Don't know what got into me, talking that way to a tree,\" he muttered. \"If Yrtok snapped out of it and heard, I'm as good as re-personalized right now.\"  As he brooded upon the sorry choice of arousing a search by hiding where he was or going back to bluff things out, the tree spoke.  \"Maybe you're all set, Sonny. The Life has been thinkin' of learning about other worlds. If you can think of a safe form to jet off in, you might make yourself a deal. How'd you like to stay here?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Kolin. \"The penalty for desertion--\"  \"Whoosh! Who'd find you? You could be a bird, a tree, even a cloud.\"  Silenced but doubting, Kolin permitted himself to try the dream on for size.  He considered what form might most easily escape the notice of search parties and still be tough enough to live a long time without renewal. Another factor slipped into his musings: mere hope of escape was unsatisfying after the outburst that had defined his fuming hatred for Haurtoz.  _I'd better watch myself!_ he thought. _Don't drop diamonds to grab at stars!_  \"What I wish I could do is not just get away but get even for the way they make us live ... the whole damn set-up. They could just as easy make peace with the Earth colonies. You know why they don't?\"  \"Why?\" wheezed Ashlew.  \"They're scared that without talk of war, and scouting for Earth fleets that never come, people would have time to think about the way they have to live and who's running things in the Planetary State. Then the gravy train would get blown up--and I mean blown up!\"  The tree was silent for a moment. Kolin felt the branches stir meditatively. Then Ashlew offered a suggestion.  \"I could tell the Life your side of it,\" he hissed. \"Once in with us, you can always make thinking connections, no matter how far away. Maybe you could make a deal to kill two birds with one stone, as they used to say on Earth....\"                     *       *       *       *       *  Chief Steward Slichow paced up and down beside the ration crate turned up to serve him as a field desk. He scowled in turn, impartially, at his watch and at the weary stewards of his headquarters detail. The latter stumbled about, stacking and distributing small packets of emergency rations.  The line of crewmen released temporarily from repair work was transient as to individuals but immutable as to length. Slichow muttered something profane about disregard of orders as he glared at the rocky ridges surrounding the landing place.  He was so intent upon planning greetings with which to favor the tardy scouting parties that he failed to notice the loose cloud drifting over the ridge.  It was tenuous, almost a haze. Close examination would have revealed it to be made up of myriads of tiny spores. They resembled those cast forth by one of the bushes Kolin's party had passed. Along the edges, the haze faded raggedly into thin air, but the units evidently formed a cohesive body. They drifted together, approaching the men as if taking intelligent advantage of the breeze.  One of Chief Slichow's staggering flunkies, stealing a few seconds of relaxation on the pretext of dumping an armful of light plastic packing, wandered into the haze.  He froze.  After a few heartbeats, he dropped the trash and stared at ship and men as if he had never seen either. A hail from his master moved him.  \"Coming, Chief!\" he called but, returning at a moderate pace, he murmured, \"My name is Frazer. I'm a second assistant steward. I'll think as Unit One.\"  Throughout the cloud of spores, the mind formerly known as Peter Kolin congratulated itself upon its choice of form.  _Nearer to the original shape of the Life than Ashlew got_, he thought.  He paused to consider the state of the tree named Ashlew, half immortal but rooted to one spot, unable to float on a breeze or through space itself on the pressure of light. Especially, it was unable to insinuate any part of itself into the control center of another form of life, as a second spore was taking charge of the body of Chief Slichow at that very instant.  _There are not enough men_, thought Kolin. _Some of me must drift through the airlock. In space, I can spread through the air system to the command group._  Repairs to the _Peace State_ and the return to Haurtoz passed like weeks to some of the crew but like brief moments in infinity to other units. At last, the ship parted the air above Headquarters City and landed.  The unit known as Captain Theodor Kessel hesitated before descending the ramp. He surveyed the field, the city and the waiting team of inspecting officers.  \"Could hardly be better, could it?\" he chuckled to the companion unit called Security Officer Tarth.  \"Hardly, sir. All ready for the liberation of Haurtoz.\"  \"Reformation of the Planetary State,\" mused the captain, smiling dreamily as he grasped the handrail. \"And then--formation of the Planetary Mind!\"   END     [ Transcriber's Note:     This e-text was produced from Worlds of If January 1962.

The materials can be secured from the planing mill dressed and sandpapered ready to cut the tenons and mortises. The material list can be made up from the dimensions given in the detail drawing. The front legs or posts, as well as the back ones, are made from 1-3/4-in. square stock, the back ones having a slope of 2 in. from the seat to the top. All the slats are made from 7/8-in. material and of such widths as are shown in the detail. The three upright slats in the back are 3/4-in. material. The detail drawing shows the side and back, the front being the same as the back from the seat down. All joints are mortised in the posts, as shown. The joints, however, can be made with dowels if desired. If making dowel joints they must be clamped very tight when glued and put together. The seat can be made from one piece of 7/8-in. material, fitted with notches around the posts. This is then upholstered with leather without using springs. Leather must be selected as to color to suit the kind of wood used in making the chair. The seat can also be made with an open center for a cane bottom by making a square of four pieces of 7/8-in. material about 4 in. wide. These pieces are fitted neatly to the proper size and dowelled firmly together. After the cane is put in the opening the cane is covered over and upholstered with leather in the same manner as with a solid bottom.     HOW TO MAKE A LAMP STAND AND SHADE   A library light stand of pleasing design and easy construction is made as follows: Square up a piece of white oak so that it shall have a width and thickness of 1-3/4 in. with a length of 13 in. Square up two pieces of the same kind of material to the same width and thickness, but with a length of 12 in. each. Square up two pieces to a width and length of 3 in. each with a thickness of 1-1/8 in.  If a planing mill is near, time and patience will be saved by ordering one piece 1-3/4 in. square and 40 in. long, two pieces 1-1/8 in. thick and 3 in. square, all planed and sandpapered on all surfaces. The long piece can then be cut at home to the lengths specified above.  The 13-in. piece is for the upright and should have a 1/2-in. hole bored the full length through the center. If the bit is not long enough to reach entirely through, bore from each end, then use a red-hot iron to finish. This hole is for the electric wire or gas pipe if gas is used.  The two pieces for the base are alike except the groove of one is cut from the top and of the other from the under side, as shown. Shape the under sides first. This can best be done by placing the two pieces in a vise, under sides together, and boring two holes with a 1-in. bit. The center of each hole will be 2-1/2 in. from either end and in the crack between the pieces. The pieces can then be taken out, lines gauged on each side of each, and the wood between the holes removed with turning saw and scraper steel.  [Illustration: The Completed Lamp]  The width of the grooves must be determined by laying one piece upon the other; a try-square should be used to square the lines across the pieces; however, gauge for depth, gauging both pieces from their top surfaces. Chisel out the grooves and round off the corners as shown in the sketch, using a 3/4-in. radius.  These parts may be put together and fastened to the upright by means of two long screws from the under side, placed to either side of the 1/2-in. hole. This hole must be continued through the pieces forming the base.  The braces are easiest made by taking the two pieces which were planed to 1-1/8 in. thick and 3 in. square and drawing a diagonal on each. Find the middle of this diagonal by drawing the central portion of the other diagonal; at this point place the spur of the bit and bore a 1-in. hole in each block.  Saw the two blocks apart, sawing along a diagonal of each. Plane the surfaces on the saw cut smooth and sandpaper the curve made by the bit. Fasten the braces in place by means of roundhead blued screws.  To make a shade such as is shown in the illustration is rather difficult. The shade is made of wood glued up and has art glass fitted in rabbets cut on the inner edges. Such shades can be purchased ready to attach. The sketch shows one method of attaching. Four small pieces of strap iron are bent to the shape shown and fastened to the four sides of the upright. Electric globes--two, three or four may be attached as shown.  [Illustration: Construction of Shade]  The kind of wood finish for the stand will depend upon the finish on the wooden shade, if shade is purchased. Brown Flemish is obtained by first staining the wood with Flemish water stain diluted by the addition of two parts water to one part stain. When this is dry, sandpaper the \"whiskers\" which were raised by the water and fill with a medium dark filler. Directions will be found on the filler cans. When filler has hardened, apply two coats of wax.  [Illustration: Details of Construction of Library Lamp Stand]  The metal shade as shown in the sketch is a \"layout\" for a copper or brass shade of a size suitable for this particular lamp. Such shades are frequently made from one piece of sheet metal and designs are pierced in them as suggested in the \"layout.\" This piercing is done by driving the point of a nail through the metal from the under side before the parts are soldered or riveted together. If the parts are to be riveted, enough additional metal must be left on the last panel to allow for a"]]]
