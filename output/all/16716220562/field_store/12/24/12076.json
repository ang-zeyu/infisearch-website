This is the tomb of Captain Lean,       Would a straiter please his soul?     I trow he sleeps in peace,       Howsoever the billows roll!         THE PORTRAIT OF A WARRIOR       His brow is seamed with line and scar;       His cheek is red and dark as wine;     The fires as of a Northern star       Beneath his cap of sable shine.      His right hand, bared of leathern glove,       Hangs open like an iron gin,     You stoop to see his pulses move,       To hear the blood sweep out and in.      He looks some king, so solitary       In earnest thought he seems to stand,     As if across a lonely sea       He gazed impatient of the land.      Out of the noisy centuries       The foolish and the fearful fade;     Yet burn unquenched these warrior eyes,       Time hath not dimmed nor death dismayed.         HAUNTED       From out the wood I watched them shine,--       The windows of the haunted house,     Now ruddy as enchanted wine,       Now dim as flittermouse.      There went a thin voice piping airs       Along the grey and crooked walks,--     A garden of thistledown and tares,       Bright leaves, and giant stalks.      The twilight rain shone at its gates,       Where long-leaved grass in shadow grew;     And black in silence to her mates       A voiceless raven flew.      Lichen and moss the lone stones greened,       Green paths led lightly to its door,     Keen from her lair the spider leaned,       And dusk to darkness wore.      Amidst the sedge a whisper ran,       The West shut down a heavy eye,     And like last tapers, few and wan,       The watch-stars kindled in the sky.         THE RAVEN'S TOMB       'Build me my tomb,' the Raven said,     'Within the dark yew-tree,     So in the Autumn yewberries     Sad lamps may burn for me.     Summon the haunted beetle,     From twilight bud and bloom,     To drone a gloomy dirge for me     At dusk above my tomb.     Beseech ye too the glowworm     To bear her cloudy flame,     Where the small, flickering bats resort,     Whistling in tears my name.     Let the round dew a whisper make,     Welling on twig and thorn;     And only the grey cock at night     Call through his silver horn.     And you, dear sisters, don your black     For ever and a day,     To show how sweet a raven     In his tomb is laid away.'         THE CHRISTENING       The bells chime clear,     Soon will the sun behind the hills sink down;     Come, little Ann, your baby brother dear     Lies in his christening-gown.      His godparents     Are all across the fields stepped on before,     And wait beneath the crumbling monuments,     This side the old church door.      Your mammie dear     Leans frail and lovely on your daddie's arm;     Watching her chick, 'twixt happiness and fear,     Lest he should come to harm.      All to be blest     Full soon in the clear heavenly water, he     Sleeps on unwitting of't, his little breast     Heaving so tenderly.      I carried you,     My little Ann, long since on this same quest,     And from the painted windows a pale hue     Lit golden on your breast;      And then you woke,     Chill as the holy water trickled down,     And, weeping, cast the window a strange look,     Half smile, half infant frown.      I scarce could hear     The larks a-singing in the green meadows,     'Twas summertide, and budding far and near     The hedges thick with rose.      And now you're grown     A little girl, and this same helpless mite     Is come like such another bud half-blown,     Out of the wintry night.      Time flies, time flies!     And yet, bless me! 'tis little changed am I;     May Jesu keep from tears those infant eyes,     Be love their lullaby!         THE MOTHER BIRD       Through the green twilight of a hedge     I peered, with cheek on the cool leaves pressed,     And spied a bird upon a nest:     Two eyes she had beseeching me     Meekly and brave, and her brown breast     Throbb'd hot and quick above her heart;     And then she oped her dagger bill,--     'Twas not a chirp, as sparrows pipe     At break of day; 'twas not a trill,     As falters through the quiet even;     But one sharp solitary note,     One desperate, fierce, and vivid cry     Of valiant tears, and hopeless joy,     One passionate note of victory:     Off, like a fool afraid, I sneaked,     Smiling the smile the fool smiles best,     At the mother bird in the secret hedge     Patient upon her lonely nest.         THE CHILD IN THE STORY GOES TO BED       I prythee, Nurse, come smooth my hair,       And prythee, Nurse, unloose my shoe,     And trimly turn my silken sheet       Upon my quilt of gentle blue.      My pillow sweet of lavender       Smooth with an amiable hand,     And may the dark pass peacefully by       As in the hour-glass droops the sand.      Prepare my cornered manchet sweet,       And in my little crystal cup     Pour out the blithe and flowering mead       That forthwith I may sup.      Withdraw my curtains from the night,       And let the crispèd crescent shine     Upon my eyelids while I sleep,       And soothe me with her beams benign.      From far-away there streams the singing       Of the mellifluent nightingale,--     Surely if goblins hear her lay,       They shall not o'er my peace prevail.      Now quench my silver lamp, prythee,       And bid the harpers harp that tune     Fairies which haunt the meadowlands       Sing clearly to the stars of June.      And bid them play, though I in dreams       No longer heed their pining strains,     For I would not to silence wake       When slumber o'er my senses wanes.      You Angels bright who me defend,       Enshadow me with curvèd wing,     And keep me in the darksome night       Till dawn another day do bring.         THE CHILD IN THE STORY AWAKES       The light of dawn rose on my dreams,       And from afar I seemed to hear     In sleep the mellow blackbird call       Hollow and sweet and clear.      I prythee, Nurse, my casement open,       Wildly the garden peals with singing,     And hooting through the dewy pines       The goblins all are winging.      O listen the droning of the bees,       That in the roses take delight!     And see a cloud stays in the blue       Like an angel still and bright.      The gentle sky is spread like silk,       And, Nurse, the moon doth languish there,     As if it were a perfect jewel       In the morning's soft-spun hair.      The greyness of the distant hills       Is silvered in the lucid East,     See, now the sheeny-plumèd cock       Wags haughtily his crest.      'O come you out, O come you out,       Lily, and lavender, and lime;     The kingcup swings his golden bell,       And plumpy cherries drum the time.      'O come you out, O come you out!       Roses, and dew, and mignonette,     The sun is in the steep blue sky,       Sweetly the morning star is set.'         THE LAMPLIGHTER       When the light of day declineth,     And a swift angel through the sky     Kindleth God's tapers clear,     With ashen staff the lamplighter     Passeth along the darkling streets     To light our earthly lamps;      Lest, prowling in the darkness,     The thief should haunt with quiet tread,     Or men on evil errands set;     Or wayfarers be benighted;     Or neighbours bent from house to house     Should need a guiding torch.      He is like a needlewoman     Who deftly on a sable hem     Stitches in gleaming jewels;     Or, haply, he is like a hero,     Whose bright deeds on the long journey     Are beacons on our way.      And when in the East cometh morning,     And the broad splendour of the sun,     Then, with the tune of little birds     Ringing on high, the lamplighter     Passeth by each quiet house,     And putteth out the lamps.         CECIL       Ye little elves, who haunt sweet dells,     Where flowers with the dew commune,     I pray you hush the child, Cecil,         With windlike song.      O little elves, so white she lieth,     Each eyelid gentler than the flow'r     Of the bramble, and her fleecy hair         Like smoke of gold.      O little elves, her hands and feet     The angels muse upon, and God     Hath shut a glimpse of Paradise         In each blue eye.      O little elves, her tiny body     Like a white flake of snow it is,     Drooping upon the pale green hood         Of the chill snowdrop.      O little elves, with elderflower,     And pimpernel, and the white hawthorn,     Sprinkle the journey of her dreams:         And, little elves,      Call to her magically sweet,     Lest of her very tenderness     She do forsake this rough brown earth         And return to us no more.         I MET AT EVE       I met at eve the Prince of Sleep,     His was a still and lovely face,     He wandered through a valley steep       Lovely in a lonely place.      His garb was grey of lavender,     About his brows a poppy-wreath     Burned like dim coals, and everywhere       The air was sweeter for his breath.      His twilight feet no sandals wore,     His eyes shone faint in their own flame,     Fair moths that gloomed his steps before       Seemed letters of his lovely name.      His house is in the mountain ways,     A phantom house of misty walls,     Whose golden flocks at evening graze,       And witch the moon with muffled calls.      Upwelling from his shadowy springs     Sweet waters shake a trembling sound,     There flit the hoot-owl's silent wings,       There hath his web the silkworm wound.      Dark in his pools clear visions lurk,     And rosy, as with morning buds,     Along his dales of broom and birk       Dreams haunt his solitary woods.      I met at eve the Prince of Sleep,     His was a still and lovely face,     He wandered through a valley steep,       Lovely in a lonely place.

Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!

I heard three bells in unison     Clap out some transient heart's delight,     Time and the hour brought silence on       And the dark night.      Doth not Orion even set!
