In Mexico, there are two or three native dogs: found there on the arrival of Europeans.  One is the _Alco_--a dog remarkable for a curious hunch or protuberance upon the back and shoulders, a thick short neck, and small pointed muzzle.  He is thinly covered with long hair, of a yellowish colour.  Another singular variety is the dog of Chihuahua and this is, perhaps, the smallest of all canine creatures.  Full-grown specimens have been seen, whose dimensions did not exceed those of the common rat; and a singular fact, well authenticated, is, that this dog, when transported from Chihuahua to any other place--even to the city of Mexico itself-- invariably becomes larger, or degenerates, as the Mexicans have it! There is also in Mexico a hairless dog.  It is, no doubt, the same as that known by the name of Turkish dog; since this variety came originally from Spanish America.  In South America, there are several species of native dogs, found among the savages of the Orinoco and Amazon.  They are small animals, usually of a whitish colour: but their owners follow the curious practice of dyeing them with annatto, indigo, and other brilliant dyes, for the purpose of rendering them more ornamental!  We can only find space to say that there are many other varieties of domesticated dogs, almost unknown beyond the countries in which they are found.  Such are the _Quao_ of Rhamgur, the Sumatran dog, the _Poull_ of New Ireland, the dogs of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego--those of the South Sea Islands; and the _Waht_ that inhabits some of the ranges of the Himalayas.  It is reasonable to suppose that there is not a nation upon earth, hardly a tribe--civilised or savage--that does not possess some variety of the canine race differing from all the others.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  WILD DOGS.  By _Wild Dogs_, we mean not only several sorts of true dogs, that in different parts of the world are found living in a wild state; but also Wolves, Foxes, Jackals, Hyenas, and Fennecs--for all these are but dogs in a state of nature.  First, we shall speak of the true dogs living in a wild state--that is, apart from the society of man.  It is not necessary here to go into the often-debated question, as to whether dogs were originally wolves, or what species of wolf the dog is descended from.  This is all mere speculation, and answers no purpose. It is just as likely that wolves sprang from dogs, as that dogs came from wolves; and every one may perceive that two breeds of the dog species are often far more unlike each other--both in appearance and habits--than a dog is to a wolf itself.  Again, foxes differ only from wolves in point of size; and a small wolf is in reality a fox, while a large fox may be equally regarded as a wolf.  Furthermore, the jackal is nothing else than another form of the same animal--the wolf or dog, whichever you choose to term it; and the hyenas but a still _uglier_ shape of the same carnivorous creature.  With regard to the true wild dogs--which are not regarded as wolves--we find them existing in various parts of the world.  They usually live in communities, and have the habit of hounds--that is, they hunt in packs. Whether they were originally dogs in a domesticated state, and have since seceded from the society of man, is a question which naturalists are unable to agree upon.  In India there are two or three kinds of wild dogs living thus.  One in the Deccan--called Kolsun by the Mahratta people--is a reddish-coloured animal, nearly as large as the common European wolf.  It dwells in the forests, far remote from the villages--and of course lives by preying upon other animals--just as wolves and foxes do.  Again, in the forests of the Himalaya mountains there is another species of wild dog, different from that of the Deccan.  It is usually known as the wild dog of Nepaul, from its being found in many parts of that kingdom.  A large community of these animals is often met with in the mountain forests-- living in caves, or at the bottoms of cliffs, where there are deep crevices among the boulders of loose rocks, that afford them a secure asylum when pursued by their enemies.  In these places the dogs sleep, and bring forth their young; and the puppies are taught to be exceedingly wary, and not stray far from their dens during the absence of the mothers.  Indeed, so cunning do they become when only a few days old, that it is difficult to capture one of them outside its impenetrable lodging-place.  During many hours the old ones are abroad, in pursuit of the animals upon whose flesh they subsist; and, as already stated, these dogs follow their game not singly, but in bands or packs.  In this way, instinct teaches them that they will have a better chance of success; since they are more able to head the pursued animal, turn it in different directions, and at length run it to the ground.  A curious fact is related of the cunning of these wild dogs.  It is stated that when in pursuit of the larger animals--such as stags and large antelopes that inhabit the same district--instead of running them down at once, the dogs manoeuvre so as to guide the game to their breeding place, before giving the final _coup_ to the chase!  The object of this is to bring the carcass within reach of their young; which, were it killed at a great distance off, would be obviously impossible.  Such a habit as this would prove them possessed of something more than instinct; but for all that, it may be true.  A fact seems to confirm it: the fact that a large quantity of bones is always observed in the immediate neighbourhood of the breeding places--some of these being of such a size as to preclude the belief that they could have been carried thither by the dogs themselves.  In Ramghur there is a wild dog called Quao, or Quaw, which lives in communities, just as those of Nepaul; and still another kind inhabits the forests of the Island of Sumatra.  None of these kinds are to be confounded with the half-wild dogs of India, called pariah dogs; since the latter, although not owned by individuals, dwell in the villages, and of course associate with man. Besides, the pariahs are of no particular breed--there being several sorts of pariah dogs.  They are merely _outcast curs_, without owners, that pick up a living as they best can.  Passing from India to the tropical countries of America, we find another sort of wild dog in the forests of Guiana, known as the Koupara, or Crab-dog.  It is not certain whether these dogs are indigenous to Guiana, or the progeny of some domestic variety introduced by the colonists.  They dwell in small troops or families, of six or seven individuals each, and their food is furnished by the _pacas, agoutis_, and other small rodent animals of tropical America.  They also find sustenance in several kinds of crabs, which they adroitly capture upon the banks of the rivers; and it is from their habit of feeding upon these they have derived the name of crab-dogs.  They are easily tamed; and when crossed with other breeds, a variety is produced which is esteemed by the natives as the very best kind for the hunting of the agoutis, cavies, and capibaras.  The wild dogs of the Cape country, called _Wilde Hunden_ (wild hounds) by the Dutch, are usually regarded as near akin to the _hyenas_.  But they are more like real wild hounds than hyenas; and their colour--which is a mixture of black, white, and tan--almost points to them as the progenitors of that variety of dog known as the hound.  Their habits, too, would seem to confirm this hypothesis: for it is well-known that these animals pursue their prey just after the manner of a pack of real hounds--doubling upon it, and using every artifice to run it down.  The numerous species of ruminant animals--the antelope in particular--are the especial objects of their pursuit, and upon these they subsist. Like the Indian wild dogs, they live in communities--using the burrows of the wild hog and ant-eater, as also the hollow ant-hills, for their lairs and breeding places.  Travellers passing across the plains of South Africa have often witnessed the splendid spectacle of a pack of these beautiful wild hounds in pursuit of a large antelope, and almost fancied themselves looking at a stag hunt, with a kennel of real hounds going at full view!  The true wild dog of all is that creature so well-known and celebrated in all our tales of childhood--the _Wolf_.  To describe the wolf, or even to give an account of his habits, would be superfluous.  Almost every one is acquainted with the gaunt form, the shaggy hide, and tierce aspect of this formidable creature; and every one has heard of his fierce and savage disposition: for who is ignorant of the story of \"Little Red Riding Hood?\"  The presence of this much-disliked animal is almost universal: by which I mean, that in some form or other he is represented in almost every corner of the globe.  You may say there are no wolves in Africa; but this is not true: for the hyenas are nothing more nor less than wolves, and wolves of the very ugliest kind.  Fortunately wolves are no longer found in Britain, though they were once plentiful enough in these islands; but all over the continent of Europe there are still numerous wolves in the forests and mountains.  The Common Wolf, that is, the wolf of Europe, is the type of the family; but this type offers many varieties--according to the different localities in which it is found.  I shall here notice these varieties.  French wolves are generally browner and smaller than those of Germany; and the wolves of Russia, Sweden, and Norway are still stronger animals, and of a more sinister appearance.  These differ very much in colour, which in winter is almost white.  Again, the Alpine wolves are smaller than the French, and of a brownish-grey colour; while those of Italy and Turkey have a yellowish tinge.  Black "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23576"],["title","Quadrupeds, What They Are and Where Found: A Book of Zoology for Boys (#7)"],["body","are not uncommon, especially in the Pyrenees of Spain; but whether these, as well as the others, are all mere varieties of the common wolf, or whether there are two or three distinct species of European wolf, are questions to be left to the disputation of systematic naturalists.  Over all the continent of America, from the Arctic shores in the north to Tierra del Fuego in the south, wolves are found; and here again there are varieties in size, colour, and even habits, that may fairly entitle the different kinds to rank as separate species.  Most certainly there are distinct species, for that known as the Prairie Wolf, and also the Coyote of Mexico, are two kinds that more resemble jackals than real wolves.  Besides, other wolves of the American continent, as the Brown Wolf of Mexico, the great Dusky Wolf of the Upper Missouri, the Aguara Dog of South America, the Wild Dog of the Falkland Islands, the Fox Wolves of Patagonia and Terra del Fuego, the Guazu of Paraguay and Chili, and the North American Common Wolf--are all animals of such different appearance and habits, that it is absurd to term them varieties of the same species.  In Asia we have just the same series of varieties--that is, in every part of the great continent is found some representative of the tribe, which in reality is no variety, but an original and indigenous animal of the wolf kind--such as the Sandgah, or Indian wolf of the Himalayas; the Beriah, another Indian wolf; and the Derboom, a black species that inhabits the mountains of Arabia and Syria.  In Africa the wolf is represented by the hyenas, of which there are at least four species--one of them, the common hyena, belonging to the northern half of the African continent, and extending its range into several countries of Asia.  At the Cape, and northward into Central Africa, three large species of hyena, and one small one (the Aard wolf), represent the lupine family.  The Jackal, too--of which there are several distinct kinds in Asia and Africa--is only a wolf of diminutive size and gregarious habit.  This creature is fairly represented in America by the Coyote of Mexico, and the Barking Wolf of the prairies; and in Asia, upon the steppes of Tartary, by the Corsac.  Even in Australia, where new mammalia have turned up in such odd and fantastic forms, the wolf has his congener in that curious creature known as the Tasmanian wolf.  With regard to foxes, they, like the wolves, are distributed almost universally over the globe; and exhibit a like variety of forms and colours, according to the different localities which they inhabit. Their name is legion.  As the smallest representatives of the wild dogs, we find in Africa the curious little creatures known as the Fennecs.  Of these there are also varieties; for, although very much alike in habits, the Fennecs of Abyssinia and those of the Cape are evidently distinct species.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  CATS.  The Lion is the _king of cats_; though there are some who think that the Tiger has a better claim to the _throne_.  In point of size and strength, there is not much difference between these two animals.  The lion _appears_ larger, on account of his shaggy mane; but specimens of the tiger have been taken whose measurement was equal to that of the largest lion.  Otherwise, the tiger is decidedly superior in courage, in address, and in beauty; in fact, the royal tiger is one of the most beautiful of animals; while the lion, notwithstanding the great fame he enjoys, is among the very ugliest of brutes.  These two powerful creatures often meet in the jungles of India, and try their strength in single combat.  It is not decided which is superior in prowess, since victory is sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other.  No doubt this depends on the individuals who may engage, for lions are not all alike, nor tigers neither.  Both differ in strength and courage, just as men do; and this difference is caused by a variety of circumstances--such as age, size, season of the year, nature of the country and climate, and many like contingencies.  Remember that the lion is found both in Asia and Africa, and nowhere else.  He inhabits the whole of Africa, from the Cape to the shores of the Mediterranean, and there are three well-marked varieties on that continent.  In Asia he is only found in its southern part--that is, in the tropical and sub-tropical regions; and there are also two or three varieties of the Asiatic lion.  With regard to the tiger, he is altogether an Asiatic.  There are no tigers in Europe, Africa, and America--of course we mean in their wild state; and the stories of tiger-hunts in Africa and America, frequently to be met with in books and newspapers, are the narratives of mere ignorant travellers, who confound the royal tiger with several species of spotted cats--of which we shall presently speak.  We may add that the tiger, although exclusively Asiatic, is not exclusively tropical in his haunts.  Tigers are more abundant in the hot jungles of India and some of the larger islands of the Indian Ocean than elsewhere; but they have also been observed far to the north of the Himalayan chain on the great _steppes_ that extend almost to the confines of Siberia.  To continue the monarchical analogy; there are four cats that may be called the princes of the family.  These are the _Jaguar_, the _Leopard_, the _Panther_, and the _Hunting-leopard_ or _Cheetah_.  The first of these is exclusively American; the other three, African and Asiatic.  They are all four what are termed spotted cats; that is, having black markings on a buff or yellowish ground.  I need not add that they are all beautiful creatures.  A superficial observer would easily mistake the one for the other; and in common phrase, they are indifferently termed leopards, panthers, and even tigers; but the naturalist, and even the _furrier_ knows that they are four distinct species.  I shall endeavour to point out as briefly as possible some marks that will enable _you_ to distinguish them.  In the spots we find a tolerably good criterion of the species.  Those upon the body of the jaguar are not spots, but rather what may be termed rosettes.  So, too, the black markings of the leopard and panther are rosettes; that is, irregular black rings enclosing an open space of the yellow ground.  On the contrary, the spots upon the hunting-leopard are real spots, of a uniform black; and, consequently, this animal is easily distinguished from the other three.  He differs from them also in shape.  He is longer in the legs, stands more upright upon them, and can run more swiftly than any of the cat tribe.  In fact, he has a tendency towards the nature and habits of the dog, and might be appropriately termed the cat-dog, or the dog-cat, whichever you please.  It is on account of his canine qualities that he is sometimes trained to the chase: hence his specific name of the hunting-leopard.  He inhabits both Asia and Africa.  But how are the jaguar, leopard, and panther to be distinguished from one another?  The jaguar easily enough from the other two.  His rosettes have a black point in the centre, which is wanting in the rings of the panther and leopard.  Besides, the jaguar is a larger and more powerful animal.  Humboldt and others have observed specimens of the jaguar nearly equal in dimensions to those of the royal tiger himself; and his feats of fierce prowess, in the forests of Spanish America, are scarce eclipsed by those of his congener in the jungles of India.  Human beings are frequently his victims, and settlements have been abandoned on account of the dangerous proximity of the jaguars.  His range in America is pretty nearly co-terminal with the Spanish territories--including, of course, Brazil and Guiana, and excluding the country of Patagonia, where a smaller species takes his place.  In all these countries he is misnamed tiger (_tigre_)--hence the anomalous stories to which we have alluded.  We may add that there is a _black_ jaguar in tropical America, just as there is a _black_ panther in Asia.  In neither case is it a different species: only a variety as regards colour.  In all other respects the black and yellow kinds are alike.  Even on the black ones the spots are observable in a certain light, being of a deeper hue than the general ground colour of the skin.  Thus, then, it is easy to distinguish a cheetah from a jaguar, or either from a leopard or panther; but with regard to these last two, the distinction is more difficult.  In fact, so much are they alike, that the two species are confounded even by naturalists; and it is yet an undecided point which is the leopard, and which the panther!  That there are two distinct species is certain.  The London furrier knows that there are two kinds of skins, which he distinguishes mainly by the feel; but the learned zoologist, Temminck, has pointed out a difference in the anatomical structure.  Both animals are natives of Africa, and both were supposed to exist in Asia; but it is doubtful whether that known as the leopard extends beyond the limits of the African continent.  The panther is that one which is a little heavier in the body, more cat-like in shape, and of a deeper yellow in the ground colour; but, perhaps, the truest distinction is found in the tail, which is longer in the panther than in the leopard, and consists of a greater number of vertebrae.  The panther is a well-known animal in India and the Asiatic islands; and, as already stated, there is a dark-skinned variety, commonly known as the Black Panther of Java.  Taking the cat family according to size, the next that deserves mention is the Couguar, or Puma.  This is the panther of the Anglo-Americans, and the lion (_leon_) of the Mexicans and South Americans.  His colour is a uniform tawny red, or calf colour; and he is inferior to the jaguar in size, strength, and courage.  Notwithstanding, he is a formidable animal, and has been known to attack and destroy the "]]]
