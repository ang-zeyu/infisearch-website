But before we start I must ask you a few questions, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis.\"  The other had been silent all this time, but I had observed that his more controlled excitement was even greater than the obtrusive emotion of the clergyman.  He sat with a pale, drawn face, his anxious gaze fixed upon Holmes, and his thin hands clasped convulsively together. His pale lips quivered as he listened to the dreadful experience which had befallen his family, and his dark eyes seemed to reflect something of the horror of the scene.  \"Ask what you like, Mr. Holmes,\" said he eagerly.  \"It is a bad thing to speak of, but I will answer you the truth.\"  \"Tell me about last night.\"  \"Well, Mr. Holmes, I supped there, as the vicar has said, and my elder brother George proposed a game of whist afterwards.  We sat down about nine o'clock.  It was a quarter-past ten when I moved to go.  I left them all round the table, as merry as could be.\"  \"Who let you out?\"  \"Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself out.  I shut the hall door behind me.  The window of the room in which they sat was closed, but the blind was not drawn down.  There was no change in door or window this morning, or any reason to think that any stranger had been to the house.  Yet there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and Brenda lying dead of fright, with her head hanging over the arm of the chair.  I'll never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as I live.\"  \"The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable,\" said Holmes.  \"I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any way account for them?\"  \"It's devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis. \"It is not of this world.  Something has come into that room which has dashed the light of reason from their minds.  What human contrivance could do that?\"  \"I fear,\" said Holmes, \"that if the matter is beyond humanity it is certainly beyond me.  Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations before we fall back upon such a theory as this.  As to yourself, Mr. Tregennis, I take it you were divided in some way from your family, since they lived together and you had rooms apart?\"  \"That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is past and done with. We were a family of tin-miners at Redruth, but we sold our venture to a company, and so retired with enough to keep us.  I won't deny that there was some feeling about the division of the money and it stood between us for a time, but it was all forgiven and forgotten, and we were the best of friends together.\"  \"Looking back at the evening which you spent together, does anything stand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the tragedy?  Think carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue which can help me.\"  \"There is nothing at all, sir.\"  \"Your people were in their usual spirits?\"  \"Never better.\"  \"Were they nervous people?  Did they ever show any apprehension of coming danger?\"  \"Nothing of the kind.\"  \"You have nothing to add then, which could assist me?\"  Mortimer Tregennis considered earnestly for a moment.  \"There is one thing occurs to me,\" said he at last.  \"As we sat at the table my back was to the window, and my brother George, he being my partner at cards, was facing it.  I saw him once look hard over my shoulder, so I turned round and looked also.  The blind was up and the window shut, but I could just make out the bushes on the lawn, and it seemed to me for a moment that I saw something moving among them.  I couldn't even say if it was man or animal, but I just thought there was something there.  When I asked him what he was looking at, he told me that he had the same feeling.  That is all that I can say.\"  \"Did you not investigate?\"  \"No; the matter passed as unimportant.\"  \"You left them, then, without any premonition of evil?\"  \"None at all.\"  \"I am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this morning.\"  \"I am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast. This morning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook me.  He told me that old Mrs. Porter had sent a boy down with an urgent message.  I sprang in beside him and we drove on. When we got there we looked into that dreadful room.  The candles and the fire must have burned out hours before, and they had been sitting there in the dark until dawn had broken.  The doctor said Brenda must have been dead at least six hours.  There were no signs of violence.  She just lay across the arm of the chair with that look on her face.  George and Owen were singing snatches of songs and gibbering like two great apes.  Oh, it was awful to see!  I couldn't stand it, and the doctor was as white as a sheet.  Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and we nearly had him on our hands as well.\"  \"Remarkable--most remarkable!\" said Holmes, rising and taking his hat. \"I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha without further delay.  I confess that I have seldom known a case which at first sight presented a more singular problem.\"   Our proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the investigation.  It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident which left the most sinister impression upon my mind. The approach to the spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding, country lane.  While we made our way along it we heard the rattle of a carriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it pass.  As it drove by us I caught a glimpse through the closed window of a horribly contorted, grinning face glaring out at us.  Those staring eyes and gnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision.  \"My brothers!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis, white to his lips. \"They are taking them to Helston.\"  We looked with horror after the black carriage, lumbering upon its way. Then we turned our steps towards this ill-omened house in which they had met their strange fate.  It was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a cottage, with a considerable garden which was already, in that Cornish air, well filled with spring flowers.  Towards this garden the window of the sitting-room fronted, and from it, according to Mortimer Tregennis, must have come that thing of evil which had by sheer horror in a single instant blasted their minds.  Holmes walked slowly and thoughtfully among the flower-plots and along the path before we entered the porch. So absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he stumbled over the watering-pot, upset its contents, and deluged both our feet and the garden path.  Inside the house we were met by the elderly Cornish housekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the aid of a young girl, looked after the wants of the family.  She readily answered all Holmes's questions.  She had heard nothing in the night.  Her employers had all been in excellent spirits lately, and she had never known them more cheerful and prosperous.  She had fainted with horror upon entering the room in the morning and seeing that dreadful company round the table. She had, when she recovered, thrown open the window to let the morning air in, and had run down to the lane, whence she sent a farm-lad for the doctor.  The lady was on her bed upstairs if we cared to see her. It took four strong men to get the brothers into the asylum carriage. She would not herself stay in the house another day and was starting that very afternoon to rejoin her family at St. Ives.  We ascended the stairs and viewed the body.  Miss Brenda Tregennis had been a very beautiful girl, though now verging upon middle age.  Her dark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in death, but there still lingered upon it something of that convulsion of horror which had been her last human emotion.  From her bedroom we descended to the sitting-room, where this strange tragedy had actually occurred.  The charred ashes of the overnight fire lay in the grate.  On the table were the four guttered and burned-out candles, with the cards scattered over its surface.  The chairs had been moved back against the walls, but all else was as it had been the night before.  Holmes paced with light, swift steps about the room; he sat in the various chairs, drawing them up and reconstructing their positions.  He tested how much of the garden was visible; he examined the floor, the ceiling, and the fireplace; but never once did I see that sudden brightening of his eyes and tightening of his lips which would have told me that he saw some gleam of light in this utter darkness.  \"Why a fire?\" he asked once.  \"Had they always a fire in this small room on a spring evening?\"  Mortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. For that reason, after his arrival, the fire was lit.  \"What are you going to do now, Mr. Holmes?\" he asked.  My friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm.  \"I think, Watson, that I shall resume that course of tobacco-poisoning which you have so often and so justly condemned,\" said he.  \"With your permission, gentlemen, we will now return to our cottage, for I am not aware that any new factor is likely to come to our notice here.  I will turn the facts over in my mind, Mr. Tregennis, and should anything occur to me I will certainly communicate with you and the vicar.  In the meantime I wish you both good-morning.\"  It was not until long after we were back in Poldhu Cottage that Holmes broke his complete and absorbed silence.  He sat coiled in his armchair, his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible amid the blue swirl of his tobacco smoke, his black brows drawn down, his forehead contracted, his eyes vacant and far away.  Finally he laid down his pipe and sprang to his feet.  \"It won't do, Watson!\" said he with a laugh.  \"Let us walk along the cliffs together and search for flint arrows.  We are more likely to find them than clues to this problem.  To let the brain work"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2349"],["title","The Adventure of the Devil's Foot (#2)"],["body","sufficient material is like racing an engine.  It racks itself to pieces.  The sea air, sunshine, and patience, Watson--all else will come.  \"Now, let us calmly define our position, Watson,\" he continued as we skirted the cliffs together.  \"Let us get a firm grip of the very little which we DO know, so that when fresh facts arise we may be ready to fit them into their places.  I take it, in the first place, that neither of us is prepared to admit diabolical intrusions into the affairs of men.  Let us begin by ruling that entirely out of our minds. Very good.  There remain three persons who have been grievously stricken by some conscious or unconscious human agency.  That is firm ground.  Now, when did this occur?  Evidently, assuming his narrative to be true, it was immediately after Mr. Mortimer Tregennis had left the room.  That is a very important point.  The presumption is that it was within a few minutes afterwards.  The cards still lay upon the table. It was already past their usual hour for bed.  Yet they had not changed their position or pushed back their chairs.  I repeat, then, that the occurrence was immediately after his departure, and not later than eleven o'clock last night.  \"Our next obvious step is to check, so far as we can, the movements of Mortimer Tregennis after he left the room.  In this there is no difficulty, and they seem to be above suspicion. Knowing my methods as you do, you were, of course, conscious of the somewhat clumsy water-pot expedient by which I obtained a clearer impress of his foot than might otherwise have been possible.  The wet, sandy path took it admirably. Last night was also wet, you will remember, and it was not difficult--having obtained a sample print--to pick out his track among others and to follow his movements.  He appears to have walked away swiftly in the direction of the vicarage.  \"If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared from the scene, and yet some outside person affected the card-players, how can we reconstruct that person, and how was such an impression of horror conveyed?  Mrs. Porter may be eliminated.  She is evidently harmless.  Is there any evidence that someone crept up to the garden window and in some manner produced so terrific an effect that he drove those who saw it out of their senses?  The only suggestion in this direction comes from Mortimer Tregennis himself, who says that his brother spoke about some movement in the garden.  That is certainly remarkable, as the night was rainy, cloudy, and dark.  Anyone who had the design to alarm these people would be compelled to place his very face against the glass before he could be seen.  There is a three-foot flower-border outside this window, but no indication of a footmark.  It is difficult to imagine, then, how an outsider could have made so terrible an impression upon the company, nor have we found any possible motive for so strange and elaborate an attempt.  You perceive our difficulties, Watson?\"  \"They are only too clear,\" I answered with conviction.  \"And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not insurmountable,\" said Holmes.  \"I fancy that among your extensive archives, Watson, you may find some which were nearly as obscure. Meanwhile, we shall put the case aside until more accurate data are available, and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit of neolithic man.\"  I may have commented upon my friend's power of mental detachment, but never have I wondered at it more than upon that spring morning in Cornwall when for two hours he discoursed upon celts, arrowheads, and shards, as lightly as if no sinister mystery were waiting for his solution.  It was not until we had returned in the afternoon to our cottage that we found a visitor awaiting us, who soon brought our minds back to the matter in hand.  Neither of us needed to be told who that visitor was.  The huge body, the craggy and deeply seamed face with the fierce eyes and hawk-like nose, the grizzled hair which nearly brushed our cottage ceiling, the beard--golden at the fringes and white near the lips, save for the nicotine stain from his perpetual cigar--all these were as well known in London as in Africa, and could only be associated with the tremendous personality of Dr. Leon Sterndale, the great lion-hunter and explorer.  We had heard of his presence in the district and had once or twice caught sight of his tall figure upon the moorland paths. He made no advances to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him, as it was well known that it was his love of seclusion which caused him to spend the greater part of the intervals between his journeys in a small bungalow buried in the lonely wood of Beauchamp Arriance.  Here, amid his books and his maps, he lived an absolutely lonely life, attending to his own simple wants and paying little apparent heed to the affairs of his neighbours.  It was a surprise to me, therefore, to hear him asking Holmes in an eager voice whether he had made any advance in his reconstruction of this mysterious episode.  \"The county police are utterly at fault,\" said he, \"but perhaps your wider experience has suggested some conceivable explanation.  My only claim to being taken into your confidence is that during my many residences here I have come to know this family of Tregennis very well--indeed, upon my Cornish mother's side I could call them cousins--and their strange fate has naturally been a great shock to me.  I may tell you that I had got as far as Plymouth upon my way to Africa, but the news reached me this morning, and I came straight back again to help in the inquiry.\"  Holmes raised his eyebrows.  \"Did you lose your boat through it?\"  \"I will take the next.\"  \"Dear me! that is friendship indeed.\"  \"I tell you they were relatives.\"  \"Quite so--cousins of your mother.  Was your baggage aboard the ship?\"  \"Some of it, but the main part at the hotel.\"  \"I see.  But surely this event could not have found its way into the Plymouth morning papers.\"  \"No, sir; I had a telegram.\"  \"Might I ask from whom?\"  A shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer.  \"You are very inquisitive, Mr. Holmes.\"  \"It is my business.\"  With an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure.  \"I have no objection to telling you,\" he said.  \"It was Mr. Roundhay, the vicar, who sent me the telegram which recalled me.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Holmes.  \"I may say in answer to your original question that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of this case, but that I have every hope of reaching some conclusion.  It would be premature to say more.\"  \"Perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in any particular direction?\"  \"No, I can hardly answer that.\"  \"Then I have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit.\"  The famous doctor strode out of our cottage in considerable ill-humour, and within five minutes Holmes had followed him.  I saw him no more until the evening, when he returned with a slow step and haggard face which assured me that he had made no great progress with his investigation. He glanced at a telegram which awaited him and threw it into the grate.  \"From the Plymouth hotel, Watson,\" he said.  \"I learned the name of it from the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale's account was true.  It appears that he did indeed spend last night there, and that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on to Africa, while he returned to be present at this investigation.  What do you make of that, Watson?\"  \"He is deeply interested.\"  \"Deeply interested--yes.  There is a thread here which we had not yet grasped and which might lead us through the tangle.  Cheer up, Watson, for I am very sure that our material has not yet all come to hand. When it does we may soon leave our difficulties behind us.\"  Little did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be realized, or how strange and sinister would be that new development which opened up an entirely fresh line of investigation.  I was shaving at my window in the morning when I heard the rattle of hoofs and, looking up, saw a dog-cart coming at a gallop down the road.  It pulled up at our door, and our friend, the vicar, sprang from it and rushed up our garden path. Holmes was already dressed, and we hastened down to meet him.  Our visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate, but at last in gasps and bursts his tragic story came out of him.  \"We are devil-ridden, Mr. Holmes!  My poor parish is devil-ridden!\" he cried.  \"Satan himself is loose in it!  We are given over into his hands!\"  He danced about in his agitation, a ludicrous object if it were not for his ashy face and startled eyes.  Finally he shot out his terrible news.  \"Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly the same symptoms as the rest of his family.\"  Holmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an instant.  \"Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?\"  \"Yes, I can.\"  \"Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast.  Mr. Roundhay, we are entirely at your disposal.  Hurry--hurry, before things get disarranged.\"  The lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an angle by themselves, the one above the other.  Below was a large sitting-room; above, his bedroom.  They looked out upon a croquet lawn which came up to the windows.  We had arrived before the doctor or the police, so that everything was absolutely undisturbed.  Let me describe exactly the scene as we saw it upon that misty March morning.  It has left an impression which can never be effaced from my mind.  The atmosphere of the room was of a horrible and depressing stuffiness. The servant who had first entered had thrown up the window, or it would have been even more intolerable.  This might partly be due to the fact that a lamp stood flaring and smoking on the centre table.  Beside it sat the dead man, leaning back in his chair, his thin beard projecting, his spectacles pushed up on to his forehead, and his"]]]
