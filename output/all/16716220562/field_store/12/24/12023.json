It rested on the _inner_ collar of the dress, and the _outer_ collar--of stout india-rubber--was drawn over it.  In this outer collar were twelve holes, corresponding to twelve screws round the edge of the breast-plate.  When these holes had been fitted over their respective screws, a breast-plate-band, in four pieces, was placed over them and screwed tight by means of nuts--thus rendering the connection between the dress and the breast-plate perfectly water-tight.  It now only remained to screw the helmet to the circular neck of the breast-plate.  Previously, however, a woollen night-cap was drawn over the poor man's head, well down on his ears, and Rooney looked--as indeed he afterwards admitted that he felt--as if he were going to be hanged.  He thought, however, of the proverb, that a man who is born to be drowned never can be hanged, and somehow felt comforted.  The diving helmet is made of tinned copper, and much too large for the largest human head, in order that the wearer may have room to move his head freely about inside of it.  It should not touch the head in any part, but is fixed rigidly to the breast-plate, resting on the shoulders, and does not partake of the motions of the head.  In it are three round openings filled with the thickest plate-glass and protected by brass bars or guards; also an outlet-valve to allow the foul air to escape; a short metal tube with an inlet-valve, to which the air-pump is screwed; and a regulating cock for getting rid of excess of air.  The arrangement is such, that the fresh air enters, and is spread over the front of the diver's face, while the foul escapes at the back of his head.  By a clever contrivance--a segmental screw--the helmet can be fixed to its neck with one-eighth of a turn, instead of having to be twisted round several times.  To various hooks and studs on the helmet and breast-plate are hung two leaden masses weighing about forty pounds each.  These weights having been attached, and a waist-belt with a knife in it put round Rooney's waist, along with the life-line, the air-tube was affixed, and he was asked by Baldwin how he felt.  \"A trifle heavy,\" replied the pupil, through the front hole of the helmet, which was not yet closed.  \"That feeling will go off entirely when you're under water,\" said Baldwin.  \"Now, remember, if you want more air, just give two pulls on the air-pipe--an' don't pull as if you was tryin' to haul down the barge; we'll be sure to feel you.  Be gentle and quiet, whatever ye do. Gettin' flurried never does any good whatever.  D'ee hear?\"  \"Yis, sur,\" answered Rooney, and his voice sounded metallic and hollow, even to those outside--much more so to himself!  \"Well, then, if we give you too much air, you've only got to open the front-valve--so, and, when you're easy, shut it.  When you get down to the bottom, give one--only one--pull on the life-line, which means `All right,' and I'll give one pull in reply.  We must always reply to each other, d'ee see? because if you don't answer, of course we'll think you've been suffocated, or entangled at the bottom among wreckage and what-not, or been took with a fit, an' we'll haul you up, as hard as we can; so you'll have to be particular.  D'ee understand?\"  Again the learner replied \"Yis, sur,\" but less confidently than before, for Baldwin's cautions, although meant to have an encouraging effect, proved rather to be alarming.  \"Now,\" continued the teacher, leading his pupil to the side of the barge, \"be sure to go down slow, and come up slow.  Whatever you do, do it slow, for if you do it fast--especially in comin' up--you'll come to grief.  If a man comes up too fast from deep water, the condensed air inside of him is apt to swell him out, and the brain bein' relieved too suddenly from the pressure, there's a rush of blood to it, and a singin' in the ears, and a pain in the head, with other unpleasant symptoms. Why,\" continued Baldwin, growing energetic, \"I've actually known a man killed outright by bein' pulled up too quick from a depth of twenty fathoms.  So mark my words, lad, and take it easy.  If you get nervous, just stop a bit an' amuse yourself with thinkin' over what I've told you, and then go on with your descent.\"  At this point Rooney's heart almost failed him, but, catching sight of Maxwell's half-amused, half-contemptuous face, he stepped resolutely on the ladder, and began to descend in haste.  \"Hold on!\" roared Baldwin, laying hold of the life-line.  \"Why, man alive, you're off without the front-glass!\"  \"Och!  Whirra!  So I am,\" said Rooney, pausing.  \"Pump away, lads,\" cried Baldwin, looking back at his assistants.  \"Whist!  What's that?\" asked the pupil excitedly, as a hissing sound buzzed round his head.  \"Why, that's the air coming in.  Now then, I'll screw on the glass.  Are you all right?\"  \"All right,\" replied Rooney, telling, as he said himself afterwards, \"one of the biggist lies he iver towld in his life!\"  The glass was screwed on, and the learner was effectually cut off from all connection with the outer air, save through the slight medium of an india-rubber pipe.  Having thus screwed him up--or in--Baldwin gave him the patronising pat on the helmet, as a signal for him to descend, but Rooney stood tightly fixed to the ladder, and motionless.  Again Baldwin patted his head encouragingly, but still Rooney stood as motionless as one of the iron-clad warriors in the Tower of London.  The fact was, his courage had totally failed him.  He was ashamed to come up, and could not by any effort of will force himself to go down.  \"Why, what's wrong?\" demanded Baldwin, looking in at the glass, which, however, was so clouded with the inmate's breath that he could only be seen dimly.  It was evident that Rooney was speaking in an excited voice, but no sound was audible through that impervious mass of metal and glass.  Baldwin was therefore about to unscrew the mouth-glass, when accident brought about what Rooney's will could not accomplish.  In attempting to move, the poor pupil missed his hold, or slipped somehow, and fell into the sea with a sounding splash.  \"Let him go, boys--gently, or he'll break everything.  A dip'll do him no harm,\" cried Baldwin to the alarmed assistants.  The men let the life-line and air-tube slip, until the rushing descent was somewhat abated, and then, checking the involuntary diver, they hauled him slowly to the surface, where his arms and open palms went swaying wildly round until they came in contact with the ladder, on which they fastened with a grip that was sufficient to have squeezed the life out of a gorilla.  In a few seconds he ascended a step, and his head emerged, then another step, and Baldwin was able to unscrew the glass.  The first word that the poor man uttered through his porthole was \"Och!\" the next, \"Musha!\"  A burst of laughter from his friends above somewhat reassured him, and again the tinge of contempt in Maxwell's voice reinfused courage and desperate resolve.  \"Why, man, what was your haste?\" said Baldwin.  \"Sure the rounds o' yer ladder was slippy,\" answered Rooney, with some indignation.  \"Didn't ye see, I lost me howld?  Come, putt on the glass an' I'll try again.  Never say die was a motto of me owld father, an' it was the only legacy he left me.--I'm ready, sur.\"  It is right here to remark that something of the pupil's return of courage and resolution was due to his quick perception.  He had time to reflect that he really had been at, or near, the bottom of the sea--at all events over head and ears in water--for several minutes without being drowned, even without being moistened, and his faith in the diving-dress, though still weak, had dawned sufficiently to assert itself as a power.  \"Ha!  My lad, you'll do.  You'll make a diver yet,\" said Baldwin, when about to readjust the glass.  \"I forgot to tell you that when your breath clouds the front-glass, you've only got to bend your head down, and wipe it off with your night-cap.  Now, then, down you go once more.\"  This time the pat on the head was followed by a descending motion.  The mailed figure was feeling with its right foot for the next round of the ladder.  Then slowly--very slowly--the left foot was let down, while the two hands held on with a tenacity that caused all the muscles and sinews to stand out rigidly.  Then one hand was loosened, and caught nervously at a lower round--then the other hand followed, and thus by degrees the pupil went under the surface, when his helmet appeared like a large round ball of light enveloped in the milky-way of air-bubbles that rose from it.  \"You'd better give the signal to ask if all's right,\" said Edgar, who felt a little anxious.  \"Do so,\" said Baldwin, nodding to the assistant.  The man obeyed, but no answering signal was returned.  According to rule they should instantly have hauled the diver up, but Baldwin bade them delay a moment.  \"I'm quite sure there's nothing wrong,\" he said, stooping over the side of the barge, and gazing into the water, \"it's only another touch of nervousness.--Ah!  I see him, holdin' on like a barnacle to the ladder, afraid to let go.  He'll soon tire of kickin' there--that's it: there he goes down the rope like the best of us.\"  In another moment the life-line and air-pipe ceased to run out, and then the assistant gave one pull on the line.  Immediately there came back _one pull_--all right.  \"_That's_ all right,\" repeated Baldwin; \"now the ice is fairly broken, and we'll soon see how he's going to get on.\"  In order that we too may see that more comfortably, you and I, reader, will again go under water and watch him.  We will also listen to him, for Rooney has a convenient habit of talking to himself, and neither water nor helmet can prevent _us_ from overhearing.  True to his instructions, the pupil proceeded to fasten his clew-line to the stone at the foot of the ladder-rope, and attempted to kneel.  \"Well, well,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23493"],["title","Under the Waves: Diving in Deep Waters (#5)"],["body","\" he said, \"did ye iver!  What would me mother say if she heard I couldn't git on my knees whin I tried to?\"  Rooney began this remark aloud, but the sound of his own voice was so horribly loud and unnaturally near that he finished off in a whisper, and continued his observations in that confidential tone.  \"Och!  Is it dancin' yer goin' to do, Rooney?--in the day-time too!\" he whispered, as his feet slowly left the bottom.  \"Howld on, man!\"  He made a futile effort to stoop and grasp the mud, then, bethinking himself of Baldwin's instructions, he remembered that too much air had a tendency to bring him to the surface, and that opening the front-valve was the remedy.  He was not much too soon in recollecting this, for, besides rising, he was beginning to feel a singing in his head and a disagreeable pressure on the ears, caused by the ever-increasing density of the air.  The moment the valve was fully opened, a rush out of air occurred which immediately sank him again, and he had now no difficulty in getting on his knees.  \"There's little enough light down here, anyhow,\" he muttered, as he fumbled about the stone sinker in a vain attempt to fasten his line to it, \"sure the windy must be dirty.\"  The thought reminded him of Baldwin's teaching.  He bent forward his head and wiped the glass with his night-cap, but without much advantage, for the dimness was caused by the muddiness of the water.  Just then he began to experience uncomfortable sensations; he felt a tendency to gasp for air, and became very hot, while his garments clasped his limbs very tightly.  He had, like Maxwell, forgotten to reclose the breast-valve, but, unlike the more experienced diver, he had failed to discover his omission.  He became flurried and anxious, and getting, more and more confused, fumbled nervously at his helmet to ascertain that all was right there.  In so doing he opened the little regulating cock, which served to form an additional outlet to foul air. This of course made matters worse.  The pressure of air in the dress was barely sufficient to prevent the water from entering by the breast-valve and regulating cock.  Perspiration burst out on his forehead.  He naturally raised his hand to wipe it away, but was prevented by the helmet.  Rooney possessed an active mind.  His thoughts flew fast.  This check induced the following ideas--  \"What if I shud want to scratch me head or blow me nose?  Or what if an earwig shud chance to have got inside this iron pot, and take a fancy to go into my ear?\"  His right ear became itchy at the bare idea.  He made a desperate blow at it, and skinned his knuckles, while a hitherto unconceived intensity of desire to scratch his head and blow his nose took violent possession of him.  Just then a dead cat, that had been flung into the harbour the night before, and had not been immersed long enough to rise to the surface, floated past with the tide, and its sightless eyeballs and ghastly row of teeth glared and glistened on him, as it surged against his front-glass.  A slight spirt of water came through the regulating cock at the same instant, as if the dead cat had spit in his face.  \"Hooroo!  Haul up!\" shouted Rooney, following the order with a yell that sounded like the concentrated voice of infuriated Ireland.  At the same time he seized the life-line and air-tube, and tugged at both, not four times, but nigh forty times four, and never ceased to tug until he found himself gasping on the deck of the barge with his helmet off and his comrades laughing round him.  \"It's not a bad beginning,\" said Baldwin, as he assisted his pupil to unrobe; \"you'll make a good diver in course o' time.\"  Baldwin was right in this prophecy, for in a few months Rooney Machowl became one of the best and coolest divers on his staff.  We need not try the reader's patience with an account of Edgar's descent, which immediately followed that of the Irishman.  Let it suffice to say that he too accomplished, with credit and with less demonstration, his first descent to the bottom of the sea.    CHAPTER THREE.  REFERS TO A SMALL TEA-PARTY, AND TOUCHES VERY MILDLY ON LOVE.  Miss Pritty was a good soul, but weak.  She was Edgar Berrington's maiden aunt--of an uncertain age--on the mother's side.  Her chief characteristic was delicacy--delicacy of health, delicacy of sentiment, delicacy of intellect--general delicacy, in fact, all over.  She was slight too--slightly made, slightly educated, slightly pretty, and slightly cracked.  But there were a few things in regard to which Miss Laura Pritty was strong.  She was strong in her affections, strong in her reverence for all good things (including a few bad things which in her innocence she thought good), strong in her prejudices and impulses, and strong--remarkably strong--in parentheses.  Her speech was eminently parenthetical, insomuch that the range of her ideas was wholly untrammelled by the proprieties of subject or language.  Given a point to be aimed at in conversation, Miss Pritty _never_ aimed at it.  She invariably began with it, and, parting finally from it at the outset, diverged to any or every other point in nature.  Perplexity, as a matter of course, was the usual result both in speaker and hearer, but then that mattered little, for Miss Pritty was also strong in easy-going good-nature.  On the evening in which we introduce her, Miss Pritty was going to have her dear and intimate friend Aileen Hazlit to tea, and she laid out her little tea-table with as much care as an engineer might have taken in drawing a mathematical problem.  The teapot was placed in the exact centre of the tray, with its spout and handle pointing so that a line drawn through them would have been parallel to the sides of her little \"boudoir.\"  The urn stood exactly behind it.  The sugar-basin formed, on one side of the tray, a _pendant_ to the cream-jug on the other, and inasmuch as the cream-jug was small, a toast-rack was coupled with it to constitute the necessary balance.  So, too, with the cups: they were placed equidistant from the teapot, the sides of the tray, and each other, while a salver of cake on one side of the table was scrupulously balanced by a plate of buns on the other side.  \"There she is--the _darling_!\" exclaimed Miss Pritty, with a little skip and (excuse the word) a giggle as the bell rang.  \"Miss Aileen Hazlit,\" announced Miss Pritty's small and only domestic, who flung wide open the door of the boudoir, as its owner was fond of styling it.  Whereupon there entered \"an angel in blue, with a straw hat and ostrich feather.\"  We quote from the last, almost dying, speech of a hopeless youth in the town--a lawyer's clerk--whose heart was stamped over so completely with the word \"Aileen\" that it was unrecognisable, and practically useless for any purpose except beating--which it did, hard, at all times.  Aileen was beautiful beyond compare, because, in her case, extreme beauty of face and feature was coupled with rare beauty of expression, indicating fine qualities of mind.  She was quiet in demeanour, grave in speech, serious and very earnest in thought, enthusiastic in action, unconscious and unselfish.  \"Pooh!  Perfection!\"  I hear some lady reader ejaculate.  No, fair one, not quite that, but as near it as was compatible with humanity.  Happily there are many such in the world--some with more and some with less of the external beauty--and man is blessed and the world upheld by them.  The chief bond that bound Aileen and Miss Pritty together was a text of Scripture, \"Consider the poor.\"  The latter had strong sympathy with the poor, being herself one of the number.  The former, being rich in faith as well as in means, \"considered\" them.  The two laid their heads together and concerted plans for the \"raising of the masses,\" which might have been food for study to _some_ statesmen.  For instance, they fed the hungry and clothed the naked; they encouraged the well-disposed and reproved the evil; they \"scattered seeds of kindness\" wherever they went; they sowed the precious Word of God in all kinds of ground--good and bad; they comforted the sorrowing; they visited the sick and the prisoner; they refused to help, or, in any way to encourage, the idle; they handed the obstreperous and violent over to the police, with the hope--if not the recommendation--that the rod should not be spared; and in all cases they prayed for them.  The results were considerable, but, not being ostentatiously trumpeted, were not always recognised or traced to their true cause.  \"Come away, darling,\" exclaimed Miss Pritty, eagerly embracing and kissing her friend, who accepted, but did not return, the embrace, though she did the kiss.  \"I thought you were not coming at all, and I have not seen you for a whole week!  What has kept you?  There, put off your hat.  I'm _so_ glad to see you, dear Aileen.  Isn't it strange that I'm so fond of you?  They say that people who are contrasts generally draw together--at least I've often heard Mrs Boxer, the wife of Captain Boxer, you know, of the navy, who used to swear so dreadfully before he was married, but, I am happy to say, has quite given it up now, which says a great deal for wedded life, though it's a state that I don't quite believe in myself, for if Adam had never married Eve he would not have been tempted to eat the forbidden fruit, and so there would have been no sin and no sorrow or poverty--no poor!  Only think of that.\"  \"So that our chief occupation would have been gone,\" said Aileen, with a slight twinkle of her lustrous blue eyes, \"and perhaps you and I might never have met.\"  Miss Pritty replied to this something very much to the effect that she would have preferred the entrance of sin and all its consequences-- poverty included--into the world, rather than have missed making the friendship of Miss Hazlit.  At least her words might have borne that interpretation--or any other!  \"My father detained me,\" said Aileen, seating herself at the"]]]
