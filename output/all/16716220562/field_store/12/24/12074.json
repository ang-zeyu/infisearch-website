Till, as a mist, their beauty died,     Their singing shrill and fainter grew;     And daylight tremulous and wide     Flooded the moorland through and through;     Till Urdon's copper weathercock     Was reared in golden flame afar,     And dim from moonlit dreams awoke     The towers and groves of Arroar.         REVERIE       When slim Sophia mounts her horse        And paces down the avenue,     It seems an inward melody          She paces to.      Each narrow hoof is lifted high       Beneath the dark enclust'ring pines,     A silver ray within his bit         And bridle shines.      His eye burns deep, his tail is arched,       And streams upon the shadowy air,     The daylight sleeks his jetty flanks,         His mistress' hair.      Her habit flows in darkness down,       Upon the stirrup rests her foot,     Her brow is lifted, as if earth         She heeded not.      'Tis silent in the avenue,       The sombre pines are mute of song,     The blue is dark, there moves no breeze         The boughs among.      When slim Sophia mounts her horse       And paces down the avenue,     It seems an inward melody         She paces to.         THE THREE BEGGARS       'Twas autumn daybreak gold and wild,       While past St Ann's grey tower they shuffled,     Three beggars spied a fairy-child         In crimson mantle muffled.      The daybreak lighted up her face       All pink, and sharp, and emerald-eyed;     She looked on them a little space,         And shrill as hautboy cried:--      'O three tall footsore men of rags       Which walking this gold morn I see,     What will ye give me from your bags         For fairy kisses three?'      The first, that was a reddish man,       Out of his bundle takes a crust:     'La, by the tombstones of St Ann,         There's fee, if fee ye must!'      The second, that was a chesnut man,       Out of his bundle draws a bone:     'La, by the belfry of St Ann,         And all my breakfast gone!'      The third, that was a yellow man,       Out of his bundle picks a groat,     'La, by the Angel of St Ann,         And I must go without.'      That changeling, lean and icy-lipped,       Touched crust, and bone, and groat, and lo!     Beneath her finger taper-tipped         The magic all ran through.      Instead of crust a peacock pie,       Instead of bone sweet venison,     Instead of groat a white lilie         With seven blooms thereon.      And each fair cup was deep with wine:       Such was the changeling's charity,     The sweet feast was enough for nine,         But not too much for three.      O toothsome meat in jelly froze!       O tender haunch of elfin stag!     O rich the odour that arose!         O plump with scraps each bag!      There, in the daybreak gold and wild,       Each merry-hearted beggar man     Drank deep unto the fairy child,         And blessed the good St Ann.         THE DWARF       'Now, Jinnie, my dear, to the dwarf be off,         That lives in Barberry Wood,     And fetch me some honey, but be sure you don't laugh,--       He hates little girls that are rude, are rude,         He hates little girls that are rude.'      Jane tapped at the door of the house in the wood,         And the dwarf looked over the wall,     He eyed her so queer, 'twas as much as she could       To keep from laughing at all, at all,         To keep from laughing at all.      His shoes down the passage came clod, clod, clod,         And when he opened the door,     He croaked so harsh, 'twas as much as she could       To keep from laughing the more, the more,         To keep from laughing the more.      As there, with his bushy red beard, he stood,         Pricked out to double its size,     He squinted so cross, 'twas as much as she could       To keep the tears out of her eyes, her eyes,         To keep the tears out of her eyes.      He slammed the door, and went clod, clod, clod,         But while in the porch she bides,     He squealed so fierce, 'twas as much as she could       To keep from cracking her sides, her sides,         To keep from cracking her sides.      He threw a pumpkin over the wall,         And melons and apples beside,     So thick in the air, that to see 'em all fall,       She laughed, and laughed, till she cried, cried, cried,         Jane laughed and laughed till she cried.      Down fell her teardrops a pit-apat-pat,         And red as a rose she grew;--     'Kah! kah!' said the dwarf, 'is it crying you're at?       It's the very worst thing you could do, do, do,         It's the very worst thing you could do.'      He slipped like a monkey up into a tree,         He shook her down cherries like rain;     'See now,' says he, cheeping, 'a blackbird I be,       Laugh, laugh, little Jinnie, again-gain-gain,         Laugh, laugh, little Jinnie, again.'      Ah me! what a strange, what a gladsome duet         From a house i' the deeps of a wood!     Such shrill and such harsh voices never met yet       A-laughing as loud as they could-could-could,         A-laughing as loud as they could.      Come Jinnie, come dwarf, cocksparrow, and bee,         There's a ring gaudy-green in the dell,     Sing, sing, ye sweet cherubs, that flit in the tree;       La! who can draw tears from a well-well-well,         Who ever drew tears from a well!         ALULVAN       The sun is clear of bird and cloud,     The grass shines windless, grey, and still,     In dusky ruin the owl dreams on,     The cuckoo echoes on the hill;       Yet soft along Alulvan's walks         The ghost at noonday stalks.      His eyes in shadow of his hat     Stare on the ruins of his house;     His cloak, up-fasten'd with a brooch,     Of faded velvet grey as mouse,       Brushes the roses as he goes:         Yet wavers not one rose.      The wild birds in a cloud fly up     From their sweet feeding in the fruit;     The droning of the bees and flies     Rises gradual as a lute;       Is it for fear the birds are flown,         And shrills the insect-drone?      Thick is the ivy o'er Alulvan,     And crisp with summer-heat its turf;     Far, far across its empty pastures     Alulvan's sands are white with surf:       And he himself is grey as sea,         Watching beneath an elder-tree.      All night the fretful, shrill Banshee     Lurks in the chambers' dark festoons,     Calling for ever, o'er garden and river,     Through magpie changing of the moons:       'Alulvan, O, alas! Alulvan,         The doom of lone Alulvan!'         THE PEDLAR       There came a Pedlar to an evening house;     Sweet Lettice, from her lattice looking down,     Wondered what man he was, so curious     His black hair dangled on his tattered gown:     Then lifts he up his face, with glittering eyes,--     'What will you buy, sweetheart?--Here's honeycomb,     And mottled pippins, and sweet mulberry pies,     Comfits and peaches, snowy cherry bloom,     To keep in water for to make night sweet:     All that you want, sweetheart,--come, taste and eat!'      Ev'n with his sugared words, returned to her     The clear remembrance of a gentle voice:--     'And O! my child, should ever a flatterer     Tap with his wares, and promise of all joys     And vain sweet pleasures that on earth may be;     Seal up your ears, sing some old happy song,     Confuse his magic who is all mockery:     His sweets are death.' Yet, still, how she doth long     But just to taste, then shut the lattice tight,     And hide her eyes from the delicious sight!      'What must I pay?' she whispered. 'Pay!' says he,     'Pedlar I am who through this wood do roam,     One lock of hair is gold enough for me,     For apple, peach, comfit, or honeycomb!'     But from her bough a drowsy squirrel cried,     'Trust him not, Lettice, trust, oh trust him not!'     And many another woodland tongue beside     Rose softly in the silence--'Trust him not!'     Then cried the Pedlar in a bitter voice,     'What, in the thicket, is this idle noise?'      A late, harsh blackbird smote him with her wings,     As through the glade, dark in the dim, she flew;     Yet still the Pedlar his old burden sings,--     'What, pretty sweetheart, shall I show to you?     Here's orange ribands, here's a string of pearls,     Here's silk of buttercup and pansy glove,     A pin of tortoiseshell for windy curls,     A box of silver, scented sweet with clove:     Come now,' he says, with dim and lifted face,     'I pass not often such a lonely place.'      'Pluck not a hair!' a hidden rabbit cried,     'With but one hair he'll steal thy heart away,     Then only sorrow shall thy lattice hide:     Go in! all honest pedlars come by day.'     There was dead silence in the drowsy wood;     'Here's syrup for to lull sweet maids to sleep;     And bells for dreams, and fairy wine and food     All day thy heart in happiness to keep';--     And now she takes the scissors on her thumb,--     'O, then, no more unto my lattice come!'      O sad the sound of weeping in the wood!     Now only night is where the Pedlar was;     And bleak as frost upon a too-sweet bud     His magic steals in darkness, O alas!     Why all the summer doth sweet Lettice pine?     And, ere the wheat is ripe, why lies her gold     Hid 'neath fresh new-pluckt sprigs of eglantine?     Why all the morning hath the cuckoo tolled,     Sad to and fro in green and secret ways,     With lonely bells the burden of his days?      And, in the market-place, what man is this     Who wears a loop of gold upon his breast,     Stuck heartwise; and whose glassy flatteries     Take all the townsfolk ere they go to rest     Who come to buy and gossip? Doth his eye     Remember a face lovely in a wood?     O people! hasten, hasten, do not buy     His woful wares; the bird of grief doth brood     There where his heart should be; and far away     Dew lies on grave-flowers this selfsame day!         THE GREY WOLF       'A fagot, a fagot, go fetch for the fire, son!'       'O, Mother, the wolf looks in at the door!'   "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23545"],["title","Songs of Childhood (#3)"],["body","  'Cry Shoo! now, cry Shoo! thou fierce grey wolf fly, now;       Haste thee away, he will fright thee no more.'      'I ran, O, I ran, but the grey wolf ran faster,       O, Mother, I cry in the air at thy door,     Cry Shoo! now, cry Shoo! but his fangs were so cruel,       Thy son (save his hatchet) thou'lt never see more.'         THE OGRE       'Tis moonlight on Trebarwith Vale,       And moonlight on an Ogre keen,     Who prowling hungry through the dale       A lone cottage hath seen.      Small with thin smoke ascending up       Three casements and a door:--     The Ogre eager is to sup,       And here seems dainty store.      Sweet as a larder to a mouse,       So to him staring down,     Seemed the sweet-windowed moonlit house,       With jasmine overgrown.      He snorted, as the billows snort       In darkness of the night,     Betwixt his lean locks tawny-swart,       He glowered on the sight.      Into the garden sweet with peas       He put his wooden shoe,     And bending back the apple trees       Crept covetously through;      Then, stooping, with an impious eye       Stared through the lattice small,     And spied two children which did lie       Asleep, against the wall.      Into their dreams no shadow fell,       Of his disastrous thumb     Groping discreet, and gradual,       Across the quiet room.      But scarce his nail had scraped the cot       Wherein these children lay,     As if his malice were forgot,       It suddenly did stay.      For faintly in the ingle-nook       He heard a cradlesong,     That rose into his thoughts and woke       Terror them among.      For she who in the kitchen sat       Darning by the fire,     Guileless of what he would be at,       Sang sweet as wind or wire:--      'Lullay, thou little tiny child,       By-by, lullay, lullie;     Jesu of glory, meek and mild,       This night remember ye!      'Fiend, witch, and goblin, foul and wild,       He deems 'em smoke to be;     Lullay, thou little tiny child,       By-by, lullay, lullie!'      The Ogre lifted up his eyes       Into the moon's pale ray,     And gazed upon her leopard-wise,       Cruel and clear as day;      He snarled in gluttony and fear:       'The wind blows dismally,     Jesu in storm my lambs be near,       By-by, lullay, lullie!'      And like a ravenous beast which sees       The hunter's icy eye,     So did this wretch in wrath confess       Sweet Jesu's mastery.      He lightly drew his greedy thumb       From out that casement pale,     And strode, enormous, swiftly home,       Whinnying down the dale.         DAME HICKORY       'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,     Here's sticks for your fire,     Furze-twigs, and oak-twigs,     And beech-twigs, and briar!'     But when old Dame Hickory came for to see,     She found 'twas the voice of the false faerie.      'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,     Here's meat for your broth,     Goose-flesh, and hare's flesh,     And pig's trotters both!'     But when old Dame Hickory came for to see,     She found 'twas the voice of the false faerie.      'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,     Here's a wolf at your door,     His teeth grinning white,     And his tongue wagging sore!'     'Nay!' said Dame Hickory, 'ye false faerie!'     But a wolf 'twas indeed, and famished was he.      'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,     Here's buds for your tomb,     Bramble, and lavender,     And rosemary bloom!'     'Hush!' said Dame Hickory, 'ye false faerie,     Ye cry like a wolf, ye do, and trouble poor me.'         THE PILGRIM       'Shall we carry now your bundle,         You old grey man?      Over hill and over meadow,     Lighter than an owlet's shadow,     We will whirl it through the air,     Through blue regions shrill and bare;      Shall we carry now your bundle,         You old grey man?'      The Pilgrim lifted up his eyes     And saw three fiends, in the skies,     Stooping o'er that lonely place         Evil in form and face.      'O leave me, leave me, leave me,         Ye three wild fiends!      Far it is my feet must wander,     And my city lieth yonder;     I must bear my bundle alone,     Help nor solace suffer none:      O leave me, leave me, leave me,         Ye three wild fiends!'      The fiends stared down with greedy eye,     Fanning the chill air duskily,     'Twixt their hoods they stoop and cry:--      'Shall we smooth the path before you,         You old grey man?      Sprinkle it green with gilded showers,     Strew it o'er with painted flowers?     Shall we blow sweet airs on it,     Lure the magpie there to flit?      Shall we smooth the path before you,         You old grey man?'      'O silence, silence, silence!         Ye three wild fiends!      Over bog, and fen, and boulder,     I must bear it on my shoulder,     Beaten of wind, torn of briar,     Smitten of rain, parched of fire:      O silence, silence, silence!         Ye three wild fiends!'      It seemed a smoke obscured the air,     Bright lightning quivered in the gloom,     And a faint voice of thunder spake     Far in the lone hill-hollows--'Come!'     Then half in fury, half in dread,     The fiends drew closer down and said:--      'Grey old man but sleep awhile;         Sad old man!      Thorn, and dust, and ice, and heat;     Tarry now, sit down and eat;     Heat, and ice, and dust, and thorn;     Stricken, footsore, parched, forlorn,--     Juice of purple grape shall be     Youth and solace unto thee.      With sweet wire and reed we'll haunt you;     Songs of the valley shall enchant you;     Rest now, lest this night you die:     Sweet be now our lullaby:      'Grey old man, come sleep awhile,         Stubborn old man!'      The pilgrim crouches terrified     At stooping hood, and glassy face,     Gloating, evil, side by side;     Terror and hate brood o'er the place;     He flings his withered hands on high     With a bitter, breaking cry:--      'Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me,         Ye three wild fiends:     If I lay me down in slumber,       Then I lay me down in wrath;     If I stir not in sweet dreaming,       Then I wither in my path;     If I hear sweet voices singing,         'Tis a demon's lullaby,     And in \"hideous storm and terror\"         Wake but to die!'      And even while he spake, the sun     From the sweet hills pierced the gloom,     Kindling th' affrighted fiends upon.     Wild flapped their wings, as if in doom,     He heard a dismal hooting laughter:--      Nought but a little rain fell after,     And from the cloud whither they flew     A storm-sweet lark rose in the blue:     And his bundle seemed of flowers         In his solitary hours.         THE GAGE       'Lady Jane, O Lady Jane!     Your hound hath broken bounds again,       And chased my timorous deer, O;         If him I see,         That hour he'll dee;       My brakes shall be his bier, O.'      'Lord Aërie, Lord Aërie,     My hound, I trow, is fleet and free,       He's welcome to your deer, O;         Shoot, shoot you may,         He'll gang his way,       Your threats we nothing fear, O.'      He's fetched him in, he's fetched him in,     Gone all his swiftness, all his din,       White fang, and glowering eye, O:         'Here is your beast,         And now at least       My herds in peace shall lie, O.'      \"In peace!\" my lord, O mark me well!     For what my jolly hound befell       You shall sup twenty-fold, O!         For every tooth         Of his, i'sooth,       A stag in pawn I hold, O.      'Huntsman and horn, huntsman and horn,     Shall scare your heaths and coverts lorn,       Braying 'em shrill and clear, O;         But lone and still         Shall lift each hill,       Each valley wan and sere, O.      'Ride up you may, ride down you may,     Lonely or trooped, by night or day,       My hound shall haunt you ever:         Bird, beast, and game         Shall dread the same,       The wild fish of your river.'      Her cheek is like the angry rose,     Her eye with wrath and pity flows:       He gazes fierce and round, O,--         'Dear Lord!' he says,         'What loveliness       To waste upon a hound, O.      'I'd give my stags, my hills and dales,     My stormcocks and my nightingales       To have undone this deed, O;         For deep beneath         My heart is death       Which for her love doth bleed, O.'      Wanders he up, wanders he down,     On foot, a-horse, by night and noon:       His lands are bleak and drear, O;         Forsook his dales         Of nightingales,       Forsook his moors of deer, O.      Forsook his heart, ah me! of mirth;     There's nothing lightsome left on earth:       Only one scene is fain, O,         Where far remote         The moonbeams gloat,       And sleeps the lovely Jane, O.      Until an eve when lone he went,     Gnawing his beard in dreariment,       Lo! from a thicket hidden,         Lovely as flower         In April hour,       Steps forth a form unbidden.      'Get ye now down, Lord Aërie,     I'm troubled so I'm like to dee,'       She cries, 'twixt joy and grief, O;         'The hound is dead,         When all is said,       But love is past belief, O.      'Nights, nights I've lain your lands to see,     Forlorn and still--and all for me,       All for a foolish curse, O;         Now here am I         Come out to die,       To live unlov'd is worse, O!'      In faith, this lord, in that lone dale,     Hears now a sweeter nightingale,       And lairs a tend'rer deer, O;         His sorrow goes         Like mountain snows       In waters sweet and clear, O!      Let the hound bay in Shadowland,     Tuning his ear to understand       What voice hath tamed this Aërie;         Chafe, chafe he may         The stag all day,       And never thirst nor weary.      Now here he smells, now there he smells,     Winding his voice along the dells,       Till grey flows up the morn, O;         Then hies again         To Lady Jane,       No longer now forlorn, O.      Ay, as it were a bud, did break     To loveliness"]]]
