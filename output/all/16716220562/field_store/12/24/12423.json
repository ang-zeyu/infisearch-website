After a while they reached Madison Park, and Frank, according to his instructions, took a seat, allowing Fido to curl up at his side.  \"This isn't very hard work,\" thought Frank. \"I wish I had a book or paper to read, to while away the time.\"  While he was sitting there Victor Dupont came sauntering along.  \"Halloa!\" he exclaimed, in surprise, as he recognized Frank, \"is that you?\"  \"I believe it is,\" answered Frank, with a smile.  \"Are you a telegraph boy?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I thought you were a newsboy?\"  \"So I was; but I have changed my business.\"  \"What are you doing here?\"  \"Taking care of a dog,\" said Frank, laughing.  \"Is that the dog?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"It's a beastly little brute. What's its name?\"  \"Fido.\"  \"Who does it belong to?\"  Frank answered.  \"I know,\" said Victor; \"it's a fat lady living on the avenue. I have seen her out often with little pug. How do you feel, Fido?\" and Victor began to pull the hair of the lady's favorite.  \"Don't do that, Victor,\" remonstrated Frank.  \"Why not?\"  \"Mrs. Leroy wouldn't like it.\"  \"Mrs. Leroy isn't here.\"  \"I am,\" said Frank, emphatically, \"and that is the same thing.\"  Victor, by way of reply, pinched Fido's ear, and the little animal squeaked his disapproval.  \"Look here, Victor,\" said Frank, decidedly, \"you must stop that.\"  \"Must I?\" sneered Victor, contemptuously. \"'Suppose I don't?\"  \"Then I shall punch you,\" said Frank, quietly.  \"You are impertinent,\" said Victor, haughtily. \"You needn't put on such airs because you are nurse to a puppy.\"  \"That is better than being a puppy myself,\" retorted Frank.  \"Do you mean to insult me?\" demanded Victor, quickly.  \"No, unless you choose to think the remark fits you.\"  \"I have a great mind to give you a thrashing,\" said Victor, furiously.  \"Of course I should sit still and let you do it,\" said Frank, calmly. \"Fido is under my care, and I can't have him teased. That is right, isn't it?\"  \"I did wrong to notice you,\" said Victor. \"You are only a dog's nurse.\"  Frank laughed.  \"You are right,\" he said. \"It is new business for me, and though it is easy enough I can't say I like it. However, I am in the service of the Telegraph Company, and must do whatever is required.\"  Victor walked away, rather annoyed because he could not tease Frank.  \"The boy has no pride,\" he said to himself, \"or he wouldn't live out to take care of dogs. But, then, it is suitable enough for him.\"  \"Is that dawg yours?\" asked a rough-looking man, taking his seat on the bench near Frank.  \"No, sir.\"  \"How old is it?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"Looks like a dawg I used to own. Let me take him.\"  \"I would rather not,\" said Frank, coldly. \"It belongs to a lady who is very particular.\"  \"Oh, you won't, won't you?\" said the man, roughly. \"Danged if I don't think it is my dawg, after all;\" and the man seized Fido, and was about to carry him away.  But Frank seized him by the arm, and called for help.  \"What's the matter?\" asked a park policeman who, unobserved by either, had come up behind.  \"This man is trying to steal my dog,\" said Frank.  \"The dog is mine,\" said the thief, boldly.  \"Drop him!\" said the officer, authoritatively. \"I have seen that dog before. He belongs to neither of you.\"  \"That is true,\" said Frank. \"It belongs to Mrs. Leroy, of Madison avenue, and I am employed to take it out for an airing.\"  \"It's a lie!\" said the man, sullenly.  \"If you are seen again in this neighborhood,\" said the policeman, \"I shall arrest you. Now clear out!\"  The would-be thief slunk away, and Frank thanked the officer.  \"That man is a dog-stealer,\" said the policeman. \"His business is to steal dogs, and wait till a reward is offered. Look out for him!\"     CHAPTER XII.  A WAYWARD SON.   When Frank carried Fido back to his mistress, he thought it his duty to tell Mrs. Leroy of the attempt to abduct the favorite.  Mrs. Leroy turned pale.  \"Did the man actually take my little pet?\" she asked.  \"Yes, ma'am. He said it was his dog.\"  \"The horrid brute! How could I have lived without my darling?\" and the lady caressed her favorite tenderly. \"How did you prevent him?\"  \"I seized him by the arm, and held him till a policeman came up.\"  \"You are a brave boy,\" said Mrs. Leroy, admiringly. \"But for you, Fido would have been stolen.\"  \"The policeman said the man was a professional dog-stealer. He steals dogs for the reward which is offered.\"  \"I was sure I could trust you with my pet,\" said Mrs. Leroy. \"You deserve a reward yourself.\"  \"I was only doing my duty, ma'am,\" said Frank, modestly.  \"It isn't everybody that does that.\"  Mrs. Leroy rose, and, going to her bureau, drew an ivory portemonnaie from a small upper drawer; from this she extracted a two-dollar bill, and gave it to Frank.  \"This is too much,\" said Frank, surprised at the size of the gift.  \"Too much for rescuing my little pet? No, no, I am the best judge of that. I wouldn't have lost him for fifty times two dollars.\"  \"You are very liberal, and I am very much obliged to you,\" said Frank.  \"If I send again for a boy to take out Fido, I want you to come.\"  \"I will if I can, ma'am.\"  For several days, though Frank was employed on errands daily, there was nothing of an unusual character. About eleven o'clock one evening (for Frank had to take his turn at night work) he was sent to a house on West Thirty-eighth street. On arriving, he was ushered into the presence of a lady of middle age, whose anxious face betrayed the anxiety that she felt.  \"I have a son rather larger and older than you,\" she said, \"who, to my great sorrow, has been led away by evil companions, who have induced him to drink and play cards for money. I will not admit them into my house, but I cannot keep him from seeking them out. He is no doubt with them to-night.\"  Frank listened with respectful sympathy, and waited to hear what he was desired to do in the matter.  \"The boy's father is dead,\" continued Mrs. Vivian, with emotion, \"and I cannot fill his place. Fred is unwilling to obey his mother. His companions have persuaded him that it is unmanly.\"  \"I would gladly obey my mother if I could have her back,\" said Frank.  \"Is your mother dead, then?\" inquired Mrs. Vivian, with quick sympathy.  \"I have neither father nor mother,\" Frank answered gravely.  \"Poor boy! And yet you do not fall into temptation.\"  \"I have no time for that, ma'am; I have to earn my living.\"  \"If I could get Fred to take a position it might be a benefit to him,\" said Mrs. Vivian, thoughtfully. \"But the question now is, how I may be able to find him.\"  \"When did you see him last?\" asked Frank.  \"About three o'clock this afternoon I gave him seventy-five dollars, and sent him to pay a bill. I was perhaps imprudent to trust him with such a sum of money; but for a few days past he has been more steady than usual, and I thought it would show my confidence in him if I employed him in such a matter.\"  \"I should think it would, ma'am.\"  \"But I am afraid Fred fell in with some of his evil companions, and let them know that he was well provided with money. That would be enough to excite their cupidity.\"  \"Who are the companions you speak of?\" asked Frank.  \"Boys, or rather young men, for they are all older than Fred, of lower social rank than himself. I don't attach any special importance to that, nor do I object to them on that ground; but they are, I have reason to think, ill-bred and disreputable. They know Fred to be richer than themselves, and induce him to drink and play, in the hope of getting some of his money. I have sent for you to go in search of my son. If you find him you must do your best to bring him home.\"  \"I will,\" said Frank. \"Can you give me any idea where he may be found?\"  Mrs. Vivian wrote on a card two places,--one a billiard saloon, which she had reason to suspect that her son frequented.  \"Now,\" said Frank, \"will you be kind enough to describe your son to me, so that I may know him when I see him?\"  \"I will show you his photograph,\" said Mrs. Vivian.  She opened an album, and showed the picture of a boy of seventeen, with a pleasant face, fair complexion, and hair somewhat curly. His forehead was high, and he looked gentlemanly and refined.  \"Is he not good-looking?\" said the mother.  \"He looks like a gentleman,\" said Frank.  \"He would be one if he could throw off his evil associates. Do you think you will know him from the picture?\"  \"Yes, I think so. Is he tall?\"  \"Two or three inches taller than you are. You had better take the picture with you. I have an extra one, which you can put in your pocket to help you identify him. By the way, it will be as well that you should be supplied with money in case it is necessary to bring him home in a cab.\"  Frank understood what the mother found it difficult to explain. She feared that her boy might be the worse for drink.  She handed our hero a five-dollar bill.  \"I will use it prudently, madam,\" said he, \"and account to you for all I do not use.\"  \"I trust you wholly,\" said the lady. \"Now go as quickly as possible.\"  Frank looked at the two addresses he had on the card. The billiard-saloon was on the east side of the city, in an unfashionable locality.  \"I'll go there first,\" he decided.  Crossing to Third avenue he hailed a car, and rode down-town. His knowledge of the city, gained from the walks he took when a newsboy, made it easy for him to find the place of which he was in search. Though it was nearly midnight, the saloon was lighted up, and two tables were in use. On the left-hand side, as he entered, was a bar, behind which stood a man in his shirt-sleeves, who answered the frequent calls for drinks. He looked rather suspiciously at Frank's uniform when he entered.  \"What do you want?\" he asked. \"Have you any message for me?\"  \"No,\" said Frank, carelessly. \"Let me have a glass of lemonade.\"  The bar-keeper's face cleared instantly, and he set about preparing the beverage required.  \"Won't you have something in it?\" he asked.  \"No, sir,\" said Frank.  \"You boys are kept out pretty late,\" said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24018"],["title","The Golfer's Rubaiyat (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note: Each verse is contained within a full-page illustration, so the illustration tags within the text have been removed to avoid congestion.          *       *       *       *       *              The           Golfer's           Rubáiyát            [Illustration]              The           Golfer's           Rubáiyát                 The           Golfer's           Rubáiyát              by         H.W.

II    WAKE, Loiterer! for already Dawn is seen With her red marker on the eastern Green,   And summons all her Little Ones to change A joyous Three for every sad Thirteen.   III    AND as the Cock crew, those who stood before The first Tee murmur'd: \"Just this chance to score,   You know how little while we have to play, And, once departed, may return no more.\"   IV    NOW the fresh Year, reviving old Desires, The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,   Pores on this Club and That with anxious eye, And dreams of Rounds beyond the Rounds of Liars.   V    CAMPBELL indeed is past with all his Fame, And old Tom Morris now is but a name;   But many a Jamie by the Bunker blows, And many a Willie rules us, just the same.   VI    A THOUSAND lips are lockt; but still in hoar High-balling Andrew's Shrine, with \"Fore, fore, fore!   Oh, fore!\" the Golfer to the Duffer cries, That reddened cheek of his to redden more.   VII    COME, choose your Ball, and in the fire of Spring Your Red Coat, and your wooden Putter fling;   The Club of Time has but a little while To waggle, and the Club is on the swing.   VII    WHETHER at Musselburgh or Shinnecock, In motley Hose or humbler motley Sock,   The Cup of Life is ebbing Drop by Drop, Whether the Cup be filled with Scotch or Bock.   IX    EACH Morn a thousand Matches brings, you say; Yes, but who plays the Match of Yesterday?   And this first Summer month of opening Greens Shall take this Championship and That away.   X    WELL, let it take them! What have we to do With Championships, or, Champion, with you?   Let This or Other struggle as he will, For him alone the Strife--for him to rue.   XI    WITH me along the strip of sandy Down That just divides the Desert from the sown,   Where name of Shop and Study is forgot,-- And Peace to Croker on his golden Throne!   XII    A BAG of Clubs, a Silver-Town or two, A Flask of Scotch, a Pipe of Shag--and Thou   Beside me caddying in the Wilderness-- Ah, Wilderness were Paradise enow.   XIII    SOME for the weekly Handicap; and some Sigh for a greater Championship to come:   Ah, play the Match, and let the Medal go, Nor heed old Bogey with his wretched Sum.   XIV    LOOK to the blowing Rows about us--\"Lo, \"Strolling,\" they say, \"over the course we go,   \"And here or there we lightly flick the Ball, \"Turn, and the Trick is done--in So-and-so.\"   XV    BUT those who keep their Cards and turn them in, And those who weekly Handicaps may win,   Alike to no such aureate Fame are brought, As, buried once, Men want dug up again.   XVI    THE shining Cup men set their hearts upon Is lost to them--or won them; and anon,   Like a good Three set in a bald Three-score, That Glory gleams a moment--and is gone.   XVII    THINK, in this worn, forlorn old Field of Play, Whose Green-keepers in turn are Night and Day,   How Champion after Champion with his Pomp Abode his destin'd Hour and went his way.   XVIII    THEY say the Female and the Duffer strut On sacred Greens where Morris used to putt;   Himself a natural Hazard now, alas! That nice Hand quiet now, that great Eye shut.   XIX    I SOMETIMES think that never springs so green The Turf as where some Good Fellow has been,   And every emerald Stretch the Fair Green shows His kindly Tread has known, his sure Play seen.   XX    AND this reviving Herb whose tender green Muffles the fair white Sphere o'er which we lean,   Ah, curse it gently, for here Jamie once-- Great Jamie--lay, and fetch'd a bad Thirteen.   XXI    AH, my Belovéd, play the Round that offers TO-DAY some joy, whate'er To-morrow suffers:   To-morrow!--why, to-morrow I may be Myself with Yesterday's Sev'n thousand Duffers.   XXII    AND some we loved, the feeblest with a Club, Ordain'd to sclaff, to foozle, and to flub,   Have turned in Cards a Round or two before, And played that final Green without a Rub.   XXIII    AND we that now make merry on the Green They left, and Summer dresses in new sheen,   Ourselves must we beneath the springing Turf Add our Ell to the Bunker of Has-been.   XXIV    AH, make the most of what we yet may spend Before we too into the Dust descend;   Dust into dust, and under Dust to lie, Sans Breath, sans Golf, sans Golfer, and--sans End!   XXV    ALIKE for those who for TO-DAY prepare, And those who after some TO-MORROW stare,   A Keeper from the Links of Darkness cries Fools, your Reward is neither Here nor There.   XXVI    WHY, all the Toms and Jamies who discuss'd Of the True Art so wisely--they are thrust   Like foolish prophets forth; their Words to Scorn Are scatter'd, and their Mouths are stopt with Dust.   XXVII    MYSELF when young did eagerly frequent Jamie and His, and heard great argument   Of Grip and Stance and Swing; but evermore Found at the Exit but a Dollar spent.   XXVIII    WITH them the seed of Wisdom did I sow, And with mine own hand sought to make it grow;   And this was all the Harvest that I reap'd-- \"You hold it This Way, and you swing it So.\"   XXIX    PATIENT I fared to many a sacred Spot, Ev'n at the Shrine of Andrew cast my lot,   And many a Knot unravel'd by the Road; But not, alas! of Golf the Master-knot.   XXX    THERE was a Green for which I found no Tee, And a blind Bunker which I might not see:   Out of the distant Dark a Voice cries \"Fore!\" And then--and then no more of Thee and Me.   XXXI    AS then the Sparrow for his morning Crumb, Do thou each Morrow to the First Tee come,   And play thy quiet Round, till crusty Age Condemn thee to a hopeless Dufferdom.   XXXII    PERPLEXT no more with Where or How or Why, Thy easy fingers to the Shaft apply,   Content to send away a fair straight Ball, Though follow'd earthward by the naked Eye.   XXXIII    AND if the Ball you drive, the Shaft you press, End in what all begins and ends in--Yes;   Thank Heav'n you play TO-DAY as YESTERDAY You play'd--TO-MORROW you shall not do less.   XXXIV    GLAD if the Master of the Handicap At last shall find you come without Mishap,   Though without Glory, to turn in the Card He has expected of your sort of Chap.   XXXV    WHAT though a Fluke should fling your Class aside, And Best Gross be your momentary pride:   Are you a Golfer more than when last week You did YOUR best, and barely saved your Hide?   XXXVI    'TIS like a private Bar where for a Day Innumerable Rickies come your way,   Happy--but on the morrow happier far Had there been less to drink and more to pay.   XXXVII    AND fear not lest the Fair Green after your Ill-luck and mine should yield Bad Lies no more;   One or two Others may fare ill as you: Nay, even three, or maybe--maybe four.   XXXVIII    WHEN you and I our final Match have play'd, Think not the ever-springing Green shall fade;   Which of our Coming and Departure heeds As Caddies heed the Bag,--their Quarter paid.   XXXIX    A MOMENT'S Flight--a momentary Flick Of Being from the Providential Stick,   And Lo!--the phantom human Sphere has reacht The Nothing it set out from--Ah, be quick!   XL    WOULD you that Fillip of Existence spend About THE SECRET--quick about it, Friend!   A Hair perhaps divides the False and True, And upon what, prithee, does this Golf depend?   XLI    A HAIR perhaps divides the False and True, Yes, and a single Jamie were the Clue--   Could you but find him--to the Championship, And peradventure to the Champion too.   XLII    AND yet what matter who a Moment reigns? 'Tis not for such a Toy you take your pains;   To play the steady, simple, honest Game; That is the Joy and Credit that remains.   XLIII    BEHIND the uprisen Turf fair in the Ditch, To risk the Overhang, or play back--which   To do? Ah, Brother, let the Gallery go: Than tear the Web, better to drop a Stitch!   XLIV    TWO--Three--aye, better Golf we all have seen-- But--bravo! Four--a sweet Approach and Clean;   Steady, you still may well go down in Five: There are no Hazards on the Putting-Green.   XLV    WASTE not your Hour, nor try in vain to fix The How and Why--some wondrous Brew to mix;   Better be jocund with a calm Two-score Than sadden for a bitter Thirty-six.   XLVI    STRANGE, is it not?--that of the myriads who Into the Out-of-Bounds have late play'd through,   Not one returns to tell us of the Stroke To guarantee the shortest Hole in Two.   XLVII    THE Ball no question makes of Ayes and Noes, But Here or There as strikes the Player goes,   And ye who play behold the Ball fly clean, Or roll a Rod; but why? Who knows? Who knows?   XLVIII    THE swinging Brassie strikes; and, having struck, Moves on: nor all your Wit or future Luck   Shall lure it back to cancel half a Stroke, Nor from the Card a single Seven pluck.   XLIX    NO hope by Club or Ball to win the Prize: The batter'd, blacken'd Re-made sweetly flies,   Swept cleanly from the Tee; this is the truth: Nine-tenths is Skill, and all the rest is Lies.   L    AND that inverted Ball they call the High-- By which the Duffer thinks to live or die,   Lift not your hands to IT for help, for it As impotently froths as you or I.
