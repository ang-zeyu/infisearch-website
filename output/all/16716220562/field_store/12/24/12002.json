[_Sardanapale, Tragédie Imitée de Lord Byron_, par L. Alvin, was performed at the Théatre Royal at Brussels, January 13, 16, 1834.  _Sardanapalus_, a Tragedy, was played for the first time at Drury Lane Theatre, April 10, 1834, and (for the twenty-second time) June 5, 1834. Macready appeared as \"Sardanapalus,\" Miss Phillips as \"Zarina,\" and Miss Ellen Tree as \"Myrrha.\" [In his diary for April 11, 1834 (see _Reminiscences_, 1875, i. 414, 415) Macready wrote, \"On arriving at my chambers ... I found a letter without a signature; the seal was the head of Byron, and in the envelope was a folded sheet with merely the words, 'Werner, Nov., 1830. Byron, Ravenna, 1821,' and 'Sardanapalus, April 10th, 1834.' Encircling the name of Byron, etc., was a lock of grey hair fastened by a gold thread, which I am sure was Byron's, ... it surprised and pleased me.\"]  _Sardanapalus, King of Assyria_, was produced at the Princess's Theatre, June 13, 1853, and played till September 2, 1853. Charles Kean appeared as \"Sardanapalus,\" Miss Heath as \"Zarina,\" and Mrs. Charles Kean as \"Myrrha.\"  _Sardanapale, Opéra en Trois Actes_, par M. Henry Becque, Musique de M. Victorin Joncières, was performed for the first time at the Théatre Impérial-Lyrique, February 8, 1867.  _Lord Byron's Tragedy of Sardanapalus_, in four acts, was performed at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, March 31-April 28, 1877. Charles Calvert (the adapter) played \"Sardanapalus,\" Miss Hathaway \"Zarina,\" and Miss Fanny Ensor \"Myrrha;\" and June 26-July 27, 1877, at the Royal Alexandra Theatre, Liverpool. Calvert's adaptation was also performed at Booth's Theatre, New York.]                           INTRODUCTION TO _SARDANAPALUS_   Byron's passion or infatuation for the regular drama lasted a little over a year. _Marino Faliero_, _Sardanapalus_, and the _Two Foscari_, were the fruits of his \"self-denying ordinance to dramatize, like the Greeks ... striking passages of history\" (letter to Murray, July 14, 1821, _Letters_, 1901, v. 323). The mood was destined to pass, but for a while the neophyte was spell-bound.  _Sardanapalus, a Tragedy_, the second and, perhaps, the most successful of these studies in the poetry of history, was begun at Ravenna, January 13, 1821, \"with all deliberate speed;\" but, for a time, from laziness or depression of spirits, or, perhaps, from the counter-excitement of \"the poetry of politics\" (_Letters_, 1901, v. 205), that is, the revolutionary drama which had begun to run its course, a month went by before he had finished the first act (February 15). Three months later (May 28) he announces the completion of the drama, the last act having been \"dashed off\" in two or three days (_Letters_, 1901, v. 300).  For the story of Sardanapalus, which had excited his interest as a schoolboy, Byron consulted the pages of Diodorus Siculus (_Bibliothecæ Historicæ_, lib. ii. pp. 78, sq., ed. 1604), and, possibly to ward off and neutralize the distracting influence of Shakespeare and other barbarian dramatists, he \"turned over\" the tragedies of Seneca (_Letters_, 1901, v. 173). It is hardly necessary to remind the modern reader that the Sardanapalus of history is an unverified if not an unverifiable personage. Diodorus the Sicilian, who was contemporary with Cicero, derived his knowledge of Assyrian history from the _Persica_ of Ctesias of Cnidos, who was private physician at the court of Artaxerxes Mnemon (B.C. 405-359), and is said to have had access to, and to have consulted, the \"Persian authorities\" (διφθέραι Βασιλικαὶ [diphthe/rai Basilikai\\]).  The character which Ctesias depicted or invented, an effeminate debauchee, sunk in luxury and sloth, who at the last was driven to take up arms, and, after a prolonged but ineffectual resistance, avoided capture by suicide, cannot be identified. Asurbanipal (Ašur-bāni-apli), the son of Esarhaddon and grandson of Sennacherib, who ascended the throne B.C. 668, and reigned for about forty years, was, as the cuneiform records and the friezes of his palace testify, a bold hunter and a mighty warrior. He vanquished Tarkū (Tirhakah) of Ethiopia, and his successor, Urdamanē. Ba'al King of Tyre, Yakinlū King of the island-city of Arvad, Sandăsarmū of Cilicia, Teumman of Elam, and other potentates, suffered defeat at his hands. \"The land of Elam,\" writes the king or his \"Historiographer Royal,\" \"through its extent I covered as when a mighty storm approaches; I cut off the head of Teumman, their king... Beyond number I slew his warriors; alive in my hands I took his fighting men; with their corpses, as with thorns and thistles, I filled the vicinity of Susa; their blood I caused to flow in the Eulæus, and I stained its waters like wool.\" Clearly the Sardanapalus who painted his face and carded purple wool in the _penetralia_ of his seraglio does not bear even a traditional resemblance to Ašur-bāni-apli the Conqueror.  All that can be affirmed with any certainty is that within twenty years of the death of Asurbanipal, the Assyrian Empire passed into the hands of the Medes;[1] but there is nothing to show whether the period of decay had already set in before the close of his reign, or under which of his two successors, Ăsur-etil-ilāni or Sin-šar-iškun, the final catastrophe (B.C. 606) took place (_Encyclopedia Biblica_, art. \"Assyria,\" art. \"Ăsur-bani-pal,\" by Leonard W. King).  \"I have made,\" writes Byron (May 25, 1821), \"Sardanapalus brave though voluptuous (as history represents him), and as amiable as my poor pen could make him.\" Diodorus, or rather Ctesias, who may have drawn upon personal reminiscences of his patron, Artaxerxes Mnemon (see Plutarch's _Artaxerxes_, _passim_), does not enlarge upon his amiability, and credits him only with the courage of despair. Byron's Sardanapalus, with his sudden transition from voluptuous abandonment to heroic chivalry, his remorseful recognition of the sanctities of wedlock, his general good nature, his \"sly, insinuating sarcasms\" (Moore's Diary, September 30, 1821, _Memoirs_, iii. 282), \"all made out of the carver's brain,\" resembles _history_ as little as _history_ resembles the Assyrian record. Fortunately, the genius of the poet escaped from the meshes which he had woven round himself, and, in spite of himself, he was constrained to \"beat his music out,\" regardless of his authorities.  The character of Myrrha, which bears some resemblance to Aspasia, \"a native of Phocea in Ionia--the favourite mistress of Cyrus\" (see Plutarch's _Artaxerxes_, Langhorne's Translation, 1838, p. 699), was introduced partly to pacify the Countess Guiccioli, who had quarrelled with him for maintaining that \"love was not the loftiest theme for true tragedy,\" and, in part, to prove that he was not a slave to his own ideals, and could imagine and delineate a woman who was both passionate and high-minded. Diodorus (_Bibl. Hist._, lib. iii. p. 130) records the exploits of Myrina, Queen of the Amazons, but it is probable that Byron named his Ionian slave after Mirra, who gives her name to Alfieri's tragedy, which brought on a convulsive fit of tears and shuddering when he first saw it played at Bologna in August, 1819 (_Letters_, 1900, iv. 339).  _Sardanapalus, a Tragedy_, was published together with _The Two Foscari, a Tragedy_, and _Cain, a Mystery_, December 19, 1821.  The three plays were reviewed by Heber in the _Quarterly Review_, July, 1822, vol. xxvii. pp. 476-524; by Jeffrey in the _Edinburgh Review_, February, 1822, vol. 36, pp. 413-452; in _Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine_, February, 1822, vol. xi. pp. 212-217; and in the _Portfolio_ (Philadelphia), December, 1822, vol. xiv. pp. 487-492.

On the attempt made by the managers in a former instance, the public opinion has been already expressed. With regard to my own private feelings, as it seems that they are to stand for nothing, I shall say nothing.  For the historical foundation of the following compositions the reader is referred to the Notes.  The Author has in one instance attempted to preserve, and in the other to approach, the \"unities;\" conceiving that with any very distant departure from them, there may be poetry, but can be no drama. He is aware of the unpopularity of this notion in present English literature; but it is not a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23475"],["title","The Works of Lord Byron.

But \"nous avons changé tout cela,\" and are reaping the advantages of the change. The writer is far from conceiving that any thing he can adduce by personal precept or example can at all approach his regular, or even irregular predecessors: he is merely giving a reason why he preferred the more regular formation of a structure, however feeble, to an entire abandonment of all rules whatsoever. Where he has failed, the failure is in the architect,--and not in the art.  In this tragedy it has been my intention to follow the account of Diodorus Siculus;[4] reducing it, however, to such dramatic regularity as I best could, and trying to approach the unities. I therefore suppose the rebellion to explode and succeed in one day by a sudden conspiracy, instead of the long war of the history.

SARDANAPALUS.[5]                                     ACT I.                       SCENE I.--_A Hall in the Palace_.       _Salemenes_ (_solus_).     He hath wronged his queen, but still he is her lord;     He hath wronged my sister--still he is my brother;     He hath wronged his people--still he is their sovereign--     And I must be his friend as well as subject:     He must not perish thus. I will not see     The blood of Nimrod and Semiramis     Sink in the earth, and thirteen hundred years     Of Empire ending like a shepherd's tale;     He must be roused. In his effeminate heart     There is a careless courage which Corruption                        10     Has not all quenched, and latent energies,     Repressed by circumstance, but not destroyed--     Steeped, but not drowned, in deep voluptuousness.     If born a peasant, he had been a man     To have reached an empire: to an empire born,     He will bequeath none; nothing but a name,     Which his sons will not prize in heritage:--     Yet--not all lost--even yet--he may redeem     His sloth and shame, by only being that     Which he should be, as easily as the thing                          20     He should not be and is. Were it less toil     To sway his nations than consume his life?     To head an army than to rule a harem?     He sweats in palling pleasures, dulls his soul,[a]     And saps his goodly strength, in toils which yield not     Health like the chase, nor glory like the war--     He must be roused. Alas! there is no sound                                  [_Sound of soft music heard from within_.     To rouse him short of thunder. Hark! the lute--     The lyre--the timbrel; the lascivious tinklings     Of lulling instruments, the softening voices                        30     Of women, and of beings less than women,     Must chime in to the echo of his revel,     While the great King of all we know of earth     Lolls crowned with roses, and his diadem     Lies negligently by to be caught up     By the first manly hand which dares to snatch it.     Lo, where they come! already I perceive     The reeking odours of the perfumed trains,     And see the bright gems of the glittering girls,[b]     At once his Chorus and his Council, flash                           40     Along the gallery, and amidst the damsels,     As femininely garbed, and scarce less female,     The grandson of Semiramis, the Man-Queen.--     He comes! Shall I await him? yes, and front him,     And tell him what all good men tell each other,     Speaking of him and his. They come, the slaves     Led by the monarch subject to his slaves.                                   SCENE II.             _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _effeminately dressed, his Head          crowned with Flowers, and his Robe negligently flowing,              attended by a Train of Women and young Slaves_.      _Sar._ (_speaking to some of his attendants_).     Let the pavilion[6] over the Euphrates     Be garlanded, and lit, and furnished forth     For an especial banquet; at the hour     Of midnight we will sup there: see nought wanting,     And bid the galley be prepared. There is     A cooling breeze which crisps the broad clear river:     We will embark anon. Fair Nymphs, who deign     To share the soft hours of Sardanapalus,     We'll meet again in that the sweetest hour,     When we shall gather like the stars above us,                       10     And you will form a heaven as bright as theirs;     Till then, let each be mistress of her time,     And thou, my own Ionian Myrrha,[7] choose;     Wilt thou along with them or me?      _Myr._                          My Lord--      _Sar._ My Lord!--my Life! why answerest thou so coldly?     It is the curse of kings to be so answered.     Rule thy own hours, thou rulest mine--say, wouldst thou     Accompany our guests, or charm away     The moments from me?      _Myr._              The King's choice is mine.      _Sar._ I pray thee say not so: my chiefest joy                      20     Is to contribute to thine every wish.     I do not dare to breathe my own desire,     Lest it should clash with thine; for thou art still     Too prompt to sacrifice thy thoughts for others.      _Myr._ I would remain: I have no happiness     Save in beholding thine; yet--      _Sar._                         Yet! what YET?     Thy own sweet will shall be the only barrier     Which ever rises betwixt thee and me.      _Myr._ I think the present is the wonted hour     Of council; it were better I retire.                                30      _Sal._ (_comes forward and says_)     The Ionian slave says well: let her retire.      _Sar._ Who answers? How now, brother?      _Sal._                               The _Queen's_ brother,     And your most faithful vassal, royal Lord.      _Sar._ (_addressing his train_).     As I have said, let all dispose their hours     Till midnight, when again we pray your presence.                                                     [_The court retiring_.     (_To_ MYRRHA,[c] _who is going_.)     Myrrha! I thought _thou_ wouldst remain.      _Myr._                                  Great King,     Thou didst not say so.      _Sar._                 But _thou_ looked'st it:     I know each glance of those Ionic eyes,[d]     Which said thou wouldst not leave me.      _Myr._                               Sire! your brother----      _Sal._ His _Consort's_ brother, minion of Ionia!                    40     How darest _thou_ name _me_ and not blush?      _Sar._                                    Not blush!     Thou hast no more eyes than heart to make her crimson     Like to the dying day on Caucasus,     Where sunset tints the snow with rosy shadows,     And then reproach her with thine own cold blindness,     Which will not see it. What! in tears, my Myrrha?      _Sal._ Let them flow on; she weeps for more than one,     And is herself the cause of bitterer tears.      _Sar._ Curséd be he who caused those tears to flow!      _Sal._ Curse not thyself--millions do that already.                 50      _Sar._ Thou dost forget thee: make me not remember     I am a monarch.      _Sal._          Would thou couldst!      _Myr._                               My sovereign,     I pray, and thou, too, Prince, permit my absence.      _Sar._ Since it must be so, and this churl has checked     Thy gentle spirit, go; but recollect     That we must forthwith meet: I had rather lose     An empire than thy presence.                           [_Exit_ MYRRHA.      _Sal._                       It may be,     Thou wilt lose both--and both for ever!      _Sar._                                  Brother!     I can at least command myself, who listen     To language such as this: yet urge me not                           60     Beyond my easy nature.      _Sal._                 'Tis beyond     That easy--far too easy--idle nature,     Which I would urge thee. O that I could rouse thee!     Though 'twere against myself.      _Sar._                        By the god Baal!     The man would make me tyrant.      _Sal._                        So thou art.     Think'st thou there is no tyranny but that     Of blood and chains? The despotism of vice,     The weakness and the wickedness of luxury,     The negligence, the apathy, the evils     Of sensual sloth--produce ten thousand tyrants,                     70     Whose delegated cruelty surpasses     The worst acts of one energetic master,     However harsh and hard in his own bearing.     The false and fond examples of thy lusts     Corrupt no less than they oppress, and sap     In the same moment all thy pageant power     And those who should sustain it; so that whether     A foreign foe invade, or civil broil     Distract within, both will alike prove fatal:     The first thy subjects have no heart to conquer;                    80     The last they rather would assist than vanquish.      _Sar._ Why, what makes thee the mouth-piece of the people?      _Sal._ Forgiveness of the Queen, my sister wrongs;     A natural love unto my infant nephews;     Faith to the King, a faith he may need shortly,     In more than words; respect for Nimrod's line;     Also, another thing thou knowest not.      _Sar._ What's that?      _Sal._              "]]]
