I have already explained the relationship in which I stood to the Tregennis family. For the sake of the sister I was friendly with the brothers.  There was a family quarrel about money which estranged this man Mortimer, but it was supposed to be made up, and I afterwards met him as I did the others.  He was a sly, subtle, scheming man, and several things arose which gave me a suspicion of him, but I had no cause for any positive quarrel.  \"One day, only a couple of weeks ago, he came down to my cottage and I showed him some of my African curiosities.  Among other things I exhibited this powder, and I told him of its strange properties, how it stimulates those brain centres which control the emotion of fear, and how either madness or death is the fate of the unhappy native who is subjected to the ordeal by the priest of his tribe.  I told him also how powerless European science would be to detect it.  How he took it I cannot say, for I never left the room, but there is no doubt that it was then, while I was opening cabinets and stooping to boxes, that he managed to abstract some of the devil's-foot root.  I well remember how he plied me with questions as to the amount and the time that was needed for its effect, but I little dreamed that he could have a personal reason for asking.  \"I thought no more of the matter until the vicar's telegram reached me at Plymouth.  This villain had thought that I would be at sea before the news could reach me, and that I should be lost for years in Africa. But I returned at once.  Of course, I could not listen to the details without feeling assured that my poison had been used.  I came round to see you on the chance that some other explanation had suggested itself to you.  But there could be none.  I was convinced that Mortimer Tregennis was the murderer; that for the sake of money, and with the idea, perhaps, that if the other members of his family were all insane he would be the sole guardian of their joint property, he had used the devil's-foot powder upon them, driven two of them out of their senses, and killed his sister Brenda, the one human being whom I have ever loved or who has ever loved me.  There was his crime; what was to be his punishment?  \"Should I appeal to the law?  Where were my proofs?  I knew that the facts were true, but could I help to make a jury of countrymen believe so fantastic a story?  I might or I might not. But I could not afford to fail.  My soul cried out for revenge. I have said to you once before, Mr. Holmes, that I have spent much of my life outside the law, and that I have come at last to be a law to myself.  So it was even now.  I determined that the fate which he had given to others should be shared by himself. Either that or I would do justice upon him with my own hand.  In all England there can be no man who sets less value upon his own life than I do at the present moment.  \"Now I have told you all.  You have yourself supplied the rest. I did, as you say, after a restless night, set off early from my cottage.  I foresaw the difficulty of arousing him, so I gathered some gravel from the pile which you have mentioned, and I used it to throw up to his window.  He came down and admitted me through the window of the sitting-room.  I laid his offence before him. I told him that I had come both as judge and executioner.  The wretch sank into a chair, paralyzed at the sight of my revolver. I lit the lamp, put the powder above it, and stood outside the window, ready to carry out my threat to shoot him should he try to leave the room.  In five minutes he died. My God! how he died!  But my heart was flint, for he endured nothing which my innocent darling had not felt before him.  There is my story, Mr. Holmes.  Perhaps, if you loved a woman, you would have done as much yourself.  At any rate, I am in your hands.  You can take what steps you like.  As I have already said, there is no man living who can fear death less than I do.\"  Holmes sat for some little time in silence.  \"What were your plans?\" he asked at last.  \"I had intended to bury myself in central Africa.  My work there is but half finished.\"  \"Go and do the other half,\" said Holmes.  \"I, at least, am not prepared to prevent you.\"  Dr. Sterndale raised his giant figure, bowed gravely, and walked from the arbour.  Holmes lit his pipe and handed me his pouch.  \"Some fumes which are not poisonous would be a welcome change,\" said he.  \"I think you must agree, Watson, that it is not a case in which we are called upon to interfere.  Our investigation has been independent, and our action shall be so also.  You would not denounce the man?\"  \"Certainly not,\" I answered.  \"I have never loved, Watson, but if I did and if the woman I loved had met such an end, I might act even as our lawless lion-hunter has done. Who knows?  Well, Watson, I will not offend your intelligence by explaining what is obvious.  The gravel upon the window-sill was, of course, the starting-point of my research.  It was unlike anything in the vicarage garden.  Only when my attention had been drawn to Dr. Sterndale and his cottage did I find its counterpart.  The lamp shining in broad daylight and the remains of powder upon the shield were successive links in a fairly obvious chain.  And now, my dear Watson, I think we may dismiss the matter from our mind and go back with a clear conscience to the study of those Chaldean roots which are surely to be traced in the Cornish branch of the great Celtic speech.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23492"],["title","Fast in the Ice: Adventures in the Polar Regions (#0)"],["body","in the Ice, Adventures in the Polar Regions, by R.M. Ballantyne.  ________________________________________________________________________ This little book describes a visit up to the Arctic regions, that was supposed to have taken place long before the book was written, in other words in the early part of the nineteenth century.  The purpose of the journey was to get near to the North Pole, which was considered to be surrounded by a large area of ice-free water. The vessel in which they sailed became beset by ice, and could not be moved.  They met with Esquimaux, and saw how they survived, how they killed walrus, how they caught birds, and how they lived in their ice-houses, or igloos.  They also had several encounters with polar bears, and musk-ox.  Eventually they have been in the ice for a couple of years, and some of the men are suffering from scurvy.  Europeans get scurvy from lack of fruit and vegetables, but this condition doesn't seem to affect the Esquimaux, whose meat and fat diet does not cause them to have heart disorders, either.  The crew eventually abandon the vessel, which has been crushed suddenly and totally by a stream of ice-floes, and are obliged to walk out of where they had spent so much time.  Luckily, when at their last gasp, they find an Esquimaux village, where they learn that there is a Danish settlement not too far away, and that from it they can take ship for Europe, and eventually make their way back to Britain.  ________________________________________________________________________ FAST IN THE ICE, ADVENTURES IN THE POLAR REGIONS, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  One day, many years ago, a brig cast off from her moorings, and sailed from a British port for the Polar Seas.  That brig never came back.  Many a hearty cheer was given, many a kind wish was uttered, many a handkerchief was waved, and many a tearful eye gazed that day as the vessel left Old England, and steered her course into the unknown regions of the far north.  But no cheer ever greeted her return; no bright eyes ever watched her homeward-bound sails rising on the far-off horizon.  Battered by the storms of the Arctic seas, her sails and cordage stiffened by the frosts, and her hull rasped and shattered by the ice of those regions, she was forced on a shore where the green grass has little chance to grow, where winter reigns nearly all the year round, where man never sends his merchandise, and never drives his plough. There the brig was frozen in; there, for two long years, she lay unable to move, and her starving crew forsook her; there, year after year, she lay, unknown, unvisited by civilised man, and unless the wild Eskimos [see note 1] have torn her to pieces, and made spears of her timbers, or the ice has swept her out to sea and whirled her to destruction, there she lies still--hard and fast in the ice.  The vessel was lost, but her crew were saved, and most of them returned to tell their kinsfolk of the wonders and the dangers of the frozen regions, where God has created some of the most beautiful and some of the most awful objects that were ever looked on by the eye of man.  What was told by the fireside, long ago, is now recounted in this book.  Imagine a tall, strong man, of about five-and-forty, with short, curly black hair, just beginning to turn grey; stern black eyes, that look as if they could pierce into your secret thoughts; a firm mouth, with lines of good-will and kindness lurking about it; a deeply-browned skin, and a short, thick beard and moustache.  That is a portrait of the commander of the brig.  His name was Harvey.  He stood on the deck, close by the wheel, looking wistfully over the stern.  As the vessel bent before the breeze, and cut swiftly through the water, a female hand was raised among the gazers on the pier, and a white scarf waved in the breeze.  In the forefront of the throng, and lower down, another hand was raised; it was a little one, but very vigorous; it whirled a cap round a small head of curly black hair, and a shrill \"hurrah!\" came floating out to sea.  The captain kissed his hand and waved his hat in reply; then, wheeling suddenly round, he shouted, in a voice of thunder:  \"Mind your helm, there; let her away a point.  Take a pull on these foretopsail halyards; look alive, lads!\"  \"Aye, aye, sir!\" replied the men.  There was no occasion whatever for these orders.  The captain knew that well enough, but he had his own reasons for giving them.  The men knew that, too, and they understood his reasons when they observed the increased sternness of his eyes, and the compression of his lips.  Inclination and duty!  What wars go on in the hearts of men--high and low, rich and poor--between these two.  What varied fortune follows man, according as the one or the other carries the day.  \"Please, sir,\" said a gruff, broad-shouldered, and extremely short man, with little or no forehead, a hard, vacant face, and a pair of enormous red whispers; \"please, sir, Sam Baker's took very bad; I think it would be as well if you could give him a little physic, sir; a tumbler of Epsom, or some-think of that sort.\"  \"Why, Mr Dicey, there can't be anything very far wrong with Baker,\" said the captain, looking down at his second mate; \"he seems to me one of the healthiest men in the ship.  What's the matter with him?\"  \"Well, I can't say, sir,\" replied Mr Dicey, \"but he looks 'orrible bad, all yellow and green about the gills, and fearful red round the eyes. But what frightens me most is that I heard him groanin' very heavy about a quarter of an hour ago, and then I saw him suddenly fling himself into his 'ammock and begin blubberin' like a child.  Now, sir, I say, when a grow'd-up man gives way like that, there must be some-think far wrong with his inside.  And it's a serious thing, sir, to take a sick man on such a voyage as this.\"  \"Does he not say what's wrong with him?\" asked the captain.  \"No, sir; he don't.  He says it's nothin', and he'll be all right if he's only let alone.  I did hear him once or twice muttering some-think about his wife and child; you know, sir, he's got a young wife, and she had a baby about two months 'fore we came away, but I can't think that's got much to do with it, for _I've_ got a wife myself, sir, and six children, two of 'em bein' babies, and that don't upset _me_, and Baker's a much stronger man.\"  \"You are right, Mr Dicey, he is a much stronger man than you,\" replied the captain, \"and I doubt not that his strength will enable him to get over this without the aid of physic.\"  \"Very well, sir,\" said Mr Dicey.  The second mate was a man whose countenance never showed any signs of emotion, no matter what he felt.  He seldom laughed, or, if he did, his mouth remained almost motionless, and the sounds that came out were anything but cheerful.  He had light grey eyes which always wore an expression of astonishment; but the expression was accidental; it indicated no feeling.  He would have said, \"Very well, sir,\" if the captain had refused to give poor Baker food instead of physic.  \"And hark'ee, Mr Dicey,\" said the captain, \"don't let him be disturbed till he feels inclined to move.\"  \"Very well, sir,\" replied the second mate, touching his cap as he turned away.  \"So,\" murmured the captain, as he gazed earnestly at the now distant shore, \"I'm not the only one who carries a heavy heart to sea this day and leaves sorrowing hearts behind him.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note 1.  This word is here spelled as pronounced.  It is usually spelled Esquimaux.    CHAPTER TWO.  AT SEA--THE FIRST STORM.  It is now hundreds of years since the North polar regions began to attract general attention.  Men have long felt very inquisitive about that part of the earth, and many good ships, many noble lives have been lost in trying to force a passage through the ice that encumbers the Arctic seas, summer and winter.  Britain has done more than other nations in the cause of discovery within the Arctic circle.  The last and greatest of her Arctic heroes perished there--the famous Sir John Franklin.  Were I writing a history of those regions I would have much to say of other countries as well as of our own.  But such is not my object in this book.  I mean simply to follow in the wake of one of Britain's adventurous discoverers, and thus give the reader an idea of the fortunes of those gallant men who risk life and limb for the sake of obtaining knowledge of distant lands.  There have always been restless spirits in this country.  There have ever been men who, when boys, were full of mischief, and who could \"settle to nothing\" when they grew up.  Lucky for us, lucky for the world, that such is the case!  Many of our \"restless spirits,\" as we call them, have turned out to be our heroes, our discoverers, our greatest men.  No doubt many of them have become our drones, our sharpers, our blacklegs.  But that is just saying that some men are good, while others are bad--no blame is due to what is called the restlessness of spirit.  Our restless men, if good, find rest in action; in bold energetic toil; if bad, they find rest, alas! in untimely graves.  Captain Harvey was one of our restless spirits.  He had a deeply learned friend who said to him one day that he felt sure \"_there was a sea of open water round the North Pole_!\"  Hundreds of ships had tried to reach that pole without success, because they always found a barrier of thick ice raised against them.  This friend said that if a ship could only cut or force its way through the ice to a certain latitude north, open water would be found.  Captain Harvey was much interested in this.  He could not rest until he had proved it.  He had plenty of money, so had his friend.  They resolved to buy a vessel and send it to the seas lying within the Arctic circle.  Other rich friends helped them; a brig was bought, it was named the _Hope_, and, as we have seen in the last chapter, it"]]]
