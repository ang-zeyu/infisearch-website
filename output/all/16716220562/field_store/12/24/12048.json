MR SUDBERRY IN HIS COUNTING-HOUSE.  Mr John Sudberry was a successful London merchant.  He was also a fat little man.  Moreover, he was a sturdy little man, wore spectacles, and had a smooth bald head, over which, at the time we introduce him to the reader, fifty summers had passed, with their corresponding autumns, winters, and springs.  The passage of so many seasons over him appeared to have exercised a polishing influence on the merchant, for Mr Sudberry's cranium shone like a billiard-ball.  In temperament Mr Sudberry was sanguine, and full of energy.  He could scarcely have been a successful merchant without these qualities.  He was also extremely violent.  Now, it is necessary here to guard the reader from falling into a mistake in reference to Mr Sudberry's character.  We have said that he was violent, but it must not be supposed that he was _passionate_.  By no means.  He was the most amiable and sweet-tempered of men.  His violence was owing to physical rather than mental causes.  He was hasty in his volitions, impulsive in his actions, madly reckless in his personal movements.  His moral and physical being was capable of only two conditions--deep repose or wild activity.  At his desk Mr Sudberry was wont to sit motionless like a statue, with his face buried in his hands and his thoughts busy.  When these thoughts culminated, he would start as if he had received an electric shock, seize a pen, and, with pursed lips and frowning brows, send it careering over the paper with harrowing rapidity, squeaking and chirping, (the pen, not the man), like a small bird with a bad cold.  Mr Sudberry used quills.  He was a _tremendous_ writer.  He could have reported the debates of the \"House\" in long-hand.  The merchant's portrait is not yet finished.  He was a peculiar man, and men of this sort cannot be sketched off in a few lines.  Indeed, had he not been a peculiar man, it would not have been worth while to drag him thus prominently into notice.  Among other peculiarities in Mr Sudberry's character, he was afflicted with a chronic tendency to _dab_ his pen into the ink-bottle and split it to the feather, or double up its point so as to render it unserviceable.  This infirmity, coupled with an uncommon capacity for upsetting ink-bottles, had induced him to hire a small clerk, whose principal duties were to mend pens, wipe up ink, and, generally, to attend to the removal of _debris_.  When Mr Sudberry slept he did it profoundly.  When he awoke he did it with a start and a stare, as if amazed at having caught himself in the very act of indulging in such weakness.  When he washed he puffed, and gasped, and rubbed, and made such a noise, that one might have supposed a walrus was engaged in its ablutions.  How the skin of his head, face, and neck stood the towelling it received is incomprehensible!  When he walked he went like an express train; when he sauntered he relapsed into the slowest possible snail's-pace, but he did not graduate the changes from one to the other.  When he sat down he did so with a crash.  The number of chairs which Mr Sudberry broke in the course of his life would have filled a goodly-sized concert-room; and the number of tea-cups which he had swept off tables with the tails of his coat might, we believe, have set up a moderately ambitious man in the china trade.  There was always a beaming smile on the merchant's countenance, except when he was engaged in deep thought; then his mouth was pursed and his brows knitted.  The small clerk was a thin-bodied, weak-minded, timid boy, of about twelve years of age and of humble origin.  He sat at Mr Sudberry's double desk in the office, opposite and in dangerous proximity to his master, whom he regarded with great admiration, alarm, and awe.  On a lovely afternoon towards the middle of May, when city men begin to thirst for a draught of fresh air, and to long for an undignified roll on the green fields among primroses, butter-cups, and daisies, Mr Sudberry sat at his desk reading the advertisements in the _Times_.  Suddenly he flung the paper away, hit the desk a sounding blow with his clinched fist, and exclaimed firmly--  \"I'll do it!\"  Accustomed though he was to nervous shocks, the small clerk leaped with more than ordinary tremor off his stool on this occasion, picked up the paper, laid it at his master's elbow, and sat down again, prepared to look out--nautically speaking--for more squalls.  Mr Sudberry seized a quill, dabbed it into the ink-bottle, and split it.  Seizing another he dabbed again; the quill stood the shock; the small clerk ventured a sigh of relief and laid aside the inky napkin which he had pulled out of his desk expecting an upset, and prepared for the worst.  A note was dashed off in two minutes,--signed, sealed, addressed, in half a minute, and Mr Sudberry leaped off his stool.  His hat was thrown on his head by a species of sleight of hand, and he appeared in the outer office suddenly, like a stout Jack-in-the-box.  \"I'm away, Mr Jones,\" (to his head clerk), \"and won't be back till eleven to-morrow morning.  Have you the letters ready?  I am going round by the post-office, and will take charge of them.\"  \"They are here, sir,\" said Mr Jones, in a mild voice.  Mr Jones was a meek man, with a red nose and a humble aspect.  He was a confidential clerk, and much respected by the firm of Sudberry and Company.  In fact, it was generally understood that the business could not get on without him.  His caution was a most salutary counteractive to Mr Sudberry's recklessness.  As for \"Co,\" he was a sleeping partner, and an absolute nonentity.  Mr Sudberry seized the letters and let them fall, picked them up in haste, thrust them confusedly into his pocket, and rushed from the room, knocking over the umbrella-stand in his exit.  The sensation left in the office was that of a dead calm after a sharp squall.  The small clerk breathed freely, and felt that his life was safe for that day.    STORY ONE, CHAPTER 2.  MR SUDBERRY AT HOME.  \"My dear,\" cried Mr Sudberry to his wife, abruptly entering the parlour of his villa, near Hampstead Heath, \"I have done the deed!\"  \"Dear John, you _are_ so violent; my nerves--really--_what_ deed?\" said Mrs Sudberry, a weak-eyed, delicate woman, of languid temperament, and not far short of her husband's age.  \"I have written off to secure a residence in the Highlands of Scotland for our summer quarters this season.\"  Mrs Sudberry stared in mute surprise.  \"John! my dear! are you in earnest?  Have you not been precipitate in this matter?  You know, love, that I have always trusted in your prudence to make arrangements for the spending of our holiday; but really, when I think--\"  \"Well, my dear, `When you think,'--pray, go on.\"  \"Don't be hasty, dear John; you know I have never objected to any place you have hitherto fixed on.  Herne Bay last year was charming, and the year before we enjoyed Margate _so_ much.  Even Worthing, though rather too long a journey for a family, was delightful; and, as the family was smaller then, we got over the journey on the whole better than could have been expected.  But Scotland!--the Highlands!\"--Mr Sudberry's look at this point induced his wife to come to a full stop.  The look was not a stern look,--much less a savage look, as connubial looks sometimes are.  It was an aggrieved look; not that he was aggrieved at the dubious reception given by his spouse to the arrangement he had made;--no, the sore point in his mind was that he himself entertained strong doubts, as to the propriety of what he had done; and to find these doubts reflected in the mind of his faithful better half was perplexing.  \"Well, Mary,\" said the worthy merchant, \"go on.  Do you state the _cons_, and I'll enumerate the _pros_, after which we will close the account, and see on which side the balance lies.\"  \"You know, dear,\" said Mrs Sudberry, in a remonstrative tone, \"that the journey is fearfully long.  I almost tremble when I think of it.  To be sure, we have the railroad to Edinburgh now; but beyond that we shall have to travel by stage, I suppose, at least I hope so; but perhaps they have no stage-coaches in Scotland?\"  \"Oh, yes, they have a few, I believe,\" replied the merchant, with a smile.  \"Ah! that is fortunate; for wagons are fearfully trying.  No, I really think that I could _not_ stand a wagon journey after my experience of the picnic at Worthing some years ago.  Think of our large family--seven of us altogether--in a wagon, John--\"  \"But you forget, I said that there _are_ stage-coaches in Scotland.\"  \"Well; but think of the slow and wearisome travelling among great mountains, over precipices, and through Scotch mists.  Lady Knownothing assures me she has been told that the rain never ceases in Scotland, except for a short time in autumn, just to give the scanty crops time to ripen.  You know, dear, that our darling Jacky's health could never stand the Scotch mists, he is so _very_, delicate.\"  \"Why, Mary!\" exclaimed Mr Sudberry, abruptly; \"the doctor told me only yesterday that for a boy of five years old he was a perfect marvel of robust health--that nothing ailed him, except the result of over-eating and the want of open-air exercise; and I am sure that I can testify to the strength of his legs and the soundness of his lungs; for he kicks like a jackass, and roars like a lion.\"  \"It is _very_ wrong, _very_ sinful of the doctor,\" said Mrs Sudberry, in a languidly indignant manner, \"to give such a false report of the health of our darling boy.\"  At this moment the door burst open, and the \"darling boy\" rushed into the room--with a wild cheer of defiance at his nurse, from whom he had escaped, and who was in full pursuit--hit his head on the corner of the table, and fell flat on the floor, with a yell that might have sent a pang of jealousy to the heart of a Chippeway Indian!  Mr Sudberry started up, and almost overturned"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23505"],["title","Freaks on the Fells: Three Months' Rustication (#1)"],["body","tea-table in his haste; but before he could reach his prostrate son, nurse had him kicking in her arms, and carried him off howling.  \"Darling child!\" said Mrs Sudberry, with her hand on her heart.  \"How you do startle me, John, with your violence!  That is the fifteenth tea-cup this week.\"  The good lady pointed to a shattered member of the set that lay on the tray beside her.  \"I have just ordered a new set, my dear,\" said her husband, in a subdued voice.  \"Our poor dear boy would benefit, I think, by mountain air.  But go on with the _cons_.\"  \"Have I not said enough?\" replied Mrs Sudberry, with an injured look. \"Besides, they have no food in Scotland.\"  This was a somewhat staggering assertion.  The merchant looked astonished.  \"At least,\" pursued his wife, \"they have nothing, I am told, but oatmeal.  Do you imagine that Jacky could live on oatmeal?  Do you suppose that your family would return to London in a condition fit to be looked at, after a summer spent on food such as we give to our horses? No doubt you will tell me they have plenty of milk,--buttermilk, I suppose, which I abhor.  But do you think that I could live with pleasure on sawdust, just because I had milk to take to it?\"  \"But milk implies cream, my dear,\" interposed the merchant, \"and buttermilk implies butter, and both imply cows, which are strong presumptive evidence in favour of beef.  Besides--\"  \"Don't talk to me, Mr Sudberry.  _I_ know better; and Lady Knownothing, who went to Scotland last year, in the most unprejudiced state of mind, came back absolutely horrified by what she had seen.  Why, she actually tells me that the natives still wear the kilt!  The very day she passed through Edinburgh she met five hundred men without trousers!  To be sure, they had guns on their shoulders, and someone told her they were soldiers; but the sight was so appalling that she could not get rid of the impression; she shut her eyes, and ordered the coachman to drive straight through the town, and let her know when she was quite beyond its walls.  She has no doubt whatever that most, if not all, of the other inhabitants of that place were clothed--perhaps I should say unclothed--in the same way.  What surprised poor Lady Knownothing most was, that she did not see nearly so many kilts in the Highlands as she saw on that occasion in Edinburgh, from which she concluded that the natives of Scotland are less barbarous in the north than they are in the south.  But she _did_ see a few.  One man who played those hideous things called the pipes--which, she says, are so very like little pigs being killed--actually came into her presence one day, sat down before her with bare knees, and took a pinch of snuff with a salt-spoon!\"  \"That is a dreadful account, no doubt,\" said Mr Sudberry, \"but you must remember that Lady Knownothing is given to exaggerating, and is therefore not to be depended on.  Have you done with the _cons_?\"  \"Not nearly done, John, but my nervous system cannot stand the sustained contemplation of such things.  I should like to recover breath, and hear what you have to say in favour of this temporary expatriation, I had almost said, of your family.\"  \"Well, then, here goes for the _pros_,\" cried Mr Sudberry, while a gleam of excitement shot from his eyes, and his clinched hand came heavily down on the table.  \"The sixteenth cup--_as near as possible_,\" observed his wife, languidly.  \"Never mind the cups, my dear, but listen to me.  The air of the Highlands is salubrious and bracing--\"  \"And piercingly cold, my dear John,\" interrupted Mrs Sudberry.  \"In summer,\" pursued her husband, regardless of the interruption, \"it is sometimes as clear and warm as it is in Italy--\"  \"And often foggy, my dear.\"  \"The mountain scenery is grand and majestic beyond description--\"  \"Then why attempt to describe it, dear John?\"  \"The hotels in most parts of the Highlands, though rather expensive--\"  \"Ah! think of _that_, my dear.\"  \"Though rather expensive, are excellent; the food is of the best quality, and the wines are passable.  Beds--\"  \"_Have_ they beds, my dear?\"  \"Beds are generally found to be well aired and quite clean, though of course in the poorer and more remote districts they are--\"  \"Hush! pray spare my feelings, my dear John.\"  \"Remote districts, they are not so immaculate as one would wish.  Then there are endless moors covered with game, and splendid lakes and rivers full of fish.  Just think, Mary, what a region for our dear boys to revel in!  Think of the shooting--\"  \"And the dreadful accidents, my dear.\"  \"Think of the fishing--\"  \"And the wet feet, and the colds.  Poor darling Jacky, what a prospect!\"  \"Think of the glorious sunrises seen from the mountain-tops before breakfast--\"  \"And the falling over precipices, and broken necks and limbs, dear John.\"  \"Think of the shaggy ponies for our darling Lucy to ride on--\"  \"Ah! and to fall off.\"  \"And the dew of early morning on the hills, and the mists rolling up from the lakes, and the wild uncultivated beauty of all around us, and the sketching, and walking, and driving--\"  \"Dreadful!\"  \"And bathing and boating--\"  \"And drowning!\"  \"Not to mention the--\"  \"Dear John, have pity on me.  The _pros_ are too much for me.  I cannot stand the thought--\"  \"But, my dear, the _place is taken_.  The thing is _fixed_,\" said Mr Sudberry, with emphasis.  Mrs Sudberry was a wise woman.  When she was told by her husband that a thing was _fixed_, she invariably gave in with a good grace.  Her powers of dissuasion having failed,--as they always did fail,--she arose, kissed Mr Sudberry's forehead, assured him that she would try to make the most of it, since it _was_ fixed, and left the room with the comfortable feeling, of having acted the part of a dutiful wife and a resigned martyr.  It was towards the close of a doubtful summer's evening, several weeks after the conversation just detailed, that a heavy stage-coach, of an old-fashioned description, toiled slowly up the ascent of one of those wild passes, by which access is gained into the highlands of Perthshire.  The course of the vehicle had for some time lain along the banks of a turbulent river, whose waters, when not brawling over a rocky bed in impetuous velocity, or raging down a narrow gorge in misty spray, were curling calmly in deep pools or caldrons, the dark surfaces of which were speckled with foam, and occasionally broken by the leap of a yellow trout or a silver salmon.  To an angler the stream would have been captivating in the extreme, but his ardour would have been somewhat damped by the sight of the dense copsewood which overhung the water, and, while it added to the wild beauty of the scenery, suggested the idea of fishing under difficulties.  When the coach reached the narrowest part of the pass, the driver pulled up, and intimated that, \"she would be obleeged if the leddies and gentlemen would get down and walk up the brae.\"  Hereupon there descended from the top of the vehicle a short, stout, elderly gentleman, in a Glengarry bonnet, green tartan shooting-coat, and shepherd's-plaid vest and pantaloons; two active youths, of the ages of seventeen and fifteen respectively, in precisely similar costume; a man-servant in pepper and salt, and a little thin timid boy in blue, a sort of confidential page without the buttons.  All of them wore drab gaiters and shoes of the thickest conceivable description.  From the inside of the coach there issued a delicate elderly lady, who leaned, in a helpless manner, on the arm of a young, plain, but extremely fresh and sweet-looking girl of about sixteen, whom the elder lady called Lucy, and who was so much engrossed with her mother, that some time elapsed before she could attend to the fervent remarks made by her father and brothers in regard to the scenery.  There also came forth from the interior of the coach a large, red-faced angry woman, who dragged after her a little girl of about eight, who might be described as a modest sunbeam, and a little boy of about five, who resembled nothing short of an imp incarnate.  When they were all out, the entire family and household of Mr Sudberry stood in the centre of that lovely Highland pass, and the coach, which was a special one hired for the occasion, drove slowly up the ascent.  What the various members of the family said in the extravagance of their excited feelings on this occasion we do not intend to reveal.  It has been said that the day was doubtful: in the south the sky was red with the refulgent beams of the setting sun, which gleamed on the mountain peaks and glowed on the purple heather.  Towards the north dark leaden clouds obscured the heavens, and presaged stormy weather.  A few large drops began to fall as they reached the crest of the road, and opened up a view of the enclosed valley or amphitheatre which lay beyond, with a winding river, a dark overshadowed loch, and a noble background of hills.  In the far distance a white house was seen embedded in the blue mountains.  \"Yonder's ta hoose,\" said the driver, as the party overtook the coach, and resumed their places--the males on the top and the females inside.  \"Oh, my dear! look! look!\" cried Mr Sudberry, leaning over the side of the coach; \"there is our house--the white house--our Highland home!\"  At this moment a growl of distant thunder was heard.  It was followed by a scream from Mrs Sudberry, and a cry of--  \"You'd better send Jacky inside, my dear.\"  \"Ah, he may as well remain where he is,\" replied Mr Sudberry, whose imperfect hearing led him to suppose that his spouse had said, \"Jacky's inside, my dear!\" whereas the real truth was that the boy was neither out nor inside.  Master Jacky, be it known, had a remarkably strong will of his own. During the journey he preferred an outside seat in all weathers.  By dint of much coaxing, his mother had induced him to get in beside her for one stage; but he had made himself so insufferably disagreeable, that the good lady was thereafter"]]]
