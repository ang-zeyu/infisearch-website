The sky is all clouded over.      From the horizon to the zenith it is one veil of formless vapour.  And:       There is one streak of dead calm, which reflects the green mountain      perfectly from edge to edge of it. There is another calm shaped      like a great river, which is all green, touched with crimson.      Besides these there are delicate half calms, just dulled over with      faint breathings of the evening air; these, for the most part being      violet (from the sky), except at a distance, where they take a deep      crimson; and there is one piece of crimson calm near me set between      a faint violet breeze and a calm of a different violet. There are      one or two breezes sufficiently strong to cause ripple, and these      rippled spaces take the dull grey slate of the upper sky.       Realise this picture as well as you may be able, and then put in      the final touch. Between the dull calms and the glassy calms there      are drawn thin threads of division burning with scarlet fire.       This fire is of course got from the lower sky. I know whence it      comes, but how or why it lies in those thin scarlet threads there      where it is most wanted, and not elsewhere, I cannot satisfactorily      explain.  Then there was a delightful and illuminating chapter called \"A Stream at Rest.\" Hamerton, who is probably now very much out of fashion, taught me the necessity of beauty in life; and, as an accessory to Emerson, the philosophy of enjoying the little, every-day things. It was Emerson who, I think, said first to me, \"Take short outlooks\"; and I still think that there can be no better introduction to a consideration of the relation of art to nature than \"A Painter's Camp.\" It was \"A Painter's Camp\" which led me to \"The Intellectual Life.\" There is a particular passage in Hamerton's chapter on \"A Little French City\" that emphasized the need of beauty.       The cathedral is all poetry; I mean that every part of it affects      our emotional nature either by its own grandeur or beauty, or by      its allusion to histories of bright virtue or brave fortitude. And      this emotional result is independent of belief in the historical      truth of these great legends: it would be stronger, no doubt, if we      believed them, but we are still capable of feeling their solemn      poetry and large significance as we feel the poetry and      significance of \"Sir Galahad\" or \"The Idylls of the King.\"       Some persons are so constituted that it is necessary to their      happiness to live near some noble work of art or nature. A mountain      is satisfactory to them because it is great and ever new,      presenting itself every hour under aspects so unforeseen that one      can gaze at it for years with unflagging interest. To some minds,      to mine amongst others, human life is scarcely supportable far from      some stately and magnificent object, worthy of endless study and      admiration. But what of life in the plains? Truly, most plains are      dreary enough, but still they may have fine trees, or a cathedral.      And in the cathedral, here, I find no despicable compensation for      the loss of dear old Ben Cruacha.  There are some humorous and perhaps even comic passages in \"The Intellectual Life\"; these passages are unconsciously humorous or comic, as Mr. Philip Gilbert Hamerton seems to have no sense of humour. For instance, it was a great surprise to me to discover that poverty was unfavourable to the intellectual life! It was enlightening to know the reason why a man should wear evening dress after six o'clock, and why the sporting of gray clothes in the evening was unworthy of the Intellectual! Besides, it affects the character!  And letter XI \"To a Master of Arts who said that a Certain Distinguished Painter was Half-educated,\" was a useful antidote to youthful self-conceit. I had not reached the stage, treated in the chapters on \"Women and Marriage,\" \"To a Young Gentleman Who Contemplated Marriage,\" but I thought the author very wise indeed, and found many other pages which were intensely stimulating. Let others decry Hamerton if they like; I owe a great deal to him; and, though I might be induced to throw \"The Intellectual Life\" to the Young Wolves of the Beginning of this Century, I shall always insist that \"A Painter's Camp\" ought to be included in every list of books.  It was George Eliot who sent me to \"The Following of Christ,\" and she interested me in Saint Teresa, that illustrious woman so well compounded of mysticism and common sense, of whom, however, I could find no good \"Life.\" But Thomas à Kempis was a revelation! He fitted into nearly every crisis of the soul, but all his words are not for every-day life. He seems to demand too much of us poor folk of the world. Later, I came to understand that the counsel of perfection which Christ gave to the rich young man was not intended for the whole world, and many fine passages in À Kempis were meant for finer temperaments than my own.  Somebody at this time presented me with a copy of Marcus Aurelius. I found him dull, stale, and unprofitable in comparison with À Kempis. His philosophy of life seemed to lead to nothing except the cultivation of a very high opinion of oneself. I gave this conclusion to one of my English friends, who objected to my uncharted course of reading, and he said, \"A person like you who finds nothing humorous or even philosophical in 'Alice in Wonderland' cannot be expected to like the works of Marcus Aurelius!\"  It takes a prig to divide his reading into nicely staked off little plots, each with its own date. The art of injudicious reading, the art of miscellaneous reading which every normal man ought to cultivate, is a very fine and satisfactory art; for the best guide to books is a book itself. It clasps hands with a thousand other books. It has always seemed to me that \"Sesame and Lilies\" would not have been conceived by Ruskin if he had not heard well an echo of \"The Following of Christ.\" There was a time when the lovers of Ruskin who wanted to read \"The Stones of Venice\" and the rest at leisure, felt themselves obliged to form clubs, and to divide the expense, if they were of moderate means, in order to get what was good out of him. But somehow or other, probably because it appealed more to everybody, it was always possible to find a copy of \"Sesame and Lilies\" at an old book stand. I think I found one most unexpectedly at Leary's in Philadelphia, where I also discovered the copy of Froissart. The Froissart, as I have said, cost me just half of my father's Christmas present that year, which was five dollars. I must have managed to get the Ruskin volume out of some other fund, for I had many things to buy with the other two and one half dollars!  Ruskin is left alone to-day; he does not seem to fill that \"long-felt want\" which we, the young of the sixties and seventies, admitted. No doubt he is very mannered in his style, mitred and coped when he might have been very simple in his raiment. He was a priest in literature and art; and he clothed himself as a priest. He marched with a stately tread, and yet he stooped to the single violets by the wayside.  By the way, I often wished when I was reading Ruskin, who once made apple blossoms fashionable, that he had led a crusade against the double and the triple violet, which have destroyed the reputation of the real violet. What can be more repellent to the lovers of simplicity than a bunch of these artificialities, without perfume, tied by dark green ribbon, and with all their leaves removed? \"Sesame and Lilies\" had the effect of sending me back to the single violet whenever I was inclined to admire the _camellia japonica_ or any other thing that was artificial, or distorted from beauty or simplicity.  Circumstances have a great deal to do with our affection for books. Propinquity, they say, leads very frequently to marriage, and if a book happens to be near and if it is any kind of book at all, there is a great temptation to develop an affection for it. All I can say is that I think that \"Sesame and Lilies\" is a good book, for after all a book must be judged by its effect. It led me further into Ruskin, and helped me to acquire a reverence for art and to estimate the relations of art and life. One would steel oneself against the fallacy that art, true art, might exist only for art's sake, when one had read \"Sesame and Lilies\" and \"The Stones of Venice.\" Those wise men who make literary \"selections\" for the young have done well to include in their volumes that graphic description, so carefully modulated in tone, of the Cathedral of St. Mark. Its only fault is that it comes too near to being prose poetry; and discriminating readers who ponder over it will find some epithets possible only to a writer who was an artist in lines and pigments before he began to paint with the pen.  Ruskin opened our eyes rather violently to some aspects of life which we, the young, did not know; for the young after all learn very little by intuition. They must be taught things. This is perhaps an excuse for those vagaries in youth, those seemingly inexplicable adventures which shock the old who have forgotten what it is to be young.     CHAPTER II  POETS AND POETRY  _France--Of Maurice de Guérin_   In 1872, the attention of readers was forced on a few great names. These were generally the names of Frenchmen. The sympathy of Americans during the Franco-Prussian War had been with France, and during the latter days of the French Empire, before the war, Americans had been much more interested in France than in any other part of the world. There were letters from Paris in the newspapers. The Empress Eugénie and her coterie at the Tuileries, the Operas of Offenbach, and the gossip about literary magnets of the time, which included a great deal of Victor Hugo, had been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24005"],["title","But, I Don't Think (#0)"],["body","BUT, I DON'T THINK                            BY RANDALL GARRETT     _As every thinking man knows, every slave always yearns for the freedom his master denies him..._     \"_But, gentlemen,\" said the Physician, \"I really don't think we can consider any religion which has human sacrifice as an integral part as a humane religion._\"  \"_At least,\" added the Painter with a chuckle, \"not as far as the victim is concerned._\"  _The Philosopher looked irritated. \"Bosh! What if the victim likes it that way?_\"      _--THE IDLE WORSHIPERS_     _by R. Phillip Dachboden_     I   The great merchantship _Naipor_ settled her tens of thousands of tons of mass into her landing cradle on Viornis as gently as an egg being settled into an egg crate, and almost as silently. Then, as the antigravs were cut off, there was a vast, metallic sighing as the gigantic structure of the cradle itself took over the load of holding the ship in her hydraulic bath.  At that point, the ship was officially groundside, and the _Naipor_ was in the hands of the ground officers. Space Captain Humbolt Reed sighed, leaned back in his desk chair, reached out a hand, and casually touched a trio of sensitized spots on the surface of his desk.  \"Have High Lieutenant Blyke bring The Guesser to my office immediately,\" he said, in a voice that was obviously accustomed to giving orders that would be obeyed.  Then he took his fingers off the spots without waiting for an answer.  In another part of the ship, in his quarters near the Fire Control Section, sat the man known as The Guesser. He had a name, of course, a regular name, like everyone else; it was down on the ship's books and in the Main Registry. But he almost never used it; he hardly ever even thought of it. For twenty of his thirty-five years of life, he had been a trained Guesser, and for fifteen of them he'd been The Guesser of _Naipor_.  He was fairly imposing-looking for a Guesser; he had the tall, wide-shouldered build and the blocky face of an Executive, and his father had been worried that he wouldn't show the capabilities of a Guesser, while his mother had secretly hoped that he might actually become an Executive. Fortunately for The Guesser, they had both been wrong.  He was not only a Guesser, but a first-class predictor, and he showed impatience with those of his underlings who failed to use their ability in any particular. At the moment of the ship's landing, he was engaged in verbally burning the ears off Kraybo, the young man who would presumably take over The Guesser's job one day--if he ever learned how to handle it.  \"You're either a liar or an idiot,\" said The Guesser harshly, \"and I wish to eternity I knew which!\"  Kraybo, standing at attention, merely swallowed and said nothing. He had felt the back of The Guesser's hand too often before to expose himself intentionally to its swing again.  The Guesser narrowed his eyes and tried to see what was going on in Kraybo's mind.  \"Look here, Kraybo,\" he said after a moment, \"that one single Misfit ship got close enough to do us some damage. It has endangered the life of the _Naipor_ and the lives of her crewmen. You were on the board in that quadrant of the ship, and you let it get in too close. The records show that you mis-aimed one of your blasts. Now, what I want to know is this: were you really guessing or were you following the computer too closely?\"  \"I was following the computer,\" said Kraybo, in a slightly wavering voice. \"I'm sorry for the error, sir; it won't happen again.\"  The Guesser's voice almost became a snarl. \"It hadn't better! You know that a computer is only to feed you data and estimate probabilities on the courses of attacking ships; you're not supposed to think they can predict!\"  \"I know, sir; I just--\"  \"You just near came getting us all killed!\" snapped The Guesser. \"You claim that you actually guessed where that ship was going to be, but you followed the computer's extrapolation instead?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said the tense-faced Kraybo. \"I admit my error, and I'm willing to take my punishment.\"  The Guesser grinned wolfishly. \"Well, isn't that big-hearted of you? I'm very glad you're willing, because I just don't know what I'd do if you refused.\"  Kraybo's face burned crimson, but he said nothing.  The Guesser's voice was sarcastically soft. \"But I guess about the only thing I could do in that case would be to\"--The Guesser's voice suddenly became a bellow--\"_kick your thick head in_!\"  Kraybo's face drained of color suddenly.  The Guesser became suddenly brusque. \"Never mind. We'll let it go for now. Report to the Discipline Master in Intensity Five for ten minutes total application time. Dismissed.\"  Kraybo, whose face had become even whiter, paused for a moment, as though he were going to plead with The Guesser. But he saw the look in his superior's eyes and thought better of it.  \"Yes, sir,\" he said in a weak voice. He saluted and left.         *       *       *       *       *  And The Guesser just sat there, waiting for what he knew would come.  It did. High Lieutenant Blyke showed up within two minutes after Kraybo had left. He stood at the door of The Guesser's cubicle, accompanied by a sergeant-at-arms.  \"Master Guesser, you will come with us.\" His manner was bored and somewhat flat.  The Guesser bowed his head as he saluted. \"As you command, great sir.\" And he followed the lieutenant into the corridor, the sergeant tagging along behind.  The Guesser wasn't thinking of his own forthcoming session with the captain; he was thinking of Kraybo.  Kraybo was twenty-one, and had been in training as a Guesser ever since he was old enough to speak and understand. He showed occasional flashes of tremendous ability, but most of the time he seemed--well, _lazy_. And then, there was always the question of his actual ability.  A battle in the weirdly distorted space of ultralight velocities requires more than machines and more than merely ordinary human abilities. No computer, however built, can possibly estimate the flight of a dodging spaceship with a canny human being at the controls. Even the superfast beams from a megadyne force gun require a finite time to reach their target, and it is necessary to fire at the place where the attacking ship will be, not at the position it is occupying at the time of firing. That was a bit of knowledge as old as human warfare: you must lead a moving target.  For a target moving at a constant velocity, or a constant acceleration, or in any other kind of orbit which is mathematically predictable, a computer was not only necessary, but sufficient. In such a case, the accuracy was perfect, the hits one hundred per cent.  But the evasive action taken by a human pilot, aided by a randomity selector, is not logical and therefore cannot be handled by a computer. Like the path of a microscopic particle in Brownian motion, its position can only be predicted statistically; estimating its probable location is the best that can be done. And, in space warfare, probability of that order is simply not good enough.  To compute such an orbit required a special type of human mind, and therefore a special type of human. It required a Guesser.  The way a Guesser's mind operated could only be explained _to_ a Guesser _by_ another Guesser. But, as far as anyone else was concerned, only the objective results were important. A Guesser could \"guess\" the route of a moving ship, and that was all anyone cared about. And a Master Guesser prided himself on his ability to guess accurately 99.999% of the time. The ancient sport of baseball was merely a test of muscular co-ordination for a Guesser; as soon as a Guesser child learned to control a bat, his batting average shot up to 1.000 and stayed there until he got too old to swing the bat. A Master Guesser could make the same score blindfolded.  Hitting a ship in space at ultralight velocities was something else again. Young Kraybo could play baseball blindfolded, but he wasn't yet capable of making the master guesses that would protect a merchantship like the _Naipor_.  But what was the matter with him? He had, of course, a fire-control computer to help him swing and aim his guns, but he didn't seem to be able to depend on his guesswork. He had more than once fired at a spot where the computer said the ship would be instead of firing at the spot where it actually arrived a fraction of a second later.  There were only two things that could be troubling him. Either he was doing exactly as he said--ignoring his guesses and following the computer--or else he was inherently incapable of controlling his guesswork and was hoping that the computer would do the work for him.  If the first were true, then Kraybo was a fool; if the second, then he was a liar, and was no more capable of handling the fire control of the _Naipor_ than the captain was.  The Guesser hated to have Kraybo punished, really, but that was the only way to make a youngster keep his mind on his business.  _After all_, thought The Guesser, _that's the way I learned; Kraybo can learn the same way. A little nerve-burning never hurt anyone._  But that last thought was more to bolster himself than it was to justify his own actions toward Kraybo. The lieutenant was at the door of the captain's office, with The Guesser right behind him.         *       *       *       *       *  The door dilated to receive the three--the lieutenant, The Guesser, and the sergeant-at-arms--and they marched across the room to the captain's desk.  The captain didn't even bother to look up until High Lieutenant Blyke saluted and said: \"The Guesser, sir.\"  And the captain gave the lieutenant a quick nod and then looked coldly at The Guesser. \"The ship has been badly damaged. Since there are no repair docks here on Viornis, we will have to unload our cargo and then go--_empty_--all the way to D'Graski's Planet for repairs. All during that time, we will be more vulnerable than ever to Misfit raids.\"  His ice-chill voice stopped, and he"]]]
