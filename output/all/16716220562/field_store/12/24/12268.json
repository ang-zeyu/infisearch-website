She just asks the girl to say she's been, and it's nothing of importance, when she doesn't find me in. If she can do without cards, we can. You'd much better go by her.\"  \"Thank you, I have my own ideas of propriety, and I do not take them from Miss Sakers. I shall order fifty of each sort from Amrod's this morning.\"  \"Then that makes a hundred cards wasted.\"  \"Either you cannot count,\" I said, \"or you have yet to learn that there are three sorts of cards used by married people--the husband's cards, the wife's cards, and the card with both names on it.\"  \"Go it!\" said Eliza. \"Get a card for the cat as well. She knows a lot more cats than we know people!\"  I could have given a fairly sharp retort to that, but I preferred to remain absolutely silent. I thought it might show Eliza that she was becoming rather vulgar. Silence is often the best rebuke. However, Eliza went on:  \"Mother would hate it, I know that. To talk about cards, with the last lot of coals not paid for--I call it wickedness.\"  I simply walked out of the house, went straight down to Amrod's, and ordered those cards. When the time comes for me to put my foot down, I can generally put it down as well as most people. No one could be easier to live with than I am, and I am sure Eliza has found it so; but what I say is, if a man is not master in his own house, then where is he?                       *      *      *      *      *  Amrod printed the cards while I waited. I had them done in the Old English character. I suggested some little decoration to give them a tone,--an ivy leaf in the corner, or a little flourish under the name,--but Amrod was opposed to this. He seemed to think it was not essential, and it would have been charged extra, and also he had nothing of the kind in stock. So I let that pass. The cards looked very well as they were, a little plain and formal, perhaps, but very clean (except in the case of a few where the ink had rubbed), and very gratifying to one's natural self-respect.  [Illustration: \"_He seemed to think it was not essential._\"]  That evening I took a small cardboard box that had contained candles, and packed in it a few carefully selected flowers from the garden, and one of our cards. On the card I wrote \"With kindest love from\" just above the names, and posted it to Eliza's mother.  So far was Eliza's mother from being offended that she sent Eliza a present of a postal-order for five shillings, three pounds of pressed beef, and a nicely worked apron.  On glancing over that sentence, I see that it is, perhaps, a little ambiguous. The postal order was for the shillings alone--not for the beef or the apron.  I only mention the incident to show whether, in this case, Eliza or I was right.                       *      *      *      *      *  I put a few of my own cards in my letter-case, and the rest were packed away in a drawer. A few weeks afterward I was annoyed to find Eliza using some of her cards for winding silks. She said that it did not prevent them from being used again, if they were ever wanted.  \"Pardon me,\" I said, \"but cards for social purposes should not be bent or frayed at the edge, and can hardly be too clean. Oblige me by not doing that again!\"  That evening Eliza told me that No. 14 in the Crescent had been taken by some people called Popworth.  \"That must be young Popworth who used to be in our office,\" I said. \"I heard that he was going to be married this year. You must certainly call and leave cards.\"  \"Which sort, and how many?\"  \"Without referring to a book, I can hardly say precisely. These things are very much a matter of taste. Leave enough--say one of each sort for each person in the house. There should be no stint.\"  \"How am I to know how many persons there are?\"  \"Ask the butcher with whom they deal.\"  On the following day I remarked that Popworth must have come in for money, to be taking so large a house, and I hoped she had left the cards.  \"I asked the butcher, and he said there was Popworth, his wife, two sisters, a German friend, and eleven children. That was sixteen persons, and made forty-eight cards altogether. You see, I remembered your rule.\"  \"My dear Eliza,\" I said, \"I told you as plainly as possible that it was a matter of taste. You ought not to have left forty-eight at once.\"  \"Oh, I couldn't keep running backwards and forwards leaving a few at a time. I've got something else to do. There's three pair of your socks in the basket waiting to be darned, as it is.\"  \"And, good heavens! That Popworth can't be my Popworth. If he's only married this year, he can't, in the nature of things, have got eleven children. And a house like this can't call on a house like that without a something to justify it.\"  \"That's what I thought.\"  \"Then what on earth did you call for?\"  \"I didn't. Who said I did?\"                       *      *      *      *      *  I gave a sigh of relief. Later in the evening, when Eliza took a card, notched a bit out of each side, and began winding silk on it, I thought it wiser to say nothing. It is better sometimes to pretend not to see things.     ELIZA'S MOTHER   I generally send Eliza to spend a day with her mother early in December, and try to cheer her up a little. I daresay the old lady is very lonely, and appreciates the kindly thought. The return ticket is four-and-two, and Eliza generally buys a few flowers to take with her. That does not leave much change out of five shillings when the day is over, but I don't grudge the money. Eliza's mother generally tries to find out, without precisely asking, what we should like for a Christmas present. Eliza does not actually tell her, or even hint it--she would not care to do anything of that sort. But she manages, in a tactful sort of way, to let her know.  For instance, the year before last Eliza's mother happened to say, \"I wonder if you know what I am going to give you this Christmas.\"  Eliza said, \"I can see in your eye, mother, and you sha'n't do it. It's much too expensive. If other people can do without silver salt-cellars, I suppose we can.\"  Well, we got them; so that was all right. But last year it was more difficult.                       *      *      *      *      *  You see, early in last December I went over my accounts, and I could see that I was short. For one thing, Eliza had had the measles. Then I had bought a bicycle, and though I sold it again, it did not, in that broken state, bring in enough to pay the compensation to the cabman. I was much annoyed about that. It was true I ran into the horse, but it was not my fault that it bolted and went into the lamp-post. As I said, rather sharply, to the man when I paid him, if his horse had been steady the thing would never have happened. He did not know what to answer, and made some silly remark about my not being fit to ride a mangle. Both then and at the time of the accident his language was disrespectful and profane.  However, I need not go further into that. It is enough to say that we had some unusual expenses, and were distinctly short.  \"I don't blame you, Eliza,\" I said. \"Anything you have had you are very welcome to.\"  \"I haven't had anything, except the measles,\" she said; \"and I don't see how you can blame me for that.\"  \"But,\" I said, \"I think it's high time you paid a visit to your mother, and showed her that we have not forgotten her. Take some Swiss roll--about sixpennyworth. Try to make things seem a little brighter to her. If she says anything about Christmas, and you saw your way to getting a cheque from her this year instead of her usual present, you might do that. But show her that we are really fond of her--remember she is your mother, and has few pleasures. A fiver just now would make a good deal of difference to me, and even a couple of sovereigns would be very handy.\"                       *      *      *      *      *  When Eliza came back, I saw by her face that it was all right.  \"I didn't have to say anything,\" she said. \"Mother told me of her own accord that she knew that you had money troubles, and that she was going to take advantage of the Christmas season to relieve you from them in a way which at another time you might be too proud to accept.\"  \"That,\" I said, warmly, \"is very thoughtful of her, and very delicate, and it can only mean one thing. It settles me. This year, Eliza, we will give your mother a present. Quite a trifle, of course--about two shillings. It will be a token, and she will value it.\"  When I returned from the city I found that Eliza had purchased a small white vase for one-and-ten. The man in the shop had told her that it was alabaster. I had my doubts about that, but it was quite in my own taste--rather severe and classical. I complimented Eliza on her choice.  Three days before Christmas I got a letter from Eliza's mother. She said that she had been afraid that I was worrying about my debt to her of Â£4 13_s._ 9_d._ She took advantage of the Christmas season to return my I.O.U.'s, and begged me to consider the debt as paid.  It was not at all what I had expected.                       *      *      *      *      *  \"No,\" I said to Eliza at breakfast, \"I am not in the least like a bear with a sore head, and I will thank you not to use the expression. As for your mother's kindness, I am glad you think it kindness. I wouldn't have it otherwise. If you weren't a born idiot you wouldn't think so. My debt to your mother would have been discharged by--discharged in due course. By reminding me that I owed her money, she has practically dunned me for it, and forced me to pay her at a most inconvenient time. She comes badgering me for her dirty money at Christmas, and you call"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23783"],["title","Eliza (#2)"],["body","'kindness!' Kindness! Hah! Oh, hah, hah!\"  \"Don't make those silly noises, and get on with your breakfast!\" said Eliza.  Afterward she asked me if I still meant to send her mother that little vase.  \"Oh, yes!\" I said. \"We can afford it; it's nothing to us.\"  Eliza, entirely misunderstanding the word that I next used, got up and said that she would not stop in the room to hear her poor mother sworn at.  \"The word I used,\" I said, calmly, \"was alabaster, and not what you suppose.\"  \"You pronounced it just like the other thing.\"  \"I pronounced it in an exclamatory manner,\" I replied, \"from contempt! You seem to me very ready to think evil. This is not the first time!\"  Eliza apologized. As a matter of fact, I really did say alabaster. But I said it emphatically, and I own that it relieved my feelings.  We keep the silver salt-cellars in the drawer of Eliza's wardrobe as a general rule. I should prefer to use them every day, or at any rate every Sunday. But Eliza says that they make work.  \"Mother has written to me,\" she said on the following day, \"to say that she will dine with us on Christmas Day. I had better get the silver salt-cellars down.\"  \"You'd better _put them up_,\" I said, meaningly. I know that sounds rather bitter, but I confess that I have always had a weakness for the wit that stings.  Well, it did not actually come to that. They allowed me to draw a couple of pounds in advance at the office. I suppose they know that when they have got a good man it is worth while to stretch a point to keep him. Not that I was at all dictatorial--apparently I asked it as a favour. But I fancy our manager saw that I was not a man to be played with.  Eliza's mother dined with us, and brought a couple of ducks. Conscience, I should say.  At the moment of writing my financial position is absolutely sound, and even if Eliza's mother forced me to use her present to me to pay my debt to her (Â£7 19_s._ 5_d._), though I might think it dishonourable on her part, I should not be seriously inconvenienced. However, Eliza is going early in December to suggest sauce-boats (plated). That is to say, she may possibly mention them if any occasion arises.     MISS SAKERS   On Saturdays I always get back from the office early. This particular Saturday afternoon I looked at our chimneys as I came down the street. I thought it very queer, but, to make certain, as soon as I got into the house I opened the drawing-room door. It was just as I thought. I called up-stairs to Eliza, rather sharply.  She came down and said, \"Well, what's the matter?\"  I said, calmly, \"The matter? Jane has apparently gone mad, that's all.\" (Jane is the name of our servant.)  Eliza said that she did not think so, and asked me what the girl had done.  I must say it made me feel rather sarcastic--it would have made any man feel sarcastic. I said, \"Oh, nothing. Merely lit the fire in the drawing-room; and not only lit it, but piled coals on it. It is not Sunday, so far as I am aware.\" It is our rule to have the drawing-room fire lit on Sundays only. We are rather exclusive, and some other people seem to be rather stuck-up, and between the two we do not have many callers. If any one comes, it is always perfectly easy for Eliza to say, \"The housemaid has foolishly forgotten to light the fire here. Shall we not step into the dining-room?\" I hate to see anything like waste.  \"At this very moment,\" I added, \"the drawing-room fire is flaming half-way up the chimney. It seems we can afford to burn half a ton of coals for nothing. I cannot say that I was aware of it.\"  \"You _are_ satirical!\" said Eliza. \"I always know when you are being satirical, because you move your eyebrows, and say, 'I am aware,' instead of 'I know.' I told Jane to light the fire myself.\"  \"May I ask why?\"  \"Miss Sakers is coming in. She sent me a note this morning to say so.\"  \"That puts a different complexion on the affair. Very tactful of her to have announced the intention. I do not grudge a handful of firing when there is a reason. I only ask that there shall be a reason.\" Miss Sakers is the vicar's daughter. Strictly speaking, I suppose her social position is superior to our own. I know for a fact that she has been to county balls. She seemed anxious to cultivate an intimacy with us, so I gathered. I was not absurdly pleased about it. One has one's dignity. Besides, at the office we frequently see people far above Miss Sakers. A nobleman who had called to see one of the partners once remarked to me, \"Your office is a devilish long way from everywhere!\" There was no particular reason why he should have spoken to me, but he seemed to wish it. After that, it was no very great thing that Miss Sakers seemed anxious to know us better. At the same time, I do not pretend that I was displeased. I went into the drawing-room and put some more coal on.  \"Is it to be a party?\" I asked.  \"Not at all. She is coming quite as a friend.\"  I went up-stairs and changed all my clothes, and then purchased a few flowers, which I placed in vases in the drawing-room. Eliza had got two kinds of cake; I added a plate of mixed biscuits on my own responsibility. Beyond this, I did nothing in the way of preparation, wishing to keep the thing as simple and informal as possible.                       *      *      *      *      *  The tea was quite a success. Miss Sakers was to have a stall at the bazaar in aid of the new church. I promised her five shillings at first, but afterward made it seven-and-six. Though no longer young, Miss Sakers is very pleasant in her manner.  After tea Miss Sakers and Eliza both did needlework. Miss Sakers was doing a thing in crewels. I could not see what Eliza was doing. She kept it hidden, almost under the table.  To prevent the conversation from flagging, I said, \"Eliza, dear, what are you making?\"  She frowned hard at me, shook her head slightly, and asked Miss Sakers about the special preacher for Epiphany Sunday.  I at once guessed that Eliza was doing something for Miss Sakers' stall at the bazaar, and had intended to keep it secret.  I smiled. \"Miss Sakers,\" I said, \"I do not know what Eliza is making, but I am quite sure it is for you.\"  There was a dead silence. Miss Sakers and Eliza both blushed. Then Miss Sakers said, without looking at me, \"I think you are mistaken.\"  I felt so sure that I was mistaken that I blushed, too.  Eliza hurriedly hid her work in the work-basket, and said, \"It is very close in here. Let me show you round our little garden.\"  They both went out, without taking any notice of me. Not having had much tea, I cut myself another slice of cake. While I was in the middle of it, Miss Sakers and Eliza came back, and Miss Sakers said good-bye to me very coldly. I offered to raise my bazaar donation to ten shillings, but she did not seem to have heard me.                       *      *      *      *      *  \"How could you say that?\" said Eliza, when Miss Sakers had gone. \"It was most tactless--and not very nice.\"  \"I thought you were doing something for the bazaar. What were you making, then?\"  She did not actually tell me, but she implied it in a delicate way.  \"Well,\" I said, \"of course I wouldn't have called attention to it if I had known, but I don't think you ought to have been doing that work when Miss Sakers was here.\"  \"I've no time to waste, and I always make mine myself. I was most careful to keep them hidden. You are very tactless.\"  \"I don't think much of that Miss Sakers,\" I said. \"Why should we go to this expense,\" pointing to the cakes, \"for a woman of that kind?\"     THE ORCHESTROME   The orchestrome was on Lady Sandlingbury's stall at the bazaar. Her ladyship came up to Eliza in the friendliest way, and said, \"My dear lady, I am convinced that you need an orchestrome. It's the sweetest instrument in the world, worth at least five pounds, and for one shilling you have a chance of getting it. It is to be raffled.\" Eliza objects, on principle, to anything like gambling; but as this was for the Deserving Inebriates, which is a good cause, she paid her shilling. She won the orchestrome, and I carried it home for her.                       *      *      *      *      *  Six tunes were given with the orchestrome; each tune was on a slip of perforated paper, and all you had to do was to put in a slip and touch the spring.  We tried it first with \"The Dandy Coloured Coon.\" It certainly played something, but it was not right. There was no recognizable tune about it.  \"This won't do at all,\" I said.  \"Perhaps that tune's got bent or something,\" said Eliza. \"Put in another.\"  I put in \"The Lost Chord\" and \"The Old Folks at Home,\" and both were complete failures--a mere jumble of notes, with no tune in them at all. I confess that this exasperated me.  \"You see what you've done?\" I said. \"You've fooled away a shilling. Nothing is more idiotic than to buy a thing without trying it first.\"  \"Why didn't you say that before, then?\" said Eliza. \"I don't believe there's anything really wrong with it--just some little thing that's got out of order, and can be put right again.\"  \"Wrong! Why, it's wrong all through. Not one scrap of any of the tunes comes out right. I shall take it back to Lady Sandlingbury at once.\"  \"Oh, don't do that!\"  But my mind was made up, and I went back to the bazaar, and up to Lady Sandlingbury's stall. Eliza wouldn't come with me.  \"I beg your ladyship's pardon,\" I said, \"but your ladyship supplied me with this orchestrome, and your ladyship will have to take it back again.\"  \"Dear me! what's all the trouble?\"  I started the instrument, and let her hear for herself. She smiled, and turned to another lady who was helping her. The other lady was young, and very pretty, but with a scornful kind of amused expression, and a drawling way of speaking--both of which I disliked extremely.  \"Edith,\" said Lady Sandlingbury, \"here's this angry gentleman going to put us both in prison for selling him a bad orchestrome. He says it won't work.\"  \"Doesn't"]]]
