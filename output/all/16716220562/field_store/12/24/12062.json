There's a raft,\" pointing to what had been the gangplank. \"Cannot you and your infant daughter manage to get ashore on that? This other lady is an expert swimmer, and I think she can reach land, while Buffalo Bill will, of course, save himself.\"  \"Me save myself!\" exclaimed Rosy Posy, gleefully. She had no objections to swimming on land, and throwing her fat self down flat, kicked vigorously, and assisted Boffin to swim by her side.  Kitty and Arabella arranged themselves on the raft, which Kitty propelled by a series of hitches. The shipwrecked sufferers thus made their way toward the desert island. There were several narrow escapes from drowning, but they generously assisted each other, and once when Kitty fell off her raft, the noble Captain offered to take Arabella on his own broad and stalwart back.  Buffalo Bill frequently forgot she was in the tossing ocean, and walked upright on her own fat legs.  But King said she was only \"treading water,\" go that was all right.  At last they sighted land, and by a mighty effort, and much encouraging of one another, they managed to reach the shore of the island. Exhausted, Marjorie threw herself on the beach, and the half-drowned Captain also dragged himself up on dry land. Kitty skilfully brought her raft ashore, and stepped out, exclaiming: \"Saved! But to what a fate!\"  This was one of their favorite lines, and Marjorie weakly opened her eyes to respond:  \"Methinks I shall not see to-morrow's sun!\"  \"Hist!\" whispered Kingdon, \"say no word, lady. There may be cannibals here!\"  \"Tannibals!\" cried Buffalo Bill. \"I 'ike Tannibals. Where is zey?\"  Somewhat revived, Kingdon began to look round the desert island to see what its nature might be.  \"We have escaped one terrible death!\" he declared, \"only to meet another. We must starve! This is a desert island exactly in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. No steamers pass here; no sailing vessels or ferryboats or,--or anything!\"  \"Oh! What shall we do?\" moaned Kitty, clasping her hands in despair. \"My precious Arabella! Already she is begging for food.\"  \"We must consider,\" said Marjorie, sitting up, and looking about her. \"If there is nothing else, we must kill the bear and eat him.\"  \"No, no!\" screamed Rosy Posy. \"No, no eat my Boffin Bear.\"  \"I will explore,\" said Kingdon. \"Come, Buffalo Bill, we are the men of this party, we will go all over the island and see what may be found in the way of food. Perhaps we will find cocoanuts.\"  \"Ess,\" said Buffalo Bill, slipping her little hand in her brother's, \"an' we'll take Boffin, so he won't get all killded.\"  \"And while you're gone,\" said Marjorie, \"we will dry our dripping garments and mend them.\"  \"Yes,\" said Kitty, \"with needles and thread out of my bag. I brought a big bag of all sorts of things, like Robinson Crusoe.\"  \"That wasn't Robinson Crusoe,\" said King, \"it was Mrs. Swiss Robinson.\"  \"Oh, so it was! Well, it doesn't matter, I brought the bag, anyway.\"  The two brave men went away, and returned in a surprisingly short time with a surprising amount of food.  \"These are cocoanuts,\" announced Kingdon, as he displayed four oranges. \"I had to climb the tall palm trees to reach them. But no hardships or dangers are too great to assist fair ladies.\"  The fair ladies expressed great delight at the gallant Captain's deed, and asked Buffalo Bill what she had secured.  \"Edds,\" said Rosy Posy, triumphantly, and, sure enough, in her tiny skirt, which she held gathered up before her, were three eggs and a cracker.  The eggs were hard-boiled, and were promptly appropriated by the three elder victims of the shipwreck, while the cracker fell to the share of Buffalo Bill, who was not yet of an age to eat hard-boiled eggs.  \"I, too, will make search!\" cried Marjorie. \"Methinks there may yet be food which you overlooked.\"  As Marjorie had brought the food to the desert island only an hour before, it was not impossible that she might find some more, so they let her go to make search. She returned with a paper bag of crackers and another of pears.  \"These are bread fruit,\" she announced, showing the crackers; \"and these are wild pears. This is indeed a fruitful island, and we're lucky to be wrecked on such a good one.\"  \"Lucky, indeed!\" agreed the Captain. \"Why, when I discovered those eggs on a rocky ledge, I knew at once they were gulls' eggs.\"  \"And how fortunate that they're boiled,\" said Kitty. \"I can't bear raw eggs.\"  The shipwrecked sufferers then spread out their food, and sat down to a pleasant meal, for the Maynard children had convenient appetites, and could eat at almost any hour of the day.     CHAPTER II  AN EXASPERATING GUEST   \"Aren't hard-boiled eggs the very best things to eat in all the world?\" said Marjorie, as she looked lovingly at the golden sphere she had just extracted from its ivory setting.  \"They're awful good,\" agreed King, \"but I like oranges better.\"  \"Me eat lollunge,\" piped up Rosy Posy. \"Buffaro Bill would 'ike a lollunge.\"  \"So you shall, Baby. Brother'll fix one for you.\"  And the shipwrecked Captain carefully prepared an orange, and gave it bit by bit into the eager, rosy fingers.  \"Of all things in the world,\" said Kitty, \"I like chocolate creams best.\"  \"Oh, so do I, if I'm not hungry!\" said Marjorie. \"I think I like different things at different times.\"  \"Well, it doesn't matter much what you like now,\" said King, as he gave the last section of orange to Rosy Posy, \"for everything is all eaten up. Where'd you get those eggs, Mops? We never hardly have them except on picnics.\"  \"I saw them in the pantry. Ellen had them for a salad or something. So I just took them, and told her she could boil some more.\"  \"You're a good one, Mopsy,\" said her brother, looking at her in evident admiration. \"The servants never get mad at you. Now if I had hooked those eggs, Ellen would have blown me up sky-high.\"  \"Oh, I just smiled at her,\" said Marjorie, \"and then it was all right. Now, what are we going to do next?\"  \"Hark!\" said Kingdon, who was again the shipwrecked mariner. \"I hear a distant sound as of fierce wild beasts growling and roaring.\"  \"My child, my child!\" shrieked Kitty, snatching up Arabella. \"She will be torn by dreadful lions and tigers!\"  \"We must protect ourselves,\" declared Marjorie. \"Captain, can't you build a barricade? They always do that in books.\"  \"Ay, ay, ma'am. But also we must hoist a flag, a signal of distress. For should a ship come by, they might stop and rescue us.\"  \"But we have no flag. What can we use for one?\"  \"Give me your daughter's petticoat,\" said the Captain to Kitty.  \"Not so!\" said Kitty, who was fond of dramatic phrases. \"Arabella's petticoat is spandy clean, and I won't have it used to make a flag.\"  \"I'll give you a flag,\" said Marjorie. \"Take my hair-ribbon.\" She began to pull off her red ribbon, but Kingdon stopped her.  \"No,\" he said, \"that won't do. We're not playing Pirates. It must be a white flag. It's for a signal of distress.\"  Marjorie thought a moment. There really seemed to be no white flag available.  \"All right!\" she cried, in a moment. \"I'll give you a piece of my petticoat. It's an old one, and the ruffle is torn anyhow.\"  In a flash, impetuous Marjorie had torn a good-sized bit out of her little white petticoat, and the Captain fastened it to a long branch he had broken from the maple tree.  This he managed, with the aid of some stones, to fasten in an upright position, and then they sat down to watch for a passing sail.  \"Buffaro Bill so s'eepy,\" announced that small person, and, with fat old Boffin for a pillow, Rosy Posy calmly dropped off into a morning nap.  But the others suffered various dreadful vicissitudes. They were attacked by wild beasts, which, though entirely imaginary, required almost as much killing as if they had been real.  Kitty shot or lassoed a great many, but she declined to engage in the hand-to-hand encounters with tigers and wolves, such as Marjorie and Kingdon undertook, for fear she'd be thrown down on the ground. And, indeed, her fears were well founded, for the valiant fighters were often thrown by their fierce adversaries, and rolled over and over, only to pick themselves up and renew the fray.  More exciting still was an attack from the natives of the island. They were horrible savages, with tomahawks, and they approached with blood-curdling yells.  Needless to say that, after a fearful battle, the natives were all slain or put to rout, and the conquerors, exhausted but triumphant, sat round their camp-fire and boasted of their valorous deeds.  As noontime drew near, the settlers on the island began to grow hungry again, and, strange to say, the imaginary birds they shot and ate were not entirely satisfying.  Buffalo Bill, too, waked up, and demanded a jink of water.  But none could leave the island and brave the perils of the boundless ocean, unless in a rescuing ship.  For a long time they waited. They waved their white flag, and they even shouted for help.  But the \"island\" was at some distance from the house or street and none came to rescue them.  At last, they saw a huge, white-covered wagon slowly moving along the back drive.  \"A sail! A sail!\" cried the Captain. \"What, ho! Help! Help!\"  The other shipwrecked ones joined the cry, and soon the wagon drew a little nearer, and then stopped.  \"Help! Help!\" cried the children in chorus.  It was the butcher's wagon, and they knew it well, but this season there was a new driver who didn't know the Maynard children.  \"What's the matther?\" he cried, jumping from his seat, and running across the grass to the quartette.  \"We're shipwrecked!\" cried Marjorie. \"We can't get home. Oh, save us from a cruel fate! Carry us back to our far-away fireside!\"  \"Help!\" cried Kitty, faintly. \"My child is ill, and I can no longer survive!\"  Dramatic Kitty sank in a heap on the ground, and the butcher's boy was more bewildered than ever.  \"Save me!\" cried Rosy Posy, toddling straight to him, and putting up her arms. \"Save"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23531"],["title","Marjorie's Busy Days (#2)"],["body","Bill first,--me an' Boffin.\"  This was more intelligible, and the butcher's boy picked up the smiling child, and with a few long strides reached his cart, and deposited her therein.  \"Me next! Me next!\" screamed Marjorie. \"I'm fainting, too!\" With a thud, she fell in a heap beside Kitty.  \"The saints presarve us!\" exclaimed the frightened Irishman. \"Whativer is the matther wid these childher? Is it pizened ye are?\"  \"No, only starving,\" said Marjorie, but her faint voice was belied by the merry twinkle in her eyes, which she couldn't suppress at the sight of the man's consternation.  \"Aha! It's shammin' ye are! I see now.\"  \"It's a game,\" explained Kingdon. \"We're shipwrecked on a desert island, and you're a passing captain of a small sailing vessel. Will you take us aboard?\"  \"Shure, sir,\" said the other, his face aglow with Irish wit and intelligence. \"I persave yer manin'. 'Deed I will resky ye, but how will ye get through the deep wathers to me ship forninst?\"  \"You wade over, and carry this lady,\" said King, pointing to Kitty, \"and the rest of us will swim.\"  \"Thot's a foine plan; come along, miss;\" and in a moment Kitty was swung up to the brave rescuer's shoulder, while King and Midget were already \"swimming\" across the grass to the rescue ship.  All clambered into the wagon, and the butcher drove them in triumph to the back door. Here they jumped out, and, after thanking their kind rescuer, they scampered into the house.  \"Such a fun!\" said Rosy Posy, as her mother bathed her heated little face. \"Us was all shipperecked, an' I was Buffaro Bill, an' Boffin was my big wild bear!\"  \"You two are sights!\" said Mrs. Maynard; laughing as she looked at the muddied, grass-stained, and torn condition of Kingdon and Marjorie. \"I'm glad you had your play-clothes on, but I don't see why you always have to have such rough-and-tumble plays.\"  \"'Cause we're a rough-and-tumble pair, Mothery,\" said King; \"look at Kitty there! she kept herself almost spick and span.\"  \"Well, I'm glad I have all sorts of children,\" said Mrs. Maynard. \"Go and get into clean clothes, and be ready for luncheon promptly on time. I'm expecting Miss Larkin.\"  \"Larky! Oh!\" groaned Kingdon. \"I say, Mothery, can't we--us children, I mean--have lunch in the playroom?\" He had sidled up to his mother and was caressing her cheek with his far-from-clean little hands.  \"No,\" said Mrs. Maynard, smiling as she kissed the brown fingers, \"no, my boy, I want all my olive-branches at my table to-day. So, run along now and get civilized.\"  \"Come on, Mops,\" said Kingdon, in a despairing tone, and, with their arms about each other, the two dawdled away.  Kitty had already gone to Nurse to be freshened up. Kitty loved company, and was always ready to put on her best manners.  But King and Midget had so much talking to do, and so many plans to make, that they disliked the restraint that company necessarily put upon their own conversation.  \"I do detest old Larky,\" said the boy, as they went away.  \"I don't mind her so much,\" said Marjorie, \"except when she asks me questions.\"  \"She's always doing that.\"  \"Yes, I know it. But I promised Mother I'd be extra good to-day, and try to talk politely to her. Of course, I can do it if I try.\"  \"So can I,\" said King, with an air of pride in his own powers. \"All right, Mops, let's be 'specially 'stremely good and treat Miss Larkin just lovely.\"  Nearly an hour later the four shipwrecked unfortunates, now transformed into clean, well-dressed civilians, were grouped in the library to await Miss Larkin's arrival.  The lady was an old friend of Mrs. Maynard's, and though by no means elderly, was yet far from being as young as she tried to look and act.  She came tripping in, and after greeting her hostess effusively, she turned to the children.  \"My, my!\" she said. \"What a group of little dears! How you have grown,--every one of you. Kingdon, my dear boy, would you like to kiss me?\"  The request was far from acceptable to King, but the simper that accompanied it so repelled him that he almost forgot his determination to be very cordial to the unwelcome guest. But Midge gave him a warning pinch on his arm, and with an unintelligible murmur of consent, he put up his cheek for the lady's salute.  \"Oh, what a dear boy!\" she gurgled. \"I really think I shall have to take you home with me! And, now, here's Marjorie. How are you, my dear? Do you go to school now? And what are you learning?\"  Miss Larkin's questions always irritated Marjorie, but she answered politely, and then stepped aside in Kitty's favor.  \"Sweet little Katharine,\" said the visitor. \"You are really an angel child. With your golden hair and blue eyes, you're a perfect cherub; isn't she, Mrs. Maynard?\"  \"She's a dear little girl,\" said her mother, smiling, \"but not always angelic. Here's our baby, our Rosamond.\"  \"No, I'se Buffaro Bill!\" declared Rosy Posy, assuming a valiant attitude, quite out of keeping with her smiling baby face and chubby body.  \"Oh, what delicious children! Dear Mrs. Maynard, how good of you to let me come to see them.\"  As Miss Larkin always invited herself, this speech was literally true, but as she and Mrs. Maynard had been schoolmates long ago, the latter felt it her duty to give her friend such pleasure as she could.  At the luncheon table, Miss Larkin kept up a running fire of questions.  This, she seemed to think, was the only way to entertain children.  \"Do you like to read?\" she asked of Marjorie.  \"Yes, indeed,\" said Midget, politely.  \"And what books do you like best?\"  \"Fairy stories,\" said Marjorie, promptly.  \"Oh, tut, tut!\" and Miss Larkin shook a playful finger. \"You should like history. Shouldn't she, now?\" she asked, appealing to Kingdon.  \"We like history, too,\" said Kingdon. \"At least, we like it some; but we both like fairy stories better.\"  \"Ah, well, children will be children. Do you like summer or winter best?\"  This was a poser. It had never occurred to Marjorie to think which she liked best.  \"I like them both alike,\" she said, truthfully.  \"Oh, come now; children should have some mind of their own! Little Miss Kitty, I'm sure you know whether you like summer or winter best.\"  Kitty considered.  \"I like winter best for Christmas, and summer for Fourth of July,\" she said at last, with the air of one settling a weighty matter.  But Miss Larkin really cared nothing to know about these things; it was only her idea of making herself entertaining to her young audience.  \"And you, Baby Rosamond,\" she went on, \"what do you like best in all the world?\"  \"Boffin,\" was the ready reply, \"an' Buffaro Bill, 'cause I'm it.\"  They all laughed at this, for in the Maynard family Rosy Posy's high estimation of herself was well known.  Although it seemed as if it never would, the luncheon at last came to an end.  Mrs. Maynard told the children they might be excused, and she and Miss Larkin would chat by themselves.  Decorously enough, the four left the room, but once outside the house, King gave a wild whoop of joy and turned a double somersault.  Midget threw herself down on a veranda-seat, but with a beaming face, she said:  \"Well, we behaved all right, anyway; but I was 'most afraid I'd be saucy to her one time. It's _such_ a temptation, when people talk like that.\"  \"She talked all the time,\" said Kitty. \"I don't see when she ate anything.\"  \"She didn't,\" said King. \"I suppose she'd rather talk than eat. She's not a bit like us.\"  \"No,\" said Marjorie, emphatically, \"she's not a bit like us!\"     CHAPTER III  PICNIC PLANS   One entire day out of each month Mr. Maynard devoted to the entertainment of his children.  This was a long-established custom, and the children looked forward eagerly to what they called an Ourday.  The day chosen was always a Saturday, and usually the first Saturday of the month, though this was subject to the convenience of the elders.  The children were allowed to choose in turn what the entertainment should be, and if possible their wishes were complied with.  As there had been so much bustle and confusion consequent upon their return from the summer vacation, the September \"Ourday\" did not occur until the second Saturday.  It was Marjorie's turn to choose the sport, for, as she had been away at Grandma Sherwood's all summer, she had missed three Ourdays.  So one morning, early in the week, the matter was discussed at the breakfast table.  \"What shall it be, Midget?\" asked her father. \"A balloon trip, or an Arctic expedition?\"  Marjorie considered.  \"I want something outdoorsy,\" she said, at last, \"and I think I'd like a picnic best. A real picnic in the woods, with lunch-baskets, and a fire, and roasted potatoes.\"  \"That sounds all right to me,\" said Mr. Maynard; \"do you want a lot of people, or just ourselves?\"  It was at the children's pleasure on Ourdays to invite their young friends or to have only the family, as they chose. Sometimes, even, Mrs. Maynard did not go with them, and Mr. Maynard took his young brood off for a ramble in the woods, or a day at the seashore or in the city. He often declared that but for this plan he would never feel really acquainted with his own children.  \"I don't want a lot of people,\" said Marjorie, decidedly; \"but suppose we each invite one. That makes a good-sized picnic.\"  As it was Marjorie's Ourday, her word was law, and the others gladly agreed.  \"I'll ask Dick Fulton,\" said Kingdon. \"I haven't seen much of him since I came home.\"  \"And I'll ask Gladys Fulton, of course,\" said Midget. As Gladys was her most intimate friend in Rockwell, no one was surprised at this.  \"I'll ask Dorothy Adams,\" said Kitty; but Rosy Posy announced: \"I won't ask nobody but Boffin. He's the nicest person I know, an' him an' me can walk with Daddy.\"  \"Next, where shall the picnic be?\" went on Mr. Maynard.  \"I don't know whether I like Pike's Woods best, or the Mill Race,\" said Marjorie, uncertainly.  \"Oh, choose Pike's Woods, Mops,\" put in Kingdon. \"It's lovely there, now, and it's a lot"]]]
