I hied me to \"The Monastery\" and devoured everything of Sir Walter's except \"Saint Ronan's Well.\" That never seemed worthy of the great Sir Walter. \"The Black Dwarf\" and \"Anne of Geierstein\" were rather tough reading, and \"Count Robert of Paris\" might have been written by Lord Bacon, if Lord Bacon had been a contemporary of Sir Walter's. \"Peveril of the Peak\" and \"Ivanhoe\" and \"Bride of Lammermoor\" again and again dazzled and consoled me until I discovered \"Nicholas Nickleby.\"  \"Nicholas Nickleby\" took entire possession of me. In the rainy winter afternoons, when nothing could occur out of doors which a respectable city boy was permitted to indulge in, I found that I was expected to work. Boys worked hard at their lessons in those days. There was a kitchen downstairs with a Dutch oven not used in the winter. There it was easy to build a small fire and to toast bread and to read \"Nicholas Nickleby\" after one had rushed through the required tasks, which generally included ten pages of the \"Historia Sacra\" in Latin. If you never read \"Nicholas Nickleby\" when you were young, you cannot possibly know the flavour of Dickens. You can't laugh now as you laughed then. Oh, the delight of Mr. Crummles's description of his wife's dignified manner of standing with her head on a spear!  The tragedy in \"Nicholas Nickleby\" never appealed to me. It was necessary to skip that. When the people were gentlemanly and ladylike, they became great bores. But what young reader of Dickens can forget the hostile attitude of Mr. Lillyvick, great-uncle of the little Miss Kenwigses, when Nicholas attempted to teach them French? As one grows older, even Mr. Squeers and 'Tilda give one less real delight; but think of the first discovery of them, and it is like Balboa's--or was it Cortez's?--discovery of the Pacific in Keats's sonnet. \"Nicholas Nickleby\" was read over and over again, with unfailing pleasure. I found \"Little Dorrit\" rather tiresome; \"Barnaby Rudge\" and \"A Tale of Two Cities\" seemed to be rather serious reading, not quite Dickensish enough for my taste, yet better than anything else that anybody had written. My later impressions of Dickens modified these instinctive intuitions.  One day, a set of Thackeray arrived, little green volumes, as I remember, and I began to read \"Vanity Fair.\" My mother seized it and read it aloud again. Her confessor had told her that a dislike for good novels was \"Puritan\" and she, shocked by the implied reproach, took again to novel reading. I am afraid that I disliked Colonel Dobbin and Amelia very much. Becky Sharp pleased me beyond words; I don't think that the morality of the case affected my point of view at all. I was delighted whenever Becky \"downed\" an enemy. They were such a lot of stupid people--the enemies--and I reflected during the course of the story that, after all, Thackeray had said that poor Becky had no mother to guide her footsteps. When the Marquis of Steyne was hit on the forehead with the diamonds, I thought it served him right; but I was unhappy because poor Becky had lost the jewels. In finishing the book with those lovely Thackerayan cadences, my mother said severely, \"That is what always happens to bad people!\" But in my heart I did not believe that Becky Sharp was a bad person at all.  For a time I returned to Dickens, to \"Nicholas Nickleby,\" to \"David Copperfield.\" I respected Thackeray. He had gripped me in some way that I could not explain. But Dickens I loved. Later--it was on one June afternoon I think--when the news of Dickens's death arrived, it seemed to me that for a while all delight in life had ended.  One of those experts in psychology who are always seeking questions sometime ago wrote to me demanding if \"Plutarch's Lives\" had influenced me, and whether I thought they were good reading for the young. Our \"Plutarch\" was rather appalling to look at. It was bound in mottled cardboard, and the pages had red edges; but I attacked it one day, when I was about ten years of age, and became enthralled. It was \"actual.\" My mother was a veteran politician, and read a daily paper, with Southern tendencies called the _Age_; my father belonged to the opposite party, and admired Senator Hoar as greatly as my mother admired the famous Vallandigham. Between the two, I had formed a very poor opinion of American statesmen in general; but the statesmen in \"Plutarch\" were of a very different type.  Julius Cæsar interested me; but Brutus filled me with exaltation. I had not then read Shakespeare's \"Julius Cæsar.\" It seemed to me that Brutus was a model for all time. Now, understand I was a good Christian child, and I said my prayers every night and morning, but this did not prevent me from hating the big bully of the school, who made the lives of the ten or fifteen small boys a perpetual torment. How we suffered, no adult human tongue can tell--and our tongues never told because it was a convention that tales should not be told out of school. One of the pleasant tricks of the bully and his friends was to chase the little boys after school in the winter and bury them until they were almost suffocated in the snow which was piled up in the narrow streets. It was not only suffocating snow, but it was dirty snow. It happened that I had been presented with a penknife consisting of two rather leaden blades covered with a brilliant iridescent mother-of-pearl handle. The bully wanted this knife, and I knew it. Generally, I left it at home; but it occurred to me on one inspired morning, after I had read \"Plutarch\" the night before, that I would display the knife open in my pocket, and when he threw the full weight of his body upon me, I would kill him at once, by an upward thrust of the knife.  This struck me as a good deed entirely worthy of Brutus. Of course, I knew that I should be hanged, but then I expected the glory of making a last dying speech, and, besides, the school would have a holiday. On the morning preceding the great sacrifice, I gave out dark hints to the small boys, distributed my various belongings to friends who were about to be bereaved, and predicted a coming holiday. I was looked on as rather \"crazy,\" but I reflected that I would soon be considered heroic, and my friends gladly accepted the gifts.  The fatal afternoon came. I displayed the penknife. The chase began. The bully and his chosen friends threw themselves upon me. The moment had come; I thrust the knife upward; the big boy uttered a howl, and ran, still howling. I looked for blood, but there was none visible; I came to the conclusion, with satisfaction, that he was bleeding internally. I spent a gloomy evening at home uttering dire predictions which were incomprehensible to the members of my family, and reread Brutus, in the \"Lives.\"  The next morning I went to school with lessons unstudied and awaited events. The mother of the bully appeared, and entered into an excited colloquy with the very placid and dignified teacher. I announced to the boy next to me, \"My time has come.\" I was called up to the awful desk. \"Is he dead?\" I asked. \"Did he bleed internally?\" \"You little wretch,\" the mother of the tyrant said, \"you cut such fearful holes in my son's coat, that he is afraid to come to school to-day!\" Then I said, regretfully, \"Oh, I hoped that I had killed him.\" There was a sensation; my character was blackened. I was set down as a victim of total depravity; I endured it all, but I knew in my heart that it was \"Plutarch.\" This is the effect that \"Plutarch\" had on the mind of a good Christian child.  The effects of \"Plutarch\" on my character were never discovered at home, and as I grew older and learned one or two wrestling tricks, the bully let me alone. Besides, my murderous intention, which had leaked out, gave me such a reputation that I became a dictator myself, and made terms for the small boys, in the name of freedom, which were sometimes rather despotic.  It was also during these days that I remember carrying confusion into the family when a patronizing, intellectual lady called and said, \"I hope that this dear little boy is reading the Rollo books?\" \"No,\" I answered quickly and indiscreetly, \"I am reading 'The New Magdalen,' by Wilkie Collins.\" I did not think much of Wilkie Collins until I read \"The Moonstone.\" It seemed that \"The New Magdalen\" had been purchased inadvertently by my father, in a packet of \"classics.\"  My father generally arrived at home late in the afternoon, when he read the evening paper. After a very high tea, he stretched himself on a long horsehair-covered sofa, and bade me read to him, generally from the novels of George Eliot, or from certain romances running through the New York _Ledger_ by Sylvanus Cobb, Jr. These were generally stories of the times of the Irish Kings, in which gallowglasses and lovely and aristocratic Celtic maidens disported themselves. My mother, after her conversion, disapproved of the New York _Ledger_. In fact, there were families in Philadelphia whose heads regarded it with real horror! In our house, there was a large stack of this interesting periodical, which, with many volumes of Godey's _Lady's Book_, were packed in the attic.  It happened that a young man, in whom my father had a great interest, was threatened with tuberculosis. An awful rumour was set abroad that he was about to die. He sent over a messenger asking my father for the back numbers of the New York _Ledger_ containing a long serial story by Mrs. Anna Cora Mowatt. As I remember, it was a story of the French Revolution, and the last number that I was allowed to read ended with a description of a dance in an old château, when the Marquise, who was floating through the minuet, suddenly discovered blood on the white-kid glove of her right hand! I was never permitted to discover where the blood came"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24003"],["title","Confessions of a Book-Lover (#3)"],["body","m; I should like to find out now if I could find the novel. I remember that my mother was terribly shocked when my father sent the numbers of the New York _Ledger_ to the apparently dying man. \"It's a horrible thing,\" my mother said, \"to think of any Christian person reading the New York _Ledger_ at the point of death.\" The young man, however, did not die; and I rather think my father attributed his recovery to the exhilarating effect of one of his favourite stories.  There were certain other serial stories I was ordered to read; they were stories of the Irish Brigade in France. My mother, I remember, disapproved of them because Madame de Pompadour was frequently mentioned, and she thought that my father regarded the lady in question too tolerantly. These romances were, I think, written by a certain Myles O'Reilly who was in some way connected with the army. This procedure of reading aloud was not always agreeable, as my father frequently went to sleep in the middle of a passage and forgot what I had already read. The consequence was that I was obliged to begin the same old story over again on the following evening.  It happened that my father was one of the directors of a local library, and in it I found Bates's volume on the Amazon--I forget the exact title of the book. I found myself in a new world; I lived in Para; I tried to manufacture an imitation of the Urari poison with a view to exterminating rats in the warehouse by the use of arrows; I lived and had my being in the forests of Brazil; and I produced, at intervals, a thrilling novel, with the glowing atmosphere of the Amazon as a background. I preferred Mr. Bates to any novelist I had ever read. He held possession of my imagination, until he was forced out by a Mr. Jerningham who wrote a most entrancing book on Brittany. Saint Malo became the only town for me; I adored Henri de la Rochejaquelein; and the Stuarts, whom I had learned to love at the knees of Sir Walter Scott, were displaced by the Vendéans.  Noticing that I was devoted to books of travel, my father asked me to parse Kane's \"Arctic Voyages.\" I found the volumes cold and repellent. They gave me a rooted prejudice against the North Pole which even the adventure of Doctor Cook has never enabled me to overcome.  About this time, my mother began to feel that I needed to read something more gentle, which would root me more effectively in my religion. She began, I think, with Cardinal Newman's \"Callista\" in which there was a thrilling chapter called \"The Possession of Juba.\" It seemed to me one of the most stirring things I had ever read. Then I was presented with Mrs. Sadlier's \"The Blakes and the Flanagans,\" which struck me as a very delightful satire, and with a really interesting novel of New York called \"Rosemary,\" by Dr. J. V. Huntington; and then a terribly blood-curdling story of the Carbonari in Italy, called \"Lionello.\" After this I was wafted into a series of novels by Julia Kavanagh; \"Natalie,\" and \"Bessie,\" and \"Seven Years,\" I think were the principals. My father declined to read them; he thought they were too sentimental, but as the author had an Irish name he was inclined to regard them with tolerance. He thought I would be better employed in absorbing \"Tom and Jerry; or The Adventures of Corinthian Bob,\" by Pierce Egan. My mother objected to this, and substituted \"Lady Violet; or the Wonder of Kingswood Chace,\" by the younger Pierce Egan, which she considered more moral.  My father was very generous at Christmas, and I bought a large volume of Froissart for two dollars and a half at an old book stand on Fifth Street, near Spruce. After this, I was lost to the world during the Christmas holidays. After breakfast, I saturated myself with the delightful battles in that precious book.  My principal duty was to look after the front pavement. In the spring and summer, it was carefully washed twice a week and reddened with some kind of paint, which always accompanied a box of fine white sand for the scouring of the marble steps; but in the winter, this respectable sidewalk had to be kept free from snow and ice.  Hitherto my battle with the elements had been rather a diversion. Besides, I was in competition with the other small boys in the block--or in the \"square,\" as we Philadelphians called it. Now it became irksome; I neglected to dig the ice from between the bricks; I skimped my cleaning of the gutter; I forgot to put on my \"gums.\" The boy next door became a mirror of virtue; he was quoted to me as one whose pavement was a model to all the neighbours; indeed, it was rumoured that the Mayor passing down our street, had stopped and admired the working of his civic spirit, while the result of my efforts was passed by with evident contempt. I did not care. I hugged Froissart to my heart. Who would condescend to wield a broom and a wooden shovel, even for the reward of ten cents in cash, when he could throw javelins and break lances with the knights of the divine Froissart? The end of my freedom came after this. The terrible incident of the Mayor's contempt, invented, I believe, by the boy next door, induced my mother to believe that I was not only losing my morals, but becoming too much of a book-worm. For many long weeks I was deprived of any amusing book except \"Robinson Crusoe.\" After this interval, vacation came; I seemed to have grown older, and books were never quite the same again.  In the vacation, however, when the days were very long and there was a great deal of leisure, I found myself reduced to Grimms' \"Fairy Tales\" and a delightful volume by Madame Perrault, and I was even then very much struck by the difference. Of course I read Grimm from cover to cover, and went back again over the pages, hoping that I had neglected something. The homeliness of the stories touched me; it seemed to me that you found yourself in the atmosphere of old Germany. Madame Perrault was more delicate; her fairy tales were pictures of no life that ever existed, and there was a great dissimilarity between her \"Cendrillon\" and the Grimms' story of \"Aschenputtel.\" As I remember, the haughty sisters in the story of the beautiful girl who lived among the ashes each cut off one of her toes, in order to make her feet seem smaller and left bloody marks on the glass slipper. Madame Perrault's slipper was, I think, of white fur, and there was no such brutality in _her_ fairyland. But, except Hans Christian Andersen's, there are no such gripping fairy tales as those of the Brethren Grimm. During this vacation, too, I discovered the \"Leprachaun,\" the little Irish fairy with the hammer. He was not at all like the English fairies in Shakespeare's \"Midsummer Night's Dream,\" and, leaving out Ariel, I think I liked him best of all.  That summer, too, I found an old copy of \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" in the attic. The print was exceedingly fine, but everything was there. No doubt there is much to be said by the pedagogues in favour of scrupulously studying Shakespeare's plays; but if you have never discovered \"As You Like It\" or \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" when you were very young, you will never know the meaning of that light which never was on land or sea, and with which Keats surrounds us in the \"Ode to the Nightingale.\" The love interest did not count much. In my youthful experience everybody either married or died, in books. That was to be expected. It was the atmosphere that counted. One could see the troopers coming into the open space in the Forest of Arden and hear their songs, making the leaves of the trees quiver before they appeared. And Puck! and Caliban! When I was young I was always very sorry for Caliban, and, being very religious, I felt that the potent Prospero might have done something for his soul.  There was a boy who lived near us called Lawrence Stockdale--peace be to his ashes where-ever he rests! His father and mother, who were persons of cultivation, encouraged him to read, but we were not of one opinion on any subject. He was devoted to Dumas, the Elder. After the episode of \"Monte Cristo\" I was led to believe that Dumas was \"wrong.\" I preferred Sir Walter Scott, and loved all the Stuarts, having a positive devotion for Mary, Queen of Scots. One day, however, I discovered somewhere, under a pile of old geometries and books about navigation, a fat, red-bound copy of \"Boccaccio.\" Stockdale said that \"Boccaccio\" was \"wronger\" than Dumas, and that his people had warned him against the stories of this Italian. As we lived near an Italian colony, and he disliked Italians, while I loved them, I attributed this to mere prejudice.  The \"Boccaccio\" was, as I have said, fat and large. For a boy who likes to read, a fat book is very tempting, and just as I had seated myself one afternoon on the front doorstep, to read the story of the Falcon, and having finished it with great pleasure, dipped into another tale not so edifying, my mother appeared. She turned pale with horror, and seized the book at once. My father was informed of what had occurred. He was little alarmed, I think. My mother said: \"We shall have to change the whole course of this boy's reading.\" \"We shall have to change the boy first,\" my father said, with a sigh. But this was not the end. At the proper time I was led to the Pastor, who was my mother's confessor. The book was presented to him for destruction.  \"It's a bad book,\" the Monsignore said. \"I hope you didn't talk about any of these stories to the other boys in school?\"  \"Oh, no,\" I said; \"if I did, they would say much worse things, and I would probably have to tell them in confession. Besides,\" I added, \"all the people in the Boccaccio book were good Catholics, I suppose, as they were Italians, and I think, after all, when they caught the plague, they died good deaths.\"  The Pastor looked puzzled, took the book, and gave me his blessing and dismissed me. And my mother seemed to think that I was sufficiently exorcised.  After this the books I read were more carefully"]]]
