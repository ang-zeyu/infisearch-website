If he desired to leave them alone, what was to prevent him riding off and obliging every one of his warriors to go with him?  This was the question which Melville continually asked himself, and which he could not answer as he wished, being unable to drive away the belief that the chief was acting a double part.  The Sioux had reached some decision; for, on the return of the one who failed to secure Saladin, they ceased disputing, and rode towards the window from which Melville was watching them.  Their ponies were on a slow walk, and the expression on their forbidding faces was plainly seen as their eyes ranged over the front of the building. The youth had withdrawn, so as to stand out of range; but, to end the doubt in his mind, he now stepped out in full view of every one of the warriors.  [Illustration: \"Melville had warning enough to leap back.\"]  The doubt was removed at once. Previous to this the lad had raised the lower sash, so as to give him the chance to fire, and as he stood, his waist and shoulders were in front of the upper part of the glass. It so happened that Red Feather and one of his warriors were looking at the very window at which he appeared. Like a flash both guns went to their shoulders and were discharged.  [Illustration: \"He pointed his own weapon outward, and fired.\"]  But Melville had enough warning to leap back, as the jingle and crash of glass showed how well the miscreants had aimed. Stirred to the deepest anger, he pointed his own weapon outward and fired into the party, doing so with such haste that he really took no aim at all.  It is not likely that his bullet had gone anywhere near the Sioux, but it had served the purpose of warning them that he was as much in earnest as themselves.  Melville placed a cartridge in the breech of his rifle with as much coolness as a veteran, and prepared himself for what he believed was to be a desperate defence of himself and sister.  It must not be thought that he was in despair; for, when he came to look over the situation, he found much to encourage him. In the first place, although besieged by a half-dozen fierce Sioux, he was sure the siege could not last long. Whatever they did must be done within a few hours.  While it was impossible to tell the hour when his parents started from Barwell, it must have been quite early in the morning, and there was every reason to hope they would reach the settlement by noon at the latest. The moment they did so they would learn that Melville had left long before for home, and therefore had taken the upper trail, since, had he not done so, the parties would have met on the road.  True, Mr. Clarendon would feel strong hope that his son, being so well mounted, would wheel about and follow without delay the counsel in the letter; but he was too shrewd to rely fully on such hope. What could be more certain than that he would instantly gather a party of friends and set out to their relief?  The great dread of the youth was that the Sioux would set fire to the buildings, and he wondered many times that this was not done at the time Red Feather learned of the flight of the family.  Melville glanced at Dot, and, seeing she was asleep, he decided to go downstairs and make a fuller examination of the means of defence.  \"Everything seems to be as secure as it can be,\" he said, standing in the middle of the room and looking around; \"that door has already been tried, and found not wanting. The only other means of entrance is through the windows, and after Red Feather's experience I am sure neither he nor any of his warriors will try _that_.\"  There were four windows--two at the front and two at the rear--all of the same shape and size. There was but the single door, of which so much has already been said, and therefore the lower portion of the building could not be made safer.  The stone chimney, so broad at the base that it was more than half as wide as the side of the outside wall, was built of stone, and rose a half-dozen feet above the roof. It was almost entirely out of doors, but was solid and strong.  \"If the Indians were not such lazy people,\" said Melville--looking earnestly at the broad fire-place, in front of which stood the new-fashioned stove--\"they might set to work and take down the chimney, but I don't think there is much danger of _that_.\"  He had hardly given expression to the thought when he fancied he heard a slight noise on the outside, and close to the chimney itself. He stepped forward, and held his ear to the stones composing the walls of the fire-place.  Still the sounds were faint, and he then touched his ear against them, knowing that solid substances are much better conductors of sound than air. He now detected the noise more plainly, but it was still so faint that he could not identify it.  He was still striving hard to do so when, to his amazement, Dot called him from above-stairs--  \"Where are you, Mel? Is that you that I can hear crawling about over the roof?\"     CHAPTER FIVE  A STRANGE VISIT--OMINOUS SIGNS   Melville Clarendon went up the short stairs three steps at a time, startled as much by the call of his sister as by anything that had taken place since the siege of the cabin began.  As he entered the room he saw Dot sitting up in bed, and staring wonderingly at the shivered window-glass, particles of which lay all around.  \"Oh, Mel!\" said she, \"papa will scold you for doing that; how came you to do it?\"  \"It was the bad Indians who fired through the window at me, and I fired at them: you were sleeping so soundly that you only half awoke; but you must keep still a few minutes longer.\"  \"I thought that was you on the roof,\" she added, in a lower voice.  That there was someone overhead was certain. The rasping sound of a person moving carefully along the peak of the roof was audible. The lad understood the meaning of that which puzzled him when on the lower floor: one of the warriors was carefully climbing the chimney--a task not difficult, because of its rough uneven formation.  The significance of such a strange act remained to be seen. It appeared unlikely that any of the Sioux were daring enough to attempt a descent of the chimney; but that such was really his purpose became clear within the following minute.  The Indian, after making his way a short distance along the peak, returned to the chimney, where, from the noises which reached the listening ones, it was manifest that he was actually making his way down the flue, broad enough to admit the passage of a larger body than himself.  \"I won't be caught foul _this_ time,\" said Melville, turning to descend the stairs again; \"Dot, stay right where you are on the bed till I come back or call to you.\"  She promised to obey, and there could be no doubt that she would do so.  \"They must think I'm stupid,\" muttered the youth, taking his position in the middle of the room, with his rifle cocked and ready for instant use; \"but they will find out the idiot is some one else.\"  He had not long to wait when in the large open space at the back of the stove appeared a pair of moccasins groping vaguely about for support. The pipe from the stove, instead of passing directly up the chimney, entered it by means of an elbow. Had it been otherwise, the daring warrior would have found himself in a bad fix on arriving at the bottom.  It would have been idle for the young man standing on the watch to fire at the feet or legs, and he waited an instant, when the Indian dropped lightly on his feet, and, without the least hesitation, stepped forward in the apartment and confronted Melville.  The latter was dumbfounded, for the first glance at his face showed that he was the chieftain Red Feather, the Indian whom of all others he least expected to see.  The act of the savage was without any possible explanation to the astonished youth, who, recoiling a step, stared at him, and uttered the single exclamation--  \"Red Feather!\"  \"Howly do, broder?\" was the salutation of the Sioux, whose dusky face showed just the faintest smile.  Red Feather's descent of the chimney had not been without some disagreeable features. His blanket and garments, never very tidy, were covered with soot, enough of which had got on his face to suggest that he had adopted the usual means of his people to show they were on the war-path.  [Illustration: \"A pair of moccasins groping vaguely about for support.\"]  His knife and tomahawk were thrust in his girdle at his waist, and throughout this laborious task he had held his rifle fast, so that he was fully armed.  \"Howly do?\" he repeated, extending his hand, which Melville was too prudent to accept.  \"No,\" he replied, compressing his lips, and keeping his finger on the trigger of his gun, \"Red Feather speaks with a double tongue; he is not our friend.\"  \"Red Feather been bad Injin--want white folks' scalp--don't want 'em now--little pappoose pray to Great Spirit--_dat_ make Red Feather feel bad--he hab pappoose--he lub Injin pappoose--lub white pappoose--much lub white pappoose.\"  This remark shed light upon the singular incident. To Melville it was a mystery beyond understanding that any person could look upon the sweet innocent face of Dot without loving her. Knowing how vile an Indian Red Feather had been, it was yet a question with the youth whether he could find it in his heart to wish ill to his wee bit of a sister.  Was it unreasonable, therefore, to believe that this savage warrior had been touched by the sight of the little one on her knees, with her hands clasped in prayer, and by her eagerness to keep away all harm from him?  This theory helped to explain what took place after the release of Red Feather from his odd imprisonment. The five warriors whom he had brought with him upon his raid must have combated his proposal to leave the children unharmed. In the face of his savage overbearing disposition they had fought his wish to keep the pledge to them, while he as firmly insisted upon its fulfilment.  But if such"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24097"],["title","The Story of Red Feather: A Tale of the American Frontier (#6)"],["body","the fact, how could his descent of the chimney be explained?  Melville did not try to explain it, for he had no time just then to speculate upon it; the explanation would come shortly.  The youth, however, was too wise to act upon that which he hoped was the truth. He had retreated nearly to the other side of the room, where he maintained the same defiant attitude as at first.  Red Feather read the distrust in his face and manner. With a deliberation that was not lacking in dignity, he walked slowly to the corner of the apartment, Melville closely following him with his eye, and leaned his gun against the logs. Then he drew his knife and tomahawk from his girdle, and threw them on the floor beside the more valuable weapon. That done, he moved back to the fire-place, folded his arms, and, fixing his black eyes on the countenance of the lad, repeated--\"Red Feather friend of white folk.\"  \"I believe you,\" responded Melville, carefully letting down the hammer of his rifle and resting the stock on the floor; \"now I am glad to shake hands with you.\"  A broader smile than before lit up the dusky face as the chief warmly pressed the hand of the youth, who felt just a little trepidation when their palms met.  \"Where pappoose?\" asked Red Feather, looking suggestively at the steps leading to the upper story.  \"Dot!\" called Melville, \"come down here; someone wants to see you.\"  The patter of feet was heard, and the next instant the little one came tripping downstairs, with her doll clasped by one arm to her breast.  \"Red Feather is a good Indian now, and he wants to shake hands with you.\"  With a faint blush and a sweet smile Dot ran across the floor and held out her tiny hand. The chieftain stooped, and not only took the palm of the little girl, but placed each of his own under her shoulders and lifted her from the floor. Straightening up, he touched his dusky lips to those of the innocent one, murmuring, with a depth of emotion which cannot be described--  \"Red Feather lub white pappoose--she make him good Injin--he be her friend always.\"  The chieftain touched his lips but once to those of the little one, who showed no hesitation in accepting the salute. Pure, innocent, and good herself, she had not yet learned how evil the human heart may become.  Not only did she receive the salute willingly, but threw her free arm around the neck of the Indian and gave him a kiss.  \"Red Feather, what made you come down the chimney?\" questioned Melville when the Indian had released his sister.  \"Can't come oder way,\" was the instant response.  \"True; but why do you want to enter this house?\"  \"Be friend of white folk--come tell 'em.\"  \"I am sure of that; but what can you do for us?\"  Red Feather gave no direct answer to this question, but walked upstairs. As he did so he left every one of his weapons on the lower floor, and by a glance cast over his shoulder expressed the wish that the brother and sister should follow him. They did so, Dot tripping ahead, while Melville retained his weapons.  Reaching the upper floor, the Sioux walked directly to the window through which the shots had come that shattered the two panes of glass.  There was a curious smile on his swarthy face as he pointed at the pane on the left, and said--  \"Red Feather fire _dat!_\"  The explanation of his remark was that had Melville kept his place in front of the window at the moment the rifles were discharged, only one of the bullets would have hit him, and that would have been the one which Red Feather did not fire.  [Illustration: \"'She make him good Injin--he be her friend always.'\"--Page 51]  The shot which he sent into the apartment, and which filled the youth with so much indignation, had been fired for the purpose of making the other warriors believe the chieftain was as bitter an enemy of the brother and sister as he was of all white people.  Having convinced his followers on this point, he made his position still stronger with them by declaring his purpose of descending the chimney, and having it out with them, or rather with the lad, within the building.  Red Feather peered out of the window, taking care that none of his warriors saw him, though they must have felt a strong curiosity to learn the result of his strange effort to overcome the little garrison. Melville supposed that he had arranged to communicate with them by signal, for the result of the attempt must be settled quickly.  The youth took the liberty of peeping forth from the other window on the same side of the house.  Only two of the Sioux were in their field of vision, and their actions did not show that they felt much concern for their chief. They were mounted on their horses, and riding at a walk towards the elevations from which Red Feather had waved his blanket to the brother and sister when on the other side of the stream.  Melville's first thought was that they had decided to leave the place, but that hope was quickly dispelled by the action of the warriors. At the highest point of the hill they checked their ponies, and sat for a minute gazing fixedly to the northward in the direction of the settlement.  \"They are looking for our friends,\" thought the youth, \"but I am afraid they will not be in sight for a good while to come.\"  At this juncture one of the warriors deliberately rose to a standing position on the back of his pony, and turned his gaze to the westward.  \"Now they are looking for _their_ friends,\" was the correct conclusion of Melville, \"and I am afraid they see them; yes, there is no doubt of it.\"  The warrior, in assuming his delicate position, passed his rifle to his companion, whose horse was beside him. Then, with his two hands free, he drew his blanket from around his shoulders and began waving it, as Red Feather had done earlier in the day.  Melville glanced across at Red Feather, who was attentively watching the performance. He saw the countenance grow more forbidding, while a scowl settled on his brow.  It was easy to translate all this. The Sioux had caught sight of some of their friends, and signalled them. This would not have been done had there not been some person or persons to observe it.  The party which the chieftain had described as being in the Muddy Creek country must have changed their course and hastened to join Red Feather and the smaller party. If such were the fact, they would arrive on the spot within a brief space of time.  The interesting question arose whether, in the event of such arrival, and the attack that was sure to follow, Red Feather would come out as open defender of the children against his own people. Had there been only the five original warriors, he might have played a part something akin to neutrality, on the ground that his descent of the chimney had turned out ill for him, and, being caught at disadvantage he was held idle under the threat of instant death. Still further, it might have been his province to assume the character of hostage, and thus to defeat the overthrow of the couple by the Sioux.  But the arrival of the larger party would change everything. Among the Muddy Creek band were several who disliked Red Feather intensely enough to be glad of a chance to help his discomfiture.  He had agreed that, in the event of his surprising the lad who was making such a brave defence, he would immediately appear at the front window and announce it, after which he would unbar the door and admit the warriors to the \"last scene of all.\"  [Illustration: \"'Let the Sioux send more of his warriors down the chimney!'\"]  Several minutes had now passed, and no such announcement was made. The other three Sioux were lingering near the building, awaiting the signal which came not.  While the two were engaged on the crest of the hill the others suddenly came round in front of the house. They were on foot, and looked inquiringly at the windows, as if at a loss to understand the cause of the silence. Red Feather instantly drew back, and said in a low voice to Melville--  \"Speak to Injin--dem tink Red Feather lose scalp.\"  Grasping the situation, the youth showed himself at the window, where the Sioux were sure to see him, and uttered a tantalizing shout.  \"Let the Sioux send more of their warriors down the chimney!\" he called out; \"the white youth is waiting for them, that he may take their scalps.\"  This was followed by another shout, as the lad withdrew beyond reach of a rifle-ball, that left no doubt of its meaning on the minds of the astounded warriors.     CHAPTER SIX  THE MUDDY CREEK BAND--THE TORCH   It was easy for any spectator to interpret the actions and signals of the Sioux warrior who was standing erect on his pony and waving his blanket at some party invisible to the others.  After a minute or two he rested, with the blanket trailing beside him, while he still held his erect position, and continued gazing earnestly over the prairie. This showed that he was waiting for an answer to his signal. Either there was none, or that which was given was not satisfactory, for up went the blanket once more, and he swung it more vigorously than before, stopping and gazing away again.  This time the reply was what was desired, for the warrior dropped as suddenly astride of his horse as though his feet had been knocked from under him, and, wheeling about, he and his companion galloped down the hill to where the others were viewing the cabin.  The taunting words which Melville had called through the front window must have convinced the Sioux that the pitcher had gone once too often to the fountain. Red Feather had escaped by a wonderful piece of good fortune when wedged in the window, and had been encouraged to another attempt, which ended in his ruin.  \"Red Feather,\" said Melville, stepping close to the chieftain, who was still peering through one of the windows, \"the other Sioux will soon be here.\"  \"Dat so--dat so,\" replied the Indian, looking around at him and nodding his head several times.  \"What will they do?\"  [Illustration: \"Standing"]]]
