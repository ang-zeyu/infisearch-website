His limbs were convulsed and his fingers contorted as though he had died in a very paroxysm of fear.  He was fully clothed, though there were signs that his dressing had been done in a hurry.  We had already learned that his bed had been slept in, and that the tragic end had come to him in the early morning.  One realized the red-hot energy which underlay Holmes's phlegmatic exterior when one saw the sudden change which came over him from the moment that he entered the fatal apartment.  In an instant he was tense and alert, his eyes shining, his face set, his limbs quivering with eager activity.  He was out on the lawn, in through the window, round the room, and up into the bedroom, for all the world like a dashing foxhound drawing a cover.  In the bedroom he made a rapid cast around and ended by throwing open the window, which appeared to give him some fresh cause for excitement, for he leaned out of it with loud ejaculations of interest and delight.  Then he rushed down the stair, out through the open window, threw himself upon his face on the lawn, sprang up and into the room once more, all with the energy of the hunter who is at the very heels of his quarry.  The lamp, which was an ordinary standard, he examined with minute care, making certain measurements upon its bowl.  He carefully scrutinized with his lens the talc shield which covered the top of the chimney and scraped off some ashes which adhered to its upper surface, putting some of them into an envelope, which he placed in his pocketbook.  Finally, just as the doctor and the official police put in an appearance, he beckoned to the vicar and we all three went out upon the lawn.  \"I am glad to say that my investigation has not been entirely barren,\" he remarked.  \"I cannot remain to discuss the matter with the police, but I should be exceedingly obliged, Mr. Roundhay, if you would give the inspector my compliments and direct his attention to the bedroom window and to the sitting-room lamp.  Each is suggestive, and together they are almost conclusive.  If the police would desire further information I shall be happy to see any of them at the cottage.  And now, Watson, I think that, perhaps, we shall be better employed elsewhere.\"  It may be that the police resented the intrusion of an amateur, or that they imagined themselves to be upon some hopeful line of investigation; but it is certain that we heard nothing from them for the next two days.  During this time Holmes spent some of his time smoking and dreaming in the cottage; but a greater portion in country walks which he undertook alone, returning after many hours without remark as to where he had been.  One experiment served to show me the line of his investigation.  He had bought a lamp which was the duplicate of the one which had burned in the room of Mortimer Tregennis on the morning of the tragedy.  This he filled with the same oil as that used at the vicarage, and he carefully timed the period which it would take to be exhausted. Another experiment which he made was of a more unpleasant nature, and one which I am not likely ever to forget.  \"You will remember, Watson,\" he remarked one afternoon, \"that there is a single common point of resemblance in the varying reports which have reached us.  This concerns the effect of the atmosphere of the room in each case upon those who had first entered it.  You will recollect that Mortimer Tregennis, in describing the episode of his last visit to his brother's house, remarked that the doctor on entering the room fell into a chair? You had forgotten?  Well I can answer for it that it was so. Now, you will remember also that Mrs. Porter, the housekeeper, told us that she herself fainted upon entering the room and had afterwards opened the window.  In the second case--that of Mortimer Tregennis himself--you cannot have forgotten the horrible stuffiness of the room when we arrived, though the servant had thrown open the window.  That servant, I found upon inquiry, was so ill that she had gone to her bed. You will admit, Watson, that these facts are very suggestive.  In each case there is evidence of a poisonous atmosphere.  In each case, also, there is combustion going on in the room--in the one case a fire, in the other a lamp.  The fire was needed, but the lamp was lit--as a comparison of the oil consumed will show--long after it was broad daylight.  Why?  Surely because there is some connection between three things--the burning, the stuffy atmosphere, and, finally, the madness or death of those unfortunate people.  That is clear, is it not?\"  \"It would appear so.\"  \"At least we may accept it as a working hypothesis.  We will suppose, then, that something was burned in each case which produced an atmosphere causing strange toxic effects.  Very good. In the first instance--that of the Tregennis family--this substance was placed in the fire.  Now the window was shut, but the fire would naturally carry fumes to some extent up the chimney.  Hence one would expect the effects of the poison to be less than in the second case, where there was less escape for the vapour.  The result seems to indicate that it was so, since in the first case only the woman, who had presumably the more sensitive organism, was killed, the others exhibiting that temporary or permanent lunacy which is evidently the first effect of the drug.  In the second case the result was complete.  The facts, therefore, seem to bear out the theory of a poison which worked by combustion.  \"With this train of reasoning in my head I naturally looked about in Mortimer Tregennis's room to find some remains of this substance.  The obvious place to look was the talc shelf or smoke-guard of the lamp. There, sure enough, I perceived a number of flaky ashes, and round the edges a fringe of brownish powder, which had not yet been consumed. Half of this I took, as you saw, and I placed it in an envelope.\"  \"Why half, Holmes?\"  \"It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the official police force.  I leave them all the evidence which I found.  The poison still remained upon the talc had they the wit to find it.  Now, Watson, we will light our lamp; we will, however, take the precaution to open our window to avoid the premature decease of two deserving members of society, and you will seat yourself near that open window in an armchair unless, like a sensible man, you determine to have nothing to do with the affair.  Oh, you will see it out, will you?  I thought I knew my Watson.  This chair I will place opposite yours, so that we may be the same distance from the poison and face to face.  The door we will leave ajar.  Each is now in a position to watch the other and to bring the experiment to an end should the symptoms seem alarming.  Is that all clear?  Well, then, I take our powder--or what remains of it--from the envelope, and I lay it above the burning lamp.  So!  Now, Watson, let us sit down and await developments.\"  They were not long in coming.  I had hardly settled in my chair before I was conscious of a thick, musky odour, subtle and nauseous.  At the very first whiff of it my brain and my imagination were beyond all control.  A thick, black cloud swirled before my eyes, and my mind told me that in this cloud, unseen as yet, but about to spring out upon my appalled senses, lurked all that was vaguely horrible, all that was monstrous and inconceivably wicked in the universe.  Vague shapes swirled and swam amid the dark cloud-bank, each a menace and a warning of something coming, the advent of some unspeakable dweller upon the threshold, whose very shadow would blast my soul.  A freezing horror took possession of me.  I felt that my hair was rising, that my eyes were protruding, that my mouth was opened, and my tongue like leather. The turmoil within my brain was such that something must surely snap. I tried to scream and was vaguely aware of some hoarse croak which was my own voice, but distant and detached from myself.  At the same moment, in some effort of escape, I broke through that cloud of despair and had a glimpse of Holmes's face, white, rigid, and drawn with horror--the very look which I had seen upon the features of the dead.  It was that vision which gave me an instant of sanity and of strength.  I dashed from my chair, threw my arms round Holmes, and together we lurched through the door, and an instant afterwards had thrown ourselves down upon the grass plot and were lying side by side, conscious only of the glorious sunshine which was bursting its way through the hellish cloud of terror which had girt us in. Slowly it rose from our souls like the mists from a landscape until peace and reason had returned, and we were sitting upon the grass, wiping our clammy foreheads, and looking with apprehension at each other to mark the last traces of that terrific experience which we had undergone.  \"Upon my word, Watson!\" said Holmes at last with an unsteady voice, \"I owe you both my thanks and an apology.  It was an unjustifiable experiment even for one's self, and doubly so for a friend.  I am really very sorry.\"  \"You know,\" I answered with some emotion, for I have never seen so much of Holmes's heart before, \"that it is my greatest joy and privilege to help you.\"  He relapsed at once into the half-humorous, half-cynical vein which was his habitual attitude to those about him.  \"It would be superfluous to drive us mad, my dear Watson,\" said he.  \"A candid observer would certainly declare that we were so already before we embarked upon so wild an experiment.  I confess that I never imagined that the effect could be so sudden and so severe.\"  He dashed into the cottage, and, reappearing with the burning lamp held at full arm's length, he threw it among a bank of brambles. \"We must give the room a little time to clear.  I take it, Watson, that you have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2349"],["title","The Adventure of the Devil's Foot (#4)"],["body"," longer a shadow of a doubt as to how these tragedies were produced?\"  \"None whatever.\"  \"But the cause remains as obscure as before.  Come into the arbour here and let us discuss it together.  That villainous stuff seems still to linger round my throat.  I think we must admit that all the evidence points to this man, Mortimer Tregennis, having been the criminal in the first tragedy, though he was the victim in the second one.  We must remember, in the first place, that there is some story of a family quarrel, followed by a reconciliation.  How bitter that quarrel may have been, or how hollow the reconciliation we cannot tell.   When I think of Mortimer Tregennis, with the foxy face and the small shrewd, beady eyes behind the spectacles, he is not a man whom I should judge to be of a particularly forgiving disposition. Well, in the next place, you will remember that this idea of someone moving in the garden, which took our attention for a moment from the real cause of the tragedy, emanated from him.  He had a motive in misleading us.  Finally, if he did not throw the substance into the fire at the moment of leaving the room, who did do so?  The affair happened immediately after his departure. Had anyone else come in, the family would certainly have risen from the table.  Besides, in peaceful Cornwall, visitors did not arrive after ten o'clock at night.  We may take it, then, that all the evidence points to Mortimer Tregennis as the culprit.\"  \"Then his own death was suicide!\"  \"Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not impossible supposition. The man who had the guilt upon his soul of having brought such a fate upon his own family might well be driven by remorse to inflict it upon himself.  There are, however, some cogent reasons against it. Fortunately, there is one man in England who knows all about it, and I have made arrangements by which we shall hear the facts this afternoon from his own lips. Ah! he is a little before his time.  Perhaps you would kindly step this way, Dr. Leon Sterndale. We have been conducing a chemical experiment indoors which has left our little room hardly fit for the reception of so distinguished a visitor.\"  I had heard the click of the garden gate, and now the majestic figure of the great African explorer appeared upon the path.  He turned in some surprise towards the rustic arbour in which we sat.  \"You sent for me, Mr. Holmes.  I had your note about an hour ago, and I have come, though I really do not know why I should obey your summons.\"  \"Perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate,\" said Holmes. \"Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence. You will excuse this informal reception in the open air, but my friend Watson and I have nearly furnished an additional chapter to what the papers call the Cornish Horror, and we prefer a clear atmosphere for the present.  Perhaps, since the matters which we have to discuss will affect you personally in a very intimate fashion, it is as well that we should talk where there can be no eavesdropping.\"  The explorer took his cigar from his lips and gazed sternly at my companion.  \"I am at a loss to know, sir,\" he said, \"what you can have to speak about which affects me personally in a very intimate fashion.\"  \"The killing of Mortimer Tregennis,\" said Holmes.  For a moment I wished that I were armed.  Sterndale's fierce face turned to a dusky red, his eyes glared, and the knotted, passionate veins started out in his forehead, while he sprang forward with clenched hands towards my companion.  Then he stopped, and with a violent effort he resumed a cold, rigid calmness, which was, perhaps, more suggestive of danger than his hot-headed outburst.  \"I have lived so long among savages and beyond the law,\" said he, \"that I have got into the way of being a law to myself.  You would do well, Mr. Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire to do you an injury.\"  \"Nor have I any desire to do you an injury, Dr. Sterndale. Surely the clearest proof of it is that, knowing what I know, I have sent for you and not for the police.\"  Sterndale sat down with a gasp, overawed for, perhaps, the first time in his adventurous life.  There was a calm assurance of power in Holmes's manner which could not be withstood.  Our visitor stammered for a moment, his great hands opening and shutting in his agitation.  \"What do you mean?\" he asked at last.  \"If this is bluff upon your part, Mr. Holmes, you have chosen a bad man for your experiment. Let us have no more beating about the bush.  What DO you mean?\"  \"I will tell you,\" said Holmes, \"and the reason why I tell you is that I hope frankness may beget frankness.  What my next step may be will depend entirely upon the nature of your own defence.\"  \"My defence?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"My defence against what?\"  \"Against the charge of killing Mortimer Tregennis.\"  Sterndale mopped his forehead with his handkerchief.  \"Upon my word, you are getting on,\" said he.  \"Do all your successes depend upon this prodigious power of bluff?\"  \"The bluff,\" said Holmes sternly, \"is upon your side, Dr. Leon Sterndale, and not upon mine.  As a proof I will tell you some of the facts upon which my conclusions are based.  Of your return from Plymouth, allowing much of your property to go on to Africa, I will say nothing save that it first informed me that you were one of the factors which had to be taken into account in reconstructing this drama--\"  \"I came back--\"  \"I have heard your reasons and regard them as unconvincing and inadequate.  We will pass that.  You came down here to ask me whom I suspected.  I refused to answer you. You then went to the vicarage, waited outside it for some time, and finally returned to your cottage.\"  \"How do you know that?\"  \"I followed you.\"  \"I saw no one.\"  \"That is what you may expect to see when I follow you.  You spent a restless night at your cottage, and you formed certain plans, which in the early morning you proceeded to put into execution. Leaving your door just as day was breaking, you filled your pocket with some reddish gravel that was lying heaped beside your gate.\"  Sterndale gave a violent start and looked at Holmes in amazement.  \"You then walked swiftly for the mile which separated you from the vicarage.  You were wearing, I may remark, the same pair of ribbed tennis shoes which are at the present moment upon your feet.  At the vicarage you passed through the orchard and the side hedge, coming out under the window of the lodger Tregennis. It was now daylight, but the household was not yet stirring.  You drew some of the gravel from your pocket, and you threw it up at the window above you.\"  Sterndale sprang to his feet.  \"I believe that you are the devil himself!\" he cried.  Holmes smiled at the compliment.  \"It took two, or possibly three, handfuls before the lodger came to the window.  You beckoned him to come down.  He dressed hurriedly and descended to his sitting-room. You entered by the window.  There was an interview--a short one--during which you walked up and down the room.  Then you passed out and closed the window, standing on the lawn outside smoking a cigar and watching what occurred. Finally, after the death of Tregennis, you withdrew as you had come.  Now, Dr. Sterndale, how do you justify such conduct, and what were the motives for your actions?  If you prevaricate or trifle with me, I give you my assurance that the matter will pass out of my hands forever.\"  Our visitor's face had turned ashen gray as he listened to the words of his accuser.  Now he sat for some time in thought with his face sunk in his hands.  Then with a sudden impulsive gesture he plucked a photograph from his breast-pocket and threw it on the rustic table before us.  \"That is why I have done it,\" said he.  It showed the bust and face of a very beautiful woman.  Holmes stooped over it.  \"Brenda Tregennis,\" said he.  \"Yes, Brenda Tregennis,\" repeated our visitor.  \"For years I have loved her.  For years she has loved me.  There is the secret of that Cornish seclusion which people have marvelled at.  It has brought me close to the one thing on earth that was dear to me. I could not marry her, for I have a wife who has left me for years and yet whom, by the deplorable laws of England, I could not divorce.  For years Brenda waited.  For years I waited.  And this is what we have waited for.\"  A terrible sob shook his great frame, and he clutched his throat under his brindled beard.  Then with an effort he mastered himself and spoke on:  \"The vicar knew.  He was in our confidence.  He would tell you that she was an angel upon earth.  That was why he telegraphed to me and I returned.  What was my baggage or Africa to me when I learned that such a fate had come upon my darling?  There you have the missing clue to my action, Mr. Holmes.\"  \"Proceed,\" said my friend.  Dr. Sterndale drew from his pocket a paper packet and laid it upon the table.  On the outside was written \"Radix pedis diaboli\" with a red poison label beneath it.  He pushed it towards me.  \"I understand that you are a doctor, sir.  Have you ever heard of this preparation?\"  \"Devil's-foot root!  No, I have never heard of it.\"  \"It is no reflection upon your professional knowledge,\" said he, \"for I believe that, save for one sample in a laboratory at Buda, there is no other specimen in Europe.  It has not yet found its way either into the pharmacopoeia or into the literature of toxicology.  The root is shaped like a foot, half human, half goatlike; hence the fanciful name given by a botanical missionary.  It is used as an ordeal poison by the medicine-men in certain districts of West Africa and is kept as a secret among them.  This particular specimen I obtained under very extraordinary circumstances in the Ubangi country.\"  He opened the paper as he spoke and disclosed a heap of reddish-brown, snuff-like powder.  \"Well, sir?\" asked Holmes sternly.  \"I am about to tell you, Mr. Holmes, all that actually occurred, for"]]]
