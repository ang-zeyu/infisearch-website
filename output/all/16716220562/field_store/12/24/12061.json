The Prophet issued an order to gather all the people at Far West and Adam-on-Diamond, under the leadership of Col. Lyman White, for the purpose of protecting the people from mob violence, and to save their property from lawless thieves who were roaming the country in armed bands.  The Gentiles and Mormons hastened to the executive of the State. The Gentiles asked for a military force to protect the settlers from Mormon violence. The Mormons requested, an investigating committee to inquire into the whole subject and suggest means necessary for future safety to each party. Also they demanded military protection from the mobs and outlaws that infested the country.  The Governor sent troops to keep order. They were stationed about midway between Far West and Adam-on-Diamond. A committee was also appointed and sent to Gallatin to inquire into the recent disturbances. This committee had full power to send for witnesses, make arrests of persons accused of crime, and generally to do all things necessary for a full and complete investigation of the entire affair.  Many arrests were made at the request of the committee. The persons so arrested were taken before Justice Black, of Daviess County, and examined; witnesses were examined for both parties, and much hard and false swearing was done on both sides. After a long and fruitless examination the committee adjourned, leaving the military to look after matters until something would turn up to change the feeling of danger then existing. It was thought by the committee that all would soon become quiet and peace would be restored.  The Gentiles of the country were dissatisfied with the action of the committee and in no way disposed to accept peace on any terms; they determined that, come what would, the Mormons should be driven from the State of Missouri. Letters were written by the Gentiles around Far West to all parts of the State, and elsewhere, giving the most fearful accounts of Mormon atrocities. Some of the writers said it was useless to send less than three or four men for each Mormon, because the Mormons felt sure of heaven if they fell fighting, hence they did not fear death; that they fought with the desperation of devils.  Such reports spread like wildfire throughout northern Missouri, and thence all over the States of the Mississippi Valley, and resulted in creating a feeling of the most intense hatred in the breasts of all the Gentiles against the Mormons. Companies of volunteers were raised and armed in every town throughout northern Missouri, and commenced concentrating in the vicinity of the Mormon settlements. The troops sent by the Governor to guard the settlers and preserve order soon took part with the mob, and all show for legal protection was gone, so far as Mormons were concerned. I had built a cabin in the valley of Adam-on-Diamond, at the point where the Prophet said Adam blessed his posterity after being driven from the Garden of Eden.  The condition of the country being such that we could not labor on our farms, I concluded to go and hunt for wild honey. Several of my neighbors were to join me in my bee hunt, and we started with our teams, and traveled northeasterly until we reached the heavy timber at the three forks of Grand River. We camped on the middle fork of Grand River, and had fine success in securing honey.  We had been out at camp only two or three days when we discovered signs of armed men rushing through the country. On the 3d of October, 1838, we saw a large number of men that we knew were enemies to the Mormons on their way, as we supposed, to attack our people at the settlements. I concluded to go and meet them, and find out for certain what they were really intending to do. I was forced to act with caution, for, if they discovered that we were Mormons, our lives would be taken by the desperate men composing the mob who called themselves State volunteers. I took my gun and carrying a bucket on my arm started out to meet the people and learn their intentions. I met them just after they had broken camp on Sunday morning.  As soon as I saw them I was certain they were out hunting for Mormons. I concluded to pass myself off as an outsider, the better to learn their history. My plan worked admirably. I stood my ground until a company of eighteen men rode up to me, and said:  \"You move early.\"  \"Not so early, gentlemen; I am not moving any sooner than you are. What are you all doing in this part of the country, armed to the teeth as you are? Are you hunting for Indians?\"  \"No,\" said they, \"but we wish to know where you are from, and what you are doing.\"  \"I am from Illinois; there are four of us who have come out here to look up a good location to settle. We stopped on Marrowbone, and did think of staying there, until the settlers and Mormons got into a row at Gallatin, on election day. After that we concluded to strike out and see what this country looked like. I am now going to cut a bee tree that I found yesterday evening, and I brought my gun along so that if I met an old buck I could secure some venison to eat with my honeycomb.\"  As I got through they all huddled around me and commenced to relate the horrors of Mormonism. They advised me to have nothing to do with the Mormons, for said they:  \"As old Joe Smith votes, so will every Mormon in the country vote, and when they get into a fight they are just the same way; they stick together. When you attack one of the crew you bring every one of them after you like a nest of hornets.\"  To this I replied that I had heard a little of the fuss at Gallatin, but did not suppose I had got the right of the story, and would be glad if they would tell me just how it was. I should like to learn the facts from an eyewitness. Several of the men spoke up and said they were there and saw it all. They then told the story, and did the Mormons more justice than I expected from them.  They said, among other things, that there was a large rawboned man there who spoke in tongues, and that when the fight commenced he cried:  \"Charge, Danites!\"  They then said the Mormons must leave the country.  \"If we do not make them do so now, they will be so strong in a few years they will rule the country as they please. Another band of men will come along soon; and they will then go through the Mormon settlements and burn up every house, and lynch every Mormon they find. The militia has been sent to keep order in Daviess County, but will soon be gone, and the work of destroying the Mormons begin.\"  \"If they have done as you say they have, pay them in their own coin,\" I said.  The company then passed on, and I returned with a heavy heart to my friends. I advised making an immediate start for home, and in a few minutes we were on our way.  While coming up from home we had found four bee trees, that we left standing, intending to cut them down and get the honey as we went back. When we got on the prairie, which was about eight miles across, the men with me wanted to go and get the honey. I was fearful that the people I had met in the morning would attack the settlements, and I wanted to go directly home and let trees and honey alone.  While we were talking the matter over a single blackbird came to us, apparently in great distress. It flew around each one of us, and would alight on the head of each one of our horses, and especially on my horses' heads, and it even came and alighted on my hat, and would squeak as though it was in pain, and turn its feathers up, and acted as if it wished to warn us of danger. Then it flew off towards the settlements where I wished to go.  All admitted that these were strange actions for a bird, but they still insisted on going to cut the bee trees. I was persuaded to go with them. We had gone a quarter of a mile further when the blackbird returned to us and went through the same performance as before, and again flew off toward the settlement.  This was to me a warning to go home at once; that there was danger there to my family. I then proposed that we all join in prayer. We did so, and I prayed to the Author of our existence, and asked that if it was His will for us to go home at once, and if the blackbird had been sent as a warning messenger, to let it return again, and I would follow it. We then traveled on some two miles, when the messenger returned the third time and appeared, if possible, more determined than before to turn us towards home. I turned my team and started, as straight as I could go, for Adam-on-Diamond.  As we passed over the prairie we saw the smoke rising from many farms and houses in the vicinity of where we had left our bee trees. This smoke showed us that our enemies were at work, and that had we kept on in the course we were first intending to travel we would have fallen into the hands of the lawless and lost our lives.  Before we got home the news of the attack upon the settlements had reached there. It was also reported, and we afterwards learned that the report was true, that many of the Mormon settlers had been tied to trees and whipped with hickory withes, some of them being horribly mangled by the mob. This conduct on the part of the Gentiles roused every Mormon to action, and the excitement was very great.  Joseph the Prophet was then sent for. Col. White called together every man and boy that could carry arms. When the forces were assembled Col. White made a war speech. As he spoke he stood by his fine brown horse. There was a bearskin on his saddle. He had a red handkerchief around his head, regular Indian fashion, with the knot in front; he stood bareheaded, in his shirt sleeves, with collar open, showing his naked breast. He held a large cutlass in his right hand. His manner of address struck terror to his enemies, while it charged his brethren with enthusiastic zeal and forced them to believe they were invincible and bullet-proof.

I'll get the cocoanuts.\"  \"Me, too,\" chimed in Rosy Posy. \"Me tumble in the wet water, too!\"  The speakers in this somewhat enigmatical conversation were the four Maynard children, and they were deciding on their morning's occupation. It was a gorgeous day in early September. The air, without being too cool, was just crisp enough to make one feel energetic, though indeed no special atmospheric conditions were required to make the four Maynards feel energetic. That was their normal state, and if they were specially gay and lively this morning, it was not because of the brisk, breezy day, but because they were reunited after their summer's separation.  Though they had many friends among the neighboring children, the Maynards were a congenial quartette, and had equally good times playing by themselves or with others. Their home occupied a whole block in the prettiest residence part of Rockwell, and the big square house sat in the midst of about seven acres of lawn and garden.  There were many fine old trees, grassy paths, and informal flower-beds, and here the children were allowed to do whatever they chose, but outside the place, without permission, they must not go.  There was a playground, a tennis court, and a fountain, but better than these they liked the corner full of fruit trees, called \"the orchard,\" and another corner, where grapes grew on trellises, called \"the vineyard.\" The barn and its surroundings, too, often proved attractive, for the Maynards' idea of playing were by no means confined to quiet or decorous games.  The house itself was surrounded by broad verandas, and on the southern one of these, in the morning sunshine, the four held conclave.  Kingdon, the eldest, was the only boy, and oftener than not his will was law. But this was usually because he had such splendid ideas about games and how to play them, that his sisters gladly fell in with his plans.  But Marjorie was not far behind her brother in ingenuity, and when they all set to work, or rather, set to play, the games often became very elaborate and exciting. \"Shipwreck\" was always a favorite, because it could develop in so many ways. Once they were shipwrecked no rescue was possible, unless help appeared from some unexpected quarter. It might be a neighbor's child coming to see them, or it might be a servant, or one of their own parents, but really rescued they must be by actual outsiders. Unless, indeed, they could build a raft and save themselves, but this they had never accomplished.  The desert island was selected, and this time they chose a certain grassy knoll under an immense old maple tree.  Marjorie disappeared in the direction of the kitchen, and, after a time, came back with a small basket, apparently well-filled.  With this she scampered away to the \"desert island,\" and soon returned, swinging the empty basket. Tossing this into the house, she announced that she was ready.  Then the four went to the big, double, wooden swing, and got in.  Kitty carried her doll, Arabella, from which she was seldom separated, and Rosy Posy hugged her big white Teddy Bear, who was named Boffin and who accompanied the baby on all expeditions.  The swing, to-day, was an ocean steamer.  \"Have your tickets ready!\" called out Kingdon, as his passengers swarmed up the gangplank, which he had thoughtfully laid from the ground to the low step of the swing.  Soon they were all on board, the gangplank drawn in, and the ship started.  At first all went smoothly. The swing swayed gently back and forth, and the passengers admired the beautiful scenery on either side. The Captain had never crossed an ocean, and the nearest he had come to it had been a sail up the Hudson and a trip to Coney Island. His local color, therefore, was a bit mixed, but his passengers were none the wiser, or if they were, they didn't care.  \"On the right, we see West Point!\" the Captain shouted, pointing to their own house. \"That's where the soldiers come from. The noble soldiers who fight for the land of the free and the home of the brave.\"  \"Are you a soldier, sir?\" asked Marjorie.  \"Yes, madam; I am a veteran of the Civil War. But as there's no fighting to do now, I run this steamer.\"  \"A fine ship it is,\" observed Kitty.  \"It is that! No finer craft sails the waves than this.\"  \"What is that mountain in the distance?\" asked Marjorie, shading her eyes with her hand as she looked across the street.  \"That's a--a peak of the Rockies, ma'am. And now we are passing the famous statue of 'Liberty Enlightening the World.'\"  As the statue to which Kingdon pointed was really Mrs. Maynard, who had come out on the veranda, and stood with her hand high against a post, the children shouted with laughter.  But this was quickly suppressed, as part of the fun of making-believe was to keep grave about it.  \"Is your daughter ill, madam?\" asked Marjorie of Kitty, whose doll hung over her arm in a dejected way.  \"No, indeed!\" cried Kitty, righting poor Arabella. \"She is as well as anything. Only she's a little afraid of the ocean. It seems to be getting rougher.\"  It did seem so. The swing was not only going more rapidly, but was joggling from side to side.  \"Don't be alarmed, ladies,\" said the gallant Captain; \"there's no danger, I assure you.\"  \"I'm not afraid of the sea,\" said Marjorie, \"as much as I am of that fearful wild bear. Will he bite?\"  \"No,\" said Kingdon, looking at Rosy Posy. \"That's his trainer who is holding him. He's a wonderful man with wild beasts. He's--he's Buffalo Bill. Speak up, Rosy Posy; you're Buffalo Bill, and that's a bear you're taking home to your show.\"  \"Ess,\" said Rosamond, who was somewhat versed in make-believe plays, \"I'se Buffaro Bill; an' 'is is my big, big bear.\"  \"Will he bite?\" asked Kitty, shrinking away in fear, and protecting Arabella with one arm.  \"Ess! He bites awful!\" Rosy Posy's eyes opened wide as she exploited her Bear's ferocity, and Boffin made mad dashes at Arabella, who duly shrieked with fear.  But now the ship began to pitch and toss fearfully. The Captain stood up in his excitement, but that only seemed to make the motion worse.  \"Is there danger?\" cried Marjorie, in tragic tones, as she gripped the belt of King's Norfolk jacket. \"Give me this life-preserver; I don't see any other.\"  \"They are under the seats!\" shouted the Captain, who was now greatly excited. \"I cannot deceive you! We are in great danger! We may strike a rock any minute! Put on life-preservers, all of you. They are under the seats.\"  The other three scrambled for imaginary life-preservers, and vigorously put them on, when, with a terrific yell, Kingdon cried out:  \"We have struck! We're on a rock! The ship is settling; we must all be drowned. We are lost! Launch the boats!\"  This was a signal for shrieks and wails from the others, and in a minute it was pandemonium. The four screamed and groaned, the swing shook violently, and then came almost to a standstill.  Kingdon fell out with a bounce and lay prone on the ground. Marjorie sprang out, and as she reached the ground, struck out like a swimmer in the water.  Kitty daintily stepped out, remarking: \"This is a fine life-preserver. I can stand straight up in the water.\"  Baby Rosamond bundled out backward, dropping Boffin as she did so.  \"The bear, the bear!\" screamed Kingdon, and swimming a few strokes along the soft, green grass, he grabbed the bear and waved him aloft.  \"What can we do!\" stammered Marjorie, panting for breath. \"I've swum till I'm exhausted. Must I drown!\" With a wail, she turned on her eyes on the grass, and closing her eyes, prepared to sink beneath the waves.  \"Do not despair,\" urged Kingdon, as he grasped her arm. \"Perhaps we can find a plank or a raft. Or perhaps we can yet swim ashore.\"  \"How many survivors are we?\" asked Marjorie, sitting up in the water and looking about.  \"Four,\" responded Kitty; \"but I won't swim. It makes my dress all greeny, and stubs my shoes out.\"  Kitty was the only Maynard who was finicky about her clothes. It called forth much derision from her elder brother and sister, but she stood firm. She would play their plays, until it came to \"swimming\" across grass and earth, and there she rebelled.  \"All right,\" said Kingdon, good-naturedly, "]]]
