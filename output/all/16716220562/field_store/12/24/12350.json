We call it a Tracy.\"  Paul frowned at the wristwatch, fingered it a moment, held it to his ear. It ticked and the second hand moved. \"Tracy?\" he said.  Stevens said, \"After Dick Tracy. Remember, a few years ago? His wrist two-way radio.\"  \"But this is really a watch,\" Paul said.  \"Sure. Keeps fairly good time, too. However, that's camouflage. It's also a two-way radio. Tight beam from wherever you are to the Chief.\"  Paul pursed his lips. \"The transistor boys are really doing it up brown.\" He handed the watch back to Derek Stevens. \"Show me how it works, Derek.\"  They spent fifteen minutes on the communications device, then Derek Stevens said, \"Here's another item the Chief thought you might want to see:\"  It was a compact, short-muzzled hand gun. Paul handled it with the ease of long practice. \"The grip's clumsy. What's its advantage? I don't particularly like an automatic.\"  Derek Stevens motioned with his head. \"Come into the firing range, Koslov, and we'll give you a demonstration.\"  Paul shot him a glance from the side of his eyes, then nodded. \"Lead on.\"  In the range, Stevens had a man-size silhouette put up. He stood to one side and said, \"O.K., let her go.\"  Paul stood easily, left hand in pants pocket, brought the gun up and tightened on the trigger. He frowned and pressed again.  He scowled at Derek Stevens. \"It's not loaded.\"  Stevens grunted amusement. \"Look at the target. First time you got it right over the heart.\"  \"I'll be ...,\" Paul began. He looked down at the weapon in surprise. \"Noiseless and recoilless. What caliber is it, Derek, and what's the muzzle velocity?\"  \"We call it the .38 Noiseless,\" Stevens said. \"It has the punch of that .44 Magnum you're presently carrying.\"  With a fluid motion Paul Koslov produced the .44 Magnum from the holster under his left shoulder and tossed it to one side. \"That's the last time I tote that cannon,\" he said. He balanced the new gun in his hand in admiration. \"Have the front sight taken off for me, Derek, and the fore part of the trigger guard. I need a quick draw gun.\" He added absently, \"How did you know I carried a .44?\"  Stevens said, \"You're rather famous, Koslov. The Colonel Lawrence of the Cold War. The journalists are kept from getting very much about you, but what they do learn they spread around.\"  Paul Koslov said flatly, \"Why don't you like me, Stevens? In this game I don't appreciate people on our team who don't like me. It's dangerous.\"  Derek Stevens flushed. \"I didn't say I didn't like you.\"  \"You didn't have to.\"  \"It's nothing personal,\" Stevens said.  Paul Koslov looked at him.  Stevens said, \"I don't approve of Americans committing political assassinations.\"  Paul Koslov grinned wolfishly and without humor. \"You'll have a hard time proving that even our cloak and dagger department has ever authorized assassination, Stevens. By the way, I'm not an American.\"  Derek Stevens was not the type of man whose jaw dropped, but he blinked. \"Then what are you?\"  \"A Russian,\" Paul snapped. \"And look, Stevens, we're busy now, but when you've got some time to do a little thinking, consider the ethics of warfare.\"  Stevens was flushed again at the tone. \"Ethics of warfare?\"  \"There aren't any,\" Paul Koslov snapped. \"There hasn't been chivalry in war for a long time, and there probably never will be again. Neither side can afford it. And I'm talking about cold war as well as hot.\" He scowled at the other. \"Or did you labor under the illusion that only the Commies had tough operators on their side?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Paul Koslov crossed the Atlantic in a supersonic TU-180 operated by Europa Airways. That in itself galled him. It was bad enough that the Commies had stolen a march on the West with the first jet liner to go into mass production, the TU-104 back in 1957. By the time the United States brought out its first really practical trans-Atlantic jets in 1959 the Russians had come up with the TU-114 which its designer, old Andrei Tupolev named the largest, most efficient and economical aircraft flying.  In civil aircraft they had got ahead and stayed ahead. Subsidized beyond anything the West could or at least would manage, the air lines of the world couldn't afford to operate the slower, smaller and more expensive Western models. One by one, first the neutrals such as India, and then even members of the Western bloc began equipping their air lines with Russian craft.  Paul grunted his disgust at the memory of the strong measures that had to be taken by the government to prevent even some of the American lines from buying Soviet craft at the unbelievably low prices they offered them.         *       *       *       *       *  In London he presented a card on which he had added a numbered code in pencil. Handed it over a desk to the British intelligence major.  \"I believe I'm expected,\" Paul said.  The major looked at him, then down at the card. \"Just a moment, Mr. Smith. I'll see if his lordship is available. Won't you take a chair?\" He left the room.  Paul Koslov strolled over to the window and looked out on the moving lines of pedestrians below. He had first been in London some thirty years ago. So far as he could remember, there were no noticeable changes with the exception of automobile design. He wondered vaguely how long it took to make a noticeable change in the London street scene.  The major re-entered the room with a new expression of respect on his face. \"His lordship will see you immediately, Mr. Smith.\"  \"Thanks,\" Paul said. He entered the inner office.  Lord Carrol was attired in civilian clothes which somehow failed to disguise a military quality in his appearance. He indicated a chair next to his desk. \"We've been instructed to give you every assistance Mr. ... Smith. Frankly, I can't imagine of just what this could consist.\"  Paul said, as he adjusted himself in the chair, \"I'm going into the Soviet Union on an important assignment. I'll need as large a team at my disposal as we can manage. You have agents in Russia, of course?\" He lifted his eyebrows.  His lordship cleared his throat and his voice went even stiffer. \"All major military nations have a certain number of espionage operatives in each other's countries. No matter how peaceful the times, this is standard procedure.\"  \"And these are hardly peaceful times,\" Paul said dryly. \"I'll want a complete list of your Soviet based agents and the necessary information on how to contact them.\"  Lord Carrol stared at him. Finally sputtered, \"Man, _why_? You're not even a British national. This is--\"  Paul, held up a hand. \"We're co-operating with the Russian underground. Co-operating isn't quite strong enough a word. We're going to _push_ them into activity if we can.\"  The British intelligence head looked down at the card before him. \"Mr. Smith,\" he read. He looked up. \"John Smith, I assume.\"  Paul said, still dryly, \"Is there any other?\"  Lord Carrol said, \"See here, you're really Paul Koslov, aren't you?\"  Paul looked at him, said nothing.  Lord Carrol said impatiently, \"What you ask is impossible. Our operatives all have their own assignments, their own work. Why do you need them?\"  \"This is the biggest job ever, overthrowing the Soviet State. We need as many men as we can get on our team. Possibly I won't have to use them but, if I do, I want them available.\"  The Britisher rapped, \"You keep mentioning _our team_ but according to the dossier we carry on you, Mr. Koslov, you are neither British nor even a Yankee. And you ask me to turn over our complete Soviet machinery.\"  Paul came to his feet and leaned over the desk, there was a paleness immediately beneath his ears and along his jaw line. \"Listen,\" he said tightly, \"if I'm not on this team, there just is no team. Just a pretense of one. When there's a real team there has to be a certain spirit. A team spirit. I don't care if you're playing cricket, football or international cold war. If there's one thing that's important to me, that I've based my whole life upon, it's this, understand? _I've_ got team spirit. Perhaps no one else in the whole West has it, but _I_ do.\"  Inwardly, Lord Carrol was boiling. He snapped, \"You're neither British nor American. In other words, you are a mercenary. How do we know that the Russians won't offer you double or triple what the Yankees pay for your services?\"  Paul sat down again and looked at his watch. \"My time is limited,\" he said. \"I have to leave for Paris this afternoon and be in Bonn tomorrow. I don't care what opinions you might have in regard to my mercenary motives, Lord Carrol. I've just come from Downing Street. I suggest you make a phone call there. At the request of Washington, your government has given me carte blanche in this matter.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Paul flew into Moscow in an Aeroflot jet, landing at Vnukovo airport on the outskirts of the city. He entered as an American businessman, a camera importer who was also interested in doing a bit of tourist sightseeing. He was traveling deluxe category which entitled him to a Zil complete with chauffeur and an interpreter-guide when he had need of one. He was quartered in the Ukrayna, on Dorogomilovskaya Quai, a twenty-eight floor skyscraper with a thousand rooms.  It was Paul's first visit to Moscow but he wasn't particularly thrown off. He kept up with developments and was aware of the fact that as early as the late 1950s, the Russians had begun to lick the problems of ample food, clothing and finally shelter. Even those products once considered sheer luxuries were now in abundant supply. If material things alone had been all that counted, the Soviet man in the street wasn't doing so badly.  He spent the first several days getting the feel of the city and also making his preliminary business calls. He was interested in a new \"automated\" camera currently being touted by the Russians as the world's best. Fastest lens, foolproof operation,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23929"],["title","Revolution (#2)"],["body"," guaranteed for the life of the owner, and retailing for exactly twenty-five dollars.  He was told, as expected, that the factory and distribution point was in Leningrad and given instructions and letters of introduction.  On the fifth day he took the Red Arrow Express to Leningrad and established himself at the Astoria Hotel, 39 Hertzen Street. It was one of the many of the Intourist hotels going back to before the revolution.  He spent the next day allowing his guide to show him the standard tourist sights. The Winter Palace, where the Bolshevik revolution was won when the mutinied cruiser _Aurora_ steamed up the river and shelled it. The Hermitage Museum, rivaled only by the Vatican and Louvre. The Alexandrovskaya Column, the world's tallest monolithic stone monument. The modest personal palace of Peter the Great. The Peter and Paul Cathedral. The king-size Kirov Stadium. The Leningrad subway, as much a museum as a system of transportation.  He saw it all, tourist fashion, and wondered inwardly what the Intourist guide would have thought had he known that this was Mr. John Smith's home town.  The day following, he turned his business problem over to the guide. He wanted to meet, let's see now, oh yes, here it is, Leonid Shvernik, of the Mikoyan Camera works. Could it be arranged?  Of course it could be arranged. The guide went into five minutes of oratory on the desire of the Soviet Union to trade with the West, and thus spread everlasting peace.  An interview was arranged for Mr. Smith with Mr. Shvernik for that afternoon.  Mr. Smith met Mr. Shvernik in the latter's office at two and they went through the usual amenities. Mr. Shvernik spoke excellent English so Mr. Smith was able to dismiss his interpreter-guide for the afternoon. When he was gone and they were alone Mr. Shvernik went into his sales talk.  \"I can assure you, sir, that not since the Japanese startled the world with their new cameras shortly after the Second War, has any such revolution in design and quality taken place. The Mikoyan is not only the _best_ camera produced anywhere, but since our plant is fully automated, we can sell it for a fraction the cost of German, Japanese or American--\"  Paul Koslov came to his feet, walked quietly over to one of the pictures hanging on the wall, lifted it, pointed underneath and raised his eyebrows at the other.  Leonid Shvernik leaned back in his chair, shocked.  Paul remained there until at last the other shook his head.  Paul said, in English, \"Are you absolutely sure?\"  \"Yes.\" Shvernik said. \"There are no microphones in here. I absolutely know. Who are you?\"  Paul said, \"In the movement they call you Georgi, and you're top man in the Leningrad area.\"  Shvernik's hand came up from under the desk and he pointed a heavy military revolver at his visitor. \"Who are you?\" he repeated.  Paul ignored the gun. \"Someone who knows that you are Georgi,\" he said \"I'm from America. Is there any chance of anybody intruding?\"  \"Yes, one of my colleagues. Or perhaps a secretary.\"  [Illustration]  \"Then I suggest we go to a bar, or some place, for a drink or a cup of coffee or whatever the current Russian equivalent might be.\"  Shvernik looked at him searchingly. \"Yes,\" he said finally. \"There's a place down the street.\" He began to stick the gun in his waistband, changed his mind and put it back into the desk drawer.  As soon as they were on the open street and out of earshot of other pedestrians, Paul said, \"Would you rather I spoke Russian? I have the feeling that we'd draw less attention than if we speak English.\"  Shvernik said tightly, \"Do the Intourist people know you speak Russian? If not, stick to English. Now, how do you know my name? I have no contacts with the Americans.\"  \"I got it through my West German contacts.\"  The Russian's face registered unsuppressed fury. \"Do they ignore the simplest of precautions! Do they reveal me to every source that asks?\"  Paul said mildly, \"Herr Ludwig is currently under my direction. Your secret is as safe as it has ever been.\"  The underground leader remained silent for a long moment. \"You're an American, eh, and Ludwig told you about me? What do you want now?\"  \"To help,\" Paul Koslov said.  \"How do you mean, to help? How can you help? I don't know what you're talking about.\"  \"Help in any way you want. Money, printing presses, mimeograph machines, radio transmitters, weapons, manpower in limited amounts, know-how, training, anything you need to help overthrow the Soviet government.\"  They had reached the restaurant. Leonid Shvernik became the Russian export official. He ushered his customer to a secluded table. Saw him comfortably into his chair.  \"Do you actually know anything about cameras?\" he asked.  \"Yes,\" Paul said, \"we're thorough. I can buy cameras from you and they'll be marketed in the States.\"  \"Good.\" The waiter was approaching. Shvernik said, \"Have you ever eaten caviar Russian style?\"  \"I don't believe so,\" Paul said \"I'm not very hungry.\"  \"Nothing to do with hunger.\" Shvernik said. From the waiter he ordered raisin bread, sweet butter, caviar and a carafe of vodka.  The waiter went off for it and Shvernik said, \"To what extent are you willing to help us? Money, for instance. What kind of money, rubles, dollars? And how much? A revolutionary movement can always use money.\"  \"Any kind,\" Paul said flatly, \"and any amount.\"  Shvernik was impressed. He said eagerly, \"Any amount within reason, eh?\"  Paul looked into his face and said flatly, \"Any amount, period. It doesn't have to be particularly reasonable. Our only qualification would be a guarantee it is going into the attempt to overthrow the Soviets--not into private pockets.\"  The waiter was approaching. Shvernik drew some brochures from his pocket, spread them before Paul Koslov and began to point out with a fountain pen various features of the Mikoyan camera.  The waiter put the order on the table and stood by for a moment for further orders.  Shvernik said, \"First you take a sizable portion of vodka, like this.\" He poured them two jolts. \"And drink it down, ah, bottoms up, you Americans say. Then you spread butter on a small slice of raisin bread, and cover it with a liberal portion of caviar. Good? Then you eat your little sandwich and drink another glass of vodka. Then you start all over again.\"  \"I can see it could be fairly easy to get stoned, eating caviar Russian style,\" Paul laughed.  They went through the procedure and the waiter wandered off.  Paul said, \"I can take several days arranging the camera deal with you. Then I can take a tour of the country, supposedly giving it a tourist look-see, but actually making contact with more of your organization. I can then return in the future, supposedly to make further orders. I can assure you, these cameras are going to sell very well in the States. I'll be coming back, time and again--for business reasons. Meanwhile, do you have any members among the interpreter-guides in the local Intourist offices?\"  Shvernik nodded. \"Yes. And, yes, that would be a good idea. We'll assign Ana Furtseva to you, if we can arrange it. And possibly she can even have a chauffeur assigned you who'll also be one of our people.\"  That was the first time Paul Koslov heard the name Ana Furtseva.         *       *       *       *       *  In the morning Leonid Shvernik came to the hotel in a Mikoyan Camera Works car loaded with cameras and the various accessories that were available for the basic model. He began gushing the advantages of the Mikoyan before they were well out of the hotel.  The last thing he said, as they trailed out of the hotel's portals was, \"We'll drive about town, giving you an opportunity to do some snapshots and then possibly to my country dacha where we can have lunch--\"  At the car he said, \"May I introduce Ana Furtseva, who's been assigned as your guide-interpreter by Intourist for the balance of your stay? Ana, Mr. John Smith.\"  Paul shook hands.  She was blond as almost all Russian girls are blond, and with the startling blue eyes. A touch chubby, by Western standards, but less so than the Russian average. She had a disturbing pixie touch around the mouth, out of place in a dedicated revolutionist.  The car took off with Shvernik at the wheel. \"You're actually going to have to take pictures as we go along. We'll have them developed later at the plant. I've told them that you are potentially a very big order. Possibly they'll try and assign one of my superiors to your account after a day or two. If so, I suggest that you merely insist that you feel I am competent and you would rather continue with me.\"  \"Of course,\" Paul said. \"Now then, how quickly can our assistance to you get underway?\"  \"The question is,\" Shvernik said, \"just how much you can do in the way of helping our movement. For instance, can you get advanced type weapons to us?\"  The .38 Noiseless slid easily into Paul's hands. \"Obviously, we can't smuggle sizable military equipment across the border. But here, for instance, is a noiseless, recoilless hand gun. We could deliver any reasonable amount within a month.\"  \"Five thousand?\" Shvernik asked.  \"I think so. You'd have to cover once they got across the border, of course. How well organized are you? If you aren't, possibly we can help there, but not in time to get five thousand guns to you in a month.\"  Ana was puzzled. \"How could you possibly get that number across the Soviet borders?\" Her voice had a disturbing Slavic throatiness. It occurred to Paul Koslov that she was one of the most attractive women he had ever met. He was amused. Women had never played a great part in his life. There had never been anyone who had really, basically, appealed. But evidently blood was telling. Here he had to come back to Russia to find such attractiveness.  He said, \"The Yugoslavs are comparatively open and smuggling across the Adriatic from Italy, commonplace. We'd bring the things you want in that way. Yugoslavia and Poland are on good terms, "]]]
