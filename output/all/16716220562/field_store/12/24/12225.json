And he's gwine to de Gineral for to tell him dat; and dat ole man is a member ob de Church! Well! well! well! Why, look heah, my Men', when de rebs was here only a few weeks ago--when dey was here, dat ole man got on his white hoss, and took de seceshum flag, and rode, and rode, and waved dat rebel flag and shouted, and more dan hollered for Jeff Davis, and _now_ he Union man! He wants de Gineral to gib up dese here colored people--_dat's what's de matter wid him_!\"  In an hour after we arrived in camp, sure enough, the old Kidd and other parties were there, expecting or hoping to get their darkeys back; but General Steadman told them if the negroes _wished_ to return, they could do so, but, if they chose rather to work for \"UNCLE SAM,\" why, his orders were to use them.  \"Well, _Gineral_, you just tell my niggers that they can go home with me,\" said Kidd.  \"O! they can if they want to.\" So, out goes Kidd, smiling as a \"basket of chips.\"  \"Boys, the Gineral says you can all go home _with me_.\"  \"IF YOU WANT TO,\" was my addition _to his sentence_.  Not a negro stirred from the line. After a brief consultation, in an under tone, at which Kidd, I noticed, was becoming very impatient, Kidd broke the quietude by saying:  \"Come on, boys--come, Jim.\"  Jim looked over to Bob and said: \"Bob, what are you going to do?\"  \"Me! Ise gwine to stay for de UNION!\"  Old man Kidd looked beaten. \"Well, Jim, what will _you_ do?\"  \"O! I does what Bob does!\"  _This same old Kidd_ had been in the habit of going over the country enlisting recruits for the rebel service--telling them that he was an old man, or he would go himself; that the old folks expected to be taxed to take care of the soldiers' families; that if they wanted corn or any thing from his mill, while they were in the army, to come and get it. By such language he induced several men, who had only small families, to enlist. One of them was indebted to Kidd about thirteen dollars, and after he had been in the army a month or two, Kidd dunned him for the old bill, remarking:  \"Well, John, you're in the army now, gittin' your regular pay now--guess you can pay that little bill now, can't you?\"     CHAPTER V.       Cutting Down a Rebel's Reserved Timber -- Home again --      Loomis and his Coldwater Battery -- Secession Poetry --      Heavy Joke on an \"Egyptian\" Regiment.   Just after General Schofield took command of the Third Division, Roddy Patterson, aided by a division of infantry, made his appearance near our camp, and, as we were weak in numbers, fortifications were erected in every direction, trenches dug, and efforts made to place the troops in the best trim to give the rebs a \"fine reception.\"  There was one splendid piece of timber-land that might possibly come in possession of the rebels and do us much mischief. General Schofield ordered it cleared, and soon twelve hundred axes were resounding through the vast forest, and Abe's rail-splitters were at work forming \"abatis\" from the fallen trees, while earthworks commanding the position were soon erected.  Captain Stinchcomb was the provost-marshal of the division, and old man Jordan was in the habit of going to him with all his grievances. The soldiers had made an awful gap in his _reserved_ timber before he found it out; but, as soon as he did so, he made for head-quarters, and found the Captain at dinner.   _Scene I--Act 1--Enter Old Man._  \"Look a-heah, Gineral Stinchcomb, them boys of yourn is cuttin' all my timber down!\"  Captain Stinchcomb, affecting great surprise, exclaimed, \"Is it possible! is it possible!\"  \"Y-a-a-a-s; all my _resarve, too_! There! there! do you hear that? Them's trees a-fallin', and them's the boys yellin' as they fall.\"  \"What are they cutting them for, Mr. Jordan?\"  \"God only knows! I don't. I think just for to be doin' mischief. _Nauen_ else in this world.\"  \"Why didn't you stop them?\" inquired Stinchcomb.  \"O! kase I was afeared. There! there! do you hear that agin? Them's my trees!\"  \"Well, you'd better go right down and order them to stop.\"  \"O, no, Gineral. It wouldn't do a bit of good. Them there boys would _just cuss the life out of me_. They only laugh at me. Won't you please go and have it stopped? Won't you?\"  Suffice it to say, when Captain S. got there _it was too late_.  There are many little incidents connected with the army, which, being jotted down in my \"day-book,\" during service, belong to the public.  \"Home Again\" is a song ever joyous to the soldier, and I remember a little incident in relation to that song and a serenading party of \"young and festive cusses\" belonging to Uncle Sam's service.  There is residing near Murfreesboro a Secession family consisting of a rebel widow and four sprightly daughters.  Now, our \"blue-coats\" are proverbial for their gallantry in presence of the ladies, and the Secesh girls smile as benignly upon a Federal soldier, if he be good-looking, as they would upon the most ultra fire-eater of the South. The mothers don't like this--but mothers can't help themselves in many instances. Our boys will visit and enjoy a lively chat with the girls whenever occasion offers. A quartette, of fine vocal abilities, belonging to the gallant Rousseau's division, had practiced several beautiful ballads, preparatory to a grand serenade to the daughters of the buxom widow.  Night threw her mantle o'er the earth just as the serenaders started upon their expedition. Arriving in dew course of time, they commenced their melodies. The moon was peeping out from behind the far-distant hill as they commenced,    \"Roll on, silver moon,\"  at which I suggested to the party there should be a big premium, just now, on \"_silver_ moons.\" The serenaders smiled grimly, in token of admiration of the \"_goak_,\" and commenced--    \"Thine eyes, like the stars that are gleaming,      Have entered the depths of my soul.\"  Now, the repetition of \"my soul\" sounded to me exactly like mice-hole, and I suggested the propriety of substituting a rat-hole, at which several became wrathy, and proposed a mustard-plaster for my head.  The young ladies, aroused from their nocturnal slumbers, glided like sylphs to the windows, and threw several bouquets to the \"gallant choristers,\" after the reception of which, and sundry pressures to fond hearts of the \"beautiful flowers,\" the quartette commenced the song of \"Home Again,\" etc., and    \"O, it fills my soul with joy, to meet my friends once more.\"  This brought the widow to the window, who, hastily flinging back the shutter, screamed out, at the top of her voice: \"If it will give you Yankees any greater joy to get home than it will me, I hope to gracious you'll stop your confounded noise and go home and meet your friends, for you've got none here.\"  This was a bomb-shell thrown right at the party, and such a crouching down and gradual sliding off you can scarcely imagine. To be led, as 't were, to the seventh heaven of bliss by the fair daughters' presentation of beautiful bouquets, and then to have all their hopes blasted by the termagant voice of the mamma! If any of my readers ever visit Rousseau's division and inquire for the serenaders, my word for it, the gentlemen concerned will have no recollection of the serenade.  Colonel Loomis, whose name is now engraven in history, and whose battery is mentioned with pride everywhere in the Army of the Cumberland, was, during the Virginia campaign, _Captain_ Loomis. He was late Chief of Artillery upon Rousseau's staff. Captain Loomis, with his train, arrived in Cincinnati one Sunday morning, on his way to the Army of Virginia. Upon each caisson and every piece of artillery was plainly painted \"Coldwater Battery.\"  Services in a church on Sixth Street were just concluded, and the warlike array attracted the congregation's attention, and the rather splendid figure of the young though \"venerable-looking\" Captain Loomis demanded a large share of attention. The pastor of the church introduced himself, spoke with admiration of the fine appearance of the Captain's men, etc., and, with a hearty pressure of the hand, remarked:  \"Captain Loomis, yours is a noble motto; stick to that, stick to that, my young soldier. You have many hardships to undergo, but your glorious motto of COLD WATER will carry you safely through.\"  Loomis, for the first time, caught the idea of the parson, but was too courteous to undeceive the preacher by informing him that his battery was raised in the town of Coldwater, Michigan. I have spent many a pleasant hour with the Captain, but never could \"see\" the \"cold water\" part of his battery.  A very pretty and pathetic little poem was handed me by one of Secessia's daughters, upon a prolific theme, entitled   THE DYING SOLDIER.      My noble commander! thank God, you have come;     You know the dear ones who are waiting at home,     And O! it were dreadful to die here alone,     No hand on my brow, and my comrades all gone.      I thought I would die many hours ago,     And those who are waiting me never could know     That here, in the faith of its happier years,     My soul has not wandered one moment from theirs.      The dead were around; but my soul was away     With the roses that bloom round my cottage to-day.     I thought that I sat where the jessamine twines,     And gathered the delicate buds from the vines.      And there--like a bird that had folded its wings,     At home, 'mid the smile of all beautiful things,     With sweet words of welcome, and kisses of love--     Was one I will miss in yon heaven above.      By the light that I saw on her radiant brow,     She watches and waits there and prays for me now.     My captain, bend low; for this poor, wounded side     Is draining my heart of its last crimson tide.      Some day, when you leave this dark place, and go free,     You will meet a fair girl--she will question of me!     She has kissed this bright curl, as it lay on my head;     When it goes back alone, she will know I am dead.

DESTRUCTION AND RECONSTRUCTION.     CHAPTER I.  SECESSION.   The history of the United States, as yet unwritten, will show the causes of the \"Civil War\" to have been in existence during the Colonial era, and to have cropped out into full view in the debates of the several State Assemblies on the adoption of the Federal Constitution, in which instrument Luther Martin, Patrick Henry, and others, insisted that they were implanted. African slavery at the time was universal, and its extinction in the North, as well as its extension in the South, was due to economic reasons alone.  The first serious difficulty of the Federal Government arose from the attempt to lay an excise on distilled spirits. The second arose from the hostility of New England traders to the policy of the Government in the war of 1812, by which their special interests were menaced; and there is now evidence to prove that, but for the unexpected peace, an attempt to disrupt the Union would then have been made.  The \"Missouri Compromise\" of 1820 was in reality a truce between antagonistic revenue systems, each seeking to gain the balance of power. For many years subsequently, slaves--as domestic servants--were taken to the Territories without exciting remark, and the \"Nullification\" movement in South Carolina was entirely directed against the tariff.  Anti-slavery was agitated from an early period, but failed to attract public attention for many years. At length, by unwearied industry, by ingeniously attaching itself to exciting questions of the day, with which it had no natural connection, it succeeded in making a lodgment in the public mind, which, like a subject exhausted by long effort, is exposed to the attack of some malignant fever, that in a normal condition of vigor would have been resisted. The common belief that slavery was the cause of civil war is incorrect, and Abolitionists are not justified in claiming the glory and spoils of the conflict and in pluming themselves as \"choosers of the slain.\"  The vast immigration that poured into the country between the years 1840 and 1860 had a very important influence in directing the events of the latter year. The numbers were too great to be absorbed and assimilated by the native population. States in the West were controlled by German and Scandinavian voters, while the Irish took possession of the seaboard towns. Although the balance of party strength was not much affected by these naturalized voters, the modes of political thought were seriously disturbed, and a tendency was manifested to transfer exciting topics from the domain of argument to that of violence.  The aged and feeble President, Mr. Buchanan, unfitted for troublous times, was driven to and fro by ambitious leaders of his own party, as was the last weak Hapsburg who reigned in Spain by the rival factions of France and Austria.  Under these conditions the National Democratic Convention met at Charleston, South Carolina, in the spring of 1860, to declare the principles on which the ensuing presidential campaign was to be conducted, and select candidates for the offices of President and Vice-President. Appointed a delegate by the Democracy of my State, Louisiana, in company with others I reached Charleston two days in advance of the time. We were at once met by an invitation to join in council delegates from the Gulf States, to agree upon some common ground of action in the Convention, but declined for the reason that we were accredited to the National Convention, and had no authority to participate in other deliberations. This invitation and the terms in which it was conveyed argued badly for the harmony of the Convention itself, and for the preservation of the unity of the Democracy, then the only organization supported in all quarters"]]]
