If the hands are allowed to swing in walking, the arc should be limited, and the lady will manage them much more gracefully, if they almost touch the clothing.  13. A lady should not stand with her hands behind her. We could almost say, forget the hands except to keep them clean, including the nails, cordial and helpful. One hand may rest easily in the other. Study repose of attitude here as well as in the rest of the body.  14. Gestures are for emphasis in public speaking; do not point elsewhere, as a rule.  15. Greet your acquaintances as you meet them with a slight bow and smile, as you speak.  16. Look the person to whom you speak in the eye. Never under any circumstances wink at another or communicate by furtive looks.  17. Should you chance to be the rejected suitor of a lady, bear in mind your own self-respect, as well as the inexorable laws {51} of society, and bow politely when you meet her. Reflect that you do not stand before all woman-kind as you do at her bar. Do not resent the bitterness of flirtation. No lady or gentleman will flirt. Remember ever that painful prediscovery is better than later disappointment. Let such experience spur you to higher exertion.  18. Discretion should be exercised in introducing persons. Of two gentlemen who are introduced, if one is superior in rank or age, he is the one to whom the introduction should be made. Of two social equals, if one be a stranger in the place, his name should be mentioned first.  19. In general the simpler the introduction the better.  20. Before introducing a gentleman to a lady, remember that she is entitled to hold you responsible for the acquaintance. The lady is the one to whom the gentleman is presented, which may be done thus: \"Miss A, permit me to introduce to you my friend, Mr. B.\"; or, \"Miss A., allow me to introduce Mr. B.\" If mutual and near friends of yours, say simply, \"Miss A., Mr. B.\"  21. Receive the introduction with a slight bow and the acknowledgment, \"Miss A., I am happy to make your acquaintance\"; or, \"Mr. B., I am pleased to meet you.\" There is no reason why such stereotyped expressions should always be used, but something similar is expected. Do not extend the hand usually.  22. A true lady will avoid familiarity in her deportment towards gentlemen. A young lady should not permit her gentlemen friends to address her by her home name, and the reverse is true. Use the title Miss and Mr. respectively.  23. Ladies should be frank and cordial towards their lady friends, but never gushing.  24. Should you meet a friend twice or oftener, at short intervals, it is polite to bow slightly each time after the first.  25. A lady on meeting a gentleman with whom she has slight acquaintance will make a medium bow--neither too decided nor too slight or stiff.  26. For a gentleman to take a young lady's arm, is to intimate that she is feeble, and young ladies resent the mode.  27. If a young lady desires to visit any public place where she expects to meet a gentleman acquaintance, she should have a chaperon to accompany her, a person of mature years when possible, and never a giddy girl.  28. A lady should not ask a gentleman to walk with her.         *       *       *       *       *   {52}  [Illustration]  A COMPLETE ETIQUETTE IN A FEW PRACTICAL RULES.  _1. If you desire to be respected, keep clean. The finest attire and decorations will add nothing to the appearance or beauty of an untidy person._  _2. Clean clothing, clean skin, clean hands, including the nails, and clean, white teeth, are a requisite passport for good society._  _3. A bad breath should be carefully remedied, whether it proceeds from the stomach or from decayed teeth._  _4. To pick the nose, finger about the ears, or scratch the head or any other part of the person, in company, is decidedly vulgar._  _5. When you call at any private residence, do not neglect to clean your shoes thoroughly._  _6. A gentleman should always remove his hat in the presence of ladies, except out of doors, and then he should lift or touch his hat in salutation. On meeting a lady a well-bred gentleman will always lift his hat._  _7. An invitation to a lecture, concert, or other entertainment, may be either verbal or written, but should always be made at least twenty-four hours before the time._ {53}  _8. On entering a hall or church the gentleman should precede the lady in walking up the aisle, or walk by her side, if the aisle is broad enough._  _9. A gentleman should always precede a lady upstairs, and follow her downstairs._  _10. Visitors should always observe the customs of the church with reference to standing, sitting, or kneeling during the services._  _11. On leaving a hall or church at the close of entertainment or services, the gentleman should precede the lady._  _12. A gentleman walking with a lady should carry the parcels, and never allow the lady to be burdened with anything of the kind._  _13. A gentleman meeting a lady on the street and wishing to speak to her, should never detain her, but may turn around and walk in the same direction she is going, until the conversation is completed._  _14. If a lady is traveling with a gentleman, simply as a friend, she should place the amount of her expenses in his hands, or insist on paying the bills herself._  _15. Never offer a lady costly gifts unless you are engaged to her, for it looks as if you were trying to purchase her goodwill; and when you make a present to a lady use no ceremony whatever._  [Illustration: Children should early be taught the lesson of Propriety and Good Manners.]  _16. Never carry on a private conversation in company. If secrecy is necessary, withdraw from the company._  _17. Never sit with your back to another without asking to be excused._  _18. It is as unbecoming for a gentleman to sit with legs crossed as it is for a lady._  _19. Never thrum with your fingers, rub your hands, yawn, or sigh aloud in company._  _20. Loud laughter, loud talking, or other boisterous manifestations should be checked in the society of others, especially on the street and in public places._ {54}  _21. When you are asked to sing or play in company, do so without being urged, or refuse in a way that shall be final; and when music is being rendered in company, show politeness to the musician by giving attention. It is very impolite to keep up a conversation. If you do not enjoy the music, keep silent._  _22. Contentions, contradictions, etc., in society should be carefully avoided._  _23. Pulling out your watch in company, unless asked the time of day, is a mark of the demi-bred. It looks as if you were tired of the company and the time dragged heavily._  _24. You should never decline to be introduced to any one or all of the guests present at a party to which you have been invited._  _25. A gentleman who escorts a lady to a party, or who has a lady placed under his care, is under particular obligations to attend to her wants and see that she has proper attention. He should introduce her to others, and endeavor to make the evening pleasant. He should escort her to the supper table and provide for her wants._  _26. To take small children or dogs with you on a visit of ceremony is altogether vulgar, though in visiting familiar friends, children are not objectionable._         *       *       *       *       *   {55} [Illustration: AN EGYPTIAN BRIDE'S WEDDING OUTFIT.]  {56}  ETIQUETTE OF CALLS.  [Illustration]  In the matter of making calls it is the correct thing:  For the caller who arrived first to leave first.  To return a first call within a week and in person.  To call promptly and in person after a first invitation.  For the mother or chaperon to invite a gentleman to call.  To call within a week after any entertainment to which one has been invited.  You should call upon an acquaintance who has recently returned from a prolonged absence.  It is proper to make the first call upon people in a higher social position, if one is asked to do so.  It is proper to call, after an engagement has been announced, or a marriage has taken place, in the family.  For the older residents in the city or street to call upon the newcomers to their neighborhood is a long recognized custom.  It is proper, after a removal from one part of the city to another, to send out cards with one's new address upon them.  To ascertain what are the prescribed hours for calling in the place where one is living, or making a visit, and to adhere to those hours is a duty that must not be overlooked.  A gentleman should ask for the lady of the house as well as the young ladies, and leave cards for her as well as for the head of the family. {57}  [Illustration: _Improve Your Speech by Reading._]         *       *       *       *       *  ETIQUETTE IN YOUR SPEECH.

The career of The Leader remains one of the mysteries of     history. This man, illegitimate and uneducated, hysterical and     superstitious, gathered about him a crowded following of those who     had been discontented, but whom he turned into fanatics. Apparently     by pure force of personality he seized without resistance the     government of one of the world's great nations. So much is unlikely     enough. But as the ruler of a civilized country he imposed upon its     people the absolute despotism of a primitive sultanate. He     honeycombed its society with spies. He imprisoned, tortured, and     executed without trial or check. And while all this went on he     received the most impassioned loyalty of his subjects! Morality was     abandoned at his command with as much alacrity as common sense. He     himself was subject to the grossest superstitions. He listened to     astrologers and fortunetellers--and executed them when they foretold     disaster. But it is not enough to be amazed at the man himself. The     great mystery is that people of the Twentieth Century, trained in     science and technically advanced, should join in this orgy of what     seems mere madness ...                                 _Concise History of Europe._ Blaisdell.         *       *       *       *       *  Letter from Professor Albrecht Aigen, University of Brunn, to the Herr General Johann von Steppberg, retired.  My dear General von Steppberg:  It is with reluctance that I intrude upon your retirement, but at the request of the Government I have undertaken a scientific examination of the causes which brought about The Leader's rise to power, the extraordinary popularity of his regime, the impassioned loyalty he was able to evoke, and the astounding final developments.  If you can communicate to me any memories of The Leader which may aid in understanding this most bewildering period of our history, I assure you that it will be appreciated by myself, by the authorities who wish the investigation made, and I dare to hope by posterity.                                     I am, my dear general, (Et cetera.)         *       *       *       *       *  Letter from General Johann von Steppberg (Retired) to Professor Albrecht Aigen, University of Brunn.  Herr Professor:  The official yearbooks of the army contain the record of my military career. I have nothing to add to that information. You say the authorities wish more. I refuse it. If they threaten my pension, I will renounce it. If they propose other pressures, I will leave the country. In short, I refuse to discuss in any manner the subject of your recent communication.                                      I am, Herr Professor, (Et cetera.)         *       *       *       *       *  Letter from Professor Albrecht Aigen to Dr. Karl Thurn, Professor of Psychology at University of Laibach.  My dear Karl:  I hope your psionic research goes better than my official project! My business goes nowhere! I have written to generals, ministers, and all kinds of persons who held high office under The Leader. Each and every one refuses to discuss The Leader or his own experiences under him. Why? Surely no one would blame them now! We have had to agree to pretend that no one did anything improper under The Leader, or else that what anyone did was proper at the time. So why should the nabobs of that incredible period refuse to discuss what they should know better than anyone else? I am almost reduced to asking the aid of the astrologers and soothsayers The Leader listened to. Actually, I must make a note to do so in sober earnest. At least they had their own viewpoint of events.  Speaking of viewpoints, I have had some hope of clarifying The Leader's career by comparing it with that of Prime Minister Winston, in power in his country when The Leader ruled ours. His career is splendidly documented. There is astonishingly little documentation about The Leader as a person, however. That is one of the difficulties of my task. Even worse, those who should know him best lock their lips while those--  Here is an unsolicited letter from the janitor of a building in which a former Minister of Education now has his law offices. I have many letters equally preposterous....         *       *       *       *       *  Enclosure in letter to Dr. Karl Thurn, University of Laibach.  Herr Professor:  I am the janitor of the building in which Herr Former Minister of Education Werfen has his offices. In cleaning there I saw a letter crumpled into a ball and thrown into a corner. I learned in the time of The Leader that angry actions often mean evil intentions, so I read the letter to see if the police should be notified. It was a letter from you in which you asked Herr Former Minister of Education Werfen for his memories of The Leader.  I remember The Leader, Herr Professor. He was the most holy man who ever lived, if indeed he was only a man. Once I passed the open door of an office in the building I then worked in. I looked in the door--it was the office of the then-struggling Party The Leader had founded--and I saw The Leader sitting in a chair, thinking. There was golden light about his head, Herr Professor. I have told this to other people and they do not believe me. There were shadowy other beings in the room. I saw, very faintly, great white wings. But the other beings were still because The Leader was thinking and did not wish to be disturbed. I assure you that this is true, Herr Professor. The Leader was the holiest of men--if he was only a man.                    I am most respectfully, Herr Professor, (Et cetera.)         *       *       *       *       *  Letter from Fraulein Lise Grauer, nurse, in the city of Bludenz, to Professor Aigen at Brunn University.  Most respected Herr Professor:  I write this at the request of the Herr Former Police Inspector Grieg, to whom you directed a letter shortly before his death. The Herr Former Police Inspector had been ill for some time. I was his nurse. I had cared for him for months and did many small services for him, such as writing letters at his direction.  When your letter came he read it and went into a black mood of deep and bitter recollection. He would not speak for hours, and I had great difficulty in getting him to take his medicines. Just before his bedtime he called me and said sardonically;  \"Lise, write to this Herr Professor for me. Say to him that I was once a decent man. When The Leader took power, I received orders that I would not accept. I submitted my resignation. Then I received orders to come to The Leader. I obeyed these orders because my resignation was not yet accepted. I was received in his office. I entered it with respect and defiance--respect because he was admitted to be the ruler of our nation; defiance because I would not obey such orders as had been sent me in his name.  \"The Leader spoke to me, kindly, and as he spoke all my views changed. It suddenly seemed that I had been absurd to refuse the orders sent me. They seemed right and reasonable and even more lenient than would have been justified.... I left The Leader in a state in which I could not possibly fail to do anything he wished. From that moment I obeyed his orders. I was promoted. Eventually, as you know, I was in command of the Neusatz prison camp. And you know what orders I carried out there!\"  I wept, Herr Professor, because the Herr Grieg's eyes were terrible to look at. He was a gentle and kindly man, Herr Professor! I was his nurse, and he was a good patient and a good man in every way. I had heard of the things that were done at Neusatz, but I could not believe that my patient had commanded them. Now, in his eyes I saw that he remembered them and that the memory was intolerable. He said very bitterly:  \"Tell the Herr Professor that I can tell him nothing more. I have no other memories that would be of service to him. I have resolved, anyhow, to get rid even of these. I have kept them too long. Say to him that his letter has decided me.\"  I did not understand what he meant, Herr Professor. I helped him prepare for the night, and when he seemed to be resting quietly I retired, myself. I was wakened by a very loud noise. I went to see what was the matter. The Herr Former Police Inspector Grieg had managed to get out of his bed and across the room to a bureau. He opened a drawer and took out a revolver. He made his way back to his bed. He blew out his brains.  I called the police, and after investigation they instructed me to carry out his request, which I do.  Herr Professor, I do not myself remember the times of The Leader, but they must have been very terrible. If the Herr Former Police Inspector Grieg was actually in command of the Neusatz prison camp, and did actually order the things done there,--I cannot understand it, Herr Professor! Because he was a good and kindly man! If you write of him, I beg that you will mention that he was a most amiable man. I was only his nurse, but I assure you--(Et cetera.)         *       *       *       *       *  Letter from Dr. Karl Thurn, University of Laibach, to Professor Albrecht Aigen, University of Brunn.  My dear friend:  I could have predicted your failure to secure co-operation from eminent figures in The Leader's regime. So long as they keep silent, together, they can pretend to be respectable. And nobody longs so passionately to be respectable as a man who has prospered by being a swine, while he awaits an opportunity to prosper again by more swinishness. I would advise you to expect your best information from little people who suffered most and most helplessly looked on or helped while enormities were committed.
