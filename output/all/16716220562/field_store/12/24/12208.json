As he approached this fearful tree he thought he saw something white hanging in the midst of it, but on looking more narrowly he perceived it was a place where it had been scathed by lightning and the white wood laid bare. About two hundred yards from the tree a small brook crossed the road; and as he drew near he beheld--on the margin of this brook, and in the dark shadow of the grove--he beheld something huge, misshapen, black, and towering. It stirred not, but seemed gathered up in the gloom like some gigantic monster ready to spring upon the traveller.  He demanded, in stammering accents, \"Who are you?\" He received no reply. He repeated his demand in a still more agitated voice. Still there was no answer. And then the shadowy object of alarm put itself in motion, and with a scramble and a bound stood in the middle of the road. He appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions and mounted on a black horse of powerful frame. Having no relish for this strange midnight companion, Cosmo Waynflete urged on his steed in hopes of leaving the apparition behind; but the stranger quickened his horse also to an equal pace. And when the first horseman pulled up, thinking to lag behind, the second did likewise. There was something in the moody and dogged silence of this pertinacious companion that was mysterious and appalling. It was soon fearfully accounted for. On mounting a rising ground which brought the figure of his fellow-traveller against the sky, gigantic in height and muffled in a cloak, he was horror-struck to discover the stranger was headless!--but his horror was still more increased in observing that the head which should have rested on the shoulders was carried before the body on the pommel of the saddle.  The terror of Cosmo Waynflete rose to desperation, and he spurred his steed suddenly in the hope of giving his weird companion the slip. But the headless horseman started full jump with him. His own horse, as though possessed by a demon, plunged headlong down the hill. He could hear, however, the black steed panting and blowing close behind him; he even fancied that he felt the hot breath of the pursuer. When he ventured at last to cast a look behind, he saw the goblin rising in the stirrups, and in the very act of hurling at him the grisly head. He fell out of the saddle to the ground; and the black steed and the goblin rider passed by him like a whirlwind.   VI  How long he lay there by the roadside, stunned and motionless, he could not guess; but when he came to himself at last the sun was already high in the heavens. He discovered himself to be reclining on the tall grass of a pleasant graveyard which surrounded a tiny country church in the outskirts of a pretty little village. It was in the early summer, and the foliage was green above him as the boughs swayed gently to and fro in the morning breeze. The birds were singing gayly as they flitted about over his head. The bees hummed along from flower to flower. At last, so it seemed to him, he had come into a land of peace and quiet, where there was rest and comfort and where no man need go in fear of his life. It was a country where vengeance was not a duty and where midnight combats were not a custom he found himself smiling as he thought that a grisly dragon and a goblin rider would be equally out of place in this laughing landscape.  Then the bell in the steeple of the little church began to ring merrily, and he rose to his feet in expectation. All of a sudden the knowledge came to him why it was that they were ringing. He wondered then why the coming of the bride was thus delayed. He knew himself to be a lover, with life opening brightly before him; and the world seemed to him sweeter than ever before and more beautiful.  Then at last the girl whom he loved with his whole heart and who had promised to marry him appeared in the distance, and he thought he had never seen her look more lovely. As he beheld his bridal party approaching, he slipped into the church to await her at the altar. The sunshine fell full upon the portal and made a halo about the girl's head as she crossed the threshold.  But even when the bride stood by his side and the clergyman had begun the solemn service of the church the bells kept on, and soon their chiming became a clangor, louder and sharper and more insistent.   VII  So clamorous and so persistent was the ringing that Cosmo Waynflete was roused at last. He found himself suddenly standing on his feet, with his hand clutching the back of the chair in which he had been sitting before the fire when the rays of the setting sun had set long ago. The room was dark, for it was lighted now only by the embers of the burnt-out fire; and the electric bell was ringing steadily, as though the man outside the door had resolved to waken the seven sleepers.  Then Cosmo Waynflete was wide-awake again; and he knew where he was once more--not in Japan, not in Persia, not in Lisbon, not in Sleepy Hollow, but here in New York, in his own room, before his own fire. He opened the door at once and admitted his friend, Paul Stuyvesant.  \"It isn't dinner-time, is it?\" he asked. \"I'm not late, am I? The fact is, I've been asleep.\"  \"It is so good of you to confess that,\" his friend answered, laughing; \"although the length of time you kept me waiting and ringing might have led me to suspect it. No, you are not late and it is not dinner-time. I've come around to have another little chat with you before dinner, that's all.\"  \"Take this chair, old man,\" said Cosmo, as he threw another hickory-stick on the fire. Then he lighted the gas and sat down by the side of his friend.  \"This chair is comfortable, for a fact,\" Stuyvesant declared, stretching himself out luxuriously. \"No wonder you went to sleep. What did you dream of?--strange places you had seen in your travels or the homely scenes of your native land.\"  Waynflete looked at his friend for a moment without answering the question. He was startled as he recalled the extraordinary series of adventures which had fallen to his lot since he had fixed his gaze on the crystal ball. It seemed to him as though he had been whirled through space and through time.  \"I suppose every man is always the hero of his own dreams,\" he began, doubtfully.  \"Of course,\" his friend returned; \"in sleep our natural and healthy egotism is absolutely unrestrained. It doesn't make any matter where the scene is laid or whether the play is a comedy or a tragedy, the dreamer has always the centre of the stage, with the calcium light turned full on him.\"  \"That's just it,\" Waynflete went on; \"this dream of mine makes me feel as if I were an actor, and as if I had been playing many parts, one after the other, in the swiftest succession. They are not familiar to me, and yet I confess to a vague feeling of unoriginality. It is as though I were a plagiarist of adventure--if that be a possible supposition. I have just gone through these startling situations myself, and yet I'm sure that they have all of them happened before--although, perhaps, not to any one man. Indeed, no one man could have had all these adventures of mine, because I see now that I have been whisked through the centuries and across the hemispheres with a suddenness possible only in dreams. Yet all my experiences seem somehow second-hand, and not really my own.\"  \"Picked up here and there--like your bric-Ã -brac?\" suggested Stuyvesant. \"But what are these alluring adventures of yours that stretched through the ages and across the continents?\"  Then, knowing how fond his friend was of solving mysteries and how proud he was of his skill in this art, Cosmo Waynflete narrated his dream as it has been set down in these pages.  When he had made an end, Paul Stuyvesant's first remark was: \"I'm sorry I happened along just then and waked you up before you had time to get married.\"  His second remark followed half a minute later.  \"I see how it was,\" he said; \"you were sitting in this chair and looking at that crystal ball, which focussed the level rays of the setting sun, I suppose? Then it is plain enough--you hypnotized yourself!\"  \"I have heard that such a thing is possible,\" responded Cosmo.\"  \"Possible?\" Stuyvesant returned, \"it is certain! But what is more curious is the new way in which you combined your self-hypnotism with crystal-gazing. You have heard of scrying, I suppose?\"  \"You mean the practice of looking into a drop of water or a crystal ball or anything of that sort,\" said Cosmo, \"and of seeing things in it--of seeing people moving about?\"  \"That's just what I do mean,\" his friend returned. \"And that's just what you have been doing. You fixed your gaze on the ball, and so hypnotized yourself; and then, in the intensity of your vision, you were able to see figures in the crystal--with one of which visualized emanations you immediately identified yourself. That's easy enough, I think. But I don't see what suggested to you your separate experiences. I recognize them, of course----\"  \"You recognize them?\" cried Waynflete, in wonder.  \"I can tell you where you borrowed every one of your adventures,\" Stuyvesant replied, \"But what I'd like to know now is what suggested to you just those particular characters and situations, and not any of the many others also stored away in your subconsciousness.\"  So saying, he began to look about the room.  \"My subconsciousness?\" repeated Waynflete. \"Have I ever been a samurai in my subconsciousness?\"  Paul Stuyvesant looked at Cosmo Waynflete for nearly a minute without reply. Then all the answer he made was to say: \"That's a queer dressing-gown you have on.\"  \"It is time I took it off,\" said the other, as he twisted himself out of its clinging folds. \"It is a beautiful specimen of weaving, isn't it? I call it the dream-gown of the Japanese ambassador, for although I bought it in a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23678"],["title","Tales of Fantasy and Fact (#8)"],["body","ity-shop in Nuremberg, it was once, I really believe, the slumber-robe of an Oriental envoy.\"  Stuyvesant took the silken garment from his friend's hand.  \"Why did the Japanese ambassador sell you his dream-gown in a Nuremberg curiosity-shop?\" he asked.  \"He didn't,\" Waynflete explained. \"I never saw the ambassador, and neither did the old German lady who kept the shop. She told me she bought it from a Japanese acrobat who was out of an engagement and desperately hard up. But she told me also that the acrobat had told her that the garment had belonged to an ambassador who had given it to him as a reward of his skill, and that he never would have parted with it if he had not been dead-broke.\"  Stuyvesant held the robe up to the light and inspected the embroidery on the skirt of it.  \"Yes,\" he said, at last, \"this would account for it, I suppose. This bit here was probably meant to suggest 'the well where the head was washed,'--see?\"  \"I see that those lines may be meant to represent the outline of a spring of water, but I don't see what that has to do with my dream,\" Waynflete answered.  \"Don't you?\" Stuyvesant returned. \"Then I'll show you. You had on this silk garment embroidered here with an outline of the well in which was washed the head of Kotsuke no Suke, the man whom the Forty-Seven Ronins killed. You know the story?\"  \"I read it in Japan, but----\" began Cosmo.  \"You had that story stored away in your subconsciousness,\" interrupted his friend. \"And when you hypnotized yourself by peering into the crystal ball, this embroidery it was which suggested to you to see yourself as the hero of the tale--Oishi Kuranosuke, the chief of the Forty-Seven Ronins, the faithful follower who avenged his master by pretending to be vicious and dissipated--just like Brutus and Lorenzaccio--until the enemy was off his guard and open to attack.\"  \"I think I do recall the tale of the Forty-Seven Ronins, but only very vaguely,\" said the hero of the dream. \"For all I know I may have had the adventure of Oishi Kuranosuke laid on the shelf somewhere in my subconsciousness, as you want me to believe. But how about my Persian dragon and my Iberian noblewoman?\"  Paul Stuyvesant was examining the dream-gown of the Japanese ambassador with minute care. Suddenly he said, \"Oh!\" and then he looked up at Cosmo Waynflete and asked: \"What are those buttons? They seem to be old coins.\"  \"They are old coins,\" the other answered; \"it was a fancy of mine to utilize them on that Japanese dressing-gown. They are all different, you see. The first is----\"  \"Persian, isn't it?\" interrupted Stuyvesant.  \"Yes,\" Waynflete explained, \"it is a Persian daric. And the second is a Spanish peso made at Potosi under Philip II. for use in America. And the third is a York shilling, one of the coins in circulation here in New York at the time of the Revolution--I got that one, in fact, from the farmer who ploughed it up in a field at Tarrytown, near Sunnyside.\"  \"Then there are three of your adventures accounted for, Cosmo, and easily enough,\" Paul commented, with obvious satisfaction at his own explanation. \"Just as the embroidery on the silk here suggested to you--after you had hypnotized yourself--that you were the chief of the Forty-Seven Ronins, so this first coin here in turn suggested to you that you were Rustem, the hero of the 'Epic of Kings.' You have read the 'Shah-Nameh?'\"  \"I remember Firdausi's poem after a fashion only,\" Cosmo answered. \"Was not Rustem a Persian Hercules, so to speak?\"  \"That's it precisely,\" the other responded, \"and he had seven labors to perform; and you dreamed the third of them, the slaying of the grisly dragon. For my own part, I think I should have preferred the fourth of them, the meeting with the lovely enchantress; but that's neither here nor there.\"  \"It seems to me I do recollect something about that fight of Rustem and the strange beast. The faithful horse's name was Rakush, wasn't it?\" asked Waynflete.  \"If you can recollect the 'Shah-Nameh,'\" Stuyvesant pursued, \"no doubt you can recall also Beaumont and Fletcher's 'Custom of the Country?' That's where you got the midnight duel in Lisbon and the magnanimous mother, you know.\"  \"No, I didn't know,\" the other declared.  \"Well, you did, for all that,\" Paul went on. \"The situation is taken from one in a drama of Calderon's, and it was much strengthened in the taking. You may not now remember having read the play, but the incident must have been familiar to you, or else your subconsciousness couldn't have yielded it up to you so readily at the suggestion of the Spanish coin, could it?\"  \"I did read a lot of Elizabethan drama in my senior year at college,\" admitted Cosmo, \"and this piece of Beaumont and Fletcher's may have been one of those I read; but I totally fail to recall now what it was all about.\"  \"You won't have the cheek to declare that you don't remember the 'Legend of Sleepy Hollow,' will you?\" asked Stuyvesant. \"Very obviously it was the adventure of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman that the York shilling suggested to you.\"  \"I'll admit that I do recollect Irving's story now,\" the other confessed.  \"So the embroidery on the dream-gown gives the first of your strange situations; and the three others were suggested by the coins you have been using as buttons,\" said Paul Stuyvesant. \"There is only one thing now that puzzles me: that is the country church and the noon wedding and the beautiful bride.\"  And with that he turned over the folds of the silken garment that hung over his arm.  Cosmo Waynflete hesitated a moment and a blush mantled his cheek. Then he looked his friend in the face and said: \"I think I can account for my dreaming about her--I can account for that easily enough.\"  \"So can I,\" said Paul Stuyvesant, as he held up the photograph of a lovely American girl that he had just found in the pocket of the dream-gown of the Japanese ambassador.  (1896.)     THE RIVAL GHOSTS   The good ship sped on her way across the calm Atlantic. It was an outward passage, according to the little charts which the company had charily distributed, but most of the passengers were homeward bound, after a summer of rest and recreation, and they were counting the days before they might hope to see Fire Island Light. On the lee side of the boat, comfortably sheltered from the wind, and just by the door of the captain's room (which was theirs during the day), sat a little group of returning Americans. The Duchess (she was down on the purser's list as Mrs. Martin, but her friends and familiars called her the Duchess of Washington Square) and Baby Van Rensselaer (she was quite old enough to vote, had her sex been entitled to that duty, but as the younger of two sisters she was still the baby of the family)--the Duchess and Baby Van Rensselaer were discussing the pleasant English voice and the not unpleasant English accent of a manly young lordling who was going to America for sport. Uncle Larry and Dear Jones were enticing each other into a bet on the ship's run of the morrow.  \"I'll give you two to one she don't make 420,\" said Dear Jones.  \"I'll take it,\" answered Uncle Larry. \"We made 427 the fifth day last year.\" It was Uncle Larry's seventeenth visit to Europe, and this was therefore his thirty-fourth voyage.  \"And when did you get in?\" asked Baby Van Rensselaer. \"I don't care a bit about the run, so long as we get in soon.\"  \"We crossed the bar Sunday night, just seven days after we left Queenstown, and we dropped anchor off Quarantine at three o'clock on Monday morning.\"  \"I hope we sha'n't do that this time. I can't seem to sleep any when the boat stops.\"  \"I can, but I didn't,\" continued Uncle Larry, \"because my state-room was the most for'ard in the boat, and the donkey-engine that let down the anchor was right over my head.\"  \"So you got up and saw the sun rise over the bay,\" said Dear Jones, \"with the electric lights of the city twinkling in the distance, and the first faint flush of the dawn in the east just over Fort Lafayette, and the rosy tinge which spread softly upward, and----\"  \"Did you both come back together?\" asked the Duchess.  \"Because he has crossed thirty-four times you must not suppose he has a monopoly in sunrises,\" retorted Dear Jones. \"No; this was my own sunrise; and a mighty pretty one it was too.\"  \"I'm not matching sunrises with you,\" remarked Uncle Larry calmly; \"but I'm willing to back a merry jest called forth by my sunrise against any two merry jests called forth by yours.\"  \"I confess reluctantly that my sunrise evoked no merry jest at all.\" Dear Jones was an honest man, and would scorn to invent a merry jest on the spur of the moment.  \"That's where my sunrise has the call,\" said Uncle Larry, complacently.  \"What was the merry jest?\" was Baby Van Rensselaer's inquiry, the natural result of a feminine curiosity thus artistically excited.  \"Well, here it is. I was standing aft, near a patriotic American and a wandering Irishman, and the patriotic American rashly declared that you couldn't see a sunrise like that anywhere in Europe, and this gave the Irishman his chance, and he said, 'Sure ye don't have 'm here till we're through with 'em over there.'\"  \"It is true,\" said Dear Jones, thoughtfully, \"that they do have some things over there better than we do; for instance, umbrellas.\"  \"And gowns,\" added the Duchess.  \"And antiquities\"--this was Uncle Larry's contribution.  \"And we do have some things so much better in America!\" protested Baby Van Rensselaer, as yet uncorrupted by any worship of the effete monarchies of despotic Europe. \"We make lots of things a great deal nicer than you can get them in Europe--especially ice-cream.\"  \"And pretty girls,\" added Dear Jones; but he did not look at her.  \"And spooks,\" remarked Uncle Larry, casually.  \"Spooks?\" queried the Duchess.  \"Spooks. I maintain the word. Ghost, if you like that better, or spectres. We turn out the best quality of spook----\"  \"You forget the lovely ghost stories"]]]
