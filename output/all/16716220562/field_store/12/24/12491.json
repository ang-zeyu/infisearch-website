He gazed fixedly in the face of the youth, as if uncertain what he ought to answer, and then he walked to the head of the stairs.  \"Wait here--don't come.\"  And, without anything more, he went down the steps slowly, and without the slightest noise. Melville listened, but could hear nothing of his footfalls, though certain that he was moving across the floor.  \"I don't like this,\" muttered the lad, compressing his lips and shaking his head; \"it makes me uneasy.\"  He was now in the lower story, where he left his rifle, knife, and tomahawk. He was therefore more fully armed than the youth, and, if he chose to play the traitor, there was nothing to prevent it.  It seemed to Melville that the coming of the larger party was likely to change whatever plans Red Feather might have formed for befriending him and his sister. What more probable than that he had decided to return to his first love?  But speculation could go on this way for ever, and without reaching any result.  \"I'll do as I have done all along,\" he muttered; \"I'll trust in Heaven and do the best I can. I'm sure of one thing,\" he added; \"whatever comes, Red Feather won't hurt Dot: he has spared me on her account: and if he turns against me now, he will do what he can to save her. Therefore I'll make use of the little one.\"  Dot had held her peace through these trying moments, but he now called her to him and explained what he wished her to do. It was that she should place herself at the head of the stairs and watch Red Feather. In case he started to open the door, or to come up the stairs, she was to tell him. Dot was beginning to understand more clearly than before the situation in which she was placed. The belief that she could be of some use to her brother made her more anxious than ever to do her part. She walked to the head of the stairs and sat down where she could see what went on below.  Returning to his place at the window, Melville found enough to interest him without thinking of Red Feather.  [Illustration: \"The whole party broke out in a series of yells.\"--Page 63]  The band from the Muddy Creek country had just arrived, and as nearly as he could judge, there were fully a score--all wild, ugly-looking fellows, eager for mischief. They had just galloped up the hill, where they gathered round the man that had first signalled them, he having ridden forward to meet them. They talked for several minutes, evidently to learn what had taken place in and around the Clarendon cabin.  This was soon made clear to them, and then the whole party broke into a series of yells enough to startle the bravest man. At the same time they began riding rapidly back and forth, swinging their rifles over their heads, swaying their bodies first on one side and then on another, and apparently growing more excited every minute.  At first they described short circles on the prairie, and then suddenly extended them so as to pass entirely around the house.  The Sioux, as they came in sight in front of the cabin, were in such a fire range that the youth felt sure he could bring down a warrior at every shot. He was tempted to do so, but restrained himself.  He reflected that, though several shots had been fired, no one, so far as he knew, had been hurt on either side. He had brought his own rifle to his shoulder more than once, and but a feather's weight more pressure on the trigger would have discharged it, but he was glad he had not done so.  \"I shall not shoot any one,\" he said, determinedly, \"until I see it must be done for the sake of Dot or myself. I wonder what Red Feather is at?\"  Dot was still sitting at the head of the stairs, dividing her attention between Susie her doll and the chieftain. Stepping softly toward her, Melville asked--  \"What is he doing, Dot?\"  \"Nothing.\"  \"Where is he standing?\"  \"Beside the front window, looking out just like you did a minute ago.\"  This was reassuring information, and helped to drive away the fear that had troubled the youth ever since the Sioux passed below stairs.  \"Mel,\" called his sister the next minute, \"I'm awful hungry; ain't it past dinner-time?\"  \"I'm afraid there is nothing to eat in the house.\"  \"I'm awful thirsty, too.\"  \"I feel a little that way myself, but I don't believe there is anything to eat or drink. You know, father and mother didn't expect us to stay here, or they would have left something for us.\"  \"Can't I go downstairs and look?\"  \"Yes, if you will keep away from the windows, and tell Red Feather what you are doing.\"  \"Hasn't he got eyes that he can see for himself?\" asked the little one as she hurried down the steps.  The chief looked around when he heard the dainty steps, wondering what errand brought her downstairs.  \"Red Feather,\" said the young lady, \"I'm hungry; ain't you?\"  \"No--me no hungry,\" he answered, his dark face lighting up with pleasure at sight of the picture of innocence.  \"Then you must have eaten an awful big breakfast this morning,\" remarked Dot, walking straight to the cupboard in the farther corner of the room, into which Melville had glanced when he first entered the house; \"I know where mother keeps her jam and nice things.\"  That she knew where the delicacies were stored Dot proved the next minute, when, to her delight, she found everything that heart, or rather appetite, could wish.  There were a jar of currant jam, a pan of cool milk, on which a thick crust of yellow cream had formed, three-fourths of a loaf of bread, and an abundance of butter. Good Mrs. Clarendon left them behind because she had an abundance without them. Little did she dream of the good service they were destined to do.  Dot uttered such a cry of delight that the chief walked toward her, and Melville seized the excuse to hurry below.  The first thing that struck him was that Red Feather's tomahawk and knife still lay in the corner where he had placed them. He simply held his rifle which most likely he was ready to use against his own people whenever the necessity arose.  \"Well, Dot, you _have_ found a prize,\" said her brother, following the chief, who was looking over her shoulder; \"I had no idea that mother had left anything behind; there's enough for all.\"  She insisted that the others should partake while she waited, but neither would permit it. No matter how a-hungered either might have been, he enjoyed the sight of seeing her eat tenfold more than in partaking himself.  And you may be sure that Dot did ample justice to the rich find. Melville cut a thick slice for her, and spread the butter and jam on it, while a portion of the milk was poured into a cup.  I never heard of a little girl who could eat a piece of bread well covered with jam or preserves without failing to get most of it on her mouth. Dot Clarendon was no exception to the rule; and before she was through a goodly part of it, the sticky sweet stuff was on her cheeks and nose. When she looked up at the two who were watching her, the sight was so comical that Red Feather did that which I do not believe he had done a dozen times in all his life--he threw back his head and laughed loud. Melville caught the contagion and gave way to his mirth, which was increased by the naive remark of Dot that she couldn't see anything to laugh at.  [Illustration: \"He threw back his head and laughed loud.\"]  The appetite of the young queen having been satisfied, Melville insisted on Red Feather sharing what was left with him. The Sioux declined at first, but yielded, and the remaining bread and milk furnished them a grateful and nourishing repast. They did not use all, but saved enough to supply another meal for Dot, whose appetite was sure to make itself felt before many hours passed by.  Like most boys of his age in these later days, Melville Clarendon carried a watch, which showed that it was past three o'clock in the afternoon. This was considerably later than he supposed, and proved that in the rush of incidents time had passed faster than he had suspected.  \"What shall I do?\" asked the youth, turning to the chief.  \"Go--up up,\" he replied, pointing up the steps; \"watch out. Red Feather--he watch out here.\"  \"Do you want Dot to stay with you?\" asked Melville, pausing on his way to the steps.  \"Leave wid Red Feather--he take heap care ob pappoose.\"  \"There can be no doubt of _that_,\" remarked the brother, as he bounded up the stairs, resuming his former station near the window.  Looking out with the same care he had shown from the first, he found the Sioux had grown tired of galloping round the house and buildings, or they were plotting some other kind of mischief, for only one of them was in sight.  He was seated on his pony on the crest of the hill from which the signals were made to the Muddy Creek warriors. A moment's study of the red men showed that his attention was directed not toward the west but the north, in the direction of the settlement.  \"He is now looking for enemies instead of friends,\" was the conclusion of Melville.  The truth was, the youth was beginning to wonder why the settlers did not come. If no accident had befallen his parents, they ought to have reached Barwell several hours before, and a gallop of ten miles was only a moderate ride for a party of horsemen eager to strike the marauders a blow.  But the fact that they were not yet in sight set the youth speculating as to what the result was likely to be if they did not come at all, or rather, if their coming should be delayed until nightfall, for it was not to be supposed that relief would not be sent sooner or later.  \"There is only a faint moon to-night,\" he reflected; \"and I'm afraid that's against us.\"  The American Indian prefers to do his mischief in the dark, and, since it would be impossible for the horsemen to conceal their approach, they would be likely to suffer in the first collision with the red men.  But, on the other hand, would not the gloom be of help"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24097"],["title","The Story of Red Feather: A Tale of the American Frontier (#8)"],["body","Red Feather in some scheme doubtless formed to help the children whose friend he had so suddenly become?  What the nature of this scheme was (if such existed) Melville could not guess; it might be that it required a bright moon for its success.  It may be said that the Sioux chieftain, as he stood beside one of the narrow windows on the lower floor, racked his brain until he hit upon a way of aiding the brother and sister--especially the latter--in their desperate peril. It was a strange plan, indeed, and, with all his adroitness, he knew the chances were ten to one against its success.  But the chief gave no hint to Melville of what was going on in his mind, and the latter could only wait, and hope and pray that the same Heavenly Father who had protected and preserved them thus far would keep them to the end.  The youth was in the midst of his speculations over the matter when he fancied he detected a peculiar odor from the outside. He could not tell its nature, though he snuffed the air repeatedly. He was alarmed, for he connected it with the silence of the war-party outside.  He was on the point of appealing to Red Feather downstairs, when its nature flashed upon him. _It was smoke!_  He had hardly reached the decision when a mass of thick vapor rolled in front of the house, so dense and blinding that for the moment it shut from his sight the mounted sentinel on the hill.  What was dreaded by the besieged had come at last. The Sioux, aware of the great value of the minutes, had resorted to the torch.     CHAPTER SEVEN  \"A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM.\"--SURROUNDED BY PERIL   Within a distance of a dozen yards of the house of Archibald Clarendon stood his barn. It was what might be called a nondescript building, being open at the bottom to an extent sufficient to admit his wagons, ploughs, farming implements, harnesses, and indeed about everything used in the cultivation of the fertile land.  In the upper portion were stowed his hay and grain, and in the rear of the lower part were the stables for his horses and cows. The latter, with his principal wagon, had been removed that morning, when the settler started with his family on their hasty flight northward to the settlement of Barwell; but the timber was dry, and enough hay was stored in the loft to render the building very combustible.  It was to this structure that the Sioux had applied the torch, and at the moment the smoke rolled in front of the house the whole building was in flames. Unfortunately, there was a gentle breeze blowing from the barn directly toward the house, and it was because of this favoring fact that the former was fired. The marauders had every reason to believe the flames would soon communicate with the dwelling and burn it to the ground.  The barn faced the end with the broad stone chimney, through which Red Feather made his singular entrance. It was therefore out of the field of vision of the inmates, since there was not a single window up or down stairs with an outlook in that direction.  Melville started to run down the steps on making the startling discovery, but met Red Feather coming up with one hand grasping that of Dot.  \"My gracious!\" exclaimed the youth; \"what can be done now, Red Feather? We shall all be burned alive.\"  \"Oogh! not yet--house ain't afire!\" replied the chieftain, without any evidence of excitement.  \"But the wind is blowing this way, and the house is sure to go.\"  \"Mebbe go--mebbe won't go,\" was the reply with the same stolidity of manner; \"wait--see bimeby.\"  It would seem that, since the Sioux had such a good chance to do mischief, they would have applied the fire to the house itself. But, though the logs were dry enough to burn readily when the flames were fairly started, it was still a task requiring considerable time and work. It was necessary to pile the fuel against the logs, and to nurse the flames until they set the heavy material going. The barn was so inflammable that a tiny match would ignite it, and, should the fire reach the house, the task would be equally effective, and far more enjoyable to the cruel spectators.  [Illustration: \"It was to this structure that the Sioux had applied the torch.\"--Page 69]  While Red Feather and Melville stood near each other on the upper floor, talking in low tones, Dot slipped her hand from the grasp of the chieftain, and walking to the side of the bed on which she had been lying, knelt down, closed her eyes, and clasped her hands, just as she had been accustomed to do at her mother's knee ever since she was old enough to form the words after her parent.  \"She is praying,\" whispered her brother.  After repeating a simple prayer for their safety the child opened her eyes, and, seeing her friends looking at her, she sprang nimbly up and ran to them.  \"Don't be scared, brother and Red Feather; I prayed that we might all be taken care of, and I'm not afraid one bit now, are you?\"  Melville tried to speak, but his voice choked him. His eyes filled, and, lifting the precious one in his arms, he pressed her to his breast and kissed her again and again.  The chieftain said nothing, but he too raised the child in his arms and touched his lips to hers. Not only that, but he filled her with delight by saluting Susie in the same manner.  Who shall try to make known the emotions which stirred that savage heart? He had often turned in scorn from the words of the good missionaries who had come to his country; but there was something in the faith of the sweet child which touched his nature as it had never been touched before.  Having set the little one on her feet, the Sioux stepped across the main room to the window from which most of their observations had been made on that floor. Melville followed him, and noticed that the smoke had vanished, so that the sentinel on the hill was in sight again.  Red Feather thrust his hand through the windows, so that his fingers projected slightly beyond. This was done to ascertain the direction of the wind.  \"Oogh!\" he muttered, with a curious expression on his countenance \"_wind blow oder way!_ Great Spirit hear what pappoose say.\"  \"Can it be possible?\" asked the awed Melville.  There was no doubt of it; the slight breeze, which had been coming directly from the barn toward the house had changed, and was now blowing in exactly the opposite direction.  The chief and the youth passed into the smaller apartment which was nearest the chimney. The former pressed his ear against the logs to help his hearing. Had they caught the flames from the barn, which was still burning furiously, he could not have failed to detect the fact. A moment's attention told him that up to the present the building was safe.  But it was not in the nature of things that the Sioux should refrain because their first effort failed. They were not the ones to give up on a single trial.  Several noteworthy things took place during the latter part of this eventful afternoon. First of all, there was such a decided lowering of the temperature that a fire would have felt comfortable to the occupants of the building. It looked indeed to Melville as though one of those fearful storms known in the west as \"blizzards\" was approaching.  This was hardly possible, for it was summer-time, but the plains of Texas and many portions of the west are often swept by what are termed \"northers\" during the warm season. These winds are accompanied by such cutting cold that people and animals often perish, the suddenness of the visitation shutting them out from securing refuge.  Red Feather offered his blanket to Dot, but she shook her head. \"It's too dirty,\" she said, noticing the soot which the owner did not seem to mind; \"I can use a blanket from the bed, for mamma did not take them all with her.\"  Had Melville suspected the thought in the mind of his little sister, he would have checked its utterance through fear of offending the chieftain, but there was no need of that: one of the impossibilities was for Dot to hurt his feelings.  The next most interesting event was the second failure of the Sioux to set fire to the house. This was singular, for there seemed no reason why they should not have succeeded with such facilities at command.  The barn burned so readily that long before dusk it was reduced to a mass of smoking ruins.  From these, it would have appeared, enough brands could have been collected to make a bonfire of the structure.  Several of the Sioux gathered fuel at one corner of the building, and made an attempt to fire it. The sounds which reached those within left no doubt of what was going on, and you may be sure they listened with anxiety.  It was while matters were in this critical shape that Melville put the direct question to Red Feather as to what he would do in the event of the house being fired. The chieftain replied that, when he saw there was no saving the building, he intended to take Dot in his arms and walk out of the door among his own warriors. The lad was to follow immediately, and he would insist that the lives of the children should be spared because of the promise made by him to them.  Pressed further, the chief admitted that the plan was likely to be only partially successful. He was confident he could save Dot, because of her sex and years; but there was little hope for Melville. Unless prevented by the care of the little girl, Red Feather was willing to join in the fight which the youth would have to make for his life with scarcely an earthly prospect of winning.  But the attempt to fire the log structure came to naught, and, strangest of all, the Sioux gave it up--at least for a time, for it would have been contrary to Indian nature had they abandoned the effort to destroy their enemies so long as there was a chance of success.  Thus matters stood until the shadows of night began closing over the prairie. During the interval, many glimpses of the Sioux had been caught, as they moved backward and forward at will, sometimes mounted and often on foot."]]]
