The whole audience sprang to their feet. Several bands began to play their most inspiring music. Men swung their hats and grasped each other by the hand; women and children waved their handkerchiefs, and many wept for very joy. As it rested at length in its old place at the top of the staff, and waved its victorious folds towards the recovered city, which had first disowned it, the enthusiasm became tumultuous and overpowering, till at last it found relief in the national song:       \"The star spangled banner, O long may it wave,      O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!\"  I can never forget the impression of that glorious spectacle, and that song of victory that went up from five thousand voices. The colored soldier pacing to and fro, with beating heart and gazing aloft with pride upon the \"flag of the free hearts' hope and home,\" could now exclaim, \"Yes, that is now _my_ flag! and yonder, at Fort Wagner, the colored soldier fought and died to restore it. Four years ago, when that flag went down, more than four millions of my people _had_ no flag! But to-day it is _our_ flag, and _our_ country!\"  Immediately followed the grand artillery salute to the flag; and I left my seat and climbed the look-out high above upon the wall to obtain an unobstructed view of the bay. First, the heavy guns of Sumter thundered forth their hearty greeting to the flag. Then, in loyal and quick response, came the answering notes from Fort Moultrie and Morris Island, followed by a national salute from every fort and rebel battery that had fired upon the flag four years before.  Finally the fleet, with the little monitors, joined in the deep harmonies of the grand chorus, till the earth trembled with the cannonade, the air grew heavy with smoke, and nothing was visible but the rapid flashes of the artillery. For a moment it seemed as if the assault of '61 was being re-enacted before me. But it is safe to add that had this been the case, I should hardly have chosen such an elevated position upon the observatory of the fort. At length the roar of cannon ceased, the dense clouds of smoke and sand drifted away, and order was restored. The orator of the day, Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, then began his address, of which the opening and closing sentences were as follows:       \"On this solemn and joyful day, we again lift to the breeze      our fathers' flag, now, again, the banner of _the United      States_, with the fervent prayer that God would crown it      with honor, protect it from treason, and send it down to our      children, with all the blessings of civilization, liberty      and religion. Terrible in battle, may it be beneficent in      peace. Happily, no bird or beast of prey has been inscribed      upon it. The stars that redeem the night from darkness, and      the beams of red light that beautify the morning, have been      united upon its folds. As long as the sun endures, or the      stars, may it wave over a nation neither enslaved nor      enslaving. [Great applause.]       \"Once, and but once, has treason dishonored it. In that      insane hour, when the guiltiest and bloodiest rebellion of      time hurled their fires upon this fort, you, sir, [turning      to General Anderson,] and a small, heroic band, stood within      these now crumbled walls, and did gallant and just battle      for the honor and defense of the nation's banner.      [Applause.]...       \"To-day you are returned again. We devoutly join with you in      thanksgiving to Almighty God, that he has spared your      honored life, and vouchsafed you the honors of this day. The      heavens over you are the same; the same shores; morning      comes, and evening, as they did. All else, how changed! What      grim batteries crowd the burdened shores! What scenes have      filled this air, and disturbed these waters! These shattered      heaps of shapeless stone are all that is left of Fort      Sumter. Desolation broods in yonder sad city--solemn      retribution hath avenged our dishonored banner! You have      come back with honor, who departed hence, four years ago,      leaving the air sultry with fanaticism. The surging crowds      that rolled up their frenzied shouts, as the flag came down,      are dead, or scattered, or silent; and their habitations are      desolate. Ruin sits in the cradle of treason. Rebellion has      perished. But there flies the same flag that was insulted.      [Great and prolonged applause.] With starry eyes it looks      all over this bay for that banner that supplanted it, and      sees it not. [Applause.] You that then, for the day, were      humbled, are here again, to triumph once and forever.      [Applause.] In the storm of that assault this glorious      ensign was often struck; but, memorable fact, not one of its      _stars_ was torn out by shot or shell. [Applause.] It was a      prophecy. It said, 'Not one State shall be struck from this      nation by treason!' The fulfillment is at hand. Lifted to      the air, to-day, it proclaims, after four years of war, 'Not      a State is blotted out!' [Applause.] Hail to the flag of our      fathers, and our flag! Glory to the banner that has gone      through four years black with tempests of war, to pilot the      nation back to peace without dismemberment! And glory be to      God, who, above all hosts and banners, hath ordained      victory, and shall ordain peace! [Applause.]       \"Our nation, under one government, without slavery, has been      ordained, and shall stand. There can be peace on no other      basis. Reverently, piously, in hopeful patriotism, we spread      this banner on the sky, as of old the bow was planted on the      cloud; and, with solemn fervor, beseech God to look upon it,      and make it the memorial of an everlasting covenant and      decree, that never again on this fair land shall a deluge of      blood prevail. [Applause.]...       \"From this pulpit of broken stone we speak forth our earnest      greeting to all our land.       \"We offer to the President of these United States our solemn      congratulations that God has sustained his life and health      under the unparalleled burdens and sufferings of four bloody      years, and permitted him to behold this auspicious      consummation of that national unity for which he has waited      with so much patience and fortitude, and for which he has      labored with such disinterested wisdom. [Applause.]       \"To the members of the government associated with him in the      administration of perilous affairs in critical times; to the      Senators and Representatives of the United States, who have      eagerly fashioned the instruments by which the popular will      might express and enforce itself, we tender our grateful      thanks. [Applause.]       \"To the officers and men of the Army and Navy, who have so      faithfully, skillfully, and gloriously upheld their      country's authority, by suffering, labor, and sublime      courage, we offer here a tribute beyond the compass of      words. [Great applause.]       \"Upon these true and faithful citizens, men and women, who      have borne up with unflinching hope in the darkest hour, and      covered the land with the labors of love and charity, we      invoke the divinest blessing of Him whom they have so truly      imitated. [Applause.]       \"But, chiefly, to Thee, God of our fathers, we render      thanksgiving and praise for that wondrous Providence that      has brought forth from such a harvest of war, the seed of so      much liberty and peace. We invoke peace upon the North.      Peace be to the West. Peace be upon the South.       \"In the name of God we lift up our banner, and dedicate it      to Peace, Union and Liberty, now and forever.\" [Great      applause.]  At the conclusion of the address, the audience arose and sang the doxology. An impressive prayer followed, with the benediction, by the Rev. Dr. Storrs, Jr. Six deafening cheers were then given for the old flag replaced on Sumter; and three times three for President Lincoln, General Robert Anderson, and our soldiers and sailors. Many of us remained to avail ourselves of the opportunity to shake hands with the old veteran, and I well remember the exultation with which I walked off with the General's autograph.  We spent an hour in exploring the walls and casements of the fort and rummaging about for relics. It was amusing to see a man who, after selecting a twenty-five pound shot for a memento, would carry it a short distance, change hands to make it easier, and then come to the conclusion that it was foolish to lug such a heavy thing around; or to see another person, who had been sweating under the burden of a heavy shell,--when suddenly told that it was still loaded and liable to go off, and take him off with it,--quickly turn and lay it down carefully, and quietly depart. I satisfied my curiosity with a few small grape and canister shot, some fragments of exploded shells, and a section of the rebel iron wire fence on the outer wall.  It must have been fully six o'clock when we all arrived safely back to the city. At sunset there was another grand salute from the fleet, and in the evening we were summoned on deck to witness the closing demonstration of the day. Nothing could be seen in the darkness, till quick, as if by magic, at the signal from the flag-ship of the Admiral, the entire harbor for miles around was brilliantly illuminated. Every vessel and transport and monitor was ablaze with many-colored fires. Each mast and sail and rope was aglow with light. From every"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23846"],["title","The Flag Replaced on Sumter (#5)"],["body"," came the roar and glare of rockets, darting in quick procession to the sky, then turning and descending in showers of golden rain. Hundreds of lanterns, red, green and white, suspended from the rigging, flashed out their starry signals over the bay, and were reflected in the waters beneath, while heavy clouds of smoke, tinged with golden radiance, rolled heavenward like ascending incense, presenting a scene of rare enchantment.  But hark! another signal gun is heard. Every light instantly disappears! Every sound is hushed! and grim darkness again mantles the waters of the bay; and, I was about to add, we were all soon in sleep's serene oblivion, but my diary records that at nine o'clock P.M. five of us took an impressed carriage and started for the Charleston Hotel, to attend a reception given by General Gilmore. On our arrival, we made a bargain with our negro driver to wait for us, say half an hour, more or less, and then take us over to the Battery, to General Hatch's grand military ball. But once inside, we became so much absorbed, like little Tommy Tucker, in the supper and the toasts, that we forgot all about our colored driver outside,--just as people do at parties still. The following are brief extracts from the remarks of two or three of the principal speakers.  Judge-Advocate Holt, in responding to the toast, \"General Robert Anderson,\" said:       \"It is not uncommon for organizations in treason or in      crime, on a vast scale, to commit mistakes in the selection      of agents to accomplish their work; and no man in all      history committed a greater mistake than Floyd, in the      selection of General Anderson, on the sole ground of his      being a southern man, to command Fort Sumter. He thought to      find in him a tool of treason, but he found instead a loyal,      fearless, and true man. Those who have led great treasonable      enterprises, or great crimes, have suffered most from      mingled rage and angry fear when they discovered such      mistakes in the selection of their agents, and none suffered      more in this respect than Secretary Floyd, on hearing of the      transfer of the small but devoted garrison from Fort      Moultrie to the solid walls of Fort Sumter. There was one      man, still in the service of the government, who was with      Floyd, in the Cabinet, at the time, and could bear evidence      to the rage of the defeated traitor, and that man, with      giant brain and steadfast heart, has for three years      presided at the head of the war Department--Edwin M.      Stanton.\"  Major-General Abner Doubleday was called out by some remarks referring to the part he took in the defense of Fort Sumter, and said:       \"I feel to-day as if I had been present at the birth of a      new nation. I was most happy to have been present at the      impressive ceremonies this day, and glad to remember that I      dealt some blows against secession in the same place four      years ago. I never doubted then the propriety of our      resistance. I felt that the only answer to armed treason      must come from the mouth of the cannon. There is one class      of men in that early effort to whom justice has not been      done. I mean the enlisted men. They were offered every      inducement to desert,--heavy bribes, and promotion in a new      service,--but they refused them all. [Cheers.] They were      told that there would be no necessity for any fighting; that      there would soon be peace, as the North could not stand up      against them; but all their efforts failed, and I give you,      'The remembrance of those noble soldiers.'\" [Great      cheering.]  But we were particularly interested in General Robert Anderson's response to a toast which had been assigned to General John A. Dix, who sent the famous order to Louisiana, in 1861, \"If any man attempts to haul down the American flag, shoot him on the spot!\"  General Anderson concluded by introducing the toast, \"Abraham Lincoln,\" with an eloquent tribute of respect and affection. Said he:       \"I beg you now, that you will join me in drinking the health      of another man whom we all love to honor,--the man who, when      elected President of the United States, was compelled to      reach the seat of government without an escort, but a man      who now could travel _all_ over our country with millions of      hands and hearts to sustain him. I give you the good, the      great, the honest man, Abraham Lincoln.\"  How little we dreamed, as the cheers, twice repeated, went around, that at that self-same hour the honored President lay prostrate and dying in the National Capital from the bullet of an assassin.       \"Thus grief ever treads upon the heels of pleasure\"--      \"And all alike await the inevitable hour;      The paths of glory lead but to the grave.\"  Having now remained at the hotel over an hour, we went out to look after our colored coachman, only to find, as we might have expected, that he had given us the slip. But we took possession of another carriage that fortunately came up, and, in answer to the sable inquiry, \"Am Colonel Fuller ready for de ball?\" we kindly informed our colored friend that if he would take us to the ball, the Colonel would undoubtedly be ready by the time he returned. Thus assured, he started off with us over a very dark and rough road, through the burnt district, till we stopped at length before a fine old mansion on East Bay street, brilliantly illuminated, from which sounds of music and festivity proceeded. Here, we were told, was the scene of another grand ball, given by the Confederates in honor of the fall of Sumter, just four years before. Some of the same negroes who served at the first ball, as _slaves_, now attended the second as _free and independent_ waiters. I purchased of one of them for a nominal sum quite a collection of Confederate currency, a Palmetto brass button, and a quaint Pompeiian lamp, which are still preserved as mementoes of the occasion. We were told \"dat Massa Middleton used to own de place,\" but, as the darkeys sing:       \"He saw a smoke way down de ribber,        Where de Lincum gunboats lay,      He took his hat, an' lef' berry sudden,        An' I 'specs he's run'd away!\"  So the fine estate, with its broad verandas, and elegant mirrors and paintings on the walls, all became, including the darkeys, \"contraband of war.\"  The next day was Saturday, and it was announced that the \"Oceanus\" would sail at five in the afternoon. The hour of departure was afterwards postponed to Sunday morning at nine o'clock, by advice of the pilot. We visited various points of interest on Saturday, including the office of the Charleston _Mercury_, where we secured some interesting papers, which are referred to in the Appendix. We also saw the slave-marts, where families had so long been bought and sold like cattle. I secured a bill of sale of a slave who was described as \"a negro fellow called Simon.\" The seller's name was Mordecai, and the buyer of \"the sole use of Simon forever,\" was a Mr. Lazarus.  [Illustration]  During the morning, one of our lady passengers was accosted by an aged black woman with a hen and a bag of eggs, as follows: \"Missus, I want to gib de northern ladies sumthin', but I have nuthin' but this yer hen, and these yer eggs. Won't you take 'em?\" This was too much for the sympathetic nature of Mrs. B----, but what to do with the hen and her products so far from home, was the question. Finally the eggs were taken and the hen left. The woman was rewarded and departed in much delight. On the homeward voyage a gentleman proposed to take them up to his country seat in New York State, and put them under the care of the most motherly hen of his large flock. This was done with the following result:       \"JUNE 10, 1865.       \"I am happy to inform you that the Charleston hen has done      her duty as well as could be expected under the      circumstances. The eggs were evidently the product of      secession times, and stoutly resisted all northern      influences. But the mother hen determined, '_a la_ General      Grant,' to set it out on this nest 'if it took all summer!'      A great destruction of capital has been the result, but      'victory at last' has rewarded her efforts, and she is now      followed by a train of four bipeds, one black, one white,      and two octoroons. I have neglected to tell you that the      mother hen is black, and struts with pompous pride above her      white and octoroon subjects. 'Let us have peace.'\"  My record would be incomplete without a brief description of the freedmen's meetings on Saturday. We found Citadel square almost impassable with the dense crowds of negroes, while hundreds of children were marching through the streets singing \"John Brown.\" The principal gathering was in Zion's Church, where more than three thousand colored people were crowded together. One of the speakers from the north, William Lloyd Garrison, the veteran abolitionist, was surrounded by the freedmen as he entered the church, and borne on their shoulders amid great enthusiasm to the platform. Then the surging multitude sang, with thrilling power and effect:       \"Roll, Jordan, roll, the year of Jubilee;\"  and another song, beginning:       \"Blow, blow your trumpet, Gabriel!\"  How they all shouted at the first mention of the name of Lincoln! \"Spread it abroad,\" said Hon. Henry Wilson, \"all over South Carolina, that the black men of South Carolina know no master now, and that they are slaves no more forever! [Great cheering.] Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States [tremendous cheering and waving of hats and handkerchiefs], with twenty-five millions of freemen by his side, and seven hundred thousand bayonets behind him, has decreed it, and it will stand while the world stands, that the black men of South Carolina can never more be slaves! [Loud cheers.] They have robbed your cradles; they have sold your children; they have separated"]]]
