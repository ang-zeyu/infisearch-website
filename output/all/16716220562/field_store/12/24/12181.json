You've got soot all over it. Come over here and I'll wash it off.\"  It was a curious thing about Tom Slade and a matter of much amusement to his friends, that however brave or noble or heroic his acts might be, he was pretty sure to get his necktie halfway around his neck and a dirty face into the bargain.     CHAPTER III  HE SCENTS DANGER AND RECEIVES A LETTER   Tom was greatly excited by his discovery. As he hurried to the office he opened the envelopes and what he found was not of a nature to modify his excitement. Here was German propaganda work with a vengeance. He felt that he had plunged into the very heart of the Teuton spy system. Evidently the recipient of these documents had considered them too precious to destroy and too dangerous to carry.  \"He might still think of a way to get them, maybe,\" thought Tom.  There was a paper containing a list of all the American cantonments and opposite each camp several names of individuals. Tom thought these might be spies in Uncle Sam's uniform. There was some correspondence about smuggling dental rubber out of the United States to make gas masks in Germany. There were requests for money. There was one letter giving information, in considerable detail, about aeroplane manufacture.  Another letter in the same handwriting interested Tom particularly, because of his interest in gas engines--the result of his many tussles with the obstreperous motor of the troop's cabin launch, _Good Turn_. Skimming hastily over some matter about the receipt of money through some intermediary, his interest was riveted by the following:       \"... I told you about having plans of high pressure motor. That's      for battle planes at high altitudes. I've got the drawings of the      other now--the low pressure one I told you about at S----'s. That's      for seaplanes, submarine spotting, and all that. Develops 400 H.P.      They're not putting those in the planes that are going over now,      but all planes going over next year will have them. B---- told me      what you said about me going across, but that's the only reason I      suggested it--because the information won't be of any particular      use to them after they bring down a plane. They'll see the whole      thing before their eyes then. But suit yourself. There's a lot of      new wrinkles on this motor. I'll tell you that, but there's no use      telling you about it when you don't know a gas engine from a      meat-chopper.       \"Sure, I could tend to the other matter too--it's the same idea as      a periscope. That's a cinch. I knew a chap worked on the      _Christopher Colon_. She used to run to Central America. Maybe I      could swing it that way. Anyway, I'll see you.       \"If you have to leave in a hurry, leave money and any directions at      S----'s.       \"I'm going to be laid off here, anyway, on account of my eardrums.       \"Hope B---- will give you this all right. Guess that's all now.\"  Tom read this twice and out of its scrappiness and incompleteness he gathered this much! that somebody who was about to be dismissed from an aeroplane factory for the very usual reason that he could not stand the terrific noise, had succeeded in either making or procuring plans of Uncle Sam's new aeroplane engine, the Liberty Motor.  He understood the letter to mean that it was very important that these drawings reach Germany before the motors were in service, since then it would be too late for the Germans to avail themselves of \"Yankee ingenuity,\" and also since they would in all probability succeed in capturing one of the planes.  He gathered further that the sender of the letter was prepared to go himself with these plans, working his way on an American ship, and to do something else (doubtless of a diabolical character) on the way. The phrase \"same idea as a periscope\" puzzled him. It appeared, also, that the sender of the letter, whoever he was and wherever he was (for no place or date or signature was indicated and the envelopes were not the original ones) had not sent his communications direct to this alien grocer, but to someone else who had delivered them to Schmitt.  \"It isn't anything for me to be mixed up in, anyway,\" Tom thought. He was almost afraid to carry papers of such sinister purport with him and he quickened his steps in order that he might turn them over to Mr. Burton, the manager of Temple Camp office.  But when he reached the office he did not carry out this intention, for there was waiting for him a letter which upset all his plans and made him forget for the time being these sinister papers. It took him back with a rush to his experiences on shipboard and he read it with a smile on his lips.       \"Dear Tommy--I don't know whether this letter will ever reach you,      for, for all I know, you're in Davy Jones's locker. Even my memo of      your address got pretty well soaked in the ocean and all I'm dead      sure of is that you live in North America somewhere near a bridge.\"  Tom turned the sheet to look at the signature but he knew already that the letter was from his erstwhile friend, Mr. Carleton Conne.       \"You'll remember that I promised to get you a job working for Uncle      Sam. That job is yours if you're alive to take it. It'll bring you      so near the war, if that's what you want, that you couldn't stick a      piece of tissue paper between.       \"If you get this all right and are still keen to work in transport      service, there won't be any difficulty on account of the experience      you've had.       \"Drop in to see me Saturday afternoon, room 509, Federal Building,      New York, if you're interested.       \"Best wishes to you.                                                     \"Carleton Conne.\"  So Mr. Conne was alive and had not forgotten him. Tom wished that the letter had told something about the detective's rescue and the fate of the spy, but he realized that Secret Service agents could hardly be expected to dwell on their adventures to \"ship's boy\" acquaintances, and was it not enough that Mr. Conne remembered him at all, and his wish to serve on an army transport?  He took the letter into the private office to show it to Mr. Burton, resolved now that he would say nothing about his discovery in Schmitt's cellar, for surely Mr. Conne would be the proper one to give the papers to.  \"You remember,\" he began, \"that I said if I ever heard from Mr. Conne and he offered me a job, I'd like to go. And you said it would be all right.\"  Mr. Burton nodded. \"And the expected--or the unexpected--has happened,\" he added, smiling, as he handed Mr. Conne's letter back to Tom.  \"It'll be all right, won't it?\" Tom asked.  \"I suppose it will have to be, Tom,\" Mr. Burton said pleasantly. \"That was our understanding, wasn't it?\"  \"Yes, sir--but I'm sorry--kind of.\"  \"I'm sorry, kind of, too; but I suppose there's no help for it. Some boys,\" he added, as he toyed with a paperweight, \"seem to be born to work in offices, and some to wander over the face of the earth. I would be the last to discourage you from entering war service in whatever form it might be. But I'm afraid you'd go anyway, Tom, war or no war. The world isn't big enough for some people. They're born that way. I'm afraid you're one of them. It's surprising how unimportant money is in traveling if one has the wanderlust. It'll be all right,\" he concluded with a pleasant but kind of rueful smile. He understood Tom Slade thoroughly.  \"That's another thing I was thinking about, too,\" said Tom. \"Pretty soon I'll be eighteen and then I want to enlist. If I enlist in this country I'll have to spend a whole lot of time in camp, and maybe in the end I wouldn't get sent to the firing line at all. There's lots of 'em won't even get across. If they find you've got good handwriting or maybe some little thing like that, they'll keep you here driving an army wagon or something. If I go on a transport I can give it up at either port. It's mostly going over that the fellers are kept busy anyway; coming back they don't need them. I found that out before. They'll give you a release there if you want to join the army. So if I keep going back and forth till my birthday, then maybe I could hike it through France and join Pershing's army. I'd rather be trained over there, 'cause then I'm nearer the front. You don't think that's sort of cheating the government, do you?\" he added.  Mr. Burton laughed. \"I don't think the government will object to that sort of cheating,\" he said.  \"I read about a feller that joined in France, so I know you can do it. You see, it cuts out a lot of red tape, and I'd kind of like hiking it alone--ever since I was a scout I've felt that way.\"  \"Once a scout, always a scout,\" smiled Mr. Burton, using a phrase of which he was very fond and which Tom had learned from him; \"and it wouldn't be Tom Slade if he didn't go about things in a way of his own, eh, Tom? Well, good luck to you.\"  Tom went out and in his exuberance he showed Mr. Conne's letter to Margaret Ellison, who also worked in Temple Camp office.  \"It's splendid,\" she said, \"and as soon as you _know_ you're going I'm going to hang a service flag in the window.\"  \"You can't hang out a service flag for a feller that's working on a transport,\" Tom said. \"He isn't in regular military service. When I'm enlisted I'll let you know.\"  \"You must be sure to write.\"  Tom promised and was delighted. So great was his elation, indeed, that on his way home to his room that evening he went through Terrace Avenue again, to see how the Red Cross women were getting on in their new quarters.  Mary Temple received him in a regular nurse's costume, which made Tom almost wish that he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23663"],["title","Tom Slade on a Transport (#3)"],["body"," lying wounded on some battle-field. She was delighted at his good news, and, \"Oh, we had such a funny man here just after you left,\" she said. \"Mother thinks he must have been insane. He said he came to read the gas-meter, so I took him down into the cellar and the gas-meter had been taken away. Wouldn't you think the gas company would have known that? Then he said he would stay in the cellar and inspect the pipes.\"  \"Did you let him?\" Tom asked.  \"I certainly did _not_! With all our stuff down there? When he saw I intended to stay down as long as he did, he went right up. Do you think he wanted to steal some of our membership buttons?\"  Tom shrugged his shoulders thoughtfully. He was glad the next day was Saturday.     CHAPTER IV  HE GETS A JOB AND MEETS \"FRENCHY\"   Tom found Mr. Conne poring over a scrapbook filled with cards containing finger-prints. His unlighted cigar was cocked up in the corner of his mouth like a flag-pole from a window, just the same as when Tom had seen him last. It almost seemed as if it must be the very same cigar. He greeted Tom cordially.  \"So they didn't manage to sink my old chum, Sherlock Nobody Holmes, eh? Tommy, my boy, how are you?\"  \"Did the spy get rescued?\" Tom asked, as the long hand-shake ended.  \"Nope. Went down. But we nabbed a couple of his accomplices through his papers.\"  \"I got a new mystery,\" said Tom in his customary blunt manner. \"I was going to give these papers to my boss, but when I got your letter I decided I'd give 'em to you.\"  He told the detective all about Adolf Schmitt and of how he had discovered the papers in the chimney.  \"You say the place had already been searched?\" Mr. Conne asked.  \"Yes, but I s'pose maybe they were in a hurry and had other things to think about, maybe. A man came there again just the other day, too, and said he wanted to read the gas-meter. But he looked all 'round the cellar.\"  \"Hmm,\" Mr. Conne said dryly. \"Tom, if you don't look out you'll make a detective one of these days. I see you've got the same old wide-awake pair of eyes as ever.\"  \"I learned about deducing when I was in the scouts,\" said Tom. \"They always made fun of me for it--the fellers did. Once I deduced an aeroplane landed in a big field because the grass was kind of dragged, but afterwards I found the fellers had made tracks there with an old baby carriage just to fool me. Sometimes one thing kind of tells you another, sort of.\"  \"Well, whenever you see something that you think tells you anything, Tommy, you just follow it up and never mind about folks laughing. I shouldn't wonder if you've made a haul here.\"  \"There was one of 'em that interested me specially,\" ventured Tom; \"the one about motors.\"  Mr. Conne glanced over the papers again. \"Hmm,\" said he, \"I dare say that's the least important of the lot--sort of crack-brained.\"  Tom felt squelched.  \"Well, anyway, they'll all be taken care of,\" Mr. Conne said conclusively, as he stuffed the papers in his pocket.  Tom could have wished that he might share in the further developments connected with those interesting papers. But, however important Mr. Conne considered them, he put the matter temporarily aside in the interest of Tom's proposed job.  \"I just happened to think of you,\" he said, as he took his hat and coat, \"when I was talking with the steward of the _Montauk_. He was saying they were short-handed. Come along, now, and we'll go and see about it.\"  Mr. Conne's mind seemed full of other things as he hurried along the street with Tom after him. On the ferryboat, as they crossed to Hoboken, he was more sociable.  \"Don't think any more about those letters now,\" he said. \"The proper authorities will look after them.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And whatever they set you to doing, put your mind on your work first of all. Keep your eyes and ears open--there's no law against that--but do your work. It's only in dime novels that youngsters like you are generals and captains and famous detectives.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Tom.  \"What I mean is, don't get any crazy notions in your head. You may land in the Secret Service yet. But meanwhile keep your feet on the earth--or the ship. Get me?\"  Tom was sensible enough to know that this was good advice.  \"Your finding these letters was clever. If there are any spies in the camps they'll be rounded up double quick. As for spy work at sea, I'll tell you this, though you mustn't mention it, there are government sleuths on all the ships--most of them working as hands.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Tom.  \"I'm going across on a fast ship to-morrow myself,\" continued Mr. Conne, greatly to Tom's surprise. \"I'll be in Liverpool and London and probably in France before you get there. There's a bare possibility of you seeing me over there.\"  \"I hope I do,\" said Tom.  The transport _Montauk_ was one of the many privately owned steamers taken over into government service, and Tom soon learned that outside the steward's department nearly all the positions on board were filled by naval men. Mr. Conne presented him to the steward, saying that Tom had made a trip on a munition carrier, and disappeared in a great hurry.  Tom could not help feeling that he was one of the least important things among Mr. Conne's multitudinous interests, and it must be confessed that he felt just a little chagrined at finding himself disposed of with so little ceremony.  But, if he had only known it, this good friend who stood so high in that most fascinating department of all Uncle Sam's departmental family, had borne him in mind more than he had encouraged Tom to think, and he had previously spoken words of praise to the steward, which now had their effect in Tom's allotment to his humble duties.  He was, in a word, given the best position to be had among the unskilled, non-naval force and became presently the envy of every youngster on board. This was the exalted post of captain's mess boy, a place of honor and preferment which gave him free entrance to that holy of holies, \"the bridge,\" where young naval officers marched back and forth, and where the captain dined in solitary state, save for Tom's own presence.  Now and then, in the course of that eventful trip, Tom looked enviously at the young wireless operators, and more particularly at the marine signalers, who moved their arms with such jerky and mechanical precision and sometimes, perhaps, he thought wistfully of certain fortunate young heroes of fiction who made bounding leaps to the top of the ladder of fame.  But he did his work cheerfully and well and became a favorite on board, for his duties gave him the freedom of all the decks. He was the captain's mess boy and could go anywhere.  Indeed, with one person he became a favorite even before the vessel started.  It was well on toward dusk of the third day and he was beginning to think they would never sail, when suddenly he heard a tramp, tramp, on the pier and up the gangplank, and before he realized it the soldiers swarmed over the deck, their tin plates and cups jangling at their sides. They must have come through the adjoining ferry house and across a low roof without touching the street at all, for they appeared as if by magic and no one seemed to know how they had got there.  Their arrival was accompanied by much banter and horseplay among themselves, interspersed with questions to the ship's people, few of which could be answered.  \"Hey, pal, where are we going?\"  \"Where do we go from here, kiddo?\"  \"Say, what's the next stop for this jitney?\"      \"We don't know where we're going,     but we're on our way,\"  someone piped up.  \"We're going to Berlin,\" one shouted.  The fact that no one gave them any information did not appear to discourage them.  \"When do we eat?\" one wanted to know.  Tom saw no reason why he should not answer that, so he said to those crowded nearest to him, \"In about half an hour.\"  \"G-o-o-d-ni-ight!\"  \"When are we going to start? Who's running this camp anyway?\"  \"Go and tell the engineer we're here and he can start off.\"  \"Fares, please. Ding ding!\"  \"Gimme me a transfer to Berlin.\"  And so it went. They sprawled about on the hatches, perched upon the rail, leaned in groups against the vent pipes; they covered the ship like a great brown blanket. They wrestled with each other, knocked each other about, shouted gibberish intended for French, talked about _Kaiser Bill_, and mixed things up generally.  At last they were ordered into line and marched slowly through the galley where their plates and cups were filled and a butcher was kept busy demolishing large portions of a cow. They sprawled about anywhere they pleased, eating.  To Tom it was like a scout picnic on a mammoth scale. Here and there was noticeable a glum, bewildered face, but for the most part the soldiers (drafted or otherwise) seemed bent on having the time of their lives. It could not be said that they were without patriotism, but their one thought now seemed to be to make merry. Tom's customary stolidness disappeared in the face of this great mirthful drive and he sat on the edge of the hatch, his white jacket conspicuous by contrast, and smiled broadly.  He wondered whether any other country in the world could produce such a slangy, jollying, devil-may-care host as these vociferous American soldiers. How he longed to be one of them!  A slim young soldier elbowed his way through the throng and, supper in hand, seated himself on the hatch beside Tom. He had the smallest possible mustache, with pointed ends, and his demeanor was gentlemanly and friendly. Even his way of stirring his coffee seemed different from the rough and tumble fashion of the others.  \"These are _stirring_ times, hey, Frenchy?\" a soldier said.  \"Yess--zat is verry good--_stirring times_,\" the young fellow answered, in appreciation of the joke. Then, turning to Tom, he said, \"Zis is ze Bartholdi statue, yess? I am from ze West.\"  \"That's the Statue of Liberty,\" said Tom. \"You'll see it better when we pass it.\"  \"Ah, yess! zis is ze first; I haf' nevaire"]]]
