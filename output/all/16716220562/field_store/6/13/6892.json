See where it shines in Jesus' face,     The brightest image of His grace!     God in the person of His Son     Has all His mightiest works outdone.  A rather finical question has occurred to some minds as to the theology of the word \"works\" in the last line, making the second person in the Godhead apparently a creature; and in a few hymn-books the previous line has been made to read--      God in the _Gospel_ of His Son.  But the question is a rhetorical one, and the poet's free expression--here as in hundreds of other cases--has never disturbed the general confidence in his orthodoxy.  Montgomery called Watts \"the inventor of hymns in our language,\" and the credit stands practically undisputed, for Watts made a hymn style that no human master taught him, and his model has been the ideal one for song worship ever since; and we can pardon the climax when Professor Charles M. Stuart speaks of him as \"writer, scholar, thinker and saint,\" for in addition to all the rest he was a very good man.   _THE TUNE._  Old \"Ames\" was for many years the choir favorite, and the words of the hymn printed with it in the note-book made the association familiar. It was, and _is_, an appropriate selection, though in later manuals George Kingsley's \"Ware\" is evidently thought to be better suited to the high-toned verse. Good old tunes never \"wear out,\" but they do go out of fashion.  The composer of \"Ames,\" Sigismund Neukomm, Chevalier, was born in Salzburg, Austria, July 10, 1778, and was a pupil of Haydn. Though not a great genius, his talents procured him access and even intimacy in the courts of Germany, France, Italy, Portugal and England, and for thirty years he composed church anthems and oratorios with prodigious industry. Neukomm's musical productions, numbering no less than one thousand, and popular in their day, are, however, mostly forgotten, excepting his oratorio of \"David\" and one or two hymn-tunes.  George Kingsley, author of \"Ware,\" was born in Northampton, Mass., July 7, 1811. Died in the Hospital, in the same city, March 14, 1884. He compiled eight books of music for young people and several manuals of church psalmody, and was for some time a music teacher in Boston, where he played the organ at the Hollis St. church. Subsequently he became professor of music in Girard College, Philadelphia, and music instructor in the public schools, being employed successively as organist (on Lord's Day) at Dr. Albert Barnes' and Arch St. churches, and finally in Brooklyn at Dr. Storrs' Church of the Pilgrims. Returned to Northampton, 1853.   \"EARLY, MY GOD, WITHOUT DELAY.\"  This and the five following hymns, all by Watts, are placed in immediate succession, for unity's sake--with a fuller notice of the greatest of hymn-writers at the end of the series.      Early, my God, without delay       I haste to seek Thy face,     My thirsty spirit faints away       Without Thy cheering grace.  In the memories of very old men and women, who sang the fugue music of Morgan's \"Montgomery,\" still lingers the second stanza and some of the \"spirit and understanding\" with which it used to be rendered in meeting on Sunday mornings.      So pilgrims on the scorching sand,       Beneath a burning sky,     Long for a cooling stream at hand       And they must drink or die.   _THE TUNE._  Many of the earlier pieces assigned to this hymn were either too noisy or too tame. The best and longest-serving is \"Lanesboro,\" which, with its expressive duet in the middle and its soaring final strain of harmony, never fails to carry the meaning of the words. It was composed by William Dixon, and arranged and adapted by Lowell Mason.  William Dixon, an English composer, was a music engraver and publisher, and author also of several glees and anthems. He was born 1750, and died about 1825.  Lowell Mason, born in Medfield, Mass., 1792, has been called, not without reason, \"the father of American choir singing.\" Returning from Savannah, Ga., where he spent sixteen years of his younger life as clerk in a bank, he located in Boston (1827), being already known there as the composer of \"The Missionary Hymn.\" He had not neglected his musical studies while living in the South, and it was in Savannah that he made the glorious harmony of that tune.  He became president of the Handel and Haydn Society, went abroad for special study, was made Doctor of Music, and collected a store of themes among the great models of song to bring home for his future work.  The Boston Academy of Music was founded by him and what he did for the song-service of the Church in America by his singing schools, and musical conventions, and published manuals, to form and organize the choral branch of divine worship, has no parallel, unless it is Noah Webster's service to the English language.  Dr. Mason died in Orange, N.J., in 1872.   \"SWEET IS THE WORK, MY GOD, MY KING.\"  This is one of the hymns that helped to give its author the title of \"The Seraphic Watts.\"      Sweet is the work, my God, my King     To praise Thy name, give thanks and sing     To show Thy love by morning light,     And talk of all Thy truth at night.   _THE TUNE._  No nobler one, and more akin in spirit to the hymn, can be found than \"Duke Street,\" Hatton's imperishable choral.  Little is known of the John Hatton who wrote \"Duke St.\" He was earlier by nearly a century than John Liphot Hatton of Liverpool (born in 1809), who wrote the opera of \"Pascal Bruno,\" the cantata of \"Robin Hood\" and the sacred drama of \"Hezekiah.\" The biographical index of the _Evangelical Hymnal_ says of John Hatton, the author of \"Duke St.\": \"John, of Warrington; afterwards of St. Helens, then resident in Duke St. in the township of Windle; composed several hymn-tunes; died in 1793.[5] His funeral sermon was preached at the Presbyterian Chapel, St. Helens, Dec. 13.\"  [Footnote 5: Tradition says he was killed by being thrown from a stage-coach.]   \"COME, WE THAT LOVE THE LORD.\"  Watts entitled this hymn \"Heavenly Joy on Earth.\" He could possibly, like Madame Guyon, have written such a hymn in a dungeon, but it is no less spiritual for its birth (as tradition will have it) amid the lovely scenery of Southampton where he could find in nature \"glory begun below.\"      Come, we that love the Lord,       And let our joys be known;     Join in a song with sweet accord,       And thus surround the throne.      There shall we see His face,       And never, never sin;     There, from the rivers of His grace,       Drink endless pleasures in.      Children of grace have found       Glory begun below:     Celestial fruits on earthly ground       From faith and hope may grow.  Mortality and immortality blend their charms in the next stanza. The unfailing beauty of the vision will be dwelt upon with delight so long as Christians sing on earth.      The hill of Sion yields       A thousand sacred sweets,     Before we reach the heavenly fields,       Or walk the golden streets.   _THE TUNE._  \"St. Thomas\" has often been the interpreter of the hymn, and still clings to the words in the memory of thousands.  The Italian tune of \"Ain\" has more music. It is a fugue piece (simplified in some tune-books), and the joyful traverse of its notes along the staff in four-four time, with the momentum of a good choir, is exhilarating in the extreme.  Corelli, the composer, was a master violinist, the greatest of his day, and wrote a great deal of violin music; and the thought of his glad instrument may have influenced his work when harmonizing the four voices of \"Ain.\"  Arcangelo Corelli was born at Fusignano, in 1653. He was a sensitive artist, and although faultless in Italian music, he was not sure of himself in playing French scores, and once while performing with Handel (who resented the slightest error), and once again with Scarlatti, leading an orchestra in Naples when the king was present, he made a mortifying mistake. He took the humiliation so much to heart that he brooded over it till he died, in Rome, Jan. 18, 1717.  For revival meetings the modern tune set to \"Come we that love the Lord,\" by Robert Lowry, should be mentioned. A shouting chorus is appended to it, but it has melody and plenty of stimulating motion.  The Rev. Robert Lowry was born in Philadelphia, March 12, 1826, and educated at Lewisburg, Pa. From his 28th year till his death, 1899, he was a faithful and successful minister of Christ, but is more widely known as a composer of sacred music.   \"BE THOU EXALTED, O MY GOD.\"  In this hymn the thought of Watts touches the eternal summits. Taken from the 57th and 108th Psalms--      Be Thou exalted, O my God,       Above the heavens where angels dwell;     Thy power on earth be known abroad       And land to land Thy wonders tell.         *       *       *       *       *      High o'er the earth His mercy reigns,       And reaches to the utmost sky;     His truth to endless years remains       When lower worlds dissolve and die.   _THE TUNE._  Haydn furnished it out of his chorus of morning stars, and it was christened \"Creation,\" after the name of his great oratorio. It is a march of trumpets.   \"BEFORE JEHOVAH'S AWFUL THRONE.\"  No one could mistake the style of Watts in this sublime ode. He begins with his foot on Sinai, but flies to Calvary with the angel preacher whom St. John saw in his Patmos vision:      Before Jehovah's awful throne       Ye nations bow with sacred joy;     Know that the Lord is God alone;       He can create and He destroy.      His sovereign power without our aid       Made us of clay and formed us men,     And when like wandering sheep we stray,       He brought us to His fold again.         *       *       *       *       *      We'll crowd Thy gates with thankful songs,       High as the heaven our voices raise,     And earth with her ten thousand tongues       Shall fill Thy courts with sounding praise.   _TUNE--OLD HUNDRED._  Martin"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18444"],["title","The Story of the Hymns and Tunes (#7)"],["body","adan's four-page anthem, \"Denmark,\" has some grand strains in it, but it is a tune of florid and difficult vocalization, and is now heard only in Old Folks' Concerts.         *       *       *       *       *  The Rev. Isaac Watts, D.D., was born at Southampton, Eng., in 1674. His father was a deacon of the Independent Church there, and though not an uncultured man himself, he is said to have had little patience with the incurable penchant of his boy for making rhymes and verses. We hear nothing of the lad's mother, but we can fancy her hand and spirit in the indulgence of his poetic tastes as well as in his religious training. The tradition handed down from Dr. Price, a colleague of Watts, relates that at the age of eighteen Isaac became so irritated at the crabbed and untuneful hymns sung at the Nonconformist meetings that he complained bitterly of them to his father. The deacon may have felt something as Dr. Wayland did when a rather \"fresh\" student criticised the Proverbs, and hinted that making such things could not be \"much of a job,\" and the Doctor remarked, \"Suppose _you_ make a few.\" Possibly there was the same gentle sarcasm in the reply of Deacon Watts to his son, \"Make some yourself, then.\"  Isaac was in just the mood to take his father at his word, and he retired and wrote the hymn--      Behold the glories of the Lamb.  There must have been a decent tune to carry it, for it pleased the worshippers greatly, when it was sung in meeting--and that was the beginning of Isaac Watts' career as a hymnist.  So far as scholarship was an advantage, the young writer must have been well equipped already, for as early as the entering of his fifth year he was learning Latin, and at nine learning Greek; at eleven, French; and at thirteen, Hebrew. From the day of his first success he continued to indite hymns for the home church, until by the end of his twenty-second year he had written one hundred and ten, and in the two following years a hundred and forty-four more, besides preparing himself for the ministry. No. 7 in the edition of the first one hundred and ten, was that royal jewel of all his lyric work--      When I survey the wondrous cross.  Isaac Watts was ordained pastor of an Independent Church in Mark Lane, London, 1702, but repeated illness finally broke up his ministry, and he retired, an invalid, to the beautiful home of Sir Thomas Abney at Theobaldo, invited, as he supposed, to spend a week, but it was really to spend the rest of his life--thirty-six years.  Numbers of his hymns are cited as having biographical or reminiscent color. The stanza in--      When I can read my title clear,  --which reads in the original copy,--      Should earth against my soul engage     And _hellish darts be hurled_,     Then I can smile at _Satan's rage_     And face a frowning world,  --is said to have been an allusion to Voltaire and his attack upon the church, while the calm beauty of the harbor within view of his home is supposed to have been in his eye when he composed the last stanza,--      There shall I bathe my weary soul       In seas of heavenly rest,     And not a wave of trouble roll       Across my peaceful breast.  According to the record,--      What shall the dying sinner do?  --was one of his \"pulpit hymns,\" and followed a sermon preached from Rom. 1:16. Another,--      And is this life prolonged to you?  --after a sermon from 1 Cor. 3:22; and another,--      How vast a treasure we possess,  --enforced his text, \"All things are yours.\" The hymn,--      Not all the blood of beasts     On Jewish altars slain,  --was, as some say, suggested to the writer by a visit to the abattoir in Smithfield Market. The same hymn years afterwards, discovered, we are told, in a printed paper wrapped around a shop bundle, converted a Jewess, and influenced her to a life of Christian faith and sacrifice.  A young man, hardened by austere and minatory sermons, was melted, says Dr. Belcher, by simply reading,--      Show pity Lord, O Lord, forgive,     Let a repenting sinner live.  --and became partaker of a rich religious experience.  The summer scenery of Southampton, with its distant view of the Isle of Wight, was believed to have inspired the hymnist sitting at a parlor window and gazing across the river Itchen, to write the stanza--      Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood       Stand drest in living green;     So to the Jews old Canaan stood       While Jordan rolled between.  The hymn, \"Unveil thy bosom, faithful tomb,\" was personal, addressed by Watts \"to Lucius on the death of Seneca.\"  A severe heart-trial was the occasion of another hymn. When a young man he proposed marriage to Miss Elizabeth Singer, a much-admired young lady, talented, beautiful, and good. She rejected him--kindly but finally. The disappointment was bitter, and in the first shadow of it he wrote,--      How vain are all things here below,     How false and yet how fair.  Miss Singer became the celebrated Mrs. Elizabeth Rowe, the spiritual and poetic beauty of whose _Meditations_ once made a devotional text-book for pious souls. Of Dr. Watts and his offer of his hand and heart, she always said, \"I loved the jewel, but I did not admire the casket.\" The poet suitor was undersized, in habitually delicate health--and not handsome.  But the good minister and scholar found noble employment to keep his mind from preying upon itself and shortening his days. During his long though afflicted leisure he versified the Psalms, wrote a treatise on _Logic_, an _Introduction to the Study of Astronomy and Geography_, and a work _On the Improvement of the Mind_; and died in 1748, at the age of seventy-four.   \"O FOR A THOUSAND TONGUES TO SING.\"  Charles Wesley, the author of this hymn, took up the harp of Watts when the older poet laid it down. He was born at Epworth, Eng., in 1708, the third son of Rev. Samuel Wesley, and died in London, March 29, 1788. The hymn is believed to have been written May 17, 1739, for the anniversary of his own conversion:      O for a thousand tongues to sing       My great Redeemer's praise,     The glories of my God and King,       And triumphs of His grace.  The remark of a fervent Christian friend, Peter Bohler, \"Had I a thousand tongues I would praise Christ Jesus with them all,\" struck an answering chord in Wesley's heart, and he embalmed the wish in his fluent verse. The third stanza (printed as second in some hymnals), has made language for pardoned souls for at least four generations:      Jesus! the name that calms our fears       And bids our sorrows cease;    'Tis music in the sinner's ears,      'Tis life and health and peace.  Charles Wesley was the poet of the soul, and knew every mood. In the words of Isaac Taylor, \"There is no main article of belief ... no moral sentiment peculiarly characteristic of the gospel that does not find itself ... pointedly and clearly conveyed in some stanza of Charles Wesley's poetry.\" And it does not dim the lustre of Watts, considering the marvellous brightness, versatility and felicity of his greatest successor, to say of the latter, with the _London Quarterly_, that he \"was, perhaps, the most gifted minstrel of the modern Church.\"  [Illustration: Charles Wesley]  Most of the hymns of this good man were hymns of experience--and this is why they are so dear to the Christian heart. The music of eternal life is in them. The happy glow of a single line in one of them--      Love Divine, all loves excelling,  --thrills through them all. He led a spotless life from youth to old age, and grew unceasingly in spiritual knowledge and sweetness. His piety and purity were the weapons that alike humbled his scoffing fellow scholars at Oxford, and conquered the wild colliers of Kingwood. With his brother John, through persecution and ridicule, he preached and sang that Divine Love to his countrymen and in the wilds of America, and on their return to England his quenchless melodies multiplied till they made an Evangelical literature around his name. His hymns--he wrote no less than six thousand--are a liturgy not only for the Methodist Church but for English-speaking Christendom.  The voices of Wesley and Watts cannot be hidden, whatever province of Christian life and service is traversed in themes of song, and in these chapters they will be heard again and again.  A Watts-and-Wesley Scholarship would grace any Theological Seminary, to encourage the study and discussion of the best lyrics of the two great Gospel bards.   _THE TUNES._  The musical mouth-piece of \"O for a thousand tongues,\" nearest to its own date, is old \"Azmon\" by Carl Glaser (1734-1829), appearing as No. 1 in the _New Methodist Hymnal_. Arranged by Lowell Mason, 1830, it is still comparatively familiar, and the flavor of devotion is in its tone and style.  Henry John Gauntlett, an English lawyer and composer, wrote a tune for it in 1872, noble in its uniform step and time, but scarcely uttering the hymnist's characteristic ardor.  The tune of \"Dedham,\" by William Gardiner, now venerable but surviving by true merit, is not unlike \"Azmon\" in movement and character. Though less closely associated with the hymn, as a companion melody it is not inappropriate. But whatever the range of vocalization or the dignity of swells and cadences, a slow pace of single semibreves or quarters is not suited to Wesley's hymns. They are flights.  Professor William Gardiner wrote many works on musical subjects early in the last century, and composed vocal harmonies, secular and sacred. He was born in Leicester, Eng., March 5, 1770, and died there Nov. 16, 1853.  There is an old-fashioned unction and vigor in the style of \"Peterborough\" by Rev. Ralph Harrison (1748-1810) that after all best satisfies the singer who enters heart and soul into the spirit of the hymn. _Old Peterborough_ was composed in 1786.   \"LORD WITH GLOWING HEART I'D PRAISE THEE.\"  This was written in 1817 by the author of the \"Star Spangled Banner,\" and is a noble American hymn "]]]
