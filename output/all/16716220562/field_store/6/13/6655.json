With heart bounding with joy and elation, Hervey followed the bed of the stream. The tracks, or whatever they were, were so clear that he could keep to the side of the muddy area and still see them.  It was characteristic of him that having made this great discovery, he did not trouble himself about the direction he was taking. In point of fact he was going in a southwesterly direction toward the camp.  For perhaps a quarter of a mile the strange markings were clearly legible in the dusk, running as they did in the yielding caked surface of the stream bed. They were as clear as tracks in caked snow. Then the path of the dried up waterway petered out in an area of rocks and pebbles and beyond that there was no clearly defined way; the brook had evidently trickled down into the lower land taking the path of least resistance among the rocks.  No doubt Tom Slade could have followed that water path to its end, but Hervey was puzzled, baffled. Yet the enthusiasm which carried him, as though on wings, to his triumphs was aroused now. He had the prophecy of Tom Slade to strengthen his determination. He must make good for Tom's sake now, as well as for the sake of his troop. He had told Tom that if he only once found a trail, nothing would stop him--_nothing_. Very fine. All that talk about there being something higher than the Eagle award was nonsense, and Tom Slade knew it was nonsense. \"He said I'd do it, and I'm going to,\" Hervey muttered to himself.  Hervey had no patience with obstacles, he must be always moving, so now he began frantically scrutinizing the ground to see if he could find some sign of the marks which had eluded him. Since he could no longer distinguish the stream bed, he looked for some sign of those marks outside the stream bed.  And presently he was rewarded by the discovery of tracks, animal tracks sure enough, without any ribbon, so to speak, printed between them. There they were upon the hard, bare earth, two lines of claw marks, continuing to a point where they disappeared again at the edge of a close cropped field. Evidently his mysterious predecessor had known just where he wished to go and had forsaken the stream bed when it no longer went in his direction. These were no aimless tracks, they were the tracks of a creature that had particular business in the southwest, and that knew how to get there.     CHAPTER XIII  THE STRANGE TRACKS   Hervey had not the slightest idea in which direction he was going, but in point of fact he was heading straight in the direction of Temple Camp. But he had found his precious tracks and nothing would stop him now. He would go over the top in a blaze of glory next day, and then perhaps a telegram could be sent to scout headquarters to have the Eagle badge sent up immediately so that he could receive the very award itself on Saturday night. He was on the home stretch now, as luck would have it, and nothing would stop him--nothing....  _Nothing!_ He would send a line to his mother that very night and tell her all about it, and put E. S. after his name. _Eagle Scout._ The bicycle his father had promised him when he should attain that pinnacle of scout glory, he would now demand. That would be where dad lost out....  If Tom Slade knew some secret about a higher award, that meant more stunts, Hervey would do those stunts, too; the more the merrier. He should worry....  Yes, he was on the trail at last, and at the end of that trail was the stalking badge--and the Eagle award. _Hervey Willetts, Eagle Scout._ It sounded pretty good....  He realized now that this discovery of his was just a streak of luck, that the chances would have been altogether against his finding real tracks in these two remaining days. \"I'm lucky,\" he said. Which must have been true, else he would have lost his life long ere that....  Darkness was now coming on apace, and it must be long past supper-time. But this was no time to be thinking of eating. Nothing would stop him now, _nothing_. When he set his mind on a thing....  The tracks changed again in traversing the fields. They were not tracks at all, in fact, but a narrow belt of trampled grass, which was not visible close by. It was only by looking ahead that Hervey could distinguish it. Half way across the field he lost it altogether, but, remembering the fact that it could be seen better at a distance, he climbed a tree and there lay the long narrow belt of trampled grass running under the rail fence at the field's edge and into the sparse woods beyond. He had not to follow it, only pick out the rail of the fence near where it passed and hurry to that spot.  And there it was, waiting for him. If Hervey had been well versed in tracking lore and less of a seeker after glory, he would have scrutinized the lowest rail of the fence, under which the track went, for bits of hair. But Hervey Willetts was not after bits of hair. It was quite like him that he did not care two straws about what sort of animal he was tracking. He was tracking the Eagle badge.  In the sparse woods the tracks appeared as regular tracks again, sharply cut in the hard earth. Where the ground was bare under the trees, the tracks were as clear as writing on a slate, but in the intervening spaces the vegetation obscured them and he found them with difficulty. This tracking in the woods was the hardest part of his task because it required patience and deliberation, and Hervey had neither.  But he managed it and was beginning to wonder how far his tracking had led him and whether he was near to covering the required distance. When he felt certain of that, he would drive a stake in the ground, fly his navy blue scarf from it to prove his claim, and go back to camp in triumph. He had made up his mind that he would at once report his feat in Council Shack, and offer to escort any or all of the trustees back over the ground in verification of his crowning accomplishment. The only Eagle Scout at Temple Camp, except Tom Slade; and Tom Slade didn't count....  Still, as he looked back, the base of the mountain seemed almost as near as when he had made his discovery, the fields and wood which had seemed so long to the tracker were but small to the casual glance and he realized that his whole journey was yet far short of a quarter mile.  The tracks now ran, as clear as writing, across one of those curious patches of damp ground with a thin, slippery skin, which was torn straight across in a kind of furrow. Hervey was so intent on studying this that he did not notice in the shadow about a hundred feet ahead of him a log directly in line with the tracks. When suddenly he looked up, he paused and stared ahead of him in consternation.  Some one was sitting on the log.     CHAPTER XIV  HERVEY'S TRIUMPH   As soon as Hervey's dismay subsided he approached the log, and as he did so the figure appeared familiar to him. There was something especially familiar in the scout hat which came down over the ears of the little fellow who was underneath it, and in the hair which straggled out under the brim. The belt, drawn absurdly tight around the thin little waist, was a quite sufficient mark of identification. It was Skinny McCord, the latest find, and official mascot of the Bridgeboro troop, one of the crack troop of the camp. Alfred was his Christian name.  The queer little fellow's usually pale face looked ghastly white in the late dusk, and the strange brightness of his eyes, and his spindle legs and diminutive body, crowned by the hat at least two sizes too large, made him seem a very elf of the woods. At camp or elsewhere, Skinny was always alone, but he seemed more lonely than ever in that still wood, with the night coming on. Nature was so big and Skinny was so little.  \"Hello, Skinny, old top!\" Hervey said cheerily. \"What do you think you're doing here? Lost, strayed, or stolen?\"  Skinny's eyes were bright with a strange light; he seemed not to hear his questioner. But Hervey, knowing the little fellow's queerness, was not surprised.  \"You look kind of frightened. Are you lost?\" Hervey inquired.  For just a moment Skinny stared at him with a look so intense that Hervey was startled. The little fellow's fingers which clutched a branch of the log, trembled visibly. He seemed like one possessed.  \"Don't get rattled, Skinny,\" Hervey said; \"I'll take you back to camp. We'll find the way, all right-o.\"  \"I'm a second-class scout,\" Skinny said.  \"Bully for you, Skinny.\"  \"I--I just did it. I'm going to do more so as to be sure. Will you stay with me so you can tell them? Because maybe they won't believe me.\"  \"They'll believe you, Skinny, or I'll break their heads, one after another. What did you do, Alf, old boy?\"  \"Maybe they'll say I'm lying.\"  \"Not while I'm around,\" Hervey said. \"What's on your mind, Skinny?\"  \"I ain't through yet,\" Skinny said. \"I know your name and I like you. I like you because you can dive fancy.\"  \"Yes, and what are you doing here, Alf?\" Hervey asked, sitting down beside the little fellow.  \"I'm a second-class scout,\" Skinny said; \"I found the tracks and I tracked them. See them? There they are. Those are tracks.\"  \"Yes, I see them.\"  \"I tracked them all the way up from camp and I've got to go further up yet, so as to be sure. You got to be _sure_--or you don't get the badge. So now I won't be a tenderfoot any more. Are you a second-class scout?\"  \"First-class, Skinny.\"  \"I bet you don't care about tracks--do you?\"  Hervey put his arm over the little fellow's shoulder and as he did so he felt the little body trembling with nervous excitement.  \"Not so much, Skinny. No, I don't care about tracks. I--eh--I like diving better. How far up are you going to follow the tracks?\"  \"I'm going to follow them away, way, way up so as I'll be _sure_. They might say it wasn't a half a mile, hey?\"  The hand which rested on the little thin shoulder, patted it reassuringly.  \"Well, I'll be there to tell them different, won't I, Skinny, old boy?\"  \"Will "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18180"],["title","Tom Slade on Mystery Trail (#7)"],["body","go with me all the way up to where the mountain begins--will you?\"  \"Surest thing you know.\"  \"And will you prove it for me?\"  \"That's me.\"  \"Then I won't be a tenderfoot any more. I'll be a second-class scout.\"  \"Is that what you have to do to be a second-class scout, Skinny? I forget about the second-class tests. You have to track an animal, or something like that? I've got a rotten memory.\"  \"And I'll--I'll have a trail named after me, too; it'll be called McCord trail. These are _my_ tracks, see? Because I found them. Only maybe they'll say I'm lying. Anyway, how did _you_ happen to come here?\" he asked as if in sudden fear.  \"I was just taking a walk through the woods, Skinny.\"  Skinny continued to stare at him, still with a kind of lingering misgiving, but feeling that gentle patting on his shoulder, he seemed reassured.  \"I was just flopping around in the woods, Skinny; just flopping around, that's all....\"     CHAPTER XV  SKINNY'S TRIUMPH   And that was the triumph of Hervey Willetts, who would let nothing stand in his way. \"_Nothing!_\"  A hundred yards or so more and the stalking badge would have been won, and with it the Eagle award. The bicycle that he had longed for would have been his. The troop which in its confidence had commissioned him to win this high honor would have gone wild with joy. Hervey Willetts would have been the only Eagle Scout at Temple Camp save Tom Slade, and, of course, Tom didn't count.  Yet, strangely enough, the only eagle that Hervey Willetts thought of now was the eagle which he had driven off--the bird of prey. To have killed little Skinny's hope and dispelled his almost insane joy would have made Hervey Willetts feel just like that eagle which had aroused his wrath and reckless courage. \"Not for mine,\" he muttered to himself. \"Slady was right when he said he wasn't so stuck on eagles. He's a queer kind of a duck, Slady is; a kind of a mind reader. You never know just what he means or what he's thinking about. I can't make that fellow out at all.... I wonder what he meant when he said that a trail sometimes doesn't come out where you think it's going to come out....\"  Hervey had greatly admired Tom Slade, but he stood in awe of him now. \"Well, anyway,\" said he to himself, \"he said I'd win the award and I didn't; so I put one over on him.\" To put one over on Tom Slade was of itself something of a triumph. \"He's not _always_ right, anyway,\" Hervey reflected.  He was aroused from his reflections by little Skinny. \"I followed them from camp,\" he said. \"They're _real_ tracks, ain't they? And they're _mine_, ain't they? Because I found them? Ain't they?\"  \"Bet your life. I tell you what you do, Alf, old boy. You just follow them up a little way further toward the mountain and I'll wait for you here. Then we can say you did it all by yourself, see? The handbook says a quarter of a mile or a half a mile, I don't know what, but you might as well give them good measure. I can't remember what's in the handbook half of the time.\"  \"You know about good turns, don't you?\"  \"'Fraid not, except when somebody reminds me.\"  \"I'm going to keep you for my friend even if I _am_ a second-class scout, I am,\" Skinny assured him.  \"That's right, don't forget your old friends when you get up in the world.\"  \"Maybe you'll get that canoe some day, hey?\"  \"What canoe is that, Alf?\"  \"The one for the highest honor; it's on exhibition in Council Shack. All the fellows go in to look at it. A big fellow let me go in with him, 'cause I'm scared to go in there alone.\"  \"I haven't been inside Council Shack in three weeks,\" Hervey said. \"I don't know what it looks like inside that shanty. I'm not strong on exhibitions. I'll take a squint at it when we go down.\"  \"The highest honor, that's the Eagle award, isn't it?\" Skinny asked.  \"I suppose so,\" Hervey said; \"a fellow can't get any higher than the top unless he has an airplane.\"  \"Can he get higher than the top if he has a balloon?\" Skinny wanted to know.  \"Never you mind about balloons. What we're after now is the second-class scout badge, and we're going to get it if we have to kill a couple of councilmen.\"  \"Did you ever kill a councilman?\"  \"No, but I will, if Alf McCord, second-class scout, doesn't get his badge. I feel just in the humor. Go on now, chase yourself up the line a ways and then come back. I'll be waiting at the garden gate.\"  \"What gate?\"  \"I mean here on this log.\"  \"Do you know Tom Slade?\"  \"You bet.\"  \"He likes me, he does; because I used to steal things out of grocery stores just like he did--once.\"  \"All right,\" Hervey laughed. \"Go ahead now, it's getting late--Asbestos.\"  \"That isn't my name.\"  \"Well, you remind me of a friend of mine named Asbestos, and I remind myself of an eagle. Now don't ask any more questions, but beat it.\"  And so the scout who had never bothered his head about the more serious side of scouting sat on the log watching the little fellow as he followed those precious tracks a little further so that there might be no shadow of doubt about his fulfilling the requirement. Then Hervey shouted to him to come back, and shook hands with him and was the first to congratulate him on attaining to the dignity of second-class scout. Not a word did Hervey say about the amusing fact of little Skinny having followed the tracks backward; backward or forward, it made no difference; he had followed them, that was the main thing.  \"They're _my_ tracks; all mine,\" Skinny said.  \"You bet,\" said Hervey; \"you can roll them up and put them in your pocket if you want to.\"  Skinny gazed at his companion as if he didn't just see how he could do that.  And so they started down for camp together, verging away from the tracks of glory, so as to make a short cut.  \"I bet you're smart, ain't you?\" Skinny asked. \"I bet you're the best scout in this camp. I bet you know everything in the handbook, don't you?\"  \"I wouldn't know the handbook if I met it in the street,\" Hervey said.  Skinny seemed a bit puzzled. \"I had a bicycle that a big fellow gave me,\" he said, \"but it broke. Did you ever have a bicycle?\"  \"Well, I had one but I lost it before I got it,\" Hervey said. \"So I don't miss it much,\" he added.  \"You sound as if you were kind of crazy,\" Skinny said.  \"I'm crazy about you,\" Hervey laughed; and he gave Skinny a shove.  \"Anyway, I like you a lot. And they'll surely let me be a second-class scout now, won't they?\"  \"I'd like to see them stop you.\"     CHAPTER XVI  IN DUTCH   That Hervey Willetts was a kind of odd number at camp was evidenced by his unfamiliarity with the things that were very familiar to most boys there. He was too restless to hang around the pavilion or sprawl under the trees or idle about with the others in and near Council Shack. He never read the bulletin board posted outside, and the inside was a place of so little interest to him that he had not even seen the beautiful canoe that was exhibited there, and on which so many longing eyes had feasted.  Now as he and Skinny entered that sanctum of the powers that were, he saw it for the first time. It was a beautiful canoe with a gold stripe around it and gunwales of solid mahogany. It lay on two sawhorses. Within it, arranged in tempting style, lay two shiny paddles, a caned back rest, and a handsome leather cushion. Upon it was a little typewritten sign which read:      This canoe to be given to the first scout this season to win the     Eagle award.  \"That's rubbing it in,\" said Hervey to himself. \"That's two things, a bicycle and a canoe I've lost before I got them.\"  He sat down at the table in the public part of the office while Skinny, all excitement, stood by and watched him eagerly. He pulled a sheet of the camp stationery toward him and wrote upon it in his free, sprawling, reckless hand.      TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:      This will prove that Alfred McCord of Bridgeboro troop tracked some     kind of an animal for more than a half a mile, because I saw him     doing it and I saw the tracks and I came back with him and I know     all about it and it was one good stunt I'll tell the world. So if     that's all he's got to do to be a second-class scout, he's got the     badge already, and if anybody wants to know anything about it they     can ask me.                                                        HERVEY WILLETTS,                                                        Troop Cabin 13.  After scrawling this conclusive affidavit and placing it under a weight on the desk of Mr. Wade, resident trustee, Hervey sauntered over to the cabins occupied by the two patrols of his troop, the Leopards and the Panthers. They were just getting ready to go to supper.  \"Anything doing, Hervey?\" his scoutmaster, Mr. Warren, asked him.  \"Nothing doing,\" Hervey answered laconically.  \"Maybe he doesn't know what you're talking about,\" one of his patrol, the Panthers, suggested. This was intended as a sarcastic reference to Hervey's way of losing interest in his undertakings before they were completed.  \"Have you got a trail--any tracks?\" another asked.  Hervey began rummaging through his pockets and said, \"I haven't got one with me.\"  \"You didn't happen to see that canoe in Council Shack, did you?\" Mr. Warren asked him.  \"Yes, it's very nice,\" Hervey said.  Mr. Warren paused a moment, irresolute.  \"Hervey,\" he finally said, \"the boys think it's too bad that you should fall down just at the last minute. After all you've accomplished, it seems like--what shall I say--like Columbus turning back just before land was sighted.\"  \"He didn't turn back,\" Hervey said; \"now there's one thing I didn't forget--my little old history book. When Columbus started to cross the Delaware----\"  \"Listen, Hervey,\" Mr. Warren interrupted him; \"suppose you and I walk together, I want to talk with you.\"  So they strolled together in the direction of the mess boards.  \"Now, Hervey, my boy,\" said Mr. Warren, \"I don't want you to be angry at what I say, but the boys are disgruntled and I think you can'"]]]
