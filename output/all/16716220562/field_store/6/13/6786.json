Within a fortnight the British army and the whole British navy were mobilized for war.  During that time the Y M C A was represented in four-fifths of the camps of the territorial forces and 250 centers were opened.  In six months 500 centers were occupied; at the end of the first year there were 1,000, and after two years of the war 1,500 such centers were in full swing.  The area of operations includes the British Isles, Egypt, the Dardanelles, Malta, the Mediterranean ports, India, Mesopotamia, East and South Africa, Canada, Australia, and out to the last limits of Britain's far flung battle line.  The Y M C A has a strong homing instinct, aiming to provide \"a home away from home.\"  In the dugouts behind the trenches, in the deserts of Egypt, or in the jungles of Africa, it has been forced to make a home in every kind of shelter.  It was significant that its first three successive dwelling places seventy years ago were a little bedroom, a coffee house, and a room in a tavern.  During the present war, one may see Associations in actual operation along the fighting line in France, in a cowshed, a pigsty, a stable, a hop-house, dugouts under the earth; in battered and ruined buildings in Flanders; in tents in the Sahara and on the ancient Peninsula of Mt. Sinai; at the bases of the big battle fleets; in the rest houses of the flying corps; on the Bourse in Cairo; in hotels taken over in Switzerland and France, and in the great Crystal Palace of London.  In four centers it has used and transformed a brewery, a saloon, a theater, and a museum.  Its dwellings stretch away from the tents of \"Caesar's Camp,\" where the Roman Julius lauded in 55 B. C., on the southern shores of Britain, to the far north, in the new naval institute at Invergordon, erected for the sailors of the Grand Fleet at a cost of more than $20,000.  They range from the battered dugouts at the front in France to the Shakespeare hut in London, costing more than $30,000.  They stretch from the rest huts of the great metropolis, with sleeping and feeding accommodations for some ten thousand men a day during the dangerous period of leave in London, away to the hut in \"Plug Street\" Woods, recently blown to atoms by a shell, where the secretary escaped by a few seconds and returned to find literally nothing left save the rims of his spectacles and two coins melted and fused together by the terrific heat of the explosion. Several of the secretaries and workers have been killed by shell fire, or in transit by torpedoes from submarines, while other Association men have received the Victoria Cross for heroism in action.  Let us visit a typical hut to grasp the significance of its work, in order that we may realize what is going on in the fifteen hundred similar centers.  We are on the great Salisbury Plain, in the midst of thirty miles square of weltering mud during the long winter months.  To realize what a hut means to the men in such a place, we must understand the unnatural situation created by the conditions of war.  Here are multitudes of men far from home, shut out from the society of all good women, taken away from their church and its surroundings, weary and wet with marching and drilling, often lonely and dejected, in an atmosphere of profanity and obscenity in the cheerless barrack rooms, and tempted by the animal passions which are always loosed in war-time.  The men need all the help we can give them now, and need it desperately.  Now can you measure just what a big warm hut means to these men as a home, far away from home?  The red triangle at the entrance gleams across the whole camp and stands for the three things the soldier most needs.  It stands, in the first place, as a pledge for supplying the _physical need_ of these hungry, lonely, and fiercely tempted men.  A dry shelter, a warm fire, a cheerfully lighted room, the bursts of song, and the hum of conversation make the men forget the wind and rain and mud outside.  Supper and a hot cup of coffee satisfy their hunger.  On the notice-board is the announcement of the outdoor sports, football tournaments, and the games, where the thirty thousand men of the division will compete in open contest on the coming Saturday, under the direction of the Y M C A.  Whatever the soldier needs for his physical life, whether it is to eat or to sleep, a bed in London, a cool drink in the thirsty desert, or hot coffee in the trenches, it is furnished for him by the Association.  The hut also provides for the soldier's _intellectual_ and social needs.  The piano and the phonograph, the billiard tables, draughts and chess boards, tables for games, library, and reading room keep him busy; and the concerts, stimulating lectures, moving pictures, educational classes, and debating societies provide him with recreational and mental employment.  The far deeper _moral and spiritual needs_ of the soldier are also met. As the evening draws to a close, one sees the secretary in his military uniform stand up on the table; hats are off and heads are bowed at the call for evening prayers, which are held here every night.  On Sunday the parade services of the different denominations take place in turn in the Association hut.  Weekly voluntary religious meetings are also held.  At one end of the building is the \"quiet room,\" where groups of Christian soldiers can meet for Bible classes or for prayer.  At regular intervals evangelistic meetings are held.  On our last night at this hut, on a Sunday evening, twelve hundred men gathered to listen to the Christian message.  Of the three bars of the triangle, it is this which stands at the top, which unites the other two and which is the dominating factor of the whole.  And yet nowhere is religion forced down the throats of the men. Rather it is the aim to make it the unconscious atmosphere of the whole hut.  It is a striking fact, to which every soldier will testify, that while the language of the barrack room and beer canteen is often reeking with the profane and the obscene, the whole tone of the Association hut is entirely different.  As one soldier says: \"You don't realize the enormous difference of atmosphere between this and any other place where soldiers congregate.  A man simply does not talk bad language and filth here; he learns to control himself.\"  Thus the threefold work of the Association stands for the whole man and for the whole manhood of the nation.  In many ways the Y M C A hut seeks to meet the soldier's every need.  1. It is his _club_, where he meets his comrades and in the freedom and friendship of the place forgets the irksome drill, the endless restraints, and the stern discipline of military life.  2. As we have already seen, it is his _home_, the place where he writes his letters and keeps in touch with his family and distant friends. Nearly twenty million pieces of stationery are sent out free for the soldiers each month from the London central office, and the sign of the red triangle on the letter head brings weekly joy and cheer to the broken circle in the distant home.  It is here that the lad is helped to \"keep the home fires burning\" in his heart and to hold true to those high ideals.  One little girl when visiting the Crystal Palace, upon seeing the sign of the red triangle, said: \"My daddy always makes that mark on his letters when he writes to us at home.\"  3. It is his _church_, for out on the desert, or in the jungle, or at the front, there is usually no other church building for religious services.  The following is taken from a typical Sunday program in one of the huts: \"6:30 a. m., Roman Catholic Mass; 7:30 Nonconformist service; 9:00 Anglican service; 2-3 p. m., Bible class; 6:4:5-8 United Song Service.\"  Thus each denomination is allowed to have its own service in its own way on Sunday morning, while the evening meeting is interdenominational and open to all.  In one place where the young Hebrews were being sadly neglected and were falling away from their former moral standards, the secretary arranged with the Jewish rabbi to have a weekly service in the Y M C A tent for his men.  It has been held ever since.  The Jews of the neighboring city were so grateful that they started a campaign to raise a fund of $10,000 for Y M C A huts.  The Rev. Michael Adler, the head Jewish rabbi with the forces in France, has time and again expressed his cordial appreciation of the help rendered to the men of his faith. The doors of the Association will always remain open for men of all creeds.  As wide as the needs of men, as broad as democracy, as unified as humanity, and as tolerant as its Lord and Master, the movement will ever aim to be.  4. The Association hut is the soldier's _school_.  Here his classes are held.  A program taken at random from a single hut will show the scope of a week's work: \"Bible classes; religious services; lecture on The Town Where We Are; lecture on South America; lantern lecture on Russia; debating society; impromptu speeches; history class.\"  5. The Association hut is also his place of _rest_, and the shop where he buys his supplies.  Here he can procure almost anything he needs that is decent, and read anything that is wholesome.  Usually this hut is the only clean place of recreation in the camp, and without it he is left to choose between the cheerless tent and the beer canteen.  6. The Y M C A is the center of his _recreation_, and his entertainment bureau.  Under the leadership of Miss Lena Ashwell and scores of others, concerts and entertainment parties have been organized and have toured continuously in France, Great Britain, Egypt, and the more distant camps.  The six artists of each party are received with tremendous enthusiasm and become the fast friends of Tommy Atkins.  One writes: \"Last time the party came here the press of men waiting on the verandah to go into the second"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18328"],["title","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs (#0)"],["body","STORY OF SIGURD THE VOLSUNG AND THE FALL OF THE NIBLUNGS  BY WILLIAM MORRIS  EIGHTH IMPRESSION  LONGMANS, GREEN, AND CO. 39 PATERNOSTER ROW, LONDON NEW YORK AND BOMBAY 1904  _All rights reserved_     CONTENTS.

BOOK I.  SIGMUND.       IN THIS BOOK IS TOLD OF THE EARLIER DAYS OF THE VOLSUNGS, AND OF      SIGMUND THE FATHER OF SIGURD, AND OF HIS DEEDS, AND OF HOW HE DIED      WHILE SIGURD WAS YET UNBORN IN HIS MOTHER'S WOMB.       _Of the dwelling of King Volsung, and the wedding of Signy his     daughter._      There was a dwelling of Kings ere the world was waxen old;     Dukes were the door-wards there, and the roofs were thatched with gold;     Earls were the wrights that wrought it, and silver nailed its doors;     Earls' wives were the weaving-women, queens' daughters strewed its       floors,     And the masters of its song-craft were the mightiest men that cast     The sails of the storm of battle adown the bickering blast.     There dwelt men merry-hearted, and in hope exceeding great     Met the good days and the evil as they went the way of fate:     There the Gods were unforgotten, yea whiles they walked with men.     Though e'en in that world's beginning rose a murmur now and again     Of the midward time and the fading and the last of the latter days,     And the entering in of the terror, and the death of the People's       Praise.      Thus was the dwelling of Volsung, the King of the Midworld's Mark,     As a rose in the winter season, a candle in the dark;     And as in all other matters 'twas all earthly houses' crown,     And the least of its wall-hung shields was a battle-world's renown,     So therein withal was a marvel and a glorious thing to see,     For amidst of its midmost hall-floor sprang up a mighty tree,     That reared its blessings roofward, and wreathed the roof-tree dear     With the glory of the summer and the garland of the year.     I know not how they called it ere Volsung changed his life,     But his dawning of fair promise, and his noontide of the strife,     His eve of the battle-reaping and the garnering of his fame,     Have bred us many a story and named us many a name;     And when men tell of Volsung, they call that war-duke's tree,     That crownèd stem, the Branstock; and so was it told unto me.      So there was the throne of Volsung beneath its blossoming bower.     But high o'er the roof-crest red it rose 'twixt tower and tower,     And therein were the wild hawks dwelling, abiding the dole of       their lord;     And they wailed high over the wine, and laughed to the waking sword.      Still were its boughs but for them, when lo on an even of May     Comes a man from Siggeir the King with a word for his mouth to say:     \"All hail to thee King Volsung, from the King of the Goths I come:     He hath heard of thy sword victorious and thine abundant home;     He hath heard of thy sons in the battle, the fillers of Odin's Hall;     And a word hath the west-wind blown him, (full fruitful be its fall!)     A word of thy daughter Signy the crown of womanhood:     Now he deems thy friendship goodly, and thine help in the battle good,     And for these will he give his friendship and his battle-aid again:     But if thou wouldst grant his asking, and make his heart full fain,     Then shalt thou give him a matter, saith he, without a price,     --Signy the fairer than fair, Signy the wiser than wise.\"      Such words in the hall of the Volsungs spake the Earl of Siggeir       the Goth,     Bearing the gifts and the gold, the ring, and the tokens of troth.     But the King's heart laughed within him and the King's sons deemed       it good;     For they dreamed how they fared with the Goths o'er ocean and acre       and wood,     Till all the north was theirs, and the utmost southern lands.      But nought said the snow-white Signy as she sat with folded hands     And gazed at the Goth-king's Earl till his heart grew heavy and cold,     As one that half remembers a tale that the elders have told,     A story of weird and of woe: then spake King Volsung and said:      \"A great king woos thee, daughter; wilt thou lie in a great king's bed,     And bear earth's kings on thy bosom, that our name may never die?\"      A fire lit up her face, and her voice was e'en as a cry:     \"I will sleep in a great king's bed, I will bear the lords of the       earth,     And the wrack and the grief of my youth-days shall be held for       nothing worth.\"      Then would he question her kindly, as one who loved her sore,     But she put forth her hand and smiled, and her face was flushed no more     \"Would God it might otherwise be! but wert thou to will it not,     Yet should I will it and wed him, and rue my life and my lot.\"      Lowly and soft she said it; but spake out louder now:     \"Be of good cheer, King Volsung! for such a man art thou,     That what thou dost well-counselled, goodly and fair it is,     And what thou dost unwitting, the Gods have bidden thee this:     So work all things together for the fame of thee and thine.     And now meseems at my wedding shall be a hallowed sign,     That shall give thine heart a joyance, whatever shall follow after.\"     She spake, and the feast sped on, and the speech and the song and       the laughter     Went over the words of boding as the tide of the norland main     Sweeps over the hidden skerry, the home of the shipman's bane.      So wendeth his way on the morrow that Earl of the Gothland King,     Bearing the gifts and the gold, and King Volsung's tokening,     And a word in his mouth moreover, a word of blessing and hail,     And a bidding to King Siggeir to come ere the June-tide fail     And wed him to white-hand Signy and bear away his bride,     While sleepeth the field of the fishes amidst the summer-tide.      So on Mid-Summer Even ere the undark night began     Siggeir the King of the Goth-folk went up from the bath of the swan     Unto the Volsung dwelling with many an Earl about;     There through the glimmering thicket the linkèd mail rang"]]]
