Recently a new so-called \"mustard gas\" has been used by the enemy with deadly effect, owing to the fact that it is both invisible and odorless.  It is sent over in exploding shells, and sinks in a heavy invisible vapor about the sleeping men, creeping into their dugouts and trenches or enveloping them around the guns or in the shell holes.  The effects do not manifest themselves for several hours.  With stinging pain the man's eyes begin to close, and for a time he may go almost blind.  He is then taken violently sick.  The surface of the lungs and the entire body, especially where it is moist with perspiration, is burned.  The skin may blister and come off.  Many cases have proved fatal and many more suffer cruelly for weeks in hospital.  With the men we attended a lecture on the nature of the various gases used by the enemy and the proper methods of meeting them.  The lecture throughout was unconsciously couched almost in theological language.  The instructor first disposed of what he called superstitious \"heresies\" concerning the gas, in order to prevent the men from having panic and \"getting the wind up.\"  There is a foolish rumor which says, \"One breath and you are ruptured for life, or you fall dead the next morning,\" etc., etc., but he warns the men of its deadly nature and tells them they are to be saved from its fatal effects by knowing the truth.  The instructor explains that if they take four deep breaths it will prove fatal: \"One breath and you catch the first spasm, two and you are mad, three and you are unconscious, four and you are dead.  If you keep your presence of mind and hold your breath you will have six seconds to get on your gas helmet or respirator.\"  The attack, remember, is a surprise in the dark; brain-splitting gas shells are dropping on all sides, and it is hard to keep cool and hold one's breath in the moment of sudden surprise and panic.  We are told that there are fifteen mistakes which are easily possible in getting on this complicated helmet, or if there is one big blunder in the sudden surprise the man is done for.  Before going through the death chamber, helmets are inspected, to see that they are sound and unpunctured, and the men are drilled in the open to practice putting them on quickly.  Suddenly the warning whistle of an imaginary gas attack sounds.  One backward fling of the head and the steel helmet falls off, for there is no time to lift it off.  A dive into the bag carried on the chest and the respirator is grasped and with one skilful swoop it is drawn over the face.  Your nose is pinched shut by a clamp, your teeth grip the rubber mouthpiece, and, like a diver, you must now get your one safe stream of pure air through the respirator.  You draw in the air from a tube which rises from a tin of chemical on your chest.  Then you can breathe in the dense, deadly, greenish chlorine vapor, for as it passes through the respirator filled with chemicals, it is absorbed, neutralized, oxidized, and purified into a stream of pure air.  All about you may be choking fumes of death which would kill you in four seconds, yet you will be completely immune, breathing a purified atmosphere.  The soldiers are now marched up to this chamber of horrors to walk through the poison gas.  Many have \"the wind up\" (i. e., they are afraid inside, but are ashamed to show it).  Reliance on the guide, the expert who has been through it all, and the sense of companionship, the stronger ones unconsciously strengthening the weak, have a steadying effect upon all the men.  The soldiers have had four hours' drill to prepare them, but the \"padre\" and I, who are now permitted to go through, have had but four minutes.  I am trying to remember a number of things all at once.  Above all I must keep cool and assure myself that there is no danger if only I trust and obey what the expert has said.  I fling on the helmet and we start into the death chamber, but suddenly a string is loose--will the respirator work?  There seems to be something the matter with my nosepiece which should be clamped shut. I would like to ask the instructor just one question to make sure, but I can no more talk than a diver beneath the sea.  It is too late, we are moving, I can only hope and trust the helmet will hold.  We have left the sunlight and are in a long dark covered chamber, like a trench, groping forward, and looking at a distant point of light through the dim goggles.  We are alone in these deadly fumes, the instructor is not here, there is a tense silence, and all about us is the poison of death.  Oh, what was that fourth point that I was to remember?  Why has the guide turned back?  I thought we were to go out at the further end, where last week the poor fellow fell who lifted his helmet a moment too soon after he got out and caught one whiff which sent him to the hospital, but instead we seem to be turning around and going back.  But there is no time for explanations or questions now; we just plod on through the darkness and soon we are out in the sunlight again--safe!--in God's pure air.  Oh, why did man ever want to pollute it and poison his brother with these deadly fumes of hell!  As a special favor, the instructor allows us, without a mask, to take one swift look into the fumes as we hold our breath.  That yellow green chlorine will corrode the lungs and fill them with pus and blood.  The phosgene is much more deadly and will strike the man down with sudden failure of the heart.  We were also sent through a chamber of the invisible \"tear gas,\" without a mask.  The object of this is to take away the fear of the gas from the men.  This particular gas has no effect upon the lungs, but sends a stinging pain through the eyes, so that one weeps blindly for some minutes and could not possibly see to shoot or to defend himself.  We are now ready to return to another lecture with more understanding. No wonder these tired boys under the heavy, hot steel helmets, which absorb the heat of the scorching sun, are listening with all their ears, yet one or two fall asleep for very weariness and may again be caught napping by the enemy's poison gas up the line.  The instructor is in dead earnest, for the life of every man during the coming conflict may depend upon his message.  His words are still in my ears, for they were strangely like a sermon:  \"Men, I am going to tell you the truth about this deadly gas and you must believe it, for your life will depend upon it.  It can kill and no doubt about it.  But for every poison of the enemy there's an antidote and we have found it.  Your helmet is perfect and you simply must believe in it, you must trust to it.  We have made full provision for your safety.  If you go under it will be your own fault from one of four causes--unbelief, disobedience, carelessness, or fear.  If you carelessly go without your helmet it means death.  During an attack, after putting on the respirator, just stand and wait.  There is nothing you can do for yourself except to keep your helmet on.  Your skill, your strength are nothing.  Now if you are caught in an attack unawares remember if you're still alive at all, there's hope.  Don't lose courage.  If your confidence goes, you lose ninety per cent of your defense, for the sole hope of the enemy in gas is surprise and panic. If you are gassed, don't move.  Keep still, keep warm, don't worry, and wait.  To move or try to save yourself will be fatal.  \"The enemy will put over three or four waves with a break between.  The gas may come for some hours.  To remove your helmet before the attack is over will be fatal.  Within a quarter of an hour after the gas has ceased, the charge of the enemy will come and you must never let him get past your barbed wired entanglements.  After exposure to gas, all food, water, and wells are poisonous.  The heavy gas must be expelled from the trenches by fans before the charge comes.  Only remember, you must believe what I say, keep your helmet on in time of danger and you are perfectly safe.\"  There is a vast difference between the warning and the preparatory exposure to the gas by your guide and the deadly surprise of the enemy. The former is a trial to prepare you, the latter is an effort to destroy you.  The whole experience was so obviously parallel to the deadly moral dangers which surround the soldier in war time that it needs no comment.  The one and only safety in the time of temptation is to put on the whole armor of God, especially the \"helmet of salvation,\" then to trust and obey and stand fast.  The writer has just come from a ward in the hospital filled with patients suffering from the new gas which the enemy has lately put over.  It is, as we have said, invisible and odorless, so the men receive no warning, and consequently do not put on their masks.  They do not know that they are being gassed until hours afterwards, when they find they are burned from head to foot.  Here are twenty men lying in this tent, suffering from this new torture.  This first boy, with a wan smile that goes right to your heart, can only whisper from his burnt-out lungs and cannot tell us his story.  The next man was taken with vomiting five hours after the gas shells exploded.  Seven of his fourteen companions sleeping in the dugout were killed outright, the others were gassed.  He does not know where they are.  He lay unconscious for several days, and now his eyes and skin are burned as though he had passed through a fire.  The next boy is badly burned in his eyes and chest.  Half the men of his battery were killed by gas while asleep at night.  On the next cot is a boy who has been suffering for seventeen days; the burns on his body have been improving, his lungs also are better, but he is still blind and fears he may lose his sight.  He asks me to write a letter for him to his mother.  \"Only,\" he says, \"don't tell her about my eyes.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18325"],["title","With Our Soldiers in France (#7)"],["body","we make up a cheerful letter, and the boy rests back on his cot to pray for his returning eyesight.  The next two beds are empty.  Both the men died in the night, falling an easy prey to pneumonia in their weakened condition. The next boy is from the infantry.  Out of his squad nine were killed by the explosion of the shell, eight wounded, and the rest badly burned.  The neck, chest, arms, and legs of this boy are burned and blistered.  The deadly gas fumes have burned right through his clothing.  Such is the effect of this new and latest triumph of modern science, which will shatter the hopes and happiness of thousands of homes.  After passing through the gas chambers, we visited the bombing section of the training school.  Here each man has to throw one or more live bombs and receive his final coaching.  The bomb is about the size of a lemon, and is made to break into small fragments.  It contains enough of the high explosive to kill a whole group of men.  The boy advances and grasps the bomb; he draws out the pin and holds down the lever. Once this is released, it explodes in just five seconds.  The man heaves his bomb over a parapet at a dummy dressed in German uniform. The whistle blows and we all duck.  There is a terrific explosion like a small cannon and you hear the pieces whizzing through the air.  Every man is holding in his hand and wielding a terrible power.  Wrongly used, it is death to himself and his comrades.  The other day a boy's hand was moist with perspiration and the bomb slipped, killing the group.  Another prematurely exploded as it was being thrown, carrying away the man's own hand and killing the instructor.  So it is a dangerous business.  During the morning there were only four \"duds,\" or bombs that would not go off.  After the bombing section, we pass with the men to the trenches. Bayonets are drawn and rifles loaded.  After firing several rounds, comes the command, \"Advance.\"  At a bound they are \"over the top\" and off, heads down; they run very slowly and keep together.  A breathless man who outruns his comrades is useless and is soon killed by the enemy.  The drill sergeant shouts to the men \"Keep together, keep together, men, one man can't take a trench,\" and my friend the \"padre\" notes his words to tell to his congregation when he goes home, where the minister can't do all the work.  When they are near the enemy's trench, the final word \"Charge\" is shouted, the whole line leaps forward with a wild yell, and the bayonets are driven into the stuffed sacks which are suspended as dummies to serve in the place of men.  For miles across the great plain the \"Bull Ring\" is alive with men. Here in one section they are doing physical drill and learning to go over all kinds of obstacles--trenches, fences, barbed wire, shell holes, and ditches.  There they are practicing musketry and advancing under cover.  In one place the artillery is in full swing, and in another you hear the sputter of the machine guns.  In one section they are taught to dig trenches and in another to take them.  Before a great advance where a system of trenches is to be taken, a \"rehearsal\" often takes place.  From a height of thousands of feet above the lines the aircraft with powerful telescopic cameras photograph every foot of the battlefield covered by the enemy's lines. These photographs are developed and studied and diagrams drawn from them of the enemy's system of trenches.  These diagrams are reproduced far behind the front in elaborately prepared earthwork and trenches which are an exact replica of the enemy's lines.  The divisions which are to take part in the attack are sent back to rehearse their exact duties at just the point corresponding to that which they will have to take.  Each officer knows every nook and crevice, each bay and angle of the trenches he will have to capture.  When all is ready the men are placed in their exact positions and they execute in reality what they have rehearsed in theory behind the lines.  The lesson of preparedness and organization is studied and mastered with infinite care.     CHAPTER IV  WITH THE BRITISH ARMY  I  In sheltered America we cannot realize what war means, but when we entered the warring countries of Europe, in an instant we were in a different atmosphere.  We landed in England upon a darkened coast, we entered a darkened train, where every blind was drawn lest it furnish a guide to London for invading Zeppelins or aeroplanes.  We passed through gloomy towns and villages, where not a single light was showing from a window, where every street lamp and railway station was darkened or hidden.  Automobiles with a dim spark of light groped through the black streets of the metropolis.  In London we saw a great Zeppelin brought down in flames.  It was a sight never to be forgotten.  At half-past two in the morning we were awakened by the roar of the anti-aircraft guns in and around the city. After traveling all night from Germany, one Zeppelin had arrived over London and a whole fleet of them was scattered over the coasts and counties of England.  We sprang to the window and found the sky swept by a score of searchlights with their great shafts of piercing light, shooting from the dark depths of the city high into the sky, where they all converged on a single bright object that hung nine thousand feet above us.  Long, and shining like silver with its flashing aluminum, the Zeppelin seemed held as if blinded by the fierce light.  Bombs were dropping from it and explosions followed in rapid succession in the city beneath.  It was a battle to the death, high in the air with all London looking on.  The guns were in full play and the shell and shrapnel were bursting all about the Zeppelin.  Sometimes you could trace the whole trajectory of a projectile, as a spark of light swept through the sky toward the Zeppelin and then burst to the right or left, above or below it.  Most of the shots seemed to go wide of the mark.  More than a score of aeroplanes had been sent up to attack it, with one plane to guide the rest and signal to the guns below by wireless or lights.  The battle finally developed into a duel to the death between the machine guns of the Zeppelin and Lieutenant Robinson of the Flying Corps, who was up for two hours in his aeroplane after the enemy--one man fighting for a city of five millions.  He attacked from below and bombs were thrown at his plane; then he attacked from the side as he circled about the monster, but he was driven off by their machine guns.  At last, mounting high in the sky, he attacked from above.  The guide-plane flashed down the signal for the guns to cease firing and give him a chance.  For a few moments all was silent; the battle seemed to be over.  The great airship, which had swung sharply to the left, was triumphantly leaving for home.  Then it was that Robinson dropped his incendiary bomb.  Suddenly there was an explosion.  A flame of burning gas leaped into the sky.  London was lit up for ten miles round-about.  Our room was instantly as bright as though a searchlight had flashed into the window.  Far above us was the Zeppelin in flames.  Now it began to sink--first it was in a blaze of white light, then its outline turned to a dull red, finally it crumpled to a glowing cinder, sank from sight, and fell crashing to the earth.  Then all was dark again.  Death had fallen suddenly upon the men in the Zeppelin and upon some in the sleeping city below.  As we drove through London we passed the draper's shop, near St. Paul's Cathedral, where George Williams and a group of twelve young men met in a little upper room on June 6, 1844, to organize the first Young Men's Christian  Association.  A dozen young men with little wealth, influence, or education might not seem a very formidable force, but twelve men have upset the world and changed the course of history before now.  They had only thirteen shillings, or $3.25, in the treasury, and were too poor even to print and send out a circular announcing their little organization.  But George Williams brought his fist down on the table, with the confident words, \"If this movement is of God, the money will come.\"  It has come.  The twelve men have been multiplied now to a million and a half, scattered in forty lands.  Girded with new strength and with the dauntless optimism of youth, the movement has risen up to minister not only to the millions of British and American soldiers and munition workers, but also to the men in the camps, hospitals, or prisons in most of the nations now at war.  The thirteen shillings have been multiplied until now the permanent Y M C A buildings are worth over a hundred million dollars.  An average of two new huts or centers have been erected and opened by the British or American Associations every day since war was declared; while two permanent buildings in brick or stone rise each week in some part of the world.  Wars are the birth-pangs of new eras.  A new day dawned for the Young Men's Christian Association with the present war.  At midnight on August 4, 1914, the British Association as it had been for seventy years was buried and forgotten, and a new movement arose on the ruins of the old.  Ninety per cent of its former workers left to join the colors, but a new army of over thirty thousand men and women was mustered and trained within its huts for the service of the British soldiers.  The Y M C A had suddenly to \"think imperially,\" and to minister to a world at war.  Seventy years ago George Williams was the man of the hour, but a leader of the British war work of the Y M C A was found in the present crisis in the person of Mr. A. K. Yapp, General Secretary of the National Council of Great Britain, who has recently been knighted by virtue of his distinguished service for the nation.  He had spent Sunday, August second, in deep searching of heart and had caught a vision of what the war would mean, and the opportunity that would be presented to an"]]]
