No nation ever recorded the progress that Germany made after the inauguration of her bank act and her scientific tariffs.  The government permitted no waste of labor, no disorganization of industry.  Capital and labor could each combine, but there must be no prolonged strikes, no waste, no loss; they must work harmoniously together and for the upbuilding of the empire.  Germany did not want war except as means to an end.  She wanted the fruits of her industry.  She wanted her people, her trade, and her commerce to expand over the surface of the earth, but to be still German and to bring home the fruit of German industry.  Germany has been at war--commercial war--with the whole world now for a generation, and in this warfare she has triumphed.  Her enterprise, her industry, and her merchants have spread themselves over the surface of the earth to a degree little realized until her diplomacy again slipped and the present war followed--such a war as was planned for by nobody and not expected even by herself.  She was giving long credits and dominating the trade of South America.  She had given free trade England a fright by the stamp, \"Made in Germany.\"  She was pushing forward through Poland into Russia to the extent that her merchants dominated Warsaw and were spreading out even over the Siberian railroad.  Her finance was intertwined with that of London and Paris.  In the United States she was the greatest loser.  Here taxes were lowest and freedom greatest.  German blood flowed in the veins of 20,000,000 Americans and not one fourth of them could she call her own. The biggest newspaper publisher in America, William Randolph Hearst, figured that New York was one of the big German cities of the world. He turned his giant presses to capture the German sentiment.  He spent tens of thousands of dollars upon German cable news, devoting at times a whole page to cable presentations from Europe which he thought would interest Germans.  But the investment proved fruitless; he found there was in America no German sentiment such as he had reckoned upon.  He could not increase his circulation, for the German-Americans seemed little concerned as to what happened in Berlin or Bavaria.  Prussia learned what Hearst learned, that Germans were soon lost in the United States.  She studied this exodus and the wage question and by various arts and organizations arrested the German emigration to America.  She saw to it that employment at home was more stable.  It was figured that if the German emigration could be centralized under the German eagle it would be to her advantage.  The question was where to get land that could be made German.  Europe has for some years expected a German dash in Patagonia, and the Europeans outside of Germany have taken very kindly of late years to the Monroe Doctrine. In Africa and the islands of the sea the German colonial policy has not been a success.  Dr. Dernburg as colonial secretary has many a time stood up in the Reichstag and warned the Germans that the home military system and rules were not adaptable to colonization in foreign parts; that Germans must adapt themselves to foreign countries and not attempt at first to make their manners the standard in the colonies they undertook to dominate.  While German colonies have not yet passed beyond the experimental stage, German tariffs and German commerce have been great successes.  The population of Russia is 166,000,000 people.  This is the latest figure I gathered from those intimate with the government at St. Petersburg.  This is just 100,000,000 more than Germany.  Germany thinks she must trade to her own advantage with the people now crowding her eastern border.  The example of America in putting up tariff bars against \"Made in Germany\" has many advocates in England and in the rest of the world.  When France, only a few years ago, was angered that Italy should sign up in \"triple alliance\" with Austria and Germany, she did not dare to attack Italy with arms, but she did attack Italy by tariff measures, and for a time Italy and France fought--by tariffs.  What might be the position of Germany if the American protective tariff system were expanded over the earth?  In the view of some people tariffs, taxation, and armaments go hand in hand.  There is a town in Prussia that finished payment only twenty years ago on the indemnity Napoleon exacted from it.  Can a country afford to develop an industrial system dependent upon an outside world and then suddenly find the outside world closed by tariff barriers?  When an American ambassador protested against Bismarck's discriminatory treatment of American pork, the great chancellor asked, \"What have you to talk with?  You have no army or navy.\"  \"No,\" said the American ambassador, \"but we have the ability to build them as big as anybody. Do you wish to tempt us?\"  \"No,\" said the German chancellor, \"and your goods shall not be discriminated against.\"  Dr. Dernburg has given the key to the German colonial military, tariff, and financial policy.  German unity in tariffs and transportation has made German prosperity, and Dr. Dernburg, her former colonial secretary and now in New York, says the mouth of the Rhine and the channel ports must be free to Germany and that Belgium must come into tariff and transportation union with Germany.  Belgium is being taxed, tariffed, pounded, and impounded into the German empire.  There is some difference in size between Belgium and Russia, but no difference in principle with respect to their German relations.  \"World power or downfall,\" Bernhardi put it.     CHAPTER III  THE POLITICAL CAUSES OF THE WAR  A State with no Morals--A Peace Treaty sundered--Where Germany fails--A Thunderbolt.   Sending his little expedition to China the Kaiser said:--  \"When you encounter the enemy you will defeat him; no quarter shall be given, no prisoners shall be taken.  Let all who fall into your hands be at your mercy.  Just as the Huns one thousand years ago, under the leadership of Attila, gained a reputation in virtue of which they still live in historical tradition, so may the name of Germany become known in such a manner in China that no Chinaman will ever again dare to look askance at a German.\"  Belgium was made an example of.  According to the German idea she should have accepted money and not stood in the way of German progress.  German military progress is allied with German commercial progress.  It is a mistake in the conception of Germany to imagine that she wars for the purpose of war or for the development and training of her men.  The first principle of German \"Kultur\" as respects the state is that the sole business of the government is to advance the interests of the state.  No laws having been formulated in respect to the business of a state, the government is without moral responsibility, and the laws applicable to individual action do not apply to the state.  Individuals may do wrong, but the state cannot do wrong.  Individuals may steal and be punished therefor, but the state cannot steal.  It is its business to expand and to appropriate.  Individuals may murder and be punished for the crime, but it is the business of the state to kill for state development or progress.  The English-speaking conception of morality is that what applies to an individual in a community applies to the aggregate of the individuals, that the state is only the aggregate of the individuals exercising the natural human functions of government for law and order.  This is entirely outside the German conception.  In the German conception a government comes down from above and not up from the people.  It is not the people who rule or govern, but the government from above rules the people, and the people must implicitly follow and obey; thus is national progress and human progress.  The whole of Germany believes in the government of the Kaiser: that law and war flow down through him and that neither can be questioned by the individual. Obedience, union, efficiency, progress, and progress through war, if necessary, are cardinal virtues.  Germany does not desire war with Russia, but German progress requires the continuance of present tariff relations, and if war is a means to that desirable end, war is divine.  The murder of the Crown Prince of Austria was an incident furnishing Germany and Austria opportunity to carry out their long-conceived programme for the extension of their influence through the growing state of Servia.  A treaty had been arranged between Greece and Turkey, and was to have been signed in July, which would have settled many things in respect to Turkey and the Balkan states.  Roumania and Servia were in agreement concerning this great measure for peace in southeastern Europe.  When all was ready for the final conference and the signatures, Austria intervened and announced her opposition.  Then suddenly followed the bombshell of the ultimatum to Servia, timed at the precise moment to stop the signing of this Turkish treaty.  Austrian officials admitted privately as follows, and I have it directly from parties to the negotiations:--  \"We are satisfied that Servia would punish the murderers of Prince Ferdinand if we so requested.  We are satisfied she would apologize to Austria if we requested it.  But our aims go beyond.  We demand that instead of the proposed Turkish treaty the Balkan states shall come into union with Turkey under the influence of Austria.  To accomplish this we must accept no apology, but must punish Servia.  We are satisfied that Russia is in no financial or military position to interfere.\"  Germany with its enormous spy system had secured copies of the confidential state papers of the Czar and transmitted them to Vienna. In these were warnings, statistics, and compilations showing all the financial and military weaknesses of Russia: that her great gold reserve had been largely loaned out and was not available cash on hand, as the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18125"],["title","The Audacious War (#4)"],["body","had been led to believe; that it would take eighteen months more of preparation to place her military forces in position to defend the country; that her arms and the factories to build them were not ready.  The plans of Austria and Germany were to line up the Balkan states, under German political and trade influences, and then within two years to have it out with Russia and again impose the German tariffs upon her.  If France dared to come in, it would certainly be an attack, and Italy would, under the Triple Alliance, assist to defend Austria and Germany.  Defeating Russia, Germany could, at that time or later, crush France in the manner in which Bismarck had said she might eventually be crushed by Germany for Germany's progress.  Then, having made more onerous tariff treaties with France than were exacted from her in 1870 and having extended German trade and military influence over Russia, Germany would be in a position with her navy to try out the long desired issue with Great Britain for the control of the seas.  Admiral Von Tirpitz told the emperor that it must be at least two years more before the German navy would be able to try conclusions with England.  The German plan was to take the European countries one at a time.  The German information was that every country except Germany was unprepared, and that information was true.  She was fully prepared except in her navy.  One of the leaders among those great business Lords of England, who sit with the Commoners in business, but in the House of Lords as respects legislation, said to me when I spoke of the wonderful intelligence of Germany in research and data, scientific and political: \"But, don't you think that the Germans had too much information and too little judgment?\"  In other words, they had a stomach full of facts but no capacity to digest them.  They knew as much about Ulster and perhaps more than London as respects facts and detailed information, but they were in no position to pass judgment upon Ulster or the unity of the British Empire the moment there was an attack from the outside.  The Germans have dealt in materialistic facts.  But with the spirit that moulds and makes history they are all awry.  With the Germans, individuals are units and are counted from the outside, never from the inside.  That is why her diplomacy is not only a failure, but offensive: it never differentiates among nations and peoples according to that which is within the mind and the heart of the people.  The German Emperor directed the Austrian ultimatum to Servia, insisting upon stronger demands than were at first proposed.  Then, turning his back upon the scene, he was able to protest that he was not responsible.  Yet the published correspondence from every capital in Europe now shows that the German Emperor fenced off every attempt to get Austria to modify or postpone or discuss her demands.  Germany was ready for everything except the interference of Great Britain.  A private telephone rang at five o'clock one morning in Berlin and an American lady was informed from a social quarter that \"Something dreadful has happened.\"  \"Something awful--something undreamed of.\" The American lady quickly asked, \"Has the Kaiser been assassinated?\" as the tone over the telephone indicated nothing less.  The response was, \"England has declared war!\"  That was the most unlooked-for step in all the German calculations.  Every spy report, every diplomatic agency, military and civil, had reported that England was out of the running: Ireland in revolution, India in sedition, Canada, Australia, and South Africa just ready to break away from the British yoke.  The conception of the British empire as a federation of free peoples governing themselves, under a constitutional monarchy, is something incomprehensible in the German idea of government.  The German idea is of colonies attached to and paying tribute to the crown, something to be ruled over, governed, taxed, and made to serve.  Russia might go to war exposing in the field her weakness already spread out on paper by Russian authorities, with copies in Vienna and Berlin; but that England or Great Britain could or would fight at this time was an impossibility; although later England was to become \"The vassal of Germany.\"  And the wonderment of Germany has become the wonderment of the world. \"Roll up,\" said Kitchener, and 2,000,000 men sprang to arms.  More than 800,000 of them are on the Continent; 1,700,000 of them are in training.  \"Roll up,\" said Lloyd George, the Chancellor of the British Exchequer; and $1,700,000,000 of war loan is rolling into the British Treasury, a sum one half the national debt of England and nearly twice the national debt of the United States.  If necessary, the number of men in arms will be doubled to 4,000,000 and the enormous subscription just made to England's war loan will be doubled and quadrupled.  The life of the empire as respects money and men is at stake, and no sacrifice is too great.  If treaties are \"scraps of paper\" and neutral states are to have no rights or protection, there is no safety in the world, no sacredness of contracts; the world is at an end and chaos reigns.     CHAPTER IV  PEACE PROPOSALS  The Bagdad Railroad--The English Oil Concession--The German Alliance with Turkey--Austria the Hand of Germany--The Decay of Turkey--The New Map.   How ridiculous are American peace proposals concerning the Audacious War of 1914 may be judged from this announcement which I am able to make:--  The return of the French government from Bordeaux to Paris was determined upon from two points of view: safety and political necessity.  The French people were angered that Paris should have been deserted, but notwithstanding the political reasons, which were more forceful than the public will be permitted to know, the return would not have been undertaken had not the military authorities considered the move a safe one.  How safe will be evidenced by this--that at both Bordeaux and Paris this problem was before the authorities: \"Events have now progressed so far that it is time for the Allies to consider what will be their terms of peace.  These terms must be divided into many classes, ranging from those in which only one of the Allies has an interest to those in which all have an interest.  Of course, the latter will be the most complex, and it is time now to begin with the complexities of the most far-reaching situation.  This is Mesopotamia and the Bagdad railroad.\"  Now who in Washington knows anything about Mesopotamia or the Bagdad railroad?  Yet here is the key of the most far-reaching problem in any peace proposals.  It is because this matter can now be settled that the plunging of Turkey into the war by Enver Bey has made all Europe rejoice.  The Germans think Turkey is another 16 1/2-inch howitzer or \"Jack Johnson\" putting black smoke over the British empire.  The rest of Europe now knows the whole of Turkey is on the table, and the carving, it is believed, will be had with no plates extended from either Austria or Germany.  For the first time the Turkish problem can be really settled instead of patched.  Some years ago I was astonished to learn in Europe that American banking interests, and American contracting and engineering firms in alliance therewith, had their eyes upon Asia Minor and the possibility of its development by American railroad enterprise.  I was astonished to learn that some people at Constantinople had authority for the use of the name of J. P. Morgan & Co.  Indeed, a railroad concession in Asia Minor, the details of which it is not now necessary to go into, had been arranged, I was told, and lacked only signatures.  The American people felt that the Germans were the little devils under the table who stayed the hand of the Sultan, and kept his pen off the parchment.  Never would the signature come down on that paper, although declared to have been many times promised.  The English were, of course, vitally interested in any railroad concessions in Asia Minor as opening the route to the Persian Gulf and India.  Money talks with Turkey as nowhere else.  The Germans had made a great impression upon the Bosphorus.  Nobody at that point in the geography of the world could fail to see the wonderful commercial progress of the Germans and the military power that stood behind ready to back it up.  A concession for a railroad from the Bosphorus to Bagdad and through Mesopotamia to the Persian Gulf finally went to Germany, and the signature of the Sultan was at the bottom of the paper.  There was, of course, the usual Oriental compromise, and the concession for the oil fields of Mesopotamia went to the English; but the signature of the Sultan is still lacking to that piece of paper.  English statesmen announced that the Bagdad railroad was a purely private enterprise, financed in Germany by people associated with the Deutsche Bank.  They had later to confess that error.  Germany laughed and later openly announced that the Bagdad railroad was a Prussian enterprise of state.  In fact, this concession, which is likely to be famous in history when the Allies win, was handed over to the German Emperor personally by the Sultan.  Already a thousand miles of this road have been constructed through Asia Minor to Mosul.  The concession carries the mineral rights for ten miles on either side of the railroad, except through the oil fields of Mesopotamia, said to be among the greatest of the oil fields of the world.  They are really part of the famous Russian oil territory between Batum and Baku, or the Black and Caspian seas, which extends not only south into Mesopotamia but is now being developed far to the north in the Ural Mountains of Great Russia.  Steadily the influence of Germany progressed with Turkey, now through one channel, now through another.  When the Bulgarian war broke out, it was German guns and German officers and German money that upheld the Turks.  The French put their money "]]]
