On one side were the forested hills, purple with the mists of rising vapor and still streaked with white patches of snow where the dense woods shut out the sunlight.  On the other lay the silver expanse of the St. Lawrence, more like a lake than a river, with mile on mile southwestward of rush-grown marshes, where plover and curlew and duck and wild geese flocked to their favorite feeding-grounds three hundred years ago just as they do to-day.  Northeastward, the three mouths of the St. Maurice poured their spring flood into the St. Lawrence.  The hunters were very young.  Only hunters rash with the courage of untried youth would have left the shelter of the fort walls when all the world knew that the Iroquois had been lying in ambush round the little settlement of Three Rivers day and night for the preceding year. Not a week passed but some settler working on the outskirts of Three Rivers was set upon and left dead in his fields by marauding Iroquois. The tortures suffered by Jogues, the great Jesuit missionary who had been captured by the Iroquois a few years before, were still fresh in the memory of every man, woman, and child in New France.  It was from Three Rivers that Piescaret, the famous Algonquin chief who could outrun a deer, had set out against the Iroquois, turning his snowshoes back to front, so that the track seemed to lead north when he was really going south, and then, having thrown his pursuers off the trail, coming back on his own footsteps, slipping up stealthily on the Iroquois that were following the false scent, and tomahawking the laggards.[1]  It was from Three Rivers that the Mohawks had captured the Algonquin girl who escaped by slipping off the thongs that bound her.  Stepping over the prostrate forms of her sleeping guards, such a fury of revenge possessed her that she seized an axe and brained the nearest sleeper, then eluded her pursuers by first hiding in a hollow tree and afterward diving under the debris of a beaver dam.  [Illustration: Three Rivers in 1757.]  These things were known to every inhabitant of Three Rivers.  Farmers had flocked into the little fort and could venture back to their fields only when armed with a musket.[2]  Yet the three young hunters rashly left the shelter of the fort walls and took the very dangerous path that led between the forests and the water.  One of the young men was barely in his seventeenth year.[3]  This was Pierre Esprit Radisson, from St. Malo, the town of the famous Cartier.  Young Radisson had only come to New France the year before, and therefore could not realize the dangers of Indian warfare.  Like boys the world over, the three went along, boasting how they would fight if the Indians came.  One skirted the forest, on the watch for Iroquois, the others kept to the water, on the lookout for game.  About a mile from Three Rivers they encountered a herdsman who warned them to keep out from the foot of the hills. Things that looked like a multitude of heads had risen out of the earth back there, he said, pointing to the forests.  That set the young hunters loading their pistols and priming muskets.  It must also have chilled their zest; for, shooting some ducks, one of the young men presently declared that he had had enough--he was going back.  With that daring which was to prove both the lodestar and the curse of his life, young Radisson laughed to scorn the sudden change of mind. Thereupon the first hunter was joined by the second, and the two went off in high dudgeon.  With a laugh, Pierre Radisson marched along alone, foreshadowing his after"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18216"],["title","Pathfinders of the West (#3)"],["body","ife,--a type of every pathfinder facing the dangers of the unknown with dauntless scorn, an immortal type of the world-hero.  Shooting at every pace and hilarious over his luck, Radisson had wandered some nine miles from the fort, when he came to a stream too deep to ford and realized that he already had more game than he could possibly carry.  Hiding in hollow trees what he could not bring back, he began trudging toward Three Rivers with a string of geese, ducks, and odd teal over his shoulders, Wading swollen brooks and scrambling over windfalls, he retraced his way without pause till he caught sight of the town chapel glimmering in the sunlight against the darkening horizon above the river.  He was almost back where his comrades had left him; so he sat down to rest.  The cowherd had driven his cattle back to Three Rivers.[4]  The river came lapping through the rushes. There was a clacking of wild-fowl flocking down to their marsh nests; perhaps a crane flopped through the reeds; but Radisson, who had laughed the nervous fears of the others to scorn, suddenly gave a start at the lonely sounds of twilight.  Then he noticed that his pistols were water-soaked.  Emptying the charges, he at once reloaded, and with characteristic daring crept softly back to reconnoitre the woods. Dodging from tree to tree, he peered up and down the river.  Great flocks of ducks were swimming on the water.  That reassured him, for the bird is more alert to alarm than man.  The fort was almost within call.  Radisson determined to have a shot at such easy quarry; but as he crept through the grass toward the game, he almost stumbled over what rooted him to the spot with horror.  Just as they had fallen, naked and scalped, with bullet and hatchet wounds all over their bodies, lay his comrades of the morning, dead among the rushes. Radisson was too far out to get back to the woods.  Stooping, he tried to grope to the hiding of the rushes.  As he bent, half a hundred heads rose from the grasses, peering which way he might go.  They were behind, before, on all sides--his only hope was a dash for the cane-grown river, where he might hide by diving and wading, till darkness gave a chance for a rush to the fort.  Slipping bullet and shot in his musket as he ran, and ramming down the paper, hoping against hope that he had not been seen, he dashed through the brushwood.  A score of guns crashed from the forest.[5]  Before he realized the penalty that the Iroquois might exact for such an act, he had fired back; but they were upon him.  He was thrown down and disarmed.  When he came giddily to his senses, he found himself being dragged back to the woods, where the Iroquois flaunted the fresh scalps of his dead friends.  Half drawn, half driven, he was taken to the shore.  Here, a flotilla of canoes lay concealed where he had been hunting wild-fowl but a few hours before.  Fires were kindled, and the crotched sticks driven in the ground to boil the kettle for the evening meal.  The young Frenchman was searched, stripped, and tied round the waist with a rope, the Indians yelling and howling like so many wolves all the while till a pause was given their jubilation by the alarm of a scout that the French and Algonquins were coming.  In a trice, the fire was out and covered.  A score of young braves set off to reconnoitre. Fifty remained at the boats; but if Radisson hoped for a rescue, he was doomed to disappointment.  The warriors returned.  Seventy Iroquois gathered round a second fire for the night.  The one predominating passion of the savage nature is bravery.  Lying in ambush, they had heard this French youth laugh at his comrades' fears.  In defiance of danger, they had seen him go hunting alone.  After he had heard an alarm, he had daringly come out to shoot at the ducks.  And, then, boy as he was, when attacked he had instantly fired back at numerous enough enemies to have intimidated a score of grown men.  There is not the slightest doubt it was Radisson's bravery that now saved him from the fate of his companions.  His clothes were returned.  While the evening meal was boiling, young warriors dressed and combed the Frenchman's hair after the manner of braves.  They daubed his cheeks with war-paint; and when they saw that their rancid meats turned him faint, they boiled meat in clean water and gave him meal browned on burning sand.[6]  He did not struggle to escape, so he was now untied.  That night he slept between two warriors under a common blanket, through which he counted the stars.  For fifty years his home was to be under the stars.  It is typically Radisson when he could add: \"I slept a sound sleep; for they wakened me upon the breaking of the day.\"  In the morning they embarked in thirty-seven canoes, two Indians in each boat, with Radisson tied to the cross-bar of one, the scalps lying at his feet.  Spreading out on the river, they beat their paddles on the gunwales of the canoes, shot off guns, and uttered the shrill war-cry--\"Ah-oh!  Ah-oh!  Ah-oh!\" [7]  Lest this were not sufficient defiance to the penned-up fort on the river bank, the chief stood up in his canoe, signalled silence, and gave three shouts.  At once the whole company answered till the hills rang; and out swung the fleet of canoes with more shouting and singing and firing of guns, each paddle-stroke sounding the death knell to the young Frenchman's hopes.  By sunset they were among the islands at the mouth of the Richelieu, where muskrats scuttled through the rushes and wild-fowl clouded the air.  The south shore of Lake St. Peter was heavily forested; the north, shallow.  The lake was flooded with spring thaw, and the Mohawks could scarcely find camping-ground among the islands.  The young prisoner was deathly sick from the rank food that he had eaten and heart-sick from the widening distance between himself and Three Rivers. Still, they treated him kindly, saying, \"Chagon!  Chagon!--Be merry! Cheer up!\"  The fourth day up the Richelieu, he was embarked without being fastened to the cross-bar, and he was given a paddle.  Fresh to the work, Radisson made a labor of his oar.  The Iroquois took the paddle and taught him how to give the light, deft, feather strokes of the Indian canoeman.  On the river they met another band of warriors, and the prisoner was compelled to show himself a trophy of victory and to sing songs for his captors.  That evening the united bands kindled an enormous campfire and with the scalps of the dead flaunting from spear heads danced the scalp dance, reënacting in pantomime all the episodes of the massacre to the monotonous chant-chant, of a recitative relating the foray.  At the next camping-ground, Radisson's hair was shaved in front and decorated on top with the war-crest of a brave. Having translated the white man into a savage, they brought him one of the tin looking-glasses used by Indians to signal in the sun.  \"I, viewing myself all in a pickle,\" relates Radisson, \"smeared with red and black, covered with such a top, . . . could not but fall in love with myself, if I had not had better instructions to shun the sin of pride.\"  Radisson saw that apparent compliance with the Mohawks might win him a chance to escape; so he was the first to arise in the morning, wakening the others and urging them that it was time to break camp.  The stolid Indians were not to be moved by an audacious white boy.  Watching the young prisoner, the keepers lay still, feigning sleep.  Radisson rose. They made no protest.  He wandered casually down to the water side. One can guess that the half-closed eyelids of his guards opened a trifle: was the mouse trying to get away from the cat?  To the Indians' amusement, instead of trying to escape, Radisson picked up a spear and practised tossing it, till a Mohawk became so interested that he jumped up and taught the young Frenchman the proper throws.  That day the Indians gave him the present of a hunting-knife.  North of Lake Champlain, the river became so turbulent that they were forced to land and make a _portage_.  Instead of lagging, as captives frequently did from very fear as they approached nearer and nearer what was almost certain to mean death-torture in the Iroquois villages--Radisson hurried over the rocks, helping the older warriors to carry their packs.  At night he was the first to cut wood for the camp fire.  About a week from the time they had left Lake St. Peter, they entered Lake Champlain.  On the shores of the former had been enacted the most hideous of all Indian customs--the scalp dance.  On the shores of the latter was performed one of the most redeeming rites of Indian warfare. Round a small pool of water a coppice of branches was interlaced.  Into the water were thrown hot stones till the enclosure was steaming.  Here each warrior took a sweat-bath of purification to prepare for reunion with his family.  Invoking the spirits as they bathed, the warriors emerged washed--as they thought--of all blood-guilt.[8]  [Illustration: Map of the Iroquois country in the days of Radisson.]  In the night shots sounded through the heavy silence of the forest, and the Mohawks embarked in alarm, compelling their white prisoner to lie flat in the bottom of the canoe.  In the morning when he awakened, he found the entire band hidden among the rushes of the lake.  They spent several days on Lake Champlain, then glided past wooded mountains down a calm river to Lake George, where canoes were abandoned and the warriors struck westward through dense forests to the country of the Iroquois.  Two days from the lake slave women met the returning braves, and in Radisson's words, \"loaded themselves like mules with baggage.\" On this woodland march Radisson won golden opinions for himself by two acts: struck by an insolent young brave, he thrashed the culprit soundly; seeing an old man staggering under too heavy a load, the white youth took the burden on his own shoulders.  The return of the warriors to their"]]]
