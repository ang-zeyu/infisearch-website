Mother made me talk to her, and, as I didn't know what else to talk about, I told her about our Sand Club, and about the Court to-day and everything. And she wanted to belong to the club, and I told her she couldn't, because it was just the Maynards and the Craigs. And she was madder'n hops, and she coaxed me, and I still said no, and then she said she'd get even with us somehow.\"  \"But, Tom,\" said King, \"we don't know that girl to speak to. We hardly know her by sight.\"  \"But we do. We knew her when we were here last summer, but, you see, this year we've had you two to play with, so we've sort of neglected her,--and she doesn't like it.\"  \"But that's no reason she should spoil our palace,\" and Marjorie looked sadly at the scene of ruin and destruction.  \"No; and of course I'm not sure that she did do it. But she said she'd do something to get even with you.\"  \"With me? Why, she doesn't know me at all.\"  \"That's what she's mad about. She says you're stuck up, and you put on airs and never look at her.\"  \"Why, how silly! I don't know her, but somehow, from her looks, I _know_ I shouldn't like her.\"  \"No, you wouldn't, Marjorie. She's selfish, and she's ill-tempered. She flies into a rage at any little thing, and,--well, she isn't a bit like you Maynards.\"  \"_No!_ and I'm glad of it! I wouldn't _want_ to be like such a stuck-up thing!\"  These last words were spoken by a strange voice, and Marjorie looked round quickly to see a shock of red hair surmounting a very angry little face just appearing from behind the small hill, beneath whose overhanging shadow they had built their palace.  \"Why, Hester Corey!\" shouted Tom. \"What are you doing here?\"  \"I came to see how you like your old sand-house!\" she jeered, mockingly, and making faces at Marjorie between her words. Marjorie was utterly astonished. It was her first experience with a child of this type, and she didn't know just how to take her.  The newcomer was a little termagant. Her big blue eyes seemed to flash with anger, and as she danced about, shaking her fist at Marjorie and pointing her forefinger at her, she cried, tauntingly, \"Stuck up! Proudy!\"  Marjorie grew indignant. She had done nothing knowingly to provoke this wrath, so she faced the visitor squarely, and glared back at her.  \"I'd rather be stuck up than to be such a spiteful thing as you are!\" she declared. \"Did _you_ tear down this palace that we took such trouble to build?\"  \"Yes, I did!\" said Hester. \"And if you build it again, I'll tear it down again,--so, there, now!\"  \"You'll do no such thing!\" shouted Tom.  \"Huh, Smarty! What have you got to say about it?\"  The crazy little Hester flew at Tom and pounded him vigorously on the back.  \"I hate you!\" she cried. \"I _hate_ you!\"  As a matter of fact, her little fists couldn't hurt the big, sturdy boy, but her intense anger made him angry too.  \"You, Hester Corey!\" he cried. \"You leave me alone!\"  King stood a little apart, with his hands in his pockets, looking at the combatants.  \"Say, we've had about enough of this,\" he said, speaking quietly, and without excitement. \"We Maynards are not accustomed to this sort of thing. We squabble sometimes, but we never get really angry.\"  \"Goody-goody boy!\" said Hester, sneeringly, and making one of her worst faces at him. For some reason this performance struck King as funny.  \"Do it again,\" he said. \"How do you ever squink up your nose like that! Bet you can't do it three times in succession.\"  The audacious Hester tried it, and the result was so ludicrous they all laughed.  \"Now look here,\" went on King, \"we're not acquainted with you, but we know you're Hester Corey. We know you spoiled our Sand Palace, just out of angry spite. Now, Hester Corey, you've got to be punished for that. We're peaceable people ourselves, but we're just, also. We were about to have a nice celebration, but you've put an end to that before it began. So, instead, we're going to have a trial. You're the prisoner, and you've pleaded guilty,--at least, you've confessed your crime. Queen Sandy, get into that throne,--never mind if it is upset,--set it up again. Grand Sandjandrum, take your place on that mussed up sand heap. You two other chaps,--stand one each side of the prisoner as sentinels. I'll conduct this case, and Queen Sandy will pronounce the sentence. It's us Maynards that Hester Corey seems to have a grudge against, so it's up to us Maynards to take charge of the case. Prisoner, stand on that board there.\"  \"I won't do it!\" snapped Hester, and the red locks shook vigorously.  \"You will do it,\" said King, quietly, and for some reason or other Hester quailed before his glance, and then meekly stood where he told her to.  \"Have you anything to say for yourself?\" King went on. \"Any excuse to offer for such a mean, hateful piece of work?\"  Hester sulked a minute, then she said:  \"Yes, I was mad at you, because you all have such good times, and wouldn't let me in them.\"  \"What do you mean by that? You never asked to come in.\"  \"I did. I asked Tom Craig yesterday, and he wouldn't ask you.\"  \"Then why are you mad at us?\"  \"Because you're so proud and exclusive. You think yourselves so great; you think nobody's as good as you are!\"  \"That isn't true, Hester,\" said King, quite gently; \"and even if it were, are you proving yourself better than we are by cutting up this mean, babyish trick? If you want us to like you, why not make yourself likeable, instead of horrid and hateful?\"  This was a new idea to Hester, and she stared at King as if greatly interested.  \"That's right,\" he went on. \"If people want people to like them, they must be likeable. They must be obliging and kind and pleasant, and not small and spiteful.\"  \"You haven't been very nice to me,\" muttered Hester.  \"We haven't had a chance. And before we get a chance you upset everything by making us dislike you! What kind of common sense is that?\"  \"Maybe you could forgive me,\" suggested Hester, hopefully.  \"Maybe we could, later on. But we're for fair play, and you treated us unfairly. So now, you've got to be punished. Queen Sandy, Grand Sandjandrum, which of you can suggest proper punishment for this prisoner of ours?\"  Tom thought for a moment, then he said:  \"Seems 's if she ought to put this palace back in order, just as it was when she found it,--but that's too hard work for a girl.\"  \"I'll help her,\" said Harry, earnestly. \"I'm sorry for her.\"  \"Sorry for her!\" cried Tom, with blazing eyes. \"_Sorry_ for the girl that spoiled our palace!\"  \"Well, you see,\" went on Harry, \"she's sorry herself now.\"     CHAPTER IV  SAND COURT   With one accord, they all looked at Hester. Sure enough, it was easily to be seen that she was sorry. All her anger and rage had vanished, and she stood digging one toe into the sand, and twisting from side to side, with her eyes cast down, and two big tears rolling slowly down her cheeks.  Marjorie sprang up from her wabbly throne, and running to Hester, threw her arms around her.  \"Don't cry, Hester,\" she said. \"We'll all forgive you. I think you lost your temper and I think you're sorry now, aren't you?\"  \"Oh, yes, yes, I am!\" sobbed Hester. \"But I envied the good times you had, and when Tom wouldn't let me into your club, I got so mad I didn't know what to do.\"  \"There, there, don't cry any more,\" and Midget smoothed the tangled red mop, and tried to comfort the bad little Hester.  Tom looked rather disappointed.  \"I say,\" he began, \"she did an awful mean thing, and she ought to be----\"  \"Hold on a minute, Tom,\" said Marjorie. \"I'm Queen of this club, and what I say goes! Is that right, my courtiers?\"  She looked round at the boys, smiling in a wheedlesome way, and King said, \"Right, O Queen Sandy! Right always and ever, in the hearts of your gentlemen-in-waiting.\"  \"You bet you are!\" cried Tom, quick to follow King's lead. \"Our noble Queen has but to say the word, and it is our law. Therefore, O Queen, we beg thee to mete out a just punishment to this prisoner within our gates.\"  \"Hear ye! Hear ye!\" said Midget, with great dramatic fervor. \"I hereby forgive this prisoner of ours, because she's truly sorry she acted like the dickens. And as a punishment, I condemn her to rebuild this royal palace, but, following Harry's example, we will all help her with the work.\"  Then King burst forth into song:      \"Hooray, Hooray, for our noble Queen,     The very best monarch that ever was seen.     There's nobody quite so perfectly dandy,     As our most gracious, most noble Queen Sandy!\"  They all repeated this chorus, and the Queen bowed and smiled at her devoted court.  \"And also,\" her Royal Highness went on, \"we hereby take into our club Miss Hester Corey as a new member. I'm glad to have another girl in it,--and what I say goes!\"  This time Tom made up the song:      \"What she says, goes!     She's sweet as a rose,     From head to toes,     So what she says, goes!\"  \"Miss Hester Corey is now a member,\" said Midget, \"and her name is,--is----\"  \"Sand Witch,\" suggested Tom.  \"Yes,\" said King; \"you expect witches to cut up tricks.\"  \"All right,\" said Hester. \"Call me Sand Witch, and you'll see there are good witches as well as bad.\"  \"Come on, then,\" said Marjorie, \"and show us how you can work. Let's put this palace back into shape again as quick as scat!\"  They all fell to work, and it didn't take so very long after all. Hester was conquered by the power of Marjorie's kindness, and she was meek as a lamb. She did whatever she was told, and was a quick and willing worker.  \"Now,\" said Midget, after it was all in order once more, \"now we'll have our celebration. You see, we have six in our court now, instead of five, and I think it's nicer. I'll give the Sand Witch my sash to wear, and she can be my first lady-in-waiting.\"  This position greatly pleased Hester, and she took her place at the side of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18035"],["title","Marjorie at Seacote (#5)"],["body","enthroned Queen, while Tom stood at her other side. King played a grand tune, and they all sang.  The song was in honor of the flag-raising, and was hastily composed by Marjorie for the occasion:      \"Our Flag, our Flag, our Sand Club Flag!     Long may she wave, long may she wag!     And may our Sand Club ever stand     A glory to our Native Land.\"  Tom persisted in singing \"a glory to our native _sand_,\" and King said _strand_, but after all, it didn't matter.  Then Sandow, bearing the flag, stepped gravely forward, and the boys all helped to plant it firmly in the middle of Sand Court, while the Queen and her lady-in-waiting nodded approval.  \"Ha, Courtiers! I prithee sit!\" the Queen commanded, when the flag was gaily waving in the breeze.  Her four courtiers promptly sat on the ground at her feet, and the Queen addressed them thus:  \"Gentlemen-in-waiting of Sandringham Palace, there are much affairs of state now before us. First must we form our club, our Sand Club.\"  \"Most noble Queen,\" and Tom rose to his feet, \"have I your permission to speak?\"  \"Speak!\" said the Queen, graciously, waving her sceptre at him.  \"Then I rise to inquire if this is a secret organization.\"  \"You bet it is!\" cried King, jumping up. \"The very secretest ever! If any one lets out the secrets of these secret meetings, he shall be excommunicated in both feet!\"  \"A just penalty!\" said Tom, gravely.  \"Is all well, O fair Queen? Do you agree?\"  \"Yes, I agree,\" said the Queen, smiling. \"But I want to know what these secrets are to be about.\"  \"That's future business,\" declared King. \"Just now we have to elect officers, and all that.\"  \"All right,\" said Marjorie, \"but you must be more courtly about it. Say it more,--you know how I mean.\"  \"As thus,\" spoke up the lady-in-waiting, dropping on one knee before the Queen.  \"What is the gracious will of your Royal Highness in the matter of secretary and treasurer, O Queen!\"  \"Yes, that's better. Well, my court, to tell you the truth, I don't think that we need a secretary and such things, because it isn't a regular club. Let us content ourselves with our present noble offices. Grand Sandjandrum, what are the duties of thy high office?\"  \"No duties, but all pleasures, when serving thee, O noble and gracious Queen!\"  \"That's fine,\" said Midget, clapping her hands. \"Hither, Sir Sand Piper! What are thy duties at, court?\"  \"Your Majesty,\" said King, bowing low, \"it is my humble part to play the pipes, or to lay the pipes, as the case may be. I do not smoke pipes, but, if it be thy gracious wish, I can blow fair soap bubbles from them.\"  \"Sand Piper, I see you know your business,\" said the Queen. \"Ha! Sand Crab, what dost thou do each day?\"  \"Just scramble around in the sand,\" replied Harry, and suiting the action to the word, he gave such a funny scrambling performance that they all applauded.  \"Right well done, noble Sand Crab,\" commented the smiling Queen. \"And thou, O Sandow?\"  \"I do all the strong-arm work required in the palace,\" said Dick, doubling up his little fist, and trying to make it look large and powerful.  \"Now, thee, my fair lady-in-waiting, what dost thou do in this, my court?\"  Hester shook back her mop of red curls, and her eyes danced as she answered, gaily:  \"I am the Court Sand Witch! I cut up tricks of all sorts, as doth become a witch. Aye, many a time will I cause enchantments to fall upon thee, one and all! I am a magic witch, and I can cast spells!\"  Hester waved her arms about, and swayed from side to side, her eyes fixed in a glassy stare, and her red curls bobbing.  \"Good gracious!\" cried Marjorie. \"You're like a witch I saw on the stage once in a fairy pantomime. Say, Hester, let's have a pantomime entertainment some day.\"  \"All right. My mother'll help us. She's always getting up private theatricals and things like that. She says I inherit her dramatic talent.\"  \"All right,\" said Tom, warningly; \"but don't you turn your dramatic talent toward tearing down our palace again.\"  \"Of course I won't, now I'm a member.\"  \"Of course she won't,\" agreed Marjorie. \"Now, my courtiers, and lady-in-waiting, there's another subject to come before your royal attention. We must have a Court Journal.\"  \"What's that?\" inquired Harry.  \"Why, a sort of a paper, you know, with all the court news in it.\"  \"There isn't any.\"  \"But there will be. We're not fairly started yet. Now who'll write this paper?\"  \"All of us,\" suggested Tom.  \"Yes; but there must be one at the head of it,--sort of editor, you know.\"  \"Guess it better be King,\" said Tom, thoughtfully. \"He knows the most about writing things.\"  \"All right,\" agreed King. \"I'll edit the paper, only you must all contribute. We'll have it once a week, and everybody must send me some contribution, if it's only a little poem or something.\"  \"I can't write poems,\" said Harry, earnestly, \"but I can gather up news,--and like that.\"  \"Yes,\" said Marjorie, \"that's what I mean. But it must be news about us court people, or maybe our families.\"  \"Can't we make it up?\" asked Hester.  \"Yes, I s'pose so, if you make it real court like and grand sounding.\"  \"What shall we call our paper?\" asked King.  \"Oh, just the _Court Journal_,\" replied Midget.  \"I don't think so,\" objected Hester. \"I think it ought to have a name like _The Sand Club_.\"  \"_The Jolly Sandboy_,\" exclaimed Tom. \"How's that?\"  \"But two of us are girls!\" said Marjorie.  \"That doesn't matter, it's just the name of the paper, you know. And it sounds so gay and jolly.\"  \"I like it,\" declared King, and so they all agreed to the name.  \"Now, my courtiers and noble friends,\" said their Queen, \"it's time we all scooted home to luncheon. My queen-dowager mother likes me to be on time for meals. Also, my majesty and my royal sand piper can't come back to play this afternoon. But shall this court meet to-morrow morning?\"  \"You bet, your Majesty!\" exclaimed Tom, with fervor.  \"That isn't very courtly language, my Grand Sandjandrum.\"  \"I humbly beg your Majesty's pardon, and I prostrate myself in humble humility!\" And Tom sprawled on his face at Marjorie's feet.  \"Rise, Sir Knight,\" said the gracious Queen, and then the court dispersed toward its various homes.  \"Well, we had the greatest time this morning you ever heard of!\" announced Marjorie as, divested of her royal trappings and clad in a fresh pink gingham, she sat at the luncheon table.  \"What was it all about, Moppets?\" asked Mrs. Maynard.  So King and Marjorie together told all about the intrusion of Hester on their celebration, and how they had finally taken her into the Sand Club as a member.  \"I think my children behaved very well,\" said Mrs. Maynard, looking at the two with pride.  \"I did get sort of mad at first, Mother,\" Marjorie confessed, not wanting more praise than was her just due.  \"Well, I don't blame you!\" declared King. \"Why, that girl made most awful faces at Mops, and talked to her just horrid! If she hadn't calmed down afterward we couldn't have played with her at all.\"  \"I've heard about that child,\" said Mrs. Maynard. \"She has most awful fits of temper, I'm told. Mrs. Craig says that Hester will be as good and as sweet as a lamb for days,--and then she'll fly into a rage over some little thing. I'm glad you children are not like that.\"  \"I'm glad, too,\" said King. \"We're not angels, but if we acted up like Hester did at first we couldn't live in the house with each other!\"  \"Her mother is an actress,\" observed Marjorie.  \"Oh, no, Midget, you're mistaken,\" said her mother. \"I know Mrs. Corey, and she isn't an actress at all, and never was. But she is fond of amateur theatricals, and she is president of a club that gives little plays now and then.\"  \"Yes, that's it,\" said King. \"Hester said her mother had dramatic talent, and she had inherited it. Have you dramatic talent, Mother?\"  \"I don't know, King,\" said Mrs. Maynard, laughing. \"Your father and I have joined their dramatic club, but it remains to be seen whether we can make a success of it.\"  \"Oh, Mother!\" cried Marjorie. \"Are you really going to act in a play? Oh, can we see you?\"  \"I don't know yet, Midget. Probably it will be an entertainment only for grown-ups. We've just begun rehearsals.\"  \"Have we dramatic talent, Mother?\"  \"Not to any astonishing degree. But, yes, I suppose your fondness for playing at court life and such things shows a dramatic taste.\"  \"Oh, it's great fun, Mother! I just love to sit on that throne with my long trail wopsed on the floor beside me, and my sceptre sticking up, and my courtiers all around me,--oh, Mother, I think I'd like to be a real queen!\"  \"Well, you see, Midget, you were born in a country that doesn't employ queens.\"  \"And I'm glad of it!\" cried Marjorie, patriotically. \"Hooray! for the land of the free and the home of the brave! I guess I don't care to be a real queen, I guess I'll be a president's wife instead. Say, Mother, won't you and Father write us some poems for _The Jolly Sandboy_?\"  \"What is that, Midget?\"  \"Oh, it's our court journal,--and you and Father do write such lovely poetry. Will you, Mother?\"  \"Yes, I 'spect so.\"  \"Oh, goody! When you say 'I 'spect so,' you always _do_. Hey, King, Rosy Posy ought to have a sandy kind of a name, even if she doesn't come to our court meetings.\"  \"'Course she ought. And she can come sometimes, if she doesn't upset things.\"  \"She can't upset things worse'n Hester did.\"  \"No; but I don't believe Hester will act up like that again.\"  \"She may, Marjorie,\" said Mrs. Maynard. \"I've heard her mother say she can't seem to curb Hester's habit of flying into a temper. So just here, my two loved ones, let me ask you to be kind to the little girl, and if she gets angry, don't flare back at her, but try 'a soft answer.'\"  \"But, Mother,\" said King, \"that isn't so awful easy! And, anyway, I don't think she ought to do horrid things,--like tumbling down our palace,--and then we just forgive her, and take her into the club!\"  \"Why not, King?\"  King looked a little nonplussed.  \"Why"]]]
