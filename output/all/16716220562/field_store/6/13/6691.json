Plate LXXXVIII shows a stone house belonging to one of the wealthiest men in the tribe, Bitcai by name. It is situated on the western slope of the Tunicha mountains and was built some years ago, but it is a type of house which is becoming more and more frequent on the reservation. There is practically nothing aboriginal about it except a part of its interior furniture and its inhabitants, and the only one of the old requirements that has been met is the fronting of the house to the east, while the character of the site and the natural conditions demand a western front.  The log houses referred to are constructed much like the stone house shown in the illustration, except that they are built usually by Indian labor and ordinarily are covered with flat earthen roofs. Frequently the logs are hewn square before being placed in the walls, which present a very neat and finished appearance. Sometimes door and window frames are procured from the sawmill or from the traders, and add to such appearance, while nearly always one or more glazed sashes occupy the window openings and board doors close the entrances. In nearly all cases the requirement that the entrance should face the east is observed, but it is being more and more ignored, and in the houses constructed within the last few years the ancient custom is frequently violated. Unless the principal entrance were made to face the east, the performers in the dedicatory ceremonies could not take their prescribed positions and the ceremony would have to be either modified or omitted altogether.   CEREMONIES OF DEDICATION  Among the Pueblo Indians there are certain rituals and ceremonial observances connected with the construction of the houses, but in the Navaho system nothing of a ceremonial nature is introduced until the conclusion of the manual labor. Usually there are enough volunteers to finish the work in one day, and by evening everything is ready for the dedication. The wife sweeps out the house with a wisp of grass and she or her husband makes a fire on the floor directly under the smoke hole. She then goes to her bundles of household effects, which are still outside, and pours a quantity of white cornmeal into a shallow saucer-shape basket. She hands this to the _qasçíŋ_, or head of the family, who enters the hogán and rubs a handful of the dry meal on the five principal timbers which form the _tsá¢i_ or frame, beginning with the south doorway timber. He rubs the meal only on one place, as high up as he can reach easily, and then does the same successively on the south timber, the west timber, the north timber, and the north doorway timber. While making these gifts, as the proceeding is termed, the man preserves a strict silence, and then, as with a sweeping motion of his hand from left to right (_cabĭkégo_, as the sun travels) he sprinkles the meal around the outer circumference of the floor, he says in low measured tones--    _Qojónli_             _coġán_   May it be delightful  my house;    _Cĭtsĭ´dje_   _qojónli_   From my head  may it be delightful;    _Cĭké¢e_    _qojónli_   To my feet  may it be delightful;    _Ciyá¢e_     _qojónli_   Where I lie  may it be delightful;    _Cĭkígĭ ¢áltso_  _qojónli_   All above me     may it be delightful;    _Cĭná ¢áltso_  _qojónli_   All around me  may it be delightful.  He then flings a little of the meal into the fire, saying--    _Qojónli hóçe_                  _cĭkóŋ_   May it he delightful and well,  my fire.  and tosses a handful or two up through the smoke hole, saying--    _Qojónli_             _Tcíŋhanoaí_        _cĭçá naiĭcní‘_   May it be delightful  Sun (day carrier),  my mother’s ancestor,                                                for this gift;    _Qojónli_             _nacále_          _coġán_   May it be delightful  as I walk around  my house.  Then two or three handfuls of meal are sprinkled out of the doorway while he says--    _Qojónli_             _caĕ´çin_            _cĭçá_   May it be delightful  this road of light,  my mother’s ancestor.  The woman then makes an offering to the fire by throwing a few small handfuls of meal upon it, and as she sprinkles it she says in a subdued voice--    _Qojónli_             _cĭkóŋ_   May it be delightful  my fire;    _Qojónli_             _caltcíni_        _¢áltso yahóçe_   May it be delightful  for my children;  may all be well;    _Qojónli_             _cibeaçán_                _¢áltso yahóçe_   May it be delightful  with my food and theirs;  may all be well;    _¢áltso cĭnalgéya_       _yahóçe ¢olel‘_   All my possessions well  may they be made                            (that is, may they be made to increase);    _¢áltso cĭl‘íŋ_  _yahóçe ¢olel‘_   All my flocks    well may they be made (to increase).  When a hogán is built for a woman who has no husband, or if the husband is absent at the time, the wife performs all these ceremonies. In the absence of white cornmeal, yellow cornmeal is sometimes used, but never the _çqa¢ĭçíŋ ¢oçlĭ´j_, the sacred blue pollen of certain flowers, which is reserved exclusively for the rites of the shaman.  By the time these forms have been observed night will have fallen. During the day, while the house building was in progress, the women were busily engaged in preparing food; all now gather inside the hogán, a blanket is suspended over the door frame, all the possessions of the family are bought in, sheepskins are spread on the floor, the fire is brightened and the men all squat around it. The women bring in food in earthen cooking pots and basins, and, having set them down among the men, they huddle together by themselves to enjoy the occasion as spectators. Every one helps himself from the pots by dipping in with his fingers, the meat is broken into pieces, and the bones are gnawed upon and sociably passed from hand to hand. When the feast is finished tobacco and corn husks are produced, cigarettes are made, everyone smokes, and convivial gossipy talk prevails. This continues for two or three hours, when the people who live near by get up their horses and ride home. Those from a long distance either find places to sleep in the hogán or wrap themselves in their blankets and sleep at the foot of a tree. This ceremony is known as the _qoġán aiíla_, a kind of salutation to the house.  But the _qoġán bĭgĭ´n_, the house devotions, have not yet been observed. Occasionally these take place as soon as the house is finished, but usually there is an interval of several days to permit the house builders to invite all their friends and to provide the necessary food for their entertainment. Although analogous to the Anglo-Saxon “house warming,” the _qoġán bĭgĭ´n_, besides being a merrymaking for the young people, has a much more solemn significance for the elders. If it be not observed soon after the house is built bad dreams will plague the dwellers therein, toothache (dreaded for mystic reasons) will torture them, and the evil influence from the north will cause them all kinds of bodily ill; the flocks will dwindle, ill luck will come, ghosts will haunt the place, and the house will become _bátsĭç_, tabooed.  A few days after the house is finished an arrangement is made with some shaman (_qaçál‘i_, devotional singer) to come and sing the ceremonial house songs. For this service he always receives a fee from those who engage him, perhaps a few sheep or their value, sometimes three or four horses or their equivalent, according to the circumstances of the house builders. The social gathering at the _qoġán bĭgĭ´n_ is much the same as that of the _qoġán aiíla_, when the house is built, except that more people are usually invited to the former. They feast and smoke, interchange scandal, and talk of other topics of interest, for some hours. Presently the _qaçál‘i_ seats himself under the main west timber so as to face the east, and the singing begins.  In this ceremony no rattle is used. The songs are begun by the shaman in a drawling tone and all the men join in. The _qaçál‘i_ acts only as leader and director. Each one, and there are many of them in the tribe, has his own particular songs, fetiches, and accompanying ceremonies, and after he has pitched a song he listens closely to hear whether the correct words are sung. This is a matter of great importance, as the omission of a part of the song or the incorrect rendering of any word would entail evil consequences to the house and its inmates. All the house songs of the numerous _qaçál‘i_ are of similar import but differ in minor details.  The first song is addressed to the east, and is as follows:    _House song to the East_    _Qa‘ádje_        _biyádje_  _beqoġán_      _aiíla_   Far in the east  far below  there a house  was made;    _Qojón_     _qoġáne_   Delightful  house.    _Qastcéyalçi_  _bebiqoġán_      _aiíla_   God of Dawn    there his house  was made;    _Qojón_     _qoġáne_   Delightful  house.    _Qayol‘kál‘_  _bebiqoġán_      _aiíla_   The Dawn      there his house  was made;    _Qojón_     _qoġáne_   Delightful  house.    _Naçáŋ l‘akaí_  _bebiqoġán_      _aiíla_   White Corn      there its house  was made;    _Qojón_     _qoġáne_   Delightful  house.    _Yu´¢i alçqasaí_  _bebiqoġán_       _aiíla_   Soft possessions  for them a house  was made;    _Qojón_     _qoġáne_   Delightful  house.    _Ço‘l‘á_         _nastcín_    _bebiqoġán_     _aiíla_,   Water in plenty  surrounding  for it a house  was made;    _Qojón_     _qoġáne_   Delightful  house.    _Çqa¢ĭçíŋ_   _bebiqoġán_     _aiíla_   Corn pollen  for it a house  was made;    _Qojón_     _qoġáne_   Delightful  house.    _Sáŋa nagaí_  _aiíla bĭké_         _qojón_   The ancients  make their presence  delightful;    _Qojón_     _qoġáne_   Delightful  house.  Immediately following this song, but in a much livelier measure, the following benedictory chant is sung:    _Cĭtsĭ´dje_  _qojógo_   Before me    may it be delightful;    _Cĭké¢e_   _qojógo_   Behind me  may it be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18214"],["title","Our Friend the Dog (#0)"],["body","[Illustration]  OUR FRIEND THE DOG  BY MAURICE MAETERLINCK  AUTHOR OF \"THE LIFE OF THE BEE,\" ETC.  TRANSLATED BY ALEXANDER TEIXEIRA DE MATTOS  ILLUSTRATED BY CECIL ALDEN   NEW YORK DODD, MEAD & COMPANY  1913  COPYRIGHT, 1903, BY THE CENTURY CO. COPYRIGHT, 1904, BY DODD, MEAD & COMPANY  Published, October, 1913     OUR FRIEND THE DOG  I   I have lost, within these last few days, a little bull-dog. He had just completed the sixth month of his brief existence. He had no history. His intelligent eyes opened to look out upon the world, to love mankind, then closed again on the cruel secrets of death.  The friend who presented me with him had given him, perhaps by antiphrasis, the startling name of Pelléas. Why rechristen him? For how can a poor dog, loving, devoted, faithful, disgrace the name of a man or an imaginary hero?  Pelléas had a great bulging, powerful forehead, like that of Socrates or Verlaine; and, under a little black nose, blunt as a churlish assent, a pair of large hanging and symmetrical chops, which made his head a sort of massive, obstinate, pensive and three-cornered menace. He was beautiful after the manner of a beautiful, natural monster that has complied strictly with the laws of its species. And what a smile of attentive obligingness, of incorruptible innocence, of affectionate submission, of boundless gratitude and total self-abandonment lit up, at the least caress, that adorable mask of ugliness! Whence exactly did that smile emanate? From the ingenuous and melting eyes? From the ears pricked up to catch the words of man? From the forehead that unwrinkled to appreciate and love, or from the stump of a tail that wriggled at the other end to testify to the intimate and impassioned joy that filled his small being, happy once more to encounter the hand or the glance of the god to whom he surrendered himself?  [Illustration]  Pelléas was born in Paris, and I had taken him to the country. His bonny fat paws, shapeless and not yet stiffened, carried slackly through the unexplored pathways of his new existence his huge and serious head, flat-nosed and, as it were, rendered heavy with thought.  For this thankless and rather sad head, like that of an overworked child, was beginning the overwhelming work that oppresses every brain at the start of life. He had, in less than five or six weeks, to get into his mind, taking shape within it, an image and a satisfactory conception of the universe. Man, aided by all the knowledge of his own elders and his brothers, takes thirty or forty years to outline that conception, but the humble dog has to unravel it for himself in a few days: and yet, in the eyes of a god, who should know all things, would it not have the same weight and the same value as our own?  It was a question, then, of studying the ground, which can be scratched and dug up and which sometimes reveals surprising things; of casting at the sky, which is uninteresting, for there is nothing there to eat, one glance that does away with it for good and all; of discovering the grass, the admirable and green grass, the springy and cool grass, a field for races and sports, a friendly and boundless bed, in which lies hidden the good and wholesome couch-grass. It was a question, also, of taking promiscuously a thousand urgent and curious observations. It was necessary, for instance, with no other guide than pain, to learn to calculate the height of objects from the top of which you can jump into space; to convince yourself that it is vain to pursue birds who fly away and that you are unable to clamber up trees after the cats who defy you there; to distinguish between the sunny spots where it is delicious to sleep and the patches of shade in which you shiver; to remark with stupefaction that the rain does not fall inside the houses, that water is cold, uninhabitable and dangerous, while fire is beneficent at a distance, but terrible when you come too near; to observe that the meadows, the farm-yards and sometimes the roads are haunted by giant creatures with threatening horns, creatures good-natured, perhaps, and, at any rate, silent, creatures who allow you to sniff at them a little curiously without taking offence, but who keep their real thoughts to themselves. It was necessary to learn, as the result of painful and humiliating experiment, that you are not at liberty to obey all nature's laws without distinction in the dwelling of the gods; to recognize that the kitchen is the privileged and most agreeable spot in that divine dwelling, although you are hardly allowed to abide in it because of the cook, who is a considerable, but jealous power; to learn that doors are important and capricious volitions, which sometimes lead to felicity, but which most often, hermetically closed, mute and stern, haughty and heartless, remain deaf to all entreaties; to admit, once and for all, that the essential good things of life, the indisputable blessings, generally imprisoned in pots and stewpans, are almost always inaccessible; to know how to look at them with laboriously-acquired indifference and to practise to take no notice of them, saying to yourself that here are objects which are probably sacred, since merely to skim them with the tip of a respectful tongue is enough to let loose the unanimous anger of all the gods of the house.  [Illustration]  And then, what is one to think of the table on which so many things happen that cannot be guessed; of the derisive chairs on which one is forbidden to sleep; of the plates and dishes that are empty by the time that one can get at them; of the lamp that drives away the dark?... How many orders, dangers, prohibitions, problems, enigmas has one not to classify in one's overburdened memory!... And how to reconcile all this with other laws, other enigmas, wider and more imperious, which one bears within one's self, within one's instinct, which spring up and develop from one hour to the other, which come from the depths of time and the race, invade the blood, the muscles and the nerves and suddenly assert themselves more irresistibly and more powerfully than pain, the word of the master himself, or the fear of death?  Thus, for instance, to quote only one example, when the hour of sleep has struck for men, you have retired to your hole, surrounded by the darkness, the silence and the formidable solitude of the night. All is sleep in the master's house. You feel yourself very small and weak in the presence of the mystery. You know that the gloom is peopled with foes who hover and lie in wait. You suspect the trees, the passing wind and the moonbeams. You would like to hide, to suppress yourself by holding your breath. But still the watch must be kept; you must, at the least sound, issue from your retreat, face the invisible and bluntly disturb the imposing silence of the earth, at the risk of bringing down the whispering evil or crime upon yourself alone. Whoever the enemy be, even if he be man, that is to say, the very brother of the god whom it is your business to defend, you must attack him blindly, fly at his throat, fasten your perhaps sacrilegious teeth into human flesh, disregard the spell of a hand and voice similar to those of your master, never be silent, never attempt to escape, never allow yourself to be tempted or bribed and, lost in the night without help, prolong the heroic alarm to your last breath.  There is the great ancestral duty, the essential duty, stronger than death, which not even man's will and anger are able to check. All our humble history, linked with that of the dog in our first struggles against every breathing thing, tends to prevent his forgetting it. And when, in our safer dwelling-places of to-day, we happen to punish him for his untimely zeal, he throws us a glance of astonished reproach, as though to point out to us that we are in the wrong and that, if we lose sight of the main clause in the treaty of alliance which he made with us at the time when we lived in caves, forests and fens, he continues faithful to it in spite of us and remains nearer to the eternal truth of life, which is full of snares and hostile forces.  But how much care and study are needed to succeed in fulfilling this duty! And how complicated it has become since the days of the silent caverns and the great deserted lakes! It was all so simple, then, so easy and so clear. The lonely hollow opened upon the side of the hill, and all that approached, all that moved on the horizon of the plains or woods, was the unmistakable enemy.... But to-day you can no longer tell.... You have to acquaint yourself with a civilization of which you disapprove, to appear to understand a thousand incomprehensible things.... Thus, it seems evident that henceforth the whole world no longer belongs to the master, that his property conforms to unintelligible limits.... It becomes necessary, therefore, first of all to know exactly where the sacred domain begins and ends. Whom are you to suffer, whom to stop?... There is the road by which every one, even the poor, has the right to pass. Why? You do not know; it is a fact which you deplore, but which you are bound to accept. Fortunately, on the other hand, here is the fair path which none may tread. This path is faithful to the sound traditions; it is not to be lost sight of; for by it enter into your daily existence the difficult problems of life.  Would you have an example? You are sleeping peacefully in a ray of the sun that covers the threshold of the kitchen with pearls. The earthenware pots are amusing themselves by elbowing and nudging one another on the edge of the shelves trimmed with paper lace-work. The copper stewpans play at scattering spots of light over the smooth white walls. The motherly stove hums a soft tune and dandles three saucepans blissfully dancing; and, from the little hole that lights up its inside, defies the good dog who cannot approach, by constantly putting out at him its fiery tongue.
