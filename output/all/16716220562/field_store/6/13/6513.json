But with the ocean and the beach, I doubt if you'll stay in this yard much.\"  \"Oh, that's so; I forgot the ocean! Come on, Father, let's go and look at it.\"  So the three went down to the beach, and Marjorie, who hadn't been to the seashore since she was a small child, plumped herself down on the sand, and just gazed out at the tumbling waves.  \"I don't care for the swings and things,\" she said. \"I just want to stay here all the time, and dig and dig and dig.\"  As she spoke she was digging her heels into the fine white sand, and poking her hands in, and burying her arms up to her dimpled elbows.  \"Oh, Father, isn't it gee-lorious! Sit down, won't you, and let us bury you in sand, all but your nose!\"  \"Not now,\" said Mr. Maynard, laughing. \"Some day you may, when I'm in a bathing suit. But I don't care for pockets full of sand. Now, I'm going back to home and Mother. You two may stay down here till luncheon time if you like.\"  Mr. Maynard went back to the house, and King and Marjorie continued their explorations. The beach was flat and smooth, and its white sand was full of shells, and here and there a few bits of seaweed, and farther on some driftwood, and in the distance a pier, built out far into the ocean.  \"Did you ever _see_ such a place?\" cried Marjorie, in sheer delight.  \"Well, I was at the seashore last year,\" said King, \"while you were at Grandma's.\"  \"But it wasn't as nice as this, was it? Say it wasn't!\"  \"No; the sand was browner. This is the nicest sand I ever saw. Say, Mops, let's build a fire.\"  \"What for? It isn't cold.\"  \"No, but you always build fires on the beach. It's lots of fun. And we'll roast potatoes in it.\"  \"All right. How do we begin?\"  \"Well, we gather a lot of wood first. Come on.\"  Marjorie came on, and they worked with a will, gathering armfuls of wood and piling it up near the spot they had selected for their fire.  \"That's enough,\" said Marjorie, for her arms ached as she laid down her last contribution to their collection.  \"You'll find it isn't much when it gets to burning. But never mind, it will make a start. I'll skin up to the house and get matches and potatoes.\"  \"I'll go with you, 'cause I think we'd better ask Father about making this fire. It might do some harm.\"  \"Fiddlesticks! We made a fire 'most every day last summer.\"  And, owing to King's knowledge and experience regarding beach fires, his father told him he might build one, and to be properly careful about not setting fire to themselves.  Then they procured potatoes and apples from the kitchen, and raced back to the beach.  \"Why, where's our wood?\" cried Marjorie.  Not a stick or a chip remained of their carefully gathered wood pile.  \"Some one has stolen it!\" said King.  \"No, there's nobody around, except those people over there, and they're grown-ups. It must have been washed away by a wave.\"  \"Pooh, the waves aren't coming up near as far as this.\"  \"Well, there might have been a big one.\"  \"No, it wasn't a wave. That wood was stolen, Mops!\"  \"But who could have done it? Those grown-up people wouldn't. You can see from their looks they wouldn't. They're reading aloud. And in the other direction, there are only some fishermen,--they wouldn't take it.\"  \"Well, somebody did. Look, here are lots of footprints, and I don't believe they're all ours.\"  Sure enough, on the smooth white sand they could see many footprints, imprinted all over each other, as if scurrying feet had trodden all around their precious wood pile.  \"Oh, King, you're just like a detective!\" cried Marjorie, in admiration. \"But it's so! These aren't our footprints!\"  She fitted her spring-heeled tan shoes into the prints, and proved at once that they were not hers. Nor did King's shoes fit exactly, though they came nearer to it than Marjorie's.  \"Yes, sir; some fellows came along and stole that wood. Here are two or three quite different prints.\"  \"Well, where do they lead to?\" said practical Marjorie.  \"That's so. Let's trace them and get the wood back.\"  But after leading away from them for a short distance the footprints became fainter, and in a softer bit of sand disappeared altogether.  \"Pshaw!\" said King. \"I don't so much care about the wood, but I hate to lose the trail like this. Let's hunt, Mopsy.\"  \"All right, but first, let's bury these apples and potatoes, or they'll be stolen, too.\"  \"Good idea!\" And they buried their treasures in the nice, clean sand, and marked the place with an inconspicuous stick.  Then they set out to hunt their lost wood. The beach, though flat and shelving at the water's edge, rose in a low bluff farther back, and this offered among its irregular projections many good hiding-places for their quarry.  And, sure enough, after some searching, they came suddenly upon three boys who sat, shaking with laughter, upon a pile of wood.  The two Maynards glared at them rather angrily, upon which the three again went off in peals of laughter.  \"That's our wood!\" began King, aggressively.  \"Sure it is!\" returned the biggest boy, still chuckling.  \"What did you bring it over here for?\"  \"Just for fun!\"  \"H'm, just for fun! And do you think it would be fun to carry it back again?\"  \"Yep; just's lieve as not. Come on, kids!\" And that remarkable boy began to pick up the sticks.  \"Oh, hold on,\" said King. \"If you're so willing, you needn't do it! Who are you, anyway?\"  \"Well,\" said the biggest boy, suddenly straightening himself up and bowing politely to Marjorie, \"we're your neighbors. We live in that green house next to yours. And we're named Tom, Dick, and Harry. Yes, I know you think those names sound funny, but they're ours all the same. Thomas, Richard, and Henry Craig,--at your service! I'm Tom. This is Dick, and this is Harry.\"  He whacked his brothers on the shoulder as he named them, and they ducked forward in polite, if awkward salutation.  \"And did you really take our wood?\" said Marjorie, with an accusing glance, as if surprised that such pleasant-spoken boys could do such a thing.  \"Yes, we did. We wanted to see what sort of stuff you were made of. You know Seacote people are sort of like one big family, and we wanted to know how you'd behave about the wood. You've been fine, and now we'll cart it back where we found it. If you had got mad about it, we wouldn't touch a stick to take it back,--would we, fellows?\"  \"Nope,\" said the other two, and the Maynards could see at once that Tom was the captain and ringleader of the trio.  \"Well,\" said King, judicially, \"if you hadn't been the sort you are, I _should_ have got mad. But I guess you're all right, and so you _may_ take it back. But we don't help you do it,--see? I'm Kingdon Maynard, and this is my sister Marjorie. You fellows took our wood, and now you're going to return it. Is that right?\"  \"Right-o!\" said Tom. \"Come on, fellows.\"  The three boys flew at it, and King and Midget sat on the sand and watched them till the wood was restored to its original position.  \"All right,\" said King; \"you boys'll do. Now, come on and roast potatoes with us.\"  Thus, all demands of honor having been complied with, the five proceeded to become friends. The boys built the fire, and gallantly let Marjorie have the fun of putting the potatoes and apples in place.  The Craig boys had nice instincts, and while they were rather rough-and-tumble among themselves, they treated King more decorously, and seemed to consider Marjorie as a being of a higher order, made to receive not only respect, but reverent homage.  \"You see, we never had a sister,\" said Tom; \"and we're a little bit scared of girls.\"  \"Well, I have three,\" said King, \"so you see I haven't such deep awe of them. But Midget won't hurt you, so don't be _too_ scared of her.\"  Marjorie smiled in most friendly fashion, for she liked these boys, and especially Tom.  \"How old are you?\" she asked him, in her frank, pleasant way.  \"I'm fourteen,\" replied Tom, \"and the other kids are twelve and ten.\"  \"King's fourteen,--'most fifteen,\" said Midget; \"and I'll be thirteen in July. So we're all in the same years. I wish our Kitty was here. She's nearly eleven, but she isn't any bigger than Harry.\"  Harry smiled shyly, and poked at the potatoes with a stick, not knowing quite what to say.  \"You see,\" King explained, \"Midget is the best sort of a girl there is. She's girly, all right, and yet she's as good as a boy at cutting up jinks or doing any old kind of stunts.\"  The three Craigs looked at Marjorie in speechless admiration.  \"I never knew that kind,\" said Tom, thoughtfully. \"You see, we go to a boys' school, and we haven't any girl cousins, or anything; and the only girls I ever see are at dancing class, or in a summer hotel, and then they're all frilled up, and sort of airy.\"  \"I love to play with boys,\" said Marjorie, frankly, \"and I guess we'll have a lot of fun this summer.\"  \"I guess we _will_! Are you going to stay all summer?\"  \"Yes, till September, when school begins.\"  \"So are we. Isn't it funny we live next door to each other?\"  \"Awful funny,\" agreed Marjorie, pulling a very black potato out of the red-hot embers. \"This is done,\" she went on, \"and I'm going to eat it.\"  \"So say we all of us,\" cried King. \"One done,--all done! Help yourselves, boys!\"  So they all pulled out the black, sooty potatoes, with more delighted anticipations than would have been roused by the daintiest dish served at a table.  \"Ow!\" cried Marjorie, flinging down her potato, and sticking her finger in her mouth. \"Ow! that old thing _popped_ open, and burned me awfully!\"  \"Too bad, Mops!\" said King, with genuine sympathy, but the Craig boys were more solicitous.  \"Oh, oh! I'm so sorry,\" cried Tom. \"Does it hurt _terribly_?\"  \"Yes, it does,\" said Midget, who was not in the habit of complaining when she got hurt, but who was really suffering from the sudden burn.  \"Let me tie it up,\" said Dick, shyly.  \"Yes, do,\" said Tom. \"Dick is our good boy. He always helps everybody else.\"  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18035"],["title","Marjorie at Seacote (#3)"],["body","\"But what can we tie it up with?\" said Marjorie. \"My handkerchief is all black from wiping off that potato.\"  \"I,--I've got a clean one,\" and Dick, blushing with embarrassment, took a neatly folded white square from his pocket.  \"Would you look at that!\" said Tom. \"I declare Dicky always has the right thing at the right time! Good for you, boy! Fix her up.\"  Quite deftly Dick wrapped the handkerchief round Marjorie's finger, and secured it with a bit of string from another pocket.  \"You ought to have something on it,\" he said, gravely. \"Kerosene is good, but as we haven't any, it will help it just to keep the air away from it, till you go home.\"  \"Goodness!\" exclaimed Midget. \"You talk like a doctor.\"  \"I'm going to be a doctor when I grow up,\" said Dick.  \"He is,\" volunteered Harry; \"he cured the cat's broken leg, and he mended a bird's wing once.\"  \"Yes, I did,\" admitted Dick, modestly blushing at his achievements. \"Are you going right home because of your finger?\"  \"No, indeed! We never stop for hurts and things, unless they're bad enough for us to go to bed. Give me another potato, and you open it for me, won't you, Dick?\"  \"Yep,\" and Marjorie was immediately supplied with the best of the potatoes and apples, carefully prepared for her use.  \"Aren't there any other girls in Seacote?\" she inquired.  \"There's Hester Corey,\" answered Tom; \"but we don't know her very well. She isn't nice, like you are. And I don't know of any others, though there may be some. Most of the people in the cottages haven't any children,--or else they're grown up,--big girls and young ladies. And there's a few little babies, but not many of our age. So that's why we're so glad you came.\"  \"And that's why you stole our wood!\"  \"Yes, truly. We thought that'd be a good way to test your temper.\"  \"It was a risky way,\" said King, thinking it over.  \"Oh, I don't know. I knew, if you were the right sort, you'd take it all right; and if you weren't the right sort, we didn't care how you took it.\"  \"That's so,\" agreed Marjorie.     CHAPTER III  THE SAND CLUB   Life at Seacote soon settled down to its groove, and it was a very pleasant groove. There was always plenty of fun to be had. Bathing every day in the crashing breakers, digging in the sand, building beach fires, talking to the old fishermen, were all delightful pursuits. And then there were long motor rides inland, basket picnics in pine groves, and excursions to nearby watering-places.  The Craig boys turned out to be jolly playfellows, and they and the Maynards became inseparable chums. Marjorie often wished one of them had been a girl, but at the same time, she enjoyed her unique position of being the only girl in the crowd. The boys deferred to her as to a princess, and she ruled them absolutely.  Of course the senior Craigs and Maynards became good friends also, and the two ladies especially spent many pleasant hours together.  Baby Rosamond rarely played with the older children, as she was too little to join in their vigorous games, often original with themselves, and decidedly energetic. The beach was their favorite playground. They never tired of digging in the sand, and they had a multitude of spades and shovels and hoes for their various sand performances. Some days they built a fort, other days a castle or a pleasure ground. Their sand-works were extensive and elaborate, and it often seemed a pity that the tide or the wind should destroy them over night.  \"I say, let's us be a Sand Club,\" said Tom one day. \"We're always playing in the sand, you know.\"  \"All right,\" said Marjorie, instantly seeing delightful possibilities. \"We'll call ourselves Sand Crabs, for we're always scrambling through the sand.\"  \"And we're jolly as sandboys!\" said King. \"I don't know what sandboys really are, but they're always jolly, and so are we.\"  \"I'd like something more gay and festive,\" Marjorie put in; \"I mean like Court Life, or something where we could dress up, and pretend things.\"  \"I know what you mean,\" said Dick, grasping her idea. \"Let's have Sand Court, and build a court and a throne, and we'll all be royal people and Marjorie can be queen.\"  \"Well, let's all have sandy names,\" suggested Tom. \"Marjorie can be Queen Sandy. And we'll call our court Sandringham Palace. You know there is one, really.\"  \"You can be the Grand Sandjandrum!\" said King, laughing.  \"No, you be that,\" said Tom, unselfishly.  \"No, sir; _you've_ got to. I'll be a sand piper, and play the court anthems.\"  \"All right,\" said Marjorie, \"and Harry can be a sand crab, for he just scuttles through the sand all the time. What'll Dick be?\"  King looked at Dick. \"We'll call him Sandow,\" he suggested, and they all laughed, for Dick was a frail little chap, without much muscular strength. But the name stuck to him, and they always called him Sandow thereafter.  \"I wish we could make our palace where it would stay made,\" said Marjorie. \"We don't want to make a new one every day.\"  \"That's so,\" said Tom. \"If we only could find a secret haunt.\"  \"I know a kind of a one,\" said Dick; \"'way back in our yard, near where it joins yours, is a deepy kind of a place, and it's quite sandy.\"  \"Just the thing!\" cried Marjorie. \"I know that place. Come on!\"  She was off like a deer, and the rest followed. A few moments' scamper brought them to the place, and all declared it was just the very spot for a palace.  \"I'd like beach sand better, though,\" said Marjorie.  \"We'll bring all you want,\" declared Tom. \"We'll take a wheelbarrow, and bring heaps up from the beach.\"  The Sand Club worked for days getting their palace in order. The two big boys wheeled many loads of sand up from the beach, and Marjorie and the two other boys arranged it in shape.  Dick was clever at building, and he planned a number of fine effects. Of course, their palace had no roof or walls, but the apartments were partitioned off with low walls of sand, and there were sand sofas and chairs, and a gorgeous throne.  The throne was a heap of sand, surmounted by a legless armchair, found in the Craigs' attic, and at court meetings draped with pink cheesecloth and garlands of flowers. The whole palace was really a \"secret haunt,\" for a slight rise of ground screened it from view on two sides and trees shaded the other side.  The parents of both families were pleased with the whole scheme, for it kept the children occupied, and they could always be found at a moment's notice.  Sand tables were built, and on them were bits of old dishes and broken vases, all of which were desirable because they could stay out in the rain and not be harmed. Moreover, they were handy in case of a feast. At last preparations were complete and they decided to open the court next day.  \"We must have a flag,\" said Marjorie. \"I'll make it. The court colors are red and yellow, and our emblem will be,--what shall our emblem be?\"  \"A pail of sand,\" suggested Tom.  \"Yes; I can cut out a pail of red flannel, and sew it on to a yellow flag. I'll make that this afternoon, and we'll hold court to-morrow morning at ten o'clock. We must all wear some red and yellow. Sashes will do for you boys, and I'll have,--well, I'll fix up a rig of some kind.\"  Marjorie was a diligent little worker when she chose to be, and that afternoon she made a very creditable flag, showing a pail, red; on a field, yellow. She made also sashes for them all, of red and yellow cheesecloth, and she made herself a court train of the same material, which trailed grandly from her shoulders.  Next morning the Sand Club assembled on the Maynards' veranda, to march to Sandringham Palace.  Mrs. Craig had helped out the costumes of her royal children, and the Grand Sandjandrum was gorgeous in a voluminous yellow turban, with a red cockade sticking up on one side.  Sandow and the Sand Crab had soldier hats made of red and yellow paper, and big sailor collars of the same colors.  The Sand Piper wore his sash jauntily with a huge shoulder knot, and he, too, had a cockaded headgear.  Marjorie, as Queen Sandy, wore her trailing court robe and a crown of yellow paper with red stars on it. She had a sceptre, and Sandow carried the flag.  The Sand Piper marched ahead, playing on a tuneful instrument known as a kazoo. Next came the Grand Sandjandrum, then the Queen, then the Sand Crab, and finally, Sandow with the flag.  Slowly and with great dignity the procession filed out toward the palace. King was playing the Star Spangled Banner, or thought he was. It sounded almost as much like Hail Columbia,--but it didn't really matter, and they're both difficult tunes, anyway.  Blithely they stepped along, and prepared to enter the palace with a flourish of trumpets, as it were, when King's music stopped suddenly.  \"Great Golliwogs!\" he cried. \"Look at that!\"  \"Look at what?\" said Tom, who was absorbed in the grand march.  But he looked, and they all looked, and five angry exclamations sounded as they saw only the ruins of the beloved Sandringham Palace.  Somebody had utterly demolished it. The low walls were broken and scattered, the sand tables and chairs were torn down, and the throne was entirely upset.  \"Who did this?\" roared Tom.  But as nobody knew the answer, there was no reply.  \"It couldn't have been any of your servants, could it?\" asked King of the Craigs. \"I know it wasn't any of ours.\"  \"No; it wasn't ours, either,\" said Tom. \"Could it have been your little sister?\"  \"Mercy, no!\" cried Marjorie. \"Rosy Posy isn't that sort of a child. Oh, I do think it's awful!\" and forgetting her royal dignity, Queen Sandy began to cry.  \"Why, Mops,\" said King, kindly; \"brace up, old girl. Don't cry.\"  \"I'm not a cry baby,\" said Midget, smiling through her tears. \"I'm just crying 'cause I'm so _mad_! I'm mad clear through! How _could_ anybody be so ugly?\"  \"I'm mad, too,\" declared Tom, slowly, \"but I know who did it, and it's partly my fault, I s'pose.\"  \"Your fault!\" exclaimed Midget. \"Why, Tom, how can it be?\"  \"Well, you see it was this way.
