THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.  BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  1. Definitions     1. \"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue,       anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in       unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,       constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are       assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a       Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as       defined below) for the purposes of this License.     2. \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the       Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical       arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture       version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,       condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,       transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a       Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the       purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the       Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the       synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image       (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose       of this License.     3. \"Developing Nation\" means any nation that is not classified as a       \"high-income enconomy\" by the World Bank.     4. \"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work       under the terms of this License.     5. \"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the       Work.     6. \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under       the terms of this License.  7. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License    with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from    the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous    violation.  2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,    limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or    other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner    under copyright law or other applicable laws.  3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,    Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright or subject to    Section 7(a)) license to exercise the rights in the Work, in any    Developing Nation, solely within the geographic territory of one or    more Developing Nations, as stated below:     1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more       Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the       Collective Works;     2. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;     3. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform       publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio       transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective       Works;     4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform       publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio       transmission Derivative Works;     5.        For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical       composition:           1. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor             waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually             or via a performance rights society, royalties for the             public performance or public digital performance             (e.g. webcast) of the Work.           2. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives             the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via             a music rights agency or designated agent, royalties for any             phonorecord You create from the Work (\"cover version\") and             distribute, subject to any compulsory license that may             apply.     6. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of       doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the       exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a       performance-rights society, royalties for the public digital       performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to any compulsory       license that may apply.  The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights and restrictions described in Section 4.  4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly    made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:     1. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or       publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this       License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource       Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the       Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or       publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms       on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or       the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may       not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that       refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may       not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly       digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that       control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with       the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work       as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require       the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject       to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18224"],["title","Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town (#3)"],["body","terms of this License.

If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly       digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective       Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and       give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means       You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if       applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the       Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the       Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be       associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the       copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, in       the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the       Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work       by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by       Original Author\"). Such credit may be implemented in any       reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a       Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will       appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in       a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship       credit.     3. The Work and any Derivative Works and Collective Works may only be       exported to other Developing Nations, but may not be exported to       countries classified as \"high income\" by the World Bank.     4. This License does not authorize making the Work, any Derivative       Works or any Collective Works publicly available on the Internet       unless reasonable measures are undertaken to verify that the       recipient is located in a Developing Nation, such as by requiring       recipients to provide name and postal mailing address, or by       limiting the distribution of the Work to Internet IP addresses       within a Developing Nation.  5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer  UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE    LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY    FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF    LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  7. Termination     1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate       automatically upon (i) any breach by You of the terms of this       License or (ii) if any Developing Nation in which the Work is       used, exported or distributed ceases at any time to qualify as a       Developing Nation, in which case this License will automatically       terminate with respect to such country five (5) years after the       date of such re-classification; provided that You will not be       liable for copyright infringement unless and until You continue to       exercise such rights after You have actual knowledge of the       termination of this License for such country. Individuals or       entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works       from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses       terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full       compliance with those licenses.

I got lucky both times.  ========= The novel =========  Alan sanded the house on Wales Avenue. It took six months, and the whole time it was the smell of the sawdust, ancient and sweet, and the reek of chemical stripper and the damp smell of rusting steel wool.  Alan took possession of the house on January 1, and paid for it in full by means of an e-gold transfer. He had to do a fair bit of hand-holding with the realtor to get her set up and running on e-gold, but he loved to do that sort of thing, loved to sit at the elbow of a novitiate and guide her through the clicks and taps and forms. He loved to break off for impromptu lectures on the underlying principles of the transaction, and so he treated the poor realtor lady to a dozen addresses on the nature of international currency markets, the value of precious metal as a kind of financial lingua franca to which any currency could be converted, the poetry of vault shelves in a hundred banks around the world piled with the heaviest of metals, glinting dully in the fluorescent tube lighting, tended by gnomish bankers who spoke a hundred languages but communicated with one another by means of this universal tongue of weights and measures and purity.  The clerks who'd tended Alan's many stores -- the used clothing store in the Beaches, the used book-store in the Annex, the collectible tin-toy store in Yorkville, the antique shop on Queen Street -- had both benefited from and had their patience tried by Alan's discursive nature. Alan had pretended never to notice the surreptitious rolling of eyes and twirling fingers aimed templewise among his employees when he got himself warmed up to a good oration, but in truth very little ever escaped his attention. His customers loved his little talks, loved the way he could wax rhapsodic about the tortured prose in a Victorian potboiler, the nearly erotic curve of a beat-up old table leg, the voluminous cuffs of an embroidered silk smoking jacket. The clerks who listened to Alan's lectures went on to open their own stores all about town, and by and large, they did very well.  He'd put the word out when he bought the house on Wales Avenue to all his protégés: Wooden bookcases! His cell-phone rang every day, bringing news of another wooden bookcase found at this flea market, that thrift store, this rummage sale or estate auction.  He had a man he used part-time, Tony, who ran a small man-with-van service, and when the phone rang, he'd send Tony over to his protégé's shop with his big panel van to pick up the case and deliver it to the cellar of the house on Wales Avenue, which was ramified by cold storages, root cellars, disused coal chutes and storm cellars. By the time Alan had finished with his sanding, every nook and cranny of the cellar was packed with wooden bookcases of every size and description and repair.  Alan worked through the long Toronto winter at his sanding. The house had been gutted by the previous owners, who'd had big plans for the building but had been tempted away by a job in Boston. They'd had to sell fast, and no amount of realtor magic -- "]]]
