Maybe some girl is wearing your Distinguished Service Cross, for all I know. But we fellows are crazy to have the Eagle award in our troop. I suppose of course you're an Eagle Scout?\"  \"I guess that was about three or four years ago,\" Tom said.  \"Once a scout, always a scout, hey?\"  \"That's it,\" Tom said.  They strolled along in silence for a few minutes, Hervey occasionally stealing a side glimpse at his elder, who ambled on, apparently unconscious of these admiring glances. Now and again Tom paused to examine a patch of moss or some little tell-tale mark upon the ground, as if he had no knowledge of his companion's presence. But Hervey appeared quite satisfied.  \"I'll tell you how it is,\" he finally said, selecting what seemed an appropriate moment to speak; \"I was elected as the one in our troop to go after the Eagle award. We want an Eagle Scout in our troop. We haven't even got one in the city where I live.\"  \"Hear that?\" Tom said. \"That's a thrush.\"  \"A thrush?\"  \"Yop; go on,\" Tom said.  \"So they elected me to win the Eagle award. Some choice, hey? I had seven badges to begin with; maybe that's why they wished it onto me. I had camping, cooking, athletics, pioneering, angling, that's a cinch, that's easy, and, let's see--carpentry and bugling. That's the easiest one of the lot, just blow through the cornet and claim the badge. It's a shame to take it.\"  \"You mean you've won thirteen more since you've been here?\" Tom asked.  \"That's it,\" said Hervey. \"First I got my fists on the eleven that have _got_ to be included in the twenty-one, and then I made up a list of ten others and went to it. I chose easy ones, but some of them didn't turn out to be so easy. Music--oh, boy! And when I started to play the piano, they said I wasn't playing at all, but that I really meant it. Can you beat that?\"  Tom could not help smiling.  \"So you see I've been pretty busy since I've been here, too busy to talk to interviewers, hey? I've piled up thirteen since I've been here; that's a little over six weeks. That isn't so bad, is it?\"  \"It's good,\" Tom said, by no means carried away by enthusiasm.  \"I thought you'd say so. So now I've got twenty and I know them all by heart. Want to hear me stand up in front of the class and say them?\"  \"All right,\" Tom said.  \"No sooner said than stung,\" Hervey flung back at him. \"Well, I've got first aid, physical development, life saving, personal health, public health, cooking, camping, bird study----\"  \"That's a good one,\" Tom said.  \"You said it; and I've got pioneering, pathfinding, athletics, and then come the ten that I selected myself; angling, bugling, carpentry, conservation or whatever you call it, and cycling and firemanship and music hath charms, not, and seamanship and signaling. And two-thirds of the stalking badge. I bet you'll say that's a good one.\"  \"There's one good one that you left out,\" Tom said. \"I thought you'd think of it on account of that last one.\"  \"You mean stalking?\"  \"I mean another that has something to do with that?\"  \"Now you've got me guessing,\" Hervey said.  \"Well, how do you want me to help you?\" Tom asked, thus stifling his companion's inquisitiveness.  \"Well,\" said Hervey, ready, even eager to adapt himself to Tom's mood, \"all I've got to do is to track an animal for a half a mile or so----\"  \"A quarter of a mile,\" Tom said.  \"And then I'm an Eagle Scout,\" Hervey concluded. \"But if I want to be in on the hand-outs Saturday night, I've got to do it between now and Saturday, and that's what has me worried. I want to go home from here an Eagle Scout. Gee, I don't want all my work to go for nothing.\"  \"You want what you want when you want it, don't you?\" Tom said, smiling a little.  \"It's on account of my troop, too,\" Hervey said. \"It isn't just myself that I'm thinking about. Jiminies, maybe I didn't choose the best ones, you know more about the handbook than I do, that's sure, and I suppose that one badge was just as easy as another to _you_. Maybe you think I just chose easy ones, hey?\"  \"Well, what's on your mind?\" Tom said.  \"Do you know where there are any wild animal tracks?\" Hervey blurted out with amusing simplicity. \"I don't mean just exactly where, but do you know a good place to hunt for any? A couple of fellows told me you would know, because you know everything of that sort. So I thought maybe you could give me a tip where to look. I found a horseshoe last night so maybe I'll be lucky. All I want is to get started on a trail.\"  \"Sometimes there are different trails and they take you to the same place,\" Tom said.  No doubt this was one of the sort of remarks that Tom was famous for making which had either no particular meaning or a meaning poorly expressed.  Hervey stared at him for a few seconds, then said, \"I don't care whether it's easy or hard, if that's what you mean. Is it true that there are wild cats up in these mountains?\"  \"Some,\" Tom said.  \"Well, if you were in my place, where would you go to look for a trail? I mean a real trail, not a cow or a horse or Chocolate Drop's kitten. [Chocolate Drop was the negro cook at Temple Camp.] If I can just dig up the trail of a wild animal somewhere, right away quick, the Eagle award is mine--ours. See? Can you give me a tip?\"  Tom's answer was characteristic of him and it was not altogether satisfactory.  \"I'm not so stuck on eagles,\" he said.     CHAPTER V  WHAT'S IN A NAME?   \"_You're not?_\" Hervey asked in puzzled dismay. \"You can bet that every time I look at that little old gold eagle on top of the flag pole I say, 'Me for you, kiddo.'\"  \"I like Star Scout better,\" Tom said, unmoved by his companion's consternation.  \"Why, that means only ten merit badges,\" Hervey said.  \"It's fun studying the stars,\" Tom added.  \"Oh, sure,\" Hervey agreed. \"But star and eagle, they're just names. What's in a name, hey? Is that the badge you meant that I forgot about? The astronomy badge?\"  \"No, it isn't,\" Tom said. \"You're too excitable to study the stars. It's got to be something livelier.\"  \"You've got me down pat, that's sure,\" Hervey laughed.  Tom smiled, too. \"Well, you want the Eagle badge, do you?\" he said.  \"You seem to think it doesn't amount to much,\" Hervey complained.  \"I think it amounts to a whole lot,\" Tom said.  \"When I get my mind on a thing----\" Hervey announced.  \"That's the trouble with you,\" Tom said.  \"There you go,\" Hervey shot back at him; \"you've been through the game and walked away with every honor in the book, and you know the book by heart and you can track with your eyes shut and you've been to France and all that and you think I'm just a kid, but it means something to be an Eagle Scout, I can tell you.\"  Doubtless Tom Slade, scout, was gratified to receive this valuable information. \"And there's just the one way to get there, is that it?\" he answered quietly, but smiling a little. \"I always heard that a scout was resourceful and had two strings to his bow.\"  \"You just give me a tip and I'll do the rest,\" said Hervey.  \"It must be about tracking, hey?\"  \"That's it; test three for the stalking badge. _Track an animal a quarter of a mile._\"  \"Well, let me think a minute, then,\" Tom said.  \"Up on that mountain, maybe, hey?\" Hervey urged.  \"Maybe,\" Tom said.  So they ambled along, the elder quite calm and thoroughly master of himself, the younger, all impulse, eagerness and enthusiasm. His generous admiration of Tom, amounting almost to a spirit of worship, was plainly to be seen. It would have been hard to say how Tom felt or what he thought. At all events he had not been jostled out of his stolid calm.  \"Did you ever hear any one say that there is more than one way to kill a cat?\" he finally inquired, pausing to notice some bird or squirrel among the trees.  \"I don't want to kill a cat,\" Hervey said. \"I want to find some tracks, I----\"  \"You want to be an Eagle Scout,\" Tom concluded; \"and you've got your mind set on it. That it?\"  \"That's it; but it's for the sake of my troop, too.\"  Still again, they strolled on in silence. A little twig cracked under Tom's foot, the crackle sounding clear in the solemn stillness. Some feathered creature chirped complainingly at the rude intrusion of its domain by these strangers. And, almost under their very feet, a tiny snake wriggled across the trail and was gone. The shadows were gathering now, and the fragrance of evening was beginning to permeate the dim woods. And all the respectable home-loving birds were seeking their nests.  And so these two strolled on, and for a few minutes neither spoke.  \"Well then, suppose I give you a tip,\" Tom said. \"Will you promise that you'll make good? You claim to be a scout. You say that when you get your mind set on a thing, nothing can stop you. That the idea?\"  \"That's it,\" Hervey answered.  \"You wouldn't drop a trail after you once picked it up, would you? Some animals take you pretty far.\"  \"You bet nothing would stop _me_ if I once got the tracks,\" Hervey said. \"I wouldn't care if they took me across the Desert of Sahara or over the Rocky Mountains.\"  \"Hang on like a bulldog, hey?\" Tom said.  \"That's me,\" said Hervey.  \"All right, it's a go,\" Tom concluded. \"I'll see if I can give you a pointer or two down near camp in the morning. Ever follow a woodchuck--or a coon? Only I don't want any badge-getter falling down on a trail, if I'm mixed up with it. That's one thing I can't stand--a quitter.\"  \"I wouldn't anyway,\" Hervey said with great fervor; \"but as long as I've got you and what you said to think about, you can bet your sweet life that not even a--a--a jungle would stop me--it wouldn't.\"  \"That's the kind of a fellow they want for an Eagle Scout,\" Tom said; \"do or die.\"  \"That's me,\" said Hervey Willetts. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18180"],["title","Tom Slade on Mystery Trail (#3)"],["body","    CHAPTER VI  THE EAGLE AND THE SCOUT   And so these two strolled on. And presently they came to a point where the wood was more sparse, for they were approaching the rugged lower ledges of a mighty mountain, and the last rays of the dying sun fell upon the rocks and scantier vegetation of this clearer area, emphasizing the solemn darkness of the wooded ascent beyond.  Few, even of the scouts, had ever penetrated the enshrouding wilderness of that dizzy, forbidding height. There were strange tales, usually told to tenderfeet around the camp-fire, of mysterious hermits and ferocious bears and half-savage men who lurked high up in those all but inaccessible fastnesses, but no scout from Temple Camp had ever ascended beyond the lower reaches of that frowning old monarch.  At Temple Camp, when the cheery blaze was crackling in the witching hour of yarn telling, the seasoned habitués of the camp would direct the eye of the newcomer to a little glint of light high up upon the mountain, and edify him with dark tales of a lonesome draft dodger who had challenged that tangled profusion of tree and brush to escape going to war and had never been able to find his way down again--a quite just punishment for his cowardice. But time and again this freakish glint of light had been proven to be the reflection of that very camp-fire upon a huge rock lodged up there and held by interlacing roots.  Tom and Hervey stood upon a ledge of rock just outside the area of a great elm tree, and as they looked down and afar off, Black Lake seemed a mere puddle with toy cabins near it.  \"I bet there are wild animals up there,\" Hervey said.  \"Here's one of them now,\" commented Tom, pointing upward.  High above them in the dusk and with a background of golden-edged clouds, which gave the sun's last parting message to the earth, a great bird hovered motionless. It seemed to hang in air as if by a thread. Then it descended with a wide, circling swoop. In less than ten seconds, as it seemed to Hervey, its body and great wings, and even its curved, cruel beak, were plainly visible circling a few yards above the tree. It seemed like a journey from the heavens to the earth, all in an instant.  \"Watch him, watch him,\" Hervey whispered.  But Tom was not watching him at all. He knew what that savage descent meant and he was looking for its cause. Stealthily, with no more sound than that of a gliding canoe, he stole to the trunk of the tree and looked about with quick, short, scrutinizing glances, away up among its branches.  Then he placed his finger to his lips, warning Hervey to silence, and beckoned him into the darker shadow under the great tree.  \"Did you see anything beside the bird?\" he whispered.  \"No,\" said Hervey. \"Why? What is it?\"  \"Shh,\" Tom said; \"look up--shh----\"  It was the most fateful moment of all Hervey Willetts' scout career, and he did not know it.     CHAPTER VII  THE STREAK OF RED   \"Look up there,\" Tom said; \"out near the end of the third branch. See? The little codger beat him to it.\"  Looking up, Hervey saw amid the thicker foliage, far removed from the stately trunk, something hanging from a leaf-covered branch. Even as he looked at it, it seemed to be swaying as if from a recent jolt. At first glimpse he thought it was a bat hanging there.  \"See it?\" Tom said, pointing up. \"You can see it by the little streak of red. I think the little codgers head is poking out. Some scare she had.\"  Then all in an instant Hervey knew. It seemed incredible that the great bird, hovering at that dizzy height, could have seen the little songster of the woods which even he and Tom had failed to see. And the thought of that smaller bird reaching its home just in time, and poking its head out of the opening to see if all was well, went to Hervey's heart and stirred a sudden anger within him.  \"I didn't know they could see all that distance,\" he said.  \"Well, that's one thing you've learned that you didn't know before,\" Tom said in his matter-of-fact way.  Scarcely had he spoken the words when the foliage above shook and there was a loud rustling and crackling of branches, while many leaves and twigs fell to the ground.  The monarch of the mountain crags, having circled the elm, had found a way in where the foliage was least dense, and had thus with irresistible power carried the outer defenses of that little hanging citadel.  And still the little streak of red showed up there in the dimness of those invaded branches, and one might have fancied it to be the colors of the besieged victim, flaunting still in a kind of hopeless defiance. Down out of the green twilight above floated a feather, then another--trifling losses of the conqueror in his triumphal entry.  \"You're not going to get away with that,\" said Hervey in a voice tense with wrath and grim determination; \"you're--you're--not----\"  What happened then happened so quickly as almost to rival the descent of the destroyer in lightning movement. Before Tom Slade realized what had happened, there was Hervey's khaki jacket on the ground, his discarded hat was blowing away, and his navy blue scout scarf was plastered by the freshening breeze flat against the trunk of the tree.  Hervey Willetts, who had dreamed and striven all through the vacation season of \"capturing the Eagle,\" as they say, was on his quest in dead earnest.     CHAPTER VIII  EAGLE AND SCOUT   Up, up, he went, now reaching like a monkey, now wriggling like a snake. Now he loosed one hand to sweep back the hair which fell over his forehead. Again, unable to release his hold, he threw his head back to shake away the annoying locks. Tom Slade, stolid though he was, watched him, thrilled with amazement and admiration.  The great bird was embarrassed in the confines of the foliage by its big wings. But the freedom and strength of its cruel beak and talons were unimpaired and every second brought it nearer to the hanging nest.  But every second brought also the scout nearer to the hanging nest. Up, up he went, now straddling some bending limb, now swinging himself with lightning agility to one above. Once, crawling on a horizontal branch, he slid over and hung beneath it, like an opossum.  Twisting and wriggling his way out of this predicament, he scrambled on, handing himself from branch to branch, and once losing his foothold and hanging by one hand.  Tom Slade watched spellbound, as the agile form ascended, using every physical device and disregarding every danger. More than once Tom almost shuddered at the chances which his young companion took upon some perilously slender limb. Once, the impulse seized him to call a warning, but he refrained from a kind of inspired confidence in that young dare-devil who by now seemed a mere speck of brown moving in and out of the darkened green above him. Once he was on the point of shouting advice to Hervey about what to do in the unlikely event of his reaching the nest before the eagle, or in the more serious contingency of an encounter with that armed warrior.  For, thrilled as he was at the young scout's agility and fine abandon, he was yet doubtful of Hervey's power of deliberation and presence of mind. But no one could advise a creature capable of being carried away in a very frenzy of nervous enthusiasm, and Tom, sober and sensible, knew this. Hervey Willetts would do this thing or crash his brains out, one or the other, and no one could help or hinder him.  Amid the crackling sound of breaking limbs and a shower of leaves and smaller twigs, the mighty bird of prey, extricating himself from every obstacle, tore his way into the leafy recess where his little victim waited, trembling. Every branch seemed agitated by his ruthless, irresistible advance, and the hanging nest swayed upon its slender branch, as the cruel talons of the intruder fixed themselves in the yielding bark. The weight of the monster bird upon the very branch which his little victim had chosen for a home caused it to bend almost to the breaking point, and the hanging nest, agitated by the shock, swung low near the end of the curving bough.  [Illustration: HERVEY SAVES THE LITTLE BIRD FROM THE EAGLE.  _Tom Slade on Mystery Trail. Page_ 42]  That was bad strategy on the part of the invader. As the end of the bough descended under his weight, there was the appalling sound of a splitting branch, which made Tom Slade's blood run cold, and he held his breath in frightful suspense, expecting to see the form of his young friend come crashing to earth.  But the boy who had ventured out so far upon that straining branch had swung free of it just in time, and was swinging from the branch above. The great bird had played into the hands of his dexterous enemy when he had placed his weight upon the branch above, from which the nest hung.  Hervey could not have trusted his own weight upon that upper branch, and he knew it. But even had he dared to do this he could not have passed the enraged bird who stood guard within a yard or two of his little victim. When the weight of the bird's great body bent the branch down, Hervey, close in toward the trunk just below, saw his chance. He did not see the danger.  Scrambling out upon that slender branch, he moved cautiously but with beating heart, out to a point where the bending branch above was within his reach. If the eagle had left the branch above, that branch would have swung out of Hervey's reach and he would have gone crashing to the ground when his own branch broke. He knew that branch must break under him. He knew, he _must_ have known, that the chances were at least even that the eagle would desert the branch above in either assault or flight.  Hervey's chance was the chance of a moment, and it lay just in this: in getting far enough out on the branch before it broke to catch the branch above before it sprang up and away from him. Also he must trust to the slightly heavier branch above not breaking.  It would be impossible to say by what a narrow squeak he saved himself in this"]]]
