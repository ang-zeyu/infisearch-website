The year that Radisson escaped from the Mohawks, Jesuit priests had gone among them.  A still greater change that was to affect his life more vitally had taken place in the Radisson family.  The year that Radisson had been captured, the outraged people of Three Rivers had seized a Mohawk chief and burned him to death.  In revenge, the Mohawks murdered the governor of Three Rivers and a company of Frenchmen.  Among the slain was the husband of Radisson's sister, Marguerite.  When Radisson returned, he found that his widowed sister had married Médard Chouart Groseillers, a famous fur trader of New France, who had passed his youth as a lay helper to the Jesuit missions of Lake Huron.[2]  Radisson was now doubly bound to the Jesuits by gratitude and family ties.  Never did pagan heart hear an evangel more gladly than the Mohawks heard the Jesuits.  The priests were welcomed with acclaim, led to the Council Lodge, and presented with belts of wampum.  Not a suspicion of foul play seems to have entered the Jesuits' mind.  When the Iroquois proposed to incorporate into the Confederacy the remnants of the Hurons, the Jesuits discerned nothing in the plan but the most excellent means to convert pagan Iroquois by Christian Hurons.  Having gained an inch, the Iroquois demanded the proverbial ell.  They asked that a French settlement be made in the Iroquois country.  The Indians wanted a supply of firearms to war against all enemies; and with a French settlement miles away from help, the Iroquois could wage what war they pleased against the Algonquins without fear of reprisals from Quebec--the settlement of white men among hostiles would be hostage of generous treatment from New France. Of these designs, neither priests nor governor had the slightest suspicion.  The Jesuits were thinking only of the Iroquois' soul; the French, of peace with the Iroquois at any cost.  In 1656 Major Dupuis and fifty Frenchmen had established a French colony among the Iroquois.[3]  The hardships of these pioneers form no part of Radisson's life, and are, therefore, not set down here.  Peace not bought by a victory is an unstable foundation for Indian treaty. The Mohawks were jealous that their confederates, the Onondagas, had obtained the French settlement.  In 1657, eighty Iroquois came to Quebec to escort one hundred Huron refugees back to Onondaga for adoption into the Confederacy.  These Hurons were Christians, and the two Jesuits, Paul Ragueneau and François du Péron, were appointed to accompany them to their new abode.  Twenty young Frenchmen joined the party to seek their fortunes at the new settlement; but a man was needed who could speak Iroquois.  Glad to repay his debt to the Jesuits, young Radisson volunteered to go as a _donné_, that is, a lay helper vowed to gratuitous services.  It was midsummer before all preparations had been made.  On July 26, the party of two hundred, made up of twenty Frenchmen, eighty Iroquois, and a hundred Hurons, filed out of the gates of Montreal, and winding round the foot of the mountain followed a trail through the forest that took them past the Lachine Rapids.  The Onondaga _voyageurs_ carried the long birch canoes inverted on their shoulders, two Indians at each end; and the other Iroquois trotted over the rocks with the Frenchmen's baggage on their backs.  The day was hot, the _portage_ long and slippery with dank moisture.  The Huron children fagged and fell behind.  At nightfall, thirty of the haughty Iroquois lost patience, and throwing down their bundles made off for Quebec with the avowed purpose of raiding the Algonquins.  On the way, they paused to scalp three Frenchmen at Montreal, cynically explaining that if the French persisted in taking Algonquins into their arms, the white men need not be surprised if the blow aimed at an Algonquin sometimes struck a Frenchman.  That act opened the eyes of the French to the real meaning of the peace made with the Iroquois; but the little colony was beyond recall.  To insure the safety of the French among the Onondagas, the French governor at Quebec seized a dozen Iroquois and kept them as hostages of good conduct.  Meanwhile, all was confusion on Lake St. Louis, where the last band of colonists had encamped.  The Iroquois had cast the Frenchmen's baggage on the rocks and refused to carry it farther.  Leaving the whites all embarrassed, the Onondagas hurriedly embarked the Hurons and paddled quickly out of sight.  The act was too suddenly unanimous not to have been premeditated.  Why had the Iroquois carried the Hurons away from the Frenchmen?  Father Ragueneau at once suspected some sinister purpose.  Taking only a single sack of flour for food, he called for volunteers among the twenty Frenchmen to embark in a leaky, old canoe and follow the treacherous Onondagas.  Young Radisson was one of the first to offer himself.  Six others followed his example; and the seven Frenchmen led by the priest struck across the lake, leaving the others to gather up the scattered baggage.  The Onondagas were too deep to reveal their plots with seven armed Frenchmen in pursuit.  The Indians permitted the French boats to come up with the main band.  All camped together in the most friendly fashion that night; but the next morning one Iroquois offered passage in his canoe to one Frenchman, another Iroquois to another of the whites, and by the third day, when they came to Lake St. Francis, the old canoe had been abandoned.  The French were scattered promiscuously among the Iroquois, with no two whites in one boat.  The Hurons were quicker to read the signs of treachery than the French.  There were rumors of one hundred Mohawks lying in ambush at the Thousand Islands to massacre the coming Hurons.  On the morning of August 3 four Huron warriors and two women seized a canoe, and to the great astonishment of the encampment launched out before they could be stopped.  Heading the canoe back for Montreal, they broke out in a war chant of defiance to the Iroquois.  The Onondagas made no sign, but they evidently took council to delay no longer.  Again, when they embarked, they allowed no two whites in one canoe.  The boats spread out.  Nothing was said to indicate anything unusual.  The lake lay like a silver mirror in the August sun.  The water was so clear that the Indians frequently paused to spear fish lying below on the stones.  At places the canoes skirted close to the wood-fringed shore, and braves landed to shoot wild-fowl.  Radisson and Ragueneau seemed simultaneously to have noticed the same thing. Without any signal, at about four in the afternoon, the Onondagas steered their canoes for a wooded island in the middle of the St. Lawrence.  With Radisson were three Iroquois and a Huron.  As the canoe grated shore, the bowman loaded his musket and sprang into the thicket. Naturally, the Huron turned to gaze after the disappearing hunter. Instantly, the Onondaga standing directly behind buried his hatchet in the Huron's head.  The victim fell quivering across Radisson's feet and was hacked to pieces by the other Iroquois.  Not far along the shore from Radisson, the priest was landing.  He noticed an Iroquois chief approach a Christian Huron girl.  If the Huron had not been a convert, she might have saved her life by becoming one of the chief's many slaves; but she had repulsed the Onondaga pagan.  As Ragueneau looked, the girl fell dead with her skull split by the chief's war-axe.  The Hurons on the lake now knew what awaited them; and a cry of terror arose from the children.  Then a silence of numb horror settled over the incoming canoes.  The women were driven ashore like lambs before wolves; but the valiant Hurons would not die without striking one blow at their inveterate and treacherous enemies.  They threw themselves together back to back, prepared to fight.  For a moment this show of resistance drove off the Iroquois.  Then the Onondaga chieftain rushed forward, protesting that the two murders had been a personal quarrel. Striking back his own warriors with a great show of sincerity, he bade the Hurons run for refuge to the top of the hill.  No sooner had the Hurons broken rank, than there rushed from the woods scores of Iroquois, daubed in war-paint and shouting their war-cry.  This was the hunt to which the young braves had dashed from the canoes to be in readiness behind the thicket.  Before the scattered Hurons could get together for defence, the Onondagas had closed around the hilltop in a cordon.  The priest ran here, there, everywhere,--comforting the dying, stopping mutilation, defending the women.  All the Hurons were massacred but one man, and the bodies were thrown into the river.  With blankets drawn over their heads that they might not see, the women huddled together, dumb with terror.  When the Onondagas turned toward the women, the Frenchmen stood with muskets levelled.  The Onondagas halted, conferred, and drew off.  [Illustration: Paddling past Hostiles.]  The fight lasted for four hours.  Darkness and the valor of the little French band saved the women for the time.  The Iroquois kindled a fire and gathered to celebrate their victory.  Then the old priest took his life in his hands.  Borrowing three belts of wampum, he left the huddling group of Huron women and Frenchmen and marched boldly into the circle of hostiles.  The lives of all the French and Hurons hung by a thread.  Ragueneau had been the spiritual guide of the murdered tribe for twenty years; and he was now sobbing like a child.  The Iroquois regarded his grief with sardonic scorn; but they misjudged the manhood below the old priest's tears.  Ragueneau asked leave to speak.  They grunted permission.  Springing up, he broke into impassioned, fearless reproaches of the Iroquois for their treachery.

PREFACE   This little book tries to tell the story of the religious life of the Romans from the time when their history begins for us until the close of the reign of Augustus. Each of its five essays deals with a distinct period and is in a sense complete in itself; but the dramatic development inherent in the whole forbids their separation save as acts or chapters. In spite of modern interest in the study of religion, Roman religion has been in general relegated to specialists in ancient history and classics. This is not surprising for Roman religion is not prepossessing in appearance, but though it is at first sight incomparably less attractive than Greek religion, it is, if properly understood, fully as interesting, nay, even more so. In Mr. W. Warde Fowler's _Roman Festivals_ however the subject was presented in all its attractiveness, and if the present book shall serve as a simple introduction to his larger work, its purpose will have been fulfilled.  No one can write of Roman religion without being almost inestimably indebted to Georg Wissowa whose _Religion und Cultus der Römer_ is the best systematic presentation of the subject. It was the author's privilege to be Wissowa's pupil, and much that is in this book is directly owing to him, and even the ideas that are new, if there are any good ones, are only the bread which he cast upon the waters returning to him after many days.  The careful student of the history of the Romans cannot doubt the psychological reality of their religion, no matter what his personal metaphysics may be. It is the author's hope that these essays may have a human interest because he has tried to emphasise this reality and to present the Romans as men of like passions to ourselves, in spite of all differences of time and race.  Hearty thanks are due to Mr. W. Warde Fowler and to Mr. Albert W. Van Buren for their great kindness in reading the proofs; and the dedication of the book is at best a poor return for the help which my wife has given me.                             J.B.C.

In the middle of the five centuries of her republic came the Punic wars and the intimate association with Greece which made the last half of her history as a republic so different from the first half; and in the kingdom, which preceded the republic, there was a similar coming of foreign influence, which made the later kingdom with its semi-historical names of the Tarquins and Servius Tullius so different from the earlier kingdom with its altogether legendary Romulus, Numa, Tullus Hostilius and Ancus Martius. We have thus four distinct phases in the history of Roman society, and a corresponding phase of religion in each period; and if we add to this that new social structure which came into being by the reforms of Augustus at the beginning of the empire, together with the religious changes which accompanied it, we shall have the five periods which these five essays try to describe: the period before the Tarquins, that is the \"Religion of Numa\"; the later kingdom, that is the \"Reorganisation of Servius\"; the first three centuries of the republic, that is the \"Coming of the Sibyl\"; the closing centuries of the republic, that is the \"Decline of Faith\"; and finally the early empire and the \"Augustan Renaissance.\" Like all attempts to cut history into sections these divisions are more or less arbitrary, but their convenience sufficiently justifies their creation. They must be thought of however not as representing independent blocks, arbitrarily arranged in a certain consecutive order, not as five successive religious consciousnesses, but merely as marking the entrance of certain new ideas into the continuous religious consciousness of the Roman people. The history of each of these periods is simply the record of the change which new social conditions produced in that great barometer of society, the religious consciousness of the community. It is in the period of the old kingdom that our story begins.  At first sight it may seem a foolish thing to try to draw a picture of the religious condition of a time about the political history of which we know so little, and it is only right therefore that we should inquire what sources of knowledge we possess.  There was a time, not so very long ago, when under the banner of the new-born science of \"Comparative Philology\" there gathered together a group of men who thought they held the key to prehistoric history, and that words themselves would tell the story where ancient monuments and literature were silent. It was a great and beautiful thought, and the science which encouraged it has taken its place as a useful and reputable member of the community of sciences, but its pretensions to the throne of the revealer of mysteries have been withdrawn by those who are its most ardent followers, and the \"Indo-Germanic religion\" which is brought into being is a pleasant thought for an idle hour rather than a foundation and starting-point for the study of ancient religion in general. Altogether aside from the fact that although primitive religion and nationality are in the main identical, language and nationality are by no means so--we have the great practical difficulty in the case of Greece and Rome that in the earliest period of which we have knowledge these two religions bear so little resemblance that we must either assert for the time of Indo-Germanic unity a religious development much more primitive than that which comparative philology has sketched, or we must suppose the presence of a strong decadent influence in Rome's case after the separation, which is equally difficult. If we realise that in a primitive religion the name of the god is usually the same as the name of the thing which he represents, the existence of a Greek god and a Roman god with names which correspond to the same Indo-Germanic word proves linguistically that the _thing_ existed and had a name before the separation, but not at all that the thing was deified or that the name was the name of a god at that time. We must therefore be content to begin our study of religion much more humbly and at a much later period.  In fact we cannot go back appreciably before the dawn of political history, but there are certain considerations which enable us at least to understand the phenomena of the dawn itself, those survivals in culture which loom up in the twilight and the understanding of which gives us a fair start in our historical development. For this knowledge we are indebted to the so-called \"anthropological\" method, which is based on the assumption that mankind is essentially uniform, and that this essential uniformity justifies us in drawing inferences about very ancient thought from the very primitive thought of the barbarous and savage peoples of our own day. At first sight the weakness of this contention is more apparent than its strength, and it is easy to show that the prehistoric primitive culture of a people destined to civilisation is one thing, and the retarded primitive culture of modern tribes stunted in their growth is quite another thing, so that, as has so often been said, the two bear a relation to each other not unlike that of a healthy young child to a full-grown idiot. And yet there is a decided resemblance between the child and the idiot, and whether prehistoric or retarded, primitive culture shows everywhere strong likeness, and the method is productive of good if we confine our reasoning backwards to those things in savage life which the two kinds of primitive culture, the prehistoric and the retarded, have in common. To do this however we must have some knowledge of the prehistoric, and our modern retarded savage must be used merely to illumine certain things which we see only in half-light; he must never be employed as a lay-figure in sketching in those features of prehistoric life of which we are totally in ignorance. It is peculiarly useful to the student of Roman religion because he stands on the borderland and looking backwards sees just enough dark shapes looming up behind him to crave more light. For in many phases of early Roman religion there are present characteristics which go back to old manners of thought, and these manners of thought are not peculiar to the Romans but are found in many primitive peoples of our own day. The greatest contribution which anthropology has made to the study of early Roman religion is \"animism.\"  Not much more than a quarter of a century ago the word \"animism\" began to be used to describe that particular phase of the psychological condition of primitive peoples by which they believe that a spirit (_anima_) resides in everything, material and immaterial. This spirit is generally closely associated with the thing itself, sometimes actually identified with it. When it is thought of as distinct from the thing, it is supposed to have the form of the thing, to be in a word its \"double.\" These doubles exercise an influence, often for evil, over the thing, and it is expedient and necessary therefore that they should be propitiated so that their evil influence may be removed and the thing itself may prosper. These doubles are not as yet gods, they are merely powers, potentialities, but in the course of time they develop into gods.
