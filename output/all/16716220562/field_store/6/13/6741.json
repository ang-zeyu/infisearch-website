Christy, without the remotest suspicion on the part of the plotters that they could be heard by any living being, and especially not by so dangerous a character as Christy had proved himself to be to the peace and dignity of the Confederacy, heard all that was said, and he obtained a full idea of the intentions of the conspirators. When they went on board of the Bellevite, he was so excited that he could no longer remain in his prison, but came out, and crept up the accommodation ladder to the deck of the steamer. But he was careful not to show himself, and, having a key to the cabin, he went into it, locking the door after him. Then he had a chance to think.  What should he do? He had no force at hand to beat off such a party as Captain Carboneer mentioned. They might carry out their plot that very night, as they had talked of doing. Perhaps it would be executed at once, even while he was on board, and he would then be a prisoner. This idea was too galling to be considered, and he left the cabin to visit the wardroom. Going still farther forward, he was surprised to hear the roar of the flames in the furnaces below. It looked at that moment as though the Bellevite was doomed to sail under a Confederate flag. But if he could do nothing more, he could save himself, even if he had to jump into the river and swim to the shore.  Christy lost no time in making his way to the main deck of the vessel; but he was careful to avoid the visitors. He went back to the cabin, and went on deck from it. Then he discovered that the trio were in the act of descending the accommodation steps. Mounting the rail he saw them embark in the Florence, and sail down the river. Dismounting from the rail, he hastened to the engine-room, where he found Sampson getting the engine ready to be put in motion.  \"Ah, Christy, I thought you had gone,\" said the oiler.  \"Who were those two men who were on board?\" asked Christy, not a little excited.  \"They were two gentlemen you brought on board, Christy,\" replied Sampson, innocently enough.  \"That I brought on board!\" exclaimed the skipper of the Florence.  \"Yes, sir: and I thought you had gone ashore with them,\" added the oiler.  \"I brought no men on board, Sampson! What are you talking about?\" demanded Christy impatiently.  \"Didn't you bring two gentlemen on board, and didn't one of them want to measure the carriage of the big gun?\"  \"No! I did not! I have not seen you before now this evening,\" protested Christy.  \"Then I have lost my senses. Didn't you tell me to get up steam, because the steamer would be moved to the navy yard before daylight in the morning?\" demanded Sampson, bewildered by the denial of the young man.  \"I see now,\" added Christy. \"You mistook Corny for me.\"  Sampson gave him all the details of the visit of the strangers.     CHAPTER VII  MIDSHIPMAN CHRISTY PASSFORD   \"In a word, Sampson, an attempt will be made to-night to capture the Bellevite, and you have been getting up steam for the conspirators,\" said Christy, when the ship-keeper had finished his narrative of the visit of the trio to the ship.  \"Is that so?\" exclaimed Sampson, opening his mouth and his eyes very wide at the same time. \"Why, I had no more doubt that the young man who was talking to me was Christy than I have that he is talking to me now.\"  \"You had better look at me again, and be sure that you make no mistake,\" replied Christy, rather disgusted at the failure of the man to identify him.  \"I never once thought that it was not you. When the sailboat came alongside, I knew it was the Florence, and I supposed you were in her,\" pleaded Sampson. \"But I spoke to you, as I supposed, when the boat came alongside.\"  \"Did you? What did you say?\" asked Christy.  \"I said 'Is that you, Christy?' And you said 'Yes.'\"  \"Of course I did! What else could I say after you had told the enemy just how to proceed. You could not have expected any other answer.\"  \"I suppose I was very stupid; but I hope no harm has been done, for they have not got the steamer yet,\" added Sampson, very much disconcerted at the blunder he had made, though an older officer than Christy might have had more charity for the ship-keeper.  Seen in broad daylight, there was no striking resemblance between Corny and Christy, though they were of about the same size, and had some traits in common. As Corny and his companions came in the Florence, it was not very strange that Sampson should take it for granted that Christy was one of the evening visitors. The voices of the two cousins were not unlike, and the sound was all he had to guide his judgment. Then he was not in the enemy's country, and he could hardly have been on the lookout for an enemy several miles up the river.  \"Certainly no harm has been done, Sampson; but it is yet to be decided whether or not the Bellevite is to go into the navy of the United States or the navy of the Confederate States,\" added Christy, leaving the engine-room.  \"If we have snuffed the whole thing, I don't believe this steamer will ever wear anything but the Stars and Stripes,\" said Sampson stoutly; and there could be no doubt in regard to his loyalty, judging from his speech, though that is not always to be trusted in time of war.  \"Bellevite, ahoy!\" shouted some one at the foot of the accommodation steps.  \"Have they come again so soon?\" asked Sampson, as he rushed to the rail. \"It is only a small canoe.\"  \"Is Christy on board?\" called the visitor alongside.  \"That is Mr. Vapoor: tell him I am on board,\" added Christy.  \"Christy is on board, sir,\" replied Sampson to the hail. \"Will you come on board, sir?\"  Paul Vapoor would and did come on board, and Christy gave him a hearty welcome, for he was more glad to see him than he had ever been before in his life.  \"Where have you been all day and all the evening, Christy?\" asked the engineer. \"Your mother and sister are very much worried about you, for they have not seen you for a long time, and they fear that something has happened to you.\"  \"Something is likely to happen to me and all the rest of us who expect to go to sea in this steamer,\" replied Christy, as he proceeded to inform his friend as briefly as he could of the great event of the evening.  \"Well, if we are not in the enemy's country, the enemy are in ours,\" replied Paul. \"What is to be done?\"  \"That is what I have been thinking of. I listened very attentively to all that passed between Major Pierson and Captain Carboneer, and I am satisfied that the latter has a considerable force somewhere on the river, and their headquarters are at the mouth of a creek five miles down the river.\"  \"How many have they?\" asked the engineer.  \"I don't know; they did not mention the number in figures, but they have enough to work the ship, and even to fight her,\" replied Christy, very seriously.  \"That means forty or fifty, at least,\" added Paul. \"This looks like a heavy matter, and it is quite time that something was done about it.\"  \"But what shall we do is the question,\" said Christy anxiously. \"We have two men on board beside ourselves, and we can hardly expect to hold our own against fifty.\"  \"Who is this Captain Carboneer?\"  \"I saw him at Nassau, and he looked like a man of decision and character. I don't know anything about him, but I have no doubt he is a naval officer, both from the circumstances and from what I heard. I should say that he knows what he is about. You said that my father has not yet returned from the city?\"  \"He had not come at ten o'clock, and if he comes at all, the late train does not arrive till after twelve.\"  \"It may be too late to do anything at that time,\" said Christy. \"But I don't mean to give up the ship.\"  \"Good! I am with you on that point, Christy. I called at your house to inform you that you had been appointed a midshipman in the navy, and you are likely to have a chance to christen your commission to-night. This was all the rank they could give you, though you will really be a passed midshipman, and be a master very soon.\"  Christy was delighted with this news, though he had no time to make a demonstration of delight over it. He had narrowly escaped being the third officer of the Bellevite the year before, because his father did not believe in putting him forward as fast as his abilities would have warranted him in doing. Captain Breaker and Paul Vapoor had made the application for a position in the navy; for his father would not do it, for the reason that he did not wish to ask any favors for a member of his own family.  \"I thank you and Captain Breaker for all you have done for me, Paul, and I hope I shall be able to give a good account of myself. But we have no time to talk about that now. Captain Carboneer was waiting for a steamer which his naval associate, Lieutenant Haslett, was to charter or buy for the use of the party,\" said Christy, as he led the way to the forward deck of the steamer.  He and the engineer mounted the top-gallant forecastle, and looked intently down the river. The tide was coming in, so that the vessel, in coming up to her cable, pointed in that direction. But they could see nothing, not a craft of any description. Then Christy led the way to the long gun mounted amidships. He sighted across the piece, and, in a moment more, his mind seemed to have settled on the policy to be pursued in the present dangerous emergency. Perhaps the capture of a steamer under such circumstances was a thing unheard of at that time, but doubtless it looked simple enough to those who were engaged in the enterprise.  \"Do you think of engaging the enemy at long range, Christy?\" asked Paul, with a smile on his fine face, as seen by the light of the lantern which Sampson had brought to the place.  \"I think of beating them off in any way we can,\" replied the middy, as his friends all called him from that time. \"I have the gun pointing to a certain object on the river, which Captain"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18264"],["title","Within The Enemy's Lines (#8)"],["body","boneer's steamer must pass. He can't help putting his craft where the muzzle of this piece will cover it; and if we pull the lock-string at that instant, the shot will knock his steamer all to pieces, and spill the conspirators into the river.\"  \"If you hit her,\" suggested Paul.  \"You can't very well help hitting her. Just squint along that gun, and see where the shot will bring up.\"  Paul complied with this request, and took a long look over the great gun.  \"I should say that it was pointed a little too high,\" said he.  \"Perhaps it is; I have not fixed it just as I mean to have it. We will put in the charge before we do that,\" added Christy, who was now as self-possessed as though there was no excitement attending the operation he was arranging.  \"Do you know what steamer Captain Carbine will have?\" asked Paul.  \"Not Carbine; Carboneer. No, I don't know what steamer he will have; only that she is an old one, and has a walking-beam,\" replied Christy.  \"That is rather indefinite, midshipman,\" added Paul, with a smile. \"You can't always tell what a steamer is by looking at her, especially in the night; and a walking-beam is not a novelty on a steamer upon this river. You may send that shot through the wrong vessel; and if you should happen to kill a dozen or two of loyal citizens of the State of New York, they might be mean enough to hang you, or send you to the State prison for life for it. It won't do to fire off a shotted gun like that baby without knowing pretty well what you are shooting at.\"  \"That is a long argument, Paul; and I have not the remotest idea of doing any such thing as you describe. I am going to know what we are firing at before we pull the lock-string,\" replied Christy, rather impatiently. \"But we have no time to dig up mare's nests. We will get up the ammunition and load this gun; then we will do the rest of the business.\"  As ship-keeper and a member of the engineer's department for the last year, Sampson knew where everything was to be found. With all the usual precautions, the magazine was opened, and ammunition enough for three charges was conveyed to the deck, Warping having been called in to assist in the work. The gun was carefully loaded under the direction of Christy, who had been fully instructed and drilled in the duty. It was pointed as nearly as practicable to the point in the channel which the hostile steamer must pass, though the aim was to be rectified at the last moment.  Paul went to his stateroom and took off his handsome uniform, replacing it with a suit of his working garments. Then he hastened to the engine, examined it, and satisfied himself that it was in good condition for the office which was soon to be required of it. He gave Sampson particular directions for his duty, and then went down the accommodation steps with the midshipman.  \"What are you going to do next, Christy?\" asked Paul, for the young naval officer had been too busy with his preparations to develop his plan in full.  \"We will go ashore first, and I will take the Florence to the boat-house,\" replied Christy. \"The next thing to be done is to make a reconnoissance down the river.\"  \"Why not go down in the Florence?\" suggested Paul.  \"Because that would be too simple and innocent altogether,\" replied the middy; and perhaps he felt some of the dignity of his new rank. \"I think we had better see without being seen, especially as Captain Carboneer has seen and sailed the sloop. I have no doubt he has a sharp, nautical eye, and that he will recognize her. He might be rash enough to capture her, and thus deprive the United States Navy of two young, but able and hopeful officers, to say nothing of bottling them up so that he could make short work of the Bellevite.\"  \"You are right, Christy, as you always are. But see your mother before you do anything, and I will obey orders. She worries about you.\"  They landed and hastened to the mansion.     CHAPTER VIII  ARRANGING THE SIGNALS   Mrs. Passford was astounded at the news brought in by her son, and Miss Florry was terrified when informed that Major Pierson was not far from the mansion. But Paul Vapoor assured the latter that there was no danger, and Christy convinced his mother, who had a great deal of confidence in him, that he was fully equal to the occasion.  \"But I do not see that you can beat off the assailants if they happen to get alongside of the Bellevite,\" suggested Mrs. Passford. \"There are only four of you at the most.\"  \"I hope for re-enforcements,\" replied Christy, as he rang a bell for a servant. \"Beeks and Thayer, two of the quartermasters, live in the village; Mr. Watts, the chief steward, and three others of the old ship's company, live near here, and I think we can raise half a dozen more, making ten in all.\"  \"I know where to find half a dozen coal-passers,\" added Paul.  \"Then we shall do very well if we succeed in finding all these,\" added Christy, as the man-servant came to the door.  \"Call up all the stablemen, and have two horses saddled as quick as possible,\" continued Christy to the man.  \"What's that for, Christy?\" asked Paul, who had succeeded in quieting the fears of Miss Florry.  He was not altogether inexperienced in this duty, for the young lady had been alarmed more than once on board of the steam yacht, and he was always more successful than any other person at these times.  \"I can't stop to talk it all over, Paul; but if you will trust me, I will tell you as we go along what I think of doing,\" replied Christy.  \"All right, midshipman; I belong to the engine department, and we always obey orders even if the ship goes down,\" added Paul, laughing.  \"I am willing enough to tell you, but I have not the time to spin a long yarn, and perhaps answer objections, just now. We will mount the horses as soon as they come to the door, and drum up the force we have mentioned.\"  Christy continued by giving Paul the names of those he was to visit and summon to the deck of the Bellevite, and then they were to meet at a given place. They mounted the two fleet horses which Christy had selected for the occasion, and dashed off to the town, a short distance from the river. The middy found the two quartermasters, who boarded in the same house. They were to go on board of the steamer at once; but Beeks was to bring a canoe from the boat-house to the point on the shore nearest to the Bellevite before he went on board. Both of these men were cautioned not to say anything about any person they might see, and the same instruction was given to all the others whose services were required.  Mr. Watts had not retired when Christy called at his house, and he was duly startled by the information the young officer gave him. He was as ready to take part in the enterprise as even the middy himself, and he was conducted to the place where Paul was to meet the leader. He had more calls to make than Christy, and they had to wait some time for him; but when he did come, he reported that he had found and sent on board all the firemen and coal-passers he had named, and a few more, besides the old sailors who had sailed for years in the yachts of the owner of the Bellevite.  The services of about a dozen had been procured, but half of these were to do duty in connection with the engine, and the party so hastily gathered were not strong enough to beat off the force of the enemy if they attempted to board the vessel.  \"Now, Paul, I want you to understand the whole affair before we go any farther; and I wish you would go on board and take the command there,\" said the midshipman, as soon as the engineer had reported the result of his mission.  \"But are you not going to be on board, Christy? I don't pretend to be a sailor or a gunner,\" said Paul.  \"I shall go on board as soon as I can,\" replied Christy. \"You will find a boat on the shore, near the steamer, and you will go on board in that; but have the boat sent back for me.\"  \"All right, Christy; I will obey orders,\" added Paul, as he dismounted from his horse.  \"Mr. Watts will take your horse, and ride with me down the shore. We can see the river all the way, for we shall not stick to the road when it leads us away from it. As soon as we discover the steamer that is to bring up the enemy, I will run my horse back to this point, and go on board.\"  \"That is all easy enough,\" added Paul.  \"Easy enough; but I can form no idea as to when the steamer will come. We may have to wait till morning for it, and perhaps the plan of the enemy will fail, and they will not come at all.\"  \"If they don't come to-night, they never will; and there will be time enough for the home guard to scour the woods, and arrest all suspicious persons.\"  \"I said what I did so that you need not be impatient if you have to wait a long time. You will have a watch kept from the moment you get on board, and no stranger is to be allowed to put a foot on the deck. Captain Carboneer may send some one of his party to see that everything is working right on board for his side of the affair.\"  \"I will do that.\"  \"See that the steam is well up, so that we can move off in good time if we find it necessary to get under way,\" continued Christy.  \"I thought that was a settled point, and the ship was to be taken down the river in any case,\" said Paul.  \"I supposed so myself in the beginning; but if it is not necessary to run away, I don't care to do so. Let Boxie see that the cable is buoyed and ready to run out at a moment's notice.\"  \"All right, midshipman,\" replied Paul, as he hastened to the boat.  \"Why does he call you midshipman?--that is a new name,\" said the chief steward.  \"He brought me the news this evening that I had been appointed in the navy with that rank,\" replied Christy. \"Now we will ride down the river. Do you happen to know what time it is, Mr. Watts?\"  \"I don't know, but I think it is about half-past eleven. I am not much of an equestrian,\" replied the steward, as he mounted the horse, \"for I have been to sea all my life; but I think I can stay on "]]]
