It would bring back the roses to your pale cheeks. If you coop yourself up in this dark room, you'll fade away and get thin.\"  \"You are right. I will make an effort and go out. Besides, I must see about work.\"  Here Dodger entered the room in his usual breezy way. In his hand he brandished a morning paper.  \"How are you feelin', Florence?\" he asked; he had given up saying Miss Florence at her request. \"Here's an advertisement that'll maybe suit you.\"  \"Show it to me, Dodger,\" said Florence, beginning to show some interest.  The boy directed her attention to the following advertisement:      \"Wanted.--A governess for a girl of twelve. Must be a good     performer on the piano, and able to instruct in French and     the usual English branches. Terms must be moderate. Apply to     Mrs. Leighton, at 127 W. ---- Street.\"  \"There, Florence, what do you say to that? That's better than sewin'.\"  \"I don't know, Dodger, whether I am competent.\"  \"You play on the pianner, don't you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well enough to teach?\"  \"I think so; but I may not have the gift of teaching.\"  \"Yes, you have. Haven't you been teachin' me every evenin'? You make everything just as clear as mud--no, I don't mean that. You just explain so that I can't help understandin'.\"  \"Then,\" said Florence, \"I suppose I am at liberty to refer to you.\"  \"Yes; you can tell the lady to call at the office of Dodger, Esq., any mornin' after sunrise, and he'll give her full particulars.\"  Florence did not immediately decide to apply for the situation, but the more she thought of it the more she felt inclined to do so. The little experience she had had with Dodger satisfied her that she should enjoy teaching better than sewing or writing.  Accordingly, an hour later, she put on her street dress and went uptown to the address given in the advertisement.  No. 127 was a handsome brown-stone house, not unlike the one in which Florence had been accustomed to live. It was a refreshing contrast to the poor tenement in which she lived at present.  \"Is Mrs. Leighton at home?\" inquired Florence. \"Yes, miss,\" answered the servant, respectfully. \"Whom shall I say?\"  \"I have come to apply for the situation of governess,\" answered Florence, feeling rather awkward as she made the statement.  \"Ah,\" said the servant, with a perceptible decline in respect. \"Won't you step in?\"  \"Thank you.\"  \"Well, she do dress fine for a governess,\" said Nancy to herself. \"It's likely she'll put on airs.\"  The fact was that Florence was dressed according to her past social position--in a costly street attire--but it had never occurred to her that she was too well dressed for a governess.  She took her seat in the drawing-room, and five minutes later there was a rustling heard, and Mrs. Leighton walked into the room.  \"Are you the applicant for the position of governess?\" she asked, surveying the elegantly attired young lady seated on the sofa.  \"Yes, Mrs. Leighton,\" answered Florence, easily, for she felt more at home in a house like this than in the tenement.  \"Have you taught before?\"  \"Very little,\" answered Florence, smiling to herself, as she wondered what Mrs. Leighton would say if she could see Dodger, the only pupil she ever had. \"However, I like teaching, and I like children.\"  \"Pardon me, but you don't look like a governess, Miss----\"  \"Linden,\" suggested Florence, filling out the sentence. \"Do governesses have a peculiar look?\"  \"I mean as to dress. You are more expensively dressed than the average governess can afford.\"  \"It is only lately that my circumstances required me to support myself. I should not be able to buy such a dress out of my present earnings.\"  \"I am glad to hear you say that, for I do not propose to give a large salary.\"  \"I do not expect one,\" said Florence, quietly. \"You consider yourself competent to instruct in music, French and the English branches?\"  \"Oh, yes.\"  \"Do you speak French?\"  \"Yes, madam.\"  \"Would you favor me with a specimen of your piano playing?\"  There was a piano in the back parlor. Florence removed her gloves, and taking a seat before it, dashed into a spirited selection from Strauss.  Mrs. Leighton listened with surprised approval.  \"Certainly you are a fine performer,\" she said. \"What--if I should engage you--would you expect in the way of compensation?\"  \"How much time would you expect me to give?\"  \"Three hours daily--from nine to twelve.\"  \"I hardly know what to say. What did you expect to pay?\"  \"About fifty cents an hour.\"  Florence knew very well, from the sums that had been paid for her own education, that this was miserably small pay; but it was much more than she could earn by sewing.  \"I will teach a month on those terms,\" she said, after a pause.  Mrs. Leighton looked well pleased. She knew that she was making a great bargain.  \"Oh, by the way,\" she said, \"can you give references?\"  \"I can refer you to Madam Morrison,\" naming the head of a celebrated female seminary. \"She educated me.\"  \"That will be quite satisfactory,\" said Mrs. Leighton, graciously. \"Can you begin to-morrow?\"  \"Yes, madam.\"  \"You will then see your pupil. At present she is out.\"  Florence bowed and withdrew.  She had been afraid Mrs. Leighton would inquire where she lived, and she would hardly dare to name the humble street which she called home.  She walked toward Fifth Avenue, when, just as she was turning the corner, she met Mr. Percy de Brabazon, swinging a slender cane, and dressed in the extreme of the fashion.  \"Miss Linden!\" he exclaimed, eagerly. \"This is--aw--indeed a pleasure. Where are you walking this fine morning? May I--aw--have the pleasure of accompanying you?\"  Florence stopped short in deep embarrassment.     Chapter XII. A Friend, Though A Dude.   Percy de Brabazon looked sincerely glad to meet Florence, and she herself felt some pleasure in meeting one who reminded her of her former life.  But it was quite impossible that she should allow him to accompany her to her poor home on the East Side.  \"Thank you, Mr. de Brabazon, but my engagements this morning will hardly permit me to accept your escort,\" she said.  \"I suppose that means that you are going shopping; but I don't mind it, I assure you, and I will carry your bundles,\" he added, magnanimously.  \"That would never do. What! the fashionable Mr. de Brabazon carrying bundles? You would lose your social status.\"  \"I don't mind, Miss Florence, as long as you give me--aw--an approving smile.\"  \"I will give it now, as I bid you good-morning.\"  \"May I--aw--have the pleasure of calling upon you to-morrow evening, Miss Linden?\"  \"It is evident that you have not heard that I am no longer residing with my uncle.\"  Mr. de Brabazon looked surprised.  \"No, I had not heard. May I ask--aw--where you are wesiding?\"  \"With friends,\" answered Florence, briefly. \"As you are a friend and will be likely to hear it, I may as well mention that my uncle is displeased with me, and has practically disowned me.\"  \"Then, Miss Florence,\" said Mr. de Brabazon, eagerly, \"won't you accept--aw--my heart and hand? My mother will be charmed to receive you, and I--aw--will strive to make you happy.\"  \"I appreciate your devotion, I do, indeed, Mr. de Brabazon,\" said Florence, earnestly; \"but I must decline your offer. I will not marry without love.\"  \"I don't mind that,\" said Percy, \"if you'll agree to take a feller; you'll learn in time to like him a little. I am wich--I know you don't care for that--but I can give you as good a home as your uncle. If you would give me hope--aw----\"  \"I am afraid I cannot, Mr. de Brabazon, but if you will allow me to look upon you as a friend, I will call upon you if I have need of a friend's services.\"  \"Will you, weally?\"  \"Yes, there is my hand on it. I ought to tell you that I must now earn my own living, and am to give lessons to a young pupil in West ---- Street, three hours daily.\"  \"You don't mean to say you are actually poor?\" said Mr. de Brabazon, horrified.  \"Yes, indeed, I am.\"  \"Then, won't you let me lend you some money? I've got more than I need, I have, 'pon my honor.\"  \"Thank you, I promise to call upon you if I need it.\"  Mr. de Brabazon looked pleased.  \"Would you mind telling me where you are going to teach, Miss Florence?\"  Florence hesitated, but there was something so sincere and friendly in the young man's manner--dude though he was--that she consented to grant his request.  \"I am to teach the daughter of Mr. Robert Leighton.\"  \"Why, Miss Leighton is my cousin,\" said Percy, in joyous excitement.  \"Indeed! Had I known that I would hardly have told you.\"  \"Don't be afwaid! I will be vewy discreet,\" said Mr. de Brabazon.  \"Thank you, and good-morning.\"  Florence went on her way, cheered and encouraged in spite of herself, by her success in obtaining employment, and by the friendly offers of Mr. de Brabazon.  \"It is wrong to get discouraged,\" she said to herself. \"After all, there are warm hearts in the world.\"  When she entered her humble home, she found Dodger already there. There was an eagerness in his manner, and a light in his eye, that seemed to indicate good news.  \"Well, Dodger, what is it?\"  \"I've been waitin' half an hour to see you, Florence,\" he said. \"I've got some work for you.\"  \"What is it--sewing on a button, or mending a coat?\"  \"No, I mean workin' for money. You can play on the pianner, can't you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"They want a young lady to play the pianner at a dime museum, for nine dollars a week. It's a bully chance. I just told the manager--he's a friend of mine--that I had a young lady friend that was a stunnin' player, and he wants you to come around and see him.\"  It was a preposterous idea--so Florence thought--that she should consent to play at such a place; but she couldn't expect Dodger to look at the matter in the same light, so she answered, very gently and pleasantly:  \"You are very kind, Dodger, to look out for me, but I shall not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18584"],["title","The Edge of the Knife (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's note:    This etext was produced from Amazing Stories, May 1957.

They were all staring; even Guellick, in the fourth row, was almost half awake. Then one of them, taking his silence as an invitation to questions found his voice.  \"You say Khalid ib'n Hussein's been assassinated?\" he asked incredulously. \"When did that happen?\"  [Illustration: There was no past--no future--only a great chaotic NOW.]  \"In 1973, at Basra.\" There was a touch of impatience in his voice; surely they ought to know that much. \"He was shot, while leaving the Parliament Building, by an Egyptian  Arab named Mohammed Noureed, with an old U. S. Army M3 submachine-gun. Noureed killed two of Khalid's guards and wounded another before he was overpowered. He was lynched on the spot by the crowd; stoned to death. Ostensibly, he and his accomplices were religious fanatics; however, there can be no doubt whatever that the murder was inspired, at least indirectly, by the Eastern Axis.\"  The class stirred like a grain-field in the wind. Some looked at him in blank amazement; some were hastily averting faces red with poorly suppressed laughter. For a moment he was puzzled, and then realization hit him like a blow in the stomach-pit. He'd forgotten, again.  \"I didn't see anything in the papers about it,\" one boy was saying.  \"The newscast, last evening, said Khalid was in Ankara, talking to the President of Turkey,\" another offered.  \"Professor Chalmers, would you tell us just what effect Khalid's death had upon the Islamic Caliphate and the Middle Eastern situation in general?\" a third voice asked with exaggerated solemnity. That was Kendrick, the class humorist; the question was pure baiting.  \"Well, Mr. Kendrick, I'm afraid it's a little too early to assess the full results of a thing like that, if they can ever be fully assessed. For instance, who, in 1911, could have predicted all the consequences of the pistol-shot at Sarajevo? Who, even today, can guess what the history of the world would have been had Zangarra not missed Franklin Roosevelt in 1932? There's always that if.\"  He went on talking safe generalities as he glanced covertly at his watch. Only five minutes to the end of the period; thank heaven he hadn't made that slip at the beginning of the class. \"For instance, tomorrow, when we take up the events in India from the First World War to the end of British rule, we will be largely concerned with another victim of the assassin's bullet, Mohandas K. Gandhi. You may ask yourselves, then, by how much that bullet altered the history of the Indian sub-continent. A word of warning, however: The events we will be discussing will be either contemporary with or prior to what was discussed today. I hope that you're all keeping your notes properly dated. It's always easy to become confused in matters of chronology.\"  He wished, too late, that he hadn't said that. It pointed up the very thing he was trying to play down, and raised a general laugh.  As soon as the room was empty, he hastened to his desk, snatched pencil and notepad. This had been a bad one, the worst yet; he hadn't heard the end of it by any means. He couldn't waste thought on that now, though. This was all new and important; it had welled up suddenly and without warning into his conscious mind, and he must get it down in notes before the \"memory\"--even mentally, he always put that word into quotes--was lost. He was still scribbling furiously when the instructor who would use the room for the next period entered, followed by a few of his students. Chalmers finished, crammed the notes into his pocket, and went out into the hall.  Most of his own Modern History IV class had left the building and were on their way across the campus for science classes. A few, however, were joining groups for other classes here in Prescott Hall, and in every group, they were the center of interest. Sometimes, when they saw him, they would fall silent until he had passed; sometimes they didn't, and he caught snatches of conversation.  \"Oh, brother! Did Chalmers really blow his jets this time!\" one voice was saying.  \"Bet he won't be around next year.\"  Another quartet, with their heads together, were talking more seriously.  \"Well, I'm not majoring in History, myself, but I think it's an outrage that some people's diplomas are going to depend on grades given by a lunatic!\"  \"Mine will, and I'm not going to stand for it. My old man's president of the Alumni Association, and....\"         *       *       *       *       *  That was something he had not thought of, before. It gave him an ugly start. He was still thinking about it as he turned into the side hall to the History Department offices and entered the cubicle he shared with a colleague. The colleague, old Pottgeiter, Medieval History, was emerging in a rush; short, rotund, gray-bearded, his arms full of books and papers, oblivious, as usual, to anything that had happened since the Battle of Bosworth or the Fall of Constantinople. Chalmers stepped quickly out of his way and entered behind him. Marjorie Fenner, the secretary they also shared, was tidying up the old man's desk.  \"Good morning, Doctor Chalmers.\" She looked at him keenly for a moment. \"They give you a bad time again in Modern Four?\"  Good Lord, did he show it that plainly? In any case, it was no use trying to kid Marjorie. She'd hear the whole story before the end of the day.  \"Gave myself a bad time.\"  Marjorie, still fussing with Pottgeiter's desk, was about to say something in reply. Instead, she exclaimed in exasperation.  \"Ohhh! That man! He's forgotten his notes again!\" She gathered some papers from Pottgeiter's desk, rushing across the room and out the door with them.  For a while, he sat motionless, the books and notes for General European History II untouched in front of him. This was going to raise hell. It hadn't been the first slip he'd made, either; that thought kept recurring to him. There had been the time when he had alluded to the colonies on Mars and Venus. There had been the time he'd mentioned the secession of Canada from the British Commonwealth, and the time he'd called the U. N. the Terran Federation. And the time he'd tried to get a copy of Franchard's _Rise and Decline of the System States_, which wouldn't be published until the Twenty-eighth Century, out of the college library. None of those had drawn much comment, beyond a few student jokes about the history professor who lived in the future instead of the past. Now, however, they'd all be remembered, raked up, exaggerated, and added to what had happened this morning.  He sighed and sat down at Marjorie's typewriter and began transcribing his notes. Assassination of Khalid ib'n Hussein, the pro-Western leader of the newly formed Islamic Caliphate; period of anarchy in the Middle East; interfactional power-struggles; Turkish intervention. He wondered how long that would last; Khalid's son, Tallal ib'n Khalid, was at school in England when his father was--would be--killed. He would return, and eventually take his father's place, in time to bring the Caliphate into the Terran Federation when the general war came. There were some notes on that already; the war would result from an attempt by the Indian Communists to seize East Pakistan. The trouble was that he so seldom \"remembered\" an exact date. His \"memory\" of the year of Khalid's assassination was an exception.  Nineteen seventy-three--why, that was this year. He looked at the calendar. October 16, 1973. At very most, the Arab statesman had two and a half months to live. Would there be any possible way in which he could give a credible warning? He doubted it. Even if there were, he questioned whether he should--for that matter, whether he _could_--interfere....         *       *       *       *       *  He always lunched at the Faculty Club; today was no time to call attention to himself by breaking an established routine. As he entered, trying to avoid either a furtive slink or a chip-on-shoulder swagger, the crowd in the lobby stopped talking abruptly, then began again on an obviously changed subject. The word had gotten around, apparently. Handley, the head of the Latin Department, greeted him with a distantly polite nod. Pompous old owl; regarded himself, for some reason, as a sort of unofficial Dean of the Faculty. Probably didn't want to be seen fraternizing with controversial characters. One of the younger men, with a thin face and a mop of unruly hair, advanced to meet him as he came in, as cordial as Handley was remote.  \"Oh, hello, Ed!\" he greeted, clapping a hand on Chalmers' shoulder. \"I was hoping I'd run into you. Can you have dinner with us this evening?\" He was sincere.  \"Well, thanks, Leonard. I'd like to, but I have a lot of work. Could you give me a rain-check?\"  \"Oh, surely. My wife was wishing you'd come around, but I know how it is. Some other evening?\"  \"Yes, indeed.\" He guided Fitch toward the dining-room door and nodded toward a table. \"This doesn't look too crowded; let's sit here.\"  After lunch, he stopped in at his office. Marjorie Fenner was there, taking dictation from Pottgeiter; she nodded to him as he entered, but she had no summons to the president's office.         *       *       *       *       *  The summons"]]]
