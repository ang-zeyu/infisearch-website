This difficulty--let us not forget--will persist for years to come in Western Canada.  According to competent authorities wheat growing, being essentially a large unit undertaking, demands extensive farming.  This statement is very important, for its consequences in Church organization are far-reaching.  The planless settling of the Catholic homesteaders here and there on the prairie, has also created for the Church one of its greatest difficulties.  Living often 30, 40 and 50 miles from a Catholic chapel, these settlers drift away from the authority, teaching and sacraments of the Church.  To form self-supporting parishes in the sparsely settled districts is often an impossibility.  To this barrier of immense distances are added for long months, _unfavourable climatic conditions_.  The very severe cold, the high winds which have such a sweep on the boundless prairies, the terrific blizzards of the long winter months, will always remain great obstacles to an intense Catholic life in rural parishes.  Many Sundays, from December to March, it is a real impossibility for those who live at any distance to go to Church.  And who are those who have settled on our Western plains?  This is not the place to discuss the immigration policies of the past.  We are dealing with facts.  We have the _most cosmopolitan population_ one could imagine.  The most divergent factors go to make up the racial composition of our western population.  We know of a city parish that counted 16 different nationalities within its boundaries.  During the first and second generation, during what we would call the period of Canadianization of these various national elements, the Church has to face a most difficult and complex situation.  Diversity of nations means _variety of ideals, differences of customs and traditions_.  The disassociation from former relations and the sudden transfer to new conditions of life, have proved to be such a shock to many settlers that they fail to readjust their lives to the arising needs.  \"Separated from the influences of his early life the immigrant is apt to suffer from disintegrating reaction amid the perplexing distractions, difficulties and dangers of his new environment.  Frequently it happens that old associations are destroyed and there is no substitution of the best standards in the new environment.  A vacuum is created which invites the inrush of destructive influences.\"  How many foreigners have been lost to the Church because the teachings of their Faith were no longer handed down to them, wrapped up, we would say, in the folds of their national customs and celebrations!  The oriental and southern mind is more particularly susceptible to the influence of this national tinge with which religion itself comes to them.  The fusion of so many ethnical groups and their adaptation to new surroundings are the result of a very delicate and slow process, especially in rural communities.  \"You cannot play with human chemicals any more than with real ones.  You have to know something of chemistry,\" said Winston Churchill.  Thousands of foreigners have been lost to the faith because many of our own, clergy and laity, did not know the first elements of \"human chemistry.\"  The great leakage from the Church in the West is among Catholic immigrants.  Unscrupulous proselytisers on the specious plea of \"Canadianization\" have weaned them from the faith of their fathers.  This nefarious process is still at work, especially in the Ruthenian settlements.  _The number of languages_ complicates still more this ethnical problem. Not hearing the Catholic doctrine in his own language and crippled by that instinctive shyness and extreme reserve which seem to grasp him as he steps on our shores, the foreigner often loses contact with the Church.  Like a transplanted shrub in an uncongenial soil, he languishes for years in his faith and its practices.  _The very atmosphere_ of the West is another great cause of defections among the faithful.  You must live for some years \"out West\" to appreciate the full meaning of this statement.  Moral atmosphere is to the soul what air is to the lungs; it is health and life.  Two elements constitute that factor which plays such a vital part in our religious life--tradition and environment.  _Tradition_ links the past to the present and gives to the soul a certain stability amidst the fluctuations of life.  It is made up of details if you wish, but, like the tossing buoy, these details betray where the anchor is hidden.  This absence of the past has a great influence on our Western Church.  People hailing from all points of Eastern Canada, of the United States and of Europe, have not yet formed religious traditions which are to the Catholic life of the family and of the parish what roots are to a tree.  And what _environments_ surround our scattered settlers on the prairie? Only those who have come in close relation with the lonely homesteader can understand how much he is debarred from the influence of Catholic life.  Very often not even a chapel is to be found for miles and miles. A chapel, no matter how humble it may be, is in the religious world of a community like the mother-cell; in it life is concentrated; from it emanates activity.  Mass is now often said in a private house, a public hall or a school house.  Children who have not known the beauty and the warmth of Catholic worship will hardly appreciate its lessons.  Moreover, _social relations_ often bring our Western Catholics in very frequent contact with the different Protestant churches and their tremendous activities.  _Mixed marriages_ are the outcome of these circumstances.  God alone knows how many of our Catholic boys and girls have been lost to the faith through \"mixed marriages\" and marriages outside of the Church.        *      *      *      *      *      *  These various obstacles, _geographical_ (distance and climate), _ethnical_ (race and language), _religious_ (absence of Catholic tradition and surroundings), are the ever open crevices through which a tremendous leakage has been draining the vitality of the Church in Western Canada.  So the call of the West is like the frantic S.O.S. on the high seas, that snaps from the masts of a ship in danger.  It is the cry of thousands of Catholics sinking into the sea of unbelief and irreligion.  In the wreckage there is still a gleam of hope.  Great numbers yet cling to a remnant of the old faith of their fathers; it will keep them afloat until helping hands come to their rescue.  The Call of the Church in the West is a call of distress.  Has the Church in the East heard it?  What is its response?   _The Response of the East_  Has the Church at large in the East heard the call of the West?  Has that cry of distress gone through the ranks of our Catholics like the shrill blast of the bugle call?  Has it awakened our Catholics from their torpid lethargy and quickened their sense of responsibility?  Has the call been answered, or has it gone out like a cry in the wilderness, lost in the noise of our busy world, stifled by the clamour of other voices, smothered under other diocesan and parochial claims?  In the Church of Canada there have always been generous and noble souls for whom the missions of the West have had a mysterious attraction. Who can read without emotion of the heroic deeds of the first Jesuits who followed the explorers and _courreurs-des-bois_ in their perilous adventures?  What tribute of admiration and gratitude do we not owe to the Oblate missionaries who lived and died with the wandering children of the plains, who have kept the fires of Faith burning, from the banks of the Red River to the Pacific Coast, from the winding shores of the Missouri and Mississippi to the everlasting snows of the Arctic.  Their lives of heroism furnish a bright splash on the rather drab and bleak landscape of what was known as the Northwest Territories.  The Church of Canada will ever remain indebted to these noble pioneers of the cross, apostolic bishops and priests of the first hour; their saintly lives are forever emblazoned on the pages of Canadian history; the western trails murmur their names in gratitude and the children of the prairie still bless their memory by the dying fires of their camps.  Indeed the Province of Quebec for years sent her money to help the struggling schools of Manitoba.  The Catholic Church of Canada has pledged itself in the Plenary Council of Quebec to help the Ruthenian cause; the Catholic Church Extension Society of late years is enlisting the sympathies of Eastern Catholics for our Western missions.  With the help of their motherhouses our various sisterhoods have dotted the West with convents, schools, hospitals and charitable institutions.  We all recognize the beauty and the heroism of their Catholic charity and apostolic zeal.  Notwithstanding these noble efforts, can we safely state that the Church of Eastern Canada, as a whole, is deeply interested in the Catholic welfare of the West?  Have we kept pace with the changing conditions the last decade has brought throughout our Western Canada?  _No_.  _And this is our national sin_.  The Church as a whole, has not awakened to its responsibility.  As individuals, as parishes, as dioceses, Catholics here and there have nobly done their duty.  As a body, as a living Church of Canada, we have failed to help the struggling West as we should have done.  We have not thrown all the energies of our great living, organizing Church into this missionary work.  The Catholics of our Eastern Provinces are not yet united in one great, generous effort to protect and spread the Kingdom of God in their own fair Dominion.  The call of the Church in the West has not been heard.  Never has the importance of the West loomed up before the public mind as it has since the beginning of the war.  To realize this you have only "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18378"],["title","Catholic Problems in Western Canada (#4)"],["body","remark its growing influence in our political life.  It cannot be otherwise; the possibilities of the West are so great and so numerous.  Immense virgin prairies are still waiting for the plough. After the war, during the period of reconstruction, necessarily so pregnant of great events, the producing powers of our agricultural West will be tremendous.  This is, therefore, a trying period for the Church in the West.  Beyond the waving wheat of the prairie we should contemplate the ripening harvest of souls.  Like a growing youth, the Church in Western Canada needs more than ever, help and support from the Mother Church of the East.  This assistance in the present stage of the Western Church is a pressing duty of conscience, not only for the individual Catholic, but particularly for the Church as a whole, in Eastern Canada.  This duty is a duty of the hour, a duty most serious, most imperative. How can it be accomplished?  By the united action of the Eastern dioceses of Canada.  Each diocese is a constituted unity in itself, but not for itself alone.  Like each particular organism in the human system, it exists for the benefit of the whole.  The Catholicity of the Church implies this idea of solidarity whereby the strong help the weak and the rich come to the rescue of the poor.  Never, perhaps, has the Church suffered so much from the wasting of energies.  The torrent, if not directed, spends its energy on itself; turned into the mill race, every drop counts.  One of the great lessons the war has given to the world is the absolute necessity of centralized effort and the advisability of central organization rather than multiplying organizations.  We are living in an age of _efficiency_ through _co-operation_.  _Fas est ab hoste doceri_.--The lesson coming from our separated brethren should strike home.  One has to go West to see the feverish activities of the different denominations in that new field.  Ask the mission organizers of the various non-Catholic bodies how much money comes from the East to support the struggling Protestant churches of the West; visit their immense printing establishments which are producing and distributing the literature you will find on the table of the lonely Western settler; study these organizations which are supplying field secretaries, teachers, social workers to our foreign Catholic settlements, then you will begin to understand this word of Pius X.: \"The strength of the enemy lies in the apathy of the good.\" The mass of evidence, which can be had by the simple reading of the non-Catholic missionary reports, as to their activities in Western Canada, is nothing short of staggering.  What examples!  What lessons! Should they not turn our apathetic Catholics into enthusiastic apostles, stir them into watchfulness and action?  And what could we not do _with more unity of action_?  Two conditions make united action possible--_uniform plan_ and _authoritative leadership_.  It would be rather preposterous on our part to attempt to formulate what we could call a plan of campaign for our Western apostles.  We wish only to submit a few suggestions which may help to group our scattered energies and bring rescue to the Church, particularly in the unorganized districts of Western Canada.  To readjust our methods to conditions as we find them _means efficiency with the least waste of energy_.  Therefore, we claim that a \"survey\" of membership and conditions of the Catholic Church in unorganized districts is an absolute necessity.  It is the only _logical basis_ for true _knowledge of conditions_ and for development.  This \"survey\" will bring us into immediate contact with the fallen-away Catholics.  As it is now, are we not too often _waiting_ for the fallen-away to come to us?  If the survey has proved essential in the solving of educational and social problems, why should it not commend itself in religious matters?  Proselytizers--especially the English Biblical Society, with headquarters at Toronto and Winnipeg, have the survey of the West down to a science.  Their map room in the Bible House of Winnipeg is a perfect religious topography of Western Canada.  We are firm believers in what we would call the \"Catholicization\" of modern methods that have proved beneficial to any cause.  \"Without this survey and the grasp which it yields of the relative proportion of things, a vast waste of matter and energy alike is inevitable.\"  This Catholic survey of unorganized districts may appear to some as \"a dream,\" a desk-policy of apostleship--as too modern, etc.[2]  The only answer I can give are the facts and figures of the American Catholic Church Extension, whose work along similar lines proves their efficiency and high value.  The specific and ultimate object of the survey would be to keep Catholics who live out of the radius of parish life, in constant touch with the Church, its teaching, its sacraments and its authority.  The mailing of Catholic literature pamphlets, devotional and controversial, and newspapers, the teaching of catechism by correspondence, as is practised in certain districts of Minnesota, the selection of teachers for foreign districts and of boys for higher education, the establishment of a central Catholic Bureau of information in each Province, which could serve as a clearing house and centre of Catholic activities, and other means of apostleship, these would be the natural consequences of the survey.  Who cannot see what a help this would be to our scattered Catholics?  A great help to keep the faith among the scattered home-steaders.  The service of an _auto-chapel_ would bring them also, at least once a year, the benefit of the sacraments and the blessing of the priests' visit.  For, let us not forget it, one family now lost to the Church means several families in the coming generation.  This absence of contact with the Church has been for our scattered English-speaking Catholics especially, one of the great causes of the loss of faith.  And what about our mission to non-Catholics?  We have the truth; are we doing enough, not only to keep it among our own, but to spread it among others?  Are we aggressive enough?  And still I hear the Master say: \"And other sheep I have that are not of this fold; them also _I must bring_ and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and shepherd\" (Jo. X, 16).  _We must bring_ them back; they _shall hear our voice_. . . .  On the strength of that command and of that promise should our policy not be more saintly aggressive?  What an immense field awaits the zeal of true apostles!  Nowhere more than in the West has absolute disintegration set in among the different denominations. The universal desire for Church Union is, in our mind, the best proof of our statement.  The most elementary principles of Christianity, of a supernatural religion, have lost their grasp on the mind of the average Protestant Westerner.  Nominally, he belongs to a denomination, in reality he belongs to none.  And what are we doing to give them the faith?  A uniform plan of action, once adopted, requires for execution, _an authoritative leadership_, if desired results are expected.  In the Church of God the Bishops are our authoritative leaders--_Posuit Episcopos regere Ecclesiam Dei_.  In the ordinary life of the Church this authority in matters spiritual is delegated to and operates through the parish priests.  The parish is with the diocese, the established unit of religious organization.  For the work in unorganized districts, which is here the special subject of our attention, could there not be in each Province or in each diocese, four or five \"Free Lances?\" [3]  Let them be diocesan missionaries, priests chosen by the Bishops because of their special fitness for this great work.  They would be to the Church what the R.N.W. Mounted Police have been to the Northwest Territories, or what the itinerant preachers are to certain denominations in sparsely settled districts.  Their mission would be to visit, preach, baptize, say Mass in the distant districts not visited by a parish priest.  They would be the advance-guard of the Church throughout the land.  During the winter months they could continue their work by attending to districts within reach of a railway.  The religious Orders,--and they alone can more easily supply reserves and train subjects for this special work--the religious Orders surely will be able to enter into this field of missionary activity, at the same time protecting their subjects with the safeguards of the Rule as also of paternal vigilance and guidance.  An itinerant \"regional clergy\" radiating from a centre where they are fortified by the advantages of common life, is one of the Bishop of Northampton's remedial suggestions among possible \"new methods devised to meet new needs.\"  This suggestion is to be found in his Lenten Pastoral of 1920.  The Church in the East, through the Catholic Church Extension Society, would gladly, if well informed on the matter, furnish the financial aid for the support of these \"free lances\"--and their apostolic activities. The Catholic Truth Society would gladly, contribute all the literature needed to spread the truth and to keep the fires of faith burning on our prairies.  Grouping forces, co-ordination of efforts, is what we need most in Canada.  In the rank and file of the Catholic laity treasures of enthusiasm, latent powers of energy go to waste because there is no leader to awaken and direct them.  The policy of the _Catholic Church Extension_ is to act on these long unspoken desires, to loosen the pent-up energies of the Catholic heart throughout the land.   _The Specific Object of the Catholic Church Extension Society_  Through its press, literature, auxiliary societies and various other activities, this apostolic society is ever trying to quicken among Catholics a profound sense of responsibility to the Church Universal. The welfare of our Western missions depends on how the Church"]]]
