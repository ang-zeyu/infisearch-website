Part I (#3)"],["body"," the undertaker; but the happy thought struck me of putting my wheelbarrow alongside of the brick wall with a note inside it to the effect that I had \"sent my carriage as a mark of respect.\"  In one point we could not emulate the real funeral: that was carried out \"regardless of expense.\" The old miser had left a long list of the names of the people who were to be invited to it and to its attendant feast, in which was not only my father's name, but Jem's and mine. Three yards was the correct length of the black silk scarves which it was the custom in the neighbourhood to send to dead people's friends; but the old miser's funeral-scarves were a whole yard longer, and of such stiffly ribbed silk that Mr. Soot, the mourning draper, assured my mother that \"it would stand of itself.\" The black gloves cost six shillings a pair, and the sponge-cakes, which used to be sent with the gloves and scarves, were on this occasion ornamented with weeping willows in white sugar.  Jem and I enjoyed the cake, but the pride we felt in our scarves and gloves was simply boundless. What pleased us particularly was that our funeral finery was not enclosed with my father's. Mr. Soot's man delivered three separate envelopes at the door, and they looked like letters from some bereaved giant. The envelopes were twenty inches by fourteen, and made of cartridge-paper; the black border was two inches deep, and the black seals must have consumed a stick of sealing-wax among them. They contained the gloves and the scarves, which were lightly gathered together in the middle with knots of black gauze ribbon.  How exquisitely absurd Jem and I must have looked with four yards of stiff black silk attached to our little hats I can imagine, if I cannot clearly remember. My dear mother dressed us and saw us off (for, with some curious relic of pre-civilized notions, women were not allowed to appear at funerals), and I do not think she perceived anything odd in our appearance. She was very gentle, and approved of everything that was considered right by the people she was used to, and she had only two anxieties about our scarves: first, that they should show the full four yards of respect to the memory of the deceased; and secondly, that we should keep them out of the dust, so that they might \"come in useful afterwards.\"  She fretted a little because she had not thought of changing our gloves for smaller sizes (they were eight and a quarter); but my father \"pish\"ed and \"pshaw\"ed, and said it was better than if they had been too small, and that we should be sure to be late if my mother went on fidgeting. So we pulled them on--with ease--and picked up the tails of our hatbands--with difficulty--and followed my father, our hearts beating with pride, and my mother and the maids watching us from the door. We arrived quite half-an-hour earlier than we need have done, but the lane was already crowded with complimentary carriages, and curious bystanders, before whom we held our heads and hatbands up; and the scent of the wild roses was lost for that day in an all-pervading atmosphere of black dye. We were very tired, I remember, by the time that our turn came to be put into a carriage by Mr. Soot, who murmured--\"Pocket-handkerchiefs, gentlemen\"--and, following the example of a very pale-faced stranger who was with us, we drew out the clean handkerchiefs with which our mother had supplied us, and covered our faces with them.  At least Jem says he shut _his_ eyes tight, and kept his face covered the whole way, but he always _was_ so conscientious! I held my handkerchief as well as I could with my gloves; but I contrived to peep from behind it, and to see the crowd that lined the road to watch us as we wound slowly on.  If these outsiders, who only saw the procession and the funeral, were moved almost to enthusiasm by the miser's post-mortem liberality, it may be believed that the guests who were bidden to the feast did not fail to obey the ancient precept, and speak well of the dead. The tables (they were rickety) literally groaned under the weight of eatables and drinkables, and the dinner was so prolonged that Jem and I got terribly tired, in spite of the fun of watching the faces of the men we did not know, to see which got the reddest.  My father wanted us to go home before the reading of the will, which took place in the front parlour; but the lawyer said, \"I think the young gentlemen should remain,\" for which we were very much obliged to him; though the pale-faced man said quite crossly--\"Is there any special reason for crowding the room with children, who are not even relatives of the deceased?\" which made us feel so much ashamed that I think we should have slipped out by ourselves; but the lawyer, who made no answer, pushed us gently before him to the top of the room, which was soon far too full to get out of by the door.  It was very damp and musty. In several places the paper hung in great strips from the walls, and the oddest part of all was that every article of furniture in the room, and even the hearthrug, was covered with sheets of newspaper pinned over to preserve it. I sat in the corner of a sofa, where I could read the trial of a man who murdered somebody twenty-five years before, but I never got to the end of it, for it went on behind a very fat man who sat next to me, and he leaned back all the time and hid it. Jem sat on a little footstool, and fell asleep with his head on my knee, and did not wake till I nudged him, when our names were read out in the will. Even then he only half awoke, and the fat man drove his elbow into me and hurt me dreadfully for whispering in Jem's ear that the old miser had left us ten pounds apiece, for having saved the life of his cat.  I do not think any of the strangers (they were distant connections of the old man; he had no near relations) had liked our being there; and the lawyer, who was very kind, had had to tell them several times over that we really had been invited to the funeral. After our legacies were known about they were so cross that we managed to scramble through the window, and wandered round the garden. As we sat under the trees we could hear high words within, and by and by all the men came out and talked in angry groups about the will. For when all was said and done, it appeared that the old miser had not left a penny to any one of the funeral party but Jem and me, and that he had left Walnut-tree Farm to a certain Mrs. Wood, of whom nobody knew anything.  \"The wording is so peculiar,\" the fat man said to the pale-faced man and a third who had come out with them; \"'left to her as a sign of sympathy, if not an act of reparation.' He must have known whether he owed her any reparation or not, if he were in his senses.\"  \"Exactly. If he were in his senses,\" said the third man.  \"Where's the money?--that's what I say,\" said the pale-faced man.  \"Exactly, sir. That's what _I_ say, too,\" said the fat man.  \"There are only two fields, besides the house,\" said the third. \"He must have had money, and the lawyer knows of no investments of any kind, he says.\"  \"Perhaps he has left it to his cat,\" he added, looking very nastily at Jem and me.  \"It's oddly put, too,\" murmured the pale-faced relation. \"The two fields, the house and furniture, and everything of every sort therein contained.\" And the lawyer coming up at that moment, he went slowly back into the house, looking about him as he went, as if he had lost something.  As the lawyer approached, the fat man got very red in the face.  \"He was as mad as a hatter, sir,\" he said, \"and we shall dispute the will.\"  \"I think you will be wrong,\" said the lawyer, blandly. \"He was eccentric, my dear sir, very eccentric; but eccentricity is not insanity, and you will find that the will will stand.\"  Jem and I were sitting on an old garden-seat, but the men had talked without paying any attention to us. At this moment Jem, who had left me a minute or two before, came running back and said: \"Jack! Do come and look in at the parlour window. That man with the white face is peeping everywhere, and under all the newspapers, and he's made himself so dusty! It's such fun!\"  Too happy at the prospect of anything in the shape of fun, I followed Jem on tiptoe, and when we stood by the open window with our hands over our mouths to keep us from laughing, the pale-faced man was just struggling with the inside lids of an old japanned tea-caddy.  He did not see us, he was too busy, and he did not hear us, for he was talking to himself, and we heard him say, \"Everything of every sort therein contained.\"  I suppose the lawyer was right, and that the fat man was convinced of it, for neither he nor any one else disputed the old miser's will. Jem and I each opened an account in the Savings Bank, and Mrs. Wood came into possession of the place.  Public opinion went up and down a good deal about the old miser still. When it leaked out that he had worded the invitation to his funeral to the effect that, being quite unable to tolerate the follies of his fellow-creatures, and the antics and absurdities which were necessary to entertain them, he had much pleasure in welcoming his neighbours to a feast, at which he could not reasonably be expected to preside--everybody who heard it agreed that he must have been mad.  But it was a long sentence to remember, and not a very easy one to understand, and those who saw the plumes and the procession, and those who had a talk with the undertaker, and those who got a yard more than usual of such very good black silk, and those who were able to remember what they had had for dinner, were all charitably inclined to believe that the old man's heart had not been far from being in the right place, at whatever angle his head had been set on.  And then by degrees curiosity moved to Mrs. Wood. Who was she? What was she like? What was she to the miser? Would she live at the farm?  To some of these questions the carrier, who was the first to see her, replied. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18077"],["title","We and the World: A Book for Boys. Part I (#4)"],["body","was \"a quiet, genteel-looking sort of a grey-haired widow lady, who looked as if she'd seen a deal of trouble, and was badly off.\"  The neighbourhood was not unkindly, and many folk were ready to be civil to the widow if she came to live there.  \"But she never will,\" everybody said. \"She must let it. Perhaps the new doctor might think of it at a low rent, he'd be glad of the field for his horse. What could she do with an old place like that, and not a penny to keep it up with?\"  What she did do was to have a school there, and that was how Walnut-tree Farm became Walnut-tree Academy.     CHAPTER III.      \"What are little boys made of, made of?      What are little boys made of?\"                                 _Nursery Rhyme_.   When the school was opened, Jem and I were sent there at once. Everybody said it was \"time we were sent somewhere,\" and that \"we were getting too wild for home.\"  I got so tired of hearing this at last, that one day I was goaded to reply that \"home was getting too tame for me.\" And Jem, who always backed me up, said, \"And me too.\" For which piece of swagger we forfeited our suppers; but when we went to bed we found pieces of cake under our pillows, for my mother could not bear us to be short of food, however badly we behaved.  I do not know whether the trousers had anything to do with it, but about the time that Jem and I were put into trousers we lived in a chronic state of behaving badly. What makes me feel particularly ashamed in thinking of it is, that I know it was not that we came under the pressure of any overwhelming temptations to misbehave and yielded through weakness, but that, according to an expressive nursery formula, we were \"seeing how naughty we could be.\" I think we were genuinely anxious to see this undesirable climax; in some measure as a matter of experiment, to which all boys are prone, and in which dangerous experiments, and experiments likely to be followed by explosion, are naturally preferred. Partly, too, from an irresistible impulse to \"raise a row,\" and take one's luck of the results. This craving to disturb the calm current of events, and the good conduct and composure of one's neighbours as a matter of diversion, must be incomprehensible by phlegmatic people, who never feel it, whilst some Irishmen, I fancy, never quite conquer it, perhaps because they never quite cease to be boys. In any degree I do not for an instant excuse it, and in excess it must be simply intolerable by better-regulated minds.  But really, boys who are pickles should be put into jars with sound stoppers, like other pickles, and I wonder that mothers and cooks do not get pots like those that held the forty thieves, and do it.  I fancy it was because we happened to be in this rough, defiant, mischievous mood, just about the time that Mrs. Wood opened her school, that we did not particularly like our school-mistress. If I had been fifteen years older, I should soon have got beyond the first impression created by her severe dress, close widow's cap and straight grey hair, and have discovered that the outline of her face was absolutely beautiful, and I might possibly have detected, what most people failed to detect, that an odd unpleasing effect, caused by the contrast between her general style, and an occasional lightness and rapidity and grace of movement in her slender figure, came from the fact that she was much younger than she looked and affected to be. The impression I did receive of her appearance I communicated to my mother in far from respectful pantomime.  \"Well, love, and what do you think of Mrs. Wood?\" said she.  \"I think,\" chanted I, in that high brassy pitch of voice which Jem and I had adopted for this bravado period of our existence--\"I think she's like our old white hen that turned up its eyes and died of the pip. Lack-a-daisy-dee! Lack-a-daisy-dee!\"  And I twisted my body about, and strolled up and down the room with a supposed travesty of Mrs. Wood's movements.  \"So she is,\" said faithful Jem. \"Lack-a-daisy-dee! Lack-a-daisy-dee!\" and he wriggled about after me, and knocked over the Berlin wool-basket.  \"Oh dear, oh dear!\" said our poor mother.  Jem righted the basket, and I took a run and a flying leap over it, and having cleared it successfully, took another, and yet another, each one soothing my feelings to the extent by which it shocked my mother's. At the third bound, Jem, not to be behindhand, uttered a piercing yell from behind the sofa.  \"Good gracious, what's the matter?\" cried my mother.  \"It's the war-whoop of the Objibeway Indians,\" I promptly explained, and having emitted another, to which I flattered myself Jem's had been as nothing for hideousness, we departed in file to raise a row in the kitchen.  Summer passed into autumn. Jem and I really liked going to school, but it was against our principles at that time to allow that we liked anything that we ought to like.  Some sincere but mistaken efforts to improve our principles were made, I remember, by a middle-aged single lady, who had known my mother in her girlhood, and who was visiting her at this unlucky stage of our career. Having failed to cope with us directly, she adopted the plan of talking improvingly to our mother and at us, and very severe some of her remarks were, and I don't believe that Mother liked them any better than we did.  The severest she ever made were I think heightened in their severity by the idea that we were paying unusual attention, as we sat on the floor a little behind her one day. We were paying a great deal of attention, but it was not so much to Miss Martin as to a stock of wood-lice which I had collected, and which I was arranging on the carpet that Jem might see how they roll themselves into smooth tight balls when you tease them. But at last she talked so that we could not help attending. I dared not say anything to her, but her own tactics were available. I put the wood-lice back in my pocket, and stretching my arms yawningly above my head, I said to Jem, \"How dull it is! I wish I were a bandit.\"  Jem generally outdid me if possible, from sheer willingness and loyalty of spirit.  \"_I_ should like to be a burglar,\" said he.  And then we both left the room very quietly and politely. But when we got outside I said, \"I hate that woman.\"  \"So do I,\" said Jem; \"she regularly hectors over mother--I hate her worst for that.\"  \"So do I. Jem, doesn't she take pills?\"  \"I don't know--why?\"  \"I believe she does; I'm certain I saw a box on her dressing-table. Jem, run like a good chap and see, and if there is one, empty out the pills and bring me the pill-box.\"  Jem obeyed, and I sat down on the stairs and began to get the wood-lice out again. There were twelve nice little black balls in my hand when Jem came back with the pill-box.  \"Hooray!\" I cried; \"but knock out all the powder, it might smother them. Now, give it to me.\"  Jem danced with delight when I put the wood-lice in and put on the lid.  \"I hope she'll shake the box before she opens it,\" I said, as we replaced it on the dressing-table.  \"I hope she will, or they won't be tight. Oh, Jack! Jack! _How many do you suppose she takes at a time?_\"  We never knew, and what is more, we never knew what became of the wood-lice, for, for some reason, she kept our counsel as well as her own about the pill-box.  One thing that helped to reconcile us to spending a good share of our summer days in Walnut-tree Academy was that the school-mistress made us very comfortable. Boys at our age are not very sensitive about matters of taste and colour and so forth, but even we discovered that Mrs. Wood had that knack of adapting rooms to their inhabitants, and making them pleasant to the eye, which seems to be a trick at the end of some people's fingers, and quite unlearnable by others. When she had made the old miser's rooms to her mind, we might have understood, if we had speculated about it, how it was that she had not profited by my mother's sound advice to send all his \"rubbishy odds and ends\" (the irregularity and ricketiness and dustiness of which made my mother shudder) to be \"sold at the nearest auction-rooms, and buy some good solid furniture of the cabinet-maker who furnished for everybody in the neighbourhood, which would be the cheapest in the long-run, besides making the rooms look like other people's at last.\" That she evaded similar recommendations of paperhangers and upholsterers, and of wall-papers and carpets, and curtains with patterns that would \"stand,\" and wear best, and show dirt least, was a trifle in the eyes of all good housekeepers, when our farming-man's daughter brought the amazing news with her to Sunday tea, that \"the missus\" had had in old Sally, and had torn the paper off the parlour, and had made Sally \"lime-wash the walls, for all the world as if it was a cellar.\" Moreover, she had \"gone over\" the lower part herself, and was now painting on the top of that. There was nothing for it, after this news, but to sigh and conclude that there was something about the old place which made everybody a little queer who came to live in it.  But when Jem and I saw the parlour (which was now the school-room), we decided that it \"looked very nice,\" and was \"uncommonly comfortable.\" The change was certainly amazing, and made the funeral day seem longer ago than it really was. The walls were not literally lime-washed; but (which is the same thing, except for a little glue!) they were distempered, a soft pale pea-green. About a yard deep above the wainscot this was covered with a dark sombre green tint, and along the upper edge of this, as a border all round the room, the school-mistress had painted a trailing wreath of white periwinkle. The border was painted with the same materials as the walls, and with very rapid touches. The white flowers were skilfully relieved by the dark ground, and the varied tints of the leaves, from the deep evergreen of the old ones to the pale yellow of the young shoots, had demanded no new "]]]
