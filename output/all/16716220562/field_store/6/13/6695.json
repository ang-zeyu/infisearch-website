The tribe marched out to meet them, singing, firing guns, shouting a welcome, dancing as the Israelites danced of old when victors returned from battle.  Men, women, and children lined up on each side armed with clubs and whips to scourge the captives.  Well for Radisson that he had won the warriors' favor; for when the time came for him to run the gantlet of Iroquois _diableries_, instead of being slowly led, with trussed arms and shackled feet, he was stripped free and signalled to run so fast that his tormentors could not hit him. Shrieks of laughter from the women, shouts of applause from the men, always greeted the racer who reached the end of the line unscathed.  A captive Huron woman, who had been adopted by the tribe, caught the white boy as he dashed free of a single blow clear through the lines of tormentors.  Leading him to her cabin, she fed and clothed him. Presently a band of braves marched up, demanded the surrender of Radisson, and took him to the Council Lodge of the Iroquois for judgment.  Old men sat solemnly round a central fire, smoking their calumets in silence.  Radisson was ordered to sit down.  A coal of fire was put in the bowl of the great Council Pipe and passed reverently round the assemblage.  Then the old Huron woman entered, gesticulating and pleading for the youth's life.  The men smoked on silently with deep, guttural \"ho-ho's,\" meaning \"yes, yes, we are pleased.\"  The woman was granted permission to adopt Radisson as a son.  Radisson had won his end.  Diplomacy and courage had saved his life.  It now remained to await an opportunity for escape.  Radisson bent all his energies to become a great hunter.  He was given firearms, and daily hunted with the family of his adoption.  It so happened that the family had lost a son in the wars, whose name had signified the same as Radisson's--that is, \"a stone\"; so the Pierre of Three Rivers became the Orimha of the Mohawks.  The Iroquois husband of the woman who had befriended him gave such a feast to the Mohawk braves as befitted the prestige of a warrior who had slain nineteen enemies with his own hand.  Three hundred young Mohawks sat down to a collation of moose nose and beaver tails and bears' paws, served by slaves.  To this banquet Radisson was led, decked out in colored blankets with garnished leggings and such a wealth of wampum strings hanging from wrists, neck, hair, and waist that he could scarcely walk.  Wampum means more to the Indian than money to the white man.  It represents not only wealth but social standing, and its value may be compared to the white man's estimate of pink pearls.  Diamond-cutters seldom spend more than two weeks in polishing a good stone.  An Indian would spend thirty days in perfecting a single bit of shell into fine wampum. Radisson's friends had ornamented him for the feast in order to win the respect of the Mohawks for the French boy.  Striking his hatchet through a kettle of sagamite to signify thus would he break peace to all Radisson's foes, the old Iroquois warrior made a speech to the assembled guests.  The guests clapped their hands and shouted, \"Chagon, Orimha!--Be merry, Pierre!\"  The Frenchman had been formally adopted as a Mohawk.   The forests were now painted in all the glories of autumn.  All the creatures of the woodlands shook off the drowsy laziness of summer and came down from the uplands seeking haunts for winter retreat.  Moose and deer were on the move.  Beaver came splashing down-stream to plaster up their wattled homes before frost.  Bear and lynx and marten, all were restless as the autumn winds instinct with coming storm.  This is the season when the Indian sets out to hunt and fight.  Furnished with clothing, food, and firearms, Radisson left the Mohawk Valley with three hunters.  By the middle of August, the rind of the birch is in perfect condition for peeling.  The first thing the hunters did was to slit off the bark of a thick-girthed birch and with cedar linings make themselves a skiff.  Then they prepared to lay up a store of meat for the winter's war-raids.  Before ice forms a skim across the still pools, nibbled chips betray where a beaver colony is at work; so the hunters began setting beaver traps.  One night as they were returning to their wigwam, there came through the leafy darkness the weird sound of a man singing.  It was a solitary Algonquin captive, who called out that he had been on the track of a bear since daybreak.  He probably belonged to some well-known Iroquois, for he was welcomed to the camp-fire.  The sight of a face from Three Rivers roused the Algonquin's memories of his northern home.  In the noise of the crackling fire, he succeeded in telling Radisson, without being overheard by the Iroquois, that he had been a captive for two years and longed to escape.  \"Do you love the French?\" the Algonquin asked Radisson.  \"Do you love the Algonquin?\" returned Radisson, knowing they were watched.  \"As I do my own nation.\"  Then leaning across to Radisson, \"Brother--white man!--Let us escape!  The Three Rivers--it is not far off!  Will you live like a Huron in bondage, or have your liberty with the French?\"  Then, lowering his voice, \"Let us kill all three this night when they are asleep!\"  From such a way of escape, the French youth held back.  The Algonquin continued to urge him.  By this time, Radisson must have heard from returning Iroquois warriors that they had slain the governor of Three Rivers, Duplessis-Kerbodot, and eleven other Frenchmen, among whom was the husband of Radisson's eldest sister, Marguerite.[9]  While Radisson was still hesitating, the suspicious Iroquois demanded what so much whispering was about; but the alert Algonquin promptly quieted their fears by trumping up some hunting story.  Wearied from their day's hunt, the three Mohawks slept heavily round the camp-fire. They had not the least suspicion of danger, for they had stacked their arms carelessly against the trees of the forest.  Terrified lest the Algonquin should attempt to carry out his threat, Radisson pretended to be asleep.  Rising noiselessly, the Algonquin sat down by the fire. The Mohawks slept on.  The Algonquin gave Radisson a push.  The French boy looked up to see the Algonquin studying the postures of the sleeping forms.  The dying fire glimmered like a blotch of blood under the trees.  Stepping stealthy as a cat over the sleeping men, the Indian took possession of their firearms.  Drawn by a kind of horror, Radisson had risen.  The Algonquin thrust one of the tomahawks into the French lad's hands and pointed without a word at the three sleeping Mohawks.  Then the Indian began the black work.  The Mohawk nearest the fire never knew that he had been struck, and died without a sound. Radisson tried to imitate the relentless Algonquin, but, unnerved with horror, he bungled the blow and lost hold of the hatchet just as it struck the Mohawk's head.  The Iroquois sprang up with a shout that awakened the third man, but the Algonquin was ready.  Radisson's blow proved fatal.  The victim reeled back dead, and the third man was already despatched by the Algonquin.  Radisson was free.  It was a black deed that freed him, but not half so black as the deeds perpetrated in civilized wars for less cause; and for that deed Radisson was to pay swift retribution.  Taking the scalps as trophies to attest his word, the Algonquin threw the bodies into the river.  He seized all the belongings of the dead men but one gun and then launched out with Radisson on the river.  The French youth was conscience-stricken.  \"I was sorry to have been in such an encounter,\" he writes, \"but it was too late to repent.\"  Under cover of the night mist and shore foliage, they slipped away with the current.  At first dawn streak, while the mist still hid them, they landed, carried their canoe to a sequestered spot in the dense forest, and lay hidden under the upturned skiff all that day, tormented by swarms of mosquitoes and flies, but not daring to move from concealment.  At nightfall, they again launched down-stream, keeping always in the shadows of the shore till mist and darkness shrouded them, then sheering off for mid-current, where they paddled for dear life.  Where camp-fires glimmered on the banks, they glided past with motionless paddles.  Across Lake Champlain, across the Richelieu, over long _portages_ where every shadow took the shape of an ambushed Iroquois, for fourteen nights they travelled, when at last with many windings and false alarms they swept out on the wide surface of Lake St. Peter in the St. Lawrence.  Within a day's journey of Three Rivers, they were really in greater danger than they had been in the forests of Lake Champlain.  Iroquois had infested that part of the St. Lawrence for more than a year.  The forest of the south shore, the rush-grown marshes, the wooded islands, all afforded impenetrable hiding.  It was four in the morning when they reached Lake St. Peter.  Concealing their canoe, they withdrew to the woods, cooked their breakfast, covered the fire, and lay down to sleep. In a couple of hours the Algonquin impatiently wakened Radisson and urged him to cross the lake to the north shore on the Three Rivers side.  Radisson warned the Indian that the Iroquois were ever lurking about Three Rivers.  The Indian would not wait till sunset.  \"Let us go,\" he said.  \"We are past fear.  Let us shake off the yoke of these whelps that have killed so many French and black robes (priests). . . . If you come not now that we are so near, I leave you, and will tell the governor you were afraid to come.\"  Radisson's judgment was overruled by the impatient Indian.  They pushed their skiff out from the rushes.  The water lay calm as a sea of silver.  They paddled directly across to get into hiding on the north shore.  Halfway across Radisson, who was at the bow, called out that he saw shadows on the water ahead.  The Indian stood up and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18216"],["title","Pathfinders of the West (#5)"],["body","that the shadow was the reflection of a flying bird.  Barely had they gone a boat length when the shadows multiplied.  They were the reflections of Iroquois ambushed among the rushes.  Heading the canoe back for the south shore, they raced for their lives.  The Iroquois pursued in their own boats.  About a mile from the shore, the strength of the fugitives fagged.  Knowing that the Iroquois were gaining fast, Radisson threw out the loathsome scalps that the Algonquin had persisted in carrying. By that strange fatality which seems to follow crime, instead of sinking, the hairy scalps floated on the surface of the water back to the pursuing Iroquois.  Shouts of rage broke from the warriors. Radisson's skiff was so near the south shore that he could see the pebbled bottom of the lake; but the water was too deep to wade and too clear for a dive, and there was no driftwood to afford hiding.  Then a crash of musketry from the Iroquois knocked the bottom out of the canoe.  The Algonquin fell dead with two bullet wounds in his head and the canoe gradually filled, settled, and sank, with the young Frenchman clinging to the cross-bar mute as stone.  Just as it disappeared under water, Radisson was seized, and the dead Algonquin was thrown into the Mohawk boats.  Radisson alone remained to pay the penalty of a double crime; and he might well have prayed for the boat to sink.  The victors shouted their triumph.  Hurrying ashore, they kindled a great fire.  They tore the heart from the dead Algonquin, transfixed the head on a pike, and cast the mutilated body into the flames for those cannibal rites in which savages thought they gained courage by eating the flesh of their enemies.  Radisson was rifled of clothes and arms, trussed at the elbows, roped round the waist, and driven with blows back to the canoes.  There were other captives among the Mohawks.  As the canoes emerged from the islands, Radisson counted one hundred and fifty Iroquois warriors, with two French captives, one white woman, and seventeen Hurons.  Flaunting from the canoe prows were the scalps of eleven Algonquins.  The victors fired off their muskets and shouted defiance until the valley rang.  As the seventy-five canoes turned up the Richelieu River for the country of the Iroquois, hope died in the captive Hurons and there mingled with the chant of the Mohawks' war-songs, the low monotonous dirge of the prisoners:--    \"If I die, I die valiant!   I go without fear   To that land where brave men   Have gone long before me--   If I die, I die valiant.\"  Twelve miles up the Richelieu, the Iroquois landed to camp.  The prisoners were pegged out on the sand, elbows trussed to knees, each captive tied to a post.  In this fashion they lay every night of encampment, tortured by sand-flies that they were powerless to drive off.  At the entrance to the Mohawk village, a yoke was fastened to the captives' necks by placing pairs of saplings one on each side down the line of prisoners.  By the rope round the waist of the foremost prisoner, they were led slowly between the lines of tormentors.  The captives were ordered to sing.  If one refused or showed fear, a Mohawk struck off a finger with a hatchet, or tore the prisoners' nails out, or thrust red-hot irons into the muscles of the bound arms.[10]  As Radisson appeared, he was recognized with shouts of rage by the friends of the murdered Mohawks.  Men, women, and children armed with rods and skull-crackers--leather bags loaded with stones--rushed on the slowly moving file of prisoners.  \"They began to cry from both sides,\" says Radisson; \"we marching one after another, environed with people to witness that hideous sight, which seriously may be called the image of Hell in this world.\"  The prisoners moved mournfully on.  The Hurons chanted their death dirge.  The Mohawk women uttered screams of mockery.  Suddenly there broke from the throng of onlookers the Iroquois family that had adopted Radisson.  Pushing through the crew of torturers, the mother caught Radisson by the hair, calling him by the name of her dead son, \"Orimha! Orimha!\"  She cut the thongs that bound him to the poles, and wresting him free shoved him to her husband, who led Radisson to their own lodge.  \"Thou fool,\" cried the old chief, \"thou wast my son!  Thou makest thyself an enemy!  Thou lovest us not, though we saved thy life! Wouldst kill me, too?\"  Then, with a rough push to a mat on the ground, \"Chagon--now, be merry!  It's a merry business you've got into!  Give him something to eat!\"  Trembling with fear, young Radisson put as bold a face on as he could and made a show of eating what the squaw placed before him.  He was still relating his adventures when there came a roar of anger from the Mohawks outside, who had discovered his absence from the line.  A moment later the rabble broke into the lodge.  Jostling the friendly chief aside, the Mohawk warriors carried Radisson back to the orgies of the torture.  The prisoners had been taken out of the stocks and placed on several scaffoldings.  One poor Frenchman fell to the ground bruised and unable to rise.  The Iroquois tore the scalp from his head and threw him into the fire.  That was Radisson's first glimpse of what was in store for him.  Then he, too, stood on the scaffolding among the other prisoners, who never ceased singing their death song.  In the midst of these horrors--_diableries_, the Jesuits called them--as if the very elements had been moved with pity, there burst over the darkened forest a terrific hurricane of hail and rain.  This put out the fires and drove all the tormentors away but a few impish children, who stayed to pluck nails from the hands and feet of the captives and shoot arrows with barbed points at the naked bodies.  Every iniquity that cruelty could invent, these children practised on the captives. Red-hot spears were brought from the lodge fires and thrust into the prisoners.  The mutilated finger ends were ground between stones. Thongs were twisted round wrists and ankles, by sticks put through a loop, till flesh was cut to the bone.  As the rain ceased falling, a woman, who was probably the wife of one of the murdered Mohawks, brought her little boy to cut one of Radisson's fingers with a flint stone.  The child was too young and ran away from the gruesome task.  Gathering darkness fell over the horrible spectacle.  The exhausted captives, some in a delirium from pain, others unconscious, were led to separate lodges, or dragged over the ground, and left tied for the night.  The next morning all were returned to the scaffolds, but the first day had glutted the Iroquois appetite for tortures.  The friendly family was permitted to approach Radisson.  The mother brought him food and told him that the Council Lodge had decided not to kill him for that day--they wanted the young white warrior for their own ranks; but even as the cheering hope was uttered, came a brave with a pipe of live coals, in which he thrust and held Radisson's thumb.  No sooner had the tormentor left than the woman bound up the burn and oiled Radisson's wounds.  He suffered no abuse that day till night, when the soles of both feet were burned.  The majority of the captives were flung into a great bonfire.  On the third day of torture he almost lost his life. First came a child to gnaw at his fingers.  Then a man appeared armed for the ghastly work of mutilation.  Both these the Iroquois father of Radisson sent away.  Once, when none of the friendly family happened to be near, Radisson was seized and bound for burning, but by chance the lighted faggot scorched his executioner.  A friendly hand slashed the thongs that bound him, and he was drawn back to the scaffold.  Past caring whether he lived or died, and in too great agony from the burns of his feet to realize where he was going, Radisson was conducted to the Great Council.  Sixty old men sat on a circle of mats, smoking, round the central fire.  Before them stood seven other captives. Radisson only was still bound.  A gust of wind from the opening lodge door cleared the smoke for an instant and there entered Radisson's Indian father, clad in the regalia of a mighty chief.  Tomahawk and calumet and medicine-bag were in his hands.  He took his place in the circle of councillors.  Judgment was to be given on the remaining prisoners.  After passing the Council Pipe from hand to hand in solemn silence, the sachems prepared to give their views.  One arose, and offering the smoke of incense to the four winds of heaven to invoke witness to the justice of the trial, gave his opinion on the matter of life or death. Each of the chiefs in succession spoke.  Without any warning whatever, one chief rose and summarily tomahawked three of the captives.  That had been the sentence.  The rest were driven, like sheep for the shambles, to life-long slavery.  Radisson was left last.  His case was important.  He had sanctioned the murder of three Mohawks.  Not for a moment since he was recaptured had they dared to untie the hands of so dangerous a prisoner.  Amid deathly silence, the Iroquois father stood up.  Flinging down medicine-bag, fur robe, wampum belts, and tomahawk, he pointed to the nineteen scars upon his side, each of which signified an enemy slain by his own hand.  Then the old Mohawk broke into one of those impassioned rhapsodies of eloquence which delighted the savage nature, calling back to each of the warriors recollection of victories for the Iroquois.  His eyes took fire from memory of heroic battle.  The councillors shook off their imperturbable gravity and shouted \"Ho, ho!\"  Each man of them had a memory of his part in those past glories.  And as they applauded, there glided into the wigwam the mother, singing some battle-song of valor, dancing and gesticulating round and round the lodge in dizzy, serpentine circlings, that illustrated in pantomime those battles of long ago.  Gliding ghostily from the camp-fire to the outer dark, she "]]]
