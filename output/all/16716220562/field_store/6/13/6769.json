A tiny chapel indeed--a plain frame building, with no pretence to architectural beauty.  It was intended originally, I thought, for a Protestant meeting-house, as the cruciform shape, so conspicuous in all Catholic-built churches was wanting here.  The whitewashed walls were hung with small, rude pictures, representing the _Via Crucis_ or Stations of the Cross, and the altar-piece--not, I fancy, a remarkable work of art in its prime--had become so darkened by smoke, that I only _conjectured_ its subject to be St. Francis in prayer.  Although it was Whit-Sunday the altar was quite innocent of ornament, having only six candles, and a floral display of two bouquets.  The seats and kneeling-benches were uncushioned, and the congregation was composed, as Bernard said, entirely of the working class; but the people were very clean and respectable in their appearance, and fervent in their devotions as only the Irish peasantry can be.  The pastor, an intelligent young Irishman, apparently under thirty, had already said Mass at Pleasantville, six miles distant, and upon arriving at Mount Kisco he found that about twenty of his small congregation wished to receive Communion, as it was a festival; consequently, he spent the next hour not _literally_ in the confessional, for there was none, but in the tiny closet dignified by the name of a vestry.  From thence, the door being open, we could with ease, had we had nothing better to do, have heard all of the priest's advice to his penitents.  This ceremony over, the young Father came out in his black cassock, and taking up his vestments which lay upon the altar-steps, he proceeded with the utmost nonchalance to put them on, not hesitating to display a long rent in his surplice, and a decidedly ragged sleeve.  The Mass was a Low one, and the congregation were too poor to have an organ or organist.  Quite a contrast to a Sunday at St. Stephen's or St. Francis Xavier's, but the _Mass_ is always the same, however humble the surroundings.   _June 3_.  We are unusually fortunate, I think, in our domestic surroundings. Servants are proverbially the _bête noire_ of American ladies, and the prospect of having to train some unskilled specimens of foreign peasantry weighed heavily, I fancy, upon our beautiful Ida in her new responsibility of a young _Dame Châtelaine_.  However, we have been, as I said, singularly successful in obtaining servants.  To my great delight, there is not one ugly name in our little household, although composed of eight members, commencing with _Queen_ Esther as mamma has been named; then we four girls--_la Dame Châtelaine_, with her fair face, dark, pensive eyes, and modest dignity; Gabrielle, or _Tourbillon_, our brilliant pet, and the youngest of our quartette, although her graceful figure rises above the rest of us; my sister Marguerite, _la Gentille Demoiselle_; and I, Cecilia.  Then come the household retinue: Bernard, the coachman, already introduced, a smart-looking young Irishman, whom the maids always find very beguiling; Lina, the autocrat of the kitchen, a little, wiry-looking woman from Stockholm, formerly cook, so _she_ says, to King Charles of Sweden; and Minna, the maid.  Minna is a pretty young Bavarian, who has been only fifteen days in the Land of Liberty, but she has already learnt, I am amused to see, _not_ to address a lady as \"_gnädige_ Frau,\" or \"Fräulein\"--a style of address imperative in South Germany from a maid to her mistress.  Minna has not, however, imbibed all of the democratic principles that will, I fear, come to her only too soon, for she has not yet learnt to emulate her mistress in dress.  It is really quite refreshing to see a servant dressed as a servant.  Minna is the perfection of neatness, and her plain stuff or print gowns are _sans reproche_ in their freshness.  In the matter of aprons she must be quite reckless, for they always look as if just from the ironing-table.  They are made, too, in an especially pretty fashion that I have never before seen out of Munich. Scorning chignons, Minna appears with her own luxuriant hair in massive braids wound about her well-shaped head, and as to-day is Sunday and a _Fest-tag_, she adorns herself with a large shell-comb.  She has very pretty, coquettish ways, that have already melted the heart of our hitherto unsusceptible Bernard, and it is quite charming to hear her attempts to converse with him in her broken English.  Minna came to me this morning directly after breakfast, and said, \"Where shall I go to church, Fräulein Cecilia?\"  \"I do not really know, Minna,\" I replied.  \"You are a Lutheran, I suppose?\"  \"Yes, Fräulein Cecilia.\"  \"There is no church of that sort here,\" I said, \"but there is a Reformed Church next door.\"  With a very doubtful expression, she said: \"I will see, Fräulein.  And _bitte_, is not the _Pfingsten_ a Fest-tag in America?  In our country, you know, it is _more_ than Sunday, and the people always amuse themselves.\"  I explained to her as clearly as I could, that Pfingsten (Whit-Sunday) was only a Fest-tag in her church, mine, and the Church of England, and that it was never in this country a Fest-tag, outside of the religious observance.  A very perplexed face was the result of my explanations; why Pfingsten should not be Pfingsten the world over, and a public holiday with all sorts of merry-makings, she could not understand.     CHAPTER II.  Arrival of the Piano--Routine of a Day--Morning Toilettes--The Dining-room--Pictures--Ida and Gabrielle--How occupied--The Evening Mail--Musical Evenings.   _June 4_.  Yesterday the piano was sent up from Steinway's, where it has been stored since last fall, and now we have all settled to our different occupations, and are as methodical in the disposition of our time as though we were in school.  None of us are very early risers, for mamma, who should naturally set us a good example, has been too long an invalid to admit of it, and we girls have become habituated to the luxury of breakfasting in bed, from residence abroad and in the tropics.  Not that we breakfast in bed at the \"Villa Greeley,\" however; we are much too sociable, and our dining-room is too attractive, for that.   But we gratify our taste for reasonable hours by assembling around the table at half-past eight.  \"Shocking!\" I fancy I hear Katie exclaim.  \"I breakfast _at least_ two hours earlier.  How can you bear to lose so much of the beautiful morning?\"  Don't imagine, dear Katie, that I _sleep_ till half-past eight: you must know the wakeful temperament of our family too well for that.  I find it, however, very poetic and delightful to listen to the matins of the robins, thrushes, and wrens, from my pillows; and by merely lifting my head I have as extended a panorama of swelling hills and emerald meadows, as though promenading the piazza.  I have been in my day as early a riser as any one--even you, dear Katie, have not surpassed me in this, respect; for you recollect those cold winter days when I arose at \"five o'clock in the morning,\" not, however, to meet Corydon, but to attack the Gradus ad Parnassum of Clementi by gaslight, in my desire to accomplish eight hours of practice undisturbed by visitors.  At seven, however, I used to meet with an interruption from my German professor.  Poor man!  I now pity his old rheumatic limbs stumbling over the ice and snow to be with me at that unreasonable hour of the morning.  But I then was ruthless, and would not allow him even five minutes grace, for my time was then regulated like clockwork, and a delay of a few moments would cause an unpardonable gap in my day.  Now, however, that my education is nominally finished, I feel that I may without self-reproach indulge in some extra moments of repose, for it is impossible for one to work _all_ the time; and a quiet hour of reflection is often, I think, as useful as continual reading or writing.  We indulge in very simple morning toilettes here, as we have no gentleman guests for whom to dress, nor ladies to criticise us; consequently a few brief moments before the mirror suffice to make us presentable.  A black print wrapper made Gabrielle-fashion, with our hair brushed off plain from our faces, and flowing loosely _à la belle sauvage_, or in cool braids, is the order of the day.  Even Marguerite, who is the most conventional of our quartette, has conformed to the fashion reigning here, and no longer coiffed in the stylish _Impératrice_ mode, her sunny brown hair floats over her shoulders unconfined by hair-pins, cushions, or rats.  Truly we live in Arcadian simplicity, for under our roof there are neither curling nor crimping irons, nor even a _soupçon_ of the most innocent _poudre de riz_.  At half-past eight a little hand-bell, silver in material and tone, summons us to the breakfast-room.  This room is on the ground floor, and is one of the prettiest in the house.  Four windows give us an extended view of our Dame Châtelaine's sloping meadows and wooded hills, and the carriage road winding off towards the pine grove and the house in the woods.  We have several pictures on the walls--first a portrait of my dear uncle; a boyish face with fair hair, deep blue eyes, and an expression angelic in sweetness.  No one would imagine it to be the face of a married man, but it was painted, mamma says, when he was thirty years old.  Two large and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18297"],["title","The Story of a Summer (#2)"],["body","photographs, taken early last summer, hang opposite it.  A striking contrast they are to the pensive, fragile, blonde boy; these are impressed with the vigor and mental and physical activity of his busy life, but the broad intellectual brow, and the almost divine expression that plays about the mouth, are the same in each.  An engraving from a picture by Paul Delaroche, the Archangel Gabriel--the \"patron,\" in Catholic parlance, of our little Gabrielle--hangs between the windows, and over the comfortable sofa is a copy of Liotard's celebrated pastel \"la belle Chocolatière\" in the Dresden Gallery.  This copy Aunt Mary bought in that city when there some years ago, and it is considered wonderfully fine.  Very pretty and coquettish she looks in her picturesque Vienna dress, with the small, neatly-fitting cap, ample apron, and tiny Louis Quinze shoes.  In her case    \"My face is my fortune,\"  was exemplified, and so pretty and modest is her demeanor that it is no wonder that Count Dietrichstein, haughty nobleman though he was, married her.  She is very different, however, from the chocolate vendors whom I have seen in the streets of Paris.  I don't think a nobleman would ever raise one of them from their original station, for they are as a rule past fifty, and ugly and withered as only a Frenchwoman of that age can be.  Breakfast is followed by a turn upon the piazza, a little stroll to the spring, near which delicious wild strawberries nestle in a background of sweet clover, bright buttercups, and field daisies, or a game of croquet under the grand old oak-trees    \"After the sun has dried the dew.\"  Then we separate, each to our own room, and our different occupations.  [Illustration: The Spring.]  Ida is very busy now, for she is preparing a volume for publication in the fall--her dear father's manuscript lectures and letters.  Gabrielle throws herself upon a sofa, and lies there motionless, absorbed in the fascinating pages of some favorite book; indeed, she is so quiet that in my periodical fits of tidiness I often seize a print or bombazine frock, thrown, as I suppose, carelessly upon the bed or sofa, and only by its weight do I discover that it is animated.  Last year, Gabrielle's favorite site for reading was in the dear old apple-tree close beside the house; but since she has attained the dignity of sixteen and train dresses, she has abjured the apple-tree.  Marguerite is translating a volume from the German, _Musikalische Märchen_, and I divide my time between the piano and occasional newspaper articles.  But it is already one o'clock and dinner hour.  The afternoon passes much like the morning.  We have letters to write, and much reading aloud.  I have two books in progress--Plato's \"Dialogues,\" and Madame de Stäel's incomparable \"Germany:\" the latter I read aloud while in Munich, but it is a work that cannot be too often studied.  At half-past six we dress and go down to the postoffice (about a hundred yards distant) for the evening mail.  Half an hour later we sup, and then follows, as L. E. L. would say, \"a struggle and a sacrifice.\"  What could be more delicious than a game of croquet, or a drive in the cool twilight?  But Chappaqua, lovely though it is, possesses a malaria that is dangerous after sunset, they say, and much as I love to drive when Nature is bathed in the last ruddy flush of day, and during the soft gray hour that succeeds it, I must heed the prediction of _chills_ to all who indulge.  The evening is always devoted to music.  Both Ida and Gabrielle are very fond of the piano, and Ida is rapidly becoming quite proficient in the divine art.  She commenced the study of music when a little child, under an excellent teacher, and also took lessons while in boarding-school; but one studies the piano under difficulties while in the routine of a _pensionnat_, for the hour devoted to it must be taken from one's recreation time, or from some other lessons.  Our friends will remember, too, that dear Ida was taken out of school while yet very young, to become the devoted nurse that she has since shown herself to her mother, and from the time she left the _Sacré Coeur_ until this spring she has never opened the piano.  Now, however, she practises regularly and conscientiously, and brings to her music all the enthusiasm of her loving nature, and the intelligence of her superior mind; consequently, when her fingers are well trained, I shall expect to see her a thoughtful and brilliant pianist.  Gabrielle is still in the tedious preliminary steps, for Geometry and Latin, rather than the _Rhythme des Doigts_ and the _Ecole de la Velocité_, have hitherto engaged her attention; but time will show.     CHAPTER III.  An Unexpected Visit--Morning Drives--Gabrielle's Ponies--A Repulsive Object--A Visitor--The King of Sweden's Soup--Advantages of a Royal Kitchen--Startling Experience--Ida's Letters--Strange Contents--A Lucky Stone--Bequest for a Melodeon--Offers of Marriage--Arrival of a Suitor--Reasons why he should marry Ida Greeley--He proves a Lunatic--He is taken before a Magistrate--He is lodged in the County Jail.   _June 5_.  As unexpected visit yesterday from Mr. O'Dwyer, a member of _The Tribune_ staff, and for several years dear uncle's private secretary.  Mamma had invited Mr. O'Dwyer to come out and pass a quiet day with us, and had appointed Wednesday for the visit.  Desirous of a little excitement, and already somewhat weary of our nun-like simplicity of toilette, we decided to do honor to our guest by dressing our hair quite elaborately, and attiring ourselves, despite the heat, in our best bombazines with their weight of crape.  We were assembled in the dining-room after our early dinner, discussing, in our plain print wrappers and Marguerite braids, our plans for the morrow, when Minna announced:  \"A visit, Madame; a gentleman.\"  \"Probably a neighbor upon business,\" said mamma to us; \"show him in here, Minna.\"  The door opened, and enter the guest for whom, in imagination, we were making such extensive preparations.  A very expressive glance was telegraphed around our circle.  I was engaged in the domestic occupation of hemming one of papa's handkerchiefs, and although Hawthorne draws so pretty a picture of the beautiful Miriam while engaged in \"the feminine task of mending a pair of gloves,\" with all deference to the poet's taste, I consider the beguiling little scraps of canvas or kid which I produce when company is present, much more attractive than plain sewing.  In a moment the surprise was explained.  Mr. O'Dwyer had received orders to represent _The Tribune_ somewhere, the following day, just in time to catch the Pleasantville express, and run out to tell us that he could not come at the time appointed.  \"The circumstances were trying,\" we said to each other, after his departure; but imagine, girls, how much worse they would have been, had the visitor been a lady!  As long as a wrapper is black, I very much doubt if a gentleman would know it from an afternoon dress.   _June 8_.  The usual routine of our morning occupations has been somewhat broken of late, for these June days are too perfect to be spent within doors, even with such grand companions as Plato or Beethoven.  We plan charming hours to be spent in the pine grove, where Marguerite will read to us a chapter or two of Kohlrausch's \"Germany,\" and Ida will give us a few pages of Taine's brilliant \"Angleterre;\" but as we are starting with camp chairs, books, and work, Bernard approaches:  \"Any orders, Miss?\"  Frail mortals are too weak to resist, and in a few moments we are seated in Ida's stylish new phaeton; and Gabrielle's irrepressible ponies, under the guidance of Tourbillon herself, are dashing away at a pace that terrifies our sober Quaker neighbors beyond expression. Mamma has been solemnly warned against allowing Gabrielle to drive \"those fearful horses;\" but we all share our pretty Tourbillon's fondness for a _tourbillon_ pace, and know well the strength she possesses in her little wrists, and the coolness she could exercise were there any danger.  While returning from a charming drive upon the Sing Sing road, a day or two since, the horses, whose spirits were unusually high, shied suddenly at something dark by the roadside.  By a dexterous management of the reins, Gabrielle quickly subdued them, and we all looked to see what had startled them.  An object was crouching in the grass, evidently human, but of what sex or nationality it was impossible in one swift glance to determine; and it was quite amusing to hear our different opinions as we drove on.  \"I think,\" said mamma, \"that it was an enormous woman, with a baby in her arms, but I really cannot be sure, for I only looked at the face--such a hideous, repulsive face.  I shall dream of it to-night, I am convinced.\"  \"A woman!\" said Marguerite.  \"My impression was of a very murderous-looking man--an Indian, I thought, he was so very dark.\"  Gabrielle's view of the case differed from the others.  The creature had, she said, a heavy black beard, which, was un-Indian-like, and was garbed in a dark calico gown with open sleeves, through which she plainly perceived a pair of unmistakably muscular, masculine arms.  In the words of Macbeth--        \"You should be woman,   And yet your beard forbids me to interpret   That you are so.\"  Neither Marguerite nor Gabrielle had seen the baby, and Gabrielle's conclusion that this frightful being was a convict who had escaped from Sing Sing disguised as a woman, was quite logical.  \"Chappaqua is certainly in unpleasant proximity to Sing Sing,\" I said with a shudder, for I have not many elements of a heroine about me.  \"Yes,\" was mamma's cheerful rejoinder, \"and you know we were told yesterday that one or two of the most dangerous convicts had recently escaped, and had entered several houses in Chappaqua--to say nothing of Mr. O'Dwyer's report that that dreadful Captain Jack has escaped, and is known to be lurking in the"]]]
