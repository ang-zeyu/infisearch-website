He rose with shining eyes and held out his hand. “I don't know, seh, but I'll try damned hard to do three things: find out what has become of the little girl, of Dave Henderson, and of the scoundrel who stole your baby because he thought the map was in the pocket.”  “You mean that you don't think Dave--”  “That is exactly what I mean. Your cook, Anderson, kidnapped the child, looks like to me. I saw that locket Collins found. My guess was that the marks on the end of the chain were deep teeth marks. The man that stole your baby tried first to cut the chain with his teeth so as to steal the chain. You see, he could not find the clasp in the dark. Then the child wakened and began to cry. He clapped a hand over its mouth and carried the little girl out of the room. Then he heard somebody moving about, lost his nerve, and jumped on the horse that was waiting, saddled, at the door. He took the child along simply because he had to in order to get the chain and the secret he thought it held.”  “Perhaps; but that does not prove it was not Dave.”  “It's contributory evidence, seh. Your friend could have slipped the chain from her neck any day, or he could have opened the locket and taken the map. No need for him to steal in at night. Do you happen to remember whether your little girl had any particular aversion to the cook?”  The cattleman's forehead frowned in thought. “I do remember, now, that she was afraid of him. She always ran screaming to her mother when he tried to be friendly with her. He was a sour sort of fellow.”  “That helps out the case a heap, for it shows that he wanted to make friends with her and she refused. He was thus forced to take the chain when she was asleep instead of playing with her till he had discovered the spring and could simply take the map.”  “But he didn't know anything about the map. He was not in our confidence.”  “You and your friend talked it over evenings when he was at the ranch, and other places, too, I expect.”  “Yes, our talk kind of gravitated that way whenever we got together.”  “Well, this fellow overheard you. That's probable, at least.”  “But you're ignoring the important fact. Dave disappeared too that night, with my little girl.”  Bucky cut in sharply with a question. “Did he? How do you know he disappeared WITH her? Why not AFTER? That's the theory my mind is groping on just now.”  “That's a blind trail to me. Why AFTER? And what difference does it make?”  “All the difference in the world. If he left after the cook, you have been doing him an injustice for fifteen years, seh.”  Mackenzie leaned forward, excitement burning in his eyes. “Prove that, young man, and I'll thank you to the last day of my life. It's for my wife's sake more than my own I want my little girl back. She jes' pines for her every day of her life. But for my friend--if you can give me back the clean memory of Dave you'll have done a big thing for me, Mr. O'Connor.”  “It's only a working theory, but this is what I'm getting at. You and Henderson had arranged to take an early start on a two days' deer hunt next mo'ning. That's what you told me, isn't it?”  “We were to start about four. Yes, sir.”  “Well, let's suppose a case. Along comes Dave before daybreak, when the first hooters were beginning to call. Just as he reaches your ranch he notices a horse slipping away in the darkness. Perhaps he hears the little girl cry out. Anyhow, instead of turning in at the gate, he decides to follow. Probably he isn't sure there's anything wrong, but when he finds out how the horse he's after is burning the wind his suspicions grow stronger. He settles down to a long chase. In the darkness, we'll say, he loses his man, but when it gets lighter he picks up the trail again. The tracks lead south, across the line into Mexico. Still he keeps plodding on. The man in front sees him behind and gets scared because he can't shake him off. Very likely he thinks it is you on his track. Anyhow, while the child is asleep he waits in ambush, and when Henderson rides up he shoots him down. Then he pushes on deeper into Chihuahua, and proceeds to lose himself there by changing his name.”  “You think he murdered Dave?” The cattleman got up and began to pace up and down the floor.  “I think it possible.”  Webb Mackenzie's face was pallid, but there was a new light of hope in it. “I believe you're right. God knows I hope so. That may sound a horrible thing to say of my best friend, but if it has got to be one or the other--if it is certain that my old bunkie came to his death foully in Chihuahua while trying to save my baby, or is alive to-day, a skulking coward and villain--with all my heart I hope he is dead.” He spoke with a passionate intensity which showed how much he had cared for his early friend, and how much the latter's apparent treachery had cut him. “I hope you'll never have a friend go back on you, Mr. O'Connor, the one friend you would have banked on to a finish. Why, Dave Henderson saved my life from a bunch of Apaches once when it was dollars to doughnuts he would lose his own if he tried it. We were prospecting in the Galiuros together, and one mo'ning when he went down to the creek to water the hawsses he sighted three of the red devils edging up toward the cabin. There might have been fifty of them there for all he knew, and he had a clear run to the plains if he wanted to back one of the ponies and take it. Most any man would have saved his own skin, but not Dave. He hoofed it back to the cabin, under fire every foot of the way, and together we made it so hot for them that they finally gave up getting us. We were in the Texas Rangers together, and pulled each other through a lot of close places. And then at the end--Why, it hurt me more than it did losing my own little girl.”  Bucky nodded. Since he was a man and not a father, he could understand how the hurt would rankle year after year at the defalcation of his comrade.  “That's another kink we have got to unravel in this tangle. First off, there's your little girl, to find if she is still alive. Second, we must locate Dave Henderson or his grave. Third, there's something due the scoundrel who is responsible for this. Fourthly, brethren, there's that map section to find. And lastly, we've got to find just how this story you've told me got mixed with the story of the holdup of the Limited. For it ce'tainly looks as if the two hang together. I take it that the thing to do is to run down the gang that held up the Limited. Once we do that, we ought to find the key to the mystery of your little girl's disappearance. Or, at least, there is a chance we shall. And it's chances we've got to gamble on in this thing.”  “Good enough. I like the way you go at this. Already I feel a heap better than I did.”  “If the cards fall our way you're going to get this thing settled once for all. I can't promise my news will be good news when I get it, but anything will be better than the uncertainty you've been in, I take it,”  said Bucky, rising from his chair.  “You're right there. But, wait a moment. Let's drink to your success.”  “I'm not much of a sport,” Bucky smiled. “Fact is, I never drink, seh.”  “Of course. I remember, now. You're the good bad man of the West,”  Mackenzie answered amiably. “Well, I drink to you. Here's good hunting, lieutenant.”  “Thank you.”  “I suppose you'll get right at this thing?”  “I've got to take that kid in the next room out to my ranch first. I won't stand for that knife thrower making a slave of him.”  “What's the matter with me taking the boy out to the Rocking Chair with me? My wife and I will see he's looked after till you return.”  “That would be the best plan, if it won't trouble you too much. We'd better keep his whereabouts quiet till this fellow Hardman is out of the country.”  “Yes, though I hardly think he'd be fool enough to show up at the Rocking Chair. If my vaqueros met up with him prowling around they might show him as warm a welcome as you did half an hour ago.”  “A chapping would sure do him a heap of good,” grinned Bucky, and so dismissed the Champion of the World from his mind.    CHAPTER 5. BUCKY ENTERTAINS  Bucky began at once to tap the underground wires his official position made accessible to him. These ran over Southern Arizona, Sonora, and Chihuahua. All the places to which criminals or frontiersmen with money were wont to resort were reported upon. For the ranger's experience had taught him that since the men he wanted had money in their pockets to burn gregarious impulse would drive them from the far silent places of the desert to the roulette and faro tables where the wolf and the lamb disport themselves together.  The photograph from Webb Mackenzie of the cook Anderson reached him at Tucson the third day after his interview with that gentleman, at the same time that Collins dropped in on him to inquire what progress he was making.  O'Connor told him of the Aravaipa episode, and tossed across the table to him the photograph he had just received.  “If we could discover the gent that sat for this photo it might help us. You don't by any chance know him, do you, Val?”  The sheriff shook his head. “Not in my rogues' gallery, Bucky.”  The ranger again examined the faded picture. A resemblance in it to somebody he had met recently haunted vaguely his memory. As he looked the indefinite suggestion grew sharp and clear. It was a photograph of the showman who had called himself Hardman. All the trimmings were lacking, to be sure--the fierce mustache, the long hair, the buckskin trappings, none of them were here. But beyond a doubt it was the same shifty-eyed villain. Nor did it shake Bucky's confidence that Mackenzie had seen him and failed to recognize the man as his old cook. The fellow was thoroughly disguised, but the camera had happened to catch that curious furtive glance of his. But for that O'Connor would never have known the two to be the same.

It wuz a beautiful evenin' in Jonesville, and the World. The Earth wuz a-settin' peaceful and serene under the glowin' light of a full moon and some stars, and I sot jest as peaceful and calm under the meller light of our hangin' lamp and the blue radiance of my companion's two orbs.  Two arm-chairs covered with handsome buff copper-plate wuz drawed up on each side of the round table, that had a cheerful spread on't, and a basket of meller apples and pears.  Dick Swiveller, our big striped pussy-cat (Thomas J. named him), lay stretched out in luxurious ease on his cushion, a-watchin' with dignified indulgence the gambollin' of our little pup dog. He is young yet, and Dick looked lenient on the innocent caperin's of youth.  Dick is very wise.  The firelight sparkled on the clean hearth, the lamplight gleamed down onto my needles as I sot peaceful a-seamin' two and two, and the same radiance rested lovin'ly on the shinin' bald head of my pardner as he sot a-readin' his favorite production, the _World_.  All wuz relapsted into silence, all wuz peace, till all to once my pardner dropped his paper, and sez he--  \"Samantha, why not write a book on't?\"  It started me, comin' so onexpected onto me, and specially sence he wuz always so sot aginst my swingin' out in Literatoor.  I dropped two or three stitches in my inward agitation, but instinctively I catched holt of my dignity, and kep calm on the outside.  And sez I, \"Write a book on what, Josiah Allen?\"  \"Oh, about the World's Fair!\" sez he.  \"Wall,\" sez I, with a deep sithe, \"I had thought on't, but I'd kinder dreaded the job.\"  And he went on: \"You know,\" sez he, \"that We wrote one about the other big Fair, and if We don't do as well by this one it'll make trouble,\" sez he.  \"We!\" sez I in my own mind, and in witherin' axents, but I kep calm on the outside, and he went on--  \"Our book,\" sez he, \"that We wrote on the other big Fair in Filadelfy, I spoze wuz thought as much on and wuz as popular for family readin' as ever a President's message wuz; and after payin' attention to that as We did, We hadn't ort to slight this one. We can't afford to,\" sez he.  \"Can't afford to?\" sez I dreamily.  \"No; We can't afford to,\" sez he, \"and keep Our present popularity. Now, there's every chance, so fur as I can see, for me to be elected Path-Master, and the high position of Salesman of the Jonesville Cheese Factory has been as good as offered to me agin this year. It is because We are popular,\" sez he, \"that I have these positions of trust and honor held out to me. We have wrote books that have _took_, Samantha. Now, what would be the result if We should slight Columbus and turn Our backs onto America in this crisis of her history? It would be simply ruinous to Our reputation and my official aspirations. Everybody would be mad, and kick, from the President down. More'n as likely as not I should never hold another office in Jonesville. Cheese would be sold right over my head by I know not who. I should be ordered out to work on the road like a dog by Ury jest as like as not. I've been a-settin' here and turnin' it over in my mind; and though, as you say, I hain't always favored the idee of writin', still at the present time I believe We'd better write the book. There's ink in the house, hain't there?\" sez he anxiously.  \"Yes,\" sez I.  \"And paper?\" sez he.  Agin I sez, \"Yes.\"  \"Wall, then, when there's ink and paper, what's to hender Our writin' it?\"  \"Our!\" \"We!\" Agin them words entered my soul like lead arrows and gaulded me, but agin I looked up, and the clear light of affection that shone from my pardner's eyes melted them arrows, and I suffered and wuz calm. But anon I sez--  \"Don't great emotions rise up in your soul, Josiah Allen, when you think of Columbus and the World's work? Don't the mighty waves of the past and the future dash up aginst your heart when you think of Christopher, and what he found, and what is behind this nation, and what is in front of it, a-bagonin' it onwards?\"  \"No,\" sez he calmly; \"I look at it with the eye of a business man, and with that eye,\" sez he, \"I say less write the book.\"  He ceased his remarks, and agin silence rained in the room.  But to me the silence wuz filled with voices that he couldn't hear--deep, prophetic voices that shook my soul. Eyes whose light the dust fell on four hundred years ago shone agin on me in that quiet room in Jonesville, and hanted me. Heroic hands that wuz clay centuries ago bagoned to me to foller 'em where they led me. And so on down through the centuries the viewless hosts passed before me and gin me the silent countersign to let me pass into their ranks and jine the army. And then, away out into the future, the Shadow Host defiled--fur off, fur off--into the age of Freedom, and Justice, and Perfect rights for man and woman, Love, Joy, Peace.  Josiah didn't see none of these performances.  No; two pardners may set side by side, and yet worlds lay between 'em. He wuz agin immersed in his ambitious reveries.  I didn't tell him the heft or the size of my emotions as I mentally tackled the job he proposed to me--there wuzn't no use on't. I only sez, as I looked up at him over my specs--  \"Josiah, We will write the book.\"     SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR.     CHAPTER I.   [Illustration: Drop Capital]  Christopher Columbus has always been a object of extreme interest and admiration to me ever sence I first read about him in my old Olney's Gography, up to the time when I hearn he wuz a-goin' to be celebrated in Chicago.  I always looked up to Christopher, I always admired him, and in a modest and meetin'-house sense, I will say boldly and with no fear of Josiah before my eyes that I loved him.  Havin' such feelin's for Christopher Columbus, as I had, and havin' such feelin's for New Discoverers, do you spoze I wuz a-goin' to have a celebration gin for him, and also for us as bein' discovered by him, without attendin' to it?  No, indeed! I made calculations ahead from the very first minute it wuz spoke on, to attend to it.  And feelin' as I did--all wrought up on the subject of Christopher Columbus--it wuz a coincerdence singular enough to skair anybody almost to death--to think that right on the very day Christopher discovered America, and us (only 400 years later), and on the very day that I commenced the fine shirt that Josiah wuz a-goin' to wear to Chicago to celebrate him in--  That very Friday, if you'll believe me, Christopher Columbus walked right into our kitchen at Jonesville--and discovered me.  [Illustration: If you'll believe me, Christopher Columbus Allen walked right into our kitchen--and discovered me.]  Yes, Christopher Columbus Allen, a relative I never had seen, come to Jonesville and our house on his way to the World's Fair.  Jest to think on't--Christopher Columbus Allen, who had passed his hull life up in Maine, and then descended down onto us at such a time as this, when all the relations in Jonesville wuz jest riz up about the doin's of that great namesake of hisen--And the gussets wuz even then a-bein' cut out and sewed on to the shirt that wuz a-goin' to encompass Josiah Allen about as he went to Chicago to celebrate him--  That then, on that Friday, P.M., about the time of day that the Injuns wuz a-kneelin' to the first Christopher, to think that Josiah Allen should walk in the new Columbus into our kitchen--why, I don't spoze a more singular and coincidin' circumstance ever happened before durin' the hull course of time.  The only incident that mellered it down any and made it a little less miracalous wuz the fact that he never had been called by his full name.  He always has been, is now, and I spoze always will be called Krit--Krit Allen.  But still it wuz--in spite of this mellerin' and amelioratin' circumstance--strikin' and skairful enough to fill me with or.  He wuz a double and twisted relation, as you may say, bein' related to us on both our own sides, Josiah's and mine.  But I had never sot eyes on him till that day, though I well remember visitin' his parents, who lived then in the outskirts of Loontown--good respectable Methodist Epospical people--and runners of a cheese factory at that time.  Tryphenia Smith, relation on my side, married to Ezra Allen, relation on Josiah's side.  I remember that I went there on a visit with my mother at a very early period of my existence. I hadn't existed at that time more'n nine years, if I had that. We staid there on a stiddy stretch for a week; that wuz jest before they moved up to Maine.  Uncle Ezra had a splendid chance offered him there, and he fell in with it.  She wuz a dretful good creeter, Aunt Tryphenia wuz, and greatly beloved by the relations on his side, as well as hern.  Though, as is nateral with relations, she had to be run by 'em more or less, and found fault with. Some thought her nose wuz too long. Some on 'em thought she wuz too religious, and some on 'em thought she wuzn't religious enough. Some on 'em thought she wuzn't sot enough on the creeds, and some thought she wuz too rigid.  But, howsumever, pretty nigh all the Allens and Smiths jest doted on her.  There wuz one incident that jest impressed itself on my memory in connection with that visit, and I don't spoze I shall ever forgit it; it stands to reason that I should before now, if I ever wuz a-goin' to.  It took place at family prayers, which they held regular at Uncle Ezra's.  It wuz right in"]]]
