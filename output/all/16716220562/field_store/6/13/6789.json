Therewith from out the thicket the grey wolves drew anigh,     And the he-wolf fell on Sigi, but he gave forth never a cry,     And I saw his lips that they smiled, and his steady eyes for a space;     And therewith was the she-wolf's muzzle thrust into my very face.     The Gods helped not, but I helped; and I too grew wolfish then;     Yea I, who have borne the sword-hilt high mid the kings of men,     I, lord of the golden harness, the flame of the Glittering Heath,     Must snarl to the she-wolf's snarling, and snap with greedy teeth,     While my hands with the hand-bonds struggled; my teeth took hold the       first     And amid her mighty writhing the bonds that bound me burst,     As with Fenrir's Wolf it shall be: then the beast with the hopples I       smote,     When my left hand stiff with the bonds had got her by the throat.     But I turned when I had slain her, and there lay Sigi dead,     And once more to the night of the forest the fretting wolf had fled.     In the thicket I hid till the dawning, and thence I saw the men,     E'en Siggeir's heart-rejoicers, come back to the place again     To gather the well-loved tidings: I looked and I knew for sooth     How hate had grown in my bosom and the death of my days of ruth:     Though unslain they departed from me, lest Siggeir come to doubt.     But hereafter, yea hereafter, they that turned the world about,     And raised Hell's abode o'er God-home, and mocked all men-folk's       worth--     Shall my hand turn back or falter, while these abide on earth,     Because I once was a child, and sat on my father's knees;     But long methinks shall Siggeir bide merrily at ease     In the high-built house of the Goths, with his shielded earls around,     His warders of day and of night-tide, and his world of peopled ground,     While his foe is a swordless outcast, a hunted beast of the wood,     A wolf of the holy places, where men-folk gather for good.     And didst thou think, my sister, when we sat in our summer bliss     Beneath the boughs of the Branstock, that the world was like to this?\"      As the moon and the twilight mingled, she stood with kindling eyes,     And answered and said: \"My brother, thou art strong, and thou shalt       be wise:     I am nothing so wroth as thou art with the ways of death and hell,     For thereof had I a deeming when all things were seeming well.     In sooth overlong it may linger; the children of murder shall thrive,     While thy work is a weight for thine heart, and a toil for thy hand       to drive;     But I wot that the King of the Goth-folk for his deeds shall surely       pay,     And that I shall live to see it: but thy wrath shall pass away,     And long shalt thou live on the earth an exceeding glorious king,     And thy words shall be told in the market, and all men of thy deeds       shall sing:     Fresh shall thy memory be, and thine eyes like mine shall gaze     On the day unborn in the darkness, the last of all earthly days,     The last of the days of battle, when the host of the Gods is arrayed     And there is an end for ever of all who were once afraid.     There as thou drawest thy sword, thou shalt think of the days that       were,     And the foul shall still seem foul, and the fair shall still seem fair;     But thy wit shall then be awakened, and thou shalt know indeed     Why the brave man's spear is broken, and his war-shield fails at need;     Why the loving is unbelov√®d; why the just man falls from his state;     Why the liar gains in a day what the soothfast strives for late.     Yea, and thy deeds shalt thou know, and great shall thy gladness be;     As a picture all of gold thy life-days shalt thou see,     And know that thou too wert a God to abide through the hurry and haste;     A God in the golden hall, a God on the rain-swept waste,     A God in the battle triumphant, a God on the heap of the slain:     And thine hope shall arise and blossom, and thy love shall be       quickened again:     And then shalt thou see before thee the face of all earthly ill;     Thou shalt drink of the cup of awakening that thine hand hath holpen       to fill;     By the side of the sons of Odin shalt thou fashion a tale to be told     In the hall of the happy Baldur: nor there shall the tale grow old     Of the days before the changing, e'en those that over us pass.     So harden thine heart, O brother, and set thy brow as the brass!     Thou shalt do, and thy deeds shall be goodly, and the day's work       shall be done     Though nought but the wild deer see it. Nor yet shalt thou be alone     For ever-more in thy waiting; for belike a fearful friend     The long days for thee may fashion, to help thee ere the end.     But now shalt thou bide in the wild-wood, and make thee a lair therein:     Thou art here in the midst of thy foemen, and from them thou well       mayst win     Whatso thine heart desireth; yet be thou not too bold,     Lest the tale of the wood-abider too oft to the king be told.     Ere many days are departed again shall I see thy face,     That I may wot full surely of thine abiding-place     To send thee help and comfort; but when that hour is o'er     It were good, O last of the Volsungs, that I see thy face no more,     If so indeed it may be: but the Norns must fashion all,     And what the dawn hath fated on the hour of noon shall fall.\"      Then she kissed him and departed, for the day was nigh at hand,     And by then she had left the woodways green lay the horse-fed land     Beneath the new-born daylight, and as she brushed the dew     Betwixt the yellowing acres, all heaven o'erhead was blue.     And at last on that dwelling of Kings the golden sunlight lay,     And the morn and the noon and the even built up another day.       _Of the birth and fostering of Sinfiotli, Signy's Son._      So wrought is the will of King Siggeir, and he weareth Odin's sword     And it lies on his knees in the council and hath no other lord:     And he sendeth earls o'er the sea-flood to take King Volsung's land,     And those scattered and shepherdless sheep must come beneath his hand.     And he holdeth the milk-white Signy as his handmaid and his wife.     And nought but his will she doeth, nor raiseth a word of strife;     So his heart is praising his wisdom, and he deems him of most avail     Of all the lords of the cunning that teacheth how to prevail.      Now again in a half-month's wearing goes Signy into the wild,     And findeth her way by her wisdom to the dwelling of Volsung's child.     It was e'en as a house of the Dwarfs, a rock, and a stony cave.     In the heart of the midmost thicket by the hidden river's wave.     There Signy found him watching how the white-head waters ran,     And she said in her heart as she saw him that once more she had seen       a man.     His words were few and heavy, for seldom his sorrow slept,     Yet ever his love went with them; and men say that Signy wept     When she left that last of her kindred: yet wept she never more     Amid the earls of Siggeir, and as lovely as before     Was her face to all men's deeming: nor aught it changed for ruth,     Nor for fear nor any longing; and no man said for sooth     That she ever laughed thereafter till the day of her death was come.      So is Volsung's seed abiding in a rough and narrow home;     And wargear he gat him enough from the slaying of earls of men,     And gold as much as he would; though indeed but now and again     He fell on the men of the merchants, lest, wax he overbold,     The tale of the wood-abider too oft to the king should be told.     Alone in the woods he abided, and a master of masters was he     In the craft of the smithying folk; and whiles would the hunter see,     Belated amid the thicket, his forge's glimmering light,     And the boldest of all the fishers would hear his hammer benight.     Then dim waxed the tale of the Volsungs, and the word mid the       wood-folk rose     That a King of the Giants had wakened from amidst the stone-hedged       close,     Where they slept in the heart of the mountains, and had come adown       to dwell     In the cave whence the Dwarfs were departed, and they said: It is       aught but well     To come anigh to his house-door, or wander wide in his woods?     For a tyrannous lord he is, and a lover of gold and of goods.      So win the long years over, and still sitteth Signy there     Beside the King of the Goth-folk, and is waxen no less fair,     And men and maids hath she gotten who are ready to work her will,     For the worship of her fairness, and remembrance of her ill.      So it fell on a morn of springtide, as Sigmund sat on the sward     By that ancient house of the Dwarf-kind and fashioned a golden sword?     By the side of the hidden river he saw a damsel stand,     And a manchild of ten summers was holding by her hand.     And she cried:                   \"O Forest-dweller! harm not the child nor me,     For I bear a word of Signy's, and thus she saith to thee:     'I send thee a man to foster; if his heart be good at need     Then may he help thy workday; but hearken my words and heed;     If thou deem that his heart shall avail not, thy work is over-great     That thou weary thy heart with such-like: let him wend the ways of       his fate.'\"      And no more word spake the maiden, but turned and gat her gone,     And there by the side of the river the child abode alone:     But Sigmund stood on his feet, and across the river he went.     For he knew how the child was Siggeir's, and of Signy's fell intent.     So he took the lad on his shoulder, and bade him hold his sword,     And waded back to his dwelling across the rushing ford:     But the youngling fell a prattling, and asked of this and that,     As above the rattle of waters on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18328"],["title","The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs (#6)"],["body","d's shoulder he sat!     And Sigmund deemed in his heart that the boy would be bold enough.     So he fostered him there in the woodland in life full hard and rough     For the space of three months' wearing; and the lad was deft and       strong,     Yet his sight was a grief to Sigmund because of his father's wrong.      On a morn to the son of King Siggeir Sigmund the Volsung said:     \"I go to the hunting of deer, bide thou and bake our bread     Against I bring the venison.\"                                   So forth he fared on his way,     And came again with the quarry about the noon of day;     Quoth he: \"Is the morn's work done?\" But the boy said nought for a       space,     And all white he was and quaking as he looked on Sigmund's face.      \"Tell me, O Son of the Goth-king,\" quoth Sigmund, \"how thou hast fared?     Forsooth, is the baking of bread so mighty a thing to be dared?\"      Quoth the lad: \"I went to the meal-sack, and therein was something       quick,     And it moved, and I feared for the serpent, like a winter ashen stick     That I saw on the stone last even: so I durst not deal with the thing.\"      Loud Sigmund laughed, and answered: \"I have heard of that son of a       king,     Who might not be scared from his bread for all the worms of the land.\"     And therewith he went to the meal-sack and thrust therein his hand,     And drew forth an ash-grey adder, and a deadly worm it was:     Then he went to the door of the cave and set it down in the grass,     While the King's son quaked and quivered: then he drew forth his       sword from the sheath,     And said:               \"Now fearest thou this, that men call the serpent of death?\"      Then said the son of King Siggeir: \"I am young as yet for the war,     Yet e'en such a blade shall I carry ere many a month be o'er.\"      Then abroad went the King in the wind, and leaned on his naked sword     And stood there many an hour, and mused on Signy's word.     But at last when the moon was arisen, and the undark night begun,     He sheathed the sword and cried: \"Come forth, King Siggeir's son,     Thou shalt wend from out of the wild-wood and no more will I foster       thee.\"      Forth came the son of Siggeir, and quaked his face to see,     But thereof nought Sigmund noted, but bade him wend with him.     So they went through the summer night-tide by many a wood-way dim,     Till they came to a certain wood-lawn, and Sigmund lingered there,     And spake as his feet brushed o'er it: \"The June flowers blossom fair.\"     So they came to the skirts of the forest, and the meadows of the neat,     And the earliest wind of dawning blew over them soft and sweet:     There stayed Sigmund the Volsung, and said:                                                 \"King Siggeir's son,     Bide here till the birds are singing, and the day is well begun;     Then go to the house of the Goth-king, and find thou Signy the Queen,     And tell unto no man else the things thou hast heard and seen:     But to her shalt thou tell what thou wilt, and say this word withal:     'Mother, I come from the wild-wood, and he saith, whatever befal     Alone will I abide there, nor have such fosterlings;     For the sons of the Gods may help me, but never the sons of Kings.'     Go, then, with this word in thy mouth--or do thou after thy fate,     And, if thou wilt, betray me!--and repent it early and late.\"      Then he turned his back on the acres, and away to the woodland strode;     But the boy scarce bided the sunrise ere he went the homeward road;     So he came to the house of the Goth-kings, and spake with Signy the       Queen,     Nor told he to any other the things he had heard and seen,     For the heart of a king's son had he.                                           But Signy hearkened his word;     And long she pondered and said: \"What is it my heart hath feared?     And how shall it be with earth's people if the kin of the Volsungs die,     And King Volsung unavenged in his mound by the sea-strand lie?     I have given my best and bravest, as my heart's blood I would give,     And my heart and my fame and my body, that the name of Volsung might       live.     Lo the first gift cast aback: and how shall it be with the last,--     --If I find out the gift for the giving before the hour be passed?\"      Long while she mused and pondered while day was thrust on day,     Till the king and the earls of the strangers seemed shades of the       dreamtide grey     And gone seemed all earth's people, save that woman mid the gold     And that man in the depths of the forest in the cave of the Dwarfs       of old.     And once in the dark she murmured: \"Where then was the ancient song     That the Gods were but twin-born once, and deemed it nothing wrong     To mingle for the world's sake, whence had the √Üsir birth,     And the Vanir and the Dwarf-kind, and all the folk of earth?\"      Now amidst those days that she pondered came a wife of the       witch-folk there,     A woman young and lovesome, and shaped exceeding fair,     And she spake with Signy the Queen, and told her of deeds of her craft,     And how the might was with her her soul from her body to waft     And to take the shape of another and give her fashion in turn.     Fierce then in the heart of Signy a sudden flame 'gan burn,     And the eyes of her soul saw all things, like the blind, whom the       world's last fire     Hath healed in one passing moment 'twixt his death and his desire.     And she thought: \"Alone I will bear it; alone I will take the crime;     On me alone be the shaming, and the cry of the coming time.     Yea, and he for the life is fated and the help of many a folk,     And I for the death and the rest, and deliverance from the yoke.\"      Then wan as the midnight moon she answered the woman and spake:     \"Thou art come to the Goth-queen's dwelling, wilt thou do so much       for my sake,     And for many a pound of silver and for rings of the ruddy gold,     As to change thy body for mine ere the night is waxen old?\"      Nought the witch-wife fair gainsaid it, and they went to the bower       aloft     And hand in hand and alone they sung the spell-song soft:     Till Signy looked on her guest, and lo, the face of a queen     With the steadfast eyes of grey, that so many a grief had seen:     But the guest held forth a mirror, and Signy shrank aback     From the laughing lips and the eyes, and the hair of crispy black,     But though she shuddered and sickened, the false face changed no whit;     But ruddy and white it blossomed and the smiles played over it;     And the hands were ready to cling, and beckoning lamps were the eyes,     And the light feet longed for the dance, and the lips for laughter       and lies.      So that eve in the mid-hall's high-seat was the shape of Signy the       Queen,     While swiftly the feet of the witch-wife brushed over the moonlit       green,     But the soul mid the gleam of the torches, her thought was of gain       and of gold;     And the soul of the wind-driven woman, swift-foot in the moonlight       cold,     Her thoughts were of men's lives' changing, and the uttermost ending       of earth,     And the day when death should be dead, and the new sun's nightless       birth.      Men say that about that midnight King Sigmund wakened and heard     The voice of a soft-speeched woman, shrill-sweet as a dawning bird;     So he rose, and a woman indeed he saw by the door of the cave     With her raiment wet to her midmost, as though with the river-wave:     And he cried: \"What wilt thou, what wilt thou? be thou womankind or       fay,     Here is no good abiding, wend forth upon thy way!\"      She said: \"I am nought but a woman, a maid of the earl-folk's kin:     And I went by the skirts of the woodland to the house of my sister       to win,     And have strayed from the way benighted: and I fear the wolves and       the wild     By the glimmering of thy torchlight from afar was I beguiled.     Ah, slay me not on thy threshold, nor send me back again     Through the rattling waves of thy ford, that I crossed in terror and       pain;     Drive me not to the night and the darkness, for the wolves of the       wood to devour.     I am weak and thou art mighty: I will go at the dawning hour.\"      So Sigmund looked in her face and saw that she was fair;     And he said: \"Nay, nought will I harm thee, and thou mayst harbour       here,     God wot if thou fear'st not me, I have nought to fear thy face:     Though this house be the terror of men-folk, thou shalt find it as       safe a place     As though I were nought but thy brother; and then mayst thou tell,       if thou wilt,     Where dwelleth the dread of the woodland, the bearer of many a guilt,     Though meseems for so goodly a woman it were all too ill a deed     In reward for the wood-wight's guesting to betray him in his need.\"      So he took the hand of the woman and straightway led her in     Where days agone the Dwarf-kind would their deeds of smithying win:     And he kindled the half-slaked embers, and gave her of his cheer     Amid the gold and the silver, and the fight-won raiment dear;     And soft was her voice, and she sung him sweet tales of yore agone,     Till all his heart was softened; and the man was all alone,     And in many wise she wooed him; so they parted not that night,     Nor slept till the morrow morning, when the woods were waxen bright:     And high above the tree-boughs shone the sister of the moon,     And hushed were the water-ouzels with the coming of the noon     When she stepped from the bed of Sigmund, and left the Dwarf's abode;     And turned to the dwellings of men, and the ways where the earl-folk       rode.     But next morn from the house of the Goth-king the witch-wife went       her ways     With gold and goods and silver, such store as a queen might praise.      But no long while with Sigmund dwelt remembrance of that"]]]
