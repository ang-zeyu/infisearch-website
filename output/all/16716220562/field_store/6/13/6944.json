He looked Dal over from the gray fur on the top of his head to the spindly legs in the ill-fitting trousers. Then the Blue Doctor shrugged in disgust and turned back to the tape-reader. \"A Garvian and his Fuzzy!\" he muttered. \"Let's hope one or the other knows something about surgery.\"  \"I think we'll do all right,\" Dal said slowly.  \"I think you'd better,\" Jack Alvarez replied.  Dal and Tiger looked at each other, and Tiger shrugged. \"It's all right,\" he said. \"We know our jobs, and we'll manage.\"  Dal nodded, and started back for the bunk room. No doubt, he thought, they would manage.  But if he had thought before that the assignment on the _Lancet_ was going to be easy, he knew now that he was wrong.  Tiger Martin may have been Doctor Arnquist's selection as a crewmate for him, but there was no question in his mind that the Blue Doctor on the _Lancet_'s crew was Black Doctor Hugo Tanner's choice.         *       *       *       *       *  The first meeting with Jack Alvarez hardly seemed promising to either Dal or Tiger, but if there was trouble coming, it was postponed for the moment by common consent. In the few days before blast-off there was no time for conflict, or even for much talk. Each of the three crewmen had two full weeks of work to accomplish in two days; each knew his job and buried himself in it with a will.  The ship's medical and surgical supplies had to be inventoried, and missing or required supplies ordered up. New supplies coming in had to be checked, tested, and stored in the ship's limited hold space. It was like preparing for an extended pack trip into wilderness country; once the _Lancet_ left its home base on Hospital Earth it was a world to itself, equipped to support its physician-crew and provide the necessary equipment and data they would need to deal with the problems they would face. Like all patrol ships, the _Lancet_ was equipped with automatic launching, navigation and drive mechanisms; no crew other than the three doctors was required, and in the event of mechanical failures, maintenance ships were on continual call.  The ship was responsible for patrolling an enormous area, including hundreds of stars and their planetary systems--yet its territory was only a tiny segment of the galaxy. Landings were to be made at various specified planets maintaining permanent clinic outposts of Hospital Earth; certain staple supplies were carried for each of these check points. Aside from these lonely clinic contacts, the nearest port of call for the _Lancet_ was one of the hospital ships that continuously worked slow orbits through the star systems of the confederation.  But a hospital ship, with its staff of Two-star and Three-star Physicians, was not to be called except in cases of extreme need. The probationers on the patrol ships were expected to be self-sufficient. Their job was to handle diagnosis and care of all but the most difficult problems that arose in their travels. They were the first to answer the medical calls from any planet with a medical service contract with Hospital Earth.  It was an enormous responsibility for doctors-in-training to assume, but over the years it had proven the best way to train and weed out new doctors for the greater responsibilities of hospital ship and Hospital Earth assignments. There was no set period of duty on the patrol ships; how long a young doctor remained in the General Practice Patrol depended to a large extent upon how well he handled the problems and responsibilities that faced him; and since the first years of Hospital Earth, the fledgling doctors in the General Practice Patrol--the self-styled \"Galactic Pill Peddlers\"--had lived up to their responsibilities. The reputation of Hospital Earth rested on their shoulders, and they never forgot it.  As he worked on his inventories, Dal Timgar thought of Doctor Arnquist's words to him after the council had handed down its decision. \"Remember that judgment and skill are two different things,\" he had said. \"Without skill in the basic principles of diagnosis and treatment, medical judgment isn't much help, but skill without the judgment to know how and when to use it can be downright dangerous. You'll be judged both on the judgment you use in deciding the right thing to do, and on the skill you use in doing it.\" He had given Dal the box with the coveted collar and cuff. \"The colors are pretty, but never forget what they stand for. Until you can convince the council that you have both the skill and the judgment of a good physician, you will never get your Star. And you will be watched closely; Black Doctor Tanner and certain others will be waiting for the slightest excuse to recall you from the _Lancet_. If you give them the opportunity, nothing I can do will stop it.\"  And now, as they worked to prepare the ship for service, Dal was determined that the opportunity would not arise. When he was not working in the storerooms, he was in the computer room, reviewing the thousands of tapes that carried the basic information about the contract planets where they would be visiting, and the races that inhabited them. If errors and fumbles and mistakes were made by the crew of the _Lancet_, he thought grimly, it would not be Dal Timgar who made them.  The first night they met in the control room to divide the many extracurricular jobs involved in maintaining a patrol ship.  Tiger's interest in electronics and communications made him the best man to handle the radio; he accepted the post without comment. \"Jack, you should be in charge of the computer,\" he said, \"because you'll be the one who'll need the information first. The lab is probably your field too. Dal can be responsible for stores and supplies as well as his own surgical instruments.\"  Jack shrugged. \"I'd just as soon handle supplies, too,\" he said.  \"Well, there's no need to overload one man,\" Tiger said.  \"I wouldn't mind that. But when there's something I need, I want to be sure it's going to be there without any goof-ups,\" Jack said.  \"I can handle it all right,\" Dal said.  Jack just scowled. \"What about the contact man when we make landings?\" he asked Tiger.  \"Seems to me Dal would be the one for that, too,\" Tiger said. \"His people are traders and bargainers; right, Dal? And first contact with the people on unfamiliar planets can be important.\"  \"It sure can,\" Jack said. \"Too important to take chances with. Look, this is a ship from Hospital Earth. When somebody calls for help, they expect to see an Earthman turn up in response. What are they going to think when a patrol ship lands and _he_ walks out?\"  Tiger's face darkened. \"They'll be able to see his collar and cuff, won't they?\"  \"Maybe. But they may wonder what he's doing wearing them.\"  \"Well, they'll just have to learn,\" Tiger snapped. \"And you'll have to learn, too, I guess.\"  Dal had been sitting silently. Now he shook his head. \"I think Jack is right on this one,\" he said. \"It would be better for one of you to be contact man.\"  \"Why?\" Tiger said angrily. \"You're as much of a doctor from Hospital Earth as we are, and the sooner we get your position here straight, the better. We aren't going to have any ugly ducklings on this ship, and we aren't going to hide you in the hold every time we land on a planet. If we want to make anything but a mess of this cruise, we've got to work as a team, and that means everybody shares the important jobs.\"  \"That's fine,\" Dal said, \"but I still think Jack is right on this point. If we are walking into a medical problem on a planet where the patrol isn't too well known, the contact man by rights ought to be an Earthman.\"  Tiger started to say something, and then spread his hands helplessly. \"Okay,\" he said. \"If you're satisfied with it, let's get on to these other things.\" But obviously he wasn't satisfied, and when Jack disappeared toward the storeroom, Tiger turned to Dal. \"You shouldn't have given in,\" he said. \"If you give that guy as much as an inch, you're just asking for trouble.\"  \"It isn't a matter of giving in,\" Dal insisted. \"I think he was right, that's all. Don't let's start a fight where we don't have to.\"  Tiger yielded the point, but when Jack returned, Tiger avoided him, keeping to himself the rest of the evening. And later, as he tried to get to sleep, Dal wondered for a moment. Maybe Tiger was right. Maybe he was just dodging a head-on clash with the Blue Doctor now and setting the stage for a real collision later.  Next day the argument was forgotten in the air of rising excitement as embarkation orders for the _Lancet_ came through. Preparations were completed, and only last-minute double-checks were required before blast-off.  But an hour before count-down began, a jitney buzzed across the field, and a Two-star Pathologist climbed aboard with his three black-cloaked orderlies. \"Shakedown inspection,\" he said curtly. \"Just a matter of routine.\" And with that he stalked slowly through the ship, checking the storage holds, the inventories, the lab, the computer with its information banks, and the control room. As he went along he kept firing medical questions at Dal and Tiger, hardly pausing long enough for the answers, and ignoring Jack Alvarez completely. \"What's the normal range of serum cholesterol in a vegetarian race with Terran environment? How would you run a Wenberg electrophoresis? How do you determine individual radiation tolerance? How would you prepare a heart culture for cardiac transplant on board this ship?\" The questions went on until Tiger and Dal were breathless, as count-down time grew closer and closer. Finally the Black Doctor turned back toward the entrance lock. He seemed vaguely disappointed as he checked the record sheets the orderlies had been keeping. With an odd look at Dal, he shrugged. \"All right, here are your clearance papers,\" he said to Jack. \"Your"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18492"],["title","Star Surgeon (#7)"],["body"," of serum globulin fractions is up to black-book requirements, but you'll run short if you happen to hit a virus epidemic; better take on a couple of more cases. And check central information just before leaving. We've signed two new contracts in the past week, and the co-ordinator's office has some advance information on both of them.\"  When the inspector had gone, Tiger wiped his forehead and sighed. \"That was no routine shakedown!\" he said. \"What _is_ a Wenberg electrophoresis?\"  \"A method of separating serum proteins,\" Jack Alvarez said. \"You ran them in third year biochemistry. And if we _do_ hit a virus epidemic, you'd better know how, too.\"  He gave Tiger an unpleasant smile, and started back down the corridor as the count-down signal began to buzz.  But for all the advance arrangements they had made to divide the ship's work, it was Dal Timgar who took complete control of the _Lancet_ for the first two weeks of its cruise. Neither Tiger nor Jack challenged his command; not a word was raised in protest. The Earthmen were too sick to talk, much less complain about anything.  For Dal the blast-off from the port of Seattle and the conversion into Koenig star-drive was nothing new. His father owned a fleet of Garvian trading ships that traveled to the far corners of the galaxy by means of a star-drive so similar to the Koenig engines that only an electronic engineer could tell them apart. All his life Dal had traveled on the outgoing freighters with his father; star-drive conversion was no surprise to him.  But for Jack and Tiger, it was their first experience in a star-drive ship. The _Lancet_'s piloting and navigation were entirely automatic; its destination was simply coded into the drive computers, and the ship was ready to leap across light years of space in a matter of hours. But the conversion to star-drive, as the _Lancet_ was wrenched, crew and all, out of the normal space-time continuum, was far outside of normal human experience. The physical and emotional shock of the conversion hit Jack and Tiger like a sledge hammer, and during the long hours while the ship was traveling through the time-less, distance-less universe of the drive to the pre-set co-ordinates where it materialized again into conventional space-time, the Earthmen were retching violently, too sick to budge from the bunk room. It took over two weeks, with stops at half a dozen contract planets, before Jack and Tiger began to adjust themselves to the frightening and confusing sensations of conversion to star-drive. During this time Dal carried the load of the ship's work alone, while the others lay gasping and exhausted in their bunks, trying to rally strength for the next shift.  To his horror, Dal discovered that the first planetary stop-over was traditionally a hazing stop. It had been a well-kept patrol secret; the outpost clinic on Tempera VI was waiting eagerly for the arrival of the new \"green\" crew, knowing full well that the doctors aboard would hardly be able to stumble out of their bunks, much less to cope with medical problems. The outpost men had concocted a medical \"crisis\" of staggering proportions to present to the _Lancet_'s crew; they were so clearly disappointed to find the ship's Red Doctor in full command of himself that Dal obligingly became violently ill too, and did his best to mimick Jack and Tiger's floundering efforts to pull themselves together and do _something_ about the \"problem\" that suddenly descended upon them.  Later, there was a party and celebration, with music and food, as the clinic staff welcomed the pale and shaken doctors into the joke. The outpost men plied Dal for the latest news from Hospital Earth. They were surprised to see a Garvian aboard the _Lancet_, but no one at the outpost showed any sign of resentment at the scarlet braid on Dal's collar and cuff.  Slowly Jack and Tiger got used to the peculiarities of popping in and out of hyperspace. It was said that immunity to star-drive sickness was hard to acquire, but lasted a lifetime, and would never again bother them once it was achieved. Bit by bit the Earthmen crept out of their shells, to find the ship in order and a busy Dal Timgar relieved and happy to have them aboard again.  Fortunately, the medical problems that came to the _Lancet_ in the first few weeks were largely routine. The ship stopped at the specified contact points--some far out near the rim of the galactic constellation, others in closer to the densely star-populated center. At each outpost clinic the _Lancet_ was welcomed with open arms. The outpost men were hungry for news from home, and happy to see fresh supplies; but they were also glad to review the current medical problems on their planets with the new doctors, exchanging opinions and arguing diagnosis and therapy into the small hours of the night.  Occasionally calls came in to the ship from contract planets in need of help. Usually the problems were easy to handle. On Singall III, a tiny planet of a cooling giant star, help was needed to deal with a new outbreak of a smallpox-like plague that had once decimated the population; the disease had finally been controlled after a Hospital Earth research team had identified the organism that caused it, determined its molecular structure, and synthesized an antibiotic that could destroy it without damaging the body of the host. But now a flareup had occurred. The _Lancet_ brought in supplies of the antibiotic, and Tiger Martin spent two days showing Singallese physicians how to control further outbreaks with modern methods of immunization and antisepsis.  Another planet called for a patrol ship when a bridge-building disaster occurred; one of the beetle-like workmen had been badly crushed under a massive steel girder. Dal spent over eighteen hours straight with the patient in the _Lancet_'s surgery, carefully repairing the creature's damaged exoskeleton and grafting new segments of bone for regeneration of the hopelessly ruined parts, with Tiger administering anaesthesia and Jack preparing the grafts from the freezer.  On another planet Jack faced his first real diagnostic challenge and met the test with flying colors. Here a new cancer-like degenerative disease had been appearing among the natives of the planet. It had never before been noted. Initial attempts to find a causative agent had all three of the _Lancet_'s crew spending sleepless nights for a week, but Jack's careful study of the pattern of the disease and the biochemical reactions that accompanied it brought out the answer: the disease was caused by a rare form of genetic change which made crippling alterations in an essential enzyme system. Knowing this, Tiger quickly found a drug which could be substituted for the damaged enzyme, and the problem was solved. They left the planet, assuring the planetary government that laboratories on Hospital Earth would begin working at once to find a way actually to rebuild the damaged genes in the embryonic cells, and thus put a permanent end to the disease.  These were routine calls, the kind of ordinary general medical work that the patrol ships were expected to handle. But the visits to the various planets were welcome breaks in the pattern of patrol ship life. The _Lancet_ was fully equipped, but her crew's quarters and living space were cramped. Under the best conditions, the crewmen on patrol ships got on each other's nerves; on the _Lancet_ there was an additional focus of tension that grew worse with every passing hour.  From the first Jack Alvarez had made no pretense of pleasure at Dal's company, but now it seemed that he deliberately sought opportunities to annoy him. The thin Blue Doctor's face set into an angry mold whenever Dal was around. He would get up and leave when Dal entered the control room, and complained loudly and bitterly at minor flaws in Dal's shipboard work. Nothing Dal did seemed to please him.  But Tiger had a worse time controlling himself at the Blue Doctor's digs and slights than Dal did. \"It's like living in an armed camp,\" he complained one night when Jack had stalked angrily out of the bunk room. \"Can't even open your mouth without having him jump down your throat.\"  \"I know,\" Dal said.  \"And he's doing it on purpose.\"  \"Maybe so. But it won't help to lose your temper.\"  Tiger clenched a huge fist and slammed it into his palm. \"He's just deliberately picking at you and picking at you,\" he said. \"You can't take that forever. Something's got to break.\"  \"It's all right,\" Dal assured him. \"I just ignore it.\"  But when Jack began to shift his attack to Fuzzy, Dal could ignore it no longer.  One night in the control room Jack threw down the report he was writing and turned angrily on Dal. \"Tell your friend there to turn the other way before I lose my temper and splatter him all over the wall,\" he said, pointing to Fuzzy. \"All he does is sit there and stare at me and I'm getting fed up with it.\"  Fuzzy drew himself up tightly, shivering on Dal's shoulder. Dal reached up and stroked the tiny creature, and Fuzzy's shoe-button eyes disappeared completely. \"There,\" Dal said. \"Is that better?\"  Jack stared at the place the eyes had been, and his face darkened suspiciously. \"Well, what happened to them?\" he demanded.  \"What happened to what?\"  \"To his eyes, you idiot!\"  Dal looked down at Fuzzy. \"I don't see any eyes.\"  Jack jumped up from the stool. He scowled at Fuzzy as if commanding the eyes to come back again. All he saw was a small ball of pink fur. \"Look, he's been blinking them at me for a week,\" he snarled. \"I thought all along there was something funny about him. Sometimes he's got legs and sometimes he hasn't. Sometimes he looks fuzzy, and other times he hasn't got any hair at all.\"  \"He's a pleomorph,\" Dal said. \"No cellular structure at all, just a protein-colloid matrix.\"  Jack glowered at the inert little pink lump. \"Don't be silly,\" he said, curious in spite of himself. \"What holds him together?\"  \"Who knows? I don't. Some"]]]
