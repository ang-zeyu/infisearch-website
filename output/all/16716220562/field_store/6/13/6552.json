M. C. A.     AND THE HUNDREDS OF PREACHER-SECRETARIES   WHO ARE SERVING SO BRAVELY AND EFFICIENTLY   ON THE CRUSADE OF SERVICE IN FRANCE   AND TO THE CHURCHES THAT SENT THEM     FOREWORD  Some human experiences that one has in France stand out like the silhouettes of mountain peaks against a crimson sunset.  I have tried in this book to set down some of those experiences.  I have had but one object in so doing, and that object has been to give the father and mother, the brother and sister, the wife and child and friend of the boys \"Over There\" an accurate heart-picture.  I have not attempted the too great task of showing the soul of the soldier, although I have tried to picture him at some of his great moments when he forgets himself and rises to glorious heights, just as he might do at home if the opportunity called.  I have tried to show his experiences on the transports, when he lands in France, his welcome there, the reactions of the trench life; something of his self-sacrifice, his willingness to serve even unto the end; his courage, his sunshine.  I have also given some other pictures of France that aim to show his heart-relations to his allies and to the folks at home.  If I have done this, sufficient shall be my reward.     CONTENTS      I.

I had the midnight-to-four-o'clock-in-the-morning \"watch\" and on this night I was on the \"aft fire-control.\"  Below me on the aft gun-deck, as the rain pounded, the wind howled, and the ship lurched to and fro, I could see the bulky forms of the boy gunners.  There were two to each gun, two standing by, with telephone pieces to their ears, and six sleeping on the deck, ready for any emergency.  The greatcoats made them look like gaunt men of the sea as they huddled against their guns, watching, waiting.  I wondered what they could see in that impenetrable darkness, if a U-boat could even survive in that storm; but Uncle Sam never sleeps in these days, and this transport was especially worth watching, for it carried a precious cargo of wounded officers and men back to the homeland, west bound.  For an hour I had heard no sound from the boys on the gun-deck below me.  When I was on watch in the daylight I knew them to be just a great crowd of fine, buoyant, happy American lads, full of pranks and play and laughter, but they were strangely silent to-night as the ship ploughed through the storm.  The storm seemed to have made men of them. They were just boys, but American boys in these days become men overnight, and acquit themselves like men.  I watched their silent forms below me with a great feeling of wonderment and pride.  The ship lurched as it swung in its zigzag course.  Then suddenly I heard a sweet sound coming from one of the boys below me.  I think that it was big, raw-boned \"Montana\" who started it.  It was low at first and, with the storm and the vibrations of the ship, I could not catch the words.  The music was strangely familiar to me.  Then the boy on the port gun beside \"Montana\" took the old hymn up, and then the two reserve gunners who were standing by, and then the gunners on the starboard side, and I caught the old words of:    \"Jesus, Saviour, pilot me   Over life's tempestuous sea;     Unknown waves before me roll     Hiding rock and treacherous shoal;   Chart and compass came from Thee;   Jesus, Saviour, pilot me.\"   Above the creaking and the vibrations of the great ship, above the beating of the storm, the gunners on the deck below, all unconsciously, in that storm-tossed night were singing the old hymn of their memories, and I think that I never heard that wonderful hymn when it sounded sweeter to me than it did then, as the second verse came sweetly from the lips and hearts of those gunners:    \"As a mother stills her child   Thou canst hush the ocean wild;     Boistrous waves obey Thy will     When Thou sayst to them, 'Be still.'   Wondrous Sovereign of the sea,   Jesus, Saviour, pilot me.\"   We hear a good deal of how our boys sing \"Hail!  Hail!  The Gang's All Here\" and \"Where Do We Go From Here, Boys?\" as a ship is sinking.  I know American soldiers pretty well.  I do not know what they sang when the _Tuscania_ went down, but I am glad to add my picture to the other and to say that I for one heard a crowd of American gunners singing \"Jesus, Saviour, Pilot Me Over Life's Tempestuous Sea.\"  The mothers and fathers of America must know that the average American boy will have the lighter songs at the end of his lips, but buried down deep in his heart there is a feeling of reverence for the old hymns, and whether he sings them aloud or not they are there singing in his heart; and sometimes, under circumstances such as I have described, he sings them aloud in the darkness and the storm.  If you do not believe this because you have been told so often by magazine correspondents, who see only the surface things, that all the boys sing is ragtime, let Bishop McConnell, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, tell you of that Sunday evening when, at the invitation of General Byng, he addressed, under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A., a great regiment of the Scottish Guards.  That night, in a shell-destroyed stone theatre, he spoke to them on \"How Men Die.\"  In a week from that night more than two-thirds of them had been killed. When Bishop McConnell asked them what they would like to sing, this great crowd of sturdy, bare-kneed soldiers of democracy, who had borne the brunt of battle for three years, asked for \"O God, Our Help in Ages Past.\"  Yes, I know that the boys sing the rag-time, but this must not be the only side of the picture.  They sing the old hymns, too, and memories of nights \"down the line,\" when I have heard them in small groups and in great crowds singing the old, old hymns of the church, have burned their silhouettes into my memory never to die.  One night I remember being stopped by a sentry at \"Dead Man's Curve,\" because the Boche was shelling the curve that night, and we had to stop until he \"laid off,\" as the sentry told us.  Between shells there was a great stillness on the white road that lay like a silver thread under the moonlight.  The shattered stone buildings, with a great cathedral tower standing like a gaunt ghost above the ruins, were tragically beautiful under that mellow light.  One almost forgot there was war under the charm of that scene until \"plunk! plunk! plunk!\" the big shells fell from time to time.  But the thing that impressed me most that waiting hour was not the beauty of the village under the moonlight, but the fact that the lone sentry who had stopped us, and who amid the shelling stood silently, was unconsciously singing an old hymn of the church, \"Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me.\"  I got down from my truck and walked over to where he was standing.  \"Great old hymn, isn't it, lad?\"  \"I'll say so,\" was his laconic reply.  \"Belong to some church back home?\" I asked him.  \"Folks do; Presbyterians,\" he replied.  \"Like the old hymns?\" I asked.  \"Yes, it seems like home to sing 'em.\"  I didn't get to talk with him for a few minutes, for he had to stop another truck.  Then he came back.  \"Folks at home, Sis and Bill and the kid, mother and father, used to gather around the piano every Sunday evening and sing 'em.  Didn't think much of them then, but liked to sing.  But they mean a lot to me over here, especially when I'm on guard at nights on this 'Dead Man's Curve.'  Seems like they make me stronger.\"  As I walked away I still heard him humming \"Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me.\"  One of the most vivid song silhouettes that I remember is that of a great crowd of negroes singing in a Y. M. C. A. hut.  There must have been a thousand of them.  I was to speak to them on \"Lincoln Day.\"  I remember how their white teeth shone through the semidarkness of that candle-lighted hut, and how their eyes gleamed, and how their bodies swayed as they sang the old plantation melodies.  The first song startled me with the universality of its simple expression.  It was an adaptation of that old melody which the negroes have sung for years, \"It's the Old-Time Religion.\"  A boy down"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18078"],["title","Soldier Silhouettes on Our Front (#1)"],["body","led the singing.  A curt \"Sam, set up a tune,\" from the Tuskegee colored secretary started it.  This boy sat with his back to the audience.  He didn't even turn around to face them.  Low and sweetly he started singing.  You could hardly hear him at first.  Then a few boys near him took up the music.  Then a few more.  Then it gradually swept back over that crowd of men until every single negro was swaying to that simple music, and then it was that I caught the almost startlingly appropriate words:    \"It is good for a world in trouble;   It is good for a world in trouble;   It is good for a world in trouble;     And it's good enough for me.    It's the old-time religion;   It's the old-time religion;   It's the old-time religion;     And it's good enough for me.    It was good for my old mother;   It was good for my old mother;   It was good for my old mother;     And it's good enough for me.\"   Then much to my astonishment they did something that I have since learned is the very way that these songs grew from the beginning.  They extemporized a verse for the day, and they did it on the spot.  I made absolutely certain of that by careful investigation.  They sang this extra verse:    \"It was good for ole Abe Lincoln;   It was good for ole Abe Lincoln;   It was good for ole Abe Lincoln;     And it's good enough for me.\"   \"That first verse, 'It is good for a world in trouble,' is certainly a most appropriate one for these times in France,\" I said aside to the secretary.  \"Yes,\" he replied; \"if ever this pore ole worl' needed the sustainin' power of the religion of the Christ, it does now; an' if ever this pore ole worl' was in trouble, that time suttinly is right now,\" he added with fervor.  And now I can never think of the world, nor of the folks back here at home, nor of the millions of our boys over there that I do not hear the sweet voices of that crowd of negroes singing reverently and fervently:    \"It is good for a world in trouble;   It is good for a world in trouble;   It is good for a world in trouble;     And it's good enough for me.\"   Another Silhouette of Song that stands out against the background of memory is that of a hymn that I heard in Doctor Charles Jefferson's church just before I sailed for France.  I was lonely.  I walked into that great city church a stranger, as thousands of boys who have sailed from New York have done.  I never remember to have been so unutterably lonely and homesick.  It was cold in the city, and I was alone.  I turned to a church.  Thousands of boys have done the same, may the mothers and fathers of America know, and they have found comfort.  If the parents of this great nation could know how well their boys are guarded and cared for in New York City before they sail, they would have a feeling of comfort.  I sat down in this great church.  I was thinking more of other Sabbath mornings at home, with my wife and baby, than anything else.  A hymn was announced.  I stood up mechanically, but there was no song in my throat.  There was a great lump of loneliness only.  But suddenly I listened to the words they were singing.  Had they selected that hymn just for me?  It seemed so.  It so answered the loneliness in my heart with comfort and quiet.  That great congregation was singing:    \"Peace, perfect peace;   With loved ones far away;   In Jesus' keeping, we are safe; and they.\"   A great sense of peace settled over my heart, and I have quoted that old hymn all over France to the boys, and they have been comforted. Many a boy has asked me to write him a copy of that verse to stick in his note-book.  It seemed to give a sense of comfort to the lads, for their loved ones, too, were \"far away,\" and since I have come home I find that this, too, comes as a great comfort hymn to those who are here lonely for their boys \"over there.\"  And who shall forget the silhouette of approaching the shores of France by night as they have sailed down along the coast, cautiously and carefully, to find the opening of the submarine nets?  Who shall forget the sense of exhilaration that the news that land was near brought? Who shall forget the crowding to the railings by all on board to scan anxiously through the night for the first sight of land?  Then who shall forget seeing that first light from shore flash out through the darkness of night?  Who shall forget the red and green and white lights that began to twinkle, and gleam, and flash, and signal, and call?  How beautiful those lights looked after the long, dangerous, eventful, and dark voyage, without a single light showing on the ship!  And who shall forget the man along the railing who said, \"I never knew before the meaning of that old song, 'The Lights Along the Shore'\"?  And then, who can forget the fact that suddenly somebody started to sing that old hymn, \"The Lights Along the Shore,\" and of how it swept along the lower decks, and then to the upper decks, until a whole ship-load of people was singing it?  And then who shall forget how somebody else started \"Let the Lower Lights Be Burning\"?  Can such scenes ever be obliterated from one's memory?  No, not forever.  That silhouette remains eternally!  Five great transports were in.  They were lined up along the docks in the locks.  A Y. M. C. A. secretary was standing on the docks yelling up a word of welcome to the crowded railings of the great transports. The boats were not \"cleared\" as yet.  It would take an hour, and the secretary knew that something must be done, so he started to lead first one ship and then another in singing.  \"What shall we sing, boys?\" he would shout up to them from the docks below.  Some fellow from the railing yelled, \"Keep the Home Fires Burning,\" and that fine song rang out from five thousand throats.  I have heard it sung in the camps at home, I have heard it sung in great huts in France, but I never heard it when it sounded so significant and so sweet in its mighty volume as it sounded coming from that great khaki-lined transport, which had just landed an hour before in France. I stood beside the song-leader there on the docks looking up at that great mass of American humanity, a hundred feet above us, so far away that we could not recognize individual faces, on the high decks of one of the largest ships that sails the seas, and as that sweet song of war swept out over the docks and across the white town, and back across the Atlantic, I said to myself: \"That volume sounds as if it could make itself heard back home.\"  The man beside me said: \"The folks back home hear it all right, for they are eagerly listening for every sound that comes from that crowd of boys.  Yes, the folks back home hear it, and they'll 'keep the home fires burning' all right.  God bless them!\"  The last Silhouette of Song stands out against a background of green trees and spring, and the odor of a hospital, and Red Cross nurses going and coming, and boys lying in white robes everywhere.  My friend the song-leader had gone with me to hold the vesper service in the hospital.  Then we visited in the wards in order to see those who were so severely wounded that they could not get to the service.  There was a little group of men in one room.  The first thing I knew my friend had them singing.  At first they took to it awkwardly.  Then more courageously.  Then sweetly there rang through the hospital the strains of \"My Daddy Over There.\"  It melted my heart, for I have a baby girl at home who says to the neighbors, \"My daddy is the prettiest man in the world,\" and believes it.  I said to Cray: \"Why did you sing that particular song?\"  \"Oh,\" he replied, \"my baby's name is 'Betty,' and I found a guy whose baby's name is 'Betty' too, and we had a sort of club formed; and another guy had a baby boy, and then I just thought they'd like to sing 'My Daddy Over There.'  But we ended up with 'Jesus, Lover of My Soul,' so that ought to suit you.\"  \"Suit me, man?  Why I got a 'Betty' baby of my own, and that 'Daddy Over There' song you sang is the sweetest thing I've heard in France, and it will help those daddies more than a hymn would.  I'm glad you got them to singing.\"  And now I'm back home, and I thought the Silhouettes of Song were all over, but I stepped into a church the other Sunday.  Up high above the sacred altars of that church fluttered a beautiful silk service flag. It was starred in the shape of a letter \"S.\"  In the circle of each \"S\" was a red cross.  The church had two members in the Red Cross.  Above the \"S\" and below it were two red triangles.  The church had men in the service of the Y. M. C. A.  Then grouped about the \"S\" were the stars of boys in the service.  As I looked up at this cross a flood of memories swept over me.  I could not keep back the tears.  All the love, all the loneliness, all the heartache, all the pride, all the hope of the folks at home, their reverence, their loyalty, was summed up in that flag.  I stood to sing, my eyes brimming with tears.  The great congregation started that beautifully sweet hymn that is being sung all over America in the churches in loving memory of the boys over there:    \"God save our splendid men,   Send them safe home again,     God save our men.   Make them victorious,   Patient and chivalrous,   They are so dear to us,     God save our men.    God keep our own dear men,   From every stain of sin,     God keep our men.   When Satan would allure,   When tempted, keep them pure,   Be their protection sure--     God keep our men.    God hold our precious men,   And love them to the end.     God hold our men.   Held in Thine arms so strong   To Thee they all belong.   This ever be our song:     God hold our men.\"  I stood the pressure until that great congregation came to that line \"They are so dear to us,\" and the voice of the mother beside me broke, and she had to stop.  Then I had to stop, too, and we looked at each other through our tears and smiled and understood, so that when she sweetly said, \"I have a boy over there,"]]]
