I don't know what became of my friends Hugh and Bill.  They were just beside me, but when I looked around both were gone.  A shell landed just at the side of me, and I think Hugh and Bill were blown to pieces.  I got my wound in the chest and the fragment came out through my back.  I thought my last day had come.  I dropped into a hole, and no sooner had I got in, than Mack got it through the face.  He was able to go back, but I was simply helpless, as my legs refused to move.  Anyhow, I pulled the shovel off my back and dug a little ridge in the side of the trench.  No sooner had I done this than Fritz started to bombard.  One shell fell in the hole in which I was, but exploded in the opposite direction.  Then another came and landed just above my head, but it failed to go off. Had it gone off I never would have been here now.  I had prayed hard to my God to deliver me from my enemies and when those things happened I felt my prayer was heard and that I was going to come through.  I was there in that hole all day and the next night before anyone came near me.  At last one of the 19th Battalion chaps came along and went for a stretcher for me.\"   Such are the varying impressions which a battle makes upon various men. It is no romance, but a grim reality of life and death.  Far into the night we lie awake and ask ourselves, what is the meaning of it all?  At first on the field of battle one thrills at the sound of mighty and unearthly forces loosed, but in the din we suddenly realize that boys are dying all about us, and that these guns bear swift death and mangling to suffering men.  Between us and the enemy are just a few deep shell holes and a thin red line of flesh and blood, as a human rampart, formed of men who hold their lives in their hands, ready to make the great sacrifice.  Behind us are the hidden guns and the support trenches in the narrow strip of hard-won territory.  Behind these are the moving columns on the long roads, the pulsing arteries of traffic, and the moving troop trains on the rails.  Behind these in turn are the plying ships, the millions of toiling workers, and the suffering hearts of the nations in arms.  Whole nations--yes, almost the whole of humanity--are organized for war and dragged into deadly conflict as by some devil's behest, instead of being organized for brotherhood and the building of a better world.  Oh, not for this devil's work were men made.  Surely mankind must come to its own in these birth pangs of a new era.  Never, never again must a whole humanity of the free-born sons of God be dragged into the hell of war to sate the pride or pomp of kings, or to glut the ambition of scheming secret groups who have taught men that they are created as obedient slaves.  Far behind us, marking the slow advance up this ridge of death, are the sheltered cemeteries of white crosses that tell the price that has already been paid.  There are five thousand crowded graves in yonder acre alone.  Great is the price, awful in its solid weight of agony. This is no longer a war between two peoples, but between two principles; it is as much to free the German people as to protect ourselves.  It is not for this narrow strip of hard-won soil, but for every foot of a world that from henceforth must be free.  The men who are fighting on grounds of moral principle would rather pay any price than lie at ease under the false shadow of militarism, materialism, and grasping greed.  These men are fighting, and many of them know that they are fighting, for a new world.  Not only military oppression, but industrial oppression, must go.  Not only German militarism, and Russian autocracy, and Turkish cruelty must be done away; but American materialism must be purged in the fiery furnace of this war.  Its purposes will reach far beyond our ken, and though man's sin alone has caused the war, its issues are in the hands of God.  The whole war has been a demonstration of the result of leaving God out of His world. The world with God left out leaves war; and life with God left out leaves hell.  There must be a turning to God in our own national life.  We speak of the menace of German militarism, but what is militarism but armed and aggressive materialism, the deeper principle which lies behind it?  And what is materialism but organized selfishness?  Materialism and selfishness are the dangers of our own land as well as of Germany.  And the war is a call to set our own house in order.  America can no longer live to herself alone.  She is fighting for the freedom of humanity.  Here on the very field of battle, at the throbbing heart of the conflict, we ask ourselves, What is the real issue of the war?  What are they fighting for?  Away there in Austria a young crown prince, Francis Ferdinand, was murdered.  It was the spark which set off the powder mine of Europe. But not for him are they fighting.  Behind him stood the two contending forces of the growing nationalism of Serbia and the expanding commercialism of Austria.  These two forces clashed in conflict, but not for them are they fighting.  Behind these stood two greater powers, those of pan-Germanism and pan-Slavism, a growing Germany and a rising Russia, which like a vast glacier for a thousand years had sought the open sea.  The ambitions of these two powers clashed in conflict at Constantinople and elsewhere.  But not for them are they fighting.  On the western front there were two deeper principles in conflict, those of autocracy and democracy, the question whether one man and a sinister, hidden group of plotting militarists could drag the whole world into war and crush its liberties and its laws beneath the iron heel of despotism, or whether man as man should stand erect in his God-given right of freedom and work out his own destiny in friendly brotherhood.  But behind even the great conflict between autocracy and democracy lay a yet deeper issue.  In the last analysis the final question in human life is between a material and a spiritual interpretation of the universe, whether might makes right and the strong are to rule, or whether right makes might and the moral order is supreme.  There is a material and a spiritual side of life.  On this side is the brute struggle for life; on that, the struggle for the life of others; on the one hand, the fight for the survival of the fittest, and on the other, the fight to make men fit to survive.  On the left hand is selfishness and on the right service; on the one side are the red battlefields of the enemy, and on the other is a cross red in sacrifice of a life laid down in the serving and saving of men.  There is a final issue in the world between passion and principle, between wrong and right, between darkness and light, between mammon and God, between self and Christ.  This ultimate issue must be faced by individuals and by nations.  It is the challenge which confronts men in this war.  Seventy years ago a crushed Europe faced the issue in the prophetic words of Mazzini, written in the hour of darkness and defeat:   \"Our victory is certain; I declare it with the profoundest conviction, here in exile, and precisely when monarchical reaction appears most insolently secure.  What matters the triumph of an hour?  What matters it that by concentrating all your means of action, availing yourselves of every artifice, turning to your account those prejudices and jealousies of race which yet for a while endure, and spreading distrust, egotism, and corruption, you have repulsed our forces and restored the former order of things?  Can you restore men's faith in it, or think you can long maintain it by brute force alone, now that all faith in it is extinct?  Threatened and undermined on every side, can you hold all Europe forever in a stage of siege?\" [1]   Pasteur sees the same issue looming even in his day and states it in burning words at the close of his life:   \"Two contrary laws seem to be wrestling with each other nowadays, the one a law of blood and of death, ever seeking new means of destruction and forcing nations to be constantly ready for the battlefield; the other a law of peace, work, and health, ever evolving new means of delivering man from the scourges which beset him.  The first seeks violent conquests, the other the relief of humanity.  The latter places one human life above any victory, while the former would sacrifice hundreds and thousands of lives to the ambition of one.  Which of these two laws will ultimately prevail God only knows.  We will have tried, by obeying the laws of humanity, to extend the frontiers of Life.\" [2]  Lincoln faced the same issue in the midst of the war weariness of our own great conflict with words which come back to the nation now with a prophetic call:   \"The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.  It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.  It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.\"   [1] Life and Writings of Mazzini, vol. v, pp. 269-271.

For miles away over the rolling country the golden harvests of France are ripening in the sun, broken by patches of green field, forest, and stream.  The reapers are gathering in the grain.  Only old men, women, and children are left to do the work, for the sons "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18325"],["title","With Our Soldiers in France (#3)"],["body","France are away at the battle front.  The countryside is more beautiful than the finest parts of New York or Pennsylvania.  In almost every valley sleeps a little French hamlet, with its red tiled roofs and its neat stone cottages, clustered about the village church tower.  It is a picture of calm and peace and plenty under the summer sun.  But the sound of distant guns on the neighboring drill grounds, a bugle call down the village street, the sight of the broad cowboy hats and the khaki uniforms of the American soldiers, arouse us to the realization of a world at war and the fact that our boys are here, fighting for the soil of France and the world's freedom.  We are in a typical French farming village of a thousand people, and here a thousand American soldiers are quartered.  A sergeant and a score of men are in each shed or stable or barn loft.  The Americans are stationed in a long string of villages down this railway line. Indeed it is hard to tell for the moment whether we are in France or in the States.  Here are Uncle Sam's uniforms, brown army tents, and new wooden barracks.  The roads are filled with American trucks, wagons, motors, and whizzing motorcycles, American mules, ammunition wagons, machine guns, provisions, and supplies, and American sentinels down every street.  These are the men of the First Division, scattered along behind the French lines, being drilled as rapidly as possible to take their place in the trenches for the relief of the hard-pressed French.  The nucleus is made up of the men of the old army, who have seen service in Cuba, Porto Rico, the Philippines, Texas, or along the Mexican border.  And with them are young boys of nineteen, twenty, or twenty-one, with clear faces, fresh from their homes, chiefly from the Middle West--from Illinois to Texas.  The first thing that strikes us as we look at these men is their superb kit and outfit.  From the broad cowboy hat, the neat uniform close fitting at the waist, down to their American shoes; from the saddles, bits, and bridles to the nose bags of the horses; from the guns, motors, and trucks down to the last shoe lace, the equipment is incomparably the best and most expensive of all that we have seen at the front.  The boys themselves are live, clean, strong, and intelligent fellows, probably the best raw material of any of the fighting forces in Europe.  The officers tell us that the American troops are natural marksmen and there are no better riflemen in the war zone.  The frequency of the sharpshooters' medals, among both the officers and the men, shows that many of them already excel in musketry.  The second impression that strikes us is the crudeness of the new men, and the lack of finish in their drill, as compared with the veteran troops of Britain and France.  The progress they have made, however, in the past few weeks under their experienced American officers of the regular army has been truly remarkable.  The next impression we receive is the enormous moral danger to which these men are exposed in this far-away foreign land.  During the whole war it is the Overseas Forces, the men farthest from home influences, who have no hope of leave or furlough, who are far removed from all good women and the steadying influence of their own reputations, that have fared the worst in the war.  The Americans not only share this danger with the Colonials and other Overseas Forces, but they have an additional danger in their high pay.  Here are enlisted men who tell us that they are paid from $35 to $90 a month, from the lowest private to the best paid sergeants.  When you remember that the Russian private is allowed only one cent a day, that the Belgian soldier receives only four cents a day, the French private five cents, the German six cents, and the English soldier twenty-five cents a day, most of which has to go for supplementary food to make up for the scantiness of the rations supplied, you realize what it means for the American soldier to be paid from one to three dollars a day, in addition to clothing, expenses, and the best rations of any army in Europe.[1]  Some of these men tell us that they have just received from two to three months' back pay in cash.  Here they are with several hundred francs in their hands, buried in a French village, with absolutely no attraction or amusement save drink and immorality.  In this little village the only prosperous trade in evidence is that in wines and liquors.  The only large wholesale house is the center of the liquor trade and the only freight piled up on the platform of the station consists of wines and champagnes, pouring in to meet the demand of the American soldiers.  There are a score of drinking places in this little hamlet.  Our boys are unaccustomed to the simple and moderate drinking of the French peasants, and they are plunged into these _estaminets_ with their pockets full of money.  Others under the influence of drink have torn up the money or tossed it recklessly away.  Prices have doubled and trebled in the village in a few weeks, and the peasants have come to the conclusion that every American soldier must be a millionaire; as the boys have sometimes told them that the pile of notes, which represents several mouths' pay, is the amount they receive every month.  Compare this with the $1.80 a month, in addition to a small allowance for his family, which the French private gets, and you will readily see how this false impression is formed.  Temptation and solicitation in Europe have been in almost exact proportion to the pay that the soldier receives.  The harpies flock around the men who have the most money.  As our American boys are the best paid, and perhaps the most generous and open-hearted and reckless of all the troops, they have proved an easy mark in Paris and the port cities.  As soon as they were paid several months' back salary, some of them took \"French leave,\" went on a spree, and did not come back until they were penniless.  The officers, fully alive to the danger, are now doing their utmost to cope with the situation; they are seeking to reduce the cash payments to the men and are endeavoring to persuade them to send more of their money home.  Court martial and strict punishment have been imposed for drunkenness, in the effort to grapple with this evil.  Will the friends of our American boys away in France try to realize just the situation that confronts them?  Imagine a thousand healthy, happy, reckless, irrepressible American youths put down in a French village, without a single place of amusement but a drinking hall, and no social life save such as they can find with the French girls standing in the doorways and on the street corners.  Think of all these men shut up, month after month, through the long winter, with nothing to do to occupy their evenings.  Then you will begin to realize the seriousness of the situation which the Young Men's Christian Association is trying to meet.  Here on the village green stands a big tent, with the sign \"The American Y M C A,\" and the red triangle, which is already placed upon more than seven hundred British, French, and American Association centers in France.  Inside the tent, as the evening falls, scores of boys are sitting at the tables, writing their letters home on note paper provided for them.  Here are men playing checkers, dominoes, and other games.  Other groups are standing around the folding billiard tables.  A hundred men have taken out books from the circulating library, while others are scanning the home papers and the latest news from the front.  Our secretaries have been on the ground for a week, working daily from five o'clock in the morning until midnight.  They have unpacked their goods and are doing a driving trade over the counter, to the value of some $200 a day.  In certain cases goods are sold at a loss, as it is very hard indeed to get supplies under present war conditions.  The steamer \"Kansan\" was torpedoed, and sank with the whole first shipment of supplies and equipment for the Y M C A huts in France.  Outside a baseball game is exciting rivalry between two companies; while near the door of the tent a ring is formed and the men are cheering pair after pair as they put on the boxing gloves and with good humor are learning to take some rather heavy slugging.  Poor boys, they will have to stand much worse punishment than this before the winter is over.  Just beside the present tent there is being rushed into position a big Y M C A hut which will accommodate temporarily a thousand men, before it is taken to pieces and shipped to some new center.  The Association has ordered from Paris a number of permanent pine huts, 60 by 120 feet, which will accommodate 2,000 soldiers each, and keep them warm and well occupied during the long cold winter evenings that are to come.  On the railway siding at the moment are nine temporary huts, packed in sections for immediate construction, and a score of permanent buildings have been ordered to be erected as fast as the locations for the camps are selected by the military authorities.  Indeed, the aim is to have them on the ground and ready before the boys arrive and take the first plunge in the wrong direction.  What is the life that our boys are living here at the front?  Let us go through a day with the battalion quartered in this village.  At five o'clock in the morning the first bugle sounds.  The boys are quickly on their feet, dressing, washing, getting ready for the day's drill.  In half an hour they are tucking away a generous breakfast provided by Uncle Sam, of hot bacon, fried potatoes and coffee, good home made bread, and as much of it as a man can eat.  They get meat twice a day, and we have found no soldiers in Europe who receive rations that compare with the food that our boys receive.  By 6:40 a. m. the men have reached the drill ground on the open fields above the village and are ready to begin the eight or nine hours of hard work and"]]]
