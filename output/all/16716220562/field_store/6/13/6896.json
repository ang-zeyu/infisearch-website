He had thoroughly studied all the stratagems which specie employs to escape those who are hunting for it, and knew, better than a pilot knows the hours of the tide, at what periods it was high or low water; that is to say, on what days his friends and acquaintances were accustomed to be in funds. Accordingly, there were houses where his appearance of a morning made people say, not \"Here is Monsieur Schaunard,\" but \"This is the first or the fifteenth.\" To facilitate, and at the same time equalize this species of tax which he was going to levy, when compelled by necessity, from those who were able to pay it to him, Schaunard had drawn up by districts and streets an alphabetical table containing the names of all his acquaintances. Opposite each name was inscribed the maximum of the sum which the party's finances authorized the artist to borrow of him, the time when he was flush, and his dinner hour, as well as his usual bill of fare. Beside this table, he kept a book, in perfect order, on which he entered the sums lent him, down to the smallest fraction; for he would never burden himself beyond a certain amount which was within the fortune of a country relative, whose heir-apparent he was. As soon as he owed one person twenty francs, he closed the account and paid him off, even if obliged to borrow for the purpose of those to whom he owed less. In this way he always kept up a certain credit which he called his floating debt, and as people knew that he was accustomed to repay as soon as his means permitted him, those who could accommodate him were very ready to do so.  But on the present occasion, from eleven in the morning, when he had started to try and collect the seventy-five francs requisite, up to six in the afternoon, he had only raised three francs, contributed by three letters (M., V., and R.) of his famous list. All the rest of the alphabet, having, like himself, their quarter to pay, had adjourned his claim indefinitely.  The clock of his stomach sounded the dinner-hour. He was then at the Maine barrier, where letter U lived. Schaunard mounted to letter U's room, where he had a knife and fork, when there were such articles on the premises.  \"Where are you going, sir?\" asked the porter, stopping him before he had completed his ascent.  \"To Monsieur U,\" replied the artist.  \"He's out.\"  \"And madame?\"  \"Out too. They told me to say to a friend who was coming to see them this evening, that they were gone out to dine. In fact, if you are the gentleman they expected, this is the address they left.\" It was a scrap of paper on which his friend U. had written. \"We are gone to dine with Schaunard, No.__, Rue de__. Come for us there.\"  \"Well,\" said he, going away, \"accident does make queer farces sometimes.\" Then remembering that there was a little tavern near by, where he had more than once procured a meal at a not unreasonable rate, he directed his steps to this establishment, situated in the adjoining road, and known among the lowest class of artistdom as \"Mother Cadet's.\" It is a drinking-house which is also an eating-house, and its ordinary customers are carters of the Orleans railway, singing-ladies of Mont Parnasse, and juvenile \"leads\" from the Bobino theatre. During the warm season the students of the numerous painters' studios which border on the Luxembourg, the unappreciated and unedited men of the letters, the writers of leaders in mysterious newspapers, throng to dine at \"Mother Cadet's,\" which is famous for its rabbit stew, its veritable sour-crout, and a miled white wine which smacks of flint.  Schaunard sat down in the grove; for so at \"Mother Cadet's\" they called the scattered foliage of two or three rickety trees whose sickly boughs had been trained into a sort of arbor.  \"Hang the expense!\" said Schaunard to himself, \"I have to have a good blow-out, a regular Belthazzar's feast in private life,\" and without more ado, he ordered a bowl of soup, half a plate of sour-crout, and two half stews, having observed that you get more for two halves than one whole one.  This extensive order attracted the attention of a young person in white with a head-dress of orange flowers and ballshoes; a veil of _sham imitation_ lace streamed down her shoulders, which she had no special reason to be proud of. She was a _prima donna_ of the Mont Parnasse theatre, the greenroom of which opens into Mother Cadet's kitchen; she had come to take a meal between two acts of _Lucia_, and was at that moment finishing with a small cup of coffee her dinner, composed exclusively of an artichoke seasoned with oil and vinegar.  \"Two stews! Duece take it!\" said she, in an aside to the girl who acted as waiter at the establishment. \"That young man feeds himself well. How much do I owe, Adele?\"  \"Artichoke four, coffee four, bread one, that makes nine sous.\"  \"There they are,\" said the singer and off she went humming:      \"This affection Heaven has given.\"  \"Why she is giving us the la!\" exclaimed a mysterious personage half hidden behind a rampart of old books, who was seated at the same table with Schaunard.  \"Giving it!\" replied the other, \"keeping it, I should say. Just imagine!\" he added, pointing to the vinegar on the plate from which Lucia had been eating her artichoke, \"pickling that falsetto of hers!\"  \"It is a strong acid, to be sure,\" added the personage who had first spoken. \"They make some at Orleans which has deservedly a great reputation.\"  Schaunard carefully examined this individual, who was thus fishing for a conversation with him. The fixed stare of his large blue eyes, which always seemed looking for something, gave his features the character of happy tranquility which is common among theological students. His face had a uniform tint of old ivory, except his cheeks, which had a coat, as it were of brickdust. His mouth seemed to have been sketched by a student in the rudiments of drawing, whose elbow had been jogged while he was tracing it. His lips, which pouted almost like a negro's, disclosed teeth not unlike a stag-hound's and his double-chin reposed itself upon a white cravat, one of whose points threatened the stars, while the other was ready to pierce the ground. A torrent of light hair escaped from under the enormous brim of his well-worn felt-hat. He wore a hazel-coloured overcoat with a large cape, worn thread-bare and rough as a grater; from its yawning pockets peeped bundles of manuscripts and pamphlets. The enjoyment of his sour-crout, which he devoured with numerous and audible marks of approbation, rendered him heedless of the scrutiny to which he was subjected, but did not prevent him from continuing to read an old book open before him, in which he made marginal notes from time to time with a pencil that he carried behind his ear.  \"Hullo!\" cried Schaunard suddenly, making his glass ring with his knife, \"my stew!\"  \"Sir,\" said the girl, running up plate in hand, \"there is none left, here is the last, and this gentleman has ordered it.\" Therewith she deposited the dish before the man with the books.  \"The deuce!\" cried Schaunard. There was such an air of melancholy disappointment in his ejaculation, that the possessor of the books was moved to the soul by it. He broke down the pile of old works which formed a barrier between him and Schaunard, and putting the dish in the centre of the table, said, in his sweetest tones:  \"Might I be so bold as to beg you, sir, to share this with me?\"  \"Sir,\" replied the artist, \"I could not think of depriving you of it.\"  \"Then will you deprive me of the pleasure of being agreeable to you?\"  \"If you insist, sir,\" and Schaunard held out his plate.  \"Permit me not to give you the head,\" said the stranger.  \"Really sir, I cannot allow you,\" Schaunard began, but on taking back his plate he perceived that the other had given him the very piece which he implied he would keep for himself.  \"What is he playing off his politeness on me for?\" he muttered to himself.  \"If the head is the most noble part of man,\" said the stranger, \"it is the least agreeable part of the rabbit. There are many persons who cannot bear it. I happen to like it very much, however.\"  \"If so,\" said Schaunard, \"I regret exceedingly that you robbed yourself for me.\"  \"How? Excuse me,\" quoth he of the books, \"I kept the head, as I had the honor of observing to you.\"  \"Allow me,\" rejoined Schaunard, thrusting his plate under his nose, \"what part do you call that?\"  \"Good heavens!\" cried the stranger, \"what do I see? Another head? It is a bicephalous rabbit!\"  \"Buy what?\" said Schaunard.  \"Cephalous--comes from the Greek. In fact, Baffon (who used to wear ruffles) cites some cases of this monstrosity. On the whole, I am not sorry to have eaten a phenomenon.\"  Thanks to this incident, the conversation was definitely established. Schaunard, not willing to be behindhand in courtesy, called for an extra quart of wine. The hero of the books called for a third. Schaunard treated to salad, the other to dessert. At eight o'clock there were six empty bottles on the table. As they talked, their natural frankness, assisted by their libations, had urged them to interchange biographies, and they knew each other as well as if they had always lived together. He of the books, after hearing the confidential disclosures of Schaunard, had informed him that his name was Gustave Colline; he was a philosopher by profession, and got his living by giving lessons in rhetoric, mathematics and several other _ics_.  What little money he picked up by his profession was spent in buying books. His hazel-coloured coat was known to all the stall keepers on the quay from the Pont de la Concorde to the Pont Saint Michel. What he did with these books, so numerous that no man's lifetime would have been long enough to read them, nobody knew, least of all, himself. But this hobby of his amounted to monomania: when he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18445"],["title","Bohemians of the Latin Quarter (#6)"],["body","home at night without bringing a musty quarto with him, he would repeat the saying of Titus, \"I have lost a day.\" His enticing manners, his language, which was a mosaic of every possible style, and the fearful puns which embellished his conversation, completely won Schaunard, who demanded on the spot permission of Colline to add his name to those on the famous list already mentioned.  They left Mother Cadet's at nine o'clock at night, both fairly primed, and with the gait of men who have been engaged in close conversation with sundry bottles.  Colline offered to stand coffee, and Schaunard accepted on condition that he should be allowed to pay for the accompanying nips of liquor. They turned into a cafe in the Rue Saint Germain l'Auxerrois, and bearing on its sign the name of Momus, god of play and pleasure.  At the moment they entered a lively argument broke out between two of the frequenters of the place. One of them was a young fellow whose face was hidden by a dense thicket of beard of several distinct shades. By way of a balance to this wealth of hair on his chin, a precocious baldness had despoiled his forehead, which was as bare as a billiard ball. He vainly strove to conceal the nakedness of the land by brushing forward a tuft of hairs so scanty that they could almost be counted. He wore a black coat worn at the elbows, and revealing whenever he raised his arms too high a ventilator under the armpits. His trousers might have once been black, but his boots, which had never been new, seemed to have already gone round the world two or three times on the feet of the Wandering Jew.  Schaunard noticed that his new friend Colline and the young fellow with the big beard nodded to one another.  \"You know the gentleman?\" said he to the philosopher.  \"Not exactly,\" replied the latter, \"but I meet him sometimes at the National Library. I believe that he is a literary man.\"  \"He wears the garb of one, at any rate,\" said Schaunard.  The individual with whom this young fellow was arguing was a man of forty, foredoomed, by a big head wedged between his shoulders without any break in the shape of a neck, to the thunderstroke of apoplexy. Idiocy was written in capital letters on his low forehead, surmounted by a little black skull-cap. His name was Monsieur Mouton, and he was a clerk at the town hall of the 4th Arrondissement, where he acted as registrar of deaths.  \"Monsieur Rodolphe,\" exclaimed he, in the squeaky tones of a eunuch, shaking the young fellow by a button of his coat which he had laid hold of. \"Do you want to know my opinion? Well, all your newspapers are of no use whatsoever. Come now, let us put a supposititious case. I am the father of a family, am I not? Good. I go to the cafe for a game at dominoes? Follow my argument now.\"  \"Go on,\" said Rodolphe.  \"Well,\" continued Daddy Mouton, punctuating each of his sentences by a blow with his fist which made the jugs and glasses on the table rattle again. \"Well, I come across the papers. What do I see? One which says black when the other says white, and so on and so on. What is all that to me? I am the father of a family who goes to the cafe--\"  \"For a game at dominoes,\" said Rodolphe.  \"Every evening,\" continued Monsieur Mouton. \"Well, to put a case--you understand?\"  \"Exactly,\" observed Rodolphe.  \"I read an article which is not according to my views. That puts me in a rage, and I fret my heart out, because you see, Monsieur Rodolphe, newspapers are all lies. Yes, lies,\" he screeched in his shrillest falsetto, \"and the journalists are robbers.\"  \"But, Monsieur Mouton--\"  \"Yes, brigands,\" continued the clerk. \"They are the cause of all our misfortunes; they brought about the Revolution and its paper money, witness Murat.\"  \"Excuse me,\" said Rodolphe, \"you mean Marat.\"  \"No, no,\" resumed Monsieur Mouton, \"Murat, for I saw his funeral when I was quite a child--\"  \"But I assure you--\"  \"They even brought you a piece at the Circus about him, so there.\"  \"Exactly,\" said Rodolphe, \"that was Murat.\"  \"Well what else have I been saying for an hour past?\" exclaimed the obstinate Mouton. \"Murat, who used to work in a cellar, eh? Well, to put a case. Were not the Bourbons right to guillotine him, since he had played the traitor?\"  \"Guillotine who? Play the traitor to whom?\" cried Rodolphe, button-holing Monsieur Mouton in turn.  \"Why Marat.\"  \"No, no, Monsieur Mouton. Murat, let us understand one another, hang it all!\"  \"Precisely, Marat, a scoundrel. He betrayed the Emperor in 1815. That is why I say all the papers are alike,\" continued Monsieur Mouton, returning to the original theme of what he called an explanation. \"Do you know what I should like, Monsieur Rodolphe? Well, to put a case. I should like a good paper. Ah! not too large and not stuffed with phrases.\"  \"You are exacting,\" interrupted Rodolphe, \"a newspaper without phrases.\"  \"Yes, certainly. Follow my idea?\"  \"I am trying to.\"  \"A paper which should simply give the state of the King's health and of the crops. For after all, what is the use of all your papers that no one can understand? To put a case. I am at the town hall, am I not? I keep my books; very good. Well, it is just as if someone came to me and said, 'Monsieur Mouton, you enter the deaths--well, do this, do that.' What do you mean by this and that? Well, it is the same thing with newspapers,\" he wound up with.  \"Evidently,\" said a neighbor who had understood.  And Monsieur Mouton having received the congratulations of some of the other frequenters of the cafe who shared his opinion, resumed his game at dominoes.  \"I have taught him his place,\" said he, indicating Rodolphe, who had returned to the same table at which Schaunard and Colline were seated.  \"What a blockhead!\" said Rodolphe to the two young fellows.  \"He has a fine head, with his eyelids like the hood of a cabriolet, and his eyes like glass marbles,\" said Schaunard, pulling out a wonderfully coloured pipe.  \"By Jupiter, sir,\" said Rodolphe, \"that is a very pretty pipe of yours.\"  \"Oh! I have a much finer one I wear in society,\" replied Schaunard, carelessly, \"pass me some tobacco, Colline.\"  \"Hullo!\" said the philosopher, \"I have none left.\"  \"Allow me to offer you some,\" observed Rodolphe, pulling a packet of tobacco out of his pocket and placing it on the table.  To this civility Colline thought it his duty to respond by an offer of glasses round.  Rodolphe accepted. The conversation turned on literature. Rodolphe, questioned as to the profession already revealed by his garb, confessed his relation with the Muses, and stood a second round of drinks. As the waiter was going off with the bottle Schaunard requested him to be good enough to forget it. He had heard the silvery tinkle of a couple of five-franc pieces in one of Colline's pockets. Rodolphe had soon reached the same level of expansiveness as the two friends, and poured out his confidences in turn.  They would no doubt have passed the night at the cafe if they had not been requested to leave. They had not gone ten steps, which had taken them a quarter of an hour to accomplish, before they were surprised by a violent downpour. Colline and Rodolphe lived at opposite ends of Paris, one on the Ile Saint Louis, and the other at Montmartre.  Schaunard, who had wholly forgotten that he was without a residence, offered them hospitality.  \"Come to my place,\" said he, \"I live close by, we will pass the night in discussing literature and art.\"  \"You shall play and Rodolphe will recite some of his verses to us,\" said Colline.  \"Right you are,\" said Schaunard, \"life is short, and we must enjoy ourselves whilst we can.\"  Arriving at the house, which Schaunard had some difficulty in recognizing, he sat down for a moment on a corner-post waiting for Rodolphe and Colline, who had gone into a wine-shop that was still open to obtain the primary element of a supper. When they came back, Schaunard rapped several times at the door, for he vaguely recollected that the porter had a habit of keeping him waiting. The door at length opened, and old Durand, half aroused from his first sleep, and no longer recalling that Schaunard had ceased to be his tenant, did not disturb himself when the latter called out his name to him.  When they had all three gained the top of the stairs, the ascent of which had been as lengthy as it was difficult, Schaunard, who was the foremost, uttered a cry of astonishment at finding the key in the keyhole of his door.  \"What is the matter?\" asked Rodolphe.  \"I cannot make it out,\" muttered the other. \"I find the key in the door, though I took it away with me this morning. Ah! we shall see. I put it in my pocket. Why, confound it, here it is still!\" he exclaimed, displaying a key. \"This is witchcraft.\"  \"Phantasmagoria,\" said Colline.  \"Fancy,\" added Rodolphe.  \"But,\" resumed Schaunard, whose voice betrayed a commencement of alarm, \"do you hear that?\"  \"What?\"  \"What?\"  \"My piano, which is playing of its own accord _do la mi re do, la si sol re._ Scoundrel of a re, it is still false.\"  \"But it cannot be in your room,\" said Rodolphe, and he added in a whisper to Colline, against whom he was leaning heavily, \"he is tight.\"  \"So I think. In the first place, it is not a piano at all, it is a flute.\"  \"But you are screwed too, my dear fellow,\" observed the poet to the philosopher, who had sat down on the landing, \"it is a violin.\"  \"A vio--, pooh! I say, Schaunard,\" hiccupped Colline, pulling his friend by the legs, \"here is a joke, this gentleman makes out that it is a vio--\"  \"Hang it all,\" exclaimed Schaunard in the height of terror, \"it is magic.\"  \"Phantasma-goria,\" howled Colline, letting fall one of the bottles he held by his hand.  \"Fancy,\" yelled Rodolphe in turn.  In the midst of this uproar the room door suddenly opened, and an individual holding a triple-branched candlestick in which pink candles were burning, appeared on the threshold.  \"What do you want, gentlemen?\" asked he, bowing courteously to the three"]]]
