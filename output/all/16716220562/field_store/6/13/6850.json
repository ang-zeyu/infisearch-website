The conservatism which these causes tend to produce has in any case been marked in America.  Thus, as readers of Lowell are aware, in spite of the ceaseless efflorescence of the modern slang of America, the language of America is in many respects that of an older England than ours, and the like has all along been true of important literature, and still more of oratory, in America.  Moreover, as the sentences which have just been quoted may suggest, the maxim that has once hit the occasion, or the new practice or expedient once necessitated by the conditions of the moment, has been readily hallowed as expressing the wisdom of the ages.  An Englishman will quote Burke as he would quote Demosthenes or Plato, but Americans have been apt to quote their elder statesmen as they would quote the Bible.  In like manner political practices of accidental origin--for instance, that a representative should be an inhabitant of the place he represents--acquire in America something like the force of constitutional law.  In this connection we must recall the period at which the earliest settlers came from England, and the political heritage  which they consequently brought with them.  This heritage included a certain aptitude for local government, which was fostered in the south by the rise of a class of large landowners and in the north by the Congregational Church system.  It included also a great tenacity of the subject's rights as against the State--the spirit of Hampden refusing payment of ship-money--and a disposition to look on the law and the Courts as the bulwarks of such rights against Government.  But it did not include--and this explains the real meaning of the War of Independence--any sort of feeling of allegiance to a Parliament which represented Great Britain only, and which had gained its position even in Great Britain since the fathers of Virginia and Massachusetts left home. Nor did it include--and this was of great importance in its influence on the form of the Constitution--any real understanding of or any aptitude for the English Parliamentary Government, under which the leaders of the legislative body and the advisers of the Crown in its executive functions are the same men, and under which the elected persons, presumed for the moment to represent the people, are allowed for that moment an almost unfettered supremacy.  Thus there was much that made it easy for the Colonies to combine in the single act of repudiating British sovereignty, yet the characteristics which may be ascribed to them in common were not such as inclined them or fitted them to build up a great new unity.  The Colonies, however, backed up by the British Government with the vigour which Chatham imparted to it, had acted together against a common danger from the French.  When the States, as we must now call them, acted together against the British Government they did so in name as \"United States,\" and they shortly proceeded to draw up \"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union.\"  But it was union of a feeble kind.  The separate government of each State, in its internal affairs, was easy to provide for; representative institutions always existed, and no more change was needed than to substitute elected officers for the Governors and Councillors formerly appointed by the Crown.  For the Union a Congress was provided which was to represent all the States in dealings with the outside world, but it was a Government with no effective powers except such as each separate State might independently choose to lend it.  It might wage war with England, but it could not effectually control or regularly pay the military service of its own citizens; it might make a treaty of peace with England, but it could not enforce on its citizens distasteful obligations of that treaty.  Such an ill-devised machine would have worked well enough for a time, if the Union Government could have attached to itself popular sentiments of honour and loyalty.  But the sentiments were not there; and it worked badly.  When once we were reconciled to a defeat which proved good for us, it became a tradition among English writers to venerate the American Revolution.  Later English historians have revolted from this indiscriminate veneration.  They insist on another side of the facts: on the hopelessness of the American cause but for the commanding genius of Washington and his moral authority, and for the command which France and Spain obtained of the seas; on the petty quarrelsomeness with which the rights of the Colonists were urged, and the meanly skilful agitation which forced on the final rupture; on the lack of sustained patriotic effort during the war; on the base cruelty and dishonesty with which the loyal minority were persecuted and the private rights guaranteed by the peace ignored.  It does not concern us to ascertain the precise justice in this displeasing picture; no man now regrets the main result of the Revolution, and we know that a new country is a new country, and that there was much in the circumstances of the war to encourage indiscipline and ferocity.  But the fact that there is cause for such an indictment bears in two ways upon our present subject.  In the first place, there has been a tendency both in England and in America to look at this history upside down.  The epoch of the Revolution and the Constitution has been regarded as a heroic age--wherein lived the elder Brutus, Mucius Scaevola, Claelia and the rest--to be followed by almost continuous disappointment, disillusionment and decline.  A more pleasing and more bracing view is nearer to the historic truth.  The faults of a later time were largely survivals, and the later history is largely that of growth though in the face of terrific obstacles and many influences that favoured decay.  The nobility of the Revolution in the eighteenth century may be rated higher or lower, but in the Civil War, in which the elder brothers of so many men now living bore their part, the people of the North and of the South alike displayed far more heroic qualities.  In the second place, the War of Independence and of the Revolution lacked some of the characteristics of other national uprisings.  It was not a revolt against grievous oppression or against a wholly foreign domination, but against a political system which the people mildly resented and which only statesmen felt to be pernicious and found to be past cure.  The cause appealed to far-seeing political aspiration and appealed also to turbulent and ambitious spirits and to whatever was present of a merely revolutionary temper, but the ordinary law-abiding man who minded his own business was not greatly moved one way or the other in his heart.  The subsequent movement which, in a few years after independence was secured, gave the United States a national and a working Constitution was altogether the work of a few, to which popular movement contributed nothing.  Of popular aspiration for unity there was none.  Statesmen knew that the new nation or group of nations lay helpless between pressing dangers from abroad and its own financial difficulties.  They saw clearly that they must create a Government of the Union which could exercise directly upon the individual American citizen an authority like that of the Government of his own State.  They did this, but with a reluctant and half-convinced public opinion behind them.  The makers of the Constitution earned in a manner the full praise that has ever since been bestowed on them.  But they did not, as it has often been suggested they did, create a sort of archetype and pattern for all Governments that may hereafter partake of a federal character.  Nor has the curious machine which they devised--with its balanced opposition between two legislative chambers, between the whole Legislature and the independent executive power of the President, between the governing power of the moment and the permanent expression of the people's will embodied in certain almost unalterable laws--worked conspicuously better than other political constitutions.  The American Constitution owes its peculiarities partly to the form which the State Governments had naturally taken, and partly to sheer misunderstanding of the British Constitution, but much more to the want at the time of any strong sense of national unity and to the existence of a good deal of dislike to all government whatsoever.  The sufficient merit of its founders was that of patient and skilful diplomatists, who, undeterred by difficulties, found out the most satisfactory settlement that had a chance of being accepted by the States.  So the Colonies, which in 1776 had declared their independence of Great Britain under the name of the United States of America, entered in 1789 into the possession of machinery of government under which their unity and independence could be maintained.  It will be well at once to describe those features of the Constitution which it will be necessary for us later to bear in mind.  It is generally known that the President of the United States is an elected officer--elected by what operates, though intended to act otherwise, as a popular vote.  During the four years of his office he might roughly be said to combine the functions of the King in this country and those of a Prime Minister whose cabinet is in due subjection to him.  But that description needs one very important qualification.  He wields, with certain slight restrictions, the whole executive power of government, but neither he nor any of his ministers can, like the ministers of our King, sit or speak in the Legislature, nor can he, like our King, dissolve that Legislature.  He has indeed a veto on Acts of Congress, which can only be overridden by a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18379"],["title","Abraham Lincoln (#5)"],["body","majority in both Houses.  But the executive and the legislative powers in America were purposely so constituted as to be independent of each other to a degree which is unknown in this country.  It is perhaps not very commonly understood that President and Congress alike are as strictly fettered in their action by the Constitution as a limited liability company is by its Memorandum of Association.  This Constitution, which defines both the form of government and certain liberties of the subject, is not unalterable, but it can be altered only by a process which requires both the consent of a great majority in Congress or alternatively of a great majority of the legislatures of the distinct States composing the Union, and also ratification of amendments by three-fourths of the several States.  Thus we shall have to notice later that a \"Constitutional Amendment\" abolishing slavery became a terror of the future to many people in the slave States, but remained all the time an impossibility in the view of most people in the free States.  We have, above all things, to dismiss from our minds any idea that the Legislature of a State is subordinate to the Congress of the United States, or that a State Governor is an officer under the President.  The Constitution of the Union was the product of a half-developed sense of nationality.  Under it the State authority (in the American sense of \"State\") and the Union or Federal authority go on side by side working in separate spheres, each subject to Constitutional restrictions, but each in its own sphere supreme.  Thus the State authority is powerless to make peace or war or to impose customs duties, for those are Federal matters. But the Union authority is equally powerless, wherever a State authority has been constituted, to punish ordinary crime, to promote education, or to regulate factories.  In particular, by the Constitution as it stood till after the Civil War, the Union authority was able to prohibit the importation of slaves from abroad after the end of 1807, but had no power to abolish slavery itself in any of the States.  Further, Congress had to be constituted in such a manner as to be agreeable to the smaller States which did not wish to enter into a Union in which their influence would be swamped by their more populous neighbours.  Their interest was secured by providing that in the Senate each State should have two members and no more, while in the House of Representatives the people of the whole Union are represented according to population.  Thus legislation through Congress requires the concurrence of two forces which may easily be opposed, that of the majority of American citizens and that of the majority of the several States.  Of the two chambers, the Senate, whose members are elected for six years, and to secure continuity do not all retire at the same time, became as time went on, though not at first, attractive to statesmen of position, and acquired therefore additional influence.  Lastly, the Union was and is still the possessor of Territories not included in any State, and in the Territories, whatever subordinate self-government they might be allowed, the Federal authority has always been supreme and uncontrolled in all matters.  But as these Territories have become more settled and more populated, portions of them have steadily from the first been organised as States and admitted to the Union.  It is for Congress to settle the time of their admission and to make any conditions in regard to their Constitutions as States.  But when once admitted as States they have thenceforward the full rights of the original States.  Within all the Territories, while they remained under its jurisdiction it lay with Congress to determine whether slavery should be lawful or not, and, when any portion of them was ripe for admission to the Union as a State, Congress could insist that the new State's Constitution should or should not prohibit slavery.  When the Constitution of the Union was being settled, slavery was the subject of most careful compromise; but in any union formed between slave States and free, a bitter root of controversy must have remained, and the opening through which controversy actually returned was provided by the Territories.  On all other matters the makers of the Constitution had in the highest temper of statesmanship found a way round seemingly insuperable difficulties.   The whole attitude of \"the fathers\" towards slavery is a question of some consequence to a biographer of Lincoln, and we shall return to it in a little while.   2. _Territorial Expansion_.  A machine of government had been created, and we are shortly to consider how it was got to work.  But the large dominion to be governed had to be settled, and its area was about to undergo an enormous expansion.  It will be convenient at this point to mark the stages of this development.  The thirteen Colonies had, when they first revolted, definite western boundaries, the westernmost of them reaching back from the sea-board to a frontier in the Alleghany Mountains.  But at the close of the war Great Britain ceded to the United States the whole of the inland country up to the Mississippi River.  Virginia had in the meantime effectively colonised Kentucky to the west of her, and for a time this was treated as within her borders.  In a similar way Tennessee had been settled from North and South Carolina and was treated as part of the former.  Virginia had also established claims by conquest north of the Ohio River in what was called the North-West Territory, but these claims and all similar claims of particular States in unsettled or half-settled territory were shortly before or shortly after the adoption of the Constitution ceded to the Union Government.  But the dominions of that Government soon received a vast accession.  In 1803, by a brave exercise of the Constitutional powers which he was otherwise disposed to restrict jealously, President Jefferson bought from Napoleon I. the great expanse of country west of the Mississippi called Louisiana.  This region in the extreme south was no wider than the present State of Louisiana, but further north it widened out so as to take in the whole watershed of the Missouri and its tributaries, including in the extreme north nearly all the present State of Montana.  In 1819 Florida was purchased from Spain, and that country at the same time abandoned its claims to a strip of coastland which now forms the sea-board of Alabama and Mississippi.  Such was the extent of the United States when Lincoln began his political life.  In the movement of population by which this domain was being settled up, different streams may be roughly distinguished.  First, there was from 1780 onwards a constant movement of the poorer class and of younger sons of rich men from the great State of Virginia and to some extent from the Carolinas into Kentucky and Tennessee, whence they often shifted further north into Indiana and Illinois, or sometimes further west into Missouri.  It was mainly a movement of single families or groups of families of adventurous pioneers, very sturdy, and very turbulent.  Then there came the expansion of the great plantation interest in the further South, carrying with it as it spread, not occasional slaves as in Kentucky and Tennessee, but the whole plantation system.  This movement went not only directly westward, but still more by the Gulf of Mexico and up the Mississippi, into the State of Louisiana, where a considerable French population had settled, the State of Mississippi, and later into Missouri.  Later still came the westward movement from the Northern States.  The energies of the people in these States had at first been to great extent absorbed by sea-going pursuits and the subjugation of their own rugged soil, so that they reached western regions like Illinois rather later than did the settlers from States further south.  Ultimately, as their manufactures grew, immigration from Europe began its steady flow to these States, and the great westward stream, which continuing in our days has filled up the rich lands of the far North-West, grew in volume.  But want of natural timber and other causes hindered the development of the fertile prairie soil in the regions beyond the upper Mississippi, till the period of railway development, which began about 1840, was far advanced.  Illinois was Far West in 1830, Iowa and Minnesota continued to be so in 1860.  The Northerners, when they began to move westward, came in comparatively large numbers, bringing comparatively ordered habits and the full machinery of outward civilisation with them.  Thus a great social change followed upon their arrival in the regions to which only scattered pioneers such as the Lincolns had previously penetrated.  In Illinois, with which so much of our story is bound up, the rapidity of that change may be estimated from the fact that the population of that State multiplied sevenfold between the time when Lincoln settled there and the day when he left it as President.  The concluding stages by which the dominions of the United States came to be as we know them were: the annexation by agreement in 1846 of the Republic of Texas, which had separated itself from Mexico and which claimed besides the great State of Texas a considerable territory reaching north-west to the upper portions of the Arkansas River; the apportionment to the Union by a delimitation treaty with Great Britain in 1846 of the Oregon Territory, including roughly the State of that name and the rest of the basin of the Columbia River up to the present frontier--British Columbia being at the same time apportioned to Great Britain; the conquest from Mexico in 1848 of California and a vast mountainous tract at the back of it; the purchase from Mexico of a small frontier strip in 1853; and the acquisition at several later times of various outlying dependencies which will in no way concern us.   3. _The Growth"]]]
