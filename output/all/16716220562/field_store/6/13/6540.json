We may well be proud of the skill and courage with which Lieutenant-Colonel Smith defended his fort against the foe.  \"On the 10th of November the British opened their batteries on land and water. They had five on Province Island, within five hundred yards of the fort; a large floating battery with twenty-two twenty-four pounders, which they brought up within forty yards of an angle of the fort; also six ships, two of them with forty guns each, the others with sixty-four each, all within less than nine hundred yards of the fort.\"  \"More than three hundred guns all firing on that one little fort!\" exclaimed Rosie. \"It is really wonderful how our poor men could stand it.\"  \"Yes, for six consecutive days a perfect storm of bombs and round shot poured upon them,\" said the captain, \"and it must have required no small amount of courage to stand such a tempest.\"  \"I hope they fired back and killed some of those wicked fellows!\" exclaimed Walter, his eyes flashing.  \"You may be sure they did their best to defend themselves and their fort,\" replied the captain. \"And the British loss was great, though the exact number has never been known.  \"Nearly two hundred and fifty of our men were killed or wounded. Lieutenant Treat, commanding the artillery, was killed on the first day by the bursting of a bomb. The next day quite a number of the garrison were killed or wounded, and Colonel Smith himself had a narrow escape.  \"A ball passed through a chimney in the barracks,--whither he had gone intending to write a letter,--scattered the bricks, and one of them striking him on the head knocked him senseless.  \"He was carried across the river to Red Bank, and Major Thayer of the Rhode Island line took command in his place.  \"The first day a battery of two guns was destroyed, a block house and the laboratory were blown up, and the garrison were compelled to keep within the fort. All that night the British threw shells and the scene was a terrible one indeed, especially for the poor fellows inside the fort.  \"The next morning, about sunrise, they saw thirty armed boats coming against them, and that night the heavy floating battery was brought to bear upon the fort. The next morning it opened with terrible effect, yet they endured it, and made the enemy suffer so much from their fire that they began to think seriously of giving up the contest, when one of the men in the fort deserted to them, and his tale of the weakness of the garrison inspiring the British with renewed hope of conquest they prepared for a more general and vigorous assault.  \"At daylight on the 15th two men-of-war, the _Iris_ and the _Somerset_, passed up the channel in front of the fort on Mud Island. Two others--the _Vigilant_ and a hulk with three twenty-four pounders--passed through the narrow channel on the west side and were placed in a position to act in concert with the batteries of Province Island in enfilading the American works.  \"At ten o'clock all was silent, and doubtless our men were awaiting the coming onslaught with intense anxiety, when a signal bugle sounded and instantly all the ships and batteries poured a storm of shot and shell from the mouths of their many guns upon the devoted little garrison.\"  \"Oh, how dreadful!\" sighed Grace. \"Could they stand it, papa?\"  \"They endured it with astonishing courage,\" replied the captain, \"while all day long, and far into the evening, it was kept up without cessation. The yards of the British ships hung nearly over the American battery; and there were musketeers stationed in their tops who immediately shot down every man who showed himself on the platform of the fort. Our men displayed, as I have said, wonderful bravery and endurance; there seems to have been no thought of surrender; but long before night palisades, block houses, parapet, embrasures--all were ruined.  \"Early in the evening Major Thayer sent all but forty of his men to Red Bank. He and the remaining forty stayed on in the fort until midnight, then, setting fire to the remains of the barracks, they also escaped in safety to Red Bank.  \"Lossing tells us that in the course of that last day more than a thousand discharges of cannon, from twelve to thirty-two pounders, were made against the works on Mud Island, and that it was one of the most gallant and obstinate defences of the war.  \"Major Thayer received great credit for his share in it, and was presented with a sword by the Rhode Island Assembly as a token of their appreciation of his services there.\"  \"Did not Captain--afterward Commodore--Talbot do himself great credit there?\" asked Evelyn.  \"Yes; he fought for hours with his wrist shattered by a musket ball; then was wounded in the hip and was sent to Red Bank. He was a very brave man and did much good service during the war, principally on the water, taking vessel after vessel. In the fight with one of them--the _Dragon_--his speaking trumpet was pierced by bullets and the skirts of his coat were shot away.\"  \"How brave he must have been!\" exclaimed Lulu with enthusiasm. \"Don't you think so, papa?\"  \"Indeed, I do,\" replied the captain. \"He was one of the many men of that period of whom their countrymen may be justly proud.\"     CHAPTER V.   Little Ned, who was not very well, began fretting and reaching out his arms to be taken by his father. The captain lifted him tenderly, saying something in a soothing tone, and carried him away to another part of the deck.  Then the young people, gathering about Grandma Elsie, who had been an almost silent listener to Captain Raymond's account of the attacks upon the forts, and the gallant conduct of their defenders, begged her to tell them something more of the stirring events of those revolutionary days.  \"You have visited the places near here where there was fighting in those days, haven't you, mamma?\" asked Walter.  \"Yes, some years ago,\" she replied. \"Ah, how many years ago it was!\" she added musingly; then continued, \"When I was quite a little girl, my father took me to Philadelphia, and a number of other places, where occurred notable events in the war of the Revolution.\"  \"And you will tell us about them, won't you, mamma?\" Walter asked, in coaxing tones.  \"Certainly, if you and the rest all wish it,\" she returned, smiling lovingly into the eager young face, while the others joined in the request.  \"Please tell about Philadelphia first, mamma,\" Walter went on. \"You went to Independence Hall, of course, and we've all been there, I believe; but there must be some other points of interest in and about the city, I should think, that will be rather new to us.\"  \"Yes, there are others,\" she replied, \"though I suppose that to every American Independence Hall is the most interesting of all, since it was there the Continental Congress held its meetings, and its bell that proclaimed the glad tidings that that grand Declaration of Independence had been signed and the colonies of Great Britain had become free and independent States--though there was long and desperate fighting to go through before England would acknowledge it.\"  \"Mamma, don't you hate old England for it?\" cried Walter impulsively, his eyes flashing.  \"No, indeed!\" she replied, laughing softly, and patting his rosy cheek with her still pretty white hand. \"It was not the England of to-day, you must remember, my son, nor indeed the England of that day, but her half crazy king and his ministers, who thought to raise money for him by unjust taxation of the people of this land. 'Taxation without representation is tyranny.' So they felt and said, and as such resisted it.\"  \"And I'm proud of them for doing so!\" he exclaimed, his eyes sparkling. \"Now, what other revolutionary places are to be seen in Philadelphia, mamma?\"  \"There is Christ Church, where Washington, Franklin, members of Congress, and officers of the Continental army used to worship, with its graveyard where Franklin and his wife Deborah lie buried. Major-General Lee too was laid there; also General Mercer, killed at the battle of Princeton, but his body was afterward removed to Laurel Hill Cemetery.\"  \"We will visit Christ Church, I hope,\" said Rosie. \"Carpenter's Hall too, where the first Continental Congress met, and Loxley House, where Lydia Darrah lived in Revolutionary times. You saw that, I suppose, mamma?\"  \"Yes,\" replied her mother, \"but I do not know whether it is, or is not, still standing.\"  \"That's a nice story about Lydia Darrah,\" remarked Walter, with satisfaction. \"I think she showed herself a grand woman; don't you, mamma?\"  \"I do, indeed,\" replied his mother. \"She was a true patriot.\"  \"There were many grand men and women in our country in those times,\" remarked Evelyn Leland. \"The members of that first Congress that met in Carpenter's Hall on Monday, the 5th of September, 1774, were such. Do you not think so, Grandma Elsie?\"  \"Yes, I quite agree with you,\" replied Mrs. Travilla; \"and it was John Adams--himself by no means one of the least--who said, 'There is in the Congress a collection of the greatest men upon the continent in point of abilities, virtues, and fortunes.'\"  \"Washington was one of them, wasn't he, Grandma Elsie?\" asked Lulu.  \"Yes, one of the members from"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18058"],["title","Elsie's Vacation and After Events (#7)"],["body","rginia. The others from that State were Richard Henry Lee, Peyton Randolph, Richard Bland, Benjamin Harrison, Edmund Pendleton, and Patrick Henry. Peyton Randolph was chosen president, and Charles Thomson, of Pennsylvania, secretary.\"  \"And then, I suppose, they set to work on their preparations for fighting their oppressor, George the Third,\" remarked Lulu, half inquiringly.  \"Lossing tells us,\" replied Mrs. Travilla, \"that the delegates from the different colonies then presented their credentials, and after that there was silence, while deep anxiety was depicted on every countenance. It seemed difficult to know how to begin upon the work for which they had been called together. But at length a grave-looking member, in a plain suit of gray, and wearing an unpowdered wig, arose. So plain was his appearance that Bishop White, who was present, afterward telling of the circumstances, said he 'felt a regret that a seeming country parson should so far have mistaken his talents and the theatre for their display.' However, he soon changed his mind as the plain-looking man began to speak; his words were so eloquent, his sentiments so logical, his voice was so musical, that the whole House was electrified, while from lip to lip ran the question, 'Who is he? who is he?' and the few who knew the stranger, answered, 'It is Patrick Henry of Virginia.'\"  \"O mamma, was it before that that he had said, 'Give me liberty or give me death'?\" queried Walter, his eyes sparkling with enthusiasm.  \"No, he said that a few months afterward; but about nine years before, he had startled his hearers in the Virginia House of Burgesses by his cry, 'Cæsar had his Brutus, Charles the First his Cromwell, and George the Third may profit by their example'!\"  \"And now he was starting the Congress at its work!\"  \"You are right; there was no more hesitation; they arranged their business, adopted rules for the regulation of their sessions, and then--at the beginning of the third day, and when about to enter upon the business that had called them together--Mr. Cushing moved that the sessions should be opened with prayer for Divine guidance and aid.  \"Mr. John Adams, in a letter to his wife, written the next day, said that Mr. Cushing's motion was opposed by a member from New York, and one from South Carolina, because the assembly was composed of men of so many different denominations--Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Quakers, Anabaptists, and Episcopalians,--that they could not join in the same act of worship.  \"Then Mr. Samuel Adams arose, and said that he was no bigot and could hear a prayer from any gentleman of piety and virtue who was at the same time a friend to his country. He was a stranger in Philadelphia, but had heard that Mr. Duché deserved that character; so he moved that he--Mr. Duché, an Episcopal clergyman--be desired to read prayers before Congress the next morning.  \"Mr. Duché consented, and the next morning read the prayers and the Psalter for the 7th of September; a part of it was the thirty-fifth psalm, which seemed wonderfully appropriate. Do you remember how it begins? 'Plead my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me. Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.'\"  \"It does seem wonderfully appropriate,\" said Evelyn. \"Oh, I'm sure that God was on the side of the patriots, and helped them greatly in their hard struggle with their powerful foe!\"  \"Yes, only by His all-powerful aid could our liberties have been won, and to Him be all the glory and the praise,\" said Grandma Elsie, gratitude and joy shining in her beautiful eyes.  \"But that wasn't the Congress that signed the Declaration?\" Walter remarked, half inquiringly, half in assertion.  \"No; this was in 1774, and the Declaration was not signed until July, 1776,\" replied his mother.  \"It seems to me,\" remarked Lulu, \"that the Americans were very slow in getting ready to say they would be free from England--free from British tyranny.\"  \"But you know you're always in a great hurry to do things, Lu,\" put in Grace softly, with an affectionate, admiring smile up into her sister's face.  \"Yes, I believe you're right, Gracie,\" returned Lulu, with a pleased laugh and giving Grace's hand a loving squeeze.  \"Yes,\" assented Grandma Elsie, \"our people were slow to break with the mother country--as they used to call old England, the land of their ancestors; they bore long and patiently with her, but at last were convinced that in that case patience had ceased to be a virtue, and liberty for themselves and their children must be secured at all costs.\"  \"How soon were they convinced of it, mamma?\" asked Walter.  \"The conviction came slowly to all, and to some more slowly than to others,\" she replied. \"Dr. Franklin, Samuel Adams, and Patrick Henry were among the first to see the necessity of becoming, politically, entirely free and independent.  \"It is stated on good authority that Patrick Henry in speaking of Great Britain, as early as 1773, said, 'She _will_ drive us to extremities; no accommodation _will_ take place; hostilities _will soon_ commence, and a desperate and bloody touch it will be.'  \"Some one, present when the remark was made, asked Mr. Henry if he thought the colonies strong enough to resist successfully the fleets and armies of Great Britain, and he answered that he doubted whether they would be able to do so alone, 'but that France, Spain, and Holland were the natural enemies of Great Britain.'  \"'Where will they be all this while?' he asked. 'Do you suppose they will stand by, idle and indifferent spectators to the contest? Will Louis XVI. be asleep all this time? Believe me, no! When Louis XVI. shall be satisfied, by our serious opposition and our _Declaration_ of _Independence_, that all prospect of a reconciliation is gone, then, and not till then, will he furnish us with arms, ammunition, and clothing: and not with them only, but he will send his fleets and armies to fight our battles for us; he will form a treaty with us, offensive and defensive, against our unnatural mother. Spain and Holland will join the confederation! Our independence will be established! and we shall take our stand among the nations of the earth!'\"  \"And it all happened so; didn't it, mamma?\" exclaimed Rosie exultantly; \"just as Patrick Henry predicted.\"  \"Yes,\" replied her mother, with a proud and happy smile, \"and we have certainly taken our place--by God's blessing upon the efforts of those brave and gallant heroes of the revolution--as one of the greatest nations of the earth.  \"Yet not all the credit should be awarded them, but some of it given to their successors in the nation's counsels and on the fields of battle. The foundations were well and strongly laid by our revolutionary fathers, and the work well carried on by their successors.\"  \"Grandma Elsie, what was the story about Lydia Darrah?\" asked Gracie. \"I don't remember to have heard it.\"  \"She lived in Philadelphia when the British were in possession there during the winter after the battle of the Brandywine,\" replied Mrs. Travilla. \"She belonged to the Society of Friends, most of whom, as you doubtless remember, took no active part in the war; at least, did none of the fighting, though many helped in other ways; but some were Tories, who gave aid and comfort to the enemy in other ways than by the use of arms.\"  \"What a shame!\" cried Walter. \"You will tell us about the doings of some of those when you are done with the story of Lydia Darrah, won't you, mamma?\"  \"If you all wish it,\" she answered; then went on with her narrative:  \"Judging from her conduct at that time, Lydia must have been an ardent patriot; but patriots and Tories alike had British officers quartered upon them. The adjutant-general took up his quarters in Loxley House, the home of the Darrahs, and, as it was a secluded place, the superior officers frequently held meetings there for private conference on matters connected with the movements of the British troops.\"  \"One day the adjutant-general told Mrs. Darrah that such a meeting was to be held that evening, and that he wanted the upper back room made ready for himself and the friends who would be present. He added that they would be likely to stay late and she must be sure to see that all her family were early in their beds.  \"His tone and manner led Mrs. Darrah to think something of importance was going forward, and though she did not dare disobey his order, she resolved to try to find out what was their object in holding this private night meeting, probably hoping to be able to do something to prevent the carrying out of their plans against the liberties of her country.  \"She sent her family to bed, according to directions, before the officers came, and after admitting them retired to her own couch, but not to sleep, for her thoughts were busy with conjectures in regard to the mischief they--the unwelcome intruders into her house--might be plotting against her country.  \"She had lain down without undressing and after a little she rose and stole softly, in her stocking feet, to the door of the room where they were assembled.  \"All was quiet at the moment when she reached it. She put her ear to the keyhole and--doubtless, with a fast beating heart--waited there, listening intently for the sound of the officers' voices.  \"For a few moments all was silence; then it was broken by a single voice reading aloud an order from Sir William Howe for the troops to march out of the city the next night and make an attack upon Washington's camp at Whitemarsh.  \"Lydia waited to hear no more, for that was sufficient, and it would have been dangerous indeed for her to be caught there.  \"She hastened back to her own room and again threw herself on the bed; but not to sleep, as you may well imagine.  \"Presently the opening and shutting of doors told her that the visitors of the adjutant-general were taking their departure; then there was a rap on her door.
