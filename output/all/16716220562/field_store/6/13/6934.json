They had not had time to carry off their shells, so they had left them behind. But they had had time to empty the bottles. Absinthe, brandy, rum, champagne, beer, and wine had all been consumed, and the labels lay alongside of each other. Drunken, bloodthirsty brutes, thieving, sickening, nauseous beasts were what had descended upon France and passed through her country. Ruins, ashes and filth were the traces left behind by the German mob.  Some hundreds of yards from the village I noticed a woman lost in the immense beet fields. Apparently she was unharmed. I walked in her direction, thrusting aside with my legs corpses of men and horses, scaling the trenches, making a circuit around the craters made by shells. Suddenly what was my surprise at seeing two German soldiers, accompanied by a farmer, coming along a footpath! They stopped at six paces, gave me a military salute, and pointed to the white brassard of the Red Cross they wore on their arms.  \"Where do you come from?\" I asked. \"What are you doing here?\"  \"We come from that farm, where we have been for two days caring for two of our wounded. We didn't see any French soldier or officer. We don't know what to do. We want to go to the village down there,\" they pointed out a hamlet two or three kilometers off, \"where we left a doctor and one hundred and fifty-three wounded.\"  \"Very good,\" I said, \"follow me.\"  Obediently the two orderlies marched behind me to the village they had pointed out. It was situated on the national highway to Soissons. In this place were a hundred and fifty or two hundred Germans, quartered in four or five houses under the guard of a company of Zouaves who had just arrived a half hour previously. The German major, informed of my arrival, stood in front of the main building. He wore gold-rimmed spectacles, his face was the type the Alsatian Hansi loves to show in his books. He spoke very good French and even pretended that he did not want to answer the questions I asked him in his own language.  \"Show me your wounded,\" I ordered.  He immediately conducted me everywhere, explaining the nature of each wound. Some were suffering and groaning; others, seeing the uniform of a French officer, tried to raise themselves up and salute.  The German major asked:  \"When they come to evacuate the wounded to Meaux or some other place, do you suppose I shall be allowed to accompany them and continue my treatment?\"  \"I don't know,\" I replied, \"but there is one thing you can be sure of. My superiors will act in accordance with the demands of humanity. Now you follow me.\"  I led him outside to the doorstep. I pointed out the poor homes of the village, ruined, reduced to dust. Everywhere were the dwellings of the entire region, with their furniture lying in the mud and ashes.  \"Look at that,\" I said to him. \"That is what your men have done.\"  The German officer turned very pale, then very red. He answered:  \"It's sad, but it is war.\"  \"No,\" I replied, \"it isn't war. It's pure barbarism and it's abominable.\"  Some few paces away from us French Zouaves were sitting beside some wounded Germans. In their own glasses they poured out a little cordial for their prisoners; they gave them their last cigarettes. One of them had even taken, as if he were his brother, the head of a wounded German in his left hand to support it. With his right hand, very carefully, he was giving him a drink. I pointed that out to the German major, saying:  \"There! That is war--at least it's war as we understand it.\"  This time he made no answer.  But all the German prisoners repeated what he had said to me as a set phrase. On the whole, when you have seen ten German prisoners you have seen a thousand; when you have questioned one German officer you have questioned fifty. The characteristic of the race is that they have abolished all individuality. You find yourself in an amorphous mass, cast in a uniform mold, not in the presence of human beings who think their own thoughts.  I often saw trains stop in what is called a _gare regulatrice_, where the prisoners are questioned and distributed. These trains bring in prisoners and their officers. The commandant of the station, in accordance with his duty, has the officers appear before him so that he can question them:  \"Your name? Your rank?\"  The German states his name and rank, offering of necessity his identification card.  \"Your regiment?\"  \"Such and such a regiment.\"  \"Your army corps?\"  \"Such and such an army corps.\"  \"Who is the general in command?\"  Like an automaton the officer replies:  \"_Das sage ich nicht._\" (\"I can not answer that.\")  And you know that it would be an easier matter to make the stone beneath your feet talk than one of these prisoners.  However, the commandant frowns slightly, glances over his notes, and says coldly:  \"I know who your general is. If you belong to such and such an army corps, the general in command must be General von Bissing.\"...  \"I have nothing to say.\"  As a general thing one of the staff had something to say. The interpreter, the convoy officer or the station master would get a lot of fun out of reciting to the German passages from von Bissing's famous and ferocious proclamation ordering that no quarter be given and that the troops should not encumber themselves with prisoners. Then he would ask:  \"What would you say if we were to put such a principle into practice?\"  The German often became very pale. He would content himself with a shrug of the shoulders--the shrug of the brute who knows that he is safe among civilized men.  The men I questioned were often doctors who ranked as majors or held some commission in the German medical corps. They were less stiff and automaton-like than the officers and sergeants of the line service. Their attitude varied in accordance with the number of stars they had on their epaulette. If their rank were inferior to mine, they were exaggeratedly obsequious, holding their hands along the crease in the seam of their trousers with their fingers close together--at strict attention. If their rank were superior to mine, they were defiant and insolent. Nevertheless, they showed themselves more communicative than their comrades of the line service. Most of them spoke French--well enough, though not perfectly. All of them had been in Paris, and one and all repeated this phrase:  \"We know your beautiful country well. We have been in your beautiful capital often....\"  For my part, I invariably spoke to them of the atrocities their men had perpetrated in that beautiful country, or of those they had perpetrated in the country of our beautiful neighbor.... Rheims, Ypres, Louvain, Andenne, were the names that always returned to my lips. I hoped each time that I would get from those men who, in spite of everything, were men of science, members of humanity's most generous profession, if not a word of contrition at least a banal word of regret. Since they had not ordered the sacrileges or the massacres, they need not keep silent. But it was all in vain. They also excused, justified and explained....  The explanation was simple and stereotyped. For the battered Cathedral of Rheims, for the total destruction of Clermont, for the systematic laying-waste of Louvain, for the frightful company of old men, women and children who were dragged off into captivity, three words were the justification--the three words of the German major at Vincy:  \"_Das ist Krieg._\" (\"It is war.\")  For the blackened ruins of Senlis, for that charming city of Louvain, razed to the ground in one night as completely as if the scourge of God had passed through it; for Andenne, assassinated in cold blood with not one of its houses being granted mercy by the assassins; for Termonde, where General Sommerfeld, seated in a chair in the midst of the Grande Place, gave the order that it be burned and replied to the entreaties of the mayor:  \"No. Burn it to the ground!\"  Five other words sufficed to explain everything:  \"Civilians fired on our troops.\"  Not one village in flames, not one desecrated monument, not one organized killing, not one tortured city that does not fall under the scope of one or the other of those justifications, \"War is war,\" or \"Civilians fired on our troops.\"  Doctors, savants, officers, Bavarians, Saxons, and Prussians have adopted the double excuse with a marvelous unity: they advance it in a certain tone of voice. It is firmly embedded in what is left of their consciences as firmly as the iron cross is riveted on their necks.  Besides, it was all planned, wished for, arranged in advance. German frightfulness formed a part of the plan of campaign. It is enough to read the manual called \"Kriegesgebrauch in Landkriege\" (Military Usage in Landwarfare) to be very much edified. Every German officer has had this manual in his hands since the days of peace. It comprised his rules of warfare. It was a part of his war equipment, the same as his field glasses and his staff-officer's card. And here is what he reads on the very first page:       War carried on energetically can not be directed against the      inhabitants and fortified places of the hostile state alone;      it will endeavor, it ought to endeavor to _destroy equally      all the enemy's intellectual and material resources_.      Humanitarian considerations, that is, consideration for the      persons of individuals and for the sake of propriety, can      have no recognition unless the end and nature of the war      allow it.  And, a little farther on, he reads there:       Profound study of the history of war will make the officer      guard against exaggerated humanitarian concessions, will      teach him that war can not take place without certain      harshness, _that true humanity consists in proceeding      without tenderness_.  Farther along in that book, he reads:       All the methods invented by the technic of modern warfare,      the most perfected as well as the most"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18483"],["title","Fighting France (#5)"],["body","erous, _those      which kill the greatest number at once, are permitted_.      These last are conducive to the quickest end of the war;      they are, if you consider matters carefully, the most humane      methods.... Prisoners may be killed in case of necessity if      there is no other means of guarding them properly.... The      presence of women, children, old men, the sick and the      wounded in a beseiged city can hasten the place's fall; in      consequence it would be very foolish of the beseiger to      renounce this advantage.... They will force the inhabitants      to furnish information concerning their army, military      resources and secrets of their country. The majority of      writers in all nations condemn this usage. _It will be used      none the less_--very regretfully--for military reasons.  Finally, on the volume's last page, is found this extraordinary maxim:       \"Any wrong that the war demands, however great it may be, is      allowed.\"  Therefore the horrors which the Germans performed from the war's very beginning, which provoked an expression of great indignation from all the civilized world, were not perpetrated in a moment of orgy or madness. They have been perpetrated coldly, deliberately, intentionally.  Besides, not only the officers and the common soldiers have been taught to make war in this barbarous fashion. It has been taught to the entire German people. This precept proves the case. It emanates not from a soldier but from a poet, who is not addressing the military class but the civilians, the women, the children, and all Germany. It is the \"Hymn of Hate\" by the poet Heinrich Vierordt, which, before the war, was recited in even the German kindergartens:       Hate, Germany! Slit the throats of your millions of enemies.      Raise a monument of their smoking corpses that will rise to      the heavens!       Germany, arm yourself with brazen armor and pierce with your      bayonet the heart of every enemy. Take no prisoners! Strike      them dumb. Transform into deserts the lands that lie near      you!       Hate, Germany! Victory will come from your anger. Shatter      their skulls with blows from your ax and the butt of your      musket. These brigands are timid beasts.... They are not      men.... May your fist perform the judgment of God!  It is useless to say what this spirit has brought about. Germany has carried on the war with vigor, has armed herself with brazen armor! She has transformed neighboring lands into deserts! She has slit throats, laid waste fields, shattered skulls, she has destroyed all that lay in her path! She has tried to impress the terror she holds salutary upon the souls of inoffensive old men and women and children!  This is the first of all the reasons why it is necessary now to fight, and to fight to the death; because these men will understand the abominable nature of \"frightfulness\" only when they see that \"frightfulness\" does not pay; only when they see the uselessness of unchaining horror and of beginning another war. Let an assassin go at liberty and he will commence his killing all over again; send him to the electric chair and he will regret his crime.         *       *       *       *       *  Just as France and Paris were not long in understanding what war meant in Germany's mind, France and Paris were not long in accounting for the danger they had passed through on account of the German spy system, on account of the formidable web of espionage the German agents had woven around all France.  People felt that this German spy system was there, speculated about it and talked about it for years and years, but it was only in the first days of the war that they really appreciated how diabolical it was and how far it had penetrated into the heart of France.  What happened at Amiens at the beginning of September, 1914, is especially characteristic of this.  Amiens was occupied twice by the enemy. To use the expression of a military historian, it seemed as if \"the French and the Germans were playing hide-and-seek around the town.\" As soon as the blue caps of the French appeared over the horizon, the yellow pointed helmets of the Germans disappeared, rapidly. German occupation meant the same thing it did everywhere else--exactions, brutalities, rape. Immediately after he had entered the Prefecture, the German governor levied a war contribution of one million francs. He also demanded that the citizens furnish his troops with wine, cigars, and tobacco; drew up a list of hostages; and arrested all the men between the ages of seventeen and twenty years. Within twenty-four hours they were led away under guard.  Nothing of all this surprised the brave Picard city. Proudly she submitted to her fate. But one thing moved her, or rather angered her, and that was the surety and speed with which the German authorities went directly to all the places they should occupy. They did not hesitate an instant about the street to follow or the door at which to knock. The arrest of the fifteen hundred young hostages occurred with an unheard-of rapidity. It seemed as if an invisible but exceedingly clever hand guided each step, regulated each movement of the invaders. Who could it be who directed, advised and commanded the Germans from behind a veil?  Doubtless the mystery would never have been solved if, during the second occupation, the citizens had not been warned that the next day they would have to keep their shades down and close all shutters because His Imperial Highness, Prince Eitel Friedrich, the Kaiser's son, would then make a formal entry into the capital of Picardy. The shutters were closed; automatically the streets were emptied.  Into a deserted city, to the sound of trumpet and drum, preceded by a staff gleaming with gold braid and mounted on spirited steeds, the German army entered in state. All the shades were drawn in the city. However, behind some of them drawn faces peered forth in sorrow or in anger. In a house on the principal street was a lady whose husband was at the front. Her father, an aged general who had fought bravely in the war of 1870, was with her. Through the drawn shades of her home she was watching the hated scene. And her glorious old father, however indignant he felt, was watching by her side.  When the parade was passing by, he made a sudden gesture and said:  \"Look at that man on the horse, there, now!\"  The man in question seemed to have a horse that pranced a little more than the others. He rolled around in his saddle a little more than the others. And the two onlookers had no trouble in recognizing this aide-de-camp of Prince Eitel's as one of the former directors of a language school that had had a branch at Amiens!  There is a sequel to the story ... for on the afternoon of that unhappy day Madame X and ten other society ladies of Amiens at different times heard a ring at their doors and saw that same individual, in full regalia, booted and spurred, enter their drawing rooms. He came to call on them, to pay his respects, as if it were the most natural thing in the world that he should be there in that costume. They all had to restrain the feeling of disgust and anger this spy aroused in their breasts. It was for the sake of the safety of their homes, for the lives that were dear to them, that they did this. And he, entirely unconscious in his vileness, was suave and polite, played the man about town, recalled one thing or another, mentioned dances and parties....  So we once more find justification for the famous definition of German contained in Schopenhauer's famous phrase: \"The German is remarkable for the absolute lack of that feeling which the Latins call 'verecundia'--sense of shame.\"  The essence of this feeling which is found among the most savage peoples is entirely lacking in the Teutonic race. And once more we find an abominable ambush placed for French culture, good faith and generosity.  This is not an isolated incident. When the whole truth is known, there will be even more surprised indignation felt than there is at present. Inquiries will have to be made. It will be necessary to know why the enemy, in certain places, has rushed in as if he came out of a trap door. It will be necessary to know why, in certain ravaged districts, some houses have been entirely destroyed and others carefully spared. It will be necessary to know why tennis courts have been put in certain places and why certain masses of rhododendrons have been planted in certain parks....  For we know that the tennis courts have helped the Germans carry out their schemes, and that the flower beds have had a place in the machinery of war they were developing, which they kept alive until they were at our gates. A tennis match seems a mere nothing--something very innocent in the way of pleasure, far from being war-like. And then, one fine day the discovery is made that the tennis court has a foundation of reinforced concrete twenty centimeters thick, fit to support a house six stories high and, consequently, a heavy gun!  A clump of rhododendrons is very lovely, something very gracious, charming, most poetic. And one day the discovery is made that the clump conceals a platform set in concrete on which an entire battery can be aligned.  All that will have to be investigated. All that will have to be stopped.... And it makes another reason why it is necessary to fight today, to fight to the death. For these Germans will understand the inanity of their Machiavellian scheming and of their spy system only when they shall see these methods fall to pieces, when they shall see their system fail absolutely.  In conclusion we may say that France fights for two reasons. The first reason is because on the third of August at a quarter before seven o'clock war was declared on her; she was forced to fight; her territory was invaded, her cities burned to the ground; her fields ravaged; her citizens massacred. The second reason is because she does not want "]]]
