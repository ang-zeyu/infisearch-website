And so all the Maynards will weep and will bawl,     Till Kitty-Cat Kitty comes home in the fall.\"  This affecting ditty was being sung with great gusto by King and Marjorie, while Kitty, her mood divided between smiles and tears, was quietly appreciative.  The very next day, Kitty was to start for Morristown, to spend the summer with Grandma Sherwood, and to-night the \"Farewell Feast\" was to be celebrated.  Every year one of the Maynard children spent the summer months with their grandmother, and this year it was Kitty's turn. The visit was always a pleasant one, and greatly enjoyed by the small visitor, but there was always a wrench at parting, for the Maynard family were affectionate and deeply devoted to one another.  The night before the departure was always celebrated by a festival of farewell, and at this feast tokens were presented, and speeches made, and songs sung, all of which went far to dispel sad or gloomy feelings.  The Maynards were fond of singing. They were willing to sing \"ready-made\" songs, and often did, but they liked better to make up songs of their own, sometimes using familiar tunes and sometimes inventing an air as they went along. Even if not quite in keeping with the rules for classic music, these airs were pleasing in their own ears, and that was all that was necessary.  So, when King and Midget composed the touching lines which head this chapter and sang them to the tune of \"The Campbells are Coming,\" they were so pleased that they repeated them many times.  This served to pass pleasantly the half-hour that must yet elapse before dinner would be announced.  \"Well, Kit,\" remarked Kingdon, in a breathing pause between songs, \"we'll miss you lots, o' course, but you'll have a gay old time at Grandma's. That Molly Moss is a whole team in herself.\"  \"She's heaps of fun, Kitsie,\" said Marjorie, \"but she's chock-a-block full of mischief. But you won't tumble head over heels into all her mischiefs, like I did! 'Member how I sprained my ankle, sliding down the barn roof with her?\"  \"No, of course I wouldn't do anything like that,\" agreed the sedate Kitty. \"But we'll have lots of fun with that tree-house; I'm going to sit up there and read, on pleasant days.\"  \"H'm,--lucky,--you know what, King!\"  \"H'm,--yes! Keep still, Mops. You'll give it away.\"  \"Oh, a secret about a present,\" cried Kitty; \"something for the tree-house, I know!\"  \"Maybe 'tis, and maybe 'tain't,\" answered King, with a mysterious wink at Marjorie.  \"Me buyed present for Kitty,\" said Rosamond, smiling sweetly; \"gold an' blue,--oh, a bootiful present.\"  \"Hush, hush, Rosy Posy, you mustn't tell,\" said her brother. \"Presents are always surprises. Hey, girls, here's Father!\"  Mr. Maynard's appearance was usually a signal for a grand rush, followed by a series of bear hugs and a general scramble, but to-night, owing to festive attire, the Maynard quartette were a little more demure.  \"Look out for my hair-ribbons, King!\" cried Midget, for without such warning, hair-ribbons usually felt first the effects of the good-natured scrimmage.  And then Mrs. Maynard appeared, her pretty rose-colored gown of soft silk trailing behind her on the floor.  \"What a dandy mother!\" exclaimed King; \"all dressed up, and a flower in her hair!\"  This line sounded singable to Marjorie, so she tuned up:      \"All dressed up, and a flower in her hair,     To give her a hug, I wouldn't dare;     For she would feel pretty bad, I think,     If anything happened to that there pink!\"  Then King added a refrain, and in a moment they had all joined hands and were dancing round Mrs. Maynard and singing:      \"Hooray, hooray, for our mother fair!     Hooray, hooray, for the flower in her hair!     All over the hills and far away,     There's no one so sweet as Mothery May!\"  Being accustomed to boisterous adulation from her children, Mrs. Maynard bore her honors gracefully, and then they all went out to dinner.  As Maiden of Honor, Kitty was escorted by her father; next came Mrs. Maynard and Kingdon, and then Marjorie and Rosy Posy. The table had extra decorations of flowers and pink-shaded candles, and at Kitty's place was a fascinating looking lot of tissue-papered and ribbon-tied parcels.  \"Isn't it funny,\" said sedate and philosophical Kitty, \"I love to go to Grandma's, and yet I hate to leave you all, and yet, I can't do one without doing the other!\"  \"'Tis strange, indeed, Kit!\" agreed her father; \"as Mr. Shakespeare says, 'Yet every sweet with sour is tempered still.' Life is like lemonade, sour and sweet both.\"  \"It's good enough,\" said Kitty, contentedly, looking at her array of bundles. \"I guess I'll open these now.\"  \"That's what they're there for,\" said Mrs. Maynard, so Kitty excitedly began to untie the ribbons.  \"I'll go slowly,\" she said, pulling gently at a ribbon bow, \"then they'll last longer.\"  \"Now, isn't that just like you, Kit!\" exclaimed Marjorie. \"I'd snatch the papers off so fast you couldn't see me jerk.\"  \"I know you would,\" said Kitty, simply.  The sisters were very unlike, for Midget's ways were impulsive and impatient, while Kitty was slow and careful. But finally the papers came off, and revealed the lovely gifts.  Mrs. Maynard had made a pretty silk workbag, which could be spread out, or gathered up close on its ribbon. When outspread, it showed a store of needles and thread, of buttons, hooks, tapes,--everything a little girl could need to keep her clothes in order.  \"Oh, Mother, it's _perfect_!\" cried Kitty, ecstatically. \"I _love_ those cunning little pockets, with all _sewy_ things in them! And a darling silver thimble! And a silver tape measure, and a silver-topped emery! Oh, I do believe I'll sew _all_ the time this summer!\"  \"Pooh, _I_ wouldn't!\" said Marjorie. \"The things _are_ lovely, but I'd rather play than sew.\"  \"Sewing _is_ play, I think,\" and Kitty fingered over her treasures lovingly. \"Grandma will help me with my patterns, and I'm going to piece a silk teachest quilt. Oh, Mother, it will be _such_ fun!\"  \"Call _that_ fun!\" and Marjorie looked disdainfully at her sister. \"Fun is racing around and playing tag, and cutting up jinks generally!\"  \"For you it is,\" Kitty agreed, amiably, \"but not for me. I like what I like.\"  \"That's good philosophy, Kitty,\" said her father. \"Stick to it always. Like what you like, and don't be bothered by other people's comments or opinions. Now, what's in that smallish, flattish, whitish parcel?\"  The parcel in question proved to be a watch, a dear little gold watch. Kitty had never owned one before, and it almost took her breath away.  \"Mine?\" she exclaimed, in wonder. \"All mine?\"  \"Yes, every bit yours,\" said Mr. Maynard, smiling at her. \"Every wheel and spring, every one of its three hands, every one of its twelve hours are all, all yours. Do you like it?\"  \"Like it! I can't think of any words to tell you how much I like it.\"  \"I'll think of some for you,\" said the accommodating Marjorie. \"You could say it's the grandest, gloriousest, gorgeousest, magnificentest present you ever had!\"  \"Yes, I could say that,\" Kitty agreed, \"but I never should have thought of it. I 'most always say a thing is lovely. Now, what in the world is this?\"  \"This\" proved to be a well-stocked portfolio, the gift of King. There were notepaper and envelopes and a pen and pencils and stamps and everything to write letters with.  \"I picked out all the things myself,\" King explained, \"because it's nicer that way than the ready furnished ones. Do you like it, Kit?\"  \"Yes, indeedy! And I shall write my first letter to you, because you gave it to me.\"      \"Oh, Kitty-Cat Kit, a letter she writ,     And sent it away, to her brother one day,\"  chanted Marjorie, and, as was their custom, they all sang the song after her, some several times over.  \"Now for mine,\" Midget said, as Kitty slowly untied the next parcel. It was two volumes of Fairy Tales, which literature was Kitty's favorite reading.  \"Oh, lovely!\" she exclaimed. \"On summer afternoons you can think of me, sitting out in the tree-house reading these. I shall pretend I'm a Fairy Princess. These are beautiful stories, I can see that already.\"  Kitty's quick eye had caught an interesting page, and forgetting all else,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18035"],["title","Marjorie at Seacote (#1)"],["body"," she became absorbed in the book at once. In a moment, the page was turned, and Kitty read on and on, oblivious to time or place.  \"Hi, there, Kitsie! Come out o' that!\" cried King. \"You can read all summer,--_now_ you must associate with your family.\"  \"I didn't mean to,\" said Kitty, shutting the book quickly, and looking round apologetically; \"but it's all about a fairy godmother, and a lovely princess lady,--oh, Mopsy, it's _fine_!\"  A pair of little blue enamelled pins was Rosamond's present, and Kitty pinned them on her shoulders at once, to see how they looked. All pronounced the effect excellent, and Rosy Posy clapped her little fat hands in glee.  \"Mine's the prettiest present!\" she said. \"Mine's the booflest!\"  \"Yes, Babykins,\" said Kitty, \"yours is the booflest,--but they're all lovely.\"  The Farewell Feast included all of Kitty's favorite dishes, and as most of them were also favorites with the other children, it was satisfactory all round.  \"You must write to us often, Kit,\" said King; \"I gave you those writing things so you'd be sure to.\"  \"Yes, I will; but I don't know yet where you're all going to be.\"  \"I don't know yet myself,\" said Mr. Maynard, \"but it will be somewhere near the sea, if possible. Will you like the seashore, Kiddies,--you that are going?\"  \"I shall,\" said Marjorie, promptly. \"I'll _love_ it. May we go bathing every day? And can I have a bathing suit,--red, trimmed with white?\"  \"I 'spect you can,\" said her mother, smiling at her. \"What color do you want, King?\"  \"Oh, I think dark blue would suit my manly beauty! What are you going to have, Father?\"  \"I think dark blue will be our choice, my boy. It swims better than anything else. But first we must find a roof to cover our heads. I've about decided on one,--if I can get it. It's a bungalow.\"  \"What's a bungalow?\" asked Marjorie. \"I never heard of such a thing.\"  \"Ho, ho! Never heard of a bungalow!\" said King. \"Why, a bungalow is a,--is a,----\"  \"Well, is a what?\" asked Midget, impatiently.  \"Why, it's a bungalow! That's what it is.\"  \"Fine definition, King!\" said his father. \"But since you undertook to do so, see if you can't give its meaning better than that. What _is_ a bungalow?\"  \"Well, let me see. It's a house,--I guess it's a low, one-storied house, and that's why they call it bungalow. Is that it?\"  \"You're right about the one story; the rest is, I think, your own invention. Originally, the bungalow was the sort of a house they have in India, a one-storied affair, with a thatched roof, and verandas all round it. But the ones they build now, in this country, are often much more elaborate than that. Sometimes they have one story, sometimes more. The one I'm trying to get for the summer is at Seacote, and it's what they call a story and a half. That is, it has an upper floor, but the rooms are under a slanting roof, and have dormer windows.\"  \"Sounds good to me,\" said King. \"Do you think you'll catch it, Dad?\"  \"I hope so. Some other person has the refusal of it, but he's doubtful about taking it. So it may yet fall to our lot.\"  \"I hope so!\" cried Marjorie. \"At the seashore for a whole summer! My! what fun! Can we dig in the sand?\"  \"Well, rather, my child! That's what the sand is there for. Kitty, you were at the seashore last summer. Did you dig in the sand?\"  \"Yes, every day; and it was lovely. But this year I'm glad I'm going to Grandma's. It's more restful.\"  They all laughed at Kitty's desire for rest, and Marjorie said:  \"_I_ didn't have such a restful time at Grandma's. Except when I sprained my ankle,--I rested enough then! But you won't do anything like that, Kit!\"  \"I hope not, I'm sure. Nor I won't fall down the well, either!\"  \"Oh, we didn't _fall_ down the well. We just _went_ down, to get cooled off.\"  \"Well, I'm not going to try it. I shall sit in the tree-house and read every afternoon, and sew with Grandma in the mornings.\"  \"Kit, you're a dormouse,\" said Kingdon; \"I believe you'd like to sleep half the year.\"  \"'Deed I wouldn't. Just because I don't like rambunctious play doesn't mean I want to sleep all the time! Does it, Father?\"  \"Not a bit of it. But you children must 'like what you like' and not comment on others' 'likes.' See?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said King, understanding the kindly rebuke. \"Hullo, Kit, here's one of your best 'likes'! Here's pink ice-cream coming!\"  This was indeed one of Kitty's dearest \"likes,\" and as none of the Maynards disliked it, it rapidly disappeared.  \"Now, we'll have an entertainment,\" said King as, after dinner, they all went back to the pleasant living-room. \"As Kitty is the chief pebble on the beach this evening, she shall choose what sort of an entertainment. Games, or what?\"  \"No, just a real entertainment,\" said Kitty; \"a programme one, you know. Each one must sing a song or speak a piece, or something like that. _I'll_ be the audience, and you can all be performers.\"  \"All right,\" said King; \"I'll be master of ceremonies. I'll make up the programme as I go along. Ladies and gentlemen, our first number will be a speech by the Honorable Edward Maynard. Mr. Maynard will please step forward.\"  Mr. Maynard stepped. Assuming a pompous air, he made a low bow, first to Kitty, and then to the others.  \"My dear friends,\" he said, \"we are gathered here together this evening to extend our farewells and our hearty good wishes to the lady about to leave us. Sister, thou art mild and lovely, and we hate to see thee go; but the best of friends must sever, and you'll soon come back, you know. Listen now to our advices. Kitty, dear, for pity's sake, do not tumble in the river,--do not tumble in the lake. Many more things I could tell you as I talk in lovely rhyme, but I think it is my duty to let others share the time.\"  Mr. Maynard sat down amid great applause, and Kitty said, earnestly, \"You are a lovely poet, Father. I wish you'd give up your other business, and just write books of poetry.\"  \"I'm afraid, Kitsie, we wouldn't have enough money for pink ice-cream in that case,\" said Mr. Maynard, laughing.  \"The next performeress will be Mrs. Maynard,\" announced the master of ceremonies.  Mother Maynard rose, smiling, and with all the airs and graces of a prima donna, went to the piano. Striking a few preliminary chords, she began to sing:      \"Good-bye, Kitty; good-bye, Kitty; good-bye, Kitty,       You're going to leave us now.     Merrily we say good-bye,           Say good-bye, say good-bye;     Merrily we say good-bye           To sister Kitty-Kit.\"  This had a pleasant jingle, and was repeated by the whole assembly with fine effect and a large volume of noise.  \"Miss Marjorie Maynard will now favor us,\" was the next announcement.  \"This is a poem I made up myself,\" said Midget, modestly, \"and I think it's very nice:      \"When Kitty goes to Grandma's       I hope she will be good;     And be a lady-girl and do       Exactly as she should.     'Cause when _I go_ to Grandma's,       I act exceeding bad;     I track up 'Liza's nice clean floor,       And make her hopping mad!\"  Marjorie's poem was applauded with cheers, as they all recognized its inherent truth.  \"We next come to Miss Rosamond Maynard,\" King went on, \"but as she has fallen asleep, I will ask that the audience kindly excuse her.\"  The audience kindly did so, and as it was getting near everybody's bedtime,--at least, for children,--the whole quartette was started bedward, and went away singing:      \"Good-bye, Kitty, you're going to leave us now\"--     CHAPTER II  TOM, DICK, AND HARRY   \"Jumping Grasshoppers! What a dandy house!\"  The Maynards' motor swung into the driveway of a large and pleasant looking place, whose lawn showed some sand spots here and there, and whose trees were tall pines, but whose whole effect was delightfully breezy and seashorey.  \"Oh, grandiferous!\" cried Marjorie, echoing her brother's enthusiastic tones, and standing up in the car, better to see their new home.  Seacote, the place chosen by Mr. Maynard for his family's summering, was on the southern shore of Long Island, not very far from Rockaway Beach. It was a sort of park or reservation in which building was under certain restrictions, and so it was made up of pleasant homes filled with pleasant people.  Fortunately, Mr. Maynard had been able to rent the bungalow he wanted, and it was this picturesque domicile that so roused King's admiration.  The house was long and low, and surrounded by verandas, some of which were screened by vines, and others shaded by striped awnings.  But what most delighted the children was the fact that the ocean rolled its crested breakers up to their very door. Not literally to the door, for the road ran between the sea and the house, and a boardwalk was between the road and the sea. But not fifty feet from their front windows the shining waves were even now dashing madly toward them as if in tumultuous welcome.  The servants were already installed, and the open doors seemed to invite the family to come in and make themselves at home.  \"Let's go straight bang through the whole house,\" said King, \"and then outdoors afterward.\"  \"All right,\" agreed Marjorie, and in their usual impetuous fashion, the two raced through the house from attic to cellar, though there really wasn't any attic, except a sort of low-ceiled loft. However, they climbed up into this, and then down through the various bedrooms on the second floor, and back to the first floor, which contained the large living-room, a spacious hall, and the dining-room and kitchen.  \"It's all right,\" said King, nodding his head in approval. \"Now outside, Midget.\"  Outside they flew, and took stock of their surroundings. Almost an acre of ground was theirs, and though as yet empty of special interest, King could see its possibilities.  \"Room for a tennis court,\" he said; \"then I guess we'll have a big swing, and a hammock, and a tent, and----\"  \"And a merry-go-round,\" supplemented Mr. Maynard, overhearing King's plans.  \"No, not that, Father,\" said Marjorie, \"b"]]]
