A vowel is short before _nt_ and _nd_, before final _m_ or _t_,   and, except in words of one syllable, before final _l_ or _r_. Thus   «a´-mănt», «a-măn´-dus», «a-mā´-băm», «a-mā´-băt», «a´-ni-măl»,   «a´-mŏr».    3. A vowel is long before _nf_, _ns_, _nx_, and _nct_. Thus   «īn´-fe-rō», «re´-gēns», «sān´-xī», «sānc´-tus».    4. Diphthongs are always long, and are not marked.  «13.» «Quantity of Syllables.» Syllables are either long or short, and their quantity must be carefully distinguished from that of vowels.    1. «A syllable is short»,      _a._ If it ends in a short vowel; as «ă´-mō», «pĭ´-grĭ».  NOTE. In final syllables the short vowel may be followed by a final consonant. Thus the word «mĕ-mŏ´-rĭ-ăm» contains four short syllables. In the first three a short vowel ends the syllable, in the last the short vowel is followed by a final consonant.    2. «A syllable is long»,      _a._ If it contains a long vowel or a diphthong, as «cū´-rō»,     «poe´-nae», «aes-tā´-te».      _b._ If it ends in a consonant which is followed by another     consonant, as «cor´-pus», «mag´-nus».  NOTE. The vowel in a long syllable may be either long or short, and should be pronounced accordingly. Thus in «ter´-ra», «in´-ter», the first syllable is long, but the vowel in each case is short and should be given the short sound. In words like «saxum» the first syllable is long because _x_ has the value of two consonants (_cs_ or _gs_).    3. In determining quantity _h_ is not counted a consonant.  NOTE. Give about twice as much time to the long syllables as to the short ones. It takes about as long to pronounce a short vowel plus a consonant as it does to pronounce a long vowel or a diphthong, and so these quantities are considered equally long. For example, it takes about as long to say «cŭr´-rō» as it does «cū´-rō», and so each of these first syllables is long. Compare «mŏl´-lis» and «mō´-lis», «ā-mĭs´-sī» and «ā-mi´-sī».   ACCENT  «14.» Words of two syllables are accented on the first, as «mēn´-sa», «Cae´-sar».  «15.» Words of more than two syllables are accented on the penult if the penult is long. If the penult is short, accent the antepenult. Thus «mo-nē´-mus», «re´-gi-tur», «a-gri´-co-la», «a-man´-dus».  NOTE. Observe that the position of the accent is determined by the length of the _syllable_ and not by the length of the vowel in the syllable. (Cf. §13.2, Note.)  «16.» Certain little words called _enclit´ics_[5] which have no separate existence, are added to and pronounced with a preceding word. The most common are «-que», _and_; «-ve», _or_; and «-ne», the question sign. The syllable before an enclitic takes the accent, regardless of its quantity. Thus «populus´que», «dea´que», «rēgna´ve», «audit´ne».      [Footnote 5: Enclitic means _leaning back_, and that is, as you see,     just what these little words do. They cannot stand alone and so they     lean back for support upon the preceding word.]  HOW TO READ LATIN  «17.» To read Latin well is not so difficult, if you begin right. Correct habits of reading should be formed now. Notice the quantities carefully, especially the quantity of the penult, to insure your getting the accent on the right syllable. (Cf. §15.) Give every vowel its proper sound and every syllable its proper length. Then bear in mind that we should read Latin as we read English, in phrases rather than in separate words. Group together words that are closely connected in thought. No good reader halts at the end of each word.  «18.» Read the stanzas of the following poem by Longfellow, one at a time, first the English and then the Latin version. The syllables inclosed in parentheses are to be slurred or omitted to secure smoothness of meter.  EXCELSIOR [[HIGHER]]! [6]    The shades of night were falling fast,   As through an Alpine village passed   A youth, who bore, ’mid snow and ice,   A banner with the strange device,            Excelsior!        Cadēbant noctis umbrae, dum       Ibat per vīcum Alpicum       Gelū nivequ(e) adolēscēns,       Vēxillum cum signō ferēns,                Excelsior!    His brow was sad; his eye beneath,   Flashed like a falchion from its sheath,   And like a silver clarion rung   The accents of that unknown tongue,            Excelsior!        Frōns trīstis, micat oculus       Velut ē vāgīnā gladius;       Sonantque similēs tubae       Accentūs lingu(ae) incognitae,                Excelsior!    In happy homes he saw the light   Of household fires gleam warm and bright;   Above, the spectral glaciers shone,   And from his lips escaped a groan,            Excelsior!        In domibus videt clārās       Focōrum lūcēs calidās;       Relucet glaciēs ācris,       Et rumpit gemitūs labrīs,                Excelsior!    “Try not the Pass!” the old man said;   “Dark lowers the tempest overhead,   The roaring torrent is deep and wide!”   And loud that clarion voice replied,         Excelsior!        Dīcit senex, “Nē trānseās!       Suprā nigrēscit tempestās;       Lātus et altus est torrēns.”       Clāra vēnit vōx respondēns,             Excelsior!    At break of day, as heavenward   The pious monks of Saint Bernard   Uttered the oft-repeated prayer,   A voice cried through the startled air,         Excelsior!        Iam lūcēscēbat, et frātrēs       Sānctī Bernardī vigilēs       Ōrābant precēs solitās,       Cum vōx clāmāvit per aurās,             Excelsior!    A traveler, by the faithful hound,   Half-buried in the snow was found,   Still grasping in his hand of ice   That banner with the strange device,         Excelsior!        Sēmi-sepultus viātor       Can(e) ā fīdō reperītur,       Comprēndēns pugnō gelidō       Illud vēxillum cum signō,             Excelsior!    There in the twilight cold and gray,   Lifeless, but beautiful, he lay,   And from the sky, serene and far,   A voice fell, like a falling star,         Excelsior!         Iacet corpus exanimum       Sed lūce frīgidā pulchrum;       Et caelō procul exiēns       Cadit vōx, ut Stella cadēns,           Excelsior!      [Footnote 6: Translation by C. W. Goodchild in _Praeco Latinus_,     October, 1898.]     PART II  WORDS AND FORMS   LESSON I  FIRST PRINCIPLES  «19.» «Subject and Predicate.»   1. Latin, like English, expresses thoughts by means of sentences.   A sentence is a combination of words that expresses a thought, and in   its simplest form is the statement of a single fact. Thus,    _Galba is a farmer_     «Galba est agricola»   _The sailor fights_     «Nauta pugnat»  In each of these sentences there are two parts:    SUBJECT               PREDICATE     _Galba_               _is a farmer_       «Galba»     _The sailor_          _fights_       «Nauta»               «pugnat»    2. The subject is that person, place, or thing about which something   is said, and is therefore a _noun_ or some word which can serve the   same purpose.      _a._ Pronouns, as their name implies (_pro_, “instead of,” and     _noun_), often take the place of nouns, usually to save repeating     the same noun, as, _Galba is a farmer; «he» is a sturdy fellow_.    3. The predicate is that which is said about the subject, and consists   of a verb with or without modifiers.      _a._ A verb is a word which asserts something (usually an act)     concerning a person, place, or thing.  «20.» «The Object.» In the two sentences, _The boy hit the ball_ and _The ball hit the boy_, the same words are used, but the meaning is different, and depends upon the order of the words. The «doer» of the act, that about which something is said, is, as we have seen above, the «subject». «That to which something is done» is the «direct object» of the verb. _The boy hit the ball_ is therefore analyzed as follows:      SUBJECT        PREDICATE                  /-----------\\     _The boy_    _hit the ball_                (verb)  (direct object)      _a._ A verb whose action passes over to the object directly, as in     the sentence above, is called a «transitive verb». A verb which does     not admit of a direct object is called «intransitive», as, _I walk_,     _he comes_.  «21.» «The Copula.» The verb _to be_ in its different forms--_are_, _is_, _was_, etc.--does not tell us anything about the subject; neither does it govern an object. It simply connects the subject with the word or words in the predicate that possess a distinct meaning. Hence it is called the «copula», that is, _the joiner_ or _link_.  «22.» In the following sentences pronounce the Latin and name the _nouns, verbs, subjects, objects, predicates, copulas_:    1. «America est patria mea»      _America is fatherland my_    2. «Agricola fīliam amat»      _(The) farmer (his) daughter loves_    3. «Fīlia est Iūlia»      _(His) daughter is Julia_    4. «Iūlia et agricola sunt in īnsulā»      _Julia and (the) farmer are on (the) island_    5. «Iūlia aquam portat»      _Julia water carries_    6. «Rosam in comīs habet»      _(A) rose in (her) hair (she) has_    7. «Iūlia est puella pulchra»      _Julia is (a) girl pretty_    8. «Domina fīliam pulchram habet»      _(The) lady (a) daughter beautiful has_      _a._ The sentences above show that Latin does not express some words     which are necessary in English. First of all, _Latin has no article     «the» or «a»_; thus _«agricola»_ may mean _the farmer, a farmer_,     or simply _farmer_. Then, too, the personal pronouns, _I, you, he,     she_, etc., and the possessive pronouns, _my, your, his, her_, etc.,     are not expressed if the meaning of the sentence is clear without     them.   LESSON II  FIRST PRINCIPLES (_Continued_)  «23.» «Inflection.» Words may change their forms to indicate some change in sense or use, as, _is, are_; _was, were; who, whose, whom; farmer, farmer’s; woman, women_. This is called «inflection». The inflection of a noun, adjective, or pronoun is called its «declension», that of a verb its «conjugation».  «24.» «Number.» Latin, like English, has two numbers, singular and plural. In English we "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18251"],["title","Latin for Beginners (#4)"],["body","form the plural by adding _-s_ or _-es_ to the singular. So Latin changes the singular to the plural by changing the ending of the word. Compare    «Naut-a pugnat»     _The sailor fights_   «Naut-ae pugnant»     _The sailors fight_  «25.» RULE. _Nouns that end in «-a» in the singular end in «-ae» in the plural_.  «26.» Learn the following nouns so that you can give the English for the Latin or the Latin for the English. Write the plural of each.    «agri´cola», _farmer_ (agriculture)[1]   «aqua», _water_ (aquarium)   «causa», _cause, reason_   «do´mina», _lady of the house, mistress_ (dominate)   «filia», _daughter_ (filial)   «fortū´na», _fortune_   «fuga», _flight_ (fugitive)   «iniū´ria», _wrong, injury_   «lūna», _moon_ (lunar)   «nauta», _sailor_ (nautical)   «puel´la», _girl_   «silva», forest (silvan)   «terra», _land_ (terrace)      [Footnote 1: The words in parentheses are English words related to     the Latin. When the words are practically identical, as «causa»,     _cause_, no comparison is needed.]  «27.» Compare again the sentences    «Nauta pugna-t»     _The sailor fights_   «Nautae pugna-nt»     _The sailors fight_  In the first sentence the verb «pugna-t» is in the third person singular, in the second sentence «pugna-nt» is in the third person plural.  «28.» RULE. «Agreement of Verb.» _A finite verb must always be in the same person and number as its subject._  «29.» RULE. _In the conjugation of the Latin verb the third person singular active ends in «-t», the third person plural in «-nt». The endings which show the person and number of the verb are called «personal endings»._  «30.» Learn the following verbs and write the plural of each. The personal pronouns _he_, _she_, _it_, etc., which are necessary in the inflection of the English verb, are not needed in the Latin, because the personal endings take their place. Of course, if the verb’s subject is expressed we do not translate the personal ending by a pronoun; thus «nauta pugnat» is translated _the sailor fights_, not _the sailor he fights_.    «ama-t» _he (she, it) loves, is loving, does love_ (amity, amiable)   «labō´ra-t» “ “ “ _labors, is laboring, does labor_   «nūntia-t»[2] “ “ “ _announces, is announcing, does announce_   «porta-t» “ “ “ _carries, is carrying, does carry_ (porter)   «pugna-t» “ “ “ _fights, is fighting, does fight_ (pugnacious)      [Footnote 2: The _u_ in «nūntiō» is long by exception.     (Cf. §12.2.)]  «31.» EXERCISES  I. 1. The daughter loves, the daughters love. 2. The sailor is carrying, the sailors carry. 3. The farmer does labor, the farmers labor. 4. The girl is announcing, the girls do announce. 5. The ladies are carrying, the lady carries.  II. 1. Nauta pugnat, nautae pugnant. 2. Puella amat, puellae amant. 3. Agricola portat, agricolae portant. 4. Fīlia labōrat, fīliae labōrant. 5. Nauta nūntiat, nautae nūntiant. 6. Dominae amant, domina amat.    [Illustration: DOMINA]   LESSON III  FIRST PRINCIPLES (_Continued_)  «32.» «Declension of Nouns.» We learned above (§§19, 20) the difference between the subject and object, and that in English they may be distinguished by the order of the words. Sometimes, however, the order is such that we are left in doubt. For example, the sentence _The lady her daughter loves_ might mean either that the lady loves her daughter, or that the daughter loves the lady.    1. If the sentence were in Latin, no doubt could arise, because the   subject and the object are distinguished, not by the order of the   words, but by the endings of the words themselves. Compare the   following sentences:    «Domina fīliam amat»   «Fīliam domina amat»   «Amat fīliam domina»   «Domina amat fīliam»     _The lady loves her daughter_    «Fīlia dominam amat»   «Dominam fīlia amat»   «Amat dominam fīlia»   «Fīlia amat dominam»     _The daughter loves the lady_      _a._ Observe that in each case the subject of the sentence ends in     «-a» and the object in «-am». The _form_ of the noun shows how it is     used in the sentence, and the order of the words has no effect on     the essential meaning.    2. As stated above (§23), this change of ending is called   «declension», and each different ending produces what is called a   «case». When we decline a noun, we give all its different cases, or   changes of endings. In English we have three cases,--nominative,   possessive, and objective; but, in nouns, the nominative and objective   have the same form, and only the possessive case shows a change of   ending, by adding _’s_ or the apostrophe. The interrogative pronoun,   however, has the fuller declension, _who?_ _whose?_ _whom?_  «33.» The following table shows a comparison between English and Latin declension forms, and should be thoroughly memorized:            ENGLISH CASES                         LATIN CASES   +---+-------------+--------------+------------------+----------------+   |   | Declension  | Name of case | Declension of    | Name of case   |   |   | of _who?_   | and use      | «domina»         |   and use      |   |   |             |              | and translation  |                |   +---+-------------+--------------+------------------+----------------+   |   | Who?        | Nominative-- | «do´min-a»       | Nominative--   |   | S |             |  case of the |  _the lady_      |  case of the   |   | I |             |  subject     |                  |  subject       |   | N |             |              |                  |                |   | G | Whose?      | Possessive-- | «domin-ae»       | Genitive--     |   | U |             |  case of the |  _the lady’s_    |  case of the   |   | L |             |  possessor   |  _of the lady_   |  possessor     |   | A |             |              |                  |                |   | R | Whom?       | Objective--  | «domin-am»       | Accusative--   |   |   |             |  case of the |  _the lady_      |  case of the   |   |   |             |  object      |                  |  direct object |   +---+-------------+--------------+------------------+----------------+   |   | Who?        | Nominative-- | «domin-ae»       | Nominative--   |   |   |             |  case of the | _the ladies_     |  case of the   |   | P |             |  subject     |                  |  subject       |   | L |             |              |                  |                |   | U | Whose?      | Possessive-- | «domin-ā´rum»    | Genitive--     |   | R |             |  case of the |  _the ladies’_   | case of the    |   | A |             |  possessor   |  _of the ladies_ | possessor      |   | L |             |              |                  |                |   |   | Whom?       | Objective--  | «domin-ās»       | Accusative--   |   |   |             |  case of the |  _the ladies_    |  case of the   |   |   |             |  object      |                  |  direct object |   +---+-------------+--------------+------------------+----------------+  When the nominative singular of a noun ends in «-a», observe that      _a._ The nominative plural ends in «-ae».      _b._ The genitive singular ends in «-ae» and the genitive plural in     «-ārum».      _c._ The accusative singular ends in «-am» and the accusative plural     in «-ās».      _d._ The genitive singular and the nominative plural have the same     ending.  «34.» EXERCISE  Pronounce the following words and give their general meaning.
