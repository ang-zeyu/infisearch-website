You may hear how these deft and cunning masters of the wood and the water circumvented the well laid plans of evil men and co√∂perated with their brother scouts in a good scout stunt, which brought fame to the quiet camp community in its secluded hills.  For one, as you shall see, is the bulliest tracker that ever picked his way down out of a tangled wilderness and through field and over hill straight to his goal.  And the other is a famous gatherer of clews, losing sight of no significant trifle, as the scout saying is, and a star scout into the bargain, if we are to believe Pee-wee Harris. I am not so sure that the ten merit badges of bugling, craftsmanship, architecture, aviation, carpentry, camping, forestry, music, pioneering and signaling should be awarded this sprightly scout (for Pee-wee is as liberal with awards as he is with gum-drops). But there can be no question as to the propriety of the music and architecture awards, and I think that the aviation award would be quite appropriate also.  Yet if you should ask old Uncle Jeb Rushmore, beloved manager of the big scout camp, about these two scout heroes, a shrewd twinkle would appear in his eye and he would refer you to the boys, who would probably only laugh at you, for they are a bantering set at Temple Camp and would jolly the life out of Daniel Boone himself if that redoubtable woodsman were there.  Listen then while I tell you of how Tom Slade, friend and brother of these two scouts, as he is of all scouts, assisted them, and of how they assisted him; and of how, out of these reciprocal good turns, there came true peace and happiness, which is the aim and end of all scouting.     CHAPTER II  ANOTHER SCOUT   It was characteristic of Tom Slade that he liked to go off alone occasionally for a ramble in the woods. It was not that he liked the scouts less, but rather that he liked the woods more. It was his wont to stroll off when his camp duties for the day were over and poke around in the adjacent woods.  The scouts knew and respected his peculiarities and preferences, particularly those who were regular summer visitors at the big camp, and few ever followed him into his chosen haunts. Occasionally some new scout, tempted by the pervading reputation and unique negligee of Uncle Jeb's young assistant, ventured to follow him and avail himself of the tips and woods lore with which the more experienced scout's conversation abounded when he was in a talking mood. But Tom was a sort of creature apart and the boys of camp, good scouts that they were, did not intrude upon his lonely rambles.  The season was well nigh over at Temple Camp when this thing happened. Not over exactly, but the period of arrivals had passed and the period of departures would begin in a day or two--as soon as the events with which the season culminated were over.  These were the water events, the tenderfoot carnival (not to be missed on any account) and the big affair at the main pavilion when awards were to be made. This last, in particular, would be a gala demonstration, for Mr. John Temple himself, founder of the big scout camp, had promised to be on hand to dedicate the new tract of camp property and personally to distribute the awards.  These events would break the backbone of the camping season, high schools and grammar schools would presently beckon their reluctant conscripts back to town and city, until, in the pungent chill of autumn, old Uncle Jeb, alone among the boarded-up cabins, would smoke his pipe in solitude and get ready for the long winter.  It was late on Thursday afternoon. The last stroke of the last hammer, where scouts had been erecting a rustic platform outside the pavilion, had echoed from the neighboring hills. The usually still water of the lake was rippled by the refreshing breeze which heralded a cooler evening, and the first rays of dying sunlight painted the ripples golden, and bathed the cone-like tops of the fir trees across the lake with a crimson glow.  Out of the chimney of the cooking shack arose the smoke of early promise, from which the scouts deduced various conclusions as to the probable character of the meal which would appear in all its luscious glory a couple of hours later.  A group of scouts, weary of diving, were strung along the springboard which overhung the shore. A couple of boys played mumbly-peg under the bulletin board tree. Several were playing ball with an apple, until one of them began eating it, which put an end to the game. Half a dozen of the older boys, who had been at work erecting the platform, sauntered toward the scrub shack, leaving one or two to festoon the bunting over the stand where the colors shone as if they had been varnished by that master decorator, the sun, as a last finishing touch to his sweltering day's work. The emblem patrol sauntered over to the flag pole and sprawled beneath it to rest and await the moment of sunset. Several canoes moved aimlessly upon the glinting water, their occupants idling with the paddles. It was the time of waiting, the empty hour or two between the day's end and supper-time.  Upon a rock near the lake sat a little fellow, quite alone. He was very small and very thin, and his belt was drawn ridiculously tight, so that it gave his khaki jacket the effect of being shirred like the top of a cloth bag. If he had been standing, he might have suggested, not a little, the shape of an old-fashioned hour glass. A brass compass dangled around his neck on a piece of twine as if, being so small, he was in danger of getting lost any minute. His hair was black and very streaky, and his eyes had a strange brightness in them.  No one paid any attention to this little gnome of a boy, and he was a pathetic sight sitting there with his intense gaze, having just a touch of wildness in it, fixed upon the lake. Doubtless if his scout regalia had fitted him properly he would not have seemed so pathetic, for it is not uncommon for a scout to want to be alone in the great companionable wilderness.  Suddenly, this little fellow's gaze was withdrawn from the lake and fell upon something which seemed to interest him right at his feet. He slid down from the rock and examined it closely. His poor little thin figure and skinny legs were very noticeable then. But he picked up nothing, only kneeled there, apparently in a state of great excitement and elation.  Presently, he started away, looked back, as if he was afraid his discovery would take advantage of his absence to steal away. Again he started, hurrying around the edge of the cooking shack and to the little avenue of patrol cabins beyond. As he hurried along, the big brass compass flopped about and sometimes banged against his belt buckle, making quite a noise. Several boys laughed as he passed them, trotting along as if possessed by a vision. But no one stopped him or spoke to him.  In the patrol cabin where he belonged, he rooted in great haste and excitement among the contents of a cheap pasteboard suit case and presently"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18180"],["title","Tom Slade on Mystery Trail (#1)"],["body","out a torn and battered old copy of the scout handbook. He sat down on the edge of his cot and, hurriedly looking through the index, opened the book at page thirty. He was breathing so hard that he almost gulped, and his thin little hands trembled visibly....     CHAPTER III  THE \"ALL BUT\" SCOUT   In that same hour, perhaps a little earlier or later, I cannot say, Tom Slade, having finished his duties for the day, strolled along the lake shore away from camp and struck into the woods which extended northward as far as the Dansville road.  He had no notion of where he was going; he was going nowhere in particular. For aught I know he was going to ponder on the responsibility which had been thrust upon him by the scout powers that be, of judging stalking photographs preliminary to awarding the Audubon prize offered by the historical society in his home town. Perhaps he was under the influence of a little pensive regret that the season was coming to an end and wished to have this lonely parting with his beloved hills and trees. It is of no consequence. About all he actually did was to kick a stick along before him and pause now and again to examine the caked green moss on trees.  When he had reached a little eminence whence the view behind him was unobstructed, he turned and looked down upon the camp. Perhaps in that brief glimpse the whole panorama of his adventurous life spread before him in his mind's eye, and he saw the vicious little hoodlum that he had once been transformed into a scout, pass through the several ranks of scouting, grow up, go to war, and come back to be assistant at the camp where he had spent so many happy hours when he was a young boy.  And now there was not one thing down there, nor shack nor cabin nor shooting range nor boat nor canoe, nor hero's elm (as they called it), nor Gold Cross Rock, which had the same romantic interest as had this young fellow to the scouts who came in droves and watched him and listened to the talk about him and dreamed of being just such a real scout as he. He moved about unconsciously among them, simple, childlike, stolid, but with a kind of assurance and serenity which he may have learned from the woods.  He was singularly oblivious to the superficial appurtenances of scouting. He had passed through that stage. The pomp and vanity of the tenderfoot he knew not. The bespangled dignity of the second-class and first-class scout, these things he had known and outgrown. His medals were home somewhere. And out of all this alluring rigmarole and romantic glory were left the deeper marks of scout training, burned into his soul as the mark is burned into the skin of a broncho. The woods, the trees, were his. That, after all, is the highest award in scouting. It is a medal that one does not lose, and it lasts forever.  As Tom Slade stood there looking down upon the camp, one might have seen in him the last and fullest accomplishment of scouting, stripped of all else. His face was the color of a mulatto. He wore no scout hat, he wore no hat at all. It would have been quite superfluous for him to have worn any of his thirty or forty merit badges of fond memory on his sleeves, for his sleeves were rolled up to his shoulders. He wore a pongee shirt, this being a sort of compromise between a shirt and nothing at all. He wore moccasins, but not Indian moccasins. He was still partial to khaki trousers, and these were worn with a strange contraption for a belt; it was a kind of braided fiber of his own manufacture, the material of which was said to have been taken from a string tree.  As he resumed his way through the woods he presently heard a cheery, but rather exhausted, voice behind him.  \"Have a heart, Slady, and wait a minute, will you?\" Tom's pursuer called. \"I'm nearly dead climbing up through all this jungle after you. Old Mother Nature's got herself into a fine mess of a tangle through here, hey? Don't mind if I come along with you, do you? Look down there, hey? Pavilion looks nice. I've been wondering if I stand any chance of being called up on that platform on Saturday night. Looks swell with all the bunting over it, doesn't it?\"  The speaker, who had been half talking and half shouting, now came stumbling and panting up over the edge of the wooded decline where the thick brush had played havoc with his scout suit but not with his temper.  \"Some climb, hey?\" he breathed, laughing, and affecting the stagger of utter exhaustion. \"I bet you knew an easier way up. The bunch told me not to beard the lion in his den, but I'm not afraid of lions. Here I am and you can't get rid of me now. I'm up against it, Slady, and I want a few tips. They say you're the only real scout since Kit Carson. What I'm hunting for is a wild animal, but I haven't been able to find anything except a cricket, two beetles and a cow that belongs on the Hasbrook farm. Don't mind if I stroll along with you a little way, do you? My name is Willetts--Hervey Willetts. I'm with that troop from Massachusetts. I'm an Eagle Scout--_all but_.\"  \"But's a pretty big word,\" Tom said.  \"You said it,\" Hervey Willetts said, still wrestling with his breath; \"it's the biggest word in the dictionary.\"     CHAPTER IV  HERVEY LEARNS SOMETHING   They strolled on through the woods together, the younger boy's gayety and enthusiasm showing in pleasing contrast to Tom's stolid manner.  He was a wholesome, vivacious boy, this Willetts, with a breeziness which seemed to captivate even his sober companion, and if Tom had felt any slight annoyance at being thus overhauled by a comparative stranger, the feeling quickly passed in the young scout's cheery company.  \"They told me down in camp that if I need a guide, philosopher, and friend, I'd better run you down, or up----\"  \"If you'd gone a little to the left you'd have found it easier,\" Tom said, in his usual matter-of-fact manner.  \"Oh, I suppose you know all the highways and byways and right ways and left ways and every which ways for miles and miles around,\" Hervey Willetts said. \"I guess they were right when they said you'd be a good guide, philosopher, and friend, hey?\"  \"I don't know what a philosopher is,\" Tom said, with characteristic blunt honesty, \"but I know all the trails around here, if that's what you're talking about.\"  \"Oh, you mean about guides?\" Hervey asked, just a trifle puzzled. \"That's an expression, _guide, philosopher, and friend_. It comes from Shakespeare or one of those old ginks; it means a kind of a moral guide, I suppose.\"  \"Oh,\" said Tom.  \"But I need, I need, I need, I need a friend,\" Hervey said.  \"You seem to have lots of friends down there,\" Tom said.  \"A scout is observant, hey?\" Willetts laughed.  \"I mean you always seem to have a lot of fellows with you,\" Tom said, ignoring the compliment. \"Everybody likes your troop, that's sure. And your troop seems to be stuck on _you_.\"  \"_Good night!_\" Hervey laughed. \"They won't be stuck on me after Saturday. That'll be the end of my glorious career.\"  \"What did you do?\" Tom asked, after his customary fashion of construing talk literally.  \"Oh, I didn't exactly commit a murder,\" the other laughed, \"but I fell down, Sla--you don't mind my calling you Slady, do you?\"  \"That's what most everybody calls me,\" Tom said, \"except the troop I was in. They call me Tomasso.\"  \"Sounds like tomato, hey?\" Hervey laughed. \"No, my troubles are about merit badges. I've bungled the whole thing up. When a fellow goes after the Eagle award, he ought to have a manager, that's what I say. He ought to have a manager to plan things out for him. I tried to manage my own campaign and now I'm stuck--with a capital S.\"  \"How many merits have you got?\" Tom asked him.  \"Twenty,\" Hervey said, \"twenty and two-thirds. Just a fraction more and I'd have gone over the top.\"  \"You mean a sub-division?\" Tom asked.  \"That's where the little _but_ comes in,\" Hervey said. \"B-u-t, but. It's a big word, all right, just as you said.\"  \"Is it architecture or cooking or interpreting or one of those?\" Tom asked.  Hervey glanced at Tom in frank surprise.  \"Maybe it's leather work, or machinery, or taxidermy or marksmanship,\" Tom continued, with no thought further from his mind than that of showing off.  \"Guess again,\" Hervey laughed.  \"Then it must be either music or stalking,\" Tom said, dully.  His companion paused in his steps, contemplating Tom with unconcealed amazement. \"Right-o,\" he said; \"it's stalking. What are you? A mind reader?\"  \"Those are the only ones that have three tests,\" Tom said. \"So if you have twenty merits and two-thirds of a merit, why, you must be trying for one of those. Maybe they've changed it since I looked at the handbook.\"  Hervey Willetts stood just where he had stopped, looking at Tom with admiration. In his astonishment he glanced at Tom's arm as if he expected to see upon it the tangible evidences of his companion's feats and accomplishments. But the only signs of scouting which he saw there were the brown skin and the firm muscles.  \"They change that book every now and then,\" Tom said.  Still Hervey continued to look. \"What's that belt made out of?\" he asked.  \"It's fiber from a string tree,\" Tom said; \"they grow in Lorraine in France.\"  \"Were you in France?\"  \"Two years,\" Tom said.  \"How many merit badges have you got, anyway, Mr.--Slady?\"  \"Oh, I don't know,\" Tom said; \"about thirty or thirty-five, I guess.\"  \"You _guess?_ I bet you've got the Gold Cross. Where is it?\" Hervey made a quick inspection of Tom's pongee shirt, but all he saw there was the front with buttons gone and the brown chest showing.  \"I couldn't pin it on there very well, could I?\" Tom said, lured by his companion's eagerness into a little show of amusement.  \"Where is it?\" Hervey demanded.  \"I'm letting a girl wear it,\" Tom said.  \"Oh, what I know about _you!_\" Hervey said, teasingly. \"You can bet if I ever get the Gold Cross or the Eagle Badge (which I won't this trip) no girl will ever wear them.\"  \"You can't be so sure about that,\" "]]]
