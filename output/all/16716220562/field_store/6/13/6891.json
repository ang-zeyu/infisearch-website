His music was written originally to Latin words, but when, after the Reformation, the use of vernacular hymns, was introduced he probably adapted his scores to either language.  It is inferred that he was in attendance on Queen Elizabeth at her palace in Greenwich when he died, for he was buried in the old parish church there in November, 1585. The rustic rhymer who indited his epitaph evidently did the best he could to embalm the virtues of the great musician as a man, a citizen, and a husband:      Enterred here doth ly a worthy wyght,       Who for long time in musick bore the bell:     His name to shew was Thomas Tallis hyght;       In honest vertuous lyff he dyd excell.      He served long tyme in chappel with grete prayse,       Fower sovereygnes reignes, (a thing not often seene);     I mean King Henry and Prince Edward's dayes,       Quene Marie, and Elizabeth our quene.      He maryed was, though children he had none,       And lyv'd in love full three and thirty yeres     With loyal spowse, whose name yclept was Jone,       Who, here entombed, him company now bears.      As he dyd lyve, so also dyd he dy,       In myld and quyet sort, O happy man!     To God ful oft for mercy did he cry;       Wherefore he lyves, let Deth do what he can.   \"THE GOD OF ABRAHAM PRAISE.\"  This is one of the thanksgivings of the ages.      The God of Abraham praise,       Who reigns enthroned above;     Ancient of everlasting days,       And God of love.     Jehovah, Great I AM!       By earth and heaven confessed,     I bow and bless the sacred Name,       Forever blest.  The hymn, of twelve eight-line stanzas, is too long to quote entire, but is found in both the _Plymouth_ and _Methodist Hymnals_.  Thomas Olivers, born in Tregynon, near Newtown, Montgomeryshire, Wales, 1725, was, according to local testimony, \"the worst boy known in all that country, for thirty years.\" It is more charitable to say that he was a poor fellow who had no friends. Left an orphan at five years of age, he was passed from one relative to another until all were tired of him, and he was \"bound out\" to a shoemaker. Almost inevitably the neglected lad grew up wicked, for no one appeared to care for his habits and morals, and as he sank lower in the various vices encouraged by bad company, there were more kicks for him than helping hands. At the age of eighteen his reputation in the town had become so unsavory that he was forced to shift for himself elsewhere.  Providence led him, when shabby and penniless, to the old seaport town of Bristol, where Whitefield was at that time preaching,[4] and there the young sinner heard the divine message that lifted him to his feet.  [Footnote 4: Whitefield's text was, \"Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?\" Zach. 3:2.]  \"When that sermon began,\" he said, \"I was one of the most abandoned and profligate young men living; before it ended I was a new creature. The world was all changed for Tom Olivers.\"  His new life, thus begun, lasted on earth more than sixty useful years. He left a shining record as a preacher of righteousness, and died in the triumphs of faith, November, 1799. Before he passed away he saw at least thirty editions of his hymn published, but the soul-music it has awakened among the spiritual children of Abraham can only reach him in heaven. Some of its words have been the last earthly song of many, as they were of the eminent Methodist theologian, Richard Watson--        I shall behold His face,       I shall His power adore,     And sing the wonders of His grace         Forevermore.   _THE TUNE._  The precise date of the tune \"Leoni\" is unknown, as also the precise date of the hymn. The story is that Olivers visited the great \"Duke's Place\" Synagogue, Aldgate, London, and heard Meyer Lyon (Leoni) sing the Yigdal or long doxology to an air so noble and impressive that it haunted him till he learned it and fitted to it the sublime stanzas of his song. Lyon, a noted Jewish musician and vocalist, was chorister of this London Synagogue during the latter part of the 18th century and the Yigdal was a portion of the Hebrew Liturgy composed in medieval times, it is said, by Daniel Ben Judah. The fact that the Methodist leaders took Olivers from his bench to be one of their preachers answers any suggestion that the converted shoemaker _copied_ the Jewish hymn and put Christian phrases in it. He knew nothing of Hebrew, and had he known it, a literal translation of the Yigdal will show hardly a similarity to his evangelical lines. Only the music as Leoni sang it prompted his own song, and he gratefully put the singer's name to it. Montgomery, who admired the majestic style of the hymn, and its glorious imagery, said of its author, \"The man who wrote that hymn must have had the finest ear imaginable, for on account of the peculiar measure, none but a person of equal musical and poetic taste could have produced the harmony perceptible in the verse.\"  Whether the hymnist or some one else fitted the hymn to the tune, the \"fine ear\" and \"poetic taste\" that Montgomery applauded are evident enough in the union.   \"O WORSHIP THE KING ALL GLORIOUS ABOVE.\"  This hymn of Sir Robert Grant has become almost universally known, and is often used as a morning or opening service song by choirs and congregations of all creeds. The favorite stanzas are the first four--      O worship the King all-glorious above,     And gratefully sing His wonderful love--     Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days,     Pavilioned in splendor, and girded with praise.      O tell of His might, and sing of His grace,     Whose robe is the light, whose canopy, space;     His chariots of wrath the deep thunder-clouds form,     And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.      Thy bountiful care what tongue can recite?     It breathes in the air, it shines in the light,     It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain,     And sweetly distils in the dew and the rain.      Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail,     In Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail.     Thy mercies how tender! how firm to the end!     Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!  This is a model hymn of worship. Like the previous one by Thomas Olivers, it is strongly Hebrew in its tone and diction, and drew its inspiration from the Old Testament Psalter, the text-book of all true praise-song.  Sir Robert Grant was born in the county of Inverness, Scotland, in 1785, and educated at Cambridge. He was many years member of Parliament for Inverness and a director in the East India Company, and 1834 was appointed Governor of Bombay. He died at Dapoorie, Western India, July 9, 1838.  Sir Robert was a man of deep Christian feeling and a poetic mind. His writings were not numerous, but their thoughtful beauty endeared him to a wide circle of readers. In 1839 his brother, Lord Glenelg, published twelve of his poetical pieces, and a new edition in 1868. The volume contains the more or less well-known hymns--      The starry firmament on high.      Saviour, when in dust to Thee,  and--      When gathering clouds around I view.  Sir Robert's death, when scarcely past his prime, would indicate a decline by reason of illness, and perhaps other serious affliction, that justified the poetic license in the submissive verses beginning--      Thy mercy heard my infant prayer.         *       *       *       *       *      And now _in age_ and grief Thy name     Does still my languid heart inflame,       And bow my faltering knee.     Oh, yet this bosom feels the fire,     This trembling hand and drooping lyre       Have yet a strain for Thee.   _THE TUNE._  Several musical pieces written to the hymn, \"O, Worship the King,\" have appeared in church psalm-books, and others have been borrowed for it, but the one oftenest sung to its words is Haydn's \"Lyons.\" Its vigor and spirit best fit it for Grant's noble lyric.   \"MAJESTIC SWEETNESS SITS ENTHRONED.\"  Rev. Samuel Stennett D.D., the author of this hymn, was the son of Rev. Joseph Stennett, and grandson of Rev. Joseph Stennett D.D., who wrote--      Another six days' work is done,     Another Sabbath is begun.  All were Baptist ministers. Samuel was born in 1727, at Exeter, Eng., and at the age of twenty-one became his father's assistant, and subsequently his successor over the church in Little Wild Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London.      Majestic sweetness sits enthroned       Upon the Saviour's brow;     His head with radiant glories crowned,       His lips with grace o'erflow.         *       *       *       *       *      To Him I owe my life and breath       And all the joys I have;     He makes me triumph over death,       He saves me from the grave.         *       *       *       *       *      Since from His bounty I receive       Such proofs of love divine,     Had I a thousand hearts to give,       Lord, they should all be Thine.  Samuel Stennett was one of the most respected and influential ministers of the Dissenting persuasion, and a confidant of many of the most distinguished statesmen of his time. The celebrated John Howard was his parishoner and intimate friend. His degree of Doctor of Divinity was bestowed upon him by Aberdeen University. Besides his theological writings he composed and published thirty-eight hymns, among them--      On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,      When two or three with sweet accord,      Here at Thy table, Lord, we meet,  and--      \"'Tis finished,\" so the Saviour cried.  \"Majestic Sweetness\" began the third stanza of his longer hymn--      To Christ the Lord let every tongue.  Dr. Stennett died in London, Aug. 24, 1795.   _THE TUNE._  For fifty or sixty years \"Ortonville\" has been linked with this devout hymn, and still maintains its fitting fellowship. The tune, composed in 1830, was the work of Thomas Hastings, and is almost as well-known and as often sung as his immortal \"Toplady.\" (See chap. 3, \"Rock of Ages.\")   \"ALL HAIL THE POWER OF JESUS'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18444"],["title","The Story of the Hymns and Tunes (#5)"],["body"," NAME.\"  This inspiring lyric of praise appears to have been written about the middle of the eighteenth century. Its author, the Rev. Edward Perronet, son of Rev. Vincent Perronet, Vicar of Shoreham, Eng., was a man of great faith and humility but zealous in his convictions, sometimes to his serious expense. He was born in 1721, and, though eighteen years younger than Charles Wesley, the two became bosom friends, and it was under the direction of the Wesleys that Perronet became a preacher in the evangelical movement. Lady Huntingdon later became his patroness, but some needless and imprudent expressions in a satirical poem, \"The Mitre,\" revealing his hostility to the union of church and state, cost him her favor, and his contention against John Wesley's law that none but the regular parish ministers had the right to administer the sacraments, led to his complete separation from both the Wesleys. He subsequently became the pastor of a small church of Dissenters in Canterbury, where he died, in January, 1792. His piety uttered itself when near his happy death, and his last words were a Gloria.      All hail the power of Jesus' name!       Let angels prostrate fall;     Bring forth the royal diadem,       To crown Him Lord of all.      Ye seed of Israel's chosen race,       Ye ransomed of the fall,     Hail Him Who saves you by His grace,       And crown Him Lord of all.      Sinners, whose love can ne'er forget       The wormwood and the gall,     Go, spread your trophies at His feet,       And crown Him Lord of all.      Let every tribe and every tongue       That bound creation's call,     Now shout the universal song,       The crownéd Lord of all.  With two disused stanzas omitted, the hymn as it stands differs from the original chiefly in the last stanza, though in the second the initial line is now transposed to read--      Ye chosen seed of Israel's race.  The fourth stanza now reads--      Let every kindred, every tribe       On this terrestrial ball     To Him all majesty ascribe,       And crown Him Lord of all.  And what is now the favorite last stanza is the one added by Dr. Rippon--      O that with yonder sacred throng       We at His feet may fall,     And join the everlasting song,       And crown Him Lord of all.   _THE TUNE._  Everyone now calls it \"Old Coronation,\" and it is entitled to the adjective by this time, being considerably more than a hundred years of age. It was composed in the very year of Perronet's death and one wonders just how long the hymn and tune waited before they came together; for Heaven evidently meant them to be wedded for all time. This is an American opinion, and no reflection on the earlier English melody of \"Miles Lane,\" composed during Perronet's lifetime by William Shrubsole and published with the words in 1780 in the _Gospel Magazine_. There is also a fine processional tune sung in the English Church to Perronet's hymn.  The author of \"Coronation\" was Oliver Holden, a self-taught musician, born in Shirley, Mass., 1765, and bred to the carpenter's trade. The little pipe organ on which tradition says he struck the first notes of the famous tune is now in the Historical rooms of the Old State House, Boston, placed there by its late owner, Mrs. Fanny Tyler, the old musician's granddaughter. Its tones are as mellow as ever, and the times that \"Coronation\" has been played upon it by admiring visitors would far outnumber the notes of its score.  Holden wrote a number of other hymn-tunes, among which \"Cowper,\" \"Confidence,\" and \"Concord\" are remembered, but none of them had the wings of \"Coronation,\" his American \"Te Deum.\" His first published collection was entitled _The American Harmony_, and this was followed by the _Union Harmony_, and the _Worcester Collection_. He also wrote and published \"Mt. Vernon,\" and several other patriotic anthems, mainly for special occasions, to some of which he supplied the words. He was no hymnist, though he did now and then venture into sacred metre. The new _Methodist Hymnal_ preserves a simple four-stanza specimen of his experiments in verse:      They who seek the throne of grace     Find that throne in every place:     If we lead a life of prayer     God is present everywhere.  Sacred music, however, was the good man's passion to the last. He died in 1844.  \"Such beautiful themes!\" he whispered on his death bed, \"Such beautiful themes! But I can write no more.\"  The enthusiasm always and everywhere aroused by the singing of \"Coronation,\" dates from the time it first went abroad in America in its new wedlock of music and words. \"This tune,\" says an accompanying note over the score in the old _Carmina Sacra_, \"was a great favorite with the late Dr. Dwight of Yale College (1798). It was often sung by the college choir, while he, catching, as it were, the music of the heavenly world, would join them, and lead with the most ardent devotion.\"   \"AWAKE AND SING THE SONG.\"  This hymn of six stanzas is abridged from a longer one indited by the Rev. William Hammond, and published in _Lady Huntingdon's Hymn-book_. It was much in use in early Methodist revivals. It appears now as it was slightly altered by Rev. Martin Madan--      Awake and sing the song       Of Moses and the Lamb;     Join every heart and every tongue       To praise the Savior's name.         *       *       *       *       *  The sixth verse is a variation of one of Watts' hymns, and was added in the _Brethren's Hymn-book_, 1801--      There shall each heart and tongue       His endless praise proclaim,     And sweeter voices join the song       Of Moses and the Lamb.  The Rev. William Hammond was born Jan. 6, 1719, at Battle, Sussex, Eng., and educated at St. John's College, Cambridge. Early in his ministerial life he was a Calvinistic Methodist, but ultimately joined the Moravians. Died in London, Aug. 19, 1793. His collection of _Psalms and Hymns and Spiritual Songs_ was published in 1745.  The Rev. Martin Madan, son of Col. Madan, was born 1726. He founded Lock Hospital, Hyde Park, and long officiated as its chaplain. As a preacher he was popular, and his reputation as a composer of music was considerable. There is no proof that he wrote any original hymns, but he amended, pieced and expanded the work of others. Died in 1770.   _THE TUNE._  The hymn has had a variety of musical interpretations. The more modern piece is \"St. Philip,\" by Edward John Hopkins, Doctor of Music, born at Westminster, London, June 30, 1818. From a member of the Chapel Royal boy choir he became organist of the Michtam Church, Surrey, and afterwards of the Temple Church, London. Received his Doctor's degree from the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1882.  [Illustration: Joseph Haydn]   \"CROWN HIS HEAD WITH ENDLESS BLESSING.\"  The writer of this hymn was William Goode, who helped to found the English Church Missionary Society, and was for twenty years the Secretary of the \"Society for the Relief of Poor Pious Clergymen.\" For celebrating the praise of the Saviour, he seems to have been of like spirit and genius with Perronet. He was born in Buckingham, Eng., April 2, 1762; studied for the ministry and became a curate, successor of William Romaine. His spiritual maturity was early, and his habits of thought were formed amid associations such as the young Wesleys and Whitefield sought. Like them, even in his student days he proved his aspiration for purer religious life by an evangelical zeal that cost him the ridicule of many of his school-fellows, but the meetings for conference and prayer which he organized among them were not unattended, and were lasting and salutary in their effect.  Jesus was the theme of his life and song, and was his last word. He died in 1816.      Crown His head with endless blessing       Who in God the Father's name     With compassion never ceasing       Comes salvation to proclaim.     Hail, ye saints who know His favor,       Who within His gates are found.     Hail, ye saints, th' exalted Saviour,       Let His courts with praise resound.   _THE TUNE._  \"Haydn,\" bearing the name of its great composer, is in several important hymnals the chosen music for William Goode's devout words. Its strain and spirit are lofty and melodious and in entire accord with the pious poet's praise.  Joseph Haydn, son of a poor wheelwright, was born 1732, in Rohron, a village on the borders of Hungary and Austria. His precocity of musical talent was such that he began composing at the age of ten years. Prince Esterhazy discovered his genius when he was poor and friendless, and his fortune was made. While Music Master for the Prince's Private Chapel (twenty years) he wrote many of his beautiful symphonies which placed him among the foremost in that class of music. Invited to England, he received the Doctor's degree at Oxford, and composed his great oratorio of \"The Creation,\" besides his \"Twelve Grand Symphonies,\" and a long list of minor musical works secular and sacred. His invention was inexhaustible.  Haydn seems to have been a sincerely pious man. When writing his great oratorio of \"The Creation\" at sixty-seven years of age, \"I knelt down every day,\" he says, \"and prayed God to strengthen me for my work.\" This daily spiritual preparation was similar to Handel's when he was creating his \"Messiah.\" Change one word and it may be said of sacred music as truly as of astronomy, \"The undevout composer is mad.\"  Near Haydn's death, in Vienna, 1809, when he heard for the last time his magnificent chorus, \"Let there be Light!\" he exclaimed, \"Not mine, not mine. It all came to me from above.\"   \"NOW TO THE LORD A NOBLE SONG.\"  When Watts finished this hymn he had achieved a \"noble song,\" whether he was conscious of it or not; and it deserves a foremost place, where it can help future worshippers in their praise as it has the past. It is not so common in the later hymnals, but it is imperishable, and still later collections will not forget it.      Now to the Lord a noble song,     Awake my soul,"]]]
