Time went by--some months. Then she did send an address, but she did not write often, and when she did, she said little but that she was happy.  As nearly as I can remember, it was a year and a half after she left that news came that Josephine had a son. By that time a great many of the girls she had known were gone. Changes come fast in such a place. But there was great rejoicing, and those who had known her found time to make something for dear little Josephine's baby, and the sending of the things kept up the interest in her for some months.  Then the letters ceased again.  I can't be sure how long it was after that that I received a letter from her. She told me that her husband was dead, that she never really had taken root in Utica, and now that she was alone, with her baby to support, she longed to come back to Boston, and asked my advice. Did I think she could take up her old work?  I took the letter at once to the Matron of the Friendly Society--I happened to be resting between two cases--and we decided that it was safe. At least between us we could help her make the trial.  A few months later she came, and we went to the station to meet her. I could not see that she had changed a bit. She did not look a day older, and the bouncing baby she carried in her arms was a darling.  Of course she could not go back to the Association. That was not for married women. But we found her a room just across the street, and in no time, she dropped right back into the place she had left. Every morning she took the baby boy to the _crêche_ and every night she took him home, and a better cared-for, better loved, more wisely bred youngster was never born, nor a happier one. Every one loved him just as every one loved Josephine.  There I thought Josephine's story ended, and so far as she was concerned, it did.  But when the baby was six years old, and forward for his age, the Matron of the Friendly Society came into my room one day, when I was there to take a longer rest than usual, after a very trying case, and told me that she was in great distress. A friend of hers, who had been her predecessor, and was now the Matron of an Orphan Asylum in New York State, was going to the hospital to have a cataract removed from her eye, and had written to ask her to come and take her place while she was away. She begged me to replace her at the Friendly Society while she was gone. As her assistant was a capable young woman, and my relations with every one were pleasant I was only too glad to consent. She had always been so good to me.  She was gone a month.  On her return I noticed that she was distressed about something. I taxed her with it. She said it was nothing she felt like talking about. But one evening when Josephine had been sewing for me, after she was gone, the Matron, who had been in my room, got up, and closed the door after her.  \"I've really got to tell you what is on my mind,\" she said. \"And I am sure that you will look on it as a confidence. You know the asylum where I have been is not far from Utica, where Josephine went when she was married. Well, one day, about a fortnight after I got there, I had occasion to look up the record of a child in the books, and my attention was attracted by a name the same as Josephine's. The coincidence struck me, and I read the record that on a certain day, which as near as I could calculate, must have been a year after Josephine left, a person of her name, written down as a widow, a member of the Orthodox Church, had adopted a male child a few months old. I was interested. I did not suspect anything, but I asked the assistant matron if she remembered the case. She did, clearly. She said the woman was a dear little thing, who had come there shortly before, a young widow, a seamstress. She was a lonely little thing, and some one connected with the asylum had given her work, which she had done so well that she soon had all she needed. She had been employed in the asylum, and loved children as they did her. The child in question was the son of a woman who had died at its birth, from the shock of an accident which had killed the father. It took a fancy to Josephine, and she wanted to adopt it. The committee took the matter up. The clergyman spoke well of her, as did every one, and they all decided that she was perfectly able to care for it. So she took the child. All of a sudden, one day, Josephine went, as she had come. There was no mystery about it. She told the clergyman that she was homesick for her old friends, and had gone east, and would write, and she always has.  \"Of course I was puzzled. There was no doubt in my mind that it was our little Josephine. Naturally I was discreet. Luckily. I spoke of her to several people who remembered her, and they all called her 'dear little Josephine' just as we had. I talked of her with the clergyman and his wife. I asked questions that were too natural to rouse suspicions, when I told them that I knew her, that the baby was the dearest and happiest child I knew, and what do you suppose I found out, more by inference than facts?\"  No need to ask me. Didn't I know?  Josephine had never been married. There had never been any \"He.\" It all seemed so natural. It did not shock me, as it had the Matron, and I was glad she had told no one but me. Dear little Josephine! Sitting there in the Association without family, with no friends but her patrons, and those girls whose little romances went on about her! No romances ever came her way. So she had made one all of her own. I proved to the Matron easily that what she had discovered by accident was not her affair, that to keep Josephine's secret was a virtue, and not a sin. I was sure of that, for, as I watched her afterwards, I knew that Josephine had played her part in her dream romance so well, that she no longer remembered that it was not true. She had forgotten she had not really borne the child she carried so lovingly in her arms.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Is that all?\" asked the Journalist.  \"That is all,\" replied the Trained Nurse.  \"By Jove,\" said the Doctor, \"that is a good story. I wish I had told it.\"  \"Thank you, Doctor,\" laughed the Trained Nurse. \"I thought it was a bit in your line.\"  \"But fancy the cleverness of the little thing to do all the details up so nicely,\" said the Lawyer. \"She dovetailed everything so neatly. But what I want to know is whether she planned the baby when she planned the make-believe husband?\"  \"I fancy not,\" replied the Nurse. \"One thing came along after another in her imagination, quite naturally.\"  \"Poor little Josephine--it seems to me hard luck to have had to imagine such an every day fate,\" sighed the Divorcée.  \"Don't pity her,\" snapped the Doctor. \"Poor little Josephine, indeed! Lucky little Josephine, who arranged her own romance, and risked no disillusion. There have been cases where the joys of the imagination have been more dangerous.\"  \"You are sure she had no disillusion?\" asked the Critic.  \"I am,\" said the Nurse.  \"And her name was Josephine?\" asked the Divorcée.  \"It was not, and Utica was not the town,\" replied the Nurse.  \"Perhaps her disillusion is ahead of her,\" said the Journalist. \"'Say no man'--or woman either--'is happy until the day of his death.'\"  \"She _is_ dead,\" said the Nurse.  \"I told you she was lucky little Josephine,\" ejaculated the Doctor.  \"And she died without telling the boy the truth?\" asked the Journalist.  \"The truth?\" repeated the Nurse. \"I've told you that she had forgotten it. No woman was ever so loved by a son. No mother ever so grieved for.\"  \"Then the son lives?\" asked the Doctor.  The Nurse smiled quietly.  \"Good-night,\" said the Doctor. \"I am going to bed to dream of that. It is a pity some of the rest of us childless slackers had not done as well as Josephine. She took her risk. She was lucky.\"  \"She did,\" replied the Nurse, \"but she did not realize anything of that. She was too simple, too unanalytic.\"  \"I wonder?\" said the Critic.  \"You need not, I know.\" Her eyes fell on the Lawyer, and she caught a laugh in his eye. \"What does that mean?\" she asked.  \"Well,\" said the Lawyer, \"I was only thinking. She was religious, that dear little Josephine?\"  \"At least she always went to church.\"  \"I know the type,\" said the Violinist, gently. \"Accepted what she was taught, believed it.\"  \"Exactly,\" said the Lawyer, \"that is what I was getting at. Well then, when her son meets her _au dela_--he will ask for his father--\"  \"Or,\" interrupted the Violinist, \"his own mother will claim him.\"  \"Don't worry,\" laughed the Critic. \"It's dollars to doughnuts that she was 'dear little Josephine' to all the Heavenly Host half an hour after she entered the 'gates of pearl.' Don't look shocked. That is not sacrilegious. It is intentions--motives, that are immortal, not facts. Besides--\"  \"Don't push that idea too far,\" interrupted the Doctor from the door.  \"Don't be alarmed. I was only going to say--there are Ik Marvels _au dela_--\"  \"I knew that idea was in your head. Drop it!\" laughed the Doctor.  \"Anyway,\" said the Violinist, \"if Life is but a dream, she had a pretty one. Good night.\" And he went up to bed, and we all soon followed him, and I imagine not one of us, as we looked out into the moonlit air, thought that night of war.     III  THE CRITIC'S STORY  'TWAS IN THE INDIAN SUMMER  THE TALE OF AN ACTRESS   The next day, just as we were sitting down to dinner, the news came that Namur had fallen. The German army had marched singing into the burning town the afternoon before. The Youngster had his head over a map almost all through dinner. The Belgians were practically pushed out of all but Antwerp, and the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18004"],["title","Told in a French Garden (#6)"],["body","were rapidly approaching the natural defences of France running from Lille to Verdun, through Valenciennes, Mauberge, Hirson and Mezières.  Things were beginning to look serious, although we still insisted on believing that the Germans could not break through. One result of the march of events was that we none of us had any longer the smallest desire to argue. Theories were giving way to the facts of every day, but in our minds, I imagine, we were every one of us asking, \"How long CAN we stay here? How long will it be wise, even if we are permitted?\" But, as if by common consent, no one asked the question, and we were only too glad to sit out in the garden we had all learned to love, and to talk of anything which was not war, until the Critic moved his chair into the middle of the circle, and began his tale.  \"Let me see,\" he remarked. \"I need a property or two,\" and he pulled an envelope out of his pocket and laid it on the table, and, leaning his elbows on it, began:         *       *       *       *       *  It was in the Autumn of '81 that I last saw Dillon act.  She had made a great success that winter, yet, in the middle of the season, she had suddenly disappeared.  There were all kinds of newspaper explanations.  Then she was forgotten by the public that had enthusiastically applauded her, and which only sighed sadly, a year later, on hearing of her death, in a far off Italian town,--sighed, talked a little, and forgot again.  It chanced that a few years later I was in Italy, and being not many miles from the town where I heard that she was buried, and a trifle overstrung by a few months delicious, aimless life in that wonderful country, I was taken with a sentimental fancy to visit her grave.  It was a sort of pilgrimage for me, for I had given to Dillon my first boyish devotion.  I thought of her, and to remember her was to recall her rare charm, her beauty, her success, after a long struggle, and the unexpected, inexplicable manner in which she had abandoned it. It was to recall, too, the delightful evenings I had spent under her influence, the pleasure I had had in the passion of her \"Juliet,\" the poetic charm of her \"Viola\"; the graceful witchery of her \"Rosalind\"; how I had smiled with her \"Portia\"; laughed with her \"Beatrice\"; wept with her \"Camille\"; in fact how I had yielded myself up to her magnetism with that ecstatic pleasure in which one gets the best joys of every passion, because one does not drain the dregs of any.  I well remembered her last night, how she had disappeared, how she had gone to Europe, how she had died abroad,--all mere facts known in their bareness only to the public.  It was hard to find the place where she was buried. But at last I succeeded.  It was in a humble churchyard. The grave was noticeable because it was well kept, and utterly devoid of the tawdry ornamentation inseparable from such places in Italy. It was marked by a monument distinctly unique in a European country. It was a huge unpolished boulder, over which creeping green vines were growing.  On its rough surface a cross was cut, and underneath were the words:      \"Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare,      To-morrow's Silence, Triumph or Despair.\"  Below that I read with stupefaction,       \"Margaret Dillon and child,\"  and the dates  \"January, 1843\" \"July 25, 1882.\"  In spite of the doubts and fancies this put into my mind, I no sooner stood beside the spot where the earth had claimed her, than all my old interest in her returned. I lingered about the place, full of romantic fancies, decorating her tomb with flowers, as I had once decorated her triumphs, absorbed in a dreamy adoration of her memory, and singing her praise in verse.  It was then that I learned the true story of her disappearance, guessed at that of her death, as I did at the identity of the young Dominican priest, who sometimes came to her grave, and who finally told me such of the facts as I know. I can best tell the story by picturing two nights in the life of Margaret Dillon, the two following her last appearance on the stage.  The play had been \"Much Ado.\"  Never had she acted with finer humor, or greater gaiety. Yet all the evening she had felt a strange sadness.  When it was all over, and friends had trooped round to the stage to praise her, and trooped away, laughing and happy, she felt a strange, sad, unused reluctance to see them go.  Then she sat down to her dressing table, hurriedly removed her make-up, and allowed herself to be stripped of her stage finery. Her fine spirits seemed to strip off with her character. She shivered occasionally with nervousness, or superstition, and she was strangely silent.  All day she had, for some inexplicable reason, been thinking of her girlhood, of what her life might have been if, at a critical moment, she had chosen a woman's ordinary lot instead of work,--or if, at a later day, she had yielded to, instead of resisted, a great temptation. All day, as on many days lately, she had wondered if she regretted it, or if, the days of her great triumph having passed,--as pass they must,--she should regret it later if she did not yet.  It was probably because,--early in the season as it was--she was tired, and the October night oppressed her with the heat of Indian Summer.  Silently she had allowed herself to be undressed, and redressed in great haste. But before she left the theatre she bade every one \"good night\" with more than her usual kindliness, not because she did not expect to see them all on Monday,--it was a Saturday night,--but because, in her inexplicably sad humour, she felt an irresistible desire to be at peace with the world, and a still deeper desire to feel herself beloved by those about her.  Then she entered her carriage and drove hurriedly home to the tiny apartment where she lived quite alone.  On the supper table lay a note.  She shivered as she took it up. It was a handwriting she had been accustomed to see once a year only, in one simple word of greeting, always the same word, which every year in eighteen had come to her on New Year's wherever she was.  But this was October.  She sat perfectly still for some minutes, and then resolutely opened the letter, and read:       \"Madge:--I am so afraid that my voice coming to you, not      only across so many years, but from another world, may shock      you, that I am strongly tempted not to keep my word to you,      yet, judging you by myself, I feel that perhaps this will be      less painful than the thought that I had passed forgetful of      you, or changed toward you. You were a mere girl when we      mutually promised, that though it was Fate that our paths      should not be the same, and honorable that we should keep      apart, we would not pass out of life, whatever came, without      a farewell word,--a second saying 'good-bye.'\"       \"It is my fate to say it. It is now God's will. Before it      was yours. It is eighteen years since you chose my honor to      your happiness and mine. To-day you are a famous woman. That      is the consolation I have found in your decision. I      sometimes wonder if Fame will always make up to you for the      rest. A woman's way is peculiar--and right, I suppose. I      have never changed. My son has been a second consolation,      and that, too, in spite of the fact that, had he never been      born, your decision might have been so different. He is a      young man now, strangely like what I was, when as a child,      you first knew me, and he has always been my confidant. In      those first days of my banishment from you I kept from      crying my agony from the housetops by whispering it to him.      His uncomprehending ears were my sole confessional. His      mother cared little for his companionship, and her      invalidism threw him continually into my care. I do not know      when he began to understand, but from the hour he could      speak he whispered your name in his prayers. But it was only      lately that, of himself, he discovered your identity. The      love I felt for you in my early days has grown with me. It      has survived in my heart when all other passions, all      prides, all ambitions, long ago died. I leave you, I hope, a      good memory of me--a man who loved you more than he loved      himself, who for eighteen years has loved you silently, yet      never ceased to grieve for you. But I fear that I have      bequeathed to my son, with the name and estate of his      father, my hopeless love for you. If, by chance, what I fear      be true,--if, when bereft of me, he seeks you out, as be      sure he will,--deal gently with him for his father's sake.       \"There was an old compact between us, dear. I mention it now      only in the hope that you may not have forgotten--indeed,      in the certainty that you have not. I know you so well.      Remember it, I beg of you, only to ignore it. It was made,      you know, when one of us expected to watch the passing of      the other. This is different. If this reminds you of it, it      reminds you only to warn you that Time cancels all such      compacts. It is my voice that assures you of it.  \"FELIX R.\"  Underneath, written in letters, like, yet so unlike, were the words, \"My father died this morning. F. R.\" and an uncertain mark as though he had begun to add \"Jr.\" to the signature, and realized that there was no need.  The letter fell from her hands.  For a long time she sat silent.  Dead! She had never felt that he could die while she lived. A knowledge that he was living,--loving her, adoring her hopelessly--was necessary to her life. She felt that she could not go on without it. For eighteen years she had compared all other men, all other emotions to him and his love, to find them all wanting.  And he had died.  She looked at the date of the letter. He would be resting in that tomb she remembered so well, before she could reach the place; that spot before which they had often talked of"]]]
