Every German who has the very least regard for the dignity of the nation must feel mortally insulted in the person of the Emperor.\"  \"The German people have the right to expect that the French Government and the French nation will give them ample satisfaction, and will wipe out this stain on the honour of France, by sternly calling to order the wretches in question, creatures whom we Germans consider to be the refuse of human society.\"  And we who belong to this \"refuse,\" who flatter ourselves that we have made extraordinary efforts of self-control when we refrained from saying to the Empress Frederick: \"Madame, spare us; let it not be said that you went one day to Saint-Cloud, and on the next to Versailles, lest our resolution to be calm should forsake us\"--we, I say, now perceive, that all our prudence has been wasted, and that we are still \"refuse,\" the refuse of human society.   The character of William II continues to develop its series of eccentricities.  With him, one may be sure of incurring displeasure, but his favours are shortlived.  His mania for change is manifested to a degree unexampled since the days of the decay of the Roman Empire.  His freakishness, the suddenness of his impulses, are becoming enough to create dismay amongst all those who approach him.  One day he will suddenly start off to take by surprise the garrisons of Potsdam and of Rinfueld; he gives the order for boots and saddles, which naturally leads to innumerable accidents.  Next day you will find him issuing a decree that, a play written by one of his _protégés_, entitled _The New Saviour_, is a masterpiece, which he would compel the public to applaud. The best he can do with it is to prevent its being hissed off the stage. Another day he has a room prepared for himself at the Headquarters of the General Staff, where he interferes in the preparation of strategic plans, without paying the least attention to the new chief who has replaced Count Waldersee.  Then, again, he connects his private office with the entire Press organisation, so as to be able to manipulate the reptile fund himself, and to dictate in person the notices he requires, concerning all his proceedings, in the newspapers which he pays in Germany and in those which he buys abroad.  All of a sudden it occurs to him that six more war-ships would round off the German Fleet; and so he demands that they be built on the spot.  His Minister resists, pointing out that the approval of the Reichstag is required, William II flies into a passion, and the wretched Minister obeys.  Suddenly it occurs to him also to remember the existence of a certain Count Vedel, greatly favoured by the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar. He summons him by telegraph, and makes him his favourite of an hour. When it pleases him to remove a superior officer, or to put one on the shelf, nothing stops him, neither the worth of the man, nor the value of the services he may have rendered.  One can readily conceive that German generals live in a state of perpetual fright.  Add to all this that William is becoming impecunious.  He has taken to borrowing, and is reduced to making money out of everything.  What will the Sultan Abdul Hamid say when he learns that the Grand Marshal of the German Court has put up for sale the presents which he offered to the Emperor, his guest, and which are valued at four millions!  These things bring to mind the threat which William II uttered a few days before the fall of Bismarck: \"Those who resist me I will break into a thousand pieces.\"    March 12, 1891. [4]  The many and varied causes which led to the journey of the Empress Frederick to Paris, and the equally numerous results that the Emperor, her son, expected from that visit, are beginning to stand out in such a manner that we can appreciate their significance more and more clearly. This proceeding on the part of William II, like all his actions, was invested with a certain quality of suddenness, but at the same time, it reveals itself as the result of a complicated series of deliberate plans. The object of these last was, as usual, the young monarch's unhealthy craving for making dupes.  To this I shall return later on.  Let us first examine the causes of William's sudden impulses.  He has acquired, and is teaching his people to acquire, the taste and habit of sudden and unexpected happenings.  It having been the habit of Bismarck to speculate on things foreseen, it was inevitable that his jealous adversary should speculate on things unforeseen.  Moreover, the King-Emperor is dominated by that law of compensation, from which neither men nor things can escape, and from which it follows logically that Germany, after having profited by methods of continuity, is now condemned to suffer, in the same proportion, her trials of instability.  In determining upon the journey of his august mother to Paris, the Emperor took no risks other than those which pleased him, and which served the purposes of his grudges and his policy.  In the first place, this journey would serve for a moment to divert attention in Germany from a policy which the great industrials and the workmen, the party of progress and the conservatives, all unite in condemning.  In the next place, Berlin, having for a long time made ready to be amiable to Paris, was bound to resent all the more acutely any failure to reciprocate her kind advances.  These results could not fail to be favourable to the vote of credits for military purposes, which are always the last credits asked for by the Government (whether under Bismarck or under Caprivi) and which are always voted under stress of an appeal to the eternal but utterly non-existent dangers, that are supposed to threaten Germany from France.  If our capital, then, should extend a cold welcome to the august mother of the German Sovereign, the result could not fail to be of immediate advantage to the vote of military credits.  I ask my readers to notice, by the way, the deliberate coincidence of the journey of the Empress with the demand for these credits, and also with the anniversary of the Treaty of Versailles.  Finally, it was to be expected that if she were badly received, the mistake thus committed by the Empress Frederick would make \"the Englishwoman\" more unpopular in Germany; and, so far as one knows, her Imperial son has never been passionately devoted to her.  Moreover, she afforded Bismarck an opportunity of getting rid of a little of his venom, as witness the following words of his--   \"Only an Englishwoman,\" the ex-Chancellor declared during a visit to Mr. Burckardt, \"could possibly have inspired the Emperor with the idea of sending her to Paris as a challenge to the French.  A German woman would have had too much respect for her own dignity to go and visit Versailles and Saint-Cloud.  The nobility of her feelings would have forbidden her to make a triumphal appearance amidst the ruins of the houses and castles destroyed by our troops, and her pride would have prevented her from seeking the homage and the favours of the vanquished.  The Empress is English, and English she will remain.\"   But if France were to welcome with enthusiasm--or even with favour--the Empress Frederick, William II might justifiably conclude (without making allowance for the sympathy which the widow of the Emperor-Martyr inspires in Frenchwomen) that France had accepted the accomplished fact, abandoned her claims to Alsace-Lorraine, and the defence of her future interests in common with Russia.  In that case, he would have treated France as he treats those who show him the greatest devotion.  In order to get a clear idea of the object pursued by William II, it is sufficient to read two short extracts from the _Étoile Belge_, a blind admirer of the Emperor of Germany, and to read them separately from the enthusiastic articles which this paper published at the commencement of the journey of the Empress Frederick.  The correspondent of the _Étoile Belge_ wrote as follows--   \"In confiding his mother and his sister to the hospitality of Paris, William II committed an act as clever as it was courageous.  Let him continue in this policy of pacific advances, and the idea of a reconciliation with Germany will soon become more popular than the Russian Alliance.\"   The Berlin correspondent of the same _Étoile_ wrote--   \"Germany has at least as much as England to gain in bringing it about that Russia should not feel too sure of French support.\"   Is not this clear enough?  There you have it: the real object which underlay the visit incognito of the Empress Frederick for the furtherance of the interests of Germany,  It meant a reconciliation with Germany, which would have separated us from Russia, from which England had everything to gain, which would once more have surrendered our credit to Italy unconditionally, and would have compelled us to renounce Alsace-Lorraine for good and all.  What then would have been the results had she paid us an official visit? We have already seen that none of the alternative schemes for this journey could work to Germany's detriment; we need, therefore, not be astonished at the publicity given by the Count von Münster to all the comings and goings of the Empress, and at the determination shown by Her Majesty to investigate the quality of our patriotism in all its various aspects.  The memories which the Empress went to recall at Saint-Cloud and at Versailles were the same as those which she compelled us to call from the past: memories glorious for her but unforgettably sad for us, memories which, in reminding her of victory, were meant to remind us of a defeat to which our conquerors"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17740"],["title","The Chemistry of Hat Manufacturing (#0)"],["body","CHEMISTRY  OF  HAT MANUFACTURING   LECTURES DELIVERED BEFORE THE HAT MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION  BY  WATSON SMITH, F.C.S., F.I.C.

PREFACE   The subject-matter in this little book is the substance of a series of Lectures delivered before the Hat Manufacturers' Association in the years 1887 and 1888.  About this period, owing to the increasing difficulties of competition with the products of the German Hat Manufacturers, a deputation of Hat Manufacturers in and around Manchester consulted Sir Henry E. Roscoe, F.R.S., then the Professor of Chemistry in the Owens College, Manchester, and he advised the formation of an Association, and the appointment of a Lecturer, who was to make a practical investigation of the art of Hat Manufacturing, and then to deliver a series of lectures on the applications of science to this industry. Sir Henry Roscoe recommended the writer, then the Lecturer on Chemical Technology in the Owens College, as lecturer, and he was accordingly appointed.  The lectures were delivered with copious experimental illustrations through two sessions, and during the course a patent by one of the younger members became due, which proved to contain the solution of the chief difficulty of the British felt-hat manufacturer (see pages 66-68). This remarkable coincidence served to give especial stress to the wisdom of the counsel of Sir Henry Roscoe, whose response to the appeal of the members of the deputation of 1887 was at once to point them to scientific light and training as their only resource. In a letter recently received from Sir Henry (1906), he writes: \"I agree with you that this is a good instance of the _direct money value_ of scientific training, and in these days of 'protection' and similar subterfuges, it is not amiss to emphasise the fact.\"  It is thus gratifying to the writer to think that the lectures have had some influence on the remarkable progress which the British Hat Industry has made in the twenty years that have elapsed since their delivery.  These lectures were in part printed and published in the _Hatters' Gazette_, and in part in newspapers of Manchester and Stockport, and they have here been compiled and edited, and the necessary illustrations added, etc., by Mr. Albert Shonk, to whom I would express my best thanks.

It is absolutely necessary, in order to obtain a useful knowledge of the peculiarities and properties of animal fibres generally, or even specially, that we should be, at least to some extent, familiar with those of the vegetable fibres. I shall therefore have, in the first place, something to tell you of certain principal vegetable fibres before we commence the more special study of the animal fibres most interesting to you as hat manufacturers, namely, wool, fur, and hair. What cotton is as a vegetable product I shall not in detail describe, but I will refer you to the interesting and complete work of Dr. Bowman, _On the Structure of the Cotton Fibre_. Suffice it to say that in certain plants and trees the seeds or fruit are surrounded, in the pods in which they develop, with a downy substance, and that the cotton shrub belongs to this class of plants. A fibre picked out from the mass of the downy substance referred to, and examined under the microscope, is found to be a spirally twisted band; or better, an irregular, more or less flattened and twisted tube (see Fig. 1). We know it is a tube, because on taking a thin, narrow slice across a fibre and examining the slice under the microscope, we can see the hole or perforation up the centre, forming the axis of the tube (see Fig. 2). Mr. H. de Mosenthal, in an extremely interesting and valuable paper (see _J.S.C.I._,[1] 1904, vol. xxiii. p. 292), has recently shown that the cuticle of the cotton fibre is extremely porous, having, in addition to pores, what appear to be minute stomata, the latter being frequently arranged in oblique rows, as if they led into oblique lateral channels. A cotton fibre varies from 2·5 to 6 centimetres in length, and in breadth from 0·017 to 0·05 millimetre. The characteristics mentioned make it very easy to distinguish cotton from other vegetable or animal fibres. For example, another vegetable fibre is flax, or linen, and this has a very different appearance under the microscope (_see_ Fig. 3). It has a bamboo-like, or jointed appearance; its tubes are not flattened, nor are they twisted. Flax belongs to a class called the bast fibres, a name given to certain fibres obtained from the inner bark of different plants. Jute also is a bast fibre. The finer qualities of it look like flax, but, as we shall see, it is not chemically identical with cotton, as linen or flax is. Another vegetable fibre, termed \"cotton-silk,\" from its beautiful, lustrous, silky appearance, has excited some attention, because it grows freely in the German colony called the Camaroons, and also on the Gold Coast. This fibre, under the microscope, differs entirely in appearance from both cotton and flax fibres. Its fibres resemble straight and thin, smooth, transparent, almost glassy tubes, with large axial bores; in fact, if wetted in water you can see the water and air bubbles in the tubes under the microscope. A more detailed account of \"cotton-silk\" appears in a paper read by me before the Society of Chemical Industry in 1886 (see _J.S.C.I._, 1886, vol. v. p. 642). Now the substance of the cotton, linen or flax, as well as that of the cotton-silk fibres, is termed, chemically, cellulose. Raw cotton consists of cellulose with about 5 per cent. of impurities. This cellulose is a chemical compound of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and, according to the relative proportions of these constituents, it has had the chemical formula C_{6}H_{10}O_{5} assigned to it. Each letter stands for an atom of each constituent named, and the numerals tell us the number of the constituent atoms in the whole compound atom of cellulose. This cellulose is closely allied in composition to starch, dextrin, and a form of sugar called glucose. It is possible to convert cotton rags into this form of sugar--glucose--by treating first with strong vitriol or sulphuric acid, and then boiling with dilute acid for a long time. Before we leave these vegetable or cellulose fibres, I will give you a means of testing them, so as to enable you to distinguish them broadly from the animal fibres, amongst which are silk, wool, fur, and hair. A good general test to distinguish a vegetable and an animal fibre is the following, which is known as Molisch's test: To a very small quantity, about 0·01 gram, of the well-washed cotton fibre, 1 c.c. of water is added, then two to three drops of a 15 to 20 per cent. solution of alpha-naphthol in alcohol, and finally an excess of concentrated sulphuric acid; on agitating, a deep violet colour is developed. By using thymol in place of the alpha-naphthol, a red or scarlet colour is produced. If the fibre were one of an animal nature, merely a yellow or greenish-yellow coloured solution would result. I told you, however, that jute is not chemically identical with cotton and linen. The substance of its fibre has been termed \"bastose\" by Cross and Bevan, who have investigated it. It is not identical with ordinary cellulose, for if we take a little of the jute, soak it in dilute acid, then in chloride of lime or hypochlorite of soda, and finally pass it through a bath of sulphite of soda, a beautiful crimson colour develops upon it, not developed in the case of cellulose (cotton, linen, etc.). It is certain that it is a kind of cellulose, but still not identical with true cellulose. All animal fibres, when burnt, emit a peculiar empyreumatic odour resembling that from burnt feathers, an odour which no vegetable fibre under like circumstances emits. Hence a good test is to burn a piece of the fibre in a lamp flame, and notice the odour. All vegetable fibres are easily tendered, or rendered rotten, by the action of even dilute mineral acids; with the additional action of steam, the effect is much more rapid, as also if the fibre is allowed "]]]
