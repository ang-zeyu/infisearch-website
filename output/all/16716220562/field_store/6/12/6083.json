The motive, which, according to the story, Beethoven himself said indicates, in the symphony, the rappings of Fate at the door of human existence, is common to two works which are also related in their spiritual contents. Singularly enough, too, in both cases the struggle which is begun in the first movement and continued in the third, is interrupted by a period of calm reassuring, soul-fortifying aspiration, which in the symphony as well as in the sonata takes the form of a theme with variations. Here, then, the recognition of a simple rhythmical figure has helped us to an appreciation of the spiritual unity of the parts of a symphony, and provided a commentary on the poetical contents of a sonata. But the lesson is not yet exhausted. Again do we find the rhythm coloring the first movement of the pianoforte concerto in G major:  [Music illustration]  Symphony, concerto, and sonata, as the sketch-books of the master show, were in process of creation at the same time.  [Sidenote: _His Seventh Symphony._]  Thus far we have been helped in identifying a melody and studying relationships by the rhythmical structure of a single motive. The demonstration might be extended on the same line into Beethoven's symphony in A major, in which the external sign of the poetical idea which underlies the whole work is also rhythmic--so markedly so that Wagner characterized it most happily and truthfully when he said that it was \"the apotheosis of the dance.\" Here it is the dactyl, [dactyl symbol], which in one variation, or another, clings to us almost as persistently as in Hood's \"Bridge of Sighs:\"      \"One more unfortunate       Weary of breath,     Rashly importunate,       Gone to her death.\"  [Sidenote: _Use of a dactylic figure._]  We hear it lightly tripping in the first movement:  [Music illustration] and [Music illustration];  gentle, sedate, tender, measured, through its combination with a spondee in the second:  [Music illustration];  cheerily, merrily, jocosely happy in the Scherzo:  [Music illustration];  hymn-like in the Trio:  [Music illustration]  and wildly bacchanalian when subjected to trochaic abbreviation in the Finale:  [Music illustration]  [Sidenote: _Intervallic characteristics._]  Intervallic characteristics may place the badge of relationship upon melodies as distinctly as rhythmic. There is no more perfect illustration of this than that afforded by Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Speaking of the subject of its finale, Sir George Grove says:       \"And note--while listening to the simple tune itself, before      the variations begin--how _very_ simple it is; the plain      diatonic scale, not a single chromatic interval, and out of      fifty-six notes only three not consecutive.\"[A]  [Sidenote: _The melodies in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony._]  Earlier in the same work, while combating a statement by Lenz that the resemblance between the second subject of the first movement and the choral melody is a \"thematic reference of the most striking importance, vindicating the unity of the entire work, and placing the whole in a perfectly new light,\" Sir George says:       \"It is, however, very remarkable that so many of the      melodies in the Symphony should consist of consecutive      notes, and that in no less than four of them the notes      should run up a portion of the scale and down      again--apparently pointing to a consistent condition of      Beethoven's mind throughout this work.\"  [Sidenote: _Melodic likenesses._]  Like Goethe, Beethoven secreted many a mystery in his masterpiece, but he did not juggle idly with tones, or select the themes of his symphonies at hap-hazard; he would be open to the charge, however, if the resemblances which I have pointed out in the Fifth and Seventh Symphonies, and those disclosed by the following melodies from his Ninth, should turn out through some incomprehensible revelation to be mere coincidences:  From the first movement:  [Music illustration]  From the second:  [Music illustration]  The choral melody:  [Music illustration]  [Sidenote: _Design and Form._]  From a recognition of the beginnings of design, to which identification of the composer's thematic material and its simpler relationships will lead, to so much knowledge of Form as will enable the reader to understand the later chapters in this book, is but a step.  FOOTNOTES:  [A] \"Beethoven and His Nine Symphonies,\" p. 374.     III  _The Content and Kinds of Music_   [Sidenote: _Metaphysics to be avoided herein._]  Bearing in mind the purpose of this book, I shall not ask the reader to accompany me far afield in the region of æsthetic philosophy or musical metaphysics. A short excursion is all that is necessary to make plain what is meant by such terms as Absolute music, Programme music, Classical, Romantic, and Chamber music and the like, which not only confront us continually in discussion, but stand for things which we must know if we would read programmes understandingly and appreciate the various phases in which music presents itself to us. It is interesting and valuable to know why an art-work stirs up pleasurable feelings within us, and to speculate upon its relations to the intellect and the emotions; but the circumstance that philosophers have never agreed, and probably never will agree, on these points, so far as the art of music is concerned, alone suffices to remove them from the field of this discussion.  [Sidenote: _Personal equation in judgment._]  Intelligent listening is not conditioned upon such knowledge. Even when the study is begun, the questions whether or not music has a content beyond itself, where that content is to be sought, and how defined, will be decided in each case by the student for himself, on grounds which may be said to be as much in his nature as they are in the argument. The attitude of man toward the art is an individual one, and in some of its aspects defies explanation.  [Sidenote: _A musical fluid._]  The amount and kind of pleasure which music gives him are frequently as much beyond his understanding and control as they are beyond the understanding and control of the man who sits beside him. They are consequences of just that particular combination of material and spiritual elements, just that blending of muscular, nervous, and cerebral tissues, which make him what he is, which segregate him as an individual from the mass of humanity. We speak of persons as susceptible or insusceptible to music as we speak of good and poor conductors of electricity; and the analogy implied here is particularly apt and striking. If we were still using the scientific terms of a few decades ago I should say that a musical fluid might yet be discovered and its laws correlated with those of heat, light, and electricity. Like them, when reduced to its lowest terms, music is a form of motion, and it should not be difficult on this analogy to construct a theory which would account for the physical phenomena which accompany the hearing of music in some persons, such as the recession of blood from the face, or an equally sudden suffusion of the same veins, a contraction of the scalp accompanied by chilliness or a prickling sensation, or that roughness of the skin called goose-flesh, \"flesh moved by an idea, flesh horripilated by a thought.\"  [Sidenote: _Origin of musical elements._]  [Sidenote: _Feelings and counterpoint._]  It has been denied that feelings are the content of music, or that it is the mission of music to give expression to feelings; but the scientific fact remains that the fundamental elements of vocal music--pitch, quality, and dynamic intensity--are the results of feelings working upon the vocal organs; and even if Mr. Herbert Spencer's theory be rejected, it is too late now to deny that music is conceived by its creators as a language of the emotions and so applied by them. The German philosopher Herbarth sought to reduce the question to an absurdity by expressing surprise that musicians should still believe that feelings could be \"the proximate cause of the rules of simple and double counterpoint;\" but Dr. Stainer found a sufficient answer by accepting the proposition as put, and directing attention to the fact that the feelings of men having first decided what was pleasurable in polyphony, and the rules of counterpoint having afterward been drawn from specimens of pleasurable polyphony, it was entirely correct to say that feelings are the proximate cause of the laws of counterpoint.  [Sidenote: _How composers hear music._]  It is because so many of us have been taught by poets and romancers to think that there is a picture of some kind, or a story in every piece of music, and find ourselves unable to agree upon the picture or the story in any given case, that confusion is so prevalent among the musical laity. Composers seldom find difficulty in understanding each other. They listen for beauty, and if they find it they look for the causes which have produced it, and in apprehending beauty and recognizing means and cause they unvolitionally rise to the plane whence a view of the composer's purposes is clear. Having grasped the mood of a composition and found that it is being sustained or varied in a manner accordant with their conceptions of beauty, they occupy themselves with another kind of differentiation altogether than the misled disciples of the musical rhapsodists who overlook the general design and miss the grand proclamation in their search for petty suggestions for pictures and stories among the details of the composition. Let musicians testify for us. In his romance, \"Ein Glücklicher Abend,\" Wagner says:  [Sidenote: _Wagner's axiom._]       \"That which music expresses is eternal and ideal. It does      not give voice to the passion, the love, the longing of this      or the other"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17474"],["title","How to Listen to Music, 7th ed. (#5)"],["body",", under these or the other      circumstances, but to passion, love, longing itself.\"  Moritz Hauptmann says:  [Sidenote: _Hauptmann's._]       \"The same music will admit of the most varied verbal      expositions, and of not one of them can it be correctly said      that it is exhaustive, the right one, and contains the whole      significance of the music. This significance is contained      most definitely in the music itself. It is not music that is      ambiguous; it says the same thing to everybody; it speaks to      mankind and gives voice only to human feelings. Ambiguity      only then makes its appearance when each person attempts to      formulate in his manner the emotional impression which he      has received, when he attempts to fix and hold the ethereal      essence of music, to utter the unutterable.\"  [Sidenote: _Mendelssohn's._]  [Sidenote: _The \"Songs without Words.\"_]  Mendelssohn inculcated the same lesson in a letter which he wrote to a young poet who had given titles to a number of the composer's \"Songs Without Words,\" and incorporated what he conceived to be their sentiments in a set of poems. He sent his work to Mendelssohn with the request that the composer inform the writer whether or not he had succeeded in catching the meaning of the music. He desired the information because \"music's capacity for expression is so vague and indeterminate.\" Mendelssohn replied:       \"You give the various numbers of the book such titles as 'I      Think of Thee,' 'Melancholy,' 'The Praise of God,' 'A Merry      Hunt.' I can scarcely say whether I thought of these or      other things while composing the music. Another might find      'I Think of Thee' where you find 'Melancholy,' and a real      huntsman might consider 'A Merry Hunt' a veritable 'Praise      of God.' But this is not because, as you think, music is      vague. On the contrary, I believe that musical expression is      altogether too definite, that it reaches regions and dwells      in them whither words cannot follow it and must necessarily      go lame when they make the attempt as you would have them      do.\"  [Sidenote: _The tonal language._]  [Sidenote: _Herbert Spencer's definition._]  [Sidenote: _Natural expression._]  [Sidenote: _Absolute music._]  If I were to try to say why musicians, great musicians, speak thus of their art, my explanation would be that they have developed, farther than the rest of mankind have been able to develop it, a language of tones, which, had it been so willed, might have been developed so as to fill the place now occupied by articulate speech. Herbert Spencer, though speaking purely as a scientific investigator, not at all as an artist, defined music as \"a language of feelings which may ultimately enable men vividly and completely to impress on each other the emotions they experience from moment to moment.\" We rely upon speech to do this now, but ever and anon when, in a moment of emotional exaltation, we are deserted by the articulate word we revert to the emotional cry which antedates speech, and find that that cry is universally understood because it is universally felt. More than speech, if its primitive element of emotionality be omitted, more than the primitive language of gesture, music is a natural mode of expression. All three forms have attained their present stage of development through conventions. Articulate speech has led in the development; gesture once occupied a high plane (in the pantomimic dance of the ancients) but has now retrograded; music, supreme at the outset, then neglected, is but now pushing forward into the place which its nature entitles it to occupy. When we conceive of an art-work composed of such elements, and foregoing the adventitious helps which may accrue to it from conventional idioms based on association of ideas, we have before us the concept of Absolute music, whose content, like that of every noble artistic composition, be it of tones or forms or colors or thoughts expressed in words, is that high ideal of goodness, truthfulness, and beauty for which all lofty imaginations strive. Such artworks are the instrumental compositions in the classic forms; such, too, may be said to be the high type of idealized \"Programme\" music, which, like the \"Pastoral\" symphony of Beethoven, is designed to awaken emotions like those awakened by the contemplation of things, but does not attempt to depict the things themselves. Having mentioned Programme music I must, of course, try to tell what it is; but the exposition must be preceded by an explanation of a kind of music which, because of its chastity, is set down as the finest form of absolute music. This is Chamber music.  [Sidenote: _Chamber music._]  [Sidenote: _History of the term._]  [Sidenote: _Haydn a servant._]  In a broad sense, but one not employed in modern definition, Chamber music is all music not designed for performance in the church or theatre. (Out-of-door music cannot be considered among these artistic forms of aristocratic descent.) Once, and indeed at the time of its invention, the term meant music designed especially for the delectation of the most eminent patrons of the art--the kings and nobles whose love for it gave it maintenance and encouragement. This is implied by the term itself, which has the same etymology wherever the form of music is cultivated. In Italian it is _Musica da Camera_; in French, _Musique de Chambre_; in German, _Kammermusik_. All the terms have a common root. The Greek [Greek: kamara] signified an arch, a vaulted room, or a covered wagon. In the time of the Frankish kings the word was applied to the room in the royal palace in which the monarch's private property was kept, and in which he looked after his private affairs. When royalty took up the cultivation of music it was as a private, not as a court, function, and the concerts given for the entertainment of the royal family took place in the king's chamber, or private room. The musicians were nothing more nor less than servants in the royal household. This relationship endured into the present century. Haydn was a _Hausofficier_ of Prince Esterhazy. As vice-chapelmaster he had to appear every morning in the Prince's ante-room to receive orders concerning the dinner-music and other entertainments of the day, and in the certificate of appointment his conduct is regulated with a particularity which we, who remember him and reverence his genius but have forgotten his master, think humiliating in the extreme.  [Sidenote: _Beethoven's Chamber music._]  Out of this cultivation of music in the private chamber grew the characteristics of Chamber music, which we must consider if we would enjoy it ourselves and understand the great reverence which the great masters of music have always felt for it. Beethoven was the first great democrat among musicians. He would have none of the shackles which his predecessors wore, and compelled aristocracy of birth to bow to aristocracy of genius. But such was his reverence for the style of music which had grown up in the chambers of the great that he devoted the last three years of his life almost exclusively to its composition; the peroration of his proclamation to mankind consists of his last quartets--the holiest of holy things to the Chamber musicians of to-day.  [Sidenote: _The characteristics of Chamber music._]  Chamber music represents pure thought, lofty imagination, and deep learning. These attributes are encouraged by the idea of privacy which is inseparable from the form. Composers find it the finest field for the display of their talents because their own skill in creating is to be paired with trained skill in hearing. Its representative pieces are written for strings alone--trios, quartets, and quintets. With the strings are sometimes associated a pianoforte, or one or more of the solo wind instruments--oboe, clarinet, or French horn; and as a rule the compositions adhere to classical lines (see Chapter V.). Of necessity the modesty of the apparatus compels it to forego nearly all the adventitious helps with which other forms of composition gain public approval. In the delineative arts Chamber music shows analogy with correct drawing and good composition, the absence of which cannot be atoned for by the most gorgeous coloring. In no other style is sympathy between performers and listeners so necessary, and for that reason Chamber music should always be heard in a small room with performers and listeners joined in angelic wedlock. Communities in which it flourishes under such conditions are musical.  [Sidenote: _Programme music._]  [Sidenote: _The value of superscriptions._]  [Sidenote: _The rule of judgment._]  Properly speaking, the term Programme music ought to be applied only to instrumental compositions which make a frank effort to depict scenes, incidents, or emotional processes to which the composer himself gives the clew either by means of a descriptive title or a verbal motto. It is unfortunate that the term has come to be loosely used. In a high sense the purest and best music in the world is programmatic, its programme being, as I have said, that \"high ideal of goodness, truthfulness, and beauty\" which is the content of all true art. But the origin of the term was vulgar, and the most contemptible piece of tonal imitation now claims kinship in the popular mind with the exquisitely poetical creations of Schumann and the \"Pastoral\" symphony of Beethoven; and so it is become necessary to defend it in the case of noble compositions. A programme is not necessarily, as Ambros asserts, a certificate of poverty and an admission on the part of the composer that his art has got beyond its natural bounds. Whether it be merely a suggestive title, as in the case of some of the compositions of Beethoven, Schumann, and Mendelssohn, or an extended commentary, as in the symphonic poems of Liszt and the symphonies of Berlioz and Raff, the programme has a distinct value to the composer as"]]]
