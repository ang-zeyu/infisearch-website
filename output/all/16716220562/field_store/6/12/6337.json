A Strange Stooary.  Aw know some fowk will call it crime,    To put sich stooaries into ryhme, But yet, contentedly aw chime    Mi simple ditty: An if it's all a waste o' time,    The moor's the pity.          -------  O'er Wibsey Slack aw coom last neet, Wi' reekin heead and weary feet, A strange, strange chap, aw chonced to meet;    He made mi start; But pluckin up, aw did him greet    Wi beatin heart.  His dress wor black as black could be, An th' latest fashion aw could see, But yet they hung soa dawderly,    Like suits i' shops; Bith heart! yo mud ha putten three    Sich legs i'th' slops.  Says aw, \"Owd trump, it's rather late For one at's dress'd i' sich a state, Across this Slack to mak ther gate:    Is ther some pairty? Or does ta allus dress that rate--    Black duds o'th' wairty?\"  He twisted raand as if to see What sooart o' covy aw cud be, An' grinned wi sich a maath at me,    It threw me sick! \"Lor saves!\" aw cried, \"an' is it thee    At's call'd ow'd Nick!\"  But when aw luk'd up into th' place, Whear yo'd expect to find a face; A awful craytur met mi gaze,    It took mi puff: \"Gooid chap,\" aw sed, \"please let me pass,    Aw've seen enough!\"  Then bendin cloise daan to mi ear, He tell'd me 'at aw'd nowt to fear, An' soa aw stop't a bit to hear    What things he'd ax; But as he spake his, teeth rang clear,    Like knick-a-nacks.  \"A'a, Jack,\" he sed, \"aw'm capt 'wi thee Net knowin sich a chap as me; For oft when tha's been on a spree,    Aw've been thear too; But tho' aw've reckon'd safe o' thee,    Tha's just edged throo.  Mi name is Deeath--tha needn't start, And put thi hand upon thi heart, For tha ma see 'at aw've noa dart    Wi which to strike; Let's sit an' tawk afoor we part,    O'th edge o'th dyke.\"  \"Nay, nay, that tale weant do, owd lad, For Bobby Burns tells me tha had A scythe hung o'er thi' shoulder, Gad!    Tha worn't dress'd I' fine black clooath; tha wore' a plad    Across thi breast!\"  \"Well, Jack,\" he said, \"thar't capt no daat To find me' wanderin abaght; But th' fact is, lad, 'at aw'm withaat    A job to do; Mi scythe aw've had to put up th' spaat,    Mi arrows too.\"  \"Yo dunnot mean to tell to me, 'At fowk noa moor will ha' to dee?\" \"Noa, hark a minit an' tha'll see    When th' truth aw tell! Fowk do withaat mi darts an me,    Thev kill thersel.  They do it too at sich a rate Wol mi owd system's aght o' date; What we call folly, they call fate;    An' all ther pleasur Is ha' to bring ther life's estate    To th' shortest measur.  They waste ther time, an' waste ther gains, O' stuff 'at's brew'd throo poisoned grains, Thro' morn to neet they keep ther brains,    For ever swimmin, An' if a bit o' sense remains,    It's fun i'th wimmen.  Tha'll find noa doctors wi ther craft, Nor yet mysen wi scythe or shaft, E'er made as monny deead or daft,    As Gin an' Rum, An' if aw've warn'd fowk, then they've lafft    At me, bi gum!  But if they thus goa on to swill, They'll not want Wilfrid Lawson's bill, For give a druffen chap his fill,    An sooin off pops he, An teetotal fowk moor surely still,    Will dee wi th' dropsy.  It's a queer thing at sich a nation Can't use a bit o' moderation; But one lot rush to ther damnation    Through love o'th bottle: Wol others think to win salvation    Wi being teetotal.\"  Wi' booany neive he stroked mi heead, \"Tak my advice, young chap,\" he sed, \"Let liquors be, sup ale asteead,    An' tha'll be better, An' dunnot treat th' advice tha's heard    Like a dead letter.\"  \"Why Deeath,\" aw sed, \"fowk allus say, Yo come to fotch us chaps away! But this seems strange, soa tell me pray,    Ha wor't yo coom? Wor it to tell us keep away,    Yo hav'nt room?\"  \"Stop whear tha art, Jack, if tha dar But tha'll find spirits worse bi far Sarved aght i' monny a public bar,    At's thowt quite lawful; Nor what tha'll find i'th' places par-    Sons call soa awful.\"  \"Gooid bye!\" he sed, an' off he shot, Leavin behind him sich a lot O' smook, as blue as it wor hot!    It set me stewin! Soa hooam aw cut, an' gate a pot    Ov us own brewin.             ---------  If when yo've read this stooary through, Yo daat if it's exactly true, Yo'll nobbut do as others do,    Yo may depend on't. Blow me! aw ommost daat it too,    So thear's an end on't     Take Heart.  Roughest roads, we often find,    Lead us on to th' nicest places; Kindest hearts oft hide behind    Some o'th' plainest-lukkin faces.  Flaars' whose colors breetest are,    Oft delight awr wond'ring seet; But thers others, humbler far,    Smell a thaasand times as sweet.  Burds o' monny color'd feather,    Please us as they skim along, But ther charms all put together,    Connot equal th' skylark's song.  Bonny women--angels seemin,--    Set awr hearts an' brains o' fire; But its net ther beauties; beamin,    Its ther gooidness we admire.  Th' bravest man 'at's in a battle,    Isn't allus th' furst i'th' fray; He best proves his might an' mettle,    Who remains to win the day.  Monkey's an' vain magpies chatter,    But it doesn't prove em wise; An it's net wi noise an' clatter,    Men o' sense expect to rise.  'Tisn't them 'at promise freely,    Are mooast ready to fulfill; An' 'tisn't them 'at trudge on dreely   'At are last at top o'th' hill.  Bad hauf-craans may pass as payment,    Gaudy flaars awr een beguile; Women may be loved for raiment,    Show may blind us for a while;  But we sooin grow discontented,    An' for solid worth we sigh, An' we leearn to prize the jewel,    Tho it's hidden from the eye.  Him 'at thinks to gether diamonds    As he walks along his rooad, Niver need be tired wi' huggin,    For he'll have a little looad.  Owt 'at's worth a body's winnin    Mun be toiled for long an' hard; An' tho' th' struggle may be pinnin,    Perseverance wins reward.  Earnest thowt, an' constant striving,    Ever wi' one aim i'th' seet; Tho' we may be late arrivin,    Yet at last we'st come in reight.  He who WILL succeed, he MUST,    When he's bid false hopes farewell. If he firmly fix his trust    In his God, and in hissel,     Did yo Iver.  Gooid gracious! cried Susy, one fine summer's morn,    Here's a bonny to do! aw declare! Aw wor niver soa capt sin th' day aw wor born!    Aw near saw sich a seet at a Fair.  Here, Sally! come luk!

But what does ta say? \"Aw mun draand 'em?\" nooan soa!    Just luk ha they're seekin ther mother; Shoo must be a poor little softheead to goa;    For awm nooan baan to cause her noa bother.  But its rayther to bad, just to mak her hooam thear,    For mi old en's net fit to be seen in An' this new en, awm thinkin, ul luk rayther queer,    After sich a rum lot as thats been in.  But shut up awr pussy, an heed what aw say;    Yo mun keep a sharp e'e or shoo'll chait us; Ah if shoo sees th' mother shoo'll kill it! An pray    What mun become o' thease poor helpless crayturs?  A'a dear! fowk have mich to be thankful for, yet,    'At's a roof o' ther own to cawer under, For if we'd to seek ony nook we could get,    Whativer 'ud come on us aw wonder?  We should nooan on us like to be turned aat o' door,    Wi a lot a young bairns to tak 'care on: Ah' although awm baat bonnet, an think misen poor,    What little aw have yo'st have t'share on.  That poor little maase aw dooant think meant me harm,    Shoo ne'er knew what that bonnet had cost me; All shoo wanted wor some little nook snug an' warm,    An' a gooid two o'-three shillin its lost me.  Aw should think as they've come into th' world born i' silk,    They'll be aristocratical varmin; But awm wasting mi time! awl goa get 'em some milk,    An' na daat but th' owd lass likes it warmin.  Bless mi life! a few drops 'll sarve them! If we try,    Awm weel sure we can easily spare 'em, But as sooin as they're able, awl mak 'em all fly!    Never mind' if aw dooant! harum scarum!     An Old Man's Christmas Morning.  Its a long time sin' thee an' me       have met befoor, owd lad,--    Soa pull up thi cheer, an' sit daan,       for ther's noabdy moor welcome nor thee: Thi toppin's grown whiter nor once,--       yet mi heart feels glad,    To see ther's a rooas o' thi cheek,       an' a bit ov a leet i' thi e'e.  Thi limbs seem to totter an' shake,       like a crazy owd fence,    'At th' wind maks to tremel an' creak;       but tha still fills thi place; An' it shows 'at tha'rt bless'd       wi' a bit o' gradely gooid sense,    'At i' spite o' thi years an' thi cares,       tha still wears a smile o' thi face.

An' first of all tha mun knaw       'at aw havn't been spar'd,    For trials an' troubles have come,       an' mi heart has felt well nigh to braik; An' mi wife, 'at tha knaws wor mi pride,       an' mi fortuns has shared,    Shoo bent under her griefs,       an' shoo's flown far, far away aat o' ther raik.  My life's like an owd gate       'ats nobbut one hinge for support,    An' sometimes aw wish--aw'm soa lonely--       at tother 'ud drop off wi' rust; But it hasn't to be, for it seems       Life maks me his "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17799"],["title","Yorkshire Ditties, Second Series (#4)"],["body","spooart,    An' Deeath cannot even spare time,       to turn sich an owd man into dust.  Last neet as aw sat an' watched th' yule log       awd put on to th' fire,    As it cracked, an' sparkled, an' flared       up wi' sich gusto an' spirit, An' when it wor touch'd it shone breeter,       an' flared up still higher,    Till at last aw'd to shift th' cheer further back       for aw couldn't bide near it.  Th' dull saand o' th' church bells       coom to tell me one moor Christmas mornin',    Had come, for its welcome--       but ha could aw welcome it when all aloan? For th' snow wor fallin soa thickly,       an' th' cold wind wor moanin,    An' them 'at aw lov'd wor asleep       i' that cold church yard, under a stoan:  Soa aw went to bed an' aw slept,       an' then began dreamin,    'At mi wife stood by mi side, an' smiled,       an' mi heart left off its beatin', An' aw put aat mi hand, an' awoke,       an' mornin' wor gleamin';    An' its made me feel sorrowful,       an aw cannot give ovver freatin.  For aw think what a glorious Christmas day       'twod ha' been,    If awd goan to that place, where ther's noa moor cares,       nor partin', nor sorrow, For aw know shoo's thear,       or that dream aw sud nivver ha' seen,    But aw'll try to be patient,       an' maybe shoo'll come fotch me to-morrow.  It's forty' long summers an' winters,       sin tha bade \"gooid bye,\"    An' as fine a young fella tha wor,       as iver aw met i' mi life; When tha went to some far away land,       thi fortune to try,    An' aw stopt at hooam to toil on,       becoss it wor th' wish o' my wife.  An' shoo wor a bonny young wench,       an' better nor bonny,--    Aw seem nah as if aw can see her,       wi' th' first little bairn on her knee, An' we called it Ann,       for aw liked that name best ov ony,    An' fowk said it wor th' pictur o' th' mother,       wi' just a strinklin o' me.  An' th' next wor a lad, an' th' next wor a lad!       then a lass came,--    That made us caant six,--       an' six happier fowk niver sat to a meal, An' they grew like hop plants--full o' life--       but waikly i' th' frame,    An' at last one drooped,       an' Deeath coom an' marked her with his seal.  A year or two moor       an' another seemed longin to goa,    An' all we could do wor to smooth his deeath bed,       'at he might sleep sweeter-- Then th' third seemed to sicken an' pine,       an' we couldn't say \"noa,\"    For he said his sister had called,       an' he wor most anxious to meet her--  An' how we watched th' youngest,       noa mortal can tell but misen,    For we prized it moor,       becoss it wor th' only one left us to cherish; At last her call came,       an' shoo luked sich a luk at us then,    Which aw ne'er shall forget,       tho mi mem'ry ov all other things perish.  A few years moor,       when awr griefs wor beginnin to lighten,    Mi friends began askin my wife,       if shoo felt hersen hearty an' strong? An' aw niver saw at her face       wor beginning to whiten,    Till sho grew like a shadow,       an' aw couldn't even guess wrong.  Then aw stood beside th' grave       when th' saxton wor shovin in th' gravel,    An' he said \"this last maks five,       an' aw think ther's just room for another,\" An' aw went an' left him,       lonely an' heartsick to travel,    Till th' time comes when aw may lig daan       beside them four bairns an' ther mother.  An' aw think what a glorious Christmas day       'twod ha been    If aw'd gooan to that place where ther's noa moor cares,       nor partin, nor sorrow; An aw knaw they're thear,       or that dream aw should niver ha seen,    But aw'll try to be patient,       an' maybe shoo'll come fotch me to-morrow.     Billy Bumble's Bargain.  Young Billy Bumble bowt a pig,    Soa aw've heeard th' neighbors say; An' mony a mile he had to trig    One sweltin' summer day; But Billy didn't care a fig,    He said he'd mak it pay; He _knew_ it wor a bargain,    An' he cared net who said nay.  He browt it hooam to Ploo Croft loin,    But what wor his surprise To find all th' neighbors standing aat,    We oppen maaths an' eyes; \"By gow!\" sed Billy, to hissen,    \"This pig _must_ be a prize!\" An' th' wimmen cried, \"Gooid gracious fowk!    But isn't it a size?\"  Then th' chaps sed, \"Billy, where's ta been?    Whativer has ta browt? That surely isn't crayture, lad,    Aw heeard 'em say tha'd bowt? It luks moor like a donkey,    Does ta think 'at it con rawt?\" But Billy crack'd his carter's whip.    An' answered' em wi' nowt.  An' reight enuff it war a pig,    If all they say is true, Its length war five foot eight or nine,    Its height wor four foot two; An' when it coom to th' pig hoil door,    He couldn't get it through, Unless it went daan ov its knees,    An' that it wodn't do.  Then Billy's mother coomed to help,    An' hit it wi' a mop; But thear it wor, an' thear it seem'd    Detarmined it 'ud stop; But all at once it gave a grunt,    An' oppen'd sich a shop; An' finding aat 'at it wor lick'd,    It laup'd clean ovver th' top.  His mother then shoo shook her heead,    An' pool'd a woeful face; \"William,\" shoo sed, \"tha shouldn't bring    Sich things as theas to th' place. Aw hooap tha art'nt gooin to sink    Thi mother i' disgrace; But if tha buys sich things as thease    Aw'm feared it will be th' case!\"  \"Nah, mother, niver freat.\" sed Bill,    \"Its one aw'm goin to feed, Its rayther long i'th' legs, aw know,    But that's becoss o'th' breed; If its a trifle long i'th' grooin,    Why hang it! niver heed! Aw know its net a beauty,    _But its cheap, it is, indeed!\"_  \"Well time 'ul try,\" his mother sed,--    An' time at last did try; For niver sich a hungry beeast    Had been fed in a sty. \"What's th' weight o'th' long legged pig, Billy!\"    Wor th' neighbors' daily cry; \"Aw connot tell yo yet,\" sed Bill,    \"Aw'll weigh it bye an' bye.\"   An' hard poor Billy persevered,    But all to noa avail, It swallow'd all th' mait it could get,    An' wod ha' swallow'd th' pail; But Billy took gooid care to stand    O'th' tother side o'th' rail; But fat it didn't gain as mich    As what 'ud greeas its tail.  Pack after pack o' mail he bowt,    Until he'd bought fourteen; But net a bit o' difference    I'th' pig wor to be seen: Its legs an' snowt wor just as long    As iver they had been; Poor Billy caanted rib bi rib    An' heaved a sigh between.  One day he, mix'd a double feed,    An' put it into th' troff; \"Tha greedy lukkin beeast,\" he sed,    \"Aw'll awther stawl thee off, Or else aw'll brust thi hide--that is    Unless 'at its to toff!\" An' then he left it wol he went    His mucky clooas to doff.  It worn't long befoor he coom    To see ha matters stood; He luk'd at th' troff, an' thear it wor,    Five simple bits o' wood, As cleean scraped aat as if it had    Ne'er held a bit o' food; \"Tha slotch!\" sed Bill, \"aw do believe    Tha'd ait me if tha could.\"  Next day he browt a butcher,    For his patience had been tried, An' wi a varry deeal to do,    Its legs wi rooap they tied; An' then his shinin knife he drew    An' stuck it in its side-- It mud ha been a crockadile,    Bi th' thickness ov its hide.  But blooid began to flow, an' then    Its long legg'd race wor run; They scalded, scraped, an' hung it up,    An' when it all wor done, Fowk coom to guess what weight it wor,    And mony a bit o' fun They had, for Billy's mother said    \"It ought to weigh a ton.\"  Billy wor walkin up an' daan,    Dooin nowt but fume an' fidge! He luk'd at th' pig--then daan he set,    I'th nook o'th' window ledge, He saw th' back booan wor sticken aght,    Like th' thin end ov a wedge; It luk'd like an' owd blanket    Hung ovver th' winterhedge.  His mother rooar'd an' th' wimmen sigh'd,    But th' chaps did nowt but laff; Poor Billy he could hardly bide,    To sit an' hear ther chaff-- Then up he jumped, an' off he run,    But whear fowk niver knew; An' what wor th' warst, when mornin' coom,    Th' deead pig had mizzled too.  Th' chaps wander'd th' country far an' near,    Until they stall'd thersen; But nawther Billy nor his pig    Coom hooam agean sin then; But oft fowk say, i'th' deead o'th' neet,    Near Shibden's ruined mill, The gooast o' Billy an' his pig    May be seen runnin still.     Moral.  Yo fowk 'ats tempted to goa buy    Be careful what yo do; Dooant be persuaded coss \"its _cheap_,\"    For if yo do yo'll rue; Dooant think its lowerin to yor sen    To ax a friend's advice, Else like poor Billy's pig, 't may be    Bowt dear at ony price.     Rejected.  Gooid bye, lass, aw dunnot blame,    Tho' mi loss is hard to bide! For it wod ha' been a shame,    Had tha ivver been the bride Of a workin chap like me; One 'ats nowt but love to gie.  Hard hoot'd neives like thease o' mine.    Surely ne'er wor made to press Hands so lily-white as thine;    Nor should arms like thease caress One so slender, fair, an' pure, 'Twor unlikely, lass, aw'm sure.  But thease tears aw cannot stay,    Drops o' sorrow fallin fast, Hopes once held aw've put away    As a dream, an think its past; But mi poor heart loves thi still, An' wol life is mine it will.  When aw'm seated, lone and sad,    Wi mi scanty, hard won meal, One thowt still shall mak me glad,    Thankful that alone aw feel What it is to tew an'strive Just to keep a soul alive.  Th' whin-bush rears o'th' moor its form,    An' wild winds rush madly raand, But it whistles to the storm,    In the barren home it's faand; Natur fits it to be poor, An 'twor vain to strive for moor.  If it for a lily sighed,    An' a lily chonced to grow, When it found the fair one died,    Powerless to brave the blow Of the first rude gust o' wind, Which had left its wreck behind.  Then 'twod own 'twor better fate    Niver to ha' held the prize; Whins an' lilies connot mate,    Sich is not ther destinies; Then 'twor wrang for one like me, One soa poor, to sigh for thee.  Then gooid bye, aw dunnot blame,    Tho' mi loss it's hard to bide, For it wod ha' been a shame  "]]]
