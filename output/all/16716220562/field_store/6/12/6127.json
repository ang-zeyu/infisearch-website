It teaches you to marvel at the mystery of Creation. Yesterday when the Doctor and I were gathering the Christmas boughs, the holly glade in the forest seemed like some ancient mystic Christmas temple of the Druids where one might tell his rosary in crimson holly beads and forget the world!\"  Well--perhaps there was something fine and sweet and holy in the country something--a tranquil simplicity--a hearty ruggedness--that city dwellers forfeited in their head-long rush for man-made pleasure. After all, perhaps the most enduring happiness lay in the heart of these quiet hills.  \"My chief is very keen on country life,\" said Ralph suddenly. \"He preaches a lot. Development of home-spirit and old-fashioned household gods--that sort of thing! He's a queerish sort of chap--my chief--and a bit too--er--candid at times. He was dad's old classmate, you know.\" And Ralph fell silent again, frowning.  So Price was to take his father's practise! How it must gall the old Doctor! And mother was lonely, eh?--and Dad's rheumatism getting the best of him--Why Great Guns! mother and dad were growing _old_! And some of those snow-white hairs of theirs had come from worrying over him--John had said so. Ralph's dark face burned in the chill night wind. Well, for all old John's cutting sarcasm, his father still had faith in him and the trust in young Roger's eloquent eyes had fairly hurt him. God! they did not know! And then this queer Christmas heart-glow. How Griffin and Edwards and the rest of his gay friends would mock him for it? _Friends!_ After all--had he any friends in the finer sense of that finest of words? Such warm-hearted loyal friends for instance as these neighbors of his father's who had been dropping in all day with a hearty smile and a Christmas hand-shake. And black-eyed Sister Madge--this brave, little fighting gipsy-poet here--where--But here Ralph frowned again and looked away and even when the cheerful lights of home glimmered through the trees he was still thinking--after an impetuous burst of confidence to Sister Madge.  So, later, when Doctor Ralph entered his father's study--his chin was very determined.  \"I was ashamed to tell you this morning, sir,\" he said steadily, \"but I--I'm no longer on the staff of St. Michael's. My hand was shaking and--and the chief knew why. And, dad,\" he faced the old Doctor squarely, \"I'm coming back home to keep your practise out of Price's fool hands. You've always wanted that and my chief has preached it too, though I couldn't see it somehow until to-day. And presently, sir, when--when my hand is steadier, I'm going to make the little chap walk and run. I've--promised Sister Madge.\" And the old Doctor cleared his throat and gulped--and finally he wiped his glasses and walked away to the window. For of all things God could give him--this surely was the best!  \"Oh, grandpop,\" cried little John Leslie 3rd, bolting into the study in great excitement--\"Come see Roger! We kids have made him the Christmas king and he's got a crown o' holly on and--and a wand and he's a-tappin' us this way with it to make us Knights. And I'm the Fir-tree Knight--and Bob--he's a Cedar Knight and Ned's a spruce and Roger--he says his pretty sister tells him stories like that smarter'n any in the books. Oh--do hurry!\"  The old Doctor held out his hand to his son.  \"Well, Doctor Ralph,\" he said huskily, \"suppose we go tell mother.\"  So while the Doctor told Aunt Ellen, Ralph bent his knee to this excited Christmas King enthroned in the heart of the fire-shadows.  \"Rise--\" said Roger radiantly, tapping him with a cedar wand, \"I--I dub thee first of all my knights--the good, kind Christmas Knight!\"  \"And here,\" said Ralph, smiling, \"here's Sister Madge. What grand title now shall we give to her?\" But as Sister Madge knelt before him with firelit shadows dancing in her sweet, dark eyes, Roger dropped the wand and buried his face on her shoulder with a little sob.  \"Nothing good enough for Sister Madge, eh?\" broke in the old Doctor, looking up. \"Well, sir, I think you're right.\"  Now in the silence Aunt Ellen spoke and her words were like a gentle Christmas benediction.  \"'Unto us,'\" said Aunt Ellen Leslie as she turned the Christmas log, \"'this night a son is given!'\"  But Ralph, by the window, had not heard. For wakening again in his heart as he stared at the peaceful, moonlit, \"God-made\" hills--was the old forgotten boyish love for this rugged, simple life of his father's dwarfing the lure of the city and the mockery of his fashionable friends. And down the lane of years ahead, bright with homely happiness and service to the needs of others--was the dark and winsome face of Sister Madge, stirring him to ardent resolution.     Part Two  In Which We Light the New Log with the Embers of the Old     I  The Fire Again   \"Doctor!\" said little Roger slyly, \"you got your chin stuck out!\"  The Doctor stroked his grizzled beard in hasty apology.  \"God bless my soul,\" he admitted guiltily. \"I do believe I have. You've been so quiet,\" he added accusingly, \"curled up there by the fire that I must certainly have gotten lonesome. And I most always stick out my chin that way when I'm lonesome.\"  Roger, by way of reparation, betook himself to the arm of the Doctor's chair.  The Doctor's arm closed tight around him. A year ago this little adopted son of his had been very lame. It was the first Christmas in his life, indeed, that he had walked.  \"Out there,\" said the Doctor, \"the winter twilight's been fighting the alder berries with purple spears. It's conquered everything in the garden and covered it up with misty velvet save the snow and the berries. But the twilight's using heavier spears now and likely it'll win. _I_ want the alder berries to win out, drat it! Their blaze is so bright and cheerful.\"  Roger accepted the challenge to argument with enthusiasm.  \"_I_ want the twilight to win,\" he said.  The Doctor looked slightly scandalized.  \"Oh, my, my, my, my!\" he said. \"I can't for the life of me understand any such gloomy preference as that. Bless me, if I can.\"  \"Why,\" crowed Roger jubilantly, \"_I_ can, 'cause the more twilighty it gets, the more it's Christmas eve!\"  The Doctor regarded his small friend with admiration.  \"By George,\" he admitted, \"I do believe you have me there--\" but the Doctor's kindly eyes did not fire to the name of Christmas as Roger thought they ought.  \"Almost,\" he said, \"I thought you were going to stick out your chin again. And you're not lonesome now 'cause I'm here an' pretty noisy.\"  \"Hum!\" said the Doctor.  \"Man to man, now!\" urged Roger suddenly.  This was the accepted key to a confessional ceremony which required much politeness and ruthless honesty.  \"Well, Mr. Hildreth,\" began the Doctor formally.  Roger's face fell.  \"I'm your adopted son,\" he hinted, \"and you said that made my name same as yours.\"  \"Mr. Leslie!\" corrected the Doctor, and Roger glowed.  \"Well, Mr. Leslie,\" went on the Doctor thoughtfully, \"I'm chuck full of grievances. There's the rheumatism in my leg, for instance. That's no sort of thing to have at Christmas.\"  \"But that's better,\" said Roger. \"You said so this morning. I 'spect you been thinkin' too much about it like you said I did when my leg was stiff.\"  \"Ahem! And I did hope somebody would come home for Christmas. I like a house full of romping youngsters--\"  Roger pointed an accusing finger.  \"Aunt Ellen says every blessed one of your children, an' your grand-children too, begged and begged you to come to the city for Christmas an'--an' you wouldn't go 'cause you're old-fashioned and like a country Christmas so much better--an'--an' because you'd promised to teach me to skate on the Deacon's pond an' take me sleighin'.\"  \"Dear me,\" said the Doctor helplessly, \"for such a mite of a kiddy, you do seem remarkably well informed.\"  \"Man to man,\" reminded Roger inexorably and the Doctor aired his final grievance.  \"And then there's that youngest son of mine--\"  \"Doctor Ralph?\"  \"Doctor Ralph! What right had he, I'd like to know, to marry that pretty sister of yours and go off honeymooning holiday time. Didn't he know that we needed him and Sister Madge here for Christmas? I miss 'em both. Young pirate!\"  Roger's heart swelled with loyalty. It was Doctor Ralph's skilful hand that had helped him walk.  \"Most likely,\" he said fairly, \"I'm a little to blame there. After I came home from the hospital, I did tell Sister Madge to marry him--\"  \"Most likely,\" acknowledged the Doctor, \"I said something similar to Doctor Ralph. I can't have you shouldering all the responsibility. Well, your Honor, there's the Christmas evidence. What's the verdict?\"  Roger considered. This man to man game had certain phraseological conclusions.  \"No case!\" he said suddenly, nor would he alter his decision when the Doctor protested against its severity.  \"You had so awful many peoply sort of places to go,\" pointed out Roger, and the Doctor laughed.  \"And let you spend this first Christmas on your two legs in a _city_?\" he demanded. \"Well, I guess not! No-sir-ee-bob! There!--the alder berries have faded out and the garden's thick with twilight.\"  \"And it's Christmas eve!\" cried Roger, his black eyes shining with delight.  \"Speaking of Christmas,\" said the Doctor, sniffing luxuriously, \"I feel that I ought to slip out to the kitchen for a minute or so. I do smell something tremendously Christmasy and spicy--\"  Roger caught his breath. With a Christmas intrigue as surely in the air as the smell of spice, here was dangerous ground.  \"Aunt Ellen,\" he faltered, \"Aunt Ellen said she couldn't pos'bly be bothered with--with any men folks in the kitchen--not even me.\"  \"Pooh!\" rebelled the Doctor largely, \"that's merely a ruse of hers to protect the cookies. And what I'd like to know is just this--what's Aunt Ellen doing in the kitchen anyway? Certainly old Annie's able to do the Christmas fussing for three people. Aunt Ellen ought to be in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17510"],["title","When the Yule Log Burns: A Christmas Story (#4)"],["body","with us. That was part of my lonesome grievance but I forgot to mention it.\"  Roger, shivering apprehensively, visioned suspicious stores of Christmas delicacies--holly and evergreen--and a supper table set for _ten_! And off somewhere among those purple spears of twilight old Asher, the hired man, was waiting at the station with the big farm sleigh.  He must keep his eye upon the Doctor until six o'clock, and lure him away from the window.  \"Tell me a story,\" begged Roger--\"over here by the fire.\" And his voice was so very tremulous and urgent that the hungry Doctor abandoned his notion of a Christmas cookie, and complied.  To Roger, in a nervous ecstasy of anticipation, the story was a blurred hodge-podge of phrases and crackling fire, distant noises of clinking china and hurrying feet, and wild flights of imagination.... Old Asher must be coming past the red barn now ... and now down the hill ... and now past the Deacon's pond ... and now--  Sleigh-bells fairly leaped out of the quiet, and Roger jumped and gulped, aquiver with excitement. The Doctor regarded him with mild disfavor.  \"Bless my soul,\" he said in surprise, \"that was the quietest part of my story. You're restless.\"  \"Go on!\" said Roger hoarsely, and the obliging Doctor, mistaking his agitation for interest, went on with his tale.  But Roger had heard old Asher driving along by the picket fence and turning in at the gate-posts, and the story was no more to him than the noisy crackle of the log. Off somewhere in the region of the kitchen door he detected a subdued scuffle of many feet.  The grandfather's clock struck six.... Roger's cheeks were blazing--the fire and the Doctor still duetting.... Why, oh, why didn't somebody come and call them to supper?... There had been plenty of time now for everything. Why--  The door swung back and Roger jumped. Old Annie, Asher's wife, stood in the doorway, her wrinkled face inscrutable.  \"Supper, sir!\" she said and vanished. Hand in hand, the Doctor and Roger went out to supper.  The dining-room door was closed. That in itself was unusual. But the unsuspecting Doctor pushed through with Roger at his heels, only to halt and stare dumfounded over his spectacles while Roger screamed and danced and clapped his hands. For to the startled eyes of Doctor John Leslie, the snug, old-fashioned room was alive with boys and holly--boys and boys and boys upon boys, he would have told you in that first instant of delighted consternation, in different stages of embarrassment and rags. And one had but to glance at the faces of old Asher and Annie in the kitchen doorway, at Aunt Ellen, hovering near her Christmas brood with the look of all mothers in her kind, brown eyes, and then at Roger, scarlet with enthusiasm, to know that the Doctor had been the victim of benevolent conspiracy.  \"It's a s'prise!\" shrieked Roger, \"a Christmasy s'prise! Aunt Ellen she says you're so awful keen on s'prisin' other folks that we'd show you--an'--an' you'll have a bang-up Christmas with kids like you love an' so will I, an' so will they an' the minister he went to the city and found seven boys crazy for Christmas in the country an'--\"  \"Roger! Roger!\" came Aunt Ellen's gentle voice--\"do please take a breath, child. You're turning purple.\"  The Doctor adjusted his glasses.  \"Seven boys!\" he said. \"Bless my soul, when I opened that door I saw seventy boys!\" He counted them aloud--then for no reason at all save that he had glanced into seven eager faces, thinner and sharper than he liked, for all they glowed with excitement and furtive interest in the long supper table asparkle with lights and holly, he wiped his glasses and patted Roger on the back.  \"Is your leg botherin' so much now, daddy Doctor?\" demanded Roger.  \"Nothing like so much,\" admitted the Doctor.  \"Are you lonesome 'nuff now to stick out your chin?\"  \"Bless your heart, Roger,\" admitted the Doctor huskily, \"I'm so full of Christmas I can hardly breathe!\"  \"Hooray!\" said Roger. \"Me, too.\"     II  It Blazes Higher   It was well that the Doctor had a way with boys, for there was a problem to be solved here with infinite tact--a problem of protuberant eyes and paralyzing self-consciousness, of unnatural silences and then unexpected attempts at speech that died in painful rasps and gurgles, of stubbing toes and nudging elbows, of a centipedal supply of arms and legs that interfered with abortive and conscience-stricken attempts at courtesy, and above all an interest in the weave of the carpet that was at once a mania and an epidemic--but by the time supper was well under way, things, in the language of Roger, had begun to hum, and by the time the Doctor had mastered the identities of his guests, from Jim, the shy, sullen boy who would not meet his eyes, to Mike's little brother, Muggs, who consumed prodigious quantities of everything in staring silence, and looked something like a girl save for a tardily-cast-off suit of Mike's, somewhat oceanic in flow and fit, the hum had become celebrative and distinctly a thing of Christmas.  Constraint in the mellowing halo of a Christmas eve supper where holly and a Yule-log blazed and the winter wind frostily rattled the checker-paned windows of the sitting-room in jealous spleen, fled to join the Doctor's rheumatism.  By the time the grandfather's clock struck seven through a haze of holly, the Doctor had pokered the Yule-log into a frenzied shower of gold; apples and nuts were steadily disappearing from a basket by the Doctor's chair and the Doctor himself was relating an original Christmas tale of adventure, born of uncommon inspiration and excitement, to a huddled group with circular eyes and contented stomachs. But Muggs--inimitable workman--his small face partially obscured by the biggest apple in the basket, had not yet spoken, and Jim, the shy, sullen little boy to whom Roger had taken a fancy because he was lame, had met the Doctor's eyes but once, and then with a rush of color.  Now, whether it was the scheming excitement of a busy day or the warmth of a busy log or the rambling yarn of a busy Doctor, who may say? Certainly Roger fell asleep at a fictional crisis and remained asleep for all that Jim furtively nudged him.  \"There!\" said the Doctor as the clock struck eight, \"that's all. To bath and beds, every one of you! Annie's had a lamp on the kitchen table this half hour ready to light you up the stairs. My! My! My!--but there's a busy day ahead. Roger! Well, of all ungrateful listeners! Roger!\"  But in the end, the Doctor carried Roger up to bed, preceded by Annie with the lamp. And while Annie was turning back quilts and smoothing pillows and fumbling at windows, with the freedom of long service she soundly berated the Doctor for postponing the bed-time hour with his Christmas twaddle.  \"And Mister Muggs there,\" she said severely, \"has had one apple too many, I'm thinkin', and the last one as big as his head. He'll need a pill before morning. The child's packed himself that hard and round ye fear to touch him.\" And then because Muggs was such a very little boy Annie was minded to assist with his bath, and laid kindly hands upon an indefinite outer garment which began immediately beneath his arm-pits and ended at his shoe-tops in singular fringe.  \"An', ma'am,\" she explained to Aunt Ellen a little later, \"I had to let him go in to his bath by himself. No more had I touched his bushel-basket of rags--an' they were hitched over his shoulders with school straps and somebody's shirtwaist underneath--than he let out a terrific shriek (ye must have heard him) an' all the boys come runnin' and crowdin' round him and starin' so frightened at me, an' his brother yelled at him to keep quiet or something or somebody'd get him, and he kept quiet that sudden I could fairly see the child swell. He's unnatural still and unnatural full, ma'am, an' the Doctor better leave his pills handy.\"  Bathed and freshly night-gowned, the Doctor's guests tumbled, a little noisily into bed. Only Jim lay silent and wakeful. Once he nudged his bed-fellow.  \"Luke,\" he whispered, \"d'ye think I'd orta tell 'em?\"  \"Aw,\" said Luke sleepily, \"dry up, Jim! Gosh, ain't the bed soft!\"  Jim sighed.  Christmas came to the old farmhouse with the distant echo of village bells at midnight but, long before that, Christmas, in a fur cap and great-coat had swept up the driveway with a jingle of sleigh-bells, behind old Polly, the Doctor's mare, his sleigh packed high with bundles. By the light of a late moon, flinging festal silver on the snow, it might be seen that Christmas resembled a somewhat guilty looking old gentleman with a grizzled beard.  \"I'll catch old Scratch!\" he admitted, suddenly overcome by the bulbous appearance of the sleigh, \"but Ellen may say what she will. She _couldn't_ have thought of everything!\"  No call for pills came that night from Muggs, asleep in a crib that had seen much service. He was awake however long before daylight, trembling with excitement.  \"Mike, oh Mike!\" he called hoarsely. \"Wake up. It's Christmas mornin'.\"  Mike, in a big bed with Marty Fay, sat up.  \"Don't you _dare_ open your mouth to-day!\" he cried in blood-thirsty accents, \"or Mom Murphy'll git ye surer'n scat. Ain't I schemed enuff to git ye here? Huh? Wanta be sent home--huh?\" Muggs ducked beneath the blankets with a shivering wail.     III  The Log at Dawn   In the still, cold corridors of a farmhouse, with frost-jungles clouding every window pane and a zero-dark outside, the cry of \"Merry Christmas!\" is most at home. Let noses be ever so cold and blanketed bodies ever so warm, the cry fills the dawn with electric energy. The Doctor began it. He knew by the instant response that he had started something that he could not stop. Almost in no time, it seemed, Roger was leading a wild, bare-footed scamper down the stairs--for Roger _knew_--and the Doctor, hastily bath-robed and slippered, was on behind with a lamp. But here was no cyclonic invasion of a dark, cold sitting-ro"]]]
