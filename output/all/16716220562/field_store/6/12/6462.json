I gathered myself up and made for the lighted sitting-room.  \"Quick, Smith!\" I said--but I did not recognize my own voice. \"Quick-- come out of that room.\"  I crossed to the settee, and shaking in every limb, sank down upon it. Nayland Smith, still wild-eyed, and his face a mask of bewilderment, came out of the bedroom and stood watching me.  \"For God's sake what has happened, Petrie?\" he demanded, and began clutching at the lobe of his left ear and looking all about the room dazedly.  \"The Flower of Silence!\" I said; \"some one has been at work in the top corridor.... Heaven knows when, for since we engaged these rooms we have not been much away from them ... the same device as in the case of poor Hale.... You would have tried to brush the thing away ...\"  A light of understanding began to dawn in my friend's eyes. He drew himself stiffly upright, and in a loud, harsh voice uttered the words: \"Sâkya Mûni\"--and again: \"Sâkya Mûni.\"  \"Thank God!\" I said shakily. \"I was not too late.\"  Nayland Smith, with much rattling of glass, poured out two stiff pegs from the decanter. Then--  \"_Ssh!_what's that?\" he whispered.  He stood, tense, listening, his head cast slightly to one side.  A very faint sound of shuffling and tapping was perceptible, coming, as I thought, from the incomplete stairway communicating with the upper corridor.  \"The man with the limp!\" whispered Smith.  He bounded to the door and actually had one hand upon the bolt, when he turned, and fixed his gaze upon the brass box.  \"No!\" he snapped; \"there are occasions when prudence should rule. Neither of us must leave these rooms to-night!\"    CHAPTER V  JOHN KI'S   \"What is the meaning of Si-Fan?\" asked Detective-sergeant Fletcher.  He stood looking from the window at the prospect below; at the trees bordering the winding embankment; at the ancient monolith which for unnumbered ages had looked across desert sands to the Nile, and now looked down upon another river of many mysteries. The view seemed to absorb his attention. He spoke without turning his head.  Nayland Smith laughed shortly.  \"The Si-Fan are the natives of Eastern Tibet,\" he replied.  \"But the term has some other significance, sir?\" said the detective; his words were more of an assertion than a query.  \"It has,\" replied my friend grimly. \"I believe it to be the name, or perhaps the sigil, of an extensive secret society with branches stretching out into every corner of the Orient.\"  We were silent for awhile. Inspector Weymouth, who sat in a chair near the window, glanced appreciatively at the back of his subordinate, who still stood looking out. Detective-sergeant Fletcher was one of Scotland Yard's coming men. He had information of the first importance to communicate, and Nayland Smith had delayed his departure upon an urgent errand in order to meet him.  \"Your case to date, Mr. Smith,\" continued Fletcher, remaining with hands locked behind him, staring from the window, \"reads something like this, I believe: A brass box, locked, contents unknown, has come into your possession. It stands now upon the table there. It was brought from Tibet by a man who evidently thought that it  had something to do with the Si-Fan. He is dead, possibly by the agency of members of this group. No arrests have been made. You know that there are people here in London who are anxious to regain the box. You have theories respecting the identity of some of them, but there are practically no facts.\"  Nayland Smith nodded his head.  \"Exactly!\" he snapped.  \"Inspector Weymouth, here,\" continued Fletcher, \"has put me in possession of such facts as are known to him, and I believe that I have had the good fortune to chance upon a valuable one.\"  \"You interest me, Sergeant Fletcher,\" said Smith. \"What is the nature of this clue?\"  \"I will tell you,\" replied the other, and turned briskly upon his heel to  face us.  He had a dark, clean-shaven face, rather sallow complexion, and deep-set, searching eyes. There was decision in the square, cleft chin and strong character in the cleanly chiseled features. His manner was alert.  \"I have specialized in Chinese crime,\" he said; \"much of my time is spent amongst our Asiatic visitors. I am fairly familiar with the Easterns who use the port of London, and I have a number of useful acquaintances among them.\"  Nayland Smith nodded. Beyond doubt Detective-sergeant Fletcher knew his business.  \"To my lasting regret,\" Fletcher continued, \"I never met the late Dr. Fu-Manchu. I understand, sir, that you believe him to have been a high official of this dangerous society? However, I think we may get in touch with some other notabilities; for instance, I'm told that one of the people you're looking for has been described as 'the man with the limp'?\"  Smith, who had been about to relight his pipe, dropped the match on the carpet and set his foot upon it. His eyes shone like steel.  \"'The man with the limp,'\" he said, and slowly rose to his feet--\"what do you know of the man with the limp?\"  Fletcher's face flushed slightly; his words had proved more dramatic than he had anticipated.  \"There's a place down Shadwell way,\" he replied, \"of which, no doubt, you  will have heard; it has no official title, but it is known to habitués as the Joy-Shop....\"  Inspector Weymouth stood up, his burly figure towering over that of his slighter confrère.  \"I don't think you know John Ki's, Mr. Smith,\" he said. \"We keep all those places pretty well patrolled, and until this present business cropped up, John's establishment had never given us any trouble.\"  \"What is this Joy-Shop?\" I asked.  \"A resort of shady characters, mostly Asiatics,\" replied Weymouth. \"It's a gambling-house, an unlicensed drinking-shop, and even worse-- but it's more use to us open than it would be shut.\"  \"It is one of my regular jobs to keep an eye on the visitors to the Joy-Shop,\" continued Fletcher. \"I have many acquaintances who use the place. Needless to add, they don't know my real business! Well, lately several of them have asked me if I know who the man is that hobbles about the place with two sticks. Everybody seems to have heard him, but no one has seen him.\"  Nayland Smith began to pace the floor restlessly.  \"I have heard him myself,\" added Fletcher, \"but never managed to get so much as a glimpse of him.  When I learnt about this Si-Fan mystery, I realized that he might very possibly be the man for whom you're looking--and a golden opportunity has cropped up for you to visit the Joy-Shop, and, if our luck remains in, to get a peep behind the scenes.\"  \"I am all attention,\" snapped Smith.  \"A woman called Zarmi has recently put in an appearance at the Joy-Shop. Roughly speaking, she turned up at about the same time as the unseen man with the limp....\"  Nayland Smith's eyes were blazing with suppressed excitement; he was pacing quickly up and down the floor, tugging at the lobe of his left ear.  \"She is--different in some way from any other woman I have ever seen in the place. She's a Eurasian and good-looking, after a tigerish fashion. I have done my best\"--he smiled slightly--\"to get in her good books, and up to a point I've succeeded. I was there last night, and Zarmi asked me if I knew what she called a 'strong feller.'  \"'These,' she informed me, contemptuously referring to the rest of the company, 'are poor weak Johnnies!'  \"I had nothing definite in view at the time, for I had not then heard about your return to London, but I thought it might lead to something anyway, so I promised to bring a friend along to-night. I don't know what we're wanted to do, but ...\"  \"Count on me!\" snapped Smith. \"I will leave all details to you and to Weymouth, and I will be at New Scotland Yard this evening in time to adopt a suitable disguise. Petrie\"--he turned impetuously to me--\"I fear I shall have to go without you; but I shall be in safe company, as you see, and doubtless Weymouth can find you a part in his portion of the evening's program.\"  He glanced at his watch.  \"Ah! I must be off. If you will oblige me, Petrie, by putting the brass box into my smaller portmanteau, whilst I slip my coat on, perhaps Weymouth, on his way out, will be good enough to order a taxi. I shall venture to breathe again once our unpleasant charge is safely deposited in the bank vaults!\"   CHAPTER VI  THE SI-FAN MOVE   A slight drizzling rain was falling as Smith entered the cab which the hall-porter had summoned. The brown bag in his hand contained the brass box which actually was responsible for our presence in London. The last glimpse I had of him through the glass of the closed window showed him striking a match to light his pipe--which he rarely allowed to grow cool.  Oppressed with an unaccountable weariness of spirit, I stood within the lobby looking out upon the grayness of London in November. A slight mental effort was sufficient to blot out that drab prospect and to conjure up before my mind's eye a balcony overlooking the Nile--a glimpse of dusty palms, a white wall overgrown with purple blossoms, and above all the dazzling vault of Egypt. Upon the balcony my imagination painted a figure, limning it with loving details, the figure of Kâramaneh; and I thought that her glorious eyes would be sorrowful and her lips perhaps a little tremulous, as, her arms resting upon the rail of the balcony, she looked out across the smiling river to the domes and minarets of Cairo--and beyond, into the hazy distance; seeing me in dreary, rain-swept London, as I saw her, at Gezîra beneath the cloudless sky of Egypt.  From these tender but mournful reflections I aroused myself, almost angrily, and set off through the muddy streets towards Charing Cross; for I was availing myself of the opportunity to call upon Dr. Murray, who had purchased my small suburban practice when (finally, as I thought at the time) I had left London.  This matter occupied me for the greater"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17959"],["title","The Hand of Fu-Manchu (#5)"],["body","of the afternoon, and I returned to the New Louvre Hotel shortly after five, and seeing no one in the lobby whom I knew, proceeded immediately to our apartment. Nayland Smith was not there, and having made some changes in my attire I descended again and inquired if he had left any message for me.  The booking-clerk informed me that Smith had not returned; therefore I resigned myself to wait. I purchased an evening paper and settled down in the lounge where I had an uninterrupted view of the entrance doors. The dinner hour approached, but still my friend failed to put in an appearance. Becoming impatient, I entered a call-box and rang up Inspector Weymouth.  Smith had not been to Scotland Yard, nor had they received any message from him. Perhaps it would appear that there was little cause for alarm in this, but I, familiar with my friend's punctual and exact habits, became strangely uneasy. I did not wish to make myself ridiculous, but growing restlessness impelled me to institute inquiries regarding the cabman who had driven my friend. The result of these was to increase rather than to allay my fears.  The man was a stranger to the hall-porter, and he was not one of the taximen who habitually stood upon the neighboring rank; no one seemed to have noticed the number of the cab.  And now my mind began to play with strange doubts and fears. The driver, I recollected, had been a small, dark man, possessing remarkably well-cut olive-hued features. Had he not worn spectacles he would indeed have been handsome, in an effeminate fashion.  I was almost certain, by this time, that he had not been an Englishman; I was almost certain that some catastrophe had befallen Smith. Our ceaseless vigilance had been momentarily relaxed--and this was the result!  At some large bank branches there is a resident messenger. Even granting that such was the case in the present instance, I doubted if the man could help me, unless, as was possible, he chanced to be familiar with my friend's appearance, and had actually seen him there that day. I determined, at any rate, to make the attempt; reentering the call-box, I asked for the bank's number.  There proved to be a resident messenger, who, after a time, replied to my call. He knew Nayland Smith very well by sight, and as he had been on duty in the public office of the bank at the time that Smith should have arrived, he assured me that my friend had not been there that day!  \"Besides, sir,\" he said, \"you say he came to deposit valuables of some kind here?\"  \"Yes, yes!\" I cried eagerly.  \"I take all such things down on the lift to the vaults at night, sir, under the supervision of the assistant manager--and I can assure you that nothing of the kind has been left with us to-day.\"  I stepped out of the call-box unsteadily. Indeed, I clutched at the door for support.  \"What is the meaning of Si-Fan?\" Detective-sergeant Fletcher had asked that morning. None of us could answer him; none of us knew. With a haze seeming to dance between my eyes and the active life in the lobby before me, I realized that the Si-Fan--that unseen, sinister power-- had reached out and plucked my friend from the very midst of this noisy life about me, into its own mysterious, deathly silence.    CHAPTER VII  CHINATOWN   \"It's no easy matter,\" said Inspector Weymouth, \"to patrol the vicinity of John Ki's Joy-Shop without their getting wind of it. The entrance, as you'll see, is a long, narrow rat-hole of a street running at right angles to the Thames. There's no point, so far as I know, from which the yard can be overlooked; and the back is on a narrow cutting belonging to a disused mill.\"  I paid little attention to his words. Disguised beyond all chance of recognition even by one intimate with my appearance, I was all impatience to set out. I had taken Smith's place in the night's program; for, every possible source of information having been tapped in vain, I now hoped against hope that some clue to the fate of my poor friend might be obtained at the Chinese den which he had designed to visit with Fletcher.  The latter, who presented a strange picture in his make-up as a sort of half-caste sailor, stared doubtfully at the Inspector; then--  \"The River Police cutter,\" he said, \"can drop down on the tide and lie off under the Surrey bank. There's a vacant wharf facing the end of the street and we can slip through and show a light there, to let you know we've arrived. You reply in the same way. If there's any trouble, I shall blaze away with this\"--he showed the butt of a Service revolver protruding from his hip pocket--\"and you can be ashore in no time.\"  The plan had one thing to commend it, viz., that no one could devise another. Therefore it was adopted, and five minutes later a taxi-cab swung out of the Yard containing Inspector Weymouth and two ruffianly looking companions--myself and Fletcher.  Any zest with which, at another time, I might have entered upon such an expedition, was absent now. I bore with me a gnawing anxiety and sorrow that precluded all conversation on my part, save monosyllabic replies, to questions that I comprehended but vaguely.  At the River Police Depot we found Inspector Ryman, an old acquaintance, awaiting us. Weymouth had telephoned from Scotland Yard.  \"I've got a motor-boat at the breakwater,\" said Ryman, nodding to Fletcher, and staring hard at me.  Weymouth laughed shortly.  \"Evidently you don't recognize Dr. Petrie!\" he said.  \"Eh!\" cried Ryman--\"Dr. Petrie! why, good heavens, Doctor, I should never have known you in a month of Bank holidays! What's afoot, then?\"--and he turned to Weymouth, eyebrows raised interrogatively.  \"It's the Fu-Manchu business again, Ryman.\"  \"Fu-Manchu! But I thought the Fu-Manchu case was off the books long ago? It was always a mystery to me; never a word in the papers; and we as much in the dark as everybody else--but didn't I hear that the Chinaman, Fu-Manchu, was dead?\"  Weymouth nodded.  \"Some of his friends seem to be very much alive, though\" he said. \"It appears that Fu-Manchu, for all his genius--and there's no denying he was a genius, Ryman--was only the agent of somebody altogether bigger.\"  Ryman whistled softly.  \"Has the real head of affairs arrived, then?\"  \"We find we are up against what is known as the Si-Fan.\"  At that it came to the inevitable, unanswerable question.  \"What is the Si-Fan?\"  I laughed, but my laughter was not mirthful. Inspector Weymouth shook his head.  \"Perhaps Mr. Nayland Smith could tell you that,\" he replied; \"for the Si-Fan got him to-day!\"  \"Got him!\" cried Ryman.  \"Absolutely! He's vanished! And Fletcher here has found out that John Ki's place is in some way connected with this business.\"  I interrupted--impatiently, I fear.  \"Then let us set out, Inspector,\" I said, \"for it seems to me that we are wasting precious time--and you know what that may mean.\" I turned to Fletcher. \"Where is this place situated, exactly? How do we proceed?\"  \"The cab can take us part of the way,\" he replied, \"and we shall have to walk the rest. Patrons of John's don't turn up in taxis, as a rule!\"  \"Then let us be off,\" I said, and made for the door.  \"Don't forget the signal!\" Weymouth cried after me, \"and don't venture into the place until you've received our reply....\"  But I was already outside, Fletcher following; and a moment later we were both in the cab and off into a maze of tortuous streets toward John Ki's Joy-Shop.  With the coming of nightfall the rain had ceased, but the sky remained heavily overcast and the air was filled with clammy mist. It was a night to arouse longings for Southern skies; and when, discharging the cabman, we set out afoot along a muddy and ill-lighted thoroughfare bordered on either side by high brick walls, their monotony occasionally broken by gateways, I felt that the load of depression which had settled upon my shoulders must ere long bear me down.  Sounds of shunting upon some railway siding came to my ears; train whistles and fog signals hooted and boomed. River sounds there were, too, for we were close beside the Thames, that gray old stream which has borne upon its bier many a poor victim of underground London. The sky glowed sullenly red above.  \"There's the Joy-Shop, along on the left,\" said Fletcher, breaking in upon my reflections. \"You'll notice a faint light; it's shining out through the open door. Then, here is the wharf.\"  He began fumbling with the fastenings of a dilapidated gateway beside which we were standing; and a moment later--  \"All right--slip through,\" he said.  I followed him through the narrow gap which the ruinous state of the gates had enabled him to force, and found myself looking under a low arch, with the Thames beyond, and a few hazy lights coming and going on the opposite bank.  \"Go steady!\" warned Fletcher. \"It's only a few paces to the edge of the wharf.\"  I heard him taking a box of matches from his pocket.  \"Here is my electric lamp,\" I said. \"It will serve the purpose better.\"  \"Good,\" muttered my companion. \"Show a light down here, so that we can find our way.\"  With the aid of the lamp we found our way out on to the rotting timbers of the crazy structure. The mist hung denser over the river, but through it, as through a dirty gauze curtain, it was possible to discern some of the greater lights on the opposite shore. These, without exception, however, showed high up upon the fog curtain; along the water level lay a belt of darkness.  \"Let me give them the signal,\" said Fletcher, shivering slightly and taking the lamp from my hand.  He flashed the light two or three times. Then we both stood watching the belt of darkness that followed the Surrey shore. The tide lapped upon the timbers supporting the wharf and little whispers and gurgling sounds stole up from beneath our feet. Once there was a faint splash from somewhere below and behind us.  \"There goes a rat,\" said Fletcher vaguely, and without taking his gaze from the darkness under the distant shore. \""]]]
