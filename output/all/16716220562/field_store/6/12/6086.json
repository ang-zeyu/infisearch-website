Chapelain, the old lawyer, the conciliating man par excellence,--“come, let us to the table.”  They sat down.  But Mme. Favoral had scarcely helped the soup, when the bell rang violently.  Almost at the same moment the servant appeared, and announced:  “The Baron de Thaller!”  More pale than his napkin, the cashier stood up.  “The manager,” he stammered, “the director of the Mutual Credit Society.”    II  Close upon the heels of the servant M. de Thaller came.  Tall, thin, stiff, he had a very small head, a flat face, pointed nose, and long reddish whiskers, slightly shaded with silvery threads, falling half-way down his chest.  Dressed in the latest style, he wore a loose overcoat of rough material, pantaloons that spread nearly to the tip of his boots, a wide shirt-collar turned over a light cravat, on the bow of which shone a large diamond, and a tall hat with rolled brims.  With a blinking glance, he made a rapid estimate of the dining-room, the shabby furniture, and the guests seated around the table.  Then, without even condescending to touch his hat, with his large hand tightly fitted into a lavender glove, in a brief and imperious tone, and with a slight accent which he affirmed was the Alsatian accent:  “I must speak with you, Vincent,” said he to his cashier, “alone and at once.”  M. Favoral made visible efforts to conceal his anxiety.  “You see,”  he commenced, “we are dining with a few friends, and--”  “Do you wish me to speak in presence of everybody?” interrupted harshly the manager of the Mutual Credit.  The cashier hesitated no longer.  Taking up a candle from the table, he opened the door leading to the parlor, and, standing respectfully to one side:  “Be kind enough to pass on, sir,” said he: “I follow you.”  And, at the moment of disappearing himself,  “Continue to dine without me,” said he to his guests, with a last effort at self-control.  “I shall soon catch up with you.  This will take but a moment.  Do not be uneasy in the least.”  They were not uneasy, but surprised, and, above all, shocked at the manners of M. de Thaller.  “What a brute!” muttered Mme. Desclavettes.  M. Desormeaux, the head clerk at the Department of Justice, was an old legitimist, much imbued with reactionary ideas.  “Such are our masters,” said he with a sneer, “the high barons of financial feudality.  Ah! you are indignant at the arrogance of the old aristocracy; well, on your knees, by Jupiter! on your face, rather, before the golden crown on field of gules.”  No one replied: every one was trying his best to hear.  In the parlor, between M. Favoral and M. de Thaller, a discussion of the utmost violence was evidently going on.  To seize the meaning of it was not possible; and yet through the door, the upper panels of which were of glass, fragments could be heard; and from time to time such words distinctly reached the ear as dividend, stockholders, deficit, millions, etc.  “What can it all mean? great heaven!” moaned Mme. Favoral.  Doubtless the two interlocutors, the director and the cashier, had drawn nearer to the door of communication; for their voices, which rose more and more, had now become quite distinct.  “It is an infamous trap!” M. Favoral was saying.  “I should have been notified--”  “Come, come,” interrupted the other.  “Were you not fully warned? did I ever conceal any thing from you?”  Fear, a fear vague still, and unexplained, was slowly taking possession of the guests; and they remained motionless, their forks in suspense, holding their breath.  “Never,” M. Favoral was repeating, stamping his foot so violently that the partition shook,--“never, never!”  “And yet it must be,” declared M. de Thaller.  “It is the only, the last resource.”  “And suppose I will not!”  “Your will has nothing to do with it now.  It is twenty years ago that you might have willed, or not willed.  But listen to me, and let us reason a little.”  Here M. de Thaller dropped his voice; and for some minutes nothing was heard in the dining-room, except confused words, and incomprehensible exclamations, until suddenly,  “That is ruin,” he resumed in a furious tone: “it is bankruptcy on the last of the month.”  “Sir,” the cashier was replying,--“sir!”  “You are a forger, M. Vincent Favoral; you are a thief!”  Maxence leaped from his seat.  “I shall not permit my father to be thus insulted in his own house,”  he exclaimed.  “Maxence,” begged Mme. Favoral, “my son!”  The old lawyer, M. Chapelain, held him by the arm; but he struggled hard, and was about to burst into the parlor, when the door opened, and the director of the Mutual Credit stepped out.  With a coolness quite remarkable after such a scene, he advanced towards Mlle. Gilberte, and, in a tone of offensive protection,  “Your father is a wretch, mademoiselle,” he said; “and my duty should be to surrender him at once into the hands of justice.  On account of your worthy mother, however, of your father himself, above all, on your own account, mademoiselle, I shall forbear doing so.  But let him fly, let him disappear, and never more be heard from.”  He drew from his pocket a roll of bank-notes, and, throwing them upon the table,  “Hand him this,” he added.  “Let him leave this very night.  The police may have been notified.  There is a train for Brussels at five minutes past eleven.”  And, having bowed, he withdrew, no one addressing him a single word, so great was the astonishment of all the guests of this house, heretofore so peaceful.  Overcome with stupor, Maxence had dropped upon his chair.  Mlle. Gilberte alone retained some presence of mind.  “It is a shame,” she exclaimed, “for us to give up thus!  That man is an impostor, a wretch; he lies!  Father, father!”  M. Favoral had not waited to be called, and was standing up against the parlor-door, pale as death, and yet calm.  “Why attempt any explanations?” he said.  “The money is gone; and appearances are against me.”  His wife had drawn near to him, and taken his hand.  “The misfortune is immense,” she said, “but not irreparable.  We will sell everything we have.”  “Have you not friends?  Are we not here,” insisted the others,--M. Desclavettes, M. Desormeaux, and M. Chapelain.  Gently he pushed his wife aside, and coldly.  “All we had,” he said, “would be as a grain of sand in an ocean. But we have no longer anything; we are ruined.”  “Ruined!” exclaimed M. Desormeaux,--“ruined!  And where are the forty-five thousand francs I placed into your hands?”  He made no reply.  “And our hundred and twenty thousand francs?” groaned M. and Mme. Desclavettes.  “And my sixty thousand francs?” shouted M. Chapelain, with a blasphemous oath.  The cashier shrugged his shoulders.  “Lost,” he said, “irrevocably lost!”  Then their rage exceeded all bounds.  Then they forgot that this unfortunate man had been their friend for twenty years, that they were his guests; and they commenced heaping upon him threats and insults without name.  He did not even deign to defend himself.  “Go on,” he uttered, “go on.  When a poor dog, carried away by the current, is drowning, men of heart cast stones at him from the bank. Go on!”  “You should have told us that you speculated,” screamed M. Desclavettes.  On hearing these words, he straightened himself up, and with a gesture so terrible that the others stepped back frightened.  “What!” said he, in a tone of crushing irony, “it is this evening only, that you discover that I speculated?  Kind friends!  Where, then, and in whose pockets, did you suppose I was getting the enormous interests I have been paying you for years?  Where have you ever seen honest money, the money of labor, yield twelve or fourteen per cent?  The money that yields thus is the money of the gaming table, the money of the bourse.  Why did you bring me your funds?  Because you were fully satisfied that I knew how to handle the cards.  Ah!  If I was to tell you that I had doubled your capital, you would not ask how I did it, nor whether I had stocked the cards. You would virtuously pocket the money.  But I have lost: I am a thief.  Well, so be it.  But, then, you are all my accomplices.  It is the avidity of the dupes which induces the trickery of the sharpers.”  Here he was interrupted by the servant coming in.  “Sir,” she exclaimed excitedly, “O sir! the courtyard is full of police agents. They are speaking to the concierge.  They are coming up stairs: I hear them!”    III  According to the time and place where they are uttered, there are words which acquire a terrible significance.  In this disordered room, in the midst of these excited people, that word, the “police,”  sounded like a thunderclap.  “Do not open,” Maxence ordered; “do not open, however they may ring or knock.  Let them burst the door first.”  The very excess of her fright restored to Mme. Favoral a portion of her energy.  Throwing herself before her husband as if to protect him, as if to defend him,  “They are coming to arrest you, Vincent,” she exclaimed.  “They are coming; don’t you hear them?”  He remained motionless, his feet seemingly riveted to the floor.  “That is as I expected,” he said.  And with the accent of the wretch who sees all hope vanish, and who utterly gives up all struggle,  “Be it so,” he said.  “Let them arrest me, and let all be over at once. I have had enough anxiety, enough unbearable alternatives.  I am tired always to feign, to deceive, and to lie.  Let them arrest me!  Any misfortune will be smaller in reality than the horrors of uncertainty. I have nothing more to fear now.  For the first time in many years I shall sleep to-night.”  He did not notice the sinister expression of his guests.  “You think I am a thief,” he added: “well, be satisfied, justice shall be done.”  But he attributed to them sentiments which were no longer theirs. They had forgotten their anger, and their bitter resentment for their lost money.  The imminence of the peril awoke suddenly in their souls the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1748"],["title","Other People's Money (#2)"],["body"," of the past, and that strong affection which comes from long habit, and a constant exchange of services rendered.  Whatever M. Favoral might have done, they only saw in him now the friend, the host whose bread they had broken together more than a hundred times, the man whose probity, up to this fatal night, had remained far above suspicion.  Pale, excited, they crowded around him.  “Have you lost your mind?” spoke M. Desormeaux.  “Are you going to wait to be arrested, thrown into prison, dragged into a criminal court?”  He shook his head, and in a tone of idiotic obstinacy,  “Have I not told you,” he repeated, “that every thing is against me? Let them come; let them do what they please with me.”  “And your wife,” insisted M. Chapelain, the old lawyer, “and your children!”  “Will they be any the less dishonored if I am condemned by default?”  Wild with grief, Mme. Favoral was wringing her hands.  “Vincent,” she murmured, “in the name of Heaven spare us the harrowing agony to have you in prison.”  Obstinately he remained silent.  His daughter, Mlle. Gilberte, dropped upon her knees before him, and, joining her hands:  “I beseech you, father,” she begged.  He shuddered all over.  An unspeakable expression of suffering and anguish contracted his features; and, speaking in a scarcely intelligible voice:  “Ah! you are cruelly protracting my agony,” he stammered.  “What do you ask of me?”  “You must fly,” declared M. Desclavettes.  “Which way?  How?  Do you not think that every precaution has been taken, that every issue is closely watched?”  Maxence interrupted him with a gesture:  “The windows in sister’s room, father,” said he, “open upon the courtyard of the adjoining house.”  “Yes; but here we are up two pairs of stairs.”  “No matter: I have a way.”  And turning towards his sister:  “Come, Gilberte,” went on the young man, “give me a light, and let me have some sheets.”  They went out hurriedly.  Mme. Favoral felt a gleam of hope.  “We are saved!” she said.  “Saved!” repeated the cashier mechanically.  “Yes; for I guess Maxence’s idea.  But we must have an understanding.  Where will you take refuge?”  “How can I tell?”  “There is a train at five minutes past eleven,” remarked M. Desormeaux.  “Don’t let us forget that.”  “But money will be required to leave by that train,” interrupted the old lawyer.  “Fortunately, I have some.”  And, forgetting his hundred and sixty thousand francs lost, he took out his pocket-book.  Mme. Favoral stopped him.  “We have more than we need,” said she.  She took from the table, and held out to her husband, the roll of bank notes which the director of the Mutual Credit Society had thrown down before going.  He refused them with a gesture of rage.  “Rather starve to death!” he exclaimed.  “‘Tis he, ‘tis that wretch--”  But he interrupted himself, and more gently:  “Put away those bank-bills,” said he to his wife, “and let Maxence take them back to M. de Thaller to-morrow.”  The bell rang violently.  “The police!” groaned Mme. Desclavettes, who seemed on the point of fainting away.  “I am going to negotiate,” said M. Desormeaux.  “Fly, Vincent: do not lose a minute.”  And he ran to the front-door, whilst Mme. Favoral was hurrying her husband towards Mlle. Gilberte’s room.  Rapidly and stoutly Maxence had fastened four sheets together by the ends, which gave a more than sufficient length.  Then, opening the window, he examined carefully the courtyard of the adjoining house.  “No one,” said he: “everybody is at dinner.  We’ll succeed.”  M. Favoral was tottering like a drunken man.  A terrible emotion convulsed his features.  Casting a long look upon his wife and children:  “O Lord!” he murmured, “what will become of you?”  “Fear nothing, father,” uttered Maxence.  “I am here.  Neither my mother nor my sister will want for any thing.”  “My son!” resumed the cashier, “my children!”  Then, with a choking voice:  “I am worthy neither of your love nor your devotion, wretch that I am!  I made you lead a miserable existence, spend a joyless youth. I imposed upon you every trial of poverty, whilst I--And now I leave you nothing but ruin and a dishonored name.”  “Make haste, father,” interrupted Mlle. Gilberte.  It seemed as if he could not make up his mind.  “It is horrible to abandon you thus.  What a parting!  Ah! death would indeed be far preferable.  What will you think of me?  I am very guilty, certainly, but not as you think.  I have been betrayed, and I must suffer for all.  If at least you knew the whole truth. But will you ever know it?  We will never see each other again.”  Desperately his wife clung to him.  “Do not speak thus,” she said.  “Wherever you may find an asylum, I will join you.  Death alone can separate us.  What do I care what you may have done, or what the world will say?  I am your wife.  Our children will come with me.  If necessary, we will emigrate to America; we’ll change our name; we will work.”  The knocks on the outer door were becoming louder and louder; and M. Desormeaux’ voice could be heard, endeavoring to gain a few moments more.  “Come,” said Maxence, “you cannot hesitate any longer.”  And, overcoming his father’s reluctance, he fastened one end of the sheets around his waist.  “I am going to let you down, father,” said he; “and, as soon as you touch the ground, you must undo the knot.  Take care of the first-story windows; beware of the concierge; and, once in the street, don’t walk too fast.  Make for the Boulevard, where you will be sooner lost in the crowd.”  The knocks had now become violent blows; and it was evident that the door would soon be broken in, if M. Desormeaux did not make up his mind to open it.  The light was put out.  With the assistance of his daughter, M. Favoral lifted himself upon the window-sill, whilst Maxence held the sheets with both hands.  “I beseech you, Vincent,” repeated Mme. Favoral, “write to us.  We shall be in mortal anxiety until we hear of your safety.”  Maxence let the sheets slip slowly: in two seconds M. Favoral stood on the pavement below.  “All right,” he said.  The young man drew the sheets back rapidly, and threw them under the bed.  But Mlle. Gilberte remained long enough at the window to recognize her father’s voice asking the concierge to open the door, and to hear the heavy gate of the adjoining house closing behind him.  “Saved!” she said.  It was none too soon.  M. Desormeaux had just been compelled to yield; and the commissary of police was walking in.    IV  The commissaries of police of Paris, as a general thing, are no simpletons; and, if they are ever taken in, it is because it has suited them to be taken in.  Their modest title covers the most important, perhaps, of magistracies, almost the only one known to the lower classes; an enormous power, and an influence so decisive, that the most sensible statesman of the reign of Louis Philippe ventured once to say, “Give me twenty good commissaries of police in Paris, and I’ll undertake to suppress any government: net profit, one hundred millions.”  Parisian above all, the commissary has had ample time to study his ground when he was yet only a peace-officer.  The dark side of the most brilliant lives has no mysteries for him.  He has received the strangest confidences: he has listened to the most astounding confessions.  He knows how low humanity can stoop, and what aberrations there are in brains apparently the soundest.  The work woman whom her husband beats, and the great lady whom her husband cheats, have both come to him.  He has been sent for by the shop-keeper whom his wife deceives, and by the millionaire who has been blackmailed.  To his office, as to a lay confessional, all passions fatally lead.  In his presence the dirty linen of two millions of people is washed _en famille_.  A Paris commissary of police, who after ten years’ practice, could retain an illusion, believe in something, or be astonished at any thing in the world, would be but a fool.  If he is still capable of some emotion, he is a good man.  The one who had just walked into M. Favoral’s apartment was already past middle age, colder than ice, and yet kindly, but of that commonplace kindliness which frightens like the executioner’s politeness at the scaffold.  He required but a single glance of his small but clear eyes to decipher the physiognomies of all these worthy people standing around the disordered table.  And beckoning to the agents who accompanied him to stop at the door,--“Monsieur Vincent Favoral?”  he inquired.  The cashier’s guests, M. Desormeaux excepted, seemed stricken with stupor.  Each one felt as if he had a share of the disgrace of this police invasion.  The dupes who are sometimes caught in clandestine “hells” have the same humiliated attitudes.  At last, and not without an effort,  “M. Favoral is no longer here,” replied M. Chapelain, the old lawyer.  The commissary of police started.  Whilst they were discussing with him through the door, he had perfectly well understood that they were only trying to gain time; and, if he had not at once burst in the door, it was solely owing to his respect for M. Desormeaux himself, whom he knew personally, and still more for his title of head clerk at the Department of Justice.  But his suspicions did not extend beyond the destruction of a few compromising papers. Whereas, in fact:  “You have helped M. Favoral to escape, gentlemen?” said he.  No one replied.  “Silence means assent,” he added.  “Very well: which way did he get off?”  Still no answer.  M. Desclavettes would have been glad to add something to the forty-five thousand francs he had just lost, to be, together with Mme. Desclavettes, a hundred miles away.  “Where is Mme. Favoral?” resumed the commissary, evidently well informed. “Where are Mlle. Gilberte and M. Maxence Favoral?”  They continued silent.  No one in the dining-room knew what might have taken place in the other room; and a single word might be treason.  The commissary then became impatient.  “Take "]]]
