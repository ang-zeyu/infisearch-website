A sheet of _horn_ is placed over the whole of the exterior cover, to protect it from injury. This binding is uncommon, but I should apprehend it to be not earlier than the very commencement of the xvth century.  I have not yet travelled out of the twelfth century; and mean to give you some account of rather a splendid and precious MS. entitled _Vitæ Sanctorum_--supposed to be of the same period. It is said to have been executed under the auspices of the _Emperor Conrad,_ who was chosen in 1169 and died in 1193. It is an elegant folio volume. The illuminations are in outline; in red, brown, or blue--firmly and truly touched, with very fanciful inventions in the forms of the capital letters. The initial letter prefixed to the account of the _Assumption of the Virgin_, is abundantly clever and whimsical; while that prefixed to the Life of _St. Aurelius_ has even an imposing air of magnificence, and is the most important in the volume.  Here is a curious _History of the Bible, in German verse_, as I learn, by Rudolph, Count of Hohen Embs. Whether \"curious\" or not, I cannot tell; but I can affirm that, since opening the famous MS. of the Roman d'Alexandre,[12] at Oxford, I have not met with a finer, or more genuine MS. than the present. It is a noble folio volume; highly, although in many places coarsely, adorned. The text is executed in a square, stiff, German letter, in double columns; and the work was written (as M. Le Bret informed me, and as warranted by the contents) \"in obedience to the orders of the Emperor Conrad, son of the Emperor Frederick II: the greater part of it being composed after the chronicle of Geoffrey de Viterbe.\" To specify the illuminations would be an endless task. At the end of the MS. are the following colophonic verses:    _Uf den fridag was sts Brictius   Do nam diz buch ende alsus   Nach godis geburten dusint jar   Dar su ccc dni vnx achtzig als eyn har_.  the \"_ccc_\" are interlined, in red ink: but the whole inscription implies that the book was finished in 1381, on Friday, the day of St. Brictius. It follows therefore that it could not have been written during the life-time of Conrad IV. who was elected Emperor in 1250. This interesting MS. is in a most desirable condition.  There are two or three _Missals_ deserving only of brief notice. One, of the XIVth century, is executed in large gothic letter; having an exceedingly vivid and fresh illumination of a crucifixion, but in bad taste, opposite the well-known passage of \"Te igitur clementissime,\" &c. It is bound in red satin. Two missals of the xvth century--of which one presents only a few interesting prints connected with art. It is ornamented in a sort of bistre outline, preparatory to colouring--of which numerous examples may be seen in the Breviary of the Duke of Bedford in the Royal Library at Paris.[13] I examined half a dozen more Missals, which the kind activity of M. Le Bret had placed before me, and among them found nothing deserving of particular observation,--except a thick, short, octavo volume, in the German language, with characteristic and rather clever embellishments; especially in the borders.  There is a folio volume entitled \"_La Vie, Mort, et Miracles de St. Jerome_.\" The first large illumination, which is prettily composed, is unluckily much injured in some parts. It represents the author kneeling, with his cap in his right hand, and a book bound in black, with gold clasps and knobs, in the other. A lady appears to receive this presentation-volume very graciously; but unfortunately her countenance is obliterated. Two female attendants are behind her: the whole, gracefully composed. I take this MS. to be of the end of the xvth. century. There is a most desirable MS. of the _Roman de la Rose_--of the end of the xivth century; in double columns; with some of the illuminations, about two inches square, very sweet and interesting. That, on the recto of folio xiiij, is quite charming. The \"testament\" of the author, J. de Meun, follows; quietly decorated, within flowered borders. The last illumination but one, of our Saviour, sitting upon a rainbow is very singular. This MS. is in its old binding of wood.  A few _miscellaneous articles_ may be here briefly noticed. First: a German metrical version of the Game of Chess, moralized, called _Der Schachzabel._ This is an extraordinary, and highly illuminated MS. upon paper; written in a sort of secretary gothic hand, in short rhyming verse, as I conceive about the year 1400, or 1450. The embellishments are large and droll, and in several of them we distinguish that thick, and shining, but cracked coat of paint which is upon the old print of St. Bridget, in Lord Spencer's collection.[14] Among the more striking illuminations is the _Knight_ on horseback, in silver armour, about nine inches high--a fine showy fellow! His horse has silver plates over his head. Many of the pieces in the game are represented in a highly interesting manner, and the whole is invaluable to the antiquary. This MS. is in boards. Second: a German version of _Maundeville_, of the date of 1471, with curious, large, and grotesque illuminations, of the coarsest execution. It is written in double columns, in a secretary gothic hand, upon paper. The heads of the Polypheme tribe are ludicrously horrible. Third:--_Herren Duke of Brunswick_, or the _Chevalier au Lion_,--a MS. relating to this hero, of the date of 1470. A lion accompanies him every where. Among the embellishments, there is a good one of this animal leaping upon a tomb and licking it--as containing the mortal remains of his master. Fourth: a series of German stanzas, sung by birds, each bird being represented, in outline, before the stanza appropriated to it. In the whole, only three leaves.  The \"last and not least\" of the MSS. which I deem it worthy to mention, is an highly illuminated one of _St. Austin upon the Psalms_. This was the _first_ book which I remembered to have seen, upon the continent, from the library of the famous _Corvinus King of Hungary,_ about which certain pages have discoursed largely. It was also an absolutely beautiful book: exhibiting one of the finest specimens of art of the latter end of the XVth century. The commentary of the Saint begins on the recto of the second leaf, within such a rich, lovely, and exquisitely executed border--as almost made me forget the embellishments in the _Sforziada_ in the Royal Library of France.[15] The border in question is a union of pearls and arabesque ornaments quite standing out of the background ... which latter has the effect of velvet. The arms, below, are within a double border of pearls, each pair of pearls being within a gold circle upon an ultramarine ground. The heads and figures have not escaped injury, but other portions of this magical illumination have been rubbed or partly obliterated.  A ms. note, prefixed by M. Le Bret, informs us, in the opinion of its writer, that this illumination was the work of one \"_Actavantes de Actavantibus of Florence_,--who lived towards the end of the XVth century,\" and who really seems to have done a great deal for Corvinus. The initial letters, throughout this volume, delicately cross-barred in gold, with little flowers and arabesques, &c. precisely resemble those in the MS. of Mr. Hibbert.[16] Such a white, snowy page, as the one just in part described, can scarcely be imagined by the uninitiated in ancient illuminated MSS. The binding, in boards covered with leather, has the original ornaments, of the time of Corvinus, which are now much faded. The fore-edges of the leaves preserve their former gilt-stamped ornaments. Upon the whole--an ALMOST MATCHLESS book!  Such, my good friend, are the treasures, both in MS. and in print, which a couple of morning's application, in the Public Library of Stuttgart, have enabled me to bring forward for your notice. A word or two, now, for the treasures of the ROYAL LIBRARY, and then for a little respite. The Library of his Majesty is in one of the side wings, or rather appurtenances, of the Palace: to the right, on looking at the front. It is on the first floor--where _all_ libraries should be placed--and consists of a circular and a parallelogram-shaped room: divided by a screen of Ionic pillars. A similar screen is also at the further end of the latter room. The circular apartment has a very elegant appearance, and contains some beautiful books chiefly of modern art. A round table is in the centre, covered with fine cloth, and the sides and pillars of the screen are painted wholly in white--as well as the room connected with it. A gallery goes along the latter, or parallelogram-shaped apartment; and there are, in the centre, two rows of book-cases, very tall, and completely filled with books. These, as well as the book-cases along the sides, are painted white. An elaborately painted ceiling, chiefly composed of human figures, forms the graphic ornament of the long library; but, unluckily, the central book-cases are so high as to cover a great portion of the painting--viewed almost in any direction. At the further end of the long library, facing the circular extremity, is a bust of the late King of Würtemberg, by Dannecker. It bears so strong a resemblance to that of our own venerable monarch, that I had considered it to be a representation of him--out of compliment to the Dowager Queen of Würtemberg, his daughter. The ceiling of this Library is undoubtedly too low for its length. But the circular extremity has something in it exceedingly attractive, and inviting to study.  In noticing some of the contents of this Library, I shall correct the error committed in the account of the Public Library, by commencing here with the MANUSCRIPTS in preference to the Printed Books. The MSS. are by no means numerous, and are perhaps rather curious than intrinsically valuable. I shall begin with an account of a _Prayer-"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17624"],["title","A Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France and Germany, (#5)"],["body","Book, or Psalter,_ in a quarto form, undoubtedly of the latter end of the XIIth century. Its state of preservation, both for illumination and scription, is quite exquisite. It appears to have been expressly executed for Herman, and Sophia his wife, King and Queen of Hungary and Bohemia--who lived at the latter end of the twelfth century. The names of these royal patrons and owners of, the volume are introduced at the end of the volume, in a sort of litany: accompanied with embellishments of the Mother of Christ, Saints and Martyrs, &c.: as thus: \"_Sophia Regina Vngariæ, Regina Bohemiæ_\"--\"_Herman Lantgrauius Turingie, Rex Vngariæ, Rex Bohemiæ_.\" In the Litany, we read (of the _latter_) in the address to the Deity, \"_Vt famulu tuu_ HERMANNV _in tua misericordia confidente, confortare et regere dignter:_\" so that there is no doubt about the age of the MS. In the representations of the episcopal dresses, the tops of the mitres are depressed--another confirmation of the date of the book.  The initial letters, and especially the B before the Psalms, are at once elegant and elaborate. Among the subjects described, the _Descent into Hell_, or rather the Place of Torment, is singularly striking and extraordinary. The text of the MS. is written in a large bold gothic letter. This volume has been recently bound in red morocco, and cruelly cut in the binding.  Of course, here are some specimens of illuminated _Hours_, both in manuscript and print. In the former, I must make you acquainted with a truly beautiful volume; upon the fly leaf of which we read as follows: \"I 3 F, RT, lo _Fortitudo Eius Rhodum tenuit Amadeus Graff^{9} Sauoia_.\" Below, \"_Biblioth: Sem: Mergenth_:\" then, a long German note, of which I understood not one word, and as M. Le Bret was not near me, I could not obtain the solution of it. But although I do not understand one word of this note, I do understand that this is one of the very prettiest, and most singularly illuminated Missals, which any library can possess: broad margins: vellum, white as snow in colour, and soft as that of Venice in touch! The text is written in a tall, close, gothic character--between, as I should conceive, the years 1460 and 1480. The _drolleries_ are delightfully introduced and executed. The initial letters are large and singular; the subject being executed within compartments of gothic architecture. The figures, of which these subjects are composed, are very small; generally darkly shaded, and highly relieved. They are numerous. Of these initial letters, the fifth to the ninth, inclusively, are striking: the sixth being the most curious, and the ninth the most elaborate. The binding of this volume seems to be of the sixteenth century. This is as it should be.  But, more precious than either, or than both, or than three times as many of the preceding illuminated volumes--in the estimation of our friend * * * would be a MS. of which the title runs thus: \"_Libri Duo de Vita_ S. WILLIBROORDI _Archiepiscopi autore humili de vita_ ALCUINI _cum prefat. ad Beonradum Archiepiscopum. Liber secundus metrice scriptus est_.\"[17] Then an old inscription, thus: \"_Althwinus de vita Willibrordi Epi_.\" There can be no doubt of this MS. being at least as old as the eleventh century.  The PRINTED BOOKS--at least the account of such as seemed to demand a more particular examination, will not occupy a very great share of your attention. I will begin with a pretty little VELLUM COPY of the well-known _Hortulus Animæ_, of the date of 1498, in 12mo., printed by _Wilhelmus Schaffener de Ropperswiler,_ at _Strasbourg_. The vellum is excellent; and the wood cuts, rather plentifully sprinkled through the volume, happen fortunately to be well-coloured. This copy appears to have come from the \"_Weingarth Monastery\"_, with the date of 1617 upon it--as that of its having been then purchased for the monastery. It is in its original wooden binding: wanting repair. Here are a few _Roman Classics_, which are more choice than those in the Public Library: as _Reisinger's Suetonius_, in 4to. but cropt, and half bound in red morocco, with yellow sprinkled edges to the leaves--a woful specimen of the general style of binding in this library. _Lucretius_, 1486: _Manilius_, 1474: both in one volume, bound in wood--and sound and desirable copies. _Eutropius_, 1471; by Laver; a sound, desirable copy, in genuine condition. Of _Bibles_, here is the Greek Aldine folio of 1518, in frightful half binding, cropt to the quick: also an Hungarian impression of the two Books of Samuel and of Kings, of 1565, in folio--beginning: AZ KET SAMVEL: colophon: _Debreczenbe_, &c. MDLXV: in wretched half binding. The small paper of the _Latin Bibles_ of 1592, 1603. And of _Greek Testaments_ here are the first, second, fourth and fifth editions of Erasmus; the first, containing both parts, is in one volume, in original boards, or binding; a sound and clean copy: written upon, but not in a _very_ unpicturesque manner. The second edition is but an indifferent copy.  The following may be considered _Miscellaneous Articles._ I will begin with the earliest. _St. Austin de Singularitate Clericorum_, printed in a small quarto volume by _Ulric Zel_, in 1467: a good, sound, but cropt copy, along with some opuscula of _Gerson_ and _Chrysostom_, also printed by Zel: these, from the Schönthal monastery. At the end of this dull collection of old theology, are a few ms. opuscula, and among them one of the _Gesta Romanorum:_ I should think of the fourteenth century. The _Wurtzburg Synod_, supposed to be printed by Reyser, towards the end of the fifteenth century; and of which there is a copy in the Public Library, as well as another in that of Strasbourg. To the antiquary, this may be a curious book. I mention it again,[18] in order to notice the name and seal of \"Iohannes Fabri,--clericus Maguntin diocesz publicus imperiali auctoritate notarius, &c. Scriba iuratus\"--which occur at about one fourth part of the work: as I am desirous of knowing whether this man be the same, or related to the, printer so called, who published the _Ethics of Cato_ in 1477?--of which book I omitted to mention a copy in the Public Library here.[19] Bound up with this volume is Fyner's edition of _P. Niger contra perfidos Iudæos_, 1475, folio. Fyner lived at Eislingen, in the neighbourhood of this place, and it is natural to find specimens of his press here. The _Stella Meschiah_ of 1477, is here cruelly cropt, and bound in the usually barbarous manner, with a mustard-coloured sprinkling upon the edges of the leaves. _Historie von der Melusina:_ a singular volume, in the German language, printed without date, in a thin folio. It is a book perfectly _à la_ Douce; full of whimsical and interesting wood cuts, which I do not remember to have seen in any other ancient volume. From the conclusion of the text, it appears to have been composed or finished in 1446, but I suspect the date of its typographical execution to be that of 1480 at the earliest.  I looked about sharply for fine, old, mellow-tinted _Alduses:_--but to no purpose. Yet I must notice a pretty little Aldine _Petrarch_ of 1521, 12mo. bound with _Sannazarius de partu Virginis_, by the same printer, in 1527, 12mo.: in old stamped binding--but somewhat cropt. The leaves of both copies crackle lustily on turning them over. These, also, from the Weingarth monastery. I noticed a beautiful little Petrarch of 1546, 8vo. with the commentary of Velutellus; having a striking device of Neptune in the frontispiece: but no _membranaceous_ articles, of this character and period, came across my survey.  I cannot, however, take leave of the Royal Library (a collection which I should think must contain 15,000 volumes) without expressing my obligations for the unrestricted privilege of examination afforded me by those who had the superintendance of it. But I begin to be wearied, and it is growing late. The account of the \"court-levee,\" and the winding up of other Stuttgart matters, must be reserved for to-morrow. The watchman has just commenced his rounds, by announcing, as usual, the hour of _ten_--which announce is succeeded by a long (and as I learn _metrical_) exhortation--for the good folks of Stuttgart to take care of their fires and candles. I obey his injunctions; and say good night.   [1] See vol. ii. p. 421.  [2] [Of this PORTRAIT, which may be truly said to enrich the pages of the     previous edition of the Tour, a more _liberal_ use has been made     than I was prepared to grant. My worthy friends, Messrs. Treuttel,     Würtz, and Richter were welcome to its republication; but a _third     edition_ of it, by another hand, ought not to have been published     without permission. The ORIGINAL of this Portrait has ceased to exist.     After a laborious life of fourscore years, the learned Schweighæuser     has departed--in the fullest maturity of reputation arising from     classical attainments; to which must be added, all the excellences of     a mild, affable, christian-like disposition. As a husband, a father,     and a friend, none went before him: no one displayed these domestic     virtues in a more perfect and more pleasing form. As a Greek Scholar     and Commentator, he may be said to rank with Hemsterhusius,     Wyttenbach, and Heyne. He was equally the boast of Strasbourg and the     glory of his age. Never was profound learning more successfully united     with \"singleness of heart,\" and general simplicity of character. He     ought to have a splendid monument (if he have it not already?) among     his Fellow Worthies in the church of St. Thomas at Strasbourg. PEACE     TO HIS ASHES!]  [3] For the first time, my bill (which I invariably called for, and     settled, every day) was presented to me in a printed form, in the     _black letter_, within an ornamented border.
