I never doubted that you were ...\"  \"In the wooden chest!\" concluded Smith grimly, \"Look!\"  He pointed to something that lay behind me. I turned, and saw the box which had occasioned me such anguish. The top had been wrenched off and the contents exposed to view. It was filled with a variety of gold ornaments, cups, vases, silks, and barbaric brocaded raiment; it might well have contained the loot of a cathedral. Inspector Weymouth laughed gruffly at my surprise.  \"What is it?\" I asked, in a voice of amazement.  \"It's the treasure of the Si-Fan, I presume,\" rapped Smith. \"Where it has come from and where it was going to, it must be my immediate business to ascertain.\"  \"Then you ...\"  \"I was lying, bound and gagged, upon one of the upper shelves in the opium-den! I heard you and Fletcher arrive. I saw you pass through later with that she-devil who drove the cab to-day ...\"  \"Then the cab ...\"  \"The windows were fastened, unopenable, and some anaesthetic was injected into the interior through a tube--that speaking-tube. I know nothing further, except that our plans must have leaked out in some mysterious fashion. Petrie, my suspicions point to high quarters. The Si-Fan score thus far, for unless the search now in progress brings it to light, we must conclude that they have the brass coffer.\"  He was interrupted by a sudden loud crying of his name.  \"Mr. Nayland Smith!\" came from somewhere within the Joy-Shop. \"This way, sir!\"  Off he went, in his quick, impetuous manner, whilst I stood there, none too steadily, wondering what discovery this outcry portended. I had not long to wait. Out by the low doorway come Smith, a grimly triumphant smile upon his face, carrying the missing brass coffer!  He set it down upon the planking before me.  \"John Ki,\" he said, \"who was also on the missing list, had dragged the thing out of the cellar where it was hidden, and in another minute must have slipped away with it. Detective Deacon saw the light shining through a crack in the floor. I shall never forget the look John gave us when we came upon him, as, lamp in hand, he bent over the precious chest.\"  \"Shall you open it now?\"  \"No.\" He glanced at me oddly. \"I shall have it valued in the morning by Messrs. Meyerstein.\"  He was keeping something back; I was sure of it.  \"Smith,\" I said suddenly, \"the man with the limp! I heard him in the place where you were confined! Did you ...\"  Nayland Smith clicked his teeth together sharply, looking straightly and grimly into my eyes.  \"I _saw_ him!\" he replied slowly; \"and unless the effects of the anaesthetic had not wholly worn off ...\"  \"Well!\" I cried.  \"The man with the limp is _Dr. Fu-Manchu!_\"    CHAPTER X  THE TÛLUN-NÛR CHEST   \"This box,\" said Mr. Meyerstein, bending attentively over the carven brass coffer upon the table, \"is certainly of considerable value, and possibly almost unique.\"  Nayland Smith glanced across at me with a slight smile. Mr. Meyerstein ran one fat finger tenderly across the heavily embossed figures, which, like barnacles, encrusted the sides and lid of the weird curio which we had summoned him to appraise.  \"What do you think, Lewison?\" he added, glancing over his shoulder at the clerk who accompanied him.  Lewison, whose flaxen hair and light blue eyes almost served to mask his Semitic origin, shrugged his shoulders in a fashion incongruous in one of his complexion, though characteristic in one of his name.  \"It is as you say, Mr. Meyerstein, an example of early Tûlun-Nûr work,\" he said. \"It may be sixteenth century or even earlier. The Kûren treasure-chest in the Hague Collection has points of similarity, but the workmanship of this specimen is infinitely finer.\"  \"In a word, gentlemen,\" snapped Nayland Smith, rising from the arm-chair in which he had been sitting, and beginning restlessly to pace the room, \"in a word, you would be prepared to make me a substantial offer for this box?\"  Mr. Meyerstein, his shrewd eyes twinkling behind the pebbles of his pince-nez, straightened himself slowly, turned in the ponderous manner of a fat man, and readjusted the pince-nez upon his nose. He cleared his throat.  \"I have not yet seen the interior of the box, Mr. Smith,\" he said.  Smith paused in his perambulation of the carpet and stared hard at the celebrated art dealer.  \"Unfortunately,\" he replied, \"the key is missing.\"  \"Ah!\" cried the assistant, Lewison, excitedly, \"you are mistaken, sir! Coffers of this description and workmanship are nearly always complicated conjuring tricks; they rarely open by any such rational means as lock and key. For instance, the Kûren treasure-chest to which I referred, opens by an intricate process involving the pressing of certain knobs in the design, and the turning of others.\"  \"It was ultimately opened,\" said Mr. Meyerstein, with a faint note of professional envy in his voice, \"by one of Christie's experts.\"  \"Does my memory mislead me,\" I interrupted, \"or was it not regarding the possession of the chest to which you refer, that the celebrated case of 'Hague versus Jacobs' arose?\"  \"You are quite right, Dr. Petrie,\" said Meyerstein, turning to me. \"The original owner, a member of the Younghusband Expedition, had been unable to open the chest. When opened at Christie's it proved to contain jewels and other valuables. It was a curious case, wasn't it, Lewison?\" turning to his clerk.  \"Very,\" agreed the other absently; then--\"Have you endeavored to open this box, Mr. Smith?\"  Nayland Smith shook his head grimly.  \"From its weight,\" said Meyerstein, \"I am inclined to think that the contents might prove of interest. With your permission I will endeavor to open it.\"  Nayland Smith, tugging reflectively at the lobe of his left ear, stood looking at the expert. Then--  \"I do not care to attempt it at present,\" he said.  Meyerstein and his clerk stared at the speaker in surprise.  \"But you would be mad,\" cried the former, \"if you accepted an offer for the box, whilst ignorant of the nature of its contents.\"  \"But I have invited no offer,\" said Smith. \"I do not propose to sell.\"  Meyerstein adjusted his pince-nez again.  \"I am a business man,\" he said, \"and I will make a business proposal: A hundred guineas for the box, cash down, and our commission to be ten per cent on the proceeds of the contents. You must remember,\" raising a fat forefinger to check Smith, who was about to interrupt him, \"that it may be necessary to force the box in order to open it, thereby decreasing its market value and making it a bad bargain at a hundred guineas.\"  Nayland Smith met my gaze across the room; again a slight smile crossed the lean, tanned face.  \"I can only reply, Mr. Meyerstein,\" he said, \"in this way: if I desire to place the box on the market, you shall have first refusal, and the same applies to the contents, if any. For the moment if you will send me a note of your fee, I shall be obliged.\" He raised his hand with a conclusive gesture. \"I am not prepared to discuss the question of sale any further at present, Mr. Meyerstein.\"  At that the dealer bowed, took up his hat from the table, and prepared to depart. Lewison opened the door and stood aside.  \"Good morning, gentlemen,\" said Meyerstein.  As Lewison was about to follow him--  \"Since you do not intend to open the box,\" he said, turning, his hand upon the door knob, \"have you any idea of its contents?\"  \"None,\" replied Smith; \"but with my present inadequate knowledge of its history, I do not care to open it.\"  Lewison smiled skeptically.  \"Probably you know best,\" he said, bowed to us both, and retired.  When the door was closed--  \"You see, Petrie,\" said Smith, beginning to stuff tobacco into his briar, \"if we are ever short of funds, here's something\"--pointing to the Tûlun-Nûr box upon the table--\"which would retrieve our fallen fortunes.\"  He uttered one of his rare, boyish laughs, and began to pace the carpet again, his gaze always set upon our strange treasure. What did it contain?  The manner in which it had come into our possession suggested that it might contain something of the utmost value to the Yellow group. For we knew the house of John Ki to be, if not the head-quarters, certainly a meeting-place of the mysterious organization the Si-Fan; we knew that Dr. Fu-Manchu used the place--Dr. Fu-Manchu, the uncanny being whose existence seemingly proved him immune from natural laws, a deathless incarnation of evil.  My gaze set upon the box, I wondered anew what strange, dark secrets it held; I wondered how many murders and crimes greater than murder blackened its history.  \"Smith,\" I said suddenly, \"now that the mystery of the absence of a key-hole is explained, I am sorely tempted to essay the task of opening the coffer. I think it might help us to a solution of the whole mystery.\"  \"And I think otherwise!\" interrupted my friend grimly. \"In a word, Petrie, I look upon this box as a sort of hostage by means of which-- who knows--we might one day buy our lives from the enemy. I have a sort of fancy, call it superstition if you will, that nothing--not even our miraculous good luck--could save us if once we ravished its secret.\"  I stared at him amazedly; this was a new phase in his character.  \"I am conscious of something almost like a spiritual unrest,\" he continued. \"Formerly you were endowed with a capacity for divining the presence of Fu-Manchu or his agents. Some such second-sight would appear to have visited me now, and it directs me forcibly to avoid opening the box.\"  His steps as he paced the floor grew more and more"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17966"],["title","Life History of the Kangaroo Rat (#0)"],["body","STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE  BULLETIN No. 1091  Also Technical Bulletin No. 1 of the Agricultural Experiment Station University of Arizona  Washington, D.

IMPORTANCE OF RODENT GROUPS.   As the serious character of the depredations by harmful rodents is recognized, State, Federal, and private expenditures for their control increase year by year. These depredations include not only the attacks by introduced rats and mice on food materials stored in granaries, warehouses, commercial establishments, docks, and private houses, but also, particularly in the Western States, the ravages of several groups of native ground squirrels and other noxious rodents in grain and certain other field crops. Nor is this all, for it has been found that such rodents as prairie dogs, pocket gophers, marmots, ground squirrels, and rabbits take appreciable and serious toll of the forage on the open grazing range; in fact, that they reduce the carrying capacity of the range to such an extent that expenditures for control measures are amply justified. Current estimates place the loss of goods due to rats and mice in warehouses and stores throughout the United States at no less than $200,000,000 annually, and damage to the carrying capacity of the open range and to cultivated crops generally by native rodents in the Western States at $300,000,000 additional; added together, we have an impressive total from depredations of rodents.  The distribution and life habits of rodents and the general consideration of their relation to agriculture, forestry, and grazing, with special reference to the carrying capacity of stock ranges, is a subject that has received attention for many years from the Biological Survey of the United States Department of Agriculture. As a result of the investigations conducted much has been learned concerning the economic status of most of the more important groups, and the knowledge already gained forms the basis of the extensive rodent-control work already in progress, and in which many States are cooperating with the bureau. If the work is to be prosecuted intelligently and the fullest measure of success achieved, it is essential that the consideration largely of groups as a whole be supplemented by more exhaustive treatment of the life histories of individual species and of their place in the biological complex. The present report is based upon investigations, chiefly in Arizona, of the life history, habits, and economic status of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat, _Dipodomys spectabilis spectabilis_ Merriam (Pl. I).   INVESTIGATIONAL METHODS.  Some 18 years ago (in 1903) a tract of land 49.2 square miles in area on the Coronado National Forest near the Santa Rita Mountains, Pima County, southern Arizona, was closed to grazing by arrangement between the Forest Service and the Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of Arizona. Since that time another small tract of nearly a section has been inclosed (Griffiths, 1910, 7[1]). This total area of approximately 50 square miles is known as the United States Range Reserve, and is being devoted to a study of grazing conditions in this section and to working out the best methods of administering the range (Pl. II, Fig. 1).  For some years an intensive study of the forage and other vegetative conditions of this area has been made, the permanent vegetation quadrat, as proposed by Dr. F. E. Clements (1905, 161-175), being largely utilized. During the autumn of 1917 representatives of the Carnegie Institution and the Arizona Agricultural Experiment Station visited the Reserve and were impressed with the evidence of rodent damage to the grass cover. The most conspicuous appearance of damage was noted about the habitations of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat (_Dipodomys spectabilis spectabilis_ Merriam), although it was observed also that jack rabbits of two species (_Lepus californicus eremicus_ Allen and _L. alleni alleni_ Mearns), which were very abundant in some portions of the reserve, were apparently affecting adversely the forage conditions in particular localities. Accordingly, the Biological Survey, the Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of Arizona, the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and the U. S. Forest Service have undertaken a study of the relation of the more important rodents to the forage crop of the Range Reserve in Arizona.  The present paper is a first step in this larger investigation.[2] In this work the authors have made no attempt to deal with the taxonomic side of the kangaroo rat problem. It is not unlikely that intensive studies will show that the form now known as _Dipodomys spectabilis spectabilis_ is made up of a number of local variants, some of them perhaps worthy of recognition as additional subspecies. But it is felt that the conclusions here reached will be little, if at all, affected by such developments.

There are only three groups of mammals in the Southwest having external cheek pouches. These are (_a_) the pocket gophers (Geomyidæ), which have strong fore feet, relatively weak hind feet, and short tail, as compared with weak fore feet, relatively strong hind feet, and long tail in the other two; (_b_) the pocket mice (_Perognathus_), which are considerably smaller than the kangaroo rats and lack the conspicuous white hip stripe possessed by all the latter; and (_c_) the kangaroo rats (_Dipodomys_).
