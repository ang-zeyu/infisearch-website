He had been so touched by Warde's thoughtless remark that he held himself aloof from Roy's hospitality. \"I only came up to tell you that the thunderstorm up the river did a lot of damage; a house was struck by lightning in North Bridgeboro and a lot of trees were blown down.\"  This was not what he had come up for, though indeed the news was true, but his pride was touched by that remark of Warde's and he would not now admit that he had tramped up there just to visit them.  \"Gee whiz, do you think I don't know that eight's a company, nine's a crowd with patrols?\" he said.  \"Do you think I don't know that? Anyway, if I wanted to go and hang out with any patrol I'd go with the Ravens, wouldn't I?  I only came up to tell you that, because I thought you'd like to know.  Do you think I'm trying to find out your secrets? Gee whiz!\"  \"Come ahead in, Kid,\" said Roy; \"Warde didn't mean that.\"  \"I will not.\"  \"What's the matter with you anyway?\" Will Dawson asked.  \"I'm not in your patrol,\" Pee-wee said.  \"What's the big idea?\" Westy Martin asked.  \"You weren't in it when you went on the bee-line hike with us either, were you?\"  \"That's different,\" Pee-wee said.  \"Anyway I was a scout then, because I was in the Ravens and anyway I've got to go to the store.\"  Before they realized it he was gone.  \"What the dickens did you want to say that for?\" Roy asked Warde.  \"Oh, it just jumped out of my mouth,\" Warde said; \"I didn't think he'd be so touchy.  Wait, I'll call him back.\"  But the sturdy little figure trudging down the hill paid no attention to Warde's call.  And the Silver Foxes, friendly and sympathetic as they were, were too preoccupied to think much about this trifling affair.  Perhaps they had just a little disinclination to having visitors, even the little mascot, participating in their private councils just then.  The point of the whole matter was that Pee-wee had been unintentionally eliminated; it was a sort of automatic process attributable to the springtime.  And he found himself alone.  He was not out of the troop, but he was not in any of the patrols, and in spite of all his spectacular missionary work he had not been able to form a patrol.  Pee-wee's pride was as great as his voice and his appetite, and he would not sponge on the patrols which had a full membership and were busy with their own concerns.  The rock on which he had stood all winter had split in three and there was no place for him on any of the pieces.  On Saturday morning the Silver Foxes went into the city to buy some camping things and to see a movie show in the afternoon.  The Ravens went off for a hike.  A Saturday spent alone was more than the soul of Pee-wee could endure, so he conquered his foolish pride and went up to Connie Bennett's house to find out what the Elks were going to do.  He would not join in with the Elks, he told himself, but he would pal with any single Elk, or even with two or three.  That would be all right as long as he did not foist himself upon a whole patrol.  \"Eight's a company, nine's a crowd, gee whiz, I have to admit that,\" he said to himself.  \"It's all right for me to go with one feller even if he's a scout but a patrol's different.\"  It was a wistful and rather pathetic little figure that Mrs. Bennett discovered upon the porch.  \"Connie?  Oh gracious, he's been gone an hour, dear,\" she said.  \"They all went away with Mr. Collins in his auto.  I told him he _must_ be back for supper.  How is it you're not with them, Walter?\"  \"I--I ain't in that patrol,\" said Pee-wee; \"it goes by patrols.  Anyway I'm sorry I troubled you.\"  He turned and went down the steps and picking up a stick drew it across the slats of a fence as he went up the street.  The outlandish noise seemed to act as a balm to his disappointment and to keep him company.     CHAPTER III  CASTLES IN THE AIR  The lonesomeness of Robinson Crusoe on his desert island was nothing compared to the lonesomeness of Pee-wee on that Saturday morning.  He might have attached himself to any of the three patrols and had a day's pleasure, but his pride had stood in the way.  He had always been something of a free lance in the troop and been regarded as a troop institution.  But there had always been his official place among the Ravens waiting for him whenever it suited his wanton fancy to return like a prodigal to the fold.  Now, in the pleasant springtime with the troop divided for the summer rivalries, he found himself quite isolated.  No one was to blame for this; a scout must be in one patrol or another, and if all patrols are full then he must make himself the nucleus of a new one.  That is what Mr. Ellsworth had told Pee-wee.  \"Gee whiz, nucleuses aren't so easy to be, that's one thing,\" Pee-wee muttered to himself as he bent his aimless way in the direction of Barrel Alley.  \"Maybe he thinks it's easy to be a nucleus.  Nucleuses are hard to be, I'll tell the world.  Anyway I can be a pioneer scout, that's one thing.  You don't have to be a nucleus or anything to be one of those.  They don't have to bother with patrols, they don't, they're lucky.\"  He ambled along kicking a stone before him in a disconsolate, disgruntled way.  He followed it wherever it went, ever and again kicking it back onto the sidewalk; the simple pastime seemed to afford him infinite relief.  And meanwhile, glowing visions arose in his mind, such visions as no one but a poet or a lonely boy on a Saturday morning in the springtime could possibly have.  No one had injured him in the least, he was liked by all, he was simply the unhappy victim of circumstances.  But in a mood of heroic retaliation against the troop he pictured himself as a pioneer scout residing aloof in a grim tower, surrounded by wireless apparatus and covered with merit badges.  Scouts from all over the world would make pilgrimages to his obscure retreat for a timid glimpse of the mysterious hero.  The glowing vision was somewhat marred by his conception of himself eating a huge sandwich as he looked down from his parapet upon the worshipping throng below.  Roy Blakeley would be down there among the others, his jollying propensity subdued by a feeling of awe as he gazed at the great scout hermit, the famous pioneer scout who sent messages to lesser scouts the world over.  They would whisper, \"he looks just like his pictures in _Boys' Life_,\" and he would smile down on them and . . .  _Plunk_!  The pioneer scout had collided with a man on the sidewalk and he returned to Bridgeboro with a suddenness that surprised even himself.  \"Excuse me,\" he said.  \"Certainly,\" said the man.  Pee-wee recovered his rock and began kicking it along the sidewalk again.  \"I'll show them,\" he said moodily.  He was about to ascend his scout throne again and engage in the gracious pastime of receiving delegations of common, ordinary scouts in his dim, wooded domain when he found himself at the edge of a region which was not in the least like the romantic wilderness of his vision. This was Barrel Alley, the habitat of Jimmy Mattenburg and Sweet Caporal and the McNulty twins.  Barrel Alley was the slum neighborhood of Bridgeboro and it was not very large.  But it was large  enough.  Pee-wee  explored the crooked, muddy, sordid street, gazing wistfully here and there for possible recruits.  But no human material was to be seen.  The older boys were playing craps in Dennahan's lot and the smaller boys were watching them.  One lonely sentinel was perched on the fence scanning the horizon for cops.  For this he received the regular union pay of a stale apple-core.  He was an unkempt urchin with an aggressive and challenging countenance, but he had solved several problems in economy.  One of these was the entire elimination of stockings and garters.  This was accomplished by the use of a pair of trousers with legs of such ample diameter and of such length as to render stockings altogether superfluous.  This released both garters for more important duties, they being tied end to end, thus constituting a sort of single strand suspender which at its junction with his trousers in front was securely held by a large nail.  His hair presented an appearance not unlike the negligent architecture of an eagle's nest, which is of the bungalow type in its loose irregularity.  He had not the slightest reason for supposing that Pee-wee was equipped with commissary stores, but on general principles he said,  \"Give us a hunk of candy, will yer?\"  As luck would have it, this random shot, fired at every strange boy from the upper world, hit the mark, to his unspeakable astonishment. Pulling out of his pocket a licorice jaw-breaker of vast dimensions, Pee-wee sent it shooting in a bee-line at the face of the stranger.  Never before in all his checkered history had Keekie Joe ever received any edible of any character whatever in response to his menacing demands.  He had always assumed that boys who were well dressed had fruit or candy in their pockets.  He had sometimes required them to verify their denials by an exhibition of the interior of these receptacles.  His invariable demand had become a habit with him. Therefore the little sugared black brick which now hit him in the eye came as an unprecedented surprise.  For a moment he did not know whether to construe it as a propitiatory gift or a warlike missile.  \"What's the matter with you, can't you catch?\" Pee-wee demanded.     CHAPTER IV  KEEKIE JOE  It required but a few seconds for Keekie Joe to decide to run true to form.  The situation was an unusual one, the missile was a delicious morsel, and was nothing more nor less than what he had demanded.  But still it had been thrown at him and Keekie Joe elected to consider it as a shot fired by the enemy.  \"Whatcher chuckin' things at me fer?\" he demanded, descending from the fence and approaching Pee-wee with a terrible look of menace.  He had been careful, however, to pick the jawbreaker up and put it in his mouth.  \"Didn't you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17767"],["title","Pee-wee Harris Adrift (#2)"],["body","you wanted one?\" Pee-wee asked.  \"Didn't you just put it in your mouth?\"  \"Never you mind wot I done,\" said Keekie Joe.  \"D'yer think yer cin sass me?\"  \"I'll show you how to catch if you'll say you'll be a scout,\" Pee-wee answered.  There could be no better illustration of his desperation as a scout missionary than this artless proposition to the sentinel of Barrel Alley.  \"Who can't catch?\" Keekie Joe demanded.  \"You can't.\"  \"Me?\"  \"Yes, you.\"  \"Yer dasn' say it again.\"  \"You can't catch, you can't catch, you can't catch,\" said Pee-wee.  There seemed nothing left now but to break off diplomatic relations altogether.  The issue was clear.  But Keekie Joe did not plunge his outlandish person into war.  \"If I didn' have ter lay keekie I'd slam yer one,\" he announced.  \"What's the use of giving you candy if we can't be friends?\" Pee-wee said.  \"Gee whiz, I wouldn't care how much candy fellers threw at me; the more the merrier.  They can throw mince pies at me for all I care,\" he added.  \"If you want to be a scout I'll show you how and we can start a patrol maybe.\"  [Illustration: Keekie Joe interviews Pee-wee]  The word patrol seemed to suggest something ominous to Keekie Joe, for he glanced furtively up and down the alley, and then waved his hand reassuringly to the group in the middle of the field.  Pee-wee perceived now that the scene of the crap game had been selected with keen military wisdom, affording a safe avenue of precipitate retreat in any direction.  Disaster could have resulted only from a surrounding host.  Officer McMahon, the tyrant on this squalid beat, was large.  But he was not large enough to surround the camp.  The crap-shooters of Barrel Alley had been surprised in every nook and corner of their neighborhood until they had hit upon the bold expedient of playing in an open lot, reposing their trust in a sentinel.  It would not have been well for the sentinel to relax his vigilance.  \"What I want ter join them scout kids fer?\" Keekie Joe inquired.  \"Der yer call me a sissy?\"  \"Do you call the scouts sissies?\" Pee-wee inquired angrily.  \"They have more fun than you do, that's one sure thing.  If you don't want to join you don't have to but you don't have to get mad about it.  Gee whiz, you're always mad, kind of.  I guess you got up out of the wrong side of the bed, that's what _I_ think.\"  This was not true, for indeed Keekie Joe did not sleep in a bed at all; he slept on a heap of old inner tubes in Ike Levine's tire repair shop. He was about to resent this slander from Pee-wee with a glowering look and a threat, when suddenly something happened, which precipitately terminated his performance of his official functions.  His father called him from a tenement across the street, accompanying his summons with such dismal predictions of what would happen if he did not obey that the official sentinel had no choice but to desert his post.  \"If I have ter come over there'n git yer,\" the father said, \"I'll----\"  Poor Joe glanced at his father in the window, then at the gamesters in the field.  It was evident that chastisement of the severest character awaited him in any case.  For a moment he had a wild notion of making a spectacular retreat along the street, crawling through a broken part of the fence beyond the range of parental vision, and resuming his duties of sentinel at another vantage point.  Such a maneuver would at least postpone a reckoning with his father and enable him to be faithful to his trust.  A very unworthy trust it may have been but his one thought was to be faithful to it.  And there you have Keekie Joe in a nutshell . . .     CHAPTER V  A QUESTION OF DUTY  Pee-wee's advice to Joe in this predicament was rather singular, and the scout law on which he based it covered a rather larger field of obligation than was necessary in the circumstances.  \"Go ahead over,\" he whispered; \"you have to obey your parents and all other duly constituted authorities.  I'll lay keekie for you while you're gone; go ahead over, I'll keep watch.\"  \"Yes, you will!\" said Joe incredulously.  \"I know youz guys, y'll put one over, that's what y'll do.  Wat'd'yer mean, constute--con--authorities? Yes yer will, _not_!\"  \"That shows how much you know about scouts,\" Pee-wee said, always ready to explain the ins and outs of scouting.  \"Do you think I'd cheat?  Gee whiz, I've got to be faithful to a trust, haven't I?  If I say I'll do a thing I'll do it.  You go ahead over and I'll keep watch and if I don't do it you can punch me in the eye the next time you see me.\"  It was not so much this proffer of indemnity as a supplementary threat from the window across the way which decided Keekie Joe.  He did not believe in Pee-wee for he did not believe in anybody.  But he was a bit puzzled at this self-possessed little stranger from another world.  There was a straightforward, clear look in the little scout's eyes which bespoke both friendliness and sincerity and Keekie Joe did not understand this.  The emergency decided him to repose faith in the strange boy but it was not in him to do this graciously.  \"You keep yer eyes peeled till I git back, and giv'm the high sign, d'yer hear?\" he said with insolent skepticism, \"or the first time I see yer on Main Street I'll black up both yer eyes fer yer, d'yer see?\"  \"That's one thing I like about you,\" said Pee-wee; \"gee whiz, you obey scout laws without even knowing them.  That shows you're a kind of a scout and you don't know it.\"  Keekie Joe did not look much like a scout, as he shuffled across the street; he did not even look like the rawest of raw scout material.  But statues are carved out of hard rock.  And Keekie Joe was a very hard rock indeed.  Pee-wee vaulted up onto the ramshackle fence, placed one of those granite bricks known as a licorice jaw-breaker in his mouth, and prepared for his indefinite vigil.  He was not thinking of the \"constituted authorities,\" he was not thinking of the crap-shooters either; his back was turned to them and his all seeing eye was fixed on the distant street corner.  He was thinking of Keekie Joe and of how Keekie Joe had tried to obey one of the good scout laws by being faithful to a trust.  And there you have Pee-wee Harris in a nut-shell . . .  The game in the middle of the large field must have become exciting, for its votaries were gathered into a close group.  None of the players seemed able now to spare so much as a cautious glance toward the street. Once, during his intense preoccupation, Slats Corbett gave a quick, furtive glance afar, but it was only in a sort of sub-consciousness that he glimpsed a figure sitting on the fence, its back toward him.  That was enough.  The group gathered closer, voices were heard in excited altercation, there were long intervals of silence.  The group had shrunken and become compact.  All were stooping.  Their preoccupation seemed intense.  They had forgotten all about the lookout.  Occasionally some civilian passed along the distant alley and guilty instinct caused one or another of the group to glance thither to give a hasty appraisal of his mission and character.  And so the wicked game went on.  And the sports of Barrel Alley never knew that their stronghold had been invaded by the boy scouts.  Then around the distant corner appeared two figures in civilian clothes, strangers in Barrel Alley.  They were County Detectives Slippett and Spotson.  They strolled down the alley innocently.  Keekie Joe, whose activities were chiefly local, knew them not.  But Pee-wee Harris, Scout, knew them.  On one of his long hikes he had seen them arrest a motorist in Northvale.  He had seen them loitering in the post office at Little Valley.  They did duty in the various municipalities of the county where the familiar faces of the local officials were a stumbling block to the apprehension of wrongdoers.  They were going to break up this ring of gambling rowdies, and so forth and so forth and so forth . . .  Pee-wee's first impulse was to shout, but on second thought it occurred to him that the army of invasion consisting of two, one of them might make a flank move on hearing his warning voice, and that one detective could thus drive the criminals into the very arms of the other, as they passed through the back yard of Chin Foo's laundry.  Chin Foo's back yard was a sort of trap.  So instead of shouting he descended from the fence with lightning agility and ran across the field as fast as his legs would carry him, and pell-mell into the group.  \"Two detectives are coming down the alley,\" he panted.  \"Beat it over that way and then you'll _sure_ not run into one of them because they've got--got--a lot of strat--strat--strat--strat--egy--they have--you'd better hurry up.\"  The time it required for the group to disperse can not be indicated by any word in the English language.  They were there and then they were _not_ there.  As Pee-wee stood amid scattered coins and dice he was conscious of distant forms scaling fences, wriggling through holes, and of one pair of legs disappearing majestically over a dilapidated roof.  As a disorderly retreat it was a masterpiece.  It was not in Pee-wee's nature to run from anything or anybody.  So there he stood amid the telltale mementoes of the dreadful game while Detectives Slippett and Spotson strolled into the field.  They were just in time to behold a fleeting vision of forms wriggling through fences, gliding around buildings, and scrambling over roof tops.  County Detective Spotson was quick to sense the situation.  Taking Pee-wee roughly by the shoulder he demanded in that sophisticated voice and manner which all detectives acquire and which sometimes passes for shrewdness, \"What's the big idea, huh?  Tipped them off, did you?  Well, you're a very clever kid, ain't you?\"  He removed his big hand from Pee-wee's shoulder and injected his fingers down the back of the boy's neck, grabbing him by the collar and gathering it so that it almost choked him.
