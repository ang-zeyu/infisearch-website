Now you know why I, who had had such misfortunes, was glad at least to bring you luck.\"  \"It's my turn to bring you some, I think,\" began the man she could trust; but she stopped him by putting up her plump little white hand.  \"If you mean with money, no,\" she said, with soft decision that was pretty and sad to hear. \"If you mean with advice, yes. If you could only get me something to do! You see, they will be turning us out of our hotel to-morrow. They've let us keep our rooms on, up to now, but for two days they've not given us anything to eat. Of course, it can't go on like this. If it hadn't been for you, I think when I went back to tell my mother that the last louis of the viatique was gone, we would have killed ourselves.\"  \"Great Heaven, you must promise me not to do that,\" the young man implored.  \"I will promise, now, for you have saved me by--caring a little. You do care, really, don't you?\"  \"I wouldn't have blood in my veins, if I didn't. But--about something for you to do--I must think.\"  \"Are you staying here for some time?\" asked the girl.  \"I haven't made up my mind.\"  \"I asked because I--I suppose you don't need a secretary, do you? I can write such a good English hand; and I know French and Italian as well as I do German, and your own language. If I could be of use, I would work so hard for you.\"  \"I dare say I shall be needing a secretary after Christmas, indeed, I'm sure I shall,\" insisted the young man, more and more earnest in his desire to do good. \"I have dozens of letters to write every day, and all sorts of odds and ends to keep straight. I could bring the things down to your place and you could help me, if you would. But I'm afraid it would be no end of bother to you.\"  \"I should love it,\" said the girl, gently.  \"Oh, it would be hard work. It would take a lot of your time, and be worth a lot of money.\"  \"Would it really? But you mustn't overpay me. I should be so angry if you did that.\"  \"There's no danger. I'm a good business man, I assure you. I should pay a capable secretary like you--knowing several languages and all that--say forty dollars a week. That's about two hundred francs.\"  \"Wouldn't that be too much?\"  \"Hardly enough.\"  \"You are so good--so good! But I knew you would be. I wonder if you would think me a very bold girl if I told you something? It's this; I've never forgotten you since those days in Paris. You were different, somehow, from other men I had seen. I thought about you. I had a presentiment that we should meet again. My mother dreamed of numbers to play at roulette. I dreamed of--but oh, I am saying things I ought not to say! Please don't blame me. When you've starved for two days, and not known what to do--unless to die, and then a man comes who is kind, and saves you from terrible things, you can't be as wise and well behaved as at other times.\"  \"Poor child,\" said the young man.  \"It does me good to be called that. But you don't know my name, the name of your new secretary. It is Julie--Julie de Lavalette. My mother is the Comtesse de Lavalette. And you?\"  \"Oh, I'm plain Hugh Egerton,\" said the young man.  The girl laughed. \"I do not think you are plain Hugh Egerton at all. But perhaps an American girl would not tell you that? Hugh! What a nice name. I think it is going to be my favourite name.\"  She glanced up at him softly, under long lashes,--a thrilling glance; but he missed its radiance, for his own eyes were far away. Hugh had been the favourite name of another girl.  When she saw that look of his, she rose from her chair. \"I'm taking too much of your time,\" she exclaimed, remorsefully. \"I must go.\"  His eyes and thoughts came back to the wearer of pink and roses. Perhaps there had been just a little too much softness and sweetness. It had been wise of her to change the key, and speak of parting.  He paid for the lunch, and tipped the waiters so liberally that they all hoped he would come again often. Then he asked if he might walk with her to the hotel where she and her mother were staying.  \"It's down in the Condamine,\" she hesitated. \"We've moved there lately, since the money began to go, and we've had to think of everything. It's rather a long walk from here.\"  \"All the better for me,\" he answered, and her smile was an appreciation of the compliment.  They sauntered slowly, for there was no haste. Nobody else wanted Hugh Egerton's society, and he began to believe that this girl sincerely did want it. He also believed that he was going to do some real good in the world, not just in the ordinary, obvious way, by throwing about his money, but by being genuinely necessary to someone.  When they had strolled down the hill, and had followed for a time the straight road along the sea on that level plain which is the Condamine, the girl turned up a side street. \"We live here,\" she said, and stopped before a structure of white stucco, rococco decoration, and flimsy balconies. Large gold letters, one or two of which were missing, advertised the house as the Hotel Pension Beau Soleil; and those who ran might read that it would be charitable to describe its accommodation as second rate.  \"It is not nice,\" she went on, with a shrug of her pretty shoulders. \"But--it is good to know all the same that we will not be turned out. I have a new heart in my breast, since I left this house a few hours ago--because there is a You in the world.\"  As she said this, she held out her hand for goodbye, and when he had shaken it warmly, the young man was bold enough to slip off her wrist the little pink leather bag which hung there by its chain.  \"Now for that advance on your secretarial work,\" he said; and taking from his pocket a wad of notes which he had won at the Casino, he stuffed it hastily into the yawning mouth of the bag, while the girl's soft eyes gazed at the sea. Then he closed the spring with a snap, and she let him pass the chain over her hand once more.  \"Oh, but it looks very fat,\" she exclaimed. \"Are you sure you counted right?\"  \"There's a little more there,\" he said, uncomfortably, \"just a little to save the bother of counting here in the street. Don't look angry. Only the salary part's for you, of course, but the rest--couldn't you just hand it over to your mother, and say, 'Winnings at the Casino'? That's true, you know; it was, every bit. And you needn't say who won it. Besides, if it hadn't been for you, it would have been lost instead of won. It would be a kind of Christmas present for your mother from the Casino, which really owes her a lot more.\"  The girl shook her head, gently. \"I couldn't do that, even for my mother's sake; but I don't misunderstand, now we are such friends. I know how kindly you mean, and though neither mother nor I can accept presents of money, even from dear friends (after all we are of the noblesse!) I'm not going to hurt you by giving the money back, if you will do what I ask of you.\"  \"What is that?\" He felt ready to do anything within reason.  \"Let us sell you our dear little dog, for this extra money you have put into my bag. He is very, very valuable, for he cost thousands of francs, the sweet pet, so you would really have something not unworthy, in return for your goodness. Ah, don't say no. You would love Papillon, and we should love you to have him. We couldn't have parted with our little darling to a stranger, though we were starving; but it would make us happy to think he was yours. And then, if you won't, you must take all this back.\" As she spoke, she touched the bag on her arm.  \"Oh, I'll have the dog!\" Hugh Egerton said, quickly. Anything rather than the girl should return the money, which she so much needed. \"I remember he was a dear little chap, Pomeranian or something of the sort. I hope he likes motors.\"  \"He will like whatever you like. If you will come and fetch him this evening, I will show you all his tricks. Do come. It would be good to see you again so soon.\"  \"With pleasure,\" said the young man, flushing slightly. \"If you think your mother will be well enough to receive me?\"  \"The news I have to give will almost cure her. If you would dine with us? They will give us a dinner, now\"--and she laughed childishly--\"when I have paid the bill. It will be very stupid for you at a place like this, but you will have a welcome, and it is the best we can do.\"  \"It is the welcome I want,\" said Hugh. \"But if you and your mother could dine with me somewhere--\"  \"Another time we will.\"  There were to be other times, of course!  \"And this evening,\" she went on, \"we can talk of my beginning work, as your secretary. It shall be directly after Christmas?\"  \"Whenever you are ready.\"  \"I suppose you have friends to whom you will go for Christmas?\"  \"Not a friend.\"  \"Oh, perhaps we might be together--all three?\"  \"I'll think of something pleasant for us to do, if you'll let me.\"  \"How good you are! Then, till this evening. It will seem long till then.\"  They shook hands once more. She had taken off her glove now, and her palm left on his a reminiscence of Peau d'Espagne. He did not know what the scent was, but it smelled rich and artificial, and he disliked to associate it with his new friend. \"But probably it's her mother's, and she didn't choose it herself,\" he thought. \"Well--I have a new interest in life now. I expect this is the best thing that's happened to me for a long time.\"  As he walked back to his hotel, his head was full of plans for the girl's transient pleasure and lasting benefit. \"Poor lonely child,\" he thought. \"And what a mother! She ought not to be left with a person like that. She ought to marry. It would be a good deed to take her away from such an influence. So young, and so ingenuous as she is still, in spite of the surroundings she must have known, she is capable of becoming a noble woman. Perhaps, if she turns out to be really as sweet and gentle as she seems--\"  The sentence broke off unfinished, in his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17743"],["title","Rosemary: A Christmas story (#3)"],["body","nd, and ended with a great sigh.  There could be only second best, and third best things in life for him now, since love was over, and it would be impossible for him to care for an angel from heaven, who had not the face and the dear ways of the girl he had lost. But second best things might be better than no good things at all, if only one made up one's mind to accept them thankfully. And it was a shame to waste so much money on himself, when there were soft-eyed, innocent girls in the world who ought to be sheltered and protected from harm.     [Illustration: CHAPTER THREE]  WHEN THE CURTAIN WAS DOWN   [Illustration: T]  The soft-eyed, innocent girl who had inspired the thought went into the hotel, and was rather cross to the youthful concierge, because the _ascenseur_ was not working. There were three flights of stairs to mount before she reached her room, and she was so anxious to open her bag to see what was inside, that she ran up very fast, so fast that she stepped on her dress and ripped out a long line of gathers. Her eyes were not nearly as soft as they had been, while she picked up the hanging folds of pink cloth, and went on.  The narrow corridor at the top of the staircase was somewhat dark, and, her eyes accustomed to the brilliant light out of doors, the girl stumbled against a child who was coming towards her.  \"_Petit bête!_\" she snapped. \"You have all but made me fall. Awkward little thing, why don't you keep out of people's way?\"  The child flushed. She would have liked to answer that it was Mademoiselle who had got in her way; but Mother wished her to be always polite. \"I am sorry,\" she replied instead, not saying a word about the poor little toes which the pretty pink lady had crushed.  \"Well, then, if you are sorry, why don't you let me pass?\" asked the girl of the soft eyes.  \"If you please, I want to give you a note,\" said the child, anxiously searching a small pocket. \"It's from Mother, for Madame. She told me to take it to your door; so I did, several times, but nobody answered. Here 'tis, please, Mademoiselle.\"  Mademoiselle snatched it from the hand, which was very tiny, and pink, with dimples where grown up folk have knuckles. She then pushed past the child, and went on to a door at the end of the passage, which she threw open, without knocking.  \"_Eh bien_, Julie! You have been gone long enough to break the bank twice over. What luck have you had?\" exclaimed the husky voice of a woman who sat in an easy chair beside a wood fire, telling her own fortune with an old pack of cards, spread upon a sewing board, on her capacious lap.  She was in a soiled dressing gown of purple flannel, with several of the buttons off. In the clear light of a window at the woman's back, her hair, with a groundwork of crimson, was overshot with iridescent lights. On a small table at her side a tray had been left, with the remains of _déjeuner_; a jug stained brown with streaks of coffee; a crumbled crescent roll; some balls of silver paper which had contained cream chocolates; ends of cigarettes, and a scattered grey film of ashes. At her feet a toy black Pomeranian lay coiled on the torn bodice of a red dress; and all the room was in disorder, with an indiscriminate litter of hats, gloves, French novels, feather boas, slippers, and fallen blouses or skirts.  The lady of the roses went to the mirror over the untidy mantel piece, and looked at herself, as she answered. \"No luck at roulette or trente. But the best of luck outside.\"  \"What, then?\"  The girl began to hum, as she powdered her nose with a white glove, lying in a powder box.  \"You remember _le beau brun_?\"  \"The young man in Paris you made so many enquiries about at Ritz's? Is he here?\"  \"He is. I've just had lunch with him. Oh, there are lots of things to tell. He is a good boy.\"  \"How, good? You told him we had had losses?\"  \"I painted a sad picture. He was most sympathetic.\"  \"To what extent?\"  \"_Chere maman!_ One would think we were vulgar adventuresses. We are not. He respects me, this dear young man, and it is right that he should. I deserve to be respected. You know the fable about the dog who dropped his meat in the water, trying to snap at its reflection? Well, I don't ask strangers for loans. I make my impression. Monsieur Hugh Egerton is my friend--at present. Later, he will be what I choose. And most certainly I shall choose him for a husband. What luck, meeting him again! It is time I settled down.\"  \"They said at Ritz's that he was one of the young millionaires, well known already in America,\" the fat woman reflected aloud. \"It is a good thing that I have brought you up well, Julie, and that you are pretty.\"  \"Yes, it is a good thing that I am pretty,\" repeated the girl. \"We have had many hopes often before, but this seems to be the most promising. I think it is very promising indeed, and I don't mean to let it slip.\"  She turned her back to the easy chair, and opened the pink bag. As the woman talked on, she secretly counted out the money. There were more than ten thousand francs in mille notes and others of smaller denominations. Quietly she put them away in the top of a travelling box, which she locked. Then she noticed the letter which the child had given her, still lying on the dressing table, with her gloves.  \"Here's something from _la belle Americaine_, upstairs,\" said she. \"A _billet doux_.\"  \"A dun,\" exclaimed the woman.  \"No doubt. It can be nothing else.\"  \"Well, we can't pay.\"  \"No, we can't pay,\" said the girl, looking at the locked box.  \"Let me see, how much was it she lent?\"  \"Two hundred francs, I think. We told her we'd give it back in a week. That's nearly a month ago.\"  \"Serve her right for trusting strangers. The saints alone know when she'll see her money again. She shouldn't be so soft hearted. It doesn't pay in these days.\"  \"Neither do we--when we can help it.\"  They both laughed.  \"But when you are Madame--let me see, what was the name of the young monsieur, they told you at the Ritz?\"  \"Egerton.\"  \"Ah yes. When you are Madame Egerton--\"  \"Everything will be very different then.\"  And the girl slipped the key of the box into the little pink bag.     [Illustration: CHAPTER FOUR]  DOGS AND FATHERS   [Illustration: A]  After delivering her letter, the child went slowly on downstairs, to the room she had been on the way to visit. It was on the second floor, just under the room of the Comtesse de Lavalette.  \"Come in,\" said a Cockney voice shrill with youth, in answer to her tap; and the child obeyed.  Though this room was of the same size and shape, it was very different from that of the Comtesse. The plain furniture was stiffly arranged, and there was no litter of clothing or small feminine belongings. By the window, which gave a glimpse of the sea, and of Monaco rock with the old part of the Palace, a plump young girl sat, with a baby a year or two old in her arms, and a nurse's cap on her smooth head.  \"You invited me to come down after I'd had my déjeûner, so I came,\" said the child.  \"Right you are, Miss Rosemary,\" returned the plump girl. \"You're such a quaint little body, you're a regular treat. I declare I ain't 'alf sure I wouldn't rather talk to you, than read the Princess Novelettes. Besides, I do get that tired of 'earin' nothin' but French, I'm most sorry I undertook the job; and the Biby don't pick up English much yet.\"  \"Don't you think he's a bright baby?\" asked the child, sitting down on a footstool, which was a favourite seat of hers.  \"For a French biby, 'e 's as bright as you could expect,\" replied her hostess, judicially.  \"Are they different?\"  \"Well, they ain't Hinglish.\"  \"_I'm_ half American,\" said the little girl.  \"You don't talk through your nose. Far as I can see, you've got as good a haccent as me.\"  \"I suppose yours _is_ good?\" asked Rosemary, as if she longed to have a doubt set forever at rest.  \"Rather! Ain't I been brought out from London on purpose so as this biby can learn to speak Hinglish, instead of French? It's pretty near the sime thing as bein' nursery governess. Madame wouldn't trust her own wye of pronouncing the languidge. She must 'ave a Hinglish girl.\"  \"And she sent for you on purpose?\" the child enquired, with increasing respect.  \"Well, I was the only one as would come at the price. 'Tain't big wages; but I'm seein' loife. Lor', I come down here with Madame and Mounseer a fortnight ago, and Monte Carlo ain't got many secrets from me. I _was_ a duffer, though, at first. When I 'eerd all them shots poppin' off every few minutes, up by the Casino, I used to think 'twas the suicides a shooting theirselves all over the place, for before I left 'ome, I 'ad a warnin' from my young man that was the kind of goin's on they 'ad here. But now I know it's only the pigeon shooters, tryin' for prizes, and I wouldn't eat a pigeon pie in this 'otel, not if 'twas ever so!\"  \"Do they ever have them?\" asked the little girl, awed.  \"Not as I knows of, but they may for Christmas. I sye, are you lookin' forward to your Christmas, kiddy?\"  \"Angel--that's Mother, I mean--says I'm not going to have much of a Christmas this year. I'm trying not to mind. I suppose it's because Santa Claus can't get to the Riviera, with his sleigh and reindeer. How could he, Miss Jane, when there's no snow, and not even a scrap of ice?\"  \"Pshaw!\" said Miss Jane. \"It ain't Santa Claus brings you things, snow or no snow. Only babies believe that. You're old enough to know better. It's your father and mother does it all.\"  \"Are you sure?\" asked Rosemary.  \"Dead sure. Don't be a silly and cry, now, just because there ain't any Santa Claus, nor any fairies.\"  \"It isn't that,\" said the little girl. \"It's because I can never have any more Christmases, if it depends on a father. You know, I haven't a father.\"  \"I supposed you 'adn't, as 'e ain't 'ere, with yer ma,\" replied the young person. \"She's mighty pretty.\"  \"I think she's the prettiest mother in the world,\" said Rosemary, proudly.  \"She don't look much "]]]
