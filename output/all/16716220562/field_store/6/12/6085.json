In art it is ever true, as _Faust_ concludes, that \"In the beginning was the deed.\" The laws of composition are the products of compositions; and, being such, they cannot remain unalterable so long as the impulse freshly to create remains. All great men are ahead of their time, and in all great music, no matter when written, you shall find instances of profounder meaning and deeper or newer feeling than marked the generality of contemporary compositions. So Bach frequently floods his formal utterances with Romantic feeling, and the face of Beethoven, serving at the altar in the temple of Beauty, is transfigured for us by divine light. The principles of creation and conservation move onward together, and what is Romantic to-day becomes Classic to-morrow. Romanticism is fluid Classicism. It is the emotional stimulus informing Romanticism which calls music into life, but no sooner is it born, free, untrammelled, nature's child, than the regulative principle places shackles upon it; but it is enslaved only that it may become and remain art.

IV  _The Modern Orchestra_   [Sidenote: _The orchestra as an instrument._]  [Sidenote: _What may be heard from a band._]  The most eloquent, potent, and capable instrument of music in the world is the modern orchestra. It is the instrument whose employment by the classical composers and the geniuses of the Romantic School in the middle of our century marks the high tide of the musical art. It is an instrument, moreover, which is never played upon without giving a great object-lesson in musical analysis, without inviting the eye to help the ear to discern the cause of the sounds which ravish our senses and stir up pleasurable emotions. Yet the popular knowledge of its constituent parts, of the individual value and mission of the factors which go to make up its sum, is scarcely greater than the popular knowledge of the structure of a symphony or sonata. All this is the more deplorable since at least a rudimentary knowledge of these things might easily be gained, and in gaining it the student would find a unique intellectual enjoyment, and have his ears unconsciously opened to a thousand beauties in the music never perceived before. He would learn, for instance, to distinguish the characteristic timbre of each of the instruments in the band; and after that to the delight found in what may be called the primary colors he would add that which comes from analyzing the vast number of tints which are the products of combination. Noting the capacity of the various instruments and the manner in which they are employed, he would get glimpses into the mental workshop of the composer. He would discover that there are conventional means of expression in his art analogous to those in the other arts; and collating his methods with the effects produced, he would learn something of the creative artist's purposes. He would find that while his merely sensuous enjoyment would be left unimpaired, and the emotional excitement which is a legitimate fruit of musical performance unchecked, these pleasures would have others consorted with them. His intellectual faculties would be agreeably excited, and he would enjoy the pleasures of memory, which are exemplified in music more delightfully and more frequently than in any other art, because of the r√¥le which repetition of parts plays in musical composition.  [Sidenote: _Familiar instruments._]  [Sidenote: _The instrumental choirs._]  The argument is as valid in the study of musical forms as in the study of the orchestra, but it is the latter that is our particular business in this chapter. Everybody listening to an orchestral concert recognizes the physical forms of the violins, flutes, cornets, and big drum; but even of these familiar instruments the voices are not always recognized. As for the rest of the harmonious fraternity, few give heed to them, even while enjoying the music which they produce; yet with a few words of direction anybody can study the instruments of the band at an orchestral concert. Let him first recognize the fact that to the mind of a composer an orchestra always presents itself as a combination of four groups of instruments--choirs, let us call them, with unwilling apology to the lexicographers. These choirs are: first, the viols of four sorts--violins, violas, violoncellos, and double-basses, spoken of collectively as the \"string quartet;\" second, the wind instruments of wood (the \"wood-winds\" in the musician's jargon)--flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons; third, the wind instruments of brass (the \"brass\")--trumpets, horns, trombones, and bass tuba. In all of these subdivisions there are numerous variations which need not detain us now. A further subdivision might be made in each with reference to the harmony voices (showing an analogy with the four voices of a vocal choir--soprano, contralto, tenor, and bass); but to go into this might make the exposition confusing. The fourth \"choir\" (here the apology to the lexicographers must be repeated with much humility and earnestness) consists of the instruments of percussion--the kettle-drums, big drum, cymbals, triangle, bell chime, etc. (sometimes spoken of collectively in the United States as \"the battery\").  [Illustration: SEATING PLAN OF THE NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY.]  [Sidenote: _How orchestras are seated._]  [Sidenote: _Plan of the New York Philharmonic._]  The disposition of these instruments in our orchestras is largely a matter of individual taste and judgment in the conductor, though the general rule is exemplified in the plan given herewith, showing how Mr. Anton Seidl has arranged the desks for the concerts of the Philharmonic Society of New York. Mr. Theodore Thomas's arrangement differed very little from that of Mr. Seidl, the most noticeable difference being that he placed the viola-players beside the second violinists, where Mr. Seidl has the violoncellists. Mr. Seidl's purpose in making the change was to gain an increase in sonority for the viola part, the position to the right of the stage (the left of the audience) enabling the viola-players to hold their instruments with the F-holes toward the listeners instead of away from them. The relative positions of the harmonious battalions, as a rule, are as shown in the diagram. In the foreground, the violins, violas, and 'cellos; in the middle distance, the wood-winds; in the background, the brass and the battery; the double-basses flanking the whole body. This distribution of forces is dictated by considerations of sonority, the most assertive instruments--the brass and drums--being placed farthest from the hearers, and the instruments of the viol tribe, which are the real backbone of the band and make their effect by a massing of voices in each part, having the place of honor and greatest advantage. Of course it is understood that I am speaking of a concert orchestra. In the case of theatrical or operatic bands the arrangement of the forces is dependent largely upon the exigencies of space.  [Sidenote: _Solo instruments._]  Outside the strings the instruments are treated by composers as solo instruments, a single flute, oboe, clarinet, or other wind instrument sometimes doing the same work in the development of the composition as the entire body of first violins. As a rule, the wood-winds are used in pairs, the purpose of this being either to fill the harmony when what I may call the principal thought of the composition is consigned to a particular choir, or to strengthen a voice by permitting two instruments to play in unison.  [Sidenote: _Groupings for harmony effects._]  [Sidenote: _Wagner's instrumental characterization._]  [Sidenote: _An instrumental language._]  Each choir, except the percussion instruments, is capable of playing in full harmony; and this effect is frequently used by composers. In \"Lohengrin,\" which for that reason affords to the amateur an admirable opportunity for orchestral study, Wagner resorts to this device in some instances for the sake of dramatic characterization. _Elsa_, a dreamy, melancholy maiden, crushed under the weight of wrongful accusation, and sustained only by the vision of a seraphic champion sent by Heaven to espouse her cause, is accompanied on her entrance and sustained all through her scene of trial by the dulcet tones of the wood-winds, the oboe most often carrying the melody. _Lohengrin's_ superterrestrial character as a Knight of the Holy Grail is prefigured in the harmonies which seem to stream from the violins, and in the prelude tell of the bringing of the sacred vessel of Christ's passion to Monsalvat; but in his chivalric character he is greeted by the militant trumpets in a strain of brilliant puissance and rhythmic energy. Composers have studied the voices of the instruments so long and well, and have noted the kind of melodies and harmonies in which the voices are most effective, that they have formulated what might almost be called an instrumental language. Though the effective capacity of each instrument is restricted not only by its mechanics, but also by the quality of its tones--a melody conceived for one instrument sometimes becoming utterly inexpressive and unbeautiful by transferrence to another--the range of effects is extended almost to infinity by means of combination, or, as a painter might say, by mixing the colors. The art of writing effectively for instruments in combination is the art of instrumentation or orchestration, in which Berlioz and Wagner were Past Grand Masters.  [Sidenote: _Number of instruments._]  The number of instruments of each kind in an orchestra may also be said to depend measurably upon the music, or the use to which the band"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1748"],["title","Other People's Money (#0)"],["body","PEOPLE‚ÄôS MONEY  By Emile Gaboriau     PART I   I  There is not, perhaps, in all Paris, a quieter street than the Rue St. Gilles in the Marais, within a step of the Place Royale.  No carriages there; never a crowd.  Hardly is the silence broken by the regulation drums of the Minims Barracks near by, by the chimes of the Church of St. Louis, or by the joyous clamors of the pupils of the Massin School during the hours of recreation.  At night, long before ten o‚Äôclock, and when the Boulevard Beaumarchais is still full of life, activity, and noise, every thing begins to close.  One by one the lights go out, and the great windows with diminutive panes become dark.  And if, after midnight, some belated citizen passes on his way home, he quickens his step, feeling lonely and uneasy, and apprehensive of the reproaches of his concierge, who is likely to ask him whence he may be coming at so late an hour.  In such a street, every one knows each other: houses have no mystery; families, no secrets,--a small town, where idle curiosity has always a corner of the veil slyly raised, where gossip flourishes as rankly as the grass on the street.  Thus on the afternoon of the 27th of April, 1872 (a Saturday), a fact which anywhere else might have passed unnoticed was attracting particular attention.  A man some thirty years of age, wearing the working livery of servants of the upper class,--the long striped waistcoat with sleeves, and the white linen apron,--was going from door to door.  ‚ÄúWho can the man be looking for?‚Äù wondered the idle neighbors, closely watching his evolutions.  He was not looking for any one.  To such as he spoke to, he stated that he had been sent by a cousin of his, an excellent cook, who, before taking a place in the neighborhood, was anxious to have all possible information on the subject of her prospective masters.  And then, ‚ÄúDo you know M. Vincent Favoral?‚Äù he would ask.  Concierges and shop-keepers knew no one better; for it was more than a quarter of a century before, that M. Vincent Favoral, the day after his wedding, had come to settle in the Rue St. Gilles; and there his two children were born,--his son M. Maxence, his daughter Mlle. Gilberte.  He occupied the second story of the house.  No. 38,--one of those old-fashioned dwellings, such as they build no more, since ground is sold at twelve hundred francs the square metre; in which there is no stinting of space.  The stairs, with wrought iron balusters, are wide and easy, and the ceilings twelve feet high.  ‚ÄúOf course, we know M. Favoral,‚Äù answered every one to the servant‚Äôs questions; ‚Äúand, if there ever was an honest man, why, he is certainly the one.  There is a man whom you could trust with your funds, if you had any, without fear of his ever running off to Belgium with them.‚Äù  And it was further explained, that M. Favoral was chief cashier, and probably, also, one of the principal stockholders, of the Mutual Credit Society, one of those admirable financial institutions which have sprung up with the second empire, and which had won at the bourse the first installment of their capital, the very day that the game of the Coup d‚ÄôEtat was being played in the street.  ‚ÄúI know well enough the gentleman‚Äôs business,‚Äù remarked the servant; ‚Äúbut what sort of a man is he?  That‚Äôs what my cousin would like to know.‚Äù  The wine-man at No. 43, the oldest shop-keeper in the street, could best answer.  A couple of petits-verres politely offered soon started his tongue; and, whilst sipping his Cognac:  ‚ÄúM. Vincent Favoral,‚Äù he began, ‚Äúis a man some fifty-two or three years old, but who looks younger, not having a single gray hair.  He is tall and thin, with neatly-trimmed whiskers, thin lips, and small yellow eyes; not talkative.  It takes more ceremony to get a word from his throat than a dollar from his pocket.  ‚ÄòYes,‚Äô  ‚Äòno,‚Äô ‚Äògood-morning,‚Äô ‚Äògood-evening;‚Äô that‚Äôs about the extent of his conversation.  Summer and winter, he wears gray pantaloons, a long frock-coat, laced shoes, and lisle-thread gloves.  ‚ÄòPon my word, I should say that he is still wearing the very same clothes I saw upon his back for the first time in 1845, did I not know that he has two full suits made every year by the concierge at No. 29, who is also a tailor.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhy, he must be an old miser,‚Äù muttered the servant.  ‚ÄúHe is above all peculiar,‚Äù continued the shop-keeper, ‚Äúlike most men of figures, it seems.  His own life is ruled and regulated like the pages of his ledger.  In the neighborhood they call him Old Punctuality; and, when he passes through the Rue Turenne, the merchants set their watches by him.  Rain or shine, every morning of the year, on the stroke of nine, he appears at the door on the way to his office.  When he returns, you may be sure it is between twenty and twenty-five minutes past five.  At six he dines; at seven he goes to play a game of dominoes at the Cafe Turc; at ten he comes home and goes to bed; and, at the first stroke of eleven at the Church of St. Louis, out goes his candle.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHem!‚Äù grumbled the servant with a look of contempt, ‚Äúthe question is, will my cousin be willing to live with a man who is a sort of walking clock?‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt always pleasant,‚Äù remarked the wine-man; ‚Äúand the best evidence is, that the son, M. Maxence, got tired of it.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHe does not live with his parents any more?‚Äù  ‚ÄúHe dines with them; but he has his own lodgings on the Boulevard du Temple.  The falling-out made talk enough at the time; and some people do say that M. Maxence is a worthless scamp, who leads a very dissipated life; but I say that his father kept him too close.  The boy is twenty-five, quite good looking, and has a very stylish mistress: I have seen her. . . . I would have done just as he did.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAnd what about the daughter, Mlle. Gilberte?‚Äù  ‚ÄúShe is not married yet, although she is past twenty, and pretty as a rosebud.  After the war, her father tried to make her marry a stock-broker, a stylish man who always came in a two-horse carriage; but she refused him outright.  I should not be a bit surprised to hear that she has some love-affair of her own.  I have noticed lately a young gentleman about here who looks up quite suspiciously when he goes by No. 38.‚Äù  The servant did not seem to find these particulars very interesting.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lady,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthat my cousin would like to know most about.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNaturally.  Well, you can safely tell her that she never will have had a better mistress.  Poor Madame Favoral!  She must have had a sweet time of it with her maniac of a husband!  But she is not young any more; and people get accustomed to every thing, you know.  The days when the weather is fine, I see her going by with her daughter to the Place Royale for a walk.  That‚Äôs about their only amusement.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe mischief!‚Äù said the servant, laughing.  ‚ÄúIf that is all, she won‚Äôt ruin her husband, will she?‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat is all,‚Äù continued the shop-keeper, ‚Äúor rather, excuse me, no: every Saturday, for many years, M. and Mme. Favoral receive a few of their friends: M. and Mme. Desclavettes, retired dealers in bronzes, Rue Turenne; M. Chapelain, the old lawyer from the Rue St. Antoine, whose daughter is Mlle. Gilberte‚Äôs particular friend; M. Desormeaux, head clerk in the Department of Justice; and three or four others; and as this just happens to be Saturday--‚Äù  But here he stopped short, and pointing towards the street:  ‚ÄúQuick,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúlook!  Speaking of the--you know--It is twenty minutes past five, there is M. Favoral coming home.‚Äù  It was, in fact, the cashier of the Mutual Credit Society, looking very much indeed as the shop-keeper had described him.  Walking with his head down, he seemed to be seeking upon the pavement the very spot upon which he had set his foot in the morning, that he might set it back again there in the evening.  With the same methodical step, he reached his house, walked up the two pairs of stairs, and, taking out his pass-key, opened the door of his apartment.  The dwelling was fit for the man; and every thing from the very hall, betrayed his peculiarities.  There, evidently, every piece of furniture must have its invariable place, every object its irrevocable shelf or hook.  All around were evidences, if not exactly of poverty, at least of small means, and of the artifices of a respectable economy.  Cleanliness was carried to its utmost limits: every thing shone.  Not a detail but betrayed the industrious hand of the housekeeper, struggling to defend her furniture against the ravages of time.  The velvet on the chairs was darned at the angles as with the needle of a fairy.  Stitches of new worsted showed through the faded designs on the hearth-rugs.  The curtains had been turned so as to display their least worn side.  All the guests enumerated by the shop-keeper, and a few others besides, were in the parlor when M. Favoral came in.  But, instead of returning their greeting:  ‚ÄúWhere is Maxence?‚Äù he inquired.  ‚ÄúI am expecting him, my dear,‚Äù said Mme. Favoral gently.  ‚ÄúAlways behind time,‚Äù he scolded.  ‚ÄúIt is too trifling.‚Äù  His daughter, Mlle. Gilberte, interrupted him:  ‚ÄúWhere is my bouquet, father?‚Äù she asked.  M. Favoral stopped short, struck his forehead, and with the accent of a man who reveals something incredible, prodigious, unheard of,  ‚ÄúForgotten,‚Äù he answered, scanning the syllables: ‚ÄúI have for-got-ten it.‚Äù  It was a fact.  Every Saturday, on his way home, he was in the habit of stopping at the old woman‚Äôs shop in front of the Church of St. Louis, and buying a bouquet for Mlle. Gilberte.  And to-day . . .  ‚ÄúAh!  I catch you this time, father!‚Äù exclaimed the girl.  Meantime, Mme. Favoral, whispering to Mme. Desclavettes:  ‚ÄúPositively,‚Äù she said in a troubled voice, ‚Äúsomething serious must have happened to--my husband.  He to forget!  He to fail in one of his habits!  It is the first time in twenty-six years.‚Äù  The appearance of Maxence at this moment prevented her from going on. M. Favoral was about to administer a sound reprimand to"]]]
