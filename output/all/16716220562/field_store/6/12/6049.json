There entertain him all the Saints above,   In solemn troops, and sweet Societies   That sing, and singing in their glory move,                         180   And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes.   Now Lycidas the Shepherds weep no more;   Hence forth thou art the Genius of the shore,   In thy large recompense and shalt be good   To all that wander in that perilous flood.    Thus sang the uncouth Swain to th'Okes and rills,   While the still morn went out with Sandals gray,   He touch'd the tender stops of various Quills,   With eager thought warbling his Dorick lay:   And now the Sun had stretch'd out all the hills,                    190   And now was dropt into the Western bay;   At last he rose, and twitch'd his Mantle blew:   To morrow to fresh Woods, and Pastures new.

To the Right Honourable, John Lord Vicount Bracly, Son and   Heir apparent to the Earl of Bridgewater, &c.     My LORD,    This Poem, which receiv'd its first occasion of Birth from your   Self, and others of your Noble Family, and much honour from   your own Person in the performance, now returns again to   make a finall Dedication of it self to you.  Although not openly   acknowledg'd by the Author, yet it is a legitimate off-spring, so   lovely, and so much desired, that the often Copying of it hath   tired my Pen to give my several friends satisfaction, and brought   me to a necessity of producing it to the publike view; and now   to offer it up in all rightfull devotion to those fair Hopes, and   rare endowments of your much-promising Youth, which give a   full assurance, to all that know you, of a future excellence.  Live   sweet Lord to be the honour of your Name, and receive this as   your own, from the hands of him, who hath by many favours   been long oblig'd to your most honour'd Parents, and as in this   representation your attendant Thyrsis, so now in all reall   expression    Your faithfull, and most humble Servant    H. LAWES.     Note: Dedication to Vicount Bracly: Omitted in 1673.     The Copy of a Letter writt'n by Sir HENRY WOOTTON, to   the Author, upon the following Poem.     From the Colledge, this 13. of April, 1638.    SIR,   It was a special favour, when you lately bestowed upon me   here, the first taste of your acquaintance, though no longer then   to make me know that I wanted more time to value it, and  to   enjoy it rightly; and in truth, if  I could then have imagined your   farther stay in these parts, which I understood afterwards by   Mr. H. I would have been bold in our vulgar phrase to mend my   draught (for you left me with an extreme thirst) and to have   begged your conversation again, joyntly with your said learned   Friend, at a poor meal or two, that we might have banded   together som good Authors of the antient time: Among which, I   observed you to have been familiar.    Since your going, you have charg'd me with new Obligations,   both for a very kinde Letter from you dated the sixth of this   Month, and for a dainty peece of entertainment which came   therwith.  Wherin I should much commend the Tragical part, if   the Lyrical did not ravish me with a certain Dorique delicacy in   your Songs and Odes, wherunto I must plainly confess to have   seen yet nothing parallel in our Language: Ipsa mollities.   But I must not omit to tell you, that I now onely owe you   thanks for intimating unto me (how modestly soever) the true   Artificer. For the work it self I had view'd som good while   before, with singular delight, having receiv'd it from our   common Friend Mr. R. in the very close of the late R's Poems,   Printed at Oxford, wherunto it was added (as I now suppose)   that the Accessory might help out the Principal, according to   the Art of Stationers, and to leave the Reader Con la bocca   dolce.    Now Sir, concerning your travels, wherin I may challenge a   little more priviledge of Discours with you; I suppose you will   not blanch Paris in your way; therfore I have been bold to   trouble you with a few lines to Mr. M. B. whom you shall easily   find attending the young Lord S. as his Governour, and you   may surely receive from him good directions for the shaping of   your farther journey into Italy, where he did reside by my choice   som time for the King, after mine own recess from Venice.    I should think that your best Line will be thorow the whole   length of France to Marseilles, and thence by Sea to Genoa,   whence the passage into Tuscany is as Diurnal as a Gravesend   Barge: I hasten as you do to Florence, or Siena, the rather to tell   you a short story from the interest you have given me in your   safety.    At Siena I was tabled in the House of one Alberto Scipioni, an   old Roman Courtier in dangerous times, having bin Steward to   the Duca di Pagliano, who with all his Family were strangled   save this onely man that escap'd by foresight of the Tempest:   With him I  had often much chat of those affairs; Into which he   took pleasure to look back from his Native Harbour: and at my   departure toward Rome (which had been the center of    his   experience) I had wonn confidence enough to beg his advice,   how I might carry my self securely there, without offence of   mine own conscience.  Signor Arrigo mio (sayes he) I pensieri   stretti, & il viso sciolto, will go safely over the whole World: Of   which Delphian Oracle (for so I have found it) your judgement   doth need no commentary; and therfore (Sir) I will commit you   with it to the best of all securities, Gods dear love, remaining    Your Friend as much at command as any of longer date,    Henry Wootton.    Postscript.    SIR, I have expressly sent this my Foot-boy to prevent your   departure without som acknowledgement from me of the   receipt of your obliging Letter, having myself through som   busines, I know not how, neglected the ordinary conveyance.   In any part where I shall understand you fixed, I shall be glad,   and diligent to entertain you with Home-Novelties; even for   som fomentation of our friendship, too soon interrupted in the   Cradle.
