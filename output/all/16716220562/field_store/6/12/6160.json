Again getting to work, she planed off a pellet of good sound wood--it looked like a nail-scrape, the mark she made--and masticating it and moistening it with saliva, whirred back like a homing aeroplane to her city in the making.  There was a whir and a buzz as she passed through the portals of her main gate from the light of day, and she reappeared again, backing out, \"looking daggers,\" as we say, and brandishing her poisoned dart--her sting, if you insist, on the end of her tail--in the air.  But she still hung on to her pellet.  Presumably some unlucky visitor had called in her absence.  More sounds of concentrated argument followed, and finally there fell out, rather than rushed out, a small and amazingly slender black wasp, one of those hermits who seem to consecrate their lives to lonely working for a family they never see.  This unhappy one slid down the bank, curled up at the bottom, uncurled, curled up again, and--remained curled. Apparently _her_ day's work was done, which comes of falling foul of the yellow flag.  Arrived inside, at her hallowed chamber, our queen carefully selected a rootlet in the roof--not just any old rootlet, mark you; never any \"old\" anything, you will notice, but a good, sound, well-found rootlet that you could hang five or six pounds' weight to; indeed, three rootlets before she had finished.  To these rootlets she fastened--gummed would be a more correct word--her pellet of wasp-paper, in the form of a thin layer, and hurried away, singing, for more.  This was, so to speak, the foundation-stone of the city, laid, be it noticed, not haphazard--our queen never did any business that way--but with mathematical regard as to what was to follow.  In very fact, too, it was the foundation-stone of her city, only upside-down, though that is nothing.  Wasps always do things that way, which is unlike ants, those other and greater city builders.  Back came the queen very soon with another load, and pasted that--thin--to the first layer, hurrying, bustling, humming a happy song continuously to herself.  Then away again for more, and in the process to a lively battle with a robber-fly, who appeared set upon robbing her of her blood.  It tried, like the beetle, to stalk her and pounce upon her back, what time she was planing out wood for paper-pulp; but her back wasn't there when it pounced, and her jaws were.  It \"waited on,\" hovering like a falcon, and twice as keen, and when she got to work again, dropped like a hurled lance-head, only to be met with jaws, wide and ready, as before.  It went away, watching from afar--far for an insect--from \"the little speedwell's darling blue\" upon the hedge-bank, and just as she was moistening the load, gathered ready to fly off, delivered its final ultimatum--a marvelously persistent murderer.  This time it, or, rather, she, was received with the point--the poisoned point--and, turning like a spent lightning-flash to avoid it, found the queen hard on her heels, following all down the gay hedge-ditch, humming high, in nearly a shriek of rage.  Finally, she turned, to do battle for her life, and the two, grappling, fell as shooting-stars fall, gleaming, athwart the sun, with a brrr-r like a fused wire, and finished the job, rolling over and over on the ground--rolling over and over among the stalks of bluebells, like the heavens \"upraising from the earth.\"  It is written, however, that few in the insect world can withstand a queen of the yellow devils, and in a few seconds the wasp got up and flew home again, quite unperturbed.  The robber-fly did not get up, and she was not quite unperturbed, but died as they die who are poisoned with formic acid, and very soon was still.  By the time the shadows crept across the entrance to the derelict mole-hole, warning the wasp back--for your true wasp is a worshiper of the sun--the queen had formed a disc of paper, and suspended there-from, in the middle, a stalk, also of paper, which widened out at its base, and became, as it were, the outlines of four six-sided cells. The cells were in the shape of a cross--that cross which you will always find at the foundation of the cities of the waspfolk, and, in a way, a sign or mark of their nationality--the cross in the market-square, so to speak, outwards from which the city grew.  The queen, satisfied apparently with her new city so far, hung up and went to sleep.  When anything or anybody came to prospect for house lots, or edible victims, during the still, silent, silver night, she hummed very severely, like an electric fan, to let the intruders know who she was, and they mostly backed out again in a hurry.  If they took a step nearer the hum rose an octave, and became very wicked, and that, so far as most of them were concerned, finished it.  Two, however, there were who would not take even that hint.  One was a shrew-mouse, thirsting for blood, but who got poison instead, and next morning was found running about with his mouth somewhere concealed behind his ear, if one may be pardoned the expression, in consequence; and the other was a carnivorous beetle, in black, purple-shot armor, and armed with jaws toothed like lobsters' claws.  The queen took some nasty scars from those same jaws before she got home with the poisoned point, a clean thrust 'twist breastplate and armlet, and the invader doubled up on the spot where he was, and had to be dragged out in the morning--not the dawning, for the sun had well stoked up before our wasp would have anything to do with him.  [Illustration: \"A shrew-mouse, thirsting for blood, but who got poison instead\"]  She found the day already in full swing when she rose, buzzing, from her front-gate, late--for wasps hate early morning chill, like Red Indians--and, circling once, swung straight away.  She jumped into full hustle right off, you see.  She did not merely work; she superworked. Forced to short hours by her constitution, she had to make up for it in the time she got, and she did.  She allowed nothing to stop her.  If anything tried to, she mostly stopped it, for there was no compromise about this nation-builder; she reached her goal every time.  It was on this journey that a spotted fly-catcher, sitting on a gatepost, made a Euclid figure at her in midair as she passed.  She had not power to fight the bird's beak, and her poison-dagger was useless here; nor do fly-catchers often miss.  This, however, was an occasion when one of them did--by an eighth of an inch--and only some electric-spark-like dodging on the part of the insect in the air made even that one miss possible.  It was so quick, you could not see what happened.  That day the cross of cells in this budding city was developed further, and a low wall built round each cell.  Moreover, more cells were built, always taking the cross as the center of all things--six-sided cells, with a low, incomplete wall, or, rather, parapet, partitioning each off, to the number of about twenty-four cells in all.  Each cell was closed, of course, at the top, the top being its floor, and open at the bottom, the bottom being, if I may so put it, the top; for, as has already been said, wasp cities are built upside-down, and everybody walks and hangs on his head, being so fitted for the purpose.  If you don't hang, you tumble straight down into the scooped-out cavity below; but nobody ever does that till he dies, for that cavity is at once the cemetery and the refuse-heap and the dust-bin of the city, a haunt of tiny ghouls--beetle, spider, and fly ghouls--and other loathsome horrors, the scavengers, hyenas, vultures, and jackals of the wasp world.  Now, after making the first cell, or, rather, the part cell, with its low parapet, the queen laid an egg--it was very minute, that egg--inside the cell, gumming it against the top, on the angle nearest the center of the city.  It had to be cemented there; otherwise it would have fallen out.  In the next cell she laid an egg, too, cementing it up to the top in the same manner--always in the angle nearest the center of the city--and in the next another egg, and so on, up to the twenty-four or so.  It is a little doubtful precisely how long she took over the process, because, for one thing, she made so many journeys backwards and forwards to get wood-pulp from the rails for paper manufacture--she used paper for everything; and, for another thing, she began to roof over the whole affair with a hanging umbrella made of layers of the finest paper that you ever did see--much finer than that made by the ordinary common or garden worker-wasp of the jam-pots and the stewed-fruit dish, for was she not a queen, and therefore not common in anything she did?--and it became, in consequence, rather hard to see what she really was \"at.\"  Most of the time that the sky remained cloudy she used up at this job, and also when there was a shower of rain, for she hated rain and all shadow and darkness.  Her purpose, in regard to this paper roofing, was to keep out any possible dripping that might come through the earth roof in wet weather, and to store up and multiply the heat from her body.  Terrific heat, to be sure; nevertheless important in the scheme of things.  When all was completed, this city, this mighty kingdom, measured about one and a half inches round.  When all was completed, also, the wasp flew out for a drink and a feed. But first she cleaned.  The most fastidious cat was a grimy tramp in comparison to her in habits, and in all her spare time--goodness alone knows how she squeezed in any spare time at all during those hustling days!--her first, and generally her last, act was to clean.  She could not afford dirt.  To be dirty, with her, was to die even more quickly than she would, anyway; for, you see, she did not breathe through her mouth, but all over herself, so"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17571"],["title","Piano Tuning: A Simple and Accurate Method for Amateurs (#0)"],["body","J.

For some years past a lack of competent men in the profession of Piano Tuning has been generally acknowledged. This may be accounted for as follows: The immense popularity of the piano and the assiduous efforts of factories and salesmen have led to the result that nearly every well-to-do household is furnished with an instrument. To supply this demand the annual production and sale for the year 1906 is estimated at three hundred thousand pianos in the United States. These pianos must be tuned many times in the factory before they are shipped to the salesroom; there they must be kept in tune until sold. When, finally, they take up their permanent abode in the homes of the purchasers, they should be given the attention of the tuner at least twice a year. This means work for the tuner. But this is not all. Presuming that the average life of the piano is about fifty years, it is evident that there exists in this country an accumulation of instruments variously estimated at from four to five millions. This means _more work for tuners_.  While production and accumulation have been increasing, there has been little, if any, effort made to provide tuners to look after the needs of this ever-increasing number of instruments, no provision for the thorough instruction of the learner of Piano Tuning, outside the walls of the factories, and of the few musical colleges where the art is taught. Doubtless there are many persons who are by nature well adapted to this agreeable and profitable occupation--persons who would make earnest effort to acquire the necessary skill and its honest application if they had a favorable opportunity. Musical colleges in which tuning is taught are few and far between; piano factories are built for the purpose of producing pianos and not tuners, for mechanics and laborers and not for teachers and pupils; furthermore, very little fine tuning is done in the factory; rough tuning is the bulk of the work there, and a long apprenticeship in the factory, with its meager advantages, is rarely sufficient to meet the demands of the would-be-thorough tuner. This may account, in part, for the fact that many who are incompetent are following this profession, and that there is an increasing demand for tuners of skill.  In view of these facts the author came to the opinion that if a course of instruction were prepared which would demonstrate clearly the many abstruse details of the art in an interesting and comprehensible way, it would be appreciated by those who are desirous to learn. Acting upon this impulse, he began the preparation of such a course.  The present book is the outgrowth of a course of instruction, used successfully with pupils from various parts of the United States and Canada, conducted partly by correspondence; partly at the school directed by the author. Although it has been necessary to revise the course somewhat for publication in the present form, no essential matter has been omitted and much has been added.  In preparing this course of study the utmost effort has been made to present the various topics in the clearest, most comprehensive manner, literary excellence being a secondary consideration.  While the book is designed for self-instruction, the systematic arrangement of the text, and the review questions with each lesson, suggest its use as a text-book for schools and colleges which give personal training in the care of the piano.  To the talented individual of either sex who is ambitious to acquire a dignified and profitable profession, to the scientifically-inclined musician who is eager to learn the fundamental principles underlying all musical harmony, and finally to the non-professional who loves to read because of a fondness for science, the book is submitted; if it should prove a boon to the former, a benefit to the second, or a pleasure to the latter, I shall feel rewarded for the work of its preparation.

Just what we are fitted for must, almost invariably, be decided by ourselves; and the sooner the better, else we may plod among the thousands whose lives are miserable failures for the reason that \"they have missed their calling.\"  In the consideration of Piano Tuning as a profession, one should first determine if he possesses the necessary qualifications, the most important of which are a musical ear and some degree of mechanical ability. Having these, all else may be acquired by study. It is not necessary to possess a musical education or to be a musician; although a knowledge of music will be found a great aid. Still, an elementary knowledge of the principles of music is a necessity to the student of this course, as it has been found impossible to avoid the use of a few technical terms. In most cases, however, they are set forth in such a way that they will be readily apprehended by anyone who has even a slight knowledge of the fundamental principles of music.  In teaching Piano Tuning, it is the custom of the \"Central School of Piano Tuning,\" for which these lessons were originally prepared, to have all students prepare two lessons in harmony as a test of their acquaintance with the intervals and chords used in tuning. The lessons are not difficult, and they embody only those principles which are essential to"]]]
