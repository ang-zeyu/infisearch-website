As they passed a high rock, out from behind it jumped the bad old tail-pulling monkey.  The tree barked and roared so like a lion that the foxes were frightened and were glad enough to run away.  Up, up and up into the air blew the kite and, as the string was tangled around the babboon's paws, it took him up with it.  \"Ker-sneezio!  Ker-snitzio!  Ker-choo!\" he sneezed as the powder from the puff balls went up his nose and into his eyes.  Jackie was so surprised that he opened his mouth.  Before Uncle Wiggily could stop himself he had run into the bush.     STORY I  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE WILLOW TREE  \"Well, it's all settled!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman, one day, as he hopped up the steps of his hollow stump bungalow where Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, his muskrat lady housekeeper, was fanning herself with a cabbage leaf tied to her tail.  \"It's all settled.\"  \"What is?\" asked Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy.  \"You don't mean to tell me anything has happened to you?\" and she looked quite anxious.  \"No, I'm all right,\" laughed Uncle Wiggily, \"and I hope you are the same.  What I meant was that it's all settled where we are going to spend our vacation this Summer.\"  \"Oh, tell me where!\" exclaimed the muskrat lady clapping her paws, anxious like.  \"In a hollow stump bungalow, just like this, but in the woods instead of in the country,\" answered Uncle Wiggily.  \"Oh, that _will_ be fine!\" cried Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy.  \"I love the woods. When are we to go?\"  \"Very soon now,\" answered the bunny gentleman uncle.  \"You may begin to pack up as quickly as you please.\"  And Nurse Jane and Uncle Wiggily moved to the woods very next day and his adventures began.  I guess most of you know about the rabbit gentleman and his muskrat lady housekeeper who nursed him when he was ill with the rheumatism. Uncle Wiggily had lots and lots of adventures, about which I have told you in the books before this one.  He had traveled about seeking his fortune, he had even gone sailing in his airship, and once he met Mother Goose and all her friends from Old King Cole down to Little Jack Horner.  Uncle Wiggily had many friends among the animal boys and girls.  There was Sammie and Susie Littletail, the rabbits, who have a book all to themselves; just as have Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow, the puppy dog boys, and Jollie and Jillie Longtail, the mice children.  \"And I s'pose we'll meet all your friends in the woods, won't we, Uncle Wiggily?\" asked Nurse Jane, as they moved from the old hollow stump bungalow to the new one.  \"Oh, yes, I s'pose so, of course,\" he laughed in answer, as he pulled his tall silk hat more tightly down on his head, fastened on his glasses and took his red, white and blue striped barber pole rheumatism crutch that Nurse Jane had gnawed for him out of a cornstalk.  So, once upon a time, not very many years ago, as all good stories should begin, Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane found themselves in the woods.  It was lovely among the trees, and as soon as the rabbit gentleman had helped Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy put the hollow stump bungalow to rights he started out for a walk.  \"I want to see what sort of adventures I shall have in the woods,\" said Mr. Longears as he hopped along.  Now in these woods lived, among many other creatures good and bad, two skillery-scalery alligators who were not exactly friends of the bunny uncle.  But don't let that worry you, for though the alligators, and other unpleasant animals, may, once in a while, make trouble for Uncle Wiggily, I'll never really let them hurt him.  I'll fix that part all right!  So, one day, the skillery-scalery alligator with the humps on his tail, and his brother, another skillery-scalery chap, whose tail was double jointed, were taking a walk through the woods together just as Uncle Wiggily was doing.  \"Brother,\" began the hump-tailed 'gator (which I call him for short), \"brother, wouldn't you like a nice rabbit?\"  \"Indeed I would,\" answered the double-jointed tail 'gator, who could wobble his flippers both ways.  \"And I know of no nicer rabbit than Uncle Wiggily Longears.\"  \"The very same one about whom I was thinking!\" exclaimed the other alligator.  \"Let's catch him!\"  \"That's what we'll do!\" said the double-jointed chap.  \"We'll hide in the woods until he comes along, as he does every day, and the we'll jump out and grab him.  Oh, you yum-yum!\"  \"Fine!\" grunted his brother.  \"Come on!\"  Off they crawled through the woods, and pretty soon they came to a willow tree, where the branches grew so low down that they looked like a curtain that had unwound itself off the roller, when the cat hangs on it.  \"This is the place for us to hide--by the weeping willow tree,\" said the skillery-scalery alligator with bumps on his tail.  \"The very place,\" agreed his brother.  So they hid behind the thick branches of the tree, which had leafed out for early spring, and there the two bad creatures waited.  Just before this Uncle Wiggily himself had started out from his hollow stump bungalow to walk in the woods and across the fields, as he did every day.  \"I wonder what sort of an adventure I shall have this time?\" he said to himself.  \"I hope it will be a real nice one.\"  Oh!  If Uncle Wiggily had known what was in store for him, I think he would have stayed in his hollow stump bungalow.  But never mind, I'll make it all come out right in the end, you see if I don't.  I don't know just how I'm going to do it, yet, but I'll find a way, never fear.  Uncle Wiggily hopped on and on, now and then swinging his red-white-and-blue-striped rheumatism crutch like a cane, because he felt so young and spry and spring-like.  Pretty soon he came to the willow tree.  He was sort of looking up at it, wondering if a nibble of some of the green leaves would not do him good, when, all of a sudden, out jumped the two bad alligators and grabbed the bunny gentleman.  \"Now we have you!\" cried the humped-tail 'gator.  \"And you can't get away from us,\" said the other chap--the double-jointed tail one.  \"Oh, please let me go!\" begged Uncle Wiggily, but they hooked their claws in his fur, and pulled him back under the tree, which held its branches so low.  I told you it was a weeping willow tree, and just now it was weeping, I think, because Uncle Wiggily was in such trouble.  \"Let's see now,\" said the double-jointed tail alligator.  \"I'll carry this rabbit home, and then--\"  \"You'll do nothing of the sort!\" interrupted the other, and not very politely, either.  \"I'll carry him myself.  Why, I caught him as much as you did!\"  \"Well, maybe you did, but I saw him first.\"  \"I don't care!  It was my idea.  I first thought of this way of catching him!\"  And then those two alligators disputed, and talked very unpleasantly, indeed, to one another.  But, all the while, they kept tight hold of the bunny uncle, so he could not get away.  \"Well,\" said the double-jointed tail alligator after a while, \"we must settle this one way or the other.  Am I to carry him to our den, or you?\"  \"Me!  I'll do it.  If you took him you'd keep him all for yourself.  I know you!\"  \"No, I wouldn't!  But that's just what you'd do.  I know you only too well.  No, if I can't carry this rabbit home myself, you shan't!\"  \"I say the same thing.  I'm going to have my rights.\"  Now, while the two bad alligators were talking this way they did not pay much attention to Uncle Wiggily.  They held him so tightly in their claws that he could not get away, but he could use his own paws, and, when the two bad creatures were talking right in each other's face, and using big words, Uncle Wiggily reached up and cut off a piece of willow wood with the bark on.  And then, still when the 'gators were disputing, and not looking, the bunny uncle made himself a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17807"],["title","Uncle Wiggily in the Woods (#1)"],["body","out of the willow tree stick.  He loosened the bark, which came off like a kid glove, and then he cut a place to blow his breath in, and another place to let the air out and so on, until he had a very fine whistle indeed, almost as loud-blowing as those the policemen have to stop the automobiles from splashing mud on you so a trolley car can bump into you.  \"I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said the hump-tail alligator at last. \"Since you won't let me carry him home, and I won't let you, let's both carry him together.  You take hold of him on one side, and I'll take the other.\"  \"Good!\" cried the second alligator.  \"Oh, ho!  I guess not!\" cried the bunny uncle suddenly.  \"I guess you won't either, or both of you take me off to your den.  No, indeed!\"  \"Why not?\" asked the hump-tailed 'gator, sort of impolite like and sarcastic.  \"Because I'm going to blow my whistle and call the police!\" went on the bunny uncle.  \"Toot!  Toot!  Tootity-ti-toot-toot!\"  And then and there he blew such a loud, shrill blast on his willow tree whistle that the alligators had to put their paws over their ears.  And when they did that they had to let go of bunny uncle.  He had his tall silk hat down over his ears, so it didn't matter how loudly he blew the whistle.  He couldn't hear it.  \"Toot!  Toot!  Tootity-toot-toot!\" he blew on the willow whistle.  \"Oh, stop!  Stop!\" cried the hump-tailed 'gator.  \"Come on, run away before the police come!\" said his brother.  And out from under the willow tree they both ran, leaving Uncle Wiggily safely behind.  \"Well,\" said the bunny gentleman as he hopped along home to his bungalow, \"it is a good thing I learned, when a boy rabbit, how to make whistles.\"  And I think so myself.  So if the vinegar jug doesn't jump into the molasses barrel and turn its face sour like a lemon pudding, I'll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the winter green.     STORY II  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE WINTERGREEN  Uncle Wiggily Longears, the nice old gentleman rabbit, knocked on the door of the hollow tree in the woods where Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the two little squirrel boys, lived.  \"Come in!\" invited Mrs. Bushytail.  So Uncle Wiggily went in.  \"I thought I'd come around and see you,\" he said to the squirrel lady. \"I'm living in the woods this Summer and just now I am out taking a walk, as I do every day, and I hoped I might meet with an adventure. But, so far, I haven't.  Do you know where I could find an adventure, Mrs. Bushytail?\"  \"No, I'm sorry to say I don't, Uncle Wiggily,\" answered the squirrel lady.  \"But I wish you could find something to make my little boy Billie feel better.\"  \"Why, is he ill?\" asked the bunny uncle, surprised like, and he looked across the room where Billy Bushytail was curled up in a big rocking chair, with his tail held over his head like an umbrella, though it was not raining.  \"No, Billie isn't ill,\" said Mrs. Bushytail.  \"But he says he doesn't know what to do to have any fun, and I am afraid he is a little peevish.\"  \"Oh, that isn't right,\" said Mr. Longears.  \"Little boys, whether they are squirrels, rabbits or real children, should try to be jolly and happy, and not peevish.\"  \"How can a fellow be happy when there's no fun?\" asked Billie, sort of cross-like.  \"My brother Johnnie got out of school early, and he and the other animal boys have gone off to play where I can't find them.  I had to stay in, because I didn't know my nut-cracking lesson, and now I can't have any fun.  Oh, dear!  I don't care!\"  Billie meant, I suppose, that he didn't care what he said or did, and that isn't right.  But Uncle Wiggily only pinkled his twink nose.  No, wait just a moment if you please.  He just twinkled his pink nose behind the squirrel boy's back, and then the bunny uncle said:  \"How would you like to come for a walk in the woods with me, Billie?\"  \"Oh, that will be nice!\" exclaimed the squirrel lady.  \"Do go, Billie.\"  \"No, I don't want to!\" chattered the boy squirrel, most impolitely.  \"Oh, that isn't at all nice,\" said Mrs. Bushy-tail.  \"At least thank Uncle Wiggily for asking you.\"  \"Oh, excuse me, Uncle Wiggily,\" said Billie, sorrylike.  \"I do thank you.  But I want very much to have some fun, and there's no fun in the woods.  I know all about them.  I know every tree and bush and stump. I want to go to a new place.\"  \"Well, new places are nice,\" said the bunny uncle, \"but old ones are nice, too, if you know where to look for the niceness.  Now come along with me, and we'll see if we can't have some fun.  It is lovely in the woods now.\"  \"I won't have any fun there,\" said Billie, crossly.  \"The woods are no good.  Nothing good to eat grows there.\"  \"Oh, yes there does--lots!\" laughed Uncle Wiggily.  \"Why the nuts you squirrels eat grow in the woods.\"  \"Yes, but there are no nuts now,\" spoke the squirrel boy.  \"They only come in the Fall.\"  \"Well, come, scamper along, anyhow,\" invited Uncle Wiggily.  \"Who knows what may happen?  It may even be an adventure.  Come along, Billie.\"  So, though he did not care much about it, Billie went.  Uncle Wiggily showed the squirrel boy where the early spring flowers were coming up, and how the Jacks, in their pulpits, were getting ready to preach sermons to the trees and bushes.  \"Hark!  What's that?\" asked Billie, suddenly, hearing a noise.  \"What does it sound like?\" asked Uncle Wiggily.  \"Like bells ringing.\"  \"Oh, it's the bluebells--the bluebell flowers,\" answered the bunny uncle.  \"Why do they ring?\" asked the little boy squirrel.  \"To call the little ants and lightning bugs to school,\" spoke Uncle Wiggily, and Billy smiled.  He was beginning to see that there were more things in the woods than he had dreamed of, even if he had scampered here and there among the trees ever since he was a little squirrel chap.  On and on through the woods went the bunny uncle and Billie.  They picked big, leafy ferns to fan themselves with, and then they drank with green leaf-cups from a spring of cool water.  But no sooner had Billie taken the cold water than he suddenly cried:  \"Ouch!  Oh, dear!  Oh, my, how it hurts!\"  \"What is it?\" asked Uncle Wiggily.  \"Did you bite your tongue or step on a thorn?\"  \"It's my tooth,\" chattered Billie.  \"The cold water made it ache again. I need to go to Mr. Stubtail, the bear dentist, who will pull it out with his long claws.  But I've been putting it off, and putting it off, and now--Oh, dear, how it aches!  Wow!\"  \"I'll cure it for you!\" said Uncle Wiggily.  \"Just walk along through the woods with me and I'll soon stop your aching tooth.\"  \"How can you?\" asked Billie, holding his paw to his jaw to warm the aching tooth, for heat will often stop pain.  \"There isn't anything here in the woods to cure toothache; is there?\"  \"I think we shall find something,\" spoke the bunny uncle.  \"Well, I wish we could find it soon!\" cried Billie, \"for my tooth hurts very much.  Ouch!\" and he hopped up and down, for the toothache was of the jumping kind.  \"Ah, ha!  Here we have it!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, as he stooped over some shiny green leaves, growing close to the ground, and he pulled some of them up.  \"Just chew these leaves a little and let them rest inside your mouth near the aching tooth,\" said Mr. Longears.  \"I think they will help you, Billie.\"  So Billie chewed the green leaves.  They smarted and burned a little, but when he put them near his tooth they made it nice and warm and soon the ache all stopped.  \"What was that you gave me, Uncle Wiggily?\" Billie asked.  \"Wintergreen,\" answered Uncle Wiggily.  \"It grows in the woods, and is good for flavoring candy, as well as for stopping toothache.\"  \"I am glad to know that,\" said Billie.  \"The woods are a nicer place than I thought, and there is ever so much more in them than I dreamed. Thank you, Uncle Wiggily.\"  So, as his toothache was all better, Billie had good fun in the woods with the bunny uncle, until it was time to go home.  And in the next story, if the top doesn't fly off the coffee pot and let the baked potato hide away from the egg-beater, when they play tag, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the slippery elm.     STORY III  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SLIPPERY ELM  \"Where are you going, Uncle Wiggily?\" asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, as she saw the rabbit gentleman standing on the front steps of his hollow stump bungalow in the woods one morning. \"Where are you going?\"  \"Oh, just for a walk through the forest,\" spoke the bunny uncle.  \"It is so nice in the woods, with the flowers coming up, and the leaves getting larger and greener every day, that I just love to walk there.\"  \"Well,\" said Nurse Jane with a laugh, \"if you happen to see a bread-tree in the woods, bring home a loaf for supper.\"  \"I will,\" promised Uncle Wiggily.  \"You know, Nurse Jane, there really are trees on which bread fruit grows, though not in this country.  But I can get you a loaf of bread at the five and ten cent store, I dare say.\"  \"Do, please,\" asked the muskrat lady.  \"And if you see a cocoanut tree you might bring home a cocoanut cake for supper.\"  \"Oh, my!\" laughed the rabbit gentleman.  \"I'm afraid there are no cocoanut trees in my woods.  I could bring you home a hickory nut cake, perhaps.\"  \"Well, whatever you like,\" spoke Nurse Jane.  \"But don't get lost, whatever you do, and if you meet with an adventure I hope it will be a nice one.\"  \"So do I,\" Uncle Wiggily said, as he hopped off, leaning on his red, white and blue stripped [Transcriber's note: striped?] rheumatism crutch which Nurse Jane had gnawed for him out of a cornstalk.  The old rabbit gentleman had not gone very far before he met Dr. Possum walking along in the woods, with his satchel of medicine on his tail, for Dr. Possum cured all the ill animals, you know.  \"What in the world are you doing, Dr. Possum?\" asked Uncle Wiggily, as he saw the animal doctor pulling some bark off a tree.  \"Are you going to make a canoe, as the Indians used to do?\"  \"Oh, no,\" answered Dr.  Possum.  \"This is a "]]]
