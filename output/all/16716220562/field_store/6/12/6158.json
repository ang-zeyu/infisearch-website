Gulo yelled aloud--and he was a dumb beast, too, as a rule, but I guess the pain was excruciating--as a hooked stiletto, it appeared, stabbed through fur, through skin, deep down through flesh, right into his back, clutching, gripping vise-like. Another stiletto, hooked, too, worse than the first one, beat at his skull, tore at his scalp, madly tried to rip out his eyes.  Vast overshadowing pinions--as if they were the wings of Azrael--hammered in his face, smothering him, beating him down.  Ah, but I have seen some fights, yet never such a fight as that; and never again do I want to see such a fight as the one between Gulo and the golden eagle that made a mistake in his pride of power.  All the awful, cruel, diabolical, clever, devilish, and yet almost human fury that was in that old brute of a Gulo flamed out in him at that moment, and he fought as they fight who go down to hell.  It was frightful.  It was terrifying.  Heaven alone knows what the eagle thought he had got his claws into.  It was like taking hold of a flash of forked lightning by the point.  It was--great!  Still, flight _is_ flight, and lifting-power is lifting-power.  Gulo, even Gulo, could not get over that.  He could not stop those vast vans from flapping; and as they flapped they rose, the eagle rose, he--though it was like the skinning of his back alive--rose too, wriggling ignominiously, raging, foaming, snapping, kicking, but--he rose.  Slowly, very slowly, the great bird lifted his terrible prey up and up--ten, twenty, thirty, forty feet, but no higher.  That was the limit of his lift, the utmost of his strength; and at that height parallel with the ridge, he began to carry the wolverine along, the wolverine that was going mad with rage in his grasp.  It was a mistake, of course--a mistake for the wolverine to be out on the open ridge in stark daylight; another mistake for the eagle, presuming on his fine, lustful pride of strength, to attack him.  And then suddenly Gulo got his chance.  It hit him bang in the face, nearly blinding him as it passed--the tree-top.  Like lightning Gulo's jaws clashed shut upon it, his claws gripped, and--he thought his back was going to come off whole.  But he stuck it.  He was not called Gulo the Indomitable for nothing.  And the eagle stopped too.  He had to, for he would not let go; nor would Gulo.  An awful struggle followed, in the middle of which the pine-top broke, gave way, and, before either seemed to know quite what was happening, down they both came, crashing from branch to branch, to earth.  The fall broke the king of the birds' hold, but not the fighting fury of the most hated of all the beasts.  He rose up, half-blind, almost senseless, but mad with rage beyond any conception of fury, did old Gulo, and he hurled himself upon that eagle.  What happened then no man can say.  There was just one furious mix-up of whirling, powdered snow, that hung in the air like a mist, out of which a great pinion, a clawing paw, a snapping beak, a flash of fangs, a skinny leg and clutching, talons, a circling bushy tail appeared and vanished in flashes, to the accompaniment of stupendous flappings and abominably wicked growls.        *      *      *      *      *      *  That night the lone wolf, scouting along the ridge-top, stopped to sniff intelligently at the scattered, torn eagle's feathers lying about in the trampled snow, at the blood, at the one skinny, mailed, mightily taloned claw still clutching brown-black, rusty fur and red skin; at the unmistakable flat-footed trail of Gulo, the wolverine, leading away to the frowning, threatening blackness of the woods.  He could understand it all, that wolf.  Indeed, it was written there quite plainly for such as could read.  He read, and he passed on.  He did not follow Gulo's bloody trail.  No--oh, dear, no!  Probably, quite probably, he had met Gulo the Indomitable before, and--was not that enough?     II  BLACKIE AND CO.  Blackie flung himself into the fight like a fiery fiend cut from coal. He did not know what the riot was about--and cared less.  He only knew that the neutrality of his kingdom was broken.  Some one was fighting over his borders; and when fighting once begins, you never know where it may end!  (This is an axiom.)  Therefore he set himself to stop it at once, lest worse should befall.  He found two thrushes apparently in the worst stage of d.t.'s.  One was on his back; the other was on the other's chest.  Both were in a laurel-bush, half-way up, and apparently they kept there, and did not fall, through a special dispensation of Providence.  Both fought like ten devils, _and both sang_.  That was the stupefying part, the song. It was choked, one owns; it was inarticulate, half-strangled with rage, but still it _was_ song.  A cock-chaffinch and a hen-chaffinch were perched on two twigs higher up, and were peering down at the grappling maniacs.  Also two blue titmice had just arrived to see what was up, and a sparrow and one great tit were hurrying to the spot--all on Blackie's \"beat,\" on Blackie's very own hunting-ground.  Apparently a trouble of that kind concerned everybody, or everybody thought it did.  Blackie arrived upon the back of the upper and, presumably, winning thrush with a bang that removed that worthy to the ground quite quickly, and in a heap.  The second thrush fetched up on a lower branch, and by the time the first had ceased to see stars he had apparently regained his sanity.  He beheld Blackie above him, and fled. Perhaps he had met Blackie, professionally, before, I don't know.  He fled, anyway, and Blackie helped him to flee faster than he bargained for.  By the time Blackie had got back, the first thrush was sitting on a branch in a dazed and silly condition, like a fowl that has been waked up in the night.  Blackie presented him with a dig gratis from his orange dagger, and he nearly fell in fluttering to another branch.  And Blackie flew away, chuckling.  He knew that, so far as that thrush was concerned, there would be no desire to see any more fighting for some time.  But, all the same, Blackie was not pleased.  He was worked off his feet providing rations for three ugly youngsters in a magnificently designed and exquisitely worked and interwoven edifice, interlined with rigid cement of mud, which we, in an off-hand manner, simply dismiss as \"A nest.\"  The young were his children; they might have been white-feathered angels with golden wings, by the value he put on them. The thrush episode was only a portent, and not the first.  He had no trouble with the other feathered people he tolerated on his beat.  Blackie went straight to the lawn.  (Jet and orange against deep green was the picture.)  Now, if you and I had searched that dry lawn with magnifying-glasses, in the heat of the sun, there and then, we should not have found a single worm, not the hint or the ghost of one; yet that bird took three long, low hops, made some quick motion with his beak--I swear it never seemed to touch the ground, even, let alone dig---executed a kind of jump in the air--some say he used his legs in the air--and there he was with a great, big, writhing horror of a worm as big as a snake (some snakes).  Thrushes bang their worms about to make them see sense and give in; they do it many times.  Blackie banged his giant only a little once or twice, and then not savagely, like a thrush.  Also, again, he may or may not have used his feet.  Moreover, he gave up two intervals to surveying the world against any likely or unlikely stalking death.  Yet that worm shut up meekly in most unworm-like fashion, and Blackie cut it up into pieces.  The whole operation took nicely under sixty seconds.  Blackie gave no immediate explanation why he had reduced his worm to sections.  It did not seem usual.  Instead, he eyed the hedge, eyed the sky, eyed the surroundings.  Nothing seemed immediately threatening, and he hopped straight away about three yards, where instantly, he conjured another and a smaller worm out of nowhere.  With this unfortunate horror he hopped back to the unnice scene of the first worm's decease, and carved that second worm up in like manner.  Then he peeked up all the sections of both worms, packing them into his beak somehow, and flew off.  And the robin who was watching him didn't even trouble to fly down to the spot and see if he had left a joint behind. He knew his blackbird, it seemed.  Blackie flew away to his nest, but not to a nest in a hedge.  To dwell in a hedge was a rule of his clan, but the devil a rule did he obey. Nests in hedges for other blackbirds, perhaps.  He, or his wife, had different notions.  Wherefore flew he away out into the grass field behind the garden.  Men had been making excavations there, for what mad man-purpose troubled him not--digging a drain or something.  No matter.  Into the excavation he slipped---very, very secretly, so that nobody could have seen him go there--and down to the far end, where, twelve feet below the surface, on a ledge of wood, where the sides were shored with timber, his mate had her nest.  Here he delivered over his carved joints to the three ugly creatures which he knew as his children and thought the world of, and appeared next flying low and quickly back to the garden.  That is to say, he had contrived to slip from the nest so secretly that that was the first time he showed.  A sparrow-hawk, worried with a family of her own, took occasion to chase him as he flew, and he arrived in among the young lime-trees that backed the garden, switchbacking--that was one of his tricks of escape, made possible by a long tail--and yelling fit to raise the world.  The sparrow-hawk's skinny yellow claw, thrust forward, was clutching thin air an inch behind his central tail-feathers, but that was all she got of him--just thin air.  There was no crash as he hurled into the green maze; but she, failing to swerve exactly in time, made a mighty crash, and retired"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17567"],["title","The Way of the Wild (#5)"],["body","dazed, thankful that she retained two whole wings to fly with.  There is no room for big-winged sparrow-hawks in close cover, anyway, and Blackie, who was born to the leafy green ways, knew that.  Blackie's yells had called up, as if by magic, a motley crowd of chaffinches, hedge-sparrows, wrens, robins, &c., from nowhere at all, and they could be seen whirling in skirmishing order--not too close--about the retreating foe.  Blackie himself needed no more sparrow-hawk for a bit, and preferred to sit and look on.  If the little fools chose to risk their lives in the excitement of mobbing, let them.  His business was too urgent.  Twenty lightning glances around seemed to show that no death was on the lurk near by.  Also, a quick inspection of other birds' actions--he trusted to them a good deal--appeared to confirm this.  Then he flew down to the lawn, and almost immediately had a worm by the tail.  Worms object to being so treated, and this one protested vigorously.  Also, when pulled, they may come in halves.  So Blackie did not pull _too_ much.  He jumped up, and, while he was in the air, scraped the worm up with his left foot, or it may have been both feet. The whole thing was done in the snap of a finger, however, almost too quickly to be seen.  The worm, once up, was a dead one.  Blackie seemed to kill it so quickly as almost to hide the method used.  In a few seconds more it was a carved worm in three or four pieces--an unnice sight, but far more amenable to reason that way.  Blackie was in rather long grass, and nerve-rackingly helpless, by the same token.  He could not see anything that was coming.  Wherefore every few seconds he had to stand erect and peer over the grass-tops. It made no difference to the worm, however; it was carved just the same.  Blackie now hopped farther on in search of more worms, but found a big piece of bread instead.  It was really the hen-chaffinch who found the bread, and he who commandeered it from her.  Now he disclosed one fact, and that was that bread would do for his children as well as worms. Anyhow, he stuffed his beak about half up with bread, returned for the pieces of worm, collected these, and retired up into the black cover of a fir-tree.  No doubt he was expected to go right home with that load, then and there.  Even a cock-blackbird with young, however, must feed, and, if one judged by the excess amount of energy--if that were possible--used up, must feed more than usual.  That seemed to be why he hid his whole load in the crook of a big bough, and, returning to the lawn, ate bread--he could wait to catch no worms for his own use, it appeared--as fast as he could.  Three false alarms sent him precipitantly into his tree upon this occasion, and one real alarm--a passing boy--caused a fourth retreat.  These operations were not performed in a moment, and by the time he got back to his nest--mind, he had to contrive to approach it so that he was seen by nobody, and his was a conspicuous livery, too--his children appeared to be in the last stages of exhaustion.  That, however, is young birds all over; they expect their parents to be mere feeding-machines, guaranteed to produce so many meals to the hour, and hang the difficulties and the risks.  There was no sign of Blackie's wife.  Presumably she was working just as hard on her own \"beat\" as he had been on his--their hunting-grounds were separate, though they joined--and would soon be back.  Blackie did not wait.  He managed again the miracle of getting away from his nest without appearing to do so, and next turned up on the summer-house roof.  Fatherlike, he thought he had done enough for a bit, and would enjoy a \"sunning reaction\" on the summerhouse roof.  It was rather a good place, a look-out tower from which he could slip over the side into the hedges, which met at the corner where it was, if trouble turned up.  Trouble did turn up, but not quite what he had expected.  He had been sitting there, wing-stretching, leg-stretching, and \"preening\" his feathers, and had finally left off just to sit and do nothing, when--lo! his wife popped up over the side without warning, and right upon him.  She was very dark brown, not black, and had a paler throat than the palish throat of most hen blackbirds--nearly white, in fact.  She said nothing.  Nor did Blackie, but he looked very uncomfortable.  She did more than say nothing.  She went for him, beak first, and very angrily indeed; and he, not waiting to receive her, fled down to the lawn, and began worm-hunting for dear life.  A whole lecture could not have said more.  Mrs. Blackie remained on the roof for about a minute, looking round, and then flew off to her own hunting-ground.  She was wilder and less trusting of the world than Blackie, and did not care for his lawn in full view of the house windows.  And Blackie did not even stop his work to watch her go.  Apparently they had, previously in their married life, arrived at a perfect understanding.  This time, too, Blackie got a big and a small worm.  The small he coiled like a rope, and held up towards the base of his beak; the big he carved up into sections, which he held more towards the tip.  The large ones, it seemed, were too awkward and lively simply to carry off rolled up whole.  The journey that followed was a fearful one in Blackie's life, for he met half-way the very last foe in the world he was expecting--namely, an owl.  Truly, it was a very small owl, scarce bigger than himself; but it was an owl, and, like all its tribe, armed to the teeth.  Men called it a little owl.  That was its name--little owl.  Blackie didn't care what men called it; he knew it only as one of the hundred or so shapes that death assumed for his benefit.  Just at that time it happened to be cloudy, and little owls often hunt by day.  But how was Blackie to know that, little owls being a comparatively new introduction into those parts?  Blackie screamed and fled.  The owl did not scream, but fled, too--after Blackie.  Blackie had no means of judging how close _that_ foe was behind by the whir of its wings.  Owls' wings don't talk, as a rule; they have a patent silencer, so to speak, in the fluffy-edged feathers.  Therefore Blackie was forced to do his best in breaking the speed record, and trust to luck.  It was a breathless and an awful few seconds, and it seemed to him like a few hours.  The owl came up behind, going like a cloud-shadow, and about as fast, and Blackie, glancing over his shoulder, I suppose, yelled afresh.  The terror was so very close.  Then Blackie remembered another excavation, just like the one his nest was in, a little off his course to the left, and he tacked towards it, twisting his course wonderfully, thanks to the long tail.  And the owl lost a foot on the turn.  I think it was expecting Blackie to make for the hedge at all costs.  But, be that as it may, that foot was never made up again, for Blackie vanished into the trench next instant, like a blown-out light, and, though the hunter searched for him carefully, he never put in an appearance again while that owl was within sight of the place.  [Illustration: \"The owl lost a foot on the turn\"]  All signs of uproar on the passing of the little owl had died down some time before Blackie turned up again, and then it was in the garden, so he must have got from the tunnel unseen.  He still hung gamely to the food for his young, and now made another attempt to deliver that food where it belonged.  He was half-way there, indeed, before he saw the boys--three boys--with two rows of birds' eggs threaded on strings.  They were passing so close to the trench that one nearly fell into it, and, of course, any one could see that they were bird-nesting.  Blackie swerved off sharply to the far hedge, his heart nearly bursting with anxiety, little knowing that the boys had never even thought of looking in the trench for nests.  It seemed the last place in the world to find one.  It may have been, moreover, that he feared that his wife was home, in which case she might have lost her head, and, dashing out with a scream, \"blown the whole gaff,\" as they say in the vernacular.  Apparently madam was not at home, by good luck, for the boys passed, and Blackie once more executed the magic of getting into his nest without seeming to do so.  And here he stayed.  Dusk was setting in, and his young were fourteen days old.  They showed it in their disobedience, and were not in the least inclined to keep as quiet as they should, considering their father had but just warned them, in his own way, to \"lie doggo,\" because of the gray shape he had seen sliding out into the field, a gray shape which was a cat.  They were more like thrushes than blackbirds, those youngsters, with their speckly fawn breasts; and they were not like the adults of either in their frog-like attitudes and heavy ways.  Frankly, they were not beautiful, even at that stage; and a fortnight before, when they had been larger than the eggs they had come out of, they were positively reptilian and repulsive.  Blackie said the blackbird equivalent to \"Be quiet, you little fools!\" as quietly and as sternly as he could three or four times, and perched on the top of a wheelbarrow to watch the gray shadow which was a cat. That sudden death, however, was more afraid of the open than Blackie, even, and, moreover, wasn't expecting blackbirds' nests in the middle of fields.  It turned back; and at length Mrs. Blackie, who had been on a general survey round about to see what foes of the night were on the move--and a fine hubbub she had made in the process--came home, reporting all well.  Then they slept; at least, they ceased to be any further seen or heard. Think, however, how you would sleep if every few minutes you could hear sounds in your house one-third of which were probably the noises of a burglar.  Think, also, how you would feel if you knew that that burglar was a murderer, and that that murderer was, in all"]]]
