Then, all at once out of the murky darkness into which we were peering, looked a little eye of light--once, twice, thrice it winked at us from low down upon the oily water; then was gone.  \"It's Weymouth with the cutter,\" said Fletcher; \"they are ready ... now for Jon Ki's.\"  We stumbled back up the slight acclivity beneath the archway to the street, leaving the ruinous gates as we had found them. Into the uninviting little alley immediately opposite we plunged, and where the faint yellow luminance showed upon the muddy path before us, Fletcher paused a moment, whispering to me warningly.  \"Don't speak if you can help it,\" he said; \"if you do, mumble any old jargon in any language you like, and throw in plenty of cursing!\"  He grasped me by the arm, and I found myself crossing the threshold of the Joy-Shop--I found myself in a meanly furnished room no more than twelve feet square and very low ceiled, smelling strongly of paraffin oil. The few items of furniture which it contained were but dimly discernible in the light of a common tin lamp which stood upon a packing-case at the head of what looked like cellar steps.  Abruptly, I pulled up; for this stuffy little den did not correspond with pre-conceived ideas of the place for which we were bound. I was about to speak when Fletcher nipped my arm--and out from the shadows behind the packing-case a little bent figure arose!  I started violently, for I had had no idea that another was in the room. The apparition proved to be a Chinaman, and judging from what I could see of him, a very old Chinaman, his bent figure attired in a blue smock. His eyes were almost invisible amidst an intricate map of wrinkles which covered his yellow face.  \"Evening, John,\" said Fletcher--and, pulling me with him, he made for the head of the steps.  As I came abreast of the packing-case, the Chinaman lifted the lamp and directed its light fully upon my face.  Great as was the faith which I reposed in my make-up, a doubt and a tremor disturbed me now, as I found myself thus scrutinized by those cunning old eyes looking out from the mask-like, apish face. For the first time the Chinaman spoke.  \"You blinger fliend, Charlie?\" he squeaked in a thin, piping voice.  \"Him play piecee card,\" replied Fletcher briefly. \"Good fellow, plenty much money.\"  He descended the steps, still holding my arm, and I perforce followed him. Apparently John's scrutiny and Fletcher's explanation respecting me, together had proved satisfactory; for the lamp was replaced upon the lid of the packing-case, and the little bent figure dropped down again into the shadows from which it had emerged.  \"Allee lightee,\" I heard faintly as I stumbled downward in the wake of Fletcher.  I had expected to find myself in a cellar, but instead discovered that we were in a small square court with the mist of the night about us again. On a doorstep facing us stood a duplicate of the lamp upon the box upstairs. Evidently this was designed to indicate the portals of the Joy-Shop, for Fletcher pushed open the door, whose threshold accommodated the lamp, and the light of the place beyond shone out into our faces. We entered and my companion closed the door behind us.  Before me I perceived a long low room lighted by flaming gas-burners, the jets hissing and spluttering in the draught from the door, for they were entirely innocent of shades or mantles. Wooden tables, their surfaces stained with the marks of countless wet glasses, were ranged about the place, café fashion; and many of these tables accommodated groups, of nondescript nationality for the most part. One or two there were in a distant corner who were unmistakably Chinamen; but my slight acquaintance with the races of the East did not enable me to classify the greater number of those whom I now saw about me. There were several unattractive-looking women present.  Fletcher walked up the center of the place, exchanging nods of recognition with two hang-dog poker-players, and I was pleased to note that our advent had apparently failed to attract the slightest attention. Through an opening on the right-hand side of the room, near the top, I looked into a smaller apartment, occupied exclusively by Chinese. They were playing some kind of roulette and another game which seemed wholly to absorb their interest. I ventured no more than a glance, then passed on with my companion.  \"_Fan-tan!_\" he whispered in my ear.  Other forms of gambling were in progress at some of the tables; and now Fletcher silently drew my attention to yet a third dimly lighted apartment--this opening out from the left-hand corner of the principal room. The atmosphere of the latter was sufficiently abominable; indeed, the stench was appalling; but a wave of choking vapor met me as I paused for a moment at the threshold of this inner sanctuary. I formed but the vaguest impression of its interior; the smell was sufficient. This annex was evidently reserved for opium-smokers.  Fletcher sat down at a small table near by, and I took a common wooden chair which he thrust forward with his foot. I was looking around at the sordid scene, filled with a bitter sense of my own impotency to aid my missing friend, when that occurred which set my heart beating wildly at once with hope and excitement. Fletcher must have seen something of this in my attitude, for--  \"Don't forget what I told you,\" he whispered. \"Be cautious!--be very cautious!...\"    CHAPTER VIII  ZARMI OF THE JOY-SHOP   Down the center of the room came a girl carrying the only ornamental object which thus far I  had seen in the Joy-Shop; a large Oriental brass tray. She was a figure which must have formed a center of interest in any place, trebly so, then, in such a place as this. Her costume consisted in a series of incongruities, whilst the entire effect was barbaric and by no means unpicturesque. She wore high-heeled red slippers, and, as her short gauzy skirt rendered amply evident, black silk stockings. A brilliantly colored Oriental scarf was wound around her waist and knotted in front, its tasseled ends swinging girdle fashion. A sort of chemise--like the _'anteree_ of Egyptian women--completed her costume, if I except a number of barbaric ornaments, some of them of silver, with which her hands and arms were bedecked.  But strange as was the girl's attire, it was to her face that my gaze was drawn irresistibly. Evidently, like most of those around us, she was some kind of half-caste; but, unlike them, she was wickedly handsome. I use the adverb _wickedly_ with deliberation; for the pallidly dusky, oval face, with the full red lips, between which rested a large yellow cigarette, and the half-closed almond-shaped eyes, possessed a beauty which might have appealed to an artist of one of the modern perverted schools, but which filled me less with admiration than horror. For I _knew_ her--I recognized her, from a past, brief meeting; I knew her, beyond all possibility of doubt, to be one of the Si-Fan group!  This strange creature, tossing back her jet-black, frizzy hair, which was entirely innocent of any binding or ornament, advanced along the room towards us, making unhesitatingly for our table, and carrying her lithe body with the grace of a _Gházeeyeh_.  I glanced at Fletcher across the table.  \"Zarmi!\" he whispered.  Again I raised my eyes to the face which now was close to mine, and became aware that I was trembling with excitement....  Heavens! why did enlightenment come too late! Either I was the victim of an odd delusion, or Zarmi had been the driver of the cab in which Nayland Smith had left the New Louvre Hotel!  Zarmi place the brass tray upon the table and bent down, resting her elbows upon it, her hands upturned and her chin nestling in her palms. The smoke from the cigarette, now held in her fingers, mingled with her disheveled hair. She looked fully into my face, a long, searching look; then her lips parted in the slow, voluptuous smile of the Orient. Without moving her head she turned the wonderful eyes (rendered doubly luminous by the _kohl_ with which her lashes and lids were darkened) upon Fletcher.  \"What you and your strong friend drinking?\" she said softly.  Her voice possessed a faint husky note which betrayed her Eastern parentage, yet it had in it the siren lure which is the ancient heritage of the Eastern woman--a heritage more ancient than the tribe of the _Ghâzeeyeh_, to one of whom I had mentally likened Zarmi.  \"Same thing,\" replied Fletcher promptly; and raising his hand, he idly toyed with a huge gold ear-ring which she wore.  Still resting her elbows upon the table and bending down between us, Zarmi turned her slumbering, half-closed black eyes again upon me, then slowly, languishingly, upon Fletcher. She replaced the yellow cigarette between her lips. He continued to toy with the ear-ring.  Suddenly the girl sprang upright, and from its hiding-place within the silken scarf, plucked out a Malay _krîs_ with a richly jeweled hilt. Her eyes now widely opened and blazing, she struck at my companion!  I half rose from my chair, stifling a cry of horror; but Fletcher, regarding her fixedly, never moved ... and Zarmi stayed her hand just as the point of the dagger had reached his throat!  \"You see,\" she whispered softly but intensely, \"how soon I can kill you.\"  Ere I had overcome the amazement and horror with which her action had filled me, she had suddenly clutched me by the shoulder, and, turning from Fletcher, had the point of the _krîs_ at _my_ throat!  \"You, too!\" she whispered, \"you too!\"  Lower and lower she bent, the needle point of the weapon pricking my skin, until her beautiful, evil face almost touched mine. Then, miraculously, the fire died out of her eyes; they half closed again and became languishing, luresome _Ghâzeeyeh_ eyes. She laughed softly, wickedly, and puffed cigarette smoke into my face."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17959"],["title","The Hand of Fu-Manchu (#7)"],["body","her dagger into her waist-belt, and snatching up the brass tray, she swayed down the room, chanting some barbaric song in her husky Eastern voice.  I inhaled deeply and glanced across at my companion. Beneath the make-up with which I had stained my skin, I knew that I had grown more than a little pale.  \"Fletcher!\" I whispered, \"we are on the eve of a great discovery--that girl ...\"  I broke off, and clutching the table with both hands, sat listening intently. From the room behind me, the opium-room, whose entrance was less than two paces from where we sat, came a sound of dragging and tapping! Slowly, cautiously, I began to turn my head; when a sudden outburst of simian chattering from the _fan-tan_ players drowned that other sinister sound.  \"You heard it, Doctor!\" hissed Fletcher.  \"The man with the limp!\" I said hoarsely; \"he is in there! Fletcher! I am utterly confused. I believe this place to hold the key to the whole mystery, I believe ...\"  Fletcher gave me a warning glance--and, turning anew, I saw Zarmi approaching with her sinuous gait, carrying two glasses and jug upon the ornate tray. These she set down upon the table; then stood spinning the salver cleverly upon the point of her index finger and watching us through half-closed eyes.  My companion took out some loose coins, but the girl thrust the proffered payment aside with her disengaged hand, the salver still whirling upon the upraised finger of the other.  \"Presently you pay for drink,\" she said. \"You do something for me--eh?\"  \"Yep,\" replied Fletcher nonchalantly, watering the rum in the tumblers. \"What time?\"  \"Presently I tell you. You stay here. This one a strong feller?\"-- indicating myself.  \"Sure,\" drawled Fletcher; \"strong as a mule he is.\"  \"All right. I give him one little kiss if he good boy!\"  Tossing the tray in the air she caught it, rested its edge upon her hip, turned, and walked away down the room, puffing her cigarette.  \"Listen,\" I said, bending across the table, \"it was Zarmi who drove the cab that came for Nayland Smith to-day!\"  \"My God!\" whispered Fletcher, \"then it was nothing less than the hand of Providence that brought us here to-night. Yes! I know how you feel, Doctor!--but we must play our cards as they're dealt to us. We must wait--wait.\"  Out from the den of the opium-smokers came Zarmi, one hand resting upon her hip and the other uplifted, a smoldering yellow cigarette held between the first and second fingers. With a movement of her eyes she summoned us to join her, then turned and disappeared again through the low doorway.  The time for action was arrived--we were to see behind the scenes of the Joy-Shop! Our chance to revenge poor Smith even if we could not save him. I became conscious of an inward and suppressed excitement; surreptitiously I felt the hilt of the Browning pistol in my pocket. The shadow of the dead Fu-Manchu seemed to be upon me. God! how I loathed and feared that memory!  \"We can make no plans,\" I whispered to Fletcher, as together we rose from the table; \"we must be guided by circumstance.\"  In order to enter the little room laden with those sickly opium fumes we had to lower our heads. Two steps led down into the place, which was so dark that I hesitated, momentarily, peering about me.  Apparently some four of five persons squatted and lay in the darkness about me. Some were couched upon rough wooden shelves ranged around the walls, others sprawled upon the floor, in the center whereof, upon a small tea-chest, stood a smoky brass lamp. The room and its occupants alike were indeterminate, sketchy; its deadly atmosphere seemed to be suffocating me. A sort of choking sound came from one of the bunks; a vague, obscene murmuring filled the whole place revoltingly.  Zarmi stood at the further end, her lithe figure silhouetted against the vague light coming through an open doorway. I saw her raise her hand, beckoning to us.  Circling around the chest supporting the lamp we crossed the foul den and found ourselves in a narrow, dim passage-way, but in cleaner air.  \"Come,\" said Zarmi, extending her long, slim hand to me.  I took it, solely for guidance in the gloom, and she immediately drew my arm about her waist, leant back against my shoulder and, raising her pouted red lips, blew a cloud of tobacco smoke fully into my eyes!  Momentarily blinded, I drew back with a muttered exclamation. Suspecting what I did of this tigerish half-caste, I could almost have found it in my heart to return her savage pleasantries with interest.  As I raised my hands to my burning eyes, Fletcher uttered a sharp cry of pain. I turned in time to see the girl touch him lightly on the neck with the burning tip of her cigarette.  \"You jealous, eh, Charlie?\" she said. \"But I love you, too--see! Come along, you strong fellers....\"  And away she went along the passage, swaying her hips lithely and glancing back over her shoulders in smiling coquetry.  Tears were still streaming from my eyes when I found myself standing in a sort of rough shed, stone-paved, and containing a variety of nondescript rubbish. A lantern stood upon the floor; and beside it ...  The place seemed to be swimming around me, the stone floor to be heaving beneath my feet....  Beside the lantern stood a wooden chest, some six feet long, and having strong rope handles at either end. Evidently the chest had but recently been nailed up. As Zarmi touched it lightly with the pointed toe of her little red slipper I clutched at Fletcher for support.  Fletcher grasped my arm in a vice-like grip. To him, too, had come the ghastly conviction--the gruesome thought that neither of us dared to name.  It was Nayland Smith's coffin that we were to carry!  \"Through here,\" came dimly to my ears, \"and then I tell you what to do....\"  Coolness returned to me, suddenly, unaccountably. I doubted not for an instant that the best friend I had in the world lay dead there at the feet of the hellish girl who called herself Zarmi, and I knew since it was she, disguised, who had driven him to his doom, that she must have been actively concerned in his murder.  But, I argued, although the damp night air was pouring in through the door which Zarmi now held open, although sound of Thames-side activity came stealing to my ears, we were yet within the walls of the Joy-Shop, with a score or more Asiatic ruffians at the woman's beck and call....  With perfect truth I can state that I retain not even a shadowy recollection of aiding Fletcher to move the chest out on to the brink of the cutting--for it was upon this that the door directly opened. The mist had grown denser, and except a glimpse of slowly moving water beneath me, I could discern little of our surrounding.  So much I saw by the light of a lantern which stood in the stern of a boat. In the bows of this boat I was vaguely aware of the presence of a crouched figure enveloped in rugs--vaguely aware that two filmy eyes regarded me out of the darkness. A man who looked like a lascar stood upright in the stern.  I must have been acting like a man in a stupor; for I was aroused to the realities by the contact of a burning cigarette with the lobe of my right ear!  \"Hurry, quick, strong feller!\" said Zarmi softly.  At that it seemed as though some fine nerve of my brain, already strained to utmost tension, snapped. I turned, with a wild, inarticulate cry, my fists raised frenziedly above my head.  \"You fiend!\" I shrieked at the mocking Eurasian, \"you yellow fiend of hell!\"  I was beside myself, insane. Zarmi fell back a step, flashing a glance from my own contorted face to that, now pale even beneath its artificial tan, of Fletcher.  I snatched the pistol from my pocket, and for one fateful moment the lust of slaying claimed my mind.... Then I turned towards the river, and, raising the Browning, fired shot after shot in the air.  \"Weymouth!\" I cried. \"Weymouth!\"  A sharp hissing sound came from behind me; a short, muffled cry ... and something descended, crushing, upon my skull. Like a wild cat Zarmi hurled herself past me and leapt into the boat. One glimpse I had of her pallidly dusky face, of her blazing black eyes, and the boat was thrust off into the waterway ... was swallowed up in the mist.  I turned, dizzily, to see Fletcher sinking to his knees, one hand clutching his breast.  \"She got me ... with the knife,\" he whispered. \"But ... don't worry ... look to yourself, and ..._him_....\"  He pointed, weakly--then collapsed at my feet. I threw myself upon the wooden chest with a fierce, sobbing cry.  \"Smith, Smith!\" I babbled, and knew myself no better, in my sorrow, than an hysterical woman. \"Smith, dear old man! speak to me! speak to me!...\"  Outraged emotion overcame me utterly, and with my arms thrown across the box, I slipped into unconsciousness.    CHAPTER IX  FU-MANCHU   Many poignant recollections are mine, more of them bitter than sweet; but no one of them all can compare with the memory of that moment of my awakening.  Weymouth was supporting me, and my throat still tingled from the effects of the brandy which he had forced between my teeth from his flask. My heart was beating irregularly; my mind yet partly inert. With something compound of horror and hope I lay staring at one who was anxiously bending over the Inspector's shoulder, watching me.  _It was Nayland Smith._  A whole hour of silence seemed to pass, ere speech became possible; then--  \"Smith!\" I whispered, \"are you ...\"  Smith grasped my outstretched, questing hand, grasped it firmly, warmly; and I saw his gray eyes to be dim in the light of the several lanterns around us.  \"Am I alive?\" he said. \"Dear old Petrie! Thanks to you, I am not only alive, but free!\"  My head was buzzing like a hive of bees, but I managed, aided by Weymouth, to struggle to my feet. Muffled sounds of shouting and scuffling reached me. Two men in the uniform of the Thames Police were carrying a limp body in at the low doorway communicating with the infernal Joy-Shop.  \"It's"]]]
