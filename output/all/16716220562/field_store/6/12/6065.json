Young _Boisnavis_ singing with elder women of the same class, the middle-aged trying to bring their voices into unison with those of the old. In the midst of the court-yard idle boys fighting, and abusing each other's parents.  These three were the outer _mahals_. Behind these came the three inner ones. The inner _mahal_ behind the _kacheri bari_ was for Nagendra's private use. In that only himself, his wife, and their personal attendants were allowed; also the furniture for their use. This place was new, built by Nagendra himself, and very well arranged. Next to it, and behind the _puja bari_, came another _mahal_; this was old, ill-built, the rooms low, small, and dirty. Here was a whole city-full of female relations, mother's sister and mother's cousin, father's sister and cousin; mother's widowed sister, mother's married sister; father's sister's son's wife, mother's sister's son's daughter. All these female relatives cawing day and night like a set of crows in a banian tree; at every moment screams, laughter, quarrelling, bad reasoning, gossip, reproach, the scuffling of boys, the crying of girls. \"Bring water!\" \"Give the clothes!\" \"Cook the rice!\" \"The child does not eat!\" \"Where is the milk?\" etc., is heard as an ocean of confused sounds. Next to it, behind the _Thakur bari_, was the cook-house. Here a woman, having placed the rice-pot on the fire, gathering up her feet, sits gossiping with her neighbour on the details of her son's marriage. Another, endeavouring to light a fire with green wood, her eyes smarting with the smoke, is abusing the _gomashta_ (factor), and producing abundant proof that he has supplied this wet wood to pocket part of the price. Another beauty, throwing fish into the hot oil, closes her eyes and twists her ten fingers, making a grimace, for oil leaping forth has burnt her skin. One having bathed her long hair, plentifully besmeared with oil, braiding it in a curve on the temples and fastening it in a knot on the top of her head, stirs the pulse cooking in an earthen pot, like Krishna prodding the cows with a stick. Here Bami, Kaymi, Gopal's mother, Nipal's mother, are shredding with a big knife vegetable pumpkins, brinjals, the sound of the cutting steel mingling with abuse of the neighbours, of the masters, of everybody: that Golapi has become a widow very young; that Chandi's husband is a great drunkard; that Koylash's husband has secured a fine appointment as writer to the _Darogah_; that there could not be in the world such a flying journey as that of Gopal, nor such a wicked child as Parvati's; how the English must be of the race of _Ravan_ (the ten-headed king of Ceylon); how _Bhagirati_ had brought _Ganga_; how Sham Biswas was the lover of the daughter of the Bhattacharjyas; with many other subjects. A dark, stout-bodied woman, placing a large _bonti_ (a fish-cutter) on a heap of ashes in the court, is cutting fish; the kites, frightened at her gigantic size and her quick-handedness, keeping away, yet now and again darting forward to peck at the fish. Here a white-haired woman is bringing water; there one with powerful hand is grinding spices. Here, in the storehouse, a servant, a cook, and the store-keeper are quarrelling together; the store-keeper maintaining, \"The _ghi_ (clarified butter) I have given is the right quantity;\" the cook disputing it; the servant saying, \"We could manage with the quantity you give if you left the storehouse unlocked.\" In the hope of receiving doles of rice, many children and beggars with their dogs are sitting waiting. The cats do not flatter any one; they watch their opportunity, steal in, and help themselves. Here a cow without an owner is feasting with closed eyes upon the husks of pumpkins, other vegetables, and fruit.  Behind these three inner _mahals_ is the flower-garden; and further yet a broad tank, blue as the sky. This tank is walled in. The inner house (the women's) has three divisions, and in the flower-garden is a private path, and at each end of the path two doors; these doors are private, they give entrance to the three _mahals_ of the inner house. Outside the house are the stables, the elephant-house, the kennels, the cow-house, the aviaries, etc.  Kunda Nandini, full of astonishment at Nagendra's unbounded wealth, was borne in a palanquin to the inner apartments, where she saluted Surja Mukhi, who received her with a blessing.  Having recognized in Nagendra the likeness of the man she had seen in her dream, Kunda Nandini doubted whether his wife would not resemble the female figure she had seen later; but the sight of Surja Mukhi removed this doubt. Surja Mukhi was of a warm, golden colour, like the full moon; the figure in the dream was dark. Surja Mukhi's eyes were beautiful, but not like those in the dream. They were long deer-eyes, extending to the side hair; the eye-brows joined in a beautiful curve over the dilated, densely black pupils, full but steady. The eyes of the dark woman in the dream were not so enchanting. Then Surja Mukhi's features were not similar. The dream figure was dwarfish; Surja Mukhi rather tall, her figure swaying with the beauty of the honeysuckle creeper. The dream figure was beautiful, but Surja Mukhi was a hundredfold more so. The dream figure was not more than twenty years of age; Surja Mukhi was nearly twenty-six. Kunda saw clearly that there was no resemblance between the two. Surja Mukhi conversed pleasantly with Kunda, and summoned the attendants, to the chief among whom she said, \"This is Kunda with whom I shall give Tara Charan in marriage; therefore see that you treat her as my brother's wife.\"  The servant expressed her assent, and took Kunda aside with her to another place. At sight of her Kunda's flesh crept; a cold moisture came over her from head to foot. The female figure which Kunda in her dream had seen her mother's fingers trace upon the heavens, this servant was that lotus-eyed, dark-complexioned woman.  Kunda, agitated with fear, breathing with difficulty, asked, \"Who are you?\"  The servant answered, \"My name is Hira.\"     CHAPTER VI.  THE READER HAS CAUSE FOR GREAT DISPLEASURE.   At this point the reader will be much annoyed. It is a custom with novelists to conclude with a wedding, but we are about to begin with the marriage of Kunda Nandini. By another custom that has existed from ancient times, whoever shall marry the heroine must be extremely handsome, adorned with all virtues, himself a hero, and devoted to his mistress. Poor Tara Charan possessed no such advantages; his beauty consisted in a copper-tinted complexion and a snub nose; his heroism found exercise only in the schoolroom; and as for his love, I cannot say how much he had for Kunda Nandini, but he had some for a pet monkey.  However that may be, soon after Kunda Nandini's arrival at the house of Nagendra she was married to Tara Charan. Tara Charan took home his beautiful wife; but in marrying a beautiful wife he brought himself into a difficulty.  The reader will remember that Tara Charan had delivered some essays in the house of Debendra Babu on the subjects of women's education and the opening of the zenana. In the discussions that ensued, the Master Babu had said vauntingly: \"Should the opportunity ever be given me, I will be the first to set an example of reform in these matters. Should I marry, I will bring my wife out into society.\"  Now he was married, and the fame of Kunda's beauty had spread through the district. All the neighbours now, quoting an old song, said, \"Where now is his pledge?\" Debendra said, \"What, are you now also in the troop of old fools? Why do you not introduce us to your wife?\"  Tara Charan was covered with shame; he could not escape from Debendra's banter and taunts. He consented to allow Debendra to make the acquaintance of his wife. Then fear arose lest Surja Mukhi should be displeased. A year passed in evasion and procrastination; when, seeing that this could be carried on no longer, he made an excuse that his house was in need of repair, and sent Kunda Nandini to Nagendra's house. When the repairs of the house were completed, Kunda Nandini returned home. A few days after, Debendra, with some of his friends, called upon Tara Charan, and jeered him for his false boasting. Driven thus, as it were, into a corner, Tara Charan persuaded Kunda Nandini to dress in suitable style, and brought her forth to converse with Debendra Babu. How could she do so? She remained standing veiled before him for a few seconds, then fled weeping. But Debendra was enchanted with her youthful grace and beauty. He never forgot it.  Soon after that, some kind of festival was held in Debendra's house, and a little girl was sent thence to Kunda to invite her attendance. But Surja Mukhi hearing of this, forbade her to accept the invitation, and she did not go. Later, Debendra again going to Tara Charan's house, had an interview with Kunda. Surja Mukhi hearing of this through others, gave to Tara Charan such a scolding, that from that time Debendra's visits were stopped.  In this manner three years passed after the marriage; then Kunda Nandini became a widow. Tara Charan died of fever. Surja Mukhi took Kunda to live with her, and selling the house she had given to Tara Charan, gave the proceeds in Government paper to Kunda.  The reader is no doubt much displeased, but in fact the tale is only begun. Of the poison tree the seed only has thus far been sown.     CHAPTER VII.  HARIDASI BOISNAVI.   The widow Kunda Nandini passed some time in Nagendra's house. One afternoon the whole household of ladies were sitting together in the other division of the house, all occupied according to their tastes in the simple employment of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17455"],["title","The Poison Tree: A Tale of Hindu Life in Bengal (#5)"],["body","women. All ages were there, from the youngest girl to the grey-haired woman. One was binding another's hair, the other suffering it to be bound; one submitting to have her white hairs extracted, another extracting them by the aid of a grain of rice; one beauty sewing together shreds of cloth into a quilt for her boy, another suckling her child; one lovely being dressing the plaits of her hair; another beating her child, who now cried aloud, now quietly sobbed, by turns. Here one is sewing carpet-work, another leaning over it in admiring examination. There one of artistic taste, thinking of some one's marriage, is drawing a design on the wooden seats to be used by the bridal pair. One learned lady is reading Dasu Rai's poetry. An old woman is delighting the ears of her neighbours with complaints of her son; a humorous young one, in a voice half bursting with laughter, relates in the ears of her companions whose husbands are absent some jocose story of her husband's, to beguile the pain of separation. Some are reproaching the _Grihini_ (house-mistress), some the _Korta_ (master), some the neighbours; some reciting their own praises. She who may have received a gentle scolding in the morning from Surja Mukhi on account of her stupidity, is bringing forward many examples of her remarkable acuteness of understanding. She in whose cooking the flavours can never be depended upon, is dilating at great length upon her proficiency in the art. She whose husband is proverbial in the village for his ignorance, is astounding her companions by her praises of his superhuman learning. She whose children are dark and repulsive-looking, is pluming herself on having given birth to jewels of beauty. Surja Mukhi was not of the company. She was a little proud, and did not sit much with these people; if she came amongst them her presence was a restraint upon the enjoyment of the rest. All feared her somewhat, and were reserved towards her. Kunda Nandini associated with them; she was amongst them now, teaching a little boy his letters at his mother's request. During the lesson the pupil's eyes were fixed upon the sweetmeat in another child's hand, consequently his progress was not great. At this moment there appeared amongst them a _Boisnavi_ (female mendicant), exclaiming, \"_Jai Radhika!_\"[4] (Victory to Radhika).  [Footnote 4: Wife of Krishna.]  A constant stream of guests was served in Nagendra's _Thakur bari_, and every Sunday quantities of rice were distributed in the same place, but neither _Boisnavis_ nor others were allowed to come to the women's apartments to beg; accordingly, on hearing the cry \"_Jai Radha!_\" in these forbidden precincts, one of the inmates exclaimed: \"What, woman! do you venture to intrude here? go to the _Thakur bari_.\" But even as she spoke, turning to look at the _Boisnavi_, she could not finish her speech, but said instead: \"Oh, ma, what _Boisnavi_ are you?\"  Looking up, all saw with astonishment that the _Boisnavi_ was young and of exceeding beauty; in that group of beautiful women there was none, excepting Kunda Nandini, so beautiful as she. Her trembling lips, well-formed nose, large lotus-eyes, pencilled brows, smooth, well-shaped forehead, arms like the lotus-stalk, and complexion like the _champak_ flower, were rare among women. But had there been present any critic of loveliness, he would have said there was a want of sweetness in her beauty, while in her walk and in her movements there was a masculine character.  The _sandal_ mark[5] on the _Boisnavi's_ nose was long and fine, her hair was braided, she wore a _sari_ with a coloured border, and carried a small tambourine in her hand. She wore brass bracelets, and over them others made of black glass.  [Footnote 5: The caste mark, made with sandal-wood powder.]  One of the elder women addressed her saying, \"Who are you?\"  The _Boisnavi_ replied, \"My name is Haridasi. Will the ladies like a song?\"  The cry, \"Yes, yes! sing!\" sounded on all sides from old and young. Raising her tambourine, the _Boisnavi_ seated herself near the ladies, where Kunda was teaching the little boy. Kunda was very fond of music; on hearing that the _Boisnavi_ would sing she came nearer. Her pupil seized the opportunity to snatch the sweetmeat from the other child's hand, and eat it himself.  The _Boisnavi_ asking what she should sing, the listeners gave a number of different orders. One called for the strains of _Govinda Adhikari_, another _Gopale Ure_. She who was reading Dasu Rai's poem desired to have it sung. Two or three asked for the old stories about Krishna; they were divided as to whether they would hear about the companions or about the separation. Some wanted to hear of his herding the cows in his youth. One shameless girl called out, \"If you do not sing such and such a passage I will not listen.\" One mere child, by way of teaching the _Boisnavi_, sang some nonsensical syllables. The _Boisnavi_, listening to the different demands, gave a momentary glance at Kunda, saying: \"Have you no commands to give?\"  Kunda, ashamed, bent her head smiling, but did not speak aloud; she whispered in the ear of a companion, \"Mention some hymn.\"  The companion said, \"Kunda desires that you will sing a hymn.\" The _Boisnavi_ then began a hymn. Kunda, seeing that the _Boisnavi_ had neglected all other commands to obey hers, was much abashed. Haridasi, striking gently on her tambourine as if in sport, recited in a gentle voice some few notes like the murmuring of a bee in early spring, or a bashful bride's first loving speech to her husband. Then suddenly she produced from that insignificant tambourine, as though with the fingers of a powerful musician, sounds like the crashing of the clouds in thunder, making the frames of her hearers shrink within them as she sang in tones more melodious than those of the _Apsharas_ (celestial singing women).  The ladies, astonished and enchanted, heard the _Boisnavi's_ unequalled voice filling the court with sound that ascended to the skies. What could secluded women understand of the method of that singing? An intelligent person would have comprehended that this perfect singing was not due to natural gifts alone. The _Boisnavi_, whoever she might be, had received a thorough scientific training in music, and, though young, she was very proficient.  The _Boisnavi_, having finished her song, was urged by the ladies to sing again. Haridasi, looking with thirsty eyes at Kunda, sang the following song from Krishna's address to Radhika:  THE BOISNAVI'S SONG.      \"To see thy beauteous lily face     I come expectant to this place;     Let me, oh Rai! thy feet embrace.     To deprecate thy sullen ire,     Therefore I come in strange attire;     Revive me, Radha, kindness speak,     Clasping thy feet my home I'd seek.     Of thy fair form to catch a ray     From door to door with flute I stray;     When thy soft name it murmurs low     Mine eyes with sudden tears o'erflow.     If thou wilt not my pardon speak     The banks of Jumna's stream I'll seek,     Will break my flute and yield my life;     Oh! cease thy wrath, and end the strife.     The joys of Braj I've cast aside     A slave before thy feet t' abide;     Thine anklets round my neck I'll bind,     In Jumna's stream I'll refuge find.\"  The song over, the _Boisnavi_, looking at Kunda, said, \"Singing has made me thirsty; give me some water.\"  Kunda brought water in a vessel; but the _Boisnavi_ said, \"I will not touch your vessel; come near and pour some water into my hands. I was not born a _Boisnavi_.\" By this she gave it to be understood that she was formerly of some unholy caste, and had since become a _Boisnavi_.  In reply to her words, Kunda went behind her so as to pour the water into her hands. They were at such a distance from the rest that words spoken gently could not be heard by any of them. Kunda poured the water, and the _Boisnavi_ washed her hands and face.  While thus engaged the latter murmured, \"Are you not Kunda?\"  In astonishment Kunda replied, \"Why do you ask?\"  \"Have you ever seen your mother-in-law?\"  \"No.\"  Kunda had heard that her mother-in-law, having lost her good name, had left the place.  Then said the _Boisnavi_: \"Your mother-in-law is here now. She is in my house, and is crying bitterly to be allowed to see you for once. She dare not show her face to the mistress of this house. Why should you not go with me to see her? Notwithstanding her fault, she is still your mother-in-law.\"  Although Kunda was simple, she understood quite well that she should not acknowledge any connection with such a relation. Therefore she merely shook her head at the _Boisnavi_'s words and refused her assent. But the _Boisnavi_ would not take a refusal; again she urged the matter.  Kunda replied, \"I cannot go without the _Grihini_'s permission.\"  This Haridasi forbade. \"You must not speak to the house-mistress, she will not let you go; it may be she will send for your _Sasuri_ (mother-in-law). In that case your mother-in-law would flee the country.\"  The more the _Boisnavi_ insisted, the more Kunda refused to go without the _Grihini's_ permission.  Haridasi having no other resource, said: \"Very well, put the thing nicely to the _Grihini_; I will come another day and take you. Mind you put it prudently, and shed some tears also, else she will not consent.\"  Even to this Kunda did not consent; she would not say either \"yes\" or \"no.\"  Haridasi, having finished purifying her face and hands, turned to the ladies and asked for contributions. At this moment Surja Mukhi came amongst them, the desultory talk ceased, and the younger women, all pretending some occupation, sat down.  Surja Mukhi, examining the _Boisnavi_ from head to foot, inquired, \"Who are you?\"  An aunt of Nagendra's explained: \"She is a _Boisnavi_ who came to sing. I never heard such beautiful singing! Will you let her sing for you? Sing something about the goddesses.\"  Haridasi, having sung a beautiful piece about Sham, Surja"]]]
