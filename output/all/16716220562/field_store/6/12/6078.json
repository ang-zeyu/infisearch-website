Come tell me, little man,\" I said,    \"Come tell me, and be brief.\"  Clasping his sister closer still,    He kissed her tear-stained face, And thus, in homely Yorkshire phrase,    He told their mournful case.                ------  \"Mi mammy, sir, shoos liggin thear,    I' th' shut-up bed i' th' nook; An' tho aw've tried to wakken her,    Shoo'll nawther spaik nor look.  Mi sissy wants her poridge,    An' its time shoo had em too, But th' foir's gooan aght an' th' mail's all done--    Aw dooant know what to do.  An' O, my mammy's varry cold--    Just come an' touch her arm: Aw've done mi best to hap her up,    But connot mak her warm.  Mi daddy he once fell asleep,    An' niver wakken'd moor: Aw saw 'em put him in a box,    An' tak him aght o' th' door.  He niver comes to see us nah,    As once he used to do, An' let'mi ride upon his back--    Me, an' mi sissy too.  An' if they know mi mammy sleeps,    Soa cold, an' white, an' still, Aw'm feeard they'll come an' fotch her, sir;    O, sir, aw'm feard they will!  Aw happen could get on misen,    For aw con work a bit, But little sissy, sir, yo see,    Shoo's' varra young as yet.  Oh! dunnot let fowk tak mi mam!    Help me to rouse her up! An' if shoo wants her physic,    See,--it's in this little cup.  Aw know her heead war bad last neet,    When putting us to bed; Shoo said, 'God bless yo, little things!'    An' that wor all shoo said.  Aw saw a tear wor in her e'e--    In fact, it's seldom dry: Sin daddy went shoo allus cries,    But niver tells us why.  Aw think it's coss he isn't here,    'At maks her e'en soa dim; Shoo says, he'll niver come to us,    But we may goa to him.  But if shoo's gooan an' left us here,    What mun we do or say?-- We cannot follow her unless,    Somebody 'll show us th' way.\"               ----  My heart was full to bursting,    When I heard the woeful tale; I gazed a moment on the face    Which death had left so pale;  Then clasping to my heaving breast    The little orphan pair, I sank upon my bended knees,    And offered up a prayer,  That God would give me power to aid    Those children in distress, That I might as a father be    Unto the fatherless.  Then coaxingly I led them forth;    And as the road was long, I bore them in my arms by turns--    Their tears had made me strong.  I took them to my humble home,    Where now they may be seen, The lad,--a noble-minded youth,--    His \"sissy,\"--beauty's queen.  And now if you should chance to see,    Far from the bustling throng, An old man, whom a youth and maid    Lead tenderly along;--  And if you, wondering, long to know    The history of the three,-- They are the little orphan pair--    The poor old man is me:  And on the little grassy mound    'Neath which their parents sleep, They bend the knee, and pray for me;    I pray for them and weep.   Aght o' Wark  Aw've been laikin for ommost eight wick,    An' aw can't get a day's wark to do! Aw've trailed abaght th' streets wol awm sick    An' aw've worn mi clog-soils ommost through.  Aw've a wife an' three childer at hooam,    An' aw know they're all lukkin at th' clock, For they think it's high time aw should come,    An' bring 'em a morsel 'o jock.  A'a dear! it's a pitiful case    When th' cubbord is empty an' bare; When want's stamped o' ivery face,    An' yo hav'nt a meal yo can share.  Today as aw walked into th' street,    Th' squire's carriage went rattlin past; An' aw thout 'at it hardly luk'd reet,    For aw had'nt brokken mi fast.  Them horses, aw knew varry weel,    Wi' ther trappins all shinin i' gold, Had nivver known th' want of a meal,    Or a shelter to keep 'em thro' th' cold.  Even th' dogs have enuff an' to spare,    Tho' they ne'er worked a day i' ther life; But ther maisters forget they should care    For a chap 'at's three bairns an' a wife.  They give dinners at th' hall ivery neet,    An' ther's carriages stand in bi'th scoor, An' all th' windows are blazin wi leet,    But they seldom give dinners to th' poor.  I' mi pocket aw hav'nt a rap,    Nor a crust, nor a handful o' mail; An' unless we can get it o'th strap,    We mun pine, or mun beg, or else stail.  But hoamwards aw'll point mi owd clogs    To them three little lambs an' ther dam;-- Aw wish they wor horses or dogs,    For its nobbut poor fowk 'at's to clam.  But they say ther is One 'at can see,    An' has promised to guide us safe through; Soa aw'll live on i'hopes, an' surelee,    He'll find a chap summat to do.   Another Babby  Another!--well, my bonny lad,    A'w wodn't send thee back; Altho' we thowt we hadn't raam,    Tha's fun some in a crack.  It maks me feel as pleased as punch    To see thi pratty face; Ther's net another child i'th bunch    Moor welcome to a place  Aw'st ha' to fit a peark for thee,    I' some nook o' mi cage; But if another comes, raylee!    Aw'st want a bigger wage.  But aw'm noan feard tha'll ha' to want--    We'll try to pool thee throo, For Him who has mi laddie sent,    He'll send his baggin too.  He hears the little sparrows chirp,    An' answers th' raven's call; He'll never see one want for owt,    'At's worth aboon 'em all.  But if one on us mun goa short,    (Although it's hard to pine,) Thy little belly shall be fill'd    Whativer comes o' mine.  A chap con nobbut do his best,    An' that aw'll do for thee, Leavin to providence all th' rest,    An' we'st get help'd, tha'll see.  An' if thi lot's as bright an' fair    As aw could wish it, lad, Tha'll come in for a better share    Nor iver blessed thi dad.  Aw think aw'st net ha' lived for nowt,    If, when deeath comes, aw find Aw leave some virtuous lasses    An' some honest lads behind.  An' tho' noa coat ov arms may grace    For me, a sculptor'd stooan, Aw hope to leave a noble race,    Wi arms o' flesh an' booan.  Then cheer up, lad, tho' things luk black,    Wi' health, we'll persevere, An' try to find a brighter track--    We'll conquer, niver fear!  An may God shield thee wi' his wing,    Along life's stormy way, An' keep thi heart as free throo sin,    As what it is to-day.   Th' Little Black Hand  Ther's a spark just o'th tip o' mi pen, An' it may be poetical fire; An' suppoase 'at it is'nt--what then? Wod yo bawk a chap ov his desire?  Aw'm detarmined to scribble away-- Soa's them 'at's a fancy con read; An' tho aw turn neet into day, If aw'm suitin an odd en, neer heed!  Aw own ther's mich pleasure i' life; But then ther's abundance o' care, An' them 'at's contented wi' strife May allus mak sure o' ther share.  But aw'll laff woll mi galluses braik, Tho mi bed's net as soft as spun silk; An' if butter be aght o' mi raik, Aw'll ma' th' best ov a drop o' churn milk.  It's nooan them 'at's getten all th' brass 'At's getten all th' pleasure, net it! When aw'm smookin a pipe wi' th' owd lass, Aw con thoil 'em whativer they get.  But sometimes when aw'm walkin throo th' street, An' aw see fowk hauf-clam'd, an' i' rags, Wi noa bed to lig daan on at neet But i'th' warkus, or th' cold-lukkin flags;  Then aw think, if rich fowk nobbut' knew What ther brothers i' poverty feel, They'd a trifle moor charity show, An' help 'em sometimes to a meal.  But we're all far too fond of ussen, To bother wi' things aght o'th' seet; An' we leeav to ther fate sich as them 'At's noa bed nor noa supper' at neet.  But ther's mony a honest heart throbs, Tho' it throbs under rags an' i' pains, 'At wod'nt disgrace one o'th' nobs, 'At booasts better blooid in his veins.  See that child thear! 'at's working away, An' sweepin that crossin i'th' street: He's been thear iver sin it coom day, An' yo'll find him thear far into th' neet.  See what hundreds goa thowtlessly by, An' ne'er think o' that child wi' his broom! What care they tho' he smothered a sigh, Or wiped off a tear as they coom.  But luk! thear's a man wi' a heart! He's gien th' poor child summat at last: Ha his een seem to twinkle an' start, As he watches th' kind gentleman past!  An' thear in his little black hand He sees a gold sovereign shine! He thinks he ne'er saw owt soa grand, An' he says, \"Sure it connot be mine!\"  An' all th' lads cluther raand him i' glee, An' tell him to cut aght o'th seet; But he clutches it fast,--an' nah see Ha he's threedin his way along th' street,  Till he comes to that varry same man, An' he touches him gently o'th' back, An' he tells him as weel as he can, 'At he fancies he's made a mistak.  An' th' chap luks at that poor honest lad, With his little naked feet, as he stands, An' his heart oppens wide--he's soa glad Woll he taks one o'th little black hands,  An' he begs him to tell him his name: But th' child glances timidly raand-- Poor craytur! he connot forshame To lift up his een off o'th graand.  But at last he finds courage to spaik, An' he tells him they call him poor Joa; 'At his mother is sickly an' waik; An' his father went deead long ago;  An' he's th' only one able to work Aght o' four; an' he does what he can, Thro' early at morn till it's dark: An' he hopes 'at he'll sooin be a man.  An' he tells him his mother's last word, As he starts for his labour for th' day, Is to put 'all his trust in the Lord, An' He'll net send him empty away.--  See that man! nah he's wipin his een, An' he gives him that bright piece o' gowd; An' th' lad sees i' that image o'th Queen What 'll keep his poor mother thro' th' cowd.  An' mony a time too, after then, Did that gentleman tak up his stand At that crossing an' watch for hissen The work ov that little black hand.  An' when-years had gone by, he expressed 'At i'th' spite ov all th' taichin he'd had, An' all th' lessons he'd leearn'd, that wor th' best 'At wor towt by that poor little lad.  Tho' the proud an' the wealthy may prate, An' booast o' ther riches and land, Some o'th' laadest ul sink second-rate To that lad with his little black hand.

Why some despise it, aw can't tell, It's plain to understand; An' sure aw am it saands as weel, Tho happen net soa grand.

Shoo's thi Sister  (Written on seeing a wealthy townsman rudely push a poor little girl off the pavement.)  Gently, gently, shoo's thi sister,    Tho' her clooas are nowt but rags; On her feet ther's monny a blister:    See ha painfully shoo drags Her tired limbs to some quiet corner: Shoo's thi sister--dunnot scorn her.  Daan her cheeks noa tears are runnin,    Shoo's been shov'd aside befoor; Used to scoffs, an' sneers, an'shunnin--    Shoo expects it, coss shoo's poor; Schooil'd for years her grief to smother, Still shoos human--tha'rt her brother.  Tho' tha'rt donn'd i' fine black cloathin, A kid glove o' awther hand, Dunnot touch her roughly, loathin-- Shoo's thi sister, understand: Th' wind maks merry wi' her tatters, Poor lost pilgrim!--but what matters?  Lulk ha sharp her elbow's growin,    An' ha pale her little face, An' her hair neglected, showin    Her's has been a sorry case; O, mi heart felt sad at th' seet, When tha shov'd her into th' street  Ther wor once a \"Man,\" mich greater    Nor thisen wi' all thi brass, Him, awr blessed Mediator,--    Wod He scorn that little lass? Noa, He called 'em, an' He blessed 'em, An' His hands divine caress'd 'em.  Goa thi ways I an' if tha bears net    Some regret for what tha's done, If tha con pass on, an' cares net    For that sufferin' little one; Then ha'iver poor shoo be, Yet shoos rich compared wi' thee.  Oh! 'at this breet gold should blind us,    To awr duties here below! For we're forced to leave behind us    All awr pomp, an' all awr show: Why then should we slight another? Shoo's thi sister, unkind brother.   Persevere.  What tho' th' claads aboon luk dark,    Th' sun's just waitin to peep throo, Let us buckle to awr wark,    For ther's lots o' jobs to do: Tho' all th' world luks dark an' drear,    Let's ha' faith, an' persevere.  He's a fooil 'at sits an' mumps    'Coss some troubles hem him raand! Man mud allus be i'th dumps,    If he sulk'd coss fortun fraand; Th' time 'll come for th' sky to clear:--    Let's ha' faith, an' persevere.  If we think awr lot is hard,    Niver let us mak a fuss; Lukkin raand, at ivery yard,    We'st find others war nor us; We have still noa cause to fear! Let's ha' faith, an' persevere.  A faint heart, aw've heeard 'em say,    Niver won a lady fair: Have a will! yo'll find a way!    Honest men ne'er need despair. Better days are drawin' near:-- Then ha' faith, an' persevere.  Workin men,--nah we've a voice,    An' con help to mak new laws; Let us iver show awr choice    Lains to strengthen virtue's cause, Wrangs to reighten,--griefs to cheer; This awr motto--'persevere.'  Let us show to foreign empires    Loyalty's noa empty booast; We can scorn the thirsty vampires    If they dar molest awr cooast: To awr Queen an' country dear Still we'll cling an' persevere.  But as on throo life we hurry,    By whativer path we rooam, Let us ne'er forget i'th' worry,    True reform begins at hooam: Then, to prove yorsens sincere, Start at once; an' persevere.  Hard wark, happen yo may find it,    Some dear folly to forsake, Be detarmined ne'er to mind it!    Think, yor honor's nah at stake. Th' gooid time's drawin varry near! Then ha' faith, an' persevere.   To a Roadside Flower  Tha bonny little pooasy! aw'm inclined       To tak thee wi' me: But yet aw think if tha could spaik thi mind,       Tha'd ne'er forgie me; For I' mi jacket button-hoil tha'd quickly dee, An' life is short enough, boath for mi-sen an' thee.  Here, if aw leeave thee bi th' rooadside to flourish,       Whear scoors may pass thee, Some heart 'at has few other joys to cherish       May stop an' bless thee: Then bloom, mi little pooasy! Tha'rt a beauty, Sent here to bless: Smile on--tha does thi duty.  Aw wodn't rob another of a joy       Sich as tha's gien me; For aw felt varry sad, mi little doy       Until aw'd seen thee. An' may each passin', careworn, lowly brother, Feel cheered like me, an' leave thee for another.   Prose. Hartley's Cream of Wit and Humour  The New Year  What a charm ther is abaat owt new; whether it's a new year or a new waist-coit.  Aw sometimes try to fancy what sooart ov a world ther'd be if ther wor nowt new.  Solomon sed ther wor nowt new under th' sun; an' he owt to know if onybody did.  Maybe he wor reight if we luk at it i' some ways, but aw think it's possible to see it in another leet.  If ther wor nowt new, ther'd be nowt to hooap for--nowt to live for but to dee; an' we should lang for that time to come just for th' sake ov a change.  Ha anxiously a little child looks forrard to th' time when he's to have a new toy, an' ha he prizes it at furst when he's getten it: but in a while he throws it o' one side an' cries fur summat new.  Ha he langs to be as big as his brother, soa's he can have a new bat an' ball; an' his brother langs for th' time when he can leeave schooil an' goa work for his livin'; an' varry likely his fayther's langin' for th' time when he can live withaat workin'--all on 'em langin for summat new. Langill' for things new doesn't prevent us lovin' things at's owd. Who isn't praad ov ther owd fayther, as he sits i' tharm-cheer an' tells long tales abaat what he can remember bein' new?  An' who doesn't feel a soothin' kind ov a feelin' come ovver him when his mother's kindly warnin' falls on his ear, as shoo tells him \"what-iver he does, net to be soa fond ov ivery thing new?\"   What a love fowk get for \"th' owd haase;\" but ther's moor o'th' past nor o'th' futur' i' these feelin's, they're not hopeful, an' its hopeful feelin's at keeps th' world a goin', its hooap at maks us keep o'th' look aat for summat fresh.  Aw've heeard fowk wish for things to keep just as they are, they say they dooant want owt new.  What a mistak' they mak!  They're wishin' for what ud be th' mooast of a novelty.  Things willn't stop as they are, an' it wodn't be reight if they did.  It's all weel enuff for them at's feathered ther nest to feel moderate contented, but them at's sufferin' for want ov a meal's mait are all hopin' for a change for th' better.  Owd hats an' owd slippers are generally more comfortable nor new ens, an' fowk \"wish they'd niver be done,\"--\"they hate owt new\"--as if it wodn't be summat new if they could wear 'em withaat 'em bein' done.
