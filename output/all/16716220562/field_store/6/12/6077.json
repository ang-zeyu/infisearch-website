For nah aw see yor daddy's nigh; He's dropt that strain soa sweet and strong; He loves yo better nor his song--    He does indeed.\"  Aw walk'd away, and sooin mi ear Caught up the saand o' warblin clear; Thinks aw, they're happy once agean; Aw'm glad aw didn't prove so mean    To rob that nest; For they're contented wi ther lot, Nor envied me mi little cot; An' in this world, as we goa throo, It is'nt mich gooid we can do,    An' do awr best.  Then let us do as little wrong To ony as we pass along, An' never seek a joy to gain At's purchased wi another's pain,    It isn't reet. Aw shall goa hooam wi' leeter heart, To mend awr Johnny's little cart: (He allus finds me wark enough To piecen up his brocken stuff,    For every neet.)  An' Sally--a'a! if yo could see her! When aw sit daan to get mi teah, Shoo puts her dolly o' mi knee, An' maks me sing it \"Hush a bee,\"    I'th' rocking chear; Then begs some sugar for it too; What it can't ait shoo tries to do; An' turnin up her cunnin e'e,, Shoo rubs th' doll maath, an says, \"yo see,    It gets its share.\",  Sometimes aw'm rayther cross? aw fear! Then starts a little tremblin tear, 'At, like a drop o' glitt'rin dew Swimmin within a wild flaar blue,    Falls fro ther e'e; But as the sun in April shaars Revives the little droopin flaars, A kind word brings ther sweet smile back: Aw raylee think mi brain ud crack    If they'd ta dee.  Then if aw love my bairns soa weel, May net a skylark's bosom feel As mich consarn for th' little things 'At snooze i'th' shelter which her wings    Soa weel affoards? If fowk wod nobbut bear i' mind How mich is gained by bein' kind, Ther's fewer breasts wi' grief ud swell, An' fewer fowk ud thoughtless mell    Even o'th' burds.   Wayvin Mewsic  Ther's mewsic i'th' shuttle, i'th' loom, an i'th frame, Ther's melody mingled i'th' noise, For th' active ther's praises, for th' idle ther's blame, If they'd hearken to th' saand of its voice; An' when flaggin a bit, ha refreshin to feel As yo pause an luk raand on the throng, At the clank o' the tappet, the hum o' the wheel, Sing this plain unmistakable song:--    Nick a ting, nock a ting;    Wages keep pocketing; Workin for little is better nor laiking;    Twist an' twine, reel an' wind;    Keep a contented mind; Troubles are oft ov a body's own making.  To see workin fowk wi' a smile o' ther face As they labor thear day after day; An' hear 'th women's voices float sweetly throo 'th place, As they join i' some favorite lay; It saands amang th' din, as the violet seems 'At peeps aght th' green dockens among, An' spreading a charm over th' rest by its means, Thus it blends i' that steady old song;    Nick a ting, nock a ting;    Wages keep pocketing; Workin for little is better nor laiking;    Twist an' twine, reel an' wind;    Keep a contented mind; Troubles are oft ov a body's own making.  An' then see what lessons are laid out anent us, As pick after pick follows time after time, An' warns us tho' silent, to let nowt prevent us From strivin by little endeavours to climb; Th' world's made o' trifles! its dust forms a mountain! Then niver despair as you're trudgin along; If troubles will come an' yor spirits dishearten, Yo'll find ther's relief i' that steady old song;    Nick a ting, nock a ting;    Wages keep pocketing; Working for little is better nor laiking;    Twist an' twine, reel an' wind;    Keep a contented mind; Troubles are oft ov a body's own making.  Life's warp comes throo Heaven, th' weft's fun bi us sen; To finish a piece we're compell'd to ha booath. Th' warp's reight, but if th' weft should be faulty--ha then? Noa wayver i' th' world can produce a gooid clooath; Then let us endeavour, bi working and striving, To finish awr piece soa's noa fault can be fun; An' then i' return for awr pains an contriving, Th' takker in 'll reward us an' whisper' well done.'    Clink a clank, clink a clank,    Workin withaat a thank, May be awr fortun--if soa never mind it!    Striving to do awr best,    We shall be reight at last, If we lack comfort nah, then shall we find it.   That's a Fact  A'a Mary aw'm glad 'at that's thee! Aw need thy advice, lass, aw'm sure; Aw'm all ov a mooild tha can see, Aw wor never i' this way afoor, Aw've net slept a wink all th' neet throo; Aw've been twirling abaght like a worm, An' th' blankets gate felter'd, lass, too-- Tha niver saw cloas i' sich form. Aw'll tell thee what 't all wor abaght-- But promise tha'll keep it reight squat, For aw wodn't for th' world let it aght; But aw can't keep it in--tha knows that. We'd a meetin at the schooil yesterneet, An' Jimmy wor thear,--tha's seen Jim? An' he hutch'd cloise to me in a bit, To ax me for th' number o'th' hymn; Aw thowt 't wor a gaumless trick, For he heeard it geen aght th' same as me; An' he just did th' same thing tother wick,-- It made fowk tak noatice, dos't see. An' when aw wor gooin towards hooam Aw heeard som'dy comin behund: 'Twor pitch dark, an' aw thowt if they coom, Aw should varry near sink into th' graund. Aw knew it wor Jim bi his traid, An' aw tried to get aght ov his gate; But a'a! tha minds, lass, aw wor flaid, Aw wor niver i' sich en a state. Then aw felt som'dy's arm raand my shawl, An' aw said, \"nah, leave loise or aw'll screeam! Can't ta let daycent lasses alooan, Consarn thi up! what does ta mean?\" But he stuck to mi arm like a leach, An' he whispered a word i' mi ear; It took booath my breeath an' my speech, For aw'm varry sooin thrown aght o' gear. Then he squeezed me cloise up to his sel, An' he kussed me, i' spite o' mi teeth: Aw says, \"Jimmy, forshame o' thisel!\" As sooin as aw'd getten mi breeath: But he wodn't be quiet, for he said 'At he'd loved me soa true an' soa long-- Aw'd ha' geen a ear off my yed To get loise--but tha knows he's so a strong-- Then he tell'd me he wanted a wife, An' he begged 'at aw wodn't say nay;-- Aw'd ne'er heeard sich a tale i' mi life, Aw wor fesen'd whativer to say; Cos tha knows aw've a likin' for Jim; But yo can't allus say what yo mean, For aw tremeld i' ivery limb, But at last aw began to give way, For, raylee, he made sich a fuss, An aw kussed him an' all--for they say, Ther's nowt costs mich less nor a kuss. Then he left me at th' end o' awr street, An' aw've felt like a fooil all th' neet throo; But if aw should see him to neet, What wod ta advise me to do? But dooant spaik a word--tha's noa need, For aw've made up mi mind ha to act, For he's th' grandest lad iver aw seed, An' aw like him th' best too--that's a fact!   Stop at Hooam  \"Tha wodn't goa an leave me, Jim,    All lonely by mysel? My een at th' varry thowts grow dim--    Aw connot say farewell.  Tha vow'd tha couldn't live unless    Tha saw me every day, An' said tha knew noa happiness    When aw wor foorced a way.  An th' tales tha towld, I know full weel,    Wor true as gospel then; What is it, lad, 'at ma's thee feel    Soa strange--unlike thisen?

An' tho' a claad hangs ovver thee,    (An' trouble's hard to bide), Have patience, lad, an' wait an' see    What's hid o'th' tother side.  If aw wor free to please mi mind,    Aw'st niver mak this stur; But aw've a mother ommust blind,    What mud become o' her?  Tha knows shoo cared for me, when waik    An' helpless ivery limb, Aw'm feeard her poor owd heart ud braik    If aw'd to leave her, Jim.  Aw like to hear thee talk o' th' trees    'At tower up to th' sky, An' th' burds 'at flutterin i'th' breeze,     Lie glitterin' jewels fly.  Woll th' music of a shepherd's reed    May gently float along, Lendin its tender notes to lead    Some fair maid's simple song;  An' flaars 'at grow o' ivery side,    Such as we niver see; But here at hooam, at ivery stride,    There's flaars for thee an' me.  Aw care net for ther suns soa breet,    Nor warblin melody; Th' clink o' thi clogs o' th' flags at neet    Saands sweeter, lad, to me.  An' tho' aw wear a gingham gaan,    A claat is noa disgrace; Tha'll niver find a heart moor warm    Beat under silk or lace.  Then settle daan, tak my advice,    Give up this wish to rooam!

Some sang a song, some cracked a joak, An' all seem'd full o' larkin; An' th' raam war blue wi' bacca smook, An' ivery e'e'd a spark in.  Long Joa 'at comes thro th' Jumples cluff, Wor gettin rayther mazy; An' Warkus Ned had supped enuff To turn they're Betty crazy;-- An Bob at lives at th' Bogeggs farm, Wi' Nan throo th' Buttress Bottom, Wor treating her to summat wanm, (It's just his way,--\"odd drot em!\")  An' Jack o'th' Slade wor theear as weel, An' Joa o' Abe's throo Waerley; An' Lijah off o'th' Lavver Hill, Wor passing th' ale raand rarely.-- Throo raand and square they seem'd to meet, To hear or tell a stoory; But th' gem o' all aw heard last neet Wor one bi Dooad o'th' gloory.

Theear Peter stood wi' keys i' hand: Says he, \"What do you want, sir? If to goa in--yo understand Unknown to me yo can't sir.-- Pray what's your name? where are yo throo?

At last says he, \"Thear's Leeds Taan Hall, An thear stands Braforth mission: It's just between them two--that's all: Your map's an old edition.

Aw should think 'at theease rattlin looms    Saand queer sooart o' music to thee; An' tha'll hardly quite relish th' perfumes    O' miln-grease,--what th' quality be.  Maybe' tha'rt disgusted wi' us,    An' thinks we're a low offald set But tha'rt sadly mistaen if tha does,    For ther's hooap an' ther's pride in us yet.

Uncle Ben  A gradely chap wor uncle Ben    As iver lived ith' fowd: He made a fortun for hissen,    An' lived on't when he'r owd. His yed wor like a snow drift,    An' his face wor red an' breet, An' his heart wor like a feather,    For he did the thing 'at's reet.  He wore th' same suit o' fustian clooas    He'd worn sin aw wor bred; An' th' same owd booits, wi' cappel'd tooas,    An' th' same hat for his yed; His cot wor lowly, yet he'd sing    Throo braik o' day till neet; His conscience niver felt a sting,    For he did the thing 'at's reet.  He wod'nt swap his humble state    Wi' th' grandest fowk i' th' land; He niver wanted silver plate,    Nor owt 'at's rich and grand; He did'nt sleep wi' curtained silk    Drawn raand him ov a neet, But he slept noa war for th' want o' that,    For he'd done the thing 'at's reet.  Owd fowk called him \"awr Benny,\"    Young fowk, \"mi uncle Ben,\"-- An' th' childer, \"gronfather,\" or \"dad,\"    Or what best pleased thersen. A gleam o' joy coom o'er his face    When he heeard ther patterin feet, For he loved to laik wi' th' little bairns    An' he did the thing 'at's reet.  He niver turned poor fowk away    Uncared for throo his door; He ne'er forgate ther wor a day    When he hissen wor poor; An' mony a face has turned to Heaven,    All glistenin wi' weet, An' prayed for blessins on owd Ben,    For he did th' thing 'at's reet.  He knew his lease wor ommost spent,    He'd sooin be called away; Yet he wor happy an' content,    An' waited th' comin day; But one dark neet he shut his e'en,    An' slept soa calm an' sweet, when mornin coom, th' world held one less,    'At did the thing 'at's reet.

Aw dooant want a woman wi' beauty, nor brass,    For aw've nawther to booast on misel; What aw want is a warm-hearted, hard-workin' lass,    An' ther's lots to be fun, aw've heeard tell.  To be single is all weel enuf nah an' then,    But it's awk'ard when th' weshin' day comes; For aw nivver think sooapsuds agree weel wi' men;    They turn all mi ten fingers to thumbs.  An' awm sure it's a fact, long afoor aw get done,    Aw'm slopt throo mi waist to mi fit; An' th' floor's in' a pond, as if th' peggy-tub run,    An' mi back warks as if it 'ud split.  Aw fancied aw'st manage at breead-bakin' best;    Soa one day aw bethowt me to try, But aw gate soa flustered, aw ne'er thowt o'th' yeast,    Soa aw mud as weel offered to fly.  Aw did mak a dumplin', but a'a! dear a me!    Abaght that lot aw hardly dar think; Aw ne'er fan th' mistak' till aw missed th' sooap, yo see,    An' saw th' suet i'th' sooap-box o'th' sink.  But a new-year's just startin', an' soa aw declare    Aw'll be wed if a wife's to be had; For mi clooas is soa ragg'd woll aw'm ommost hauf bare,    An' thease mullucks, they're drivin' me mad.  Soa, if yo should know, or should chonce to hear tell,    Ov a lass 'at to wed is inclined, Talegraft me at once, an' aw'll see her misel    Afoor shoo can alter her mind.\"   The Old Bachelor's Story  It was an humble cottage,    Snug in a rustic lane, Geraniums and fuschias peep'd    From every window-pane;  The dark-leaved ivy dressed its walls,    Houseleek adorned the thatch; The door was standing open wide,    They had no need of latch.  And close besides the corner    There stood an old stone well, Which caught a mimic waterfall,    That warbled as it fell.  The cat, crouched on the well-worn steps,    Was blinking in the sun; The birds sang out a welcome    To the morning just begun.  An air of peace and happiness    Pervaded all the scene; The tall trees formed a back ground    Of rich and varied green;  And all was steeped in quietness,    Save nature's music wild, When all at once, methought I heard    The sobbing of a child.--  I listened, and the sound again    Smote clearly on my ear: \"Can there,\"--I wondering asked myself--    \"Can there be sorrow here?\"--  I looked within, and on the floor    Was sat a little boy, Striving to soothe his sister's grief    By giving her a toy.  \"Why weeps your sister thus?\" I asked;    \"What is her cause "]]]
