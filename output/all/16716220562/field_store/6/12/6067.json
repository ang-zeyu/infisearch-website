I am going to destruction.\"  Hara Deb was very wise. On reading this letter he thought to himself: \"What is this? Anxiety about money? A quarrel with some friend? Debendra Datta? Nothing of the kind. Is this love?\"  Kamal Mani received another letter from Surja Mukhi. It concluded thus: \"Come, Kamal Mani, sister; except you I have no friend. Come to me.\"  Kamal Mani was agitated; she could contain herself no longer. She felt that she must consult her husband.  Srish Chandra, sitting in the inner apartments, was looking over the office account-books. Beside him on the bed, Satish Chandra, a child of a year old, was rejoicing in the possession of an English newspaper. He had first tried to eat it; but, failing in that, had spread it out and was now sitting upon it. Kamal Mani, approaching her husband, brought the end of her _sari_ round her neck, threw herself down, bending her forehead to the floor, and, folding her hands, said, \"I pay my devotions to you, O great king.\" Just before this time, a play had been performed in the house, from whence she borrowed this inflated speech.  Srish said, laughing, \"Have the cucumbers been stolen again?\"  \"Neither cucumbers nor melons; this time a most valuable thing has been stolen.\"  \"Where is the robbery?\" asked Srish.  \"The robbery took place at Govindpur. My elder brother had a broken shell in a golden box. Some one has stolen it.\"  Srish, not understanding the metaphor, said \"Your brother's golden casket is Surja Mukhi. What is the broken shell?\"  \"Surja Mukhi's wits,\" replied Kamal.  \"People say if one has a mind to play he can do so, though the shells are broken\" (referring to a game played with shells). \"If Surja Mukhi's understanding is defective, yet with it she gained your brother's heart, and with all your wisdom, you could not bring him over to your side. Who has stolen the broken shell?\"  \"That I know not; but, from reading her letter, I perceive it is gone--else how could a woman write such a letter?\"  \"May I see the letter?\" asked Srish.  Kamal Mani placed the letter in her husband's hand, saying: \"Surja Mukhi forbade my telling you all this; but while I keep it from you I am quite uneasy. I can neither sleep nor eat, and I fear I may lose my senses.\"  \"If you have been forbidden to tell me of the matter I cannot read this letter, nor do I wish to hear its contents. Tell me what has to be done.\"  \"This is what must be done,\" replied Kamal. \"Surja Mukhi's wits are scattered, and must be restored. There is no one that can do this except Satish Babu. His aunt has written requesting that he may be sent to Govindpur.\"  Satish Babu had in the meantime upset a vase of flowers, and was now aiming at the inkstand. Watching him, Srish Chandra said: \"Yes; he he is well fitted to act as physician. I understand now. He is invited to his aunt's house; if he goes, his mother must go also. Surja Mukhi's wits must be lost, or she could not have sent such an invitation.\"  \"Not Satish Babu only; we are all invited.\"  \"Why am I invited?\" asked Srish.  \"Can I go alone?\" replied Kamal. \"Who will look after the luggage?\"  \"It is very unreasonable in Surja Mukhi if she wants her husband's brother-in-law only that he may look after the luggage. I can find some one else to perform that office for a couple of days.\"  Kamal Mani was angry; she frowned, mocked at Srish Chandra, and, snatching the paper on which he was writing out of his hand, tore it to pieces.  Srish Chandra, smiling, said, \"It serves you right.\"  Kamal, affecting anger, said, \"I will speak in that way if I wish!\"  Srish, in the same tone, replied, \"And I shall speak as I choose!\"  Then a playful scuffle ensued; Kamal pretended to strike her husband, who in return pulled down her hair; whereupon she threw away his ink. Then they exchanged angry kisses. Satish Babu was delighted at this performance; he knew that kisses were his special property, so when he saw them scattered in this lavish manner he stood up, supporting himself by his mother's dress, to claim his royal share, crowing joyously. How sweetly that laugh fell on the ears of Kamal Mani! She took him in her lap, and showered kisses upon him. Srish Chandra followed her example. Then Satish Babu, having received his dues, got down and made for his father's brightly coloured pencil, which soon found its way into his mouth.  In the battle between the _Kurus_ and _Pandus_ there was a great struggle between Bhagadatta and Arjuna. In this fight, Bhagadatta being invincible, and Arjuna vulnerable, the latter called Krishna to his aid, who, receiving the charge of Bhagadatta on his breast, blunted the force of the weapons.[7] In like manner, Satish Chandra having received these attacks on his face, peace was restored. But their peace and war was like the dropping of clouds, fitful.  [Footnote 7: An illustration drawn from the _Mahabharat_.]  Then Srish asked, \"Must you really go to Govindpur? What am I to do alone?\"  \"Do you think I can go alone?\" answered his wife. \"We must both go. Arrange matters in the morning when you go to business, and come home quickly. If you are long, Satish and I will sit crying for you.\"  \"I cannot go,\" replied Srish. \"This is the season for buying linseed. You must go without me.\"  \"Come, Satish,\" was Kamal's reply; \"we two will go and weep.\"  At the sound of his mother's voice Satish ceased to gnaw the pencil, and raised another shout of joyous laughter. So Kamal's cry did not come off this time; in place of it the kissing performance was gone through as before.  At its close Kamal said, \"Now what are your orders?\"  Srish repeated that she must go without him, as he could not leave; whereupon she sat down sulking. Srish went behind her and began to mark her forehead with the ink from his pen.  Then with a laugh she embraced him, saying, \"Oh, dearer than life, how I love you!\"  He was obliged to return the embrace, when the ink transferred itself from her face to his.  The quarrel thus ended, Kamal said, \"If you really will not go, then make arrangements for me.\"  \"When will you come back?\"  \"Need you ask?\" said Kamal; \"if you don't go, can I stay there long?\"  Srish Chandra sent Kamal Mani to Govindpur, but it is certain that Srish Chandra's employers did not do much in linseed at that time. The other clerks have privately informed us that this was the fault of Srish Chandra, who did not give his mind to it, but sat at home in meditation.  Srish hearing himself thus accused, remarked, \"It may be so, my wife was absent at that time.\"  The hearers shook their heads, saying, \"He is under petticoat government!\" which so delighted Srish Chandra that he called to his servant, \"Prepare dinner; these gentlemen will dine with me to-day.\"     CHAPTER XI.  CAUGHT AT LAST.   It was as though a flower had bloomed in the family house at Govindpur. The sight of Kamal Mani's smiling face dried the tears in the eyes of Surja Mukhi. The moment she set foot in the house Kamal took in hand the dressing of her sister-in-law's hair, for Surja Mukhi had neglected herself lately.  Kamal said, \"Shall I put in a flower or two?\"  Surja Mukhi pinched her cheek, and forbade it.  So Kamal Mani did it slily. When people came in she said, \"Do you see the old woman wearing flowers in her hair?\"  But even Kamal's bright face did not dispel the dark clouds from that of Nagendra. When he met her he only said, \"Where do you come from, Kamal?\"  She bent before him, saying bashfully, \"Baby has brought me.\"  \"Indeed! I'll beat the rascal,\" replied Nagendra, taking the child in his arms, and spending an hour in play with him, in return for which the grateful child made free with his moustache.  Kamal Mani playfully accosted Kunda with the words, \"Ha, Kundi, Kundi! Nundi, Dundi! are you quite well, Kundi?\"  The girl was silent in astonishment, but presently she said, \"I am well.\"  \"Call me _Didi_ (elder sister); if you do not I will burn your hair when you are asleep, or else I will give your body to the cockroaches.\"  Kunda obeyed. When she had been in Calcutta she had not addressed Kamal by any name; indeed she had rarely spoken; but seeing that Kamal was very loving-hearted, she had become fond of her. In the years that had intervened without a meeting she had a little forgotten Kamal; but now, both being amiable, their affection was born afresh, and became very close.  When Kamal Mani talked of returning home, Surja Mukhi said, \"Nay, sister, stay a little longer. I shall be wretched when you are gone. It relieves me to talk to you of my trouble.\"  \"I shall not go without arranging your affairs.\"  \"What affairs?\" said Surja Mukhi.  \"Your _Shradda_\" (funeral ceremonies), replied Kamal; but mentally she said, \"Extracting the thorns from your path.\"  When Kunda heard that Kamal talked of going, she went to her room and wept. Kamal going quietly after her found her with her head on the pillow, weeping. Kamal sat down to dress Kunda's hair, an occupation of which she was very fond. When she had finished she drew Kunda's head on to her lap, and wiped away the tears. Then she said, \"Kunda, why do you weep?\"  \"Why do you go away?\" was the reply.  \"Why should you weep for that?\"  \"Because you love me.\"  \"Does no one else love you?\"  Kunda did not reply; and Kamal went on: \"Does not the _Bou_ (Surja Mukhi) love you? No? Don't hide it from me.\" (Still no answer.) \"Does not my brother love you?\" (Still silence.) \"Since I love you and you love me, shall we not go together?\" (Yet Kunda spoke not.) \"Will you go?\"  Kunda shook her head, saying, \"I will not go.\"  Kamal's joyous face became grave; she thought, \"This does not sound well. The girl has the same complaint as my brother, but he suffers the more deeply. My husband is not here, with whom can I take counsel?\" Then Kamal Mani drew Kunda's head lovingly on her breast, and taking hold of her face caressingly, said, \"Kunda, will you tell me"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17456"],["title","The Romance of a Christmas Card (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net                                           _The_                                 ROMANCE                                 _of a_                                CHRISTMAS                                  CARD                                      BY                           KATE DOUGLAS WIGGIN                               ILLUSTRATED BY                            ALICE ERCLE HUNT                             BOSTON _and_ NEW YORK                        HOUGHTON MIFFLIN COMPANY                     The Riverside Press, Cambridge                                   1916            COPYRIGHT, 1915, BY THE BUTTERICK PUBLISHING COMPANY                  COPYRIGHT, 1916, BY KATE DOUGLAS RIGGS     [Illustration: Frontispiece]  The Romance of a Christmas Card     I   It was Christmas Eve and a Saturday night when Mrs. Larrabee, the Beulah minister's wife, opened the door of the study where her husband was deep in the revision of his next day's sermon, and thrust in her comely head framed in a knitted rigolette.  \"Luther, I'm going to run down to Letty's. We think the twins are going to have measles; it's the only thing they haven't had, and Letty's spirits are not up to concert pitch. You look like a blessed old prophet to-night, my dear! What's the text?\"  The minister pushed back his spectacles and ruffled his gray hair.  \"Isaiah VI, 8: '_And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying whom shall I send?... Then said I, Here am I, send me!_'\"  \"It doesn't sound a bit like Christmas, somehow.\"  \"It has the spirit, if it hasn't the sound,\" said the minister. \"There is always so little spare money in the village that we get less and less accustomed to sharing what we have with others. I want to remind the people that there are different ways of giving, and that the bestowing of one's self in service and good deeds can be the best of all gifts. Letty Boynton won't need the sermon!--Don't be late, Reba.\"  \"Of course not. When was I ever late? It has just struck seven and I'll be back by eight to choose the hymns. And oh! Luther, I have some fresh ideas for Christmas cards and I am going to try my luck with them in the marts of trade. There are hundreds of thousands of such things sold nowadays; and if the 'Boston Banner' likes my verses well enough to send me the paper regularly, why shouldn't the people who make cards like them too, especially when I can draw and paint my own pictures?\"  \"I've no doubt they'll like them; who wouldn't? If the parish knew what a ready pen you have, they'd suspect that you help me in my sermons! The question is, will the publishers send you a check, or only a copy of your card?\"  \"I should relish a check, I confess; but oh! I should like almost as well a beautifully colored card, Luther, with a picture of my own inventing on it, my own verse, and R. L. in tiny letters somewhere in the corner! It would make such a lovely Christmas present! And I should be so proud; inside of course, not outside! I would cover my halo with my hat so that nobody in the congregation would ever notice it!\"  The minister laughed.  \"Consult Letty, my dear. David used to be in some sort of picture business in Boston. She will know, perhaps, where to offer your card!\"  At the introduction of a new theme into the conversation Mrs. Larrabee slipped into a chair by the door, her lantern swinging in her hand.  \"David can't be as near as Boston or we should hear of him sometimes. A pretty sort of brother to be meandering foot-loose over the earth, and Letty working her fingers to the bone to support his children--twins at that! It was just like David Gilman to have twins! Doesn't it seem incredible that he can let Christmas go by without a message? I dare say he doesn't even remember that his babies were born on Christmas eve. To be sure he is only Letty's half-brother, but after all they grew up together and are nearly the same age.\"  \"You always judged David a little severely, Reba. Don't despair of reforming any man till you see the grass growing over his bare bones. I always have a soft spot in my heart for him when I remember his friendship for my Dick; but that was before your time.--Oh! these boys, these boys!\" The minister's voice quavered. \"We give them our very life-blood. We love them, cherish them, pray over them, do our best to guide them, yet they take the path that leads from home. In some way, God knows how, we fail to call out the return love, or even the filial duty and respect!--Well, we won't talk about it, Reba; my business is to breathe the breath of life into my text: 'Here am I, Lord, send me!' Letty certainly continues to say it heroically, whatever her troubles.\"  \"Yes, Letty is so ready for service that she will always be sent, till the end of time; but if David ever has an interview with his Creator I can hear him say: 'Here am I, Lord; send Letty!'\"  The minister laughed again. He laughed freely and easily nowadays. His first wife had been a sort of understudy for a saint, and after a brief but depressing connubial experience she had died, leaving him with a boy of six; a boy who already, at that tender age, seemed to cherish a passionate aversion to virtue in any form--the result, perhaps, of daily doses of the catechism administered by an abnormally pious mother.  The minister had struggled valiantly with his paternal and parochial cares for twelve lonely years when he met, wooed, and won (very much to his astonishment and exaltation) Reba Crosby. There never was a better bargain driven! She was forty-five by the family Bible but twenty-five in face, heart, and mind, while he would have been printed as sixty in \"Who's Who in New Hampshire\" although he was far older in patience and experience and wisdom. The minister was spiritual, frail, and a trifle prone to self-depreciation; the minister's new wife was spirited, vigorous, courageous, and clever. She was also Western-born, college-bred, good as gold, and invincibly, incurably gay. The minister grew younger every year, for Reba doubled his joys and halved his burdens, tossing them from one of her fine shoulders to the other as if they were feathers. She swept into the quiet village life of Beulah like a salt sea breeze. She infused a new spirit into the bleak church \"sociables\" and made them positively agreeable functions. The choir ceased from wrangling, the Sunday School plucked up courage and flourished like a green bay tree. She managed the deacons, she braced up the missionary societies, she captivated the parish, she cheered the depressed and depressing old ladies and cracked jokes with the invalids.  \"Ain't she a little mite too jolly for a minister's wife?\" questioned Mrs. Ossian Popham, who was a professional pessimist.  \"If this world is a place of want, woe, wantonness, an' wickedness, same as you claim, Maria, I don't see how a minister's wife _can_ be too jolly!\" was her husband's cheerful reply. \"Look how she's melted up the ice in both congregations, so't the other church is most willin' we should prosper, so long as Mis' Larrabee stays here an' we don't get too fur ahead of 'em in attendance. Me for the smiles, Maria!\"  And Osh Popham was right; for Reba Larrabee convinced the members of the rival church (the rivalry between the two being in rigidity of creed, not in persistency in good works) that there was room in heaven for at least two denominations; and said that if they couldn't unite in this world, perhaps they'd get round to it in the next. Finally, she saved Letitia Boynton's soul alive by giving her a warm, understanding friendship, and she even contracted to win back the minister's absent son some time or other, and convince him of the error of his ways.  \"Let Dick alone a little longer, Luther,\" she would say; \"don't hurry him, for he won't come home so long as he's a failure; it would please the village too much, and Dick hates the village. He doesn't accept our point of view, that we must love our enemies and bless them that despitefully use us. The village did despitefully use Dick, and for that matter, David Gilman too. They were criticized, gossiped about, judged without mercy. Nobody believed in them, nobody ever praised them;--and what is that about praise being the fructifying sun in which our virtues ripen, or something like that? I'm not quoting it right, but I wish I'd said it. They were called wild when most of their wildness was exuberant vitality; their mistakes were magnified, their mad pranks exaggerated. If I'd been married to you, my dear, while Dick was growing up, I wouldn't have let you keep him here in this little backwater of life; he needed more room, more movement. They wouldn't have been so down on him in Racine, Wisconsin!\"  Mrs. Larrabee lighted her lantern, closed the door behind her, and walked briskly down the lonely road that led from the parsonage at Beulah Corner to Letitia Boynton's house. It was bright moonlight and the ground was covered with light-fallen snow, but the lantern habit was a fixed one among Beulah ladies, who, even when they were not widows or spinsters, made their evening calls mostly without escort. The light of a lantern not only enabled one to pick the better side of a bad road, but would illuminate the face of any male stranger who might be of a burglarious or murderous disposition. Reba Larrabee was not a timid person; indeed, she was wont to say that men were so scarce in Beulah that unless they were out-and-out ruffians it would be an inspiration to meet a few, even if it were only to pass them in the middle of the road.  There was a light in the meeting-house as she passed, and then there was a long stretch of shining white silence unmarked by any human habitation till she came to the tumble-down black cottage inhabited by \"Door-Button\" Davis, as the little old man was called in the village. In the distance she could see Osh Popham's two-story house brilliantly illuminated by kerosene lamps, and as she"]]]
