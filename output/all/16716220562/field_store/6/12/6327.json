SOC. C. E.     During the last few years a quantity of literature has appeared in which the treatment of timber by preservatives has been discussed. The properties of timber, both treated and untreated, have been determined by the Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, and through its researches valuable knowledge has come to engineers who have to deal with the design of wooden structures. There is very little information, however, regarding the effect of time on creosoted timber, and for this reason the results given herewith may prove of interest.  The material tested consisted of southern pine stringers having a cross-section approximately 6 by 16 in. and a length of 30 ft. For the purpose of testing, each beam was cut into two parts, each about 15 ft. long. This material had been in use in a trestle of a railroad near New Orleans for 26 years. The stringers were chosen at random to determine the general condition of the trestle. The timber had been exposed to the weather and subjected to heavy train service from the time it was treated until it was tested. The annual rainfall at New Orleans is about 60 in., and the humidity of the air is high. In spite of these conditions, there was no appearance of decay on any of the specimens tested. The specifications under which the timber was treated were as follows:   TIMBER.  The timber for creosoting shall be long-leafed or southern pine. Sap surfaces on two or more sides are preferred.  _Piles._--The piles shall be of long-leafed or southern pine, not less than 14 in. at the butt. They shall be free from defects impairing their strength, and shall be reasonably straight.  The piles shall be cleanly peeled, no inner skin being left on them. The oil used shall be so-called creosote oil, from London, England, and shall be of a heavy quality.  The treatment will vary according to the dimensions of the timbers and length of time they have been cut. Timbers of large and small dimensions shall not be treated in the same charge, neither shall timbers of differing stages of air seasoning, or the close-grained, be treated in the same charge with coarse or open-grained timbers.  The timbers shall be subjected first to live steam superheated to from 250 to 275° Fahr., and under a 30 to 40-lb. pressure. The live steam shall be admitted into the cylinders through perforated steam pipes, and the temperature shall be obtained by using superheated steam in closed pipes in the cylinders.  The length of time this steaming shall last will depend on the size of the timbers and the length of time they have been cut. In piles and large timbers freshly cut, as long a time as 12 hours may be required. After the steaming is accomplished, the live steam shall be shut off and the superheated steam shall be maintained at a temperature of 160° or more and a vacuum of from 20 to 25 in. shall be held for 4 hours or longer, if the discharge from the pumps indicates the necessity.  _Oil Treatment._--The temperature being maintained at 160° Fahr., the cylinders shall be promptly filled with creosote oil at a temperature as high as practicable (about 100° Fahr.). The oil shall be maintained at a pressure ranging from 100 to 120 lb., as experience and measurements must determine the length of time the oil treatment shall continue, so that the required amount of oil may be injected.  After the required amount of oil is injected, the superheated steam shall be shut off, the oil let out, the cylinders promptly opened at each end, and the timber immediately removed from the cylinder.  In the erection of timbers the sap side must be turned up, and framing or cutting of timbers shall not be permitted, if avoidable. All cut surfaces of timbers shall be saturated with hot asphaltum, thinned with creosote oil. The heads of piles when cut shall be promptly coated with the hot asphaltum and oil, even though the cut-off be temporary.   METHOD OF TESTING.  The tests were made on a Riehlé 100,000-lb. machine in the Experimental Engineering Laboratory of Tulane University of Louisiana. The machine is provided with a cast-iron beam for cross-bending tests. The distance between supports was 12 ft. The method of support was as follows: Each end of the beam was provided with a steel roller which rested on the cast-iron beam of the testing machine, while above the roller, and, directly under the beam tested, there was a steel plate 6 by 8 in. in area and 1 in. thick. The area was sufficiently great to distribute the load and prevent the shearing of the fibers of the wood. The head of the Riehlé machine is 10 in. wide. A plate, 3/8 in. thick, 6 in. wide and 18 in. long, was placed between the head of the machine and the beam tested.

From a small piece of wood, tacked to the bottom of the beam at its center and projecting at the sides, the distance to these threads was measured. These measurements were taken to the nearest hundredth of an inch. The mean of the deflections was taken as the true deflection for any load.  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--DEFLECTON CURVES BEAM III]  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--DEFLECTON CURVES BEAM IV]  In computing the various quantities shown in Table 1, the summary of results, the load has been assumed as concentrated at the center of the beam. While it is true that the load was spread over a length of about 12 in., due to the width of the head of the machine and the plate between it and the beam tested, it is also true that there were irregularities, such as bolt-holes and, in some cases, abrasions due to wear, that could not well be taken into account. Hence, it was deemed sufficiently accurate to consider the load as concentrated. Besides the horizontal bolt-holes, shown in the photographs, there were vertical bolt-holes, at intervals in all the beams. The latter were 7/8 in. in diameter, and in every case they were sufficiently removed from the center of the length of the beam to allow the maximum moment at the reduced section to be relatively less than that at the center of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17776"],["title","Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, vol. LXX, Dec. 1910 (#1)"],["body","beam. For this reason, no correction was made for these holes. The broken beams often showed that rupture started at, or was influenced by, some of the holes, especially the horizontal ones.  While some of the heavy oils of a tarry consistency remained, they were only to be found in the sappy portions of the long-leaf pine and in the loblolly (Specimens II and IV). Exposure in a semi-tropical climate for 26 years had resulted in the removal of the more volatile portions of the creosote oil. The penetration of the oil into the sap wood seemed to be perfect, while in the loblolly it varied from a fraction of an inch to 1-1/2 in. In the heart wood there was very little penetration across the grain. The timber had been framed and the holes bored before treatment. The penetration of the creosote along the grain from the holes was often from 4 to 6 in.  Circular 39 of the Forest Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture, entitled \"Experiments on the Strength of Treated Timber,\" gives the results of a great many tests of creosoted ties, principally loblolly pine, from which the following conclusions are quoted:       \"(1) A high degree of steaming is injurious to wood. The degree of      steaming at which pronounced harm results will depend upon the      quality of the wood and its degree of seasoning, and upon the      pressure (temperature) of steam and the duration of its      application. For loblolly pine the limit of safety is certainly 30      pounds for 4 hours, or 20 pounds for 6 hours.\" [Tables 3, 6, and      7.]       \"(2) The presence of zinc chlorid will not weaken wood under static      loading, although the indications are that the wood becomes brittle      under impact.\" [Tables 3 and 4.]  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--DEFLECTON CURVES BEAM V]  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--DEFLECTON CURVES BEAM VI]       \"(3) The presence of creosote will not weaken wood of itself. Since      apparently it is present only in the openings of the cells, and      does not get into the cell walls, its action can only be to retard      the seasoning of the wood.\" [Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6.]  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--DEFLECTON CURVES BEAM VII]   COMPARISONS.  A comparison of the results obtained with tests made on untreated timber is interesting, and to this end Tables 2 and 3, from Circular 115, Forest Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture, by W. Kendrick Hatt, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E., are quoted. The tests made by the writer were from timber raised in Louisiana and Mississippi, while the tests quoted were from timber raised farther north. The number of tests was not sufficient to settle questions of average strength or other qualities. It will be seen, however, that the treated timber 26 years old compares favorably with the new untreated timber.
