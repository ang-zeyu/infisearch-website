Orion and Diana dropped on their knees by Iris' side. \"I think,\" said Iris slowly, \"that we will give this poor innocent a simple funeral. The coffin must be made of dock leaves, and----\"  Here she was suddenly interrupted--a shadow fell across the entrance door of the pretty summer-house. An elderly woman, with a thin face and lank, figure, looked in.  \"Miss Iris,\" she said, \"Mrs. Delaney is awake and would be glad to see you.\"  \"Mother!\" cried Iris eagerly. She turned at once to her sister and brothers. \"The innocent must wait,\" she said. \"Put it in the dead-house with the other creatures. I will attend to the funeral in the evening or to-morrow. Don't keep me now, children.\"  \"But I thought you had just come from mother,\" said Apollo.  \"No. When I went to her she was asleep. Don't keep me, please.\" The woman who had brought the message had already disappeared down the long straight walk. Iris took to her heels and ran after her. \"Fortune,\" she said, looking into her face, \"is mother any better?\"  \"As to that, Miss Iris, it is more than I can tell you. Please don't hold on to my hand, miss. In hot weather I hate children to cling to me.\"  Iris said nothing more, but she withdrew a little from Fortune's side.  Fortune hurried her steps, and Iris kept time with her. When they reached the house, the woman stopped and looked intently at the child.  \"You can go straight upstairs at once, miss, and into the room,\" she said. \"You need not knock; my mistress is waiting for you.\"  \"Don't you think, Fortune, that mother is just a little _wee_ bit better?\" asked Iris again. There was an imploring note in her question this time.  \"She will tell you herself, my dear. Now, be quick; don't keep her waiting. It is bad for people, when they are ill, to be kept waiting.\"  \"I won't keep her; I'll go to her this very instant,\" said Iris.  The old house was as beautiful as the garden to which it belonged. It had been built, a great part of it, centuries ago, and had, like many other houses of its date, been added to from time to time. Queerly shaped rooms jutted out in many quarters; odd stairs climbed up in several directions; towers and turrets were added to the roof; passages, some narrow, some broad, connected the new buildings with the old. The whole made an incongruous and yet beautiful effect, the new rooms possessing the advantages and comforts which modern builders put into their houses, and the older part of the house the quaint devices and thick, wainscoted walls and deep, mullioned windows of the times which are gone by.  Iris ran quickly through the wide entrance hall and up the broad, white, stone stairs. These stairs were a special feature of Delaney Manor. They had been brought all the way from Italy by a Delaney nearly a hundred years ago, and were made of pure marble, and were very lovely to look at. When Iris reached the first landing, she turned aside from the spacious modern apartments and, opening a green baize door, ran down a narrow passage. At the end of the passage she turned to the left and went down another passage, and then wended her way up some narrow stairs, which curled round and round as if they were going up a tower. This, as a matter of fact, was the case. Presently Iris pushed aside a curtain, and found herself in an octagon room nearly at the top of a somewhat high, but squarely built, tower. This room, which was large and airy, was wainscoted with oak; there was a thick Turkey carpet on the floor, and the many windows were flung wide open, so that the summer breeze, coming in fresh and sweet from this great height, made the whole lovely room as fresh and cheery and full of sweet perfume as if its solitary inmate were really in the open air.  Iris, however, had often been in the room before, and had no time or thought now to give to its appearance. Her eyes darted to the sofa on which her young mother lay. Mrs. Delaney was half-sitting up, and looked almost too young to be the mother of a child as big as Iris. She had one of the most beautiful faces God ever gave to anybody. It was not so much that her features were perfect, but they were full of light, full of soul, and such a very loving expression beamed in her eyes that no man, woman, or child ever looked at her without feeling the best in their natures coming immediately to the surface.  As to little Iris, her feelings for her mother were quite beyond any words to express. She ran up to her now and knelt by her side.  \"Kiss me, Iris,\" said Mrs. Delaney.  Iris put up her soft, rosebud lips; they met the equally soft lips of the mother.  \"You are much better, mummy; are you not?\" said the child, in an eager, half-passionate whisper.  \"I have had a long sleep, darling, and I am rested,\" said Mrs. Delaney. \"I told Fortune to call you. Father is away for the day. I thought we could have half an hour uninterrupted.\"  \"How beautiful, mother! It is the most delightful thing in all the world to be alone with you, mummy.\"  \"Well, bring your little chair and sit near me, Iris. Fortune will bring in tea in a moment, and you can pour it out. You shall have tea with me, if you wish it, darling.\"  Iris gave a sigh of rapture; she was too happy almost for words. This was almost invariably the case when she found herself in her mother's presence. When with her mother she was quiet and seldom spoke a great deal. In the garden with the other children Iris was the one who chattered most, but with her mother her words were always few. She felt herself then to be more or less in a listening attitude. She listened for the words which dropped from those gentle lips; she was always on the lookout for the love-light which filled the soft brown eyes.  At that moment the old servant, Fortune, brought in the tea on a pretty tray and laid it on a small table near Mrs. Delaney. Then Iris got up, and with an important air poured it out and brought a cup, nicely prepared, to her mother.  Mrs. Delaney sipped her tea and looked from time to time at her little daughter. When she did so, Iris devoured her with her anxious eyes.  \"No,\" she said to herself, \"mother does not look ill--not even _very_ tired. She is not like anybody else, and that is why--why she wears that wonderful, almost holy expression. Sometimes I wish she did not, but I would not change her, not for all the world.\"  Iris' heart grew quiet. Her cup of bliss was quite full. She scarcely touched her tea; she was too happy even to eat.  \"Have you had enough tea, mother?\" she asked presently.  \"Yes, darling. Please push the tea-table a little aside, and then come up very near to me. I want to hold your dear little hand in mine; I can't talk much.\"  \"But you are better--you are surely better, mother?\"  \"In one sense, yes, Iris.\"  Iris moved the tea-table very deftly aside, and then, drawing up her small chair, slipped her hand inside her mother's.  \"I have made up my mind to tell you, Iris,\" said the mother. She looked at the little girl for a full minute, and then began to talk in a low, clear voice. \"I am the mother of four children. I don't think there are any other children like you four in the wide world. I have thought a great deal about you, and while I have been ill have prayed to God to keep you and to help me, and now, Iris, now that I have got to go away--\"  \"To go away, mother?\" interrupted Iris, turning very pale.  \"Yes, dearest. Don't be troubled, darling; I can make it all seem quite happy to you. But now, when I see it must be done, that I must undertake this very long journey, I want to put things perfectly straight between you and me, my little daughter.\"  \"Things have been always straight between us, mother,\" said Iris. \"I don't quite understand.\"  \"Do you remember the time when I went to Australia?\"  \"Are you going to Australia again?\" asked Iris. \"You were a whole year away then. It was a very long time, and sometimes, mother, sometimes Fortune was a little cross, and Miss Stevenson never seemed to suit Apollo. I thought I would tell you about that.\"  \"But Fortune means well, dearest. She has your true interest at heart, and I think matters will be differently arranged, as far as Miss Stevenson is concerned, in the future. It is not about her or Fortune I want to speak now.\"  \"And you are going back to Australia again?\"  \"I am going quite as far as Australia; but we need not talk of the distance just now. I have not time for many words, nor very much strength to speak. You know, Iris, the meaning of your names, don't you?\"  \"Of course,\" answered Iris; \"and, mother, I have often talked to the others about our names. I have told Apollo how beautiful he must try to be, not only in his face, but in his mind, mother, and how brave and how clever. I have told him that he must try to have a beautiful soul; and Orion must be very brave and strong, and Diana must be bright and sparkling and noble. Yes, mother; we all know about our names.\"  \"I am glad of that,\" said Mrs. Delaney. \"I gave you the names for a purpose. I wanted you to have names with meaning to them. I wanted you to try to live up to them. Now, Iris, that I am really going away, I am afraid you children will find a great many things altered. You have hitherto lived a very sheltered life; you have just had the dear old garden and the run of the house, and you have seen your father or me every day. But afterwards, when I have gone, you will doubtless have to go into the world; and, my darling, my darling, the cold world does not always understand the meaning of names like yours, the meaning of strength and beauty and nobleness, and of bright, sparkling, and high ideas. In short, my little girl, if you four children are to be worthy of your names and to fulfill the dreams, the longings, the _hopes_ I have centered round you, there is nothing whatever for you to do but to begin to fight your battles.\"  Iris was silent. She had very earnest eyes, something like her mother's in expression. They "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17506"],["title","A Little Mother to the Others (#2)"],["body","fixed now on Mrs. Delaney's face.  \"I will not explain exactly what I mean,\" said the mother, giving the little hand a loving squeeze, \"only to assure you, Iris, that, as the trial comes, strength will be given to you to meet it. Please understand, my darling, that from first to last, to the end of life, it is all a fight. 'The road winds uphill all the way.' If you will remember that you will not think things half as hard, and you will be brave and strong, and, like the rainbow, you will cheer people even in the darkest hours. But, Iris, I want you to promise me one thing--I want you, my little girl, to be a mother to the others.\"  \"A mother to the others?\" said Iris, half aloud. She paused and did not speak at all for a moment, her imagination was very busy. She thought of all the creatures to whom she was already a mother, not only her own dear pets--the mice in their cages, the silk-worms, the three dogs, the stray cat, the pet Persian cat, the green frogs, the poor innocents, as the children called worms--but in addition to these, all creatures that suffered in the animal kingdom, all flowers that were about to fade, all sad things that seemed to need care and comfort. But up to the present she had never thought of the other children except as her equals. Apollo was only a year younger than herself, and in some ways braver and stouter and more fearless; and Orion and Diana were something like their names--very bright and even fierce at times. She, after all, was the gentlest of the party, and she was very young--not more than ten years of age. How could she possibly be a mother to the others?  She looked at Mrs. Delaney, and her mother gazed solemnly at her, waiting for her to speak.  \"After all,\" thought Iris, \"to satisfy the longing in mother's eyes is the first thing of all. I will promise, cost what it may.\"  \"Yes,\" she said; then softly, \"I will, mother; I will be a mother to the others.\"  \"Kiss me, Iris.\"  The little girl threw her arms round her mother's neck; their lips met in a long embrace.  \"Darling, you understand? I am satisfied with your promise, and I am tired.\"  \"Must I go away, mother? May not I stay very quietly with you? Can you not sleep if I am in the room?\"  \"I would rather you left me now. I can sleep better when no one is by. Ring the bell for Fortune as you go. She will come and make me comfortable. Yes; I am very tired.\"  \"One moment first, mummy--you have not told me yet when you are going on the journey.\"  \"The day is not quite fixed, Iris, although it is--yes, it is nearly so.\"  \"And you have not said _where_ you are going, mother. I should like to tell the others.\"  But Mrs. Delaney had closed her eyes, and did not make any reply.     CHAPTER II.  A LITTLE MOTHER TO THE OTHERS.   That night the children's young mother went on her journey. The summons for her to go came unexpectedly, as it often does in the end. She had not even time to say good-by to the children, nor to her husband, only just a brief moment to look, with startled eyes, at the wonderful face of the angel who had come to fetch her, and then with a smile of bliss to let him clasp her in his arms and feel his strong wings round her, and then she was away, beyond the lovely house and the beautiful garden, and the children sleeping quietly in their beds, and the husband who was slumbering by her side--beyond the tall trees and the peaks of the highest mountains, beyond the stars themselves, until finally she entered the portals of a home that is everlasting, and found herself in a land where the flowers do not fade.  In the morning the children were told that their mother was dead. They all cried, and everyone thought it dreadfully sad, except Iris, who knew better. It was Fortune who brought in the news to the children--they had just gone into the day-nursery at the time.  Fortune was a stern woman, somewhat over fifty years of age. She was American by birth, and had lived with Mrs. Delaney since Iris was born. Mrs. Delaney was also American, which may have accounted for some of her bright fancies, and quiet, yet sweet and quick ways. Fortune was very fond of the children after her fashion, which was, however, as a rule, somewhat severe and exacting. But to-day, in her bitter grief, she sank down on the nearest chair, and allowed them all to crowd round her, and cried bitterly, and took little Orion in her arms and kissed him and petted him, and begged of each child to forgive her for ever having been cross or disagreeable, and promised, as well and as heartily as she could, never to transgress again in that manner as long as she lived.  While the others were sobbing and crying round Fortune, Iris stood silent.  \"Where is father?\" she said at last, in a very quiet but determined voice.  Fortune glanced round at the grave little girl in some wonder.  \"Miss Iris,\" she said, \"you are not even crying.\"  \"What do tears matter?\" answered Iris. \"Please, Fortune, where is father? I should like to go to him.\"  \"He is locked up in his study, darling, and could not possibly see you nor anyone else. He is quite stunned, master is, and no wonder. You cannot go to him at present, Miss Iris.\"  Iris did not say another word, but she looked more grave and more thoughtful than ever. After a long pause she sat down in her own little chair near the open window. It was a very lovely day, just as beautiful as the one which had preceded it. As the child sat by the window, and the soft, sweet breeze fanned her pale cheeks, an indescribable longing came over her. No one was particularly noticing her. She crept softly out of the room, ran down some passages, and at last found herself once more mounting the turret stairs to the tower. A moment later she had entered the octagon room where she and her mother had talked together on the previous day. The windows were wide open, the pretty room looked just as usual, but mother's sofa was vacant. Iris went straight over to one of the open windows, knelt down, and put her little elbows on the ledge.  \"Yes, mother,\" she said, speaking aloud and looking full up at the bright blue sky, \"I promise you. I promised you yesterday, but I make a fresh, very, _very_ solemn promise to-day. Yes, I will be a mother to the others; I will try never to think of myself; I will remember, mother darling, exactly what you want me to do. I will try to be beautiful, to be a little messenger of the gods, as you sometimes said I might be, and to be like the rainbow, full of hope. And I will try to help Apollo to be the most beautiful and the bravest boy in the world; and, mother, I will do my best to help Diana to be strong and bright and full of courage; and I will do what I can for Orion--he must be grand like a giant, so that he may live up to the wonderful name you have given him. Mother, it will be very hard, but I promise, I promise with all my might, to do everything you want me to do. I will act just as if you were there and could see, mother, and I will _always_ remember that it is beautiful for you to have gone away, for while you were here you had so much pain and so much illness. I won't fret, mother; no, I won't fret--I promise to be a mother to the others, and there won't be any time to fret.\"  No tears came to Iris' bright eyes, but her little thin face grew paler and paler. Presently she left the window and went slowly downstairs again.  Fortune had now left the other children to themselves. They were scattered about the bright day nursery, looking miserable, though they could scarcely tell why.  \"I don't believe a bit that mother is never coming back,\" said Orion, in a stout, determined voice.  He was a very handsome little fellow, strongly made--he had great big black eyes like his father's. He was standing now with his Noah's ark in his hand.  \"It is unfeeling of you to want to play with your Noah's ark to-day, Orion,\" said Apollo. \"Now, do you think I would go into my laboratory and try to make a thermometer?\"  \"Well, at least,\" said Diana, speaking with a sort of jerk, and her small face turning crimson, \"whatever happens, the animals must be fed.\"  \"Of course they must, Diana,\" said Iris, coming forward, \"and, Apollo, there is not the least harm in our going into the garden, and I don't think there is any harm in Orion playing with his Noah's ark. Come, children; come with me. We will feed all the pets and then go into the arbor, and, if you like, I will tell you stories.\"  \"What sort of stories?\" asked Diana, in quite a cheerful voice. She trotted up to her sister, and gave her her hand as she spoke. She also was a finely made child, not unlike her name.  \"I 'gree with Orion,\" she said. \"I'm quite certain sure that mother is coming back 'fore long. Fortune did talk nonsense. She said, Iris--do you know what she said?--she said that in the middle of the night, just when it was black dark, you know, a white angel came into the room and took mother in his arms and flew up to the sky with her. You don't believe that; do you, Iris?\"  \"Yes, I do, Diana,\" answered Iris. \"But I will tell you more about it in the arbor. Come, Apollo; mother would not like us to stay in the house just because she has gone away to the angels. Mother never was the least little bit selfish. Come into the garden.\"  The three forlorn-looking little children were much comforted by Iris' brave words. They dried their eyes, and Diana ran into the night nursery to fetch their hats. They then ran downstairs without anyone specially noticing them, passed through the great entrance hall, and out on to the wide gravel sweep, which led by a side walk into the lovely garden.  Iris held Diana by one hand and Orion by the other, and Apollo ran on in front.  \"Now, then,\" said Iris, when they had reached the garden, \"we must begin by feeding all the pets.\"  \"There _are_ an awful lot of them,\" said Diana, in quite a cheerful voice; \"and don't you remember, Iris, the poor innocent was not buried yesterday?\"  Iris could not help giving a"]]]
