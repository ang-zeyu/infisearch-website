I believe she has ability, and it is         high time to begin to think seriously what you mean to do with         her. In the future women will have to depend upon themselves,         and I consider that all girls should be trained to gain their         own living. The foundation of every career is a good         education--without this it is impossible to build at all, and         Winona certainly cannot obtain it if she remains at home. The         new High School at Seaton is offering two open Scholarships to         girls resident in the County, the examination for which is on         September 8th. I propose that Winona enters for this         examination, and that if she should be a successful candidate,         she should come to live with me during the period of her         attendance at the High School. The education is the best         possible, there is a prospect of a University Scholarship to be         competed for, and every help and encouragement is given to the         girls in their choice of a career. With Winona off your hands, I         should suggest that you should engage a competent nursery         governess to teach the younger children the elements of order         and discipline. I would gladly pay her salary on the         understanding that I should myself select her.          \"Trusting that these proposals may be of some service, and         hoping to hear a better account of your health,                                                  \"I remain,                                          \"Your affectionate Aunt                                                    \"and Godmother,                                                          \"Harriet Beach.\"    Winona laid down the letter with an agitated gasp. The proposition almost took her breath away.  \"What an idea!\" she exclaimed indignantly. \"Mother, of course you won't even dream of it for an instant! I'd _hate_ to go and live with Aunt Harriet. It's not to be thought of!\"  \"Well, I don't know, Winona!\" wavered Mrs. Woodward. \"We must look at it from all sides, and perhaps Aunt Harriet's right, and it really would be for the best. Miss Harmon's a poor teacher, and I'm sure your music, at any rate, is not a credit to her. You played that last piece shockingly out of time. You know you said yourself that you were getting beyond Miss Harmon!\"  Whatever impeachments Winona may have brought against her teacher, she was certainly not prepared to admit them now. She rejected the project of the Seaton High School with the utmost energy and determination, bringing into the fray all that force of character which her mother lacked. Poor Mrs. Woodward vacillated feebly--she was generally swayed by whoever was nearest at the moment--and I verily believe Winona's arguments would have prevailed, and the whole scheme would have been abandoned, had not Mr. Joynson opportunely happened to turn up.  Mr. Joynson was a solicitor, and the trustee of Mrs. Woodward's property. He managed most of her business affairs, and some of her private ones as well. She had confidence in his judgment, and she at once thankfully submitted the question of Winona's future to his decision.  \"The very thing for her!\" he declared. \"Do her a world of good to go to a proper school. She's frittering her time away here. Send her to Seaton by all means. What are you to do without her? Nonsense! Nobody's indispensable--especially a girl of fifteen! Pack her off as soon as you can. Doesn't want to go? Oh, she'll sing a different song when once she gets there, you'll see!\"  Thus supported by masculine authority, Mrs. Woodward settled the question in the affirmative, and replied to her aunt by return of post.  Naturally such a stupendous event as the exodus of Winona made a sensation in the household.  \"Well, of all the rum shows!\" exclaimed Percy. \"You and Aunt Harriet in double harness! It beats me altogether!\"  \"It's atrocious!\" groaned Winona. \"I'm a victim sacrificed for the good of the family. Oh! why couldn't mother have thought of some other way of economizing? I don't want to win scholarships and go in for a career!\"  \"Buck up! Perhaps you won't win! There'll be others in for the exam., you bet! You'll probably fail, and come whining home like a whipped puppy with its tail between its legs!\"  \"Indeed I shan't!\" flared Winona indignantly. \"I've a little more spirit than that, thank you! And why should you imagine I'm going to fail? I suppose I've as much brains as most people!\"  \"That's right! Upset the pepper-pot! I was only trying to comfort you!\" teased Percy. \"In my opinion you'll be returned like a bad halfpenny, or one of those articles 'of no use to anybody except the owner.' Aunt Harriet will be cheated of her prey after all!\"  \"If Win goes away, I shall be the eldest daughter at home,\" said Letty airily, shaking out her short skirts. \"I'll sit at the end of the table, and pour out tea if mother has a headache, and unlock the apple room, and use the best inkpot if I like, and have first innings at the piano.\"  \"You forget about the nursery governess,\" retorted Winona. \"If I go, she comes, and you'll find you've exchanged King Log for King Stork. Oh, very well, just wait and see! It won't be as idyllic as you imagine. I shall be saved the trouble of looking after you, at any rate.\"  \"What I'm trying to ascertain, madam,\" said Percy blandly, \"is whether your ladyship wishes to take up your residence in Seaton or not. With the usual perversity of your sex you pursue a pig policy. When I venture to picture you seated at the board of your venerable aunt, you protest you are a sacrifice; when, on the other hand, I suggest your return to the bosom of your family, you revile me equally.\"  \"You're the most unsympathetic _beast_ I've ever met!\" declared Winona aggrievedly.  When she analyzed her feelings, however, she was obliged to allow that they were mixed. Though the prospect of settling down at Seaton filled her with dismay, Percy's gibe at her probable failure touched her pride. Winona had always been counted as the clever member of the family. It would be too ignominious to be sent home labeled unfit. She set her teeth and clenched her fists at the bare notion.  \"I'll show them all what I can do if I take a thing up!\" she resolved.  In the meantime Mrs. Woodward was immersed in the subject of clothing. Every post brought her boxes of patterns, amongst which she hesitated, lost in choice.  \"If I knew whether you're really going to stay at Seaton or not, it would make all the difference, Winona,\" she fluttered. \"It's no use buying you these new things if you're only to wear them at home, but I'd make an effort to send you nice to Aunt Harriet's. I know she'll criticize everything you have on. Dear me, I think I'd better risk it! It would be such a nuisance to have to write for the patterns all over again, and how could I get your dresses fitted when you weren't here to be tried on? Miss Jones is at liberty now, and can come for a week's sewing, but she'll probably be busy if I want her later. Now tell me, which do you really think is the prettier of these two shades? I like the fawn, but I believe the material will spot. What have you done with the lace collar Aunt Harriet gave you last Christmas? She's sure to ask about it if you don't wear it!\"  Having decided that on the whole she intended to win a scholarship, Winona bluffed off the matter of her departure.  \"I've changed my mind, that's all,\" she announced to her home circle. \"It will be a great comfort to me not to hear Mamie scraping away at her violin in the evenings, or Letty strumming at scales. Think what a relief not to be obliged to rout up Dorrie and Godfrey, and haul them off to school every day! I'm tired of setting an example. You needn't snigger!\"  The family grinned appreciatively. They understood Winona.  \"Don't you worry! I'll set the example when you're gone,\" Letty assured her. \"I'll be as improving as a copy-book. I wish I'd your chance; I'd stand Aunt Harriet for the sake of going to a big High School. Younger sisters never have any luck! Eldests just sweep the board. I don't know where we come in!\"  \"Don't you fret, young 'un, you'll score later on!\" cooed an indulgent voice from the sofa, where Percy sprawled with a book and a bag of walnuts. \"Remember that when you're still in all the bliss and sparkle of your teens, Winona'll be a mature and _pass√©e_ person of twenty-two. 'That eldest Miss Woodward's getting on, you know!' people will say, and somebody'll reply: 'Yes, poor thing!'\"  \"They won't when I've got a career,\" retorted Winona, pelting Percy with his own walnut-shells.  \"You assured us the other day that you despised such vanities.\"  \"Well, it depends. Perhaps I'll be a lady tram conductor, and punch tickets, or a post-woman, or drive a Government van!\"  \"If those are careers for girls, bag me for a steeple jack,\" chirped Dorrie.  It was perhaps a good thing for Winona that such a short interval elapsed between the acceptance of Aunt Harriet's proposal and the date of the scholarship examination. The ten days were very busy ones, for there seemed much to be done in the way of preparation. Miss Jones, the dressmaker, was installed in the nursery with the sewing-machine, and demanded frequent tryings-on, a process Winona hated.  \"I shall buy all my clothes ready made when I'm grown up!\" she declared.  \"They very seldom fit, and have to be altered,\" returned her mother. \"Do stand still, Winona! And I hope you're learning up a few dates and facts for this examination. You ought to be studying every morning. If only Miss Harmon were home, I'd have asked her to coach you. I'm afraid she'll be disappointed at your leaving, but of course she can't expect to keep you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18019"],["title","The Luckiest Girl in the School (#2)"],["body","ever. I heard a rumor that she means to give up her school altogether, and go and live with her uncle. I hope it's true, and then I can take the little ones away with an easy conscience. I don't want to treat her badly, poor thing, but I'm sure teaching's not her vocation.\"  Winona really made a heroic effort to prepare herself for the coming ordeal. She retired to a secluded part of the garden and read over her latest school books. The process landed her in the depths of despondency.  \"I'll never remember anything--never!\" she mourned to her family. \"To try and get all this into my head at once is like bolting a week's meals at a single go! I know a date here and there, and I've a hazy notion of French and Latin verbs, and a general impression of other subjects, but if they ask me for anything definite, such as the battles of the Wars of the Roses, or a list of the products of India, I'm done for!\"  \"Go in for Post-Impressionism, then,\" suggested Percy. \"Write from a romantic standpoint, and don't condescend to mere facts. Stick in a quotation or two, and a drawing if possible, and make your paper sound eloquent and dramatic and poetical, and all the rest of it. They'll mark you low for accuracy, but put you on ten per cent. for style, you bet! I know a chap who tries it on at the Coll., and it always pays.\"  \"It's worth thinking about, certainly,\" said Winona, shutting her books with a weary yawn.     CHAPTER II  An Entrance Examination   The Seaton High School was a large, handsome brick building exactly opposite the public park. It had only been erected two years ago, so everything about it was absolutely new and up-to-date. It supplied a great need in the rapidly growing city, and indeed offered the best and most go-ahead education to be obtained in the district.  It was the aim of the school to fit girls for various professions and careers; there was a classical and a modern side, a department for domestic economy, and a commercial class for instruction in business details. Art, music, and nature study were well catered for, and manual training was not forgotten. As the school was intended to become in time a center for the county, the Governors had offered two open free scholarships to be competed for by girls resident in other parts of Rytonshire, hoping by this means to attract pupils from the country places round about.  On the morning of September 8th, precisely at 8.35, Winona presented herself at the school for the scholarship examination. There were twenty other candidates awaiting the ordeal, in various stages of nervousness or sangfroid. Some looked dejected, some confident, and others hid their feelings under a mask of stolidity. Winona joined them shyly. They were all unknown to one another, and so far nobody had plucked up courage to venture a remark. It is horribly depressing to sit on a form staring at twenty taciturn strangers. Winona bore for awhile with the stony silence, then--rather frightened at the sound of her own voice--she announced:  \"I suppose we're all going in for this same exam.!\" It was a trite commonplace, but it broke the ice. Everybody looked relieved. The atmosphere seemed to clear.  \"Yes, we're all going in--that's right enough,\" replied a ruddy-haired girl in spectacles, \"but there are only two scholarships, so nineteen of us are bound to fail--that's logic and mathematics and all the rest of it.\"  \"Whew! A nice cheering prospect. Wish they'd put us out of our misery at once!\" groaned a stout girl with a long fair pigtail.  \"I'm all upset!\" shivered another.  \"It's like a game of musical chairs,\" suggested a fourth. \"We're all scrambling for the same thing, and some are bound to be out of it.\"  The ruddy-haired girl laughed nervously.  \"Suppose we've got to take our sporting luck!\" she murmured.  \"If nineteen are sure to lose, two are sure to win at any rate,\" said Winona. \"That's logic and mathematics and all the rest of it, too!\"  \"Right you are! That's a more cheering creed! It doesn't do to cry 'Miserere me' too soon!\" chirped a jolly-looking dark-eyed girl with a red hair-ribbon. \"'Never say die till you're dead,' is my motto!\"  \"I'm wearing a swastika for a mascot,\" said a short, pale girl, exhibiting her charm, which hung from a chain round her neck. \"I never am lucky, so I thought I'd try what this would do for me for once. I know English history beautifully down to the end of Queen Anne, and no further, and if they set any questions on the Georges I'll be stumped.\"  \"I've learnt Africa, but Asia would floor me!\" observed another, looking up from a geography book, in which she was making a last desperate clutch at likely items of knowledge. \"I never can remember which side of India Madras is on; I get it hopelessly mixed with Bombay.\"  \"I wish to goodness they'd go ahead and begin,\" mourned the owner of the red hair-ribbon. \"It's this waiting that knocks the spirit out of me. Patience isn't my pet virtue. I call it cruelty to animals to leave us on tenter-hooks.\"  Almost as if in answer to her pathetic appeal the door opened, and a teacher appeared. In a brisk, business-like manner she marshaled the candidates into line, and conducted them to the door of the head-mistress' study, where one by one they were admitted for a brief private interview. Winona's turn came about the middle of the row.  \"Pass in: as quickly as you can, please!\" commanded the teacher, motioning her onward.  As Winona entered, she gave one hasty comprehensive glance round the room, taking in a general impression of books, busts and pictures, then focussed her attention on the figure that sat at the desk. It was only at a later date that she grasped any details of Miss Bishop's personality; at that first meeting she realized nothing but the pair of compelling blue eyes that drew her forward like a magnet.  \"Your name?\"  \"Winona Woodward.\"  \"Age?\"  \"Fifteen.\"  \"Residence?\"  \"Highfield, Ashbourne, near Great Marston.\"  \"How long have you lived in the county of Rytonshire?\"  \"Ever since I was born.\"  Miss Bishop hastily ticked off these replies on a page of her ledger, and handed Winona a card.  \"This will admit you to the examination room. Remember that instead of putting your name at the head of your papers, you are to write the number given you on your card. Any candidate writing her own name will be disqualified. Next girl!\"  It was all over in two minutes. Winona seemed hardly to have entered the room before she was out again.  \"Move on, please!\" said the teacher, marshaling the little crowd round the door. \"Will those who have seen Miss Bishop kindly go along the corridor.\"  Several girls who had been standing in a knot made a sudden bolt, and pushed their fellows forward. Somebody jogged Winona's elbow. Her card slid from her grasp and fell on to the ground. As she bent in the crush to pick it up, the ruddy-haired girl stooped on a like errand.  \"Dropped mine too! Clumsy, isn't it?\" she laughed. \"Hope we've got our own! What was your number?\"  \"I hadn't time to look.\"  \"Well, I'm sure mine was eleven, so that's all right. I wish you luck! Won't we just be glad when it's over, rather!\"  At the further end of the corridor was a door with a notice pinned on to it. \"Examination for County Scholarships.\" A mistress stood there, and scrutinized each girl's card as she entered, directing her to a seat in the room marked with the corresponding number. Winona walked rather solemnly to the desk labeled 10. The great ordeal was at last about to begin. She wondered what would be the end of it. Little thrills of nervousness seemed running down her back like drops from a shower-bath. Her hands were trembling. With a great effort she pulled herself together.  \"It's no use funking!\" she thought. \"I'll make as good a shot as I can at things, and if I fail--well, I shall have plenty of companions in misfortune, at any rate!\"  A pile of foolscap paper with red-ruled margins, a clean sheet of white blotting paper, and a penholder with a new nib lay ready. Each of the other twenty victims was surveying a supply of similar material. On the blackboard was chalked the word \"Silence.\"  In a dead hush the candidates sat and waited. Exactly on the stroke of nine Miss Bishop entered and handed a sheaf of printed questions to the teacher in charge, who distributed them round the room. The subject for the first hour was arithmetic. Winona read over her paper slowly. She felt capable of managing it, all except the last two problem sums, which were outside her experience. She knew it would mainly be a question of accuracy.  \"I'll work them each twice if I've only time,\" she thought, starting at number one.  An hour is after all only made up of sixty minutes, and these seemed to fly with incredible rapidity. The teacher on the platform had sternly reproved a girl guilty of counting aloud in an agitated whisper, threatening instant expulsion for a repetition of such an offense, but with this solitary exception nobody transgressed the rules. All sat quietly absorbed in their work, and an occasional rustle of paper or scratch of a pen were the only sounds audible. At precisely five minutes to ten the deity on the platform sounded a bell, and ordered papers to be put together. She collected them, handed them to another mistress, then without any break proceeded to deal out the questions for the next hour's examination. This was in geography, and here Winona was not on such sure ground. Granted that you are acquainted with certain rules in arithmetic, it is always possible to work out problems, but it needed more knowledge than she possessed to write answers to the riddles that confronted her. She had never heard of \"The Iron Gates,\" could not place Alcona and Altona, was hazy as to the whereabouts of the Mourne Mountains, and utterly unable to draw an accurate map of the Balkan States. She scored a little on Canada, for she had learnt North America last term at Miss Harmon's, but with Australia and New Zealand she was "]]]
