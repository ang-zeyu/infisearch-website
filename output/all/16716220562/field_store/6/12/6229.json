I must be allowed to add,     that the head waiter of the Waldhorn, or _Hunting Horn_, was one     of the most respectably looking, and well-mannered, of his species. He     spoke French fluently, but with the usual German accent. The master of     the inn was coarse and bluff, but bustling and civil. He frequently     devoted one of the best rooms in his house to large, roaring, singing,     parties--in which he took a decided lead, and kept it up till past     midnight.

I should add, that,     previously to the words \"_sexagesimosexto_\" were those of     \"_quiquagesimosexto_\"--which have been erased by the pen of the     Scribe; but not so entirely as to be illegible. I am indebted to M. Le     Bret for the information that this Bible by Mentelin is more ancient     than the one, without date or place, &c. (see _Bibl. Spencer_, vol. i.     p. 42, &c.) which has been usually considered to be anterior to it. M.     Le Bret draws this conclusion from the comparative antiquity of the     language of Mentelin's edition.  [8] This was the _second_ copy, with the same original piece, which I     had seen abroad; that in the Library of the Arsenal at Paris being the     first. I have omitted to notice this, in my account of that Library,     vol. ii. p. 156-7, &c.  [9] [Both volumes will be found particularly described in the _Ædes     Althorpianæ_, vol. ii. p. 285-290.]  [10] Lord Spencer has recently obtained a PERFECT COPY of this most rare     edition--by the purchase of the library of the Duke di Cassano, at     Naples. See the _Cassano Catalogue_, p. 116.  [11] A very particular description of this rare edition will be found in     the _Bibl. Spencer_, vol. ii. p. 141.  [12] See the _Bibliographical Decameron_, vol. i. p. cxcviii.  [13] See vol. ii. p. 73.  [14] See _Ottley's History of Engraving_, vol. i. p. 86; where a     fac-simile of this cut is given--which, in the large paper copies, is     coloured.  [15] See vol. ii. p. 134-5.

[17] The prologue of this metrical life begins thus:          _Ecce tuis parui uotis uenerande sacerdos           Cor quia de vro feruet amore mihi         Pontificis magna wilbroodi et psulis almus           Recurrens titulis inclyta gesta tuis         Sit lux inferior strepitant cum murmure rauco           illius egregi^{9} sermo meus meritis_      This life consists of only 11 leaves, having 23 verses in a full page.     It is printed in the _Lect. Antiq. of Canisius_, vol. ii. p. 463;     and the prose life is printed by _Surius_ and by _Mabillon_.  [18] Before described in the _Bibl. Spenceriana_; vol. IV. p. 508.  [19] The book in question has the following colophon:          _Hoc opus exiguum perfecit rite iohannes         Fabri: cui seruat lingonis alta lares.         Ac uoluit formis ipsum fecisse casellis.         M.cccc.lxxcii de mense maii_.      The _s_ is very singular, being smaller than the other letters,     and having a broken effect. This copy, in the Public Library at     Stuttgart, is not bound, but in excellent condition.     LETTER II.   THE ROYAL PALACE. A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NEGOTIATION. DANNECKER THE SCULPTOR. ENVIRONS OF STUTTGART.   The morrow is come; and as the morning is too rainy to stir abroad, I sit down to fulfil the promise of last night. This will be done with the greater cheerfulness and alacrity, as the evenings have been comparatively cooler, and my slumbers, in consequence, more sound and refreshing. M. LE BRET--must be the first name mentioned upon this occasion. In other words, the negotiation about the _two Virgils_, through the zeal and good management of that active Head-Librarian, began quickly to assume a most decided form; and I received an intimation from Mr. Hamilton, our Chargé d'Affaires, that the King expected to see me upon the subject at the \"circle\"--last Sunday evening.  But before you go with me to court, I must make you acquainted with the place in which the Court is held: in other words, with the ROYAL PALACE of STUTTGART. Take away the gilt cushion and crown at the top of it, and the front façade has really the air of a royal residence. It is built of stone: massive and unpretending in its external decorations, and has two wings running at right angles with the principal front elevation. To my eye, it had, at first view, and still continues to have, more of a Palace-like look than the long but slender structure of the Tuilleries. To the left, on looking at it--or rather behind the left wing is a large, well-trimmed flower-garden, terminating in walks, and a carriage way. Just in front of this garden, before a large bason of water, and fixed upon a sort of parapet wall--is a very pleasing, colossal group of two female statues--_Pomona_ and _Flora_, as I conceive--sculptured by Dannecker. Their forms are made to intertwine very gracefully; and they are cut in a coarse, but hard and pleasingly-tinted, stone. For out-of-door figures, they are much superior to the generality of unmeaning allegorical marble statues in the gardens of the Thuilleries.  The interior of the palace has portions, which may be said to verify what we have read, in boyish days, of the wonder-working powers of the lamp of Aladdin. Here are porphyry and granite, and rosewood, and satin-wood, porcelaine, and or-molu ornaments, in all their varieties of unsullied splendor. A magnificent vestibule, and marble staircase; a concert room; an assembly-room; and chamber of audience: each particularly brilliant and appropriate; while, in the latter, you observe a throne, or chair of state, of antique form, but entirely covered with curious gilt carvings--rich, without being gaudy--and striking without being misplaced. You pass on--room after room--from the ceilings of which, lustres of increasing brilliance depend; but are not disposed to make any halt till you enter a small apartment with a cupola roof--within a niche of which stands the small statue of _Cupid_; with his head inclined, and one hand raised to feel the supposed-blunted point of a dart which he holds in the other. This is called the Cupid-Room, out of compliment to DANNECKER the sculptor of the figure, who is much patronised by the Queen. A statue or two by Canova, with a tolerable portion of Gobeleine tapestry, form the principal remaining moveable pieces of furniture. A minuter description may not be necessary: the interiors of all palaces being pretty much alike--if we put pictures and statues out of the question.  From the Palace, I must now conduct you to the \"circle\" or Drawing Room--which I attended. Mr. Hamilton was so obliging as to convey me thither. The King paid his respects personally to each lady, and was followed by the Queen. The same order was observed with the circle of gentlemen. His Majesty was dressed in what seemed to be an English uniform, and wore the star of the Order of the Bath. His figure is perhaps under the middle size, but compact, well formed, and having a gentlemanly deportment. The Queen was, questionless, the most interesting female in the circle. To an Englishman, her long and popular residence in England, rendered her doubly an object of attraction. She was superbly dressed, and yet the whole had a simple, lady-like, appearance. She wore a magnificent tiara of diamonds, and large circular diamond ear rings: but it was her _necklace_, composed of the largest and choicest of the same kind of precious stones, which flashed a radiance on the eyes of the beholder, that could scarcely be exceeded even in the court-circles of St. Petersburg. Her hair was quietly and most becomingly dressed; and with a small white fan in her hand, which she occasionally opened and shut, she saluted, and discoursed with, each visitor, as gracefully and as naturally as if she had been accustomed to the ceremony from her earliest youth. Her dark eyes surveyed each figure, quickly, from head to foot--while ...      \"_Favours_ to none, to all she _smiles_ extends.\"  Among the gentlemen, I observed a young man of a very prepossessing form and manners--having seven orders, or marks of distinction hanging from his button-holes. Every body seemed anxious to exchange a word with him; and he might be at farthest in his thirtieth year. I could not learn his name, but I learnt that his _character_ was quite in harmony with his _person_: that he was gay, brave, courteous and polite: that his courage knew no bounds: that he would storm a citadel, traverse a morass, or lead on to a charge, with equal coolness, courage, and intrepidity: that repose and inaction were painful to him--but that humanity to the unfortunate, and the most inflexible attachment to relations and friends, formed, equally, distinctive marks of his character. This intelligence quite won my heart in favour of the stranger, then standing and smiling immediately before me; and I rejoiced that the chivalrous race of the _Peterboroughs_ was not yet extinct, but had taken root, and \"borne branch and flower,\" in the soil of Suabia.  When it came to my turn to be addressed, the king at once asked--\"if I had not been much gratified with the books in the Public Library, and particularly with two _ancient editions_ of Virgil?\" I merely indicated an assent to the truth of this remark, waiting for the conclusion to be drawn from the premises. \"There has been some mention made "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17624"],["title","A Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France and Germany, (#7)"],["body","me (resumed his Majesty) about a proposed exchange on the part of Lord Spencer, for these two ancient editions, which appear to be wanting in his Lordship's magnificent collection. For my part, I see no objection to the final arrangement of this business--if it can be settled upon terms satisfactory to all parties.\" This was the very point to which I was so anxious to bring the conference. I replied, coolly and unhesitatingly, \"that it was precisely as his Majesty had observed; that his own Collection was strong in _Bibles_, but comparatively weak in Ancient _Classics_: and that a diminution of the _latter_ would not be of material consequence, if, in lieu of it, there could be an increase of the _former_--so as to carry it well nigh towards perfection; that, in whatever way this exchange was effected, whether by money, or by books, in the first instance, it would doubtless be his Majesty's desire to direct the application of the one or the other to the completion of his _Theological Collection_.\"  The King replied \"he saw no objection whatever to the proposed exchange--and left the forms of carrying it into execution with his head librarian M. Le Bret.\" Having gained my point, it only remained to make my bow. The King then passed on to the remainder of the circle, and was quickly followed by the Queen. I heard her Majesty distinctly tell General Allan,[20] in the English language, that \"she could never forget her reception in England; that the days spent there were among the happiest of her life, and that she hoped, before she died, again to visit our country.\" She even expressed \"gratitude for the cordial manner in which she had been received, and, entertained in it.\"[21]  The heat had now become almost insupportable; as, for the reason before assigned, every window and door was shut. However, this inconvenience, if it was severe, was luckily of short duration. A little after nine, their Majesties retired towards the door by which they had entered: and which, as it was reopened, presented, in the background, the attendants waiting to receive them. The King and Queen then saluted the circle, and retired. In ten minutes we had all retreated, and were breathing the pure air of heaven. I preferred walking home, and called upon M. Le Bret in my way. It was about half past nine only, but that philosophical bibliographer was about retiring to rest. He received me, however, with a joyous welcome: re-trimmed his lamp; complimented me upon the success of the negotiation, and told me that I might now depart in peace from Stuttgart--for that \"the affair might be considered as settled.\"[22]  I have mentioned to you, more than once, the name of DANNECKER the sculptor. It has been my good fortune to visit him, and to converse with him much at large, several times. He is one of the most unaffected of the living Phidias-tribe; resembling much, both in figure and conversation, and more especially in a pleasing simplicity of manners, our celebrated _Chantry_. Indeed I should call Dannecker, on the score of art as well as of person, rather the Chantry than the _Flaxman_ or _Canova_ of Suabia. He shewed me every part of his study; and every cast of such originals as he had executed, or which he had it in contemplation to execute. Of those that had left him, I was compelled to be satisfied with the plaster of his famous ARIADNE, reclining upon the back of a passant leopard, each of the size of life. The original belongs to a banker at Frankfort, for whom it was executed for the sum of about one thousand pounds sterling. It must be an exquisite production; for if the _plaster_ be thus interesting what must be the effect of the _marble_? Dannecker told me that the most difficult parts of the group, as to detail, were the interior of the leopard's feet, and the foot and retired drapery of the female figure--which has one leg tucked under the other. The whole composition has an harmonious, joyous effect; while health, animation, and beauty breathe in every limb and lineament of Ariadne.  But it was my good fortune to witness _one_ original of Dannecker's chisel--of transcendent merit. I mean, the colossal head of SCHILLER; who was the intimate friend, and a townsman of this able sculptor. I never stood before so expressive a modern countenance. The forehead is high and wide, and the projections, over the eye-brows, are boldly, but finely and gradually, marked. The eye is rather full, but retired. The cheeks are considerably shrunk. The mouth is full of expression, and the chin somewhat elongated. The hair flows behind in a broad mass, and ends in a wavy curl upon the shoulders: not very unlike the professional wigs of the French barristers which I had seen at Paris. Upon the whole, I prefer this latter--for breadth and harmony--to the eternal conceit of the wig à la grecque. \"It was so (said Dannecker) that Schiller wore his hair; and it was precisely with this physiognomical expression that he came out to me, dressed en roquelaure, from his inner apartment, when I saw him for the last time. I thought to myself--on so seeing him--(added the sculptor) that it is thus that I will chisel your bust in marble.\" Dannecker then requested me to draw my hand gently over the forehead--and to observe by what careful, and almost imperceptible gradations, this boldness of front had been accomplished; I listened to every word that he said about the extraordinary character then, as it were, before me, with an earnestness and pleasure which I can hardly describe; and walked round and round the bust with a gratification approaching to ecstacy. They may say what they please--at Rome or at London--but a _finer_ specimen of art, in its very highest department, and of its particular kind, the chisel of _no living_ Sculptor hath achieved. As a bust, it is perfect. It is the MAN; with all his MIND in his countenance; without the introduction of any sickly airs and graces, which are frequently the result of a predetermination to treat it--as _Phidias_ or _Praxiteles_ would have treated it! It is worth a host of such figures as that of Marshal Saxe at Strasbourg.  \"Would any sum induce you to part with it?\"--said I, in an under tone, to the unsuspecting artist ... bethinking me, at the same time, of offering somewhere about 250 louis d'or--\"None:\" replied Dannecker. \"I loved the original too dearly to part with this copy of his countenance, in which I have done my utmost to render it worthy of my incomparable friend.\" I think the artist said that the Queen had expressed a wish to possess it; but he was compelled to adhere religiously to his determination of keeping it for himself. Dannecker shewed me a plaster cast of his intended figure of CHRIST. It struck me as being of great simplicity of breadth, and majesty of expression; but perhaps the form wanted fulness--and the drapery might be a little too sparing. I then saw several other busts, and subjects, which have already escaped my recollection; but I could not but be struck with the quiet and unaffected manner in which this meritorious artist mentioned the approbation bestowed by CANOVA upon several of his performances. He is very much superior indeed to Ohmacht; but comparisons have long been considered as uncourteous and invidious--and so I will only add, that, if ever Dannecker visits England--which he half threatens to do--he shall be fêted by a Commoner, and patronised by a Duke. Meanwhile, you have here his Autograph for contemplation.  [Illustration: Autograph of Dannecker]   [20] Afterwards Sir Alexander Allan, Bart. I met him and Captain C * * *,     of the Royal Navy, in their way to Inspruck. But Sir Alexander (than     whom, I believe a worthier or a braver man never entered the     profession of which he was so distinguished an ornament) scarcely     survived the excursion two years.  [21] The Queen of Würtemberg survived the levee, above described, only a     few months. Her DEATH was in consequence of over-maternal anxiety     about her children, who were ill with the measles. The queen was     suddenly called from her bed on a cold night in the month of January     to the chamber where her children were seriously indisposed. Forgetful     of herself, of the hour, and of the season, she caught a severe cold:     a violent erysipelatous affection, terminating in apoplexy, was the     fatal result--and SHE, who, but a few short-lived months before, had     shone as the brightest star in the hemisphere of her own court;--who     was the patroness of art;--and of two or three national schools,     building, when I was at Stuttgart, at her own expense--was doomed to     become the subject of general lamentation and woe. She was admired,     respected, and beloved. It was pleasing, as it was quite natural, to     see her (as I had often done) and the King, riding out in the same     carriage, or phaeton, without any royal guard; and all ranks of people     heartily disposed to pay them the homage of their respect. In a letter     from M. Le Bret, of the 8th of June 1819, I learnt that a magnificent     chapel, built after the Grecian model, was to contain the monument to     be erected to her memory. Her funeral was attended by six hundred     students from Tubingen, by torch light.  [22] For the sake of juxta-position, I will here mention the SEQUEL, as     briefly as may be. The \"affair\" was far from being at that time     \"settled.\" But, on reaching Manheim, about to recross the Rhine, on my     return to Paris--I found a long and circumstantial letter from my     bibliographical correspondent at Stuttgart, which seemed to bring the     matter to a final and desirable issue. \"So many thousand francs had     been agreed upon--there only wanted a well bound copy of the     _Bibliographical Decameron_ to boot:--and the Virgils were to be     considered as his Lordship's property.\" Mr. Hamilton, our Chargé     d'Affaires, had authority to pay the money--and I ... walked instantly     to"]]]
