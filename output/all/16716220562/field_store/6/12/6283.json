But they have just as much or as little as the honourable members of the Prussian Diet.  All schemes of reform emanate from the Emperor.  The people have no right to be Emperor.  Surely that is simple enough?  To bulk larger in the public eye, William dwells apart; he can no longer endure that any one should presume to think himself useful or agreeable to him or to give him advice.  He is fulfilling the prediction that he made of himself when he was twenty-one: \"When I come to reign I shall have no friends; I shall only have dupes.\"  More infatuated with himself than ever, the Emperor wears his mystic helmet _à la_ Lohengrin, tramples the purple underfoot and has the throne surrounded by his life-guards, wearing the iron-plated bonnets of the days of Frederick II.  Thus he deludes himself with the dream of absolute authority.  His mania for power is boundless, his pride knows no limits.  He recognises only God and Himself.  To his recruits, he says: \"After having sworn fidelity to your masters upon earth, swear the same oath to your Saviour in Heaven!\"  But in his moments of solitude, in the privacy of the potentate's toilet-chamber, must it not be dreadful for him to reflect that his silver helmet rests on ears that suppurate, that his voice comes from a mouth afflicted with fistula of the bone, and that there are days when his sceptre is at the mercy of the surgeon's knife?    December 11, 1890. [17]  The rumour has spread, and has not yet been authoritatively contradicted, that William is suffering from disease of the brain.  Is not this in itself good and sufficient reason to make him wish to prove that no one in his Empire can do as much brain work as he can?  We, whose minds are so confused in the endeavour to follow William's movements at a distance, where little things escape us, can imagine what it must be to observe them from close at hand!  One of the chief glories of his reign will be to have produced the diagnosis of a new disease, \"locomotor Caesarism\" of the restless type. Before his case, these symptoms were always associated with paralysis. Here is a discovery that may turn out to be more genuine that that of Dr. Koch.  The unfortunate Koch is one more of William's victims.  It was his Imperial will that Germany should wake up one morning to find herself possessed of a Pasteur of her own.  He could not even wait long enough to allow the necessary experiments to be made with a remedy which is so violent that it may well be mortal.  At the word of command \"Forward, march,\" Koch found himself propelled by His Majesty into the position of a benevolent genius.   Dr. Henri Huchard has expressed his opinion of Koch's method in the following words: \"In therapeutics, daring is always permissible, so long as it preserves its respect for human life.\"  A few days ago, the German Emperor was thrusting his advice on a man of science, to-day he is overthrowing the most venerable traditions of the Prussian monarchy with the scheme of M. Miguel, the new system, for taxing incomes and legacies, opening a campaign against the nobility and the old conservatives.  With the help of an official of the \"younger generation\"--for thus is he pleased to describe his Minister of Finance--he begins to make war on the \"old school.\"  With the \"old school\" in his mind's eye, he conceives another idea, namely, that of a new method of teaching in the elementary, secondary and high schools, upon which it will be unnecessary to improve for the next hundred years.  He sets the faithful M. Hinzpeter to work, and compels him to toil night and day to prepare a complete programme in all haste--whereupon behold the Emperor holding forth to the collegians just as he does to the recruits.  \"Down with Latin!\" cries William.  \"Let us make Germans instead of Greeks and Romans!  Let us teach our children the practical side of life.\"  All of which does not prevent him from adding: \"Let us teach them the fabulous history of our race.\"  William insists that his name shall be on every lip--that he be recognised as father of his workmen, father of collegians, father of the country at large.  It is his ambition to look upon all his subjects as his sons.  Much good may it do them!    December 27, 1890. [18]  The Emperor of Germany, determined supporter of triumphant militarism, and, therefore, the deadly enemy of every permanent and beneficial social reform, has suddenly stopped short in his attempts to improve the condition of the masses.  If you ask: To whom does William II give satisfaction? the only possible answer is: Himself!  For it matters nothing to him whether these plans of his succeed or fail.  The thing that does matter to him is, that he should have left his mark everywhere, and that, after a quarter of a century or more, legislators shall inevitably find, in every project of law, the sacred mark, the holy seal of William's mind.

January 12, 1891. [1]  The Berlin _Post_ thinks that we should be able to get on very well without Alsace-Lorraine, and that the best thing for us to do, if we are \"reasonable souls,\" is simply to become reconciled with Germany.  The reasonable ones among us are directed to prove to us others (who must needs be \"gloomy lunatics\") the folly of believing in the Russian alliance, and gently to prepare us for a last and supreme act of cowardly surrender--namely, to give William II a friendly reception at Cannes or in Paris.  The chief argument with which they would persuade us is, that Berlin is quite willing to receive our philosophers and our doctors.  But we are more than quits on this score, seeing the number of Germans that we entertain and enrich in Paris.  To prove that we owe them nothing in the matter of hospitality, it should be enough to ascertain on the 27th inst. how many Germans will celebrate the birthday of William II in one of our first-rate hotels.  Heaven be praised, hatred of the Hohenzollerns is not yet dead in France! If it be true that the corpse of an enemy always smells sweet, the person of a living enemy must always remain hateful.  Before we discuss the possibility of the King of Prussia visiting Paris, however, let us wait until M. Carnot has been to Berlin.    January 29, 1891. [2]  The nearer we approach to 1900, the less desire have I to be up-to-date. I persist in the belief that the solution of the problems of European policy in which France is concerned, would have been more readily attainable by an old fashioned fidelity to the memory of our misfortunes than by scorning to learn by our experience.  Certain well-meaning, end-of-the century sceptics may be able lightly to throw off that past in which they have (or believe they have) lost nothing, whilst we of the \"mid-century\" are borne down under its heavy burden.  These people neglect no occasion to advise us to forget and they do it gracefully, lightly showing us how much more modern it is to crown oneself with roses than to continue to wear tragically our trailing garments of affliction and mourning.  I should be inclined to judge with more painful severity those witty writers who advise us to light-hearted friendship with Bismarck the \"great German,\" with William the \"sympathetic Emperor\", with Richard Wagner \"the highest expression of historical poetry and musical art,\" those men who prepared and who perpetuate Prussia's victories--I should judge them differently, I say, were it not that I remember my former anger against the young decadents and the older _roués_ in the last days of the Empire.  All of them used to make mock of patriotism in a jargon mixed with slang which greatly disturbed the minds of worthy folk, who became half ashamed at harbouring, in spite of themselves, the ridiculous emotions \"of another age.\"  But these same decadents and _roués_, after a period of initiation somewhat longer than that which falls to the lot of ordinary mortals, behaved very gallantly in the Terrible Year.  True, in order to convince them that they had been wrong in regarding the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17737"],["title","The Schemes of the Kaiser (#7)"],["body","of Schleswig-Holstein as a trifle, wrong in applauding the victory of Sadowa, and declaring that each war was the last, it required such disasters, that not one of us can evoke without trembling the memory of those events, whose lurid light served to open the eyes of the blindest.  \"Understand this,\" Nefftzer was wont to insist (before 1870), \"we can never wish that Prussia should be victorious without running the risk of bringing about our own defeat; we must not yield to any of her allurements nor even smile at any of her wiles.\"  If the people of Paris applaud Wagner, he who believed himself to be the genius of victorious Germany personified, it can only be in truth that Paris has forgotten.  And in that case, there will only be left, of those who rightly remember, but a few mothers, a few widows, a few old campaigners and your humble servant!  So that we may recognise each other in this world's wilderness, we will wear in our button-holes and in our bodices that blue flower which grows in the streams of Alsace-Lorraine, the forget-me-not!  And we shall vanish, one by one, disappearing with the dying century, _that is, unless some surprise of sudden war, such as one must expect from William II, should cure us of our antiquated attitude_.  Need I speak of these rumours of disarmament, wherewith the German Press now seeks to lull us, rumours which spread the more persistently since, at last, we have come to believe in our armaments?  \"Germany is satisfied and seeks no further conquests,\" says William II. But does it follow that we also should be satisfied with the bitter memories of our defeats, and resolved that, no matter what may happen, we shall never object to Prussia's victories?  I never forget that William II, as a Prince, in his grandfather's time, said, \"When I come to the Throne I shall do my best to make dupes.\"  This rumour of disarmament is part of his dupe-making.  The real William reveals himself in his true colours when he awakens his aide-de-camp in the middle of the night, to go and pay a surprise visit to the garrison at Hanover.  In Militarism the German Emperor finds his complete expression and the emblem of his character.  His empire is not a centralised empire and only the army holds it together.  And for this reason William has favoured the army this year at the expense of all the other public services, by increasing its peace-footing strength and the number of its officers, by ordering more than two hundred locomotives and a corresponding amount of rolling stock intended to expedite mobilisation.  Seventy new batteries have been formed.  The artillery has been furnished with new ammunition, the infantry with new weapons, and the strategic network of railways has been completed!  Abroad, every one, friends and enemies alike, think as I do on the subject of disarmament.  \"This plaything of William the Second's leisure moments,\" says _The Standard_ (although a fervent admirer of Queen Victoria's grandson), \"this disarmament idea, is a myth.\"  Our faithful and loyal supporter, the _Sviet_, says the same thing: \"Disarmament is a myth, Germany talks of it unceasingly, but she strengthens her frontiers, east and west.  On the north,\" adds the Russian organ, \"she is converting Heligoland into a fortress; on the south-east, she is increasing the defences of Breslau, and holds in readiness two thousand axle-trees _of the width of the Russian railways_.\"  It is only in France that a few up-to-date journalists take this disarmament talk of the German Emperor quite seriously.  To them, we may reply by a quotation from the official organ of the \"great German.\"  \"The course of historic events,\" says the _Hamburger Nachrichten_, \"is opposed to any realisation of the idea of disarmament, and justifies the opinion expressed by Von Moltke, who declared war to be in reality a necessary element in the order of things, of itself natural and divine, which humanity can never give up without becoming stagnant and submitting to moral and physical ruin.\"  There you have the genuine style of Bismarck, of the man who invented the formula--\"the Right of Might.\"  One thing--and one thing only--might possibly lead William II to entertain seriously this idea of disarmament, and that would be for Bismarck to oppose it.  Truly, there is something extremely pleasant in this duel between the two ex-accomplices!  Bismarck terrorising socialism, William coaxing and wheedling it, for no other tangible purpose than to act in opposition to him whose power he has overthrown.  What an eccentric freak is this German Emperor!  One day he sends the Sultan a sword of honour, a bitter jest for one who has never known anything but defeat!  The next, he proposes to take back the command of the fleet from his brother Henry, and in order to get rid of him conceives the plan of making Alsace-Lorraine and Luxembourg into a new kingdom.  At the same time he proposes to provide the Grand Duke of Luxembourg with a guard of honour, a guard _à la Prudhomme_, whose business it would be to defend and to fight him.  The State Council of the patriotic Grand Duchy is aroused, and denies the right of Prussia on any pretext to interfere in its affairs.  Boldly it reminds the Powers signatory to the Convention of 1867 of their pledges.  And with all his mania for governing the world at large, William II would seem to be possessed of the evil eye, and to bring misfortune to all whom he honours with his friendship for any length of time.    February 10, 1891.  It looks as if poor Bismarck were about to be treated just as he treated Count von Arnim.  Can it be that everything must be paid for in this world, and that a splendid retributive justice rules the destiny even of super-men and punishes them for committing base actions?  It is rumoured that the Duke of Lauenbourg (Bismarck) is threatened with prosecution on a charge of _lèse majesté_, which the lawyers of the Crown will not have very much trouble in proving against him.  That any one should dare to criticise the Emperor's policy, even though it be Bismarck, or that any one, even be it Count Waldersee, should express a personal opinion in his presence, is more than William II will tolerate.  The \"sympathetic Emperor\" has a cruel way of doing things.  Before striking his victims it is his wont to give them some public mark of his esteem and good-will.  Small and great, they pass before him, sacrificed each in his turn, so soon as they have come to believe themselves for a moment in the enjoyment of his favour.  Thus Colonel Kaissel, aide-de-camp to the Emperor, is about to be shelved.  Lieutenant von Chelin has been removed from the Court, General von Wittich has already lost his fleeting favour, and the moderating influence of Major de Huene, erected on the ruins of that of Von Falkenstein, proves to be equally short-lived.  Three generals in command of army corps are now threatened--that is, of course, unless a fortnight hence they should prove to have reached the highest pinnacle of favour.  Three months ago Von Moltke declared that he and Bismarck would live long enough to be able to say \"Farewell to the Empire.\"  On the other hand, Von Puttkamer seems to be regaining something of favour, and Prince Battenberg has been welcomed to the old Castle; strange plans concerning him are being hatched in the brain of William II.  Prince Henry has been brought back, ostensibly to take part in the Councils of the Government, but in reality that he may be watched the more closely.  He also has received a letter in which he is publicly thanked for the services he has rendered.  If I were in his place I should be very uneasy, seeing the kind of brother that he was, the most changeable the most jealous, and the most suspicious of men.  There is a false ring about this letter to Prince Henry, just as there was in those which the Emperor addressed to Count Waldersee and to Bismarck. Gratitude is a word that William often thinks fit to use, but it is a sentiment that he is careful never to indulge in.  It is impossible to discover any sign of a heart in the actions of the German Sovereign.  One may therefore predict that he will continue to show an ever increasing preference for distinguished personalities, whom it may please him to destroy, or creatures who would be the butts of his malicious sport, rather than to encourage the kind of public servants who strive continually to increase their efficiency, so as to serve him better.  Instead of being simply good and ruling benevolently, he aspires to be first a sort of pope, imposing upon his people a social state composed of servility and compulsory comfort, and again a leader of crusades, drawing his people after him to the conquest of the world.  Spiritual and material interests, military organisation, he mixes and confuses them like everything else which occurs to his mind, and every day he does something to destroy the results of that marvellous continuity, which did more to establish the power of William I than the victories of Sadowa and Sedan.  Ever more and more infatuated with the idea of military supremacy, he now pretends to be greatly concerned with the idea of disarmament.  And he, the avowed protector of socialists, looks as if he were about to accept from Mr. Dryander, the protestant presidency of that association of workmen, which is being organised for the purpose of fighting socialism.  Wherever we look, it is always the same, false pretences, trickery, lying, love of mischief-making and of persecution, innumerable and unceasing proofs given by William that his sovereign soul, irretrievably committed to restless agitation, will never know the higher and divine joys of peace.    March 1, 1891. [3]  For some months past, my dear readers, I have predicted that William II will not be satisfied without paying a visit to France.  The visit of the Empress Frederick should have prepared us for this amiable surprise.  But because the august mother"]]]
