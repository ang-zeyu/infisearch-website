He's too full-blooded to remain standing in the stable.\"  \"I'll see to it that he gets the exercise,\" answered Captain Putnam.  On the day that the horse was returned Jack, Pepper and Fred walked down to the boathouse, to look over the boats. As my old readers know, Jack owned a sloop called the _Alice_, while Fred possessed a similar craft named the _Ajax_. Besides these sloops, there were numerous boats belonging to the Hall.  \"Well, our sloops look natural,\" said the young major.  \"I was wishing this summer I could go out in the _Ajax_,\" answered Fred. \"What do you say if we take a little sail now?\"  \"In which boat, Fred?\" asked Pepper. \"We can't go out in both.\"  \"Make it the _Alice_!\" cried Jack.  \"No, the _Ajax_!\" came from Fred.  \"I'll toss up for it,\" went on Pepper and produced a cent. \"Head you win, tail you lose.\" And up into the air spun the coin.  \"Head!\" cried Fred.  \"Head it is, and we go out in the _Ajax_.\"  \"All right, but you'll have to go out in the _Alice_ next time,\" cried the young major.  \"By the way, did you hear about Tom Rollinson?\" asked Pepper, as he walked into the boathouse to inspect his locker there.  \"What of him?\" asked Fred.  \"The family were burnt out this summer and lost everything.\"  \"Lost everything?\" queried Jack. \"That's tough luck. I shouldn't want to lose all I had.\"  \"Well, it will happen sometimes,\" said Fred.  \"Well, some lose by fire and some lose in other ways,\" went on the young major. \"You have heard about Ritter. His father----\"  \"You shut your mouth about my father!\" roared a voice from behind a dressing-room door. \"My father is just as honest as anybody, and I won't have you or anybody else running him down!\" And then Reff Ritter appeared, minus his coat, vest and collar, and his face distorted with rage.  \"I didn't say your father was dishonest, Reff,\" returned Jack, as calmly as he could. \"I was simply going to state----\"  \"Oh, you needn't try to smooth it over, Jack Ruddy,\" fumed the bully. \"Don't imagine that I don't know all about the mean stories you and others are circulating about my family. You'd like to make out that my father is the worst swindler that ever lived, and I won't stand for it.\"  \"Reff, that isn't true,\" interrupted Pepper. \"Jack hasn't said a word against your father.\"  \"Oh, you can't bluff me, Pep Ditmore. I know better.\"  \"What Pepper says is true--I haven't said a word, Reff, truly I haven't. I heard that you had lost some of your money, and I said I was sorry to hear it--and I am sorry. I know how I'd feel if my father lost money. You----\"  \"Don't smooth it over, I tell you!\" roared the bully. \"I know you! You and your cronies have been down on me ever since I came to this school, and now you think you can crow over me, and maybe get me to leave Putnam Hall. But I am not going to leave, and if you dare to open your mouth against me I'll punch your head.\"  \"You'll not punch my head, Reff!\" answered Jack, and now his tones grew stern. \"If you don't want to believe me, you needn't. But I'll not let you threaten me.\"  \"Humph! You can't boss me, even if you are major of the battalion.\"  \"I don't want to 'boss' anybody. You behave yourself and leave me alone, and I'll leave you alone.\"  The loud talking had attracted the attention of a number of cadets, and they commenced to crowd around Jack and Ritter. Among the number were Gus Coulter and Nick Paxton.  \"Why don't you fight him, Reff?\" suggested Coulter.  \"That's the talk,\" added Paxton. \"Show him that he can't talk about you and your father as he pleases.\"  \"He won't fight; he is afraid,\" answered Reff Ritter, with a sneer in his tones.  \"I am not afraid, Ritter, and you know it,\" answered Jack, trying to keep his temper. \"But you know the rules, and I, as major of the cadets, am bound to uphold them.\"  \"Hit him one!\" whispered Coulter, in his crony's ear. \"I'll stand by you.\"  \"So will I,\" added Paxton.  \"Well, if you won't fight, take that for your impudence!\" cried Reff Ritter, and with a quick step forward, he slapped Jack on the cheek.  The blow was but a light one, yet it seemed to sink deep into Jack's very heart, and on the instant all thoughts of prudence and rules were cast aside. His face went white and his eyes flashed fire. Reff Ritter stepped back to guard himself, but before he could do so, Jack's arm shot out and a heavy blow landed on the bully's chin, sending him staggering into Coulter's arms.  \"That's the way to do it, Jack!\" came from Pepper.  \"He started it, now give him what he deserves!\" added Fred.  \"That's for the slap in the face, Reff Ritter!\" said Jack, in cold tones. \"Now mind and keep your distance.\"  \"Wait--I'm not done yet!\" yelled the bully, and doubling up his fists he hurled himself on the young major.  Several body blows were struck and then the two clinched. As Ritter was partly stripped for battle, while Jack had on his stiff uniform, the bully had a little the better of it from the beginning. Around and around the gymnasium floor they struggled.  \"Break away!\" cried several cadets. \"Break away!\"  \"I'll break if he will,\" answered Jack.  \"All right,\" answered Ritter, and the hold of each youth was loosened. But as they broke the bully tried to land his fist on Jack's ear.  \"Hi, that isn't fair, Ritter!\" cried Fred.  \"You keep out of this, Century!\" was Coulter's warning.  \"I'll not keep out, Coulter. Make Ritter fight fair.\"  Again the two cadets faced each other. Now Ritter was on his guard, and cleverly ducked a blow aimed at his face. Then he hit Jack on the chest and in the shoulder.  \"That's the talk,\" came gleefully from Paxton. \"Pummel him well while you are at it.\"  Again Jack struck out, and this time landed on the bully's arm. But then Ritter swung a heavy left-hander that took the young major in the ear and sent him staggering against Pepper.  \"Follow him up! Follow him up!\" screamed Coulter. \"You've got him going, Reff! Finish him!\"  Thus encouraged, Ritter leaped in and another blow landed on Jack's ear. He was a bit dazed, but shut his teeth hard and ducked under Ritter's arm. Then both sparred for an opening, circling around the gymnasium floor once more, the crowd of cadets around them growing larger and larger.  \"It's a great fight, all right!\"  \"Say, I hope none of the teachers come to cut it short.\"  \"They are about evenly matched aren't they?\"  \"I don't know; we'll soon find out.\"  So the talk ran on, but to it neither Jack nor Ritter paid attention. The bully was in a fierce rage, while Jack tried his best to keep cool. Suddenly Ritter leaped forward and two quick blows were delivered.  Jack knocked one blow aside and dodged the second. Then he let drive, right and left, as quick as lightning and with all his strength. One blow took the bully in the nose and the second in the mouth. Over he went against one of the wooden horses. Then his eyes suddenly closed, and in a limp mass he slid to the floor.     CHAPTER VI  CAPTAIN PUTNAM INVESTIGATES   \"Reff Ritter has been knocked out!\"  \"My, what blows they were!\"  \"Well, he brought it on himself,\" said Pepper.  \"That's what,\" added Fred. \"He struck Jack after Jack told him he didn't believe in fighting.\"  \"He couldn't save himself because he was too close to the wooden horse,\" came from Coulter, who felt bound to stick up for his crony. \"It wasn't fair to run him up against the horse.\"  \"Coulter, a poor excuse is worse than none,\" answered Dale.  \"Ritter was knocked out fair and square,\" came from Bart Connors.  While the talking was going on, Paxton had rushed off for water. Now he returned with a pailful and a sponge, and commenced to bathe the fallen one's face. Ritter soon opened his eyes and gave a groan.  \"Le--let me al--alone,\" he muttered.  \"Get up, Reff,\" said Paxton. \"Go for him again.\"  \"I--I can't,\" mumbled the bully, and now it was seen that two of his front teeth were loose. He stared around in a helpless fashion. Paxton put some more water on his face.  \"Has he had enough?\" demanded Jack, stepping up.  \"You go away,\" answered Coulter, surlily.  \"You wouldn't hit him when he's down, would you?\" snapped Paxton.  \"I asked you if he had enough. If he has, I'm going for a sail.\"  \"I'll--I'll finish this some other time,\" mumbled Ritter, as he glared at the young major.  \"No, Ritter, you'll finish it now if you finish it at all,\" answered Jack, coldly. \"You started this fight, and now you must take the consequences. Get up, if you want to go at it again.\"  \"I don't want to fight--now.\"  \"Then you acknowledge yourself beaten?\"  \"No, I don't.\"  \"Then get up. I don't want to wait here all afternoon for you.\"  \"He has all he wants,\" said Pepper. \"He won't get up.\"  \"It's your fight, Ruddy,\" cried Joe Nelson.  \"So it is,\" put in half a dozen cadets.  \"Ritter is beaten and he knows it,\" added Harry Blossom, the first lieutenant of Company A.  \"I--er--I won't fight any more now,\" mumbled the bully. He got up slowly and then, staggering to a bench, sank down heavily upon it. Evidently his punishment at Jack's hands had been heavy.  \"Boys! Boys! what is the meaning of this?\"  It was a loud and harsh voice from the doorway of the gymnasium that startled all of the assembled cadets. The next instant Josiah Crabtree, the head teacher, strode in.  \"Skip, Jack, here is old Crabtree!\"  \"Run for it, Reff!\"  \"I demand to know what is going on here?\" went on Josiah Crabtree, in his high-pitched voice. \"Who is fighting?\"  There was no reply. The assembled cadets looked at each other. No one felt like saying a word.  \"Ritter, have you been fighting?\" went on the head teacher,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17636"],["title","The Mystery at Putnam Hall: The School Chums' Strange Discovery (#6)"],["body"," noticing the bully's condition.  \"I was--er--that is, Ruddy attacked me, and I--er--I defended myself,\" stammered the defeated one.  \"Ruddy? Do you mean Major Ruddy?\" questioned Josiah Crabtree, in astonishment.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Mr. Crabtree, what Ritter says is untrue!\" burst out Jack. \"He hit me first.\"  \"But you have been fighting? You, the major of the school battalion! Disgraceful!\"  \"Wouldn't you fight if somebody slapped you in the face?\" demanded Jack, hotly.  \"You know the rules, Ruddy--and as major you ought to be the first to obey them.\"  \"I am willing to do that, sir. But I won't allow anybody to slap me in the face.\"  \"I didn't slap him,\" put in Ritter.  \"Yes, you did,\" came from Pepper.  \"It is true--I saw it,\" added Fred.  \"So did I,\" added a cadet named Brown.  \"If you were struck, Major Ruddy, it was your duty to report the occurrence at the office,\" said Josiah Crabtree, loftily. \"Such actions as these will most likely cost you your command.\"  \"Oh, what a shame!\" burst out Pepper.  \"Ditmore, I want no words from you!\" roared the head teacher, savagely.  \"But it wouldn't be fair to make Jack suffer for something like that,\" went on Pepper, bound to stick up for his chum.  \"Ha! you dare to talk back to me, Ditmore! Go to your room at once, and stay there until to-morrow morning.\"  \"But, Mr. Crabtree----\"  \"Not another word. Go to your room. And you, Ruddy and Ritter, report to me and to Captain Putnam at the private office at once.\"  There was no help for it, and with an angry look on his face, Pepper left the gymnasium and walked over to the school building.  \"I'll report as soon as I have washed up, Mr. Crabtree,\" said Ritter, sullenly.  \"So will I,\" added Jack.  \"I'll give you both ten minutes, no more!\" snapped the teacher, and then he strode from the gymnasium as swiftly as he had entered it.  As soon as Josiah Crabtree had departed a lively discussion commenced between the followers of the young major and of Reff Ritter. Only a few had seen the start of the quarrel and knew that it had been provoked entirely by the bully.  \"I'm afraid I am in for it,\" said Jack, dismally, to Fred. \"Ritter will do his best to make out that it was all my fault.\"  \"Well, I can testify that Ritter hit you first, and Pepper and Brown can do so, too,\" answered Fred.  \"Reff will get Coulter and Paxton to back him up.\"  \"But they weren't on hand when the quarrel started.\"  \"That is true--but they'll stick up for Reff, see if they don't.\"  \"I sincerely trust that Captain Putnam doesn't take away your majorship, Jack.\"  \"If he does that, I'll--well, never mind what I'll do.\"  \"If he did it to me, I'd feel like leaving.\"  \"I was going to say that. But I'll not do anything hastily,\" answered the young major, and heaved a deep sigh.  \"Want me to go along?\"  \"No, since Crabtree didn't ask any one. But I wish you'd hang around, so I can call on you.\"  \"I'll go to the library.\"  \"All right--and take Brown, if he'll go.\"  Jack washed up and brushed his uniform, and then made his way to Captain Putnam's private office. He found that Reff Ritter had hurried and gotten ahead of him, and was telling his story, both to the head of the school and to the first assistant teacher. Ritter's mouth, nose and one eye were swollen, and he looked anything but happy.  \"You may remain in the hallway until I call you, Major Ruddy,\" said Captain Putnam, when Jack appeared, and the young major had to go outside, closing the door after him.  The telling of Reff Ritter's story took some time, and he was asked several questions by Captain Putnam and Josiah Crabtree. He said that he had just been getting ready to take some gymnastic exercise when Jack and some of his chums had come in and begun to talk about his father, saying that they had heard he was dishonest.  \"Ruddy said he knew my father was dishonest,\" went on Reff Ritter. \"That made me mad and I ran out of the dressing-room and told him he ought to be ashamed of himself, that my father was as honest as anybody. Then he got on his high-horse and told me to shut up or he would knock me down. I told him it was a shame for him to speak so of my father. Then he got mad and all of a sudden he jumped at me and hit me in the mouth and the eye and then in the nose. Then I went for him, and we had it hot and heavy, until we bumped into one of the wooden horses and I went down. He tried to hit me after I was down, but Coulter and Paxton hauled him back. Then Mr. Crabtree came in.\"  \"A most disgraceful proceeding!\" cried Josiah Crabtree. \"And evidently Major Ruddy's fault entirely.\"  \"You are quite sure Ruddy started the quarrel?\" questioned Captain Putnam, gravely.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And he told the other cadets that your father was dishonest?\"  \"Yes, sir. That is what made me so mad. But I didn't hit him until he attacked me,\" added Ritter, hastily.  \"Who was present at the time?\"  \"Pepper Ditmore and Fred Century were with Ruddy, and Gus Coulter and Nick Paxton were With me.\"  \"Anybody else?\"  \"I didn't see anybody.\"  \"You got the worst of the fight.\"  \"Yes, sir. You see, he took me unawares. I guess I could whip him if we were to meet on equal terms,\" added Ritter.  \"You may retire to the next room, Ritter, while I question Major Ruddy.\"  \"Don't you believe me?\" cried the bully, in alarm.  \"One side of a story is only one side,\" answered Captain Putnam, non-committally.  \"I believe Ritter tells the truth,\" put in Josiah Crabtree. \"When I appeared Ruddy was very insolent and so was Ditmore. I sent Ditmore to his room as a punishment.\"  \"You may call Ruddy in,\" answered the head of the school, briefly. He understood Josiah Crabtree's dictatorial manner perfectly, and he only retained the man because of his unusual ability as a teacher.  Jack came in and was told to sit down in the chair Ritter had just vacated. Then Captain Putnam asked him to tell his story, and he related everything just as it had occurred.  \"Are you quite sure that you have told the plain truth, Major Ruddy?\" asked Captain Putnam, after he had finished.  \"Yes, sir,\" answered Jack, and looked the head of the school fairly and squarely in the face.  \"Your story does not agree with that told by Ritter.\"  \"I believe Ritter,\" broke in Josiah Crabtree. \"It was an outrage to drag in the boy's father simply because he has made some--er--unfortunate speculations. If I were you, Captain Putnam----\"  \"Wait a moment, Mr. Crabtree,\" interrupted the owner of the Hall. \"I am conducting this investigation. Now that we have heard the stories of the principals we'll hear what the witnesses have to say.\"  \"Fred Century was there, and he is in the library now,\" said Jack. \"Pepper Ditmore was there, too, but Mr. Crabtree sent him to his room.\"  \"I will question Century and Ditmore, and also Coulter and Paxton,\" answered Captain Putnam. \"You may retire to Classroom Three, Major Ruddy, until called.\"  Jack bowed and withdrew and walked to the classroom named. It was empty and he threw himself down on a seat and gave himself up to his reflections.  Fred was next called, and he was followed by Pepper. Both told practically the story related by Jack. In the meantime George Strong, the second assistant teacher, was sent off to summon Coulter and Paxton. He was gone the best part of a quarter of an hour, and when he came back his face was a study.  \"Captain Putnam, I have just made a discovery,\" he said. \"I would like to speak to you alone.\"  \"Alone?\" queried the head of the school, somewhat astonished.  \"Yes, sir, alone.\"  \"Very well, then, come into the next room,\" answered Captain Putnam.     CHAPTER VII  PEPPER MAKES A DISCOVERY   \"You do not--er--wish me present?\" came rather awkwardly from Josiah Crabtree.  \"Oh, that won't matter, Mr. Crabtree,\" answered George Strong. \"I did not desire any of the cadets present, that was all.\"  \"I do not care to intrude----\" commenced the dictatorial teacher.  \"As you please,\" answered Mr. Strong, with a shrug of his shoulders.  At first Josiah Crabtree was inclined to stand on his dignity and walk off, but his curiosity got the better of him and he followed Captain Putnam and George Strong into another office.  \"I went after Coulter and Paxton, as you directed me,\" said the second assistant teacher, when they were alone, and the door had been closed. \"At first I could not find them, but at last I located Paxton and then Coulter. Where do you suppose they were?\"  \"I have no idea,\" answered Captain Putnam.  \"Paxton was under the window of the office, listening to all that was going on. He was partly hidden behind a bush, so that nobody might see him.\"  \"Indeed! That is not to his credit. And Coulter?\"  \"Coulter was at another window, talking to Ritter. Ritter was giving him some instructions, and as I came up unnoticed I heard Ritter say, 'Now, don't make a mess of it. Tell the story just as I told it, and be sure to stick to it that Ruddy hit me first, and tell Nick to stick to that, too.' Those were his very words.\"  \"Is it possible! And what did Coulter say?\"  \"He promised to tell the story as Ritter wanted it, and said he would tell Paxton also to say that Ruddy struck the first blow.\"  \"Then he virtually admitted that he struck the first blow himself.\"  \"I should judge so, from his talk.\"  \"Major Ruddy said he did.\"  \"But Ruddy insulted him by talking of Mr. Ritter's losses----\" began Josiah Crabtree.  \"We'll look into that, Mr. Crabtree. Is that all, Mr. Strong?\"  \"No, I waited until Coulter joined Paxton. The two walked out on the campus, so I didn't catch what they said. I told them to follow me, and they are now out in the hall.\"  \"I will listen to what each of them has to say--and then I will examine Century and Ditmore again.\"  Coulter was called into the main office and asked a great number of questions. Captain Putnam was very stern, and soon had the cadet badly twisted in his statements. Then Paxton was told to come in, and on being questioned he became more confused even than Coulter. Then both were"]]]
