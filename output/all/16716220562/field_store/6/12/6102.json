Casa Grande ruin is, therefore, a relic of exceptional importance   and of essentially unique character.    Unfortunately this structure, like others erected by the most   advanced among the native races in the southwest, is of perishable   material; it is built of adobe, or rather of cajon, i.e., of a   puddled clay, molded into walls, dried in the sun. Such walls would   stand a short time only in humid regions; but in the arid region the   material is desiccated and baked under cloudless sky and sun for   many months at a time, and becomes so hard as to resist, fairly, the   rare storms of the region. It is by reason of climatal conditions   that cajon and adobe have come into general use for building in   southwestern United States, as in contiguous parts of Mexico; and it   is by reason of the same conditions that a few of the ancient   structures remain, and the best preserved of all is found in the   Gila valley, one of the most desert regions on the western   hemisphere. Yet the best of the cajon structures is perishable; so   long as the roof remains and the summits of the walls are protected,   disintegration proceeds slowly; but when the projecting roof is   removed, the rare but violent storms attack the walls, and they are   gradually channeled and gullied by the storm waters, while the   exterior surface gradually disintegrates and falls away under the   alternate wetting and drying. Even in the most arid regions, the   earth-built structures typical of the southwest are surely, albeit   slowly, ravaged and destroyed.    Several years ago Casa Grande ruin was brought into general notice   throughout the United States in consequence of southwestern   explorations; and in 1889, in response to a petition from several   illustrious Americans, the Congress of the United States, at the   instance of Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, made an appropriation of   $2,000 for the purpose of undertaking the preservation of this ruin.   This appropriation was expended in works urgently required to   prevent the falling of the walls and final destruction of the ruin;   they included metal stays for the walls, with brickwork for the   support and protection of the walls at their bases. Subsequently an   area of about 480 acres, including the ruin, was reserved from   settlement by Executive order. A custodian was also appointed, and,   as this office has been informed, has been continued down to the   present. This action on the part of the legislative and executive   branches of the Government can only be regarded as indicating a   desire and continued intention to preserve the ruin for the benefit   of the people of the United States.    The expenditures thus far authorized for the preservation of Casa   Grande ruin have been made in such manner as to meet the most urgent   needs only, and without them the structure would probably have been,   before this time, beyond the reach of preservation. The preservative   works were undertaken as emergency measures, rather than as steps in   carrying out a well-considered plan. From the outset it has been   understood by architects and archeologists and others familiar with   the structure that preservation can be insured only by throwing a   roof over the entire ruin in such manner as to protect the walls   from the fierce rainstorms which occasionally occur in the Gila   valley. No lesser work will preserve the ruin more than a generation   or two; and unless this work of roofing is contemplated and is   undertaken within a few years, the emergency work will be of little   avail and the money expended therein will be lost. Accordingly,   assuming a desire and continued intention on the part of the   Government to preserve this noteworthy relic, no hesitation is felt   in recommending that a suitable roof be placed over Casa Grande   ruin, at such time as may be expedient; and, in view of the rapidity   with which destruction is now in progress, there is no hesitation in   saying that the work should be undertaken at the earliest   practicable date.    It should be added that neither the Director nor any of the   collaborators in the Bureau of American Ethnology have visited Casa   Grande ruin for some three years, and accordingly that there are no   data in this office to indicate whether there is especially urgent   necessity for undertaking preservative work at this time; but much   confidence is placed in the judgment of the custodian, Reverend   Isaac T. Whittemore, who is known to several collaborators in the   Bureau.    The subject of the preservation of Casa Grande, in many respects the   most noteworthy ruin in the United States, is deemed important; and   if the Secretary of the Interior desires more specific information   concerning the present condition of the ruin, as a basis for further   action or judgment, it will be a pleasure to have an officer of this   Bureau make a special examination of, and report on, the ruin during   the autumn.    I have the honor to be, yours, with great respect,    W J McGee, _Acting Director_.       The Secretary of the Interior.

The Director of the Bureau of American Ethnology,               _Smithsonian Institution_.    Dear Sir: I am in receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo   submitting a report upon the recommendation made by the Reverend   Isaac T. Whittemore, custodian, that provision be made for further   protection of the Casa Grande ruin near Florence, Arizona, by the   erection of a suitable roof.    In response thereto I have to state that more specific information   concerning the present condition of the ruin and the probable cost   of providing proper protection for it is desirable in the   preparation of an estimate to be submitted to Congress with a view   of securing appropriation for the work. To this end the Department   gladly avails itself of your offer to send an officer of your   Bureau, at its expense, to make a special examination and report on   the ruin during the autumn of this year.    Very respectfully,       John M. Reynolds,           _Acting Secretary_.

Sir: Pursuant to your request of September 12, 1895, Mr W J McGee,   ethnologist in charge in the Bureau of American Ethnology, will in a   few days repair to Florence, Arizona, for the purpose of examining   Casa Grande ruin and determining the desirability of further works   for its preservation. * * *    In accordance with terms of preceding correspondence, it is of   course understood that the cost of the work will be borne wholly by   this Bureau.    I have the honor to be, yours, with great respect,    J. W. Powell, _Director_.   The Secretary of the Interior,       _Washington, D.C_.   VI. _Report of the Director of the Bureau of American Ethnology to the Secretary of the Interior on the examination of the condition of Casa Grande by Mr W J McGee, with a recommendation concerning its further protection_    Smithsonian Institution,       Bureau of American Ethnology,           _Washington, November 15, 1895_.    Sir: Pursuant to a proposal made in connection with a report from   this office relating to the ruins known as Casa Grande, near   Florence, Arizona, under date of August 28, 1895, and to the   acceptance of this proposal in a communication from the Department   of the Interior under date of September 12, 1895, Mr W J McGee,   ethnologist in charge of the Bureau of American Ethnology, has   within a few days made an examination of Casa Grande ruin with the   view of determining the need for further protection of the ruin by a   roof or otherwise.    There are in this office two series of photographs representing the   ruin. The first series was taken in 1892 before the protective works   authorized by the Congress were commenced; the second series   represents the work in progress. In the recent examination the   present condition of the ruin was carefully compared with the   condition represented in the photographs.    On comparing the profiles of the walls, it was found that in many   cases the irregular upper surfaces retain the exact configuration of   1892, even to the slightest knobs and rain-formed crevices; the   correspondence being so close as to show that the injury and loss by   weathering during the interim has been imperceptible. In some other   cases, notably along the southern and eastern walls, the profiles   are more extensively modified; some of the points and knobs shown in   the photographs are gone, some of the old crevices are widened and   deepened, and some new crevices appear; and in some parts it can be   seen that walls are lowered several inches. On the whole the   modification of the profiles of the walls is limited, yet such as to   indicate that destruction is proceeding at a not inconsiderable   rate.    On comparing the scars and crevices on the sides of the walls, it   was found that, while many remain essentially unchanged, most are   enlarged and deepened. This is particularly noteworthy on the   eastern and southern walls, which are most beaten by wind-driven   rains, and which are also most modified in profile. It would appear   that destruction is proceeding more rapidly along the sides of the   walls than along the crests.    On examining the walls with respect to apparent"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17488"],["title","The Repair of Casa Grande Ruin, Arizona, in 1891 (#8)"],["body","and   stability, it was found that nearly all are in fair or good   condition. The only portion that would seem in special danger is the   central section of the southern exterior wall. This section seems   insecure, and might at any time be overthrown by a heavy wind   following a rain storm. This section was not, unfortunately, braced   or tied to the stronger interior wall when the protective works were   carried out in 1892.    On examining the structure to ascertain the effect of the protective   works of 1892 in staying the destructive processes, particularly the   undermining of the walls by spattering rain and drifting sand, it   was found that in most cases the results have been excellent. On the   inner side of the middle section of the southern exterior wall   sapping is in progress at the ground level, and also along the rows   of joist openings for the first and second stories, and in a few   other places the protection seems inadequate; but in general the   anticipations of the projectors of the protective works seem to have   been realized.    The most serious of the destructive processes was sapping, and this   process has been nearly checked by the protective works. The second   was the desurfacing and subsequent eating away of the walls by   beating rains and frost, and this is still in progress at a moderate   rate. The least serious process was the wearing away of the crests   of the walls by rain and winds, and this is still going on at a   perceptible rate. It is impossible to determine, and difficult even   to approximate, the rate of destruction quantitatively, especially   so since it goes on cumulatively, with constantly increasing   rapidity, as the cemented surfaces are destroyed and the crevices   widen and deepen; but judging from the history of the ruin, and from   the rate of destruction indicated by comparing the photographs of   1892 with the present aspect, it would seem safe to conclude that,   if protected completely from vandalism, the ruin will be   comparatively little injured during the next five years, and will   stand perhaps half a century, without further protective works,   before moldering into dust.    In view of the slow yet ever increasing rate of destruction of the   ruin, and of its great interest as a tangible record of the   prehistoric inhabitants of this country, no hesitation is felt in   recommending that the structure be further protected, and   practically perpetuated, by a suitable roof, so designed as to   shield the walls from rain and sun and at the same time permit an   unobstructed view of the ruin from any direction.       *   *   *   *   *   I have the honor to be, sir, yours, with great respect,    J. W. Powell, _Director_.   Secretary of the Interior.     INDEX   Adobe construction, what constitutes                                 323  Burrell, H.
