(Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Fig. 1. Eskimo launching a seal harpoon by means of the throwing-stick. Mr. John Murdoch states that the hand is held much lower by the Point Barrow Eskimo, the harpoon resting as low as the shoulder, and that the movement of throwing the harpoon is quick, as in casting a fly in fishing.  [Illustration: Fig. 1. Eskimo using the throwing-stick.]   PLATE II.  (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Fig. 2. Greenland type of throwing-stick. The specific characteristics are the broad form; the scanty grooves for thumb and fingers; the absence of pegs, separate finger grooves, or index perforation; but the most noteworthy are the two grommets or eyelets to fit ivory pegs on the harpoon-shaft. The peculiar method of strengthening the ends with ivory pieces should also be noted. From Holsteinburg, Greenland, 1884. Catalogue number, 74126.  [Illustration: Fig. 2. Greenland throwing-stick, back and front.]   PLATE III.  (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Fig. 3. Ungava type of throwing-stick. The specific marks are the general outline, especially the fiddle-head ornament at the bottom; the bend upward at the lower extremity, the eccentric perforation for the index finger, and the groove for three fingers. Collected at Ungava, by Lucien M. Turner, 1884. Museum number, 76700.  [Illustration: Fig. 3. Ungava throwing-stick, front and back.]   PLATE IV.  (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Fig. 4. Cumberland Gulf type of throwing-stick. The specific marks are the broad clumsy form, the separate provision for the thumb and each finger, the bent lower extremity, and the broad furrow for the bird-spear. Accidental marks are the mending of the handle, the material of the stick, and the canine tooth for the spur at the bottom of the square groove. Collected in Cumberland Gulf, by W.A. Mintzer, in 1876. Museum number, 30013.  [Illustration: Fig. 4. Cumberland Gulf throwing-stick, back and front.]   PLATE V.  (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Fig. 5. Anderson River type. The specific marks are the extreme plainness of form, the lack of accommodations for the thumb and fingers, excepting the eccentric index-finger hole, the poor groove for the harpoon-shaft, and the absence of a hook or spur at the bottom of this groove. The accidental marks are cuts running diagonally across the back. In another specimen seen from the same locality the shaft groove is squared after the manner of the Cumberland Gulf type. Collected at the mouth of Anderson River, by R. Kennicott, in 1866. Museum number, 2267.  Fig. 6. Point Barrow type. The specific marks are the distinct handle without finger grooves, the very eccentric index-finger hole, the method of inserting the spur for the shaft, and the harpoon-shaft groove very shallow above and deep below. In the specimens shown by Mr. Murdoch there is great uniformity of shape. Collected at Point Barrow, by Lieut. P.H. Ray, in 1883. Museum number, 89902.  [Illustration: Fig. 5. Anderson River throwing-stick, front and back. Fig. 6. Point Barrow throwing-stick, front and back.]   PLATE VI.  (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Fig. 7. Kotzebue Sound type. The specific marks are the twisted handle, the broad shallow shaft groove, and, notably, the pocket for the index-finger tip-visible on the lower side, but nearly absent from the upper side, and lying directly under the shaft groove. In the examples before noted all the holes for the index finger are to one side of this shaft groove. Collected in Kotzebue Sound, by E.P. Herendeen, in 1874. Museum number, 16235.  Fig. 8. The Rodgers type, so called because the locality is doubtful. In specific characters it resembles Fig. 7. The differences are the three cavities for finger tips in the handle, the shaft groove very shallow and running out before reaching the index-finger cavity, and the delicate hook for the spear shaft resembling those farther south. Since writing this paper two throwing-sticks from Sitka have been seen in many respects resembling this form, but covered all over their surfaces with characteristic Thlinkit mythological figures, and having iron hooks at the lower end of the shaft groove. Collected by Commodore John Rodgers, in 1867. Museum number, 2533.  [Illustration: Fig. 7. Kotzebue Sound throwing-stick, front and back. Fig. 8. The Commodore Rodgers throwing-stick, front and back.]   PLATE VII.  (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Fig. 9. The Port Clarence and Cape Nome type. The notable characteristics are the occurrence of an ivory peg in the handle for the middle finger, the very small size of the handle, and the central index-finger pocket central in position but quite piercing the stick. Collected by E.W. Nelson, at Cape Nome, in 1880. Museum number, 44392.  [Illustration: Fig. 9. Port Clarence and Cape Nome throwing-stick, front and back.]   PLATE VIII.  (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Fig. 10. Norton Sound type, single-pegged variety. Except in the better finish, this type resembles the one last described. Collected by L.M. Turner, at Saint Michael's Island, in 1876. Museum number, 24338.  [Illustration: Fig. 10. Norton Sound throwing-stick, front and back.]   PLATE IX.  (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Fig. 11. Norton Sound type, two-pegged variety. In all respects, excepting the number of pegs, this resembles Figs. 9 and 10. In all of them the peg at the bottom of the groove is very clumsy. Collected in Norton Sound, by E.W. Nelson, in 1878. Museum number, 32995.  Fig. 12. Throwing-stick from Sabotnisky, on the Lower Yukon. It belongs to the Norton Sound type. The cavity on the upper side of the handle for the finger-tips is remarkable for the carving of a bird resembling figures seen on objects made by the Western Indians of the United States. Collected by E.W. Nelson, at Sabotnisky, in 1879. Museum number, 36013.  [Illustration: Fig. 11. Norton Sound throwing-stick, front and back. Fig. 12. Sabotnisky throwing-stick, front and back.]   PLATE X.  (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Fig. 13. Specimen from Yukon River, belonging to the Northern Sound one-pegged variety. Collected by E.W. Nelson, in 1879. Museum number, 38849.  [Illustration: Fig. 13. Yukon River throwing-stick, front and back.]   PLATE XI.  (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Fig. 14. Throwing-stick from Saint Michael's. This specimen is very noteworthy on account of the absence of the index-finger pocket, a mark characteristic of the Vancouver type, Fig. 17. If the middle peg of the Vancouver example were removed the resemblance would be close, but the clumsy spur at the bottom of the shaft groove is Norton Sound rather than Nunivak. Collected by Lucien M. Turner, at Saint Michael's, in 1876. Museum number, 24335.  [Illustration: Fig. 14. Saint Michael's throwing-stick, front and back.]   PLATE XII.  (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Fig. 15. Nunivak type. The characteristic marks are the absence of any cavity for the index finger, the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17606"],["title","Throwing-sticks in the National Museum (#4)"],["body","ely-fitting handle, the disposition of the finger-pegs, and the delicate point on the ivory spur at the bottom of the shaft groove. Collected by W.H. Dall, at Nunivak Island, in 1874. Museum number, 16239. (This specimen is left-handed.)  [Illustration: Fig. 15. Nunivak Island throwing-stick, front and back, left-handed.]   PLATE XIII.  (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Fig. 16. Specimen from Nunivak, right-handed. The cuts on the front and back are noteworthy. Collected by W.H. Dall, at Nunivak Island, in 1874. Museum number, 16238.  [Illustration: Fig. 16. Nunivak Island throwing-stick, front and back.]   PLATE XIV.  (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Fig. 17. Specimen from Cape Vancouver. In all respects it is like those of Nunivak, excepting a peg-rest for the little finger. Collected by E.W. Nelson, at Cape Vancouver, in 1879. Museum number, 38669.  [Illustration: Fig. 17. Cape Vancouver throwing-stick, front and back.]   PLATE XV.  (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Figs. 18, 19. Bristol Bay type. In no essential characters do these sticks differ from those of Nunivak. The handle is smaller, and they appear to have been made with steel tools. Fig. 18 collected by C.L. McKay, at Bristol Bay, Alaska, in 1883. Museum number, 72398. Fig. 19 collected by William J. Fisher, at Kadiak, in 1884. Museum number, 90467.  [Illustration: Fig. 18. Bristol Bay throwing-stick, front and back. Fig. 19. Bristol Bay throwing-stick, front and back.]   PLATE XVI.  (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Fig. 20. Unalashkan throwing-stick. It would be better to call this form the Southern type. The noticeable features in all our specimens are the parallel sides, the hard material, thinness, the carving for the fingers, but above all the reappearance of the eccentric cavity for the index finger. This cavity is not a great perforation, as in the Point Barrow type, but an eccentric pocket, a compromise between the Northern cavity and that of the East. Collected by Sylvanus Bailey, at Unalashka, in 1874. Museum number, 16076.  [Illustration: Fig. 20. Unalashkan throwing-stick, front and back.]   PLATE XVII.  (Mason. Throwing-sticks.)  Figs. 21, 22. Throwing-sticks of the Southern type. Fig. 21 is left-handed, collected by Dr. T.T. Minor, at Kadiak, in 1869. Museum number, 7933. Fig. 22 collected by W.H. Dall, at Unalashka, in 1873. Museum number, 12981. At Sitka two specimens were collected, unfortunately not figured, with the following characters laid down in the beginning of this paper: 1. Short, very narrow and deep, and carved all over with devices. 2. No handle distinct from the body. 3, 4, 5, 6. All wanting. 7. The index-finger cavity is near the center of the back, very like a thimble. Indeed this is a very striking feature. 8. The shaft groove occupies only the lower half of the upper surface. 9. The spur for the end of the weapon shaft is a long piece of iron like a knife-blade driven into the wood, with the edge toward the weapon shaft.  [Illustration: Fig. 21.
