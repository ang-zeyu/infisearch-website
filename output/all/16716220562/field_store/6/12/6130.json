He learned to ride, as a matter of course, when he was very young.  And all his life he has been an ardent and intrepid horseman.  A community devoted to the raising of fine saddle horses is all but certain to be a community devotedly fond of horse racing.  Love of racing is almost a universal trait in France; and in Tarbes it was a feature of the town life in which business went hand-in-hand with pleasure.  In an old French book published before Ferdinand Foch was born, I have found the following description of the crowds which flocked into Tarbes on the days of the horse markets and races:  \"On these days all the streets and public squares are flooded with streams of curious people come from all corners of the Pyrénées and exhibiting in their infinite variety of type and costume all the races of the southern provinces and the mountains.  \"There one sees the folk of Provence, irascible, hot-headed, of vigorous proportions and lusty voice, passionately declaiming about something or other, in the midst of small groups of listeners.  \"There are men of the Basque province--small, muscular and proud, agile of movement and with bodies beautifully trained; plain of speech and childlike in deed.  \"There are the men of the Béarnais, mostly from towns of size and circumstance--educated men, of self-command, tempering the southern warmth which burns in their eyes by the calm intelligence born of experience in life and also by a natural languor like that of their Spanish neighbors.  \"There are the old Catalonians, whose features are of savage strength under the thick brush of white hair falling about their leather-colored faces; the men of Navarre, with braided hair and other evidences of primitiveness--vigorous of build and handsome of feature, but withal a little subnormal in expression.  \"Then, in the midst of all these characteristic types, moving about in a pell-mell fashion, making a constantly changing mosaic of vivid hues, there are the inhabitants of the innumerable valleys around Tarbes itself, each of them with its own peculiarities of costume, manners, speech, which make them easily distinguishable one from another.\"  It was a remarkable crowd for a little boy to wander in.  If Ferdinand Foch had been destined to be a painter or a writer, the impressions made upon his childish mind by that medley of strange folk might have been passed on to us long ago on brilliant canvas or on glowing page.  [Illustration: Ferdinand Foch (center) as a Schoolboy.]  [Illustration: The School in Tarbes Where Foch Prepared for the Military Academy.]  But that was not the way it served him.  I want you who are interested to comprehend Ferdinand Foch, to think of those old horsefairs and race meets of his Gascony childhood, and the crowds of strange types they brought to Tarbes, when we come to the great days of his life that began in 1914--the days when his comprehension of many types of men, his ability to \"get on with\" them and harmonize them with one another, meant almost as much to the world as his military genius.  Tarbes had suffered so much in civil and religious wars, for many centuries, that not many of her ancient buildings were left.  The old castle, with its associations with the Black Prince and other renowned warriors, was a ramshackle prison in Ferdinand Foch's youth.  The old palace of the bishops was used as the prefecture, where Ferdinand's father had his office.  There were two old churches, much restored and of no great beauty, but very dear to the people of Tarbes nevertheless.  Ferdinand and his brothers and sister were very piously reared, and at an early age learned to love the church and to seek it for exaltation and consolation.  Later on in these chapters we shall see that phase of a little French boy's training in its due relation to a maréchal of France, directing the greatest army the world has ever seen.  The college of Tarbes, where Ferdinand began his school days, was in a venerable building over whose portal there was, in Latin, an inscription recording the builder's prayer:  \"May this house remain standing until the ant has drunk all the waves of the sea and the tortoise has crawled round the world.\"  Ferdinand was a hard student, serious beyond his years, but not conspicuous except for his earnestness and diligence.  When he was twelve years old, his fervor for Napoleon led him to read Thiers' \"History of the Consulate and the Empire.\"  And about this time his professor of mathematics remarked of him that \"he has the stuff of a polytechnician.\"  The vacations of the Foch children were passed at the home of their paternal grandparents in Valentine, a large village about two miles from the town of St. Gaudens in the foothills of the Pyrénées.  There they had the country pleasures of children of good circumstances, in a big, substantial house and a vicinity rich in tranquil beauty and outdoor opportunities.  And there, as in the children's own home at Tarbes, one was ashamed not to be a very excellent child, and, so, worthy to be descended from a chevalier of the great Napoleon.  In the mid-sixties the family moved from Tarbes to Rodez--almost two hundred miles northeast of their old locality in which both parents had been born and where their ancestors had long lived.  It was quite an uprooting--due to the father's appointment as paymaster of the treasury at Rodez--and took the Foch family into an atmosphere very different from that of their old Gascon home, but one which also helped to vivify that history which was Ferdinand's passion.  There Ferdinand continued his studies, as also at Saint-Étienne, near Lyons, whither the family moved in 1867 when the father was appointed tax collector there.  And in 1869 he was sent to Metz, to the Jesuit College of Saint Clément, to which students flocked from all parts of Europe.  He had been there a year and had been given, by unanimous vote of his fellow students, the grand prize for scholarly qualities, when the Franco-Prussian war began.  Immediately Ferdinand Foch enlisted for the duration of the war.     III  A YOUNG SOLDIER OF A LOST CAUSE  There is nothing to record of Ferdinand Foch's first soldiering except that from the dépôt of the Fourth Regiment of Infantry, in his home city of Saint-Étienne, he was sent to Chalon-sur-Saône, and there was discharged in January, 1871, after the capitulation of Paris.  He did not distinguish himself in any way.  He was just one of a multitude of youths who rushed to the colors when France called, and did what they could in a time of sad confusion, when a weak government had paralyzed the effectiveness of the army--of the nation!  Whatever blows Ferdinand Foch struck in 1870 were without weight in helping to avert France's catastrophe.  But he was like hundreds of thousands of other young Frenchmen similarly powerless in this: In the anguish he suffered because of what he could not do to save France from humiliation were laid the foundations of all that he has contributed to the glory of new France.  At the time when his Fall term should have been beginning at Saint Clément's College, Metz was under siege by the German army, and its garrison and inhabitants were suffering horribly from hunger and disease; Paris was surrounded; the German headquarters were at Versailles; and the imperial standards so dear to young Foch because of the great Napoleon were forever lowered when the white flag was hoisted at Sedan and an Emperor with a whole army passed into captivity.  How much the young soldier-student of the Saône comprehended then of the needlessness of the shame and surrender of those inglorious days we do not know.  He cannot have been sufficiently versed in military understanding to realize how much of the defeat France suffered was due to her failure to fight on, at this juncture and that, when a stiffer resistance would have turned the course of events.  But if he did not know then, he certainly knew later.  And as soon as he got where he could impress his convictions upon other soldiers of the new France he began training them in his great maxim: \"A battle is lost when you admit defeat.\"  What his devotion to Saint Clément's College was we may know from the fact of his return there to resume his interrupted studies under the same teachers, but in sadly different circumstances.  He found German troops quartered in parts of the college, and as he went to and from his classes the young man who had just laid off the uniform of a French soldier was obliged to pass and repass men of the victorious army of occupation.  The memory of his shame and suffering on those occasions has never faded.  How much France and her allies owe to it we shall never be able to estimate.  For the effect on Foch was one of the first acid tests in which were revealed the quality of his mind and soul.  Instead of offering himself a prey to sullen anger and resentment, or of flaring into fury when one time for fury was past and another had not yet come, he used his sorrow as a goad to study, and bent his energies to the discovery of why France had failed and why Prussia had won.  His analysis of those reasons, and his application of what that analysis taught him, is what has put him where he is to-day--and _us_ where _we_ are!  From Metz, Foch went to Nancy to take his examination for the Polytechnic at Paris.  Just why this should have been deemed necessary I have not seen explained.  But it was, like a good many other things of apparent inconsequence in this young man's life, destined to leave in him an impress which had much to do with what he was to perform.  I have seldom, if ever, studied a life in which events \"link up\" so marvelously and the present is so remarkably an extension of the past.  Nancy had been chosen by General Manteuffel, commander of the First German Army Corps, as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17511"],["title","Foch the Man: A Life of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Armies (#3)"],["body","ers, pending the withdrawal of the victors on the payment of the last sou in the billion-dollar indemnity they exacted of France along with the ceding of Alsace-Lorraine.  (For three years France had to endure the insolent victors upon her soil.)  And with the fine feeling and magnanimity in which the German was then as now peculiarly gifted General Manteuffel delighted in ordering his military bands to play the \"Retreat\"--to taunt the sad inhabitants with this reminder of their army's shame.  Ferdinand Foch listened and thought and wrote his examinations for the school of war.  Forty-two years later--in August, 1913--a new commandant came to Nancy to take control of the Twentieth Army Corps, whose position there, guarding France's Eastern frontier, was considered one of the most important--if not _the_ most important--to the safety of the nation.  The first order he gave was one that brought out the full band strength of six regiments quartered in the town.  They were to play the \"March Lorraine\" and the \"Sambre and Meuse.\"  They were to fill Nancy with these stirring sounds.  The clarion notes carrying these martial airs were to reach every cranny of the old town.  It was a veritable tidal wave of triumphant sound that he wanted--for it had much to efface.  Nancy will never forget that night!  It was Saturday, the 23d of August, 1913.  And the new commandant's name was Ferdinand Foch!  Less than a year later he was fighting to save Nancy, and what lay beyond, from the Germans.  And _this_ time there was to be a different story!  Ferdinand Foch was foremost of those who assured it.     IV  PARIS AFTER THE GERMANS LEFT  Ferdinand Foch entered the Polytechnic School at Paris on the 1st of November, 1871, just after he had completed his twentieth year.  This school, founded in 1794, is for the technical education of military and naval engineers, artillery officers, civil engineers in government employ, and telegraphists--not mere operators, of course, but telegraph engineers and other specialists in electric communication.  It is conducted by a general, on military principles, and its students are soldiers on their way to becoming officers.  Its buildings cover a considerable space in the heart of the great school quarter of Parts.  The Sorbonne, with its traditions harking back to St. Louis (more than six centuries) and its swarming thousands of students, is hard by the Polytechnic.  So is the College de France, founded by Francis I.  And, indeed, whichever way one turns, there are schools, schools, schools--of fine arts and applied arts; of medicine in all its branches; of mining and engineering; of war; of theology; of languages; of commerce in its higher developments; of pedagogy; and what-not.  Nowhere else in the world is there possible to the young student, come to advance himself in his chosen field of knowledge, quite such a thrill as that which must be his when he matriculates at one of the scores of educational institutions in that quarter of Paris to which the ardent, aspiring youth of all the western world have been directing their eager feet from time immemorial.  Cloistral, scholastic atmosphere, with its grave beauty, as at Oxford and Cambridge, he will not find in the Paris Latin Quarter.  Paris does not segregate her students.  Conceiving them to be studying for life, she aids them to do it in the midst of life marvelously abundant.  They do not go out of the world--so to speak--to learn to live and work in the world.  They go, rather, into a life of extraordinary variety and fullness, out of which--it is expected--they will discover how to choose whatever is most needful to their success and well-being.  There is no feeling of being shut in to a term of study.  There is, rather, the feeling of being \"turned loose\" in a place of vast opportunity of which one may make as much use as he is able.  To a young man of Ferdinand Foch's naturally serious mind, deeply impressed by his country's tragedy, the Latin Quarter of Paris in those Fall days of 1871 was a sober place indeed.  Beautiful Paris, that Napoleon III had done so much to make splendid, was scarred and seared on every hand by the German bombardment and the fury of the communards, who had destroyed nearly two hundred and fifty public and other buildings.  The government of France had deserted the capital and moved to Versailles--just evacuated by the Germans.  The blight of defeat lay on everything.  In May, preceding Foch's advent, the communards--led by a miserable little shoemaker who talked about shooting all the world--took possession of the buildings belonging to the Polytechnic, and were dislodged only after severe fighting by Marshal MacMahon's Versailles troops.  The cannon of the communards, set on the heights of Pére-Lachaise (the great city of the dead where the slumber of so many of earth's most illustrious imposed no respect upon the \"Bolsheviki\" of that cataclysm) aimed at the Pantheon, shot short and struck the Polytechnic.  One shell burst in the midst of an improvised hospital there, gravely wounding a nurse.  At last, on May 24, the Polytechnic was taken from the revolutionists by assault, and many of the communards were seized.  In the days following, the great recreation court of the school was the scene of innumerable executions, as the wretched revolutionists paid the penalty of their crimes before the firing squad.  And the students' billiard room was turned into a temporary morgue, filled with bodies of those who had sought to destroy Paris from within.  The number of Parisians slain in those days after the second siege of Paris has been variously estimated at from twenty thousand to thirty-six thousand.  And all the while, encamped upon the heights round about Paris, were victorious German troops squatting like Semitic creditors in Russia, refusing to budge till their account was settled to the last farthing of extortion.  The most sacred spot in Paris to young Foch, in all the depression he found there, was undoubtedly the great Dôme des Invalides, where, bathed in an unearthly radiance and surrounded by faded battle flags, lies the great porphyry sarcophagus of Napoleon I.  With what bitter reflections must the young man who had been nurtured in the adoration of Bonaparte have returned from that majestic tomb to the Polytechnic School for Warriors--to which, on the day after his coronation as Emperor, Napoleon had given the following motto:  \"Science and glory--all for country.\"  But, also, what must have been the young southerner's thought as he lifted his gaze on entering the Polytechnic and read there that self-same wish which was inscribed over the door of his first school in Tarbes:  \"May this house remain standing until the ant has drunk all the waves of the sea and the tortoise has crawled round the world.\"  The edifice in which part of the Polytechnic was housed was the ancient College of Navarre, and a Navarrias poet of lang syne had given to the Paris school for his countrymen this quaint wish, repeated from the inscription he knew at Tarbes.  France had had twelve different governments in fourscore years when Ferdinand Foch came to study in that old building which had once been the college of Navarre.  Houses of cards rather than houses of permanence seemed to characterize her.  Yet she has always had her quota--a larger one, too, than that of any other country--of those who look toward far to-morrows and seek to build substantially and beautifully for them.  That forward-looking prayer of old Navarre, and recollection of the centuries during which it had prevailed against destroying forces, was undoubtedly an aid and comfort to the heavy-hearted youth who then and there set himself to the study of that art of war wherewith he was to serve France.  Among the two hundred and odd fellow-students of Foch at the Polytechnic was another young man from the south--almost a neighbor of his and his junior by just three months--Jacques Joseph Césaire Joffre, who had entered the school in 1869, interrupted his studies to go to war, and resumed them shortly before Ferdinand Foch entered the Polytechnic.  Joffre graduated from the Polytechnic on September 21, 1872, and went thence to the School of Applied Artillery at Fontainebleau.  Foch left the Polytechnic about six months later, and also went to Fontainebleau for the same special training that Joffre was taking.  Both young men were hard students and tremendously in earnest.  Both were heavy-hearted for France.  Both hoped the day would come when they might serve her and help to restore to her that of which she had been despoiled.  But if any one, indulging in the fantastic extravagancies of youth, had ventured to forecast, then, even a tithe of what they have been called to do for France, he would have been set down as madder than March hares know how to be.     V  LEARNING TO BE A ROUGH RIDER  When Ferdinand Foch graduated, third in his class, from the artillery school at Fontainebleau, instead of seeking to use what influence he might have commanded to get an appointment in some garrison where the town life or social life was gay for young officers, he asked to be sent back to Tarbes.  No one, to my knowledge, has advanced an explanation for this move.  To so earnest and ambitious a student of military art (Foch will not permit us to speak of it as \"military science\") sentimental reasons alone would never have been allowed to control so important a choice.  That he always ardently loved the Pyrenean country, we know.  But to a young officer of such indomitable purpose as his was, even then, it would have been inconceivable that he should elect to spend his first years out of school in any other place than that one where he saw the maximum opportunity for development.  \"Development,\" mind you--not just \"advancement.\"  For Foch is, and ever has been, the kind of man who would most abhor being advanced faster than he developed.  He would infinitely rather be "]]]
