But at all events, daughter, we must consult with your grandpa before deciding. Have you had any talk with him on the subject?\"  \"No, mamma; I preferred coming to you first, and am almost sure grandpa will think it a matter for you to decide.\"  \"Probably; yet I shall want his opinion; and besides he is your guardian as well as your grandfather.\"  \"Along with you, mamma; and I love him as both, he is so dear and kind.\"  \"He is indeed,\" assented her mother. \"He has told me more than once or twice that my children are scarcely less dear to him than his own.\"  \"Partly because our father was his dear friend as well as his son-in-law,\" added Violet softly.  \"Yes; they were bosom friends before I was born,\" her mother said with a far-away look in her eyes.  \"Then you must have been very much younger than he, Grandma Elsie,\" remarked Grace, half inquiringly.  \"Sixteen years younger. I was in my ninth year when I saw him first, and more than twice that age before I thought of him as anything but a dear, kind friend--my father's friend and mine.\"  \"And after that he seemed to you to grow younger, did he not, mamma?\" asked Rosie.  \"Yes; when he joined us in Europe I had not seen him for two years, and as regarded age he seemed to have been standing still while I grew up to him; and in the daily and intimate intercourse of those months I learned that his worth was far greater than that of any other man of my acquaintance--excepting my father. Ah, there was never a better man, a truer friend, a kinder, more devoted husband and father than he.\"  The sweet voice trembled with emotion; she paused for a moment, then went on:  \"He does not seem dead to me--he is not dead, but only gone before into the immediate presence of the dear Master, where I hope one day to join him for an eternity of bliss.              \"''Tis there we'll meet                At Jesus' feet,           When we meet to part no more.'\"  Again there was a brief silence, presently broken by the coming of the captain and his two younger children. All three seemed pleased to find Rosie there, greeted her affectionately, and then the captain remarked, glancing from one to another:  \"It strikes me that you are all looking about as grave as if assembled to discuss the affairs of the nation. Can I have a voice in the subject, whatever it is?\"  \"Yes, Brother Levis,\" replied Rosie, \"I am trying to make arrangements for--doing what you have done twice. And perhaps, since you have had so much practice, you may be more capable than these other friends and relatives of giving me advice.\"  \"Something that I have done twice? What can that be?\"  \"Will Croly wants to help me,\" returned Rosie with a laugh and a blush.  \"Ah! now I understand. Is the vexing question as to the colour and material of the wedding gown?\"  \"Mamma thinks the first thing is to settle when the ceremony is to be performed. She does not seem to sympathise in Will's haste to have it over.\"  \"Which is not at all surprising,\" returned the captain, glancing at his two older daughters. \"I can quite understand the feeling. But what is the time proposed by Will?\"  \"June of this year.\"  \"June seems a very suitable month, but if you were my daughter I should say not June of this year--since you are both young enough to wait for that of next or the year after.\"  \"Ah, sir! that was not the way you talked when you wanted to rob mamma of one of her daughters.\"  \"No; but I was some years older than Mr. Croly is now, and your sister Violet very womanly in her ways.\"  \"And I am not? Ah, well! perhaps it is fortunate for me that the decision rest with mamma and grandpa.\"  \"So you, too, are in haste?\" queried the captain, regarding her with a look of amusement.  \"Not at all,\" she returned, drawing herself up with an air of pretended indignation. \"Who would be in haste to leave such a home and mother as mine? If I consulted only my own feelings I should be more than willing to wait another year.\"  \"Then why not decide to do so?\" he asked with a quizzical look.  \"Because I really have some regard for the wishes of my betrothed.\"  \"And it makes it hard for you that the different ones you love cannot agree so that you might please them all,\" remarked Grace, then exclaimed, \"Ah, here comes grandpa!\" as at that moment the Ion carriage turned in at the great gates.  Mr. Dinsmore seldom let a day pass without a more or less extended interview with his eldest daughter, and had now come for a call at Woodburn, bringing his wife with him.  When the usual greetings had been exchanged the subject of Rosie's approaching marriage and the letter from Mr. Croly, urging that it take place speedily, were introduced, and after some discussion it was decided to let him have his own way. The day was not fixed upon any farther than that it should be near the end of the month of June, and with that Rosie seemed satisfied.  \"Now, mamma,\" she said, \"I think we may go on and discuss minor details, such as dresses and ornaments for bride and attendants.\"  \"Very well, daughter; you may give us your views on the subject. You will want your own dress of some rich white material, I suppose?\"  \"Yes, mamma; of Bengaline silk, richly trimmed with lace; and I must have a veil and orange blossoms; also a bouquet of bride roses and smilax. Lu and Grace, you will want white silk dresses, won't you?\"  \"Yes,\" they replied. \"And bouquets of white flowers,\" added Lucilla.  \"Oh, papa, you will let me act as one of the bridesmaids, will you not?\" asked Grace, turning to him.  \"I have no objection,\" he replied. \"You may both serve, since Rosie wishes it and I see you are pleased with the idea. As for the matter of dress you may settle that for yourselves.\"  \"Oh, thank you, sir!\" both exclaimed joyously, Grace adding, \"But won't you please tell us, papa, just how much we may spend?\"  \"Any amount which your mamma and Grandma Elsie do not consider too great,\" he replied in an indulgent tone. \"However, I think I should not hesitate to leave that matter to the judgment of my daughters themselves; for I know that neither of you is inclined to be at all extravagant.\"  \"No, indeed,\" said Violet, \"they are always very careful to make sure that papa is able to afford them what they want.\"  \"It would be strange if we weren't, Mamma Vi,\" said Lucilla with a happy laugh, \"for we know that papa loves us so dearly that he would go without things himself any time rather than deny us anything desirable.\"  \"And I expect to put him to the additional expense of dressing Elsie handsomely for the occasion,\" laughed Rosie.  \"Ah! is she also to be a bridesmaid?\" asked the captain with a smiling glance at his little girl, who was turning her bright eyes from one to another with a surprised, pleased, yet puzzled look.  \"Not just that,\" replied Rosie; then went on to explain her plan for giving the two little Elsies a part in the ceremony.  \"Should you like to do that, daughter?\" asked the captain, taking the hand of the little girl and drawing her to his side.  \"I'm 'most afraid I would not know how to do it right, papa,\" she answered with doubtful look and tone.  \"You can take lessons beforehand,\" he said; \"but you shall do just as you please about it.\"  \"And the question need not be decided at once,\" remarked Grandma Elsie. \"We will let the matter rest till we learn what your cousin Elsie Dinsmore thinks about joining you in it.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rosie, \"and fortunately we do not need to settle anything more to-day. Maud and Sydney must be consulted before we quite decide on the colour and material of the bridesmaids' dresses.\"     CHAPTER V.   A pause in the conversation upon the veranda was broken by an exclamation from little Ned. \"Cousin Arthur is coming!\" he cried as a carriage turned in at the great gates and came swiftly up the driveway.  \"Yes,\" said his father, stepping forward to meet and welcome Dr. Conly, \"always a visitor we are delighted to see, whether we are sick or well. Good-morning, sir! We are all glad to see you as friend and guest, though fortunately not in need of your professional services at present. I hope the demands of other patients are not so pressing that we may not keep you here till after dinner.\"  \"Thank you, but I can stay for only a hasty call,\" replied the doctor, alighting and shaking hands with one after another as they crowded about him.  \"You look like the bringer of good news, cousin,\" said Grandma Elsie, regarding him with a pleased smile.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"I feel myself a very fortunate and happy man to-day, and have come to tell my news and ask the sympathy and congratulations of you my relatives and friends. My Marian and I have a son--a fine healthy babe, now some hours old--mother and child are doing as well as possible.\"  The congratulations were poured forth without stint. Then Mr. Dinsmore asked, \"What do you propose to call the lad?\"  \"Ronald. It is Marian's choice and I am well content, for it is a good name, and I highly esteem the dear old cousin who has showed such kindness to the mother.\"  \"Yes, he is worthy of it,\" said Grandma Elsie. \"I have always felt proud to own him as my kinsman.\"  \"And Ronald and Conly go well together, making a very pretty name, to my thinking,\" said Rosie.  \"Have they heard the news at Beechwood yet?\" asked Lucilla.  \"I think not,\" replied the doctor; \"but I shall take it in my way home, as it will make the drive only a little longer and I need delay there but a moment.\" Then with a hasty adieu he took his departure.  \"Art is a very happy man to-day,\" Mr. Dinsmore remarked with a pleased smile, as they watched the doctor's gig on its way down the drive.  \"Yes; I know of no one more worthy of happiness, and it does me good to see it,\" said the captain.  \"And no doubt dear"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17496"],["title","Elsie at Home (#5)"],["body","arian's heart is overflowing with love and gratitude,\" said Grandma Elsie in low, soft tones. \"I quite want to see her and her new treasure.\"  \"Both she and Art will be very proud to show it to their friends and relatives,\" remarked Violet with a smile, \"though he will be careful not to admit even relatives for some days yet. He is very kind and careful as both husband and physician.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rosie; \"he will take excellent care of Marian and have her well in time to attend the wedding, I hope.\"  \"I think we can manage that, daughter, as we have not fixed upon the day,\" her mother said with playful look and tone.  \"Oh, yes, mamma! and I do intend it to be at least six weeks before I leave girlhood for married life,\" returned Rosie, laughing and blushing as she spoke.  \"It is too serious a step to be taken hastily, my dear young sister,\" remarked the captain in a tone between jest and earnest; \"a step that once taken cannot be retraced--a venture involving the happiness or misery of perhaps a lifetime; certainly the lifetime of one if not of both.\"  \"Oh, you frighten me!\" cried Rosie, drawing a long breath and lifting her hands with a gesture of alarm and despair; \"what shall I do? Would you recommend single blessedness--you who have twice tried laying hold of the other horn of the dilemma?\"  \"Only for a time,\" he said. \"Look well before you leap, as I did, and then you will be in little danger of wanting to leap back again.\"  \"You don't? you never do?\" she queried in mock surprise and doubt.  \"Never!\" he said with a smiling, admiring glance into Violet's beautiful eyes, watching him with not a shade of doubt or distrust in their azure depths; \"never for a moment have I been conscious of the slightest inclination to do so.\"  \"Thank you, my dear,\" Violet said. \"And, Rosie, let me tell you for your encouragement that I have known no more regret than has he. I am very sure that if it were in our power to reconsider, the question would be decided exactly as it was years ago.\"  \"I believe it,\" responded Rosie heartily, \"and that Will and I will be able to say the same when we too have lived together for years. He is good as gold, I know, and I shall try to be worthy of him.\"  The call to dinner here put an end to the conversation and the talk at the table was upon other themes.  Shortly after the conclusion of the meal Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore returned to Ion, while the others, some on horseback, the rest in the family carriage, went over to the Oaks to call upon the relatives there and consult with them on the arrangements for the wedding, particularly the dress of the bride and her attendants--a subject of great interest to the ladies, especially such to the young girls, but one which the two gentlemen--Captain Raymond and young Mr. Dinsmore--were so entirely willing to leave to their decision that they presently excused themselves and walked out into the grounds, Mr. Dinsmore wishing to consult the captain in regard to some improvements that he had in contemplation.  Then Rosie announced her errand and gave her invitation to Maud and Sydney. It was accepted promptly and with evident pleasure by both. Then Rosie went on to speak of her idea of having the two little Elsies act as flower girls.  \"My niece and my cousin, and both bearing mamma's name; about the same size, too; would it not be pretty?\" she asked, and received a chorus of approving replies.  \"Oh, I'd like to!\" cried Elsie Dinsmore, clapping her hands in delight. \"It's ever so good in you, Cousin Rosie, to choose us! and I suppose we will be dressed alike, won't we?\"  \"That is my idea,\" said Rosie, \"and I presume your mothers will not withhold their consent.\"  \"Oh, you will let us, mamma--you and Cousin Vi--won't you?\" cried the child, turning to them.  \"I am entirely willing, if that suits Cousin Vi and her Elsie,\" replied her mother.  \"As it will, I am sure,\" said Violet.  \"Yes, mamma,\" said her Elsie, \"I shall like it, for I am sure you and the other ladies will choose a pretty dress for us.\"  \"Probably no prettier than some that you already own,\" Violet returned with an amused look. \"Try not to think or care too much for dress, daughter; there are so many things which are much more important.\"  \"But it isn't wrong to like to be tastefully dressed, is it, mamma?\" asked the little girl with a slightly troubled look.  \"No, I think not, dear,\" returned her mother with a loving smile into the inquiring eyes; \"if it were wrong to love pretty things, surely God would not have made so many for our eyes to look upon--the beautiful flowers and fruits, the sunset clouds, the stars, to mention only a few--but he--our kind Heavenly Father--loves to give us enjoyment.\"  \"And I do enjoy all the pretty things very much indeed, mamma,\" responded the little girl with a look of relief and pleasure, \"and I'm glad it isn't wrong; I like to see pretty clothes on you and my sisters quite as much as on myself. And don't you think papa likes to have us all nicely dressed?\"  \"I am sure he does; and you may feel very certain that papa approves of nothing but what is right.\"  \"Those are exactly mine and my husband's sentiments upon the subject in question,\" remarked Mrs. Dinsmore in a lively tone. \"But now let us hear what those girls are talking about.\"  \"You will be married in church?\" Maud was saying inquiringly.  \"No,\" said Rosie in a tone of decision; \"I mean to follow the good example of my mother and older sisters in having a home wedding.\"  \"And you will want ushers? I was just going to ask who were to serve in that capacity.\"  \"I believe Mr. Croly has engaged my brothers Harold and Herbert, who are his most intimate friends,\" replied Rosie; \"but of course there will be plenty of time for all those arrangements.\"  \"I dare say he will ask Uncle Harold to be best man,\" said Grace.  \"Very likely,\" said Rosie, \"and Herbert, Chester, and Frank for ushers. We may as well make it a family affair,\" she added with a satisfied little laugh.  \"And if either you or Will conclude that you would prefer a larger number it will be an easy matter to think of, and invite them to serve a little later,\" remarked Violet.  \"Yes, there is plenty of time,\" said their mother, smiling lovingly into Rosie's bright eyes. \"I am in no hurry to give my youngest daughter to even so entirely a good, worthy, and amiable young man as William Croly.\"  \"Please do not look at it in that way, mother dear. Please remember that you are not to lose your daughter, but to gain another good son.\"  \"That is right, Rosie; I do believe it is going to prove a gain all round,\" said Violet.  \"Why, of course it is,\" said Maud; \"that is settled; so now let us consider and decide the important question what colours we are to wear on the grand occasion. Lu, you wore canary colour at Betty Norris' wedding; suppose I take that this time and you wear pink; it will become you quite as well, I think.\"  \"I suppose so,\" said Lucilla, \"and am perfectly willing to wear it.\"  \"And pink beside my white will look very pretty,\" said Rosie. \"Lu is to be maid of honor, you know, girls.\"  \"Yes; and I for one highly approve your choice, Rosie,\" said Evelyn with an affectionate, admiring look at Lucilla.  \"Yes; and suppose we dress your little flower girls in pink, also,\" suggested Mrs. Dinsmore.  That idea seemed to suit everybody.  \"I like that colour,\" remarked Elsie Dinsmore sagely, \"but I shall be particular about having very handsome material.\"  \"It shall be handsome enough to accord well with the others,\" said her mother with an amused laugh.  \"I think straw colour becomes me,\" remarked Maud; \"so that is what I shall wear, if the rest of the party approve.\"  \"And blue will be the thing for Gracie and me,\" said Sydney. \"What do you say to that, Gracie?\"  \"I am satisfied if Rosie and the rest approve,\" was Grace's pleasant-toned reply.  \"So that is settled,\" said Sydney. \"Wouldn't it be well for us all to go into the city to-morrow, see what we can find there to suit us, and order other things sent for?\"  \"What do you say to that, mamma?\" asked Rosie.  \"I see no objection to it,\" replied Grandma Elsie. \"But we will consult the captain in regard to that matter,\" she added, as at that moment he and her brother came in.  \"Ah! upon what is my valuable opinion desired, mother?\" he asked in playful tones; then, in response to the explanation given, said that he thought it a very good plan, as it would surely do no harm to begin needed preparations promptly.  \"Then, papa, won't you excuse Gracie and me from lessons for the next few days?\" asked Lucilla.  \"I will; you may consider the remainder of the week a holiday,\" he replied.  \"For Ned and me too, papa?\" asked Elsie.  \"Yes; if you think you can assist in the shopping.\"  \"I should like to help choose my own things if you and mamma are willing,\" she said with a persuasive look from one to the other.  \"I think you will be allowed a voice in the selection,\" he replied, patting her cheek as she leaned upon his knee, looking up affectionately and pleadingly into his face.  \"Yes,\" said Violet, \"and I am sure we shall be able to find dress goods and whatever else is needed, that will suit all three of us.\"  \"And it will be four days' holiday we'll have,\" remarked Ned with satisfaction.  \"You are planning to have your wedding a good deal after the pattern of Cousin Betty's, Rosie,\" remarked Mrs. Dinsmore.  \"Yes; in some respects, for I thought it a very pretty wedding; but that ceremony took place in the church, while I mean to be married at home; also there will probably be a difference in the number of attendants and their dress,\" replied Rosie. \"And by the way, mamma,\" she added, turning to her mother, \"we must send Betty an invitation in good season for her to arrange matters so that she can come to my wedding. I was one of her bridesmaids, you remember, and should be sorry indeed to neglect her at this time.\"  \"She shall not be forgotten, daughter,\" was Grandma Elsie's ready response; \"we"]]]
