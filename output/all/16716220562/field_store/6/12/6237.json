Perhaps I shall see him if I go there.\"  [Illustration: \"This must be the house where the prince will stop,\" thought Barbara.]  So she went to the cathedral. Many folk were there in their richest apparel, and the organ rolled out its grand music, and the people sang wondrous songs, and the priests made eloquent prayers; and the music, and the songs, and the prayers were all about the prince and his expected coming. The throng that swept in and out of the great edifice talked always of the prince, the prince, the prince, until Barbara really loved him very much, for all the gentle words she heard the people say of him.  \"Please, can I go and sit inside?\" inquired Barbara of the sexton.  \"No!\" said the sexton gruffly, for this was an important occasion with the sexton, and he had no idea of wasting words on a beggar child.  \"But I will be very good and quiet,\" pleaded Barbara. \"Please may I not see the prince?\"  \"I have said no, and I mean it,\" retorted the sexton. \"What have you for the prince, or what cares the prince for you? Out with you, and don't be blocking up the door-way!\" So the sexton gave Barbara an angry push, and the child fell half-way down the icy steps of the cathedral. She began to cry. Some great people were entering the cathedral at the time, and they laughed to see her falling.  \"Have you seen the prince?\" inquired a snowflake, alighting on Barbara's cheek. It was the same little snowflake that had clung to her shawl an hour ago, when the wind came galloping along on his boisterous search.  \"Ah, no!\" sighed Barbara in tears; \"but what cares the prince for _me_?\"  \"Do not speak so bitterly,\" said the little snowflake. \"Go to the forest and you shall see him, for the prince always comes through the forest to the city.\"  Despite the cold, and her bruises, and her tears, Barbara smiled. In the forest she could behold the prince coming on his way; and he would not see her, for she would hide among the trees and vines.  \"Whirr-r-r, whirr-r-r!\" It was the mischievous, romping wind once more; and it fluttered Barbara's tattered shawl, and set her hair to streaming in every direction, and swept the snowflake from her cheek and sent it spinning through the air.  Barbara trudged toward the forest. When she came to the city gate the watchman stopped her, and held his big lantern in her face, and asked her who she was and where she was going.  \"I am Barbara, and I am going into the forest,\" said she boldly.  \"Into the forest?\" cried the watchman, \"and in this storm? No, child; you will perish!\"  \"But I am going to see the prince,\" said Barbara. \"They will not let me watch for him in the church, nor in any of their pleasant homes, so I am going into the forest.\"  The watchman smiled sadly. He was a kindly man; he thought of his own little girl at home.  \"No, you must not go to the forest,\" said he, \"for you would perish with the cold.\"  But Barbara would not stay. She avoided the watchman's grasp and ran as fast as ever she could through the city gate.  \"Come back, come back!\" cried the watchman; \"you will perish in the forest!\"  But Barbara would not heed his cry. The falling snow did not stay her, nor did the cutting blast. She thought only of the prince, and she ran straightway to the forest.   II  \"What do you see up there, O pine-tree?\" asked a little vine in the forest. \"You lift your head among the clouds to-night, and you tremble strangely as if you saw wondrous sights.\"  \"I see only the distant hill-tops and the dark clouds,\" answered the pine-tree. \"And the wind sings of the snow-king to-night; to all my questionings he says, 'Snow, snow, snow,' till I am wearied with his refrain.\"  \"But the prince will surely come to-morrow?\" inquired the tiny snowdrop that nestled close to the vine.  \"Oh, yes,\" said the vine. \"I heard the country folks talking about it as they went through the forest to-day, and they said that the prince would surely come on the morrow.\"  \"What are you little folks down there talking about?\" asked the pine-tree.  \"We are talking about the prince,\" said the vine.  \"Yes, he is to come on the morrow,\" said the pine-tree, \"but not until the day dawns, and it is still all dark in the east.\"  \"Yes,\" said the fir-tree, \"the east is black, and only the wind and the snow issue from it.\"  \"Keep your head out of my way!\" cried the pine-tree to the fir; \"with your constant bobbing around I can hardly see at all.\"  \"Take _that_ for your bad manners,\" retorted the fir, slapping the pine-tree savagely with one of her longest branches.  The pine-tree would put up with no such treatment, so he hurled his largest cone at the fir; and for a moment or two it looked as if there were going to be a serious commotion in the forest.  \"Hush!\" cried the vine in a startled tone; \"there is some one coming through the forest.\"  The pine-tree and the fir stopped quarrelling, and the snowdrop nestled closer to the vine, while the vine hugged the pine-tree very tightly. All were greatly alarmed.  \"Nonsense!\" said the pine-tree, in a tone of assumed bravery. \"No one would venture into the forest at such an hour.\"  \"Indeed! and why not?\" cried a child's voice. \"Will you not let me watch with you for the coming of the prince?\"  \"Will you not chop me down?\" inquired the pine-tree gruffly.  \"Will you not tear me from my tree?\" asked the vine.  \"Will you not pluck my blossoms?\" plaintively piped the snowdrop.  \"No, of course not,\" said Barbara; \"I have come only to watch with you for the prince.\"  Then Barbara told them who she was, and how cruelly she had been treated in the city, and how she longed to see the prince, who was to come on the morrow. And as she talked, the forest and all therein felt a great compassion for her.  \"Lie at my feet,\" said the pine-tree, \"and I will protect you.\"  \"Nestle close to me, and I will chafe your temples and body and limbs till they are warm,\" said the vine.  \"Let me rest upon your cheek, and I will sing you my little songs,\" said the snowdrop.  And Barbara felt very grateful for all these homely kindnesses. She rested in the velvety snow at the foot of the pine-tree, and the vine chafed her body and limbs, and the little flower sang sweet songs to her.  \"Whirr-r-r, whirr-r-r!\" There was that noisy wind again, but this time it was gentler than it had been in the city.  \"Here you are, my little Barbara,\" said the wind, in kindly tones. \"I have brought you the little snowflake. I am glad you came away from the city, for the people are proud and haughty there; oh, but I will have my fun with them!\"  Then, having dropped the little snowflake on Barbara's cheek, the wind whisked off to the city again. And we can imagine that it played rare pranks with the proud, haughty folk on its return; for the wind, as you know, is no respecter of persons.  \"Dear Barbara,\" said the snowflake, \"I will watch with thee for the coming of the prince.\"  And Barbara was glad, for she loved the little snowflake, that was so pure and innocent and gentle.  \"Tell us, O pine-tree,\" cried the vine, \"what do you see in the east? Has the prince yet entered the forest?\"  \"The east is full of black clouds,\" said the pine-tree, \"and the winds that hurry to the hill-tops sing of the snow.\"  \"But the city is full of brightness,\" said the fir. \"I can see the lights in the cathedral, and I can hear wondrous music about the prince and his coming.\"  \"Yes, they are singing of the prince in the cathedral,\" said Barbara sadly.  \"But we shall see him first,\" whispered the vine reassuringly.  \"Yes, the prince will come through the forest,\" said the little snowdrop gleefully.  \"Fear not, dear Barbara, we shall behold the prince in all his glory,\" cried the snowflake.  Then all at once there was a strange hub-bub in the forest; for it was midnight, and the spirits came from their hiding-places to prowl about and to disport themselves. Barbara beheld them all in great wonder and trepidation, for she had never before seen the spirits of the forest, although she had often heard of them. It was a marvellous sight.  [Illustration: So Barbara fell asleep.]  \"Fear nothing,\" whispered the vine to Barbara,--\"fear nothing, for they dare not touch you.\"  The antics of the wood-spirits continued but an hour; for then a cock crowed, and immediately thereat, with a wondrous scurrying, the elves and the gnomes and the other grotesque spirits sought their abiding-places in the caves and in the hollow trunks and under the loose bark of the trees. And then it was very quiet once more in the forest.  \"It is very cold,\" said Barbara. \"My hands and feet are like ice.\"  Then the pine-tree and the fir shook down the snow from their broad boughs, and the snow fell upon Barbara and covered her like a white mantle.  \"You will be warm now,\" said the vine, kissing Barbara's forehead. And Barbara smiled.  Then the snowdrop sang a lullaby about the moss that loved the violet. And Barbara said, \"I am going to sleep; will you wake me when the prince comes through the forest?\"  And they said they would. So Barbara fell asleep.   III  \"The bells in the city are ringing merrily,\" said the fir, \"and the music in the cathedral is louder and more beautiful than before. Can it be that the prince has already come into the city?\"  \"No,\" cried the pine-tree, \"look to the east and see the Christmas day a-dawning! The prince is coming, and his pathway is through the forest!\"  The storm had ceased. Snow lay upon all the earth. The hills, the forest, the city, and the meadows were white with the robe the storm-k"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17630"],["title","Christmas Tales and Christmas Verse (#5)"],["body","had thrown over them. Content with his wondrous work, the storm-king himself had fled to his far Northern home before the dawn of the Christmas day. Everything was bright and sparkling and beautiful. And most beautiful was the great hymn of praise the forest sang that Christmas morning,--the pine-trees and the firs and the vines and the snow-flowers that sang of the prince and of his promised coming.  \"Wake up, little one,\" cried the vine, \"for the prince is coming!\"  But Barbara slept; she did not hear the vine's soft calling nor the lofty music of the forest.  A little snow-bird flew down from the fir-tree's bough and perched upon the vine, and carolled in Barbara's ear of the Christmas morning and of the coming of the prince. But Barbara slept; she did not hear the carol of the bird.  \"Alas!\" sighed the vine, \"Barbara will not awaken, and the prince is coming.\"  Then the vine and the snowdrop wept, and the pine-tree and the fir were very sad.  The prince came through the forest clad in royal raiment and wearing a golden crown. Angels came with him, and the forest sang a great hymn unto the prince, such a hymn as had never before been heard on earth. The prince came to the sleeping child and smiled upon her and called her by name.  \"Barbara, my little one,\" said the prince, \"awaken, and come with me.\"  Then Barbara opened her eyes and beheld the prince. And it seemed as if a new life had come to her, for there was warmth in her body and a flush upon her cheeks and a light in her eyes that were divine. And she was clothed no longer in rags, but in white flowing raiment; and upon the soft brown hair there was a crown like those which angels wear. And as Barbara arose and went to the prince, the little snowflake fell from her cheek upon her bosom, and forthwith became a pearl more precious than all other jewels upon earth.  And the prince took Barbara in his arms and blessed her, and turning round about, returned with the little child unto his home, while the forest and the sky and the angels sang a wondrous song.  The city waited for the prince, but he did not come. None knew of the glory of the forest that Christmas morning, nor of the new life that came to little Barbara.  _Come thou, dear Prince, oh, come to us this holy Christmas time! Come to the busy marts of earth, the quiet homes, the noisy streets, the humble lanes; come to us all, and with thy love touch every human heart, that we may know that love, and in its blessed peace bear charity to all mankind!_     CHRYSTMASSE OF OLDE       God rest you, Chrysten gentil men,       Wherever you may be,--     God rest you all in fielde or hall,       Or on ye stormy sea;     For on this morn oure Chryst is born       That saveth you and me.      Last night ye shepherds in ye east       Saw many a wondrous thing;     Ye sky last night flamed passing bright       Whiles that ye stars did sing,     And angels came to bless ye name       Of Jesus Chryst, oure Kyng.      God rest you, Chrysten gentil men,       Faring where'er you may;     In noblesse court do thou no sport,       In tournament no playe,     In paynim lands hold thou thy hands       From bloudy works this daye.      But thinking on ye gentil Lord       That died upon ye tree,     Let troublings cease and deeds of peace       Abound in Chrystantie;     For on this morn ye Chryst is born       That saveth you and me.     THE MOUSE AND THE MOONBEAM   Whilst you were sleeping, little Dear-my-Soul, strange things happened; but that I saw and heard them, I should never have believed them. The clock stood, of course, in the corner, a moonbeam floated idly on the floor, and a little mauve mouse came from the hole in the chimney corner and frisked and scampered in the light of the moonbeam upon the floor. The little mauve mouse was particularly merry; sometimes she danced upon two legs and sometimes upon four legs, but always very daintily and always very merrily.  \"Ah, me!\" sighed the old clock, \"how different mice are nowadays from the mice we used to have in the good old times! Now there was your grandma, Mistress Velvetpaw, and there was your grandpa, Master Sniffwhisker,--how grave and dignified they were! Many a night have I seen them dancing upon the carpet below me, but always the stately minuet and never that crazy frisking which you are executing now, to my surprise--yes, and to my horror, too.\"  \"But why shouldn't I be merry?\" asked the little mauve mouse. \"To-morrow is Christmas, and this is Christmas eve.\"  \"So it is,\" said the old clock. \"I had really forgotten all about it. But tell me, what is Christmas to you, little Miss Mauve Mouse?\"  \"A great deal to me!\" cried the little mauve mouse. \"I have been very good a very long time: I have not used any bad words, nor have I gnawed any holes, nor have I stolen any canary seed, nor have I worried my mother by running behind the flour-barrel where that horrid trap is set. In fact, I have been so good that I'm very sure Santa Claus will bring me something very pretty.\"  This seemed to amuse the old clock mightily; in fact, the old clock fell to laughing so heartily that in an unguarded moment she struck twelve instead of ten, which was exceedingly careless and therefore to be reprehended.  \"Why, you silly little mauve mouse,\" said the old clock, \"you don't believe in Santa Claus, do you?\"  \"Of course I do,\" answered the little mauve mouse. \"Believe in Santa Claus? Why shouldn't I? Didn't Santa Claus bring me a beautiful butter-cracker last Christmas, and a lovely gingersnap, and a delicious rind of cheese, and--and--lots of things? I should be very ungrateful if I did not believe in Santa Claus, and I certainly shall not disbelieve in him at the very moment when I am expecting him to arrive with a bundle of goodies for me.  [Illustration: \"But why shouldn't I be merry?\" asked the little mauve mouse. \"To-morrow is Christmas, and this is Christmas eve.\"]  \"I once had a little sister,\" continued the little mauve mouse, \"who did not believe in Santa Claus, and the very thought of the fate that befell her makes my blood run cold and my whiskers stand on end. She died before I was born, but my mother has told me all about her. Perhaps you never saw her; her name was Squeaknibble, and she was in stature one of those long, low, rangy mice that are seldom found in well-stocked pantries. Mother says that Squeaknibble took after our ancestors who came from New England, where the malignant ingenuity of the people and the ferocity of the cats rendered life precarious indeed. Squeaknibble seemed to inherit many ancestral traits, the most conspicuous of which was a disposition to sneer at some of the most respected dogmas in mousedom. From her very infancy she doubted, for example, the widely accepted theory that the moon was composed of green cheese; and this heresy was the first intimation her parents had of the sceptical turn of her mind. Of course, her parents were vastly annoyed, for their maturer natures saw that this youthful scepticism portended serious, if not fatal, consequences. Yet all in vain did the sagacious couple reason and plead with their headstrong and heretical child.  \"For a long time Squeaknibble would not believe that there was any such archfiend as a cat; but she came to be convinced to the contrary one memorable night, on which occasion she lost two inches of her beautiful tail, and received so terrible a fright that for fully an hour afterward her little heart beat so violently as to lift her off her feet and bump her head against the top of our domestic hole. The cat that deprived my sister of so large a percentage of her vertebral colophon was the same brindled ogress that nowadays steals ever and anon into this room, crouches treacherously behind the sofa, and feigns to be asleep, hoping, forsooth, that some of us, heedless of her hated presence, will venture within reach of her diabolical claws. So enraged was this ferocious monster at the escape of my sister that she ground her fangs viciously together, and vowed to take no pleasure in life until she held in her devouring jaws the innocent little mouse which belonged to the mangled bit of tail she even then clutched in her remorseless claws.\"  \"Yes,\" said the old clock, \"now that you recall the incident, I recollect it well. I was here then, in this very corner, and I remember that I laughed at the cat and chided her for her awkwardness. My reproaches irritated her; she told me that a clock's duty was to run itself down, _not_ to be depreciating the merits of others! Yes, I recall the time; that cat's tongue is fully as sharp as her claws.\"  \"Be that as it may,\" said the little mauve mouse, \"it is a matter of history, and therefore beyond dispute, that from that very moment the cat pined for Squeaknibble's life; it seemed as if that one little two-inch taste of Squeaknibble's tail had filled the cat with a consuming passion, or appetite, for the rest of Squeaknibble. So the cat waited and watched and hunted and schemed and devised and did everything possible for a cat--a cruel cat--to do in order to gain her murderous ends. One night--one fatal Christmas eve--our mother had undressed the children for bed, and was urging upon them to go to sleep earlier than usual, since she fully expected that Santa Claus would bring each of them something very palatable and nice before morning. Thereupon the little dears whisked their cunning tails, pricked up their beautiful ears, and began telling one another what they hoped Santa Claus would bring. One asked for a slice of Roquefort, another for Neufchatel, another for Sap Sago, and a fourth for Edam; one expressed a preference for de Brie, while another hoped to get Parmesan; one clamored for imperial blue Stilton, and another craved the fragrant boon of Caprera. There were fourteen little ones then, and consequently there were diverse opinions as to the kind of gift which Santa Claus should best bring; still, there was, as you can"]]]
