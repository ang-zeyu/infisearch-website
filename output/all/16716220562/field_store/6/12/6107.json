I believe he is in the house--probably up in his wife's room--though I have not seen him since breakfast.\"  \"Yes, he is there, sharing with Marian a call from my mother.\"  \"Ah! that is nice for Marian; she has been wanting to see Cousin Elsie badly. I want a call from her too, and hope she will not forget me when through with my sister-in-law.\"  \"Hardly, I think; it is not mother's way to forget anyone; especially so near and dear a relative as yourself, Cousin Mary. But don't set your heart on a long call this morning, for some other folks want the doctor if you don't.\"  \"Ah! and your mother has taken up the practice of medicine, has she?\"  \"Well, I don't say that exactly, but certainly her advice and suggestions are sometimes more beneficial to the patient than those of her doctor son; then think of the enviable condition of the patient who can have both,\" returned Harold laughingly. \"Ah, here comes Cousin Cal!\" as a horseman came galloping up the avenue.  \"Good-morning, Harold!\" Calhoun said, as he alighted, giving his steed in charge to a servant, and came up the veranda steps. \"I have been out in the field for some hours, overseeing the work of my men, saw you passing a few moments since with your mother, and could not resist the temptation to leave them and come in for a bit of chat with her and yourself.\"  \"Especially with me, of course,\" laughed Harold as the two shook hands and Calhoun, seating himself near his wife, took the babe, which was stretching out its arms to him with a cooing invitation not to be resisted by the doting father.  \"Mother's particular errand this morning was a call upon Marian; she is paying it now, and I presume will be down in the course of ten or fifteen minutes,\" added Harold.  \"You will both stay to dinner, won't you?\" queried Calhoun hospitably. \"We'd be delighted to have you do so.\"  \"That we would,\" added his wife heartily.  \"Thank you,\" returned Harold, \"but I have some rather urgent calls to make and hope to get mother to accompany me. I know of no one else who can say such comforting things to the sick and depressed.\"  \"Nor do I,\" responded Mrs. Conly. \"If I am in the least depressed, a call from her, or a chat with her, always raises my spirits; she can always show you a silver lining to the cloud, however dark it may be.\"  \"Yes,\" said Harold, \"her faith in the goodness and love of God is so strong and unwavering, and she realizes so perfectly that life in this world is short and fleeting, that which follows unending and full of bliss to all who believe in the Lord Jesus, that she is ever content with whatever Providence sends her. I never knew a happier Christian.\"  \"Nor I,\" said Mary. \"I only wish we were all more like her in that respect.\"  \"Yes,\" said Calhoun, \"and I believe we are every one of us the happier and better for knowing her. I have been thinking that it will be hard for Rosie to leave such a mother.\"  \"That it will,\" sighed Harold; \"and hard for mother, and all of us indeed, to part with Rosie. But of course the members of so large a family as ours cannot expect to remain together all through life.\"  \"Yes; weddings are apt to bring both joy and sorrow,\" remarked Mrs. Conly reflectively; \"the forming of new ties and the breaking of old ones. One cannot altogether forget the old loves, however sweet the new may be; but when we get to the better land we may hope to have them all,\" she added with an appreciative glance at her husband. \"Ah, how delightful that will be!\"  There was a moment's silence; then Harold said, \"The wedding day having not been fixed yet the invitations have not been sent out, but I know mother is hoping to see your parents here at that time, Cousin Mary.\"  \"That is kind,\" she returned with a pleased smile; \"I supposed they would be invited, and that so I should have the better prospect of getting a long promised visit from them myself. But if you invite all the relatives you will have a great many guests to entertain--that is should all, or nearly all, accept. However, it is more than likely that by far the larger number will feel constrained to content themselves with sending regrets, congratulations, and gifts.\"  \"I hope,\" said Harold quickly and earnestly, \"I am sure we all do--that no one will feel called upon for that last. I trust that will be fully understood. The parents of both bride and groom being abundantly able to provide everything necessary or desirable, why should distant relatives and friends assist in it, perhaps at the cost of embarrassment or self-denial?\"  \"But you should not deny the privilege to those who are abundantly able and would feel it a pleasure,\" returned Mary with playful look and tone; \"which I am sure is the case with some of the relatives,\" she added.  \"No,\" said Harold, \"I should not deny it, but would have a distinct understanding that it was not expected or desired, at the cost of hardship or self-denial to the giver, or his or her nearer and dearer ones.\"  At that moment his mother stepped from the doorway into the veranda. Very warmly affectionate greetings were exchanged, she was quickly installed in an easy-chair, and some moments were spent in lively chat.  \"Do take off your bonnet, Cousin Elsie, and stay and dine with us,\" urged Calhoun hospitably. \"Our young doctor here insists that he cannot; but let him go on and visit the patients he thinks need his services, and call here again for you; unless you will allow me the pleasure of seeing you safely home later in the day.\"  \"Thank you, Cal,\" she said in reply, \"but Rosie will be looking out for her mother--as I promised her I would not be gone very long--and I want to see some of my boy's patients myself, and to make a little call at Beechwood. You know they are all relatives there, and Annis and I very old and dear friends.\"  \"Yes; and it is growing late,\" said Harold, consulting his watch; \"so, whenever you are ready, mother, we will start.\"  \"I am that now,\" she answered, rising with the words. \"Good-bye, Cousin Mary. Come over to Ion whenever you can make it convenient. And when you write home be as urgent as possible in your entreaties that your parents will come to the wedding and be prepared to remain in the neighbourhood for a long visit after it is over.\"  \"You may rest assured that I will do my very best to bring them here and for as long a stay as possible,\" was Mary's smiling and earnest reply.  \"And never doubt, cousin, that I will do my best to second her efforts,\" said Calhoun, handing her into the carriage as he spoke.  \"Will there be time for a call at Beechwood, Harold?\" she asked as they drove down the avenue.  \"Oh, yes, mother! I think so,\" he replied. \"I have but two calls to make on the way, and it is not likely either need be very long.\"  \"I would not have anyone neglected for my convenience,\" she remarked in a cheery tone, \"but should be glad to spend a half hour with Annis if I can do so without loss or inconvenience to anyone else.\"  \"Always thoughtful for others, mother dear,\" Harold said, giving her a most affectionate look and smile. \"I think you may trust me not to neglect my patients.\"  \"I hope so, indeed,\" she responded; \"and that you will never be less careful and considerate of the poor than of the rich.\"  Fortunately they found all doing so well that no lengthened call was necessary, and they reached Beechwood in season to allow quite a long chat between the lady cousins before it would be time for Mrs. Travilla and her son to set out on their return to Ion.  They found Mr. Lilburn and Annis seated upon the front veranda, she with a bit of needlework in her hands, he reading aloud to her. He closed his book as the carriage drove up, and laying it aside, hastened to assist his Cousin Elsie to alight, greeting her with warmth of affection as he did so. Annis dropped her work and hastened to meet and embrace her, saying:  \"Oh, but I am glad to see you, Elsie! I had letters this morning from Mildred and Zilla, both bringing a great deal of love to you and a cordial invitation to you and yours--as well as my husband and myself--to pay them a visit this summer. They have not yet heard of Rosie's approaching marriage, I find.\"  \"But must hear of it very soon,\" Elsie said with a smile. \"As soon as the important day is fixed upon I must send out my invitations; and you may rest assured that none of our relatives will be forgotten or neglected; certainly not one of your sisters or brothers.\"  \"No, my dear cousin, it would not be at all like you to neglect any of them,\" returned Annis with a smile of loving appreciation. \"Ah, Harold!\" turning to him as, having secured his horse, he came up the veranda steps and joined their little group, \"I am glad to see you; especially as, like a dear, good boy, you have brought your mother along.\"  \"Yes,\" he said, grasping cordially the hand she held out, \"I find I am sure of a welcome anywhere when I am fortunate enough to induce mother to accompany me. Sick or well, everybody is glad to see her.\"  \"You also, I presume; especially if they are sick.\"  \"And can't get Cousin Arthur,\" he added. \"A young doctor is better than none; though an old and tried physician is deemed the best--by sensible people.\"  \"Ah, ha; ah, ha; um, hm! so it would seem, laddie, yet sometimes the young fellows hae a new trick the auld hardly ken aboot,\" remarked Cousin Ronald with a good-humoured smile. \"And for my ain sel' I should care little--were I ill--whether it were Doctor Arthur or Doctor Harold that prescribed the remedies to be used.\"  \"Or Doctor Herbert; Herbert might do just as well as either of the two, I presume,\" added Annis.  \"We have just come from a call at Roselands to see Marian and your little namesake, Cousin Ronald,\" said Mrs. Travilla. \"He is a dear little fellow, and I hope will grow up in a way to do honour to the name.\"  \"I hope he may, and to be a great comfort and blessing to the parents who have "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/175"],["title","The Phantom of the Opera (#0)"],["body","footnotes have been incrementally numbered in [ ] marks, and placed after the paragraph in which they appear          The Phantom of the Opera   by  Gaston Leroux    Author of \"The Mystery of the Yellow Room\" and \"The Perfume of the Lady in Black\"     Contents   Chapter          PROLOGUE      I  IS IT A GHOST?

He was not, as was long believed, a creature of the imagination of the artists, the superstition of the managers, or a product of the absurd and impressionable brains of the young ladies of the ballet, their mothers, the box-keepers, the cloak-room attendants or the concierge.  Yes, he existed in flesh and blood, although he assumed the complete appearance of a real phantom; that is to say, of a spectral shade.  When I began to ransack the archives of the National Academy of Music I was at once struck by the surprising coincidences between the phenomena ascribed to the \"ghost\" and the most extraordinary and fantastic tragedy that ever excited the Paris upper classes; and I soon conceived the idea that this tragedy might reasonably be explained by the phenomena in question.  The events do not date more than thirty years back; and it would not be difficult to find at the present day, in the foyer of the ballet, old men of the highest respectability, men upon whose word one could absolutely rely, who would remember as though they happened yesterday the mysterious and dramatic conditions that attended the kidnapping of Christine Daae, the disappearance of the Vicomte de Chagny and the death of his elder brother, Count Philippe, whose body was found on the bank of the lake that exists in the lower cellars of the Opera on the Rue-Scribe side.  But none of those witnesses had until that day thought that there was any reason for connecting the more or less legendary figure of the Opera ghost with that terrible story.  The truth was slow to enter my mind, puzzled by an inquiry that at every moment was complicated by events which, at first sight, might be looked upon as superhuman; and more than once I was within an ace of abandoning a task in which I was exhausting myself in the hopeless pursuit of a vain image.  At last, I received the proof that my presentiments had not deceived me, and I was rewarded for all my efforts on the day when I acquired the certainty that the Opera ghost was more than a mere shade.  On that day, I had spent long hours over THE MEMOIRS OF A MANAGER, the light and frivolous work of the too-skeptical Moncharmin, who, during his term at the Opera, understood nothing of the mysterious behavior of the ghost and who was making all the fun of it that he could at the very moment when he became the first victim of the curious financial operation that went on inside the \"magic envelope.\"  I had just left the library in despair, when I met the delightful acting-manager of our National Academy, who stood chatting on a landing with a lively and well-groomed little old man, to whom he introduced me gaily.  The acting-manager knew all about my investigations and how eagerly and unsuccessfully I had been trying to discover the whereabouts of the examining magistrate in the famous Chagny case, M. Faure.  Nobody knew what had become of him, alive or dead; and here he was back from Canada, where he had spent fifteen years, and the first thing he had done, on his return to Paris, was to come to the secretarial offices at the Opera and ask for a free seat.  The little old man was M. Faure himself.  We spent a good part of the evening together and he told me the whole Chagny case as he had understood it at the time.  He was bound to conclude in favor of the madness of the viscount and the accidental death of the elder brother, for lack of evidence to the contrary; but he was nevertheless persuaded that a terrible tragedy had taken place between the two brothers in connection with Christine Daae.  He could not tell me what became of Christine or the viscount.  When I mentioned the ghost, he only laughed.  He, too, had been told of the curious manifestations that seemed to point to the existence of an abnormal being, residing in one of the most mysterious corners of the Opera, and he knew the story of the envelope; but he had never seen anything in it worthy of his attention as magistrate in charge of the Chagny case, and it was as much as he had done to listen to the evidence of a witness who appeared of his own accord and declared that he had often met the ghost.  This witness was none other than the man whom all Paris called the \"Persian\" and who was well-known to every subscriber to the Opera. The magistrate took him for a visionary.  I was immensely interested by this story of the Persian.  I wanted, if there were still time, to find this valuable and eccentric witness.  My luck began to improve and I discovered him in his little flat in the Rue de Rivoli, where he had lived ever since and where he died five months after my visit.  I was at first inclined to be suspicious; but when the Persian had told me, with child-like candor, all that he knew about the ghost and had handed me the proofs of the ghost's existence--including the strange correspondence of Christine Daae--to do as I pleased with, I was no longer able to doubt.  No, the ghost was not a myth!  I have, I know, been told that this correspondence may have been forged from first to last by a man whose imagination had certainly been fed on the most seductive tales; but fortunately I discovered some of Christine's writing outside the famous bundle of letters and, on a comparison between the two, all my doubts were removed.  I also went into the past history of the Persian and found that he was an upright man, incapable of inventing a story that might have defeated the ends of justice.  This, moreover, was the opinion of the more serious people who, at one time or other, were mixed up in the Chagny case, who were friends of the Chagny family, to whom I showed all my documents and set forth all my inferences.  In this connection, I should like to print a few lines which I received from General D----:  SIR:  I can not urge you too strongly to publish the results of your inquiry. I remember perfectly that, a few weeks before the disappearance of that great singer, Christine Daae, and the tragedy which threw the whole of the Faubourg Saint-Germain into mourning, there was a great deal of talk, in the foyer of the ballet, on the subject of the \"ghost;\" and I believe that it only ceased to be discussed in consequence of the later affair that excited us all so greatly.  But, if it be possible--as, after hearing you, I believe--to explain the tragedy through the ghost, then I beg you sir, to talk to us about the ghost again.  Mysterious though the ghost may at first appear, he will always be more easily explained than the dismal story in which malevolent people have tried to picture two brothers killing each other who had worshiped each other all their lives.  Believe me, etc.  Lastly, with my bundle of papers in hand, I once more went over the ghost's vast domain, the huge building which he had made his kingdom. All that my eyes saw, all that my mind perceived, corroborated the Persian's documents precisely; and a wonderful discovery crowned my labors in a very definite fashion.  It will be remembered that, later, when digging in the substructure of the Opera, before burying the phonographic records of the artist's voice, the workmen laid bare a corpse.  Well, I was at once able to prove that this corpse was that of the Opera ghost.  I made the acting-manager put this proof to the test with his own hand; and it is now a matter of supreme indifference to me if the papers pretend that the body was that of a victim of the Commune.  The wretches who were massacred, under the Commune, in the cellars of the Opera, were not buried on this side; I will tell where their skeletons can be found in a spot not very far from that immense crypt which was stocked during the siege with all sorts of provisions.  I came upon this track just when I was looking for the remains of the Opera ghost, which I should never have discovered but for the unheard-of chance described above.  But we will return to the corpse and what ought to be done with it. For the present, I must conclude this very necessary introduction by thanking M. Mifroid (who was the commissary of police called in for the first investigations after the disappearance of Christine Daae), M. Remy, the late secretary, M. Mercier, the late acting-manager, M. Gabriel, the late chorus-master, and more particularly Mme. la Baronne de Castelot-Barbezac, who was once the \"little Meg\" of the story (and who is not ashamed of it), the most charming star of our admirable corps de ballet, the eldest daughter of the worthy Mme. Giry, now deceased, who had charge of the ghost's private box.  All these were of the greatest assistance "]]]
