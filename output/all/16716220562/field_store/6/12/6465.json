Cross hatching indicates area of overlapping of the two forms. The range of _Dipodomys deserti_, not shown on the map, is west of that of _spectabilis_, and so far as known the two do not overlap.]  _Dipodomys spectabilis spectabilis_ Merriam requires comparison with three other forms of kangaroo rats in the same general region, namely, _D. deserti_ Stephens, of approximately the same size, and _D. merriami_ Mearns and _D. ordii_ Woodhouse, the last two of decidedly smaller size. The range of _deserti_ lies principally to the west of that of _spectabilis_, and the two do not, so far as known, overlap. On the other hand, _merriami_ and _ordii_, and subspecies, occur over a large part of the range of _spectabilis_, living in very close proximity to its burrows; _merriami_ is even suspected of pillaging the stores of _spectabilis_. The range of _merriami_, however, is much more extensive than that of _spectabilis_ (Fig. 1), which argues against a definite ecological dependence or relationship. Separation of the four forms mentioned may be easily accomplished by the following key:  _Key to Species of_ Dipodomys _in Arizona._  _a^1_. Size much larger (hind foot and greatest length of skull more than 42 millimeters); tail tipped with white.       _b^1_. Upper parts dark brownish buffy; tail dark brownish or      blackish with more sharply contrasted white tip; interparietal      broader, distinctly separating mastoids (range in Arizona mainly      southeastern part)                          =Dipodomys spectabilis.=       _b^2_. Upper parts light ochraceous-buffy; tail pale brownish with      less sharply contrasted white tip; interparietal narrower, reduced      to mere spicule between mastoids (range in Arizona mainly      southwestern part)                              =Dipodomys deserti.=  _a^2_. Size much smaller (hind foot and greatest length of skull less than 42 millimeters); tail not tipped with white.       _b^1_. Hind foot with four toes                =Dipodomys merriami.=       _b^2_. Hind foot with five toes                   =Dipodomys ordii.=  On account of the small size, _merriami_ and _ordii_ do not require detailed color comparison with the other two. The general color of the upperparts of _spectabilis_ is much darker than that of _deserti_; whereas _spectabilis_ is ochraceous-buff or light ochraceous-buff grizzled with blackish, _deserti_ is near pale ochraceous-buff and lacks the blackish.  The color of the upperparts alone amply suffices to distinguish _spectabilis_ and _deserti_; but the different coloration of the tail is the most obvious diagnostic feature. The near black of the middle portion of the tail, the conspicuous white side stripes, and the pure white tip make the tail of _spectabilis_ stand in rather vivid contrast to the pale-brown and whitish tail of _deserti_.  The dens of the two larger species of _Dipodomys_--_spectabilis_ and _deserti_--can be distinguished at a glance from those of the two smaller--_merriami_ and _ordii_--by the fact that the mounds of the former are usually of considerable size and the burrow mouths are of greater diameter. On the Range Reserve _merriami_ erects no mounds, but excavates its burrows in the open or at the base of _Prosopis_, _Lycium_, or other brush. The mounds of _spectabilis_ are higher than those of _deserti_, the entrances are larger, and they are located in harder soil (Pl. III, Fig. 1). The dens of _deserti_ are usually more extensive in surface area than those of _spectabilis_, and have a greater number of openings (Pl. III, Fig. 2).   [Illustration: PLATE II.

Size large; ears moderate, ear from crown (taken in dry skin) 9 or 10 millimeters; eyes prominent; whiskers long and sensitive; fore feet short and weak; hind feet long and powerful, provided with four well-developed toes; tail very long, usually 30 to 40 per cent longer than the body. Cranium triangular, the occiput forming the base and the point of the nose the apex of the triangle, much flattened, auditory and particularly mastoid bullae conspicuously inflated.   COLOR.  General color above, brownish buffy, varying in some specimens to lighter buffy tints, grizzled with black; oblique hip stripes white; tail with dark-brown or blackish stripes above and below, running into blackish about halfway between base and tip, and with two lateral side stripes of white to a point about halfway back; tail tipped with pure white for about 40 millimeters (Pl. I). Underparts white, hairs white to bases, with some plumbeous and buffy hairs about base of tail; fore legs and fore feet white all around; hind legs like back, brown above, hairs with gray bases, becoming blackish (fuscous-black or chætura-black) about ankles, hairs on under side white to bases; hind feet white above, dark-brown or blackish (near fuscous) below.  Color variations in a series of 12 specimens from the type locality and points widely scattered through the range of _spectabilis_ consist in minor modifications of the degree of coloration, length of white tip of tail, and length of white lateral tail stripes. In general the color pattern and characters are remarkably uniform. Young specimens, while exhibiting the color pattern and general color of adults, are conspicuously less brown, and more grayish.  There appears to be little variation in color with season. In the series at hand, most specimens taken during the fall, winter, and spring are very slightly browner than those of summer, suggesting that the fresh pelage following the fall molt is a little brighter than is the pelage after being worn all winter and into the following summer. But at most the difference is slight.   OIL GLAND.  Upon separating the hairs of the middle region of the back about a third of the distance between the ears and the rump, one uncovers a prominent gland, elliptical in outline, with long axis longitudinal and about 9 millimeters in length. The gland presents a roughened and granular appearance, and fewer hairs grow upon it than elsewhere on the back. The hairs in the vicinity are frequently matted, as if with a secretion. In worn stage of pelage the gland may be visible from above without separating the hairs. Bailey has suggested that this functions as an oil gland for dressing the fur, and our observations bear out this view. Kangaroo rats kept in captivity without earth or sand soon come to have a bedraggled appearance, as if the pelage were moist. When supplied with fine, dusty sand, they soon recover their normal sleek appearance. Apparently the former condition is due to an excess of oil, the latter to the absorption of the excess in a dust bath. The oil is doubtless an important adjunct to the preservation of the skin and hair amid the dusty surroundings in which the animal lives.   MEASUREMENTS AND WEIGHTS.  External measurements include: _Total length_, from tip of nose to tip of tail without hairs, measured before skinning; _tail vertebræ_, length of tail from point in angle when tail is bent at right angles to body to tip of tail without hairs; and _hind foot_, from heel to tip of longest claw.  The following are measurements of a series from the U. S. Range Reserve:       [Transcriber note: Next line was corrected per erratum. The      original text was of the following paragraph (_Averages for 17      adult females: Total length, 326.4 millimeters_).]  Average measurements of 30 adult specimens of both sexes: Total length, 326.2 millimeters (349-310); tail vertebræ, 188.4 (208-180); hind foot, 49.5 (51-47); the average weight of 29 adult specimens of both sexes was 114.5 grams (131.9-98.0).  Averages for 17 adult females: Total length, 326.4 millimeters (349-310); tail vertebræ, 188.8 (208-179); weight (16 individuals), 113.7 (131.9-98.0); excluding pregnant females, 13 individuals averaged 112.9 grams (131.9-98.0).  Averages for 13 adult males: Total length, 326 millimeters (345-311); tail vertebræ, 187.8 (202-168); weight, 116.8 grams (129-100).  There appears to be no significant difference in the measurements and weights of males and females, with the possible exception of the comparison of adult males and adult nonpregnant females.     OCCURRENCE.   GENERAL DISTRIBUTION.  _Dipodomys spectabilis spectabilis_ is found in southeastern Arizona, in northwestern,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17966"],["title","Life History of the Kangaroo Rat (#2)"],["body","l, and southern New Mexico, in extreme western Texas, in northern Sonora, and in northern and central Chihuahua (Fig. 1). A subspecies, _D. s. cratodon_ Merriam, has been described from Chicalote, Aguas Calientes, Mexico, the geographic range of which lies in central Mexico in portions of the States of Zacatecas, San Luis Potosi, and Aguas Calientes.   HABITAT.  In the Tucson region _spectabilis_ is typically a resident of the Lower Sonoran Zone. This is perhaps the principal zone inhabited over its entire range, but the animal is often found in the Upper Sonoran also, and in the Gallina Mountains of New Mexico Hollister found it invading the yellow pine Transition where the soil was dry and sandy and the pine woods of open character. The same observer found it common in grassy and weed-grown parks among the large junipers, pinyons, and scattering yellow pines of the Bear Spring Mountains, N. Mex. Bailey calls attention to the fact that the animal apparently does not inhabit the lower half of the Lower Sonoran Zone, as it extends neither into the Rio Grande Valley of Texas nor the Gila Valley of Arizona. In extreme western Texas it is common at the upper edge of the arid Lower Sonoran Zone, and in this region does not enter the Upper Sonoran to any extent.  In July, 1914, Goldman found this kangaroo rat common on the plain at 4,600 feet altitude, near Bonita, Graham County, Ariz., and noted a few as high as 5,000 feet altitude on the warm southwestern slopes of the Graham Mountains, near Fort Grant. Apparently _spectabilis_ reaches its upper altitude limit in the Burro Mountains, N. Mex., where Bailey has found it sparingly on warm slopes up to 5,700 feet, and at the western base of the Sandia Mountains, east of Albuquerque, N. Mex., where dens occur at approximately 6,000 feet.  About Tucson it is undoubtedly more common in the somewhat higher portions of the Lower Sonoran Zone, above the _Covillea_ association, than elsewhere (Pl. IV, Figs. 1 and 2). A few scattered dens are to be seen in the _Covillea_ belt, but as one rises to altitudes of 3,500 to 4,000 feet, and the _Covillea_ is replaced by the cat's-claws (_Acacia_ sp. and _Mimosa_ sp.) and scattered mesquite (_Prosopis_), with the _Opuntia_ becoming less abundant, kangaroo rat mounds come more and more in evidence. Here is to be found the principal grass growth supporting the grazing industry, and the presence of a more luxuriant grass flora is probably an important factor in the greater abundance of kangaroo rats, both _spectabilis_ and _merriami_. In this generally preferred environment the desert hackberry (_Celtis pallida_) is one of the most conspicuous shrubs; clumps of this species are commonly accompanied by kangaroo rat mounds.  In order to ascertain whether the banner-tailed kangaroo rat has any marked preference for building its mounds under _Celtis_ or some other particular plant, all the observable mounds were counted in a strip about 20 rods wide and approximately 4 miles long, an area of approximately 160 acres, particular note being taken of the kind of shrub under which each mound was located. Of 300 mounds in this area, 96 were under _Prosopis_, 95 under _Acacia_, 65 under _Celtis_, 11 under _Lycium_, 31 in the open, 1 about a \"cholla\" cactus (_Opuntia spinosior_), and 1 about a prickly pear (_Opuntia_ sp.). There is apparently no strongly marked preference for any single species of plant. While both desert hackberry and the cat's-claws afford a better protection than mesquite--since cattle more often seek shade under the latter, and in so doing frequently trample the mounds severely--it appears that the general protection of a tree or shrub of some sort is sought by kangaroo rats, rather than the specific protection of the thickest or thorniest species.  The following records indicate particular habitat preferences of _spectabilis_ as noted at different points in its range:       Occurs on open bare knolls exposed to winds, also on gravelly      places at lower edge of foothills (Franklin Mountains, Tex., Gaut);      here and there over the barest and hardest of the gravelly mesas      (Bailey, Tex., 1905, 147); on open creosote-bush and giant-cactus      desert (Tucson, Ariz., Vorhies and Taylor); on firm, gravelly, or      even rocky soil on the grassy bajada land along the northwest base      of the mountains, either in the open or under _Celtis_, _Prosopis_,      _Lycium_, _Acacia greggii_, or other brush (Santa Rita Mountains,      Ariz., Vorhies and Taylor); mounds usually thrown up around a bunch      of cactus or mesquite brush (Magdalena, Sonora, Bailey); in heavy      soil (Ajo, Ariz., A. B. Howell); loamy soil (Gunsight, Ariz., A. B.      Howell); in mesa where not too stony (Magdalena, Sonora, Bailey);      grassy plain (Gallego, Chihuahua, Nelson); in open valley and high      open plains (Santa Rosa, N. Mex., Bailey); in grassy and weed-grown      parks among the larger junipers, pinyons, and scattering yellow      pines (Bear Spring Mountains, N. Mex., Hollister); on sand-dune      strip (east side of Pecos River, 15 miles northeast of Roswell, N.      Mex., Bailey); among _Ephedra_ patches (San Juan Valley, N. Mex.,      Birdseye); in open sandy soil along dry wash (Rio Alamosa, N. Mex.,      Goldman); on sides and crests of bare, stony hills (Mesa Jumanes,      N. Mex., Gaut); in open, arid part of the valley and stony mesas      (Carlsbad and Pecos Valley, N. Mex., Bailey); about the edges of      the plains of San Augustine and the foothills of the Datil and      Gallina Mountains, and in the Transition Zone yellow-pine forest of      the Gallina Mountains (Datil region, N. Mex., Hollister); on hard      limy ridges (Monahans, Tex., Cary).  A. Brazier Howell notes that _spectabilis_ occurs in harder soil than does _deserti_. This observation is confirmed by others, and seems to afford a conspicuous habitat difference between the two, for _deserti_ is typically an animal of the shifting aeolian sands.  Usually, as on the Range Reserve, the rodents are widely distributed over a considerable area. Occasionally, as in the vicinity of Rio Alamosa, N. Mex., as reported by Goldman, they occur only in small colonies.   [Illustration: PLATE IV. FIG. 1.--RANGE CONDITIONS FAVORING KANGAROO RATS.

FIG. 2.--RANGE CONDITIONS LESS FAVORABLE TO KANGAROO RATS.  View on lower portion of Range Reserve, where _Dipodomys s. spectabilis_ is less abundant. Vegetation consists principally of _Lycium_, mesquite, rabbit brush, and cactus, there being very little grass.]     HABITS.   EVIDENCE OF PRESENCE.   MOUNDS.  One traveling over territory thickly occupied by the banner-tailed kangaroo rat is certain to note the numerous and conspicuous mounds so characteristic of the species, particularly if the region is of the savannah type, grassy rather than brushy. These low, rounded mounds occupy an area of several feet in diameter, and rise to varying heights above the general surface of the surrounding soil, the height depending rather more upon the character of the soil and the location of the mound as to exposure or protection than upon the area occupied by the burrow system which lies within and is the reason for the mound.  A den in sandy soil in the open may be of maximum size in area occupied and yet scarcely present the appearance of a mound in any sense, due probably both to the fact that the sandy soil will not heap up to such a height over a honeycomb of tunnels as will a firmer or rocky soil, and also to its greater exposure to the leveling action of rains and the trampling of animals. These mounds are in themselves large enough to attract some attention, but their conspicuousness is enhanced by the fact that they are more or less completely denuded of vegetation and are the centers of cleared areas often as much as 30 feet in diameter (Pl. V, Fig. 1); and further that from 3 to 12 large dark openings loom up in every mound. The larger openings are of such size as to suggest the presence of a much larger animal than actually inhabits the mound. Add to the above the fact that the traveler by day never sees the mound builder, and we have the chief reasons why curiosity is so often aroused by these habitations.  On the Range Reserve the mounds are usually rendered conspicuous by the absence of small vegetation, but Nelson writes that in the vicinity of Gallego, Chihuahua, they can be readily distinguished at a distance because of a growth of weeds and small bushes over their summits, which overtop the grass. In the vicinity of Albuquerque, N. Mex., Bailey reports (and this was recently confirmed by Vorhies) that the mounds about the holes of _spectabilis_ are often hardly noticeable. Hollister writes that in the yellow-pine forests of the Gallina Mountains the burrows are usually under the trunk of some fallen pine, both sides of it in some cases being taken up with holes, there being some eight or ten entrances along each side, the burrows extending into the ground beneath the log. In the vicinity of Blanco, N. Mex., Birdseye says that occasionally _spectabilis_ makes typical dens but more often lives in old prairie-dog holes (_Cynomys_), or in holes which look more like those of _D. ordii_.   RUNWAYS AND TRACKS.  Still other features add to the interest in the dwelling places of _spectabilis_. Radiating in various directions from some of the openings of the mounds well-used runways are to be seen, some of them fading out in the surrounding vegetation, but others extending 30, 40, or even 50 or more yards to neighboring burrows or mounds (Pl. V, Fig. 2; Pl. VI, Fig. 1). These runways and the entrances to the mounds are well worn, showing that the inhabitants are at home"]]]
