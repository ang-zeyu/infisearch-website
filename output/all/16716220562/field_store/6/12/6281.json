William's socialism is all of the same brand.  His first display of affection for the tyrant lower down was due to the fact that he used him to overthrow a tyrant higher up: it was the socialist voter who broke the power of Bismarck.  When we see William embarking upon so many schemes of social reform all at once, we may be sure that he has no serious intention of carrying out any one of them.  After having made all sorts of lavish promises to the industrial workers, he is now busy giving undertakings to make the welfare of the peasantry his special care!  In his speech to the Reichstag there is no mention even of the one definite benefit that the workers had a right to expect--namely, a reduction of the hours of labour; but the threat of shooting \"them in the back\" reappears in a new guise.  William II warns the working classes of \"the dangers which they will incur in the event of their doing anything to disturb the order of government.\"  \"My august confederates and I,\" adds the Emperor, \"are determined to defend this order with unshakable energy.\"  Delicious to my way of thinking, this expression \"my august confederates.\"  Is there not something astounding about the use of the possessive pronoun in connection with the word \"august,\" implying sovereignty?  One wonders what part can they have to play, these confederates, led and dominated by a personality as jealous and self-centred as this \"young Emperor.\"  There is only one thing about which William II really concerns himself, over and above his blind passion for increasing the forces of Germany, and that is, other people's morals--the morals of working men or officers.  The devil has always had his days for playing the monk.    May 20, 1890. [5]  Do my readers remember my last article but one, written at a moment when the whole Press was singing the praises of William the Pacifist, on the eve of the day when _The Times_ published its despatch, proclaiming the complete agreement between Tzar and Kaiser, the _entente_ that assures the world of the peace that shall come down from William's starry heavens?  It was then that I wrote--  \"Is there a single reason to be found, either in the traditions of his race, or in his own character, or in the logic of Prussian militarism, which can justify, any clear-thinking mind in believing that William is a Pacifist?\"  Hardly had that number of May 1 appeared when the German Emperor made his speech at Königsberg!  In his cups, the King of Prussia reveals his true nature, just as a champagne cork flies from a badly wired bottle. After giving expression once again to his animosity towards France, he borrows from us one of the famous dicta of Monsieur Prudhomme--  \"The duty of an Emperor,\" he declared, \"is to keep the peace, and I am determined to do it; but should I be compelled to draw the sword to preserve peace, Germany's blows will fall like hail upon those who have dared to disturb it.\"  Next, in the neighbourhood of the Russian frontier, he used the following provocative language: \"I will not permit that any one should touch my eastern provinces and he who tries to do so, will find that my power and my might are as rocks of bronze.\"  Sire, beware!  The God of the Hohenzollern will prove to you before long that your power and your might, those rocks of bronze, are no more in His hands than a feather tossed in the wind; He will show you that a tricky horse can unseat you, regardless of your dignity, when you take your favourite ride, the road to Peacock island, with your august brother-in-law.  Say what you will, the Prussians have not yet acquired either wit or good taste!  There is proof of this not only in the speeches of William II at Konigsberg, but even more convincing, in that which was delivered before the Reichstag by that famous strategist, our conqueror de Moltke, on the subject of the proposed increase in the peace-footing effectives.  One must read the whole speech to get an idea of the sort of nonsense that \"honorable\" Germans are prepared to listen to.  In urging the vote of credit, \"the Victor\" said: \"Confronted with the fundamental problem of the army, the question of money is of secondary importance; for what becomes of your prosperous finances in war-time?\"  Having proved that conquerors are the greatest benefactors of the human race, M. de Moltke goes on to declare that it is not the rulers, but the peoples, who want war to-day.  In Germany, it is \"the cupidity of the classes whom fate has neglected\"; it is also the socialists who decline to vote more soldiers because they desire to trouble the world's peace and expect \"to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of lives in the next war and to threaten the existence of morality and civilisation.\"  I do not know whether my readers can make head or tail of this speech--I certainly cannot--but its intention is plain enough.  William II has been careful to emphasise it, by declaring that the increase in the peace strength of the army is intended to reinforce the eastern and western frontiers.  Several officious newspapers (we no longer call them reptile, but to do so would make them more authoritative) sum up the matter in these words--  \"The nearer the peace-footing of the troops on our frontiers approaches to war-strength, the more effectively these troops are provided with everything necessary to enable them to leave within _three hours_ of receiving marching orders, the more secure becomes Germany's position.\"  Quite so!  By next October there will be 200,000 men in Alsace-Lorraine.  As you see, the new law adds to the security of Germany precisely what it takes from ours.    June 12, 1890. [6]  My readers will recollect that after a journey in Switzerland, two years ago, I proved by statements which could not be (and never were) refuted, that the Russian Nihilists established in Switzerland before the Federal Government's inquiry, were all either deliberate or unconscious tools of the German police.  On the one hand, M. de Puttkamer, Minister of the Interior, unable to refute the evidence brought forward by the socialist deputy, Bebel, had then been compelled to confess that the socialist agitators Haupt and Schneider were his agents in Switzerland.  On the other hand, at the inquiry into the proceedings of these socialists, there was the evidence furnished by letters seized on Schmidt and Friedmann, associates of Haupt and Schneider, that Schmidt had been commissioned by M. Krüger of the Berlin Police to commit a crime.  In one of the seized letters, the following words were actually used by Krüger: \"The next attempt upon the life of the Emperor Alexander must be prepared at Geneva.  Write to me; I await your reports.\" [7]  Whenever the alleged liberalism of William II finds its expression in anything else but speeches, it is easy to take its measure.  He has just shown once more what it really amounts to, in the Treaty of Establishment with Switzerland, wherein restrictions are placed upon the issue of good moral character certificates by German parishes to their parishioners.  These will no longer be available to enable a German to take up his residence in Switzerland.  Henceforward it will be the business of the German Legation to pick and choose those whom it considers eligible to reside in Switzerland, either to practise a profession or to conduct an export business there.  It will be for Germany to decide whether or not her subjects are dangerous abroad. This would be well enough if it were only a question of restraining rogues, but it is anything but reassuring when we come to deal with the ever advancing phalanx of German spies.    July 9, 1890. [8]  It seems to me that this Wagnerian Emperor, pursuing his legends to the uttermost parts of the earth, is doing his utmost to darken our horizon.  Everywhere, always he confronts us, appearing on the scene to deprive us of the last remnants of good-will left to us in Europe.  In the Scandinavian States, even after 1870, we had preserved certain trusty friendships: of these William II now tries to rob us.  He appears and, to use his own expression, draws men to him by magic strings.  To the people who are offshoots of Germany he figures as \"the Emperor,\" unique, mysterious, he who goes forward in the name of the fables of mythology, gathering and uniting anew in his slumbering people the instincts of vassalage.  \"Super-German virtues,\" he calls them, \"ornaments of old-time Germany.\"  This monarch who, in his own land, is pleased to pose as a Liberal!  Can it be that this same William who, on the Bosphorus held communion with the stars, who, writing to Bismarck, said, \"I talk with God,\" finds the celestial responses so inadequate that his mind must needs invoke a retinue of Teutonic deities?  \"Let the Latins, Slavs and Gauls know it,\" says he, \"the German Emperor bears to Germans the glad tidings which promise them the sovereignty of the world!\"  Have not even the Anglo-Saxons bowed before the sovereign will of William II, so that before long the island of Heligoland will see the German flag floating over its rocky shores?  Yes, let her Press and public men say what they will, proud Albion has delivered herself over to Germany.  She has made surrender to our enemy in the hope that we shall thus become for her an easier victim, that she will be able to recover at our expense what Germany has taken from her.  Lord Salisbury hopes, in return for the plum he has yielded, to be able to help himself to ours, to those of Italy and Portugal, and to share others with Germany.  But such is the character of William II that he despises those who serve him or who yield to his will.  Like Don Juan, he seeks ever new worlds to conquer, new resistances to overcome, and neglects no means to secure his desired ends.  England and Austria to-day count for less than nothing in his schemes.  These "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17737"],["title","The Schemes of the Kaiser (#3)"],["body","have had a free hand in Bulgaria, and they have used it to indulge in every sort of intrigue. Screened by Bismarck, they have advised, upheld and exalted Stamboulof, they have set up the Prince of Coburg.  And William, not having inspired any of this policy, would like to see it end in complications shameful for his associates.  As to the King of Sweden, he thinks it due to the dignity of his people to make some show of resistance, but one feels that this is only done to save appearances.  He also has delivered himself, bound hand and foot, just as they have all done, the Emperor Francis Joseph, the King of Italy, the Hohenzollern who reigns at Bucharest, Stamboulof, Lord Salisbury and Leopold II.    July 29, 1890. [9]  The Imperial bagman travelling in Germanophil wares conceals under his flag a very mixed cargo.  He makes a Bernadotte to serve as speaking trumpet for Prussian Conservatism at the same time that he subsidises _agents provocateurs_ for the purpose of misleading and internationalising the social reform programme of the Danes.  And all the time, in every direction, he comes and goes--this ever restless, universal disturber--creating and perpetuating instability on all sides, so as to increase the price of his peace stock, he controlling the market.  It is Bismarck's old game, played with up-to-date methods.    August 12, 1890. [10]  Does it not seem to you, dear reader, that the voyage of William II to Russia suggests in more ways than one the scene of the Temptation on the Mount?  At St. Petersburg there reigns a sovereign whose life, directed by the inspirations of his soul, is one long act of virtuous self-denial; who prefers the humble and the lowly to fortune's favourites; whose works are works of peace, and whose intentions are always those of a man ready to appear before Him Who only tolerates the great ones of this earth when their power is balanced by a due sense of their moral responsibility, by devotion to duty and truth.  At Berlin there reigns a man of ungovernable pride, who aspires to be torch-bearer to the world.  Restless, like the spirit of evil, tormented by his inability to do good, he has dedicated his soul to wickedness and lies.  Alexander III regarded his accession to the throne as an ordeal, the sacrifice of his life.  He would have given his own blood to spare his father the pangs of death.  William II seized fiercely on the reins of power, after having committed a crime, at least in his heart; after having wished for the death of his father and increased his sufferings by his conduct.  By the tragic end of two martyrs, God has brought face to face those who are destined to be the champions of good and of evil respectively in these last years of the century.  The German Emperor goes to Russia to say to the Tzar, \"Divide with me the kingdoms of the earth, always on condition that I receive the lion's share.\"  The Emperor of Russia will reply: \"Let us endeavour, my brother, to work for the welfare of the nations, let us calm their hatreds and follow the rugged paths of justice; above all, let us regard the power which the God of hosts has confided into our hands as an instrument of sovereignty, whose only purpose should be to keep the nation's honour unsullied and safeguard the blessings of peace.\"  \"Words, nothing but words,\" replies the Tempter.  \"Say, Yes or No, wilt thou go with me to the conquest of the world?  On all sides your influence, which I have undermined, is waning: you and your followers are caught in a ring of iron from which before long you will be unable to escape.  \"In Germany, all things are subject to my unfettered rule.  Henceforth nothing can ever check or stop my triumphal march.  Throughout the humbly listening world, which will soon be at my feet, I break that which will not bend before me.  I overthrow all those that stand, and that which comes to me, I keep.  Even the Church, which treated with my forefathers on a footing of equality, now bows the knee before me and humbly votes the money for my great slaughters.  \"Socialism, that bogey of Bismarck's, is an easily tamed monster.  I have only to sow discord amongst its leaders to make it serve my ends of policy like the veriest National Liberal party.  \"In Austria, my grandfather and I created financial troubles, entangled things, let loose envy and hatred and sowed the seeds of quarrels, which have delivered her into my hands.  Let them try as they will to free themselves from the fetters with which I have bound them; I shall create such obstacles to all these efforts that the future shall be mine, like the present.  \"In Hungary, Prussian diplomacy has found a way to turn the people's hatred of Austria into hatred of Russia, and to make them forgive the House of Hapsburg for a policy of coercion so cruel than even a Romanoff denounced it.  \"Everywhere I create dissension amongst my allies so that the final decision may be mine.  \"In Italy I have my _âme damnée_, the only one who understands me, an ambitious tyrant, mad like Bismarck with the lust of power, who serves my purposes at Rome as effectively as Bismarck hampered them in Berlin.  \"I have stifled and destroyed the spirit of brotherhood in the cradle of the Latin race.  I have made history a liar, bringing a false morality to the interpretation of the most brilliant days and deeds.  I have reduced to servility a Royal House that once was proud.  I have cheated and deceived the cleverest and most suspicious race on earth.  \"At Rome, I have insulted the traditional and sacred majesty of the Head of the Christian religion!  \"In England, I have done even more.  I have compelled proud Albion to serve the ends of my personal policy.  I have forced the most jealous of nations to yield the leading place to me, to work, in her own colonies and against her own interests, for the benefit of my growing rivalry, sacrificing to me her dreams of supremacy in the four quarters of the globe.  \"As to America, I will deal with her later.  I have my plans.  \"Despite Lord Salisbury's make-believe of caution and reserve (about which, I may say, we quite understand each other) England is so completely delivered into my power that, after the Conservatives the Liberals, in the person of the young leader John Morley, now proffer me their services, and no matter what changes may take place in the English parties my influence will soon prevail.  \"My journeys to the Scandinavian States have been fruitful.  In Denmark, O Tzar! your own father-in-law has become almost associated with my destiny.  \"I have linked with my fortunes a king of French stock in Sweden, and I will prove it at Alsen Island, where I shall compel him to take part in the manoeuvres of my fleet.  \"As to Norway, a few words from my Imperial lips have overcome the old republicanism of these brother Teutons.  \"So as to keep closer watch over the submission of my new allies, I have wrested Heligoland from England; and there I shall build an eagle's nest from which I shall be able to swoop down upon them, should they attempt to escape me.  Those who had any doubts as to the importance of this surrender, have learned it from the speeches that I made when taking possession.  \"By this means I have closed the German Ocean _for ever_, and that which is closed gives access to something.  \"What need I say of Turkey that you do not know already?  All her thoughts, movements and actions are regulated by one man, and he a vassal of German policy.  Turkey's army, trade and finances, the direction of her ruling minds, are either in my hands or in those of England.  And England, say what you will, is hypnotised by me.  \"I can afford at my pleasure to challenge her policy indefinitely.  \"The diplomas which she conferred upon the Bulgarian bishops after the execution at Panitza have shown you, my brother, how greatly I am pleased to favour those whom you have condemned!  Stamboulof, the inveterate foe of Russia, now dominates the elections in Bulgaria and Roumelia, thanks to the iradé on the bishoprics.  He goes in triumph through the land, so that even the Russophile candidates invoke the protection of this man, who shoots the country's heroes and reduces its prince to the level of an ordinary public servant.  His audacity, his impunity, the length of his tether, have no limits except those which will be imposed upon him by my power should you turn a deaf ear to my proposals.  \"And just as British policy has served the ends of Prussian statecraft in Bulgaria and Roumelia, even so it serves them at this moment in Armenia.  \"It was I who willed and inspired the indulgence of the Sultan for the bloodthirsty Moussa Bey.  Massacred by the Kurds on the one hand, and on the other observing the success of the revolution in Roumelia, the Armenians will inevitably be led from one revolt to another and, helped by a few timely suggestions, will come to believe that they can win their autonomy.  \"Herein lies another difficulty which disturbs your mind, and of which my hands hold the threads; another people, to whom you might have looked for help in the event of my allies going to war with you, but which England and I will be able to remove from your influence.  \"In Roumania, a Hohenzollern guards all the keys which open the doors of his frontiers.  \"In Serbia, I am working by sure means to destroy the last remaining sympathies for Russia.  To attain this end I will leave no stone unturned, even as I am doing in Greece against France.  \"With an eye to the future interests of my African colonies, I have compelled England to keep Portugal quiet.  I do not wish any revolutionary upheaval to react upon Spain, that indomitable nation which still resists me, but in whose mouth nevertheless, I have put an invisible bit.  I shall know how to drive her headlong into the trap that awaits her in Morocco.  \"With the help of Italy, Switzerland is mine.  And Holland will fall to me through the little Duchy of Luxembourg, which will"]]]
