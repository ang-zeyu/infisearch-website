We don't know anybody in this big town.\"  As he spoke, he began to edge away from the wall, the girl following.  \"Wait!\" smiled the detective. \"You are getting out of place. You were looking at the armor when you first heard the hubbub over there?\"  Both were silent.  \"What were you looking at?\"  \"I was looking at her, and her was looking at me,\" stammered the man. \"We were--were talking together here--we didn't notice----\"  \"Just married, eh?\"  \"Yesterday noon, sir. How--how did you know?\"  \"I didn't know; I only guessed. And I think I can guess something else--what your reason was for stealing into this dark corner.\"  It was the man who now looked down, and the woman who looked up. In a pinch of this kind, it is the woman who is the more courageous.  \"He was a-kissin' of me, sir,\" she whispered in a frank but shamefaced way. \"There was no harm in that, was there? We're so fond of one another, and how could we know that anyone was dying so near?\"  \"No, there was no harm,\" Mr. Gryce reluctantly admitted. Caught in an absurdity amusing enough in its way, he would certainly under less strenuous circumstances have rather enjoyed his own humiliation. But the occasion was too serious and his part in it too pronounced for him to take any pleasure in this misadventure. In the prosecution of so daring a scheme for locating witnesses if not of discovering the actual user of the bow, it would not do to fail. He _must_ find the man he sought. If the Curator--but one glance into the room where that gentleman stood amid a litter of prints satisfied him that Sweetwater was right as to the impossibility of getting any information from this quarter. Nor could he hope, remembering what he had himself seen, that he would succeed any better with the last person now remaining on this floor--the young man busy with the coins in No. I.  That he was to be so fortunate as to lay an immediate hand on the person who had shot the fatal arrow was no longer regarded by him as among the possibilities. Whoever this person was, he had found a way of escape which rendered him for the time being safe from discovery. But there was another possible miscalculation which he felt it his duty to recognize before he proceeded further in his difficult task. The bow found back of the tapestry had every appearance of being the one used for the delivery of the arrow. But was it? Might it not, in some strange and unaccountable way, have been flung there previous to the present event and by some hand no longer in the building? Such coincidences have been known, and while as a rule this old and experienced detective put little confidence in coincidences of any kind, he had but one thought in mind in approaching this final witness, which was to get from him some acknowledgment of having seen, on or about the time of the accident, a movement in the tapestry behind which this bow lay concealed. If once this fact could be established, there could be no further question as to the direct connection between the bow there found and the present crime.  But Mr. Gryce might have spared his pains, so far as this young man was concerned. He had been so engrossed in his search for a particularly rare coin, that he had had no eyes for anything beyond. Besides, he was abnormally nearsighted, not being able, even with his glasses, to distinguish faces at any distance, much less a movement in a piece of tapestry.  All of this was discouraging, even if anticipated; but there were still the people below, some one of whom might have seen what this man had not. He would go down to them now, but by a course which would incidentally enlighten him in regard to another matter about which he had some doubts.  In his goings to and fro through the hall, he had passed the open door of Room H and noted how easily a direct flight could be made through it and Rooms I and J to the small staircase running down at the rear. Whether or not this explained the absence of anyone on this floor who by the utmost stretch of imagination could be held responsible for the accident which had occurred there, he felt it incumbent upon him to see in how short a time the escape he still believed in could be made through these rooms.  Timing his steps from the pedestal nearest this end, he found that even at his slow pace it took but three minutes for him to reach the arcade leading into the court from the foot of the staircase. A man conscious of wrong and eager to escape would do it in less; and if, as possibly happened, he had to wait in the doorway of Room J till Correy and the boy had cleared the way for him by their joint run into the farther gallery, he would still have time to be well on his way to the lower floor before the cry went up which shut off all further egress. Relieved, if not contented with the prospect this gave of a new clue to his problem, he reÃ«ntered the court and was preparing to renew his investigations when the arrival of the Coroner put a temporary end to his efforts as well as to the impatience of the so-called pawns, who were now allowed, one and all, to leave their posts.     V  THREE WHERE TWO SHOULD BE   It was a good half-hour before Mr. Gryce again found himself in a position to pursue the line of investigation thus summarily interrupted. The condition of Mrs. Taylor, which had not been improved by delay, demanded attention, and it was with a sense of great relief that Mr. Gryce finally saw her put into a taxi. Her hurried examination by Coroner Price had elicited nothing new, and of all who had noticed her distraught air on leaving the building, there was not one, if we except the detective, but felt convinced that if she had not been of unsound mind previous to this accident, she certainly had become so since. He still held to his theory that her story, fantastic and out of character as it seemed, was true in all its essentials, and that it was the warning she believed herself to have received of her husband's death, rather than what had taken place under her eyes, which had caused her such extreme suffering and temporarily laid her reason low.  With the full approbation of the Coroner, to whom he had explained his idea, Mr. Gryce began the sifting process by which he hoped to discover the one witness he wanted.  To subject to further durance such persons as from their position at the moment of tragedy could have no information to give bearing in any way upon their investigation was manifestly unfair. The old woman who had been found in Room A was of this class, and accordingly was allowed to go, together with such others as had been within twenty feet or more of the main entrance. These eliminated (it was curious to see how loath these few chosen ones were to depart, now that the opportunity was given them), Mr. Gryce settled down to business by asking Mrs. Lynch to come forward.  She, as you will see by consulting the chart, answered to the person marked \"2.\" A little, dried-up, eager woman rose from the bench on which were collected the few people still remaining, and met his inquiring look with a nervous smile. She, of all the persons moving about on the main floor at the moment of alarm, had been in the best position for seeing the flight of the arrow and the fall of the victim in Section II. Had she seen them? The continued jigging of the small, wiry curls hanging out from either side of her old-fashioned bonnet would seem to betray an inner perturbation indicative of some hitherto suppressed information. At all events Mr. Gryce allowed himself this hope and was most bland and encouraging in his manner as he showed her the place which had been assigned her on the chart drawn up by Sweetwater, and asked if the position given her was correct.  Perhaps a ready reply was too much to expect--women of her stamp not knowing, as a rule, very much about charts. But when he saw her hasten to the very spot assigned her by Sweetwater, he took heart and with a suggestive glance at the gallery intimated that he would be very glad to hear what she had seen there. Her surprise was evident, much too evident for his satisfaction. The little curls jigged about more than ever, and her cheeks grew quite pink as she answered hastily:  \"I didn't see anything. I wasn't looking. Did you think I saw anything?\"  \"I hoped you had,\" he smiled. \"If your eyes had chanced to be turned toward that end of the gallery----\"  \"But I was going the other way. My back was to it, not my face--like this.\" And wheeling herself about, she showed him that she had been walking toward the rear of the building rather than advancing toward the front.  His disappointment was great; but it would have been greater if he had not realized that under these conditions she was in the precise position to meet face to face any person emerging into the court from the foot of the small staircase. If she could tell him of having seen any such person, and closely enough to be able to give a description of this person's appearance, then she might prove to be his prime witness, after all. But she could not satisfy him on this point. She had been on her way out, and was too busy searching in her bag for her umbrella check to notice whether there were people about her or not. She had not found it when the great shout came.  \"And then?\"  Oh, then she was so frightened and so shocked that everything swam before her eyes and she nearly fell! Her heart was not a strong one and sometimes missed a beat or two, and she thought it must have done so then, for when her head steadied again, she found herself clinging to the balustrade of the great staircase.  \"Then you have nothing whatever to add to what the others have told?\"  Her \"no,\" if a shaky one, was decisive, and seeing no reason for detaining her further, he gave her permission to depart.  Disturbed in his calculations, but not disheartened, Mr. Gryce next proceeded to interrogate the door-man at this end of the building. From his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17763"],["title","The Mystery of the Hasty Arrow (#8)"],["body","sition, facing as he did the approach from the small staircase, he should be able to say, if the old lady could not, whether anyone had crossed the open strip of court toward which she had been advancing. But Mr. Gryce found him no more clear-headed on this point than she. He was the oldest man connected with the museum, and had been very much shaken up by what had occurred. Really, he could not say whether anyone had passed across his line of vision at that time or not. All he could be sure of was that no attempt had been made by anyone to reach the door after he had been bidden to close it.  So this clue ended like the rest in no thoroughfare. Would he have any better luck with the subject of his next inquiry? The young lady tabulated as No. 13 was where she could have seen the upper edge of the tapestry shake if she had been looking that way; but she was not. She also was going from instead of toward the point of interest--in other words, entering and not leaving the room on whose threshold she stood.  Only two men were left from whom he could hope to obtain the important testimony he was so anxiously seeking: Nos. 10 and 11. He had turned back toward the bench where they should be awaiting his attention and was debating whether he would gain more by attacking them singly or together, when he suddenly became aware of a fact which drove all these small considerations out of his mind.  According to every calculation and according to the chart, there should be only these two men on that bench. But he saw _three_. Who was this third man, and where had he come from?     VI  THE MAN IN THE GALLERY   Beckoning to Sweetwater, Mr. Gryce pointed out this extra man and asked him if he recognized him as one of the twenty-two he had tabulated.  The answer was a vigorous no. \"It's a new face to me. He must have dropped from the roof or come up through the flooring. He certainly wasn't anywhere about when I made out my list. He looks a trifle hipped, eh?\"  \"Troubled--decidedly troubled.\"  \"You might go a little further and say done up.\"  \"Good-looking, though. Appears to be of foreign birth.\"  \"English, I should say, and just over.\"  \"English, without a doubt. I'll go speak to him; you wait here, but watch out for the Coroner, and send him my way as soon as he's at leisure.\"  Then he reapproached the bench, and observing, with the keenness with which he observed everything without a direct look, that with each step he took the stranger's confusion increased, he decided to wait till after he had finished with the others, before he entered upon an inquiry which might prove not only lengthy but of the first importance.  He was soon very glad that he had done this. He got nothing from Mr. Simpson; but the questions put to Mr. Turnbull were more productive. Almost at the first word, this gentleman acknowledged that he had seen a movement in the great square of tapestry to which Mr. Gryce drew his attention. He did not know when, or just where he stood at the time, but he certainly had noticed it shake.  \"Can you describe the movement?\" asked the gratified detective.  \"It swayed out----\"  \"As if blown by some wind?\"  \"No, more as if pushed forward by a steady hand.\"  \"Good! And what then?\"  \"It settled back almost without a quiver.\"  \"Instantly?\"  \"No, not instantly. A moment or two passed before it fell back into place.\"  \"This was before the attendant Correy called out his alarm, of course?\"  Yes, of course it was before; but how long before, he couldn't say. A minute--two minutes--five minutes--how could he tell! He had no watch in hand.  Mr. Gryce thought possibly he might assist the man's memory on this point but forbore to do so at the time. It was enough for his present purpose that the necessary link to the establishment of his theory had been found. No more doubt now that the bow lying in the niche of the doorway overhead had been the one made use of in this desperate tragedy; and the way thus cleared for him, he could confidently proceed in his search for the man who had flung it there. He believed him to be within his reach at that very moment, but his countenance gave no index to his thought as reapproaching the young man now sitting all alone on the bench, he halted before him and pleasantly inquired:  \"Do I see you for the first time? I thought we had listed the name of every person in the building. How is it that we did not get yours?\"  The tide of color which instantly flooded the young man's countenance astonished Mr. Gryce both by its warmth and fullness. If he were as thin-skinned as this betokened, one should experience but little difficulty in reaching the heart of his trouble.  With an air of quiet interest Mr. Gryce sat down by the young man's side. Would this display of friendliness have the effect of restoring some of his self-possession and giving him the confidence he evidently lacked? No, the red fled from his cheek, and a ghastly white took its place; but he showed no other change.  Meantime the detective studied his countenance. It was a good one, but just now so distorted by suffering that only such as were familiar with his every look could read his character from his present expression. Would a more direct question rouse him? Possibly. At all events, Mr. Gryce decided to make the experiment.  \"Will you give me your name?\" he asked, \"--your name and residence?\"  The man he addressed gave a quick start, pulled himself together and made an attempt to reply.  \"My name is Travis. I am an Englishman just off the steamer from Southampton. My home is in the county of Hertfordshire. I have no residence here.\"  \"Your hotel, then?\"  Another flush--then quickly: \"I have not yet chosen one.\"  This was too surprising for belief. A stranger in town without rooms or hotel accommodations, making use of the morning hours to visit a museum!  \"You must be very much interested in art!\" observed his inquisitor a little dryly.  Again that flush and again the quick-recurring pallor.  \"I--I am interested in all things beautiful,\" he replied at last in broken tones.  \"I see. May I ask where you were when that arrow flew which killed a young lady visitor? Not in this part of the court, I take it?\"  Mr. Travis gave a quick shudder and that was all. The detective waited, but no other answer came.  \"I am told that as she fell she uttered one cry. Did you hear it, Mr. Travis?\"  \"It wasn't a cry,\" was his quick reply. \"It was something quite different, but dreadful, dreadful!\"  Mr. Gryce's manner changed.  \"Then you did hear it. You were near enough to distinguish between a scream and a gasp. Where were you, and why weren't you seen by my man when he went through the building?\"  \"I--I was kneeling out of sight--too shocked to move. But I grew tired of that and wanted to go; but on reaching the court, I found the doors closed. So I came here.\"  \"Kneeling! Where were you kneeling?\"  He made a quick gesture in the direction of the galleries.  The detective frowned, perhaps to hide his secret satisfaction.  \"Won't you be a little more definite?\" he asked; then as the man continued to hesitate he added, but as yet without any appreciable loss of kindliness: \"Every other person here has been good enough to show us the exact place he was occupying at that serious moment. I must ask you to do the same; it is only just.\"  Was the look this called up one of fear or of simple repugnance? It might be either; but the detective was disposed to consider it fear.  \"Will you lead the way?\" he pursued. \"I shall be glad to follow.\"  A glance of extreme reproach; then these words, uttered with painful intensity:  \"You want me to go back there--where I saw--where I can see again--_I cannot_. I'm not well. I suffer. You will excuse me. You will allow me to say what I have to say, _here_.\"  \"I'm sorry, but I cannot do that. The others have gone without question to their places; why should not you?\"  \"Because----\" The word came brokenly and was followed by silence. Then, seeing the hopelessness of contending with police authority, he cast another glance of strong repulsion in the direction of the gallery and started to his feet. Mr. Gryce did the same, and together they crossed the court. But they got no further at this time than the foot of the staircase. Coroner Price, by an extra effort which seemed to be called for by the circumstances, had succeeded in picking up a jury from the people collected on the street, and entering at this moment, created a diversion which effectively postponed the detective's examination of his new witness.  When the opportunity came for resuming it, so much time had elapsed that Mr. Gryce looked for some decided change in the manner or bearing of the man who, unfortunately for his purposes, had thus been given a quiet hour in which to think. Better, much better, for the cause of justice, if he could have pushed him to the point at once, harried him, as it were, in hot blood. Now he might find him more difficult.  But when, in company with the Coroner, who now found himself free to assist him in his hunt for witnesses, he reapproached the Englishman sitting as before alone on his bench, it was to find him to all appearance in the same mind in which he had left him. He wore the same look and followed with the same reluctance when he was made to understand that the time had now come for him to show just where he was standing when that arrow was sped on its death-course. And greatly impressed by this fact, which in a way contradicted all his expectations, Mr. Gryce trod slowly after, watching with the keenest interest to see whether, on reaching the top of the steps, this man upon whose testimony so much depended would turn toward the southern gallery where the girl had fallen, or toward the northern one, where Correy had found the bow.  It looked as if he were going to the left, for his head turned that way as he cleared the final step. But his body soon swayed aside in the other direction, and by the time the old"]]]
