But howsoever thy opinion is spent upon these, that incouragement I have already received from the most ingenious men in their clear and courteous entertainment of Mr. Wallers late choice Peeces, hath once more made me adventure into the World, presenting it with these ever-green, and not to be blasted Laurels.

ON THE MORNING OF CHRISTS NATIVITY.   Compos'd 1629.    I    This is the Month, and this the happy morn   Wherin the Son of Heav'ns eternal King,   Of wedded Maid, and Virgin Mother born,   Our great redemption from above did bring;   For so the holy sages once did sing,   That he our deadly forfeit should release,   And with his Father work us a perpetual peace.    II    That glorious Form, that Light unsufferable,   And that far-beaming blaze of Majesty,   Wherwith he wont at Heav'ns high Councel-Table,                      10   To sit the midst of Trinal Unity,   He laid aside; and here with us to be,   Forsook the Courts of everlasting Day,   And chose with us a darksom House of mortal Clay.    III    Say Heav'nly Muse, shall not thy sacred vein   Afford a present to the Infant God?   Hast thou no vers, no hymn, or solemn strein,   To welcom him to this his new abode,   Now while the Heav'n by the Suns team untrod,   Hath took no print of the approching light,                          20   And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright?    IV    See how from far upon the Eastern rode   The Star-led Wisards haste with odours sweet,   O run,  prevent them with thy humble ode,   And lay it lowly at his blessed feet;   Have thou the honour first, thy Lord to greet,   And joyn thy voice unto the Angel Quire,   From out his secret Altar toucht with hallow'd fire.     The Hymn.    I    IT was the Winter wilde,   While the Heav'n-born-childe,                                        30   All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies;   Nature in aw to him   Had doff't her gawdy trim,   With her great Master so to sympathize:   It was no season then for her   To wanton with the Sun her lusty Paramour.    II    Only with speeches fair   She woo'd the gentle Air   To hide her guilty front with innocent Snow,   And on her naked shame,                                              40   Pollute with sinfull blame,   The Saintly Vail of Maiden white to throw,   Confounded, that her Makers eyes   Should look so near upon her foul deformities.    III    But he her fears to cease,   Sent down the meek-eyd Peace,   She crown'd with Olive green, came softly sliding   Down through the turning sphear   His ready Harbinger,   With Turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing,                        50   And waving wide her mirtle wand,   She strikes a universall Peace through Sea and Land.    IV    No War, or Battails sound   Was heard the World around,   The idle spear and shield were high up hung;   The hooked Chariot stood   Unstain'd with hostile blood,   The Trumpet spake not to the armed throng,   And Kings sate still with awfull eye,   As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by.                     60    V    But peacefull was the night   Wherin the Prince of light   His raign of peace upon the earth began:   The Windes with wonder whist,   Smoothly the waters kist,   Whispering new joyes to the milde Ocean,   Who now hath quite forgot to rave,   While Birds of Calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.    VI    The Stars with deep amaze   Stand fit in steadfast gaze,                                         70   Bending one way their pretious influence,   And will not take their flight,   For all the morning light,   Or Lucifer that often warned them thence;   But in their glimmering Orbs did glow,   Until their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go.    VII    And though the shady gloom   Had given day her room,   The Sun himself with-held his wonted speed,   And hid his head for shame,                                          80   As his inferior flame,   The new enlightened world no more should need;   He saw a greater Sun appear   Then his bright Throne, or burning Axletree could bear.    VIII    The Shepherds on the Lawn,   Or ere the point of dawn,   Sate simply chatting in a rustic row;   Full little thought they than,   That the mighty Pan   Was kindly com to live with them below;                              90   Perhaps their loves, or els their sheep,   Was all that did their silly thoughts so busie keep.    IX    When such Musick sweet   Their hearts and ears did greet,   As never was by mortal finger strook,   Divinely-warbled voice   Answering the stringed noise,   As all their souls in blisfull rapture took:   The Air such pleasure loth to lose,   With  thousand echo's still prolongs each heav'nly close.           100    X    Nature that heard such  sound   Beneath  the hollow round   of Cynthia's seat the Airy region thrilling,   Now was almost won   To think her part was don   And that her raign had here its last fulfilling;   She knew such harmony alone   Could hold all Heav'n and Earth in happier union.    XI    At last surrounds their sight   A globe of circular light,                                          110   That with long beams the shame faced night arrayed   The helmed Cherubim   And sworded Seraphim,   Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displaid,   Harping in loud and solemn quire,   With unexpressive notes to Heav'ns new-born Heir.    XII    Such Musick (as 'tis said)   Before was never made,   But when of old the sons of morning sung,   While the Creator Great   His constellations set,                                             120   And the well-ballanc't world on hinges hung,   And cast the dark foundations deep,   And bid the weltring waves their oozy channel keep.    XIII    Ring out ye Crystall sphears,   Once bless our human ears,   (If ye have power to touch our senses so)   And let your silver chime   Move in melodious time;   And let the Base of Heav'ns deep Organ blow,                        130   And with your ninefold harmony   Make up full consort to th'Angelike symphony.    XIV    For if such holy Song   Enwrap our fancy long,   Time will run back, and fetch the age of gold,   And speckl'd vanity   Will sicken soon and die,   And leprous sin will melt from earthly mould,   And Hell it self will pass away   And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.                 140    XV    Yea Truth, and Justice then   Will down return to men,   Th'enameld Arras of the Rain-bow wearing,   And Mercy set between   Thron'd in Celestiall sheen,   With radiant feet the tissued clouds down stearing,   And Heav'n as at som festivall,   Will open wide the gates of her high Palace Hall.    XVI    But wisest Fate sayes  no,   This must not yet be so,                                            150   The Babe lies yet in smiling Infancy,   That on the bitter cross   Must redeem our loss;   So both himself and us to glorifie:   Yet first to those ychain'd in sleep,   The Wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep,    XVII    With such a horrid clang   As on Mount Sinai rang   While the red fire, and smouldring clouds out brake:   The aged Earth agast                                                160   With terrour of that blast,   Shall from the surface to the center shake;   When at the worlds last session,   The dreadfull Judge in middle Air shall spread his throne.    XVIII    And then at last  our bliss   Full and perfect is,   But now begins; for from this happy day   Th'old Dragon under ground   In straiter limits bound,   Not half so far casts his usurped sway,                             170   And wrath to see his Kingdom fail,   Swindges the scaly Horrour of his foulded tail.    XIX    The Oracles are dumm,   No voice or hideous humm   Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving.   Apollo from his shrine   Can no more divine,   With hollow shreik the steep of Delphos leaving.   No nightly trance, or breathed spell,   Inspire's the pale-ey'd Priest from the prophetic cell.             180    XX    The lonely mountains o're,   And the resounding shore,   A voice of weeping heard, and loud lament;   From haunted spring, and dale   Edg'd with poplar pale   The parting Genius is with sighing sent,   With flowre-inwov'n tresses torn   The Nimphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.    XXI    In consecrated Earth,   And on the holy Hearth,                                             190   The Lars, and Lemures moan with midnight plaint,   In Urns, and Altars round,   A drear, and dying sound   Affrights the Flamins at their service quaint;   And the chill Marble seems to sweat,   While each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat.    XXII    Peor, and Baalim,   Forsake their Temples dim,   With that twise-batter'd god of Palestine,   And mooned Ashtaroth,            "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1745"],["title","The Poetical Works of John Milton (#3)"],["body","                                   200   Heav'ns Queen and Mother both,   Now sits not girt with Tapers holy shine,   The Libyc Hammon shrinks his horn,   In vain the Tyrian Maids their wounded Thamuz mourn.    XXIII    And sullen Moloch fled,   Hath left in shadows dred,   His burning Idol all of blackest hue,   In vain with Cymbals ring,   They call the grisly king,   In dismall dance about the furnace Blue;                            210   And Brutish gods of Nile as fast,   Isis and Orus, and the Dog Anubis hast.    XXIV    Nor is Osiris seen   In Memphian grove or green,            Trampling the unshower'd grass with lowings loud;   Nor can he be at rest   Within his sacred chest,            Naught but profoundest Hell can be his shroud:   In vain with timbrel'd anthems dark   The sable-stoled sorcerers bear his worshipp'd ark.    XXV    He feels from Juda's land   The dreaded Infant's hand,            The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn;   Nor all the gods beside   Longer dare abide,            Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine:   Our Babe, to show his Godhead true,   Can in his swaddling bands control the damned crew.    XXVI    So when the Sun in bed,   Curtain'd with cloudy red,            Pillows his chin upon an orient wave,   The flocking shadows pale   Troop to th'infernal jail,            Each fetter'd ghost slips to his several grave,   And the yellow-skirted fays   Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-lov'd maze.    XXVII    But see, the Virgin blest   Hath laid her Babe to rest:            Time is our tedious song should here have ending.   Heav'n's youngest-teemed star,   Hath fix'd her polish'd car,            Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending;   And all about the courtly stable,   Bright-harness'd Angels sit in order serviceable.     THE PASSION.     I    ERE-while of Musick, and Ethereal mirth,   Wherwith the stage of Ayr and Earth did ring,   And joyous news of heav'nly Infants birth,   My muse with Angels did divide to sing;   But headlong joy is ever on the wing,   In Wintry solstice like the shortn'd light   Soon swallow'd up in dark and long out-living night.    II    For now to sorrow must I tune my song,   And set my Harpe to notes of saddest wo,   Which on our dearest Lord did sease er'e long,   Dangers, and snares, and wrongs, and worse then so,                  10   Which he for us did freely undergo.   Most perfect Heroe, try'd in heaviest plight   Of labours huge and hard, too hard for human wight.    III    He sov'ran Priest stooping his regall head   That dropt with odorous oil down his fair eyes,   Poor fleshly Tabernacle entered,   His starry front low-rooft beneath the skies;   O what a Mask was there, what a disguise!   Yet more; the stroke of death he must abide,                         20   Then lies him meekly down fast by his Brethrens side.    IV    These latter scenes confine my roving vers,   To this Horizon is my Phoebus bound,   His Godlike acts, and his temptations fierce,   And former sufferings other where are found;   Loud o're the rest Cremona's Trump doth sound;   Me softer airs befit, and softer strings   Of Lute, or Viol still, more apt for mournful things.    Note: 22 latter] latest 1673.    V    Befriend me night best Patroness of grief,   Over the Pole thy thickest mantle throw,                             30   And work my flatterd fancy to belief,   That Heav'n and Earth are colour'd with my wo;   My sorrows are too dark for day to know:   The leaves should all be black wheron I write,   And letters where my tears have washt a wannish white.    VI    See see the Chariot, and those rushing wheels,   That whirl'd the Prophet up at Chebar flood,   My spirit som transporting Cherub feels,   To bear me where the Towers of Salem stood,   Once glorious Towers, now sunk in guiltles blood;                    40   There doth my soul in holy vision sit   In pensive trance, and anguish, and ecstatick fit.    VII    Mine eye hath found that sad Sepulchral rock   That was the Casket of Heav'ns richest store,   And here though grief my feeble hands up-lock,   Yet on the softned Quarry would I score   My plaining vers as lively as before;   For sure so well instructed are my tears,   They would fitly fall in order'd Characters.    VIII    I thence hurried on viewles wing,                                    50   Take up a weeping on the Mountains wilde,   The gentle neighbourhood of grove and spring   Would soon unboosom all their Echoes milde,   And I (for grief is easily beguild)   Might think th'infection of my sorrows bound,   Had got a race of mourners on som pregnant cloud.    Note: This subject the Author finding to be above the yeers he had,   when he wrote it, and nothing satisfi'd with what was begun,   left it unfinish'd.     ON TIME.     FLY envious Time, till thou run out thy race,   Call on the lazy leaden-stepping hours,   Whose speed is but the heavy Plummets pace;   And glut thy self with what thy womb devours,   Which is no more then what is false and vain,   And meerly mortal dross;   So little is our loss,   So little is thy gain.   For when as each thing bad thou hast entomb'd,   And last of all, thy greedy self consum'd,                           10   Then long Eternity shall greet our bliss   With an individual kiss;   And Joy shall overtake us as a flood,   When every thing that is sincerely good   And perfectly divine,   With Truth, and Peace, and Love shall ever shine   About the supreme Throne   Of him, t'whose happy-making sight alone,   When once our heav'nly-guided soul shall clime,   Then all this Earthy grosnes quit,                                   20   Attir'd with Stars, we shall for ever sit,   Triumphing over Death, and Chance, and thee O Time.    Note: See the appendix for the manuscript version.     UPON THE CIRCUMCISION.     YE flaming Powers, and winged Warriours bright,   That erst with Musick, and triumphant song   First heard by happy watchful Shepherds ear,   So sweetly sung your Joy the Clouds along   Through the soft silence of the list'ning night;   Now mourn, and if sad share with us to bear   Your fiery essence can distill no tear,   Burn in your sighs, and borrow   Seas wept from our deep sorrow,   He who with all Heav'ns heraldry whileare                            10   Enter'd the world, now bleeds to give us ease;   Alas, how soon our sin   Sore doth begin   His Infancy to sease!    O more exceeding love or law more just?   Just law indeed, but more exceeding love!   For we by rightfull doom remediles   Were lost in death, till he that dwelt above   High thron'd in secret bliss, for us frail dust   Emptied his glory, ev'n to nakednes;                                 20   And that great Cov'nant which we still transgress   Intirely satisfi'd,   And the full wrath beside   Of vengeful Justice bore for our excess,   And seals obedience first with wounding smart   This day, but O ere long   Huge pangs and strong   Will pierce more neer his heart.     AT A SOLEMN MUSICK.     BLEST pair of Sirens, pledges of Heav'ns joy,   Sphear-born harmonious Sisters, Voice, and Vers,   Wed your divine sounds, and mixt power employ   Dead things with inbreath'd sense able to pierce,   And to our high-rais'd phantasie present,   That undisturbed Song of pure content,   Ay sung before the saphire-colour'd throne   To him that sits theron   With Saintly shout, and solemn Jubily,   Where the bright Seraphim in burning row                             10   Their loud up-lifted Angel trumpets blow,   And the Cherubick host in thousand quires   Touch their immortal Harps of golden wires,   With those just Spirits that wear victorious Palms,   Hymns devout and holy Psalms   Singing everlastingly;   That we on Earth with undiscording voice   May rightly answer that melodious noise;   As  once we did, till disproportion'd sin   Jarr'd against natures chime, and with harsh din                     20   The fair musick that all creatures made   To their great Lord, whose love their motion sway'd   In perfect Diapason, whilst they stood   In first obedience, and their state of good.   O may we soon again renew that Song,   And keep in tune with Heav'n, till God ere long   To his celestial consort us unite,   To live with him, and sing in endles morn of light.

THIS rich Marble doth enterr   The honour'd Wife of Winchester,   A Vicounts daughter, an Earls heir,   Besides what her vertues fair   Added to her noble birth,   More then she could own from Earth.   Summers three times eight save one   She had told, alas too soon,   After so short time of breath,   To house with darknes, and with death.                               10   Yet had the number of her days   Bin as compleat as was her praise,   Nature and fate had had no strife   In giving limit to her life.   Her high birth, and her graces sweet,   Quickly found a lover meet;   The Virgin quire for her request   The God that sits at marriage feast;   He at their invoking came   But with a scarce-wel-lighted flame;                                 20   And in his Garland as he stood,   Ye might discern a Cipress bud.   Once had the early Matrons run   To greet her of a lovely son,   And now with second hope she goes,   And calls Lucina to her throws;   But whether by mischance or blame   Atropos for Lucina came;   And with remorsles cruelty,   Spoil'd at once both fruit and tree:                                 30   The haples Babe before his birth   Had burial, yet not laid in earth,   And the languisht Mothers Womb   Was not long a living Tomb.   So have I seen som tender slip   Sav'd with care from Winters nip,   The pride of her carnation train,   Pluck't up by som unheedy swain,   Who onely thought to crop the flowr   New shot up from vernall showr;                                      40"]]]
