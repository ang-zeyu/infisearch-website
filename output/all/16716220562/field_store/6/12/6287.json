Well, since in your reading of methods and new processes, you will often meet with specific gravity numbers and desire to convert these into Twaddell degrees, I will give you a simple means of doing this. Add cyphers so as to make into a number of four figures, then strike out the unit and decimal point farthest to the left, and divide the residue by 5, and you get the corresponding Twaddell degrees. If you have Twaddell degrees, simply multiply by 5, and add 1000 to the result, and you get the specific gravity as usually taken, with water as the unit, or in this case as 1000. An instrument much used on the Continent is the Beaumé hydrometer. The degrees (_n_) indicated by this instrument can be converted into specific gravity (_d_) by the      formula: _d_ = 144·3/(144·3 - n)  _Ebullition or Boiling of Water, Steam._--The atmosphere around us is composed of a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen gases; not a compound of these gases, as water is of hydrogen and oxygen, but a mixture more like sand and water or smoke and air. This mass of gases has weight, and presses upon objects at the surface of the earth to the extent of 15 lb. on the square inch. Now some liquids, such as water, were it not for this atmospheric pressure, would not remain liquids at all, but would become gases. The pressure thus tends to squeeze gases together and convert them into liquids. Any force that causes gases to contract will do the same thing, of course--for example, cold; and _ceteris paribus_ removal of pressure and expansion by heat will act so as to gasify liquids. When in the expansion of liquids a certain stage or degree is reached, different for different liquids, gas begins to escape so quickly from the liquid that bubbles of vapour are continually formed and escape. This is called ebullition or boiling. A certain removal of pressure, or expansion by heat, is necessary to produce this, _i.e._ to reach the boiling-point of the liquid. As regards the heat necessary for the boiling of water at the surface of the earth, _i.e._ under the atmospheric pressure of 15 lb. on the square inch, this is shown on the thermometer of Fahrenheit as 212°, and on the simpler centigrade one, as 100°, water freezing at 0° C. But if what I have said is true, when we remove some of the atmospheric pressure, the water should boil with a less heat than will cause the mercury in the thermometer to rise to 100° C., and if we take off all the pressure, the water ought to boil and freeze at the same time. This actually happens in the Carré ice-making machine. The question now arises, \"Why does the water freeze in the Carré machine?\" All substances require certain amounts of heat to enable them to take and to maintain the liquid state if they are ordinarily solid, and the gaseous state if ordinarily liquid or solid, and the greater the change of state the greater the heat needed. Moreover, this heat does not make them warm, it is simply absorbed or swallowed up, and becomes latent, and is merely necessary to maintain the new condition assumed. In the case of the Carré machine, liquid water is, by removal of the atmospheric pressure, coerced, as it were, to take the gaseous form. But to do so it needs to absorb the requisite amount of heat to aid it in taking that form, and this heat it must take up from all surrounding warm objects. It absorbs quickly all it can get out of itself as liquid water, out of the glass vessel containing it, and from the surrounding air. But the process of gasification with ebullition goes on so quickly that the temperature of the water thus robbed of heat quickly falls to 0° C., and the remaining water freezes. Thus, then, by pumping out the air from a vessel, _i.e._ working in a vacuum, we can boil a liquid in such exhausted vessel far below its ordinary boiling temperature in the open air. This fact is of the utmost industrial importance. But touching this question of latent heat, you may ask me for my proof that there is latent heat, and a large amount of it, in a substance that feels perfectly cold. I have told you that a gasified liquid, or a liquefied solid, or most of all a gasified solid, contains such heat, and if reconverted into liquid and solid forms respectively, that heat is evolved, or becomes sensible heat, and then it can be decidedly felt and indicated by the thermometer. Take the case of a liquid suddenly solidifying. The heat latent in that liquid, and necessary to keep it a liquid, is no longer necessary and comes out, and the substance appears to become hot. Quicklime is a cold, white, solid substance, but there is a compound of water and lime--slaked lime--which is also a solid powdery substance, called by the chemist, hydrate of lime. The water used to slake the quicklime is a liquid, and it may be ice-cold water, but to form hydrate of lime it must assume a solid form, and hence can and does dispense with its heat of liquefaction in the change of state. You all know how hot lime becomes on slaking with water. Of course we have heat of chemical combination here as well as evolution of latent heat. As another example, we may take a solution of acetate of soda, so strong that it is just on the point of crystallising. If it crystallises it solidifies, and the liquid consequently gives up its latent heat of liquefaction. We will make it crystallise, first connecting the tube containing it to another one containing a coloured liquid and closed by a cork carrying a narrow tube dipping into the coloured liquid. On crystallising, the solution gives off heat, as is shown by the expansion of the air in the corked tube, and the consequent forcing of the coloured liquid up the narrow tube. Consequently in your works you never dissolve a salt or crystal in water or other liquid without rendering heat latent, or consuming heat; you never allow steam to condense in the steam pipes about the premises without losing vastly more heat than possibly many are aware of. Let us inquire as to the latent heat of water and of steam.  _Latent Heats of Water and Steam._--If we mix 1 kilogram (about 2 lb.) of ice (of course at zero or 0° C.) with 1 kilogram of water at 79° C., and stir well till the ice is melted, _i.e._ has changed its state from solid to liquid, we find, on putting a thermometer in, the temperature is only 0° C. This simply means that 79° of heat (centigrade degrees) have become latent, and represent the heat of liquefaction of 1 kilogram of ice. Had we mixed 1 kilogram of water at 0° C. with 1 kilogram of water at 79° C. there would have been no change of state, and the temperature of the mixture might be represented as a distribution of the 79° C. through the whole mass of the 2 kilograms, and so would be 39-1/2° C. We say, therefore, the latent heat of water is the heat which is absorbed or rendered latent when a unit of weight, say 1 kilogram of water as ice, melts and liquefies to a unit of water at zero, or it is 79 heat units. These 79 units of heat would raise 79 units of weight of liquid water through 1° C., or one unit of liquid water through 79°.  Let us now inquire what the latent heat of steam is. If we take 1 kilogram of water at 0° C. and blow steam from boiling water at 100° C. into it until the water just boils, and then stop and weigh the resulting water, we shall find it amounts to 1·187 kilograms, so that 0·187 kilogram of water which was in the gaseous steam form, and had besides a sensible heat of 100° C., has changed its state to that of liquid water. This liquid water, being at the boiling-point, has still the 100° C. of sensible heat, and hence the water in the gaseous steam form can have given up to the water at 0° C. into which it was blown, only the latent heat of gasification which was not sensible, but by virtue of which it was enabled to assume the gaseous form. But if 0·187 kilogram of steam at 100° C. can heat 1 kilogram of water through 100 degrees, then 1 kilogram of steam can raise 5·36 kilograms of ice-cold water through 100 degrees, or 536 kilograms through 1 degree, and thus the latent heat of steam is 536 heat units.  _Effect of Increase of Pressure on the Boiling of Water._--Now we have referred to diminution of pressure and its effect on the boiling-point of water, and I may point out that by increasing the pressure, such, _e.g._, as boiling water under a high pressure of steam, you raise the boiling-point. There are some industrial operations in which the action of certain boiling solutions is unavailing to effect certain decompositions or other ends when the boiling is carried on under the ordinary atmospheric pressure, and boiling in closed and strong vessels under pressure must be resorted to. Take as an example the wood-pulp process for making paper from wood shavings. Boiling in open pans with caustic soda lye is insufficient to reduce the wood to pulp, and so boiling in strong vessels under pressure is adopted. The temperature of the solution rises far above 212° F. (100° C.). Let us see what may result chemically from the attainment of such high temperatures of water in our steam boilers working under high pressures. If you blow ordinary steam at 212° F. or 100° C., into fats or oils, the fats and oils remain undecomposed; but suppose you let fatty and oily matters of animal or vegetable origin, such as lubricants, get into your boiler feed-water and so into your boiler, what will happen? I have only to tell you that a process is patented for decomposing fats with superheated steam, to drive or distil over the admixed fatty acids and glycerin, in order to show you that in your boilers such greasy matters will be more or less decomposed. Fats are neutral as fats, and will not injure the iron of the boilers; but once decompose them and they are split up into an acid called a fat acid, and glycerin. That fat acid at the high temperature soon attacks your boilers and pipes, and eats away the iron. That is one of the curious results that may follow at such high"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17740"],["title","The Chemistry of Hat Manufacturing (#6)"],["body","ures. Mineral or hydrocarbon oils do not contain these fat acids, and so cannot possibly, even with high-pressure steam, corrode the boiler metal.  _Effect of Dissolved Salts on the Boiling of Water._--Let us inquire what this effect is? Suppose we dissolve a quantity of a salt in water, and then blow steam at 100° C. (212° F.) into that water, the latter will boil not at 212° F., but at a higher temperature. There is a certain industrial process I know of, in course of which it is necessary first to maintain a vessel containing water, by means of a heated closed steam coil, at 212° F. (100° C.), and at a certain stage to raise the temperature to about 327° F. (164° C.). The pressure on the boiler connected with the steam coil is raised to nearly seven atmospheres, and thus the heat of the high-pressure steam rises to 327° F. (164° C.), and then a considerable quantity of nitrate of ammonium, a crystallised salt, is thrown into the water, in which it dissolves. Strange to say, although the water alone would boil at 212° F., a strong solution in water of the ammonium nitrate only boils at 327° F., so that the effect of dissolving that salt in the water is the same as if the pressure were raised to seven atmospheres. Now let us, as hat manufacturers, learn a practical lesson from this fact. We have observed that wool and fur fibres are injured by boiling in pure water, and the heat has much to do with this damage; but if the boiling take place in bichrome liquors or similar solutions, that boiling will, according to the strength of the solution in dissolved matters, take place at a temperature more or less elevated above the boiling-point of water, and so the damage done will be the more serious the more concentrated the liquors are, quite independently of the nature of the substances dissolved in those liquors.  _Solution._--We have already seen that when a salt of any kind dissolves in water, heat is absorbed, and becomes latent; in other words, cold is produced. I will describe a remarkable example or experiment, well illustrating this fact. If you take some Glauber's salt, crystallised sulphate of soda, and mix it with some hydrochloric acid (or spirits of salt), then so rapidly will the solution proceed, and consequently so great will be the demand for heat, that if a vessel containing water be put in amongst the dissolving salt, the heat residing in that vessel and its water will be rapidly extracted, and the water will freeze. As regards solubility, some salts and substances are much more quickly and easily dissolved than others. We are generally accustomed to think that to dissolve a substance quickly we cannot do better than build a fire under the containing vessel, and heat the liquid. This is often the correct method of proceeding, but not always. Thus it would mean simply loss of fuel, and so waste of heat, to do this in dissolving ordinary table salt or rock salt in water, for salt is as soluble in cold water as in hot. Some salts are, incredible though it may appear, less soluble in boiling water than in cold. Water just above the freezing-point dissolves nearly twice as much lime as it does when boiling. You see, then, that a knowledge of certain important facts like these may be so used as to considerably mitigate your coal bills, under given circumstances and conditions.     LECTURE IV  WATER: ITS CHEMISTRY AND PROPERTIES; IMPURITIES AND THEIR ACTION; TESTS OF PURITY--_Continued_   In the last lecture, under the head of \"Solution,\" I mentioned that some salts, some chemical substances, are more soluble in water than others, and that their solubilities under different circumstances of temperature vary in different ways. However, some salts and compounds are practically insoluble in water under any circumstances. We now arrive at the important result known to chemists as the precipitation of insoluble compounds from solutions. In order to define this result, however, we must, of course, first consider the circumstances of causation of the result. Let us take a simple case of chemical decomposition resulting in the deposition or precipitation of a substance from solution in the insoluble state. We will take a salt you are probably acquainted with--sulphate of copper, or bluestone, and dissolve it in water, and we have then the sulphate of copper in solution in water. Now suppose it is our desire to obtain from that solution all the copper by depositing it in some insoluble form. We may accomplish this in several different ways, relying on certain methods of decomposing that sulphate of copper. One of the simplest and most economical is that adopted in a certain so-called wet method of extracting copper. It is based on the fact that metallic iron has a greater tendency to combine in water solutions, with the acids of copper salts, than the copper has in those salts. We simply need to place some scraps of iron in the copper sulphate solution to induce a change which may be represented as follows: Copper sulphate, consisting of a combination of copper oxide with sulphuric acid, yields with iron, iron sulphate, a combination of iron oxide with sulphuric acid, and metallic copper. The metallic copper produced separates in the form of a red coating on the iron scraps. But we may also, relying on the fact that oxide of copper is insoluble in water, arrange for the deposition of the copper in that form. This we can do by adding caustic soda to a hot solution of copper sulphate, when we get the following change: Copper sulphate, consisting of a combination of copper oxide with sulphuric acid, yields with caustic soda, sulphate of soda, a combination of soda with sulphuric acid and oxide of copper. Oxide of copper is black, and so in this decomposition what is called a \"black precipitate\" of that oxide is produced on adding the caustic soda. But it might not suit us thus to deposit the copper from our solution; we might desire to remove the sulphuric acid from the copper sulphate, and leave the copper dissolved, say in the form of a chloride. We select, then, a compound which is a chloride, and a chloride of a metal which forms an insoluble combination with sulphuric acid--chloride of barium, say. On adding this chloride of barium to sulphate of copper solution, we get then a change which we might represent thus: Copper sulphate, consisting of a combination of copper oxide with sulphuric acid, yields with barium chloride, which is a combination of barium and chlorine, insoluble barium sulphate, a combination of barium oxide with sulphuric acid, and soluble copper chloride, a combination of copper and chlorine. This is called a double interchange. Now these are a few illustrations to show you what is meant by chemical decompositions. One practical lesson, of course, we may draw is this: We must have a care in dissolving bluestone or copper sulphate, not to attempt it in iron pans, and not to store or put verdigris into iron vessels, or the iron will be acted upon, and to some extent the copper salt will become contaminated with iron. It will now be clear to you that, as a solvent for bodies usually soluble in water, water that is perfectly pure will be most suitable and not likely to cause any deposition or precipitation through chemical decompositions, for there are no salts or other compounds in pure water to cause such changes. Such pure water is called soft water. But the term is only a comparative one, and water that is not quite, but nearly pure--pure enough for most practical purposes--is also called soft water. Now rain is the purest form of natural water, for it is a kind of distilled water. Water rises in vapour from the ocean as from a still, and the salt and other dissolved matters remain behind. Meeting cold currents of air, the vapours condense in rain, and fall upon the earth. After coming in contact with the earth, the subsequent condition of that water entirely depends upon the character, as regards solubility or insolubility, of the substances composing the strata or layers of earth upon which it falls, and through which it sinks. If it meets with insoluble rocks--for all rocks are not insoluble--it remains, of course, pure and soft, and in proportion as the constituents of rock and soil are soluble, in that proportion does the water become hard. We all know how dangerous acid is in water, causing that water to act on many substances, the iron of iron vessels, the lime in soil or rock, etc., bringing iron and lime respectively into solution. Now the atmosphere contains carbonic acid, and carbonic acid occurs in the earth, being evolved by decomposing vegetation, etc. Carbonic acid is also soluble to a certain, though not large extent, in water. As we shall see, water charged with carbonic acid attacks certain substances insoluble in pure water, and brings them into solution, and thus the water soon becomes hard. About the close of the last lecture, I said that lime is, to a certain extent, soluble in cold water. The solution is called lime-water; it might be called a solution of caustic lime. When carbonic acid gas first comes in contact with such a solution, chalk or carbonate of lime, which is insoluble in water, is formed, and the lime is thus precipitated as carbonate. Supposing, however, we continued to pass carbonic acid gas into that water, rendered milky with chalk powder, very soon the liquid would clear, and we should get once more a solution of lime, but not caustic lime as it was at first, simply now a solution of carbonate of lime in carbonic acid, or a solution of bicarbonate of lime. I will take some lime-water, and I will blow through; my breath contains carbonic acid, and you will see the clear liquid become milky owing to separation of insoluble carbonate of lime, or chalk. I now continue blowing, and at length that chalk dissolves with the excess of carbonic acid, forming bicarbonate of lime. This experiment explains how it is that water percolating through or running"]]]
