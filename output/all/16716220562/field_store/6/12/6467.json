On February 3 they were measured and weighed, with the following results:  ---------------------------------------------------          |         | Measurements (in millimetres).          | Weight  |-------------------------------          | (in     | Total   | Tail       | Hind          | grams). | length. | vertebrae. | foot. ---------|---------|---------|------------|-------- No. 1    | 13.3    |   90    |     38     |  24 No. 2    | 12.6    |   93    |     38     |  24 ---------------------------------------------------  At this stage the young were partially clothed with a coat of fine velvety fur, more especially on the bodies, the tails being still nearly naked. The body color was dark plumbeous, just the color of the dark underfur of the adult, or a shade darker, while the characteristic white markings of the adult stood out sharply as pinkish-white areas against the dark background (see Pl. IX, Fig. 2, at p. 32). The proportions were much as in the adult, except that the tails were relatively much shorter and the feet relatively longer.  Only one other record of young is at hand, that by Bailey, who secured the young after capture of a suckling female at Santa Rosa, N. Mex. In this case the litter contained only one. This was squeaking when found, but was not large enough to crawl away. Its eyes and ears were closed, and its soft, naked skin was distinctly marked with the pattern of the adult, the colors being as given for the other two. This juvenile lived only a week. Young less than half grown were not trapped or noted in our poisoning operations outside the dens.  Kangaroo rats, if _spectabilis_ be representative, reproduce at a slow rate as compared with many other small rodents. We have records of 67 females with embryos or scars showing the number produced, and of the two litters of young described above. Of the 69 females thus recorded, 15, or 21.7 per cent, had but one offspring each; 52, or 75.3 per cent, but two each; while only 2 individuals, or 2.9 per cent, had three. Three young is the maximum litter recorded. This, taken in connection with the protracted breeding season and lack of sure evidence of the production of two broods a year, gives a surprisingly low rate of reproduction, indicating relative freedom from inimical factors.  Our breeding records for _merriami_ are fewer than for _spectabilis_, but are very similar in every way so far as they go, both as to the time of year and number of young.     FOOD AND STORAGE.   _Dipodomys s. spectabilis_ does not hibernate, so must prepare for unfavorable seasons by extensive storage of food materials. There are two seasons of the year, in southeastern Arizona at least, when storage of food takes place, namely, in spring, during April or May, and in fall, from September to November, the latter being the more important. For the periods between, the animal must rely largely on stored materials. Not infrequently a season of severe drought precludes the possibility of any storage. The summer and fall of 1918 was such a season on the Range Reserve (Pl. II, Fig. 2). If food stores are inadequate at such a time the kangaroo rats must perish in considerable numbers. Fisher found many deserted mounds in the vicinity of Dos Cabezos, Ariz., in June, 1894, which may be accounted for in this way. In 1921 Vorhies found all mounds within 4 or 5 miles of Albuquerque, N. Mex., deserted by _spectabilis_, resulting probably from overgrazing by sheep and goats during a succession of dry years. In the arid Southwest natural selection probably favors the animals with the largest food stores, and it is not surprising that the storing habit has been developed to a remarkable degree.  Some stored material is likely to be found at any time of year in any mound examined, the largest quantity usually in fall and winter, the smallest in July or August (Table 1, dens 1, 2, 14, and 24). Amounts found by different observers vary from a few ounces to several quarts or pecks, and stored materials taken from 22 mounds on the Range Reserve vary in weight from 5 to 4,127 grams (more than 9 pounds). This is exceeded by one lot from New Mexico, which totaled 5,750 grams (12.67 pounds). It is fairly evident that in seasons of scanty forage for stock the appropriation of such quantities of grass seeds and crowns and other grazing materials by numerous kangaroo rats may appreciably reduce the carrying capacity of the range. Studies of cheek-pouch contents and food stores taken from dens show that the natural food of _spectabilis_ consists principally of various seeds and fruits, particularly the seeds of certain grasses. The study of burrow contents has been especially illuminating and valuable.  All of the stored material from 22 dens on the Range Reserve and from 2 near Albuquerque, N. Mex., has been saved and analyzed as to species as carefully as the conditions of storage would permit. Within the mound the food stored is usually more or less segregated by plant species, though the stores of material of any one kind may be found in several places through the mound, and often the material is mixed. In the latter case the quantities of the various species can only be estimated, but in the former the species may be kept separate by the use of several bags for collecting the seeds, and a fairly accurate laboratory weighing can be made later. Very frequently, the explanation of this separation of species lies in the different seasons of ripening, but sometimes where two species are ripe at the same time near the mound, one is worked upon for a time to the exclusion of the other. The one kind is often packed in tightly against the other, but with a very abrupt change in the character of the material.  A number of the more interesting and representative results of the weighing and analyses of burrow contents are presented herewith in tabular form. The data for each den, or lot, shows in grams the quantity of stored material removed and the best estimate it was possible to make of the percentages or weights of the various species. When the weight was less than 5 grams, the mere trace of the species frequently is indicated in the following tables by the abbreviation \"Tr.\"  TABLE 1.--_Analyses of plants stored by _Dipodomys spectabilis spectabilis_ Merriam, obtained from examination of representative dens (all except Den 24 from U.

Sporobolus cryptandrus strictus                                    5,455 Salsola pestifer                                                     295                                                                    -----       Total                                                        5,750  Two species represented. The heads of _Sporobolus cryptandrus strictus_ are retained to a great extent within the leaf sheaths. This necessitates the cutting of the stems into suitable lengths for carrying, and the stored material appears to be merely cut sections of the stems. Close examination, however, discloses the heads within, and shows that as in other instances seed storage is the end sought. These pieces are packed beautifully parallel like so many matches, and vary from a minimum length of 20 to a maximum of 37 millimeters, averaging about 30. Count of 2 grams of the above _Sporobolus_ material shows that there are 125 separate cut sections per gram, or a total of approximately 680,000 pieces in this one lot of storage, indicating a remarkable activity on the part of the individual rat (Pl. VIII, Fig. 1).   [Illustration: PLATE VII. FIG. 1.--DEN EXCAVATED ON RANGE RESERVE.  Vertical section through Den No. 1, of Table 1 (p. 20), showing the complex system of burrows, some of them plugged with closely packed storage (outlined in white), the depth of the den, and the widened chambers centrally located.]  [Illustration: PLATE VII. FIG. 2.--CONTENT OF EXCAVATED DEN.  Storage content of Den No. 1 (Fig. 1, above), showing the separate species of plants listed in Table 1. The rod is 1 meter long. The large pile on the left is composed of seed-laden heads of crowfoot grama (_Bouteloua rothrockii_), the large pile on the right consists of heads of six-weeks grama (_Bouteloua aristidoides_), the pile of heads in the center is desert plantain (_Plantago ignota_), and the smallest heap is composed of buckwheat-bush seeds (_Eriogonum polycladon_).]   The number of lots of storage (24) studied in detail, extending as it does over a period of three years with seasons of varying growth conditions, is not sufficient to permit the construction of a curve showing increase and decrease in quantity of stored material with growing seasons and intervals between; but the results indicate a very decided increase during the autumn storing season, and continuing large well into the winter, since some outside material can still be obtained until midwinter. From about February to April a decrease may be noted, followed, if the"]]]
