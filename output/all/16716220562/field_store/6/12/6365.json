Printed and published by special command. London, Printed by Henry Hills, Printer to the Army, dwelling in Aldersgate Street next door to the Peacock. 1659\". Three days afterwards, on October 27, John Evelyn had finished writing an answer, which was published a week later, on November 4, under the title: \"An Apologie for the Royal Party ... With a Touch At the pretended Plea for the Army. Anno Dom. MDCLIX\". No author's name, printer or place was given. Evelyn afterwards made the note in his Diary under the date November 7, 1659, that is, three days after the actual publication: \"Was publish'd my bold Apologie for the King in His time of danger, when it was capital to speak or write in favour of him. It was twice printed, so universaly it took.\"[1] Evelyn was by conviction an ardent royalist, but by temperament he was peaceable, and the publication of this pamphlet was a courageous act on his part, involving considerable risks.  The _Apologie for the Royal Party_ contains an eloquent and outspoken attack upon the parliamentary party, the depth of the author's feelings making his style of writing more effective than it usually was.  Events were at this date nearing their climax, and Evelyn, soon after the publication of his pamphlet, made persistent attempts to induce Colonel Henry Morley, then Lieutenant of the Tower of London, to declare for the King. In the edition of Baker's _Chronicle of the Kings of England_, edited by Edward Phillips, 1665, is given the following account of the negotiations (p. 736): \"Mr. Evelyn gave him [Col. Morley] some visits to attemper his affection by degrees to a confidence in him, & then by consequence to ingage him in his designes; and to induce him the more powerfully thereunto, he put into his hands an excellent and unanswerable hardy treatise by him written and severall times reprinted, intituled _An Apology for the Royall Party_, which he backed with so good Argument and dextrous Addresses in the prosecution of them, that, after some private discourse, the Colonel was so well inclin'd, as to recommend to him the procurement of his Majestie's Grace for him, his Brother-in-law Mr. Fagg, and one or two more of his Relations\". Phillips added an account of a letter written by Evelyn to Colonel Morley, and gave him great credit for the influence which he exerted, though Evelyn endorsed a draft of the narrative with a statement saying there \"was too much said concerning me\". Nevertheless part of the narrative was confirmed by Evelyn when he wrote on the title-page of the copy of the pamphlet here reproduced: \"Delivered to Coll. Morley a few daies after his contest w^th Lambert in the palace yard by J. Evelyn\". The \"contest\" with General Lambert took place on October 12 or 13 when Morley, pistol in hand, refused to allow him at the head of his troops to pass through the Palace Yard.  Evelyn also wrote on the title-page of this copy of his pamphlet \"three tymes printed\". In fact there were four printings, all described in the writer's _John Evelyn, a Study in Bibliophily & a Bibliography of his Writings_, New York, The Grolier Club, 1937, the one here reproduced being the fourth and final form. Nevertheless all four issues are now extremely scarce, the first printing being known in three copies (one in the United States), the second in seven (two in the United States), the third in one, and the fourth in one. This apparently unique relic of Evelyn's bold gesture on behalf of his King is in the writer's possession and is still as issued, edges untrimmed and with its eight leaves stitched in a contemporary paper wrapper. It has been reprinted only in Evelyn's _Miscellaneous Writings_, 1825, pp. 169-192.         *       *       *       *       *  When Charles II actually returned to England in 1660 Evelyn's feelings were deeply stirred. He had played some part in the restoration of the monarchy, and, with his literary instinct, naturally felt impelled to be among those who wished to present the King with an address on the day of his Coronation. This took place on April 23, 1661, and on the following day Evelyn recorded in his Diary: \"I presented his Ma^tie with his Panegyric in the Private Chamber, which he was pleas'd to accept most graciously: I gave copies to the Lord Chancellor and most of the noblemen who came to me for it.\"[2] Evelyn's _Panegyric_ was thus distributed privately and no doubt in small number, so that it is today extremely uncommon, being known only in five copies, not more than one of which is in the United States of America. Evelyn possessed a copy in 1687 according to his library catalogue compiled in that year, and a copy (not necessarily the same one) is now among his books in the library of Christ Church, Oxford, but it seems to have been unknown in 1825 and was not included in the _Miscellaneous Writings_. William Upcott, the editor, in fact erroneously identified the _Panegyric_ with the anonymous piece in folio: \"A Poem upon his Majesties Coronation ... Being S^t Georges day ... London, Printed for Gabriel Bedel and Thomas Collins ... 1661\". This mistake was not put right until a copy of the true _Panegyric_ with Evelyn's name on the title-page was acquired for the British Museum in 1927 from the Britwell Court Library. The copy here reproduced is in the writer's collection, and has a few corrections in Evelyn's hand: (a) _XXXIII. of April_, on title-page corrected to _XXIII_; (b) p.6. l.18 _Family_ altered to _Firmament_; (c) p.8. l.16 from bottom _suffer_ altered to _surfeit_.  When the _Panegyric_ was identified it was realised that it was not a poem, but an eloquent and extravagant composition in prose, in which Evelyn invested Charles II with every conceivable virtue and all wisdom. This was no doubt written with sincere enthusiasm, though Evelyn suffered a profound disillusionment in later years; and if he ever read his effusion again it must have caused him some distress. The _Panegyric_ is now reprinted for the first time.  Geoffrey Keynes   FOOTNOTES:  [1] Evelyn's _Diary_, ed. Wheatley, vol. II, p. 108.  [2] Evelyn's _Diary_, ed. Wheatley, vol. II, p. 130.

For if as the Apostle affirms, _For a good man, some would even dare to dy_, why should my Charity be prejudged, if hoping to convert you from the errour of your way, I despair not of rendring you the Person for whose preservation there will be nothing too dear for me to expose?  I might with reason beleeve that the first election of the Party wherein you stood engaged, proceeded from inexperience and the mistake of your zeal; not to say from your compliance to the passions of others; because I both"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17833"],["title","An Apologie for the Royal Party (1659); and A Panegyric to Charles the Second (#1)"],["body","your education, and how obsequious you have alwayes shewed your self to those who had then the direction of you: But, when after the example of their conversion, upon discovery of the Impostures which perverted them; and the signal indignation of God, upon the several periods which your eyes have lately beheld, of the bloudiest Tyrannies, and most prodigious oppressors that ever any age of the world produc'd, I see you still persist in your course, and that you have turn'd about with every revolution which has hapned: when I consider, what contradictions you have swallowed, how deeply you have ingaged, how servilely you have flatter'd, and the base and mean submissions by which you have dishonour'd your self, and stained your noble Family; not to mention the least refinement of your religion or morality (besides that you have still preserved a civility for me, who am ready to acknowledge it, and never merited other from you) I say, when I seriously reflect upon all this; I cannot but suspect the integrity of your procedure, deplore the sadness of your condition, and resolve to attempt the discovery of it to you; by all the instances, which an affection perfectly touch't with a zeal for your eternall interest can produce. And who can tell, but it may please Almighty God, to affect _you_ yet by a weak instrument, who have resisted so many powerfull indications of his displeasure at your proceedings, by the event of things?  For, since you are apt to recriminate, and after you have boasted of the prosperity or your cause, and the thriving of your Wickedness (an Argument farr better becoming a _Mahumetan_ then a _Christian_) let us state the matter a little, and compare particulars together; let us go back to the source, and search the very principles; and then see, if ever any cause had like success indeed; and whether it be a just reproach to your Enemies, that the judgments of God have begun with them, whilst you know not yet, where they may determine.  First then, be pleased to look North-wards upon your Brethren the Scots, who (being first instigated by that crafty _Cardinal_ [SN: Richlieu] to disturb the groth of the incomparable _Church of England_, and so consequently the tranquility of a Nation, whose expedition at the Isle of _Ree_, gave terrour to the French) made Reformation their pretence, to gratifie their own avarice, introduce themselves, and a more then _Babylonish_ Tyranny, imposing upon the Church and state, beyond all impudence or example. _I_ say, look upon what they have gotten, by deceiving their Brethren, selling their King, betraying his Son, and by all their perfidie; but a slavery more then _Egyptian_, and an infamy as unparallel'd, as their treason and ingratitude.  Look neerer home on those whom they had ingaged amongst us here, & tell me if there be a Person of them left, that can shew me his prize, unless it be that of his Sacriledg, which he, or his Nephews must certainly vomite up again: What is become of this ignorant and furious zeal, this pretence of an universall perfection in the Religious and the Secular, after all that Blood and Treasure, Rapine and Injustice, which has been exhausted, and perpetrated by these Sons of Thunder? Where is the King, whom they swear to make so glorious, but meant it in his _Martyrdome_? Where is the Classis, and the Assembly, the Lay-elder; all that geare of Scottish discipline, and the fine new Trinkets of Reformation? Were not all these taken out of their hand, while now they were in the height of their pride and triumph? And their dull Generall made to serve the execution of their Sovereign, and then to be turn'd off himself, as a property no more of use to their designes? Their riches and their strength in which they trusted, and the Parliament which they even idoliz'd, in sum, the prey they had contended for at the expence of so much sin and damnation, seizd upon by those very instruments, which they had rais'd to serve their insatiable avarice, and prodigious disloyalty. For so it pleased God to chastise their implacable persecution of an excellent Prince, with a slavery under such a _Tyrant_, as not being contented to butcher even some upon the Scaffold, sold divers of them for slaves, and others he exild into cruell banishment, without pretence of Law, or the least commiseration; that those who before had no mercy on others, might find none themselves; till upon some hope of their repentance, and future moderation, it pleased God to put his hook into the nostrills of that proud _Leviathan_, and send him to his place, after he had thus mortified the fury of the Presbyterians. For unlesse God himself should utter his voice from Heaven, _yea, and that a mighty voice_, can there any thing in the world be more evident, then his indignation at those wretches and barefac't Impostors, who, one after another, usurped upon us, taking them off at the very point of aspiring, and præcipitating the glory and ambition of these men, before those that were, but now, their adorers, and that had prostituted their consciences to serve their lusts? To call him the _Moses_, the _Man of God_, the _Joshua_, the _Saviour_ of _Israel_; and after all this, to treat the _Thing_ his son with addresses no lesse then blasphemous, whose Father (as themselves confess to be the most infamous Hypocrite and profligate Atheist of all the Usurpers that ever any age produc'd) had made them his Vassalls, and would have intaild them so to his posterity for ever?  But behold the scean is again changed, not by the Royall party, the Common Enemy, or a forreign power; but by the despicable _Rumpe_ of a Parliament, which that _Mountebanke_ had formerly serv'd himself of, and had rais'd him to that pitch, and investiture: But see withall, how soon these triflers and puppets of policy are blown away, with all their pack of modells and childish _Chimæras_, nothing remaining of them but their Coffine, guarded by the Souldiers at Westminster; but which is yet lesse empty then the heads of those Polititians, which so lately seemed to fill it.  For the rest, I despise to blot paper with a recitall of those wretched _Interludes, Farces and Fantasms_, which appear'd in the severall intervalls; because they were nothing but the effects of an extream gyddiness, and unparallel'd levity. Yet these are those various despensations and providences in your journey to that _holy land_ of purchases and profits, to which you have from time to time appeal'd for the justification of your proceedings, whilst they were, indeed, no other then the manifest judgments of God upon your rebellion and your ambition: I say nothing of your hypocriticall fasts, and pretended humiliations, previous to the succeeding plots, and supposititious Revelations, that _the godly might fall into the hands of your Captains_, because they were bugbears, and became ridiculous even to the common people.  And now _Sr._ if you please, let us begin to set down the product and survey the successe of your party and after all these faces and vertigo's tell me ingenuously, if the single chastisment which is fallen upon one afflicted man, and his loyall subjects, distressed by the common event of war, want of treasure, the seizure of his Fleet, forcing him from his City, and all the disadvantages that a perfidious people could imagine; but in fine the crowning him with a glorious _Martyrdome_ for the Church of God and the liberty of his people (for which his blood doth yet cry aloud for vengeance) be comparable to the confusion which you (that have been the conquerours) have suffered, and the slavery which you are like to leave to the posterities which will be born but to curse you, and to groan under the pressures which you bequeath to your own flesh & blood? For to what a condition you have already reduced this once flourishing kingdom, since all has been your own, let the intolerable oppressions, taxes, Excises, sequestrations confiscations, plunders, customes, decimations, not to mention the plate, even to very thimbles and the bodkins (for even to these did your avarice descend) and other booties, speak. All this dissipated and squandred away, to gratifie a few covetous and ambitious wretches, whose appetites are as deep as hell, and as insatiable as the grave; as if (as the Wise-man speaks) _our time here were but a market for gain_.  Look then into the Churches, and manners of the people, even amongst your own _Saints_, and tell me, if since _Simon Magus_ was upon the earth, there were ever heard of so many _Schismes_, and _Heresies_, of _Jewes_ and _Socinians_, _Quakers_, _Fifth-monarchy-men_, _Arians_, _Anabaptists_, _Independents_, and a thousand severall forts of _Blasphemies_ and professed _Atheists_, all of them spawned under your government; and then tell me what a Reformation of Religion you have effected?  Was there ever in the whole Earth (not to mention Christendom alone) a perjury so prodigious, and yet so avowed as that by which you have taken away the estate of my L. _Craven_, at which the very _Infidels_ would blush, a _Turke_ or _Sythian_ stand amaz'd?  Under the Sun was it never heard, that a man should be condemned for transgressing no law, but that which was made after the fact, and abrogated after execution; that the Posterities to come might not be witnesses of your horrid injustice: Yet thus you proceeded against my _L. Stafford_. How many are those gallant persons whom after articles of war, you have butchered in cold-blood, violating your promises against the Lawes of all Nations, civill or barbarous; and yet thus you dealt in the case of my L. _Capel_, Sr. _J. Stawel_ and others.  Is not the whole nation become sullen and proud, ignorant and suspicious, incharitable, curst, and in fine, the most depraved and perfidious under heaven? And whence does all this proceed, but from the effects of your own examples, and the impunity of evill doers?  I need not tell you how long Justice has been sold by the"]]]
