RIZER    Smithsonian Institution,       Bureau of Ethnology,           Washington, _November 24, 1891_.    Honorable J. W. Powell,       _Director of the Bureau of Ethnology_.    Sir: Complying with your order directing me to proceed to Florence,   Arizona, to witness the closing up of the work under contract for   the preservation of Casa Grande ruin near that place, and to report   to you the amount and character of the work accomplished, certifying   the amount due the contractors under each item, I have the honor to   submit the following report:    I visited the ruin first on October 20, and found the work well   advanced. Steady progress was made from said date until October 31,   the limitation expressed in the contract for prosecuting it.    In order to ascertain the exact location of Casa Grande ruin and to   aid me in the determination of the amount of work performed by the   contractors, I employed Mr Albert T. Colton, a civil engineer and   the official surveyor of Pinal county, Arizona, within the limits of   which the ruin stands. From actual measurements made by Mr Colton,   based upon official notes in his custody, he informed me the ruin   was located in the northeast corner of the northwest quarter of the   southwest quarter of section 16 of township 5 south, range 8 east. A   congressional township plat on which Mr Colton has marked the exact   location of the ruin is filed herewith, marked Exhibit A, and made a   part of this report [plate CXXV].    On October 29 Mr Colton at my instance took measurements of the   brickwork in underpinning and filling in cavities in the walls and   of the excavation done by the contractors. His estimate, based upon   these measurements, was submitted to me in writing. It is filed   herewith, marked Exhibit B, and is made a part of this report.    I find from these measurements that the contractors excavated and   removed to a point 100 yards from the ruin 570 cubic yards of   débris, 271 cubic yards of which were removed from the interior and   299 cubic yards from the exterior walls of the building, within an   area of 10 feet of said walls.    I also find the amount of underpinning done by the contractors to be   919 cubic feet, and the amount of filling in openings to be 1,161   cubic feet. The underpinning is done with hard-burned brick laid in   good cement mortar extending to a depth of 12 inches below the   original ground level. The face of the brickwork is set back from 1   to 2 inches from the face of the wall and plastered with a coat of   good cement mortar, making it flush with the outer wall.    In filling in cavities more than 500 lineal feet of 2 by 4 inch   squared lumber was used to replace broken-out lintels and laid side   by side across nearly the whole thickness of the walls, with not   more than 1 inch space between the boards. They occupy the same   horizontal planes as the original lintels, and the walls are trimmed   to afford solid resting places for them. The openings above the   lintels have been filled in the same manner as the underpinning,   with hard-burned brick set back 1 inch from the wall surfaces and   plastered with a coating of cement mortar, bringing it out flush   with the original wall.    I further find that the contractors have placed one wooden brace and   two iron braces as designated in the specifications. The wooden   brace is constructed of two pieces of good, clear, squared lumber 6   by 8 inches in cross section, well bolted together, secured by   plates of boiler iron three-eighths of an inch thick and 14 by 18   inches square. The specifications provide for this brace to run from   the south side of the south wall through the center room with a   plate on each side of the south wall and one on each side of the   wall on the north side of the center room. The contractors have   deviated from these requirements in having extended the said brace   through the entire length of the building and placed the plates that   were specified for the north wall of the center room on the   respective sides of the extreme north wall of the building. While   this deviation adds nothing to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17488"],["title","The Repair of Casa Grande Ruin, Arizona, in 1891 (#6)"],["body","of the south wall, it is   doubtless as effective as it would have been had it been placed as   contemplated in the plan. It may in some degree strengthen the north   wall, and I recommend that it be accepted as in compliance with the   terms of the contract. The two iron rods called for in the   specifications are of wrought iron 1½ inches in diameter, secured by   boiler-iron plates three-eighths of an inch thick and 12 inches in   diameter, securely fastened as required in the specifications. There   was a necessary deviation from the plan as to the place the rod   nearest the east side of the building should be placed. Early in the   prosecution of the work a portion of the debris in contact with the   eastern wall was removed. During the night following this a section   of the south end of the east wall fell, carrying with it that   portion of the wall between the south and east rooms to which the   plan required said rod to be attached. In consequence the   contractors placed the rod so as to connect it with the portion of   the wall still intact. As a brace to the south wall it is placed   advantageously. In excavation, underpinning, and filling in the   contractors have exceeded the limitations prescribed in the   contract, and have therefore performed an amount of work for the   remuneration of which there is no provision. The following table   shows the amount of work authorized in each of the four items with   reference to which the contract was drawn and the amount actually   performed by contractors:   Item                 |1. Excavating and clearing out débris.                       |           |2. Underpinning walls.                       |           |           |3.

They are fully advised that there is no provision for the   payment of this excess. The requirements of the contract are, in my   opinion, fully met in the quality of material used and the work   performed.    The preservation of the ruin is incomplete. There are six places   where lintels have disappeared and not been replaced and a   corresponding number of cavities that should be filled. Deep seams   have been cut in the walls by the action of the elements, and unless   far greater provision is made for its protection the work already   done will be of small avail.    At many places where the débris came in contact with the wall   disintegration seems to have resulted. At a slight touch it   frequently crumbles. Owing to this fact two sections of the wall   fell during the progress of the work when the debris was   removed--one from the east wall, described above, and one from the   south wall near the west extremity. These breaches maybe observed as   shown in two of the six accompanying photographs [plates CXX, CXXI].   These photographs were taken ten days before the work was completed.   There being no professional photographer in that vicinity I was   compelled to take advantage of the kind offer of Mr H. H. Burrell,   an amateur photographer, who happened to be there at that time. Thus   the views I secured failed to show all the brickwork done. The   coating of mortar was not applied until after the date on which the   views were taken, in consequence of which the bare bricks are shown   in the views.    During the progress of work in removing the debris a number of   articles of interest to the ethnologist were found at various depths   and localities. They have been packed by the contractors and will be   sent to the National Museum.    The floors in the center, north, and east rooms were found to be   about 8 feet above the ground surface. The material was similar to   that of which the walls are composed. The west and south rooms   appeared to have had floors at one time on the same level, but the   surfaces had disintegrated, and there was a mass of loose earth,   which was removed to a depth of 6.9 feet below the floors of the   other three rooms, where another floor was found slightly less firm   than those.    Reverend Isaac T. Whittemore, who has been designated by the   honorable the Secretary of the Interior as the custodian of the   ruin, rendered me valuable assistance in the performance of my   mission. He has manifested a zealous concern for the preservation of   the ruin and has given time and labor to that end. There is no   provision for his just compensation. I therefore recommend that if   any funds be found available after the payment of the amount due the   contractors the same be ordered paid to Mr Whittemore for his   services.        Very respectfully,           H. C. Rizer, _Chief Clerk_.     SUPPLEMENT   CORRESPONDENCE AND REPORT RELATING TO THE CONDITION OF CASA GRANDE IN 1895, WITH RECOMMENDATIONS CONCERNING ITS FURTHER PROTECTION  I. _Letter of Reverend Isaac T. Whittemore, custodian of Casa Grande, to the Secretary of the Interior, recommending an appropriation for further protecting the ruin_    Florence, Arizona,       _July 25, 1895_.   Honorable Hoke Smith,       _Secretary of the Interior_.    Dear Sir: It is with great hesitancy that I write to add to the   burdens of one so busy and burdened as I presume you to be. But it   is not for myself but for others that I write, and will try to be   laconic.    Can you embody in your next report to Congress an appeal for an   appropriation of $7,000 or $8,00[0] to roof the Casa Grande ruin, to   fence 40 acres, and make excavations of all the mounds in the   vicinity for the purpose of learning the history of the wonderful   people who once lived here and erected the buildings and built   canals?       *   *   *   *   *   Very sincerely, yours,       Isaac T.

III. _Letter of the Acting Director of the Bureau of American Ethnology to the Secretary of the Interior suggesting an examination of Casa Grande with a view of its further protection_    Smithsonian Institution,       Bureau of American Ethnology,           _Washington, August 28, 1895_.    Sir: Your request of August 7 for a report concerning a   recommendation by Reverend Isaac T. Whittemore, under date of July   25, that provision be made for further protecting Casa Grande ruin,   near Florence, Arizona, by the erection of a suitable roof, has been   under consideration.    In many respects Casa Grande ruin is one of the most noteworthy   relics of a prehistoric age and people remaining within the limits   of the United States. It was discovered, already in a ruinous   condition, by Padre Kino in 1694, and since that time it has been a   subject of record by explorers and historians. Thus its history is   exceptionally extended and complete. By reason of its early   discovery and its condition when first seen by white men, it is   known that Casa Grande is a strictly aboriginal structure; and   archeologic researches in this country and Mexico afford grounds for   considering it a typical structure for its times and for the natives   of the southwestern region. Many other structures were mentioned or   described by the Spanish explorers, but the impressions of these   explorers were tinctured by previous experience in an inhospitable   region, and their descriptions were tinged by the romantic ideas of   the age; very few of these structures were within the limits of the   United States, and nearly all of these situated in the neighboring   republic of Mexico disappeared long ago; there is hardly a structure   left, except Casa Grande ruin, by which the"]]]
