She pushed away her untouched supper, hurriedly drank a glass of wine, and, crossing the hall to her bedroom, opened a tiny box that stood locked upon her dressing table. She took from it a picture--a miniature. It was of a young man not over twenty-five. The face was strong and full of virile suggestion, even in a picture. The eyes were brown, the lips under the short mustache were firm, and the thick, short, brown hair fell forward a bit over the left temple. It was a handsome manly face.  The picture was dated eighteen years before. It hardly seemed possible that eighteen years earlier this woman could have been old enough to stir the passionate love of such a man. Her face was still young, her form still slender; her abundant hair shaded deep gray eyes where the spirit of youth still shone. But she belonged, by temperament and profession, to that race of women who guard their youth marvellously.  There were no tears in her eyes as she sat long into the morning, and, with his pictured face before her, reflected until she had decided.  He had kept his word to her. His \"good bye\" had been loyally said. She would keep hers in turn, and guard his first night's solitude in the tomb with her watchful prayers. She calculated well the time. If she travelled all day Sunday, she would be there sometime before midnight. If she travelled back at once, she could be in town again in season to play Monday; not in the best of conditions, to be sure, for so hard a r√¥le as \"Juliet,\" but she would have fulfilled a duty that would never come to her again.         *       *       *       *       *  It was near midnight, on Sunday.  The light of the big round harvest moon fell through the warm air, which scarcely moved above the graves of the almost forgotten dead in the country churchyard. The low headstones cast long shadows over the long grass that merely trembled as the noiseless wind moved over it.  A tall woman in a riding dress stood beside the rough sexton at the door of the only large tomb in the enclosure.  He had grown into a bent old man since she last saw him, but he had recognized her, and had not hesitated to obey her.  As he unlocked and pushed back the great door which moved easily and noiselessly, he placed his lantern on the steps, and telling her that, according to a family custom, there were lights inside, he turned away, and left her, to keep his watch near by.  No need to tell her the family customs. She knew them but too well.  For a few moments she remained seated on the step where she had rested to await the opening of the door, on the threshold of the tomb of the one man among all the men she had met who had stirred in her heart a great love. How she had loved him! How she had feared that her love would wear his out! How she had suffered when she decided that love was something more than self-gratification, that even though for her he should put aside the woman he had heedlessly married years before, there could never be any happiness in such a union for either of them. How many times in her own heart she had owned that the woman would not have had the courage shown by the girl, for the girl did not realize all she was putting aside. Yet the consciousness of his love, in which she never ceased to believe, had kept her brave and young.  She rose and slowly entered the vault.  The odor of flowers, the odor of death was about it.  She lifted the lantern from the ground, and, with it raised above her head, approached the open coffin that rested on the catafalque in the centre of the tomb and mounted the two steps. She was conscious of no fear, of no dread at the idea of once more, after eighteen years, looking into the face of the man she had loved, who had carried a great love for her into another world. But as she looked, her eyes widened with fright. She bent lower over him. No cry burst from her lips, but the hand holding the lantern lowered slowly, and she tumbled down the two steps, and staggered back against the wall, where, behind lettered slides, the dead Richmonds for six generations slept their long sleep together. Her breast heaved up and down, as if life, like a caged thing, were striving to escape. Yet no sound came from her colorless lips, no tears were in her widened eyes.  The realizing sense of departed years had reached her heart at last, and the shock was terrible. With a violent effort she recovered herself. But the firm step, the fearless, hopeful face with which she had approached the coffin of her dead lover were very different from the blind manner in which she stumbled back to his bier, and the hand which a second time raised the lantern trembled so that its wavering light shed an added weirdness on the still face, so strange to her eyes, and stranger still to her heart.  He had been a young man when they parted. To her he had remained young. Now the hair about the brows was thin and white, the drooping mustache that entirely concealed the mouth was grizzled; lines furrowed the forehead, outlined the sunken eyes, and gave an added thinness to the nostrils. She bent once more over the face, to her only a strange cold mask. A painful fascination held her for several minutes, forcing her to mark how love, that had kept her young, proud, content in its very existence, had sapped his life, and doubled his years.  The realization bent her slender figure under a load of self-reproach and self-mistrust. She drooped lower and lower above the sad, dead face until she slid to the ground beside him. Heavy tearless sobs shook her slight frame as it stretched its length beside the dead love and the dead dream. The ideal so long treasured in her soul had lost its reality. The present had wiped out the past as a sponge wipes off a slate.  If she had but heeded his warning, and refrained from coming until later, she would have escaped making a stranger of him forever. Now the sad, aged face, the dead, strange face which she had seen but five minutes before, had completely obscured in her memory the long-loved, young face that had been with her all these years. The spirit whose consoling presence she had thought to feel upholding her at this moment made no sign. She was alone in the world, bereft of her one supporting ideal, alone beside the dead body of one who was a stranger alike to her sight and her emotions; alone at night in an isolation as unexpected as it was terrible to her, and which chilled her senses as if it had come to oppress her forever.  The shadows which she had not noticed before, the dark corners of the tomb, the motionless gleam of the moon as it fell through the open door, and laid silently on the floor like light stretched dead, the low rustle of the wind as if Nature restlessly moved in her sleep, came suddenly upon her, and brought her--fear. She held her breath as she stilled her sobs to realize that she alone lived in this city of the Dead. The chill of fright crept along the surface of her body, which still vibrated with her storm of grief.  She seemed paralyzed. She dared not move.  Every sense rallied to her ears in dread.  Suddenly she heard her name breathed: \"Margaret!\"  It was whispered in a voice once so familiar to her ears, a voice that used to say, \"Madge.\"  She raised herself on her elbow.  She dared not answer.  She hardly dared breathe.  She was afraid in every sense, and yet she hungered for another sound of that loved voice. Every hour of its banishment was regretted at that moment. There seemed no future without it.  Every nerve listened.  At first she heard nothing but the restless moving of the air, which merely emphasized her loneliness, then she caught the pulsation of slow regular breathing.  She started to her feet.  She snatched up the lantern and quickly mounted to the bier. She looked sharply down into the dead face.  Silent, with its white hair, and worn lines, it rested on its white pillows.  No sound came from the cold still lips.  Yet, while her eyes were riveted on them, once more the longed-for voice breathed her name. \"Margaret!\"  It came from behind her.  She turned quickly.  There in the moonlit doorway, with a sad, compassionate smile on his strong, young face--as if it were yesterday they had parted--stood the man she remembered so well.  Her bewildered eyes turned from the silent, unfamiliar face among the satin cushions, to the living face in the moonlight,--the young, brown eyes, the short, brown hair falling forward over the left temple, the erect, elastic figure, the strong loving hands stretching out to her.  She was so tired, so heart sick, so full of longing for the love she had lost.  \"Felix,\" she sobbed, and, blindly groping to reach what she feared was a hallucination, she stumbled down the steps, and was caught up in the arms flung wide to catch her, and which folded about her as if forever. She sighed his name again, upon the passionate young lips which had inherited the great love she had put aside so long before.         *       *       *       *       *  As the last words died away, the Critic drew himself up and laughed.  He had told the story very dramatically, reading the letter from the envelope he had called a \"property,\" and he had told it well.  The laugh broke the spell, and the Doctor echoed it heartily.  \"All right, old man,\" said the Critic, \"you owed me that laugh. You're welcome.\"  \"I was only thinking,\" said the Doctor, his face still on a broad grin, \"that we have always thought you ought to have been a novelist, and now we know at last just what kind of a novelist you would have been.\"  \"Don't you believe it,\" said the Critic, \"That was only improvisatore--that's no sample.\"  \"Ho, ho! I'll bet you anything that the manuscript is up in your trunk, and that you have been committing it to memory ever since this idea was proposed,\" said the Doctor, still laughing.  \"No, _that_ I deny,\" replied the Critic, \"but as I am no _poseur_, I will own that I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18004"],["title","Told in a French Garden (#8)"],["body","it years ago, and rewrote it so often that I never could forget it. I'll confess more than that, the story has been 'declined with thanks' by every decent magazine in the States and in England. Now perhaps some one will tell me why.\"  \"I don't know the answer,\" said the Youngster, seriously, \"unless it is 'why not?'\"  \"I shouldn't wonder if it were sentimental twaddle,\" sighed the Journalist, \"but I don't _know_.\"  \"I noticed,\" expostulated the Critic, \"that you all listened, enthralled.\"  \"Oh,\" replied the Doctor, \"that was a tribute to your personal charm. You did it very well.\"  \"Exactly,\" said the Critic, \"if editors would let me read them my stories, I could sell them like hot cakes. I never believed that Homer would have lived as long as he has, if he had not made the reputation of his tales by singing them centuries before any one tried to read them. Now no one _dares_ to say they bore him. The reading public, and the editors who cater to it, are just like some stupid theatrical managers I know of, who will never let an author read a play to them for fear that he may give the play some charm that the fool theatrical man might not have felt from mere type-written words on white or yellow paper. By Jove, I know the case of a manager who once bought the option on a foreign play from a scenario provided by a clever friend of mine--and paid a stiff price for it, too, and when he got the manuscript wrote to the chap who did the scenario--'Play dashety-dashed rot. If it had been as good as your scenario, it would have gone.' And, what is more, he sacrificed the tidy five thousand he had paid, and let his option slide. Now, when the fellow who did the scenario wrote: 'If you found anything in the scenario that you did not discover in the play, it is because I gave you the effect it would have behind the footlights, which you have not the imagination to see in the printed words,' the Manager only replied 'You are a nice chap. I like you very much, but you are a blanketty-blanketty fool.'\"  \"Which was right?\" asked the Journalist.  \"The scenario man.\"  \"How do you know?\"  \"How do I know? Why simply because the play was produced later--ran five years, and drew a couple of million dollars. That's how I know.\"  \"By cricky,\" exclaimed the Youngster, \"I believe he thinks his story could earn a million if it had a chance.\"  \"I don't say 'no,'\" said the Critic, yawning, \"but it will never get a chance. I burned the manuscript this morning, and now being delivered of it, I have no more interest in it than a sparrow has in her last year's offspring.\"  \"The trouble with you is that you haven't any patience, any staying power. That ought to have been a three volume novel. We would have heard all about their first meeting, their first love, their separation, his marriage, her _d√©buts_, etc., etc.,\" declared the Journalist.  \"Oh, thunder,\" said the Doctor. \"I think there was quite enough of it. Don't throw anything at me--I liked it--I liked it! Only I'm sorry she died.\"  \"So am I,\" said the Critic. \"That really hurt me.\"  \"Because,\" said the Doctor, shying away toward the door, \"I should have liked to know if the child turned out to be a genius. That kind do sometimes,\" and he disappeared into the doorway.  \"Anyhow,\" said the Critic, \"I am going to wear laurels until some one tells a better--and I'd like to know why the Journalist looks so pensively thoughtful?\"  \"I am trying to recall who she was--Margaret Dillon.\"  \"Don't fret--she may be a 'poor thing,' but she is all 'mine own'--a genuine creation, Mr. Journalist. I am no reporter.\"  \"Ah? Then you are more of a sentimentalist than I even dared to dream.\"  \"Don't deny it,\" said the Critic, as he rose and yawned. \"So I am going to bed to sleep on my laurels while I may. Good night.\"  \"Well,\" called the Sculptor after him, as he sauntered away, \"as one of our mutual friends used to say 'The Indian Summer of Passion scorches.'\"  \"But, alas!\" added the other, \"it does not _always_ kill.\"  \"Witness--\" began the Journalist, but the Critic cut him short.  \"As you love me--not that famous list of yours including so many of the actresses we all know. I can't bear THAT to-night. After all the French have a better phrase for it--'La Crise de quarante ans.'\"  The Nurse and Divorc√©e had been very quiet, but here they locked hands, and the former remarked that they prepared to withdraw:  \"That is our cue to disappear--and you, too, Youngster. These men are far too wise.\"  So we of the discussed sex made a circle with our clasped hand about the Youngster and danced him into the house. The last I saw of the garden that night, as I looked out of my window toward the northeast, with \"Namur\" beating in my head, the five men had their heads still together, but whether \"the other sex\" was getting scientifically torn to bits, or they, too, had Namur in their minds I never knew.     IV  THE DOCTOR'S STORY  AS ONE DREAMS  THE TALE OF AN ADOLESCENT   The next day was very peaceful. We were becoming habituated to the situation. It was a Sunday, and the weather was warm. There had been no real news so far as we knew, except that Japan had lined up with the Allies. The Youngster had come near to striking fire by wondering how the United States, with her dislike for Japan, would view the entering into line of the yellow man, but the spark flickered out, and I imagine we settled down for the story with more eagerness than on the previous evening, especially when the Doctor thrust his hands into his pockets and lifted his chin into the air, as if he were in the tribune. More than one of us smiled at his resemblance to Pierre Janet entering the tribune at the _Coll√®ge de France_, and the Youngster said, under his breath, \"A _Clinique_, I suppose.\"  The Doctor's ears were sharp. \"Not a bit,\" he answered, running his keen brown eyes over us to be sure we were listening before he began:         *       *       *       *       *  In the days when it was thought that the South End was to be the smart part of Boston, and when streets were laid out along wide tree shaded malls, with a square in the centre, in imitation of some quarters of London,--for Boston was in those days much more English in appearance than it is now,--there was in one of those squares a famous private school. In those days it was rather smart to go to a private school. It was in the days before Boston had much of an immigrant quarter, when some smart families still lived in the old Colonial houses at the North End, and ministers and lawyers and all professional men sent their sons and their daughters to the public schools, at that time probably the best in the world.  At this private school, there was, at the time of which I speak, what one might almost call a \"principal girl.\"  She was the daughter of a rich banker--his only daughter. The gods all seemed to have been very good to her. She was not only a really beautiful girl, she was, for her age, a distinguished girl,--one of the sort who seemed to do everything better than any one else, and with a lack of self-consciousness or pretension. Every one admired her. Some of her comrades would have loved her if she had given them the chance. But no one could ever get intimate with her. She came and went from school quite alone, in the habit of the American girl of those days before the chaperon became the correct thing. She was charming to every one, but she kept every one a little at arm's length. Of course such a girl would be much talked over by the other type of girl to whom confidences were necessary.  As always happens in any school there was a popular teacher. She taught history and literature, and I imagine girls get more intimate with such a teacher than they ever do with the mathematics.  Also, as always happens, there was a \"teacher's pet,\" one of those girls that has to adore something, and the literature teacher, as she was smart and good looking, was as convenient to adore as anything else,--and more adjacent.  Of course \"teacher's pet\" never has any secrets from the teacher, and does not mean to be a sneak either. Just can't help turning herself inside out for her idol, and when the heart of a girl of seventeen turns itself inside out, almost always something comes out that is not her business. That was how it happened that one day the literature teacher was told that the \"Principal Girl\" was receiving wonderful boxes of violets at the school door, and \"Don't you know ONE DAY she was seen by a group of pupils who happened to be going home, and were just behind her, getting into a closed carriage and driving away from the corner of the street!\"  Now the literature teacher did not, as a rule, encourage such confidences, but this time it seemed useful. She liked the Principal Girl--admired her, in fact. She was terribly shocked. She warned her pet to talk to no one else, and then she went at once to the clergyman who was at the head of the school. She knew that he felt responsible for his pupils, and this had an unpleasant look. He took the pains to verify the two statements. Then there was but one thing to do--to lay the matter before the parents of the girl.  Now, as so often happens in American families, the banker and his wife stood in some awe of their daughter. There was not that confidence between them which one traditionally supposes to exist between parents and children. I imagine that there is no doubt that the adolescent finds it much easier to confide in some one other than the parents who would seem to be her proper confidants.  At any rate the banker and his wife were simply staggered. They dared not broach the subject to the Principal Girl, and in their distress turned to the family lawyer. As they were too cowardly to take his first advice--perhaps they were afraid the daughter would lie, they sometimes do in the best regulated families,--it was decided to put a discreet person \"on the job,\" and discover first of all what was really going on.
