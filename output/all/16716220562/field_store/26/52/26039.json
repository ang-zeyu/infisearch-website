The overdressed little midget was delighted with her appearance, and pranced around in front of the mirror admiring herself. Reginald too, considered himself very fine in his black velvet suit, with a great white collar and immense white silk tie.  Miss Morton accompanied the children, and the St. Clair carriage carried them away to the dancing class. When they arrived, all was bustle and excitement. About forty gaily dressed children were assembled in a large hall, prettily decorated with flags and flowers.  Patty was fond of dancing, and danced very gracefully in her slow, Southern way, but she was utterly unfamiliar with the mincing steps and elaborate contortions attempted by the Elmbridge young people. However, she enjoyed it all from its very novelty, and she was pleasantly impressed with some of the boys and girls to whom she was introduced.  But she was amazed and almost angry at the way her cousin talked about her.  \"Mabel,\" said Ethelyn, as she presented Patty to Mabel Miller, \"this is my cousin, Patricia Fairfield. She is from Richmond, Virginia, and is visiting us for the winter. Her father is a millionaire, and he has lots of great plantations of,--of magnolias.\"  \"Oh, no, Ethelyn,\" began Patty.  \"Well, sweet potatoes, then, or something,\" went on Ethelyn, nudging her cousin to keep still. \"You must excuse her dress, she couldn't get anything very nice in Virginia so mamma has gone to New York to-day to buy her some decent clothes.\"  Patty raged inwardly at this slighting and unjust remark about her native state, but she was a truly polite little girl and said nothing unkind in reply.  \"Do you like to dance?\" said Mabel Miller to Patty later, as they took places in a quadrille just forming.  \"Yes,\" said Patty, \"and I know these quadrilles, but I never saw fancy dances like those you have here.\"  \"Oh, they're the latest thing,\" replied Mabel. \"Professor Dodson comes from New York, and he teaches us the newest and swellest steps.\"  As that day was the last of the quarter the professor had arranged a little exhibition of his best pupils, and a good-sized audience was gathered in the galleries above the dancing floor to witness it.  But it was a surprise to all present when he announced that a friend whose name he was not privileged to mention, had offered a prize to the child who should dance most gracefully, either alone or with a partner.  \"You can't get it, Ethelyn,\" said Reginald, \"for you're as awkward as a lame elephant.\"  \"I am not,\" snapped Ethelyn, \"and you'd better not try for it, 'cause you'd only make a spectacle of yourself.\"  \"So would you,\" retorted Reginald, \"and then we'd be a pair of spectacles.\"  Ethelyn said no more, for the dances were beginning.  Some of the pupils danced very prettily, others affectedly, and others cleverly, but the dances were of a kicking, romping nature that required much practice and skill to perform gracefully.  After all had taken part, Professor Dodson turned politely to Patty, and invited her, if she would, to dance also.  \"Oh, I couldn't, thank you,\" she answered \"I don't know any of these flings. I only know an old-fashioned minuet.\"  \"Try that,\" urged Ethelyn, who delighted to have her cousin made conspicuous, as that attracted attention towards herself.  The professor insisted upon it, so Patty obligingly consented, and saying, \"I couldn't dance with these things jingling,\" she gave Ethelyn the heavy necklace and bangles.  Then she stepped out on the floor, and as the orchestra played the slow, stately music of the minuet, Patty bowed and swayed like a veritable old-time maiden. Graceful as a reed, she took the pretty steps, smiling and curtseying, her fair little face calm and unflushed.  It was such a pretty dance and such a contrast to the acrobatic, out-of-breath performances of the other dancers, that, without a dissenting voice, the committee of judges awarded the prize to Miss Patricia Fairfield.  Patty was delighted, for she had no idea that her dancing was specially meritorious and she accepted the gold medal with a few words of real gratitude, thinking the while how pleased her father would be, when she should write him all about it. On the way home she said to Ethelyn:  \"But it doesn't seem right for me to have this prize, as I'm not a member of the dancing class.\"  \"Oh bother,\" said Ethelyn, \"that doesn't matter; they're always giving out prizes, and I'm awfully glad you got this one. People will think you're something wonderful. And I'm sure they'd have given it to Belle Crandon if you hadn't danced, and mamma will be tickled to death to think you got it ahead of her.\"     CHAPTER VI   PURPLE AND FINE LINEN  When Mrs. St. Clair's purchases were sent home from New York and spread out on view, Patty could scarcely believe her own eyes.  Were all those fine clothes really meant for her?  The materials included silks, satins and velvets in bright colorings and somewhat conspicuous patterns.  Some of the dresses were already made up, and these were befrilled and beflounced, with lace and embroidery. As Patty had always worn delicate shades of material, and her dresses had been very simply made, she couldn't help protesting at all this bewildering array of finery. But her aunt said:  \"Nonsense, child, you don't know what you're talking about. You are the guest of the St. Clairs, and your appearance must do us credit. I am not giving you these things, you know; your father wrote me to buy for you whatever was necessary or desirable. I have a lot of new clothes for Ethelyn, too, and I want you to look as well as she does. While you are with us you must be suitably dressed, else I shall feel ashamed of your appearance.\"  Poor Patty began to wonder whether it was so very nice after all, to have fine clothes if she could have no voice in their selection.  But she thought, what is the use of objecting? Aunt Isabel will do as she pleases anyway, and while I'm staying with her, I ought to agree to what she wants.  Then two dressmakers came to stay a fortnight. Ethelyn and Patty were given a holiday from lessons, the schoolroom was turned into a sewing-room, and Miss Morton and Reginald betook themselves to the library.  Patty was rather sorry to miss her school hours, for the history lessons had become interesting, but she soon found that Aunt Isabel's word was law. It was a law often broken by her own children, but Patty was not of a mutinous heart, and she amiably obeyed Mrs. St. Clair's commands. But she had her own opinion of the household, and she did not hesitate to express it plainly in her letters to her father.  \"I begin to see,\" she wrote to him one day, \"what you meant when you explained to me about proportion. In this house, money, and fine clothes, and making a great show, are out of all proportion to everything else. They never think of reading books, or doing charity work, or anything but showing off. And if a thing costs a lot, it's all right, but if it's simple and not expensive, it's no good at all. I can tell you, Mr. Papa, that when we have our home, we'll have less fuss and feathers, and more comfort and common sense. And it isn't only that the things cost so much, but they're always talking about it, and telling how expensive they are. Why, Uncle Robert has told me half-a-dozen times how much his horses and carriages cost, and now he says he's going to get an automobile, so I don't know what he'll do with his horses. Ethelyn is very nice in some ways, but she is affected and rude, and I don't like her as well as Clara Hayden, if she _is_ my cousin. Reginald is a nice boy, but he's sort of pompous and conceited, and thinks he's better than any one else in the world. Little Florelle is a dear, but she cries so easily that I can't have much fun with her. But there, now I've told you all the bads, I'll tell you some of the goods. Miss Morton, the governess, is a lovely lady, and when Ethelyn is so cross I can't stand her, I go to Miss Morton, and we have a walk or a drive together, and have nice, pleasant talks. And then I am taking singing lessons twice a week. Aunt Isabel says I have a pretty good voice, and I love to sing, and Reginald takes me skating, and that is splendid. I don't know how yet, but he says I am learning pretty well. Aunt Isabel gave an afternoon tea for me, and next week we are going to have a big party, and I think that will be nice. I like parties and dancing-school, only the girls and boys all act so grown up. They are about my age and even younger, and they act as if they were ladies and gentlemen. That isn't good proportion, is it? But I am pretty happy, except that I am often homesick for you. Then I look at your picture, and at the beautiful picture of dear mamma and it helps some. And your letters help me too, so write just as often as you can, won't you?  \"From your loving daughter,  \"PATRICIA FAIRFIELD.\"  The party, as Patty had feared, was a very grown-up affair. For several days beforehand the servants were getting the house ready for it, and all was bustle and confusion.  The furniture and bric-a-brac were all removed from the hall and drawing-room and library, and carried up to the third floor to be out of the way. The porti√®res were taken down from the doorways, and on the day of the party they were replaced by simulated curtains of smilax and flowering vines.  As it was near the Christmas season, the decorations included evergreens, holly and mistletoe, but besides these, quantities of roses and rare flowers of all sorts were used. The florists came early and worked all day, and they transformed the house into a fairy bower.  Patty was delighted with this, and walked through the luxurious rooms, quite lost in admiration of their floral beauty.  Carpenters had enclosed the great veranda which was then hung with red satin and decorated with ropes and wreaths"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8456"],["title","Patty Fairfield (#6)"],["body"," holly, and, like the rest of the house, was fairly ablaze with electric lights.  The party was to be from eight to twelve, and when Patty went down stairs at a little before eight, she found her uncle berating the musicians, who were a little late in arriving.  \"I want you to understand,\" Mr. St. Clair was saying, \"that when _I_ send for you, you are to come when I bid you. Don't tell me you couldn't help it,--if there is danger of detention on the road, you should start earlier. _I_ am accustomed to having _my_ orders obeyed, and all who are employed at Villa Rosa must fully understand that. Go on with your music, and next time, see to it that you arrive more promptly.\"  Uncle Robert strutted away with such a pompous air, that Patty was almost afraid of him herself. But when he saw her, he beamed kindly, and said:  \"Come here, my dear, and tell me what you think of all this.\"  \"I think the house looks beautiful, uncle, just like Fairyland, with all the flowers and lights. And I think you are very kind to give this party for me.\"  \"Well, well, child, we have to invite our friends occasionally, you know. Have a good time, and I shall feel amply repaid for my outlay. Those American Beauties are fine, aren't they?\"  \"Indeed they are,\" said Patty, sniffing at one that reached its rich redness temptingly towards her.  \"Oh, don't do that! You'll spoil them. Those roses cost six dollars a dozen. But how fine you look in your new gew-gaws. Turn round, little one. Ah, we have no reason to feel ashamed of our Southern maid to-night.\"  Patty was glad her uncle was pleased, for she herself felt rather uncomfortable. Her dress, which was made with low neck and short sleeves, was of red silk gauze, with multifold short skirts, accordion-plaited, and edged with thick, full ruches. Great golden butterflies were embroidered at intervals all over the dress, while ribbons and flowers were attached wherever a place could be found for them.  Ethelyn had coaxed Patty to have her hair dressed high on her head, so Elise had arranged a marvelous _coiffure_ which displayed jeweled pins and combs of many sorts, and a necklace and bracelets rivaled them in glitter. Red silk stockings, and red satin slippers with gilt butterflies on them completed this gorgeous costume, and when Patty saw herself in the long mirrors, she thought she looked like one of the paper fairies which she used to hang on her Christmas trees.  When the party began, she stood beside her aunt and Ethelyn and received the guests as they arrived.  About fifty boys and girls came, and to Patty they all seemed like overdressed and artificial little puppets.  The girls put on grown-up airs, walked with mincing steps and giggled behind their fans, while the boys were affected and absurdly formal.  Patty had thought there would be games or amusements of some youthful sort, but dancing and promenading alternated throughout the evening.  However, she was fond of dancing, and as she was quickly becoming a general favorite, her card was soon filled with the names of the nicest boys in the room.  It was all very pleasant for a short time, but soon Patty grew very tired and secretly longed for supper to be announced.  At last this came to pass, and the children marched out to the dining-room where another beautiful sight awaited them.  The caterers had been as skilful as the decorators, and the table was filled with marvelous confections of rich foods.  Patty had never seen such wonderful things, and she almost thought the pheasants were alive; and the big salmon looked as if it had just been taken from the water. Then there were salads and croquettes, and funny little paper dishes filled with strange, delicious mixtures, and after all these, came creams and jellies and ices, and cakes and bonbons in all sorts of odd shapes and colors.  Patty thought these things were too pretty to be eaten, but they were quickly demolished by the young people, who were hearty, hungry boys and girls, in spite of their affected manners.  After supper the dancing and promenading began again, and was kept up until midnight, and Patty was a very tired little girl after she had said good-night to all the guests and the last carriage had rolled away from Villa Rosa.  Ethelyn was tired too, and decidedly cross.  \"I didn't have a very good time,\" she said; \"that horrid old Gladys Mahoney had a prettier dress than mine; and I broke my new fan, and my slippers are so tight, they hurt me awfully.\" \"Pooh, I know what makes you cross,\" said Reginald, \"just 'cause Bob Burton didn't dance with you as much as he did with Mabel Miller.\"  \"I'm not cross,\" retorted Ethelyn, \"and I didn't want to dance with Bob Burton. If I were you, I'd try to learn some manners; Lou Smith says you're the rudest boy she ever saw.\"  \"I don't care what Lou Smith says, little, freckle-faced thing! I don't see why she was invited here, anyway.\"  \"Stop quarreling, children,\" said Mrs. St. Clair, \"and go to bed at once. Patricia, I hope you enjoyed the party; I'm sure I tried to have it nice, but everything seemed to go wrong, the salad wasn't fit to eat and the ice cream was half melted.\"  \"Why, Aunt Isabel,\" said Patty, \"I think everything was lovely. I never saw such a supper-table in my life, and the decorations were exquisite.\"  \"Well, I didn't think so. It does seem a shame to pay out so much money, and then not have things to your liking.\"  \"Oh, the party was good enough,\" said Mr. St. Clair, \"you're too fussy about trifles, Isabel. Come, children, scurry off to bed, you'll get no beauty sleep to-night, I fear.\"  Patty went to her room, and taking her mother's picture, sat down to talk to it, as she did nearly every night.  \"Motherdy,\" she said, \"if you had lived to take care of me, I don't believe you'd have liked the party we had to-night. The grown-upness of it was all out of proportion for children, I think, and,--as usual in this house, the expense was out of proportion to everything else. Why, Uncle Robert must have spent a thousand dollars for it,--maybe more,--he'll probably tell us to-morrow just how much everything cost. I liked some of the party,--the supper was lovely, but,--well, I reckon I ate out of proportion too. You see, little mother, it's very hard always to do just right. Now I'm going to bed, and I'm so sleepy, I don't know as I'll wake up before to-morrow afternoon.\"  She kissed the beautiful face, and putting the picture back where it belonged, she hopped into bed and was soon fast asleep.     CHAPTER VII   A SLEIGH-RIDE  The winter slipped away, and as Patty was a little girl who always looked on the bright side of things, she really had very good times at Ville Rosa.  She became a favorite with the Elmbridge boys and girls, and her unfailing good nature kept her from quarreling with her cousins though she was often sorely tried by them.  Lessons were a very uncertain quantity. Sometimes there would be none at all for a week or two weeks, and then perhaps school would keep regularly for a few days, only to be followed by another interruption.  Patty found it only too easy to fall into these careless ways, and if she had stayed all her life at Villa Rosa, I fear she would have become indolent and selfish, for the rule of the whole household seemed to be \"Pleasure before Duty,\" and when that rule is followed it often happens that the duties are not done at all.  In January, to Patty's great delight, there came a heavy snowstorm.  It made fine sleighing, for the roads were in just the right condition and as the weather was clear and cold there was good prospect of many days' fun.  Uncle Robert, always ready to give the young people a good time, instigated a sleighing parade, in which all the society people of Elmbridge were invited to join.  It was to be a grand affair. Every sleigh was to be decorated in beautiful or unique fashion, and there was great rivalry among the families of Elmbridge as to whose sleigh should present the finest spectacle.  \"Papa,\" said Ethelyn, \"I shall drive Patricia in my little cutter, of course, and I want you to fix it up, somehow, so that it will beat everybody else all hollow.\"  \"Ethelyn,\" said her mother, \"if you don't stop using those slang phrases, you shan't go in the parade at all. Now promise to talk like a lady, and I'll see to it that your sleigh outshines all the rest.\"  \"All right,\" said Ethelyn, \"I'll promise. Now, how shall we decorate it?\"  \"Never mind,\" said her mother, \"I wouldn't trust you with the secret. You'd tell everybody before the parade, and give them a chance to imitate it. But just wait and see. You and Patricia shall drive the most beautiful turnout in the whole line.\"  That day Mrs. St. Clair made a hurried trip to New York and came home with many mysterious packages, and other larger packages came by express. Mr. St. Clair came home early from his business and spent much of his time in the barn, and the preparations grew so exciting that both Patty and Ethelyn were on tiptoe with curiosity and anticipation. The parade was to start the next afternoon at two o'clock. Soon after luncheon, Mrs. St. Clair sent the girls to their rooms to dress for the great event.  Ethelyn gave a little scream of delight, as she saw new garments spread out on her bed, and Patty ran on to her own room to find similar ones there.  Each girl had a long coat of fine white broadcloth, made with a double cape-collar, and trimmed all round with white fur. A broad-brimmed white felt hat, with white ostrich plumes and a fleecy white feather boa, white gloves, and a white muff were there too; and even white shoes and white cloth leggings, so that when the cousins were dressed, there was not a touch of color about them, save their rosy faces and golden hair, and they looked like veritable snow-queens.  They danced down-stairs to find Cupid awaiting them with a brand-new sleigh.  Cupid was Ethelyn's pony, and he was pure white, every bit of him, and it was this fact that had"]]]
