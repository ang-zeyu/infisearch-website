Her tone implied that it was a piece of evidence she did not accept on hearsay.  “Well, I believe it’s true. Last summer a whole lot of us were out on the verandah, and there was plenty of laughing and talking going on—a snake wouldn’t crawl into a rowdy group like that for the fun of it, now, would he? It was Christmas day, and my little brother Phil—he’s six—had found a piccolo in his stocking, and he was sitting on the end of the verandah playing away at this thing. We thought it was a bit of a row, but Phil was quite happy. Presently my sister Vera looked at him, and screamed out, ‘Why, there’s a snake!’  “So there was, and it was just beside Phil. It had crawled up between the verandah boards, and was lying quietly near the little chap, looking at him stealthily—he was blowing away, quite unconcerned. We didn’t know what to do for a moment, for the beastly thing was so near Phil that we didn’t like to hit it for fear we missed and it bit him. However, Phil solved the difficulty by getting up and walking off, still playing the piccolo. The snake never stirred when he did—and you may be sure it didn’t get much chance to stir after. Three sticks came down on it at the same time.”  “I say!” Norah breathed quickly. “What an escape for poor Phil!”  “Wasn’t it? He didn’t seem to care a bit when we showed him the snake and told him it had been so near him—he hadn’t known a thing about it. ‘Can’t be bovvered wiv snakes,’ was all he said.”  “When I was a little kiddie,” Norah said, “they found me playing with a snake one day.”  “Playing with it?” Harry echoed.  “Yes; I was only about two, and I don’t remember anything about it. Dad came on to the back verandah, and saw me sitting by a patch of dust, stroking something. He couldn’t make out what it was at first, and then he came a bit nearer, and saw that it was a big snake. It was lying in the dust sunning itself, and I was stroking it most kindly.”  “By George!” said Harry.  “Funny what things kiddies will do!” said Norah, with all the superiority of twelve long years. “It frightened Dad tremendously. He didn’t know what to do, ’cause he didn’t dare come near or call out. I s’pose the snake saw him, ’cause it began to move. It crawled right over my bare legs.”  “And never bit you?”  “No; I kept on stroking its back as it went over my knees, without the least idea that it was anything dangerous. Dad said it seemed years and years before it went right over and crawled away from me into the grass. He had me out of the way in about half a second, and got a stick, and I cried like anything when he killed it, and said he was naughty!”  “If you chaps have finished swopping snake yarns,” said Jim, turning in his saddle, “there’s Anglers’ Bend.”  They had been riding steadily across the plain, until they had again come near the scrub-line which marked the course of the creek. Following the direction pointed by Jim’s finger, they saw a deep curve in the green, where the creek suddenly left the fairly straight course it had been pursuing and made two great bends something like a capital U, the points of which lay in their direction. They rode down between them until they were almost at the water’s edge.  Here the creek was very deep, and in sweeping round had cut out a wide bed, nearly three times its usual breadth. Tall trees grew almost to the verge of the banks on both sides, so that the water was almost always in shadow, while so high were the banks that few breezes were able to ripple its surface. It lay placid all the year, scarcely troubled even in winter, when the other parts of the creek rushed and tumbled in flood. There was room in the high banks of Anglers’ Bend for all the extra water, and its presence was only marked by the strength of the current that ran in the very centre of the stream.  Just now the water was not high, and seemed very far below the children, who sat looking at it from their ponies on the bank. As they watched in silence a fish leaped in the middle of the Bend. The sudden movement seemed amazing in the stillness. It flashed for an instant in a patch of sunlight, and then fell back, sending circling ripples spreading to each bank.  “Good omen, I hope,” Harry said, “though they often don’t bite when they jump, you know.”  “It’s not often they don’t bite here,” Jim said.  “Well, it looks a good enough place for anything—if we can’t catch fish here, we won’t be up to much as anglers,” Harry said.  “You’ve been here before, haven’t you, Norah?” Wally asked.  “Oh, yes; ever so many times.”  “Father and Norah have great fishing excursions on their own,” said Jim. “They take a tent and camp out for two or three days with Billy as general flunkey. I don’t know how many whales they haven’t caught at this place. They know the Bend as well as any one.”  “Well, I guess we’d better take off the saddles and get to work,” said Norah, slipping off Bobs and patting his neck before undoing the girth. The boys followed her example and soon the saddles were safely stowed in the shade. Then Jim turned with a laugh.  “Well, we are duffers,” he said. “Can’t do a thing till Billy turns up. He’s got all the hooks and lines, all the bait, all the hobbles, all the everything!”  “Whew-w!” whistled the boys.  “Well, it doesn’t matter,” Norah said cheerfully. “There’s lots to do. We can hang up the ponies while we hunt for rods. You boys have got your strong knives, haven’t you?”  They had, and immediately scattered to work. The ponies having been tied securely under a grove of saplings, the search for rods began, and soon four long straight sticks were obtained with the necessary amount of “springiness.” Then they hunted for a suitable camping-ground, where lunch might be eaten without too much disturbance from flies and mosquitoes, and gathered a good supply of dry sticks for a fire.  “Billy ought to bless us, anyhow,” Jim grinned.  “Yes, oughtn’t he? Come along and see if he’s coming.” They ran out upon the plain, and cheerful exclamations immediately proclaimed the fact that Billy and the old packhorse had at length made their appearance in what Wally called the “offing.”  Billy soon clattered up to the little party, the hobbles and quart pot jingling cheerfully on old Polly’s back. He grinned amiably at the four merry faces awaiting him in the shade of a wattle tree.  “This feller pretty slow,” he said, indicating Polly with a jerk of his thumb. “You all waitin’ for tackle?”  “Rather,” said Jim. “Never mind, we’ve got everything ready. Look sharp and shy down the hooks, Billy—they’re in that tin, and the lines are tied on to it, in a parcel. That’s right,” as the black boy tossed the tackle down and he caught it deftly. “Now, you chaps, get to work, and get your lines ready.”  “Right oh!” said the chorus, as it fell to work. Billy made a swift incursion into the interior of the pack, and fished up a tin of worms and some raw meat, Wally being the only one to patronize the latter. The other three baited their hooks with worms, and, all being in readiness, made their way down the steep bank at a place where a little cleft gave easier access to a tiny shelving beach below. Here a great tree-trunk had long ago been left by an unusually high flood, and formed a splendid place to fish from, as it jutted out for some distance over the stream. Norah scrambled out like a cat to its farthest extremity, and Harry followed her for part of the way. Wally and Jim settled themselves at intervals along the trunk. Sinkers, floats and baits were examined, and the business of the day began.  Everybody knows how it feels to fish. You throw in your hook with such blissful certainty that no fish can possibly resist the temptation you are dangling before its eyes. There is suppressed excitement all over you. You are all on the alert, feeling for imaginary nibbles, for bites that are not there. Sometimes, of course, the dreams come true, and the bites are realities; but these occasions are sadly outnumbered by the times when you keep on feeling and bobbing your line vainly, while excitement lulls to expectation, and expectation merges into hope, and hope becomes wishing, and wishing often dies down to disappointment.  Such was the gradual fate of the fishing party at Anglers’ Bend. At first the four floats were watched with an intensity of regard that should surely have had some effect in luring fishes to the surface; but as the minutes dragged by and not a fish seemed inclined even to nibble, the solemn silence which had brooded on the quartet was broken by sundry fidgetings and wrigglings and suppressed remarks on the variableness of fish and the slowness of fishing. Men enjoy the sport, because they can light their pipes and smoke in expectant ease; but the consolation of tobacco was debarred from boys who were, as Jim put it, “too young to smoke and too old to make idiots of themselves by trying it,” and so they found it undeniably dull.  Billy came down to join the party presently, after he had seen to his horses and unpacked old Polly’s load. His appearance gave Jim a brilliant idea, and he promptly despatched the black boy for cake, which proved a welcome stimulant to flagging enthusiasm.  “Don’t know if fish care about cake crumbs,” said Harry, finishing a huge slice with some regret.  “Didn’t get a chance of sampling any of mine,” Wally laughed; “I wanted it all myself. Hallo!”  “What is it—a bite?”  “Rather—such a whopper! I’ve got it, too,” Wally gasped, tugging at his line.  “You’ve got it, right enough,” Jim said. “Why, your rod’s bending right over. Want a hand?”  “No, thanks—manage it myself,” said the fisherman, tugging manfully. “Here she comes!”  The line came in faster now, and the strain on the rod was plain. Excitement ran high.  “It’s a great big perch, I do believe,” Norah exclaimed. “Just fancy, if it beats Dad’s big boomer—the biggest ever"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8730"],["title","A Little Bush Maid (#8)"],["body"," here.”  “It’ll beat some records,” Wally gasped, hauling in frantically. “Here she comes!”  “She” came, with a final jerk. Jim broke into a suppressed shout of laughter. For Wally’s catch was nothing less than an ancient, mud-laden boot!     CHAPTER VI. A BUSH FIRE   Wally disentangled his hook gravely, while the others would have laughed more heartily but for fear of frightening the fish.  “Well, I’m blessed!” said the captor at length, surveying the prize with his nose in the air. “A blooming old boot! Been there since the year one, I should think, by the look of it.”  “I thought you had a whale at the very least,” grinned Harry.  “Well, I’ve broken my duck, anyhow, and that’s more than any of you others can say!” Wally laughed. “Time enough for you to grin when you’ve caught something yourselves—even if it’s only an old boot! It’s a real old stager and no mistake. I wonder how it came in here.”  “Some poor old beggar of a swaggie, I expect,” Jim said. “He didn’t chuck it away until it was pretty well done, did he? Look at the holes in the uppers—and there’s no sole left to speak of.”  “Do you see many tramps here?” Harry asked.  “Not many—we’re too far from a road,” Jim replied. “Of course there are a certain number who know of the station, and are sure of getting tucker there—and a job if they want one—not that many of them do, the lazy beggars. Most of them would be injured if you asked them to chop a bit of wood in return for a meal, and some of them threaten to set the place on fire if they don’t get all they want.”  “My word!” said Wally. “Did they ever do it?”  “Once—two years ago,” Jim answered. “A fellow came one hot evening in January. We’d had a long spell of heat, and all our meat had gone bad that day; there was hardly a bit in the place, and of course they couldn’t kill a beast till evening. About the middle of the day this chap turned up and asked for tucker.  “Mrs. Brown gave him bread and flour and tea and some cake—a real good haul for any swaggie. It was too good for this fellow, for he immediately turned up his proud nose and said he wanted meat. Mrs. Brown explained that she hadn’t any to give him; but he evidently didn’t believe her, said it was our darned meanness and, seeing no men about, got pretty insulting. At last he tried to force his way past Mrs. Brown into the kitchen.”  “Did he get in?” asked Wally.  “Nearly—not quite, though. Dad and Norah and I had been out riding, and we came home, past the back yard, in the nick of time. We couldn’t hear what the fellow was saying to Mrs. Brown, but his attitude was enough to make us pull up, and as we did so we saw him try to shove her aside. She was plucky enough and banged the door in his face, but he got his foot in the crack, so that it couldn’t shut, and began to push it open.  “Dad slipped off his horse gently. He made a sign to us to keep quiet and went across the yard, and we saw him shake the lash of his stockwhip loose. You can just fancy how Norah and I were dancing with joy!  “Dad was just near the verandah when we saw the door give. Poor old Brownie was getting the worst of it. We heard the fellow call out something—a threat—and Dad’s arm went up, and the stockwhip came down like a flash across the man’s shoulder He gave one yell! You never heard such an amazed and terrified roar in your life!” and Jim chuckled with joy at the recollection.  “He turned on Dad and jumped at him, but he got another one with the whip that made him pause, and then Dad caught him and shook him like a rat. Mr. Swaggie was limp enough when it was over.  “‘I’ve a very good mind to give you in charge!’ Dad said—he was simply furious. It made a fellow feel pretty bad to see poor old Brownie’s white face in the doorway, and to think what a fright she had had.  “The swaggie turned a very ugly look on Dad.  “‘You give me in charge, and I’ll precious quick have you up for assault!’ he said.  “Dad laughed.  “‘As for that, you can do exactly as you choose,’ he said. ‘I’ll be quite ready to answer for thrashing a cur like you. However, you’re not worth carting seventeen miles to Cunjee, so you can go—the quicker the better.”  “And he cleared, I suppose?” Wally asked.  “He just did—went like a redshank. But when he got outside the gate and a bit away he stopped and turned round and let fly at Dad—such a volley of threats and abuse you never heard. It finished up with something about the grass; we didn’t quite understand what; but we remembered it later, and then it was clearer to us. However, he didn’t stop to explain, as Dad turned the dogs loose. They lost no time, and neither did the swaggie. He left the place at about the rate of a mile a minute!”  Jim paused.  “Thought I had a bite,” he said, pulling up his line. “Bother it! The bait’s gone! Chuck me a worm, young Wally.” He impaled the worm and flung his line out again.  “Where was I? Oh, yes. Norah and I were a bit scared about the swaggie, and wondered what he’d try to do; but Dad only laughed at us. It never entered his head that the brute would really try to have his revenge. Of course it would have been easy enough to have had him watched off the place, but Dad didn’t even think of it. He knows better now.  “I waked up early next morning hearing someone yelling outside. It was only just light. I slipped out of my window and ran into the yard, and the first thing I saw was smoke. It was coming from the west, a great cloud of it, with plenty of wind to help it along. It was one of those hot autumn mornings—you know the kind. Make you feel anyhow.”  “Who was yelling?” asked Harry.  “One of Morrison’s men—he owns the land adjoining ours. This fellow was coo-eeing for all he was worth.  “‘You’d better rouse your men out quick ’n lively,’ he sang out. ‘There’s a big grass fire between us and you. All our chaps are workin’ at it; but I don’t fancy they can keep it back in this wind.’  “I just turned and ran.  “The big bell we use for summoning the men to their meals hangs under the kitchen verandah and I made a bee-line for it. There seemed plenty of rocks and bits of glass about, and my bare feet got ’em all—at least I thought so—but there wasn’t time to think much. Morrison’s chap had galloped off as soon as he gave his news. I caught hold of the bell-pull and worked it all I knew!  “You should have seen them tumble out! In about half a minute the place was like a jumpers’ nest that you’ve stirred up with a stick. Dad came out of the back door in his pyjamas, Norah came scudding along the verandah, putting on her kimono as she ran, Brownie and the other servants appeared at their windows, and the men came tumbling out of the barracks and the hut like so many rabbits.  “Dad was annoyed.  “‘What are you doing, you young donkey?’ he sang out.  “‘Look over there!’ I says, tugging the bell.  “Dad looked. It didn’t take him long to see what was up when he spied that big cloud of smoke.  “‘Great Scott!’ he shouted. ‘Jim, get Billy to run the horses up. Where are you all? Burrows, Field, Henry! Get out the water-cart—quick. All of you get ready fire-beaters. Dress yourselves—quickly!’ (You could see that was quite an afterthought on Dad’s part.) Then he turned and fled inside to dress.”  “How ripping!” Wally said, wriggling on the log with joy.  “Ripping, do you call it?” said Jim indignantly. “You try it for yourself, young Wally, and see. Fire’s not much of a joke when you’re fighting it yourself, I can tell you. Well, Dad was out again in about two shakes, ready for the fray, and you can bet the rest of us didn’t linger long. Billy had the horses up almost as soon, and every one got his own. Things were a bit merry in the stockyard, I can tell you, and heels did fly.  “After all, Norah here was the first mounted. Bobs was in the stable, you see, and Norah had him saddled before any of us had put our bridles on. Goodness knows how she dressed. I guess it wasn’t much of a toilet!”  Jim ducked suddenly, and a chip hurled by Norah flew over his head and splashed into the water.  “Get out—you’ll frighten the fish!” he said, grinning. “My yarn, old girl.”  “Might have had the sense to keep me out of it,” said Norah impolitely.  “You be jiggered,” said Jim affectionately. “Anyhow, boys, you should have seen Dad’s face when Norah trotted over from the stable. He was just girthing up old Bosun, and I was wrestling with Sirdar, who didn’t want his crupper on.  “‘My dear child,’ Dad said, ‘get off that pony and go back to bed. You can’t think I could allow you to come out?’  “Poor old Norah’s face fell about a foot. She begged and argued, but she might as well have spared herself the trouble. At last Dad said she could ride out in the first two paddocks, but no nearer the fire, she had to be content with that. I think she was pretty near mopping her eyes.”  “Wasn’t,” said Norah indistinctly.  “Well, we went off. All of us had fire-beaters. You know we always have them ready; and Field was driving the water-cart—it always stands ready filled for use. We just galloped like mad. Dad didn’t wait for any gates—Bosun can jump anything—and he just went straight across country. Luckily, there was no stock in the paddocks near the house, except that in one small paddock were about twenty valuable prize sheep. However, the fire was so far off that we reckoned they were safe, and so we turned our attention to the fire.  “We left old Norah in the second paddock, looking as miserable as a bandicoot. Dad made her promise not to meddle with the fire. ‘Promise me you won’t try any putting out on your own account,’ he said; and Norah promised very reluctantly. I was jolly sorry you were out of it, you know, old kid,” said Jim reflectively; and Norah gave him a little smile.  “We made great time across the paddocks,” Jim continued. “Dad was ever so far ahead, of course, but our contingent, that had to go round by the gates, didn’t do so badly. Billy was on Mick, and he and I had a go for the lead across the last paddock.”  “Who won?” "]]]
