I have likewise a quantity of men’s dark hair, instead of which, I have left gray locks, or none at all.  The tears of widows and other afflicted mortals, who have received comfort during the last twelve months, are preserved in some dozens of essence-bottles, well corked and sealed.  I have several bundles of love-letters, eloquently breathing an eternity of burning passion, which grew cold and perished, almost before the ink was dry.  Moreover, here is an assortment of many thousand broken promises, and other broken ware, all very light and packed into little space.  The heaviest articles in my possession are a large parcel of disappointed hopes, which, a little while ago, were buoyant enough to have inflated Mr. Lauriat’s balloon.”  “I have a fine lot of hopes here in my basket,” remarked the New Year. “They are a sweet-smelling flower,--a species of rose.”  “They soon lose their perfume,” replied the sombre Old Year. “What else have you brought to insure a welcome from the discontented race of mortals?”  “Why, to say the truth, little or nothing else,” said her sister, with a smile,--“save a few new Annuals and Almanacs, and some New Year’s gifts for the children.  But I heartily wish well to poor mortals, and mean to do all I can for their improvement and happiness.”  “It is a good resolution,” rejoined the Old Year; “and, by the way, I have a plentiful assortment of good resolutions, which have now grown so stale and musty, that I am ashamed to carry them any farther.  Only for fear that the City authorities would send Constable Mansfield, with a warrant after me, I should toss them into the street at once. Many other matters go to make up the contents of my bandbox; but the whole lot would not fetch a single bid, even at an auction of worn-out furniture; and as they are worth nothing either to you or anybody else, I need not trouble you with a longer catalogue.”  “And must I also pickup such worthless luggage in my travels?” asked the New Year.  “Most certainly; and well, if you have no heavier load to bear,”  replied the other.  “And now, my dear sister, I must bid you farewell, earnestly advising and exhorting you to expect no gratitude ‘nor goodwill from this peevish, unreasonable, inconsiderate, ill-intending, and worse-behaving world.  However warmly its inhabitants may seen to welcome you, yet, do what you may, and lavish on them what means of happiness you please, they will still be complaining, still craving what it is not in your power to give, still looking forward to some other Year for the accomplishment of projects which ought never to have been formed, and which, if successful, would only provide new occasions of discontent.  If these ridiculous people ever see anything tolerable in you, it will be after you are gone forever.”  “But I,” cried the fresh-hearted New Year,--“I shall try to leave men wiser than I find them.  I will offer them freely whatever good gifts Providence permits me to distribute, and will tell them to be thankful for what they have, and humbly hopeful for more; and surely, if they are not absolute fools, they will condescend to be happy, and will allow me to be a happy Year. For my happiness must depend on them.”  “Alas for you, then, my poor sister!” said the Old fear, sighing, as she uplifted her burden.  “We grand-children of Time are born to trouble.  Happiness, they say, dwells in the mansions of Eternity; but we can only lead mortals thither, step by step, with reluctant murmurings, and ourselves must perish on the threshold.  But hark! my task is done.”  The clock in the tall steeple of Dr. Emerson’s church struck twelve; there was a response from Dr. Flint’s, in the opposite quarter of the city; and while the strokes were yet dropping into the air, the Old Year either flitted or faded away; and not the wisdom and might of Angels, to say nothing of the remorseful yearnings of the millions who had used her ill, could have prevailed with that departed Year to return one step.  But she, in the company of Time and all her kindred, must hereafter hold a reckoning with Mankind.  So shall it be, likewise, with the maidenly New Year, who, as the clock ceased to strike, arose from the steps of the City Hall, and set out rather timorously on her earthly course.  “A happy New Year!” cried a watchman, eying her figure very questionably, but without the least suspicion that he was addressing the New Year in person.  “Thank you kindly!”  said the New Year; and she gave the watchman one of the roses of hope from her basket.  “May this flower keep a sweet smell, long after I have bidden you good by.”  Then she stepped on more briskly through the silent streets; and such as were awake at the moment, heard her footfall, and said, “The New Year is come!”  Wherever there was a knot of midnight roisterers, they quaffed her health.  She sighed, however, to perceive that the air was tainted--as the atmosphere of this world must continually be--with the dying breaths of mortals who had lingered just long enough for her to bury them.  But there were millions left alive, to rejoice at her coming; and so she pursued her way with confidence, strewing emblematic flowers on the doorstep of almost every dwelling, which some persons will gather up and wear in their bosoms, and others will trample under foot.  The Carrier Boy can only say further, that, early this morning, she filled his basket with New Year’s Addresses, assuring him that the whole City, with our new Mayor, and the Aldermen and Common Council at its head, would make a general rush to secure copies.  Kind Patrons, will not you redeem the pledge of the NEW YEAR?"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9212"],["title","Snow Flakes (From \"Twice Told Tales\") (#0)"],["body","TOLD TALES                            SNOW-FLAKES                       By Nathaniel Hawthorne    There is snow in yonder cold gray sky of the  morning!-and, through the partially frosted  window-panes, I love to watch the gradual beginning of the storm.  A few feathery flakes are scattered widely through the air, and hover downward with uncertain flight, now almost alighting on the earth, now whirled again aloft into remote regions of the atmosphere.  These are not the big flakes, heavy with moisture, which melt as they touch the ground, and are portentous of a  soaking rain.  It is to be, in good earnest, a wintry storm.  The two or three people, visible on the side-walks, have an aspect of endurance, a blue-nosed, frosty  fortitude, which is evidently assumed in anticipation of a comfortless and blustering day.  By nightfall, or at least before the sun sheds another glimmering smile upon us,  the street and our little garden will be heaped with  mountain snow-drifts. The soil, already frozen for weeks  past, is prepared to sustain whatever burden may be laid  upon it; and, to a northern eye, the landscape will lose  its melancholy bleakness and acquire a beauty of its own,  when Mother Earth, like her children, shall have put on the fleecy garb of her winter's wear.  The cloud-spirits  are slowly weaving her white mantle. As yet, indeed,  there is barely a rime like hoarfrost over the brown surface of the street; the withered green of the grass-plat is still discernible; and the slated roofs of the houses do but begin to look gray, instead of black.  All the snow that has yet fallen within the circumference of my view, were it heaped up together, would hardly equal the hillock of a grave.  Thus gradually, by silent and stealthy influences, are great changes wrought.  These little snow-particles, which the storm-spirit flings by handfuls through the air, will bury the great earth under their accumulated mass, nor permit her to behold her sister sky again for dreary months. We, likewise, shall lose sight of our mother's familiar visage, and must content ourselves with looking heavenward the oftener.  Now, leaving the storm to do his appointed office, let us sit down, pen in hand, by our fireside.  Gloomy as it may seem, there is an influence productive of cheerfulness, and favorable to imaginative thought, in the atmosphere of a snowy day.  The native of a southern clime may woo the muse beneath the heavy shade of summer foliage, reclining on banks of turf, while the sound of singing birds and warbling rivulets chimes in with the music of his soul.  In our brief summer, I do not think, but only exist in the vague enjoyment of a dream.  My hour of inspiration--if that hour ever comes--is when the green log hisses upon the hearth, and the bright flame, brighter for the gloom of the chamber, rustles high up the chimney, and the coals drop tinkling down among the growing heaps of ashes.  When the casement rattles in the gust, and the snow-flakes or the sleety raindrops pelt hard against the window-panes, then I spread out my sheet of paper, with the certainty that thoughts and fancies will gleam forth upon it, like stars at twilight, or like violets in May,--perhaps to fade as soon.  However transitory their glow, they at least shine amid the darksome shadow which the clouds of the outward sky fling through the room.  Blessed, therefore, and reverently welcomed by me, her true-born son, be New England's winter, which makes us, one and all, the nurslings of the storm, and sings a familiar lullaby even in the wildest shriek of the December blast.  Now look we forth again, and see how much of his task the storm-spirit has done.  Slow and sure!  He has the day, perchance the week, before him, and may take his own time to accomplish Nature's burial in snow. A smooth mantle is scarcely yet thrown over the withered grass-plat, and the dry stalks of annuals still thrust themselves through the white surface in all parts of the garden.  The leafless rose-bushes stand shivering in a shallow snow-drift, looking, poor things! as disconsolate as if they possessed a human consciousness of the dreary scene.  This is a sad time for the shrubs that do not perish with the summer; they neither live nor die; what they retain of life seems but the chilling sense of death.  Very sad are the flower shrubs in midwinter!  The roofs of the houses are now all white, save where the eddying wind has kept them bare at the bleak corners.  To discern the real intensity of the storm, we must fix upon some distant object,--as yonder spire,-and observe how the riotous gust fights with the descending snow throughout the intervening space.  Sometimes the entire prospect is obscured; then, again, we have a distinct, but transient glimpse of the tall steeple, like a giant's ghost; and now the dense wreaths sweep between, as if demons were flinging snowdrifts at each other, in mid-air.  Look next into the street, where we have seen an amusing parallel to the combat of those fancied demons in the upper regions.  It is a snow-battle of school-boys.  What a pretty satire on war and military glory might be written, in the form of a child's story, by describing the snowball-fights of two rival schools, the alternate defeats and victories of each, and the final triumph of one party, or perhaps of neither!  What pitched battles, worthy to be chanted in Homeric strains!  What storming of fortresses, built all of massive snowblocks!  What feats of individual prowess, and embodied onsets of martial enthusiasm!  And when some well-contested and decisive victory had put a period to the war, both armies should unite to build a lofty monument of snow upon the battle-field, and crown it with the victor's statue, hewn of the same frozen marble.  In a few days or weeks thereafter, the passer-by would observe a shapeless mound upon the level common; and, unmindful of the famous victory, would ask,  \"How came it there?  Who reared it?  And what means it?\" The shattered pedestal of many a battle monument has provoked these questions, when none could answer.  Turn we again to the fireside, and sit musing there, lending our ears to the wind, till perhaps it shall seem like an articulate voice, and dictate wild and airy matter for the pen.  Would it might inspire me to sketch out the personification of a New England winter!  And that idea, if I can seize the snow-wreathed figures that flit before my fancy, shall be the theme of the next page.  How does Winter herald his approach?  By the shrieking blast of latter autumn, which is Nature's cry of lamentation, as the destroyer rushes among the shivering groves where she has lingered, and scatters the sear leaves upon the tempest.  When that cry is heard, the people wrap themselves in cloaks, and shake their heads disconsolately, saying, \"Winter is at hand!\" Then the axe of the woodcutter echoes sharp and diligently in the forest; then the coal-merchants rejoice, because each shriek of Nature in her agony adds something to the price of coal per ton; then the peat-smoke spreads its aromatic fragrance through the atmosphere.  A few days more; and at eventide, the children look out of the window, and dimly perceive the flaunting of a snowy mantle in the air.  It is stern Winter's vesture.  They crowd around the hearth, and cling to their mother's gown, or press between their father's knees, affrighted by the hollow roaring voice, that bellows a-down the wide flue of the chimney.  It is the voice of Winter; and when parents and children bear it, they shudder and exclaim, \"Winter is come!  Cold Winter has begun his reign already!\"  Now, throughout New England, each hearth becomes an altar, sending up the smoke of a continued sacrifice to the immitigable deity who tyrannizes over forest, country side, and town.  Wrapped in his white mantle, his staff a huge icicle, his beard and hair a wind-tossed snow-drift, he travels over the land, in the midst of the northern blast; and woe to the homeless wanderer whom he finds upon his path!  There he lies stark and stiff, a human shape of ice, on the spot where Winter overtook him.  On strides the tyrant over the rushing rivers and broad lakes, which turn to rock beneath his footsteps.  His dreary empire is established; all around stretches the desolation of the Pole.  Yet not ungrateful be his New England children,--for Winter is our sire, though a stern and rough one,--not ungrateful even for the severities, which have nourished our unyielding strength of character.  And let us thank him, too, for the sleigh-rides, cheered by the music of merry bells; for the crackling and rustling hearth, when the ruddy firelight gleams on hardy Manhood and the blooming cheek of Woman; for all the home enjoyments, and the kindred virtues, which flourish in a frozen soil.  Not that we grieve, when, after some seven months of storm and bitter frost, Spring, in the guise of a flower-crowned virgin, is seen driving away the hoary despot, pelting him with violets by the handful, and strewing green grass on the path behind him.  Often, ere he will give up his empire, old Winter rushes fiercely back, and hurls a snow-drift at the shrinking form of Spring; yet, step by step, he is compelled to retreat northward, and spends the summer months within the Arctic circle.  Such fantasies, intermixed among graver toils of mind, have made the winter's day pass pleasantly.  Meanwhile, the storm has raged without abatement, and now, as the brief afternoon declines, is tossing denser volumes to and fro about the atmosphere.  On the window-sill, there is a layer of snow, reaching half-way up the lowest pane of glass.  The garden is one unbroken bed.  Along the street are two or three spots of uncovered earth, where the gust has whirled away the snow, heaping it elsewhere to the fence-tops, or piling huge banks against the doors of houses.
