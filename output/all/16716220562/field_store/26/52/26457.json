From particular things represented to our  intellect fragmentarily, confusedly, and without order through our senses (II. xxix. Cor.);  I have settled to call such perceptions by the name of knowledge from the mere  suggestions of experience.  (2.) From symbols, e.g., from the fact of having read or heard certain words we remember things and form certain ideas concerning them, similar to those  through which we imagine things (II. xviii. Note).  I shall call both these ways of regarding  things \"knowledge of the first kind,\" \"opinion,\" or \"imagination.\"  (3.) From the fact that  we have notions common to all men, and adequate ideas of the properties of things (II. xxxviii. Cor., xxxix. and Cor., and xl.); this I call \"reason\" and \"knowledge of the second  kind.\"  Besides these two kinds of knowledge, there is, as I will hereafter show, a third  kind of knowledge, which we will call intuition.  This kind of knowledge proceeds from an  adequate idea of the absolute essence of certain attributes of God to the adequate  knowledge of the essence of things.  I will illustrate all three kinds of knowledge by a  single example.  Three numbers are given for finding a fourth, which shall be to the third  as the second is to the first.  Tradesmen without hesitation multiply the second by the third,  and divide the product by the first; either because they have not forgotten the rule which  they received from a master without any proof, or because they have often made trial of  it with simple numbers, or by virtue of the proof of the nineteenth proposition of the  seventh book of Euclid, namely, in virtue of the general property of proportionals.  But with very simple numbers there is no need of this.  For instance, one, two, three being  given, everyone can see that the fourth proportional is six; and this is much clearer, because we infer the fourth number from an intuitive grasping of the ratio, which the first bears to  the second.  XLI.  Knowledge of the first kind is the only source of falsity, knowledge of the second  and third kinds is necessarily true.  >>>>>Proof--To knowledge of the first kind we have (in the foregoing note) assigned all  those ideas, which are inadequate and confused; therefore this kind of knowledge is the  only source of falsity (II. xxxv.).  Furthermore, we assigned to the second and third kinds  of knowledge those ideas which are adequate; therefore these kinds are necessarily true (II. xxxiv.).  Q.E.D.  XLII. Knowledge of the second and third kinds, not knowledge of the first kind, teaches us  to distinguish the true from the false.  >>>>>Proof--This proposition is self-evident.  He, who knows how to distinguish between  true and false, must have an adequate idea of true and false.  That is (II. xl., note ii.), he  must know the true and the false by the second or third kind of knowledge.  XLIII. He, who has a true idea, simultaneously knows that he has a true idea, and cannot  doubt of the truth of the thing perceived.  >>>>>Proof--A true idea in us is an idea which is adequate in God, in so far as he is  displayed through the nature of the human mind (II. xi. Cor.).  Let us suppose that there is  in God, in so far as he is displayed through the human mind, an adequate idea, A.  The  idea of this idea must also necessarily be in God, and be referred to him in the same way as  the idea A (by II. xx., whereof the proof is of universal application).  But the idea A is  supposed to be referred to God, in so far as he is displayed through the human mind;  therefore, the idea of the idea A must be referred to God in the same manner; that is (by II. xi. Cor.), the adequate idea of the idea A will be in the mind, which has the adequate  idea A; therefore he, who has an adequate idea or knows a thing truly (II. xxxiv.), must at  the same time have an adequate idea or true knowledge of his knowledge; that is,  obviously, he must be assured.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--I explained in the note to II. xxi. what is meant by the idea of an idea; but we  may remark that the foregoing proposition is in itself sufficiently plain.  No one, who has a true idea, is ignorant that a true idea involves the highest certainty.  For to have a true idea  is only another expression for knowing a thing perfectly, or as well as possible.  No one, indeed, can doubt of this, unless he thinks that an idea is something lifeless, like a picture  on a panel, and not a mode of thinking--namely, the very act of understanding.  And who,  I ask, can know that he understands anything, unless he do first understand it?  In other  words, who can know that he is sure of a thing, unless he be first sure of that thing?   Further, what can there be more clear, and more certain, than a true idea as a standard  of truth?  Even as light displays both itself and darkness, so is truth a standard both of  itself and of falsity.  I think I have thus sufficiently answered these questions--namely, if a true idea is  distinguished from a false idea, only in so far as it is said to agree with its object, a true  idea has no more reality or perfection than a false idea (since the two are only distinguished  by an extrinsic mark); consequently, neither will a man who has a true idea have any advantage over him who has only false ideas.  Further, how comes it that men have false  ideas?  Lastly, how can anyone be sure, that he has ideas which agree with their objects?   These questions, I repeat, I have, in my opinion, sufficiently answered.  The difference  between a true idea and a false idea is plain:  from what was said in II. xxxv., the former is related to the latter as being is to not-being.  The causes of falsity I have set forth very  clearly in II. xix. and II. xxxv. with the note.  From what is there stated, the difference between a man who has true ideas, and a man who has only false ideas, is made apparent.   As for the last question--as to how a man can be sure that he has ideas that agree with  their objects, I have just pointed out, with abundant clearness, that his knowledge arises  from the simple fact, that he has an idea which corresponds with its object--in other words,  that truth is its own standard.  We may add that our mind, in so far as it perceives things  truly, is part of the infinite intellect of God (II. xi. Cor.); therefore, the clear and distinct  ideas of the mind are as necessarily true as the ideas of God.  XLIV. It is not in the nature of reason to regard things as contingent, but as necessary.  >>>>>Proof--It is in the nature of reason to perceive things truly (II. xli.), namely (I. Ax.  vi.), as they are in themselves--that is (I. xxix.), not as contingent, but as necessary.   Q.E.D.  <<<<<Corollary I--Hence it follows, that it is only through our imagination that we  consider things, whether in respect to the future or the past, as contingent.  *****Note--How this way of looking at things arises, I will briefly explain.  We have  shown above (II. xvii. and Cor.) that the mind always regards things as present to itself,  even though they be not in existence, until some causes arise which exclude their existence  and presence.  Further (II. xviii.), we showed that, if the human body has once been  affected by two external bodies simultaneously, the mind, when it afterwards imagines one of the said external bodies, will straightway remember the other--that is, it will regard both  as present to itself, unless there arise causes which exclude their existence and presence. Further, no one doubts that we imagine time, from the fact that we imagine bodies to be  moved some more slowly than others, some more quickly, some at equal speed.  Thus,  let us suppose that a child yesterday saw Peter for the first time in the morning, Paul at  noon, and Simon in the evening; then, that today he again sees Peter in the morning.  It is  evident, from II. Prop. xviii., that, as soon as he sees the morning light, he will imagine that  the sun will traverse the same parts of the sky, as it did when he saw it on the preceding  day; in other words, he will imagine a complete day, and, together with his imagination of  the morning, he will imagine Peter; with noon, he will imagine Paul; and with evening, he  will imagine Simon--that is, he will imagine the existence of Paul and Simon in relation to a future time; on the other hand, if he sees Simon in the evening, he will refer Peter and Paul  to a past time, by imagining them simultaneously with the imagination of a past time.  If it should at any time happen, that on some other evening the child should see James instead  of Simon, he will, on the following morning, associate with his imagination of evening  sometimes Simon, sometimes James, not both together:  for the child is supposed to have  seen, at evening, one or other of them, not both together.  His imagination will therefore  waver; and, with the imagination of future evenings, he will associate first one, then the  other--that is, he will imagine them in the future, neither of them as certain, but both as  contingent.  This wavering of the imagination will be the same, if the imagination be  concerned with things which we thus contemplate, standing in relation to time past or time  present:  consequently, we may imagine things as contingent, whether they be referred to  time present, past, or future.  <<<<<Corollary II--It is in the nature of reason to perceive things under a certain form of  eternity (sub quadam aeternitatis specie).  >>>>>Proof--It is in the nature of reason to regard things, not as contingent, but as  necessary (II. xliv.).  Reason perceives this necessity of things (II. xli.) truly--that is (I. Ax.  vi.), as it is in itself.  But (I. xvi.) this necessity of things is the very necessity of the eternal  nature of God; therefore, it is in the nature of reason to regard things under this form of eternity.  We may add that the bases of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/920"],["title","Ethics â€” Part 2 (#8)"],["body","are the notions (II. xxxviii.), which answer  to things common to all, and which (II. xxxvii.) do not answer to the essence of any  particular thing:  which must therefore be conceived without any relation to time, under a  certain form of eternity.  XLV. Every idea of every body, or of every particular thing actually existing, necessarily  involves the eternal and infinite essence of God.  >>>>>Proof--The idea of a particular thing actually existing necessarily involves both the  existence and the essence of the said thing (II. viii.).  Now particular things cannot be conceived without God (I. xv.); but, inasmuch as (II. vi.) they have God for their cause,  in so far as he is regarded under the attribute of which the things in question are modes,  their ideas must necessarily involve (I. Ax. iv.) the conception of the attributes of those  ideas--that is (I. vi.), the eternal and infinite essence of God.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--By existence I do not here mean duration--that is, existence in so far as it is  conceived abstractedly, and as a certain form of quantity.  I am speaking of the very nature  of existence, which is assigned to particular things, because they follow in infinite numbers  and in infinite ways from the eternal necessity of God's nature (I. xvi.).  I am speaking, I  repeat, of the very existence of particular things, in so far as they are in God.  For although  each particular thing be conditioned by another particular thing to exist in a given way, yet  the force whereby each particular thing perseveres in existing follows from the eternal  necessity of God's nature (cf. I. xxiv. Cor.).  XLVI.  The knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God which every idea  involves is adequate and perfect.  >>>>>Proof--The proof of the last proposition is universal; and whether a thing be  considered as a part or a whole, the idea thereof, whether of the whole or of a part (by  the last Prop.), will involve God's eternal and infinite essence.  Wherefore, that, which  gives knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God, is common to all, and is equally  in the part and in the whole; therefore (II. xxxviii.) this knowledge will be adequate.  Q.E.D.  XLVII. The human mind has an adequate knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of  God.  >>>>>Proof--The human mind has ideas (II. xxii.), from which (II. xxiii.) it perceives  itself and its own body (II. xix.) and external bodies (II. xvi. Cor. i. and II. xvii.) as actually existing; therefore (II. xlv. and xlvi.) it has an adequate knowledge of the eternal and  infinite essence of God.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--Hence we see, that the infinite essence and the eternity of God are known to  all.  Now as all things are in God, and are conceived through God, we can from this  knowledge infer many things, which we may adequately know, and we may form that third  kind of knowledge of which we spoke in the note to II. xl., and of the excellence and use of  which we shall have occasion to speak in Part V.  Men have not so clear a knowledge of  God as they have of general notions, because they are unable to imagine God as they do  bodies, and also because they have associated the name God with images of things that  they are in the habit of seeing, as indeed they can hardly avoid doing, being, as they are,  men, and continually affected by external bodies.  Many errors, in truth, can be traced to  this head, namely, that we do not apply names to things rightly.  For instance, when a man  says that the lines drawn from the centre of a circle to its circumference are not equal, he  then, at all events, assuredly attaches a meaning to the word circle different from that  assigned by mathematicians.  So again, when men make mistakes in calculation, they have  one set of figures in their mind, and another on the paper.  If we could see into their minds,  they do not make a mistake; they seem to do so, because we think, that they have the same  numbers in their mind as they have on the paper.  If this were not so, we should not  believe them to be in error, any more than I thought that a man was in error, whom I lately  heard exclaiming that his entrance hall had flown into a neighbour's hen, for his meaning  seemed to me sufficiently clear.  Very many controversies have arisen from the fact, that  men do not rightly explain their meaning, or do not rightly interpret the meaning of others.   For, as a matter of fact, as they flatly contradict themselves, they assume now one side,  now another, of the argument, so as to oppose the opinions, which they consider mistaken  and absurd in their opponents.  XLVIII. In the mind there is no absolute or free will; but the mind is determined to wish  this or that by a cause, which has also been determined by another cause, and this last by  another cause, and so on to infinity.  >>>>>Proof--The mind is a fixed and definite mode of thought (II. xi.), therefore it cannot  be the free cause of its actions (I. xvii. Cor. ii.); in other words, it cannot have an absolute faculty of positive or negative volition; but (by I. xxviii.) it must be determined by a cause,  which has also been determined by another cause, and this last by another, &c.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--In the same way it is proved, that there is in the mind no absolute faculty of  understanding, desiring, loving, &c. Whence it follows, that these and similar faculties are  either entirely fictitious, or are merely abstract and general terms, such as we are  accustomed to put together from particular things.  Thus the intellect and the will stand in  the same relation to this or that idea, or this or that volition, as \"lapidity\" to this or that  stone, or as \"man\" to Peter and Paul.  The cause which leads men to consider themselves  free has been set forth in the Appendix to Part I.  But, before I proceed further, I would  here remark that, by the will to affirm and decide, I mean the faculty, not the desire.  I  mean, I repeat, the faculty, whereby the mind affirms or denies what is true or false, not  the desire, wherewith the mind wishes for or turns away from any given thing.  After we  have proved, that these faculties of ours are general notions, which cannot be distinguished  from the particular instances on which they are based, we must inquire whether volitions  themselves are anything besides the ideas of things.  We must inquire, I say, whether there  is in the mind any affirmation or negation beyond that, which the idea, in so far as it is an  idea, involves.  On which subject see the following proposition, and II. Def. iii., lest the  idea of pictures should suggest itself.  For by ideas I do not mean images such as are  formed at the back of the eye, or in the midst of the brain, but the conceptions of thought.  XLIX. There is in the mind no volition or affirmation and negation, save that which an  idea, inasmuch as it is an idea, involves.  >>>>>Proof--There is in the mind no absolute faculty of positive or negative volition, but  only particular volitions, namely, this or that affirmation, and this or that negation.  Now let  us conceive a particular volition, namely, the mode of thinking whereby the mind affirms,  that the three interior angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles.  This affirmation involves the conception or idea of a triangle, that is, without the idea of a triangle it cannot  be conceived.  It is the same thing to say, that the concept A must involve the concept B,  as it is to say, that A cannot be conceived without B.  Further, this affirmation cannot be  made (II. Ax. iii.) without the idea of a triangle.  Therefore, this affirmation can neither be  nor be conceived, without the idea of a triangle.  Again, this idea of a triangle must involve  this same affirmation, namely, that its three interior angles are equal to two right angles. Wherefore, and vice versa, this idea of a triangle can neither be nor be conceived without  this affirmation, therefore, this affirmation belongs to the essence of the idea of a triangle, and is nothing besides.  What we have said of this volition (inasmuch as we have selected  it at random) may be said of any other volition, namely, that it is nothing but an idea.   Q.E.D.  <<<<<Corollary--Will and understanding are one and the same.  >>>>>Proof--Will and understanding are nothing beyond the individual volitions and ideas  (II. xlviii. and note).  But a particular volition and a particular idea are one and the same (by the foregoing Prop.); therefore, will and understanding are one and the same.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--We have thus removed the cause which is commonly assigned for error.  For  we have shown above, that falsity consists solely in the privation of knowledge involved in  ideas which are fragmentary and confused.  Wherefore, a false idea, inasmuch as it is false,  does not involve certainty.  When we say, then, that a man acquiesces in what is false, and  that he has no doubts on the subject, we do not say that he is certain, but only that he does  not doubt, or that he acquiesces in what is false, inasmuch as there are no reasons, which  should cause his imagination to waver (see II. xliv. note).  Thus, although the man be  assumed to acquiesce in what is false, we shall never say that he is certain.  For by certainty  we mean something positive (II. xliii. and note), not merely the absence of doubt.  However, in order that the foregoing proposition may be fully explained, I will draw  attention to a few additional points, and I will furthermore answer the objections which  may be advanced against our doctrine.  Lastly, in order to remove every scruple, I have  thought it worth while to point out some of the advantages, which follow therefrom.  I say  \"some,\" for they will be better appreciated from what we shall set forth in the fifth part.  I begin, then, with the first point, and warn my readers to make an accurate distinction  between an idea, or conception of the mind,"]]]
