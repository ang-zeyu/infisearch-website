I have read that years ago someone was appointed to defend Old Nick when the others were pitching into him, and to show that he was not as black as he was painted, but was a respectable gentleman who had been maligned by the world.\"  \"No doubt there is a good deal to be said for him,\" O'Grady said, seriously. \"Give a dog a bad name, you know, and you may hang him; and I have no doubt the Old One has been held responsible for lots of things he never had as much as the tip of his finger in at all, at all.\"  Seeing that his captain was about to pursue the matter much further, Terence, making the excuse that it was time he went down to see if the men's breakfast was all right, slipped off, and he and Dick Ryan had a hearty laugh over O'Grady's peculiarities.  \"I think, O'Grady,\" Captain O'Driscol said, two days later, \"we are going to have our opportunity, for unless I am mistaken there is going to be a change of weather. Those clouds banking up ahead look like a gale from the southwest.\"  Before night the wind was blowing furiously, and the _Sea-horse_ taking green sea over her bows and wallowing gunwale under in the waves. At daylight, when they went on deck, gray masses of cloud were hurrying overhead and an angry sea alone met the eye. Not a sail was in sight, and the whole convoy had vanished.  \"We are out of sight of the fleet, O'Grady,\" Captain O'Driscol said, grimly.  \"I felt sure we should be,\" O'Grady said, triumphantly. \"Sorra one of them could keep foot with us.\"  \"They are ahead of us, man,\" O'Driscol said, angrily; \"miles and miles ahead.\"  \"Ahead, is it? You must know better, O'Driscol; though it is little enough you know of ships. You see we are close-hauled, and there is no doubt that that is the vessel's strong point. Why, we have dropped the rest of them like hot potatoes, and if this little breeze keeps on, maybe we shall be in the Tagus days and days before them.\"  O'Driscol was too exasperated to argue.  \"O'Driscol is a good fellow,\" O'Grady said, turning to Terence, \"but it is a misfortune that he is so prejudiced. Now, what is your own opinion?\"  \"I have no opinion about it, Captain O'Grady. I have a very strong opinion that I am not going to enjoy my breakfast, and that this motion does not agree with me at all. I have been ill half the night. Dick Ryan is awfully bad, and by the sounds I heard I should say a good many of the others are the same way. On the main deck it is awful; they have got the hatches battened down. I just took a peep in and bolted, for it seemed to me that everyone was ill.\"  \"The best plan, lad, is to make up your mind that you are quite well. If you once do that you will be all right directly.\"  Terence could not for the moment reply, having made a sudden rush to the side.  \"I don't see how I can persuade myself that I am quite well,\" he said, when he returned, \"when I feel terribly ill.\"  \"Yes, it wants resolution, Terence, and I am afraid that you are deficient in that. It must not be half-and-half. You have got to say to yourself, 'This is glorious; I never enjoyed myself so well in my life,' and when you have said that and feel that it is quite true, the whole thing will be over.\"  \"I don't doubt it in the least,\" Terence said; \"but I can't say it without telling a prodigious lie, and worse still, I could not believe the lie when I had told it.\"  \"Then I am afraid that you must submit to be ill, Terence. I know once that I had a drame, and the drame was that I was at sea and horribly sea-sick, and I woke up and said to myself, 'This is all nonsense, I am as well as ever I was;' and, faith, so I was.\"  Ill as Terence was, he burst into a fit of laughter.  \"That was just a dream, Captain O'Grady; but mine is a reality, you know. I don't think that you are looking quite well yourself.\"  \"I am perfectly well as far as the sea goes, Terence; never was better in my life; but that pork we had for dinner yesterday was worse than usual, and I think perhaps I ought to have taken another glass or two to correct it.\"  \"It must have been the pork,\" Terence said, as seriously as O'Grady himself; \"and it is unfortunate that you are such an abstemious man, or, as you say, its effects might have been corrected.\"  \"It's me opinion, Terence, my boy, that you are a humbug.\"  \"Then, Captain O'Grady, it is clear that evil communications must have corrupted my good manners.\"  \"It must have been in your infancy then, Terence, for divil a bit of manners good or bad have I ever seen in you; you have not even the good manners to take a glass of the cratur when you are asked.\"  \"That is true enough,\" Terence laughed. \"Having been brought up in the regiment, I have learned, at least, that the best thing to do with whisky is to leave it alone.\"  \"I am afraid you will never be a credit to us, Terence.\"  \"Not in the way of being able to make a heavy night of it and then turn out as fresh as paint in the morning,\" Terence retorted; \"but you see, Captain O'Grady, even my abstinence has its advantages, for at least there will always be one officer in the corps able to go the round of the sentries at night.\"  At this moment the vessel gave such a heavy lurch that they were both thrown off their feet and rolled into the lee-scuppers, while, at the same moment, a rush of water swept over them. Amidst shouts of laughter from the other officers the two scrambled to their feet.   [Illustration: TWO FRENCH PRIVATEERS BEAR DOWN UPON THE _SEA-HORSE_]   \"Holy Moses!\" O'Grady exclaimed, \"I am drowned entirely, and I sha'n't get the taste of the salt water out of me mouth for a week.\"  \"There is one comfort,\" Terence said; \"it might have been worse.\"  \"How could it have been worse?\" O'Grady asked, angrily.  \"Why, if we hadn't been in the steadiest ship in the whole fleet we might have been washed overboard.\"  There was another shout of laughter. O'Grady made a dash at Terence, but the latter easily avoided him and went down below to change his clothes.  The gale increased in strength, and the whole vessel strained so heavily that her seams began to open, and by one o'clock the captain requested Major Harrison, who was in command, to put some of the soldiers at the pumps. For three days and nights relays of men kept the pumps going. Had it not been for the 400 troops on board, the _Sea-horse_ would long before have gone to the bottom; but with such powerful aid the water was kept under, and on the morning of the fourth day the storm began to abate, and by evening more canvas was got on her. The next morning two vessels were seen astern at a distance of four or five miles. After examining them through his glass, the captain sent down a message to Major Harrison asking him to come up. In three or four minutes that officer appeared.  \"There are two strange craft over there, Major; from their appearance I have not the least doubt that they are French privateers. I thought I should like your advice as to what had best be done.\"  \"I don't know. You see, your guns might just as well be thrown overboard for any good they would be,\" the major said. \"The things would not be safe to fire a salute with blank cartridge.\"  \"No, they can hardly be called serviceable,\" the master agreed. \"I spoke to the owner about it, but he said that as we were going to sail with a convoy it did not matter, and that we should have some others for the next voyage.\"  \"I should like to see your owner dangling from the yardarm,\" the major said, wrathfully. \"However, just at present the question is what had best be done. Of course they could not take the ship from us, but they would have very little difficulty in sinking her.\"  \"The first thing is to put on every stitch of sail.\"  \"That would avail us nothing; they can sail two feet to our one.\"  \"Quite so, Major; I should not hope to get away, but they would think that I was trying to do so. My idea is that we should press on as fast as we can till they open fire at us; we could hold on for a bit, and then haul up into the wind and lower our top-sails, which they will take for a proof of surrender.\"  \"You won't strike the flag, Captain; we cannot do anything treacherous.\"  \"No, no, I am not thinking of doing that. You see, the flag is not hoisted yet, and we won't hoist it at all till they get close alongside, then we can haul it up, and sweep their decks with musketry. Of course your men will keep below until the last moment.\"  \"That plan will do very well,\" the major agreed, \"that is, if they venture to come boldly alongside.\"  \"One is pretty sure to do so, though the other may lay herself ahead or astern of us, with her guns pointed to rake us in case we make any resistance; but seeing what we are, and that we carry only four small guns each side, they are hardly likely to suspect anything wrong. I am not at all afraid of beating them off; my only fear is that after they have sheared away they will open upon us from a distance.\"  \"Yes, that would be awkward. However, if they do, we must keep the men below, and in the meantime you had better get your carpenter to cut up some spars and make a lot of plugs in readiness to stop up any holes they make near the water-line. I don't think they are likely to make very ragged holes, the wood is so rotten the shot would go through the side as if it were brown paper; still, you might get a lot of squares of canvas ready, with hammers and nails.\"  The strange craft were already heading towards the _Sea-horse._ No time was lost in setting every stitch of canvas that she could carry; the wind was light now, but the vessel was rolling heavily in a long swell. The major examined the guns closely and found that they were even worse than he had anticipated, the rust holes eaten in the iron having been filled up with putty, and the whole painted. He was turning away, with an exclamation of disgust, when Terence, who was standing near, said to him:  \"I beg your pardon,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8651"],["title","With Moore at Corunna (#5)"],["body"," Major, but don't you think that if we were to wind some thin rope very tightly round them three or four inches thick, they might stand a charge or two of grape to give them at close quarters; we needn't put in a very heavy charge of powder. Even if they did burst, I should think that the rope would prevent the splinters from flying about.\"  \"The idea is not a bad one at all, Terence. I will see if the captain has got a coil or two of thin rope on board.\"  Fortunately the ship was fairly well supplied in this respect, and a few of the sailors who were accustomed to serving rope, with a dozen soldiers to help them, were told off to the work. The rope was wound round as tightly as the strength of a dozen men could pull it, the process being repeated five or six times, until each gun was surrounded by as many layers of rope. A thin rod had been inserted in the touch-hole. The cannon was then loaded with half the usual charge of powder, and filled to the muzzle with bullets. The rod was then drawn out, and powder poured in until it reached the surface.  While this was being done, all the soldiers not engaged in the work went below, and the officers sat down under shelter of the bulwarks. The two privateers, a large lugger and a brig, had been coming up rapidly, and by the time the guns were ready for action they were but a mile away. Presently a puff of smoke burst out from the bows of the lugger, and a round shot struck the water a short distance ahead of the _Sea-horse_. She held on her course without taking any notice of it, and for a few minutes the privateer was silent; then, when they were but half a mile away the brig opened fire, and two or three shots hulled the vessel.  \"That will do, Captain,\" the major said. \"You may as well lay-to now.\"  The _Sea-horse_ rapidly flew up into the wind, the sheets were thrown off, and the upper sails were lowered, one after the other, the job being executed slowly, as if by a weak crew. The two privateers, which had been sailing within a short distance of each other, now exchanged signals, and the lugger ran on, straight towards the _Sea-horse_, while the brig took a course which would lay her across the stern of the barque, and enable them to rake her with her broadside. Word was passed below, and the soldiers poured up on deck, stooping as they reached it, and taking their places under the bulwarks. The major had already asked for volunteers among the officers, to fire the guns. All had at once offered to do so.  \"As it was your proposal, Terence,\" the major said, \"you shall have the honour of firing one; Ryan, you take another; Lieutenant Marks and Mr. Haines, you take the other two, and then England and Ireland will be equally represented.\"  The deck of the lugger was crowded with men, and the course she was steering brought her within a length of the _Sea-horse_. Some of the men were preparing to lower her boats, when suddenly a thick line of red coats appeared above the bulwarks, two hundred muskets poured in their fire, while the contents of the four guns swept her deck. The effect of the fire was tremendous. The deck was in a moment covered with dead and dying men; half a minute later another volley, fired by the remaining companies, completed the work of destruction. The halliards of one of the lugger's sails had been cut by the grape, and the sail now came down with a run to the deck.  \"Down below, all of you,\" the major shouted, \"the fellow behind will rake us in a minute.\"  The soldiers ran down to the hold again. A minute later the brig, sailing across the stern, poured in the fire of her guns one by one. Standing much lower in the water than her opponent, none of her shot traversed the deck of the _Sea-horse_, but they carried destruction among the cabins and fittings of the deck below. As this, however, was entirely deserted, no one was injured by the shot or flying fragments. The brig then took up her position three or four hundred yards away, on the quarter of the _Sea-horse_, and opened a steady fire against her.  To this the barque could make no reply, the fire of the muskets being wholly ineffective at that distance. The lugger lay helpless alongside the _Sea-horse_; the survivors of her crew had run below, and dared not return on deck to work their guns, as they would have been swept by the musketry of the _Sea-horse_.  Half an hour later Terence was ordered to go below to see how they were getting on in the hold.  Terence did so. Some lanterns had been lighted there, and he found that four men had been killed and a dozen or so wounded by the enemy's shot, the greater portion of which, however, had gone over their heads. The carpenter, assisted by some of the non-commissioned officers, was busy plugging holes that had been made in her between wind and water, and had fairly succeeded, as but four or five shots had struck so low, the enemy's object being not to sink, but to capture the vessel. As he passed up through the main deck to report, Terence saw that the destruction here was great indeed. The woodwork of the cabins had been knocked into fragments, there was a great gaping hole in the stern, and it seemed to him that before long the vessel would be knocked to pieces. He returned to the deck, and reported the state of things.  \"It looks bad,\" the major said to O'Driscol. \"This is but half an hour's work, and when the fellows come to the conclusion that they cannot make us strike, they will aim lower, and there will be nothing to do but to choose between sinking and hauling down our flag.\"  After delivering his report, Terence went to the side of the ship and looked down on the lugger. The attraction of the ship had drawn her closer to it, and she was but a few feet away. A thought struck him, and he went to O'Grady.  \"Look here, O'Grady,\" he said, \"that fellow will smash us up altogether if we don't do something.\"  \"You must be a bright boy to see that, Terence; faith, I have been thinking so for the last ten minutes. But what are we to do? The muskets won't carry so far, at least not to do any good. The cannon are next to useless. Two of that lot you fired burst, though the ropes prevented any damage being done.\"  \"Quite so, but there are plenty of guns alongside. Now, if you go to the major and volunteer to take your company and gain possession of the lugger, with one of the mates and half a dozen sailors to work her, we can get up the main-sail and engage the brig.\"  \"By the powers, Terence, you are a broth of a boy,\" and he hurried away to the major.  \"Major,\" he said, \"if you will give me leave, I will have up my company and take possession of the lugger; we shall want one of the ship's officers and half a dozen men to work the sails, and then we will go out and give that brig pepper.\"  \"It is a splendid idea, O'Grady.\"  \"It is not my idea at all, at all; it is Terence O'Connor who suggested it to me. I suppose I can take the lad with me?\"  \"By all means, get your company up at once.\"  O'Grady hurried away, and in a minute the men of his company poured up onto the deck.  \"You can come with me, Terence; I have the major's leave,\" he said to the lad.  At this moment there was a slight shock, as the lugger came in contact with the ship.  \"Come on, lads,\" O'Grady said, as he set the example of clambering down onto the deck of the lugger. He was followed by his men, the first mate and six sailors also springing on board. The hatches were first put on to keep the remnant of the crew below. The sailors knotted the halliards of the main-sail, the soldiers tailed on to the rope, and the sail was rapidly run up. The mate put two of his men at the tiller, and the soldiers ran to the guns, which were already loaded.  \"Haul that sheet to windward,\" the mate shouted, and the four sailors, aided by some of the soldiers, did so. Her head soon payed off, and amid a cheer from the officers on deck the lugger swept round. She mounted twelve guns. O'Grady divided the officers and non-commissioned officers among them, himself taking charge of a long pivot-gun in the bow.  \"Take stiddy aim, boys, and fire as your guns bear on her; you ought not to throw away a shot at this distance.\"  As the lugger came out from behind the Sea-horse, gun after gun was fired, and the white splinters on the side of the brig showed that most, if not all, of the shots had taken effect. O'Grady's gun was the last to speak out, and the shot struck the brig just above the water-line.  \"Take her round,\" he shouted to the mate; \"give the boys on the other side a chance.\" The lugger put about and her starboard guns poured in their contents.  \"That is the way,\" he shouted, as he laboured away with the men with him to load the pivot-gun again; \"we will give him two or three more rounds, and then we will get alongside and ask for his health.\"  The brig, however, showed no inclination to await the attack. Some shots had been hastily fired when the lugger's first gun told them that she was now an enemy, and she at once put down her helm and made off before the wind, which was now very light.  \"Load your guns and then out with the oars,\" Captain O'Grady shouted. \"Be jabers, we will have that fellow. Let no man attend to the _Sea-horse_; it's from me that you are to take your orders. Besides,\" he said to Terence, \"there is no signal-book on board, and they may hoist as many flags as they like.\"  The twelve sweeps on board the lugger were at once got out, and each manned by three soldiers. O'Grady himself continued to direct the fire of the pivot-gun, and sent shot after shot into the brig's stern. The latter had but some four hundred yards' start, and although she also hurriedly got out some sweeps, the lugger gained upon her. Her crew clustered on their taffrail, and kept up a musketry fire upon the party working the pivot-gun. Two of these had been killed and four wounded, when O'Grady said to the others:  \"Lave the gun alone, boys; we shall be alongside of her in a few minutes; it is no use"]]]
