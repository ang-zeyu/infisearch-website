Whip the remaining pint of cream, add one-half of it to the frozen mixture, repack and stand aside to ripen. Blanch, dry and chop the almonds. Put them in the oven and shake constantly until they are a golden brown. At serving time, fill the frozen mixture quickly into paper cases; have the remaining whipped cream in a pastry bag with star tube, make a little rosette on the top of each case, dust thickly with the chopped almonds, and send to the table.  This will fill twelve cases of ordinary size.   BISCUITS GLACÉS       1 pint of cream    3/4 pound of sugar      1 pint of water      1 gill of sherry      2 tablespoonfuls of brandy      1 teaspoonful of vanilla        Yolks of six eggs  Put the sugar and water in a saucepan over the fire and stir until the sugar is dissolved; wipe down the sides of the pan, and boil until the syrup spins a heavy thread or makes a soft ball when dropped into cold water. Beat the yolks of the eggs to a cream, add them to the boiling syrup, and with an egg beater whisk over the fire until you have a custard-like mixture that will thickly coat a knife blade; strain through a sieve into a bowl, and whisk until the mixture is stiff and cold. It should look like a very light sponge cake batter. Add the flavoring. Whip the cream and stir it carefully into the mixture. Fill the mixture into paper cases or individual dishes, stand them in a freezing cave or in a tin bucket that is well packed in salt and ice, cover and freeze for at least four or five hours.  If you do not have a freezing cave, pack a good sized tin kettle in a small tub or water bucket. The kettle must have a tight fitting lid. Stand your cases or molds on the bottom of the tin kettle, which is packed in salt and ice. Put on top a sheet of letter paper, on top of this another other layer of molds or cases, and so continue until you have the kettle filled. Put the lid on the kettle and cover with salt and ice. Make sure that you have a hole half-way up in the packing bucket or tub, so that there is no danger of salt water overflowing the kettle. This is a homely but very good freezing cave.  At serving time, dust the tops of the biscuits with grated macaroons or chopped almonds, dish on paper mats, and send to the table.  This will fill fifteen biscuit cases.   BISCUITS à la MARIE     1/2 pound of sugar      1 pint of water    1/2 pint of cream    1/2 pound of almond macaroons    1/4 pound of candied or Maraschino cherries      1 teaspoonful of bitter almond extract        Yolks of six eggs  Boil the sugar and water until the syrup will spin a heavy thread. Add the eggs, beaten until very light. Whip this over the fire for three minutes, take it from the fire, strain into a bowl, and whip until thick and cold. Add the flavoring and the macaroons, that have been dried, grated and sifted. Add the cream, whipped. Fill the mixture into paper cases, and freeze as directed for Biscuits Glacés.  An extra half pint of cream may be whipped for garnish at serving time, if desired; otherwise, garnish the top with chopped maraschino cherries, and send to the table.  This will fill twelve biscuit cases.   BOMB GLACÉ  Pack a two quart bomb glacé mold in salt and ice. Remove the lid, and line the mold with a quart of well-made vanilla ice cream. Fill the centre with one half the recipe for Biscuit Glacé mixture, that has been packed in a freezer until icy cold. Put on the lid, bind the edge with a piece of muslin dipped in paraffin or suet, cover the mold with salt and ice, and stand aside three hours to freeze.  This will serve twelve persons.   BISCUIT TORTONI       1 quart of cream    1/2 pound of sugar      1 gill of maraschino      2 tablespoonfuls of sherry      1 teaspoonful of vanilla        Yolks of six eggs  Put half the cream in a double boiler over the fire. Beat the sugar and yolks together until very, very light, add them to the hot cream and stir over the fire until the mixture begins to thicken. Take from the fire, and, when very cold, add the vanilla, maraschino and sherry, and freeze. When frozen, stir in the remaining cream, whipped to a stiff froth.

Cut the sponge cake into slices and then into strips. Put the milk over the fire in a double boiler and add the eggs and sugar beaten together until light; stir and cook until the mixture is sufficiently thick to coat a knife blade. Take from the fire, add the gelatin, strain, and stand it aside to cool. Garnish the bottom of a two quart melon mold with the cherries or pineapple, put in a layer of the sponge cake, then a sprinkling of the macaroons and lady fingers, another layer of the cherries, then the sponge cake, and so continue until you have all the ingredients used. Add a teaspoonful of vanilla to the custard, pour it in the mold, cover the mold with the lid, bind the seam with muslin dipped in paraffin or suet, pack in salt and ice, and stand aside for three hours.

Make a plain frozen custard, and flavor it with vanilla; pack it and stand it aside until serving time. Cut off the top of the cake, take out the centre, leaving a bottom and wall one inch thick. At serving time, fill the cake quickly with the frozen custard, replace the top, dust it thickly with powdered sugar and chopped almonds, and send it to the table with a sauceboat of cold Montrose Sauce.  This cake may be varied by using different garnishings. Maraschino cherries may be used in place of almonds, or the base of the cake may be garnished with preserved green walnuts or green gages, or the top and sides may be garnished with rosettes of whipped cream.  This will serve twelve persons.   QUICK CARAMEL PARFAIT  Make a quart of Caramel Ice Cream, pack, and stand it aside for two hours.

NESSELRODE PUDDING       1"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8501"],["title","Ice Creams, Water Ices, Frozen Puddings Together with Refreshments for all (#4)"],["body","of Spanish chestnuts    1/2 pound of sugar      1 pint of boiling water    1/2 pint of shelled almonds      1 pound of French candied fruit, mixed      1 pint of heavy cream    1/4 pound of candied pineapple        Yolks of six eggs  Shell the chestnuts, scald and remove the brown skins, cover with boiling water and boil until they are tender, not too soft, and press them through a sieve. Shell, blanch and pound the almonds. Cut the fruit into tiny pieces. Put the sugar and water in a saucepan, stir until the sugar is dissolved, wipe down the sides of the pan, and boil without stirring until the syrup forms a soft ball when dropped into ice water. Beat the yolks of the eggs until very light, add them to the boiling syrup, and stir over the fire until the mixture again boils; take it from the fire, and with an ordinary egg beater, whisk the mixture until it is cold and thick as sponge cake batter. Add the fruit, the chestnuts, almond paste, a teaspoonful of vanilla and, if you use it, four tablespoonfuls of sherry. Turn the mixture into the freezer, and, when it is frozen, stir in the cream whipped to a stiff froth. The mixture may now be repacked in the can, or it may be put into small molds or one large mold, and repacked for ripening.  If packed in a large mold, this will serve fifteen persons; in the small molds or paper cases, it will serve eighteen persons.   NESSELRODE PUDDING, AMERICANA       1 small bottle, or sixteen preserved marrons      1 quart of cream      4 ounces of sugar      4 tablespoonfuls of sherry      1 tablespoonful of vanilla        Yolks of six eggs  Put half the cream in a double boiler over the fire; when hot, add the eggs and sugar beaten until light. Cook a minute, and cool. When cold, add one small bottle of marrons broken into quarters and the syrup from the bottle, the sherry and vanilla. Freeze, stirring slowly. When frozen, stir in the remaining cream whipped to a stiff froth. Pack in small molds in salt and ice as directed. These should freeze three hours at least.  This will make twelve small molds.   ORANGE SOUFFLÉ       1 quart of cream      1 pint of orange juice    1/2 box of gelatin    3/4 pound of sugar        Yolks of six eggs  Cover the gelatin with a half cupful of cold water and soak for a half hour. Add a half cupful of boiling water, stir until the gelatin is dissolved, and add the sugar and the orange juice. Beat the yolks of the eggs until very light. Whip the cream. Add the uncooked yolks to the orange mixture, strain in the gelatin, stand the bowl in cold water and stir slowly until the mixture begins to thicken; stir in carefully the whipped cream, turn it in a mold or an ice cream freezer, pack with salt and ice, and stand aside three hours to freeze. This should not be frozen as hard as ice cream, and must not be stirred while freezing. Make sure, however, that the gelatin is thoroughly mixed with the other ingredients before putting the mixture into the freezer.  This will serve twelve people.  By changing the flavoring, using lemon in the place of orange, or a pint of strawberry juice, or a pint of raspberry and currant juice, an endless variety of soufflés may be made from this same recipe. These may be served plain, or with Montrose Sauce.   PLOMBIERE       1 quart of cream    1/2 pound of Jordan almonds    1/2 pound of sugar    1/2 pound of Sultana raisins        Yolks of six eggs  Blanch the almonds and pound them to a paste, or use a half pound of ordinary almond paste. Put half the cream in a double boiler over the fire, add the yolks and sugar beaten to a cream, add the almond paste. Stir until the mixture begins to thicken, take from the fire and beat with an egg beater for three minutes. Strain through a fine sieve, and, when very cold, add the Sultanas and the remaining cream. Freeze, turning the dasher very slowly at first and more rapidly toward the end. Remove the dasher, scrape down the sides of the can and pull the cream up, making a well in the centre. Fill this well half full with apricot jam, cover over the pudding mixture, making it smooth; repack, and stand aside for two hours.  Serve plain or with a cold Purée of Apricots.  This will serve twelve persons.   QUEEN PUDDING  Make a Strawberry Water Ice or Frozen Strawberries. Pack a three quart mold in a bucket or tub of ice and salt. Line the mold with the Strawberry Ice, fill the centre with Tutti Frutti, using half recipe; put on the lid, bind the seam, and stand aside for at least two hours. When ready to serve, turn the pudding from the mold into the centre of a large round dish, garnish the base with whipped cream pressed through a star tube, and garnish the pudding with candied cherries. Here and there around the base of the whipped cream place a marron glacé.  This will serve fifteen persons.   ICE CREAM CROQUETTES  Mold vanilla ice cream with the ordinary pyramid ice cream spoon, roll them quickly in grated macaroons, and serve on a paper mat.   ICED RICE PUDDING WITH A COMPOTE OF ORANGES   FOR THE PUDDING     1/2 cupful of rice      1 quart of cream      1 pint of milk      2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla extract or 1/2 vanilla bean    1/2 pound of sugar        Yolks of six eggs  Rub the rice in a dry towel, and put it over the fire in a pint of cold water. Bring to a boil and boil twenty minutes; drain, add the milk and cook it in a double boiler a half hour. While this is boiling, whip the cream to a stiff froth, and stand it in a cold place until wanted. Press the rice through a fine sieve and return it to the double boiler. Beat the yolks of the eggs and the sugar until light, stir them into the hot rice, and stir and cook about two minutes, until the mixture begins to thicken. Take from the fire, add the vanilla, and stand aside until very cold. When cold, freeze, turning the dasher rapidly toward the last. Remove the dasher and stir in the whipped cream. Scrape down the sides of the can, and smooth the pudding. Put on the lid, fasten the hole in the top with a cork, put over the top a piece of waxed paper, and pack with salt and ice. Stand aside for at least two or three hours. Be very careful that the hole in the tub is open, to prevent the salt water from overflowing the can.  FOR THE COMPOTE       1 dozen nice oranges      1 pound of sugar    1/2 cupful of water      1 teaspoonful of lemon juice  Put the sugar and water over the fire to boil, wipe down the sides of the pan, skim the syrup, add the lemon juice, and boil until it spins a thread. Peel the oranges, cut them into halves crosswise, and with a sharp knife remove the cores. Dip one piece at a time into the hot syrup and place them on a platter to cool. Pour over any syrup that may be left.  This syrup must be thick, but not sufficiently thick to harden on the oranges.  To dish the pudding, lift the can from the ice, wipe it carefully on the outside, wrap the bottom of the mold in a towel dipped in boiling water, or hold it half an instant under the cold water spigot. Then with a limber knife or spatula loosen the pudding from the side of the can and shake it out into the centre of a large round plate. Heap the oranges on top of the pudding, making them in a pyramid, put the remaining quantity around the base of the pudding, pour over the syrup and send to the table. This pudding sounds elaborate and troublesome, but it is exceedingly palatable and one of the handsomest of all frozen dishes.  This will serve twenty persons. In ice cream stem dishes it will serve twenty-four persons.   SULTANA ROLL   1-1/2 quarts of cream    1/2 pound of granulated sugar    1/2 cupful of Sultanas      4 tablespoonfuls of sherry      2 ounces of shelled pistachio nuts      1 teaspoonful of almond extract     10 drops of green coloring  Put one pint of cream and the sugar over the fire in a double boiler, and stir until the sugar is dissolved; take from the fire, and, when cold, add a pint of the remaining cream. Chop the pistachio nuts very fine or put them through the meat grinder, add them to the cream and add the flavoring and coloring, and freeze. Whip the remaining pint of cream to a stiff froth. Sprinkle the Sultanas with sherry and let them stand while you are freezing the pudding. When the pudding is frozen, remove the dasher and line a long round mold with the pistachio cream. If nothing better is at hand, use pound baking powder cans, and line them to the depth of one inch. Add the Sultanas to the whipped cream and stir in two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar. Fill the spaces in the cans with the whipped cream mixture, and put another layer of the pistachio cream over the top. Put on the lids, wrap each can in waxed paper, and put them down into coarse salt and ice, to freeze for at least two hours. At serving time, turn the puddings on to a long platter, fill the bottom of the platter with Claret or Strawberry Sauce, and send to the table.  This quantity cut into half inch slices will serve twelve persons.   SULTANA PUDDING       1 pint of milk      1 pint of cream      6 ounces of sugar      1 cupful of Sultanas      1 teaspoonful of vanilla      4 tablespoonfuls of sherry (if you use it)        Yolks of four eggs  Put the milk in a double boiler, and, when hot, add the yolks and sugar beaten together; stir until this begins to thicken. Take from the fire, add the vanilla, and, when cold, freeze it. Put the sherry over the Sultanas. Garnish the bottom of a melon mold with the Sultanas, pack it in coarse ice and salt ready for the frozen pudding. Remove the dasher from the frozen mixture, and stir in the cream that has been whipped to a stiff froth. Add the remainder of the Sultanas and pack at once into the mold; put on the lid and fasten as directed in other recipes.  This may be served plain or with whipped cream garnished with Sultanas.  This will serve eight persons.   THE MERRY WIDOW  Dish a pyramid of vanilla ice cream into a stem individual ice cream glass. Garnish the base of the ice cream with fresh"]]]
