If the reader has done me the honor to peruse the first volume of my memoirs, I indulge the vanity of supposing that he will like to be informed how I became a member of General Stuart’s staff.  When oaks crash down they are apt to prostrate the saplings growing around them. Jackson was a very tall oak, and I a very humble sapling. When the great trunk fell, the mere twig disappeared. I had served with Jackson from the beginning of the war; that king of battle dead at Chancellorsville, I had found myself without a commander, and without a home. I was not only called upon in that May of 1863, to mourn the illustrious soldier, who had done me the honor to call me his friend; I had also to look around me for some other general; some other position in the army.  I was revolving this important subject in my mind, when I received a note from General J.E.B. Stuart, Jackson’s friend and brother in arms. “Come and see me,” said this note. Forty-eight hours afterward I was at Stuart’s head-quarters, near Culpeper Court-House.  When I entered his tent, or rather breadth of canvas, stretched beneath a great oak, Stuart rose from the red blanket upon which he was lying, and held out his hand. As he gazed at me in silence I could see his face flush.  “You remind me of Jackson,” he said, retaining my hand and gazing fixedly at me.  I bowed my head, making no other reply; for the sight of Stuart brought back to me also many memories; the scouting of the Valley, the hard combats of the Lowland, Cold Harbor, Manassas, Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg, and that last greeting between Jackson and the great commander of the cavalry, on the weird moonlight night at Chancellorsville.  Stuart continued to gaze at me, and I could see his eyes slowly fill with tears.  “It is a national calamity!” he murmured. “Jackson’s loss is irreparable!”[1]  [Footnote 1: His words.]  He remained for a moment gazing into my face, then passing his hand over his forehead, he banished by a great effort these depressing memories. His bold features resumed their habitual cheerfulness.  Our dialogue was brief, and came rapidly to the point.  “Have you been assigned to duty yet, my dear Surry?”  “I have not, general.”  “Would you like to come with me?”  “More than with any general in the army, since Jackson’s death. You know I am sincere in saying that.”  “Thanks--then the matter can be very soon arranged, I think. I want another inspector-general, and want _you_.”  With these words Stuart seated himself at his desk, wrote a note, which, he dispatched by a courier to army head-quarters; and then throwing aside business, he began laughing and talking.  For once the supply of red tape in Richmond seemed temporarily exhausted. Stuart was Lee’s right hand, and when he made a request, the War Office deigned to listen. Four days afterward, I was seated under the canvas of a staff tent, when Stuart hastened up with boyish ardor, holding a paper.  “Here you are, old Surry,”--when he used the prefix “old” to any one’s name, he was always excellently well disposed toward them,--“the Richmond people are prompt this time. Here is your assignment--send for Sweeney and his banjo! He shall play ‘Jine the Cavalry!’ in honor of the occasion, Surry!”  You see now, my dear reader, how it happened that in June, 1863, Stuart beckoned to me, and gave me an order to transmit to General Mordaunt.     III.   BLUE AND GRAY PHANTOMS.   As I rode toward the Rappahannock to deliver Stuart’s order to General Mordaunt, the wide landscape was suddenly lit up by a crimson glare. I looked over my shoulder. The sun was poised upon the western woods, and resembled a huge bloodshot eye. Above it extended a long black cloud, like an eyebrow--and from the cloud issued low thunder.  When a storm is coming, the civilian seeks shelter; but the soldier carrying an order, wraps his cape around him, and rides on. I went on past Brandy and Fleetwood Hill, descended toward the river, entered a great belt of woods--then night and storm descended simultaneously. An artillery duel seemed going on in the clouds; the flickering lightnings amid the branches resembled serpents of fire: the wind rolled through the black wood, tearing off boughs in its passage.  I pushed my horse to full speed to emerge from this scene of crashing limbs and tottering trunks. I had just passed a little stream, when from a by-road on my left came the trample of hoofs. It is good to be on the watch in the cavalry, and I wheeled to the right, listening--when all at once a brilliant flash of lightning showed me, within fifty paces, a column of _blue_ cavalry.  “Halt!” rang out from the column, and a pistol-shot followed.  I did not halt. Capture was becoming a hideous affair in June, 1863. I passed across the head of the column at full speed, followed by bullets; struck into a bridle-path on the right, and pushed ahead, hotly pursued.  They had followed me nearly half a mile, firing on me, and ordering me to halt, when suddenly a sonorous “Halt!” resounded fifty yards in front of me; and a moment afterward, a carbine ball passed through my riding cape.  I drove on at full speed, convinced that these in front were friends; and the chest of my horse struck violently against that of another in the darkness.  “Halt, or you are dead!” came in the same commanding voice.  Another flash of lightning showed me a squadron of _gray_ cavalry: at their head rode a cavalier, well mounted; it was his horse against which I had struck, and he held a cocked pistol to my breast.  The lightning left nothing in doubt. Gray and blue quickly recognized each other. The blue cavalry had drawn rein, and, at that moment, the leader of the grays shouted--“Charge!” A rush of hoofs, and then a quick clash of sabres followed. The adversaries had hurled together. The wood suddenly became the scene of a violent combat.  It was a rough affair. For ten minutes the result was doubtful. The Federal cavalry were apparently commanded by an officer of excellent nerve, and he fought his men obstinately. For nearly a quarter of an hour the wood was full of sabre-strokes, carbine-shots, and yells, which mingled with the roll of the storm. Then the fight ended.  My friend of the cocked pistol threw himself, sabre in hand, upon the Federal front, and it shook, and gave back, and retreated. The weight of the onset seemed to sweep it, inch by inch, away. The blue squadron finally broke, and scattered in every direction. The grays pressed on with loud cheers, firing as they did so:--five minutes afterward, the storm-lashed wood had swallowed pursuers and pursued.  The whole had disappeared like phantom horsemen in the direction of the Rappahannock.     IV.   MOHUN AND HIS PRISONER.   Half an hour afterward, the storm had spent its fury, and I was standing by a bivouac fire on the banks of the Rappahannock, conversing with the officer against whom I had driven my horse in the darkness.  Mounted upon a powerful gray, he had led the attack with a sort of fury, and I now looked at him with some curiosity.  He was a man of about thirty, of gaunt face and figure, wearing a hat with a black feather, and the uniform of a colonel of cavalry. The features were regular and might have been called handsome; the eyes, hair, mustache, and imperial--he wore no beard--coal black; the complexion so pale that the effect was startling. More curious than all else, however, was the officer’s expression. In the lips and eyes could be read something bitterly cynical, mingled with a profound and apparently ineradicable melancholy. After looking at my new acquaintance for an instant, I said to myself: “This man has either suffered some great grief, or committed some great crime.”  His bearing was cold, but courteous.  “I recognized you as soon as I saw you, colonel,” he said, in response to my salute. “You probably do not know me, however, as I have just been transferred from the Army of the West. Colonel Mohun, at your service.”  I exchanged a pressure of the hand with Colonel Mohun, or, speaking more correctly, I grasped his. It did not return the pressure. I then thanked him for his timely appearance, and he bowed coldly.  “It was lucky that my scout led me in this direction,” he said, “that party is whipped back over the river, and will give us no more trouble to-night--the woods are full of their dead and wounded.”  As he spoke he took a cigar case from his pocket, and presented it.  “Will you smoke, sir?” he said.  I bowed and selected a cigar. Colonel Mohun imitated me, and was about to commence smoking, when two or three cavalry men were seen approaching through the gloom, apparently escorting some one.  As they drew nearer the figures became plainer in the firelight. The cavalry men had in charge a female prisoner.  She was a woman of petite figure, clad in a handsome gray riding-habit, and mounted upon a superb horse, with rich equipments, apparently belonging to a Federal officer of high rank. From the horse, I glanced at the prisoner’s face. It was a strange countenance. She was about twenty-five--her complexion was dead white, except the lips which were as red as carnations; her eyes were large and brilliant, her hair dark and worn plain under a small riding-hat. In one delicately gauntleted hand she held the rein of her horse--with the other, which was ungloved, she raised a lace handkerchief to her lips. On the finger sparkled a diamond.  There was something strange in the expression of this woman. She looked “dangerous” in spite of her calmness.  She sat gazing at some one behind me, with the handkerchief still raised to her lips. Then she took it away, and I could see a smile upon them.  What was the origin of that smile, and at whom was she looking? I turned, and found myself face to face with Colonel Mohun. His appearance almost frightened me. His countenance wore the hue of a corpse, his whole frame shook with quick shudders, and his eyes were distended until the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8424"],["title","Mohun; Or, the Last Days of Lee and His Paladins. (#2)"],["body","pupils shone in the centres of two white circles.  Suddenly his teeth clinched audibly; he passed his hand over his forehead streaming with cold sweat; and said in a low voice:  “Then you are not dead, madam?”  “No, sir,” the prisoner replied tranquilly.  Mohun gazed at her with a long, fixed look. As he did so his features gradually resumed the cold and cynical expression which I had first observed in them.  “This meeting is singular,” he said.  A satirical smile passed over the lips of the prisoner.  “Our last interview was very different, was it not, sir?” she said. “The Nottoway was higher than the Rappahannock is to-night, and you did not expect to meet me again--so soon!”  Mohun continued to gaze at her with the same fixed look.  “No, madam,” he said.  “You recall that agreeable evening, do you not, sir?”  Mohun coolly inclined his head.  “And you have not seen me since?”  “Never, madam.”  “You are mistaken!”  “Is it possible that I could have forgotten so pleasing a circumstance, madam?”  “Yes!”  “Where and when have I seen you since that time?”  “Everywhere, and at all times!--awake and asleep, day and night!”  Mohun shuddered.  “True,” he said, with a bitter smile.  “You remember, then! I am not wrong!” exclaimed the prisoner, gazing intently at him.  Mohun raised his head, and I could see the old cynical expression upon his lips.  “Certainly I remember, madam,” he said. “Do you think it possible for any one to forget your charming ladyship? And could any thing be more delightful than this interview between two old friends? But let us reserve these sweet confidences, these gushing emotions! One thing only is wanting, to perfect the happiness of this moment; the presence this evening of _your dear brother_!--but he is doubtless detained elsewhere!”  Mohun’s expression was singular as he uttered these words. The prisoner looked at him as he was speaking with an indescribable smile. I can only compare it to that of the swordsman about to deliver a mortal lunge.  “My brother,” she said, in accents as soft as a flute; “detained elsewhere, do you say, sir? You are mistaken in supposing so. He commanded the cavalry with which you were fighting to-night!”  At these words, uttered in a strange, mocking voice, I saw Mohun start as if a rattlesnake had bitten his heel. With all his self-possession he could not restrain this exhibition of emotion.  “Impossible! You are deceiving me--”  The prisoner interrupted him with a gay laugh.  “So you do not believe me,” she said; “you think, my dear sir, that everybody is dead but yourself! Dismiss that idea from your mind! _I_ am not dead, since we have the pleasure of again meeting in the flesh. _He_ is not dead! No! it was Colonel Mortimer Darke whom you fought to-night. This is his horse which I borrowed to take a short ride. I have been captured, but _he_ is neither dead nor captured, and you will doubtless receive some friendly message from him soon.”  Under the mocking accents and the satirical glance, it was easy to read profound hatred. The speaker could not hide that. At that moment she resembled a tigress about to spring.  Mohun had listened with absorbing attention as his companion spoke; but, as on the first occasion, he speedily suppressed his agitation. His face was now as cold and unmoved as though moulded of bronze.  “So be it, madam,” he said; “I will respond as I best can to such message as he may send me. For yourself, you know me well, and, I am glad to see, indulge no apprehensions. The past is dead; let it sleep. You think this interview is painful to me. You deceive yourself, madam; I would not exchange it for all the wealth of two hemispheres.”  And calling an officer, he said:--  “You will conduct this lady to General Stuart, reporting the circumstances attending her capture.”  Mohun made a ceremonious bow to the prisoner as he spoke, saluted me in the same manner, and mounting his horse, rode back at the head of his column.  The prisoner, escorted by the young officer, and still riding her fine horse, had already disappeared in the darkness.     V.   STUART.   An hour afterward, I had delivered my message to Mordaunt, and was returning by the road over Fleetwood Hill, thinking of the singular dialogue between Mohun and the gray woman.  What had these worthies meant by their mysterious allusions? How had Mohun found himself face to face on this stormy night, with two human beings whom he thought dead?  These questions puzzled me for half an hour; then I gave up the mystery, laughing. An hour afterward I had passed through Culpeper Court-House, crossed the fields, and had reached General Stuart’s headquarters.  Stuart’s tent, or rather the strip of canvas which he called one, was pitched beneath a great oak on a wooded knoll about a mile south of the little village. Above it drooped the masses of fresh June foliage; around, were grouped the white canvas “flies” of the staff; in a glade close by gleamed the tents d’abri of the couriers. Horses, tethered to the trees, champed their corn in the shadow; in the calm, summer night, the battle-flag drooped and clung to its staff. Before the tent of Stuart, a man on guard, with drawn sabre, paced to and fro with measured steps.  A glance told me that Mohun’s singular prisoner had arrived. A courier was holding her fine animal near the general’s tent, and as I dismounted, three figures’ appeared in the illuminated doorway. These were the figures of Stuart, the “gray woman,” and a young aid-de-camp.  “Farewell, madam,” said Stuart, bowing and laughing; “I am sorry to have made your acquaintance under circumstances so disagreeable to you; but I trust you will appreciate the situation, and not blame me.”  “Blame you? Not in the least, general. You are a very gallant man.”  And the gay words were accompanied by a musical laugh.  “You will have an opportunity of seeing the Confederate capital,” said Stuart, smiling.  The lady made a humorous grimace.  “And of abusing me upon the way thither; and afterward on the route to Port Monroe and Washington, as you will not be detained, I am sure.”  “I shall not abuse you, sir. You are the noblest gentleman I have ever known.”[1]  [Footnote 1: The real words of Stuart’s prisoner]  And with mutual salutes they parted--the young aid-de-camp accompanying the lady to her horse, and aiding her to mount. They then set forward toward the Court-House. Stuart had ordered the prisoner to be conducted thither, and detained at the village tavern, under guard, until morning, when she would be sent to Richmond.  As they disappeared, I entered the general’s tent, and found him laughing. Leaning one hand upon his desk, covered with papers, upon which rested his feather-decorated hat, he carelessly played with the tassel of his yellow sash with the other hand. His blue eyes sparkled, and his mustache curled with humor.  “That is really a beauty, Surry?” he said, “and I have laughed heartily.”  He threw himself on his red blanket as he spoke, and began playing with his two setter pups, whose names were “Nip” and “Tuck.” He had brought them out of the lines on his saddle.  “Well, you are really a magician,” I said. “You charm the evil spirit, and make prisoners laugh.”  Stuart laughed in reply.  “That is a curious person that Mohun sent me,” he said; “at first she was disdainful enough; but I paid her a few compliments, and now she is in an excellent humor, as you saw.”  “Yes.”  “But what about the fight?”  I made my report of the events of the evening.  “Well, Mohun is a trump,” said Stuart. “A new man, but seems made of the right stuff--real steel. What does Mordaunt say of the attack?”  “Only a scout.”  “Right, and this lady is our spoil! She is handsome, is she not? But a more curious face I have never seen. White cheeks and red lips--a sort of devil and angel mixed! Who is she, I wonder, and what was her errand. Something is under it. She gave her name as ‘Mrs. Darke,’--and her horse made me break the tenth commandment, Surry! Lady and courser are splendid.”  “She is certainly a beauty.”  “And what eyes!”  “Dangerous.”  Stuart remained silent for some moments, and then I heard him sigh.  “Do you know, my dear Surry,” he said, “that if people heard us talk in this way, they would call us libertines--immoral--any thing? There are two things that people will not disbelieve about me--that I am impure, and a drunkard! Do you know what a good man was heard to say of me the other day? ‘Stuart would be one of the greatest soldiers in the army, if he did not drink so hard!’ [1] And others add: ‘if he were not a libertine.’ Well, need I defend myself to _you_, from these charges? I promised my mother in my childhood, never to touch ardent spirits, and a drop has never passed my lips, except the wine of the communion.[2] I know I need not tell you that I am equally guiltless of the other imputation. That person does not live who can say that I ever did any thing improper of that description. And yet I am a drunkard--a libertine--I, who never touched drink, and love but one person in this world!”  [Footnote 1: This was actually said of Stuart.]  [Footnote 2: His words]  Stuart’s head sank, and he uttered a weary sigh.  “They will not let me alone,” he muttered, “and yet I am here fighting for my country. But I defy them to take my good name away from me, Surry!”  And he rose to his feet.  “General Lee knows me! Jackson knew me! I have the regard of the one, and I had the love of the other. What do I care? If my children only will not hear these ignoble charges! _One_ can never hear them, Surry--my beloved little Flora! She died while I was fighting near Middleburg in the fall of ‘62--that nearly broke me down--”  And Stuart paused and covered his eyes with his hand. Between the fingers I saw a tear.  For a moment his breast heaved--something like a sob issued from the brave lip, whereon the heavy mustache trembled.  “I think of her often--I shall never get over her death, Surry!”[1] he"]]]
