[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9078"],["title","Sanders' Union Fourth Reader (#5)"],["body"," question is one asking a repetition of what was not, at first, understood, it takes the _rising_ inflection.  EXAMPLES.  1. When do you expect to return? Next week.    When_ did you say'? Next week.  2. _Where_ did you say William had gone'? To New York.  NOTE II.--Answers to questions, whether direct or indirect, when expressive of indifference, take the _rising_ inflection, or the circumflex.  EXAMPLES.  1. Did you admire his discourse? Not much'.  2. Which way shall we walk? I am not particular'.  3. Can Henry go with us? If he chooses'.  4. What color do you prefer? I have no particular choice'.  NOTE III.--In some instances, direct questions become indirect by a change of the inflection from the rising to the falling.  EXAMPLES.  1. Will you come to-morrow' or next day'? Yes.  2. Will you come to-morrow,' or next day`? I will come to-morrow.  REMARK.--The first question asks if the person addressed will _come_ within the two days, and may be answered by _yes_ or _no_; but the second asks on _which_ of the two days he will come, and it can not be thus answered.   RULE III.  When questions are connected by the conjunction _or_, the first requires the _rising_, and the second, the _falling_ inflection.  EXAMPLES.  1. Does he study for amusement', or improvement`?  2. Was he esteemed for his wealth', or for his wisdom`?  3. Sink' or swim`, live' or die`, survive' or perish`, I give my hand and heart to this vote. WEBSTER.  4. Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath-days', or to do evil`? to save life', or to kill`?  5. Was it an act of moral courage', or cowardice`, for Cato to fall on his sword`?   RULE IV. Antithetic terms or clauses usually take opposite inflections; generally, the former has the _rising_, and the latter the _falling_ inflection.  EXAMPLES.  1. If you seek to make one rich, study not to increase his stores' but to diminish his desires`.  2. They have mouths',--but they speak not`:    Eyes have they',--but they see not`:    They have ears',--but they hear not`:    Noses have they',--but they smell not`:    They have hands',--but they handle not`:    Feet have they',--but they walk not`.                                           BIBLE.  NOTE I.--When one of the antithetic clauses is a _negative_, and the other an _affirmative_, generally the negative has the _rising_, and the affirmative the _falling_ inflection.  EXAMPLES.  1. I said an elder soldier` not a better'.  2. His acts deserve punishment` rather than commiseration'.  3. This is no time for a tribunal of justice', but for showing mercy`; not for accusation', but for philanthropy`; not for trial', but for pardon`; not for sentence and execution', but for compassion and kindness`.   RULE V. The Pause of Suspension, denoting that the sense is incomplete, usually has the _rising_ inflection.  EXAMPLES.  1. Although the fig tree shall not blossom', neither shall fruit be in the vine'; the labor of the olive shall fail', and the fields shall yield no meat'; the flocks shall be cut off from the fold', and there shall be no herd in the stalls'; yet will I rejoice in the Lord`, I will joy in the God of my salvation`. BIBLE.  NOTE I.--The ordinary direct address, not accompanied with strong emphasis, takes the _rising_ inflection, on the principle of the pause of suspension.  EXAMPLES.  1. Men', brethren', and fathers', hear ye my defense which I make now unto you. BIBLE.  2. Ye living flowers', that skirt the eternal frost'!    Ye wild goats', sporting round the eagle's nest'!    Ye eagles', playmates of the mountain storm'!    Ye lightnings', the dread arrows of the clouds'!    Ye signs' and wonders' of the elements'!    Utter forth GOD`, and fill the hills with praise`!                                                              COLERIDGE.  NOTE II.--In some instances of a pause of suspension, the sense requires an intense _falling_ inflection.  EXAMPLE.  1. The prodigal, if he does not become a _pauper_`, will, at least, have but little to bestow on others.  REMARK.--If the _rising_ inflection is given on _pauper_, the sense would be perverted, and the passage made to mean, that, in order to be able to bestow on others, it is necessary that he should become a pauper.   RULE VI. Expressions of tenderness, as of grief, or kindness, commonly incline the voice to the _rising_ inflection.  EXAMPLES.  1. Mother',--I leave thy dwelling';      Oh! shall it be forever'?    With grief my heart is swelling',      From thee',--from thee',--to sever'.  2. O my son Absalom'! my son', my son Absalom'! Would God I had died for thee', Absalom', my son', my son'! BIBLE.   RULE VII. The Penultimate Pause, or the last but one, of a passage, is usually preceded by the _rising_ inflection.  EXAMPLES.  1. Diligence`, industry`, and proper improvement of time', are material duties of the young`.  2. These through faith subdued kingdoms`, wrought righteous-ness`, obtained promises`, stopped the mouths of lions`, quenched the violence of fire`, escaped the edge of the sword`, out of weakness were made strong`, waxed valiant in fight', turned to flight the armies of the aliens`.  REMARK.--The rising inflection is employed at the penultimate pause in order to promote variety, since the voice generally falls at the end of a sentence.   RULE VIII. Expressions of strong emotion, as of anger or surprise, and also the language of authority and reproach, are expressed with the _falling_ inflection.  EXAMPLES.  1. On YOU`, and on your CHILDREN`, be the peril of the innocent blood which shall be shed this day`.  2. What a piece of workmanship is MAN`! How noble in REASON`! How infinite in FACULTIES`!  3. O FOOLS`! and _slow of heart_ to believe all that the prophets have written concerning me`! BIBLE.  4. HENCE`, HOME`, _you idle creatures_`, GET YOU HOME`, YOU BLOCKS`, YOU STONES`, YOU WORSE THAN USELESS THINGS`!  5. Avaunt`! and quit my sight`! let the earth hide thee`! Thy bones are marrowless`; thou hast no speculation in thine eyes which thou dost glare` with. SHAKSPEARE.  6. Slave, do thy office`! Strike`, as I struck the foe`!    Strike`, as I would have struck the tyrants`!    Strike deep as my curse`! Strike`, and but once`! ID.   RULE IX. An emphatic succession of particulars, and emphatic repetition, require the _falling_ inflection.  EXAMPLES.  1. _Beware_` what earth calls happiness; BEWARE`    All joys but joys that never can expire`.  2. A great mind`, a great heart`, a great orator`, a great career`, have been consigned to history`. BUTLER.  REMARK.--The stress of voice on each successive particular, or repetition, should gradually be increased as the subject advances.  The CIRCUMFLEX is a union of the two inflections on the same word, beginning either with the _falling_ and ending with the _rising_, or with the _rising_ and ending with the _falling_; as, If he goes to ____ I shall go to ____.  The circumflex is mainly employed in the language of irony, and in expressing ideas implying some condition, either expressed or understood.  EXAMPLES.  1. You, a beardless youth, pretend to teach a British general.  2. What! shear a wolf? a prowling wolf?  3. My father's trade? ah, really, that's too bad!    My father's trade? Why, blockhead, are you mad?    My father, sir, did never stoop so low,--    He was a gentleman, I'd have you know.  4. What! confer a crown on the author of the public calamities?  5. But you are very wise men, and deeply learned in the truth; we are weak, contemptible, mean persons.  6. They pretend they come to improve our state, enlarge our thoughts, and free us from error.  7. But youth, it seems, is not my only crime; I have been accused of acting a theatrical part.  8. And this man has become a god and Cassius a wretched creature.     SECTION IV.  MODULATION.  MODULATION implies those variations of the voice, heard in reading or speaking, which are prompted by the feelings and emotions that the subject inspires.  EXAMPLES.  EXPRESSIVE OF COURAGE AND CHIVALROUS EXCITEMENT.    FULL   .- Once more unto the breach, dear friends, _once more_,   TONE   '- Or close the wall up with our English dead!   MIDDLE .- In peace, there's nothing so becomes a man,   TONE   '- As modest stillness and humility;          .- But when the blast of war blows in our ears,   SHORT  |  Then imitate the action of the tiger;   AND    +  Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,   QUICK  '- Disguise fair nature with hard-favored rage.          .- _On_, ON, you noblest English,   HIGH   |  Whose blood is fetched from fathers of war-proof!   AND    +  _Fathers_, that, like so many Alexanders,   LOUD   |  Have, in these parts, from morn till even fought,          '- And sheathed their swords for lack of argument.   QUICK  .- I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,   AND    |  Straining upon the start. The game's afoot;   VERY   +  Follow your spirits, and, upon this charge,   LOUD   '- CRY--HEAVEN FOR HARRY! ENGLAND! AND ST. GEORGE!                                                              SHAKSPEARE.  REMARK.--To read the foregoing example in one dull, monotonous tone of voice, without regard to the sentiment expressed, would render the passage extremely insipid and lifeless. But by a proper modulation of the voice, it infuses into the mind of the reader or hearer the most animating and exciting emotions.  The voice is modulated in _three_ different ways. _First_, it is varied in PITCH; that is, from _high_ to _low_ tones, and the reverse. _Secondly_, it is varied in QUANTITY, or in _loudness_ or _volume_ of sound. _Thirdly_, it is varied in QUALITY, or in the _kind_ of sound expressed.   PITCH OF VOICE.  Pitch of voice has reference to its degree of elevation.  Every person, in reading or speaking, assumes a certain pitch, which may be either _high_ or _low_, according to circumstances, and which has a governing influence on the variations of the voice, above and below it. This degree of elevation is usually called the KEY NOTE.  As an exercise in varying "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9078"],["title","Sanders' Union Fourth Reader (#6)"],["body","voice in pitch, the practice of uttering a sentence on the several degrees of elevation, as represented in the following scale, will be found beneficial. First, utter the musical syllables, then the vowel sound, and lastly, the proposed sentence,--ascending and descending.    ---------8.--do--#--_e_-in-m_e_.---Virtue alone survives.----           7.  si  #  _i_ in d_i_e.  Virtue alone survives.   -------6.--la--#--_o_-in-d_o_.---Virtue alone survives.------         5.  sol #  _o_ in n_o_.   Virtue alone survives.   -----4.--fa--#--_a_-in-_a_t.---Virtue alone survives.--------       3.  mi  #  _a_-in _a_te.  Virtue alone survives.   ---2.--re--#--_a_-in-f_a_r.--Virtue alone survives.----------     1.  do  #  _a_ in _a_ll.  Virtue alone survives  Although the voice is capable of as many variations in speaking, as are marked on the musical scale, yet for all the purposes of ordinary elocution, it will be sufficiently exact if we make but _three_ degrees of variation, viz., the _Low_, the _Middle_, and the _High_.  1. THE LOW PITCH is that which falls below the usual speaking key, and is employed in expressing emotions of _sublimity_, _awe_, and _reverence_.  EXAMPLE.    Silence, how dead! darkness, how profound!   Nor eye, nor list'ning ear, an object finds;   Creation sleeps. 'Tis as the general pulse   Of life stood still, and Nature made a pause.--   An awful pause! prophetic of her end.                                                                  YOUNG.  2. THE MIDDLE PITCH is that usually employed in common conversation, and in expressing _unimpassioned thought_ and _moderate emotion_.  EXAMPLES.  1. It was early in a summer morning, when the air was cool, the earth moist, the whole face of the creation fresh and gay, that I lately walked in a beautiful flower garden, and, at once, regaled the senses and indulged the fancy. HERVEY.  2.   \"_I love to live_,\" said a prattling boy,   As he gayly played with his new-bought toy,   And a merry laugh went echoing forth,   From a bosom filled with joyous mirth.  3. THE HIGH PITCH is that which rises above the usual speaking key, and is used in expressing _joyous_ and _elevated feelings_.  EXAMPLE.    Higher, _higher_, EVER HIGHER,--   Let the watchword be \"ASPIRE!\"     Noble Christian youth;   Whatsoe'er be God's behest,   Try to do that duty best,     In the strength of Truth.                                                            M.F. TUPPER.   QUANTITY.  QUANTITY is two-fold;--consisting in FULLNESS or VOLUME of sound, as _soft_ or _loud_; and in TIME, as _slow_ or _quick_. The former has reference to STRESS; the latter, to MOVEMENT.  The degrees of variation in quantity are numerous, varying from a slight, soft whisper to a vehement shout. But for all practical purposes, they may be considered as _three_, the same as in pitch;--the _soft_, the _middle_, and the _loud_.  For exercise in quantity, let the pupil read any sentence, as,    \"Beauty is a fading flower,\"  first in a slight, soft tone, and then repeat it, gradually increasing in quantity to the full extent of the voice. Also, let him read it first very slowly, and then repeat it, gradually increasing the movement. In doing this, he should be careful not to vary the pitch.  In like manner, let him repeat any vowel sound, or all of them, and also inversely. Thus:  [Illustration]  [Transcriber's Note: The illustration is a row of the letter \"O,\" increasing in size across the page, followed by a row of the letter \"O\" decreasing in size. The presumed intent is to convey loudness.]   REMARK.--Quantity is often mistaken for Pitch. But it should be borne in mind that quantity has reference to _loudness_ or _volume_ of sound, and pitch to the _elevation_ or _depression_ of a tone. The difference may be distinguished by the slight and heavy strokes on a bell;--both of which produce sounds alike in _pitch_; but they differ in _quantity_ or _loudness_, in proportion as the strokes are light or heavy.   RULES FOR QUANTITY.  1. SOFT, OR SUBDUED TONES, are those which range from a whisper to a complete vocality, and are used to express _fear_, _caution_, _secrecy_, _solemnity_, and all _tender emotions_.  EXAMPLES.  1.   We watched her breathing through the night,     Her breathing soft and low,   As in her breast the wave of life     Kept heaving to and fro. HOOD.  2.   Softly, peacefully,     Lay her to rest;   Place the turf lightly,     On her young breast. D.E. GOODMAN.  3.   The loud wind dwindled to a whisper low,   And sighed for pity as it answered,--\"No.\"  2. A MIDDLE TONE, or medium loudness of voice, is employed in reading _narrative_, _descriptive_, or _didactic sentences_.  EXAMPLE.    I love my country's pine-clad hills,   Her thousand bright and gushing rills,     Her sunshine and her storms;   Her rough and rugged rocks that rear   Their hoary heads high in the air,     In wild fantastic forms.  3. A LOUD TONE, or fullness and stress of voice, is used in expressing _violent passions_ and _vehement emotions_.  EXAMPLES.  1.   STAND! _the ground's your own_, my braves,--   Will ye give it up to _slaves_?   Will ye look for _greener graves_?       Hope ye mercy still?   What's the mercy _despots_ feel?   Hear it in that _battle-peal_,--   Read it on yon bristling steel,       Ask it--_ye who will!_ PIERPONT.  2.   \"HOLD!\" Tyranny cries; but their resolute breath   Sends back the reply: \"INDEPENDENCE or DEATH!\"   QUALITY.  QUALITY has reference to _the kind of sound_ uttered.  Two sounds may be alike in quantity and pitch, yet differ in quality. The sounds produced on the clarinet and flute may agree in pitch and quantity, yet be unlike in quality. The same is true in regard to the tones of the voice of two individuals. This difference is occasioned mainly by the different positions of the vocal organs.  The qualities of voice mostly used in reading or speaking, and which should receive the highest degree of culture, are the _Pure Tone_, the _Orotund_, the _Aspirated_, and the _Guttural_.  RULES FOR QUALITY.  1. THE PURE TONE is a clear, smooth, sonorous flow of sound, usually accompanied with the middle pitch of voice, and is adapted to express emotions of _joy, cheerfulness, love_, and _tranquillity_.  EXAMPLE.    Hail! beauteous stranger of the wood,     Attendant on the spring,   Now heaven repairs thy vernal seat,     And woods thy welcome sing.  2. THE OROTUND is a full, deep, round, and pure tone of voice, peculiarly adapted in expressing _sublime_ and _pathetic emotions_.  EXAMPLE.    It thunders! Sons of dust, in reverence bow!   Ancient of Days! Thou speakest from above:   Almighty! trembling, like a timid child,   I hear thy awful voice. Alarmed--afraid--   I see the flashes of thy lightning wild,   And in the very grave would hide my head.  3. THE ASPIRATED TONE of voice is not a pure, vocal sound, but rather a forcible breathing utterance, and is used to express _amazement, fear, terror, anger, revenge, remorse_, and _fervent emotions_.  EXAMPLE.    Oh, coward conscience, how dost thou affright me!   The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight;   Cold, fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.  4. THE GUTTURAL QUALITY is a deep, aspirated tone of voice, used to express _aversion, hatred, loathing_, and _contempt_.  EXAMPLE.    Tell me I _hate_ the bowl?     HATE is a feeble word:   I _loathe_, ABHOR, my very soul    With strong disgust is stirred,   Whene'er I see, or hear, or tell,     Of the dark beverage of hell.   NOTATION IN MODULATION.    (o) high.   (oo) high and loud.   ([o]) low.   ([oo]) low and loud.   (=) quick.   (_''_) short and quick.   (_sl_.) slow.   (_p_.) soft.   (_pp_.) very soft.   (_f_.) loud.   (_ff_.) very loud.   (_pl_.) plaintive.   (<) increase.   (>) decrease.  EXAMPLES FOR EXERCISE IN MODULATION.      (_p_.)

But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,            The hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar.     (_sl_.) When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,            The line, too, labors, and the words move slow:    (=)     Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain,            Flies o'er the unbending corn, and skims along the main. POPE.      (o=)    Go ring the bells and fire the guns,            And fling the starry banner out;    (_ff_.) Shout \"FREEDOM\" till your lisping ones            Give back the cradle shout. WHITTIER.      (_pl_.)   \"And now, farewell! 'Tis hard to give thee up,              With death so like a gentle slumber on thee!--            And thy dark sin!--oh! I could drink the cup              If from this woe its bitterness had won thee.            May God have called thee, like a wanderer, home,                My lost boy, Absalom!\" WILLIS.      (_sl_.) The sun hath set in folded clouds,--              Its twilight rays are gone,    (o)     And, gathered in the shades of night,              The storm is rolling on.    (_pl_.) Alas! how ill that bursting storm    (>)       The fainting spirit braves,    (_p_.)  When they,--the lovely and the lost,--    (_pl_.)   Are gone to early graves!      (o)    On! onward still! o'er the land he sweeps,    (>)      With wreck, and ruin, and rush, and roar,                   Nor stops to look back                   On his dreary track    (_''_)   But speeds to the spoils before.
