Cupid's harness was all white and silver, and waving white plumes and silver bells were in various places about the sleigh and horse.  There were big white fur robes, and when Mr. St. Clair tucked the girls in, and Ethelyn took the white reins and white whip, it certainly seemed as if no sleigh load could be prettier.  And none was. Everybody agreed that the white sleigh was the pride of the parade. Patty secretly wondered why her aunt was satisfied without more gaudy coloring; as she wrote to her father afterwards, she had half expected to see a red sleigh with blue and yellow robes. \"But,\" she said, \"I suppose it was because Cupid happened to be white, and I'm glad he was, for it was all just lovely.\"  Mr. and Mrs. St. Clair and Florelle went in the parade also, but they contented themselves with the family sleigh, which of course was both handsome and elaborate. They had spent all their energies on the girls' appearance and they were very proud of the result.  Reginald, who was of an ingenious turn of mind, had contrived an affair which was supposed to look like a Roman chariot, and which was, therefore, a bit incongruous on runners.  It was very fancy, being almost entirely covered with gilt paper, and it had two wheels and no back. It jolted fearfully, and Reginald was occasionally thrown out. However, he stuck to it pluckily, until his machine was a total wreck, when he abandoned it, and jumped into his father's sleigh for the rest of the parade.  Patty enjoyed it all hugely. It was such a novel experience to fly along, through the crisp cold air, and over the shining snow roads; and Ethelyn was in such jubilant good-humor, that the whole affair marked a red letter day in the winter calendar.  The \"White Flyer\" was the talk of the town for weeks after, and Mr. St. Clair never tired of telling any one who would listen, how much it all cost, and how difficult it was to get the white sleigh and harness on such short notice.  Patty grew very tired of this pompous boasting, and, notwithstanding her enjoyment of the luxury at Villa Rosa, she was not altogether sorry when the time drew near for her to go away to Boston to make her next visit.  She was to leave the St. Clairs about the first of March, and spend the next three months with her father's sister, Mrs. Fleming.  As Uncle Robert was her mother's brother, the two families were entirely unacquainted, and the St. Clairs could tell Patty nothing about the new home to which she was going.  \"But,\" said her Aunt Isabel, \"I feel sure you won't like them as well as you like us. Are they rich, Patricia?\"  \"I don't know,\" answered Patty; \"papa never said anything about that. He said that they are a very literary family.\"  \"Humph,\" said Aunt Isabel, \"then I guess they haven't very much money; literary people never do have. Poor child, I suppose they'll turn you into a regular little blue-stocking.\"  Patty didn't relish this idea, for at Villa Rosa she had fallen into the habit of neglecting her lessons, and already study was losing its charm for her. But she was fond of reading, and she felt sure she would enjoy an atmosphere of books.  On the 14th of February, Aunt Isabel gave a party for the young people, which was a farewell party for Patty, though it was also a festival in honor of St. Valentine's Day.  As usual, the girls had new dresses, and they represented Mrs. St. Clair's idea of valentines.  Ethelyn's was of blue, and Patty's of pink silk, and they were trimmed with innumerable lace flutings and garlands of flowers. They were further decorated with gilt hearts pierced by darts, and with skilfully made artificial doves which perched on the shoulders of the wearers.  The party was a very pretty one, as Aunt Isabel's parties always were.  The rooms were decorated with roses and pink ribbons, and gilt hearts and darts, and feathered doves and wax cupids. At supper the ices and cakes were heart-shaped, and after the children had returned to the drawing-room St. Valentine himself appeared.  As Patty suspected, it was Uncle Robert dressed up to represent the old Saint, with flowing white hair and beard and a gilt paper halo. He wore a long white robe with red hearts dotted all over it, and carried a gilt bow and arrow.  He carried also a pack or pouch full of valentines which he distributed to the guests.  Of course they were very handsome affairs, and in each was hidden some dainty trifle, handkerchief, fan or bonbons.  Besides those at the party, Patty received numerous other valentines, some of which came by mail, and others in the good old-fashioned way, under the front door.  Many of these were from the Elmbridge young people, while several from Richmond included a beauty from her father, and a pretty one from Clara Hayden.  Although the cousins had varying tastes, they had become very good friends, and both felt sad when the day came for Patty to leave Villa Rosa.  Indeed, the whole family felt sad, for Patty was a very lovable little girl, and had endeared herself to them all. Uncle Robert was to take her to New York and put her on the boat, where Mr. Tom Fleming would meet her and take her to his mother's house in Boston.  Aunt Isabel said she, too, would go to New York with Patty, and of course Ethelyn announced her intention of going.  Then Florelle set up such a howl to go, that Patty begged her aunt to take her, and the child went.  Reginald declined to be left out of such a family affair, so Patty was amply escorted to her destination.  They went on board the _Priscilla_, a beautiful boat of the Fall River Line, and Mr. St. Clair soon found Mr. Fleming, who had agreed to meet him at a certain spot.  Then Patty was introduced to her Cousin Tom, who was a tall young man of about thirty-five, with a pointed beard, and dark, pleasant eyes.  \"So this is my little Southern cousin,\" he said, cordially, as he took her hand.  Then he chatted affably with the whole party until the warning gong announced that they must go ashore.  Ethelyn was heart-broken at the thought of parting, and flinging her arms round Patty's neck, burst into tears.  This was enough for Florelle, who promptly followed suit, and set up one of her very best howls.  With a good-bye kiss to his niece, Uncle Robert picked up the screaming child and marshaled his family off of the boat, and Patty was left alone with her new-found cousin.     CHAPTER VIII   AN ABSENT-MINDED COUSIN  \"Now, Patty,\" said Cousin Tom, as they walked along the saloon, \"I am going to hand you over to the stewardess, who will show you your stateroom. Go with her, and she will look after you. I think you would better leave off that heavy coat, as it is too chilly outside to permit of going on deck, and the atmosphere within is quite warm. Ah, here she is. Stewardess, this is Miss Fairfield and here is her stateroom key. See to it that she is made comfortable.\"  As Mr. Fleming supplemented his request with a pecuniary argument, the stewardess made Patty her especial charge, and assiduously looked after her comfort.  \"And, Patty,\" said her cousin, as she turned away, \"when you are ready, come back and you will find me right here. See, just by this staircase. Lock your door and bring the key with you.\"  Patty felt as if she had suddenly grown several years younger, for Cousin Tom talked to her as to a little child. \"It's more like Wonderland than ever,\" she said to herself. \"Only instead of growing big or little, I grow old or young. At Aunt Isabel's I was considered a young lady but Cousin Tom seems to think I'm a small child.\"  The stewardess, who was a good-natured old colored woman, took Patty to her stateroom, and then helped her to unpack her traveling-bag, and arrange her belongings for the night.  As Aunt Isabel had bought her clothes, of course Patty was absurdly overdressed.  When she took off her blue velvet coat with its ermine collar, her blue silk, lace-trimmed dress looked far more suitable for a grand reception than for traveling.  \"Laws, missy,\" said the voluble stewardess, \"how handsome you is!\"  Patty thought this a reference to her dress, but the remark was meant for the child herself, whose flower-like face looked out from a most becoming big hat of plaited blue velvet, and her golden hair fell in a loosely tied bunch of long thick curls.  When Patty returned to her Cousin Tom, she found him sitting just where he said he would be, but so deeply absorbed in a book that he didn't see or hear her approach.  Not wishing to disturb his reading, she sat down in the large chair next to him and waited.  She didn't mind this at all, for it was very interesting to watch the people passing up and down, and the saloon itself was beautiful to look at. Patty sat for a long while, but Cousin Tom never moved, except to turn the pages of his book. She did not like to speak to him, as she feared he would think it necessary to lay aside his book and entertain her; she had no wish to trouble him, and beside, she was quite capable of entertaining herself.  So after she had sat still for a long while, she decided to walk about the cabin a bit, always keeping in sight of Cousin Tom, if he should raise his eyes. But he didn't, and Patty strayed farther and farther away from him, until she had explored all the available parts of the boat.  She was much interested in all she saw, and many admiring eyes followed the pretty, graceful child as she walked about.  When she reached the dining-room she looked in, and the sight of the passengers sitting at well-filled tables made her feel very hungry, and she wondered if Cousin Tom would finish his book in time to give her any dinner. Somehow she felt sure he never would look up until he _had_ finished the book.  She went back and sat down again beside him with a little sigh. But he didn't hear the little sigh, and kept on reading.  Patty looked at him curiously. There"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8456"],["title","Patty Fairfield (#8)"],["body","little hope of his finishing the book, for he was only about half-way through it, and he read very slowly, turning the pages at long intervals. She could see his eyes move eagerly along the printed lines, as if delighted with what he found there.  She waited a while longer, and then said to herself, \"I don't care, I'm going to speak to him. I've waited a million hours, and the dinner will be all eaten up.\"  She didn't speak, but she rose and stood by his side, and then with a sudden impulse she laid her hand with outspread fingers upon the page he was reading.  Cousin Tom jumped as if a firecracker had exploded in his vicinity, and he looked at Patty with a dazed expression.  \"Bless my soul!\" he said, \"why, little one, I forgot all about you. Will you forgive me? Have you been here long? I was reading, you see, and I didn't hear you come.\"  \"I've been here an hour, Cousin Tom,\" said Patty, demurely.  \"An hour? No! Is it possible? You poor child, why didn't you tell me?\"  \"Oh, I didn't mind,\" said Patty, \"and you seemed to be all wrapped up in your book.\"  \"Yes, I was,--I was. But I'll try to make amends. Come, let's go and have some dinner.\"  Taking Patty's hand, Cousin Tom strode along the saloon, and down the stairs, and Patty almost had to run to keep up with his long steps.  \"Now,\" said he, as they seated themselves at a table and an obsequious waiter began to put ice and then water into their glasses. \"Now, what would you like to eat?\"  \"Oh, anything at all,\" said Patty, gaily, \"I'm hungry enough to eat,--I don't know what.\"  \"Yes, yes, of course you are,--poor child,--so sorry I forgot you,--quite inexcusable of me.\"  Mr. Fleming was looking over the bill of fare as he talked, and then he looked doubtfully at Patty, as if uncertain what he ought to order for her.  \"What would you like for your dinner, child? Now don't say you don't care, or that you'll leave it to me, for little girls always say that, and I declare I don't know what you ought to have.\"  \"All right,\" said Patty, who was quite equal to the occasion. \"Let's have some lobster mayonnaise, and some mushrooms under glass, and little tiny clams, and tutti-frutti and a Dewey Punch.\"  Cousin Tom stared at her in amazement.  \"What are you talking about?\" he exclaimed; \"you'd be dead if you ate all those things. Are they on the bill of fare? What is a 'Dewey Punch'?\"  \"Oh, I don't die so easily as that. Ethelyn and I used to eat worse mixes than that, whenever we lunched at the New York restaurants, A Dewey Punch is a lovely kind of ice cream with strawberry jam or something poured all over it. I don't see it on the list; perhaps they don't have it. Never mind, we'll take meringue glacé.\"  \"Indeed we won't. I've changed my mind and I'll order this dinner myself. You shall have some soup, a broiled chicken, some vegetables and a plain ice cream. There, how do you like that?\"  Cousin Tom didn't speak crossly at all, but very decidedly, and there was a pleasant twinkle in his eye that took away all idea of censure, so Patty said, amiably:  \"I think it will be very nice and I really don't care what we have, only you told me to suggest something, so I did.\"  \"Certainly, that's all right, but your suggestions were suicidal. Are you familiar with Bacon?\"  Oh, thought Patty, he's going to order the breakfast over night, and I hate bacon.  \"Yes,\" she said, \"but I don't like it at all.\"  \"You don't? What a perverted taste. But Boston will soon change that. We have a Bacon club, which you shall join. It is a most delightful club, and you will like it, I'm sure. I fancy that in a few weeks I shall see you devouring Bacon with intense enjoyment.\"  Indeed I won't, thought Patty. She was about to say that her Uncle Robert belonged to a Terrapin Club, but refrained, thinking it might be impolite to imply disparagement to the more lowly bacon.  So she changed the subject, and said:  \"Please, Cousin Tom, tell me something of your family. It's so queer to go to see people and not know anything about them beforehand. But so far, my relatives have been very nice.\"  \"Oh, the Flemings are a wonderful family,\" said Cousin Tom, gaily, \"we are all going to do something great, but somehow we haven't hit it off yet.\"  \"Cousin Elizabeth is an author, isn't she?\" inquired Patty, a little timidly, for she had never seen a real, live author.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Fleming, \"Elizabeth is an author, that is, she writes novels when she isn't doing anything else; Barbara is a club woman, but she writes too, more or less.\"  \"And what do you do? Are you literary?\"  \"Yes, I'm writing a book, myself. It's a treatise on The Will, and I flatter myself I have some novel theories; and then there's Ruth, you know.\"  \"Ruth, who is she?\"  \"Oh, she's our cousin, who lives with us. Not your cousin, you know. She is father's brother's child, and her people live in the country; so, as she has a fine mind, she lives with us in order to have the advantage of a Boston education.\"  \"How old is she?\" asked Patty.  \"Fourteen or fifteen, I think. She'll be company for you; I think you'll like her, though she is very different from you.\"  \"What is she like?\" asked Patty, much interested in this new and unexpected comrade.  \"Why, she is quiet, and very studious, and--but you'll see her yourself, to-morrow, so I'll let you form your own opinion.\"  After dinner they had a short promenade on deck, but the wind was so strong, that Patty was glad to return to the warm, light saloon, and they sat down on one of the red velvet sofas. Cousin Tom didn't resume his book, and Patty felt that he was politely trying to entertain her.  So with a desire to entertain him in return, she asked him to tell her about the book he was writing.  This seemed to please him immensely, and he eagerly launched into a description of its scope and plan.  As the subject was far above Patty's comprehension, she listened without understanding it clearly at all, and after a half hour or so, the continuous conversation, and the soothing motion of the boat caused the little girl quite unintentionally to fall sound asleep.  Mr. Fleming kept on talking for some time after this, when suddenly it occurred to him that his cousin sat very still, and peering round the corner of the big blue velvet hat, he discovered that his audience was quite oblivious to his learned discourse.  At first he looked a little annoyed, then he smiled compassionately, for the tired child seemed to be very peacefully resting, and her pretty head made a lovely picture against the red velvet sofa.  Mr. Fleming sent for the stewardess, and then awoke the little sleeper.  \"Come, Patty,\" said he, gently tapping her on the shoulder, \"it's bedtime, little girl, and you must run away to your bunk.\"  Patty opened her eyes and stared about her.  \"Oh, Cousin Tom,\" she said, as she remembered the circumstances under which she had fallen asleep, \"I'm _so_ sorry,--I didn't mean to go to sleep, and I _was_ interested.\"  \"That's all right, my small cousin,\" said Mr. Fleming, \"and now go along with the stewardess, and go to sleep and get a good night's rest.\" Patty did as Cousin Tom directed, and never wakened until she heard the steamer scraping against the dock early the next morning.  She rose and dressed quickly, and when the stewardess came for her, she was quite ready to go to meet Cousin Tom, who awaited her in the cabin.  \"I shall give you a roll and a cup of coffee,\" he said, as if half afraid that Patty would want to order unheard-of dishes, \"for they are expecting us home to breakfast, and we have only fifteen minutes before our train starts for Boston.\"  Patty drank her coffee and ate her roll with a relish, and declared herself ready to start. A short ride in the cars brought them to Boston. They left the train and entered the waiting-room, where Cousin Tom placed Patty in a seat, and told her to stay there and not move while he attended to her trunks.  Patty obediently sat still, and soon she saw Cousin Tom returning. But just before he reached her, he met a man whom he evidently knew, and whom he seemed overjoyed to meet. The two men talked earnestly together, and then both turned and walked away.  Patty had seen instances of her cousin's absent-mindedness, even since he had neglected to take her to dinner the night before, and she guessed at once that he had forgotten her existence, and was going away with his friend.  She had no intention of being deserted in this way, so she left the bags and wraps which she was supposed to be guarding, and ran after him.  \"Cousin Tom!\" she cried as she caught up with him, \"where are you going?\"  \"Bless my soul!\" he exclaimed, staring at her, \"I forgot you were with me. What shall I do? Allow me to present Mr. Harding. Ted, this is my cousin, Miss Patty Fairfield; I am supposed to be escorting her home, but if what you tell me is so, I must go at once to see Varian. Wait, I have it, Patty; I'll send you home by a messenger; you don't mind, do you?\"  \"No, indeed, Cousin Tom,\" said Patty; \"send me any way you like.\"  So Mr. Fleming called a messenger-boy, and giving Patty, and all the wraps and bags into his charge, he sent them to his mother's house. \"Tell them I met Harding, and had to go away with him on some very important business,\" he said to Patty. \"I'll be home to-night,--good-bye.\"  And with a hasty hand-shake, he turned again to his friend and they walked rapidly away.  \"Come this way, miss,\" said the messenger, who was a tall youth, polite and deferential, and who appeared not at all surprised at the order given him. \"I'll take you along all right.\"  He piloted Patty with great care and after riding for some distance on the street cars, they arrived at Mrs. Fleming's house.     CHAPTER IX   THE FLEMINGS  The messenger-boy rang the door bell, and a white-capped maid opened the door. When she saw the uniformed youth, she held out her hand for his book, signed it and dismissed him.  Then turning to Patty, she said, \"This way, miss,\""]]]
