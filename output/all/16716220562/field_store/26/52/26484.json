Meanwhile, the naughty Pandora, and hardly less naughty Epimetheus, remained in their cottage.  Both of them had been grievously stung, and were in a good deal of pain, which seemed the more intolerable to them, because it was the very first pain that had ever been felt since the world began.  Of course, they were entirely unaccustomed to it, and could have no idea what it meant.  Besides all this, they were in exceedingly bad humor, both with themselves and with one another.  In order to indulge it to the utmost, Epimetheus sat down sullenly in a corner with his back towards Pandora; while Pandora flung herself upon the floor and rested her head on the fatal and abominable box.  She was crying bitterly, and sobbing as if her heart would break.  Suddenly there was a gentle little tap, on the inside of the lid.  “What can that be?” cried Pandora, lifting her head.  But either Epimetheus had not heard the tap, or was too much out of humor to notice it.  At any rate, he made no answer.  “You are very unkind,” said Pandora, sobbing anew, “not to speak to me!”  Again the tap!  It sounded like the tiny knuckles of a fairy’s hand, knocking lightly and playfully on the inside of the box.  “Who are you?”  asked Pandora, with a little of her former curiosity. “Who are you, inside of this naughty box?”  A sweet little voice spoke from within,--  “Only lift the lid, and you shall see.”  “No, no,” answered Pandora, again beginning to sob, “I have had enough of lifting the lid!  You are inside of the box, naughty creature, and there you shall stay!  There are plenty of your ugly brothers and sisters already flying about the world.  You need never think that I shall be so foolish as to let you out!”  She looked towards Epimetheus, as she spoke, perhaps expecting that he would commend her for her wisdom.  But the sullen boy only muttered that she was wise a little too late.  “Ah,” said the sweet little voice again, “you had much better let me out.  I am not like those naughty creatures that have stings in their tails.  They are no brothers and sisters of mine, as you would see at once, if you were only to get a glimpse of me.  Come, come, my pretty Pandora!  I am sure you will let me out!”  And, indeed, there was a kind of cheerful witchery in the tone, that made it almost impossible to refuse anything which this little voice asked.  Pandora’s heart had insensibly grown lighter, at every word that came from within the box.  Epimetheus, too, though still in the corner, had turned half round, and seemed to be in rather better spirits than before.  “My dear Epimetheus,” cried Pandora, “have you heard this little voice?”  “Yes, to be sure I have,” answered he, but in no very good-humor as yet. “And what of it?”  “Shall I lift the lid again?” asked Pandora.  “Just as you please,” said Epimetheus.  “You have done so much mischief already, that perhaps you may as well do a little more.  One other Trouble, in such a swarm as you have set adrift about the world, can make no very great difference.”  “You might speak a little more kindly!” murmured Pandora, wiping her eyes.  “Ah, naughty boy!” cried the little voice within the box, in an arch and laughing tone.  “He knows he is longing to see me.  Come, my dear Pandora, lift up the lid.  I am in a great hurry to comfort you.  Only let me have some fresh air, and you shall soon see that matters are not quite so dismal as you think them!”  “Epimetheus,” exclaimed Pandora, “come what may, I am resolved to open the box!”  “And, as the lid seems very heavy,” cried Epimetheus, running across the room, “I will help you!”  So, with one consent, the two children again lifted the lid.  Out flew a sunny and smiling little personage, and hovered about the room, throwing a light wherever she went.  Have you never made the sunshine dance into dark corners, by reflecting it from a bit of looking-glass?  Well, so looked the winged cheerfulness of this fairylike stranger, amid the gloom of the cottage.  She flew to Epimetheus, and laid the least touch of her finger on the inflamed spot where the Trouble had stung him, and immediately the anguish of it was gone.  Then she kissed Pandora on the forehead, and her hurt was cured likewise.  After performing these good offices, the bright stranger fluttered sportively over the children’s heads, and looked so sweetly at them, that they both began to think it not so very much amiss to have opened the box, since, otherwise, their cheery guest must have been kept a prisoner among those naughty imps with stings in their tails.  “Pray, who are you, beautiful creature?” inquired Pandora.  “I am to be called Hope!” answered the sunshiny figure.  “And because I am such a cheery little body, I was packed into the box, to make amends to the human race for that swarm of ugly Troubles, which was destined to be let loose among them.  Never fear! we shall do pretty well, in spite of them all.”  “Your wings are colored like the rainbow!”  exclaimed Pandora.  “How very beautiful!”  “Yes, they are like the rainbow,” said Hope, “because glad as my nature is, I am partly made of tears as well as smiles.”  “And will you stay with us,” asked Epimetheus, “for ever and ever?”  “As long as you need me,” said Hope, with her pleasant smile,--“and that will be as long as you live in the world,--I promise never to desert you.  There may come times and seasons, now and then, when you will think that I have utterly vanished.  But again, and again, and again, when perhaps you least dream of it, you shall see the glimmer of my wings on the ceiling of your cottage.  Yes, my dear children, and I know something very good and beautiful that is to be given you hereafter!”  “O tell us,” they exclaimed,--“tell us what it is!”  “Do not ask me,” replied Hope, putting her finger on her rosy mouth. “But do not despair, even if it should never happen while you live on this earth.  Trust in my promise, for it is true.”  “We do trust you!” cried Epimetheus and Pandora, both in one breath.  And so they did; and not only they, but so has everybody trusted Hope, that has since been alive.  And, to tell you the truth, I cannot help being glad--(though, to be sure, it was an uncommonly naughty thing for her to do)-but I cannot help being glad that our foolish Pandora peeped into the box.  No doubt--no doubt--the Troubles are still flying about the world, and have increased in multitude, rather than lessened, and are a very ugly set of imps, and carry most venomous stings in their tails.  I have felt them already, and expect to feel them more, as I grow older.  But then that lovely and lightsome little figure of Hope! What in the world could we do without her?  Hope spiritualizes the earth; Hope makes it always new; and, even in the earth’s best and brightest aspect, Hope shows it to be only the shadow of an infinite bliss hereafter!    TANGLEWOOD PLAY-ROOM.  AFTER THE STORY.  “Primrose,” asked Eustace, pinching her ear, “how do you like my little Pandora?  Don’t you think her the exact picture of yourself?  But you would not have hesitated half so long about opening the box.”  “Then I should have been well punished for my naughtiness,” retorted Primrose, smartly; “for the first thing to pop out, after the lid was lifted, would have been Mr. Eustace Bright, in the shape of a Trouble.”  “Cousin Eustace,” said Sweet Fern, “did the box hold all the trouble that has ever come into the world?”  “Every mite of it!”  answered Eustace.  “This very snow-storm, which has spoiled my skating, was packed up there.”  “And how big was the box?” asked Sweet Fern.  “Why, perhaps three feet long,” said Eustace, “two feet wide, and two feet and a half high.”  “Ah,” said the child, “you are making fun of me, Cousin Eustace!  I know there is not trouble enough in the world to fill such a great box as that.  As for the snow-storm, it is no trouble at all, but a pleasure; so it could not have been in the box.”  “Hear the child!” cried Primrose, with an air of superiority.  “How little he knows about the troubles of this world!  Poor fellow!  He will be wiser when he has seen as much of life as I have.”  So saying, she began to skip the rope.  Meantime, the day was drawing towards its close.  Out of doors the scene certainly looked dreary.  There was a gray drift, far and wide, through the gathering twilight; the earth was as pathless as the air; and the bank of snow over the steps of the porch proved that nobody had entered or gone out for a good many hours past.  Had there been only one child at the window of Tanglewood, gazing at this wintry prospect, it would perhaps have made him sad.  But half a dozen children together, though they cannot quite turn the world into a paradise, may defy old Winter and all his storms to put them out of spirits.  Eustace Bright, moreover, on the spur of the moment, invented several new kinds of play, which kept them all in a roar of merriment till bedtime, and served for the next stormy day besides."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9257"],["title","The Three Golden Apples (#0)"],["body","WONDER-BOOK FOR GIRLS AND BOYS                       By Nathaniel Hawthorne                        THE THREE GOLDEN APPLES     CONTENTS:    TANGLEWOOD FIRESIDE--Introductory to “The Three Golden Apples”    THE THREE GOLDEN APPLES   TANGLEWOOD FIRESIDE--After the Story     INTRODUCTORY TO “THE THREE GOLDEN APPLES”  The snow-storm lasted another day; but what became of it afterwards, I cannot possibly imagine.  At any rate, it entirely cleared away, during the night; and when the sun arose, the next morning, it shone brightly down on as bleak a tract of hill-country, here in Berkshire, as could be seen anywhere in the world.  The frost-work had so covered the windowpanes that it was hardly possible to get a glimpse at the scenery outside.  But, while waiting for breakfast, the small populace of Tanglewood had scratched peepholes with their finger-nails, and saw with vast delight that--unless it were one or two bare patches on a precipitous hillside, or the gray effect of the snow, intermingled with the black pine forest--all nature was as white as a sheet.  How exceedingly pleasant!  And, to make it all the better, it was cold enough to nip one’s nose short off!  If people have but life enough in them to bear it, there is nothing that so raises the spirits, and makes the blood ripple and dance so nimbly, like a brook down the slope of a hill, as a bright, hard frost.  No sooner was breakfast over, than the whole party, well muffled in furs and woollens, floundered forth into the midst of the snow.  Well, what a day of frosty sport was this!  They slid down hill into the valley, a hundred times, nobody knows how far; and, to make it all the merrier, upsetting their sledges, and tumbling head over heels, quite as often as they came safely to the bottom.  And, once, Eustace Bright took Periwinkle, Sweet Fern, and Squash-blossom, on the sledge with him, by way of insuring a safe passage; and down they went, full speed.  But, behold, half-way down, the sledge hit against a hidden stump, and flung all four of its passengers into a heap; and, on gathering themselves up, there was no little Squash-blossom to be found!  Why, what could have become of the child?  And while they were wondering and staring about, up started Squash-blossom out of a snow-bank, with the reddest face you ever saw, and looking as if a large scarlet flower had suddenly sprouted up in midwinter.  Then there was a great laugh.  When they had grown tired of sliding down hill, Eustace set the children to digging a cave in the biggest snow-drift that they could find. Unluckily, just as it was completed, and the party had squeezed themselves into the hollow, down came the roof upon their heads, and buried every soul of them alive!  The next moment, up popped all their little heads out of the ruins, and the tall student’s head in the midst of them, looking hoary and venerable with the snow-dust that had got amongst his brown curls.  And then, to punish Cousin Eustace for advising them to dig such a tumble-down cavern, the children attacked him in a body, and so bepelted him with snowballs that he was fain to take to his heels.  So he ran away, and went into the woods, and thence to the margin of Shadow Brook, where he could hear the streamlet grumbling along, under great overhanging banks of snow and ice, which would scarcely let it see the light of day.  There were adamantine icicles glittering around all its little cascades.  Thence be strolled to the shore of the lake, and beheld a white, untrodden plain before him, stretching from his own feet to the foot of Monument Mountain.  And, it being now almost sunset, Eustace thought that he had never beheld anything so fresh and beautiful as the scene.  He was glad that the children were not with him; for their lively spirits and tumble-about activity would quite have chased away his higher and graver mood, so that he would merely have been merry (as he had already been, the whole day long), and would not have known the loveliness of the winter sunset among the hills.  When the sun was fairly down, our friend Eustace went home to eat his supper.  After the meal was over, he betook himself to the study, with a purpose, I rather imagine, to write an ode, or two or three sonnets, or verses of some kind or other, in praise of the purple and golden clouds which he had seen around the setting sun.  But, before he had hammered out the very first rhyme, the door opened, and Primrose and Periwinkle made their appearance.  “Go away, children!  I can’t be troubled with you now!” cried the student, looking over his shoulder, with the pen between his fingers. “What in the world do you want here?  I thought you were all in bed!”  “Hear him, Periwinkle, trying to talk like a grown man!” said Primrose. “And he seems to forget that I am now thirteen years old, and may sit up almost as late as I please.  But, Cousin Eustace, you must put off your airs, and come with us to the drawing-room.  The children have talked so much about your stories, that my father wishes to hear one of them, in order to judge whether they are likely to do any mischief.”  “Poh, poh, Primrose!” exclaimed the student, rather vexed.  “I don’t believe I can tell one of my stories in the presence of grown people. Besides, your father is a classical scholar; not that I am much afraid of his scholarship, neither, for I doubt not it is as rusty as an old case-knife, by this time.  But then he will be sure to quarrel with the admirable nonsense that I put into these stories, out of my own head, and which makes the great charm of the matter for children, like yourself.  No man of fifty, who has read the classical myths in his youth, can possibly understand my merit as a re-inventor and improver of them.”  “All this may be very true,” said Primrose, “but come you must!  My father will not open his book, nor will mamma open the piano, till you have given us some of your nonsense, as you very correctly call it. So be a good boy, and come along.”  Whatever he might pretend, the student was rather glad than otherwise, on second thoughts, to catch at the opportunity of proving to Mr. Pringle what an excellent faculty he had in modernizing the myths of ancient times.  Until twenty years of age, a young man may, indeed, be rather bashful about showing his poetry and his prose; but, for all that, he is pretty apt to think that these very productions would place him at the tip-top of literature, if once they could be known. Accordingly, without much more resistance, Eustace suffered Primrose and Periwinkle to drag him into the drawing-room.  It was a large handsome apartment, with a semicircular window at one end, in the recess of which stood a marble copy of Greenough’s Angel and Child.  On one side of the fireplace there were many shelves of books, gravely but richly bound.  The white light of the astrallamp, and the red glow of the bright coal-fire, made the room brilliant and cheerful; and before the fire, in a deep arm-chair, sat Mr. Pringle, looking just fit to be seated in such a chair, and in such a room.  He was a tall and quite a handsome gentleman, with a bald brow; and was always so nicely dressed, that even Eustace Bright never liked to enter his presence, without at least pausing at the threshold to settle his shirt-collar. But now, as Primrose had hold of one of his hands, and Periwinkle of the other, he was forced to make his appearance with a rough-and-tumble sort of look, as if he had been rolling all day in a snow-bank.  And so he had.  Mr. Pringle turned towards the student, benignly enough, but in a way that made him feel how uncombed and unbrushed he was, and how uncombed and unbrushed, likewise, were his mind and thoughts.  “Eustace,” said Mr. Pringle, with a smile, “I find that you are producing a great sensation among the little public of Tanglewood, by the exercise of your gifts of narrative.  Primrose here, as the little folks choose to call her, and the rest of the children, have been so loud in praise of your stories, that Mrs. Pringle and myself are really curious to hear a specimen.  It would be so much the more gratifying to myself, as the stories appear to be an attempt to render the fables of classical antiquity into the idiom of modern fancy and feeling.  At least, so I judge from a few of the incidents, which have come to me at second hand.”  “You are not exactly the auditor that I should have chosen, sir,”  observed the student, “for fantasies of this nature.”  “Possibly not,” replied Mr. Pringle.  “I suspect, however, that a young author’s most useful critic is precisely the one whom he would be least apt to choose.  Pray oblige me, therefore.”  “Sympathy, methinks, should have some little share in the critic’s qualifications,” murmured Eustace Bright.  “However, sir, if you will find patience, I will find stories.  But be kind enough to remember that I am addressing myself to the imagination and sympathies of the children, not to your own.”  Accordingly, the student snatched hold of the first theme which presented itself.  It was suggested by a plate of apples that he happened to spy on the mantel-piece.    THE THREE GOLDEN APPLES.  Did you ever hear of the golden apples, that grew in the garden of the Hesperides?  Ah, those were such apples as would bring a great price, by the bushel, if any of them could be found growing in the orchards of nowadays!  But there is not, I suppose, a graft of that wonderful fruit on a single tree in the wide world.  Not so much as a seed of those apples exists any longer.  And, even in the old, old, half-forgotten times, before the garden of the Hesperides was overrun with weeds, a great many people doubted whether there could be real trees that bore apples of solid gold upon their branches.  All had heard of them, but nobody remembered to have seen any.  Children, nevertheless, used to listen, open-mouthed, to stories of the golden apple-tree, and resolved to discover it, when they should be"]]]
