CANTO VI  MY sense reviving, that erewhile had droop'd With pity for the kindred shades, whence grief O'ercame me wholly, straight around I see New torments, new tormented souls, which way Soe'er I move, or turn, or bend my sight. In the third circle I arrive, of show'rs Ceaseless, accursed, heavy, and cold, unchang'd For ever, both in kind and in degree. Large hail, discolour'd water, sleety flaw Through the dun midnight air stream'd down amain: Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell.  Cerberus, cruel monster, fierce and strange, Through his wide threefold throat barks as a dog Over the multitude immers'd beneath. His eyes glare crimson, black his unctuous beard, His belly large, and claw'd the hands, with which He tears the spirits, flays them, and their limbs Piecemeal disparts.  Howling there spread, as curs, Under the rainy deluge, with one side The other screening, oft they roll them round, A wretched, godless crew.  When that great worm Descried us, savage Cerberus, he op'd His jaws, and the fangs show'd us; not a limb Of him but trembled.  Then my guide, his palms Expanding on the ground, thence filled with earth Rais'd them, and cast it in his ravenous maw.  E'en as a dog, that yelling bays for food His keeper, when the morsel comes, lets fall His fury, bent alone with eager haste To swallow it; so dropp'd the loathsome cheeks Of demon Cerberus, who thund'ring stuns The spirits, that they for deafness wish in vain.  We, o'er the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt Of the heavy tempest passing, set our feet Upon their emptiness, that substance seem'd.  They all along the earth extended lay Save one, that sudden rais'd himself to sit, Soon as that way he saw us pass.  \"O thou!\" He cried, \"who through the infernal shades art led, Own, if again thou know'st me.  Thou wast fram'd Or ere my frame was broken.\"  I replied: \"The anguish thou endur'st perchance so takes Thy form from my remembrance, that it seems As if I saw thee never.  But inform Me who thou art, that in a place so sad Art set, and in such torment, that although Other be greater, more disgustful none Can be imagin'd.\"  He in answer thus:  \"Thy city heap'd with envy to the brim, Ay that the measure overflows its bounds, Held me in brighter days.  Ye citizens Were wont to name me Ciacco.  For the sin Of glutt'ny, damned vice, beneath this rain, E'en as thou see'st, I with fatigue am worn; Nor I sole spirit in this woe: all these Have by like crime incurr'd like punishment.\"  No more he said, and I my speech resum'd: \"Ciacco! thy dire affliction grieves me much, Even to tears.  But tell me, if thou know'st, What shall at length befall the citizens Of the divided city; whether any just one Inhabit there: and tell me of the cause, Whence jarring discord hath assail'd it thus?\"  He then: \"After long striving they will come To blood; and the wild party from the woods Will chase the other with much injury forth. Then it behoves, that this must fall, within Three solar circles; and the other rise By borrow'd force of one, who under shore Now rests.  It shall a long space hold aloof Its forehead, keeping under heavy weight The other oppress'd, indignant at the load, And grieving sore.  The just are two in number, But they neglected.  Av'rice, envy, pride, Three fatal sparks, have set the hearts of all On fire.\"  Here ceas'd the lamentable sound; And I continu'd thus: \"Still would I learn More from thee, farther parley still entreat. Of Farinata and Tegghiaio say, They who so well deserv'd, of Giacopo, Arrigo, Mosca, and the rest, who bent Their minds on working good.  Oh! tell me where They bide, and to their knowledge let me come. For I am press'd with keen desire to hear, If heaven's sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell Be to their lip assign'd.\"   He answer'd straight: \"These are yet blacker spirits.  Various crimes Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss. If thou so far descendest, thou mayst see them. But to the pleasant world when thou return'st, Of me make mention, I entreat thee, there. No more I tell thee, answer thee no more.\"  This said, his fixed eyes he turn'd askance, A little ey'd me, then bent down his head, And 'midst his blind companions with it fell.  When thus my guide: \"No more his bed he leaves, Ere the last angel-trumpet blow.  The Power Adverse to these shall then in glory come, Each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair, Resume his fleshly vesture and his form, And hear the eternal doom re-echoing rend The vault.\"  So pass'd we through that mixture foul Of spirits and rain, with tardy steps; meanwhile Touching, though slightly, on the life to come. For thus I question'd: \"Shall these tortures, Sir! When the great sentence passes, be increas'd, Or mitigated, or as now severe?\"  He then: \"Consult thy knowledge; that decides That as each thing to more perfection grows, It feels more sensibly both good and pain. Though ne'er to true perfection may arrive This race accurs'd, yet nearer then than now They shall approach it.\"  Compassing that path Circuitous we journeyed, and discourse Much more than I relate between us pass'd: Till at the point, where the steps led below, Arriv'd, there Plutus, the great foe, we found.     CANTO VII  \"AH me!  O Satan!  Satan!\" loud exclaim'd Plutus, in accent hoarse of wild alarm: And the kind sage, whom no event surpris'd, To comfort me thus spake: \"Let not thy fear Harm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none To hinder down this rock thy safe descent.\" Then to that sworn lip turning, \"Peace!\"  he cried,  \"Curs'd wolf! thy fury inward on thyself Prey, and consume thee!  Through the dark profound Not without cause he passes.  So 't is will'd On high, there where the great Archangel pour'd Heav'n's vengeance on the first adulterer proud.\"  As sails full spread and bellying with the wind Drop suddenly collaps'd, if the mast split; So to the ground down dropp'd the cruel fiend.  Thus we, descending to the fourth steep ledge, Gain'd on the dismal shore, that all the woe Hems in of all the universe.  Ah me! Almighty Justice! in what store thou heap'st New pains, new troubles, as I here beheld! Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this?  E'en as a billow, on Charybdis rising, Against encounter'd billow dashing breaks; Such is the dance this wretched race must lead, Whom more than elsewhere numerous here I found, From one side and the other, with loud voice, Both roll'd on weights by main forge of their breasts, Then smote together, and each one forthwith Roll'd them back voluble, turning again, Exclaiming these, \"Why holdest thou so fast?\" Those answering, \"And why castest thou away?\" So still repeating their despiteful song, They to the opposite point on either hand Travers'd the horrid circle: then arriv'd, Both turn'd them round, and through the middle space Conflicting met again.  At sight whereof I, stung with grief, thus spake: \"O say, my guide! What race is this?  Were these, whose heads are shorn, On our left hand, all sep'rate to the church?\"  He straight replied: \"In their first life these all In mind were so distorted, that they made, According to due measure, of their wealth, No use.  This clearly from their words collect, Which they howl forth, at each extremity Arriving of the circle, where their crime Contrary in kind disparts them.  To the church Were separate those, that with no hairy cowls Are crown'd, both Popes and Cardinals, o'er whom Av'rice dominion absolute maintains.\"  I then: \"Mid such as these some needs must be, Whom I shall recognize, that with the blot Of these foul sins were stain'd.\"  He answering thus: \"Vain thought conceiv'st thou.  That ignoble life, Which made them vile before, now makes them dark, And to all knowledge indiscernible. Forever they shall meet in this rude shock: These from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise, Those with close-shaven locks.  That ill they gave, And ill they kept, hath of the beauteous world Depriv'd, and set them at this strife, which needs No labour'd phrase of mine to set it off. Now may'st thou see, my son! how brief, how vain, The goods committed into fortune's hands, For which the human race keep such a coil! Not all the gold, that is beneath the moon, Or ever hath been, of these toil-worn souls Might purchase rest for one.\"  I thus rejoin'd:  \"My guide! of thee this also would I learn; This fortune, that thou speak'st of, what it is, Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world?\"  He thus: \"O beings blind! what ignorance Besets you?  Now my judgment hear and mark. He, whose transcendent wisdom passes all, The heavens creating, gave them ruling powers To guide them, so that each part shines to each, Their light in equal distribution pour'd. By similar appointment he ordain'd Over the world's bright images to rule Superintendence of a guiding hand And general minister, which at due time May change the empty vantages of life From race to race, from one to other's blood, Beyond prevention of man's wisest care: Wherefore one nation rises into sway, Another languishes, e'en as her will Decrees, from us conceal'd, as in the grass The serpent train.  Against her nought avails Your utmost wisdom.  She with foresight plans, Judges, and carries on her reign, as theirs The other powers divine.  Her changes know None intermission: by necessity She is made swift, so frequent come who claim Succession in her favours.  This is she, So execrated e'en by those, whose debt To her is rather praise; they wrongfully With blame requite her, and with evil word; But she is blessed, and for that recks not: Amidst the other primal beings glad Rolls on her sphere, and in her bliss exults. Now on our way pass we, to heavier woe Descending: for each star is falling now, That mounted at our entrance, and forbids Too long our tarrying.\"  We the circle cross'd To the next steep, arriving at a well, That boiling pours itself down to a foss Sluic'd from its source.  Far murkier was the wave Than sablest grain: and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8789"],["title","The vision of hell. (#4)"],["body"," in company Of the inky waters, journeying by their side, Enter'd, though by a different track, beneath. Into a lake, the Stygian nam'd, expands The dismal stream, when it hath reach'd the foot Of the grey wither'd cliffs.  Intent I stood To gaze, and in the marish sunk descried A miry tribe, all naked, and with looks Betok'ning rage.  They with their hands alone Struck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet, Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs.  The good instructor spake; \"Now seest thou, son! The souls of those, whom anger overcame. This too for certain know, that underneath The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs Into these bubbles make the surface heave, As thine eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turn.\" Fix'd in the slime they say: \"Sad once were we In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun, Carrying a foul and lazy mist within: Now in these murky settlings are we sad.\" Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats. But word distinct can utter none.\"  Our route Thus compass'd we, a segment widely stretch'd Between the dry embankment, and the core Of the loath'd pool, turning meanwhile our eyes Downward on those who gulp'd its muddy lees; Nor stopp'd, till to a tower's low base we came.     CANTO VIII  MY theme pursuing, I relate that ere We reach'd the lofty turret's base, our eyes Its height ascended, where two cressets hung We mark'd, and from afar another light Return the signal, so remote, that scarce The eye could catch its beam.  I turning round To the deep source of knowledge, thus inquir'd: \"Say what this means?  and what that other light In answer set?  what agency doth this?\"  \"There on the filthy waters,\" he replied, \"E'en now what next awaits us mayst thou see, If the marsh-gender'd fog conceal it not.\"  Never was arrow from the cord dismiss'd, That ran its way so nimbly through the air, As a small bark, that through the waves I spied Toward us coming, under the sole sway Of one that ferried it, who cried aloud: \"Art thou arriv'd, fell spirit?\"--\"Phlegyas, Phlegyas, This time thou criest in vain,\" my lord replied; \"No longer shalt thou have us, but while o'er The slimy pool we pass.\"  As one who hears Of some great wrong he hath sustain'd, whereat Inly he pines; so Phlegyas inly pin'd In his fierce ire.  My guide descending stepp'd Into the skiff, and bade me enter next Close at his side; nor till my entrance seem'd The vessel freighted.  Soon as both embark'd, Cutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow, More deeply than with others it is wont.  While we our course o'er the dead channel held. One drench'd in mire before me came, and said; \"Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?\"  I answer'd: \"Though I come, I tarry not; But who art thou, that art become so foul?\"  \"One, as thou seest, who mourn:\" he straight replied.  To which I thus: \"In mourning and in woe, Curs'd spirit! tarry thou.g I know thee well, E'en thus in filth disguis'd.\"  Then stretch'd he forth Hands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage Aware, thrusting him back: \"Away! down there;  \"To the other dogs!\" then, with his arms my neck Encircling, kiss'd my cheek, and spake: \"O soul Justly disdainful! blest was she in whom Thou was conceiv'd!  He in the world was one For arrogance noted; to his memory No virtue lends its lustre; even so Here is his shadow furious.  There above How many now hold themselves mighty kings Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire, Leaving behind them horrible dispraise!\"  I then: \"Master! him fain would I behold Whelm'd in these dregs, before we quit the lake.\"  He thus: \"Or ever to thy view the shore Be offer'd, satisfied shall be that wish, Which well deserves completion.\"  Scarce his words Were ended, when I saw the miry tribes Set on him with such violence, that yet For that render I thanks to God and praise \"To Filippo Argenti:\" cried they all: And on himself the moody Florentine Turn'd his avenging fangs.  Him here we left, Nor speak I of him more.  But on mine ear Sudden a sound of lamentation smote, Whereat mine eye unbarr'd I sent abroad.  And thus the good instructor: \"Now, my son! Draws near the city, that of Dis is nam'd, With its grave denizens, a mighty throng.\"  I thus: \"The minarets already, Sir! There certes in the valley I descry, Gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire Had issu'd.\"  He replied: \"Eternal fire, That inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame Illum'd; as in this nether hell thou seest.\"  We came within the fosses deep, that moat This region comfortless.  The walls appear'd As they were fram'd of iron.  We had made Wide circuit, ere a place we reach'd, where loud The mariner cried vehement: \"Go forth! The entrance is here!\"  Upon the gates I spied More than a thousand, who of old from heaven Were hurl'd.  With ireful gestures, \"Who is this,\" They cried, \"that without death first felt, goes through The regions of the dead?\"  My sapient guide Made sign that he for secret parley wish'd; Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus They spake: \"Come thou alone; and let him go Who hath so hardily enter'd this realm. Alone return he by his witless way; If well he know it, let him prove.  For thee, Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark Hast been his escort.\" Now bethink thee, reader! What cheer was mine at sound of those curs'd words. I did believe I never should return.  \"O my lov'd guide! who more than seven times Security hast render'd me, and drawn From peril deep, whereto I stood expos'd, Desert me not,\" I cried, \"in this extreme. And if our onward going be denied, Together trace we back our steps with speed.\"  My liege, who thither had conducted me, Replied: \"Fear not: for of our passage none Hath power to disappoint us, by such high Authority permitted.  But do thou Expect me here; meanwhile thy wearied spirit Comfort, and feed with kindly hope, assur'd I will not leave thee in this lower world.\"  This said, departs the sire benevolent, And quits me.  Hesitating I remain At war 'twixt will and will not in my thoughts.  I could not hear what terms he offer'd them, But they conferr'd not long, for all at once To trial fled within.  Clos'd were the gates By those our adversaries on the breast Of my liege lord: excluded he return'd To me with tardy steps.  Upon the ground His eyes were bent, and from his brow eras'd All confidence, while thus with sighs he spake: \"Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?\" Then thus to me: \"That I am anger'd, think No ground of terror: in this trial I Shall vanquish, use what arts they may within For hindrance.  This their insolence, not new, Erewhile at gate less secret they display'd, Which still is without bolt; upon its arch Thou saw'st the deadly scroll: and even now On this side of its entrance, down the steep, Passing the circles, unescorted, comes One whose strong might can open us this land.\"     CANTO IX  THE hue, which coward dread on my pale cheeks Imprinted, when I saw my guide turn back, Chas'd that from his which newly they had worn, And inwardly restrain'd it.  He, as one Who listens, stood attentive: for his eye Not far could lead him through the sable air, And the thick-gath'ring cloud.  \"It yet behooves We win this fight\"--thus he began--\"if not-- Such aid to us is offer'd.--Oh, how long Me seems it, ere the promis'd help arrive!\"  I noted, how the sequel of his words Clok'd their beginning; for the last he spake Agreed not with the first.  But not the less My fear was at his saying; sith I drew To import worse perchance, than that he held, His mutilated speech.  \"Doth ever any Into this rueful concave's extreme depth Descend, out of the first degree, whose pain Is deprivation merely of sweet hope?\"  Thus I inquiring. \"Rarely,\" he replied, \"It chances, that among us any makes This journey, which I wend.  Erewhile 'tis true Once came I here beneath, conjur'd by fell Erictho, sorceress, who compell'd the shades Back to their bodies.  No long space my flesh Was naked of me, when within these walls She made me enter, to draw forth a spirit From out of Judas' circle.  Lowest place Is that of all, obscurest, and remov'd Farthest from heav'n's all-circling orb.  The road Full well I know: thou therefore rest secure. That lake, the noisome stench exhaling, round The city' of grief encompasses, which now We may not enter without rage.\"  Yet more He added: but I hold it not in mind, For that mine eye toward the lofty tower Had drawn me wholly, to its burning top. Where in an instant I beheld uprisen At once three hellish furies stain'd with blood: In limb and motion feminine they seem'd; Around them greenest hydras twisting roll'd Their volumes; adders and cerastes crept Instead of hair, and their fierce temples bound.  He knowing well the miserable hags Who tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake:  \"Mark thou each dire Erinnys. To the left This is Megaera; on the right hand she, Who wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone I' th' midst.\"  This said, in silence he remain'd Their breast they each one clawing tore; themselves Smote with their palms, and such shrill clamour rais'd, That to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound. \"Hasten Medusa: so to adamant Him shall we change;\" all looking down exclaim'd. \"E'en when by Theseus' might assail'd, we took No ill revenge.\"  \"Turn thyself round, and keep Thy count'nance hid; for if the Gorgon dire Be shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return Upwards would be for ever lost.\"  This said, Himself my gentle master turn'd me round, Nor trusted he my hands, but with his own He also hid me.  Ye of intellect Sound and entire, mark well the lore conceal'd Under close texture of the mystic strain!  And now there came o'er the perturbed waves Loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made Either shore tremble, as if of a wind Impetuous, from conflicting vapours sprung, That 'gainst some forest driving all its might, Plucks off the branches, beats them down and hurls Afar; then onward passing proudly sweeps Its whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly.  Mine eyes he loos'd, and"]]]
