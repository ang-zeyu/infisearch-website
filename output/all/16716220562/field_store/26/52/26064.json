On a raised tribune facing Washington Park stood the Governor of New York, and behind him were grouped the Mayor of New York and Brooklyn, the Inspector-General of Police, the Commandant of the state troops, Colonel Livingston, military aid to the President of the United States, General Blount, commanding at Governor's Island, Major-General Hamilton, commanding the garrison of New York and Brooklyn, Admiral Buffby of the fleet in the North River, Surgeon-General Lanceford, the staff of the National Free Hospital, Senators Wyse and Franklin of New York, and the Commissioner of Public Works. The tribune was surrounded by a squadron of hussars of the National Guard.  The Governor was finishing his reply to the short speech of the Surgeon-General. I heard him say: \"The laws prohibiting suicide and providing punishment for any attempt at self-destruction have been repealed. The Government has seen fit to acknowledge the right of man to end an existence which may have become intolerable to him, through physical suffering or mental despair. It is believed that the community will be benefited by the removal of such people from their midst. Since the passage of this law, the number of suicides in the United States has not increased. Now the Government has determined to establish a Lethal Chamber in every city, town and village in the country, it remains to be seen whether or not that class of human creatures from whose desponding ranks new victims of self-destruction fall daily will accept the relief thus provided.\" He paused, and turned to the white Lethal Chamber. The silence in the street was absolute. \"There a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life. If death is welcome let him seek it there.\" Then quickly turning to the military aid of the President's household, he said, \"I declare the Lethal Chamber open,\" and again facing the vast crowd he cried in a clear voice: \"Citizens of New York and of the United States of America, through me the Government declares the Lethal Chamber to be open.\"  The solemn hush was broken by a sharp cry of command, the squadron of hussars filed after the Governor's carriage, the lancers wheeled and formed along Fifth Avenue to wait for the commandant of the garrison, and the mounted police followed them. I left the crowd to gape and stare at the white marble Death Chamber, and, crossing South Fifth Avenue, walked along the western side of that thoroughfare to Bleecker Street. Then I turned to the right and stopped before a dingy shop which bore the sign:  HAWBERK, ARMOURER.  I glanced in at the doorway and saw Hawberk busy in his little shop at the end of the hall. He looked up, and catching sight of me cried in his deep, hearty voice, \"Come in, Mr. Castaigne!\" Constance, his daughter, rose to meet me as I crossed the threshold, and held out her pretty hand, but I saw the blush of disappointment on her cheeks, and knew that it was another Castaigne she had expected, my cousin Louis. I smiled at her confusion and complimented her on the banner she was embroidering from a coloured plate. Old Hawberk sat riveting the worn greaves of some ancient suit of armour, and the ting! ting! ting! of his little hammer sounded pleasantly in the quaint shop. Presently he dropped his hammer, and fussed about for a moment with a tiny wrench. The soft clash of the mail sent a thrill of pleasure through me. I loved to hear the music of steel brushing against steel, the mellow shock of the mallet on thigh pieces, and the jingle of chain armour. That was the only reason I went to see Hawberk. He had never interested me personally, nor did Constance, except for the fact of her being in love with Louis. This did occupy my attention, and sometimes even kept me awake at night. But I knew in my heart that all would come right, and that I should arrange their future as I expected to arrange that of my kind doctor, John Archer. However, I should never have troubled myself about visiting them just then, had it not been, as I say, that the music of the tinkling hammer had for me this strong fascination. I would sit for hours, listening and listening, and when a stray sunbeam struck the inlaid steel, the sensation it gave me was almost too keen to endure. My eyes would become fixed, dilating with a pleasure that stretched every nerve almost to breaking, until some movement of the old armourer cut off the ray of sunlight, then, still thrilling secretly, I leaned back and listened again to the sound of the polishing rag, swish! swish! rubbing rust from the rivets.  Constance worked with the embroidery over her knees, now and then pausing to examine more closely the pattern in the coloured plate from the Metropolitan Museum.  \"Who is this for?\" I asked.  Hawberk explained, that in addition to the treasures of armour in the Metropolitan Museum of which he had been appointed armourer, he also had charge of several collections belonging to rich amateurs. This was the missing greave of a famous suit which a client of his had traced to a little shop in Paris on the Quai d'Orsay. He, Hawberk, had negotiated for and secured the greave, and now the suit was complete. He laid down his hammer and read me the history of the suit, traced since 1450 from owner to owner until it was acquired by Thomas Stainbridge. When his superb collection was sold, this client of Hawberk's bought the suit, and since then the search for the missing greave had been pushed until it was, almost by accident, located in Paris.  \"Did you continue the search so persistently without any certainty of the greave being still in existence?\" I demanded.  \"Of course,\" he replied coolly.  Then for the first time I took a personal interest in Hawberk.  \"It was worth something to you,\" I ventured.  \"No,\" he replied, laughing, \"my pleasure in finding it was my reward.\"  \"Have you no ambition to be rich?\" I asked, smiling.  \"My one ambition is to be the best armourer in the world,\" he answered gravely.  Constance asked me if I had seen the ceremonies at the Lethal Chamber. She herself had noticed cavalry passing up Broadway that morning, and had wished to see the inauguration, but her father wanted the banner finished, and she had stayed at his request.  \"Did you see your cousin, Mr. Castaigne, there?\" she asked, with the slightest tremor of her soft eyelashes.  \"No,\" I replied carelessly. \"Louis' regiment is manoeuvring out in Westchester County.\" I rose and picked up my hat and cane.  \"Are you going upstairs to see the lunatic again?\" laughed old Hawberk. If Hawberk knew how I loathe that word \"lunatic,\" he would never use it in my presence. It rouses certain feelings within me which I do not care to explain. However, I answered him quietly: \"I think I shall drop in and see Mr. Wilde for a moment or two.\"  \"Poor fellow,\" said Constance, with a shake of the head, \"it must be hard to live alone year after year poor, crippled and almost demented. It is very good of you, Mr. Castaigne, to visit him as often as you do.\"  \"I think he is vicious,\" observed Hawberk, beginning again with his hammer. I listened to the golden tinkle on the greave plates; when he had finished I replied:  \"No, he is not vicious, nor is he in the least demented. His mind is a wonder chamber, from which he can extract treasures that you and I would give years of our life to acquire.\"'  Hawberk laughed.  I continued a little impatiently: \"He knows history as no one else could know it. Nothing, however trivial, escapes his search, and his memory is so absolute, so precise in details, that were it known in New York that such a man existed, the people could not honour him enough.\"  \"Nonsense,\" muttered Hawberk, searching on the floor for a fallen rivet.  \"Is it nonsense,\" I asked, managing to suppress what I felt, \"is it nonsense when he says that the tassets and cuissards of the enamelled suit of armour commonly known as the 'Prince's Emblazoned' can be found among a mass of rusty theatrical properties, broken stoves and ragpicker's refuse in a garret in Pell Street?\"  Hawberk's hammer fell to the ground, but he picked it up and asked, with a great deal of calm, how I knew that the tassets and left cuissard were missing from the \"Prince's Emblazoned.\"  \"I did not know until Mr. Wilde mentioned it to me the other day. He said they were in the garret of 998 Pell Street.\"  \"Nonsense,\" he cried, but I noticed his hand trembling under his leathern apron.  \"Is this nonsense too?\" I asked pleasantly, \"is it nonsense when Mr. Wilde continually speaks of you as the Marquis of Avonshire and of Miss Constance--\"  I did not finish, for Constance had started to her feet with terror written on every feature. Hawberk looked at me and slowly smoothed his leathern apron.  \"That is impossible,\" he observed, \"Mr. Wilde may know a great many things--\"  \"About armour, for instance, and the 'Prince's Emblazoned,'\" I interposed, smiling.  \"Yes,\" he continued, slowly, \"about armour also--may be--but he is wrong in regard to the Marquis of Avonshire, who, as you know, killed his wife's traducer years ago, and went to Australia where he did not long survive his wife.\"  \"Mr. Wilde is wrong,\" murmured Constance. Her lips were blanched, but her voice was sweet and calm.  \"Let us agree, if you please, that in this one circumstance Mr. Wilde is wrong,\" I said.     II  I climbed the three dilapidated flights of stairs, which I had so often climbed before, and knocked at a small door at the end of the corridor. Mr. Wilde opened the door and I walked in.  When he had double-locked the door and pushed a heavy chest against it, he came and sat down beside me, peering up into my face with his little light-coloured eyes. Half a dozen new scratches covered his nose and cheeks, and the silver wires which supported his artificial ears had become displaced. I thought I had never seen him so hideously fascinating. He had no ears. The artificial ones, which now"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8492"],["title","The King in Yellow (#2)"],["body","out at an angle from the fine wire, were his one weakness. They were made of wax and painted a shell pink, but the rest of his face was yellow. He might better have revelled in the luxury of some artificial fingers for his left hand, which was absolutely fingerless, but it seemed to cause him no inconvenience, and he was satisfied with his wax ears. He was very small, scarcely higher than a child of ten, but his arms were magnificently developed, and his thighs as thick as any athlete's. Still, the most remarkable thing about Mr. Wilde was that a man of his marvellous intelligence and knowledge should have such a head. It was flat and pointed, like the heads of many of those unfortunates whom people imprison in asylums for the weak-minded. Many called him insane, but I knew him to be as sane as I was.  I do not deny that he was eccentric; the mania he had for keeping that cat and teasing her until she flew at his face like a demon, was certainly eccentric. I never could understand why he kept the creature, nor what pleasure he found in shutting himself up in his room with this surly, vicious beast. I remember once, glancing up from the manuscript I was studying by the light of some tallow dips, and seeing Mr. Wilde squatting motionless on his high chair, his eyes fairly blazing with excitement, while the cat, which had risen from her place before the stove, came creeping across the floor right at him. Before I could move she flattened her belly to the ground, crouched, trembled, and sprang into his face. Howling and foaming they rolled over and over on the floor, scratching and clawing, until the cat screamed and fled under the cabinet, and Mr. Wilde turned over on his back, his limbs contracting and curling up like the legs of a dying spider. He _was_ eccentric.  Mr. Wilde had climbed into his high chair, and, after studying my face, picked up a dog's-eared ledger and opened it.  \"Henry B. Matthews,\" he read, \"book-keeper with Whysot Whysot and Company, dealers in church ornaments. Called April 3rd. Reputation damaged on the race-track. Known as a welcher. Reputation to be repaired by August 1st. Retainer Five Dollars.\" He turned the page and ran his fingerless knuckles down the closely-written columns.  \"P. Greene Dusenberry, Minister of the Gospel, Fairbeach, New Jersey. Reputation damaged in the Bowery. To be repaired as soon as possible. Retainer $100.\"  He coughed and added, \"Called, April 6th.\"  \"Then you are not in need of money, Mr. Wilde,\" I inquired.  \"Listen,\" he coughed again.  \"Mrs. C. Hamilton Chester, of Chester Park, New York City. Called April 7th. Reputation damaged at Dieppe, France. To be repaired by October 1st Retainer $500.  \"Note.--C. Hamilton Chester, Captain U.S.S. 'Avalanche', ordered home from South Sea Squadron October 1st.\"  \"Well,\" I said, \"the profession of a Repairer of Reputations is lucrative.\"  His colourless eyes sought mine, \"I only wanted to demonstrate that I was correct. You said it was impossible to succeed as a Repairer of Reputations; that even if I did succeed in certain cases it would cost me more than I would gain by it. To-day I have five hundred men in my employ, who are poorly paid, but who pursue the work with an enthusiasm which possibly may be born of fear. These men enter every shade and grade of society; some even are pillars of the most exclusive social temples; others are the prop and pride of the financial world; still others, hold undisputed sway among the 'Fancy and the Talent.' I choose them at my leisure from those who reply to my advertisements. It is easy enough, they are all cowards. I could treble the number in twenty days if I wished. So you see, those who have in their keeping the reputations of their fellow-citizens, I have in my pay.\"  \"They may turn on you,\" I suggested.  He rubbed his thumb over his cropped ears, and adjusted the wax substitutes. \"I think not,\" he murmured thoughtfully, \"I seldom have to apply the whip, and then only once. Besides they like their wages.\"  \"How do you apply the whip?\" I demanded.  His face for a moment was awful to look upon. His eyes dwindled to a pair of green sparks.  \"I invite them to come and have a little chat with me,\" he said in a soft voice.  A knock at the door interrupted him, and his face resumed its amiable expression.  \"Who is it?\" he inquired.  \"Mr. Steylette,\" was the answer.  \"Come to-morrow,\" replied Mr. Wilde.  \"Impossible,\" began the other, but was silenced by a sort of bark from Mr. Wilde.  \"Come to-morrow,\" he repeated.  We heard somebody move away from the door and turn the corner by the stairway.  \"Who is that?\" I asked.  \"Arnold Steylette, Owner and Editor in Chief of the great New York daily.\"  He drummed on the ledger with his fingerless hand adding: \"I pay him very badly, but he thinks it a good bargain.\"  \"Arnold Steylette!\" I repeated amazed.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Wilde, with a self-satisfied cough.  The cat, which had entered the room as he spoke, hesitated, looked up at him and snarled. He climbed down from the chair and squatting on the floor, took the creature into his arms and caressed her. The cat ceased snarling and presently began a loud purring which seemed to increase in timbre as he stroked her. \"Where are the notes?\" I asked. He pointed to the table, and for the hundredth time I picked up the bundle of manuscript entitled--  \"THE IMPERIAL DYNASTY OF AMERICA.\"  One by one I studied the well-worn pages, worn only by my own handling, and although I knew all by heart, from the beginning, \"When from Carcosa, the Hyades, Hastur, and Aldebaran,\" to \"Castaigne, Louis de Calvados, born December 19th, 1877,\" I read it with an eager, rapt attention, pausing to repeat parts of it aloud, and dwelling especially on \"Hildred de Calvados, only son of Hildred Castaigne and Edythe Landes Castaigne, first in succession,\" etc., etc.  When I finished, Mr. Wilde nodded and coughed.  \"Speaking of your legitimate ambition,\" he said, \"how do Constance and Louis get along?\"  \"She loves him,\" I replied simply.  The cat on his knee suddenly turned and struck at his eyes, and he flung her off and climbed on to the chair opposite me.  \"And Dr. Archer! But that's a matter you can settle any time you wish,\" he added.  \"Yes,\" I replied, \"Dr. Archer can wait, but it is time I saw my cousin Louis.\"  \"It is time,\" he repeated. Then he took another ledger from the table and ran over the leaves rapidly. \"We are now in communication with ten thousand men,\" he muttered. \"We can count on one hundred thousand within the first twenty-eight hours, and in forty-eight hours the state will rise _en masse_. The country follows the state, and the portion that will not, I mean California and the Northwest, might better never have been inhabited. I shall not send them the Yellow Sign.\"  The blood rushed to my head, but I only answered, \"A new broom sweeps clean.\"  \"The ambition of Caesar and of Napoleon pales before that which could not rest until it had seized the minds of men and controlled even their unborn thoughts,\" said Mr. Wilde.  \"You are speaking of the King in Yellow,\" I groaned, with a shudder.  \"He is a king whom emperors have served.\"  \"I am content to serve him,\" I replied.  Mr. Wilde sat rubbing his ears with his crippled hand. \"Perhaps Constance does not love him,\" he suggested.  I started to reply, but a sudden burst of military music from the street below drowned my voice. The twentieth dragoon regiment, formerly in garrison at Mount St. Vincent, was returning from the manoeuvres in Westchester County, to its new barracks on East Washington Square. It was my cousin's regiment. They were a fine lot of fellows, in their pale blue, tight-fitting jackets, jaunty busbys and white riding breeches with the double yellow stripe, into which their limbs seemed moulded. Every other squadron was armed with lances, from the metal points of which fluttered yellow and white pennons. The band passed, playing the regimental march, then came the colonel and staff, the horses crowding and trampling, while their heads bobbed in unison, and the pennons fluttered from their lance points. The troopers, who rode with the beautiful English seat, looked brown as berries from their bloodless campaign among the farms of Westchester, and the music of their sabres against the stirrups, and the jingle of spurs and carbines was delightful to me. I saw Louis riding with his squadron. He was as handsome an officer as I have ever seen. Mr. Wilde, who had mounted a chair by the window, saw him too, but said nothing. Louis turned and looked straight at Hawberk's shop as he passed, and I could see the flush on his brown cheeks. I think Constance must have been at the window. When the last troopers had clattered by, and the last pennons vanished into South Fifth Avenue, Mr. Wilde clambered out of his chair and dragged the chest away from the door.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"it is time that you saw your cousin Louis.\"  He unlocked the door and I picked up my hat and stick and stepped into the corridor. The stairs were dark. Groping about, I set my foot on something soft, which snarled and spit, and I aimed a murderous blow at the cat, but my cane shivered to splinters against the balustrade, and the beast scurried back into Mr. Wilde's room.  Passing Hawberk's door again I saw him still at work on the armour, but I did not stop, and stepping out into Bleecker Street, I followed it to Wooster, skirted the grounds of the Lethal Chamber, and crossing Washington Park went straight to my rooms in the Benedick. Here I lunched comfortably, read the _Herald_ and the _Meteor_, and finally went to the steel safe in my bedroom and set the time combination. The three and three-quarter minutes which it is necessary to wait, while the time lock is opening, are to me golden moments. From the instant I set the combination to the moment when I grasp the knobs and swing back the solid steel doors, I live in an ecstasy of expectation. Those moments must be like"]]]
