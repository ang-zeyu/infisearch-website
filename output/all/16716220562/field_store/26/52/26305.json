Erect, as if conscious of its striking beauty, this vivid lily lifts a chalice that suggests a trap for catching sunbeams from fiery old Sol. Defiant of his scorching rays in its dry habitat, it neither nods nor droops even during prolonged drought; and yet many people confuse it with the gracefully pendent, swaying bells of the yellow Canada Lily, which will grow in a swamp rather than forego moisture. _La_, the Celtic for white, from which the family derived its name, makes this bright-hued flower blush to own it. Seedsmen, who export quantities of our superb native lilies to Europe, supply bulbs so cheap that no one should wait four years for flowers from seed, or go without their splendor in our over-conventional gardens.   Yellow Adder's Tongue; Trout Lily; Dog-tooth \"Violet\"  _Erythronium americanum_  _Flower_--Solitary, pale russet yellow, rarely tinged with purple, slightly fragrant, 1 to 2 in. long, nodding from the summit of a root-stalk 6 to 12 in, high, or about as tall as the leaves. Perianth bell-shaped, of 6 petal-like, distinct segments, spreading at tips, dark spotted within; 6 stamens; the club-shaped style with 3 short, stigmatic ridges. _Leaves:_ 2, unequal, grayish green, mottled and streaked with brown or all green, oblong, 3 to 8 in. long, narrowing into clasping petioles.  _Preferred Habitat_--Moist open woods and thickets, brooksides.  _Flowering Season_--March-May.  _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to Florida, westward to the Mississippi.  Colonies of these dainty little lilies, that so often grow beside leaping brooks where and when the trout hide, justify at least one of their names; but they have nothing in common with the violet or a dog's tooth. Their faint fragrance rather suggests a tulip; and as for the bulb, which in some of the lily-kin has toothlike scales, it is in this case a smooth, egg-shaped corm, producing little round offsets from its base. Much fault is also found with another name on the plea that the curiously mottled and delicately pencilled leaves bring to mind, not a snake's tongue, but its skin, as they surely do. Whoever sees the sharp purplish point of a young plant darting above ground in earliest spring, however, at once sees the fitting application of adder's tongue. But how few recognize their plant friends at all seasons of the year!  Every one must have noticed the abundance of low-growing spring flowers in deciduous woodlands, where, later in the year, after the leaves overhead cast a heavy shade, so few blossoms are to be found, because their light is seriously diminished. The thrifty adder's tongue, by laying up nourishment in its storeroom underground through the winter, is ready to send its leaves and flower upward to take advantage of the sunlight the still naked trees do not intercept, just as soon as the ground thaws.   Yellow Clintonia  _Clintonia borealis_  _Flowers--_Straw color or greenish yellow, less than 1 in. long, 3 to 6 _nodding_ on slender pedicels from the summit of a leafless scape 6 to 15 in. tall. Perianth of 6 spreading divisions, the 6 stamens attached; style, 3-lobed. _Leaves:_ Dark, glossy, large, oval to oblong, 2 to 5 (usually 3), sheathing at the base. _Fruit:_ Oval blue berries on _upright_ pedicels.  _Preferred Habitat_--Moist, rich, cool woods and thickets.  _Flowering Season_--May-June.  _Distribution-_--From the Carolinas and Wisconsin far northward.  To name canals, bridges, city thoroughfares, booming factory towns after De Witt Clinton seems to many appropriate enough; but why a shy little woodland flower? As fitly might a wee white violet carry down the name of Theodore Roosevelt to posterity! \"Gray should not have named the flower from the Governor of New York,\" complains Thoreau. \"What is he to the lovers of flowers in Massachusetts? If named after a man, it must be a man of flowers.\" So completely has Clinton, the practical man of affairs, obliterated Clinton, the naturalist, from the popular mind, that, were it not for this plant keeping his memory green, we should be in danger of forgetting the weary, overworked governor, fleeing from care to the woods and fields; pursuing in the open air the study which above all others delighted and refreshed him; revealing in every leisure moment a too-often forgotten side of his many-sided greatness.   Wild Spikenard; False Solomon's Seal; Solomon's Zig-zag  _Smilacina racemosa_  _Flowers_--White or greenish, small, slightly fragrant, in a densely flowered terminal raceme. Perianth of 6 separate, spreading segments; 6 stamens; 1 pistil. _Stem:_ Simple, somewhat angled, 1 to 3 ft. high, scaly below, leafy, and sometimes finely hairy above. _Leaves:_ Alternate and seated along stem, oblong, lance-shaped, 3 to 6 in. long, finely hairy beneath. _Rootstock:_ Thick, fleshy. _Fruit:_ A cluster of aromatic, round, pale red speckled berries.  _Preferred Habitat_--Moist woods, thickets, hillsides.  _Flowering Season_--May-July.  _Distribution_--Nova Scotia to Georgia; westward to Arizona and British Columbia.  As if to offer opportunities for comparison to the confused novice, the true Solomon's Seal and the so-called false species--quite as honest a plant--usually grow near each other. Grace of line, rather than beauty of blossom, gives them both their chief charm. But the feathery plume of greenish-white blossoms that crowns the false Solomon's Seal's somewhat zig-zagged stem is very different from the small, greenish, bell-shaped flowers, usually nodding in pairs along the stem, under the leaves, from the axils of the true Solomon's Seal. Later in summer, when hungry birds wander through the woods with increased families, the Wild Spikenard offers them branching clusters of pale red speckled berries, whereas the former plant feasts them with blue-black fruit.   Hairy, or True, or Twin-flowered Solomon's Seal  _Polygonatum biflorum_  _Flowers_--Whitish or yellowish green, tubular, bell-shaped, 1 to 4, but usually 2, drooping on slender peduncles from leaf axils. Perianth 6-lobed at entrance, but not spreading; 6 stamens, the filaments roughened; 1 pistil. _Stem:_ Simple, slender, arching, leafy, 8 in. to 3 ft. long. _Leaves:_ Oval, pointed, or lance-shaped, alternate, 2 to 4 in. long, seated on stem, pale beneath and softly hairy along veins. _Rootstock:_ Thick, horizontal, jointed, scarred. (_Polygonatum_ = many joints.) _Fruit:_ A blue-black berry.  _Preferred Habitat_--Woods, thickets, shady banks.  _Flowering Season_--April-June.  _Distribution_--New Brunswick to Florida, westward to Michigan.  From a many-jointed, thick rootstock a single graceful curved stem arises each spring, withers after fruiting, and leaves a round scar, whose outlines suggested to the fanciful man who named the genus the seal of Israel's wise king. Thus one may know the age of a root by its seals, as one tells that of a tree by the rings in its trunk.   Early or Dwarf Wake-Robin  _Trillium nivale_  _Flowers_--Solitary, pure white, about 1 in. long, on an erect or curved peduncle, from a whorl of 3 leaves at summit of stem. Three spreading, green, narrowly oblong sepals; 3 oval or oblong petals; 6 stamens, the anthers about as long as filaments; 3 slender styles stigmatic along inner side. _Stem_: 2 to 6 in. high, from a short, tuber-like rootstock. _Leaves_: 3 in a whorl below the flower, 1 to 2 in. long, broadly oval, rounded at end, on short petioles. _Fruit_: A 3-lobed reddish berry, about 1/2 in. diameter, the sepals adhering.  _Preferred Habitat_--Rich, moist woods and thickets.  _Flowering Season_--March-May.  _Distribution_--Pennsylvania, westward to Minnesota and Iowa, south to Kentucky.  Only this delicate little flower, as white as the snow it sometimes must push through to reach the sunshine melting the last drifts in the leafless woods, can be said to wake the robins into song; a full chorus of feathered love-makers greets the appearance of the more widely distributed, and therefore better known, species.  By the rule of three all the trilliums, as their name implies, regulate their affairs. Three sepals, three petals, twice three stamens, three styles, a three-celled ovary, the flower growing out from a whorl of three leaves, make the naming of wake-robins a simple matter to the novice.  One of the most chastely beautiful of our native wild flowers--so lovely that many shady nooks in English rock-gardens and ferneries contain imported clumps of the vigorous plant--is the Large-flowered Wake-Robin, or White Wood Lily (_T. grandiflorum_). Under favorable conditions the waxy, thin, white, or occasionally pink, strongly veined petals may exceed two inches; and in Michigan a monstrous form has been found. The broadly rhombic leaves, tapering to a point, and lacking petioles, are seated in the usual whorl of three, at the summit of the stem, which may attain a foot and a half in height; from the centre the decorative flower arises on a long peduncle.  Certainly the commonest trillium in the East, although it thrives as far westward as Ontario and Missouri, and south to Georgia, is the Nodding Wake-Robin (_T. cernuum_), whose white or pinkish flower droops from its peduncle until it is all but hidden under the whorl of broadly rhombic, tapering leaves. The wavy margined petals, about as long as the sepals--that is to say, half an inch long or over--curve backward at maturity. One finds the plant in bloom from April to June, according to the climate of its long range.         *       *       *       *       *  Perhaps the most strikingly beautiful member of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8866"],["title","Wild Flowers Worth Knowing (#4)"],["body","is the Painted Trillium (_T. undulatum_ or _T. erythrocarpum_). At the summit of the slender stem, rising perhaps only eight inches, or maybe twice as high, this charming flower spreads its long, wavy-edged, waxy-white petals veined and striped with deep pink or wine color. The large ovate leaves, long-tapering to a point, are rounded at the base into short petioles. The rounded, three-angled, bright red, shining berry is seated in the persistent calyx. With the same range as the nodding trillium's, the Painted Wake-Robin comes into bloom nearly a month later--in May and June--when all the birds are not only wide awake, but have finished courting, and are busily engaged in the most serious business of life.   Purple Trillium, Ill-scented Wake-Robin, or Birth-root  _Trillium erectum_  _Flowers_--Solitary, dark, dull purple, or purplish red; rarely greenish, white, or pinkish; on erect or slightly inclined footstalk. Calyx of 3 spreading sepals, 1 to 1-1/2 in. long, or about length of 3 pointed, oval petals; stamens, 6; anthers longer than filaments; pistil spreading into 3 short, recurved stigmas. _Stem:_ Stout, 8 to 16 in. high, from tuber-like rootstock. _Leaves:_ In a whorl of 3; broadly ovate, abruptly pointed, netted-veined. _Fruit:_ A 6-angled, ovate, reddish berry.  _Preferred Habitat--Rich_, moist woods.  _Flowering Season_--April-June.  _Distribution_--Nova Scotia westward to Manitoba, southward to North Carolina and Missouri.  Some weeks after the jubilant, alert robins have returned from the South, the Purple Trillium unfurls its unattractive, carrion-scented flower. In the variable colors found in different regions, one can almost trace its evolution from green, white, and red to purple, which, we are told, is the course all flowers must follow to attain to blue. The white and pink forms, however attractive to the eye, are never more agreeable to the nose than the reddish-purple ones. Bees and butterflies, with delicate appreciation of color and fragrance, let the blossom alone, since it secretes no nectar; and one would naturally infer either that it can fertilize itself without insect aid--a theory which closer study of its organs goes far to disprove--or that the carrion-scent, so repellent to us, is in itself an attraction to certain insects needful for cross-pollination. Which are they? Beetles have been observed crawling over the flower, but without effecting any methodical result. One inclines to accept Mr. Clarence M. Weed's theory of special adaptation to the common green flesh-flies (_Lucilia carnicina_), which would naturally be attracted to a flower resembling in color and odor a raw beefsteak of uncertain age. These little creatures, seen in every butcher shop throughout the summer, the flower furnishes with a free lunch of pollen in consideration of the transportation of a few grains to another blossom. Absence of the usual floral attractions gives the carrion flies a practical monopoly of the pollen food, which no doubt tastes as it smells.  The Sessile-flowered Wake-Robin (_T. sessile_), whose dark purple, purplish-red, or greenish blossom, narrower of sepal and petals than the preceding, is seated in a whorl of three egg-shaped, sometimes blotched, leaves, possesses a rather pleasant odor; nevertheless, it seems to have no great attraction for insects. The stigmas, which are very large, almost touch the anthers surrounding them; therefore the beetles which one frequently sees crawling over them to feed on the pollen so jar them, no doubt, as to self-fertilize the flower; but it is scarcely probable these slow crawlers often transfer the grains from one blossom to another. A degraded flower like this has little need of color and perfume, one would suppose; yet it may be even now slowly perfecting its way toward an ideal of which we see a part only complete. In deep, rich, moist woods and thickets the sessile trillium blooms in April or May, from Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Minnesota southward nearly to the Gulf.   Carrion-flower  _Smilax herbacea_  _Flowers_--Carrion-scented, yellowish-green, 15 to 80 small, 6-parted ones clustered in an umbel on a long peduncle. _Stem:_ Smooth, unarmed, climbing with the help of tendril-like appendages from the base of leafstalks. _Leaves:_ Egg-shaped, heart-shaped, or rounded, pointed tipped, parallel-nerved, petioled. _Fruit:_ Bluish-black berries.  _Preferred Habitat_--Moist soil, thickets, woods, roadside fences.  _Flowering Season_--April-June.  _Distribution_--Northern Canada to the Gulf states, westward to Nebraska.  \"It would be safe to say,\" says John Burroughs, \"that there is a species of smilax with an unsavory name, that the bee does not visit, _herbacea_. The production of this plant is a curious freak of nature.... It would be a cruel joke to offer it to any person not acquainted with it, to smell. It is like the vent of a charnel-house.\" (Thoreau compared its odor to that of a dead rat in a wall!) \"It is first cousin to the trilliums, among the prettiest of our native wild flowers,\" continues Burroughs, \"and the same bad blood crops out in the Purple Trillium or Birth-root.\"  Strange that so close an observer as Burroughs or Thoreau should not have credited the carrion-flower with being something more intelligent than a mere repellent freak! Like the Purple Trillium, it has deliberately adapted itself to please its benefactors, the little green flesh-flies so commonly seen about untidy butcher shops in summer.     AMARYLLIS FAMILY _(Amaryllidaceae)_   Yellow Star-grass  _Hypoxis hirsuta (H. erecta)_  _Flowers_--Bright yellow within, greenish and hairy outside, about 1/2 in. across, 6-parted; the perianth divisions spreading, narrowly oblong; a few flowers at the summit of a rough, hairy scape 2 to 6 in. high. _Leaves:_ All from an egg-shaped corm; mostly longer than scapes, slender, grass-like, more or less hairy.  _Preferred Habitat_--Dry, open woods, prairies, grassy waste places, fields.  _Flowering Season_--May-October.  _Distribution_--From Maine far westward, and south to the Gulf of Mexico.  Usually only one of these little blossoms in a cluster on each plant opens at a time; but that one peers upward so brightly from among the grass it cannot well be overlooked. Sitting in a meadow sprinkled over with these yellow stars, we see coming to them many small bees--chiefly Halictus--to gather pollen for their unhatched babies' bread. Of course they do not carry all the pollen to their tunnelled nurseries; some must often be rubbed off on the sticky pistil tip in the centre of other stars. The stamens radiate, that self-fertilization need not take place except as a last extremity. Visitors failing, the little flower closes, bringing its pollen-laden anthers in contact with its own stigma.      IRIS FAMILY _(Iridaceae)_   Larger Blue Flag; Blue Iris; Fleur-de-lis; Flower-de-luce  _Iris versicolor_  _Flowers_--Several, 2 to 3 in. long, violet-blue variegated with yellow, green, or white, and purple veined. Six divisions of the perianth: 3 outer ones spreading, recurved; 1 of them bearded, much longer and wider than the 3 erect inner divisions; all united into a short tube. Three stamens under 3 overhanging petal-like divisions of the style, notched at end; under each notch is a thin plate, smooth on one side, rough and moist (stigma) on side turned away from anther. _Stem:_ 2 to 3 ft. high, stout, straight, almost circular, sometimes branching above. _Leaves:_ Erect, sword-shaped, shorter than stem, somewhat hoary, from 1/2 to 1 in. wide, folded, and in a compact flat cluster at base; bracts usually longer than stem of flower. _Fruit:_ Oblong capsule, not prominently 3-lobed, and with 2 rows of round, flat seeds closely packed in each cell. _Rootstock:_ Creeping, horizontal, fleshy.  _Preferred Habitat_--Marshes, wet meadows.  _Flowering Season_--May-July.  _Distribution_--Newfoundland and Manitoba to Arkansas and Florida.  This gorgeous flower is thought by scientists to be all that it is for the bees' benefit, which, of course, is its own also. Abundant moisture, from which to manufacture nectar--a prime necessity with most irises--certainly is for our blue flag. The large, showy blossom cannot but attract the passing bee, whose favorite color (according to Sir John Lubbock) it waves. The bee alights on the convenient, spreading platform, and, guided by the dark veining and golden lines leading to the nectar, sips the delectable fluid shortly to be changed to honey. Now, as he raises his head and withdraws it from the nectary, he must rub it against the pollen-laden anther above, and some of the pollen necessarily falls on the visitor. As the sticky side of the plate (stigma), just under the petal-like division of the style, faces away from the anther, which is below it in any case, the flower is marvellously guarded against fertilization from its own pollen. The bee, flying off to another iris, must first brush past the projecting lip of the overarching style, and leave on the stigmatic outer surface of the plate some of the pollen brought from the first flower, before reaching the nectary. Thus cross-fertilization is effected; and Darwin has shown how necessary this is to insure the most vigorous and beautiful offspring. Without this wonderful adaptation of the flower to the requirements of its insect friends, and of the insect to the needs of the flower, both must perish; the former from hunger, the latter because unable to perpetuate its race. And yet man has greedily appropriated all the beauties of the floral kingdom as designed for his sole delight!  \"The fleur-de-lys, which is the flower of chivalry,\" says Ruskin, \"has a sword for its leaf and a lily for its heart.\" When that young and pious Crusader, Louis VII, adopted it for the emblem of his house, spelling was scarcely an exact science, and the _fleur-de-Louis_ soon became corrupted into its present form. Doubtless the royal flower was the white iris, and as _li_ is the "]]]
