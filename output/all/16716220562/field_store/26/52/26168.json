I have decided I shall not stand in Betty's way, I shall go away this summer and leave you girls to work things out together, then when I return I may be able to discover what miracles have been wrought in you.\"  \"Oh, you will find us entirely reformed,\" Polly answered carelessly, not realizing that she of all the girls in the room would be the one to bear the ordeal of fire, the symbol that cleanses and purifies.  But both the girl and woman suddenly became silent, for Dick Ashton had persuaded Esther Clark to the piano and now the entire group of guests closed in about her.  Once again she was singing the morning and evening hymn of the Camp Fire Girls' \"My Soul's Desire.\"  Mrs. Ashton sat listening intently with an odd expression of something almost like relief crossing her face.  \"Polly dear,\" she whispered unexpectedly at the close of Esther's song, \"perhaps life does even things up more justly than we know, for this strange girl, Esther Clark, has a truly remarkable voice.\"     CHAPTER VII  WHITE CLOUDS   \"White clouds, whose shadows haunt the deep, Light mists, whose soft embraces keep The sunshine on the bills asleep.\"  The sun was just rising above the crests of a group of the White Mountains called long ago by the indians \"Waumbek\" because of their snowy foreheads. But this morning, instead of shining like crystal, the snow at their summits was opal tinted rose, yellow and violet from the early rays of the June sun.  Sunrise Hill, standing in the foreground, seemed to catch an even stronger reflection from the sky, for the colors drained down its sides until they emptied into a small, wooded lake at its base.  On either side this hill the sloping lands were a soft green and the meadows beyond golden with the new summer grain, but only fifty yards away a grove of pine trees made a deep mass of shade, and with the birds in their branches singing their daily matins, suggested an old cathedral choir.  The singers were evidently indifferent to intruders, for, close by, four white tents were pitched in a square as though a caravan had halted on its travels.  But the caravaneers must have been in the place for some days and showed no intention of moving on, for their arrangements had been made with the idea of permanent comfort.  Around each tent a narrow trench several inches deep had been dug to prevent flooding in case of rain, farther off two large bins held all rubbish until such time as it could be conveniently burned.  The camp ground was also beautifully clean, not a scrap of paper nor a tin can could be seen anywhere, and even the grass itself had been swept with a novel, but at the same time, a very old-fashioned broom, for a stake tightly bound with a few sprigs of birch rested against one of the tents, plainly--from the evidences about it--the kitchen tent.  At a safe distance a camp fire was smoldering, a fire built according to the best scout methods.  Two stout stakes driven slantwise in the ground with three logs cut the same length, one on top the other, resting against these stakes.  On either side this elevation two logs lay on the ground like fire logs, with a third crossing them in front, and inside this enclosure a bed of ashes still glowed, carefully covered over for the night.  On the lake two birch bark canoes were moored to willow stakes, and hanging on a line stretching from a tree to a pole a number of girls' bathing suits flapped and danced in the air, but no human being was yet in sight.  Suddenly there came a ripple of music from one of the pine trees, \"Whee-you, whee-you,\" a small bird with a spotted breast and a cream-buff coat sang to itself and then began a whistling, ringing monotone that for a moment silenced the other bird chorus.  A girl in a dark red dressing gown quietly opened a tent flap.  \"There, the morning has come at last, for that is the voice of 'Oopehanka', the thrush.  So after a week in the woods I really am beginning to recognize some of the birds and the Indian names for them.\" She clapped her hands softly together.  \"Oh, Princess, do wake up and let us have a swim before any one else wakens,\" she whispered imploringly.  Then disappearing inside her tent, she knelt by a bed of hemlock branches covered with soft blue blankets.  \"Princess,\" she whispered again.  A sleepy voice answered.  \"Polly child, please go back to bed, it must be the middle of the night and I ache all over from carrying water and digging trenches.  Who could have supposed camping would be such a lot of work!\"  \"Or such a lot of joy!\" Polly laughed.  \"Ah, Betty, I thought you were yearning to be useful; think of the honor beads you mean to earn!  But come now and be useful to me; do let us have a swim together.\"  Betty was never proof against her friend's pleading.  \"All right,\" she agreed, searching about near her bed for her sandals while Polly wrapped a light woolen gown about her, \"I don't know whether Miss McMurtry will like our going off by ourselves, but I don't remember her having said we should not, though Camp Fire life does mean doing things together.\"  The two girls had been talking in the lowest possible tones and were now tiptoeing softly out of their tent, when another voice from another bed interrupted them.  \"Betty and Polly, you are sneaks!\" Mollie O'Neill exclaimed indignantly. \"Just because I can't swim as well as you do and Esther can't swim at all, you are going off without us.  You are fine Camp Fire girls; please bring our bathing suits here, too.\"  Both girls nodded and laughed in rather an abashed fashion.  But at a safe distance away Betty turned to Polly.  \"Won't you confess, please, that it is rather a nuisance having Esther Clark in the tent with us?  I don't see why Martha McMurtry insisted upon it when we might have had Meg or most anybody else.\"  Polly looked unusually grave.  \"You don't care for Esther, do you?\" she questioned.  \"It is curious, because though you haven't been particularly nice to her, she is devoted to you and I believe would do anything in the world for you.\"  Ten minutes later the four girls in their Camp Fire bathing suits were in the waters of the lake near their camp, Polly and Betty swimming with long even strokes toward its center, Mollie hovering near the shore, while Esther stood shivering in a foot of water trying vainly to warm herself by splashing and throwing handfuls of water on her chest and face.  Half a mile out Betty turned over on her side.  \"Say the Law of the Camp Fire to yourself, Polly.  I have just said it and I am going back toward shore.  I suppose if one makes a vow to 'give service' it is little enough to show another girl how to swim.  If Esther didn't look so big and wasn't so horribly shy, I am sure I should like her better, but here goes!\"  It wasn't easy work teaching Esther to swim, for she was so much larger than Betty and had such an absurd fashion of keeping both feet down and splashing the water into her own and her teacher's face.  Polly laughed softly to herself as she swam slowly forward to offer her assistance. She was wondering if a single week in camp had really begun to reform her spoiled Betty and if it had, had any change also been wrought in her?  She was to find out in a very few minutes.  One Camp Fire law, that there was no escaping, was that the girls were not to spend but fifteen minutes in bathing.  Really it hardly seemed like half that time before the four girls were once again on land getting into their bathing gowns which had been left hanging on a willow tree nearby.  They were to dress later on in their tent, so they were hardly on shore more than a few moments, but even in that short space of time a noise a few yards away startled them.  The four girls turned indignantly.  In the entire week of their stay in camp they had not been disturbed by a single intruder.  Sunrise Hill, with its tall pines--the emblem of the Camp Fire--its wooded lake for fishing, bathing and canoeing, and its utter seclusion, had seemed, after several weeks of careful search in the neighborhood about Woodford, the ideal place for the girls' summer camp. So far not even a friend, man or woman, had been allowed to visit them, because the camp was to be in running order before they received any outside criticism.  Now a young fellow of perhaps sixteen stood only a short distance off from the lake with an expression of superior amusement on his face.  He was a country boy, for he wore no hat and his hair was burnt to a light straw color at the ends, his skin was almost bronze.  \"Please go away,\" Polly demanded haughtily.  She had gathered her bathing gown about her as though it were a Roman matron's robe and was feeling that her presence must be impressive although her hair was extremely wet and drops of water were trickling down her face.  However, the intruder paid not the least attention to her request, except to laugh as though her indignation gave him special pleasure.  He was carrying a large tin pail on one arm and a basket on the other and of course his behavior was hardly that of a gentleman.  Anger for the moment kept Polly speechless, but a chorus of protests arose from Betty, Mollie and Esther.  \"We are camping here and we would rather not have visitors, so would you mind going back the way you have come?\" Betty requested in her most Princess-like fashion.  \"Not until I have seen the sights,\" the newcomer answered.  He did not really look impertinent, only mischievous, and his eyes were as blue as Polly's.  \"You don't suppose that I have walked a mile before breakfast and carried these heavy things except to find out what on the face of the earth you crazy girls are doing here, trying to pretend you are scouts or Indian squaws.  Of all the foolishness!\"  Perhaps even this short acquaintance with Polly O'Neill has suggested that she had, what is for some reason or other called an Irish temper, though temper does not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8670"],["title","In the Heart of the Rockies: A Story of Adventure in Colorado (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team          IN THE HEART OF THE ROCKIES  A STORY OF ADVENTURE IN COLORADO  BY G. A. HENTY        [Illustration: HUNTING DOG SAVES JERRY FROM THE RAPIDS.]    PREFACE   MY DEAR LADS,  Until comparatively lately that portion of the United States in which I have laid this story was wholly unexplored. The marvellous cañons of the Colorado River extend through a country absolutely bare and waterless, and save the tales told by a few hunters or gold-seekers who, pressed by Indians, made the descent of some of them, but little was known regarding this region. It was not until 1869 that a thorough exploration of the cañons was made by a government expedition under the command of Major Powell. This expedition passed through the whole of the cañons, from those high up on the Green River to the point where the Colorado issues out on to the plains. Four years were occupied by the party in making a detailed survey of the course of the main river and its tributaries. These explorations took place some eight or nine years after the date of my story. The country in which the Big Wind River has its source, and the mountain chains contained in it, were almost unknown until, after the completion of the railway to California, the United States government was forced to send an expedition into it to punish the Indians for their raids upon settlers in the plains. For details of the geography and scenery I have relied upon the narrative of Mr. Baillie-Grohman, who paid several visits to the country in 1878 and the following years in quest of sport, and was the first white man to penetrate the recesses of the higher mountains. At that time the Indians had almost entirely deserted the country. For the details of the dangers and difficulties of the passage through the cañons I am indebted to the official report of Major Powell, published by the United States government.

CHAPTER I  TOM'S CHOICE   \"I can be of no use here, Carry. What am I good for? Why, I could not earn money enough to pay for my own food, even if we knew anyone who would help me to get a clerkship. I am too young for it yet. I would rather go before the mast than take a place in a shop. I am too young even to enlist. I know just about as much as other boys at school, and I certainly have no talent anyway, as far as I can see at present. I can sail a boat, and I won the swimming prize a month ago, and the sergeant who gives us lessons in single-stick and boxing says that he considers me his best pupil with the gloves, but all these things put together would not bring me in sixpence a week. I don't want to go away, and nothing would induce me to do so if I could be of the slightest use to you here. But can I be of any use? What is there for me to look forward to if I stay? I am sure that you would be always worrying over me if I did get some sort of situation that you would know father and mother would not have liked to see me in, and would seem to offer no chance for the future, whereas if I went out there it would not matter what I did, and anything I earned I could send home to you.\"  The speaker was a lad of sixteen. He and his sister, who was two years his senior, were both dressed in deep mourning, and were sitting on a bench near Southsea Castle looking across to Spithead, and the Isle of Wight stretching away behind. They had three days before followed their mother to the grave, and laid her beside their father, a lieutenant of the navy, who had died two years before. This was the first time they had left the house, where remained their four sisters--Janet, who came between Carry and Tom; Blanche, who was fourteen; Lucie, twelve; and Harriet, eight. Tom had proposed the walk.  \"Come out for some fresh air, Carry,\" he had said. \"You have been shut up for a month. Let us two go together;\" and Carry had understood that he wanted a talk alone with her. There was need, indeed, that they should look the future in the face. Since Lieutenant Wade's death their means had been very straitened. Their mother had received a small pension as his widow, and on this, eked out by drafts reluctantly drawn upon the thousand pounds she had brought him on her marriage, which had been left untouched during his lifetime, they had lived since his death. Two hundred pounds had been drawn from their little capital, and the balance was all that now remained. It had long been arranged that Carry and Janet should go out as governesses as soon as they each reached the age of eighteen, but it was now clear that Carry must remain at home in charge of the young ones.  That morning the two girls had had a talk together, and had settled that, as Janet was too young to take even the humblest place as a governess, they would endeavour to open a little school, and so, for the present at any rate, keep the home together. Carry could give music lessons, for she was already an excellent pianist, having been well taught by her mother, who was an accomplished performer, and Janet was sufficiently advanced to teach young girls. She had communicated their decision to Tom, who had heartily agreed with it.  \"The rent is only twenty pounds a year,\" he said, \"and, as you say, the eight hundred pounds bring in thirty-two pounds a year, which will pay the rent and leave something over. If you don't get many pupils at first it will help, and you can draw a little from the capital till the school gets big enough to pay all your expenses. It is horrible to me that I don't seem to be able to help, but at any rate I don't intend to remain a drag upon you. If mother had only allowed me to go to sea after father's death I should be off your hands now, and I might even have been able to help a little. As it is, what is there for me to do here?\" And then he pointed out how hopeless the prospect seemed at Portsmouth.  Carry was silent for a minute or two when he ceased speaking, and sat looking out over the sea.  \"Certainly, we should not wish you to go into a shop, Tom, and what you say about going into an office is also right enough. We have no sort of interest, and the sort of clerkship you would be likely to get here would not lead to anything. I know what you are thinking about--that letter of Uncle Harry's; but you know that mother could not bear the thought of it, and it would be dreadful for us if you were to go away.\"  \"I would not think of going, Carry, if I could see any chance of helping you here, and I don't want to go as I did when the letter first came. It seems such a cowardly thing to run away and leave all the burden upon your shoulders, yours and Janet's, though I know it will be principally on yours; but what else is there to do? It was not for my own sake that I wanted before to go, but I did not see what there was for me to do here even when I grew up. Still, as mother said it would break her heart if I went away, of course there was an end of it for the time, though I have always thought it would be something to fall back upon if, when I got to eighteen or nineteen, nothing else turned up, which seemed to me very likely would be the case. Certainly, if it came to a choice between that and enlisting, I should choose that: and now it seems to me the only thing to be done.\"  \"It is such a long way off, Tom,\" the girl said in a tone of deep pain; \"and you know when people get away so far they seem to forget those at home and give up writing. We had not heard from uncle for ten years when that letter came.\"  \"There would be no fear of my forgetting you, Carry. I would write to you whenever I got a chance.\"  \"But even going out there does not seem to lead to anything, Tom. Uncle has been away twenty-five years, and he does not seem to have made any money at all.\"  \"Oh, but then he owned in his letter, Carry, that it was principally his own fault. He said he had made a good sum several times at mining, and chucked it away; but that next time he strikes a good thing he was determined to keep what he made and to come home to live upon it. I sha'n't chuck it away if I make it, but shall send every penny home that I can spare.\"  \"But uncle will not expect you, Tom, mother refused so positively to let you go. Perhaps he has gone away from the part of the country he wrote from, and you may not be able to find him.\"  \"I shall be able to find him,\" Tom said confidently. \"When that letter went, I sent one of my own to him, and said that though mother would not hear of my going now, I might come out to him when I got older if I could get nothing to do here, and asked him to send me a few words directed to the post-office telling me how I might find him. He wrote back saying that if I called at the Empire Saloon at a small town called Denver, in Colorado, I should be likely to hear whereabouts he was, and that he would sometimes send a line there with instructions if he should be long away.\"  \"I see you have set your mind on going, Tom,\" Carry said sadly.  \"No, I have not set my mind on it, Carry. I am perfectly ready to stop here if you can see any way for me to earn money, but I cannot stop here idle, eating "]]]
