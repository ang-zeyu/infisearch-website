Then he opened the door and bade his two men bring in the things.  So James and Thomas brought them in, box after box and basket after basket, until the Simpsons were well-nigh speechless at the sight.  \"How kin we pay for it, Ma?\" said one of the boys, who was getting old enough to know what lack of funds meant.  \"You're not to pay for it, my boy,\" said Mr. Maynard, \"except by having a jolly, happy day to-morrow, and enjoying all the good things you find in these baskets.\" Then the Maynard children unwrapped some of the pretty things they had made, and gave them to the little Simpsons.  One little girl of about six received a doll with a cry of rapture, and held it close to her, as if she had never had a doll before. Then suddenly she said, \"No, I'll give it to sister, she never had a doll. I did have one once, but a bad boy stole it.\"  \"You're an unselfish little dear,\" cried Marjorie; \"and here's another doll for you. There's one for each of you girls.\"  As there were four girls, this caused four outbursts of joy, and when Marjorie and Kitty saw the way the little girls loved the dollies, they felt more than repaid for the trouble it had been to dress them. The boys, too, were delighted with their gifts. Mr. Maynard had brought real boys' toys for them, such as small tool chests, and mechanical contrivances, not to mention trumpets and drums. And, indeed, the last-named ones needed no mention, for they were at once put to use and spoke for themselves.  \"Land sakes, children! stop that hullabaloo-lam!\" exclaimed Mrs. Simpson. \"How can I thank these kind people if you keep up that noise! Indeed, I can't thank you, anyway,\" she added, as the drums were quiet for a moment. \"It's so kind of you,--and so unexpected. We had almost nothing for,--for to-morrow's dinner, and I didn't know which way to turn.\"  Overcome by her emotion, Mrs. Simpson buried her face in her apron, but as Mrs. Maynard touched her shoulder and spoke to her gently, she looked up, smiling through her tears.  \"I can't rightly thank you, ma'am,\" she went on, \"but the Lord will bless you for your goodness. I'm to see Mr. Simpson for a few moments to-morrow, and when I tell him what you've done for us he'll have the happiest Christmas of us all, though his sufferings is awful. But he was heartsick because of our poor Christmas here at home, and the news will cure him of that, anyway.\"  \"I put in some jelly and grapes especially for him,\" said Mrs. Maynard, smiling, though there were tears in her own eyes. \"So you take them to him, and give him Christmas greetings from us. And now we must go, and you can begin at once to make ready your feast.\"  \"Oh, yes, ma'am. And may all Christmas blessing's light on you and yours.\"  \"Merry Christmas!\" cried all the Maynards as they trooped out, and the good wish was echoed by the happy Simpsons.  \"My!\" said King, \"it makes a fellow feel sober to see people as poor as that!\"  \"It does, my boy,\" said his father; \"and it's a pleasure to help those who are truly worthy and deserving. Simpson is an honest, hard-working man, and I think we must keep an eye on the family until he's about again. And now, my hearties, we've done all we can for them for the present; so let's turn our attention to the celebration of the Maynard's Christmastide. Who wants to go to the station with me to meet Grandma and Uncle Steve?\"  \"I!\" declared the four children, as with one voice.  \"Yes, but you can't all go; and, too, there must be some of the nicest ones at home to greet the travellers as they enter. I think I'll decide the question myself. I'll take Kitty and King with me, and I'll leave my eldest and youngest daughters at home with Motherdy to receive the guests when they come.\"  Mr. Maynard's word was always law, and though Marjorie wanted to go, she thought, too, it would be fun to be at home and receive them when they come.  So they all separated as agreed, and Mrs. Maynard said they must make haste to get dressed for the company.  Marjorie wore a light green cashmere, with a white embroidered _guimpe_, which was one of her favorite frocks. Her hair was tied with big white bows, and a sprig of holly was tucked in at one side.  She flew down to the living-room, to find baby Rosamond and her mother already there. Rosy Posy was a Christmas baby indeed, all in white, with holly ribbons tying up her curls, and a holly sprig tied in the bow. The whole house was decorated with ropes and loops of evergreen, and stars and wreaths, with big red bows on them, were in the windows and over the doorways.  The delicious fragrance of the evergreens pervaded the house, and the wood fires burned cheerily. Mrs. Maynard, in her pretty rose-colored house gown, looked about with the satisfied feeling that everything was in readiness, and nothing had been forgotten.  At last a commotion was heard at the door, and Marjorie flew to open it. They all seemed to come in at once, and after an embrace from Grandma, Marjorie felt herself lifted up in Uncle Steve's strong arms.  \"That's the last time, Midget,\" he said as he set her down again. \"There's too much of you for me to toss about as I used to. My! what a big girl you are!\"  \"Toss me, Uncle Teve,\" said Rosy Posy, and she was immediately swung to Uncle Steve's shoulder.  \"You're only a bit of thistle-down. I could toss you up in the sky, and you could sit on the edge of a star. How would you like that?\"  \"I'd ravver stay here,\" said Rosy Posy, nestling contentedly on her perch. \"'Sides, I _must_ be here for Kismus to-morrow.\"  \"Oh, _is_ Christmas to-morrow? How could I have forgotten that?\"  \"You didn't forget it, Uncle Steve,\" said Kitty, \"for I see bundles sticking out of every one of your pockets!\"  \"Bless my soul! How odd! Santa Claus must have tucked them in, as I came through his street. Well, I'll put them away until to-morrow. They're of no use to-night.\"  \"Put them in here, Steve,\" said Mrs. Maynard, opening a cupboard door, for there was a possibility that the good-natured gentleman might be persuaded to unwrap them at once.  Meantime Grandma was reviewing the small Maynards. Marjorie she had seen in the summer, but the others had been absent a longer time.  \"You've all grown,\" she said, \"but I do believe I like you just as well bigger.\"  \"Good for you, Grandma!\" cried King. \"'Most everybody says, 'Why, how you've grown!' as if we had done something wrong.\"  \"No, the more there is of my grandchildren, the more I have to love, so go right on growing. Marjorie, Molly and Stella sent love to you, and they also sent some little gifts which I will give you to-morrow.\"  The Maynards did not follow the custom of having their tree on Christmas eve.  Mrs. Maynard thought it unwise, because the children often became so excited over their gifts and their frolic that it was difficult for them to settle down to sleep until \"all hours.\"  So it was the rule to go to bed rather early on Christmas eve, and have a long happy day to follow.  But the dinner, on the night before Christmas, always assumed a little of the coming festivities. On this occasion, the table was decked with holly and flowers, and the dishes were a little more elaborate and festive than usual.  \"Ice cream, oh, goody!\" exclaimed Kitty, as dessert appeared. Kitty's fondness for ice cream was a family joke, but all welcomed the little Santa Clauses made of orange ice, and carrying trees of pistache cream. After dinner a game of romps was allowed.  Mrs. Maynard, Grandma and Baby Rosy did not join in this, but went off by themselves, leaving the living-room to the more enthusiastic rompers.  \"Fox and Geese\" was a favorite game, and though there were scarcely enough of them to play it properly, yet that made it all the more fun, and Uncle Steve and Mr. Maynard seemed to be little, if any, older than Kingdon, as they scrambled about in the frolic. Then Kitty begged for just one round of Puss in the Corner.  Kingdon and Midget thought this rather a baby game, but they willingly deferred to Kitty's choice, and the grown up men were such foolish, funny pussies in their corners that everybody fell a-laughing, and the game broke up because they were too exhausted to play any more.  \"Now to quiet down pleasantly, and then ho, for bed,\" said Mr. Maynard. So when they had recovered their breath, Mrs. Maynard and Grandma returned, Rosy Posy having already gone to her little crib. Mrs. Maynard sat at the piano, and they all gathered round and sang Christmas carols.  The children had clear, true voices, and the grown-ups sang really well, so it was sweet Christmas music that they made. They sang many of the old English carols, for the children had sung them every Christmas eve since they were old enough, and they knew them well.  Grandma loved to hear the music, and after it was over the three children were kindly but firmly requested to retire.  \"We hate awfully to have you go, dear friends,\" said Mr. Maynard. \"We shall be desolate, indeed, without your merry faces, but the time is ripe. It's nine o'clock, and Christmas morning comes apace. So flee, skip, skiddoo, vamoose, and exit! Hang up your stockings, and _perhaps_ Santa Claus may observe them. But hasten, for I daresay he's already on his rounds.\"  Laughing at their father's nonsense, the children rather reluctantly backed out of the room and dawdled upstairs.  But there was still the fun of hanging up their stockings, and then, after that nothing more but to hurry to get to sleep that Christmas might come sooner.  Rosy Posy's tiny socks were already in place, and soon three more pairs of long, lank stockings were dangling emptily, and then, in a jiffy the Maynard children were all asleep, and Christmas Day was silently drawing nearer and nearer.     CHAPTER III  MERRY"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8887"],["title","Marjorie's New Friend (#3)"],["body","AS!   The sun waited just about as long as he could stand it on Christmas morning, and then he poked his yellow nose above the horizon to see what was going on. And everything that he saw was so merry and gay and full of Christmas spirit, that he pushed the rest of himself up, and beamed around in a glad smile of welcome and greeting. As he gave a flashing glance in at the Maynard girls' window, his rays struck Marjorie full in the face and wakened her at once. For a moment she blinked and winked and wondered what day it was. Then she remembered, and with one bound she was out of bed, and across the room to where Kitty was soundly sleeping.  It was a rule for the Maynard children never to waken one another, for Mrs. Maynard believed that people, both young and old, need all the sleep they can take, but Christmas morning was, of course, an exception, and patting Kitty rather vigorously on her shoulder, Marjorie called out, \"Merry Christmas!\"  \"Who?\" said Kitty, drowsily, rubbing her eyes, as she sat up. \"Oh, Mops! you caught me! Merry Christmas, yourself! Let's go and catch King!\"  Throwing on their dressing-gowns, and tucking their feet into bedroom slippers, they ran to their brother's room, but King, also huddled into a bath-robe, met them in the hall, and the gay greetings and laughter soon woke any one else in the house who might have been asleep. Nurse Nannie, with Rosy Posy, joined the group, and each clasping a pair of bulging, knobby stockings, flew to the nursery, where this Christmas morning ceremonial always took place.  A bright fire was blazing in the big fireplace, and in front of it, on a white fur rug, the four sat down, while Nannie hovered around, ready to inspect and admire, as she knew she would be called upon to do.  The big, light nursery was a delightful room, and with the morning sunshine, the shining yellow floor, white-painted woodwork, and bright fire-brasses, it seemed full of Christmas glow and warmth.  Grouped on the rug, the children immediately proceeded to the business of emptying their stockings, and as the various things were pulled out and exhibited, everybody oh'd and ah'd at everybody else, and they all began to nibble at candies, and at last Christmas had really begun.  The gifts in their stockings were always of a pretty, but trifling nature, as their more worth while presents were received later, from the tree.  But there were always lots of little toys and trinkets, and always oranges and nuts and candies, and always tin whistles and rattles, and other noise-producing contraptions, so that soon the four grew gay and noisy and Nurse was obliged to pick up Baby Rosamond, lest she should be inadvertently upset.  But perched in Nurse's lap, the little one waved a Christmas flag, and blew on a tiny tin trumpet, and quite made her share of the general hullaballoo. Marjorie had a new pencil-case, and some pretty handkerchiefs, and an inkstand, and a silver bangle, and a little diary, and some lovely hair-ribbons.  And King was rejoicing over a fountain pen, a pocket-knife, a silk muffler, a rubber-stamp outfit, and some new gloves.  Kitty had a little pocket-book, a silver shoe-buttoner, a blank-book, a pretty silk pincushion, and a bangle like Marjorie's.  Baby Rosy had dolls and toys, and what with the candies and other goodies, there was a distracting array of Christmas all about.  \"And to think the day has scarcely begun!\" said Marjorie, with a sigh of rapture, as she ate a cream date, at the same time twisting her wrist to catch the glitter of her new bangle.  \"Yes, but it's 'most half-past eight,\" said King, \"and breakfast's at nine. I'm going to skittle!\"  He gathered up his new belongings, and with a sort of combination war-whoop and \"Merry Christmas,\" he scampered away to his room. The two girls followed his example, and soon were busily dressing themselves and helping each other.  Marjorie put on a scarlet cashmere, which, with the big red bows on her hair, made her look very Christmassy, the effect being added to by holly sprigs pinned on here and there. Kitty's frock was a sort of electric blue, that suited her fair hair, and she, too, was holly-decked.  Then, after a hasty inspection of each other, to see that they were all right, the girls skipped downstairs.  So expeditious had they been that not a Maynard was ahead of them, except their father, who had just come down.  \"Merry Christmas, girlies!\" he cried, and just then everybody came down, almost all at once, and the greetings flew about, as thick as a snowstorm. Grandma Sherwood, in her soft grey breakfast-gown, beamed happily at her brood of grandchildren, and soon they all gathered round the table.  \"I wish Christmas was seventy-two hours long, said Marjorie, whose candies had not taken away her appetite for the specially fine breakfast that was being served in honor of the day.  \"But you'd fall asleep after twelve hours of it,\" said Uncle Steve; \"so what good would it do you?\"  \"I wouldn't!\" declared King. \"I could spend twelve hours having our regular Christmas in the house; and then twelve more outdoors, skating or something; and then twelve more--\"  \"Eating,\" suggested his father, glancing at King's plate. \"Well, since we can't have seventy-two hours of it, we must cram all the fun we can into twelve. Who's for a run out of doors before we have our Christmas tree?\" The three older children agreed to this, and with Mr. Maynard and Uncle Steve they went out for a brisk walk.  \"Wish we could snowball,\" said King, as they returned, and stood for a few moments on the verandah. \"It's cold enough, but there no sign of snow.\"  \"Pooh, you don't have to have snow to play a game of snowballs!\" said his father. \"Why didn't you say what you wanted sooner? You are such a diffident boy! Wait a minute.\"  Mr. Maynard disappeared into the house, and returned with a large paper bag filled with something, they did not know what.  \"Come out on the lawn,\" he said, and soon they were all out on the brown, dry, winter grass.  \"Catch!\" and then Mr. Maynard threw to one and another, some swift, white balls. They were really white pop-corn balls, but at first they looked like snowballs.  The children caught on at once, and soon two or three dozen balls were whizzing from each to each, and they had the jolliest game! The balls were too light to hurt if they hit them, yet solid enough to throw well.  To be sure, they broke to bits after many tosses, but the game lasted a half hour, and then Mr. Maynard declared that it was tree time.  \"Sounds like tea-time,\" said Kitty, as they trooped in.  \"Sounds a whole lot better than that!\" said King.  The tree was in the living-room. It had been brought in, and trimmed after the children went to bed the night before. So they had had no glimpse of it, and were now more than eager to see its glories.  \"Are we all here?\" asked Mr. Maynard, as he looked over the group in the hall, awaiting the opening of the doors.  \"All but Uncle Steve,\" said Marjorie. \"Why doesn't he come?\"  \"We won't wait for him,\" said Mr. Maynard, and he gave a loud knock on the double doors of the living-room.  Like magic the doors flew open, and waiting to receive them was Santa Claus himself!  His jolly, smiling face was very red-cheeked, and his white hair and beard streamed down over his red coat, which was of that belted round-about shape that seems to be Santa Claus's favorite fashion.  His red coat and trousers were trimmed with white fur and gold braid, and his high boots were covered with splashes of white that _looked_ like snow. He wore a fur trimmed red cap, and big gold-rimmed spectacles. The latter, with the very red cheeks and long white beard, so changed Uncle Steve's appearance that at first no one seemed to recognize him.  But they knew in a moment, and Marjorie grasped one hand and Kitty the other, as they cried out:  \"Hello, Uncle Santa Claus! how did you get so snowy?\"  \"I came down from the arctic regions, my dears,\" said the smiling saint, \"and up there we have perpetual snow.\"  \"It seems to be perpetual on your boots,\" observed King; \"I'm sure it won't melt off at all!\"  \"Yes, it's first-class snow,\" agreed Santa Claus, looking at his boots, which were really splashed with white-wash. \"And here's little Miss Rosy Posy,\" he continued, picking up the baby, who, at first, was a little shy of the strange-looking figure. \"This is the very little girl I've come to see, and she must pick something off the tree!\"  Rosy Posy recognized Uncle Steve's voice now, and contentedly nestled in his arms as he carried her to the tree. And such a tree as it was!  It reached to the ceiling, and its top boughs had been cut off to get it in the room at all.  The blinds had been closed, and the shades drawn, in order that the illuminations of the tree might shine out brightly, and the gorgeous sight quite took the children's breath away.  The big tree was in the end of the room, and not only did sparkling tinsel rope deck the green branches, but its strands also reached out to the wall on either side, so that the tree seemed to be caught in an immense silver spider-web. Sparkling ornaments decked every limb and twig, and shining among them were hundreds of tiny electric lights of different colors.  Many beautiful presents hung on the tree, without wrappings of any sort to hide their pretty effect, and many more gifts, tied in be-ribboned papers, lay on the floor beneath.  Altogether, it looked as if the whole end of the room were a sort of glittering fairyland, and the children promptly agreed it was the most beautiful tree they had ever had.  As Santa Claus held Baby Rosamond up to select for herself a gift from the tree, he held her so that she faced a big doll, almost as large as herself.  \"Oh, that will be my dollie!\" she announced, holding out her little arms.  The big doll was detached from its perch and handed to the child, who ran to nurse with her treasure, and would not be parted from it all day long.  Then"]]]
