In the little volume here offered to the public, he has worked up half a dozen of them, with this end in view.  A great freedom of treatment was necessary to his plan; but it will be observed by every one who attempts to render these legends malleable in his intellectual furnace, that they are marvellously independent of all temporary modes and circumstances. They remain essentially the same, after changes that would affect the identity of almost anything else.  He does not, therefore, plead guilty to a sacrilege, in having sometimes shaped anew, as his fancy dictated, the forms that have been hallowed by an antiquity of two or three thousand years.  No epoch of time can claim a copyright in these immortal fables.  They seem never to have been made; and certainly, so long as man exists, they can never perish; but, by their indestructibility itself, they are legitimate subjects for every age to clothe with its own garniture of manners and sentiment, and to imbue with its own morality.  In the present version they may have lost much of their classical aspect (or, at all events, the author has not been careful to preserve it), and have, perhaps, assumed a Gothic or romantic guise.  In performing this pleasant task,--for it has been really a task fit for hot weather, and one of the most agreeable, of a literary kind, which he ever undertook,--the author has not always thought it necessary to write downward, in order to meet the comprehension of children.  He has generally suffered the theme to soar, whenever such was its tendency, and when he himself was buoyant enough to follow without an effort. Children possess an unestimated sensibility to whatever is deep or high, in imagination or feeling, so long as it is simple, likewise.  It is only the artificial and the complex that bewilder them.  Lenox, July 15, 1851.     THE GORGON’S HEAD  TANGLEWOOD PORCH  INTRODUCTORY TO “THE GORGON’S HEAD.”  Beneath the porch of the country-seat called Tanglewood, one fine autumnal morning, was assembled a merry party of little folks, with a tall youth in the midst of them.  They had planned a nutting expedition, and were impatiently waiting for the mists to roll up the hill-slopes, and for the sun to pour the warmth of the Indian summer over the fields and pastures, and into the nooks of the many-colored woods.  There was a prospect of as fine a day as ever gladdened the aspect of this beautiful and comfortable world.  As yet, however, the morning mist filled up the whole length and breadth of the valley, above which, on a gently sloping eminence, the mansion stood.  This body of white vapor extended to within less than a hundred yards of the house.  It completely hid everything beyond that distance, except a few ruddy or yellow tree-tops, which here and there emerged, and were glorified by the early sunshine, as was likewise the broad surface of the mist.  Four or five miles off to the southward rose the summit of Monument Mountain, and seemed to be floating on a cloud.  Some fifteen miles farther away, in the same direction, appeared the loftier Dome of Taconic, looking blue and indistinct, and hardly so substantial as the vapory sea that almost rolled over it.  The nearer hills, which bordered the valley, were half submerged, and were specked with little cloud-wreaths all the way to their tops.  On the whole, there was so much cloud, and so little solid earth, that it had the effect of a vision.  The children above-mentioned, being as full of life as they could hold, kept overflowing from the porch of Tanglewood, and scampering along the gravel-walk, or rushing across the dewy herbage of the lawn.  I can hardly tell how many of these small people there were; not less than nine or ten, however, nor more than a dozen, of all sorts, sizes, and ages, whether girls or boys.  They were brothers, sisters, and cousins, together with a few of their young acquaintances, who had been invited by Mr. and Mrs. Pringle to spend some of this delightful weather with their own children, at Tanglewood.  I am afraid to tell you their names, or even to give them any names which other children have ever been called by; because, to my certain knowledge, authors sometimes get themselves into great trouble by accidentally giving the names of real persons to the characters in their books.  For this reason, I mean to call them Primrose, Periwinkle, Sweet Fern, Dandelion, Blue Eye, Clover, Huckleberry, Cowslip, Squash-blossom, Milkweed, Plantain, and Buttercup; although, to be sure, such titles might better suit a group of fairies than a company of earthly children.  It is not to be supposed that these little folks were to be permitted by their careful fathers and mothers, uncles, aunts, or grandparents, to stray abroad into the woods and fields, without the guardianship of some particularly grave and elderly person.  O no, indeed!  In the first sentence of my book, you will recollect that I spoke of a tall youth, standing in the midst of the children.  His name--(and I shall let you know his real name, because he considers it a great honor to have told the stories that are here to be printed)--his name was Eustace Bright. He was a student at Williams College, and had reached, I think, at this period, the venerable age of eighteen--years; so that he felt quite like a grandfather towards Periwinkle, Dandelion, Huckleberry, Squash-blossom, Milkweed, and the rest, who were only half or a third as venerable as he.  A trouble in his eyesight (such as many students think it necessary to have, nowadays, in order to prove their diligence at their books) had kept him from college a week or two after the beginning of the term.  But, for my part, I have seldom met with a pair of eyes that looked as if they could see farther or better than those of Eustace Bright.  This learned student was slender, and rather pale, as all Yankee students are; but yet of a healthy aspect, and as light and active as if he had wings to his shoes.  By the by, being much addicted to wading through streamlets and across meadows, he had put on cowhide boots for the expedition.  He wore a linen blouse, a cloth cap, and a pair of green spectacles, which he had assumed, probably, less for the preservation of his eyes, than for the dignity that they imparted to his countenance.  In either case, however, he might as well have let then alone; for Huckleberry, a mischievous little elf, crept behind Eustace as he sat on the steps of the porch, snatched the spectacles from his nose, and clapped them on her own; and as the student forgot to take them back, they fell off into the grass, and lay there till the next spring.  Now, Eustace Bright, you must know, had won great fame among the children, as a narrator of wonderful stories; and though he sometimes pretended to be annoyed, when they teased him for more, and more, and always for more, yet I really doubt whether he liked anything quite so well as to tell them.  You might have seen his eyes twinkle, therefore, when Clover, Sweet Fern, Cowslip, Buttercup, and most of their playmates, besought him to relate one of his stories, while they were waiting for the mist to clear up.  “Yes, Cousin Eustace,” said Primrose, who was a bright girl of twelve, with laughing eyes, and a nose that turned up a little, “the morning is certainly the best time for the stories with which you so often tire out our patience.  We shall be in less danger of hurting your feelings, by falling asleep at the most interesting points,--as little Cowslip and I did last night!”  “Naughty Primrose,” cried Cowslip, a child of six years old; “I did not fall asleep, and I only shut my eyes, so as to see a picture of what Cousin Eustace was telling about.  His stories are good to hear at night, because we can dream about them asleep; and good in the morning, too, because then we can dream about them awake.  So I hope he will tell us one this very minute.”  “Thank you, my little Cowslip,” said Eustace; “certainly you shall have the best story I can think of, if it were only for defending me so well from that naughty Primrose.  But, children, I have already told you so many fairy tales, that I doubt whether there is a single one which you have not heard at least twice over.  I am afraid you will fall asleep in reality, if I repeat any of them again.”  “No, no, no!” cried Blue Eye, Periwinkle, Plantain, and half a dozen others.  “We like a story all the better for having heard it two or three tunes before.”  And it is a truth, as regards children, that a story seems often to deepen its mark in their interest, not merely by two or three, but by numberless repetitions.  But Eustace Bright, in the exuberance of his resources, scorned to avail himself of an advantage which an older story-teller would have been glad to grasp at.  “It would be a great pity,” said he, “if a man of my learning (to say nothing of original fancy) could not find a new story every day, year in and year out, for children such as you.  I will tell you one of the nursery tales that were made for the amusement of our great old grandmother, the Earth, when she was a child in frock and pinafore. There are a hundred such; and it is a wonder to me that they have not long ago been put into picture-books for little girls and boys.  But, instead of that, old gray-bearded grandsires pore over them, in musty volumes of Greek, and puzzle themselves with trying to find out when, and how, and for what they were made.”  “Well, well, well, well, Cousin Eustace!” cried all the children at once; “talk no more about your stories, but begin.”  “Sit"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9255"],["title","The Gorgon's Head (#1)"],["body","wn, then, every soul of you,” said Eustace Bright, “and be all as still as so many mice.  At the slightest interruption, whether from great, naughty Primrose, little Dandelion, or any other, I shall bite the story short off between my teeth, and swallow the untold part.  But, in the first place, do any of you know what a Gorgon is?”  “I do,” said Primrose.  “Then hold your tongue!” rejoined Eustace, who had rather she would have known nothing about the matter.  “Hold all your tongues, and I shall tell you a sweet pretty story of a Gorgon’s head.”  And so he did, as you may begin to read on the next page.  Working up his sophomorical erudition with a good deal of tact, and incurring great obligations to Professor Anthon, he, nevertheless, disregarded all classical authorities, whenever the vagrant audacity of his imagination impelled him to do so.    THE GORGON’S HEAD.  Perseus was the son of Danae, who was the daughter of a king.  And when Perseus was a very little boy, some wicked people put his mother and himself into a chest, and set them afloat upon the sea.  The wind blew freshly, and drove the chest away from the shore, and the uneasy billows tossed it up and down; while Danae clasped her child closely to her bosom, and dreaded that some big wave would dash its foamy crest over them both.  The chest sailed on, however, and neither sank nor was upset; until, when night was coming, it floated so near an island that it got entangled in a fisherman’s nets, and was drawn out high and dry upon the sand.  The island was called Seriphus, and it was reigned over by King Polydectes, who happened to be the fisherman’s brother.  This fisherman, I am glad to tell you, was an exceedingly humane and upright man.  He showed great kindness to Danae and her little boy; and continued to befriend them, until Perseus had grown to be a handsome youth, very strong and active, and skilful in the use of arms.  Long before this time, King Polydectes had seen the two strangers--the mother and her child--who had come to his dominions in a floating chest.  As he was not good and kind, like his brother the fisherman, but extremely wicked, he resolved to send Perseus on a dangerous enterprise, in which he would probably be killed, and then to do some great mischief to Danae herself.  So this bad-hearted king spent a long while in considering what was the most dangerous thing that a young man could possibly undertake to perform.  At last, having hit upon an enterprise that promised to turn out as fatally as he desired, he sent for the youthful Perseus.  The young man came to the palace, and found the king sitting upon his throne.  “Perseus,” said King Polydectes, smiling craftily upon him, “you are grown up a fine young man.  You and your good mother have received a great deal of kindness from myself, as well as from my worthy brother the fisherman, and I suppose you would not be sorry to repay some of it.”  “Please your Majesty,” answered Perseus, “I would willingly risk my life to do so.”  “Well, then,” continued the king, still with a curving smile on his lips, “I have a little adventure to propose to you; and, as you are a brave and enterprising youth, you will doubtless look upon it as a great piece of good luck to have so rare an opportunity of distinguishing yourself.  You must know, my good Perseus, I think of getting married to the beautiful Princess Hippodamia; and it is customary, on these occasions, to make the bride a present of some far-fetched and elegant curiosity.  I have been a little perplexed, I must honestly confess, where to obtain anything likely to please a princess of her exquisite taste.  But, this morning, I flatter myself, I have thought of precisely the article.”  “And can I assist your Majesty in obtaining it?” cried Perseus, eagerly.  “You can, if you are as brave a youth as I believe you to be,” replied King Polydectes, with the utmost graciousness of manner.  “The bridal gift which I have set my heart on presenting to the beautiful Hippodamia is the head of the Gorgon Medusa, with the snaky locks; and I depend on you, my dear Perseus, to bring it to me.  So, as I am anxious to settle affairs with the princess, the sooner you go in quest of the Gorgon, the better I shall be pleased.”  “I will set out to-morrow morning,” answered Perseus.  “Pray do so, my gallant youth,” rejoined the king.  “And, Perseus, in cutting off the Gorgon’s head, be careful to make a clean stroke, so as not to injure its appearance.  You must bring it home in the very best condition, in order to suit the exquisite taste of the beautiful Princess Hippodamia.”  Perseus left the palace, but was scarcely out of hearing before Polydectes burst into a laugh; being greatly amused, wicked king that he was, to find how readily the young man fell into the snare.  The news quickly spread abroad, that Perseus had undertaken to cut off the head of Medusa with the snaky locks.  Everybody was rejoiced; for most of the inhabitants of the island were as wicked as the king himself, and would have liked nothing better than to see some enormous mischief happen to Danae and her son.  The only good man in this unfortunate island of Seriphus appears to have been the fisherman.  As Perseus walked along, therefore, the people pointed after him, and made mouths, and winked to one another, and ridiculed him as loudly as they dared.  “Ho, ho!” cried they; “Medusa’s snakes will sting him soundly!”  Now, there were three Gorgons alive, at that period; and they were the most strange and terrible monsters that had ever been since the world was made, or that have been seen in after days, or that are likely to be seen in all time to come.  I hardly know what sort of creature or hobgoblin to call them.  They were three sisters, and seem to have borne some distant resemblance to women, but were really a very frightful and mischievous species of dragon.  It is, indeed, difficult to imagine what hideous beings these three sisters were.  Why, instead of locks of hair, if you can believe me, they had each of them a hundred enormous snakes growing on their heads, all alive, twisting, wriggling, curling, and thrusting out their venomous’ tongues, with forked stings at the end! The teeth of the Gorgons were terribly long tusks; their hands were made of brass; and their bodies were all over scales, which, if not iron, were something as hard and impenetrable.  They had wings, too, and exceedingly splendid ones, I can assure you; for every feather in them was pure, bright, glittering, burnished gold, and they looked very dazzlingly, no doubt, when the Gorgons were flying about in the sunshine.  But when people happened to catch a glimpse of their glittering brightness, aloft in the air, they seldom stopped to gaze, but ran and hid themselves as speedily as they could.  You will think, perhaps, that they were afraid of being stung by the serpents that served the Gorgons instead of hair,--or of having their heads bitten off by their ugly tusks,--or of being torn all to pieces by their brazen claws.  Well, to be sure, these were some of the dangers, but by no means the greatest, nor the most difficult to avoid.  For the worst thing about these abominable Gorgons was, that, if once a poor mortal fixed his eyes full upon one of their faces, he was certain, that very instant, to be changed from warm flesh and blood into cold and lifeless stone!  Thus, as you will easily perceive, it was a very dangerous adventure that the wicked King Polydectes had contrived for this innocent young man.  Perseus himself, when he had thought over the matter, could not help seeing that he had very little chance of coming safely through it, and that he was far more likely to become a stone image than to bring back the head of Medusa with the snaky locks.  For, not to speak of other difficulties, there was one which it would have puzzled an older man than Perseus to get over.  Not only must he fight with and slay this golden-winged, iron-scaled, long-tusked, brazen-clawed, snaky-haired monster, but he must do it with his eyes shut, or, at least, without so much as a glance at the enemy with whom he was contending.  Else, while his arm was lifted to strike, he would stiffen into stone, and stand with that uplifted arm for centuries, until time, and the wind and weather, should crumble him quite away.  This would be a very sad thing to befall a young mail who wanted to perform a great many brave deeds, and to enjoy a great deal of happiness, in this bright and beautiful world.  So disconsolate did these thoughts make him, that Perseus could not bear to tell his another what he had undertaken to do.  He therefore took his shield, girded on his sword, and crossed over from the island to the mainland, where he sat down in a solitary place, and hardly refrained from shedding tears.  But, while he was in this sorrowful mood, he heard a voice close beside him.  “Perseus,” said the voice, “why are you sad?”  He lifted his head from his hands, in which he had hidden it, and, behold! all alone as Perseus had supposed himself to be, there was a stranger in the solitary place.  It was a brisk, intelligent, and remarkably shrewd-looking young man, with a cloak over his shoulders, an odd sort of cap on his head, a strangely twisted staff in his hand, and a short and very crooked sword hanging by his side.  He was exceedingly light and active in his figure, like a person much accustomed to gymnastic exercises, and well able to leap or run.  Above all, the stranger had such a cheerful, knowing, and helpful aspect (though it was certainly a little mischievous, into the bargain), that Perseus could not help feeling his spirits grow livelier, as he gazed at him.  Besides, being really a courageous youth, he felt greatly ashamed that anybody should have found him with tears in his eyes, like a timid little school-boy, when, after all, there might be no occasion for despair.  So Perseus wiped his eyes, and answered the"]]]
