I recollect no happier portion of my life, than this, my calm old age. It is like the sunny and sheltered slope of a valley, where, late in the autumn, the grass is greener than in August, and intermixed with golden dandelions, that have not been seen till now, since the first warmth of the year.  But with me, the verdure and the flowers are not frostbitten in the midst of winter.  A playfulness has revisited my mind; a sympathy with the young and gay; an unpainful interest in the business of others; a light and wandering curiosity; arising, perhaps, from the sense that my toil on earth is ended, and the brief hour till bedtime may be spent in play.  Still, I have fancied that there is a depth of feeling and reflection, under this superficial levity, peculiar to one who has lived long, and is soon to die.  Show me anything that would make an infant smile, and you shall behold a gleam of mirth over the hoary ruin of my visage.  I can spend a pleasant hour in the sun, watching the sports of the village children, on the edge of the surf; now they chase the retreating wave far down over the wet sand; now it steals softly up to kiss their naked feet; now it comes onward with threatening front, and roars after the laughing crew, as they scamper beyond its reach.  Why should not an old man be merry too, when the great sea is at play with those little children?  I delight, also, to follow in the wake of a pleasure-party of young men and girls, strolling along the beach after an early supper at the Point.  Here, with hand kerchiefs at nose, they bend over a heap of eel-grass, entangled in which is a dead skate, so oddly accoutred with two legs and a long tail, that they mistake him for a drowned animal.  A few steps farther, the ladies scream, and the gentlemen make ready to protect them against a young shark of the dogfish kind, rolling with a life-like motion in the tide that has thrown him up.  Next, they are smit with wonder at the black shells of a wagon-load of live lobsters, packed in rock-weed for the country market.  And when they reach the fleet of dories, just hauled ashore after the day's fishing, how do I laugh in my sleeve, and sometimes roar outright, at the simplicity of these young folks and the sly humor of the fishermen!  In winter, when our village is thrown into a bustle by the arrival of perhaps a score of country dealers, bargaining for frozen fish, to be transported hundreds of miles, and eaten fresh in Vermont or Canada, I am a pleased but idle spectator in the throng.  For I launch my boat no more.  When the shore was solitary, I have found a pleasure that seemed even to exalt my mind, in observing the sports or contentions of two gulls, as they wheeled and hovered about each other, with hoarse screams, one moment flapping on the foam of the wave, and then soaring aloft, till their white bosoms melted into the upper sunshine.  In the calm of the summer sunset, I drag my aged limbs, with a little ostentation of activity, because I am so old, up to the rocky brow of the hill. There I see the white sails of many a vessel, outward bound or homeward from afar, and the black trail of a vapor behind the eastern steamboat; there, too, is the sun, going down, but not in gloom, and there the illimitable ocean mingling with the sky, to remind me of eternity.  But sweetest of all is the hour of cheerful musing and pleasant talk, that comes between the dusk and the lighted candle, by my glowing fireside.  And never, even on the first Thanksgiving night, when Susan and I sat alone with our hopes, nor the second, when a stranger had been sent to gladden us, and be the visible image of our affection, did I feel such joy as now.  All that belong to me are here; Death has taken none, nor Disease kept them away, nor Strife divided them from their parents or each other; with neither poverty nor riches to disturb them, nor the misery of desires beyond their lot, they have kept New England's festival round the patriarch's board.  For I am a patriarch! Here I sit among my descendants, in my old arm-chair and immemorial corner, while the firelight throws an appropriate glory round my venerable frame.  Susan!  My children!  Something whispers me, that this happiest hour must be the final one, and that nothing remains but to bless you all, and depart with a treasure of recollected joys to heaven.  Will you meet me there? Alas!  your figures grow indistinct, fading into pictures on the air, and now to fainter outlines, while the fire is glimmering on the walls of a familiar room, and shows the book that I flung down, and the sheet that I left half written, some fifty years ago.  I lift my eyes to the looking-glass, and perceive myself alone, unless those be the mermaid's features, retiring into the depths of the mirror, with a tender and melancholy smile.  All! one feels a chillness, not bodily, but about the heart, and, moreover, a foolish dread of looking behind him, after these pastimes. I can imagine precisely how a magician would sit down in gloom and terror, after dismissing the shadows that had personated dead or distant people, and stripping his cavern of the unreal splendor which had changed it to a palace.  And now for a moral to my revery.  Shall it be, that, since fancy can create so bright a dream of happiness, it were better to dream on from youth to age, than to awake and strive doubtfully for something real!  O, the slight tissue of a dream can no more preserve us from the stern reality of misfortune, than a robe of cobweb could repel the wintry blast.  Be this the moral, then. In chaste and warm affections, humble wishes, and honest toil for some useful end, there is health for the mind, and quiet for the heart, the prospect of a happy life, and the fairest hope of heaven."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9211"],["title","The Sister Years (From \"Twice Told Tales\") (#0)"],["body","TOLD TALES                          THE SISTER YEARS                       By Nathaniel Hawthorne    Last night, between eleven and twelve o’clock, when the Old Year was leaving her final foot prints on the borders of Time’s empire, she found herself in possession of a few spare moments, and sat down--of all places in the world--on the steps of our new City Hall.  The wintry moonlight showed that she looked weary of body, and sad of heart, like many another wayfarer of earth.  Her garments, having been exposed to much foul weather, and rough usage, were in very ill condition; and as the hurry of her journey had never before allowed her to take an instant’s rest, her shoes were so worn as to be scarcely worth the mending.  But, after trudging only a little distance farther, this poor Old Year was destined to enjoy a long, long sleep.  I forgot to mention, that when she seated herself on the steps, she deposited by her side a very capacious bandbox, in which, as is the custom among travellers of her sex, she carried a great deal of valuable property.  Besides this luggage, there was a folio book under her arm, very much resembling the annual volume of a newspaper. Placing this volume across her knees, and resting her elbows upon it, with her forehead in her hands, the weary, bedraggled, world-worn Old Year heaved a heavy sigh, and appeared to be taking no very pleasant retrospect of her past existence.  While she thus awaited the midnight knell, that was to summon her to the innumerable sisterhood of departed Years, there came a young maiden treading lightsomely on tiptoe along the street, from the direction of the Railroad Depot.  She was evidently a stranger, and perhaps had come to town by the evening train of cars.  There was a smiling cheerfulness in this fair maiden’s face, which bespoke her fully confident of a kind reception from the multitude of people, with whom she was soon to form acquaintance.  Her dress was rather too airy for the season, and was bedizened with fluttering ribbons and other vanities, which were likely soon to be rent away by the fierce storms, or to fade in the hot sunshine, amid which she was to pursue her changeful course.  But still she was a wonderfully pleasant looking figure, and had so much promise and such an indescribable hopefulness in her aspect, that hardly anybody could meet her without anticipating some very desirable thing--the consummation of some long-sought good--from her kind offices.  A few dismal characters there may be, here and there about the world, who have so often been trifled with by young maidens as promising as she, that they have now ceased to pin any faith upon the skirts of the New Year. But, for my own part, I have great faith in her; and should I live to see fifty more such, still, from each of those successive sisters, I shall reckon upon receiving something that will be worth living for.  The New Year--for this young maiden was no less a personage--carried all her goods and chattels in a basket of no great size or weight, which hung upon her arm.  She greeted the disconsolate Old Year with great affection, and sat down beside her on the steps of the City Hall, waiting for the signal to begin her rambles through the world. The two were own sisters, being both granddaughters of Time; and though one looked so much older than the other, it was rather owing to hardships and trouble than to age, since there was but a twelvemonth’s difference between them.  “Well, my dear sister,” said the New Year, after the first salutations, “you look almost tired to death.  What have you been about during your sojourn in this part of Infinite Space?”  “O, I have it all recorded here in my Book of Chronicles,” answered the Old Year, in a heavy tone.  “There is nothing that would amuse you; and you will soon get sufficient knowledge of such matters from your own personal experience.  It is but tiresome reading.”  Nevertheless, she turned over the leaves of the folio, and glanced at them by the light of the moon, feeling an irresistible spell of interest in her own biography, although its incidents were remembered without pleasure.  The volume, though she termed it her Book of Chronicles, seemed to be neither more nor less than the Salem Gazette for 1838; in the accuracy of which journal this sagacious Old Year had so much confidence, that she deemed it needless to record her history with her own pen.  “What have you been doing in the political way?” asked the New Year.  “Why, my course here in the United States,” said the Old Year,--“though perhaps I ought to blush at the confession,--my political course, I must acknowledge, has been rather vacillatory, sometimes inclining towards the Whigs,--then causing the Administration party to shout for triumph,--and now again uplifting what seemed the almost prostrate banner of the Opposition; so that historians will hardly know what to make of me, in this respect.  But the Loco Focos--”  “I do not like these party nicknames,” interrupted her sister, who seemed remarkably touchy about some points.  “Perhaps we shall part in better humor, if we avoid any political discussion.”  “With all my heart,” replied the Old Year, who had already been tormented half to death with squabbles of this kind.  “I care not if the navies of Whig or Tory, with their interminable brawls about Banks and the Sub-Treasury, Abolition, Texas, the Florida War, and a million of other topics,--which you will learn soon enough for your own comfort,--I care not, I say, if no whisper of these matters ever reaches my ears again.  Yet they have occupied so large a share of my attention, that I scarcely know what else to tell you.  There has indeed been a curious sort of war on the Canada border, where blood has streamed in the names of Liberty and Patriotism; but it must remain for some future, perhaps far distant Year, to tell whether or no those holy names have been rightfully invoked.  Nothing so much depresses me, in my view of mortal affairs, as to see high energies wasted, and human life and happiness thrown away, for ends that appear oftentimes unwise, and still oftener remain unaccomplished.  But the wisest people and the best keep a steadfast faith that the progress of Mankind is onward and upward, and that the toil and anguish of the path serve to wear away the imperfections of the Immortal Pilgrim, and will be felt no more, when they have done their office.”  “Perhaps,” cried the hopeful New Year,--“perhaps I shall see that happy day!”  “I doubt whether it be so close at hand,” answered the Old Year, gravely smiling.  “You will soon grow weary of looking for that blessed consummation, and will turn for amusement (as has frequently been my own practice) to the affairs of some sober little city, like this of Salem.  Here we sit on the steps of the new City Hall, which has been completed under my administration; and it would make you laugh to see how the game of politics, of which the Capitol at Washington is the great chess-board, is here played in miniature. Burning Ambition finds its fuel here; here Patriotism speaks boldly in the people’s behalf, and virtuous Economy demands retrenchment in the emoluments of a lamplighter; here the Aldermen range their senatorial dignity around the Mayor’s chair of state, and the Common Council feel that they have liberty in charge.  In short, human weakness and strength, passion and policy, Man’s tendencies, his aims and modes of pursuing them, his individual character, and his character in the mass, may be studied almost as well here as on the theatre of nations; and with this great advantage, that, be the lesson ever so disastrous, its Liliputian scope still makes the beholder smile.”  “Have you done much for the improvement of the City?” asked the New Year.  “Judging from what little I have seen, it appears to be ancient and timeworn.”  “I have opened the Railroad,” said the elder Year, “and half a dozen times a day, you will hear the bell (which once summoned the Monks of a Spanish Convent to their devotions) announcing the arrival or departure of the cars.  Old Salem now wears a much livelier expression than when I first beheld her.  Strangers rumble down from Boston by hundreds at a time.  New faces throng in Essex Street.  Railroad-hacks and omnibuses rattle over the pavements.  There is a perceptible increase of oyster-shops, and other establishments for the accommodation of a transitory diurnal multitude.  But a more important change awaits the venerable town.  An immense accumulation of musty prejudices will be carried off by the free circulation of society.  A peculiarity of character, of which the inhabitants themselves are hardly sensible, will be rubbed down and worn away by the attrition of foreign substances.  Much of the result will be good; there will likewise be a few things not so good.  Whether for better or worse, there will be a probable diminution of the moral influence of wealth, and the sway of an aristocratic class, which, from an era far beyond my memory, has held firmer dominion here than in any other New England town.”  The Old Year having talked away nearly all of her little remaining breath, now closed her Book of Chronicles, and was about to take her departure.  But her sister detained her awhile longer, by inquiring the contents of the huge bandbox, which she was so painfully lugging along with her.  “These are merely a few trifles,” replied the Old Year, “which I have picked up in my rambles, and am going to deposit, in the receptacle of things past and forgotten.  We sisterhood of Years never carry anything really valuable out of the world with us. Here are patterns of most of the fashions which I brought into vogue, and which have already lived out their allotted term.  You will supply their place, with others equally ephemeral.  Here, put up in little China pots, like rouge, is a considerable lot of beautiful women’s bloom, which the disconsolate fair ones owe me a"]]]
