She succeeded in quieting Stineli enough to persuade her to relate the whole story about the lake, of which the grandmother was in total ignorance: how Rico had always been talking about this lake, and how he had longed to go to find it, and how, at last, Stineli had suggested the way for him to do so. It really seemed most likely that Rico had started to find the lake, but her father's mention of the ravines had destroyed all hope in Stineli.  The good old woman took her granddaughter by the hand, and drew her towards her, saying, \"Now, Stineli, I have something to explain to you. Do you remember what the old song says,--the one we sang with Rico on the last evening we were together?--    \"'All that He does or orders is   Sure to be finished right.'\"  Now you see, that although the good God did not exactly do this thing,--as if He had let Rico die in his bed, for instance,--yet the thing is in His hand all the same, although you have it turned aside, perhaps, a little; for certainly the good God is stronger than this little Stineli. And, now that you have made this sad mistake, it will be a lesson to you for all the rest of your life, no matter how it may turn out in the end, that children should not run away into the unknown world, nor undertake things about which they are utterly ignorant; and that without saying a word to their parents or to their grandmothers, who love them so well. But now the kind God has allowed it to happen, and we may certainly hope that it will all be finished right.  \"Now ponder this well, my Stineli, and never forget what you have thus learned by experience; and now--for I see how heavily it weighs down your heart--it will be well for you to go to pray to the good God, that He will allow this mistake of yours and Rico to turn out all right. And then you can be happy again, Stineli, and I shall be so, too; for I believe firmly that Rico is living, and that the good God has not forsaken him.\"  And Stineli became after this like her former happy self; and, although she missed Rico constantly, still she no longer felt worried, nor did she reproach herself, but looked continually down the road to Maloja, expecting to see him.     CHAPTER XI.  A LONG JOURNEY.   On that memorable Sunday evening, Rico seated himself on the chair in his gloomy bedroom. There he decided to stay until his cousin had gone to bed.  After Stineli had made the discovery that Rico could go with his fiddle down to the much-wished-for lake, the enterprise seemed a very simple thing to the lad,--so easy, that he only thought of the best way to get off. He had a presentiment that his cousin would probably try to hinder him from going, although he felt sure that she would not miss him after he was away.  So, when she began to scold him when he came home, he said to himself, \"I will be off as soon as she is once in her bed.\"  He had very pleasant thoughts as he sat there in the dark,--of how nice it would be not to hear the scolding voice of his cousin all day long, and of what big bushels of the red flowers he would bring back to Stineli when he returned. And then the picture of the sunny shores of the lake and the purple hills rose before his mind, and he fell asleep. He was not in a very comfortable position, for he had never let his fiddle leave his hand; and he soon awoke again, but it was still dark.  Now he had a clear idea of what he would do. He had his Sunday clothes on, which was good; and his cap was also on his head. He took his fiddle under his arm, and went softly down the steps, slipped the bolt aside, and stole out into the cool air of morning.  The dawn was just showing over the mountains, and in Sils the cocks were crowing. Off he walked briskly, to get well away from the houses and to reach the highway. When he once was on the road, he went along merrily; for he felt quite at home there, he had so often traversed the ground with his father. He could form no idea of how far it really was to the Maloja; and indeed it seemed very long to him, after he had been going for two good hours. Little by little it grew brighter, however; and in about an hour more, when he reached the place before the tavern upon the Maloja, where he used to stand with his father and gaze down the mountain road, the sunny light of morning lay upon the mountains, and the tips of the fir-trees were all touched with gold.  Rico seated himself upon the edge of the roadside. He was very tired, and remembered suddenly that he had not eaten any thing since the noonday meal of the day before. But he was not discouraged, for now the way was all down hill; and, after that, he should undoubtedly reach the lake.  While he sat there, the big post-wagon came rumbling along. He had often seen it as it came through Sils, and always thought that the very greatest happiness upon earth must be experienced by the driver, who sat all day long on the box, and controlled his four horses with his whip. Now he saw this happy creature nearer; for the post-wagon stopped, and the lad never once removed his eyes from the wonderful man, as he came down from his perch, stepped into the inn, and came out again with an enormous piece of black bread in his hand, upon which lay a large piece of cheese.  Next, the driver drew out a strong knife, cut a good big bit of bread, and gave each horse a mouthful in turn, not forgetting himself in the meantime; but upon his own piece of bread he put an equally big morsel of cheese. As they all stood there, eating in happy companionship, the man looked about a little, and presently called out, \"Hulloa, little musician! won't you join us too? Come hither.\"  Now when Rico saw them all eating, he fully realized how very hungry he was. He most gladly accepted the invitation, and approached the driver, who cut such a big slice of bread and also of cheese to give the lad, that Rico did not really know how he should manage to eat it.  He was obliged to put his fiddle down on the ground; and the coachman looked on very complaisantly while the boy ate his breakfast, and said, while he followed his own occupation,--  \"You are a very small fiddler. Do you know how to play something?\"  \"Oh, yes! two songs, besides those I learned from my father,\" replied Rico.  \"Really! And where are you going to on your two little legs?\" said the driver. \"To Peschiera, on the Lake of Garda,\" was the serious answer.  At these words, the coachman burst into such boisterous laughter that the boy gazed up at him in great astonishment.  \"Well, you are a good one to travel,\" cried the man, still laughing. \"Have you any notion how far it is, and that a little musician like you could wear out his two feet, and his soles, too, before he could catch sight of a single drop of the water of the Lake of Garda? Who sends you down there?\"  \"Nobody. I go of my own accord.\"  \"Well, I never have seen the like of you before,\" said the man, still laughing good-naturedly. \"Where, then, is your home, my boy?\"  \"I do not know exactly. It may be on the Lake of Garda,\" was the serious answer.  \"What sort of reply is that?\"  So saying, the coachman looked with some curiosity at the little figure before him, which certainly did not betray any signs of being neglected. On the contrary, the head, with its black curly hair, and the nice Sunday suit of clothes, gave the lad a very genteel appearance; and his delicate features and earnest eyes bore unmistakable evidence to something noble in his character, and any one who looked at him once was certain to repeat the glance with pleasure.  Such was also the case with the driver. He gazed steadfastly at Rico, and presently said, kindly, \"You carry your passport in your face, my boy; and it is not a bad one either, even if you do not know where you belong. What will you give me now, if I will carry you along with me down yonder, on the box?\"  Rico stared, for he could scarcely believe his ears at these words. To sit on that high post-wagon, and drive down into the valley! Such luck could never, never be his; of that he was sure. Besides, what had he to give the coachman in exchange?  \"I have only my fiddle in the world, and I cannot give that away,\" he said sadly, after thinking a while.  \"Well, I should not know what to do with that box,\" laughed the driver \"Come along. We will get up there, and you may play me a little music.\"  Rico could not trust his ears; but, sure enough, the coachman pushed him up over the wheel to the top of the coach, climbing up after him. The passengers had all taken their places, the doors were closed, and away they rolled down the road.--the well-known road over which Rico had so often longingly gazed, wishing that he could travel it.  Now his wish was realized. High up between heaven and earth he seemed to be flying, and could not believe that he was not in a dream.  The coachman was revolving in his own mind the question of the boy's belongings.  \"Just tell me, now, you little travelling bundle, where your father lives.\"  He asked this after having cracked his whip many times in succession as loud as he could.  \"He is dead.\"  \"Oh, dear! Well, where is your mother, then?\"  \"She is dead, too.\"  \"Well, there is always a grandfather and a grandmother, or something. Where are yours?\"  \"All dead.\"  \"At any rate, everybody has some brothers or sisters; where are yours, I should like to know?\"  \"All are dead,\" was the sorrowfully repeated answer.  When the driver had convinced himself that they were all gone, he ceased his questions about the relatives, and began in another direction with, \"What was your father's name?\"  \"Henrico Trevillo of Peschiera, on the Lake of Garda.\"  At last the driver thought he had got at the root of the matter, and said to himself this boy had strayed away, or been carried away, from his home down below there, and it is a good thing for him to get carried back where he belongs; and he thought no more about the affair.  Presently they passed the first very steep bit of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9075"],["title","Rico and Wiseli (#7)"],["body",", and came to an even stretch of ground, and the driver said, \"Now, musician, let us have a jolly song to cheer the way.\"  Full of satisfaction, and much elated at his high position on his throne under the blue heaven, the boy took his instrument and began to sing in his strong, clear tones,--      \"Little lambkins, come down.\"  Now it happened that there were three students seated up on the top of the post-wagon: they were off on a vacation trip, and very merry.  So when Rico carolled forth Stineli's song in his gayest manner, they all burst out laughing and shouted, \"Stop, singer, stop, and begin over again; we want to sing with you.\"  Rico obeyed, and the jolly students joined in with all their might,--    \"And the lambkins, and the lambkins,\"--  and laughed so extravagantly all the time that they drowned the sound of Rico's fiddle completely. And then one of them would take up the words and sing alone,--      \"And if they forgot it,     It hurt not a bit.\"  And then the others joined in, and sang as loudly as possible,--  \"And the lambkins, and the lambkins.\"  And so they went on for a long time. If Rico paused a little, they shouted, \"Go on, fiddler; don't stop yet,\" and threw little pieces of money to him over and over again, until he had quite a heap in his cap.  Within the coach the passengers opened the windows, and stuck their heads out to listen to the merry singing.  Rico started off afresh, and the students also. They divided the song into solos and chorus; and the solo sang very solemnly,--  \"And one lake, like another, From water is made.\"  And then again,--      \"And because they forgot it,     It hurt not a bit.\"  And the chorus took it up with,--    \"And the lambkins, and the lambkins.\"  Then they laughed so that they were almost dead, and were forced to be still for very fatigue and want of breath.  Presently the driver stopped, for it was time for the horses to rest, and also dinner-time. While the good man helped Rico down, he held the little fellow's cap firmly for him, for it had a lot of money in it, and the boy was busy enough with holding his fiddle carefully.  The coachman was perfectly delighted when he saw the money, and said, as he gave Rico the cap, \"That is first rate; now you can have a good dinner.\"  The students leaped down one after the other, and crowded around the fiddler to have a look at him, for they could not see him very well on the top of the coach; and when they discovered what a tiny manikin he was, they began to make merry again. Judging from his voice, they had expected to see a large, strong musician; and the sight of this child seemed to make the fun twice as funny.  They took the little fellow up between them, and carried him with singing and laughter into the inn. There they seated him at the table between two gentlemen, and said that he was their guest; and they all helped him one after the other, and put huge pieces upon his plate, for no one would be outdone by the others in serving him; and the boy had certainly never eaten such a dinner in all his life as he ate that day.  \"Tell us where you learned your beautiful song?\" asked one of three.  \"Stineli made it up,\" replied Rico, very seriously.  The students looked at each other at these words, and burst out again with laughter.  \"So Stineli made it up, did she? Then we must drink her health over it.\"  Rico had to join in drinking the toast, and was nothing loath to drink to Stineli's health.  But now the time for resting and eating was over; and while they were all taking their places to go on their journey, a stout man came towards Rico,--a man who had such a big stick in his hand, that it looked as if he had torn up a young tree for his walking-stick. He was dressed in a thick, golden-brown stuff from head to foot.  \"Come here, little one,\" he said to Rico. \"How nicely you did sing! I heard you here, inside the coach; and my business is also with sheep, for, you know, I am a sheep-dealer; and I want to give you something, because you can sing about them so prettily.\"  With these words he put a big piece of silver in Rico's hand, for the cap had been emptied by this time, and the contents transferred to the boy's pocket.  After this the man got into the coach, and the driver lifted Rico up to his high seat as if the boy had been a mere feather, and off they went.  As soon as the speed of the start had a little abated, the students called for more music, and Rico played every thing that he could remember ever having heard his father play; and at the end he played,--    \"I sing to thee with heart and voice.\"  But this tune must have put the students to sleep, for every thing became quite still; and at last the riddle was silent. The evening breeze stirred gently, and the stars climbed silently up into the sky one after the other, until they were shining brightly in every direction.  Rico looked about, and thought of Stineli, of the grandmother, of what they were now doing; and it occurred to him that this was the very time at which the prayer-bell usually rang, and when they were saying \"Our Father.\" He did the same, to be with them in that, at least: folded his hands, and said his prayer piously under the brilliant heavens.     CHAPTER XII.  IT STILL GOES ON.   At last Rico also fell asleep. He only awoke when the driver took hold of him to lift him down. All the passengers descended; and the three students came to the lad, shook him kindly by the hand, and wished a happy journey. One of them called out, \"Greet Stineli very kindly for us.\" Then they disappeared up one of the streets, and Rico could hear them as they sang merrily,--    \"And the lambkins, and the lambkins,\"  Rico now stood alone in the darkness. He had not the slightest idea where he was, nor of what he ought to do next. He presently remembered that he had not even thanked the kind coachman who had allowed him to come all this way on the coach, and he felt that he must do that at once.  The coachman and his horses were both invisible, and nothing but darkness was about the boy. At last he espied a lantern hanging up somewhere in the distance, and went towards the light. It was hanging on the stable-door, and the horses were just then brought in. Near the door stood the man with the thick stick. He seemed to be waiting for the driver; so Rico took his stand near by, and waited too.  Probably the sheep-dealer did not recognize the little fiddler in the darkness; but suddenly he exclaimed, quite surprised, \"What! is that you, little one? Where are you going to pass the night?\"  \"I do not know where,\" replied the boy.  \"Well, I never heard of such a thing; at eleven o'clock at night, and a little scrap of a boy like you in a strange place\"--  The sheep-dealer seemed to speak in a great hurry, for he could scarcely breathe in his excitement; neither did he finish his sentence, for the driver entered the stable at that moment, and Rico went up to him at once, saying, \"I want to thank you for bringing me along with you.\"  \"You have come just in the nick of time. I had almost forgotten you while I was looking after my horses, and I wanted to hand you over to an acquaintance. I was thinking of asking you, good friend,\" he continued, turning towards the dealer, \"if you would not take this little chap along with you, as you are going to Bergamo. He wants to go somewhere on the Lake of Garda. He is one of those who belong here or there. You understand, don't you?\"  The sheep-dealer thought of the stories he had heard of lost or stolen children. He looked with pity at Rico, standing in the dim light of the lantern, and said, \"He does look as if he were not in exactly the clothes that belong to him. He would become a richer dress, I am sure. I will take him with me.\"  When he had talked over the sheep-trade a little with the coachman they parted, and the dealer made a sign to Rico that he should follow him.  After a short walk, the man entered an inn, where he seated himself in a corner of the eating-room with the boy beside him.  \"Now let us look at your possessions,\" he said to Rico, \"so that we can see what they will allow you to have. Where are you going on the lake?\"  \"To Peschiera, on the Lake of Garda.\"  This was Rico's never-failing answer. He drew out his money from his pocket,--a nice little pile of small coins it was, and the big silver bit on the top of all.  \"Have you only that one bit of silver?\" asked the dealer.  \"Yes; only that one. You gave me that,\" replied the boy.  It pleased the man to think that he was the only one who had given silver; and he was also pleased that the lad was aware of the fact. He felt as if he wanted to give him something more. Just at this moment his supper was placed before him, and the kindly man nodded to his little companion, saying, \"I will pay for this, and for your night's lodging also; so you need not touch your little fortune until to-morrow.\"  Rico was so tired out with all the fiddling and singing, and the long journey, that he could scarcely eat; and as soon as he reached the big bedroom where he was to pass the night with his protector, he was asleep the moment he had put his head on the pillow.  Early the following morning, Rico was awakened from a sound sleep by a powerful grasp. He sprang quickly out of bed. His companion stood ready dressed for the journey, with his big stick in his hand.  It was not long, however, before Rico was also ready, with his fiddle tucked under his arm. They went into the dining-room, and the dealer called for coffee at once. He recommended the lad to make a good meal then; for they had a long journey before them, he said, and one that created an appetite.  When they had breakfasted to their satisfaction, they sallied forth; and, after a little, came round a sharp corner; and how Rico did open his big eyes! for there, before him, lay a great shining lake; and much excited, he shouted out, \"Now we are on the Lake of Garda!\"  \"Not for a long time yet, my boy. This is"]]]
