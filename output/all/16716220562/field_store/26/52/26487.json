They are the common property of the world, and of all time.  The ancient poets remodelled them at pleasure, and held them plastic in their hands; and why should they not be plastic in my hands, as well?”  Mr. Pringle could not forbear a smile.  “And besides,” continued Eustace, “the moment you put any warmth of heart, any passion or affection, any human or divine morality, into a classic mould, you make it quite another thing from what it was before. My own opinion is, that the Greeks, by taking possession of these legends (which were the immemorial birthright of mankind), and putting them into shapes of indestructible beauty, indeed, but cold and heartless, have done all subsequent ages an incalculable injury.”  “Which you, doubtless, were born to remedy,” said Mr. Pringle, laughing outright.  “Well, well, go on; but take my advice, and never put any of your travesties on paper.  And, as your next effort, what if you should try your hand on some one of the legends of Apollo?”  “Ah, sir, you propose it as an impossibility,” observed the student, after a moment’s meditation; “and, to be sure, at first thought, the idea of a Gothic Apollo strikes one rather ludicrously.  But I will turn over your suggestion in my mind, and do not quite despair of success.”  During the above discussion, the children (who understood not a word of it) had grown very sleepy, and were now sent off to bed.  Their drowsy babble was heard, ascending the staircase, while a northwest-wind roared loudly among the tree-tops of Tanglewood, and played an anthem around the house.  Eustace Bright went back to the study, and again endeavored to hammer out some verses, but fell asleep between two of the rhymes."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9258"],["title","The Miraculous Pitcher (#0)"],["body","WONDER-BOOK FOR GIRLS AND BOYS                       By Nathaniel Hawthorne                        THE MIRACULOUS PITCHER    CONTENTS:    THE HILLSIDE.--Introductory to “The Miraculous Pitcher”    THE MIRACULOUS PITCHER   THE HILLSIDE--After the Story    INTRODUCTORY TO “THE MIRACULOUS PITCHER”  And when, and where, do you think we find the children next?  No longer in the winter-time, but in the merry month of May.  No longer in Tanglewood play-room, or at Tanglewood fireside, but more than half-way up a monstrous hill, or a mountain, as perhaps it would be better pleased to have us call it.  They had set out from home with the mighty purpose of climbing this high hill, even to the very tiptop of its bald head.  To be sure, it was not quite so high as  Chimborazo, or Mont Blanc, and was even a good deal lower than old Graylock.  But, at any rate, it was  higher than a thousand ant-hillocks, or a million of mole hills; and, when measured by the short strides of little children, might be reckoned a very respectable mountain.  And was Cousin Eustace with the party?  Of that you may be certain; else how could the book go on a step further?  He was now in the middle of the spring vacation, and looked pretty much as we saw him four or five months ago, except that, if you gazed quite closely at his upper lip, you could discern the funniest little bit of a mustache upon it. Setting aside this mark of mature manhood, you might have considered Cousin Eustace just as much a boy as when you first became acquainted with him.  He was as merry, as playful, as good-humored, as light of foot and of spirits, and equally a favorite with the little folks, as he had always been.  This expedition up the mountain was entirely of his contrivance.  All the way up the steep ascent, he had encouraged the elder children with his cheerful voice; and when Dandelion, Cowslip, and Squash-blossom grew weary, he had lugged them along, alternately, on his back.  In this manner, they had passed through the orchards and pastures on the lower part of the hill, and had reached the wood, which extends thence towards its bare summit.  The month of May, thus far, had been more amiable than it often is, and this was as sweet and genial a day as the heart of man or child could wish.  In their progress up the hill, the small people had found enough of violets, blue and white, and some that were as golden as if they had the touch of Midas on them.  That sociablest of flowers, the little Housatonia, was very abundant.  It is a flower that never lives alone, but which loves its own kind, and is always fond of dwelling with a great many friends and relatives around it.  Sometimes you see a family of them, covering a space no bigger than the palm of your hand; and sometimes a large community, whitening a whole tract of pasture, and all keeping one another in cheerful heart and life.  Within the verge of the wood there were columbines, looking more pale than red, because they were so modest, and had thought proper to seclude themselves too anxiously from the sun.  There were wild geraniums, too, and a thousand white blossoms of the strawberry.  The trailing arbutus was not yet quite out of bloom; but it hid its precious flowers under the last year’s withered forest-leaves, as carefully as a mother-bird hides its little young ones.  It knew, I suppose, how beautiful and sweet-scented they were.  So cunning was their concealment, that the children sometimes smelt the delicate richness of their perfume, before they knew whence it proceeded.  Amid so much new life, it was strange and truly pitiful to behold, here and there, in the fields and pastures, the hoary periwig of dandelions that had already gone to seed.  They had done with summer before the summer came.  Within those small globes of winged seeds it was autumn now!  Well, but we must not waste our valuable pages with any more talk about the spring-time and wild flowers.  There is something, we hope, more interesting to be talked about.  If you look at the group of children, you may see them all gathered around Eustace Bright, who, sitting on the stump of a tree, seems to be just beginning a story.  The fact is, the younger part of the troop have found out that it takes rather too many of their short strides to measure the long ascent of the hill.  Cousin Eustace, therefore, has decided to leave Sweet Fern, Cowslip, Squash-blossom, and Dandelion, at this point, midway up, until the return of the rest of the party from the summit.  And because they complain a little, and do not quite like to stay behind, he gives them some apples out of his pocket, and proposes to tell them a very pretty story. Hereupon they brighten up, and change their grieved looks into the broadest kind of smiles.  As for the story, I was there to hear it, hidden behind a bush, and shall tell it over to you in the pages that come next.    THE MIRACULOUS PITCHER.  One evening, in times long ago, old Philemon and his old wife Baucis sat at their cottage-door, enjoying the cahn and beautiful sunset.  They had already eaten their frugal supper, and intended now to spend a quiet hour or two before bedtime.  So they talked together about their garden, and their cow, and their bees, and their grapevine, which clambered over the cottage-wall, and on which the grapes were beginning to turn purple. But the rude shouts of children and the fierce barking of dogs, in the village near at hand, grew louder and louder, until, at last, it was hardly possible for Baucis and Philemon to hear each other speak.  “Ah, wife.”  cried Philemon, “I fear some poor traveller is seeking hospitality among our neighbors yonder, and, instead of giving him food and lodging, they have set their dogs at him, as their custom is!”  “Well-a-day!” answered old Baucis, “I do wish our neighbors felt a little more kindness for their fellow-creatures.  And only think of bringing up their children in this naughty way, and patting them on the head when they fling stones at strangers!”  “Those children will never come to any good,” said Philemon, shaking his white head.  “To tell you the truth, wife, I should not wonder if some terrible thing were to happen to all the people in the village, unless they mend their manners.  But, as for you and me, so long as Providence affords us a crust of bread, let us be ready to give half to any poor, homeless stranger, that may come along and need it.”  “That ‘s right, husband!” said Baucis.  “So we will!”  These old folks, you must know, were quite poor, and had to work pretty hard for a living.  Old Philemon toiled diligently in his garden, while Baucis was always busy with her distaff, or making a little butter and cheese with their cow’s milk, or doing one thing and another about the cottage.  Their food was seldom anything but bread, milk, and vegetables, with sometimes a portion of honey from their beehive, and now and then a bunch of grapes, that had ripened against the cottage-wall. But they were two of the kindest old people in the world, and would cheerfully have gone without their dinners, any day, rather than refuse a slice of their brown loaf, a cup of new milk, and a spoonful of honey, to the weary traveller who might pause before their door.  They felt as if such guests had a sort of holiness, and that they ought, therefore, to treat them better and more bountifully than their own selves.  Their cottage stood on a rising ground, at some short distance from a village, which lay in a hollow valley, that was about half a mile in breadth.  This valley, in past ages, when the world was new, had probably been the bed of a lake.  There, fishes had glided to and fro in the depths, and water-weeds had grown along the margin, and trees and hills had seen their reflected images in the broad, and peaceful mirror. But, as the waters subsided, men had cultivated the soil, and built houses on it, so that it was now a fertile spot, and bore no traces of the ancient lake, except a very small brook, which meandered through the midst of the village, and supplied the inhabitants with water.  The valley had been dry land so long, that oaks had sprung up, and grown great and high, and perished with old age, and been succeeded by others; as tall and stately as the first.  Never was there a prettier or more fruitful valley.  The very sight of the plenty around them should have made the inhabitants kind and gentle, and ready to show their gratitude to Providence by doing good to their fellow-creatures.  But, we are sorry to say, the people of this lovely village were not worthy to dwell in a spot on which Heaven had smiled so beneficently. They were a very selfish and hard-hearted people, and had no pity for the poor, nor sympathy with the homeless.  They would only have laughed, had anybody told them that human beings owe a debt of love to one another, because there is no other method of paying the debt of love and care which all of us owe to Providence.  You will hardly believe what I am going to tell you.  These naughty people taught their children to be no better than themselves, and used to clap their hands, by way of encouragement, when they saw the little boys and girls run after some poor stranger, shouting at his heels, and pelting hum with stones.  They kept large and fierce dogs, and whenever a traveller ventured to show himself in the village street, this pack of disagreeable curs scampered to meet him, barking, snarling, and showing their teeth.  Then they would seize him by his leg, or by his clothes, just as it happened; and if he were ragged when he came, he was generally a pitiable object before he had time to run away.  This was a very terrible thing to poor travellers, as you may suppose, especially when they chanced to be sick, or feeble, or lame, or old.  Such persons (if they once knew how badly these unkind people, and their unkind children and curs, were in the habit of behaving) would go miles and miles out of their way,"]]]
