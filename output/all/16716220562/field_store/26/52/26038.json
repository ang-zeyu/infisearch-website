Let's see what you have.\"  Ethelyn was already kneeling before Patty's open trunk, and overhauling her belongings. \"Oh, here's a blue crape,\" she cried, \"you must look sweet in this. Put it on.\"  \"Why, that's my best party-frock, Ethelyn.\"  \"Never mind; wear it to-night, and mamma'll get you some new party clothes.\"  So Patty put on the blue crape, and very becoming it was, though somewhat inappropriate for a quiet family dinner.  \"We only have one maid between us,\" explained Ethelyn, calling from her own room into Patty's. \"Elise will do your hair when you want her, but just now she's doing mine.\"  To Patty's surprise, when she saw Ethelyn again, she was arrayed in a light green silk dress, and her hair was puffed high on her head. Patty wore hers as usual, and felt as if her cousin had suddenly grown up away from her.  \"Doesn't my hair look nice?\" asked Ethelyn, as the girls went down-stairs together. \"Mamma says I'm too young to have it done up this way yet, but I don't care what she says. I'm fifteen, and I think I'm old enough to do as I choose. To-morrow we'll make Elise do yours up and see how you look.\"  \"But I'm only fourteen,\" protested Patty, \"and I don't want to be grown up for years yet. Your hair looks lovely, but I like you better with it down, as it was this afternoon.\"  \"Don't say so before mamma, or shell insist on my wearing it so.\"  When the girls entered the drawing-room, Mrs. St. Clair smiled amiably at her pretty niece, and bade her come to her side.  \"My dear,\" she said, \"you are a pretty little girl, and a sweet one, I've no doubt, but your name I do not like at all. I can't abide nicknames, so I'm going to call you by your full name. What is it, Martha?\"  \"Martha!\" exclaimed Patty in surprise, \"oh, no, Aunt Isabel, I was named for my great-grandmother. My name is Patricia.\"  \"Oh, how lovely,\" cried Aunt Isabel, kissing her niece in the exuberance of her delight. \"We will all call you Patricia. It is a beautiful name and suits you extremely well. You must stand very straight, and acquire dignified manners in order to live up to it.\"  This made merry Patty laugh, but she offered no objection to her aunt's decision, and promised to sign her name Patricia whenever she wrote it, and to make no further use of the despised nickname while staying at Villa Rosa. Ethelyn was pleased too, at the change.  \"Oh,\" she said, \"now your name is as pretty as mine and Florelle's, and we have the prettiest names in Elmbridge. Here comes Reginald, you haven't seen him yet.\"  Reginald St. Clair, a lad of thirteen, advanced without a trace of shyness and greeted his new cousin.  \"So it is Patricia,\" he said, as he took her hand; \"I heard them rechristening you. How do you do, Cousin Patricia?\"  \"Very well, I thank you,\" she replied, smiling, \"and though I meet you the last of my new cousins, you are not the least,\" and she glanced up at him, for Reginald was a tall boy for his age, taller than either Ethelyn or Patty.  \"Not the least in any way, as you'll soon find out if you stay with us, Cousin Patricia.\"  Patty almost laughed at this boastful assumption of importance, but seeing that the boy was in earnest, she humored him by saying:  \"As the only son, I suppose you _are_ the flower of the family.\"  Then dinner was announced, and the beautiful dining-room was a new pleasure to the little visitor. She was rapidly making the discovery that riches and luxury were very agreeable, and she viewed with delight the handsome table sparkling with fine glass and silver.  \"Well, Patricia,\" said Uncle Robert, who had been warned against using the objectionable nickname, \"how do you like Villa Rosa so far?\"  \"Oh, I think it is beautiful, Uncle Robert. Every room is handsomer than the last, and my own room I like best of all. You're awfully good, Aunt Isabel, to give me such a lovely room, and to spend so much thought and time arranging it for me.\"  \"And money, too,\" said her aunt, smiling. \"That rug in your room, Patricia, cost four hundred dollars.\"  \"Did it really?\" said Patty, with such a look of amazement, almost horror, that they all laughed.  You see, Patty had never been used to such expensive rugs, still less had she been accustomed to hearing the prices of things mentioned so freely.  \"Oh, Aunt Isabel, I'd rather not have it then. Really, I'd much rather have a cheaper one. Suppose I should spoil it in some way.\"  \"Nonsense, my dear, spoil it if you like, I'll buy you another,\" said Uncle Robert, grandly.  \"Never mind rugs,\" interrupted Reginald. \"I say, mother, aren't you going to give a party for Patricia?\"  \"Yes, I think so,\" answered his mother, \"but I haven't decided yet what kind of an affair it shall be.\"  \"Oh, have a smashing big party, and invite everybody.\"  \"No, Reginald,\" said Ethelyn, \"I hate those big parties, they're no fun at all. It isn't going to be a party anyway. It's going to be a tea. Didn't you say so, mamma? A tea is a much nicer way to introduce Patricia than a party.\"  \"Ho, ho,\" laughed her brother, \"a tea! why they're the most stupid things in the world. Nobody wants to come to a tea.\"  \"They do so,\" retorted Ethelyn, \"you don't know anything about society. Teas are ever so much stylisher than evening entertainments, aren't they, mamma?\"  \"Well, I don't know,\" said Mrs. St. Clair, doubtfully, \"the Crandons gave a tea when their cousin visited them.\"  \"Ho, the Crandons,\" sneered Ethelyn, \"they're nobody at all; why, they've only got one horse.\"  \"I know it,\" said her mother, \"but they're awfully exclusive. They won't speak to hardly anybody.\"  \"Then don't speak to them,\" said Mr. St. Clair. \"I just guess we're as good as the Crandons any day in the week. I don't know as you'd better invite them, my dear.\"  \"They wouldn't come if you did,\" said Reginald.  \"They would so,\" snapped Ethelyn, \"they'd jump at the chance.\"  \"I bet they wouldn't!\"  \"I bet they would! You don't know everything in the world.\"  \"Neither do you!\"  \"Hush, children,\" said Mrs. St. Clair, mildly, \"your Cousin Patricia will think you very rude and unmannerly if you quarrel so. Florelle is the only one who is behaving nicely, aren't you, darling?\"  Florelle beamed at this, and looked like a little cherub, until Reginald slyly took a cake from her plate.  \"Oh-h-h!\" screamed Florelle, bursting into tears, \"he took my cakie, he did,--give it to me!\" and she began pounding her brother with her small fists.  But Reginald had eaten it, and no other cake on the plate would pacify the angry child.  \"No, no,\" she cried, \"I want that same one--it had a green nut on it,--and I wa-a-ant it!\"  \"But brother can't give it to you, baby, he's eaten it,\" said her father, vainly trying to console her with other dainties.  But Florelle continued to scream, and Mrs. St Clair was obliged to summon the nurse and have her taken up-stairs.  \"Well, that's a relief,\" said Ethelyn, as the struggling child was carried away. \"I told you you'd hear her yell pretty often, Patricia.\"  Patty felt rather embarrassed, and didn't know what to say; she was beginning to think Villa Rosa had some thorns as well as roses.  After dinner, as they sat round the great fireplace in the library, Mrs. St. Clair announced:  \"I have made up my mind. I will give a tea for Patricia in order that she may be properly introduced to the Elmbridge people,--the best of them,--and then later, we will have a large party for her.\"  This pleased everybody and amiability was restored, and all fell to making plans for the future pleasures of their guest.  When Patty went to her room that night, she was so tired out with the excitements of the day, that she was glad to go to rest.  But first of all she opened the little box that her father had given her at parting. Was it possible that she had left her father only the day before? Already it seemed like weeks.  With eager fingers she broke the seals and tore off the paper wrappings, and found to her great delight an ivory miniature of her mother.  She had seen the picture often; it had been one of her father's chief treasures, and she prized it the more highly as she thought what a sacrifice it must have been for him to give it up, even to his child.  It was in a Florentine gold frame, and Patty placed it in the centre of her dressing-table, and then sat down and gazed earnestly at it.  She saw a sweet, girlish face, which was very like her own, though she didn't recognize the resemblance.  \"Dear mother,\" she said softly, \"I will try to be just such a little girl as you would have wished me to be if you had lived to love me.\"     CHAPTER V   A MINUET  \"Mamma,\" said Ethelyn, the next morning at breakfast, \"I'm going to take a holiday from lessons to-day, because Patricia has just come, and she doesn't want to begin to study right away.\"  \"Indeed, miss, you'll do nothing of the sort,\" replied her mother; \"you had a holiday yesterday because Patricia was coming; and one the day before, on account of Mabel Miller's tea; and you had holiday all last week because of the Fancy Bazaar. When do you expect to learn anything?\"  \"Well, I don't care,\" said Ethelyn, tossing her head, \"I'm going to stay with Patricia to-day, anyhow; if she goes to the schoolroom, I will, and if she don't, I won't.\"  \"Oh, I'll go to school with you, Ethelyn,\" said Patty, anxious to please both her aunt and cousin if possible.  But Mrs. St. Clair said, \"No, indeed, Patricia, you don't want to begin lessons yet. Why, you're scarcely rested from your journey. I am going to New York to-day to buy you some new dresses, and if you're not too tired, you may go with me and help select them.\"  \"Well, I just guess Patricia won't go to New York, unless I go too,\" cried Ethelyn in great excitement. \"Do you think I'll stay at home and grub in the schoolroom while she's having a good time in the city? Not much, my Mary Anne!\"  \"Ethelyn!\" said her mother, reprovingly, \"how many times must I tell you not to use slang? "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8456"],["title","Patty Fairfield (#4)"],["body","is vulgar and unladylike, and quite out of keeping with your social position.\"  \"I don't care; it's expressive if it isn't stylish.\"  \"Don't say stylish, either. That isn't genteel at all. Say 'correct.'\"  \"Oh, 'correct.' Well, mother, I guess it must be correct to use slang, 'cause Gladys Mahoney does, and she's a hummer on style.\"  \"And I've no doubt her mother reproves her for it, just as I do you. Now go to the schoolroom, it is nearly ten o'clock.\"  \"I won't go unless Patricia comes too. If she's going to New York with you, I'm going.\"  \"Ethelyn,\" said Mrs. St. Clair, sternly, \"do as I bid you. Go to the schoolroom at once, and study your lessons diligently.\"  \"No, I won't,\" replied Ethelyn, stubbornly, \"I won't stir a step unless Patty comes too.\"  \"But I'm going to take Patricia to New York.\"  \"Then I'm going to New York,\" said Ethelyn, with an air of settling the question, and then she began drumming on the table with her fingers.  \"I want to go to New York with you, mamma,\" said Florelle; \"I want to buy a new dolly.\"  \"No, baby,\" said her mother, \"you can't go this time. You stay at home like a good girlie, and I'll bring you a beautiful new doll.\"  \"But I _want_ to go! I _will_ go!\" and Florelle began to cry.  \"Stop that crying,\" said her father, \"stop it at once, and when I come home I'll bring you a big box of candy.\"  \"No, I don't want candy,--I want to go to New York,--I want to go--I do-o-o,\" she wound up with a prolonged wail.  \"Good gracious, Florelle,\" said Reginald, \"do stop that fearful yowling. If you don't, as soon as I go down town I'll send a bear back here to eat you up.\"  At this Florelle screamed louder than ever, and had to be taken away from the table.  Patty felt quite helpless in the midst of this commotion. She had been accustomed to obey willingly her father's lightest wish, and Ethelyn's impertinence amazed her. As for little Florelle, she thought the child was quite old enough to be reasoned with, and taught not to cry so violently over every trifle.  But she realized it was not her place to criticise her cousins' behavior, so she did the best she could to pour oil on the troubled waters.  \"Aunt Isabel,\" she said, \"if you don't mind, I'll stay at home and study with Ethelyn.\"  \"Well, do as you like, child,\" said her aunt, carelessly; \"of course I can select your clothes just as well without you, and I'll take you both to New York some Saturday. But you needn't study unless you choose, you know.\"  \"Well, I'll stay with Ethelyn, anyway,\" said Patty, tucking her arm through her cousin's as they went off to the schoolroom.  \"What a mean old thing you are,\" said Ethelyn crossly. \"You might just as well have said you'd go to New York, and then I would have gone too, and we could have had a lovely time shopping, and lunching at Delmonico's, and perhaps going to a matinée.\"  \"But your mother said you couldn't go,\" said Patty, in surprise.  \"Oh, that's nothing. I would have gone all the same, and now you've spoiled it all and we've got to drudge over our books. Here's the schoolroom. Miss Morton, this is my cousin, Patricia Fairfield. She is to begin lessons to-day.\"  While Ethelyn was talking, the girls had mounted to the third floor of the great house, and entered the large and attractive-looking schoolroom.  Miss Morton was a sweet-faced young woman, who greeted Ethelyn pleasantly and then turned cordially to the stranger.  \"We are glad to have you with us,\" she said; \"you may sit here at this desk, and presently I will ask you some questions about your studies.\"  Reginald was already in his place and was studying away for dear life. He was naturally a studious boy, and he was anxious to prepare himself to enter a certain school the next year.  But Ethelyn had no taste for study, and she flounced herself into her chair and unwillingly took up her books.  \"Now, Ethelyn,\" said Miss Morton, \"you must learn that history lesson to-day. You've dawdled over it so long, that it has become a real bug bear to you. But I'm sure if you determine to conquer it, you can easily do so. Just try it.\"  \"Ho,\" called out Reginald, teasingly, \"can't learn a history lesson! I couldn't wait for you, so I went on ahead. I'm 'way over to the 'Founding of the German Empire.' Where are you in history, Patricia?\"  \"I've only studied United States History,\" she replied, a little ashamed of her small attainments, \"but I've been through that twice.\"  \"Well,\" said Miss Morton, kindly, \"it's better to know one thing thoroughly than to have smatterings of a great many. If you are familiar with United States History, you will enjoy lessons in the history of other countries for a change.\"  \"I'm sure I shall,\" said Patty, \"and my father told me to study whatever you thought best for me. But I don't like to study very much. I'd rather read story books.\"  Miss Morton examined Patty in arithmetic, geography, and some other branches, and decided that as her attainments in knowledge were about equal to those of her cousins, they might all have the same lessons each day.  Patty afterwards discovered that Reginald learned these lessons, and Ethelyn did not. But she simply skipped them and went on to the next, apparently making the same progress as her brother.  Patty had become absorbed in her history lesson, which was very interesting, when Ethelyn began to chatter.  \"Miss Morton,\" she said, \"we are going to have a party for my cousin.\"  \"Are you? That will be very nice, but don't let us discuss it now, for I want you to put your whole attention on that history lesson.\"  \"I will,--but, Miss Morton, it's going to be a very grand party. Everybody in Elmbridge will be invited. I mean,\" she added, tossing her head, \"everybody that _is_ anybody.\"  \"Everybody is somebody,\" said Reginald, without looking up from his book, \"and I wish you'd keep still, Ethelyn.\"  \"Well, you know what I mean; everybody that's rich and important, and fit for us to know.\"  \"Why,\" said Patty, looking at her cousin in surprise, \"aren't people fit for you to know unless they're rich?\"  \"No,\" said Ethelyn, \"I wouldn't associate with people unless they were rich, and neither would you, Patricia.\"  \"Yes, I would,\" said Patty, stoutly, \"if they were good and wise and refined, and they often are.\"  \"Well, you can't associate with them while you're living with us, anyhow; we only go with the swells.\"  \"Ethelyn,\" said Miss Morton, gently, \"that isn't the right way to talk. I think--\"  \"Oh, never mind what you think,\" said Ethelyn, rudely, \"you know the last time you preached to me, I nearly made mamma discharge you, and I'll do it for sure if you try it again.\"  Miss Morton bit her lip and said nothing, for she was a poor girl and had no wish to lose her lucrative position in the St. Clair household, though her ideas were widely at variance with those of her employers. But Patty's sense of justice was roused.  \"Oh, Ethelyn,\" she said, \"how can you speak to your teacher so? You ought to be ashamed of yourself.\"  \"Oh, Miss Morton don't mind, do you?\" said Ethelyn, who was really only careless, and had no wish to be unkind, \"and it's true. I will have her sent away if she preaches at us, 'cause I hate it; but she won't preach any more, will you, Morty?\" and Ethelyn smiled at her governess in a wheedlesome way.  \"Go on with your lessons,\" said Miss Morton, in a quiet tone, though she was with difficulty repressing a desire to tell her pupil what she thought of her.  \"Yes, do,\" growled Reginald; \"how can a fellow study when you're chattering away with your shrill voice?\"  \"I haven't got a shrill voice,\" retorted Ethelyn, \"have I, Patricia? Mamma says a soft, low voice is very stylish,--correct, I mean, and I'm sure mine is low and soft.\"  Ethelyn said this in such an affected whisper that Patty had to smile.  But Reginald said:  \"Pooh, of course you have when you put on airs like that, but naturally your voice is a cross between a locomotive whistle and scratching on a slate.\"  \"It isn't!\"  \"It is!\"  \"Well, yours isn't a bit better, anyway.\"  \"I didn't say it was, did I?\"  \"I didn't say you did say so, did I?\"  \"I didn't say you said I said so, did I?\"  \"I didn't say you said, I said--you said,--\"  \"Children, stop quarreling,\" said Miss Morton, half laughing at the angry combatants whose flushed faces showed signs of coming tears.  But Patty laughed outright. \"What sillies you are,\" she said, \"to squabble so over nothing.\"  When school was over, it was time for luncheon, and after that Ethelyn told Patty that it was the afternoon for dancing-class and they were all to go.  \"You must wear your blue crape, Patricia,\" she said, \"and make yourself look as pretty as you can, and put on all your jewelry.\"  \"But I haven't any jewelry,\" said Patty; \"papa says little girls oughtn't to wear any.\"  \"No jewelry? Why, how funny. I have loads of it. Well, no matter, I'll lend you some of mine; or we'll crib some out of mamma's jewel-case; I know where she hides the key.\"  \"Thank you, Ethelyn, but I wouldn't wear borrowed ornaments, and I don't want to wear jewelry anyway. I'm not old enough.\"  \"Oh, you are too! what silly, old-fashioned notions you have. And besides, while you're with us, mamma said you must do whatever we want you to.\"  So Patty reluctantly allowed Ethelyn to clasp a necklace round her throat, and slip several jingling bangles on her wrists.  \"There!\" said Ethelyn, adding an emerald brooch, which she had selected from her mother's collection, \"now you don't look like a pauper anyhow.\"  \"But I don't feel comfortable, Ethelyn, and besides, suppose I should lose these things.\"  \"Oh, you won't lose them; and if you should, I don't believe mamma would scold much. She'd like it better than if I let you go looking like a nobody, and have the Mahoneys think our cousin was poor.\"  Ethelyn herself was resplendent in red silk trimmed with spangled lace. She wore shining slippers with high French heels, and all the jewelry she could cram on to her small person."]]]
