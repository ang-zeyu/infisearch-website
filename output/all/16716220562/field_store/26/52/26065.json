I know what the massive safe holds secure for me, for me alone, and the exquisite pleasure of waiting is hardly enhanced when the safe opens and I lift, from its velvet crown, a diadem of purest gold, blazing with diamonds. I do this every day, and yet the joy of waiting and at last touching again the diadem, only seems to increase as the days pass. It is a diadem fit for a King among kings, an Emperor among emperors. The King in Yellow might scorn it, but it shall be worn by his royal servant.  I held it in my arms until the alarm in the safe rang harshly, and then tenderly, proudly, I replaced it and shut the steel doors. I walked slowly back into my study, which faces Washington Square, and leaned on the window sill. The afternoon sun poured into my windows, and a gentle breeze stirred the branches of the elms and maples in the park, now covered with buds and tender foliage. A flock of pigeons circled about the tower of the Memorial Church; sometimes alighting on the purple tiled roof, sometimes wheeling downward to the lotos fountain in front of the marble arch. The gardeners were busy with the flower beds around the fountain, and the freshly turned earth smelled sweet and spicy. A lawn mower, drawn by a fat white horse, clinked across the green sward, and watering-carts poured showers of spray over the asphalt drives. Around the statue of Peter Stuyvesant, which in 1897 had replaced the monstrosity supposed to represent Garibaldi, children played in the spring sunshine, and nurse girls wheeled elaborate baby carriages with a reckless disregard for the pasty-faced occupants, which could probably be explained by the presence of half a dozen trim dragoon troopers languidly lolling on the benches. Through the trees, the Washington Memorial Arch glistened like silver in the sunshine, and beyond, on the eastern extremity of the square the grey stone barracks of the dragoons, and the white granite artillery stables were alive with colour and motion.  I looked at the Lethal Chamber on the corner of the square opposite. A few curious people still lingered about the gilded iron railing, but inside the grounds the paths were deserted. I watched the fountains ripple and sparkle; the sparrows had already found this new bathing nook, and the basins were covered with the dusty-feathered little things. Two or three white peacocks picked their way across the lawns, and a drab coloured pigeon sat so motionless on the arm of one of the \"Fates,\" that it seemed to be a part of the sculptured stone.  As I was turning carelessly away, a slight commotion in the group of curious loiterers around the gates attracted my attention. A young man had entered, and was advancing with nervous strides along the gravel path which leads to the bronze doors of the Lethal Chamber. He paused a moment before the \"Fates,\" and as he raised his head to those three mysterious faces, the pigeon rose from its sculptured perch, circled about for a moment and wheeled to the east. The young man pressed his hand to his face, and then with an undefinable gesture sprang up the marble steps, the bronze doors closed behind him, and half an hour later the loiterers slouched away, and the frightened pigeon returned to its perch in the arms of Fate.  I put on my hat and went out into the park for a little walk before dinner. As I crossed the central driveway a group of officers passed, and one of them called out, \"Hello, Hildred,\" and came back to shake hands with me. It was my cousin Louis, who stood smiling and tapping his spurred heels with his riding-whip.  \"Just back from Westchester,\" he said; \"been doing the bucolic; milk and curds, you know, dairy-maids in sunbonnets, who say 'haeow' and 'I don't think' when you tell them they are pretty. I'm nearly dead for a square meal at Delmonico's. What's the news?\"  \"There is none,\" I replied pleasantly. \"I saw your regiment coming in this morning.\"  \"Did you? I didn't see you. Where were you?\"  \"In Mr. Wilde's window.\"  \"Oh, hell!\" he began impatiently, \"that man is stark mad! I don't understand why you--\"  He saw how annoyed I felt by this outburst, and begged my pardon.  \"Really, old chap,\" he said, \"I don't mean to run down a man you like, but for the life of me I can't see what the deuce you find in common with Mr. Wilde. He's not well bred, to put it generously; he is hideously deformed; his head is the head of a criminally insane person. You know yourself he's been in an asylum--\"  \"So have I,\" I interrupted calmly.  Louis looked startled and confused for a moment, but recovered and slapped me heartily on the shoulder. \"You were completely cured,\" he began; but I stopped him again.  \"I suppose you mean that I was simply acknowledged never to have been insane.\"  \"Of course that--that's what I meant,\" he laughed.  I disliked his laugh because I knew it was forced, but I nodded gaily and asked him where he was going. Louis looked after his brother officers who had now almost reached Broadway.  \"We had intended to sample a Brunswick cocktail, but to tell you the truth I was anxious for an excuse to go and see Hawberk instead. Come along, I'll make you my excuse.\"  We found old Hawberk, neatly attired in a fresh spring suit, standing at the door of his shop and sniffing the air.  \"I had just decided to take Constance for a little stroll before dinner,\" he replied to the impetuous volley of questions from Louis. \"We thought of walking on the park terrace along the North River.\"  At that moment Constance appeared and grew pale and rosy by turns as Louis bent over her small gloved fingers. I tried to excuse myself, alleging an engagement uptown, but Louis and Constance would not listen, and I saw I was expected to remain and engage old Hawberk's attention. After all it would be just as well if I kept my eye on Louis, I thought, and when they hailed a Spring Street horse-car, I got in after them and took my seat beside the armourer.  The beautiful line of parks and granite terraces overlooking the wharves along the North River, which were built in 1910 and finished in the autumn of 1917, had become one of the most popular promenades in the metropolis. They extended from the battery to 190th Street, overlooking the noble river and affording a fine view of the Jersey shore and the Highlands opposite. Cafés and restaurants were scattered here and there among the trees, and twice a week military bands from the garrison played in the kiosques on the parapets.  We sat down in the sunshine on the bench at the foot of the equestrian statue of General Sheridan. Constance tipped her sunshade to shield her eyes, and she and Louis began a murmuring conversation which was impossible to catch. Old Hawberk, leaning on his ivory headed cane, lighted an excellent cigar, the mate to which I politely refused, and smiled at vacancy. The sun hung low above the Staten Island woods, and the bay was dyed with golden hues reflected from the sun-warmed sails of the shipping in the harbour.  Brigs, schooners, yachts, clumsy ferry-boats, their decks swarming with people, railroad transports carrying lines of brown, blue and white freight cars, stately sound steamers, déclassé tramp steamers, coasters, dredgers, scows, and everywhere pervading the entire bay impudent little tugs puffing and whistling officiously;--these were the craft which churned the sunlight waters as far as the eye could reach. In calm contrast to the hurry of sailing vessel and steamer a silent fleet of white warships lay motionless in midstream.  Constance's merry laugh aroused me from my reverie.  \"What _are_ you staring at?\" she inquired.  \"Nothing--the fleet,\" I smiled.  Then Louis told us what the vessels were, pointing out each by its relative position to the old Red Fort on Governor's Island.  \"That little cigar shaped thing is a torpedo boat,\" he explained; \"there are four more lying close together. They are the _Tarpon_, the _Falcon_, the _Sea Fox_, and the _Octopus_. The gun-boats just above are the _Princeton_, the _Champlain_, the _Still Water_ and the _Erie_. Next to them lie the cruisers _Faragut_ and _Los Angeles_, and above them the battle ships _California_, and _Dakota_, and the _Washington_ which is the flag ship. Those two squatty looking chunks of metal which are anchored there off Castle William are the double turreted monitors _Terrible_ and _Magnificent_; behind them lies the ram, _Osceola_.\"  Constance looked at him with deep approval in her beautiful eyes. \"What loads of things you know for a soldier,\" she said, and we all joined in the laugh which followed.  Presently Louis rose with a nod to us and offered his arm to Constance, and they strolled away along the river wall. Hawberk watched them for a moment and then turned to me.  \"Mr. Wilde was right,\" he said. \"I have found the missing tassets and left cuissard of the 'Prince's Emblazoned,' in a vile old junk garret in Pell Street.\"  \"998?\" I inquired, with a smile.  \"Yes.\"  \"Mr. Wilde is a very intelligent man,\" I observed.  \"I want to give him the credit of this most important discovery,\" continued Hawberk. \"And I intend it shall be known that he is entitled to the fame of it.\"  \"He won't thank you for that,\" I answered sharply; \"please say nothing about it.\"  \"Do you know what it is worth?\" said Hawberk.  \"No, fifty dollars, perhaps.\"  \"It is valued at five hundred, but the owner of the 'Prince's Emblazoned' will give two thousand dollars to the person who completes his suit; that reward also belongs to Mr. Wilde.\"  \"He doesn't want it! He refuses it!\" I answered angrily. \"What do you know about Mr. Wilde? He doesn't need the money. He is rich--or will be--richer than any living man except myself. What will we care for money then--what will we care, he and I, when--when--\"  \"When what?\" demanded Hawberk, astonished.  \"You will see,\" I replied, on my guard again.  He looked at me narrowly, much as Doctor Archer"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8492"],["title","The King in Yellow (#4)"],["body","to, and I knew he thought I was mentally unsound. Perhaps it was fortunate for him that he did not use the word lunatic just then.  \"No,\" I replied to his unspoken thought, \"I am not mentally weak; my mind is as healthy as Mr. Wilde's. I do not care to explain just yet what I have on hand, but it is an investment which will pay more than mere gold, silver and precious stones. It will secure the happiness and prosperity of a continent--yes, a hemisphere!\"  \"Oh,\" said Hawberk.  \"And eventually,\" I continued more quietly, \"it will secure the happiness of the whole world.\"  \"And incidentally your own happiness and prosperity as well as Mr. Wilde's?\"  \"Exactly,\" I smiled. But I could have throttled him for taking that tone.  He looked at me in silence for a while and then said very gently, \"Why don't you give up your books and studies, Mr. Castaigne, and take a tramp among the mountains somewhere or other? You used to be fond of fishing. Take a cast or two at the trout in the Rangelys.\"  \"I don't care for fishing any more,\" I answered, without a shade of annoyance in my voice.  \"You used to be fond of everything,\" he continued; \"athletics, yachting, shooting, riding--\"  \"I have never cared to ride since my fall,\" I said quietly.  \"Ah, yes, your fall,\" he repeated, looking away from me.  I thought this nonsense had gone far enough, so I brought the conversation back to Mr. Wilde; but he was scanning my face again in a manner highly offensive to me.  \"Mr. Wilde,\" he repeated, \"do you know what he did this afternoon? He came downstairs and nailed a sign over the hall door next to mine; it read:  \"MR. WILDE, REPAIRER OF REPUTATIONS. Third Bell.  \"Do you know what a Repairer of Reputations can be?\"  \"I do,\" I replied, suppressing the rage within.  \"Oh,\" he said again.  Louis and Constance came strolling by and stopped to ask if we would join them. Hawberk looked at his watch. At the same moment a puff of smoke shot from the casemates of Castle William, and the boom of the sunset gun rolled across the water and was re-echoed from the Highlands opposite. The flag came running down from the flag-pole, the bugles sounded on the white decks of the warships, and the first electric light sparkled out from the Jersey shore.  As I turned into the city with Hawberk I heard Constance murmur something to Louis which I did not understand; but Louis whispered \"My darling,\" in reply; and again, walking ahead with Hawberk through the square I heard a murmur of \"sweetheart,\" and \"my own Constance,\" and I knew the time had nearly arrived when I should speak of important matters with my cousin Louis.     III  One morning early in May I stood before the steel safe in my bedroom, trying on the golden jewelled crown. The diamonds flashed fire as I turned to the mirror, and the heavy beaten gold burned like a halo about my head. I remembered Camilla's agonized scream and the awful words echoing through the dim streets of Carcosa. They were the last lines in the first act, and I dared not think of what followed--dared not, even in the spring sunshine, there in my own room, surrounded with familiar objects, reassured by the bustle from the street and the voices of the servants in the hallway outside. For those poisoned words had dropped slowly into my heart, as death-sweat drops upon a bed-sheet and is absorbed. Trembling, I put the diadem from my head and wiped my forehead, but I thought of Hastur and of my own rightful ambition, and I remembered Mr. Wilde as I had last left him, his face all torn and bloody from the claws of that devil's creature, and what he said--ah, what he said. The alarm bell in the safe began to whirr harshly, and I knew my time was up; but I would not heed it, and replacing the flashing circlet upon my head I turned defiantly to the mirror. I stood for a long time absorbed in the changing expression of my own eyes. The mirror reflected a face which was like my own, but whiter, and so thin that I hardly recognized it And all the time I kept repeating between my clenched teeth, \"The day has come! the day has come!\" while the alarm in the safe whirred and clamoured, and the diamonds sparkled and flamed above my brow. I heard a door open but did not heed it. It was only when I saw two faces in the mirror:--it was only when another face rose over my shoulder, and two other eyes met mine. I wheeled like a flash and seized a long knife from my dressing-table, and my cousin sprang back very pale, crying: \"Hildred! for God's sake!\" then as my hand fell, he said: \"It is I, Louis, don't you know me?\" I stood silent. I could not have spoken for my life. He walked up to me and took the knife from my hand.  \"What is all this?\" he inquired, in a gentle voice. \"Are you ill?\"  \"No,\" I replied. But I doubt if he heard me.  \"Come, come, old fellow,\" he cried, \"take off that brass crown and toddle into the study. Are you going to a masquerade? What's all this theatrical tinsel anyway?\"  I was glad he thought the crown was made of brass and paste, yet I didn't like him any the better for thinking so. I let him take it from my hand, knowing it was best to humour him. He tossed the splendid diadem in the air, and catching it, turned to me smiling.  \"It's dear at fifty cents,\" he said. \"What's it for?\"  I did not answer, but took the circlet from his hands, and placing it in the safe shut the massive steel door. The alarm ceased its infernal din at once. He watched me curiously, but did not seem to notice the sudden ceasing of the alarm. He did, however, speak of the safe as a biscuit box. Fearing lest he might examine the combination I led the way into my study. Louis threw himself on the sofa and flicked at flies with his eternal riding-whip. He wore his fatigue uniform with the braided jacket and jaunty cap, and I noticed that his riding-boots were all splashed with red mud.  \"Where have you been?\" I inquired.  \"Jumping mud creeks in Jersey,\" he said. \"I haven't had time to change yet; I was rather in a hurry to see you. Haven't you got a glass of something? I'm dead tired; been in the saddle twenty-four hours.\"  I gave him some brandy from my medicinal store, which he drank with a grimace.  \"Damned bad stuff,\" he observed. \"I'll give you an address where they sell brandy that is brandy.\"  \"It's good enough for my needs,\" I said indifferently. \"I use it to rub my chest with.\" He stared and flicked at another fly.  \"See here, old fellow,\" he began, \"I've got something to suggest to you. It's four years now that you've shut yourself up here like an owl, never going anywhere, never taking any healthy exercise, never doing a damn thing but poring over those books up there on the mantelpiece.\"  He glanced along the row of shelves. \"Napoleon, Napoleon, Napoleon!\" he read. \"For heaven's sake, have you nothing but Napoleons there?\"  \"I wish they were bound in gold,\" I said. \"But wait, yes, there is another book, _The King in Yellow_.\" I looked him steadily in the eye.  \"Have you never read it?\" I asked.  \"I? No, thank God! I don't want to be driven crazy.\"  I saw he regretted his speech as soon as he had uttered it. There is only one word which I loathe more than I do lunatic and that word is crazy. But I controlled myself and asked him why he thought _The King in Yellow_ dangerous.  \"Oh, I don't know,\" he said, hastily. \"I only remember the excitement it created and the denunciations from pulpit and Press. I believe the author shot himself after bringing forth this monstrosity, didn't he?\"  \"I understand he is still alive,\" I answered.  \"That's probably true,\" he muttered; \"bullets couldn't kill a fiend like that.\"  \"It is a book of great truths,\" I said.  \"Yes,\" he replied, \"of 'truths' which send men frantic and blast their lives. I don't care if the thing is, as they say, the very supreme essence of art. It's a crime to have written it, and I for one shall never open its pages.\"  \"Is that what you have come to tell me?\" I asked.  \"No,\" he said, \"I came to tell you that I am going to be married.\"  I believe for a moment my heart ceased to beat, but I kept my eyes on his face.  \"Yes,\" he continued, smiling happily, \"married to the sweetest girl on earth.\"  \"Constance Hawberk,\" I said mechanically.  \"How did you know?\" he cried, astonished. \"I didn't know it myself until that evening last April, when we strolled down to the embankment before dinner.\"  \"When is it to be?\" I asked.  \"It was to have been next September, but an hour ago a despatch came ordering our regiment to the Presidio, San Francisco. We leave at noon to-morrow. To-morrow,\" he repeated. \"Just think, Hildred, to-morrow I shall be the happiest fellow that ever drew breath in this jolly world, for Constance will go with me.\"  I offered him my hand in congratulation, and he seized and shook it like the good-natured fool he was--or pretended to be.  \"I am going to get my squadron as a wedding present,\" he rattled on. \"Captain and Mrs. Louis Castaigne, eh, Hildred?\"  Then he told me where it was to be and who were to be there, and made me promise to come and be best man. I set my teeth and listened to his boyish chatter without showing what I felt, but--  I was getting to the limit of my endurance, and when he jumped up, and, switching his spurs till they jingled, said he must go, I did not detain him.  \"There's one thing I want to ask of you,\" I said quietly.  \"Out with it, it's promised,\" he laughed.  \"I want you to meet me for a quarter of an hour's talk to-night.\"  \"Of course, if you wish,\" he said, somewhat puzzled. \"Where?\"  \"Anywhere, in the park there.\"  \"What time, Hildred?\"  \"Midnight.\"  \"What in the name of--\" he began, but checked himself and laughingly assented. I watched him go down the stairs and hurry away, his sabre banging at every stride. He turned into Bleecker Street, and I knew he was going to see Constance. I gave him ten minutes to disappear and then followed in his footsteps, taking with me the jewelled crown and the silken robe embroidered with the Yellow "]]]
