You see, I suppose you know about the Camp Fire Girls, everybody seems to have heard except me, but now 'That light which has been given to me, I desire to pass undimmed to others.'  Will you, won't you, will you, won't you be a Camp Fire Girl?\"  Her manner, which had been a queer combination of fun and seriousness, now at last appeared entirely grave. \"Mollie and Polly,\" she continued quietly, \"You know how often we have talked lately of being dissatisfied, of feeling that here we are growing older and older every day and yet not learning half the things we ought to learn nor having half the fun we ought to have.  Of course we read novels all the time, because it is the only way for nice girls to learn about romance or adventure, but we would like really to live the things we think about just the same as boys do.  They don't dream and scold about the things they want to do; they go ahead and do them, teaching one another by working things out together. They belong to things and don't just have to have things belong to them' to make them happy like girls do.\"  \"Hear, hear!\" cried Polly, not exactly seeing what Betty was driving at and desiring to tease her into greater confusion.  But as Mrs. O'Neill shook her head encouragingly, Betty would not deign to consider her tormentor.  \"Oh, it is foolish for me to try to explain all the Camp Fire idea means,\" she added simply.  \"I couldn't if I tried, for Esther Clark, the strange girl who has been living at the asylum and has just come to our house, only told me what she knew this afternoon.  But I want to find out by living the Camp Fire idea, I want to see what we could get out of forming a Camp Fire Club, the first one here in Woodford.  Just take Polly and Mollie and me, for example, Mary dear,\" she continued coaxingly.  \"I am longing to know the things Mollie does about cooking and housekeeping and all the rest and I can't learn at home.  Think what it means to go messing about in our kitchen with, cook and half a dozen servants laughing at you!  Then Mollie really would like to know what Polly and I find so fascinating in books and in prowling about together in the woods and Polly--well, I don't know that she wishes to learn anything from Mollie or me or anybody else who joins our club, but if she doesn't, that is just what she ought to learn.\"  Polly held up both hands.  \"For goodness sake, Betty, stop talking, I will join your Camp Fire Club and be made an example of at any time, also I will use my noble influence to persuade any girls you wish to join.  All the same I don't see what your wretched club has to do with helping us solve our problem about mother, and that is all I care about at present.\"  \"Has to do,--why everything,\" Betty repeated slowly.  But before she was able to finish her sentence there was a sudden loud ringing of the front door bell and the three girls jumped to their feet.  In another moment Polly had disappeared into the hall, returning with her expression changed again to its original look of gloom.  \"It's that granite man, mother, Mr. Wharton, with his entire family, son and daughter.  I wonder why they can't leave you alone after business hours?  I had to ask them in the parlor, since we can't entertain any one in the kitchen except 'The Princess,' but we simply can't join you until we hear what she has to say.\"  Polly sighed as her mother rose without replying and left the room, and Betty did he her best to hide her smiles, for everybody in Woodford believed that Mrs. O'Neill's employer had more than a friendly interest in her, and though Polly constantly railed at their poverty and Mr. Wharton was the richest man in the village, the very sound of his name used often to irritate her.  The candles had at last burned down to their sockets and softly Betty blew out the last flickering flames.  With a nod of understanding Mollie turned down the lighted lamp and after a fashion of many years the three girls drew three little old fashioned rockers in a semicircle up before the kitchen fire.  \"My plan is to form our Camp Fire Club of just the right girls and to have just the right guardian and then to spend our whole summer camping in the woods,\" Betty explained quickly at last.  \"You see I don't want to go to Europe with mother and father this summer one bit, I am dead tired of hotels and sights.  So at dinner to-night I talked over the Camp Fire plan with father and though mother wasn't enthusiastic I could see father didn't think it in the least a bad idea, so I am sure he will give us the camping outfit if I beg very hard and we can all share expenses afterwards.  Can't you understand that if Mary lets you spend your summer in camp she can go away and rest and think no more about you and we can have such a wonderful time.\"  In the half darkness Polly danced a shadow dance and then flung her arms about her friend.  \"Oh, Princess, I might have known you were as clever as 'Sentimental Tommy' and would surely 'find a wa'.  I am sure mother will think it a beautiful plan for us.  Just to live among the trees and the stars and hear the birds sing, and tell stories about our own camp fire and to sing.\"  \"Yes, and to do our own cooking and cleaning and wood gathering and a thousand other practical things,\" laughed Betty, to stop Polly's rhapsodizing.  \"But the truly important part of our scheme is to find congenial girls for our club and the right guardian.\"  \"There are four of us already,\" Mollie suggested.  Betty appeared surprised.  \"Just you and Polly and me; what fourth girl do you mean?\"  As Mollie did not answer at once, a low whistle came from between Polly's closed lips.  \"Do you mean, Princess, that you do not intend to invite the girl who told you about the Camp Fire Club, Esther Clark?  I know her by sight at school.\"  Betty frowned.  \"Certainly I had not meant to include her; she does not belong to our set.  I don't mean to be rude, but she has been raised in an orphan asylum and nobody knows who she is.  I suppose she comes of some very common family.\"  \"Common families sometimes produce very uncommon characters,\" Polly returned dryly.  \"And s-n-o-b spells snob, but not Betty, I hope.  I wish you wouldn't think so much about 'family', Princess; I do believe we ought to judge people by what they are themselves and not by what their ancestors have been.\"  With a quick movement Betty half overturned her chair.  \"Good-night,\" she said, \"we can talk things over to-morrow.  I promised not to be too late to-night.  It isn't that I really mind having Esther in our club, only we don't know her very well and it seems most important that we should all be congenial.\"  But Betty could not move toward the door because her skirts were held fast. \"If you go now I shall cry my eyes out all night,\" Polly protested in a tone that was almost convincing.  \"It was horrid of me, darling, to tell you the truth and me Irish and believin' in the blarney stone,\" she apologized in her Pollyesque fashion.  \"Please never, never tell me the truth about myself and have anybody in your club you like.  Only if you expect to have twelve girls who exactly agree you will have to leave both you and me out to start with.\"  Betty laughed, only half appeased, but Mollie was speaking quietly and because she talked less frequently than the other two girls they usually paused to listen to her.  \"I think the more unlike we girls are the more fun we will have and the more we will help one another,\" she suggested.  \"But, Betty, do you know who has started this Camp Fire idea in Woodford and who knows just what we ought to do?\"  Betty groaned.  \"Who else could it be, my dear, but my arch-enemy, the person I like least and who likes me even less in all this village.  Ah, is anything ever perfect in this life?  Martha McMurtry, the science teacher at the high school, who will certainly cause me to remain in the sophomore class another year unless I learn something more than what H2O means, is the only woman Esther could suggest.\"  The sisters laughed, since Betty's battles with this teacher had kept things lively.  \"You poor dear, we can't have her for our guardian,\" Polly insisted sympathetically.  \"Can you imagine such a prim, scientific old maid ever understanding anything of the beauty and romance of life in the woods? I would like Titania, Queen of the Fairies, to be our only chaperon.\"  Before the other girls could dispute the absurdity of Polly's final suggestion, the kitchen door opened and Mrs. O'Neill returned looking unusually cross.  \"Why didn't you join me, you wicked children?\" she said reproachfully.  \"Mr. Wharton came to ask me, since I was not going away, to look after his little girl this summer.  He has to leave on some business trip and as Frank is to camp in the woods, there was nothing for the poor man to do with Sylvia.  I hope you won't mind very much, for I have promised to take care of her.\"  \"Sylvia!\" The three voices made a dismal chorus.  \"That stupid, ill-mannered child!  I am sorry, dear, but you are not going to look after anything or anybody this summer but yourself.  You see you are sailing for Ireland in a few weeks and we are going to live in the woods and be taken care of by our old mother earth and our father, the sun,\" Polly replied dramatically.  \"You are talking nonsense, Polly; please don't be tiresome any more to-night,\" Mrs. O'Neill urged, lying down on the sofa again, as though she were too weary to be up another minute.  \"I can't discuss the matter with you, but Mr. Wharton has been too kind for me to refuse him this request.\"  Betty found her blue cloak again and softly slipped over to kiss the older woman good-night.  \"Don't worry, what Polly told you is true, but Sylvia shall be looked after just the same.\"  She slipped away, Polly following to watch her safely across the street as she always did.

The stars were shining and the warmth the day had failed to bring to the earth had been followed by some unseen messenger of the night.  \"You are going to include that hateful child in your Camp Fire Club after what I said to you, Betty?\" Polly whispered.  \"Oh, if only her name wasn't Sylvia and she didn't have a snub nose and wear goggles I could forgive her.  But think how absurd the combination is!  Anyhow you are a dear, and it must be because I am Irish that I am always in the wrong.\"     CHAPTER IV  \"MEG\"   Thump, thump, thump came the sound of a heavy object rolling slowly step by step down a long stairway and then after an interval of ten seconds a prolonged, ear-piercing roar.  Immediately a girl darted out of a room on the second floor of a pretty brick house, colliding with a young man several years older, who came forth at the same time from his own room across the hall.  \"Great Scott, Meg, what are you doing only half-dressed at this hour of the day?\" he demanded with brotherly contempt.  \"We will discuss my costume or lack of it later,\" she returned, holding her short flannel dressing sacque together and laughing over her shoulder where one long blond plait hung neatly braided, the rest of her hair falling loose.  \"Methinks that was Horace Virgil Everett trying to break up the furniture somewhere!  Was there ever such an infant born into this suffering world?  I simply never turn my back without his getting into fresh trouble.\"  While she was talking she was also running downstairs, followed in a more leisurely manner by her brother.  Both of them glanced into the empty library and untidy dining-room as they passed and finally arrived in a dark passageway at the end of the back stairs.  A small object lay on the floor with its arms and legs outspread, showing not the slightest inclination to pick itself up, and on Meg's bending over it the wails broke out afresh.  \"Oh, do shut up, 'Bumps',\" Jack Everett said good-naturedly.  \"You haven't killed yourself and you're much too big for Meg to carry.\"  But the small boy clung desperately to his sister, his fat arms about her neck and his legs about her waist until with difficulty she was able to get him upstairs and into her own room.  He was probably about three feet high and almost as broad, between three and four years old, with brown hair that would stand up in a pompadour simply because it was too stiff to lie down, a perfectly insignificant nose, a Cupid's bow of a mouth and two large grave blue eyes, as innocent of mischief as any lamb's.  At the present moment, however, his eyes were simply raining tears, as though they had their source in a cloudburst, and over one of them a bump appeared as large as an egg.  Indeed, Horace Virgil, named for his Professor father's favorite Latin poets, had been rechristened 'Bumps' by his older brother and was more commonly known by that title.  Meg kept glancing at the clock as she dampened her small brother's forehead with witch hazel.  \"I am afraid I can't go,\" she said in a disappointed tone, \"and I am dreadfully sorry because I promised.  But if I leave Horace with the servants now he will howl himself ill.  I don't suppose you were going to stay in for a few hours.  Oh, of course not!\" she concluded, seeing that her older brother was wearing his khaki service uniform and held a big, broad-brimmed hat in his hand.  \"Heigh-ho, don't I wish I were a boy,\" she sighed whimsically, turning at last toward her mirror, decorated with college flags, and beginning to braid the second half of her hair.  John Everett, frowned and fidgeted.  \"I am sorry, Meg,\" he replied after a moment.  \"I would stay at home, only there is a meeting of my brigade and when a fellow belongs to a thing why he owes it some of his time.  I don't see why you have to stay at home so much.  Of course it is a good deal for a girl to have to look after, a house and father and the kid and me, but you have two maids and if you only were a better manager. Why you don't seem even to take time to dress like other girls, you are always kind of flying apart with a button off your waist or the braid torn on your skirt, and I do love a spick and span girl.  Why don't you look like Betty Ashton, she's always up to the limit?\"  Margaret Everett coiled her yellow plaits about her head, keeping her back turned to hide the trembling of her lips until she was able to answer cheerfully.  \"Why yes, I should like to look like 'The Princess' and wear clothes like she does, but in the first place I am not so good looking as Betty, I haven't a maid to see after my clothes and fifty dollars a month to dress on--and I haven't a mother.\"  Jack Everett flushed.  He was a splendid looking fellow, big and brown, with light hair of almost the same coppery tones as his sister's, and although but eighteen was nearly six feet tall.  It was his last year at the Male High School of which his father was President, and already he had passed with high honors his entrance examinations for Dartmouth College.  \"Oh, I say, Meg, don't pile it on,\" he protested.  \"You are handsome enough all right, and it was only on your own account that I was wishing you could run things better.\"  Meg had evidently given up the idea of her engagement by this time, for she had seated herself in a big chair with her small brother on her lap and was rocking him slowly back and forth, his head resting on her shoulder.  \"You are right, Jack, I am not offended,\" she answered.  \"I know I am a poor manager, but somehow I don't just take to housekeeping and mothering naturally.  Men always think girls know such things by instinct.  They don't understand that we have to learn them just as boys learn bookkeeping or office work and I have never had any one to teach me.\"  \"The late Miss Everett,\" a new voice called unexpectedly, apparently coming from about midway up the front steps.  \"Meg, may I come on upstairs, the front door was half open and I knew full well that you would never keep your promise to me unless I came and got you.\"  Meg put down her small burden hastily and John unconsciously stiffened his broad shoulders until his appearance was more than ever military.  \"Come on up, Betty dear, I am sorry I am such a sight, but the baby has just gotten hurt and I have to give up the club meeting,\" Meg called back.  The next instant Betty Ashton appeared at the open bedroom door, wearing a light woolen motor coat, a blue hat with a red-brown wing in it fitting close over her hair which was tucked up out of sight in a very grown-up fashion.  She had a great deal of color and her eyes were bright with desire.  \"Oh, you can't disappoint me, Meg; I shall never forgive you,\" she protested, and then came to a sudden stop seeing that John Everett was also in her friend's room.  But as he bowed low to her it was impossible for him to have observed her slight blush.  \"Do take Meg with you by force, Miss Ashton,\" he urged.  (It was always quite thrilling to Betty at fifteen to be called \"Miss Ashton,\" and no other boy of her acquaintance seemed to realize that one could grow out of being addressed as \"Betty\".)  \"She spoils the small boy and all the rest of us far too much.  'Bumps' has just taken another tumble.\"  Jack Everett then backed out of the room in soldierly fashion and at the instant of his disappearance Betty tucked her arms about the small Horace, critically surveying his injured eye.  \"Do hurry and get dressed, Meg, that's a dear.  You know we simply can't get on without you this afternoon.  I will button you up in a jiffy and we can take this bumptious little person along with us.  He will probably escape and fall down somewhere while we are having our meeting, but we can both keep our eyes on him.\"  \"He would be too much trouble,\" Meg demurred, but already she was surveying her only clean shirt waists, a blue and a white one, to see which was in the better state of repair.  The blue was faded but whole, so she slipped into it, letting Betty button it up the back, and then with her brother's words still rankling in her mind carefully adjusted her skirt at, the belt. \"You are awfully good to let me come this afternoon, Betty, because I told you it would be just impossible for me to spend the summer with you girls as it would be for me to take a trip to the moon.  John is going camping and father is to have a summer lecture course in Boston and--\"  \"Oh yes, and you are to stay at home and take care of this house and baby! I don't think it is fair, or that your father or brother in the least realize what you do for them.  But see here, dear, if what I thinks is true, as my old nurse used to say, and you come to be a Camp Fire girl this summer, why you will learn an awful lot about keeping house and being first aid to broken babies and everything you need to know.  Never mind, don't let's argue about the question now, just come along, for the motor is waiting at the gate.  Nearly all the girls I have asked must be at home by this time, but I have to collect two more people, Martha McMurtry--you know how I love her--and yet she carries the information in her brain of the right way to organize a Camp Fire club.  Also there is Eleanor Meade; being a genius, you know Eleanor can't be expected to remember anything, should a wave of inspiration happen to flow over her.\"     CHAPTER V  THEIR FIRST MEETING   The drawing-room at the Ashton homestead ran the whole length of one side of the house and on this particular May afternoon was so filled with sunshine and light that even the old portraits on the walls appeared to change their severe Puritanical expressions and to look down, from out their heavy gold frames, with something almost approaching friendliness, on the strange girl now alone in the room, although nothing in her appearance or manner suggested the birth and breeding partly responsible for their New England pride.
