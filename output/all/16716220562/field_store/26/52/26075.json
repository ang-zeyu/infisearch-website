FRUIT SALAD, ICED  Make one quart of lemon or orange water ice and stand it aside for at least one or two hours to ripen. Make a fruit salad from stemmed strawberries, sliced bananas cut into tiny bits, a few very ripe cherries, a grated pineapple if you have it, and the pulp of four or five oranges. After the water ice is frozen rather hard, pack it in a border mold, put on the lid or cover and bind the seam with a strip of muslin dipped in paraffin or suet, and repack to freeze for three or four hours. Sweeten the fruit combination, if you like, add a tablespoonful or two of brandy and sherry, and stand this on the ice until _very cold_. At serving time, turn the mold of water ice on to a round compote dish, quickly fill the centre with fruit salad, garnish the outside with fresh roses or violets, and send at once to the table.  This will serve eight or ten persons at luncheon.   COUPE ST. JACQUE  Make a fruit salad as in preceding recipe. Make a pint of orange or strawberry ice. At serving time fill parfait or ice cream glasses half full of the fruit salad, fill the remaining half with water ice, smooth it over, garnish the top with whipped cream, put a maraschino cherry in the centre, and serve. Other fruits may be used for the salad.  This should make twelve tumblers.     WATER ICES AND SHERBETS OR SORBETS   A water ice is a mixture of water, fruit and sugar, frozen without much stirring; in fact, a water ice can be made in an ordinary tin kettle packed in a bucket. If an ice cream freezer is used, the stirring should be done occasionally. Personally, I prefer to pack the can, put on the lid and fasten the hole with a cork rather than to use the dasher, stirring now and then with a paddle. If you use the crank, turn slowly for a few minutes, then allow the mixture to stand for five minutes; turn slowly again, and again rest, and continue this until the water ice is frozen. A much longer time is required for freezing water ice than ice cream.  When the mixture is thoroughly frozen, take out the dasher, scrape down the sides of the can, give the ice a thorough beating with a wooden spoon; put the cork in the lid of the can, draw the water from the tub, repack it with coarse ice and salt, cover it with paper and a piece of blanket or burlap, and stand aside for two or three hours to ripen just as you would ice cream.  When it is necessary to make water ice every day or two, it is best to make a syrup and stand it aside ready for use.  Fruit jellies may be used in the place of fresh fruits, allowing one pint of jelly, the juice of one lemon and a half pound of sugar to each quart of water.  When water ice is correctly frozen, it has the appearance of hard wet snow. It must not be frothy nor light.  A sherbet or sorbet is made from the same mixture as a water ice, stirred constantly while it is freezing, and has a meringue, made from the white of one egg and a tablespoonful of powdered sugar, stirred in after the dasher is removed.   APPLE ICE       1 pound of tart apples      1 cupful of sugar      1 pint of water        Juice of one lemon or lime  Quarter and core the apples, but do not pare them. Slice them, add the water, cover and stew until tender, about five minutes. Press through a sieve, add the sugar and lemon juice. When cold, freeze as directed. Serve in lemonade glasses at dinner with roasted duck, goose or pork.  This will serve six persons.   APRICOT ICE       1 quart can of apricots    1/2 cupful of sugar      1 pint of water        Juice of one lemon  Press the apricots through a sieve, add all the other ingredients, and serve. This is nice served in lemonade glasses for afternoon tea. Pass sweet wafers.  This will serve eight persons.

Boil the sugar and water together for five minutes, and add the lemon juice and ground ginger. Take from the fire, add the bits of ginger, and, when cold, freeze as directed.

If fresh tomatoes are used, simply cut them into halves and cook them without peeling.  This will fill nine or ten punch glasses.     FROZEN FRUITS   Frozen fruits are mixed and frozen the same as water ices, that is, they are only stirred occasionally while freezing, but the fruit must be mashed or it will form little balls of ice through a partly frozen mixture. The only difference between a water ice and a frozen fruit is that the mixture is not strained, and more fruit and less water is used. If canned fruits are used, and these recipes followed, cut down the sugar. Cream may be used in place of water with sub-acid fruits.   FROZEN APRICOTS       1 quart of apricots      2 tablespoonfuls of gelatin      1 cupful of sugar      1 pint of cream  Drain the apricots from the can, mash them through a colander, add the sugar and stir until the sugar is dissolved.
