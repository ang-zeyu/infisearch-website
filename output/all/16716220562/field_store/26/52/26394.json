(_p_.)                                      Hark!    (_sl_.) Along the vales and mountains of the earth    ([o])   There is a deep, portentous murmuring,    (=)     Like the swift rush of subterranean streams,            Or like the mingled sounds of earth and air,            When the fierce tempest, with sonorous wing,            Heaves his deep folds upon the rushing winds,    (<)     And hurries onward, with his night of clouds,            Against the eternal mountains. 'Tis the voice            Of infant FREEDOM,--and her stirring call            Is heard and answered in a thousand tones    (<)     From every hill-top of her western home;            And lo! it breaks across old Ocean's flood,--    (oo)    And \"FREEDOM! FREEDOM!\" is the answering shout            Of nations, starting from the spell of years. G.D. PRENTICE.      (<)                      The thunders hushed,--            The trembling lightning fled away in fear,--    (_p._)  The foam-capt surges sunk to quiet rest,--            The raging winds grew still,--    (_pp_.)                  There was a calm.    (o,o,)  \"Quick! Man the boat!\" (=) Away they spring              The stranger ship to aid,    (_f_.)  And loud their hailing voices ring,              As rapid speed they made.      (p) Hush! lightly tread! still tranquilly she sleeps;        I've watched, suspending e'en my breath, in fear        To break the heavenly spell. (_pp_.) Move silently.                                      Can it be?        Matter immortal? and shall spirit die?        Above the nobler, shall less nobler rise?    (<) Shall man alone, for whom all else revives,        No resurrection know? (o<) Shall man alone,        Imperial man! be sown in barren ground,        Less privileged than grain, on which he feeds? YOUNG.

An hour passed on;--the Turk awoke;--              That bright dream was his last;--            He woke--to hear his sentry's shriek,    (oo)    \"To ARMS! they come! (_ff_.) THE GREEK! THE GREEK!\"    (_pl_.) He woke to die, midst flame and smoke,            And shout, and groan, and sabre stroke,              And death shots falling thick and fast            As lightnings from the mountain cloud;            And heard, with voice as trumpet loud,              Bozzaris cheer his band;--    (oo)    \"_Strike_--till the last armed foe expires!            _Strike_--for your altars and your fires!            _Strike_--for the green graves of your sires!

(_p_.)  Low, murmuring sounds along their banners fly,    (_ff_.) REVENGE, or DEATH!--the watchword and reply;    (oo)    Then pealed the notes, omnipotent to charm,    (_f_.)  And the loud tocsin tolled their last alarm! CAMPBELL.      ([o]')  His  speech was at first low toned and slow. Sometimes    his  voice  would  deepen,  ([oo])  like  the sound of distant    thunder;  and  anon,  (_''_) his flashes of wit and enthusiasm    would  light up the anxious faces of his hearers, (<) like the    far-off lightning of a coming storm.

Over the walls of majesty,              \"Upharsin\" is writ in words of fire,            And the eyes of the bondmen, wherever they be,              Are lit with their wild desire.    (<)     Soon, soon shall the thrones that blot the world,            Like the Orleans, into the dust be hurl'd,            And the world roll on, like a hurricane's breath,            Till the farthest nation hears what it saith.--    (_ff_.)         \"ARISE!

RHETORICAL PAUSES are those which are frequently required by the voice in reading and speaking, although the construction of the passage admits of no grammatical point.  These pauses should be as manifest to the ear, as those which are indicated by the comma, semicolon, or other grammatical points, though not commonly denoted by any visible sign. In the following examples they are denoted thus, (||).  EXAMPLES.  1.   In slumbers of midnight || the sailor-boy lay,     His hammock swung loose || at the sport of the wind;   But watch-worn and weary, || his cares flew away,     And visions of happiness || danced o'er his mind. DIMOND.  2.   There is a land, || of every land the pride,   Beloved of heaven || o'er all the world beside;   Where brighter suns || dispense serener light,   And milder moons || imparadise the night.   O, thou shalt find, || howe'er thy footsteps roam,   That land thy country, || and that spot thy home!  This pause is generally made before or after the utterance of some important word or clause on which it is especially desired to fix the attention. In such cases it is usually denoted by the use of the dash (--).  EXAMPLES.  1. God said--\"_Let there be light!_\"  2.   All dead and silent was the earth,     In deepest night it lay;   The Eternal spoke creation's word,     And called to being--Day!  No definite rule can be given with reference to the length of the rhetorical, or grammatical pause. The correct taste of the reader or speaker must determine it. For the voice should sometimes be suspended much longer at the same pause in one situation than in another; as in the two following  EXAMPLES.  LONG PAUSE.  Pause a moment. I heard a footstep. Listen now. I heard it again; but it is going from us. It sounds fainter,--still fainter. It is gone.  SHORT PAUSE.  John, be quick. Get some water. Throw the powder overboard. \"It can not be reached.\" Jump into the boat, then. Shove off. There goes the powder. Thank Heaven. We are safe.         *       *       *       *       *  REMARKS TO TEACHERS.  It is of the utmost importance, in order to secure an easy and elegant style in reading, to refer the pupil often to the more important principles involved in a just elocution. To this end, it will be found very advantageous, occasionally to review the rules and directions given in the preceding pages, and thus early accustom him to apply them in the subsequent reading lessons. For a wider range of examples and illustrations, it is only necessary to refer to the numerous and various exercises which form the body of this book. They have been selected, in many cases, with a special view to this object.       PART SECOND.   LESSON I.     HER' O ISM, bravery; courage.    MA LI'' CIOUS, ill disposed; resentful.

I shall never forget a lesson which I received when quite a young lad, while attending an Academy. Among my schoolmates were Hartly and Vincent. They were both older than myself, and Vincent was looked up to, as a sort of leader in matters of opinion, and in directing our sports.  2. He was not, at heart, a malicious boy; but he had a foolish ambition of being thought witty and sarcastic; and he made himself feared by a habit of turning things into ridicule. He seemed to be constantly looking out for something to occur, which he could turn into derision.  3. Hartly was a new scholar, and little was known of him among the boys. One morning as we were on our way to school, he was seen driving a cow along the road toward the pasture. A group of boys, among whom was Vincent, met him as he was passing.  4. \"Now,\" said Vincent, \"let us have a little sport with our country rustic.\" So saying, he exclaimed: \"Halloo, Jonathan! [Footnote: A title frequently applied to the Yankees by the English.] what is the price of milk? What do you feed her on? What will you take for all the gold on her horns? Boys, if you want to see the latest Paris style, look at those boots!\"  5. Hartly waved his hand at us with a pleasant smile, and, driving the cow to the field, took down the bars of a rail-fence, saw her safely in the pasture, and then, putting up the bars, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9078"],["title","Sanders' Union Fourth Reader (#8)"],["body","and entered the school with the rest of us. After school, in the afternoon, he let out the cow, and drove her away, none of us knew where. Every day, for two or three weeks, he went through the same task.  6. The boys who attended the Academy, were nearly all the sons of wealthy parents, and some of them were foolish enough to look down, with a sort of disdain, upon a scholar who had to drive a cow to pasture; and the sneers and jeers of Vincent were often repeated.  7. One day, he refused to sit next to Hartly in school, on a pretense that he did not like the odor of the barn. Sometimes he would inquire of Hartly after the cow's health, pronouncing the word \"ke-ow,\" after the manner of some people.  8. Hartly bore all these silly attempts to wound his feelings and annoy him, with the utmost good nature. He never once returned an angry look or word. One time, Vincent said: \"Hartly, I suppose your father intends to make a milkman of you.\"  9. \"Why not?\" said Hartly. \"Oh, nothing,\" said Vincent; \"only do not leave much water in the cans after rinsing them--that's all!\" The boys laughed, and Hartly, not in the least mortified, replied: \"Never fear; if I ever rise to be a milkman, I will give _good measure_ and _good milk_ too.\"  10. A few days after this conversation, there was a public exhibition, at which a number of ladies and gentlemen from the city, was present. Prizes were awarded by the Principal of the Academy, and Hartly and Vincent each received one; for, in respect to scholarship, they were about equal.  11. After the prizes were distributed, the Principal remarked that there was _one prize_, consisting of a medal, which was _rarely_ awarded, not so much on account of its great value, as because the instances are _rare_ that merit it. It is THE PRIZE FOR HEROISM. The last boy on whom it was conferred, was Master Manners, who, three years ago, rescued the blind girl from drowning.  12. The Principal then said, \"With the permission of the company, I will relate a short story. Not long since, some boys were flying a kite in the street, just as a poor boy on horseback rode by, on his way to mill. The horse took fright, and threw the boy, injuring him so badly that he was carried home, and confined for some weeks to his bed.  13. \"None of the boys who had caused the disaster, followed to learn the fate of the wounded boy. There was one, however, who witnessed the accident from a distance, and went to render what service he could. He soon learned that the wounded boy was the grandson of a poor widow, whose only support consisted in selling the milk of a fine cow, of which she was the owner.  14. \"Alas! what could she now do? She was old and lame, and her grandson, on whom she depended to drive the cow to pasture, was now sick and helpless. 'Never mind, good woman,' said the boy, 'I can drive your cow.' With thanks, the poor widow accepted his offer.  15. \"But the boy's kindness did not stop here. Money was wanted to purchase medicine. 'I have money that my mother sent me to buy a pair of boots,' said the boy; 'but I can do without them for the present.'  16. \"'Oh, no!' said the old lady, 'I can not consent to that; but here is a pair of cowhide boots that I bought for Henry, who can not wear them. If you will buy them, giving me what they cost, I can get along very well.' The boy bought the boots, clumsy as they were, and has worn them up to this time.  17. \"When the other boys of the Academy saw this scholar driving a cow to the pasture, he was assailed with laughter and ridicule. His thick cowhide boots, in particular, were made matters of mirth. But he kept on cheerfully and bravely, day after day, driving the widow's cow to the pasture, and wearing his thick boots, contented in the thought that he was _doing right_, not caring for all the jeers and sneers that could be uttered.  18. \"He never undertook to explain why he drove the cow; for he was not inclined to display his charitable motives, and besides, in heart, he had no sympathy with the false pride that looks with ridicule on any useful employment. It was by _mere accident_ that his course of conduct and self-denial, was yesterday discovered by his teacher.  19. \"And now, ladies and gentlemen, I appeal to you. Was there not _true heroism_ in this boy's conduct? Nay, Master Hartly, do not steal out of sight behind the blackboard! You were not ashamed of _ridicule_--you must not shun _praise. Come forth, come forth, Master Edward James Hartly, and let us see your honest face!_\"  20. As Hartly, with blushing cheeks, made his appearance, the whole company greeted him with a round of applause for his _heroic conduct_. The ladies stood upon benches, and waved their handkerchiefs. The old men clapped their hands, and wiped the moisture from the corners of their eyes. Those clumsy boots on Hartly's feet seemed prouder ornaments, than a crown would have been on his head. The medal was bestowed on him, amid the applause of the whole company.  21. Vincent was heartily ashamed of his ill-natured sneers, and, after the school was dismissed, he went, with tears in his eyes, and tendered his hand to Hartly, making a handsome apology for his past ill manners. \"Think no more about it,\" said Hartly; \"let us all go and have a ramble in the woods, before we break up for vacation.\" The boys, one and all, followed Vincent's example, and then, with shouts and huzzas, they all set forth into the woods--a happy, cheerful group.  QUESTIONS.--1. In what way did Vincent try to make derision of Hartly? 2. How did Hartly receive it? 3. For what did Hartly receive a prize from his teacher? 4. How did the spectators manifest their approbation of Hartly's conduct?         *       *       *       *       *  LESSON II.     A VERT' ED, turned aside.    RE PENT' ANT, contrite; sorrowful.

For his daily cares?    Who would pass him in the foot-way      With averted eye?    Would you, brother'? No`,--you _would_ not.      If _you_ would,--not _I_.  2. Who, when vice or crime repentant,      With a grief sincere,    Asked for pardon, would refuse it,      More than heaven severe?    Who, to erring woman's sorrow,       Would with taunts reply?    Would _you_, brother'! No`,--you _would_ not.       If _you_ would,--not _I_.  3. Would you say that Vice is Virtue       In a hall of state'?    Or, that rogues are not dishonest       If they dine off plate'?    Who would say Success and Merit       Ne'er part company?    Would _you_, brother'? No`,--you _would_ not.       If _you_ would,--not _I_.  4. Who would give a cause his efforts       When the cause is strong;    But desert it on its failure,       Whether right or wrong`?    Ever siding with the upmost,       Letting downmost lie?    Would _you_, brother'? No`,--you _would_ not.       If _you_ would,--not _I_.  5. Who would lend his arm to strengthen       Warfare with the right`?    Who would give his pen to blacken       Freedom's page of light`?    Who would lend his tongue to utter       Praise of tyranny?    Would _you_, brother'? No`,--you _would_ not.       If _you_ would,--not _I_.  QUESTIONS.--1.

Look not to another       To perform your will;    Let not your own brother       Keep your warm hand still.  2. _Life is onward:_ never       Look upon the past;    It would hold you ever       In its clutches fast.    _Now_ is your dominion;       Weave it as you please;    Bid not the soul's pinion       To a bed of ease.  3. _Life is onward:_ try it,       Ere the day is lost;    It hath virtue: buy it,       At whatever cost.    If the World should offer       Every precious gem,    Look not at the scoffer,       Change it not for them.  4. _Life is onward:_ heed it,     In each varied dress;   Your own _act_ can speed it     On to happiness.   His bright pinion o'er you     Time waves not in vain,   If Hope chant before you     Her prophetic strain.  5. _Life is onward:_ prize it,     In sunshine and in storm;   Oh! do not despise it     In its humblest form.   Hope and Joy together,     Standing at the goal,   Through life's darkest weather     Beckon on the soul.  QUESTIONS.--1. What do _it_ and _them_ refer to, third verse, last line? 2.
