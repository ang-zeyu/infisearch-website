But never mind. It is nearly over now. I have come down to this quiet water in the early morning to throw myself in. They will find me floating here among the lilies. Some few will understand. I can see it written, as it will be, in the newspapers.  “What makes the sad fatality doubly poignant is that the unhappy victim had just entered upon a holiday visit that was to have been prolonged throughout the whole month. Needless to say, he was regarded as the life and soul of the pleasant party of holiday makers that had gathered at the delightful country home of Mr. and Mrs. Beverly-Jones. Indeed, on the very day of the tragedy, he was to have taken a leading part in staging a merry performance of charades and parlour entertainments--a thing for which his genial talents and overflowing high spirits rendered him specially fit.”  When they read that, those who know me best will understand how and why I died. “He had still over three weeks to stay there,” they will say. “He was to act as the stage manager of charades.” They will shake their heads. They will understand.  But what is this? I raise my eyes from the paper and I see Beverly-Jones hurriedly approaching from the house. He is hastily dressed, with flannel trousers and a dressing-gown. His face looks grave. Something has happened. Thank God, something has happened. Some accident! Some tragedy! Something to prevent the charades!  I write these few lines on a fast train that is carrying me back to New York, a cool, comfortable train, with a deserted club-car where I can sit in a leather arm-chair, with my feet up on another, smoking, silent, and at peace.  Villages, farms and summer places are flying by. Let them fly. I, too, am flying--back to the rest and quiet of the city.  “Old man,” Beverly-Jones said, as he laid his hand on mine very kindly--he is a decent fellow, after all, is Jones--“they’re calling you by long-distance from New York.”  “What is it?” I asked, or tried to gasp.  “It’s bad news, old chap; fire in your office last evening. I’m afraid a lot of your private papers were burned. Robinson--that’s your senior clerk, isn’t it?--seems to have been on the spot trying to save things. He’s badly singed about the face and hands. I’m afraid you must go at once.”  “Yes, yes,” I said, “at once.”  “I know. I’ve told the man to get the trap ready right away. You’ve just time to catch the seven-ten. Come along.”  “Right,” I said. I kept my face as well as I could, trying to hide my exultation. The office burnt! Fine! Robinson’s singed! Glorious! I hurriedly packed my things and whispered to Beverly-Jones farewell messages for the sleeping household. I never felt so jolly and facetious in my life. I could feel that Beverly-Jones was admiring the spirit and pluck with which I took my misfortune. Later on he would tell them all about it.  The trap ready! Hurrah! Good-bye, old man! Hurrah! All right. I’ll telegraph. Right you are, good-bye. Hip, hip, hurrah! Here we are! Train right on time. Just these two bags, porter, and there’s a dollar for you. What merry, merry fellows these darky porters are, anyway!  And so here I am in the train, safe bound for home and the summer quiet of my club.  Well done for Robinson! I was afraid that it had missed fire, or that my message to him had gone wrong. It was on the second day of my visit that I sent word to him to invent an accident--something, anything--to call me back. I thought the message had failed. I had lost hope. But it is all right now, though he certainly pitched the note pretty high.  Of course I can’t let the Beverly-Joneses know that it was a put-up job. I must set fire to the office as soon as I get back. But it’s worth it. And I’ll have to singe Robinson about the face and hands. But it’s worth that too!     VI. To Nature and Back Again  It was probably owing to the fact that my place of lodgment in New York overlooked the waving trees of Central Park that I was consumed, all the summer through, with a great longing for the woods. To me, as a lover of Nature, the waving of a tree conveys thoughts which are never conveyed to me except by seeing a tree wave.  This longing grew upon me. I became restless with it. In the daytime I dreamed over my work. At night my sleep was broken and restless. At times I would even wander forth, at night into the park, and there, deep in the night shadow of the trees, imagine myself alone in the recesses of the dark woods remote from the toil and fret of our distracted civilization.  This increasing feeling culminated in the resolve which becomes the subject of this narrative. The thought came to me suddenly one night. I woke from my sleep with a plan fully matured in my mind. It was this: I would, for one month, cast off all the travail and cares of civilized life and become again the wild man of the woods that Nature made me. M  woods, somewhere in New England, divest myself of my clothes--except only my union suit--crawl into the woods, stay there a month and then crawl out again. To a trained woodsman and crawler like myself the thing was simplicity itself. For food I knew that I could rely on berries, roots, shoots, mosses, mushrooms, fungi, bungi--in fact the whole of Nature’s ample storehouse; for my drink, the running brook and the quiet pool; and for my companions the twittering chipmunk, the chickadee, the chocktaw, the choo-choo, the chow-chow, and the hundred and one inhabitants of the forgotten glade and the tangled thicket.  Fortunately for me, my resolve came to me upon the last day in August. The month of September was my vacation. My time was my own. I was free to go.  On my rising in the morning my preparations were soon made; or, rather, there were practically no preparations to make. I had but to supply myself with a camera, my one necessity in the woods, and to say good-bye to my friends. Even this last ordeal I wished to make as brief as possible. I had no wish to arouse their anxiety over the dangerous, perhaps foolhardy, project that I had in mind. I wished, as far as possible, to say good-bye in such a way as to allay the very natural fears which my undertaking would excite in the minds of my friends.  From myself, although trained in the craft of the woods, I could not conceal the danger that I incurred. Yet the danger was almost forgotten in the extraordinary and novel interest that attached to the experiment. Would it prove possible for a man, unaided by our civilized arts and industries, to maintain himself naked--except for his union suit--in the heart of the woods? Could he do it, or could he not? And if he couldn’t what then?  But this last thought I put from me. Time alone could answer the question.  As in duty bound, I went first to the place of business where I am employed, to shake hands and say good-bye to my employer.  “I am going,” I said, “to spend a month naked alone in the woods.”  He looked up from his desk with genial kindliness.  “That’s right,” he said, “get a good rest.”  “My plan is,” I added, “to live on berries and funguses.”  “Fine,” he answered. “Well, have a good time, old man--good-bye.”  Then I dropped in casually upon one of my friends.  “Well,” I said, “I’m off to New England to spend a month naked.”  “Nantucket,” he said, “or Newport?”  “No,” I answered, speaking as lightly as I could. “I’m going into the woods and stay there naked for a month.”  “Oh, yes,” he said. “I see. Well, good-bye, old chap--see you when you get back.”  After that I called upon two or three other men to say a brief word of farewell. I could not help feeling slightly nettled, I must confess, at the very casual way in which they seemed to take my announcement. “Oh, yes,” they said, “naked in the woods, eh? Well, ta-ta till you get back.”  Here was a man about to risk his life--for there was no denying the fact--in a great sociological experiment, yet they received the announcement with absolute unconcern. It offered one more assurance, had I needed it, of the degenerate state of the civilization upon which I was turning my back.  On my way to the train I happened to run into a newspaper reporter with whom I have some acquaintance.  “I’m just off,” I said, “to New England to spend a month naked--at least naked all but my union suit--in the woods; no doubt you’ll like a few details about it for your paper.”  “Thanks, old man,” he said, “we’ve pretty well given up running that nature stuff. We couldn’t do anything with it--unless, of course, anything happens to you. Then we’d be glad to give you some space.”  Several of my friends had at least the decency to see me off on the train. One, and one alone accompanied me on the long night-ride to New England in order that he might bring back my clothes, my watch, and other possessions from the point where I should enter the woods, together with such few messages of farewell as I might scribble at the last moment.  It was early morning when we arrived at the wayside station where we were to alight. From here we walked to the edge of the woods. Arrived at this point we halted. I took off my clothes, with the exception of my union suit. Then, taking a pot of brown stain from my valise, I proceeded to dye my face and hands and my union suit itself a deep butternut brown.  “What’s that for?” asked my friend.  “For protection,” I answered. “Don’t you know that all animals are protected by their peculiar markings that render them invisible? The caterpillar looks like the leaf it eats from; the scales of the fish counterfeit the glistening water of the brook; the bear and the ‘possum are coloured like the tree-trunks on which they climb. There!” I added, as I concluded my task. “I am now invisible.”  “Gee!” said my friend.  I handed him back the valise and the empty paint-pot, dropped to my hands and knees--my camera slung about my neck--and proceeded to crawl"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8462"],["title","The Man in Gray: A Romance of North and South (#0)"],["body","[ILLUSTRATION: \"YOU'D LIKE YOUR PAPA TO COME BACK HOME FROM THE WAR?\"]   THE MAN IN GRAY  _A ROMANCE OF NORTH AND SOUTH_  BY  THOMAS DIXON  AUTHOR OF \"THE SOUTHERNER,\" \"THE LEOPARD'S SPOTS,\" \"THE BIRTH OF A NATION,\" \"THE CLANSMAN,\" ETC.

The stars began to twinkle in the serene sky. The lights of Washington flickered across the river. The Capitol building gleamed, argus-eyed on the hill. Congress was in session, still wrangling over the question of Slavery and its extension into the territories of the West.  The laughter of youth and beauty sifted down from open windows. Preparations were being hurried for the ball in honor of the departing cadets--Custis Lee, his classmate, Jeb Stuart, and little Phil Sheridan of Ohio whom they had invited in from Washington.  The fact that the whole family was going to West Point with the boys and Colonel Robert E. Lee, the new Superintendent, made no difference. One excuse for an old-fashioned dance in a Southern home was as good as another. The main thing was to bring friends and neighbors, sisters and cousins and aunts together for an evening of joy.  A whippo'will cried his weird call from a rendezvous in the shadows of the lawn, as Sam entered the great hall and began to light the hundreds of wax tapers in the chandeliers.  \"Move dat furniture back now!\" he cried to his assistants. \"And mind yo' p's and q's. Doan yer break nuttin.\"  His sable helpers quietly removed the slender mahogany and rosewood pieces to the adjoining rooms. They laughed at Sam's new-found note of dignity and authority.  He was acting butler to-night in Uncle Ben's place. No servant was allowed to work when ill--no matter how light the tasks to which he was assigned. Sam was but twenty years old and he had been given the honor of superintending the arrangements for the dance. And, climax of all, he had been made leader of the music with the sole right to call the dances, although he played only the triangle in the orchestra. He was in high fettle.  When the first carriage entered the grounds his keen ear caught the crunch of wheels on the gravel. He hurried to call the mistress and young misses to their places at the door. He also summoned the boys from their rooms upstairs. He had seen the flash of spotless white in the carriage. It meant beauty calling to youth on the hill. Sam knew.  Phil came downstairs with Custis. The spacious sweep of the hall, its waxed floor clear of furniture, with hundreds of blinking candles flashing on its polished surface, caught his imagination. It _was_ a fairy world--this generous Southern home. In spite of its wide spaces, and its dignity, it was friendly. It caught his boy's heart.  Mrs. Lee was just entering. Custis' eyes danced at the sight of his mother in full dress. He grasped Phil's arm and whispered:  \"Isn't my mother the most beautiful woman you ever saw?\"  He spoke the words half to himself. It was the instinctive worship of the true Southern boy, breathed in genuine reverence, with an awe that was the expression of a religion.  \"I was just thinking the same thing, Custis,\" was the sober reply.  \"I beg your pardon, Phil,\" he hastened to apologize. \"I didn't mean to brag about my mother to you. It just slipped out. I couldn't help it. I was talking to myself.\"  \"You needn't apologize. I know how you feel. She's already made me think I'm one of you--\"  He paused and watched Mary Lee enter from the lawn leaning on Stuart's arm. Stuart's boyish banter was still ringing in her ears as she smiled at him indulgently. She hurried to her mother with an easy, graceful step and took her place beside her. She was fine, exquisite, bewitching. She had never come out in Society. She had been born in it. She had her sweethearts before thirteen and not one had left a shadow on her quiet, beautiful face. She demanded, by her right of birth as a Southern girl, years of devotion. And the Southern boy of the old regime was willing to serve.  Phil stood with Stuart and watched Custis kiss a dozen pretty girls as they arrived and call each one cousin.  \"Is it a joke?\" he asked Stuart curiously.  \"What?\"  \"This cousin business.\"  \"Not much. You don't think I'd let him be such a pig if I could help him, do you?\"  \"Are they all kin?\"  \"Yes--\" Stuart laughed. \"Some of it gets pretty thin in the second and third cousin lines. But it's thick enough for him to get a kiss from every one--confound him!\"  The hall was crowding rapidly. The rustle of silk, the flash of pearls and diamonds, the hum of soft drawling voices filled the perfumed air.  Phil's eyes were dazzled with the bevies of the younger set, from sixteen to eighteen, dressed in soft tulle and organdy; slow of speech; their voices low, musical, delicious. He was introduced to so many his head began to swim. To save his soul he couldn't pick out one more entrancing than another. The moment they spied his West Point uniform he was fair game. They made eyes at him. They languished and pretended to be smitten at first sight. Twice he caught himself about to believe one of them. They seemed so sincere, so dreadfully in earnest. And then he caught the faintest twinkle in the corner of a dark eye and blushed to think himself such a fool.  But the sensation of being lionized was delightful. He was in a whirl of foolish joy when he suddenly realized that Stuart had deserted him, slipped through the crowd and found his way to Mary Lee. He threw a quick glance at the pair and one of the four beauties hovering around him began to whisper:  \"Jeb Stuart's just crazy about Mary--\"  \"Did you ever see anything like it!\"  \"He couldn't stop even to say how-d'y-do.\"  \"And she's utterly indifferent--\"  Sam's voice suddenly rang out with unusual unction and deliberation. He was imitating Uncle Ben's most eloquent methods.  \"Congress-man and Mrs. Rog-er A. Pry-or!\"  Mrs. Lee hastened to greet the young editor who had taken high rank in Congress from the day of his entrance.  Mrs. Pryor was evidently as proud of her young Congressman as he was of her regal beauty.  Colonel Lee joined the group and led the lawmaker into the library for a chat on politics.  The first notes of a violin swept the crowd. The hum of conversation and the ripple of laughter softened into silence. The dusky orchestra is in place on the little platform. Sam, in all his glory, rises and faces the eager youth.  He was dressed in his young master's last year's suit, immaculate blue broadcloth and brass buttons, ruffled shirt and black-braided watch guard hanging from his neck. His eyes sparkled with pride and his rich, sonorous voice rang over the crowd like the deep notes of a flute:  \"Choose yo' pardners fur de fust cowtillun!\"  Again the quick rustle of silk and tulle, the low hum of excited, young voices and the couples are in place.  A boy cries to the leader:  \"We're all ready, Sam.\"  The young caller of the set knew his business better. He lifted his hand in a gesture of reverence and silence, as he glanced toward the library door.  \"Jes' a minute la-dees, an' gem-mens,\" he softly drawled. \"Marse Robert E. Lee and Missis will lead dis set!\"  The Colonel briskly entered from the library with his wife on his arm. A ripple of applause swept the room as they took their places with the gay youngsters.  Sam lifted his hand; the music began--sweet and low, vibrating with the sensuous touch of the negro slave whose soul was free in its joyous melody.  At the first note of his triangle, loud above the music rang Sam's voice:  \"Honors to yo' pardners!\"  With graceful courtesies and stately bows the dance began. And over all a glad negro called the numbers:  \"Forward Fours!\"  The caller's eyes rolled and his body swayed with the rhythm of the dance as he watched each set with growing pride. They danced a quadrille, a mazurka, another quadrille, a schottische, the lancers, another quadrille, and another and another. They paused for supper at midnight and then danced them over again.  While the fine young forms swayed to exquisite rhythm and the music floated over all, the earnest young Congressman bent close to his host in a corner of the library.  \"I sincerely hope, Colonel Lee, that you can see your way clear to make a reply to this book of Mrs. Stowe which Ruffin has sent you.\"  \"I can't see it yet, Mr. Pryor--\"  \"Ruffin is a terrible old fire-eater, I know,\" the Congressman admitted. \"But _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ is the most serious blow the"]]]
