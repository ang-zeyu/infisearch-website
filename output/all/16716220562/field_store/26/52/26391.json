THE LOST ONE'S LAMENT     EXPLANATION OF THE PAUSES.                                   . The Period is the longest pause--a full stop. It marks the end of a sentence, and shows the sense complete; as, The sky is blue`. Pause the time of counting _six_, and let the voice fall.                                   ?  The Interrogation is used at the end of a question; as, Is the sky blue'? If the question can be answered by _yes_ or _no_, the voice rises; if not, it falls; as, Where is your map`;? Pause the time of counting _six_.                                   !  The Exclamation denotes wonder, surprise, pain, or joy; as, O'! what a sweet rose`! Pause the time of counting _one_, after a single word, and let the voice rise; but after a complete sentence, pause the time of counting _six_, and let the voice fall.                                   :  The Colon is a pause shorter than the Period; as, The sky is clear`: the sun shines. Pause the time of counting _four_, and let the voice fall.                                   ;  The Semicolon is a pause shorter than the Colon; as, The rose is fair`; but it soon fades. Pause the time of counting _two_, and let the voice fall. Sometimes the voice should rise, as the sense may require.                                   ,  The Comma is the shortest pause; as, Jane goes to school', and learns to read. Pause the time of counting _one_, and keep the voice up.                                   --  The Dash denotes a sudden pause or change of subject; as, I saw him--but what a sight! When the dash is used after any other pause, the time of that pause is doubled.         *       *       *       *       *  EXPLANATION OF OTHER MARKS.                                   '  The Apostrophe has the form of the comma. It denotes the possessive case; as, John's book; also, that one or more letters have been left out of a word; as, lov'd for loved.                                  \" \"  The Quotation includes a passage that is taken from some other author or speaker; as, John said: \"See my kite.\"                                  ( )  The Parenthesis includes words not properly a part of the main sentence; as, I like these people (who would not?) very much. The words within the parenthesis should be read in a lower tone of voice.                                  [ ]  The Brackets inclose words that serve to explain the preceding word or sentence; as, James [the truthful boy] went home.                                   ^  The Caret shows where words are to be put in that have been omitted by mistake; as, Live ^in peace.                                  (..)  The Diaresis is placed over the latter of two vowels, to show that they belong to two distinct syllables; as, aerial.                                   -  The Hyphen is used to connect compound words; as, Well-doing; or the parts of a word separated at the end of a line.                                 [Index]  The Index points to something special or remarkable; as, => Important News!                            *** .... or ----  The Ellipsis shows that certain words or letters have been purposely omitted; as, K**g, k..g, or k--g, for king.                              [Paragraph]  The Paragraph denotes the beginning of a new subject. It is chiefly used in the Bible; as, [Paragraph] The same day came to him, etc.                               [Section]  The Section is used to divide a book or chapter into parts; as, [Section]45.                      * [Obelisk] [Double Dagger]  The Asterisk, the Obelisk, the Double Dagger, and sometimes other marks, [Footnote: For instance: the Section mark, [Section], and the Parallel, ||.] refer to notes in the margin.

LINE    1 My Young Friends', never tell a falsehood`; but always     2 speak the truth`; this is pleasing to your Maker.     3   Do  you  read  His  holy  word--the  Bible'?

[Obelisk] 1 Kings.       PART FIRST.  ELOCUTION.  Elocution is the art of delivering written or extemporaneous composition with force, propriety, and ease.  It deals, therefore, with words, not only as individuals, but as members of a sentence, and parts of a connected discourse: including every thing necessary to the just expression of the sense. Accordingly, it demands, in a _special_ manner, attention to the following particulars; viz., ARTICULATION, ACCENT, EMPHASIS, INFLECTION, MODULATION, and PAUSES.         *       *       *       *       *  SECTION I.  ARTICULATION.  Articulation is the art of uttering distinctly and justly the letters and syllables constituting a word.  It deals, therefore, with the elements of words, just as elocution deals with the elements of sentences: the one securing the true enunciation of each letter, or combination of letters, the other giving to each word, or combination of words, such a delivery as best expresses the meaning of the author. It is the basis of all good reading, and should be carefully practiced by the learner.    ELEMENTARY SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS.  VOWEL SOUNDS.
