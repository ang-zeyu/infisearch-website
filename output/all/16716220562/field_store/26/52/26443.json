There is no need for me to repeat what I have said in the note to  Prop. xvii.  But, for the sake of my opponents, I will show further, that although it be  granted that will pertains to the essence of God, it nevertheless follows from his perfection,  that things could not have been by him created other than they are, or in a different order;  this is easily proved, if we reflect on what our opponents themselves concede, namely, that  it depends solely on the decree and will of God, that each thing is what it is.  If it were  otherwise, God would not be the cause of all things. Further, that all the decrees of God  have been ratified from all eternity by God himself.  If it were otherwise, God would be convicted of imperfection or change.  But in eternity there is no such thing as when,  before, or after; hence it follows solely from the perfection of God, that God never can  decree, or never would have decreed anything but what is; that God did not exist before  his decrees, and would not exist without them.  But, it is said, supposing that God had  made a different universe, or had ordained other decrees from all eternity concerning  nature and her order, we could not therefore conclude any imperfection in God.  But  persons who say this must admit that God can change his decrees.  For if God had  ordained any decrees concerning nature and her order, different from those which he has ordained--in other words, if he had willed and conceived something different concerning  nature--he would perforce have had a different intellect from that which he has, and also a different will.  But if it were allowable to assign to God a different intellect and a different  will, without any change in his essence or his perfection, what would there be to prevent him changing the decrees which he has made concerning created things, and nevertheless  remaining perfect?  For his intellect and will concerning things created and their order are  the same, in respect to his essence and perfection, however they be conceived.  Further, all the philosophers whom I have read admit that God's intellect is entirely actual,  and not at all potential; as they also admit that God's intellect, and God's will, and God's essence are identical, it follows that, if God had had a different actual intellect and a  different will, his essence would also have been different; and thus, as I concluded at first,  if things had been brought into being by God in a different way from that which has  obtained, God's intellect and will, that is (as is admitted) his essence would perforce have been different, which is absurd.  As these things could not have been brought into being by God in any but the actual way  and order which has obtained; and as the truth of this proposition follows from the  supreme perfection of God; we can have no sound reason for persuading ourselves to believe that God did not wish to create all the things which were in his intellect, and to  create them in the same perfection as he had understood them.  But, it will be said, there is in things no perfection nor imperfection; that which is in them,  and which causes them to be called perfect or imperfect, good or bad, depends solely on  the will of God.  If God had so willed, he might have brought it about that what is now  perfection should be extreme imperfection, and vice versa.  What is such an assertion, but an open declaration that God, who necessarily understands that which he wishes, might  bring it about by his will, that he should understand things differently from the way in  which he does understand them?  This (as we have just shown) is the height of absurdity.  Wherefore, I may turn the argument against its employers, as follows:--All things depend  on the power of God. In order that things should be different from what they are, God's  will would necessarily have to be different.  But God's will cannot be different (as we have  just most clearly demonstrated) from God's perfection.  Therefore neither can things be  different.  I confess, that the theory which subjects all things to the will of an indifferent  deity, and asserts that they are all dependent on his fiat, is less far from the truth than the  theory of those, who maintain that God acts in all things with a view of promoting what is  good.  For these latter persons seem to set up something beyond God, which does not depend on God, but which God in acting looks to as an exemplar, or which he aims at as  a definite goal.  This is only another name for subjecting God to the dominion of destiny,  an utter absurdity in respect to God, whom we have shown to be the first and only free  cause of the essence of all things and also of their existence.  I need, therefore, spend no  time in refuting such wild theories.  XXXIV.  God's power is identical with his essence.  >>>>>Proof--From the sole necessity of the essence of God it follows that God is the  cause of himself (Prop. xi.) and of all things (Prop. xvi. and Cor.).  Wherefore the power  of God, by which he and all things are and act, is identical with his essence.  Q.E.D.  XXXV.  Whatsoever we conceive to be in the power of God, necessarily exists.  >>>>>Proof--Whatsoever is in God's power, must (by the last Prop.) be comprehended  in his essence in such a manner, that it necessarily follows therefrom, and therefore  necessarily exists. Q.E.D.  XXXVI.  There is no cause from whose nature some effect does not follow.  >>>>>Proof--Whatsoever exists expresses God's nature or essence in a given conditioned  manner (by Prop. xxv., Cor.); that is, (by Prop. xxxiv.), whatsoever exists, expresses in a  given conditioned manner God's power, which is the cause of all things, therefore an effect  must (by Prop. xvi.) necessarily follow.  Q.E.D.   APPENDIX:  In the foregoing I have explained the nature and properties of God.  I have shown that he  necessarily exists, that he is one:  that he is, and acts solely by the necessity of his own  nature; that he is the free cause of all things, and how he is so; that all things are in God,  and so depend on him, that without him they could neither exist nor be conceived; lastly, that all things are predetermined by God, not through his free will or absolute fiat, but from  the very nature of God or infinite power.  I have further, where occasion afforded, taken care to remove the prejudices, which might impede the comprehension of my  demonstrations.  Yet there still remain misconceptions not a few, which might and may  prove very grave hindrances to the understanding of the concatenation of things, as I have  explained it above.  I have therefore thought it worth while to bring these misconceptions  before the bar of reason.  All such opinions spring from the notion commonly entertained, that all things in nature act  as men themselves act, namely, with an end in view.  It is accepted as certain, that God himself directs all things to a definite goal (for it is said that God made all things for man,  and man that he might worship him).  I will, therefore, consider this opinion, asking first, why it obtains general credence, and why all men are naturally so prone to adopt it?;   secondly, I will point out its falsity; and, lastly, I will show how it has given rise to  prejudices about good and bad, right and wrong, praise and blame, order and confusion,  beauty and ugliness, and the like.  However, this is not the place to deduce these  misconceptions from the nature of the human mind:  it will be sufficient here, if I assume  as a starting point, what ought to be universally admitted, namely, that all men are born  ignorant of the causes of things, that all have the desire to seek for what is useful to them,  and that they are conscious of such desire.  Herefrom it follows, first, that men think  themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their volitions and desires, and never  even dream, in their ignorance, of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire.  Secondly, that men do all things for an end, namely, for that which is useful to  them, and which they seek.  Thus it comes to pass that they only look for a knowledge of  the final causes of events, and when these are learned, they are content, as having no cause  for further doubt.  If they cannot learn such causes from external sources, they are  compelled to turn to considering themselves, and reflecting what end would have induced  them personally to bring about the given event, and thus they necessarily judge other  natures by their own.  Further, as they find in themselves and outside themselves many  means which assist them not a little in the search for what is useful, for instance, eyes for  seeing, teeth for chewing, herbs and animals for yielding food, the sun for giving light, the  sea for breeding fish, &c., they come to look on the whole of nature as a means for  obtaining such conveniences.  Now as they are aware, that they found these conveniences  and did not make them, they think they have cause for believing, that some other being has made them for their use.  As they look upon things as means, they cannot believe them to  be self-created; but, judging from the means which they are accustomed to prepare for  themselves, they are bound to believe in some ruler or rulers of the universe endowed with  human freedom, who have arranged and adapted everything for human use.  They are  bound to estimate the nature of such rulers (having no information on the subject) in accordance with their own nature, and therefore they assert that the gods ordained  everything for the use of man, in order to bind man to themselves and obtain from him the  highest honor. Hence also it follows, that everyone thought out for himself, according to  his abilities, a different way of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/919"],["title","Ethics â€” Part 1 (#7)"],["body","God, so that God might love him more than his  fellows, and direct the whole course of nature for the satisfaction of his blind cupidity and  insatiable avarice.  Thus the prejudice developed into superstition, and took deep root in  the human mind; and for this reason everyone strove most zealously to understand and  explain the final causes of things; but in their endeavor to show that nature does nothing  in vain, i.e. nothing which is useless to man, they only seem to have demonstrated that  nature, the gods, and men are all mad together.  Consider, I pray you, the result: among  the many helps of nature they were bound to find some hindrances, such as storms,  earthquakes, diseases, &c.:  so they declared that such things happen, because the gods  are angry at some wrong done to them by men, or at some fault committed in their  worship.  Experience day by day protested and showed by infinite examples, that good  and evil fortunes fall to the lot of pious and impious alike; still they would not abandon  their inveterate prejudice, for it was more easy for them to class such contradictions among  other unknown things of whose use they were ignorant, and thus to retain their actual and  innate condition of ignorance, than to destroy the whole fabric of their reasoning and start  afresh.  They therefore laid down as an axiom, that God's judgments far transcend human  understanding.  Such a doctrine might well have sufficed to conceal the truth from the human race for all eternity, if mathematics had not furnished another standard of verity in  considering solely the essence and properties of figures without regard to their final causes. There are other reasons (which I need not mention here) besides mathematics, which might  have caused men's minds to be directed to these general prejudices, and have led them to  the knowledge of the truth.  I have now sufficiently explained my first point.  There is no need to show at length, that  nature has no particular goal in view, and that final causes are mere human figments.  This,  I think, is already evident enough, both from the causes and foundations on which I have  shown such prejudice to be based, and also from Prop. xvi., and the Corollary of Prop.  xxxii., and, in fact, all those propositions in which I have shown, that everything in nature  proceeds from a sort of necessity, and with the utmost perfection.  However, I will add a  few remarks in order to overthrow this doctrine of a final cause utterly.  That which is  really a cause it considers as an effect, and vice versa:  it makes that which is by nature  first to be last, and that which is highest and most perfect to be most imperfect. Passing  over the questions of cause and priority as self-evident, it is plain from Props. xxi., xxii.,  xxiii. that the effect is most perfect which is produced immediately by God; the effect  which requires for its production several intermediate causes is, in that respect, more  imperfect.  But if those things which were made immediately by God were made to enable  him to attain his end, then the things which come after, for the sake of which the first were  made, are necessarily the most excellent of all.  Further, this doctrine does away with the perfection of God: for, if God acts for an object,  he necessarily desires something which he lacks.  Certainly, theologians and metaphysicians  draw a distinction between the object of want and the object of assimilation; still they  confess that God made all things for the sake of himself, not for the sake of creation.  They  are unable to point to anything prior to creation, except God himself, as an object for  which God should act, and are therefore driven to admit (as they clearly must), that God lacked those things for whose attainment he created means, and further that he desired  them.  We must not omit to notice that the followers of this doctrine, anxious to display their  talent in assigning final causes, have imported a new method of argument in proof of their theory--namely, a reduction, not to the impossible, but to ignorance; thus showing that they  have no other method of exhibiting their doctrine.  For example, if a stone falls from a roof  onto someone's head, and kills him, they will demonstrate by their new method, that the  stone fell in order to kill the man; for, if it had not by God's will fallen with that object, how could so many circumstances (and there are often many concurrent circumstances)  have all happened together by chance? Perhaps you will answer that the event is due to  the facts that the wind was blowing, and the man was walking that way.  \"But why,\" they  will insist, \"was the wind blowing, and why was the man at that very time walking that  way?\"  If you again answer, that the wind had then sprung up because the sea had begun  to be agitated the day before, the weather being previously calm, and that the man had  been invited by a friend, they will again insist:  \"But why was the sea agitated, and why was  the man invited at that time?\"  So they will pursue their questions from cause to cause, till  at last you take refuge in the will of God--in other words, the sanctuary of ignorance.  So,  again, when they survey the frame of the human body, they are amazed; and being  ignorant of the causes of so great a work of art, conclude that it has been fashioned, not  mechanically, but by divine and supernatural skill, and has been so put together that one  part shall not hurt another.  Hence anyone who seeks for the true causes of miracles, and strives to understand natural  phenomena as an intelligent being, and not to gaze at them like a fool, is set down and  denounced as an impious heretic by those, whom the masses adore as the interpreters of  nature and the gods.  Such persons know that, with the removal of ignorance, the wonder  which forms their only available means for proving and preserving their authority would vanish also.  But I now quit this subject, and pass on to my third point.  After men persuaded themselves, that everything which is created is created for their sake,  they were bound to consider as the chief quality in everything that which is most useful to themselves, and to account those things the best of all which have the most beneficial effect  on mankind.  Further, they were bound to form abstract notions for the explanation of the  nature of things, such as goodness, badness, order, confusion, warmth, cold, beauty,  deformity, and so on; and from the belief that they are free agents arose the further notions  of praise and blame, sin and merit.  I will speak of these latter hereafter, when I treat of human nature; the former I will briefly  explain here.  Everything which conduces to health and the worship of God they have called good,  everything which hinders these objects they have styled bad; and inasmuch as those who  do not understand the nature of things do not verify phenomena in any way, but merely imagine them after a fashion, and mistake their imagination for understanding, such  persons firmly believe that there is an order in things, being really ignorant both of things  and their own nature.  When phenomena are of such a kind, that the impression they make  on our senses requires little effort of imagination, and can consequently be easily  remembered, we say that they are well-ordered; if the contrary, that they are ill-ordered or  confused.  Further, as things which are easily imagined are more pleasing to us, men prefer  order to confusion--as though there were any order in nature, except in relation to our  imagination--and say that God has created all things in order; thus, without knowing it,  attributing imagination to God, unless, indeed, they would have it that God foresaw human  imagination, and arranged everything, so that it should be most easily imagined.  If this be  their theory, they would not, perhaps, be daunted by the fact that we find an infinite  number of phenomena, far surpassing our imagination, and very many others which  confound its weakness.  But enough has been said on this subject.  The other abstract  notions are nothing but modes of imagining, in which the imagination is differently  affected:  though they are considered by the ignorant as the chief attributes of things,  inasmuch as they believe that everything was created for the sake of themselves; and,  according as they are affected by it, style it good or bad, healthy or rotten or corrupt.  For  instance, if the motion which objects we see communicate to our nerves be conducive to  health, the objects causing it are styled beautiful; if a contrary motion be excited, they are  styled ugly.  Things which are perceived through our sense of smell are styled fragrant or fetid; if  through our taste, sweet or bitter, full-flavored or insipid; if through our touch, hard or  soft, rough or smooth, &c.  Whatsoever affects our ears is said to give rise to noise, sound, or harmony.  In this last  case, there are men lunatic enough to believe, that even God himself takes pleasure in  harmony; and philosophers are not lacking who have persuaded themselves, that the  motion of the heavenly bodies gives rise to harmony--all of which instances sufficiently  show that everyone judges of things according to the state of his brain, or rather mistakes  for things the forms of his imagination.  We need no longer wonder that there have arisen  all the controversies we have witnessed, and finally skepticism:  for, although human bodies  in many respects agree, yet in very many others they differ; so that what seems good to one  seems confused to another; what is pleasing to one displeases another, and so on.  I need  not further enumerate, because this is not the place to treat the subject at length, and also  because the fact is sufficiently well known. It is commonly said:  \"So many men, so many  minds; everyone is wise in his own way; brains differ as completely as"]]]
