And then I met Jimmy.\"  Jimmy bowed.  \"I hope you aren't tired out,\" said Lady Jane to him. \"We thought you would never arrive. It's such a long walk. It was really too careless of Spennie not to let us know when he expected you.\"  \"I was telling Spencer in the automobile,\" put in Lady Blunt, with ferocity, \"that _my_ father would have horsewhipped him if he had been a son of his. He would.\"  \"Really, Julia!\" protested Lady Jane rather faintly.  \"That's so. And I don't care who knows it. A boy doesn't want to forget things if he's going to make his way in the world. I told Spencer so in the automobile.\"  Jimmy had noticed that Spennie was not in the room. He now understood his absence. After the ride he had probably felt that an hour or two passed out of his aunt's society would not do him any harm. He was now undergoing a rest cure, Jimmy imagined, in the billiard room.  \"I can assure you,\" said he, by way of lending a helping hand to the absent one, \"I really preferred to walk. I have only just landed in England from New York, and it's quite a treat to walk on an English country road again.\"  \"Are you from New York? I wonder if----\"  \"Jimmy's an old friend,\" said Molly. \"We knew him very well indeed. It was such a surprise meeting him.\"  \"How interesting,\" said Lady Jane languidly, as if the intellectual strain of the conversation had been too much for her. \"You will have such lots to talk about, won't you?\"  \"I say,\" said Jimmy, as they moved away, \"who is that fellow Wesson?\"  \"Oh, a man,\" said Molly vaguely.  \"There's no need to be fulsome,\" said Jimmy. \"He can't hear.\"  \"Mother likes him. I don't.\"  \"Mother?\"  \"Hullo,\" said Molly, \"there's father.\"  The door had opened while they were talking, and Mr. Patrick McEachern had walked solidly into the room. The ornaments on the Chippendale tables jingled as he came. Secretly he was somewhat embarrassed at finding himself in the midst of so many people. He had not yet mastered the art of feeling at home in his own house. At meals he did not fear his wife's guests so much. Their attention was in a manner distributed at such times, instead of being, as now, focused upon himself. He stood there square and massive, outwardly the picture of all that was rugged and independent, looking about him for a friendly face. To offer a general remark, or to go boldly and sit down beside one of those dazzling young ladies, like some heavyweight spider beside a Miss Muffet, was beyond him. In his time he had stopped runaway horses, clubbed mad dogs, and helped to break up East Side gang fights, when the combatants on both sides were using their guns lavishly and impartially; but his courage failed him here.  \"Why,\" said Jimmy, \"is your father here, too? I didn't know that.\"  To himself he reviled his luck. How much would he see of Molly now? Her father's views on himself were no sealed book to him.  Molly looked at him in surprise.  \"Didn't know?\" she said. \"Didn't I tell you the place belonged to father?\"  \"What!\" said Jimmy. \"This house?\"  \"Yes. Of course.\"  \"And--by gad, I've got it. He has married Spennie Blunt's mother.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, I'm--surprised.\"  Suddenly he began to chuckle.  \"What _is_ it, Jimmy?\"  \"Why--why, I've just grasped the fact that your father--your father, mind you--is my host. I'm the honored guest. At his house!\"  The chuckle swelled into a laugh. The noise attracted McEachern's attention, and, looking in the direction whence it proceeded, he caught sight of Molly.  With a grin of joy, he made for the sofa.  \"Well, father, dear?\" said Molly nervously.  Mr. McEachern was staring horribly at Jimmy, who had risen to his feet.  \"How do you do, Mr. McEachern?\"  The ex-policeman continued to stare.  \"Father,\" said Molly in distress. \"Father, let me present--I mean, don't you remember Jimmy? You must remember Jimmy, father! Jimmy Pitt, whom you used to know in New York.\"     CHAPTER VI.   On his native asphalt there are few situations capable of throwing the New York policeman off his balance. In that favored clime, _savoir faire_ is represented by a shrewd left hook at the jaw, and a masterful stroke of the truncheon amounts to a satisfactory repartee. Thus shall you never take the policeman of Manhattan without his answer. In other surroundings, Mr. Patrick McEachern would have known how to deal with his young acquaintance, Mr. Jimmy Pitt. But another plan of action was needed here. First of all, the hints on etiquette with which Lady Jane had favored him, from time to time, and foremost came the mandate: \"Never make a scene.\" Scenes, Lady Jane had explained--on the occasion of his knocking down an objectionable cabman during their honeymoon trip--were of all things what polite society most resolutely abhorred. The natural man in him must be bound in chains. The sturdy blow must give way to the honeyed word. A cold \"Really!\" was the most vigorous retort that the best circles would countenance.  It had cost Mr. McEachern some pains to learn this lesson, but he had done it; and he proceeded on the present occasion to conduct himself high and disposedly, according to instructions from headquarters.  The surprise of finding an old acquaintance in this company rendered him dumb for a brief space, during which Jimmy looked after the conversation.  \"How do you do, Mr. McEachern?\" inquired Jimmy genially. \"Quite a surprise meeting you in England. A pleasant surprise. By the way, one generally shakes hands in the smartest circles. Yours seem to be down there somewhere. Might I trouble you? Right. Got it? Thanks!\"  He bent forward, possessed himself of Mr. McEachern's right hand, which was hanging limply at its proprietor's side, shook it warmly, and replaced it.  \"'Wahye?\" asked Mr. McEachern gruffly, giving a pleasing air of novelty to the hackneyed salutation by pronouncing it as one word. He took some little time getting into his stride when carrying on polite conversation.  \"Very well, thank you. You're looking as strong as ever, Mr. McEachern.\"  The ex-policeman grunted. In a conversational sense, he was sparring for wind.  Molly had regained her composure by this time. Her father was taking the thing better than she had expected.  \"It's Jimmy, father, dear,\" she said. \"Jimmy Pitt.\"  \"Dear old James,\" murmured the visitor.  \"I know, me dear, I know. Wahye?\"  \"Still well,\" replied Jimmy cheerfully. \"Sitting up, you will notice,\" he added, waving a hand in the direction of his teacup, \"and taking nourishment. No further bulletins will be issued.\"  \"Jimmy is staying here, father. He is the friend Spennie was bringing.\"  \"This is the friend that Spennie brought,\" said Jimmy in a rapid undertone. \"This is the maiden all forlorn who crossed the seas, and lived in the house that sheltered the friend that Spennie brought.\"  \"I see, me dear,\" said Mr. McEachern slowly. \"'Wah----\"  \"No, I've guessed that one already,\" said Jimmy. \"Ask me another.\"  Molly looked reproachfully at him. His deplorable habit of chaffing her father had caused her trouble in the old days. It may be admitted that this recreation of Jimmy's was not in the best taste; but it must also be remembered that the relations between the two had always been out of the ordinary. Great as was his affection for Molly, Jimmy could not recollect a time when war had not been raging in a greater or lesser degree between the ex-policeman and himself.  \"It is very kind of you to invite me down here,\" said he. \"We shall be able to have some cozy chats over old times when I was a wanderer on the face of the earth, and you----\"  \"Yis, yis,\" interrupted Mr. McEachern hastily, \"somewhere ilse, aftherward.\"  \"You shall choose time and place, of course. I was only going to ask you how you liked leaving the----\"  \"United States?\" put in Mr. McEachern, with an eagerness which broadened his questioner's friendly smile, as the Honorable Louis Wesson came toward them.  \"Well, I'm not after saying it was not a wrinch at firrst, but I considered it best to lave Wall Street--Wall Street, ye understand, before----\"  \"I see. Before you fell a victim to the feverish desire for reckless speculation which is so marked a characteristic of the American business man, what?\"  \"That's it,\" said the other, relieved.  \"I, too, have been speculating,\" said Mr. Wesson, \"as to whether you would care to show me the rose garden, Miss McEachern, as you promised yesterday. Of all flowers, I love roses best. You remember Bryant's lines, Miss McEachern? 'The rose that lives its little hour is prized beyond the sculptured flower.'\"  Jimmy interposed firmly. \"I'm very sorry,\" he said, \"but the fact is Miss McEachern has just promised to take me with her to feed the fowls.  \"I gamble on fowls,\" he thought. \"There must be some in a high-class establishment of this kind.\"  \"I'd quite forgotten,\" said Molly.  \"I thought you had. We'd better start at once. Nothing upsets a fowl more than having to wait for dinner.\"  \"Nonsense, me dear Molly,\" said Mr. McEachern bluffly. \"Run along and show Mr. Wesson the roses. Nobody wants to waste time over a bunch of hens.\"  \"Perhaps not,\" said Jimmy thoughtfully, \"perhaps not. I might be better employed here, amusing the people by telling them all about our old New York days and----\"  Mr. McEachern might have been observed, and was so observed by Jimmy, to swallow somewhat convulsively.  \"But as Molly promised ye----\" said he.  \"Just so,\" said Jimmy. \"My own sentiments, neatly expressed. Shall we start, Miss McEachern?\"  \"That fellah,\" said Mr. Wesson solemnly to his immortal soul, \"is a damn bounder. _And_ cad,\" he added after a moment's reflection.  The fowls lived in a little world of noise and smells at the back of the stables. The first half of the journey thither was performed in silence. Molly's cheerful little face was set in what she probably imagined to be a forbidding scowl. The tilt of her chin spoke "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8931"],["title","The Gem Collector (#6)"],["body","displeasure.  \"If a penny would be any use to you,\" said Jimmy, breaking the tension.  \"I'm not at all pleased with you,\" said Molly severely.  \"How _can_ you say such savage things! And me an orphan, too! What's the trouble? What have I done?\"  \"You know perfectly well. Making fun of father like that.\"  \"My dear girl, he loved it. Brainy badinage of that sort is exchanged every day in the best society. You should hear dukes and earls! The wit! the _esprit_! The flow of soul! Mine is nothing to it. What's this in the iron pot? Is this what you feed them? Queer birds, hens--I wouldn't touch the stuff for a fortune. It looks perfectly poisonous. Flock around, you pullets. Come in your thousands. All bad nuts returned, and a souvenir goes with every corpse. A little more of this putrescent mixture for you, sir. Certainly, pick up your dead, pick up your dead.\"  An unwilling dimple appeared on Molly's chin, like a sunbeam through clouds.  \"All the same,\" she said, \"you ought to be ashamed of yourself, Jimmy.\"  \"I haven't time when I find myself stopping in the same house with a girl I've been looking for for three years.\"  Molly looked away. There was silence for a moment.  \"Used you ever to think of me?\" she said quietly.  That curious constraint which had fallen upon Jimmy in the road came to him again, now, as sobering as a blow. Something which he could not define had changed the atmosphere. Suddenly in an instant, like a shallow stream that runs babbling over the stones into some broad, still pool, the note of their talk had deepened.  \"Yes,\" he said simply. He could find no words for what he wished to say.  \"I've thought of you--often,\" said Molly.  He took a step toward her. But the moment had passed. Her mood had changed in a flash, or seemed to have changed. The stream babbled on over the stones again.  \"Be careful, Jimmy! You nearly touched me with the spoon. I don't want to be covered with that horrible stuff. Look at that poor, little chicken out there in the cold. It hasn't had a morsel.\"  Jimmy responded to her lead. There was nothing else for him to do.  \"It's in luck,\" he said.  \"Give it a spoonful.\"  \"It can have one if it likes. But it's taking big risks. Here you are, Hercules. Pitch in.\"  He scraped the last spoonful out of the iron pot, and they began to walk back to the house.  \"You're very quiet, Jimmy,\" said Molly.  \"I was thinking.\"  \"What about?\"  \"Lots of things.\"  \"New York?\"  \"That among others.\"  \"Dear old New York,\" said Molly, with a little sigh. \"I'm not sure it wasn't--I mean, I sometimes wish--oh, you know. I mean it's lovely here, but it _was_ nice in the old days, wasn't it, Jimmy? It's a pity that things change, isn't it?\"  \"It depends.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"I don't mind things changing, if people don't.\"  \"Do you think I've changed? You said I hadn't when we met in the road.\"  \"You haven't, as far as looks go.\"  \"Have I changed in other ways?\"  Jimmy looked at her.  \"I don't know,\" he said slowly.  They were in the hall, now. Keggs had just left after beating the dressing gong. The echoes of it still lingered. Molly paused on the bottom step.  \"I haven't, Jimmy,\" she said; and ran on up the stairs.     CHAPTER VII.   Jimmy dressed for dinner in a very exalted frame of mind that night. It seemed to him that he had awakened from a sort of a stupor. Life was so much fuller of possibilities than he had imagined a few days back. The sudden acquisition of his uncle's money had, in a manner, brought him to a halt. Till then the exhilarating feeling of having his hand against the world had lent a zest to life. There had been no monotony. There had always been obstacles. One may hardly perhaps dilate on the joys of toil in connection with him, considering the precise methods by which he had supported himself; but nevertheless his emotions when breaking the law of the United States had been akin to those of the honest worker in so far that his operations had satisfied the desire for action which possesses every man of brains and energy. They had given him something to do. He had felt alive. His uncle's legacy had left him with a sensation of abrupt stoppage. Life had suddenly become aimless.  But now everything was altered. Once more the future was a thing of importance, to-morrow a day to be looked forward to with keen expectation.  He tried to throw his mind back to the last occasion when he had seen Molly. He could not remember that he had felt any excessive emotion. Between _camaraderie_ and love there is a broad gulf. It had certainly never been bridged in the old New York days. Then the frank friendliness of which the American girl appears to have the monopoly had been Molly's chief charm in his eyes. It had made possible a comradeship such as might have existed between men. But now there was a difference. England seemed to have brought about a subtle change in her. Instinctively he felt that the old friendship, adequate before, was not enough now. He wanted more. The unexpected meeting, following so closely upon Spike's careless words in London, had shown him his true feelings. Misgivings crept upon him. Had he a right? Was it fair? He looked back at the last eight years of his life with the eye of an impartial judge. He saw them stripped of the glamour which triumphant cunning had lent them; saw them as they would appear to Molly.  He scowled at his reflection in the glass. \"You've been a bad lot, my son,\" he said. \"There's only one thing in your favor; and that is the fact that you've cut it all out for keeps. We must be content with that.\"  There was a furtive rap at the door. \"Hullo?\" said Jimmy. \"Yes?\"  The door opened slowly. A grin, surmounted by a mop of red hair, appeared round the edge of it.  \"Well, Spike. Come in. What's the matter?\"  The rest of Mr. Mullins entered the room.  \"Gee, Mr. Chames, I wasn't sure dat dis was your room. Say, who do youse t'ink I nearly bumped me coco ag'in out in de corridor? Why, old man McEachern, de cop. Dat's right!\"  \"Yes?\"  \"Sure. Say, what's he doin' on dis beat? Youse c'u'd have knocked me down wit' a bit of poiper when I see him. I pretty near went down and out. Dat's right. Me heart ain't got back home yet.\"  \"Did he recognize you?\"  \"Sure! He starts like an actor on top de stoige when he sees he's up against de plot to ruin him, an' he gives me de fierce eye.\"  \"Well?\"  \"I was wondering was I on Third Avenue, or was I standing on me coco, or what was I doin', anyhow. Den I slips off and chases meself up here. Say, Mr. Chames, can _youse_ put me wise? What's de game? What's old man McEachern doin' stunts dis side for?\"  \"It's all right, Spike. Keep calm. I can explain. Mr. McEachern owns the house.\"  \"On your way, Mr. Chames! What's dat?\"  \"This is his house we're in, now. He left the force three years ago, came over here, and bought this place. And here we are again, all gathered together under the same roof, like a jolly little family party.\"  Spike's open mouth bore witness to his amazement.  \"Den all dis----\"  \"Belongs to him? That's it. We are his guests, Spike.\"  \"But what's he goin' to do?\"  \"I couldn't say. I'm expecting to hear shortly. But we needn't worry ourselves. The next move's with him. If he wants to say anything about it, he must come to me.\"  \"Sure. It's up to him,\" agreed Spike.  \"I'm quite comfortable. Speaking for myself, I'm having a good time. How are you getting on downstairs?\"  \"De limit, Mr. Chames. Honest, I'm on pink velvet. Dey's an old gazebo, de butler, Keggs his name is, dat's de best ever at handing out long woids. I sit and listen. Dey calls me Mr. Mullins down dere,\" said Spike, with pride.  \"Good. I'm glad you're all right. There's no reason why we shouldn't have an excellent time here. I don't think that Mr. McEachern will turn us out, after he's heard one or two little things I have to say to him. Just a few reminiscences of the past which may interest him. I have the greatest affection for Mr. McEachern, though he did club me once with his night stick; but nothing shall make me stir from here for the next week at any rate.\"  \"Not on your life,\" agreed Spike. \"Say, Mr. Chames, he must have got a lot of plunks to buy dis place. And I know how he got dem, too. Dat's right. I comes from old New York meself.\"  \"Hush, Spike, this is scandal!\"  \"Sure,\" said the Bowery boy doggedly, securely mounted now on his favorite hobby horse. \"I knows, and youse knows, Mr. Chames. Gee, I wish I'd bin a cop. But I wasn't tall enough. Dey's de fellers wit' de long green in der banks. Look at dis old McEachern. Money to boin a wet dog wit', he's got, and never a bit of woik for it from de start to de finish. An' look at me, Mr. Chames.\"  \"I do, Spike, I do.\"  \"Look at me. Getting busy all de year round, woiking to beat de band all----\"  \"In prisons oft,\" said Jimmy.  \"Dat's right. And chased all roun' de town. And den what? Why, to de bad at de end of it all. Say, it's enough to make a feller----\"  \"Turn honest.\" said Jimmy. \"You've hit it, Spike. You'll be glad some day that you reformed.\"  But on this point Spike seemed to be doubtful. He was silent for a moment; then, as if following upon a train of thoughts, he said: \"Mr. Chames, dis is a fine big house.\"  \"Splendid!\"  \"Say, couldn't we----\"  \"Spike!\" said Jimmy warningly.  \"Well, couldn't we?\" said Spike doggedly. \"It ain't often youse butts into a dead-easy proposition like dis one. We shouldn't have to do a t'ing excep' git busy. De stuff's just lying about, Mr. Chames.\"  \"I have noticed it.\"  \"Aw, it's a waste to leave it.\"  \"Spike,\" said Jimmy, \"I warned you of this. I begged you to be on your guard, to fight against your professional instincts; and you must do it. I know it's hard, but it's got to be done. Try and occupy your mind. Collect butterflies.\"  Spike shuffled in gloomy silence.  \"'Member dose jools we got in de hotel de year before I was copped?\" he asked at length irrelevantly.  Jimmy finished tying his tie, looked at the result for a "]]]
