La was studying the ape-man’s features. Slowly her large eyes opened very wide.  “Tarzan!” she exclaimed, and then, in the vernacular of the great apes which constant association with the anthropoids had rendered the common language of the Oparians: “You have come back to me! La has ignored the mandates of her religion, waiting, always waiting for Tarzan—for her Tarzan. She has taken no mate, for in all the world there was but one with whom La would mate. And now you have come back! Tell me, O Tarzan, that it is for me you have returned.”  Werper listened to the unintelligible jargon. He looked from La to Tarzan. Would the latter understand this strange tongue? To the Belgian’s surprise, the Englishman answered in a language evidently identical to hers.  “Tarzan,” he repeated, musingly. “Tarzan. The name sounds familiar.”  “It is your name—you are Tarzan,” cried La.  “I am Tarzan?” The ape-man shrugged. “Well, it is a good name—I know no other, so I will keep it; but I do not know you. I did not come hither for you. Why I came, I do not know at all; neither do I know from whence I came. Can you tell me?”  La shook her head. “I never knew,” she replied.  Tarzan turned toward Werper and put the same question to him; but in the language of the great apes. The Belgian shook his head.  “I do not understand that language,” he said in French.  Without effort, and apparently without realizing that he made the change, Tarzan repeated his question in French. Werper suddenly came to a full realization of the magnitude of the injury of which Tarzan was a victim. The man had lost his memory—no longer could he recollect past events. The Belgian was upon the point of enlightening him, when it suddenly occurred to him that by keeping Tarzan in ignorance, for a time at least, of his true identity, it might be possible to turn the ape-man’s misfortune to his own advantage.  “I cannot tell you from whence you came,” he said; “but this I can tell you—if we do not get out of this horrible place we shall both be slain upon this bloody altar. The woman was about to plunge her knife into my heart when the lion interrupted the fiendish ritual. Come! Before they recover from their fright and reassemble, let us find a way out of their damnable temple.”  Tarzan turned again toward La.  “Why,” he asked, “would you have killed this man? Are you hungry?”  The High Priestess cried out in disgust.  “Did he attempt to kill you?” continued Tarzan.  The woman shook her head.  “Then why should you have wished to kill him?” Tarzan was determined to get to the bottom of the thing.  La raised her slender arm and pointed toward the sun.  “We were offering up his soul as a gift to the Flaming God,” she said.  Tarzan looked puzzled. He was again an ape, and apes do not understand such matters as souls and Flaming Gods.  “Do you wish to die?” he asked Werper.  The Belgian assured him, with tears in his eyes, that he did not wish to die.  “Very well then, you shall not,” said Tarzan. “Come! We will go. This SHE would kill you and keep me for herself. It is no place anyway for a Mangani. I should soon die, shut up behind these stone walls.”  He turned toward La. “We are going now,” he said.  The woman rushed forward and seized the ape-man’s hands in hers.  “Do not leave me!” she cried. “Stay, and you shall be High Priest. La loves you. All Opar shall be yours. Slaves shall wait upon you. Stay, Tarzan of the Apes, and let love reward you.”  The ape-man pushed the kneeling woman aside. “Tarzan does not desire you,” he said, simply, and stepping to Werper’s side he cut the Belgian’s bonds and motioned him to follow.  Panting—her face convulsed with rage, La sprang to her feet.  “Stay, you shall!” she screamed. “La will have you—if she cannot have you alive, she will have you dead,” and raising her face to the sun she gave voice to the same hideous shriek that Werper had heard once before and Tarzan many times.  In answer to her cry a babel of voices broke from the surrounding chambers and corridors.  “Come, Guardian Priests!” she cried. “The infidels have profaned the holiest of the holies. Come! Strike terror to their hearts; defend La and her altar; wash clean the temple with the blood of the polluters.”  Tarzan understood, though Werper did not. The former glanced at the Belgian and saw that he was unarmed. Stepping quickly to La’s side the ape-man seized her in his strong arms and though she fought with all the mad savagery of a demon, he soon disarmed her, handing her long, sacrificial knife to Werper.  “You will need this,” he said, and then from each doorway a horde of the monstrous, little men of Opar streamed into the temple.  They were armed with bludgeons and knives, and fortified in their courage by fanatical hate and frenzy. Werper was terrified. Tarzan stood eyeing the foe in proud disdain. Slowly he advanced toward the exit he had chosen to utilize in making his way from the temple. A burly priest barred his way. Behind the first was a score of others. Tarzan swung his heavy spear, clublike, down upon the skull of the priest. The fellow collapsed, his head crushed.  Again and again the weapon fell as Tarzan made his way slowly toward the doorway. Werper pressed close behind, casting backward glances toward the shrieking, dancing mob menacing their rear. He held the sacrificial knife ready to strike whoever might come within its reach; but none came. For a time he wondered that they should so bravely battle with the giant ape-man, yet hesitate to rush upon him, who was relatively so weak. Had they done so he knew that he must have fallen at the first charge. Tarzan had reached the doorway over the corpses of all that had stood to dispute his way, before Werper guessed at the reason for his immunity. The priests feared the sacrificial knife! Willingly would they face death and welcome it if it came while they defended their High Priestess and her altar; but evidently there were deaths, and deaths. Some strange superstition must surround that polished blade, that no Oparian cared to chance a death thrust from it, yet gladly rushed to the slaughter of the ape-man’s flaying spear.  Once outside the temple court, Werper communicated his discovery to Tarzan. The ape-man grinned, and let Werper go before him, brandishing the jeweled and holy weapon. Like leaves before a gale, the Oparians scattered in all directions and Tarzan and the Belgian found a clear passage through the corridors and chambers of the ancient temple.  The Belgian’s eyes went wide as they passed through the room of the seven pillars of solid gold. With ill-concealed avarice he looked upon the age-old, golden tablets set in the walls of nearly every room and down the sides of many of the corridors. To the ape-man all this wealth appeared to mean nothing.  On the two went, chance leading them toward the broad avenue which lay between the stately piles of the half-ruined edifices and the inner wall of the city. Great apes jabbered at them and menaced them; but Tarzan answered them after their own kind, giving back taunt for taunt, insult for insult, challenge for challenge.  Werper saw a hairy bull swing down from a broken column and advance, stiff-legged and bristling, toward the naked giant. The yellow fangs were bared, angry snarls and barkings rumbled threateningly through the thick and hanging lips.  The Belgian watched his companion. To his horror, he saw the man stoop until his closed knuckles rested upon the ground as did those of the anthropoid. He saw him circle, stiff-legged about the circling ape. He heard the same bestial barkings and growlings issue from the human throat that were coming from the mouth of the brute. Had his eyes been closed he could not have known but that two giant apes were bridling for combat.  But there was no battle. It ended as the majority of such jungle encounters end—one of the boasters loses his nerve, and becomes suddenly interested in a blowing leaf, a beetle, or the lice upon his hairy stomach.  In this instance it was the anthropoid that retired in stiff dignity to inspect an unhappy caterpillar, which he presently devoured. For a moment Tarzan seemed inclined to pursue the argument. He swaggered truculently, stuck out his chest, roared and advanced closer to the bull. It was with difficulty that Werper finally persuaded him to leave well enough alone and continue his way from the ancient city of the Sun Worshipers.  The two searched for nearly an hour before they found the narrow exit through the inner wall. From there the well-worn trail led them beyond the outer fortification to the desolate valley of Opar.  Tarzan had no idea, in so far as Werper could discover, as to where he was or whence he came. He wandered aimlessly about, searching for food, which he discovered beneath small rocks, or hiding in the shade of the scant brush which dotted the ground.  The Belgian was horrified by the hideous menu of his companion. Beetles, rodents and caterpillars were devoured with seeming relish. Tarzan was indeed an ape again.  At last Werper succeeded in leading his companion toward the distant hills which mark the northwestern boundary of the valley, and together the two set out in the direction of the Greystoke bungalow.  What purpose prompted the Belgian in leading the victim of his treachery and greed back toward his former home it is difficult to guess, unless it was that without Tarzan there could be no ransom for Tarzan’s wife.  That night they camped in the valley beyond the hills, and as they sat before a little fire where cooked a wild pig that had fallen to one of Tarzan’s arrows, the latter sat lost in speculation. He seemed continually to be trying to grasp some mental image which as constantly eluded him.  At last he opened the leathern pouch which hung at his side. From it he poured into the palm of his hand a quantity of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/920"],["title","Ethics — Part 2 (#0)"],["body","de Spinoza, THE ETHICS (Ethica Ordine Geometrico Demonstrata)  Translated by R. H. M. Elwes     Part II:  ON THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE MIND    PREFACE I now pass on to explaining the results, which must necessarily follow from the essence of  God, or of the eternal and infinite being; not, indeed, all of them (for we proved in Part i.,  Prop. xvi., that an infinite number must follow in an infinite number of ways), but only  those which are able to lead us, as it were by the hand, to the knowledge of the human  mind and its highest blessedness.  DEFINITIONS I.  By 'body' I mean a mode which expresses in a certain determinate manner the essence  of God, in so far as he is considered as an extended thing.  (See Pt. i., Prop. xxv. Cor.)  II.  I consider as belonging to the essence of a thing that, which being given, the thing is  necessarily given also, and, which being removed, the thing is necessarily removed also;  in other words, that without which the thing, and which itself without the thing, can neither  be nor be conceived.  III. By 'idea,' I mean the mental conception which is formed by the mind as a thinking  thing.  >>>>>Explanation--I say 'conception' rather than perception, because the word perception  seems to imply that the mind is passive in respect to the object; whereas conception seems  to express an activity of the mind.  IV.  By 'an adequate idea,' I mean an idea which, in so far as it is considered in itself,  without relation to the object, has all the properties or intrinsic marks of a true idea.  >>>>>Explanation--I say 'intrinsic,' in order to exclude that mark which is extrinsic,  namely, the agreement between the idea and its object (ideatum).  V.  'Duration' is the indefinite continuance of existing.  >>>>>Explanation--I say 'indefinite,' because it cannot be determined through the  existence itself of the existing thing, or by its efficient cause, which necessarily gives the  existence of the thing, but does not take it away.  VI.  'Reality' and 'perfection' I use as synonymous terms.  VII.  By 'particular things,' I mean things which are finite and have a conditioned  existence; but if several individual things concur in one action, so as to be all  simultaneously the effect of one cause, I consider them all, so far, as one particular thing.   AXIOMS  I.  The essence of man does not involve necessary existence, that is, it may, in the order of  nature, come to pass that this or that man does or does not exist.  II.  Man thinks.  III.  Modes of thinking, such as love, desire, or any other of the passions, do not take place,  unless there be in the same individual an idea of the thing loved, desired, &c.  But the idea can exist without the presence of any other mode of thinking.  IV.  We perceive that a certain body is affected in many ways.  V.  We feel and perceive no particular things, save bodies and modes of thought.  N.B.  The Postulates are given after the conclusion of Prop. xiii.   PROPOSITIONS  I.  Thought is an attribute of God, or God is a thinking thing.  >>>>>Proof--Particular thoughts, or this and that thought, are modes which, in a certain  conditioned manner, express the nature of God (Pt. i., Prop. xxv., Cor.).  God therefore  possesses the attribute (Pt. i., Def. v.) of which the concept is involved in all particular  thoughts, which latter are conceived thereby. Thought, therefore, is one of the infinite  attributes of God, which express God's eternal and infinite essence (Pt. i., Def. vi.).  In  other words, God is a thinking thing.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--This proposition is also evident from the fact, that we are able to conceive  an infinite thinking being.  For, in proportion as a thinking being is conceived as thinking  more thoughts, so is it conceived as containing more reality or perfection.  Therefore a  being, which can think an infinite number of things in an infinite number of ways, is, necessarily, in respect of thinking, infinite.  As, therefore, from the consideration of  thought alone, we conceive an infinite being, thought is necessarily (Pt. i., Deff. iv. and vi.)  one of the infinite attributes of God, as we were desirous of showing.  II.  Extension is an attribute of God, or God is an extended thing.  >>>>>Proof--The proof of this proposition is similar to that of the last.  III.  In God there is necessarily the idea not only of his essence, but also of all things which  necessarily follow from his essence.  >>>>>Proof--God (by the first Prop. of this Part) can think an infinite number of things in  infinite ways, or (what is the same thing, by Prop. xvi., Part i.) can form the idea of his  essence, and of all things which necessarily follow therefrom.  Now all that is in the power  of God necessarily is (Pt. i., Prop. xxxv.).  Therefore, such an idea as we are considering necessarily is, and in God alone.  Q.E.D.  (Part i., Prop. xv.)  *****Note--The multitude understand by the power of God the free will of God, and the  right over all things that exist, which latter are accordingly generally considered as  contingent.  For it is said that God has the power to destroy all things, and to reduce them  to nothing.  Further, the power of God is very often likened to the power of kings.  But  this doctrine we have refuted (Pt. i., Prop. xxxii., Cors. i. and ii.), and we have shown  (Part i., Prop. xvi.) that God acts by the same necessity, as that by which he understands  himself; in other words, as it follows from the necessity of the divine nature (as all admit), that God understands himself, so also does it follow by the same necessity, that God  performs infinite acts in infinite ways.  We further showed (Part i., Prop. xxxiv.), that  God's power is identical with God's essence in action; therefore it is as impossible for us  to conceive God as not acting, as to conceive him as non-existent.  If we might pursue  the subject further, I could point out, that the power which is commonly attributed to God  is not only human (as showing that God is conceived by the multitude as a man, or in the  likeness of a man), but involves a negation of power.  However, I am unwilling to go over  the same ground so often.  I would only beg the reader again and again, to turn over  frequently in his mind what I have said in Part i. from Prop. xvi. to the end.  No one will  be able to follow my meaning, unless he is scrupulously careful not to confound the power  of God with the human power and right of kings.  IV.  The idea of God, from which an infinite number of things follow in infinite ways, can  only be one.  >>>>>Proof--Infinite intellect comprehends nothing save the attributes of God and his  modifications (Part i., Prop. xxx.). Now God is one (Part i., Prop. xiv., Cor.).  Therefore  the idea of God, wherefrom an infinite number of things follow in infinite ways, can only  be one.  Q.E.D.  V.  The actual being of ideas owns God as its cause, only in so far as he is considered as a  thinking thing, not in so far as he is unfolded in any other attribute; that is, the ideas both  of the attributes of God and of particular things do not own as their efficient cause their  objects (ideata) or the things perceived, but God himself in so far as he is a thinking thing.  >>>>>Proof--This proposition is evident from Prop. iii. of this Part.  We there drew the  conclusion, that God can form the idea of his essence, and of all things which follow  necessarily therefrom, solely because he is a thinking thing, and not because he is the  object of his own idea.  Wherefore the actual being of ideas owns for cause God, in so far  as he is a thinking thing. It may be differently proved as follows:  the actual being of ideas  is (obviously) a mode of thought, that is (Part i., Prop. xxv., Cor.) a mode which expresses  in a certain manner the nature of God, in so far as he is a thinking thing, and therefore (Part i., Prop. x.) involves the conception of no other attribute of God, and consequently  (by Part i., Ax. iv.) is not the effect of any attribute save thought.  Therefore the actual  being of ideas owns God as its cause, in so far as he is considered as a thinking thing, &c.   Q.E.D.  VI.  The modes of any given attribute are caused by God, in so far as he is considered  through the attribute of which they are modes, and not in so far as he is considered through  any other attribute.  >>>>>Proof--Each attribute is conceived through itself, without any other part (Part i.,  Prop. x.); wherefore the modes of each attribute involve the conception of that attribute,  but not of any other.  Thus (Part i., Ax. iv.) they are caused by God, only in so far as he  is considered through the attribute whose modes they are, and not in so far as he is  considered through any other.  Q.E.D.  <<<<<Corollary--Hence the actual being of things, which are not modes of thought, does  not follow from the divine nature, because that nature has prior knowledge of the things.   Things represented in ideas follow, and are derived from their particular attribute, in the  same manner, and with the same necessity as ideas follow (according to what we have  shown) from the attribute of thought.  VII.  The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things.  >>>>>Proof--This proposition is evident from Part i., Ax. iv. For the idea of everything  that is caused depends on a knowledge of the cause, whereof it is an effect.  <<<<<Corollary--Hence God's power of thinking is equal to his realized power of action-- that is, whatsoever follows from the infinite nature of God in the world of extension  (formaliter), follows without exception in the same order and connection from the idea of  God in the world of thought (objective).  *****Note--Before going any further, I wish to recall to mind what has been pointed out  above--namely, that whatsoever can be perceived by the infinite intellect as constituting the  essence of substance, belongs altogether only to one"]]]
