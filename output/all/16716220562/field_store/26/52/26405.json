Shall the Question be Considered (or discussed)? This question, which is put as soon as a subject is brought before an assembly, if any member “objects to its consideration” (or “discussion,” or “introduction”), is not intended to merely cut off debate, but to prevent the question from coming before the assembly for its action. If decided by a two-thirds vote in the negative, the question is removed from before the assembly immediately [see § 15].  Whenever the word “assembly,” which is used throughout these rules, occurs in forms of motions (as in Appeals, § 14), it is better to replace it by the special term used to designate the particular assembly; as for instance, “Society,” or “Convention,” or “Board.” The term “Congress,” when used in this Manual, refers to the House of Representatives of the U.S.  Part I. Rules of Order.  Art. I. Introduction of Business. [§§ 1-5.]  1. All business should be brought before the assembly by a motion of a member, or by the presentation of a communication to the assembly. It is not usual, however, to make a motion to receive the reports of committees [§ 30] or communications to the assembly; and in many other cases in the ordinary routine of business, the formality of a motion is dispensed with; but should any member object, a regular motion becomes necessary.  2. Before a member can make a motion or address the assembly upon any question, it is necessary that he obtain the floor; that is, he must rise and address the presiding officer by his title, thus: “Mr. Chairman” [§ 34], who will then announce the member’s name. Where two or more rise at the same time the Chairman must decide who is entitled to the floor, which he does by announcing that member’s name. From this decision, however, an appeal [§ 14] can he taken; though if there is any doubt as to who is entitled to the floor, the Chairman can at the first allow the assembly to decide the question by a vote—the one getting the largest vote being entitled to the floor.  The member upon whose motion the subject under discussion was brought before the assembly (or, in case of a committee’s report, the one who presented the report) is entitled to be recognized as having the floor (if he has not already had it during that discussion), notwithstanding another member may have first risen and addressed the Chair. If the Chairman rise to speak before the floor has been assigned to any one, it is the duty of a member who may have previously risen to take his seat. [See Decorum in Debate, § 36.]  When a member has obtained the floor, he cannot be cut off from addressing the assembly, nor be interrupted in this speech by a motion to adjourn, or for any purpose, by either the Chairman or any member, except (a) to have entered on the minutes a motion to reconsider [§ 27]; (b) by a call to order [§ 14]; (c) by an objection to the consideration of the question [§ 15]; or (d) by a call for the orders of the day [§ 13].* [See note to § 61.] In such cases the member when he arises and addresses the Chair should state at once for what purpose he rises, as, for instance, that he “rises to a point of order.” A call for an adjournment, or for the question, by members in their seats, is not a motion; as no motion can be made, without rising and addressing, the Chair, and being announced by the presiding officer. Such calls for the question are themselves breaches of order, and do not prevent the speaker from going on if he pleases.  3. Before any subject is open to debate [§ 34] it is necessary, first, that a motion he made; second, that it be seconded, (see exceptions below); and third, that it be stated by the presiding officer. When the motion is in writing it shall be handed to the Chairman, and read before it is debated.  This does not prevent suggestions of alterations, before the question is stated by the presiding officer. To the contrary, much time may be saved by such informal remarks; which, however, must never be allowed to run into debate. The member who offers the motion, until it has been stated by the presiding officer, can modify his motion, or even withdraw it entirely; after it is stated he can do neither, without the consent of the assembly. [See §§ 5 and 17]. When the mover modifies his motion, the one who seconded it can withdraw his second.  Exceptions: A call for the order of the day, a question of order (though not an appeal), or an objection to the consideration of a question [§§ 13, 14, 15], does not have to be seconded; and many questions of routine are not seconded or even made; the presiding officer merely announcing that, if no objection is made, such will be considered the action of the assembly.  4. All Principal Motions [§ 6], Amendments and Instructions to Committees, should be in writing, if required by the presiding officer. Although a question is complicated, and capable of being made into several questions, no one member (without there is a special rule allowing it) can insist upon its being divided; his resource is to move that the question be divided, specifying in his motion how it is to be divided. Any one else can move as an amendment to this, to divide it differently.  This Division of a Question is really an amendment [§ 23], and subject to the same rules. Instead of moving a division of the question, the same result can be usually attained by moving some other form of an amendment. When the question is divided, each separate question must be a proper one for the assembly to act upon, even if none of the others were adopted. Thus, a motion to “commit with instructions,” is indivisible, because if divided, and the motion to commit should fail, then the other motion to instruct the committee would be improper, as there would be no committee to instruct.* [The 46th Rule of the House of Representatives requires the division of a question on the demand of one member, provided “it comprehends propositions in substance so distinct that one being taken away, a substantive proposition shall remain for the decision of the House.” But this does not allow a division so as to have a vote on separate items or names. The 121st Rule expressly provides that on the demand of one-fifth of the members a separate vote shall be taken on such items separately, and others collectively, as shall be specified in the call, in the case of a bill making appropriations for internal improvements. But this right to divide a question into items extends to no case but the one specified. The common parliamentary law allows of no division except when the assembly orders it, and in ordinary assemblies this rule will be found to give less trouble than the Congressional one.]  The motion to “strike out certain words and insert others,” is indivisible, as it is strictly one proposition.  5. After a question has been stated by the presiding officer, it is in the possession of the assembly for debate; the mover cannot withdraw or modify it, if any one objects, except by obtaining leave from the assembly [§ 17], or by moving an amendment.  Art. II. General Classification of Motions. [§§ 6-9.]  6. A Principal or Main Question or Motion, is a motion made to bring before the assembly, for its consideration, any particular subject. No Principal Motion can be made when any other question is before the assembly. It takes precedence of nothing, and yields to all Privileged, Incidental and Subsidiary Questions [§§ 7, 8, 9].  7. Subsidiary or Secondary Questions or Motions relate to a Principal Motion, and enable the assembly to dispose of it in the most appropriate manner. These motions take precedence of the Principal Question, and must be decided before the Principal Question can be acted upon. They yield to Privileged and Incidental Questions [§§ 8, 9], and are as follows (being arranged in their order of precedence among themselves):  Lie on the Table ……………….. See § 19. The Previous Question …………… ” § 20. Postpone to a Certain Day ……….. ” § 21. Commit ………………………… ” § 22. Amend …………………………. ” § 23. Postpone Indefinitely …………… ” § 24.  Any of these motions (except Amend) can be made when one of a lower order is pending, but none can supersede one of a higher order. They cannot be applied* [See Plan of Work and Definitions, in Introduction, for explanation of some of these technical terms.] to one another except in the following cases: (a) the Previous Question applies to the motion to Postpone, without affecting the principal motion, and can, if specified, be applied to a pending amendment [§ 20]; (b) the motions to Postpone to a certain day, and to Commit, can be amended; and (c) a motion to Amend the minutes can be laid on the table without carrying the minutes with it [§ 19].  8. Incidental Questions are such as arise out of other questions, and, consequently, take precedence of, and are to be decided before, the questions which give rise to them. They yield to Privileged Questions [§ 9], and cannot be amended. Excepting an Appeal, they are undebatable; an Appeal is debatable or not, according to circumstances, as shown in § 14. They are as follows:    Appeal (or Questions of Order) ……………………… See § 14.   Objection to the Consideration of a Question …………. ” § 15.   The Reading of Papers ……………………………… ” § 16.   Leave to Withdraw a Motion …………………………. ” § 17.   Suspension of the Rules ……………………………. ” § 18.  9. Privileged Questions are such as, on account of their importance, take precedence over all other questions whatever, and on account of this very privilege they are undebatable [§ 35], excepting when relating to the rights of the assembly or its members, as otherwise they could be made use of so as to seriously interrupt business. They are as follows (being arranged in their order of precedence among"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9097"],["title","Robert's Rules of Order (#3)"],["body","hemselves):    To Fix the Time to which the Assembly shall Adjourn …… See § 10.

Call for the Orders of the Day ……………………… ” § 13.  Art. III. Motions and their Order of Precedence.* [For a list of all the ordinary motions, arranged in their order of precedence, see § 64. All the Privileged and Subsidiary ones in this Article are so arranged.] [§§ 10-27.]  Privileged Motions. [§§ 10-13. See § 9.]  10. To Fix the Time to which the Assembly shall Adjourn. This motion takes precedence of all others, and is in order even after the assembly has voted to adjourn, provided the Chairman has not announced the result of the vote. If made when another question is before the assembly, it is undebatable [§ 35]; it can be amended by altering the time. If made when no other question is before the asembly, it stands as any other principal motion, and is debatable.** [In ordinary societies it is better to follow the common parliamentary law, and permit this question to be introduced as a principal question, when it can be debated and suppressed [§ 58, 59] like other questions. In Congress, it is never debatable, and has entirely superseded the unprivileged and inferior motion to “adjourn to a particular time.”]  The Form of this motion is, “When this assembly adjourns, it adjourns to meet at such a time.”  11. To Adjourn. This motion (when unqualified) takes precedence of all others, except to “fix the time to which to adjourn,” to which it yields. It is not debatable, and cannot be amended, or have any other subsidiary motion [§ 7] applied to it. If qualified in any way it loses its privileged character, and stands as any other principal motion. The motion to adjourn can be repeated if there has been any intervening business, though it be simply progress in debate [§ 26]. When a committee is through with any business referred to it, and prepared to report, instead of adjourning, a motion should be made “to rise,” which motion, in committee, has the same privileges as to adjourn in the assembly [§ 32].  The effect upon Unfinished Business of an adjournment is as follows* [“After six days from the commencement of a second or subsequent session of any Congress, all bills, resolutions and reports which originated in the House, and at the close of the next preceding session remained undetermined, shall be resumed, and acted on in the same manner as if an adjournment had not taken place.” Rule 136, H. R. Any ordinary society that meets as seldom as once each year, is apt to be composed of as different membership at its successive meetings, as any two successive Congresses, and only trouble would result from allowing unfinished business to hold over to the next yearly meeting.] [see Session, § 42]:  (a) When it does not close the session, the business interrupted by the adjournment is the first in order after the reading of the minutes at the next meeting, and is treated the same as if there had been no adjournment; an adjourned meeting being legally the continuation of the meeting of which it is an adjournment.  (b) When it closes a session in an assembly which has more than one regular session each year, then the unfinished business is taken up at the next succeeding session previous to new business, and treated the same as if there had been no adjournment [see § 44, for its place in the order of business]. Provided, that, in a body elected for a definite time (as a board of directors elected for one year), unfinished business falls to the ground with the expiration of the term for which the board or any portion of them were elected.  (c) When the adjournment closes a session in an assembly which does not meet more frequently than once a year, or when the assembly is an elective body, and this session ends the term of a portion of the members, the adjournment shall put an end to all business unfinished at the close of the session. The business can be introduced at the next session, the same as if it had never been before the assembly.  12. Questions of Privilege. Questions relating to the rights and privileges of the assembly, or any of its members, take precedence of all other questions, except the two preceding, to which they yield. The Previous Question [§ 20] can be applied to these, as to all other debatable questions.  13. Orders of the Day. A call for the Orders of the Day takes precedence of every other motion, excepting to Reconsider [§ 27], and the three preceding, to which latter three it yields, and is not debatable, nor can it be amended. It does not require to be seconded.  When one or more subjects have been assigned to a particular day or hour, they become the Orders of the Day for that day or hour, and they cannot be considered before that time, except by a two-thirds vote [§ 39]. And when that day or hour arrives, if called up, they take precedence of all but the three preceding questions [§§ 10, 11, 12]. Instead of considering them, the assembly may appoint another time for their consideration. If not taken up on the day specified, the order falls to the ground.  When the Orders of the Day are taken up, it is necessary to take up the separate questions in their exact order, the one first assigned to the day or hour, taking precedence of one afterwards assigned to the same day or hour. (A motion to take up a particular part of the Orders of the Day, or a certain question, is not a privileged motion). Any of the subjects, when taken up, instead of being then considered, can be assigned to some other time.  The Form of this question, as put by the Chair when the proper time arrives, or on the call of a member, is, “Shall the Order of the Day be taken up?” or, “Will the assembly now proceed with the Orders of the Day?”  The Effect of an affirmative vote on a call for the Orders of the Day, is to remove the question under consideration from before the assembly, the same as if it had been interrupted by an adjournment [§ 11].  The Effect of a negative vote is to dispense with the orders merely so far as they interfere with the consideration of the question then before the assembly.  Incidental Motions. [§§ 14-18; see § 8]  14. Appeal [Questions of Order]. A Question of Order takes precedence of the question giving rise to it, and must be decided by the presiding officer without debate. If a member objects to the decision, he says, “I appeal from the decision of the Chair.” If the Appeal is seconded, the Chairman immediately states the question as follows: “Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgement of the assembly?”* [The word Assembly can be replaced by Society, Convention, Board, etc., according to the name of the organization.] This Appeal yields to Privileged Questions [§ 9]. It cannot be amended; it cannot be debated when it relates simply to indecorum [§ 36], or to transgressions of the rules of speaking, or to the priority of business, or if it is made while the previous question [§ 20] is pending. When debatable, no member is allowed to speak but once, and whether debatable or not, the presiding officer, without leaving the Chair, can state the reasons upon which he bases his decision. The motions to Lie on the Table [§ 19], or for the Previous Question [§ 20], can be applied to an Appeal, when it is debatable, and when adopted they affect nothing but the Appeal. The vote on an Appeal may also be reconsidered [§ 27]. An Appeal is not in order when another Appeal is pending.  It is the duty of the presiding officer to enforce the rules and orders of the assembly, without debate or delay. It is also the right of every member, who notices a breach of a rule to insist upon its enforcement. In such cases he shall rise from his seat, and say, “Mr. Chairman, I rise to a point of order.” The speaker should immediately take his seat, and the Chairman requests the member to state his point of order, which he does, and resumes his seat. The Chair decides the point, and then, if no appeal is taken, permits the first member to resume his speech. If the member’s remarks are decided to be improper, and any one objects to his continuing his speech, he cannot continue it without a vote of the assembly to that effect. Instead of the method just described, it is usual, when it is simply a case of improper language used in debate, for a member to say, “I call the gentleman to order;” the Chairman decides whether the speaker is in or out of order, and proceeds as before. The Chairman can ask the advice of members when he has to decide questions of order, but the advice must be given sitting, to avoid the appearance of debate; or the Chair, when unable to decide the question, may at once submit it to the assembly. The effect of laying an appeal on the table, is to sustain, at least for the time, the decision of the Chair, and does not carry to the table the question which gave rise to the question of order.  15. Objection to the Consideration of a Question. An objection can be made to any principal motion [§ 6], but only when it is first introduced, before it has been debated. It is similar to a question of order [§ 14,] in that it can be made while another member has the floor, and does not require a second; and as the Chairman can call a member to order, so can he put this question if he deems it necessary, upon his own responsibility. It can not be debated [§ 35] or have any subsidiary motion [§ 7] applied to it. When a motion is made and any member “objects to its consideration,” the Chairman shall immediately put the question, “Will the assembly consider it?” or, “Shall the question be considered” [or discussed]? If decided in the negative by a two-thirds vote [§ 39], the whole matter is dismissed for that session [§ 42]; otherwise the discussion continues as if this question had never been made.  The Object of this motion is not to cut off debate (for which"]]]
