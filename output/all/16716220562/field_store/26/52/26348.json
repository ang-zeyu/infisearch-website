'Corregidor'--what does it mean?\"  \"I don't know,\" replied Cecy, quite consoled. \"It was in the 'Conquest of Granada.' Something to walk over, I believe.\"  \"The next,\" went on Katy, consulting her paper, \"is 'Yap,' a Simple Poem, by Clover Carr.\"  All the children giggled, but Clover got up composedly, and recited the following verses:    \"Did you ever know Yap?     The best little dog   Who e'er sat on lap     Or barked at a frog.    \"His eyes were like beads,     His tail like a mop,   And it waggled as if     It never would stop.    \"His hair was like silk     Of the glossiest sheen,   He always ate milk,     And once the cold-cream    \"Off the nursery bureau     (That line is too long!)   It made him quite ill,     So endeth my song.    \"For Yappy he died     Just two months ago,   And we oughtn't to sing     At a funeral, you know.\"  The \"Poem\" met with immense applause; all the children laughed, and shouted, and clapped, till the loft rang again. But Clover kept her face perfectly, and sat down as demure as ever, except that the little dimples came and went at the corners of her mouth; dimples, partly natural, and partly, I regret to say, the result of a pointed slate-pencil, with which Clover was in the habit of deepening them every day while she studied her lessons.  \"Now,\" said Katy, after the noise had subsided, \"now come 'Scripture Verses,' by Miss Elsie and Joanna Carr. Hold up your head, Elsie, and speak distinctly; and oh, Johnnie, you _mustn't_ giggle in that way when it comes your turn!\"  But Johnnie only giggled the harder at this appeal, keeping her hands very tight across her mouth, and peeping out over her fingers. Elsie, however, was solemn as a little judge, and with great dignity began:    \"An angel with a fiery sword,   Came to send Adam and Eve abroad   And as they journeyed through the skies   They took one look at Paradise.   They thought of all the happy hours   Among the birds and fragrant bowers,   And Eve she wept, and Adam bawled,   And both together loudly squalled.\"  Dorry snickered at this, but sedate Clover hushed him.  \"You mustn't,\" she said; \"it's about the Bible, you know. Now John, it's your turn.\"  But Johnnie would persist in holding her hands over her mouth, while her fat little shoulders shook with laughter. At last, with a great effort, she pulled her face straight, and speaking as fast as she possibly could, repeated, in a sort of burst:    \"Balaam's donkey saw the Angel,     And stopped short in fear.   Balaam didn't see the Angel,     Which is very queer.\"  After which she took refuge again behind her fingers, while Elsie went on--    \"Elijah by the creek,     He by ravens fed,   Took from their horny beak     Pieces of meat and bread.\"  \"Come, Johnnie,\" said Katy, but the incorrigible Johnnie was shaking again, and all they could make out was--    \"The bears came down, and ate------and ate.\"  These \"Verses\" were part of a grand project on which Clover and Elsie had been busy for more than a year. It was a sort of rearrangement of Scripture for infant minds; and when it was finished, they meant to have it published, bound in red, with daguerreotypes of the two authoresses on the cover. \"The Youth's Poetical Bible\" was to be the name of it. Papa, much tickled with the scraps which he overheard, proposed, instead, \"The Trundle-Bed Book,\" as having been composed principally in that spot, but Elsie and Clover were highly indignant, and would not listen to the idea for a moment.  After the \"Scripture Verses,\" came Dorry's turn. He had been allowed to choose for himself, which was unlucky, as his taste was peculiar, not to say gloomy. On this occasion he had selected that cheerful hymn which begins--    \"Hark, from the tombs a doleful sound.\"  And he now began to recite it in a lugubrious voice and with great emphasis, smacking his lips, as it were, over such lines as--    \"Princes, this clay _shall_ be your bed,     In spite of all your towers.\"  The older children listened with a sort of fascinated horror, rather enjoying the cold chills which ran down their backs, and huddling close together, as Dorry's hollow tones echoed from the dark corners of the loft. It was too much for Philly, however. At the close of the piece he was found to be in tears.  \"I don't want to st-a-a-y up here and be groaned at,\" he sobbed.  \"There, you bad boy!\" cried Katy, all the more angry because she was conscious of having enjoyed it herself, \"that's what you do with your horrid hymns, frightening us to death and making Phil cry!\" And she gave Dorry a little shake. He began to whimper, and as Phil was still sobbing, and Johnnie had begun to sob too, out of sympathy with the others, the _Feet_ in the Loft seemed likely to come to a sad end.  \"I'm goin' to tell Aunt Izzie that I don't like you,\" declared Dorry, putting one leg through the opening in the floor.  \"No, you aren't,\" said Katy, seizing him, \"you are going to stay, because _now_ we are going to have the Feast! Do stop, Phil; and Johnnie, don't be a goose, but come and pass round the cookies.\"  The word \"Feast\" produced a speedy effect on the spirits of the party. Phil cheered at once, and Dorry changed his mind about going. The black bottle was solemnly set in the midst, and the cookies were handed about by Johnnie, who was now all smiles. The cookies had scalloped edges and caraway seeds inside, and were very nice. There were two apiece; and as the last was finished, Katy put her hand in her pocket, and amid great applause, produced the crowning addition to the repast--seven long, brown sticks of cinnamon.  \"Isn't it fun?\" she said. \"Debby was real good-natured to-day, and let me put my own hand into the box, so I picked out the longest sticks there were. Now, Cecy, as you're company, you shall have the first drink out of the bottle.\"  The \"something delicious\" proved to be weak vinegar-and-water. It was quite warm, but somehow, drank up there in the loft, and out of a bottle, it tasted very nice. Beside, they didn't _call_ it vinegar-and-water--of course not! Each child gave his or her swallow a different name, as if the bottle were like Signor Blitz's and could pour out a dozen things at once. Clover called her share \"Raspberry Shrub,\" Dorry christened his \"Ginger Pop,\" while Cecy, who was romantic, took her three sips under the name of \"Hydomel,\" which she explained was something nice, made, she believed, of beeswax. The last drop gone, and the last bit of cinnamon crunched, the company came to order again, for the purpose of hearing Philly repeat his one piece,--    \"Little drops of water,\"  which exciting poem he had said every Saturday as far back as they could remember. After that Katy declared the literary part of the \"Feet\" over, and they all fell to playing \"Stagecoach,\" which, in spite of close quarters and an occasional bump from the roof, was such good fun, that a general \"Oh dear!\" welcomed the ringing of the tea-bell. I suppose cookies and vinegar had taken away their appetites, for none of them were hungry, and Dorry astonished Aunt Izzie very much by eyeing the table in a disgusted way, and saying: \"Pshaw! _only_ plum sweatmeats and sponge cake and hot biscuit! I don't want any supper.\"  \"What ails the child? he must be sick,\" said Dr. Carr; but Katy explained.  \"Oh no, Papa, it isn't that--only we've been having a feast in the loft.\"  \"Did you have a good time?\" asked Papa, while Aunt Izzie gave a dissatisfied groan. And all the children answered at once: \"Splendiferous!\"     CHAPTER VI  INTIMATE FRIENDS   \"Aunt Izzie, may I ask Imogen Clark to spend the day here on Saturday?\" cried Katy, bursting in one afternoon.  \"Who on earth is Imogen Clark? I never heard the name before,\" replied her aunt.  \"Oh, the _loveliest_ girl! She hasn't been going to Mrs. Knight's school but a little while, but we're the greatest friends. And she's perfectly beautiful, Aunt Izzie. Her hands are just as white as snow, and no bigger than _that_. She's got the littlest waist of any girl in school, and she's real sweet, and so self-denying and unselfish! I don't believe she has a bit good times at home, either. Do let me ask her!\"  \"How do you know she's so sweet and self-denying, if you've known her such a short time?\" asked Aunt Izzie, in an unpromising tone.  \"Oh, she tells me everything! We always walk together at recess now. I know all about her, and she's just lovely! Her father used to be real rich, but they're poor now, and Imogen had to have her boots patched twice last winter. I guess she's the flower of her family. You can't think how I love her!\" concluded Katy, sentimentally.  \"No, I can't,\" said Aunt Izzie. \"I never could see into these sudden friendships of yours, Katy, and I'd rather you wouldn't invite this Imogen, or whatever her name is, till I've had a chance to ask somebody about her.\"  Katy clasped her hands in despair. \"Oh, Aunt Izzie!\" she cried, \"Imogen knows that I came in to ask you, and she's standing at the gate at this moment, waiting to hear what you say. Please let me, just this once! I shall be so dreadfully ashamed not to.\"  \"Well,\" said Miss Izzie, moved by the wretchedness of Katy's face, \"if you've asked her already, it's no use my saying no, I suppose. But recollect, Katy, this is not to happen again. I can't have you inviting girls, and then coming for my leave. Your father won't be at all pleased. He's very particular about whom you make friends with. Remember how Mrs. Spenser turned out.\"  Poor Katy! Her propensity to fall violently in love with new people was always getting her into scrapes. Ever since she began to walk and talk, \"Katy's intimate friends\" had been one of the jokes of the household."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8995"],["title","What Katy Did Next (#0)"],["body","and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team           [Illustration: She paid a visit to the little garden.

AN UNEXPECTED GUEST.   The September sun was glinting cheerfully into a pretty bedroom furnished with blue. It danced on the glossy hair and bright eyes of two girls, who sat together hemming ruffles for a white muslin dress. The half-finished skirt of the dress lay on the bed; and as each crisp ruffle was completed, the girls added it to the snowy heap, which looked like a drift of transparent clouds or a pile of foamy white-of-egg beaten stiff enough to stand alone.  These girls were Clover and Elsie Carr, and it was Clover's first evening dress for which they were hemming ruffles. It was nearly two years since a certain visit made by Johnnie to Inches Mills, of which some of you have read in \"Nine Little Goslings;\" and more than three since Clover and Katy had returned home from the boarding-school at Hillsover.  Clover was now eighteen. She was a very small Clover still, but it would have been hard to find anywhere a prettier little maiden than she had grown to be. Her skin was so exquisitely fair that her arms and wrists and shoulders, which were round and dimpled like a baby's, seemed cut out of daisies or white rose leaves. Her thick, brown hair waved and coiled gracefully about her head. Her smile was peculiarly sweet; and the eyes, always Clover's chief beauty, had still that pathetic look which made them irresistible to tender-hearted people.  Elsie, who adored Clover, considered her as beautiful as girls in books, and was proud to be permitted to hem ruffles for the dress in which she was to burst upon the world. Though, as for that, not much \"bursting\" was possible in Burnet, where tea-parties of a middle-aged description, and now and then a mild little dance, represented \"gayety\" and \"society.\" Girls \"came out\" very much, as the sun comes out in the morning,--by slow degrees and gradual approaches, with no particular one moment which could be fixed upon as having been the crisis of the joyful event.  \"There,\" said Elsie, adding another ruffle to the pile on the bed,--\"there's the fifth done. It's going to be ever so pretty, I think. I'm glad you had it all white; it's a great deal nicer.\"  \"Cecy wanted me to have a blue bodice and sash,\" said Clover, \"but I wouldn't. Then she tried to persuade me to get a long spray of pink roses for the skirt.\"  \"I'm so glad you didn't! Cecy was always crazy about pink roses. I only wonder she didn't wear them when she was married!\"  Yes; the excellent Cecy, who at thirteen had announced her intention to devote her whole life to teaching Sunday School, visiting the poor, and setting a good example to her more worldly contemporaries, had actually forgotten these fine resolutions, and before she was twenty had become the wife of Sylvester Slack, a young lawyer in a neighboring town! Cecy's wedding and wedding-clothes, and Cecy's house-furnishing had been the great excitement of the preceding year in Burnet; and a fresh excitement had come since in the shape of Cecy's baby, now about two months old, and named \"Katherine Clover,\" after her two friends. This made it natural that Cecy and her affairs should still be of interest in the Carr household; and Johnnie, at the time we write of, was making her a week's visit.  \"She _was_ rather wedded to them,\" went on Clover, pursuing the subject of the pink roses. \"She was almost vexed when I wouldn't buy the spray. But it cost lots, and I didn't want it in the least, so I stood firm. Besides, I always said that my first party dress should be plain white. Girls in novels always wear white to their first balls; and fresh flowers are a great deal prettier, any way, than artificial. Katy says she'll give me some violets to wear.\"  \"Oh, will she? That will be lovely!\" cried the adoring Elsie. \"Violets look just like you, somehow. Oh, Clover, what sort of a dress do you think I shall have when I grow up and go to parties and things? Won't it be awfully interesting when you and I go out to choose it?\"  Just then the noise of some one running upstairs quickly made the sisters look up from their work. Footsteps are very significant at times, and these footsteps suggested haste and excitement.  Another moment, the door opened, and Katy dashed in, calling out, \"Papa!--Elsie, Clover, where's papa?\"  \"He went over the river to see that son of Mr. White's who broke his leg. Why, what's the matter?\" asked Clover.  \"Is somebody hurt?\" inquired Elsie, startled at Katy's agitated looks.  \"No, not hurt, but poor Mrs. Ashe is in such trouble.\"  Mrs. Ashe, it should be explained, was a widow who had come to Burnet some months previously, and had taken a pleasant house not far from the Carrs'. She was a pretty, lady-like woman, with a particularly graceful, appealing manner, and very fond of her one child, a little girl. Katy and papa both took a fancy to her at once; and the families had grown neighborly and intimate in a short time, as people occasionally do when circumstances are favorable.  \"I'll tell you all about it in a minute,\" went on Katy. \"But first I must find Alexander, and send him off to meet papa and beg him to hurry home.\" She went to the head of the stairs as she spoke, and called \"Debby! Debby!\" Debby answered. Katy gave her direction, and then came back again to the room where the other two were sitting.  \"Now,\" she said, speaking more collectedly, \"I must explain as fast as I can, for I have got to go back. You know that Mrs. Ashe's little nephew is here for a visit, don't you?\"  \"Yes, he came on Saturday.\"  \"Well, he was ailing all day yesterday, and to-day he is worse, and she is afraid it is scarlet-fever. Luckily, Amy was spending the day with the Uphams yesterday, so she scarcely saw the boy at all; and as soon as her mother became alarmed, she sent her out into the garden to play, and hasn't let her come indoors since, so she can't have been exposed to any particular danger yet. I went by the house on my way down street, and there sat the poor little thing all alone in the arbor, with her dolly in her lap, looking so disconsolate. I spoke to her over the fence, and Mrs. Ashe heard my voice, and opened the upstairs window and called to me. She said Amy had never had the fever, and that the very idea of her having it frightened her to death. She is such a delicate child, you know.\"  \"Oh, poor Mrs. Ashe!\" cried Clover; \"I am so sorry for her! Well, Katy, what did you do?\"  \"I hope I didn't do wrong, but I offered to bring Amy here. Papa won't object, I am almost sure.\"  \"Why, of course he won't. Well?\"  \"I am going back now to fetch Amy. Mrs. Ashe is to let Ellen, who hasn't been in the room with the little boy, pack a bagful of clothes and put it out on the steps, and I shall send Alexander for it by and by. You can't think how troubled poor Mrs. Ashe was. She couldn't help crying when she said that Amy was all she had left in the world. And I nearly cried too, I was so sorry for her. She was so relieved when I said that we would take Amy. You know she has a great deal of confidence in papa.\"  \"Yes, and in you too. Where will you put Amy to sleep, Katy?\"  \"What do you think would be best? In Dorry's room?\"  \"I think she'd better come in here with you, and I'll go into Dorry's room. She is used to sleeping with her mother, you know, and she would be lonely if she were left to herself.\"  \"Perhaps that will be better, only it is a great bother for you, Clovy dear.\"  \"I don't mind,\" responded Clover, cheerfully. \"I rather like to change about and try a new room once in a while. It's as good as going on a journey--almost.\"  She pushed aside the half-finished dress as she spoke, opened a drawer, took out its contents, and began to carry them across the entry to Dorry's room, doing everything with the orderly deliberation that was characteristic of whatever Clover did. Her preparations were almost complete before Katy returned, bringing with her little Amy Ashe.  Amy was a tall child of eight, with a frank, happy face, and long light hair hanging down her back. She looked like the pictures of \"Alice in Wonderland;\" but just at that moment it was a very woful little Alice indeed that she resembled, for her cheeks were stained with tears and her eyes swollen with recent crying.  \"Why, what is the matter?\" cried kind little Clover, taking Amy in her arms, and giving her a great hug. \"Aren't you glad that you are coming to make us a visit? We are.\"  \"Mamma didn't kiss me for good-by,\" sobbed the little girl. \"She didn't come downstairs at all. She just put her head out of the window and said, 'Good-by; Amy, be very good, and don't make Miss Carr any trouble,' and then she went away. I never went anywhere before without kissing mamma for good-by.\"  \"Mamma was afraid to kiss you for fear she might give you the fever,\" explained Katy, taking her turn as a comforter. \"It wasn't because she forgot. She felt worse about it than you did, I imagine. You know the thing she cares most for is that you shall not be ill as your cousin Walter is. She would rather do anything than have that happen.
