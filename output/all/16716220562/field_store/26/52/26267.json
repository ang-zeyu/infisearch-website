Lo! behold thy grandson, that becomes A hunter of those wolves, upon the shore Of the fierce stream, and cows them all with dread: Their flesh yet living sets he up to sale, Then like an aged beast to slaughter dooms. Many of life he reaves, himself of worth And goodly estimation.  Smear'd with gore Mark how he issues from the rueful wood, Leaving such havoc, that in thousand years It spreads not to prime lustihood again.\"  As one, who tidings hears of woe to come, Changes his looks perturb'd, from whate'er part The peril grasp him, so beheld I change That spirit, who had turn'd to listen, struck With sadness, soon as he had caught the word.  His visage and the other's speech did raise Desire in me to know the names of both, whereof with meek entreaty I inquir'd.  The shade, who late addrest me, thus resum'd: \"Thy wish imports that I vouchsafe to do For thy sake what thou wilt not do for mine. But since God's will is that so largely shine His grace in thee, I will be liberal too. Guido of Duca know then that I am. Envy so parch'd my blood, that had I seen A fellow man made joyous, thou hadst mark'd A livid paleness overspread my cheek. Such harvest reap I of the seed I sow'd. O man, why place thy heart where there doth need Exclusion of participants in good? This is Rinieri's spirit, this the boast And honour of the house of Calboli, Where of his worth no heritage remains. Nor his the only blood, that hath been stript ('twixt Po, the mount, the Reno, and the shore,) Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss; But in those limits such a growth has sprung Of rank and venom'd roots, as long would mock Slow culture's toil.  Where is good Liziohere Manardi, Traversalo, and Carpigna? O bastard slips of old Romagna's line! When in Bologna the low artisan, And in Faenza yon Bernardin sprouts, A gentle cyon from ignoble stem. Wonder not, Tuscan, if thou see me weep, When I recall to mind those once lov'd names, Guido of Prata, and of Azzo him That dwelt with you; Tignoso and his troop, With Traversaro's house and Anastagio's, (Each race disherited) and beside these, The ladies and the knights, the toils and ease, That witch'd us into love and courtesy; Where now such malice reigns in recreant hearts. O Brettinoro! wherefore tarriest still, Since forth of thee thy family hath gone, And many, hating evil, join'd their steps? Well doeth he, that bids his lineage cease, Bagnacavallo; Castracaro ill, And Conio worse, who care to propagate A race of Counties from such blood as theirs. Well shall ye also do, Pagani, then When from amongst you tries your demon child. Not so, howe'er, that henceforth there remain True proof of what ye were.  O Hugolin! Thou sprung of Fantolini's line! thy name Is safe, since none is look'd for after thee To cloud its lustre, warping from thy stock. But, Tuscan, go thy ways; for now I take Far more delight in weeping than in words. Such pity for your sakes hath wrung my heart.\"  We knew those gentle spirits at parting heard Our steps.  Their silence therefore of our way Assur'd us.  Soon as we had quitted them, Advancing onward, lo! a voice that seem'd Like vollied light'ning, when it rives the air, Met us, and shouted, \"Whosoever finds Will slay me,\" then fled from us, as the bolt Lanc'd sudden from a downward-rushing cloud. When it had giv'n short truce unto our hearing, Behold the other with a crash as loud As the quick-following thunder: \"Mark in me Aglauros turn'd to rock.\"  I at the sound Retreating drew more closely to my guide.  Now in mute stillness rested all the air: And thus he spake: \"There was the galling bit. But your old enemy so baits his hook, He drags you eager to him.  Hence nor curb Avails you, nor reclaiming call.  Heav'n calls And round about you wheeling courts your gaze With everlasting beauties.  Yet your eye Turns with fond doting still upon the earth. Therefore He smites you who discerneth all.\"     CANTO XV  As much as 'twixt the third hour's close and dawn, Appeareth of heav'n's sphere, that ever whirls As restless as an infant in his play, So much appear'd remaining to the sun Of his slope journey towards the western goal.  Evening was there, and here the noon of night; and full upon our forehead smote the beams. For  round the mountain, circling, so our path Had led us, that toward the sun-set now Direct we journey'd: when I felt a weight Of more exceeding splendour, than before, Press on my front.  The cause unknown, amaze Possess'd me, and both hands against my brow Lifting, I interpos'd them, as a screen, That of its gorgeous superflux of light Clipp'd the diminish'd orb. As when the ray, Striking On water or the surface clear Of mirror, leaps unto the opposite part, Ascending at a glance, e'en as it fell, (And so much differs from the stone, that falls Through equal space, as practice skill hath shown); Thus with refracted light before me seemed The ground there smitten; whence in sudden haste My sight recoil'd.  \"What is this, sire belov'd! 'Gainst which I strive to shield the sight in vain?\" Cried I, \"and which towards us moving seems?\"  \"Marvel not, if the family of heav'n,\" He answer'd, \"yet with dazzling radiance dim Thy sense it is a messenger who comes, Inviting man's ascent.  Such sights ere long, Not grievous, shall impart to thee delight, As thy perception is by nature wrought Up to their pitch.\"  The blessed angel, soon As we had reach'd him, hail'd us with glad voice: \"Here enter on a ladder far less steep Than ye have yet encounter'd.\"  We forthwith Ascending, heard behind us chanted sweet, \"Blessed the merciful,\" and \"happy thou! That conquer'st.\"  Lonely each, my guide and I Pursued our upward way; and as we went, Some profit from his words I hop'd to win, And thus of him inquiring, fram'd my speech:  \"What meant Romagna's spirit, when he spake Of bliss exclusive with no partner shar'd?\"  He straight replied: \"No wonder, since he knows, What sorrow waits on his own worst defect, If he chide others, that they less may mourn. Because ye point your wishes at a mark, Where, by communion of possessors, part Is lessen'd, envy bloweth up the sighs of men. No fear of that might touch ye, if the love Of higher sphere exalted your desire. For there, by how much more they call it ours, So much propriety of each in good Increases more, and heighten'd charity Wraps that fair cloister in a brighter flame.\"  \"Now lack I satisfaction more,\" said I, \"Than if thou hadst been silent at the first, And doubt more gathers on my lab'ring thought. How can it chance, that good distributed, The many, that possess it, makes more rich, Than if 't were shar'd by few?\"  He answering thus: \"Thy mind, reverting still to things of earth, Strikes darkness from true light.  The highest good Unlimited, ineffable, doth so speed To love, as beam to lucid body darts, Giving as much of ardour as it finds. The sempiternal effluence streams abroad Spreading, wherever charity extends. So that the more aspirants to that bliss Are multiplied, more good is there to love, And more is lov'd; as mirrors, that reflect, Each unto other, propagated light. If these my words avail not to allay Thy thirsting, Beatrice thou shalt see, Who of this want, and of all else thou hast, Shall rid thee to the full.  Provide but thou That from thy temples may be soon eras'd, E'en as the two already, those five scars, That when they pain thee worst, then kindliest heal,\"  \"Thou,\" I had said, \"content'st me,\" when I saw The other round was gain'd, and wond'ring eyes Did keep me mute.  There suddenly I seem'd By an ecstatic vision wrapt away; And in a temple saw, methought, a crowd Of many persons; and at th' entrance stood A dame, whose sweet demeanour did express A mother's love, who said, \"Child! why hast thou Dealt with us thus?  Behold thy sire and I Sorrowing have sought thee;\" and so held her peace, And straight the vision fled.  A female next Appear'd before me, down whose visage cours'd Those waters, that grief forces out from one By deep resentment stung, who seem'd to say: \"If thou, Pisistratus, be lord indeed Over this city, nam'd with such debate Of adverse gods, and whence each science sparkles, Avenge thee of those arms, whose bold embrace Hath clasp'd our daughter; \"and to fuel, meseem'd, Benign and meek, with visage undisturb'd, Her sovran spake: \"How shall we those requite, Who wish us evil, if we thus condemn The man that loves us?\"  After that I saw A multitude, in fury burning, slay With stones a stripling youth, and shout amain \"Destroy, destroy:\" and him I saw, who bow'd Heavy with death unto the ground, yet made His eyes, unfolded upward, gates to heav'n,  Praying forgiveness of th' Almighty Sire, Amidst that cruel conflict, on his foes, With looks, that With compassion to their aim.  Soon as my spirit, from her airy flight Returning, sought again the things, whose truth Depends not on her shaping, I observ'd How she had rov'd to no unreal scenes  Meanwhile the leader, who might see I mov'd, As one, who struggles to shake off his sleep, Exclaim'd: \"What ails thee, that thou canst not hold Thy footing firm, but more than half a league Hast travel'd with clos'd eyes and tott'ring gait, Like to a man by wine or sleep o'ercharg'd?\"  \"Beloved father! so thou deign,\" said I, \"To listen, I will tell thee what appear'd Before me, when so fail'd my sinking steps.\"  He thus: \"Not if thy Countenance were mask'd With hundred vizards, could a thought of thine How small soe'er, elude me.  What thou saw'st Was shown, that freely thou mightst ope thy heart To the waters of peace, that flow diffus'd From their eternal fountain.  I not ask'd, What ails theeor such cause as he doth, who Looks only with that eye which sees no more, When spiritless the body lies; but ask'd, To give fresh vigour to thy foot.

In heav'n, That largeliest of his light partakes, was I, Witness of things, which to relate again Surpasseth power of him who comes from thence; For that, so near approaching its desire Our intellect is to such depth absorb'd, That memory cannot follow.  Nathless all, That in my thoughts I of that sacred realm Could store, shall now be matter of my song.  Benign Apollo! this last labour aid, And make me such a vessel of thy worth, As thy own laurel claims of me belov'd. Thus far hath one of steep Parnassus' brows Suffic'd me; henceforth there is need of both For my remaining enterprise Do thou Enter into my bosom, and there breathe So, as when Marsyas by thy hand was dragg'd Forth from his limbs unsheath'd.  O power divine! If thou to me of shine impart so much, That of that happy realm the shadow'd form Trac'd in my thoughts I may set forth to view, Thou shalt behold me of thy favour'd tree Come to the foot, and crown myself with leaves; For to that honour thou, and my high theme Will fit me.  If but seldom, mighty Sire! To grace his triumph gathers thence a wreath Caesar or bard (more shame for human wills Deprav'd) joy to the Delphic god must spring From the Pierian foliage, when one breast Is with such thirst inspir'd.  From a small spark Great flame hath risen: after me perchance Others with better voice may pray, and gain From the Cirrhaean city answer kind.  Through diver passages, the world's bright lamp Rises to mortals, but through that which joins Four circles with the threefold cross, in best Course, and in happiest constellation set He comes, and to the worldly wax best gives Its temper and impression.  Morning there, Here eve was by almost such passage made; And whiteness had o'erspread that hemisphere, Blackness the other part; when to the left I saw Beatrice turn'd, and on the sun Gazing, as never eagle fix'd his ken. As from the first a second beam is wont To issue, and reflected upwards rise, E'en as a pilgrim bent on his return, So of her act, that through the eyesight pass'd Into my fancy, mine was form'd; and straight, Beyond our mortal wont, I fix'd mine eyes Upon the sun.  Much is allowed us there, That here exceeds our pow'r; thanks to the place Made for the dwelling of the human kind  I suffer'd it not long, and yet so long That I beheld it bick'ring sparks around, As iron that comes boiling from the fire. And suddenly upon the day appear'd A day new-ris'n, as he, who hath the power, Had with another sun bedeck'd the sky.  Her eyes fast fix'd on the eternal wheels, Beatrice stood unmov'd; and I with ken Fix'd upon her, from upward gaze remov'd At her aspect, such inwardly became As Glaucus, when he tasted of the herb, That made him peer among the ocean gods; Words may not tell of that transhuman change: And therefore let the example serve, though weak, For those whom grace hath better proof in store  If I were only what thou didst create, Then newly, Love! by whom the heav'n is rul'd, Thou know'st, who by thy light didst bear me up. Whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide, Desired Spirit! with its harmony Temper'd of thee and measur'd, charm'd mine ear, Then seem'd to me so much of heav'n to blaze With the sun's flame, that rain or flood ne'er made A lake so broad.  The newness of the sound, And that great light, inflam'd me with desire, Keener than e'er was felt, to know their cause.  Whence she who saw me, clearly as myself, To calm my troubled mind, before I ask'd, Open'd her lips, and gracious thus began: \"With false imagination thou thyself Mak'st dull, so that thou seest not the thing, Which thou hadst seen, had that been shaken off. Thou art not on the earth as thou believ'st; For light'ning scap'd from its own proper place Ne'er ran, as thou hast hither now return'd.\"  Although divested of my first-rais'd doubt, By those brief words, accompanied with smiles, Yet in new doubt was I entangled more, And said: \"Already satisfied, I rest From admiration deep, but now admire How I above those lighter bodies rise.\"  Whence, after utt'rance of a piteous sigh, She tow'rds me bent her eyes, with such a look, As on her frenzied child a mother casts; Then thus began: \"Among themselves all things Have order; and from hence the form, which makes The universe resemble God.  In this The higher creatures see the printed steps Of that eternal worth, which is the end Whither the line is drawn.  All natures lean, In this their order, diversely, some more, Some less approaching to their primal source. Thus they to different havens are mov'd on Through the vast sea of being, and each one With instinct giv'n, that bears it in its course; This to the lunar sphere directs the fire, This prompts the hearts of mortal animals, This the brute earth together knits, and binds. Nor only creatures, void of intellect, Are aim'd at by this bow; but even those, That have intelligence and love, are pierc'd. That Providence, who so well orders all, With her own light makes ever calm the heaven, In which the substance, that hath greatest speed, Is turn'd: and thither now, as to our seat Predestin'd, we are carried by the force Of that strong cord, that never looses dart, But at fair aim and glad.  Yet is it true, That as ofttimes but ill accords the form To the design of art, through sluggishness Of unreplying matter, so this course Is sometimes quitted by the creature, who Hath power, directed thus, to bend elsewhere; As from a cloud the fire is seen to fall, From its original impulse warp'd, to earth, By vicious fondness.  Thou no more admire Thy soaring, (if I rightly deem,) than lapse Of torrent downwards from a mountain's height. There would in thee for wonder be more cause, If, free of hind'rance, thou hadst fix'd thyself Below, like fire unmoving on the earth.\"  So said, she turn'd toward the heav'n her face.     CANTO II  All ye, who in small bark have following sail'd, Eager to listen, on the advent'rous track Of my proud keel, that singing cuts its way, Backward return with speed, and your own shores Revisit, nor put out to open sea, Where losing me, perchance ye may remain Bewilder'd in deep maze.  The way I pass Ne'er yet was run: Minerva breathes the gale, Apollo guides me, and another Nine To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal. Ye other few, who have outstretch'd the neck. Timely for food of angels, on which here They live, yet never know satiety, Through the deep brine ye fearless may put out Your vessel, marking, well the furrow broad Before you in the wave, that on both sides Equal returns.  Those, glorious, who pass'd o'er To Colchos, wonder'd not as ye will do, When they saw Jason following the plough.  The increate perpetual thirst, that draws Toward the realm of God's own form, bore us Swift almost as the heaven ye behold.  Beatrice upward gaz'd, and I on her, And in such space as on the notch a dart Is plac'd, then loosen'd flies, I saw myself Arriv'd, where wond'rous thing engag'd my sight. Whence she, to whom no work of mine was hid, Turning to me, with aspect glad as fair, Bespake me: \"Gratefully direct thy mind To God, through whom to this first star we come.\"  Me seem'd as if a cloud had cover'd us, Translucent, solid, firm, and polish'd bright, Like adamant, which the sun's beam had smit Within itself the ever-during pearl Receiv'd us, as the wave a ray of light Receives, and rests unbroken.  If I then Was of corporeal frame, and it transcend Our weaker thought, how one dimension thus Another could endure, which needs must be If body enter body, how much more Must the desire inflame us to behold That essence, which discovers by what means God and our nature join'd!  There will be seen That which we hold through faith, not shown by proof, But in itself intelligibly plain, E'en as the truth that man at first believes.  I answered: \"Lady! I with thoughts devout, Such as I best can frame, give thanks to Him, Who hath remov'd me from the mortal world. But tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots Upon this body, which below on earth Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?\"  She somewhat smil'd, then spake: \"If mortals err In their opinion, when the key of sense Unlocks not, surely wonder's weapon keen Ought not to pierce thee; since thou find'st, the wings Of reason to pursue the senses' flight Are short.  But what thy own thought is, declare.\"  Then I: \"What various here above appears, Is caus'd, I deem, by bodies dense or rare.\"  She then resum'd: \"Thou certainly wilt see In falsehood thy belief o'erwhelm'd, if well Thou listen to the arguments, which I Shall bring to face it.  The eighth sphere displays Numberless lights, the which in kind and size May be remark'd of different aspects; If rare or dense of that were cause alone, One single virtue then would be in all, Alike distributed, or more, or less. Different virtues needs must be the fruits Of formal principles, and these, save one, Will by thy reasoning be destroy'd.  Beside, If rarity were of that dusk the cause, Which thou inquirest, either in some part That planet must throughout be void, nor fed With its own matter; or, as bodies share Their fat and leanness, in like manner this Must in its volume change the leaves.  The first, If it were true, had through the sun's eclipse Been manifested, by transparency Of light, as through aught rare beside effus'd. But this is not.  Therefore remains to see The other cause: and if the other"]]]
