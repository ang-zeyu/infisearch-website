However, to decide that question for any given reaction is really not necessary in practice, since an error made through wrongly placing one, two, or three reactions tinder any heading is of no significance; the types acquire importance only when represented by large numbers in a record under consideration; and when many reactions fall tinder a single heading the likelihood of error, as affecting the record as a whole, is by that fact alone greatly reduced.  The whole question might more profitably be approached from another point of view: To what extent are the distinctions of this classification useful? An answer to this question can be found only in the results.    § 7. ANALYSIS OF PATHOLOGICAL MATERIAL   We present in Table IV, the results of a statistical examination of the records obtained from certain groups of normal subjects and from some groups of insane subjects.  The normal groups have been studied for the purpose of determining the frequency and manner of occurrence among normal subjects of the various of abnormal reactions. It seemed best for this purpose to consider separately the records of those subjects who gave an unusually large number of individual reactions. Fifty-three records containing fifteen or more individual reactions were found after a fairly diligent search among our normal test records. In the other groups of subjects--persons of common school education, persons of collegiate education, and children--we included no records containing more than ten individual reactions.  The more striking departures from average normal figures are indicated in the table by the use of heavy type.  This table reveals associational tendencies as occurring in connection with the psychoses studied. A better insight into the nature of these tendencies can be gained by a special analysis of the test of each clinical group.   DEMENTIA PRÆCOX  In this psychosis we find the number of individual reactions far exceeding not only that of the normal but that of any other psychosis which we studied. To a corresponding extent we find the number of the highest type of normal reactions--the common specific reactions--reduced.   TABLE IV.

While almost every type of individual reactions shows here an increase over the normal averages, the most striking increases are shown by the table to be in the groups of unclassified reactions, neologisms, sound reactions, and some types of perseveration. A further examination of the individual test records shows that there is no uniformity of associational tendencies in this clinical group, but that several tendencies are more or less frequently met with either alone or in various combinations. Yet some of these tendencies, when appearing at all prominently, are so highly characteristic of dementia præcox as to be almost pathognomonic. Among these may be mentioned: (1) the tendency to give _neologisms_, particularly those of the senseless type; (2) the tendency to give unclassified reactions largely of the _incoherent_ type; and (3) the tendency toward _stereotypy_ manifested chiefly by abnormally frequent repetitions of the same reaction. Fairly characteristic also is the occasional tendency to give sound reactions. Again, occasionally one encounters pronounced _perseveration_, and at least two of our subjects gave a good many unclassified reactions obviously due to _distraction_.  It must be noted that not infrequently cases of dementia præcox give test records that cannot be distinguished from normal. It seems that the pathological associational tendencies constitute merely a special group of symptoms, some of which may be expected to be manifest in cases which have reached a state of advanced mental deterioration, but may not necessarily be present in the early stages of the disease. On the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9172"],["title","A Study of Association in Insanity (#6)"],["body","hand there is evidence to show that these tendencies may in some cases appear among the earliest manifestations. This matter will be referred to again.  Thus the test records of dementia præcox depart from the normal not sharply but by a gradual shading off. We find similar gradual transitions between dementia præcox and other psychoses. For this work we selected cases in which the diagnoses were established with reasonable certainty. Whether or not in cases of doubtful clinical classification this association test may be of aid in determining the diagnosis, is a question that must for the present remain open.  We submit herewith copies of test records. The numbers which appear after the reactions indicate in each case the reaction type, in accordance with Table III.
