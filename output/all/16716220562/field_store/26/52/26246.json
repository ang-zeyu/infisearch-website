His is a \"mind made and set wholly on the accomplishment of greatest things.\" He knows that the looker-on will hardly accept his apology for \"being late,\" that it is in order to being \"more fit.\" Yet it is the only apology he can offer. And he is dissatisfied with his own progress. \"I am something suspicious of myself, and do take notice of a certain belatedness in me.\"  Of this frame of mind the record is the second sonnet, lines which are an inseparable part of Milton's biography--      How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,         Stol'n on his wing my three-and-twentieth year!         My hasting days fly on with full career,     But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th.     Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth         That I to manhood am arrived so near,         And inward ripeness doth much less appear,     That some more timely-happy spirits endu'th.     Yet, be it less or more, or soon or slow,         It shall be still in strictest measure even         To that same lot, however mean or high,     Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven.         All is, if I have grace to use it so,         As ever in my great Taskmaster's eye.  With aspirations thus vast, though unformed, with \"amplitude of mind to greatest deeds,\" Milton retired to his father's house in the country. Five more years of self-education, added to the seven years of academical residence, were not too much for the meditation of projects such as Milton was already conceiving. Years many more than twelve, filled with great events and distracting interests, were to pass over before the body and shape of _Paradise Lost_ was given to these imaginings.  The country retirement in which the elder Milton had fixed himself was the little village of Horton, situated in that southernmost angle of the county of Buckingham, which insinuates itself between Berks and Middlesex. Though London was only about seventeen miles distant, it was the London of Charles I., with its population of some 300,000 only; before coaches and macadamised roads; while the Colne, which flows through the village, was still a river, and not the kennel of a paper-mill. There was no lack of water and woods meadow and pasture, closes and open field, with the regal towers of Windsor--\"bosom'd high in tufted trees,\" to crown the landscape. Unbroken leisure, solitude, tranquillity of mind, surrounded by the thickets and woods, which Pliny thought indispensable to poetical meditation (Epist.9.10), no poet's career was ever commenced under more favourable auspices. The youth of Milton stands in strong contrast with the misery, turmoil, chance medley, struggle with poverty, or abandonment to dissipation, which blighted the early years of so many of our men of letters.  Milton's life is a drama in three acts. The first discovers him in the calm and peaceful retirement of Horton, of which _L'Allegro_, _Il Penseroso_, and _Lycidas_ are the expression. In the second act he is breathing the foul and heated atmosphere of party passion and religious hate, generating the lurid fires which glare in the battailous canticles of his prose pamphlets. The three great poems, _Paradise Lost_, _Paradise Regained_, and _Samson Agonistes_, are the utterance of his final period of solitary and Promethean grandeur, when, blind, destitute, friendless, he testified of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, alone before a fallen world.  In this delicious retirement of Horton, in alternate communing with nature and with books, for five years of persevering study he laid in a stock, not of learning, but of what is far above learning, of wide and accurate knowledge. Of the man whose profession is learning, it is characteristic that knowledge is its own end, and research its own reward. To Milton all knowledge, all life, virtue itself, was already only a means to a further end. He will know only \"that which is of use to know,\" and by useful, he meant that which conduced to form him for his vocation of poet.  From a very early period Milton had taken poetry to be his vocation, in the most solemn and earnest mood. The idea of this devotion was the shaping idea of his life. It was, indeed, a bent of nature, with roots drawing from deeper strata of character than any act of reasoned will, which kept him out of the professions, and now fixed him, a seeming idler, but really hard at work, in his father's house at Horton. The intimation which he had given of his purpose in the sonnet above quoted had become, in 1641, \"an inward prompting which grows daily upon me, that by labour and intent study, which I take to be my portion in this life, joined with the strong propensity of nature, I might perhaps leave something so written to after times, as they should not willingly let it die.\"  What the ultimate form of his poetic utterance shall be, he is in no hurry to decide. He will be \"long choosing,\" and quite content to be \"beginning late.\" All his care at present is to qualify himself for the lofty function to which he aspires. No lawyer, physician, statesman, ever laboured to fit himself for his profession harder than Milton strove to qualify himself for his vocation of poet. Verse-making is, to the wits, a game of ingenuity; to Milton, it is a prophetic office, towards which the will of heaven leads him. The creation he contemplates will not flow from him as the stanzas of the _Gerusalemme_ did from Tasso at twenty-one. Before he can make a poem, Milton will make himself. \"I was confirmed in this opinion, that he who would not be frustrated of his hope to write well hereafter in laudable things ought himself to be a true poem.... not presuming to sing high praises of heroic men or famous cities, unless he have in himself the experience and practise of all that which is praiseworthy.\"  Of the spontaneity, the abandon, which are supposed to be characteristic of the poetical nature, there is nothing here; all is moral purpose, precision, self-dedication. So he acquires ail knowledge, not for knowledge' sake, from the instinct of learning, the necessity for completeness, but because he is to be a poet. Nor will he only have knowledge, he will have wisdom; moral development shall go hand in hand with intellectual. A poet's soul should \"contain of good, wise, just, the perfect shape.\" He will cherish continually a pure mind in a pure body. \"I argued to myself that, if unchastity in a woman, whom St. Paul terms the glory of man, be such a scandal and dishonour, then certainly in a man, who is both the image and glory of God, it must, though commonly not so thought, be much more deflouring and dishonourable.\" There is yet a third constituent of the poetical nature; to knowledge and to virtue must be added religion. For it is from God that the poet's thoughts come. \"This is not to be obtained but by devout prayer to that Eternal Spirit that can enrich with all utterance and knowledge, and sends out his seraphim with the hallowed fire of his altar, to touch and purify the life of whom he pleases. To this must be added industrious and select reading, steady observation, and insight into all seemly and generous acts and affairs; till which in some measure be compast, I refuse not to sustain this expectation.\" Before the piety of this vow, Dr. Johnson's morosity yields for a moment, and he is forced to exclaim, \"From a promise like this, at once fervid, pious, and rational, might be expected the _Paradise Lost_.\"  Of these years of self-cultivation, of conscious moral architecture, such as Plato enacted for his ideal State, but none but Milton ever had the courage to practise, the biographer would gladly give a minute account. But the means of doing so are wanting. The poet kept no diary of his reading, such as some great students, e.g. Isaac Casaubon, have left. Nor could such a record, had it been attempted, have shown us the secret process by which the scholar's dead learning was transmuted in Milton's mind into living imagery. \"Many studious and contemplative years, altogether spent in the search of religious and civil knowledge\" is his own description of the period. \"You make many inquiries as to what I am about;\" he writes to Diodati--\"what am I thinking of? Why, with God's help, of immortality! Forgive the word, I only whisper it in your ear! Yes, I am pluming my wings for a flight.\" This was in 1637, at the end of five years of the Horton probation. The poems, which, rightly read, are strewn with autobiographical hints, are not silent as to the intention of this period. In _Paradise Regained_ (i. 196), Milton reveals himself. And in _Comus_, written at Horton, the lines 375 and following are charged with the same sentiment,--                          And wisdom's self     Oft seeks to sweet retired solitude,     Where, with her best nurse, contemplations     She plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings,     That in the various bustle of resort     Were all-to ruffled and sometimes impair'd.  That at Horton Milton \"read all the Greek and Latin writers\" is one of Johnson's careless versions of Milton's own words, \"enjoyed a complete holiday in turning over Latin and Greek authors.\" Milton read, not as a professional philologian, but as a poet and scholar, and always in the light of his secret purpose. It was not in his way to sit down to read over all the Greek and Latin writers, as Casaubon or Salmasius might do. Milton read with selection, and \"meditated,\" says Aubrey, what he read. His practice conformed to the principle he has himself laid down in the often-quoted lines (_Paradise Regained_, iv. 322)--                                Who reads     Incessantly, and to his reading brings not     A spirit and judgment equal or superior,     Uncertain and unsettled still remains,     Deep vers'd in books, and shallow in himself.  Some of Milton's Greek books have been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8770"],["title","Milton (#3)"],["body","d; his _Arattis, Lyeophron, Euripides_ (the Stepharnis of 1602), and his _Pindar_ (the Benedictus of 1620), are still extant, with marginal memoranda, which should seem to evince careful and discerning reading. One critic even thought it worth while to accuse Joshua Barnes of silently appropriating conjectural emendations from Milton's _Euripides_. But Milton's own poems are the beat evidence of his familiarity with all that is most choice in the remains of classic poetry. Though the commentators are accused of often, seeing an imitation where there is none, no commentary can point out the ever-present infusion of classical flavour, which bespeaks intimate converse far more than direct adaptation. Milton's classical allusions, says Hartley Coleridge, are amalgamated and consubstantiated with his native thought.  A commonplace book of Milton's, after having lurked unsuspected for 200 years in the archives of Netherby, has been disinterred in our own day (1874). It appears to belong partly to the end of the Horton period. It is not by any means an account of all that he is reading, but only an arrangement, under certain heads, or places of memoranda for future use. These notes are extracted from about eighty different authors, Greek, Latin, French, Italian, and English. Of Greek authors no less than sixteen are quoted. The notes are mostly notes of historical facts, seldom of thoughts, never of mere verbal expression. There is no trace in it of any intention to store up either the imagery or the language of poetry. It may be that such notes were made and entered in another volume; for the book thus accidentally preserved to us seems to refer to other similar volumes of collections. But it is more likely that no such poetical memoranda were ever made, and that Milton trusted entirely to memory for the wealth of classical allusion with which his verse is surcharged. He did not extract from the poets and the great writers whom he was daily turning over, but only from the inferior authors and secondary historians, which he read only once. Most of the material collected in the commonplace book is used in his prose pamphlets. But when so employed the facts are worked into the texture of his argument, rather than cited as extraneous witnesses.  In reading history it was his aim to get at a conspectus of the general current of affairs rather than to study minutely a special period. He tells Diodati in September, 1637, that he has studied Greek history continuously, from the beginning to the fall of Constantinople. When he tells the same friend that he has been long involved in the obscurity of the early middle ages of Italian History down to the time of the Emperor Rudolph, we learn from the commonplace book that he had only been reading the one volume of Sigonius's _Historia Regni Italici_. From the thirteenth century downwards he proposes to himself to study each Italian state in some separate history. Even before his journey to Italy he read Italian with as much ease as French. He tells us that it was by his father's advice that he had acquired these modern languages. But we can, see that they were essential parts of his own scheme of self-education, which included, in another direction, Hebrew, both Biblical and Rabbinical and even Syriac.  The intensity of his nature showed itself in his method of study. He read, not desultorily, a bit here and another there, but \"when I take up with a thing, I never pause or break it off, nor am drawn away from it by any other interest, till I have arrived at the goal I proposed to myself,\" He made breaks occasionally In this routine of study by visits to London, to see friends, to buy books, to take lessons in mathematics, to go to the theatre, or to concerts. A love of music was inherited from his father.  I have called this period, 1632-39, one of preparation, and not of production. But though the first volume of poems printed by Milton did not appear till 1645, the most considerable part of its contents was written during the period included in the present chapter.  The fame of the author of _Paradise Lost_ has overshadowed that of the author of _L'Allegro, Il Penseroso,_ and _Lycidas_. Yet had _Paradise Lost_ never been written, these three poems, with _Comus_, would have sufficed to place their author in a class apart, and above all those who had used the English language for poetical purposes before him. It is incumbent on Milton's biographer to relate the circumstances of the composition of _Comus_, as it is an incident in the life of the poet.  Milton's musical tastes had brought him the acquaintance of Henry Lawes, at that time the most celebrated composer in England. When the Earl of Bridgewater would give an entertainment at Ludlow Castle to celebrate his entry upon his office as President of Wales and the Marches, it was to Lawes that application was made to furnish the music. Lawes, as naturally, applied to his young poetical acquaintance Milton, to write the words. The entertainment was to be of that sort which was fashionable at court, and was called a Mask. In that brilliant period of court life which was inaugurated by Elisabeth and put an end to by the Civil War, a Mask was a frequent and favourite amusement. It was an exhibition in which pageantry and music predominated, but in which dialogue was introduced as accompaniment or explanation.  The dramatic Mask of the sixteenth century has been traced by the antiquaries as far back as the time of Edward III. But in its perfected shape it was a genuine offspring of the English renaissance, a cross between the vernacular mummery, or mystery-play, and the Greek drama. No great court festival was considered complete without such a public show. Many of our great dramatic writers, Beaumont, Fletcher, Ben Jonson, Middleton, Dekker, Shirley, Carew, were constrained by the fashion of the time to apply their invention to gratify this taste for decorative representation. No less an artist than Inigo Jones must occasionally stoop to construct the machinery.  The taste for grotesque pageant in the open air must have gradually died out before the general advance of refinement. The Mask by a process of evolution would have become the Opera. But it often happens that when a taste or fashion is at the point of death, it undergoes a forced and temporary revival. So it was with the Mask. In 1633, the Puritan hatred to the theatre had blazed out in Prynne's _Histriomastix_, and as a natural consequence, the loyal and cavalier portion of society threw itself into dramatic amusements of every kind. It was an unreal revival of the Mask, stimulated by political passion, in the wane of genuine taste for the fantastic and semi-barbarous pageant, in which the former age had delighted. What the imagination of the spectators was no longer equal to, was to be supplied by costliness of dress and scenery. Those last representations of the expiring Mask were the occasions of an extravagant outlay. The Inns of Court and Whitehall vied with each other in the splendour and solemnity with which they brought out,--the Lawyers, Shirley's _Triumph of Peace_,--the Court, Carew's _Coelum Britannicum_.  It was a strange caprice of fortune that made the future poet of the Puritan epic the last composer of a cavalier mask. The slight plot, or story, of _Comus_ was probably suggested to Milton by his recollection of George Peele's _Old Wives' Tale_, which he may have seen on the stage. The personage of _Comus_ was borrowed from a Latin extravaganza by a Dutch professor, whose _Comus_ was reprinted at Oxford in 1634, the very year in which Milton wrote his _Mask_. The so-called tradition collected by Oldys, of the young Egertons, who acted in _Comus_, having lost themselves in Haywood Forest on their way to Ludlow, obviously grew out of Milton's poem. However casual the suggestion, or unpromising the occasion, Milton worked out of it a strain of poetry such as had never been heard in England before. If any reader wishes to realise the immense step upon what had gone before him, which was now made by a young man of twenty-seven, he should turn over some of the most celebrated of the masks of the Jacobean period.  We have no information how _Comus_ was received when represented at Ludlow, but it found a public of readers. For Lawes, who had the MS. in his hands, was so importuned for copies that, in 1637, he caused an edition to be printed off. Not surreptitiously; for though Lawes does not say, in the dedication to Lord Brackley, that he had the author's leave to print, we are sure that he had it, only from the motto. On the title page of this edition (1637), is the line,--      Eheu! quid volui miscro mihi! floribus anstrum     Perditus--  The words are Virgil's, but the appropriation of them, and their application in this \"second intention\" is too exquisite to have been made by any but Milton.To the poems of the Horton period belong also the two pieces _L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_, and _Lycidas_. He was probably in the early stage of acquiring the language, when he superscribed the two first poems with their Italian titles. For there is no such word as \"Penseroso,\" the adjective formed from \"Pensiero\" being \"pensieroso\". Even had the word been written correctly, its signification is not that which Milton intended, viz. thoughtful, or contemplative, but anxious, full of cares, carking. The rapid purification of Milton's taste will be best perceived by comparing _L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_ of uncertain date, but written after 1632, with the _Ode on the Nativity_, written 1629. The Ode, notwith- standing its foretaste of Milton's grandeur, abounds in frigid conceits, from which the two later pieces are free. The Ode is frosty, as written in winter, within the four walls of a college chamber. The two idylls breathe the free air of spring and summer, and of the fields round Horton. They are thoroughly naturalistic; the choicest expression our language has"]]]
