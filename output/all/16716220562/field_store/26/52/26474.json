Here, too, may be found the golden mean.  Through yonder casement I discern a family circle,--the grandmother, the parents, and the children,--all flickering, shadow-like, in the glow of a wood-fire. Bluster, fierce blast, and beat, thou wintry rain, against the window-panes!  Ye cannot damp the enjoyment of that fireside. Surely my fate is hard, that I should be wandering homeless here, taking to my bosom night, and storm, and solitude, instead of wife and children. Peace, murmurer!  Doubt not that darker guests are sitting round the hearth, though the warm blaze hides all but blissful images.  Well; here is still a brighter scene. A stately mansion, illuminated for a ball, with cut-glass chandeliers and alabaster lamps in every room, and sunny landscapes hanging round the walls.  See! a coach has stopped, whence emerges a slender beauty, who, canopied by two umbrellas, glides within the portal, and vanishes amid lightsome thrills of music.  Will she ever feel the night-wind and the rain? Perhaps,--perhaps!  And will Death and Sorrow ever enter that proud mansion?  As surely as the dancers will be gay within its halls to-night.  Such thoughts sadden, yet satisfy my heart; for they teach me that the poor man, in his mean, weather-beaten hovel, without a fire to cheer him, may call the rich his brother, brethren by Sorrow, who must be an inmate of both their households,--brethren by Death, who will lead them, both to other homes.  Onward, still onward, I plunge into the night.  Now have I reached the utmost limits of the town, where the last lamp struggles feebly with the darkness, like the farthest star that stands sentinel on the borders of uncreated space.  It is strange what sensations of sublimity may spring from a very humble source.  Such are suggested by this hollow roar of a subterranean cataract, where the mighty stream of a kennel precipitates itself beneath an iron grate, and is seen no more on earth.  Listen awhile to its voice of mystery; and fancy will magnify it, till you start and smile at the illusion.  And now another sound,--the rumbling of wheels,--as the mail-coach, outward bound, rolls heavily off the pavements, and splashes through the mud and water of the road.  All night long, the poor passengers will be tossed to and fro between drowsy watch and troubled sleep, and will dream of their own quiet beds, and awake to find themselves still jolting onward.  Happier my lot, who will straightway hie me to my familiar room, and toast myself comfortably before the fire, musing, and fitfully dozing, and fancying a strangeness in such sights as all may see.  But first let me gaze at this solitary figure, who comes hitherward with a tin lantern, which throws the circular pattern of its punched holes on the ground about him. He passes fearlessly into the unknown gloom, whither I will not follow him.  This figure shall supply me with a moral, wherewith, for lack of a more appropriate one, I may wind up my sketch.  He fears not to tread the dreary path before him, because his lantern, which was kindled at the fireside of his home, will light him back to that same fireside again.  And thus we, night-wanderers through a stormy and dismal world, if we bear the lamp of Faith, enkindled at a celestial fire, it will surely lead us home to that Heaven whence its radiance was borrowed."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9217"],["title","The Lily's Quest (From \"Twice Told Tales\") (#0)"],["body","TOLD TALES                          THE LILY’S QUEST                       By Nathaniel Hawthorne    Two lovers, once upon a time, had planned a little summer-house, in the form of an antique temple, which it was their purpose to consecrate to all manner of refined and innocent enjoyments. There they would hold pleasant intercourse with one another, and the circle of their familiar friends; there they would give festivals of delicious fruit; there they would hear lightsome music, intermingled with the strains of pathos which make joy more sweet; there they would read poetry and fiction, and permit their own minds to flit away in daydreams and romance; there, in short,--for why should we shape out the vague sunshine of their hopes?--there all pure delights were to cluster like roses among the pillars of the edifice, and blossom ever new and spontaneously.  So, one breezy and cloudless afternoon, Adam Forrester and Lilias Fay set out upon a ramble over the wide estate which they were to possess together, seeking a proper site for their Temple of Happiness.  They were themselves a fair and happy spectacle, fit priest and priestess for such a shrine; although, making poetry of the pretty name of Lilias, Adam Forrester was wont to call her LILY, because her form was as fragile, and her cheek almost as pale.  As they passed, hand in hand, down the avenue of drooping elms, that led from the portal of Lilies Fay’s paternal mansion, they seemed to glance like winged creatures through the strips of sunshine, and to scatter brightness where the deep shadows fell. But, setting forth at the same time with this youthful pair, there was a dismal figure, wrapped in a black velvet cloak that might have been made of a coffin pall, and with a sombre hat, such as mourners wear, drooping its broad brim over his heavy brows.  Glancing behind them, the lovers well knew who it was that followed, but wished from their hearts that he had been elsewhere, as being a companion so strangely unsuited to their joyous errand.  It was a near relative of Lilies Fay, an old man by the name of Walter Gascoigne, who had long labored under the burden of a melancholy spirit, which was sometimes maddened into absolute insanity, and always had a tinge of it.  What a contrast between the young pilgrims of bliss and their unbidden associate! They looked as if moulded of Heaven’s sunshine, and he of earth’s gloomiest shade; they flitted along like Hope and Joy, roaming hand in hand through life; while his darksome figure stalked behind, a type of all the woeful influences which life could fling upon them.  But the three had not gone far, when they reached a spot that pleased the gentle Lily, and she paused.  “What sweeter place shall we find than this?” said she.  “Why should we seek farther for the site of our Temple?”  It was indeed a delightful spot of earth, though undistinguished by any very prominent beauties, being merely a nook in the shelter of a hill, with the prospect of a distant lake in one direction, and of a church-spire in another.  There were vistas and pathways leading onward and onward into the green woodlands, and vanishing away in the glimmering shade.  The Temple, if erected here, would look towards the west: so that the lovers could shape all sorts of magnificent dreams out of the purple, violet, and gold of the sunset sky; and few of their anticipated pleasures were dearer than this sport of fantasy.  “Yes,” said Adam Forrester, “we might seek all day, and find no lovelier spot.  We will build our Temple here.”  But their sad old companion, who had taken his stand on the very site which they proposed to cover with a marble floor, shook his head and frowned; and the young man and the Lily deemed it almost enough to blight the spot, and desecrate it for their airy Temple, that his dismal figure had thrown its shadow there.  He pointed to some scattered stones, the remnants of a former structure, and to flowers such as young girls delight to nurse in their gardens, but which had now relapsed into the wild simplicity of nature.  “Not here!” cried old Walter Gascoigne.  “Here, long ago, other mortals built their Temple of Happiness.  Seek another site for yours!”  “What!” exclaimed Lilias Fay.  “Have any ever planned such a Temple, save ourselves?”  “Poor child!” said her gloomy kinsman.  “In one shape or other, every mortal has dreamed your dream.”  Then he told the lovers, how--not, indeed, an antique Temple--but a dwelling had once stood there, and that a dark-clad guest had dwelt among its inmates, sitting forever at the fireside, and poisoning all their household mirth.  Under this type, Adam Forrester and Lilias saw that the old man spake of Sorrow.  He told of nothing that might not be recorded in the history of almost every household; and yet his hearers felt as if no sunshine ought to fall upon a spot where human grief had left so deep a stain; or, at least, that no joyous Temple should be built there.  “This is very sad,” said the Lily; sighing.  “Well, there are lovelier spots than this,” said Adam Forrester, soothingly,--“spots which sorrow has not blighted.”  So they hastened away, and the melancholy Gascoigne followed them, looking as if he had gathered up all the gloom of the deserted spot, and was hearing it as a burden of inestimable treasure.  But still they rambled on, and soon found themselves in a rocky dell, through the midst of which ran a streamlet, with ripple, and foam, and a continual voice of inarticulate joy.  It was a wild retreat, walled on either side with gray precipices, which would have frowned somewhat too sternly, had not a profusion of green shrubbery rooted itself into their crevices, and wreathed gladsome foliage around their solemn brows.  But the chief joy of the dell was in the little stream, which seemed like the presence of a blissful child, with nothing earthly to do save to babble merrily and disport itself, and make every living soul its playfellow, and throw the sunny gleams of its spirit upon all.  “Here, here is the spot!” cried the two lovers with one voice, as they reached a level space on the brink of a small cascade. “This glen was made on purpose for our Temple!”  “And the glad song of the brook will be always in our ears,” said Lilias Fay.  “And its long melody shall sing the bliss of our lifetime,” said Adam Forrester.  “Ye must build no Temple here!” murmured their dismal companion.  And there again was the old lunatic, standing just on the spot where they meant to rear their lightsome dome, and looking like the embodied symbol of some great woe, that, in forgotten days, had happened there. And, alas! there had been woe, nor that alone.  A young man, more than a hundred years before, had lured hither a girl that loved him, and on this spot had murdered her, and washed his bloody hands in the stream which sung so merrily. And ever since, the victim’s death-shrieks were often heard to echo between the cliffs.  “And see!” cried old Gascoigne, “is the stream yet pure from the stain of the murderer’s hands?”  “Methinks it has a tinge of blood,” faintly answered the Lily; and being as slight as the gossamer, she trembled and clung to her lover’s arm, whispering, “let us flee from this dreadful vale!”  “Come, then,” said Adam Forrester, as cheerily as he could; “we shall soon find a happier spot.”  They set forth again, young Pilgrims on that quest which millions--which every child of Earth--has tried in turn.  And were the Lily and her lover to be more fortunate than all those millions?  For a long time, it seemed not so.  The dismal shape of the old lunatic still glided behind them; and for every spot that looked lovely in their eyes, he had some legend of human wrong or suffering, so miserably sad, that his auditors could never afterwards connect the idea of joy with the place where it had happened.  Here, a heart-broken woman, kneeling to her child, had been spurned from his feet; here, a desolate old creature had prayed to the Evil One, and had received a fiendish malignity of soul, in answer to her prayer; here, a new-born infant, sweet blossom of life, had been found dead, with the impress of its mother’s fingers round its throat; and here, under a shattered oak, two lovers had been stricken by lightning, and fell blackened corpses in each other’s arms.  The dreary Gascoigne had a gift to know whatever evil and lamentable thing had stained the bosom of Mother Earth; and when his funereal voice had told the tale, it appeared like a prophecy of future woe, as well as a tradition of the past.  And now, by their sad demeanor, you would have fancied that the pilgrim lovers were seeking, not a temple of earthly joy, but a tomb for themselves and their posterity.  “Where in this world,” exclaimed Adam Forrester, despondingly, “shall we build our Temple of Happiness?”  “Where in this world, indeed!” repeated Lilias Fay; and being faint and weary, the more so by the heaviness of her heart, the Lily drooped her head and sat down on the summit of a knoll, repeating,  “Where in this world shall we build our Temple?”  “Ah! have you already asked yourselves that question?”  said their companion, his shaded features growing even gloomier with the smile that dwelt on them; “yet there is a place, even in this world, where ye may build it.”  While the old man spoke, Adam Forrester and Lilias had carelessly thrown their eyes around, and perceived that the spot where they had chanced to pause possessed a quiet charm, which was well enough adapted to their present mood of mind.  It was a small rise of ground, with a certain regularity of shape, that had perhaps been bestowed by art; and a group of trees, which almost surrounded it, threw their pensive shadows across and far beyond, although some softened glory of the sunshine found its way there. The ancestral mansion, wherein the lovers would dwell together, appeared on one side, and the ivied church, where they were to worship, on another."]]]
