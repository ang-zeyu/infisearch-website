Run all the guns over to the other side; we will give them a warming, and then go at her.\"  The _Sea-horse_ had hoisted signals directly those on board perceived that the lugger was starting in pursuit of the brig. Terence had informed his commanding officer of this, but O'Grady replied:  \"I know nothing about them, Terence; most likely they mane 'Good-luck to you! Chase the blackguard, and capture him.' Don't let Woods come near me, whatever you do; I don't want to hear his idea of what the signals may mane.\"  Terence had just time to stop the mate as he was coming forward.  \"The ship is signalling,\" he said.  \"I have told Captain O'Grady, sir,\" Terence replied. \"He does not know what the signal means, but has no doubt that it is instructions to capture the brig, and he means to do so.\"  The officer laughed.  \"I think myself that it would be a pity not to,\" he said; \"we shall be alongside in ten minutes. But I think it my duty to tell you what the signal is.\"  \"You can tell me what it is,\" Terence said, \"and it is possible that in the heat of action I may forget to report it to Captain O'Grady.\"  \"That is right enough, sir. I think it is the recall.\"  \"Well, I will attend to it presently,\" Terence laughed.  When within a hundred yards of the brig the troops opened a heavy musketry fire, many of the men making their way up the ratlines and so commanding the brig's deck. They were answered with a brisk fire, but the French shooting was wild, and by the shouting of orders and the confusion that prevailed on board it was evident that the privateersmen were disorganized by the sight of the troops and the capture of their consort. The brig's guns were hastily fired, as they could be brought to bear on the lugger, as she forged alongside. The sweeps had already been got in, and the lugger's eight guns poured their contents simultaneously into the brig, then a withering volley was fired, and, headed by O'Grady, the soldiers sprang on board the brig.  As they did so, however, the French flag fluttered down from the peak, and the privateersmen threw down their arms. The English broadside and volley fired at close quarters had taken terrible effect. Of the crew of eighty men thirty were killed and a large proportion of the rest wounded. The soldiers gave three hearty cheers as the flag came down.  The privateersmen were at once ordered below.  \"Lieutenant Hunter,\" O'Grady said, \"do you go on board the lugger with the left wing of the company. Mr. Woods, I think you had better stay here, there are a good many more sails to manage than there are in the lugger. One man here will be enough to steer her; we will pull at the ropes for you. Put the others on board the lugger.\"  \"By the by, Mr. Woods,\" he said, \"I see that the ship has hoisted a signal; what does it mean?\"  \"I believe that to be the recall, sir; I told Mr. O'Connor.\"  \"You ought to have reported that same to me,\" O'Grady said, severely; \"however, we will obey it at once.\"  The _Sea-horse_ was lying head to wind a mile and a half away, and the two prizes ran rapidly up to her. They were received with a tremendous cheer from the men closely packed along her bulwarks. O'Grady at once lowered a boat and was rowed to the _Sea-horse_, taking Terence with him.  \"You have done extremely well, Captain O'Grady,\" Major Harrison said, as he reached the deck, \"and I congratulate you heartily. You should, however, have obeyed the order of recall; the brig might have proved too strong for you, and, bound on service as we are, we have no right to risk valuable lives except in self-defence.\"  \"Sure I knew nothing about the signal,\" O'Grady said, with an air of innocence; \"I thought it just meant 'More power to ye! give it 'em hot!' or something of that kind. It was not until after I had taken the brig that I was told that it was an order of recall. As soon as I learned that, we came along as fast as we could to you.\"  \"But Mr. Woods must surely have known.\"  \"Mr. Woods did tell me, Major,\" Terence put in, \"but somehow I forgot to mention it to Captain O'Grady.\"  There was a laugh among the officers standing round.  \"You ought to have informed him at once, Mr. O'Connor,\" the major said, with an attempt at gravity. \"However,\" he went on, with a change of voice, \"we all owe so much to you that I must overlook it, as there can be very little doubt that had it not been for your happy idea of taking possession of the lugger we should have been obliged to surrender, for I should not have been justified in holding out until the ship sank under us. I shall not fail, in reporting the matter, to do you full credit for your share in it. Now, what is your loss, Captain O'Grady?\"  \"Three men killed and eleven wounded, sir.\"  \"And what is that of the enemy?\"  \"Thirty-two killed and about the same number of wounded, more or less. We had not time to count them before we sent them down, and I had not time afterwards, for I was occupied in obeying the order of recall. I am sorry that we have killed so many of the poor beggars, but if they had hauled down their flag when we got up with them there would have been no occasion for it. I should have told their captain that I looked upon him as an obstinate pig, but as he and his first officer were both killed, there was no use in my spaking to him.\"  \"Well, it has been a very satisfactory operation,\" the major said, \"and we are very well out of a very nasty fix. Now, you will go back to the brig, Captain O'Grady, and prepare to send the prisoners on board. We will send our boats for them. Doctor Daly and Doctor O'Flaherty will go on board with you and see to the wounded French and English. Doctor Daly will bring the worst cases on board here, and will leave O'Flaherty on the brig to look after the others. They will be better there than in this crowded ship. The first officer will remain there with you with five men, and you will retain fifty men of your own company. The second officer, with five men, will take charge of the lugger. He will have with him fifty men of Captain O'Driscol's company, under that officer. That will give us a little more room on board here. How many prisoners are there?\"  \"Counting the wounded, Major, there are about fifty of them; her crew was eighty strong to begin with. There are only some thirty, including the slightly wounded, to look after.\"  \"If the brig's hold is clear, I think that you had better take charge of them. At present you will both lie-to beside us here till we have completed our repairs, and when we make sail you are both to follow us, and keep as close as possible; and on no account, Captain O'Grady, are you to undertake any cruises on your own account.\"  \"I will bear it in mind, Major; and we will do all we can to keep up with you.\"  A laugh ran round the circle of officers at O'Grady's obstinacy in considering the _Sea-horse_ to be a fast vessel, in spite of the evidence that they had had to the contrary. The major said, gravely:  \"You will have to go under the easiest sail possible. The brig can go two feet to this craft's one, and you will only want your lower sails. If you put on more you will be running ahead and losing us at night. We shall show a light over our stern, and on no account are you to allow yourselves to lose sight of it.\"  A party of men were already at work nailing battens over the shattered stern of the _Sea-horse_. When this was done, sail-cloth was nailed over them, and a coat of pitch given to it. The operation took four hours, by which time all the other arrangements had been completed. The holds of the two privateers were found to be empty, and they learned from the French crews that the two craft had sailed from Bordeaux in company but four days previously, and that the _Sea-horse_ was the first English ship that they had come across.  \"You will remember, Captain O'Grady,\" the major said, as that officer prepared to go on board, \"that Mr. Woods is in command of the vessel, and that he is not to be interfered with in any way with regard to making or taking in sail. He has received precise instructions as to keeping near us, and your duties will be confined to keeping guard over the prisoners, and rendering such assistance to the sailors as they may require.\"  \"I understand, Major; but I suppose that in case you are attacked we may take a share in any divarsion that is going on?\"  \"I don't think that there is much chance of our being attacked, O'Grady; but if we are, instructions will be signalled to you. French privateers are not likely to interfere with us, seeing that we are together, and if by any ill-luck a French frigate should fall in with us, you will have instructions to sheer off at once, and for each of you to make your way to Lisbon as quickly as you can. You see, we have transferred four guns from each of your craft to take the place of the rotten cannon on board here, but our united forces would be of no avail at all against a frigate, which would send us to the bottom with a single broadside. We can neither run nor fight in this wretched old tub. If we do see a French frigate coming, I shall transfer the rest of the troops to the prizes and send them off at once, and leave the _Sea-horse_ to her fate. Of course we should be very crowded on board the privateers, but that would not matter for a few days. So you see the importance of keeping quite close to us, in readiness to come alongside at once if signalled to. We shall separate as soon as we leave the ship, so as to ensure at least half our force reaching its destination.\"  Captain O'Driscol took Terence with him on board the lugger, leaving his lieutenant in charge of the wing that remained on board the ship.  \"You have done credit to the company, and to my choice of you, Terence,\" he said, warmly, as they stood together on the deck of the lugger. \"I did not see anything for it but a French prison, and it would have broken my heart to be tied up there while the rest of our"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8651"],["title","With Moore at Corunna (#7)"],["body"," were fighting the French in Portugal. I thought that you would make a good officer some day in spite of your love of devilment, but I did not think that before you had been three weeks in the service you would have saved half the regiment from a French prison.\"   CHAPTER III  DISEMBARKED  As soon as the vessels were under way again it was found that the lugger was obliged to lower her main-sail to keep in her position astern of the _Sea-horse_, while the brig was forced to take in sail after sail until the whole of the upper sails had been furled.  \"It is tedious work going along like this,\" O'Driscol said; \"but it does not so much matter, because as yet we do not know where we are going to land. Sir Arthur has gone on in a fast ship to Corunna to see the Spanish Junta there, and find out what assistance we are likely to get from Northern Spain. That will be little enough. I expect they will take our money and arms and give us plenty of fine promises in return, and do nothing; that is the game they have been playing in the south, and if there were a grain of sense among our ministers they would see that it is not of the slightest use to reckon on Spain. As to Portugal, we know very little at present, but I expect there is not a pin to choose between them and the Spaniards.\"  \"Then we are not going to Lisbon?\" Terence said, in surprise.  \"I expect not. Sir Arthur won't determine anything until he joins us after his visit to Corunna, but I don't think that it will be at Lisbon, anyhow. There are strong forts guarding the mouth of the river, and ten or twelve thousand troops in the city, and a Russian fleet anchored in the port. I don't know where it will be, but I don't think that it will be Lisbon. I expect that we shall slip into some little port, land, and wait for Junot to attack us; we shall be joined, I expect, by Stewart's force, that have been fooling about for two or three months waiting for the Spaniards to make up their minds whether they will admit them into Cadiz or not. You see, at present there are only 9,000 of us, and they say that Junot has at least 50,000 in Portugal; but of course they are scattered about, and it is hardly likely that he would venture to withdraw all his garrisons from the large towns, so that the odds may not be as heavy as they look, when we meet him in the field. And I suppose that at any rate some of the Portuguese will join us. From what I hear, the peasantry are brave enough, only they have never had a chance yet of making a fight for it, owing to their miserable government, which never can make up its mind to do anything. I hope that Sir Arthur has orders, as soon as he takes Lisbon, to assume the entire control of the country and ignore the native government altogether. Even if they are worth anything, which they are sure not to be, it is better to have one head than two, and as we shall have to do all the fighting, it's just as well that we should have the whole control of things too.\"  For four days they sailed along quietly. On the morning of the fifth the signal was run up from the _Sea-horse_ for the prizes to close up to her. Mr. Woods, the mate on board the brig, at once sent a sailor up to the mast-head.  \"There is a large ship away to the south-west, sir,\" he shouted down.  \"What does she look like?\"  \"I can only see her royals and top-sails yet, but by their square cut I think that she is a ship-of-war.\"  \"Do you think she is French or English?\"  \"I cannot say for certain yet, sir, but it looks to me as if she is French. I don't think that the sails are English cut anyhow.\"  Such was evidently the opinion on board the _Sea-horse_, for as the prizes came up within a hundred yards of her they were hailed by the major through a speaking-trumpet, and ordered to keep at a distance for the present, but to be in readiness to come up alongside directly orders were given to that effect.  In another half-hour the look-out reported that he could now see the lower sails of the stranger, and had very little doubt but that it was a large French frigate. Scarcely had he done so before the two prizes were ordered to close up to the _Sea-horse_. The sea was very calm and they were able to lie alongside, and as soon as they did so the troops began to be transferred to them. In a quarter of an hour the operation was completed, Major Harrison taking his place on board the lugger; half the men were ordered below, and the prize sheered off from the _Sea-horse_.  \"The Frenchman is bearing down straight for us,\" he said to O'Driscol; \"she is bringing a breeze down with her, and in an hour she will be alongside. I shall wait another half-hour, and then we must leave the _Sea-horse_ to her fate; except for our stores she is worthless. Well, Terence, have you any suggestion to offer? You got us out of the last scrape, and though this is not quite so bad as that, it is unpleasant enough. The frigate when she comes near will see that the _Sea-horse_ is a slow sailer, and will probably leave her to be picked up at her leisure, and will go off in chase either of the brig or us. The brig is to make for the north-west and we shall steer south-east, so that she will have to make a choice between us. When we get the breeze we shall either of us give her a good dance before she catches us--that is, if the breeze is not too strong; if it is, her weight would soon bring her up to us.\"  \"Yes, Major, but perhaps she may not trouble about us at all. She would see at once that the lugger and brig are French, and if they were both to hoist French colours, and the _Sea-horse_ were to fly French colours over English, she would naturally suppose that she had been captured by us, and would go straight on her course without troubling herself further about it.\"  \"So she might, Terence. At any rate the scheme is worth trying. If they have anything like good glasses on board they could make out our colours miles away. If she held on towards us after that, there would be plenty of time for us to run, but if we saw her change her course we should know that we were safe. Your head is good for other things besides mischief, lad.\"  The lugger sailed up near the ship again, and the major gave the captain instructions to hoist a French ensign over an English one, and then, sailing near the brig, told them to hoist French colours.  \"Keep all your men down below the line of the bulwarks, O'Grady. Mr. Woods, you had better get your boat down and row alongside of the ship, and ask the captain to get the slings at work and hoist some of our stores into her; we will do the same on the other side. Tell the captain to lower a couple of his boats; also take twenty soldiers on board with you without their jackets; we will do the same, so that it may be seen that we have a strong party on board getting out the cargo.\"  In a few minutes the orders were carried out, and forty soldiers were at work on the deck of the Sea-horse, slinging up tents from below, and lowering them into the boats alongside. The approach of the frigate was anxiously watched from the decks of the prizes. The upper sails of the _Sea-horse_ had been furled, and the privateers, under the smallest possible canvas, kept abreast of her at a distance of a couple of lengths. The hull of the French frigate was now visible. \"She is very fast,\" the mate said to the major, \"and she is safe to catch one of us if the breeze she has got holds.\"  As she came nearer the feeling of anxiety heightened.  \"They ought to make out our colours now, sir.\"  Almost immediately afterwards the frigate was seen to change her course. Her head was turned more to the east. A suppressed cheer broke from the troops.  \"It is all right now, sir,\" the mate said; \"she is making for Brest. We have fooled her nicely.\"  The boats passed and repassed between the _Sea-horse_ and the prizes, and the frigate crossed a little more than a mile ahead.  \"Five-and-twenty guns a-side,\" the major said. \"By Jove! she would have made short work of us.\"  As it was not advisable to make any change in the position until the frigate was far on her way, the boats continued to pass to and fro, carrying back to the _Sea-horse_ the stores that had just been removed, until the Frenchman was five or six miles away.  \"Don't you think that we might make sail again, Captain?\" the major then hailed.  \"I think that we had better give him another hour, sir. Were she to see us making sail with the prize to the south it would excite suspicion at once, and the captain might take it into his head to come back again to inquire into it.\"  \"Half an hour will surely be sufficient,\" the major said. \"She is travelling at eight or nine knots an hour, and she is evidently bound for port. It would be unlikely in the extreme that her commander would beat back ten miles on what, after all, might be a fool's errand.\"  \"That is true enough, sir. Then in half an hour we shall be ready to sail again.\"  The major was rowed to the _Sea-horse_. \"We may as well transfer the men at once,\" he said. \"We have had a very narrow escape of it, Captain, and there is no doubt that we owe our safety entirely to the sharpness of that young ensign. We should have been sunk or taken if he had not suggested our manning the lugger in the first place, and of pretending that the ship had been captured by French privateers in the second.\"  \"You are right, Major. Another half-hour and the craft would have foundered under us; and the frigate would certainly have captured the _Sea-horse_ and one of the prizes if the Frenchman had not, as he thought, seen two privateers at work emptying our hold. He is a sharp young fellow, that.\"  \"That he is,\" the major agreed. \"He has been brought up with the regiment, and has always been up to pranks of all kinds; but he has used his wits to good purpose this time, and I have no doubt will turn out an excellent officer.\"  Before sail was made the major summoned the officers on board the _Sea-horse_.
