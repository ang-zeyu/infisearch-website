To dream of Absalom, is significant of distressing incidents. You may unconsciously fall a victim to error, and penetrate some well beloved heart with keen anguish and pain over the committal of immoral actions and the outraging of innocence. No flower of purity will ever be too sacred for you to breathe a passionate breath upon.  To dream of this, or any other disobedient character, is a warning against immoral tendencies. A father is warned by this dream to be careful of his children.  _Absence_.  To grieve over the absence of any one in your dreams, denotes that repentance for some hasty action will be the means of securing you life-long friendships.  If you rejoice over the absence of friends, it denotes that you will soon be well rid of an enemy.  _Abscess_.  To dream that you have an abscess which seems to have reached a chronic stage, you will be overwhelmed with misfortune of your own; at the same time your deepest sympathies will be enlisted for the sorrows of others.  _Absinthe_.  To come under the influence of absinthe in dreams, denotes that you will lead a merry and foolish pace with innocent companions, and waste your inheritance in prodigal lavishness on the siren, selfish fancy.  For a young woman to dream that she drinks absinthe with her lover warns her to resist his persuasions to illicit consummation of their love.  If she dreams she is drunk, she will yield up her favors without strong persuasion. (This dream typifies that you are likely to waste your energies in pleasure.)  _Abundance_.  To dream that you are possessed with an abundance; foretells that you will have no occasion to reproach Fortune, and that you will be independent of her future favors; but your domestic happiness may suffer a collapse under the strain you are likely to put upon it by your infidelity.  _Abuse_.  To dream of abusing a person, means that you will be unfortunate in your affairs, losing good money through over-bearing persistency in business relations with others.  To feel yourself abused, you will be molested in your daily pursuits by the enmity of others.  For a young woman to dream that she hears abusive language, foretells that she will fall under the ban of some person's jealousy and envy. If she uses the language herself, she will meet with unexpected rebuffs, that may fill her with mortification and remorse for her past unworthy conduct toward friends.  _Abyss_.  To dream of looking into an abyss, means that you will be confronted by threats of seizure of property, and that there will be quarrels and reproaches of a personal nature which will unfit you to meet the problems of life.  For a woman to be looking into an abyss, foretells that she will burden herself with unwelcome cares.  If she falls into the abyss her disappointment will be complete; but if she succeeds in crossing, or avoiding it, she will reinstate herself.  _Academy_.  To visit an academy in your dreams, denotes that you will regret opportunities that you have let pass through sheer idleness and indifference.  To think you own, or are an inmate of one, you will find that you are to meet easy defeat of aspirations.  You will take on knowledge, but be unable to rightly assimilate and apply it.  For a young woman or any person to return to an academy after having finished there, signifies that demands will be made which the dreamer may find himself or her self unable to meet.  _Accepted_.[6]  For a business man to dream that his proposition has been accepted, foretells that he will succeed in making a trade, which heretofore looked as if it would prove a failure.  For a lover to dream that he has been accepted by his sweetheart, denotes that he will happily wed the object of his own and others' admiration.  [6] If this dream has been occasioned by overanxiety and weakness, the contrary may be expected.  The elementary influences often play pranks upon weak and credulous minds by lying, and deceptive utterances. Therefore the dreamer should live a pure life, fortified by a strong will, thus controlling his destiny by expelling from it involuntary intrusions.  _Accident_.  To dream of an accident is a warning to avoid any mode of travel for a short period, as you are threatened with loss of life.  For an accident to befall stock, denotes that you will struggle with all your might to gain some object and then see some friend lose property of the same value in aiding your cause.  _Accordion_.  To dream of hearing the music of an accordion, denotes that you will engage in amusement which will win you from sadness and retrospection. You will by this means be enabled to take up your burden more cheerfully.  For a young woman to dream that she is playing an accordion, portends that she will win her lover by some sad occurrence; but, notwithstanding which, the same will confer lasting happiness upon her union.  If the accordion gets out of tune, she will be saddened by the illness or trouble of her lover.  _Accounts_.  To dream of having accounts presented to you for payment, you will be in a dangerous position.  You may have recourse to law to disentangle yourself.  If you pay the accounts, you will soon effect a compromise in some serious dispute.  To hold accounts against others, foretells that disagreeable contingencies will arise in your business, marring the smoothness of its management.  For a young woman book-keeper to dream of footing up accounts, denotes that she will have trouble in business, and in her love affairs; but some worthy person will persuade her to account for his happiness. She will be much respected by her present employers.  _Accuse_.[7]  To dream that you accuse any one of a mean action, denotes that you will have quarrels with those under you, and your dignity will be thrown from a high pedestal.  If you are accused, you are in danger of being guilty of distributing scandal in a sly and malicious way.  [7] See similar words in following chapters.  _Aches_.[8]  To dream that you have aches, denotes that you are halting too much in your business, and that some other person is profiting by your ideas.  For a young woman to dream that she has the heartache, foretells that she will be in sore distress over the laggardly way her lover prosecutes his suit. If it is the backache, she will encounter illness through careless exposure. If she has the headache, there will be much disquietude of mind for the risk she has taken to rid herself of rivalry.  [8] This dream is usually due to physical causes and is of little significance.  _Acid_.  To drink any acid is an adverse dream, bringing you much anxiety.  For a woman to drink aciduous liquors, denotes that she may ensnare herself with compromising situations; even health may be involved.  To see poisonous acids, some treachery against you may be discovered.  _Acorn_.  Seeing acorns in dreams, is portent of pleasant things ahead, and much gain is to be expected.  To pick them from the ground, foretells success after weary labors.  For a woman to eat them, denotes that she will rise from a station of labor to a position of ease and pleasure.  To shake them from the trees, denotes that you will rapidly attain your wishes in business or love.  To see green-growing acorns, or to see them scattered over the ground, affairs will change for the better.  Decayed or blasted acorns have import of disappointments and reverses.  To pull them green from the trees, you will injure your interests by haste and indiscretion.  _Acquaintance_.[9]  To meet an acquaintance, and converse pleasantly with him, foretells that your business will run smoothly, and there will be but little discord in your domestic affairs.  If you seem to be disputing, or engaged in loud talk, humiliations and embarrassments will whirl seethingly around you.  If you feel ashamed of meeting an acquaintance, or meet him at an inopportune time, it denotes that you will be guilty of illicitly conducting yourself, and other parties will let the secret out.  For a young woman to think that she has an extensive acquaintance, signifies that she will be the possessor of vast interests, and her love will be worthy the winning.  If her circle of acquaintances is small, she will be unlucky in gaining social favors.  [9] After dreaming of acquaintances, you may see or hear from them.  _Acquit_.  To dream that you are acquitted of a crime, denotes that you are about to come into possession of valuable property, but there is danger of a law suit before obtaining possession.  To see others acquitted, foretells that your friends will add pleasure to your labors.  _Acrobat_.  To dream of seeing acrobats, denotes that you will be prevented from carrying out hazardous schemes by the foolish fears of others.  To see yourself acrobating, you will have a sensation to answer for, and your existence will be made almost unendurable by the guying of your enemies.  To see women acrobating, denotes that your name will be maliciously and slanderously handled.  Also your business interests will be hindered.  For a young woman to dream that she sees acrobats in tights, signifies that she will court favor of men.  _Actor and Actress_.  To see in your dreams an actress, denotes that your present state will be one of unbroken pleasure and favor.  To see one in distress, you will gladly contribute your means and influence to raise a friend from misfortune and indebtedness.  If you think yourself one, you will have to work for subsistence, but your labors will be pleasantly attended.  If you dream of being in love with one, your inclination and talent will be allied with pleasure and opposed to downright toil.  To see a dead actor, or actress, your good luck will be overwhelmed in violent and insubordinate misery.  To see them wandering and penniless, foretells that your affairs will undergo a change from promise to threatenings of failure.

The weekly mail had just arrived at the Flying U ranch. Shorty, who had made the trip to Dry Lake on horseback that afternoon, tossed the bundle to the “Old Man” and was halfway to the stable when he was called back peremptorily.  “Shorty! O-h-h, Shorty! Hi!”  Shorty kicked his steaming horse in the ribs and swung round in the path, bringing up before the porch with a jerk.  “Where's this letter been?” demanded the Old Man, with some excitement. James G. Whitmore, cattleman, would have been greatly surprised had he known that his cowboys were in the habit of calling him the Old Man behind his back. James G. Whitmore did not consider himself old, though he was constrained to admit, after several hours in the saddle, that rheumatism had searched him out--because of his fourteen years of roughing it, he said. Also, there was a place on the crown of his head where the hair was thin, and growing thinner every day of his life, though he did not realize it. The thin spot showed now as he stood in the path, waving a square envelope aloft before Shorty, who regarded it with supreme indifference.  Not so Shorty's horse. He rolled his eyes till the whites showed, snorted and backed away from the fluttering, white object.  “Doggone it, where's this been?” reiterated James G., accusingly.  “How the devil do I know?” retorted Shorty, forcing his horse nearer. “In the office, most likely. I got it with the rest to-day.”  “It's two weeks old,” stormed the Old Man. “I never knew it to fail--if a letter says anybody's coming, or you're to hurry up and go somewhere to meet somebody, that letter's the one that monkeys around and comes when the last dog's hung. A letter asking yuh if yuh don't want to get rich in ten days sellin' books, or something, 'll hike along out here in no time. Doggone it!”  “You got a hurry-up order to go somewhere?” queried Shorty, mildly sympathetic.  “Worse than that,” groaned James G. “My sister's coming out to spend the summer--t'-morrow. And no cook but Patsy--and she can't eat in the mess house--and the house like a junk shop!”  “It looks like you was up against it, all right,” grinned Shorty. Shorty was a sort of foreman, and was allowed much freedom of speech.  “Somebody's got to meet her--you have Chip catch up the creams so he can go. And send some of the boys up here to help me hoe out a little. Dell ain't used to roughing it; she's just out of a medical school--got her diploma, she was telling me in the last letter before this. She'll be finding microbes by the million in this old shack. You tell Patsy I'll be late to supper--and tell him to brace up and cook something ladies like--cake and stuff. Patsy'll know. I'd give a dollar to get that little runt in the office--”  But Shorty, having heard all that it was important to know, was clattering down the long slope again to the stable. It was supper time, and Shorty was hungry. Also, there was news to tell, and he was curious to see how the boys would take it. He was just turning loose the horse when supper was called. He hurried back up the hill to the mess house, performed hasty ablutions in the tin wash basin on the bench beside the door, scrubbed his face dry on the roller towel, and took his place at the long table within.  “Any mail for me?” Jack Bates looked up from emptying the third spoon of sugar into his coffee.  “Naw--she didn't write this time, Jack.” Shorty reached a long arm for the “Mulligan stew.”  “How's the dance coming on?” asked Cal Emmett.  “I guess it's a go, all right. They've got them coons engaged to play. The hotel's fixing for a big crowd, if the weather holds like this. Chip, Old Man wants you to catch up the creams, after supper; you've got to meet the train to-morrow.”  “Which train?” demanded Chip, looking up. “Is old Dunk coming?”  “The noon train. No, he didn't say nothing about Dunk. He wants a bunch of you fellows to go up and hoe out the White House and slick it up for comp'ny--got to be done t'-night. And Patsy, Old Man says for you t' git a move on and cook something fit to eat; something that ain't plum full uh microbes.”  Shorty became suddenly engaged in cooling his coffee, enjoying the varied emotions depicted on the faces of the boys.  “Who's coming?”  “What's up?”  Shorty took two leisurely gulps before he answered:  “Old Man's sister's coming out to stay all summer--and then some, maybe. Be here to-morrow, he said.”  “Gee whiz! Is she pretty?” This from Cal Emmett.  “Hope she ain't over fifty.” This from Jack Bates.  “Hope she ain't one of them four-eyed school-ma'ams,” added Happy Jack--so called to distinguish him from Jack Bates, and also because of his dolorous visage.  “Why can't some one else haul her out?” began Chip. “Cal would like that job--and he's sure welcome to it.”  “Cal's too dangerous. He'd have the old girl dead in love before he got her over the first ridge, with them blue eyes and that pretty smile of his'n. It's up to you, Splinter--Old Man said so.”  “She'll be dead safe with Chip. HE won't make love to her,” retorted Cal.  “Wonder how old she is,” repeated Jack Bates, half emptying the syrup pitcher into his plate. Patsy had hot biscuits for supper, and Jack's especial weakness was hot biscuits and maple syrup.  “As to her age,” remarked Shorty, “it's a cinch she ain't no spring chicken, seeing she's the Old Man's sister.”  “Is she a schoolma'am?” Happy Jack's distaste for schoolma'ams dated from his tempestuous introduction to the A B C's, with their daily accompaniment of a long, thin ruler.  “No, she ain't a schoolma'am. She's a darn sight worse. She's a doctor.”  “Aw, come off!” Cal Emmett was plainly incredulous.  “That's right. Old Man said she's just finished taking a course uh medicine--what'd yuh call that?”  “Consumption, maybe--or snakes.” Weary smiled blandly across the table.  “She got a diploma, though. Now where do you get off at?”  “Yeah--that sure means she's a doctor,” groaned Cal.  “By golly, she needn't try t' pour any dope down ME,” cried a short, fat man who took life seriously--a man they called Slim, in fine irony.  “Gosh, I'd like to give her a real warm reception,” said Jack Bates, who had a reputation for mischief. “I know them Eastern folks, down t' the ground. They think cow-punchers wear horns. Yes, they do. They think we're holy terrors that eat with our six-guns beside our plates--and the like of that. They make me plum tired. I'd like to--wish we knew her brand.”  “I can tell you that,” said Chip, cynically. “There's just two bunches to choose from. There's the Sweet Young Things, that faint away at sight of a six-shooter, and squawk and catch at your arm if they see a garter snake, and blush if you happen to catch their eye suddenly, and cry if you don't take off your hat every time you see them a mile off.” Chip held out his cup for Patsy to refill.  “Yeah--I've run up against that brand--and they're sure all right. They suit ME,” remarked Cal.  “That don't seem to line up with the doctor's diploma,” commented Weary.  “Well, she's the other kind then--and if she is, the Lord have mercy on the Flying U! She'll buy her some spurs and try to rope and cut out and help brand. Maybe she'll wear double-barreled skirts and ride a man's saddle and smoke cigarettes. She'll try to go the men one better in everything, and wind up by making a darn fool of herself. Either kind's bad enough.”  “I'll bet she don't run in either bunch,” began Weary. “I'll bet she's a skinny old maid with a peaked nose and glasses, that'll round us up every Sunday and read tracts at our heads, and come down on us with both feet about tobacco hearts and whisky livers, and the evils and devils wrapped up in a cigarette paper. I seen a woman doctor, once--she was stopping at the T Down when I was line-riding for them--and say, she was a holy fright! She had us fellows going South before a week. I stampeded clean off the range, soon as my month was up.”  “Say,” interrupted Cal, “don't yuh remember that picture the Old Man got last fall, of his sister? She was the image of the Old Man--and mighty near as old.”  Chip, thinking of the morrow's drive, groaned in real anguish of spirit.  “You won't dast t' roll a cigarette comin' home, Chip,” predicted Happy Jack, mournfully. “Yuh want t' smoke double goin' in.”  “I don't THINK I'll smoke double going in,” returned Chip, dryly. “If the old girl don't like my style, why the walking isn't all taken up.”  “Say, Chip,” suggested Jack Bates, “you size her up at the depot, and, if she don't look promising, just slack the lines on Antelope Hill. The creams 'll do the rest. If they don't, we'll finish the job here.”  Shorty tactfully pushed back his chair and rose. “You fellows don't want to git too gay,” he warned. “The Old Man's just beginning to forget about the calf-shed deal.” Then he went out and shut the door after him. The boys liked Shorty; he believed in the old adage about wisdom being bliss at certain times, and the boys"]]]
