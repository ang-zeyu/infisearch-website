I determined to lose no time.  Five minutes’ delay, however, I allowed myself. I spent it in ransacking the library until I discovered a medical book which gave a description of strychnine poisoning.     CHAPTER IV. POIROT INVESTIGATES   The house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to the park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow path through the long grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. So I, accordingly, went that way. I had nearly reached the lodge, when my attention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me. It was Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he been? How did he intend to explain his absence?  He accosted me eagerly.  “My God! This is terrible! My poor wife! I have only just heard.”  “Where have you been?” I asked.  “Denby kept me late last night. It was one o’clock before we’d finished. Then I found that I’d forgotten the latch-key after all. I didn’t want to arouse the household, so Denby gave me a bed.”  “How did you hear the news?” I asked.  “Wilkins knocked Denby up to tell him. My poor Emily! She was so self-sacrificing—such a noble character. She over-taxed her strength.”  A wave of revulsion swept over me. What a consummate hypocrite the man was!  “I must hurry on,” I said, thankful that he did not ask me whither I was bound.  In a few minutes I was knocking at the door of Leastways Cottage.  Getting no answer, I repeated my summons impatiently. A window above me was cautiously opened, and Poirot himself looked out.  He gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me. In a few brief words, I explained the tragedy that had occurred, and that I wanted his help.  “Wait, my friend, I will let you in, and you shall recount to me the affair whilst I dress.”  In a few moments he had unbarred the door, and I followed him up to his room. There he installed me in a chair, and I related the whole story, keeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however insignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet.  I told him of my awakening, of Mrs. Inglethorp’s dying words, of her husband’s absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap of conversation between Mary and her mother-in-law that I had overheard, of the former quarrel between Mrs. Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard, and of the latter’s innuendoes.  I was hardly as clear as I could wish. I repeated myself several times, and occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten. Poirot smiled kindly on me.  “The mind is confused? Is it not so? Take time, _mon ami_. You are agitated; you are excited—it is but natural. Presently, when we are calmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his proper place. We will examine—and reject. Those of importance we will put on one side; those of no importance, pouf!”—he screwed up his cherub-like face, and puffed comically enough—“blow them away!”  “That’s all very well,” I objected, “but how are you going to decide what is important, and what isn’t? That always seems the difficulty to me.”  Poirot shook his head energetically. He was now arranging his moustache with exquisite care.  “Not so. _Voyons!_ One fact leads to another—so we continue. Does the next fit in with that? _A merveille!_ Good! We can proceed. This next little fact—no! Ah, that is curious! There is something missing—a link in the chain that is not there. We examine. We search. And that little curious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally, we put it here!” He made an extravagant gesture with his hand. “It is significant! It is tremendous!”  “Y—es——”  “Ah!” Poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that I quailed before it. “Beware! Peril to the detective who says: ‘It is so small—it does not matter. It will not agree. I will forget it.’ That way lies confusion! Everything matters.”  “I know. You always told me that. That’s why I have gone into all the details of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not.”  “And I am pleased with you. You have a good memory, and you have given me the facts faithfully. Of the order in which you present them, I say nothing—truly, it is deplorable! But I make allowances—you are upset. To that I attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of paramount importance.”  “What is that?” I asked.  “You have not told me if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night.”  I stared at him. Surely the war had affected the little man’s brain. He was carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and seemed wholly engrossed in the task.  “I don’t remember,” I said. “And, anyway, I don’t see——”  “You do not see? But it is of the first importance.”  “I can’t see why,” I said, rather nettled. “As far as I can remember, she didn’t eat much. She was obviously upset, and it had taken her appetite away. That was only natural.”  “Yes,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “it was only natural.”  He opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to me.  “Now I am ready. We will proceed to the château, and study matters on the spot. Excuse me, _mon ami_, you dressed in haste, and your tie is on one side. Permit me.” With a deft gesture, he rearranged it.  “_Ça y est!_ Now, shall we start?”  We hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates. Poirot stopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse of park, still glittering with morning dew.  “So beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged in sorrow, prostrated with grief.”  He looked at me keenly as he spoke, and I was aware that I reddened under his prolonged gaze.  Was the family prostrated by grief? Was the sorrow at Mrs. Inglethorp’s death so great? I realized that there was an emotional lack in the atmosphere. The dead woman had not the gift of commanding love. Her death was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately regretted.  Poirot seemed to follow my thoughts. He nodded his head gravely.  “No, you are right,” he said, “it is not as though there was a blood tie. She has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes, but she was not their own mother. Blood tells—always remember that—blood tells.”  “Poirot,” I said, “I wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night? I have been turning it over in my mind, but I can’t see how it has anything to do with the matter?”  He was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but finally he said:  “I do not mind telling you—though, as you know, it is not my habit to explain until the end is reached. The present contention is that Mrs. Inglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably administered in her coffee.”  “Yes?”  “Well, what time was the coffee served?”  “About eight o’clock.”  “Therefore she drank it between then and half-past eight—certainly not much later. Well, strychnine is a fairly rapid poison. Its effects would be felt very soon, probably in about an hour. Yet, in Mrs. Inglethorp’s case, the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five o’clock the next morning: nine hours! But a heavy meal, taken at about the same time as the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to that extent. Still, it is a possibility to be taken into account. But, according to you, she ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms do not develop until early the next morning! Now that is a curious circumstance, my friend. Something may arise at the autopsy to explain it. In the meantime, remember it.”  As we neared the house, John came out and met us. His face looked weary and haggard.  “This is a very dreadful business, Monsieur Poirot,” he said. “Hastings has explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity?”  “I comprehend perfectly.”  “You see, it is only suspicion so far. We have nothing to go upon.”  “Precisely. It is a matter of precaution only.”  John turned to me, taking out his cigarette-case, and lighting a cigarette as he did so.  “You know that fellow Inglethorp is back?”  “Yes. I met him.”  John flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding which was too much for Poirot’s feelings. He retrieved it, and buried it neatly.  “It’s jolly difficult to know how to treat him.”  “That difficulty will not exist long,” pronounced Poirot quietly.  John looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this cryptic saying. He handed the two keys which Dr. Bauerstein had given him to me.  “Show Monsieur Poirot everything he wants to see.”  “The rooms are locked?” asked Poirot.  “Dr. Bauerstein considered it advisable.”  Poirot nodded thoughtfully.  “Then he is very sure. Well, that simplifies matters for us.”  We went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience I append a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in it.  [Illustration]  Poirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute inspection of the room. He darted from one object to the other with the agility of a grasshopper. I remained by the door, fearing to obliterate any clues. Poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my forbearance.  “What have you, my friend,” he cried, “that you remain there like—how do you say it?—ah, yes, the stuck pig?”  I explained that I was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks.  “Foot-marks? But what an idea! There has already been practically an army in the room! What foot-marks are we likely to find? No, come here and aid me in my search. I will put down my little case until I need it.”  He did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised proceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and precipitated the despatch-case on the floor.  “_Eh voilà une table!_” cried Poirot. “Ah, my friend, one may live in a big house and yet have no comfort.”  After which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search.  A small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the writing-table, engaged his attention for some time."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/863"],["title","The Mysterious Affair at Styles (#6)"],["body","took out the key from the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. I saw nothing peculiar, however. It was an ordinary key of the Yale type, with a bit of twisted wire through the handle.  Next, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring himself that the bolt had really been shot. Then he went to the door opposite leading into Cynthia’s room. That door was also bolted, as I had stated. However, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening and shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution against making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed to rivet his attention. He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly whipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some minute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.  On the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small saucepan on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the saucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood near it.  I wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this. Here was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his finger into liquid, and tasted it gingerly. He made a grimace.  “Cocoa—with—I think—rum in it.”  He passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had been overturned. A reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys, and the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about.  “Ah, this is curious,” said Poirot.  “I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it.”  “You do not? Observe the lamp—the chimney is broken in two places; they lie there as they fell. But see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed to powder.”  “Well,” I said wearily, “I suppose someone must have stepped on it.”  “Exactly,” said Poirot, in an odd voice. “Someone stepped on it.”  He rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece, where he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening them—a trick of his when he was agitated.  “_Mon ami_,” he said, turning to me, “somebody stepped on that cup, grinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it contained strychnine or—which is far more serious—because it did not contain strychnine!”  I made no reply. I was bewildered, but I knew that it was no good asking him to explain. In a moment or two he roused himself, and went on with his investigations. He picked up the bunch of keys from the floor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one, very bright and shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple despatch-case. It fitted, and he opened the box, but after a moment’s hesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as well as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his own pocket.  “I have no authority to go through these papers. But it should be done—at once!”  He then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the wash-stand. Crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round stain, hardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest him particularly. He went down on his knees, examining it minutely—even going so far as to smell it.  Finally, he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube, sealing it up carefully. His next proceeding was to take out a little notebook.  “We have found in this room,” he said, writing busily, “six points of interest. Shall I enumerate them, or will you?”  “Oh, you,” I replied hastily.  “Very well, then. One, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder; two, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the floor.”  “That may have been done some time ago,” I interrupted.  “No, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee. Four, a fragment of some dark green fabric—only a thread or two, but recognizable.”  “Ah!” I cried. “That was what you sealed up in the envelope.”  “Yes. It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorp’s own dresses, and quite unimportant. We shall see. Five, _this_!” With a dramatic gesture, he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the floor by the writing-table. “It must have been done since yesterday, otherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with blotting-paper and a hot iron. One of my best hats once—but that is not to the point.”  “It was very likely done last night. We were very agitated. Or perhaps Mrs. Inglethorp herself dropped her candle.”  “You brought only one candle into the room?”  “Yes. Lawrence Cavendish was carrying it. But he was very upset. He seemed to see something over here”—I indicated the mantelpiece—“that absolutely paralysed him.”  “That is interesting,” said Poirot quickly. “Yes, it is suggestive”—his eye sweeping the whole length of the wall—“but it was not his candle that made this great patch, for you perceive that this is white grease; whereas Monsieur Lawrence’s candle, which is still on the dressing-table, is pink. On the other hand, Mrs. Inglethorp had no candlestick in the room, only a reading-lamp.”  “Then,” I said, “what do you deduce?”  To which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to use my own natural faculties.  “And the sixth point?” I asked. “I suppose it is the sample of cocoa.”  “No,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “I might have included that in the six, but I did not. No, the sixth point I will keep to myself for the present.”  He looked quickly round the room. “There is nothing more to be done here, I think, unless”—he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes in the grate. “The fire burns—and it destroys. But by chance—there might be—let us see!”  Deftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate into the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. Suddenly, he gave a faint exclamation.  “The forceps, Hastings!”  I quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a small piece of half charred paper.  “There, _mon ami!_” he cried. “What do you think of that?”  I scrutinized the fragment. This is an exact reproduction of it:—  [Illustration]  I was puzzled. It was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper. Suddenly an idea struck me.  “Poirot!” I cried. “This is a fragment of a will!”  “Exactly.”  I looked up at him sharply.  “You are not surprised?”  “No,” he said gravely, “I expected it.”  I relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away in his case, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything. My brain was in a whirl. What was this complication of a will? Who had destroyed it? The person who had left the candle grease on the floor? Obviously. But how had anyone gained admission? All the doors had been bolted on the inside.  “Now, my friend,” said Poirot briskly, “we will go. I should like to ask a few questions of the parlourmaid—Dorcas, her name is, is it not?”  We passed through Alfred Inglethorp’s room, and Poirot delayed long enough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it. We went out through that door, locking both it and that of Mrs. Inglethorp’s room as before.  I took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see, and went myself in search of Dorcas.  When I returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty.  “Poirot,” I cried, “where are you?”  “I am here, my friend.”  He had stepped outside the French window, and was standing, apparently lost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds.  “Admirable!” he murmured. “Admirable! What symmetry! Observe that crescent; and those diamonds—their neatness rejoices the eye. The spacing of the plants, also, is perfect. It has been recently done; is it not so?”  “Yes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. But come in—Dorcas is here.”  “_Eh bien, eh bien!_ Do not grudge me a moment’s satisfaction of the eye.”  “Yes, but this affair is more important.”  “And how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal importance?”  I shrugged my shoulders. There was really no arguing with him if he chose to take that line.  “You do not agree? But such things have been. Well, we will come in and interview the brave Dorcas.”  Dorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her, and her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap. She was the very model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant.  In her attitude towards Poirot, she was inclined to be suspicious, but he soon broke down her defences. He drew forward a chair.  “Pray be seated, mademoiselle.”  “Thank you, sir.”  “You have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?”  “Ten years, sir.”  “That is a long time, and very faithful service. You were much attached to her, were you not?”  “She was a very good mistress to me, sir.”  “Then you will not object to answering a few questions. I put them to you with Mr. Cavendish’s full approval.”  “Oh, certainly, sir.”  “Then I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday afternoon. Your mistress had a quarrel?”  “Yes, sir. But I don’t know that I ought——” Dorcas hesitated.  Poirot looked at her keenly.  “My good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail of that quarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are betraying your mistress’s secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary that we should know all—if we are to avenge her. Nothing can bring her back to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the murderer to justice.”  “Amen to that,” said Dorcas fiercely. “And, naming no names, there’s _one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide! And an ill day it was when first _he_ darkened the threshold.”  Poirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his business-like tone, he asked:  “Now, as to this quarrel? What is the first you heard of it?”  “Well, sir, I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday——”  “What time was that?”  “I couldn’t say exactly, sir, but it wasn’t tea-time by a long way. Perhaps four o’clock—or it may have been a bit later. "]]]
