Peter  Prangle,  the  prickly  prangly pear picker, picked        three  pecks  of  prickly  prangly pears, from the prangly        pear trees, on the pleasant prairies.    17.

Success to the successful thistle sifter.    18. We travel _sea_ and _soil_; we _pry_, we _prowl_;        We _progress_, and we _prog_ from _pole_ to _pole_.     SECTION II.  ACCENT AND EMPHASIS.  ACCENT and EMPHASIS both indicate some special stress of voice.  Accent is that stress of voice by which one _syllable_ of a word is made more prominent than others; EMPHASIS is that stress of voice by which one or more _words_ of a sentence are distinguished above the rest.  ACCENT.  The accented syllable is sometimes designated thus: ('); as, _com-mand'-ment_.  NOTE I.--Words of more than two syllables generally have two or more of them accented.  The more forcible stress of voice, is called the _Primary Accent_; and the less forcible, the _Secondary Accent_.  EXAMPLES OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ACCENT.  In the following examples the Primary Accent is designated by double accentual marks, thus:  _Ed''-u-cate'_, _ed'-u-ca''-tion_, _mul''-ti-ply'_, _mul'-ti-pli-ca''-tion_, _sat''-is-fy'_, _sat'-is-fac''-tion_, _com'-pre-hend''_, _com'-pre-hen''-sion_, _rec'-om-mend''_, _rec'-om-mend-a''-tion_, _mo''-ment-a'-ry_, _com-mun''-ni-cate'_, _com'-pli-ment''-al_, _in-dem'-ni-fi-ca''-tion_, _ex'-tem-po-ra''-ne-ous_, _coun'-ter-rev'-o-lu''-tion-a-ry_.  NOTE II.--The change of accent on the same word often changes its meaning.  EXAMPLES.    col'-league, _a partner_.   col-league', _to unite with_.   con'-duct, _behavior_.   con-duct', _to lead_.   des'-cant, _a song or tune_.   des-cant', _to comment_.   ob'-ject, _ultimate purpose_.   ob-ject', _to oppose_.   in'-ter-dict, _a prohibition_.   in-ter-dict', _to forbid_.   o'ver-throw, _ruin; defeat_.   o-ver-throw', _to throw down_.  NOTE III.--Emphatic words are often printed in _Italics_. When, however, different degrees of emphasis are to be denoted, the higher degrees are designated by the use of Capitals, LARGER or SMALLER, according to the degree of intensity.  EXAMPLES.  1. Our motto shall be, _our country_, OUR WHOLE COUNTRY, and NOTHING BUT OUR COUNTRY.  2. _Thou Child of Joy!_ SHOUT round me: let me HEAR _thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd Boy!_  3. Freedom calls you! _quick_, be ready,      Think of what your sires have done;    _Onward_, ONWARD! strong and steady,      Drive the tyrant to his den;    ON, and let the watchword be,      _Country_, HOME, and LIBERTY.  NOTE IV.--Emphasis, as before intimated, varies in degrees of intensity.  EXAMPLES OF INTENSIVE EMPHASIS.    1. He shook the fragment of his blade,        And shouted: \"VICTORY!        _Charge_, Chester, CHARGE! _On_, Stanley, ON!\"    2. A _month!_ O, for a single WEEK! I as not for _years'_, though an      AGE were _too little_ for the _much_ I have to do.    3. _Now_ for the FIGHT! _now_ for the CANNON PEAL! ONWARD! through      _blood_, and _toil_, and _cloud_, and _fire!_ _Glorious_--the SHOUT,     the SHOCK, the CRASH of STEEL, The VOLLEY'S ROLL, the ROCKET'S     BLAZING SPIRE!    4. Hear, O HEAVENS! and give ear, O EARTH!  NOTE V.--Emphasis sometimes changes the seat of accent from its ordinary position.  EXAMPLES.  There is a difference between _pos'_sibility and _prob'_ability. And behold, the angels of God _as'_cending and _de'_scending on it. For this corruptible must put on _in'_corruption, and this mortal must put on _im'_mortality. Does his conduct deserve _ap'_probation or _rep'_robation?  NOTE VI.--There are two kinds of Emphasis:--_Absolute_ and _Antithetic_. ABSOLUTE EMPHASIS is used to designate the important words of a sentence, without any direct reference to other words.  EXAMPLES OF ABSOLUTE EMPHASIS.    1.   Oh, speak to passion's raging tide,      _Speak_ and _say_: \"PEACE, BE STILL!\"    2. The UNION, it MUST and SHALL BE PRESERVED!    3.         HUSH! _breathe it not aloud_,      _The wild winds must not hear it! Yet, again_,      _I tell thee_--WE ARE FREE!                                             KNOWLES.    4. When my country shall take her place among the nations of the      earth, THEN and not TILL then, let my epitaph be written.                                                                 EMMETT.    5. If you are MEN, _follow_ ME! STRIKE DOWN _yon guard, and gain      the mountain passes._    6. OH! _shame on us_, countrymen, SHAME _on us_ ALL,        If we CRINGE to so dastard a race.    7.  This doctrine _never was received_; it NEVER CAN, _by any_   POSSIBILITY, BE RECEIVED; and, if admitted at ALL, it _must be   by_ THE TOTAL SUBVERSION OF LIBERTY!    8. Are you _Christians_, and, by upholding duelists, will you _deluge      the land with blood_, and _fill it with widows and orphans._                                                                BEECHER.    9. LIBERTY _and_ UNION, NOW _and_ FOREVER, ONE _and_ INSEPARABLE.                                                                WEBSTER.   10. _Treason!_ cried the speaker; _treason_, TREASON, TREASON,       reechoed from every part of the house.   11. _The war is inevitable_,--and LET IT COME! I repeat it,       Sir,--LET IT COME!                                                          PATRICK HENRY.   12.                            Be we _men_,      And suffer such dishonor? MEN, and wash not      The stain away in BLOOD?                                                           MISS MITFORD.   13.  O SACRED FORMS! how _proud_ you look!       How _high_ you lift your heads into the sky!       How _huge_ you are! how _mighty_ and how _free_!                                                                KNOWLES.   14. I shall know but _one_ country. The ends _I_ aim at, shall be \"My      COUNTRY'S, my GOD'S, and TRUTH'S.\"                                                                WEBSTER.  NOTE VII.--ANTITHETIC EMPHASIS is that which is founded on the contrast of one word or clause with another.  EXAMPLES OF ANTITHETIC EMPHASIS.    1. The faults of _others_ should always remind us of our _own_.    2. He desired to _protect_ his friend, not to _injure_ him.    3. But _yesterday_, the word of Caesar might      Have stood against the world; _now_ lies he there,      And none so poor to do him reverence.                                                            SHAKESPEARE.    4. A _good name_ is rather to be chosen than _great riches_.                                                                  BIBLE.    5. We can do nothing _against_ the truth; but _for_ the truth.                                                                  BIBLE.    6. He that is _slow to anger_, is better than the _mighty_; and he      that _ruleth his spirit_, than he that _taketh a city_.                                                                  BIBLE.  NOTE VIII.--The following examples contain two or more sets of Antitheses.    1. _Just men_ are only _free_, the _rest_ are _slaves_.    2. _Beauty_ is like the _flower of spring; virtue_ is like the   _stars of heaven_.    3. _Truth_ crushed to earth shall _rise_ again,        The eternal years of God are hers;      But _error_, wounded, _writhes_ in pain,        And _dies_ amid her worshipers.                                                                 BRYANT.    4. A _false balance_ is _abomination to the Lord_; but a _just      weight_ is _his delight_.                                                                  BIBLE.    5. A _friend_ can not be _known_ in _prosperity;_ and an _enemy_      can not be _hidden_ in _adversity_.    6. It is my _living sentiment_, and, by the blessing of God, it      shall be my _dying sentiment:_ INDEPENDENCE NOW, and INDEPENDENCE      FOREVER.                     "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9078"],["title","Sanders' Union Fourth Reader (#4)"],["body","                                           WEBSTER.    7. We live in _deeds_, not _years_,--in _thoughts_, not _breaths_,--in      _feelings_, not in _figures on a dial_. We should count time by      _heart throbs_. He _most lives_, who THINKS THE MOST,--FEELS THE      NOBLEST,--ACTS THE BEST.    8. _You_ have done the _mischief_, and _I_ bear the _blame_.    9. The _wise man_ is happy when he gains his _own_ approbation;      the _fool_ when he gains that of _others_.   10. We must hold _them_ as we hold the _rest_ of mankind--_enemies_      in _war_,--in _peace, friends_.                                                              JEFFERSON.  NOTE IX.--The sense of a passage is varied by changing the place of the emphasis.  EXAMPLES.    1. Has _James_ seen his brother to-day? No; but _Charles_ has.    2. Has James _seen_ his brother to-day? No; but he has _heard_      from him.    3. Has James seen _his_ brother to-day? No; but he saw _yours_.    4. Has James seen his _brother_ to-day? No; but he has seen his      _sister_.    5. Has James seen his brother _to-day_? No; but he saw him _yesterday_.  REMARK.--To determine the emphatic words of a sentence, as well as the _degree_ and _kind_ of emphasis to be employed, the reader must be governed wholly by the _sentiment_ to be expressed. The idea is sometimes entertained that emphasis consists merely in _loudness_ of tone. But it should be borne in mind that the most _intense_ emphasis may often be effectively expressed, even by a whisper.     SECTION III.  INFLECTIONS.  INFLECTIONS are turns or slides of the voice, made in reading or speaking; as; Will you go to New [Transcriber's Note: Two missing lines in printing, page 25 in original.] or to [Transcriber's Note: Remainder of paragraph is missing.]  All the various sounds of the human voice may be comprehended under the general appellation of _tones_. The principal modifications of these tones are the MONOTONE, the RISING INFLECTION, the FALLING INFLECTION, and the CIRCUMFLEX.    The Horizontal Line (--)   denotes the Monotone.   The Rising Slide    (/)    denotes the Rising Inflection.   The Falling Slide   (\\)    denotes the Falling Inflection.   The Curve           (\\_/)  denotes the Circumflex.  The MONOTONE is that sameness of sound, which arises from repeating the several words or syllables of a passage in one and the same general tone.  REMARK.--The Monotone is employed with admirable effect in the delivery of a passage that is solemn or sublime.  EXAMPLES.  1. O thou that rollest above, round as the shield of my fathers: whence are thy beams, O sun, thy everlasting light? OSSIAN.  2.   'Tis midnight's holy hour, and silence now   Is brooding, like a gentle spirit, o'er   The still and pulseless world. Hark! on the winds   The bells' deep tones are swelling; 'tis the knell   Of the departed year.                                                               PRENTICE.  3. God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of His praise.  4. Before Him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at His feet. He stood and measured the earth: He beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: His ways are everlasting. BIBLE.  5. The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handy work. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. ID.  6.   How brief is life! how passing brief!   How brief its joys and cares!   It seems to be in league with time,   And leaves us unawares.  7. The thunder rolls: be hushed the prostrate world,    While cloud to cloud returns the solemn hymn. THOMSON.  REMARK.--The inappropriate use of the monotone,--a fault into which young people naturally fall,--is a very grave and obstinate error. It is always tedious, and often even ridiculous. It should be studiously avoided.  The RISING INFLECTION is an upward turn, or slide of the voice, used in reading or speaking; as,                                          s?                                        n/                                       o/                                      s/                                     s/                                    e/   Are you prepared to recite your l/  The FALLING INFLECTION is a downward turn, or slide of the voice, used in reading or speaking; as,                 \\d                 \\o                  \\i                   \\n   What are you     \\g?  In the falling inflection, the voice should not sink below the _general pitch_; but in the rising inflection, it is raised above it.

The due degree to be employed, depends on the _nature_ of what is to be expressed. For example; if a person, under great excitement, asks another:                     t?                   s                  e                 n                r               a   Are you in e        the degree of inflection would be much greater,                                                      t?                                                   s                                                 e                                               n                                             r                                           a   than if he playfully asks: Are you in e              The former   inflection may be called _intensive_, the latter, _common_.     RULES FOR THE USE OF INFLECTIONS.   RULE I.  Direct questions, or those which may be answered by _yes_ or _no_, usually take the rising inflection; but their answers, generally, the falling.  EXAMPLES.  1. Will you meet me at the depot'? Yes`; or, I will`.  2. Did you intend to visit Boston'? No`; or, I did not`.  3. Can you explain this difficult sentence'? Yes`; I can.  4. Are they willing to remain at home'? They are`.  5. Is this a time for imbecility and inaction'? By no means`.  6. King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets'? I know that thou believest`.  7. Were the tribes of this country, when first discovered, making any progress in arts and civilization'? By no means`.  8. To purchase heaven has gold the power'?    Can gold remove the mortal hour'?    In life, can love be bought with gold'?    Are friendship's pleasures to be sold'?    No`; all that's worth a wish, a thought,    Fair virtue gives unbribed, unbought.  9. What would content you`? Talents'? No`. Enterprise'? No`. Courage'? No`. Reputation'? No`. Virtue'? No`. The man whom you would select, should possess not one, but all of these`.  NOTE I.--When the direct question becomes an appeal, and the reply to it is anticipated, it takes the intense _falling_ inflection.  EXAMPLES.  1. _Is_` he not a bold and eloquent speaker`?  2. _Can_` such inconsistent measures be adopted`?  3. _Did_` you ever hear of such cruel barbarities`?  4. _Is_ this reason`? _Is_` it law`? _Is_ it humanity`?  5. _Was_` not the gentleman's argument conclusive`?   RULE II.  Indirect questions, or those which can not be answered by _yes_ or _no_, usually take the _falling_ inflection, and their answers the same.  1. How far did you travel yesterday`? Forty miles`.  2. Which of you brought this beautiful bouquet`? Julia`.  3. Where do you intend to spend the summer`? At Saratoga`.  4. When will Charles graduate at college`? Next year`.  5. What is one of the most delightful emotions of the heart`? Gratitude`.  NOTE I.--When the"]]]
