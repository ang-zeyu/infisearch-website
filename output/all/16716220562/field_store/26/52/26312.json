Both Mr. and Mrs. Maynard were somewhat shaken by the children's tragedy, but neither thought it wise to show it.  \"Now, Mopsy Moppet,\" said her father, \"what do you think I have here?\"  He took a parcel from the mantel, and held it up.  \"I don't know,\" said Midge, trying to smile; \"what is it?\"  \"Well, it's a game,--a brand new game, and none of your poky old go-to-sleep affairs either. It's a lively, wide-awake game, that only lively, wide-awake children can play. So come one, come all!\"  They all gathered round the table, and Mr. Maynard explained the rules of the new game. Marjorie loved games, and as this was really a most interesting one, she couldn't help enjoying it, and was soon absorbed in the play. It combined the elements of both skill and chance, and caused many moments of breathless suspense, as one or another gained or lost in the count.  When it was finished, Marjorie was again her own rosy, smiling self, and though she still felt the vague weight of sorrow, she had spent a pleasant, enjoyable hour.  \"And now to bed, chickadees,\" cried their father, \"it's long past nine!\"  \"Is it really?\" exclaimed Midget, \"how the time has flown!\"  \"That's because you were my own brave girl, and tried to rise above misfortune,\" said Mr. Maynard, as he bade her good-night. \"No teary pillows to-night, girlie.\"  \"No, Father, dear, I hope not.\"  \"Just go to sleep, and dream that you have a few friends still east of the Rockies.\"  \"More than I'll ever have west of them,\" responded Marjorie, and then with her arm round Kitty's waist, the two girls went upstairs to bed.  The next morning at the breakfast table, Mr. Maynard made a sudden and unexpected announcement.  \"Mother Maynard,\" he said, \"if you can spare your eldest daughter, I think I'll borrow her for the day.\"  \"What!\" cried Marjorie, looking up in surprise.  \"You may have her,\" said Mrs. Maynard, smiling, \"if you'll return her safely.\"  \"Oh, I can't promise that. I'm of rather careless habits, and I might mislay her somewhere.\"  \"Well, I'll trust you for this once. Mops, do you want to go to town with Father?\"  Marjorie's eyes flashed an answer, and Kitty exclaimed:  \"Without us?\"  \"I grieve to disappoint you, Kitsie,\" said Mr. Maynard, \"but you still have your friend Dorothy. Midget is cruelly deprived of her chum, and so for one day she is going to put up with a doddering old gentleman instead. Get your bonnet and shawl, my child.\"  Marjorie looked at her mother for confirmation of this good news, and receiving an answering smile, she excused herself from the table and ran away to her room. Nannie helped her, and soon she tripped downstairs prettily dressed in a dark blue cloth frock and jacket, a blue felt hat, and her Christmas furs.  \"Whew! what a fine lady!\" said her father. \"I shall have to don my best hat and feathers, I think.\"  \"I've lost my chum, too,\" said King, as he watched the pair about to start.  \"Yes, you have, my boy, but he wasn't your 'perfectly darling confidential friend,' as girls' chums are! Moreover, you haven't shed such gallons of first-class well-salted tears as this young person has. No, Son, I'm sorry to leave you behind, but you didn't weep and wail loud enough!\"  King had to laugh at the way his father put it, but he well knew Marjorie was given a day's pleasure to divert her mind from Gladys's departure, and he didn't begrudge his sister the trip.  \"We must be extra kind to old Midge, Kit,\" he said, as Marjorie and her father walked briskly down the drive.  \"Yes,\" said Kitty, earnestly, \"she does feel awful about losing Gladys. I'm going to make fudge for her, while she's gone to-day.\"  \"I wish I could do something for her. Boys are no good!\"  \"You are too!\" cried loyal little Kitty. \"You can help her with her arithmetic every night. She can do it all right, if she has a little help, and Glad used to help her a lot.\"  \"Good for you, Kitsie! of course I will. Dear old Midge, I'm terrible sorry for her.\"  Meantime, Marjorie, by her father's side, was rushing along in the train to New York.  While Mr. Maynard read his paper, he glanced sometimes at his daughter, and rejoiced that she was interestedly gazing out of the window at the flying scenery.  Occasionally, she turned and smiled at him, but she said little, and he knew she was being brave and trying not to think too much about her loss.  Gladys had gone away early and when they had passed the closed and deserted-looking Fulton house, Marjorie had swallowed hard and looked the other way.  But once in New York, the child had no time to think of anything but the present hour, so full of joy was the whole day.  \"My time is yours,\" announced Mr. Maynard, as they reached the city. \"I've telephoned to the office that I won't be there at all today, so what shall we do?\"  \"Oh, Father, a whole Ourday, all for you and me?\" Marjorie's eyes danced at this unheard of experience.  \"Yes, Midget; partly because I'm sorry for my troubled little girl, and partly because you _are_ bearing your trouble bravely and cheerfully.\"  \"Who wouldn't be cheerful, with a whole Ourday, and a whole father, all to myself!\"  \"Well, you'll probably never have another, alone with me. So make the most of it. Where shall we go first?\"  \"Oh, I don't know; it's all so lovely.\"  \"Then I'll choose. Step this way, Madame.\"  This way, was toward a line of waiting taxicabs, and Mr. Maynard engaged one, and handed Marjorie in.  \"A taxy ride! Oh, lovely!\" she cried, as they started off at a fine pace.  On they went, spinning across town, till they reached Fifth Avenue, and turned up that broad thoroughfare.  Marjorie enjoyed every minute, and looked out of the open window at the bustling city life all about. Up town they went for blocks and blocks, and stopped at the Metropolitan Art Museum.  They went in here, after Mr. Maynard had dismissed the cab, and staid the rest of the morning.  Marjorie, perhaps, would not have cared so much for the pictures and statues had she been alone; but her father called her attention to certain ones, and told her about them in such a way, that she was amused and instructed both.  They looked at strange and curious relics of ancient times; they studied the small models of the world's greatest buildings; and they lingered in the hall full of casts of the noblest statues of all time.  \"Hungry, Chickadee?\" said Mr. Maynard, at last, looking at his watch.  \"Why, yes, I believe I am; but I hadn't thought of it.\"  \"I'm glad you are, for I can assure you I am. Suppose we make a mad dash for a pie-shop.\"  \"Come on,\" said Marjorie, and away they went, through the turnstiles, and out upon Fifth Avenue again.  Mr. Maynard hailed a motor-omnibus, and Marjorie carefully climbed the spiral staircase at the back. Her father followed, and sitting up on top of the 'bus, in the crisp, wintry air and bright sunshine, they went whizzing down the avenue.  \"Isn't it fun, Father!\" said Marjorie, as she held tightly to his arm.  \"Yes, and there's a fine view to-day.\" He pointed out many famous buildings, and when they neared a large hotel, he said:  \"We'll have to get out, Midge. I shall pine away with hunger before another block.\"  \"Out we go!\" was the reply, and they clambered down the twisty stair.  \"Is there anything that would tempt your appetite, Miss Maynard?\" said her father, as, seated at a small round table, he looked over the menu.  \"No, thank you; I don't think I can eat a thing!\" said Midge, dropping her eyes, and trying to look fragile and delicate.  \"No? But really, you must try to taste of something. Say, the left wing of a butterfly, with hard sauce.\"  This made Marjorie laugh, and she said, \"I couldn't eat it all, but I might nibble at it.\"  Then what Mr. Maynard really did, was to order Marjorie's favourite dishes.  First, they had grape-fruit, all cut in bits, and piled up in dainty, long-stemmed glasses. Then, they had a soft, thick soup, and then sweetbreads with mushrooms.  \"You're not to get ill, you know,\" said Mr. Maynard, as Marjorie showed a surprising appetite, \"but I do want you to have whatever you like to-day.\"  \"Oh, I won't get ill,\" declared Marjorie, gaily, \"and now, may I select the ice cream?\"  \"Yes, if you won't ask for plum pudding also.\"  \"No, but I do want little cakes, iced all over. Pink and green and white and yellow ones.\"  These were allowed, and Marjorie blissfully kept on nibbling them, while Mr. Maynard sipped his coffee. In the afternoon they went to a matinée. It was one of the gorgeous spectacular productions, founded upon an old fairy tale, and Marjorie was enraptured with the beautiful tableaux, the wonderful scenery, and the gay music.  \"Oh, Father,\" she said, \"aren't we having the gorgeousest time! You are the beautifulest man in the whole world!\"  After the performance, Mr. Maynard spoke of going home, but Marjorie's eyes held a mute appeal, which he could not resist.  \"Ice cream _again!_\" he said, though she had not spoken the words. \"Well, ice cream it is, then, but no rich cakes this time. I promised Motherdy I'd bring you home safe and sound. But I'll tell you, we'll buy some of those cakes to take home, and you may have them to-morrow.\"  \"And Kitty and King, too,\" said Midge. \"And let's take them some buttercups.\"  So the candy and cakes were bought and carried home by two tired but very happy people, and Marjorie fully appreciated the lovely day her father had given her, because of Gladys's going away.  \"And I _will_ be good and brave,\" she resolved to herself, on her way home in the train. \"I'm going to try to be just as cheerful and pleasant as If Gladys hadn't gone away at all, but was in her own house, across the street.\"     CHAPTER VII  THE COMING OF DELIGHT   But though Marjorie made her brave resolutions in good faith, it was hard to keep them. School was awful. The very sight of Gladys's empty seat made Midge choke with tears.

Richardson, Jr.     PRODUCTION NOTES: First published in French in 1770 under the pseudonym of Mirabaud. This e-book based on a facsimile reprint of an English translation originally published 1820-21. This e-text covers the first of the original two volumes.      INTRODUCTION   Paul Henri Thiery, Baron d'Holbach (1723-1789), was the center of the radical wing of the _philosophes_. He was friend, host, and patron to a wide circle that included Diderot, D'Alembert, Helvetius, and Hume. Holbach wrote, translated, edited, and issued a stream of books and pamphlets, often under other names, that has made him the despair of bibliographers but has connected his name, by innuendo, gossip, and association, with most of what was written in defense of atheistic materialism in late eighteenth-century France.  Holbach is best known for _The System of Nature_ (1770) and deservedly, since it is a clear and reasonably systematic exposition of his main ideas. His initial position determines all the rest of his argument. \"There is not, there can be nothing out of that Nature which includes all beings.\" Conceiving of nature as strictly limited to matter and motion, both of which have always existed, he flatly denies that there is any such thing as spirit or a supernatural. Mythology began, Holbach claims, when men were still in a state of nature and at the point when wise, strong, and for the most part benign men were arising as leaders and lawgivers. These leaders \"formed discourses by which they spoke to the imaginations of their willing auditors,\" using the medium of poetry, because it \"seem{ed} best adapted to strike the mind.\" Through poetry, then, and by means of \"its images, its fictions, its numbers, its rhyme, its harmony... the entire of nature, as well as all its parts, was personified, by its beautiful allegories.\" Thus mythology is given an essentially political origin. These early poets are literally legislators of mankind. \"The first institutors of nations, and their immediate successors in authority, only spoke to the people by fables, allegories, enigmas, of which they reserved to themselves the right of giving an explanation.\" Holbach is rather condescending about the process, but since mythology is a representation of nature itself, he is far more tolerant of mythology than he is of the next step. \"Natural philosophers and poets were transformed by leisure into metaphysicians and theologians,\" and at this point a fatal error was introduced: the theologians made a distinction between the power of nature and nature itself, separated the two, made the power of nature prior to nature, and called it God. Thus man was left with an abstract and chimerical being on one side and a despoiled inert nature, destitute of power, on the other. In Holbach's critique the point at which theology split off from mythology marks the moment of nature's alienation from itself and paves the way for man's alienation from nature.  Holbach is thus significant for Romantic interest in myth in two ways. First, he provides a clear statement of what can be loosely called the antimythic position, that rationalist condescension and derogation of all myth and all religion that was never far from the surface during the Romantic era. Holbach was and is a reminder that the Romantic affirmation of myth was never easy, uncritical, or unopposed. Any new endorsement of myth had to be made in the teeth of Holbach and the other skeptics. The very vigor of the Holbachian critique of myth impelled the Romantics to think more deeply and defend more carefully any new claim for myth. Secondly, although Holbach's argument generally drove against myth and religion both, he did make an important, indeed a saving distinction between mythology and theology. Mythology is the more or less harmless personification of the power in and of nature; theology concerns itself with what for Holbach was the nonexistent power beyond or behind nature. By exploiting this distinction it would become possible for a Shelley, for example, to take a strong antitheological--even an anti-Christian--position without having to abandon myth.  Holbach was one of William Godwin's major sources for his ideas about political justice, and Shelley, who discussed Holbach with Godwin, quotes extensively from _The System of Nature_ in _Queen Mab_. Furthermore, Volney's _Ruins_, another important book for Shelley, is directly descended from _The System of Nature_. On the other side, Holbach was a standing challenge to such writers as Coleridge and Goethe and was reprinted and retranslated extensively in America, where his work was well known to the rationalist circle around Jefferson and Barlow.  Issued in 1770 as though by Jean Baptiste de Mirabaud (a former perpetual secretary to the Académie française who had died ten years before), _La Système de la nature_ was translated and reprinted frequently. The Samuel Wilkinson translation we have chosen to reprint was the most often reprinted or pirated version in English. A useful starting point for Holbach's work is Jerome Vercruysse, _Bibliographie descriptive des écrits du baron d'Holbach_ (Paris, 1971). The difficult subject of the essentially clandestine evolution of biblical criticism as an anti-Christian and antimyth critique in the early part of the eighteenth century, before the well-documented era of the biblical critic Eichhorn in Germany, is illuminated in Ira Wade, _The Clandestine Organization and Diffusion of Philosophic Ideas in France from 1700-1750_ (Princeton Univ. Press, 1938).   Robert D. Richardson, Jr.  University of Denver   * * * * *    {Illustration: Parke sculp't M.

PREFACE  _The source of man's unhappiness is his ignorance of Nature. The pertinacity with which he clings to blind opinions imbibed in his infancy, which interweave themselves with his existence, the consequent prejudice that warps his mind, that prevents its expansion, that renders him the slave of fiction, appears to doom him to continual error. He resembles a child destitute of experience, full of ideal notions: a dangerous leaven mixes itself with all his knowledge: it is of necessity obscure, it is vacillating and false:--He takes the tone of his ideas on the authority of others, who are themselves in error, or else have an interest in deceiving him. To remove this Cimmerian darkness, these barriers to the improvement of his condition; to disentangle him from the clouds of error that envelope him; to guide him out of this Cretan labyrinth, requires the clue of Ariadne, with all the love she could bestow on Theseus. It exacts more than common exertion; it needs a most determined, a most undaunted courage--it is never effected but by a persevering resolution to act, to think for himself; to examine with rigour and impartiality the opinions he has adopted. He will find that the most noxious weeds have sprung up beside beautiful flowers; entwined themselves around their stems, overshadowed them with an exuberance of foliage, choaked the ground, enfeebled their growth, diminished their petals; dimmed the brilliancy of their colours; that deceived by their apparent freshness of their verdure, by the rapidity of their exfoliation, he has given them cultivation, watered them, nurtured them, when he ought to have plucked out their very roots.  Man seeks to range out of his sphere: notwithstanding the reiterated checks his ambitious folly experiences, he still attempts the impossible; strives to carry his researches beyond the visible world; and hunts out misery in imaginary regions. He would be a metaphysician before he has become a practical philosopher. He quits the contemplation of realities to meditate on chimeras. He neglects experience to feed on conjecture, to indulge in hypothesis. He dares not cultivate his reason, because from his earliest days he has been taught to consider it criminal. He pretends to know his date in the indistinct abodes of another life, before he has considered of the means by"]]]
