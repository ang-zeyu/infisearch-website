His sensations were precisely those of a leading actor in an earthquake. The solid earth seemed to melt under him.  “We talked it over last night after you had gone to bed, and we came to the conclusion that there was only one honorable step to take. We must make good your losses. We must buy back those shares.”  A ray of hope began to steal over Roland's horizon.  “But----” he began.  “There are no buts, really, Mr. Bleke. We should neither of us know a minute's peace if we didn't do it. Now, you paid thirty thousand pounds for the shares, you said? Well”--she held out a pink slip of paper to him--“this will make everything all right.”  Roland looked at the check.  “But--but this is signed by you,” he said.  “Yes. You see, if Geoffrey had to sign a check for that amount, it would mean selling out some of his stock, and in his position, with every movement watched by enemies, he can not afford to do it. It might ruin the plans of years. But I have some money of my own. My selling out stock doesn't matter, you see. I have post-dated the check a week, to give me time to realize on the securities in which my money is invested.”  Roland's whole nature rose in revolt at this sacrifice. If it had been his host who had made this offer, he would have accepted it. But chivalry forbade his taking this money from a woman. A glow of self-sacrifice warmed him. After all, what was this money of his? He had never had any fun out of it. He had had so little acquaintance with it that for all practical purposes it might never have been his.  With a gesture which had once impressed him very favorably when exhibited on the stage by the hero of the number two company of “The Price of Honor,” which had paid a six days' visit to Bury St. Edwards a few months before, he tore the check into little pieces.  “I couldn't accept it, Mrs. Windlebird,” he said. “I can't tell you how deeply I appreciate your wonderful kindness, but I really couldn't. I bought the shares with my eyes open. The whole thing is nobody's fault, and I can't let you suffer for it. After the way you have treated me here, it would be impossible. I can't take your money. It's noble and generous of you in the extreme, but I can't accept it. I've still got a little money left, and I've always been used to working for my living, anyway, so--so it's all right.”  “Mr. Bleke, I implore you.”  Roland was hideously embarrassed. He looked right and left for a way of escape. He could hardly take to his heels, and yet there seemed no other way of ending the interview. Then, with a start of relief, he perceived Johnson the groom coming toward him with the evening paper.  “Johnson said he was going into the town,” said Roland apologetically, “so I asked him to get me an evening paper. I wanted to see the lunch scores.”  If he had been looking at his hostess then, an action which he was strenuously avoiding, he might have seen a curious spasm pass over her face. Mrs. Windlebird turned very pale and sat down suddenly in the chair which Roland had vacated at the beginning of their conversation. She lay back in it with her eyes closed. She looked tired and defeated.  Roland took the paper mechanically. He wanted it as a diversion to the conversation merely, for his interest in the doings of Surrey and Yorkshire had waned to the point of complete indifference in competition with Mrs. Windlebird's news.  Equally mechanically he unfolded it and glanced at front page; and, as he did do, a flaring explosion of headlines smote his eye.  Out of the explosion emerged the word “WILD-CATS”.  “Why!” he exclaimed. “There's columns about Wild-cats on the front page here!”  “Yes?” Mrs. Windlebird's voice sounded strangely dull and toneless. Her eyes were still closed.  Roland took in the headlines with starting eyes.         THE WILD-CAT REEF GOLD-MINE              ANOTHER KLONDIKE      FRENZIED SCENES ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE           BROKERS FIGHT FOR SHARES                RECORD BOOM        UNPRECEDENTED RISE IN PRICES  Shorn of all superfluous adjectives and general journalistic exuberance, what the paper had to announce to its readers was this:      The “special commissioner” sent out by The _Financial Argus_ to     make an exhaustive examination of the Wild-cat Reef Mine--with     the amiable view, no doubt, of exploding Mr. Geoffrey Windlebird     once and for all with the confiding British public--has found,     to his unbounded astonishment, that there are vast quantities of     gold in the mine.      The discovery of the new reef, the largest and richest, it is     stated, since the famous Mount Morgan, occurred with dramatic     appropriateness on the very day of his arrival. We need scarcely     remind our readers that, until that moment, Wild-cat Reef shares     had reached a very low figure, and only a few optimists retained     their faith in the mine. As the largest holder, Mr. Windlebird     is to be heartily congratulated on this new addition to his     fortune.      The publication of the expert's report in The _Financial Argus_ has     resulted in a boom in Wild-cats, the like of which can seldom have     been seen on the Stock Exchange. From something like one shilling     and sixpence per bundle the one pound shares have gone up to nearly     ten pounds a share, and even at this latter figure people were     literally fighting to secure them.  The world swam about Roland. He was stupefied and even terrified. The very atmosphere seemed foggy. So far as his reeling brain was capable of thought, he figured that he was now worth about two hundred thousand pounds.  “Oh, Mrs. Windlebird,” he cried, “It's all right after all.”  Mrs. Windlebird sat back in her chair without answering.  “It's all right for every one,” screamed Roland joyfully. “Why, if I've made a couple of hundred thousand, what must Mr. Windlebird have netted. It says here that he is the largest holder. He must have pulled off the biggest thing of his life.”  He thought for a moment.  “The chap I'm sorry for,” he said meditatively, “is Mr. Windlebird's pal. You know. The fellow whom Mr. Windlebird persuaded to sell all his shares to me.”  A faint moan escaped from his hostess's pale lips. Roland did not hear it. He was reading the cricket news.      THE EPISODE OF THE THEATRICAL VENTURE  Third of a Series of Six Stories [First published in _Pictorial Review_, July 1916]   It was one of those hard, nubbly rolls. The best restaurants charge you sixpence for having the good sense not to eat them. It hit Roland Bleke with considerable vehemence on the bridge of the nose. For the moment Roland fancied that the roof of the Regent Grill-room must have fallen in; and, as this would automatically put an end to the party, he was not altogether sorry. He had never been to a theatrical supper-party before, and within five minutes of his arrival at the present one he had become afflicted with an intense desire never to go to a theatrical supper-party again. To be a success at these gay gatherings one must possess dash; and Roland, whatever his other sterling qualities, was a little short of dash.  The young man on the other side of the table was quite nice about it. While not actually apologizing, he went so far as to explain that it was “old Gerry” whom he had had in his mind when he started the roll on its course. After a glance at old Gerry--a chinless child of about nineteen--Roland felt that it would be churlish to be angry with a young man whose intentions had been so wholly admirable. Old Gerry had one of those faces in which any alteration, even the comparatively limited one which a roll would be capable of producing, was bound to be for the better. He smiled a sickly smile and said that it didn't matter.  The charming creature who sat on his assailant's left, however, took a more serious view of the situation.  “Sidney, you make me tired,” she said severely. “If I had thought you didn't know how to act like a gentleman I wouldn't have come here with you. Go away somewhere and throw bread at yourself, and ask Mr. Bleke to come and sit by me. I want to talk to him.”  That was Roland's first introduction to Miss Billy Verepoint.  “I've been wanting to have a chat with you all the evening, Mr. Bleke,”  she said, as Roland blushingly sank into the empty chair. “I've heard such a lot about you.”  What Miss Verepoint had heard about Roland was that he had two hundred thousand pounds and apparently did not know what to do with it.  “In fact, if I hadn't been told that you would be here, I shouldn't have come to this party. Can't stand these gatherings of nuts in May as a general rule. They bore me stiff.”  Roland hastily revised his first estimate of the theatrical profession. Shallow, empty-headed creatures some of them might be, no doubt, but there were exceptions. Here was a girl of real discernment--a thoughtful student of character--a girl who understood that a man might sit at a supper-party without uttering a word and might still be a man of parts.  “I'm afraid you'll think me very outspoken--but that's me all over. All my friends say, 'Billy Verepoint's a funny girl: if she likes any one she just tells them so straight out; and if she doesn't like any one she tells them straight out, too.'”  “And a very admirable trait,” said Roland, enthusiastically.  Miss Verepoint sighed. “P'raps it is,” she said pensively, “but I'm afraid it's what has kept me back in my profession. Managers don't like it: they think girls should be seen and not heard.”  Roland's blood boiled. Managers were plainly a dastardly crew.  “But what's the good of worrying,” went on Miss Verepoint, with a brave but hollow laugh. “Of course, it's wearing, having to wait when one has got as much ambition as I have; but they all tell me that my chance is bound to come some day.”  The intense mournfulness of Miss Verepoint's expression seemed to indicate that "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8713"],["title","A Man of Means (#5)"],["body","anticipated the arrival of the desired day not less than sixty years hence. Roland was profoundly moved. His chivalrous nature was up in arms. He fell to wondering if he could do anything to help this victim of managerial unfairness. “You don't mind my going on about my troubles, do you?” asked Miss Verepoint, solicitously. “One so seldom meets anybody really sympathetic.”  Roland babbled fervent assurances, and she pressed his hand gratefully.  “I wonder if you would care to come to tea one afternoon,” she said.  “Oh, rather!” said Roland. He would have liked to put it in a more polished way but he was almost beyond speech.  “Of course, I know what a busy man you are----”  “No, no!”  “Well, I should be in to-morrow afternoon, if you cared to look in.”  Roland bleated gratefully.  “I'll write down the address for you,” said Miss Verepoint, suddenly businesslike.         *       *       *       *       *  Exactly when he committed himself to the purchase of the Windsor Theater, Roland could never say. The idea seemed to come into existence fully-grown, without preliminary discussion. One moment it was not--the next it was. His recollections of the afternoon which he spent drinking lukewarm tea and punctuating Miss Verepoint's flow of speech with “yes's” and “no's” were always so thoroughly confused that he never knew even whose suggestion it was.  The purchase of a West-end theater, when one has the necessary cash, is not nearly such a complicated business as the layman might imagine. Roland was staggered by the rapidity with which the transaction was carried through. The theater was his before he had time to realize that he had never meant to buy the thing at all. He had gone into the offices of Mr. Montague with the intention of making an offer for the lease for, say, six months; and that wizard, in the space of less than an hour, had not only induced him to sign mysterious documents which made him sole proprietor of the house, but had left him with the feeling that he had done an extremely acute stroke of business. Mr. Montague had dabbled in many professions in his time, from street peddling upward, but what he was really best at was hypnotism.  Altho he felt, after the spell of Mr. Montague's magnetism was withdrawn, rather like a nervous man who has been given a large baby to hold by a strange woman who has promptly vanished round the corner, Roland was to some extent consoled by the praise bestowed upon him by Miss Verepoint. She said it was much better to buy a theater than to rent it, because then you escaped the heavy rent. It was specious, but Roland had a dim feeling that there was a flaw somewhere in the reasoning; and it was from this point that a shadow may be said to have fallen upon the brightness of the venture.  He would have been even less self-congratulatory if he had known the Windsor Theater's reputation. Being a comparative stranger in the metropolis, he was unaware that its nickname in theatrical circles was “The Mugs' Graveyard”--a title which had been bestowed upon it not without reason. Built originally by a slightly insane old gentleman, whose principal delusion was that the public was pining for a constant supply of the Higher Drama, and more especially those specimens of the Higher Drama which flowed practically without cessation from the restless pen of the insane old gentleman himself, the Windsor Theater had passed from hand to hand with the agility of a gold watch in a gathering of race-course thieves. The one anxiety of the unhappy man who found himself, by some accident, in possession of the Windsor Theater, was to pass it on to somebody else. The only really permanent tenant it ever had was the representative of the Official Receiver.  Various causes were assigned for the phenomenal ill-luck of the theater, but undoubtedly the vital objection to it as a Temple of Drama lay in the fact that nobody could ever find the place where it was hidden. Cabmen shook their heads on the rare occasions when they were asked to take a fare there. Explorers to whom a stroll through the Australian bush was child's-play, had been known to spend an hour on its trail and finish up at the point where they had started.  It was precisely this quality of elusiveness which had first attracted Mr. Montague. He was a far-seeing man, and to him the topographical advantages of the theater were enormous. It was further from a fire-station than any other building of the same insurance value in London, even without having regard to the mystery which enveloped its whereabouts. Often after a good dinner he would lean comfortably back in his chair and see in the smoke of his cigar a vision of the Windsor Theater blazing merrily, while distracted firemen galloped madly all over London, vainly endeavoring to get some one to direct them to the scene of the conflagration. So Mr. Montague bought the theater for a mere song, and prepared to get busy.  Unluckily for him, the representatives of the various fire offices with which he had effected his policies got busy first. The generous fellows insisted upon taking off his shoulders the burden of maintaining the fireman whose permanent presence in a theater is required by law. Nothing would satisfy them but to install firemen of their own and pay their salaries. This, to a man in whom the instincts of the phoenix were so strongly developed as they were in Mr. Montague, was distinctly disconcerting. He saw himself making no profit on the deal--a thing which had never happened to him before.  And then Roland Bleke occurred, and Mr. Montague's belief that his race was really chosen was restored. He sold the Windsor Theater to Roland for twenty-five thousand pounds. It was fifteen thousand pounds more than he himself had given for it, and this very satisfactory profit mitigated the slight regret which he felt when it came to transferring to Roland the insurance policies. To have effected policies amounting to rather more than seventy thousand pounds on a building so notoriously valueless as the Windsor Theater had been an achievement of which Mr. Montague was justly proud, and it seemed sad to him that so much earnest endeavor should be thrown away.         *       *       *       *       *  Over the little lunch with which she kindly allowed Roland to entertain her, to celebrate the purchase of the theater, Miss Verepoint outlined her policy.  “What we must put up at that theater,” she announced, “is a revue. A revue,” repeated Miss Verepoint, making, as she spoke, little calculations on the back of the menu, “we could run for about fifteen hundred a week--or, say, two thousand.”  Saying two thousand, thought Roland to himself, is not quite the same as paying two thousand, so why should she stint herself?  “I know two boys who could write us a topping revue,” said Miss Verepoint. “They'd spread themselves, too, if it was for me. They're in love with me--both of them. We'd better get in touch with them at once.”  To Roland, there seemed to be something just the least bit sinister about the sound of that word “touch,” but he said nothing.  “Why, there they are--lunching over there!” cried Miss Verepoint, pointing to a neighboring table. “Now, isn't that lucky?”  To Roland the luck was not quite so apparent, but he made no demur to Miss Verepoint's suggestion that they should be brought over to their table.  The two boys, as to whose capabilities to write a topping revue Miss Verepoint had formed so optimistic an estimate, proved to be well-grown lads of about forty-five and forty, respectively. Of the two, Roland thought that perhaps R. P. de Parys was a shade the more obnoxious, but a closer inspection left him with the feeling that these fine distinctions were a little unfair with men of such equal talents. Bromham Rhodes ran his friend so close that it was practically a dead heat. They were both fat and somewhat bulgy-eyed. This was due to the fact that what revue-writing exacts from its exponents is the constant assimilation of food and drink. Bromham Rhodes had the largest appetite in London; but, on the other hand, R. P. de Parys was a better drinker.  “Well, dear old thing!” said Bromham Rhodes.  “Well, old child!” said R. P. de Parys.  Both these remarks were addressed to Miss Verepoint. The talented pair appeared to be unaware of Roland's existence.  Miss Verepoint struck the business note. “Now you stop, boys,” she said. “Tie weights to yourselves and sink down into those chairs. I want you two lads to write a revue for me.”  “Delighted!” said Bromham Rhodes; “but----”  “There is the trifling point to be raised first----” said R. P. de Parys.  “Where is the money coming from?” said Bromham Rhodes.  “My friend, Mr. Bleke, is putting up the money,” said Miss Verepoint, with dignity. “He has taken the Windsor Theater.”  The interest of the two authors in their host, till then languid, increased with a jerk. “Has he? By Jove!” they cried. “We must get together and talk this over.”  It was Roland's first experience of a theatrical talking-over, and he never forgot it. Two such talkers-over as Bromham Rhodes and R. P. de Parys were scarcely to be found in the length and breadth of theatrical London. Nothing, it seemed, could the gifted pair even begin to think of doing without first discussing the proposition in all its aspects. The amount of food which Roland found himself compelled to absorb during the course of these debates was appalling. Discussions which began at lunch would be continued until it was time to order dinner; and then, as likely as not, they would have to sit there till supper-time in order to thrash the question thoroughly out.         *       *       *       *       *  The collection of a cast was a matter even more complicated than the actual composition of the revue. There was the almost insuperable difficulty that Miss Verepoint firmly vetoed every name suggested. It seemed practically impossible to find any man or woman in all England or "]]]
