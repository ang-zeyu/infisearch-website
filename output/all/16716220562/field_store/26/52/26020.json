Since she died I care less for men’s opinion, and only try to do my duty, till the ball comes that will end me.”  [Footnote 1: His words.]  And dashing a tear from his eyes, Stuart walked to the door of his tent, from which he gazed forth upon the stars.  Five minutes passed thus, and I did not speak. Then all at once I heard Stuart call out: “Orderly!”  “Yes, sir,” came from the man on post near the tent.  “Tell Sweeney to come and bring his banjo!”  And walking fifty steps, Stuart caressed the glossy neck of his mare “Lady Margaret,” who was tethered to a bough, and looked around affectionately at her master.  When he returned he was humming “The dew lay on the blossom,” and following him was Sweeney--the same old Sweeney!--ever mild, courteous, almost sad, doffing his cap, saluting with simple grace, and tuning his banjo.  In a moment the tent, the wooded knoll, the whole vicinity was ringing with the uproarious notes of the mirth-inspiring banjo; and Sweeney was chanting, as only that great master _could_ chant, the mighty epic of the sabreurs of Stuart:--    “If you want to have a good time   Jine the cavalry,   Bully Boys, hey!”  The staff and couriers quickly assembled, the servants were grouped in the starlight, the horses beneath the boughs turned their intelligent heads--and leading in the uproarious chorus might have been heard the sonorous and laughing voice of Stuart.      VI.   STUART’S INSTINCT.   The festivities were kept up until nearly midnight.  Then Stuart yawned; said with a laugh, “Good morning, gentle-_men_” as was his habit when he wished to work; and the tent was soon deserted.  I retired to rest, but at three in the morning felt a hand upon my shoulder.  “The general is going to move, colonel, and wishes to see you,” said the orderly.  I rose, made my brief toilet, and went toward Stuart’s tent where a light was shining. He was writing busily at his desk, as fresh and gay as on the preceding evening. His enormous constitution defied fatigue.  All at once I saw that there was another personage in the tent. He was a young man of about twenty, of slight figure, beardless face, and an expression so shy and retiring that he seemed ready to blush if you spoke to him. He wore, nevertheless, the uniform of a captain of artillery; and I remember wondering how this girlish and shrinking personage, with the large, sad eyes, had come to hold a commission.  “Captain Davenant, of my horse artillery, Colonel Surry,” said Stuart.  The youth colored, and then with an air of painful embarrassment took a step forward and pressed my hand. The grasp of the slender fingers was like the grip of a steel vice.  “Davenant has been on a scout across the Rappahannock, to keep his hand in,” said Stuart, busily writing. “My horse artillery boys do a little of every thing--and Davenant is a wild-cat, Surry, with a touch of the bull dog, in spite of his looks!”  The young officer drew back blushing more than ever at these words. His confusion seemed to deprive him of the power of utterance.  “I’ll bet he’s blushing now!” said Stuart, laughing and continuing to write with his back turned, as he spoke. “He is blushing or sighing--for the poor Yankees he has killed, doubtless!”  “You are laughing at me, general,” said the young man timidly. “Well, my laughter won’t hurt you, Davenant. I never joke with people I don’t like. But to business. The enemy are going to attack me, Surry. Get ready, I am going to move.”  “Ready, general.”  “All right!--Hagan!”  “General!”  The voice came like an echo. Then at the door appeared the gigantic, black-bearded Lieutenant Hagan, chief of the general’s escort. Have you forgotten him, my dear reader?--his huge figure, his mighty beard, the deep thunder of his tones? I showed you the brave soldier in 1861 and ‘62. In 1863 his beard was heavier, his voice more like thunder--when the giant walked along he seemed to shake the ground.  “I am going to move in half an hour, Hagan,” said Stuart, still writing busily. “Head-quarters will be established on Fleetwood Hill, beyond Brandy; my horse!”  Hagan saluted and vanished without uttering a word. In five minutes the camp was buzzing, and “Lady Margaret” was led up.  “Come on, Surry! Come on, Davenant! I will beat you to the Court-House!”  And Stuart buckled on his sword, drew on his gauntlets, and mounted his horse. I was beside him. Not to be ready when Stuart was--was to be left behind. He waited for nobody. His staff soon learned that.  As Davenant’s horse was awaiting him, he was as prompt as Stuart desired. In a minute we were all three riding at full speed toward the village. Stuart was playing with his glove, which he had taken off and dangled to and fro. His brows were knit, and he was reflecting. We did not interrupt him, and in ten minutes we were all clattering over the main street of the hamlet.  Stuart pushed on by the tavern, without pausing, in the direction of Fleetwood, when just as he reached the eastern suburbs of the town a small one-horse wagon, leaving the place, attracted his attention. There was just sufficient light to make out the figures in the wagon. There were two. One was a portly and plainly clad old countryman, with a prominent nose, a double chin, and fat hands decorated with pinchbeck rings. Beside him sat an old woman, as fat as himself, wearing a faded calico gown, a “coal-scuttle” bonnet, and a huge ruffled cap beneath.  Stuart looked keenly at the wagon, called to the driver to halt, and demanded whither he was going, and on what business. The old countryman smiled. The question seemed to strike him as absurd, and his explanation was simple and calculated to remove all suspicion. He stated that his name was Brown--that he lived near the village; had brought in a load of vegetables to sell, on the preceding evening--some friends had persuaded him and “his old woman” to spend the night, and they were now going home.  Stuart peered under the coal-scuttle bonnet.  “And this is your ‘old woman’ my friend,” he said with a laugh.  “Jest so, sir,” was the wheezy reply of the fat old countryman, smiling sweetly. “You see she would come along, sir. Womankind is mighty contrary!”  “A profound sentiment!” laughed Stuart, and riding on without further words, he left the countryman free to proceed on his way.  We crossed a little stream, rode on toward Fleetwood, and had nearly reached Brandy when Stuart suddenly reined in his horse.  “Do you know what I think,” he said, “that I have done a foolish thing?”  “What, general?”  “To let that old fellow go on. I don’t like his looks.”  “The old countryman?”  “Yes; I wish I had arrested him--him and his wife.”  “Arrested them?”  Stuart nodded.  “I have an instinct about rascals, Surry; and something tells me that I have been guilty of an imprudence.”  “Was not his explanation satisfactory?”  “No.”  “What could be wrong?”  “Everything.”  “And his ‘old woman,’” I said, laughing; “think of that highly respectable dame.”  “I like her least of all!”  “From instinct?”  “If you choose.”  “I think your instinct misleads you this time, general.”  “I think not.”  “Well, we will see.”  And we did see.  In two hours the head-quarters tents were pitched upon Fleetwood Hill beyond Brandy, and Stuart sent his provost marshal to Culpeper Court-House, with orders to conduct the prisoner taken by Mohun on the preceding night, to General Lee, for examination.  An hour afterward the worthy provost returned in hot haste with the astounding information that the fair lady was nowhere to be found. She had disappeared from her chamber, none knew how, before daylight, and as a notoriously suspected individual who had lately been hanging round the tavern had disappeared too, it was probable that they had gone off together. Upon this point, a note left by the lady directed to “General Stuart” would probably give information. This had been found upon her table. And the provost wound up by handing the note to Stuart.  He read it with an air of decided ill-humor. Then throwing it upon his desk, burst into a laugh.  “Well, Surry,” he said, “who is right and who is wrong, now? Read that!”  And he pointed to the note, which I opened and read. It was in a delicate female hand, and ran as follows:--  “General Stuart will pardon the attempt his captive is about to make, to effect her escape. He made himself quite charming in their brief interview, but liberty is sweet. Finding a friend unexpectedly in this quarter of the world, I have made every arrangement with him; he is a great master of disguises, and, though the travelling costume which I shall adopt will make me look hideous, I hope it will enable me, before sunrise, to pass a private ford, known to my friend alone, and reach the opposite bank of the Rappahannock.  “Farewell, my dear general. If all the rebels were like yourself, I might change my politics. I have but one other friend in your army--Colonel Mohun, of the cavalry. Present my regards to him, and say that _we will meet again_.”  That was all. I raised my eyes from the paper, and looked at the general with stupefaction.  “Then that ‘old woman’ was the lady?”  “Precisely.”  “And we are fooled?”  “Completely. They are by this time on the other side of the Rappahannock.”  With these words, Stuart dismissed the whole subject, turned to his desk, and in a moment was busy at his official writing.     VII.   THE BALL BEFORE THE BATTLE.   On the same evening I was riding with Stuart toward Culpeper Court-House.  “Do you know where we are going, Surry?” he said, with a laugh.  “I can guess, I think.”  “Try.”  “To the ball given by the young officers to the Charlottesville belles tonight.”  “You are wrong, old fellow. I don’t dare to go there.”  “Don’t dare?”  “Well, that is the word,” he replied; “I am not afraid of the Yankees, but I am of gossips--above all, of the valorous correspondents of the newspapers.”  “I begin to understand now.”"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8424"],["title","Mohun; Or, the Last Days of Lee and His Paladins. (#4)"],["body","  “They are dangerous.”  “Yes.”  Stuart cantered on, playing with his glove as usual. “Think of Messieurs the bomb-proof critics!” he laughed. “They already say I reviewed the cavalry with a wreath of flowers around my horse’s neck.”  “Is it possible?”  “They say so everywhere; and I will tell you the foundation for the charge. In passing through the Court-House on the morning of the review, a young lady friend of mine ran out from her house and threw a wreath over the neck of my horse. Well, I think it is something to be courteous in this world. I did not throw it off. I thanked her, rode on, and only removed it when I got out of sight. Meeting General Lee, I told him of it, laughing, and he said, with a smile: ‘Why did you not wear it?’ [1] I might as well have done so, Surry, for you see I have the credit of it. Why try to be temperate, and pure, and soldierly? I am a drunkard, a libertine, and a popinjay! But I care nothing. I intend to do my duty, old fellow, and the next few days will probably show if I can fight.”  [Footnote 1: Fact.]  With which words Stuart broke into a song, cantered on more rapidly, and passing without drawing rein through the Court-House, soon reached General Lee’s head-quarters on an eminence beyond.  Here he remained for an hour, in private interview with the commander-in-chief. Finally, they came out together. General Lee in his plain uniform, with that sedate dignity of bearing which made the gray old cavalier so superb. I had the honor to receive his salute, and to press his hand, and then I set out with General Stuart for Fleetwood.  In passing through the Court-House we observed the windows of a large building all ablaze with lights, and heard the merry notes of music. Stuart drew rein.  “I think I will drop in for a few minutes, in spite of every thing!” he said. “See the end of all my excellent resolutions, Surry!”  And rapidly dismounting, Stuart entered the ball-room. I followed.  If the review was imposing, the ball was charming. Youths and maidens had assembled promptly at the sound of music, and, if I were a poet or a penny-a-liner, my dear reader, I would compose a fine description of the merry spectacle. But alas! I am neither; and feel unequal to the “ornate” style of writing. I am only a battered old _militaire_, with a number of great events to speak of. Look in the newspapers of that period for an account of the assembly.  Let me say, however, in passing, that there was something sad as well as joyful, gloomy as well as brilliant, in all that echoing laughter, and the movements of these gay figures, on the eve of the bloody battle of Fleetwood. Girls were smiling upon youths who in twelve hours would be dead. Lips were shaping gallant compliments--soon they were going to utter the death-groan. All went merry as a marriage-bell, and they danced to the joyous music. Soon the cannon would begin to roll, and the youths would charge to that stormy music as they danced to this.  I was gazing at the lively assemblage--at the undulating forms moving to and fro, the gay uniforms, the fluttering scarfs, the snowy arms, the rosy cheeks, when my attention was attracted by a figure which made me lose sight of all else.  It was that of a young girl about twenty, tall, stately, and beautiful. Her dark hair was carried back in glossy waves, and ended in profuse curls. Her cheeks resembled blush roses; the eyes were large, brilliant, and full of laughing hauteur; the lips red, and wreathed into a dazzling smile, which was the perfection of satirical mirth.  I grow extravagant; but this young girl was superb. There was something queen like and imposing in her movements and whole appearance. She seemed to look down on the crowd with satirical disdain, and the gay youths who surrounded her were every instant struck by the bright shafts of a wit which spared nothing.  Who was this dangerous beauty, who received the attentions of the young officers with so much careless disdain? I asked that question of a friend and he replied:  “Miss Georgia Conway, a daughter of Judge William Conway.”  “Ah,” I said, “the statesman?--the successor of Randolph in bitter oratory?”  “Yes, and yonder he is.”  I looked in the direction indicated, and saw an elderly gentleman of small stature, with long gray hair, and lips full of benignant smiles. He wore a suit of black, and there was something courtly and attractive in every movement of the slender figure. His low bow and sweet smile were the perfection of old-time courtesy.  I was still looking at this gentleman, whose fame had extended throughout Virginia and the whole South, when a familiar voice near me, attracted my attention. It was that of Captain Davenant, the young officer of the horse artillery, and glancing in the direction of the voice I saw him bending over a young lady who was seated and conversing with him. She was a girl of seventeen, with blue eyes, auburn hair, and a complexion as fair as a lily. As Davenant addressed her in low tones, she gazed up into his face with an expression of confiding affection. In the eyes of the young officer I could read a profound and ardent love.  Turning to my friend I inquired the name of the young lady, in turn.  “Miss Virginia Conway,” he replied, “the only sister of Miss Georgia.”  He had scarcely uttered the words, when Davenant’s interview with the young lady terminated in a very singular manner. Suddenly Judge Conway passed through the crowd, reached the spot where the young people were conversing, and darting a glance of positive fury at the youth--a glance which made his eyes resemble coals of fire--offered his arm to his daughter, and abruptly bore her away.  Davenant’s face flushed crimson, and his eyes darted flame. He took a step as though about to follow--but all at once he stopped.  Then from red his face became pale. The old expression of sadness returned to his lips. With head bent down, and a faint color stealing over his cheeks, he went toward the door, and passed though it, and disappeared.  Before I had time to reflect upon this singular incident, I heard the voice of Stuart.  “Come, Surry! to horse! unless you wish to remain!” he said.  “Ready, general!” I replied.  And in five minutes we were galloping toward Fleetwood.  “A gay ball,” said Stuart, as we rode along; “but do you remember _my instinct_, Surry?”  “Perfectly, general. Has it told you something on the present occasion?”  “Yes.”  “What?”  “You have heard of the famous ball at Brussells, broken up by the guns of Waterloo?”  “Certainly.”  “Well, I think that this one will prove similar--that cannon are going to thunder before the music stops.”  Stuart had scarcely spoken when rapid hoof-strokes were heard in front, and a horseman shot by.  “Have you seen General Stuart?” said a voice in the darkness.  “Here I am--what news, Stringfellow?”  The horseman drew rein so suddenly that his horse was thrown upon his haunches. “You will be attacked at daylight, general.”  “Well,--what force?”  “The whole Yankee cavalry, with infantry and artillery supports.”  “All right; ride back with me, and tell me every thing, Stringfellow.”  In half an hour we were at head-quarters. Stuart dismounted and entered his tent.  “You see I was right, Surry,” he said turning toward me, “and there is something in my _instinct_ after all!”     VIII.   FLEETWOOD.   At daylight a long thunder came up from the woods of the Rappahannock. The greatest cavalry combat of the war had begun.  At that sound Stuart leaped to the saddle, and rode rapidly toward the front. Fifteen minutes afterward his head-quarters had vanished. On the green slope of Fleetwood not a tent was visible.  Is the reader familiar with the country along the Upper Rappahannock? If so, he will remember that the river is crossed in Culpeper by numerous fords. The principal--beginning on the left, that is to say, up the river--are Welford’s, Beverly’s, the Railroad bridge, and Kelly’s fords.  Stuart’s left, under William H.F. Lee, was opposite Welford’s; his centre, under Jones, opposite Beverly’s; his right, under Hampton, toward Kelly’s; and a force under Robertson was posted in the direction of Stevensburg, to guard the right flank. The whole amounted to about seven or eight thousand cavalry.  The Federal column which now advanced to attack it, is said to have embraced all the cavalry of General Hooker’s army; and must have numbered more than twelve thousand sabres.  Stuart rode on rapidly down Fleetwood Hill, and was soon opposite Beverly’s Ford where the enemy had crossed in force. General Jones was heavily engaged, and the Napoleons of the horse artillery were roaring steadily. Every moment the round shot crashed, or the shell tore through the woods about three hundred yards in front of the pieces where the dismounted cavalry of the enemy had effected a lodgment. They kept up a hot fire at the cannoneers, and the steady rattle of carbines further up the river told that Lee was also engaged.  In face of the bursting shell, the blue _tirailleurs_ could not advance; and Stuart sent an order to Hampton to move in and attack on the right.  The troopers of the Gulf States advanced at the word; their dense column was seen slowly moving, with drawn sabre, across the plain; the moment of decisive struggle seemed rapidly approaching, when suddenly a heavy blow was struck at Stuart’s rear.  I had been directed by him to ascertain if “every thing had been sent off from Fleetwood,” and to see that no papers had been dropped there in the hurry of departure. Going back at a gallop I soon reached the hill, and rode over the ground recently occupied by the head-quarters. The spot seemed swept. Not a paper was visible. All that I could see was a withered bouquet dropped by some young officer of the staff--a relic, no doubt, of the last night’s ball at the village.  I had already turned to ride back to Stuart, when my attention was attracted by a column of cavalry advancing straight on Brandy--that is, "]]]
