GIVE ME THE SPLENDID SILENT SUN.   1    Give me the splendid silent sun with all his beams full-dazzling,   Give me juicy autumnal fruit ripe and red from the orchard,   Give me a field where the unmow'd grass grows,   Give me an arbor, give me the trellis'd grape,   Give me fresh corn and wheat, give me serene-moving animals teaching             content,   Give me nights perfectly quiet as on high plateaus west of the             Mississippi, and I looking up at the stars,   Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers where I can             walk undisturb'd,   Give me for marriage a sweet-breath'd woman of whom I should never             tire,   Give me a perfect child, give me away aside from the noise of the             world a rural domestic life,   Give me to warble spontaneous songs recluse by myself, for my own             ears only,   Give me solitude, give me Nature, give me again O Nature your primal             sanities!    These demanding to have them, (tired with ceaseless excitement, and             rack'd by the war-strife,)   These to procure incessantly asking, rising in cries from my heart,   While yet incessantly asking still I adhere to my city,   Day upon day and year upon year O city, walking your streets,   Where you hold me enchain'd a certain time refusing to give me up,   Yet giving to make me glutted, enrich'd of soul, you give me forever             faces;   (O I see what I sought to escape, confronting, reversing my cries,   I see my own soul trampling down what it ask'd for.)  2    Keep your splendid silent sun,   Keep your woods O Nature, and the quiet places by the woods,   Keep your fields of clover and timothy, and your corn-fields and             orchards,   Keep the blossoming buckwheat fields where the Ninth-month bees hum;   Give me faces and streets--give me these phantoms incessant and             endless along the trottoirs!   Give me interminable eyes--give me women--give me comrades and lovers             by the thousand!   Let me see new ones every day--let me hold new ones by the hand every             day!   Give me such shows--give me the streets of Manhattan!   Give me Broadway, with the soldiers marching--give me the sound of             the trumpets and drums!   (The soldiers in companies or regiments--some starting away, flush'd             and reckless,   Some, their time up, returning with thinn'd ranks, young, yet very             old, worn, marching, noticing nothing;)   Give me the shores and wharves heavy-fringed with black ships!   O such for me! O an intense life, full to repletion and varied!   The life of the theatre, bar-room, huge hotel, for me!   The saloon of the steamer! the crowded excursion for me! the             torchlight procession!   The dense brigade bound for the war, with high piled military wagons             following;   People, endless, streaming, with strong voices, passions, pageants,   Manhattan streets with their powerful throbs, with beating drums as             now,   The endless and noisy chorus, the rustle and clank of muskets, (even             the sight of the wounded,)   Manhattan crowds, with their turbulent musical chorus!   Manhattan faces and eyes forever for me.     DIRGE FOR TWO VETERANS.         The last sunbeam   Lightly falls from the finish'd Sabbath,   On the pavement here, and there beyond it is looking,       Down a new-made double grave.        Lo, the moon ascending,   Up from the east the silvery round moon,   Beautiful over the house-tops, ghastly, phantom moon,       Immense and silent moon.        I see a sad procession,   And I hear the sound of coming full-key'd bugles,   All the channels of the city streets they're flooding,       As with voices and with tears.        I hear the great drums pounding,   And the small drums steady whirring,   And every blow of the great convulsive drums,       Strikes me through and through.        For the son is brought with the father,   (In the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell,   Two veterans son and father dropt together,       And the double grave awaits them.)        Now nearer blow the bugles,   And the drums strike more convulsive,   And the daylight o'er the pavement quite has faded,       And the strong dead-march enwraps me.        In the eastern sky up-buoying,   The sorrowful vast phantom moves illumin'd,   ('Tis some mother's large transparent face,       In heaven brighter growing.)        O strong dead-march you please me!   O moon immense with your silvery face you soothe me!   O my soldiers twain! O my veterans passing to burial!       What I have I also give you.        The moon gives you light,   And the bugles and the drums give you music,   And my heart, O my soldiers, my veterans,       My heart gives you love.     OVER THE CARNAGE ROSE PROPHETIC A VOICE.     Over the carnage rose prophetic a voice,   Be not dishearten'd, affection shall solve the problems of freedom             yet,   Those who love each other shall become invincible,   They shall yet make Columbia victorious.    Sons of the Mother of All, you shall yet be victorious,   You shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of all the remainder of the             earth.    No danger shall balk Columbia's lovers,   If need be a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one.   One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourian's comrade,   From Maine and from hot Carolina, and another an Oregonese, shall be             friends triune,   More precious to each other than all the riches of the earth.    To Michigan, Florida perfumes shall tenderly come,   Not the perfumes of flowers, but sweeter, and wafted beyond death.    It shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly             affection,   The most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly,   The dependence of Liberty shall be lovers,   The continuance of equality shall be comrades.    These shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron,   I, ecstatic, O partners! O lands! with the love of lovers tie you.    (Were you looking to be held together by lawyers?   Or by an agreement on a paper? or by arms?   Nay, nor the world, nor any living thing, will so cohere.)     I SAW OLD GENERAL AT BAY.     I saw old General at bay,   (Old as he was, his gray eyes yet shone out in battle like stars,)   His small force was now completely hemm'd in, in his works,   He call'd for volunteers to run the enemy's lines, a desperate             emergency,   I saw a hundred and more step forth from the ranks, but two or three             were selected,   I saw them receive their orders aside, they listen'd with care, the             adjutant was very grave,   I saw them depart with cheerfulness, freely risking their lives.     THE ARTILLERYMAN'S VISION.     While my wife at my side lies slumbering, and the wars are over long,   And my head on the pillow rests at home, and the vacant midnight             passes,   And through the stillness, through the dark, I hear, just hear, the             breath of my infant,   There in the room as I wake from sleep this vision presses upon me;   The engagement opens there and then in fantasy unreal,   The skirmishers begin, they crawl cautiously ahead, I hear the             irregular snap! snap!   I hear the sounds of the different missiles, the short _t-h-t!             t-h-t!_ of the rifle-balls,   I see the shells exploding leaving small white clouds, I hear the             great shells shrieking as they pass,   The grape like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees             (tumultuous now the contest rages,)   All the scenes at the batteries rise in detail before me again,   The crashing and smoking, the pride of the men in their pieces,   The chief-gunner ranges and sights his piece and selects a fuse of             the right time,   After firing I see him lean aside and look eagerly off to note the             effect;   Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging, (the young colonel             leads himself this time with brandish'd sword,)   I see the gaps cut by the enemy's volleys, (quickly fill'd up, no             delay,)   I breathe the suffocating smoke, then the flat clouds hover low             concealing all;   Now a strange lull for a few seconds, not a shot fired on either             side,   Then resumed the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls and orders             of officers,   While from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my ears a             shout of applause, (some special success,)   And ever the sound of the cannon far or near, (rousing even in dreams             a devilish exultation and all the old mad joy in the depths             of my soul,)   And ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions, batteries,             cavalry, moving hither and thither,   (The falling, dying, I heed not, the wounded dripping and red I heed             not, some to the rear are hobbling,)   Grime, heat, rush, aide-de-camps galloping by or on a full run,   With the patter of small arms, the warning _s-s-t_ of the rifles,             (these in my vision I hear or see,)   And bombs bursting in air, and at night the vari-color'd rockets.     ETHIOPIA SALUTING THE COLOURS.     Who are you dusky woman, so ancient hardly human,   With your woolly-white and turban'd head, and bare bony feet   Why rising by the roadside here, do you the colours greet?    ('Tis while our army lines Carolina's sands and pines,   Forth from thy hovel door thou Ethiopia com'st to me,   As under doughty Sherman I march toward the sea.)    _Me master years a hundred since from my parents sunder'd,   A little child, they caught me as the savage beast is caught,   Then hither me"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8801"],["title","Drum-Taps (#8)"],["body","the sea the cruel slaver brought._    No further does she say, but lingering all the day,   Her high-borne turban'd head she wags, and rolls her darkling eye,   And courtesies to the regiments, the guidons moving by.    What is it fateful woman, so blear, hardly human?   Why wag your head with turban bound, yellow, red and green?   Are the things so strange and marvellous you see or have seen?     NOT YOUTH PERTAINS TO ME.     Not youth pertains to me,   Nor delicatesse, I cannot beguile the time with talk,   Awkward in the parlor, neither a dancer nor elegant,   In the learn'd coterie sitting constrain'd and still, for learning             inures not to me,   Beauty, knowledge, inure not to me-yet there are two or three things             inure to me,   I have nourish'd the wounded and sooth'd many a dying soldier,   And at intervals waiting or in the midst of camp,   Composed these songs.     RACE OF VETERANS.     Race of veterans--race of victors!   Race of the soil, ready for conflict--race of the conquering march;   (No more credulity's race, abiding-temper'd race,)   Race henceforth owning no law but the law of itself,   Race of passion and the storm.     WORLD TAKE GOOD NOTICE.     World take good notice, silver stars fading,   Milky hue ript, weft of white detaching,   Coals thirty-eight, baleful and burning,   Scarlet, significant, hands off warning,   Now and henceforth flaunt from these shores.     O TAN-FACED PRAIRIE-BOY.     O tan-faced prairie-boy,   Before you came to camp came many a welcome gift,   Praises and presents came and nourishing food, till at last among the             recruits,   You came, taciturn, with nothing to give-we but look'd on each other,   When lo; more than all the gifts of the world you gave me.     LOOK DOWN FAIR MOON.     Look down fair moon and bathe this scene,   Pour softly down night's nimbus floods on faces ghastly, swollen,             purple,   On the dead on their backs with arms toss'd wide,   Pour down your unstinted nimbus sacred moon.     RECONCILIATION.     Word over all, beautiful as the sky,   Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be             utterly lost,   That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly softly wash             again, and ever again, this soil'd world;   For my enemy is dead, a man divine as myself is dead,   I look where he lies white-faced and still in the coffin-I draw near,   Bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the             coffin.     HOW SOLEMN AS ONE BY ONE.  (_Washington City, 1865._)     How solemn as one by one,   As the ranks returning worn and sweaty, as the men file by where I             stand,   As the faces the masks appear, as I glance at the faces studying the             masks,   (As I glance upward out of this page studying you, dear friend,             whoever you are,)   How solemn the thought of my whispering soul to each in the ranks,             and to you,   I see behind each mask that wonder a kindred soul,   O the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend,   Nor the bayonet stab what you really are;   The soul! yourself I see, great as any, good as the best,   Waiting secure and content, which the bullet could never kill,   Nor the bayonet stab O friend.     AS I LAY WITH MY HEAD IN YOUR LAP CAMERADO.     As I lay with my head in your lap camerado,   The confession I made I resume, what I said to you and the open air I             resume,   I know I am restless and make others so,   I know my words are weapons full of danger, full of death,   For I confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to unsettle             them,   I am more resolute because all have denied me than I could ever have             been had all accepted me,   I heed not and have never heeded either experience, cautions,             majorities, nor ridicule,   And the threat of what is call'd hell is little or nothing to me;   And the lure of what is call'd heaven is little or nothing to me;   Dear camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and still             urge you, without the least idea what is our destination,   Or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell'd and defeated.     DELICATE CLUSTER.     Delicate cluster! flag of teeming life!   Covering all my lands-all my seashores lining!   Flag of death! (how I watch'd you through the smoke of battle             pressing!   How I heard you flap and rustle, cloth defiant!)   Flag cerulean-sunny flag, with the orbs of night dappled!   Ah my silvery beauty-ah my woolly white and crimson!   Ah to sing the song of you, my matron mighty!   My sacred one, my mother.     TO A CERTAIN CIVILIAN.     Did you ask dulcet rhymes from me?   Did you seek the civilian's peaceful and languishing rhymes?   Did you find what I sang erewhile so hard to follow?   Why I was not singing erewhile for you to follow, to understand--nor             am I now;   (I have been born of the same as the war was born,   The drum-corps' rattle is ever to me sweet music, I love well the             martial dirge,   With slow wail and convulsive throb leading the officer's funeral;)   What to such as you anyhow such a poet as I? therefore leave my             works,   And go lull yourself with what you can understand, and with             piano-tunes,   For I lull nobody, and you will never understand me.     LO, VICTRESS ON THE PEAKS.     Lo, Victress on the peaks,   Where thou with mighty brow regarding the world,   (The world O Libertad, that vainly conspired against thee,)   Out of its countless beleaguering toils, after thwarting them all,   Dominant, with the dazzling sun around thee,   Flauntest now unharm'd in immortal soundness and bloom--lo, in these             hours supreme,   No poem proud, I chanting bring to thee, nor mastery's rapturous             verse,   But a cluster containing night's darkness and blood-dripping wounds,   And psalms of the dead.     SPIRIT WHOSE WORK IS DONE.  (_Washington City, 1865._)     Spirit whose work is done--spirit of dreadful hours!   Ere departing fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets;   Spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts, (yet onward ever unfaltering             pressing),   Spirit of many a solemn day and many a savage scene--electric spirit,   That with muttering voice through the war now closed, like a tireless             phantom flitted,   Rousing the land with breath of flame, while you beat and beat the             drum,   Now as the sound of the drum, hollow and harsh to the last,             reverberates round me,   As your ranks, your immortal ranks, return, return from the battles,   As the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders,   As I look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders,   As those slanted bayonets, whole forests of them appearing in the             distance, approach and pass on, returning homeward,   Moving with steady motion, swaying to and fro to the right and left,   Evenly lightly rising and falling while the steps keep time;   Spirit of hours I knew, all hectic red one day, but pale as death             next day,   Touch my mouth ere you depart, press my lips close,   Leave me your pulses of rage-bequeath them to me-fill me with             currents convulsive,   Let them scorch and blister out of my chants when you are gone,   Let them identify you to the future in these songs.     ADIEU TO A SOLDIER.     Adieu O soldier,   You of the rude campaigning, (which we shared,)   The rapid march, the life of the camp,   The hot contention of opposing fronts, the long manoeuvre,   Bed battles with their slaughter, the stimulus, the strong, terrific             game,   Spell of all brave and manly hearts, the trains of time through you             and like of you all fill'd,   With war and war's expression.    Adieu dear comrade,   Your mission is fulfill'd--but I, more warlike,   Myself and this contentious soul of mine,   Still on our own campaigning bound,   Through untried roads with ambushes opponents lined,   Through many a sharp defeat and many a crisis, often baffled,   Here marching, ever marching on, a war fight out--aye here,   To fiercer, weightier battles give expression.     TURN O LIBERTAD.     Turn O Libertad, for the war is over,   From it and all henceforth expanding, doubting no more, resolute,             sweeping the world,   Turn from lands retrospective recording proofs of the past,   From the singers that sing the trailing glories of the past,   From the chants of the feudal world, the triumphs of kings, slavery,             caste,   Turn to the world, the triumphs reserv'd and to come--give up that             backward world,   Leave to the singers of hitherto, give them the trailing past,   But what remains remains for singers for you--wars to come are for             you,   (Lo, how the wars of the past have duly inured to you, and the wars             of the present also inure;)   Then turn, and be not alarm'd O Libertad--turn your undying face,   To where the future, greater than all the past,   Is swiftly, surely preparing for you.     TO THE LEAVEN'D SOIL THEY TROD.     To the leaven'd soil they trod calling I sing for the last,   (Forth from my tent emerging for good, loosing, untying the             tent-ropes,)   In the freshness the forenoon air, in the far-stretching circuits and             vistas again to peace restored,   To the fiery fields emanative and the endless vistas beyond, to the             South and the North,   To the leaven'd soil of the general Western world to attest my songs,   To the Alleghanian hills and the tireless Mississippi,   To the rocks I calling sing, and all the trees in the woods,   To the plains of the poems of heroes, to the prairies spreading wide,   To the far-off sea and the unseen winds, and the sane impalpable air;   And responding they answer all, (but not in words,)   The average earth, the witness of war and peace, acknowledges mutely,   "]]]
