Making a step or two, lo and behold!  upward he popt into the air, high above the heads of Quicksilver and the Nymphs, and found it very difficult to clamber down again.  Winged slippers, and all such high-flying contrivances, are seldom quite easy to manage, until one grows a little accustomed to them.  Quicksilver laughed at his companion’s involuntary activity, and told him that he must not be in so desperate a hurry, but must wait for the invisible helmet.  The good-natured Nymphs had the helmet, with its dark tuft of waving plumes, all in readiness to put upon his head.  And now there happened about as wonderful an incident as anything that I have yet told you. The instant before the helmet was put on, there stood Perseus, a beautiful young man, with golden ringlets and rosy cheeks, the crooked sword by his side, and the brightly polished shield upon his arm,--a figure that seemed all made up of courage, sprightliness, and glorious light.  But when the helmet had descended over his white brow, there was no longer any Perseus to be seen!  Nothing but empty air!  Even the helmet, that covered him with its invisibility, had vanished!  “Where are you, Perseus?” asked Quicksilver.  “Why, here, to be sure!” answered Perseus, very quietly, although his voice seemed to come out of the transparent atmosphere.  “Just where I was a moment ago.  Don’t you see me?”  “No, indeed!” answered his friend.  “You are hidden under the helmet. But, if I cannot see you, neither can the Gorgons.  Follow me, therefore, and we will try your dexterity in using the winged slippers.”  With these words, Quicksilver’s cap spread its wings, as if his head were about to fly away from his shoulders; but his whole figure rose lightly into the air, and Perseus followed.  By the time they had ascended a few hundred feet, the young man began to feel what a delightful thing it was to leave the dull earth so far beneath him, and to be able to flit about like a bird.  It was now deep night.  Perseus looked upward, and saw the round, bright, silvery moon, and thought that he should desire nothing better than to soar up thither, and spend his life there.  Then he looked downward again, and saw the earth, with its seas, and lakes, and the silver courses of its rivers, and its snowy mountain-peaks, and the breadth of its fields, and the dark cluster of its woods, and its cities of white marble; and, with the moonshine sleeping over the whole scene, it was as beautiful as the moon or any star could be.  And, among other objects, he saw the island of Seriplius, where his dear mother was. Sometimes, he and Quicksilver approached a cloud, that, at a distance, looked as if it were made of fleecy silver; although, when they plunged into it, they found themselves chilled and moistened with gray mist.  So swift was their flight, however, that, in an instant, they emerged from the cloud into the moonlight again.  Once, a high-soaring eagle flew right against the invisible Perseus.  The bravest sights were the meteors, that gleamed suddenly out, as if a bonfire had been kindled in the sky, and made the moonshine pale for as much as a hundred miles around them.  As the two companions flew onward, Perseus fancied that he could hear the rustle of a garment close by his side; and it was on the side opposite to the one where he beheld Quicksilver, yet only Quicksilver was visible.  “Whose garment is this,” inquired Perseus, “that keeps rustling close beside me, in the breeze?”  “O, it is my sister’s!”  answered Quicksilver.  “She is coming along with us, as I told you she would.  We could do nothing without the help of my sister.  You have no idea how wise she is.  She has such eyes, too!  Why, she can see you, at this moment, just as distinctly as if you were not invisible; and I’ll venture to say, she will be the first to discover the Gorgons.”  By this time, in their swift voyage through the air, they had come within sight of the great ocean, and were soon flying over it.  Far beneath them, the waves tossed themselves tumultuously in mid-sea, or rolled a white surf-line upon the long beaches, or foamed against the rocky cliffs, with a roar that was thunderous, in the lower world; although it became a gentle murmur, like the voice of a baby half asleep, before it reached the ears of Perseus.  Just then a voice spoke in the air close by him.  It seemed to be a woman’s voice, and was melodious, though not exactly what might be called sweet, but grave and mild.  “Perseus,” said the voice, “there are the Gorgons.”  “Where?”  exclaimed Perseus.  “I cannot see them.”  “On the shore of that island beneath you,” replied the voice.  “A pebble, dropped from your hand, would strike in the midst of them.”  “I told you she would be the first to discover them,” said Quicksilver to Perseus.  “And there they are!”  Straight downward, two or three thousand feet below him, Perseus perceived a small island, with the sea breaking into white foam all around its rocky shore, except on one side, where there was a beach of snowy sand.  He descended towards it, and, looking earnestly at a cluster or heap of brightness, at the foot of a precipice of black rocks, behold, there were the terrible Gorgons!  They lay fast asleep, soothed by the thunder of the sea; for it required a tumult that would have deafened everybody else to lull such fierce creatures into slumber. The moonlight glistened on their steely scales, and on their golden wings, which drooped idly over the sand.  Their brazen claws, horrible to look at, were thrust out, and clutched the wave-beaten fragments of rock, while the sleeping Gorgons dreamed of tearing some poor mortal all to pieces.  The snakes that served them instead of hair seemed likewise to be asleep; although, now and then, one would writhe, and lift its head, and thrust out its forked tongue, emitting a drowsy hiss, and then let itself subside among its sister snakes.  The Gorgons were more like an awful, gigantic kind of insect,--immense, golden-winged beetles, or dragon-flies, or things of that sort,--at once ugly and beautiful,--than like anything else; only that they were a thousand and a million times as big.  And, with all this, there was something partly human about them, too.  Luckily for Perseus, their faces were completely hidden from him by the posture in which they lay; for, had he but looked one instant at them, he would have fallen heavily out of the air, an image of senseless stone.  “Now,” whispered Quicksilver, as he hovered by the side of Perseus,--“now is your time to do the deed!  Be quick; for, if one of the Gorgons should awake, you are too late!”  “Which shall I strike at?” asked Perseus, drawing his sword and descending a little lower.  “They all three look alike.  All three have snaky locks.  Which of the three is Medusa?”  It must be understood that Medusa was the only one of these dragon-monsters whose head Perseus could possibly cut off.  As for the other two, let him have the sharpest sword that ever was forged, and he might have hacked away by the hour together, without doing there the least harm.  “Be cautious,” said the calm voice which had before spoken to him.  “One of the Gorgons is stirring in her sleep, and is just about to turn over. That is Medusa.  Do not look at her!  The sight would turn you to stone! Look at the reflection of her face and figure in the bright mirror of your shield.”  Perseus now understood Quicksilver’s motive for so earnestly exhorting him to polish his shield.  In its surface he could safely look at the reflection of the Gorgon’s face.  And there it was,--that terrible countenance,--mirrored in the brightness of the shield, with the moonlight falling over it, and displaying all its horror.  The snakes, whose venomous natures could not altogether sleep, kept twisting themselves over the forehead.  It was the fiercest and most horrible face that ever was seen or imagined, and yet with a strange, fearful, and savage kind of beauty in it.  The eyes were closed, and the Gorgon was still in a deep slumber; but there was an unquiet expression disturbing her features, as if the monster was troubled with an ugly dream.  She gnashed her white tusks, and dug into the sand with her brazen claws.  The snakes, too, seemed to feel Medusa’s dream, and to be made more restless by it.  They twined themselves into tumultuous knots, writhed fiercely, and uplifted a hundred hissing heads, without opening their eyes.  “Now, now!” whispered Quicksilver, who was growing impatient.  “Make a dash at the monster!”  “But be calm,” said the grave, melodious voice, at the young man’s side. “Look in your shield, as you fly downward, and take care that you do not miss your first stroke.”  Perseus flew cautiously downward, still keeping his eyes on Medusa’s face, as reflected in his shield.  The nearer he came, the more terrible did the snaky visage and metallic body of the monster grow.  At last, when he found himself hovering over her within arm’s length, Perseus uplifted his sword, while, at the same instant, each separate snake upon the Gorgon’s head stretched threateningly upward, and Medusa unclosed her eyes.  But she awoke too late.  The sword was sharp; the stroke fell like a lightning-flash; and the head of the wicked Medusa tumbled from her body!  “Admirably done!”  cried Quicksilver.  “Make haste, and clap the head into your magic wallet.”  To the astonishment of Perseus, the small, embroidered wallet, which he had hung about his neck, and which had hitherto been no bigger than a purse, grew all at once large enough to contain Medusa’s head.  As quick as thought, he snatched it up, with the snakes still writhing upon it, and thrust it in.  “Your task is done,” said the calm voice.  “Now fly; for the other Gorgons will do their utmost to take vengeance for Medusa’s death.”  It was, indeed, necessary"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9255"],["title","The Gorgon's Head (#5)"],["body"," take flight; for Perseus had not done the deed so quietly, but that the clash of his sword, and the hissing of the snakes, and the thump of Medusa’s head as it tumbled upon the sea-beaten sand, awoke the other two monsters.  There they sat, for an instant, sleepily rubbing their eyes with their brazen fingers, while all the snakes on their heads reared themselves on end with surprise, and with venomous malice against they knew not what.  But when the Gorgons saw the scaly carcass of Medusa, headless, and her golden wings all ruffled, and half spread out on the sand, it was really awful to hear what yells and screeches they set up.  And then the snakes!  They sent forth a hundred-fold hiss, with one consent, and Medusa’s snakes answered them out of the magic wallet.  No sooner were the Gorgons broad awake, than they hurtled upward into the air, brandishing their brass talons, gnashing their horrible tusks, and flapping their huge wings so wildly, that some of the golden feathers were shaken out, and floated down upon the shore.  And there, perhaps, those very feathers he scattered, till this day.  Up rose the Gorgons, as I tell you, staring horribly about, in hopes of turning somebody to stone.  Had Perseus looked them in the face, or had he fallen into their clutches, his poor mother would never have kissed her boy again!  But he took good care to turn his eyes another way; and, as he wore the helmet of invisibility, the Gorgons knew not in what direction to follow him; nor did he fail to make the best use of the winged slippers, by soaring upward a perpendicular mile or so.  At that height, when the screams of those abominable creatures sounded faintly beneath him, he made a straight course for the island of Seriphus, in order to carry Medusa’s head to King Polydectes.  I have no time to tell you of several marvellous things that befell Perseus, on his way homeward; such as his killing a hideous sea-monster, just as it was on the point of devouring a beautiful maiden; nor how he changed an enormous giant into a mountain of stone, merely by showing him the head of the Gorgon.  If you doubt this latter story, you may make a voyage to Africa, some day or other, and see the very mountain, which is still known by the ancient giant’s name.  Finally, our brave Perseus arrived at the island, where he expected to see his dear mother.  But, during his absence, the wicked king had treated Danae so very ill, that she was compelled to make her escape, and had taken refuge in a temple, where some good old priests were extremely kind to her.  These praiseworthy priests, and the kind-hearted fisherman, who had first shown hospitality to Danae and little Perseus when he found them afloat in the chest, seem to have been the only persons on the island who cared about doing right.  All the rest of the people, as well as King Polydectes himself, were remarkably ill-behaved, and deserved no better destiny than that which was now to happen.  Not finding his mother at home, Perseus went straight to the palace and was immediately ushered into the presence of the king.  Polydectes was by no means rejoiced to see him; for he had felt almost certain, in his own evil mind, that the Gorgons would have torn the poor young man to pieces, and have eaten him up, out of the way.  However, seeing him safely returned, he put the best face he could upon the matter and asked Perseus how he had succeeded.  “Have you performed your promise?” inquired he.  “Have you brought me the head of Medusa with the snaky locks?  If not, young man, it will cost you dear; for I must have a bridal present for the beautiful Princess Hippodamia, and there is nothing else that she would admire so much.”  “Yes, please your Majesty,” answered Perseus, in a quiet way, as if it were no very wonderful deed for such a young man as he to perform.  “I have brought you the Gorgon’s head, snaky locks and all!”  “Indeed!  Pray let me see it,” quoth King Polydectes.  “It must be a very curious spectacle, if all that travellers tell about it be true!”  “Your Majesty is in the right,” replied Perseus.  “It is really an object that will be pretty certain to fix the regards of all who look at it.  And, if your Majesty think fit, I would suggest that a holiday be proclaimed, and that all your Majesty’s subjects be summoned to behold this wonderful curiosity.  Few of them, I imagine, have seen a Gorgon’s head before, and perhaps never may again!”  The king well knew that his subjects were an idle set of reprobates, and very fond of sight-seeing, as idle persons usually are.  So he took the young man’s advice, and sent out heralds and messengers, in all directions, to blow the trumpet at the street-corners, and in the market-places, and wherever two roads met, and summon everybody to court.  Thither, accordingly, came a great multitude of good-for-nothing vagabonds, all of whom, out of pure love of mischief, would have been glad if Perseus had met with some ill-hap, in his encounter with the Gorgons.  If there were any better people in the island (as I really hope there may have been, although the story tells nothing about any such), they stayed quietly at home, minding their own business, and taking care of their little children.  Most of the inhabitants, at all events, ran as fast as they could to the palace, and shoved, and pushed, and elbowed one another, in their eagerness to get near a balcony, on which Perseus showed himself, holding the embroidered wallet in his hand.  On a platform, within full view of the balcony, sat the mighty King Polydectes, amid his evil counsellors, and with his flattering courtiers in a semicircle round about him.  Monarch, counsellors, courtiers, and subjects, all gazed eagerly towards Perseus.  “Show us the head!  Show us the head!” shouted the people; and there was a fierceness in their cry as if they would tear Perseus to pieces, unless he should satisfy them with what he had to show.  “Show us the head of Medusa with the snaky locks!”  A feeling of sorrow and pity came over the youthful Perseus.  “O King Polydectes,” cried he, “and ye many people, I am very loath to show you the Gorgon’s head!”  “Ah, the villain and coward!” yelled the people, more fiercely than before.  “He is making game of us!  He has no Gorgon’s head!  Show us the head, if you have it, or we will take your own head for a football!”  The evil counsellors whispered bad advice in the king’s ear; the courtiers murmured, with one consent, that Perseus had shown disrespect to their royal lord and master; and the great King Polydectes himself waved his hand, and ordered him, with the stern, deep voice of authority, on his peril, to produce the bead.  “Show me the Gorgon’s head, or I will cut off your own!”  And Perseus sighed.  “This instant,” repeated Polydectes, “or you die!”  “Behold it, then!” cried Perseus, in a voice like the blast of a trumpet.  And, suddenly holding up the head, not an eyelid had time to wink before the wicked King Polydectes, his evil counsellors, and all his fierce subjects were no longer anything but the mere images of a monarch and his people.  They were all fixed, forever, in the look and attitude of that moment!  At the first glimpse of the terrible head of Medusa, they whitened into marble!  And Perseus thrust the head back into his wallet, and went to tell his dear mother that she need no longer be afraid of the wicked King Polydectes.    TANGLEWOOD PORCH.  AFTER THE STORY.  “Is not that a very fine story?” asked Eustace.  “O yes, yes!” cried Cowslip, clapping her hands.  “And those funny old women, with only one eye amongst them!  I never heard of anything so strange.”  “As to their one tooth, which they shifted about,” observed Primrose, “there was nothing so very wonderful in that.  I suppose it was a false tooth.  But think of your turning Mercury into Quicksilver, and talking about his sister!  You are too ridiculous!”  “And was she not his sister?” asked Eustace Bright.  “If I had thought of it sooner, I would have described her as a maiden lady, who kept a pet owl!”  “Well, at any rate,” said Primrose, “your story seems to have driven away the mist.”  And, indeed, while the tale was going forward, the vapors had been quite exhaled from the landscape.  A scene was now disclosed which the spectators might almost fancy as having been created since they had last looked in the direction where it lay.  About half a mile distant, in the lap of the valley, now appeared a beautiful lake, which reflected a perfect image of its own wooded banks, and of the summits of the more distant hills.  It gleamed in glassy tranquillity, without the trace of a winged breeze on any part of its bosom.  Beyond its farther shore was Monument Mountain, in a recumbent position, stretching almost across the valley.  Eustace Bright compared it to a huge, headless sphinx, wrapped in a Persian shawl; and, indeed, so rich and diversified was the autumnal foliage of its woods, that the simile of the shawl was by no means too high-colored for the reality.  In the lower ground, between Tanglewood and the lake, the clumps of trees and borders of woodland were chiefly golden-leaved or dusky brown, as having suffered more from frost than the foliage on the hillsides.  Over all this scene there was a genial sunshine, intermingled with a slight haze, which made it unspeakably soft and tender.  O, what a day of Indian summer was it going to be!  The children snatched their baskets, and set forth, with hop, skip, and jump, and all sorts of frisks and gambols; while Cousin Eustace proved his fitness to preside over the party, by outdoing all their antics, and performing several new capers, which none of them could ever hope to imitate.  Behind went a good old dog, whose name was Ben.  He was one of the most respectable and kind-hearted of quadrupeds, and probably felt it to be his duty not to trust the children away from their parents without some better guardian than this feather-brain"]]]
