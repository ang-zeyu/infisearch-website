In all that journey he did not meet a single, solitary soul who had heard that Jesus Christ had come into the world.  Stanley tells the reason why he went back to Africa.  He said:   \"When I found Livingstone I cared no more for missions than the veriest atheist in England.  I had been a press reporter, and my business was to follow armies and to describe battles; to attend conventions and report speeches, but my heart had not been touched with sympathy for missions. When I found this grand old man I asked: 'What is he here for?  Is he crazy?  Is he cracked?  I sat at his feet four months and I saw that a power above his will had taken possession of his life, and given him a hunger to lead poor heathen folk out of their darkness.  \"I have heard the same voice speaking to my heart, 'Follow me,' and I go back to Africa to finish Livingstone's work.\"  This was a few years ago.  To-day there are fifteen Christian Bishops of our communion in Africa.  Eight were present at the Lambeth Conference. One of them, Bishop Crowther, was captured when a boy ten years of age on a slave ship, placed in a mission school, transferred to a high school, then to the university, graduated with honors, and went back to Africa as a Bishop.  As I looked in the face of that black man and thought of his wonderful history, I remembered another man from Africa that carried the cross of my blessed Master up the hill to Calvary, and that this aged servant of Christ was following in his blessed footsteps.  Another of these Bishops was one of the manliest men that I ever looked upon; Bishop Smythies, the picture of manly beauty, honored by his university, beloved by friends, a face gentle and loving as that of St. John.  When I thought of this man going on foot in the interior of Africa, perhaps to die for Christ, I could not keep back the tears, and I went to him and said, \"My good brother, I cannot tell you how my heart goes out to you in loving sympathy.\"  He smiled and said, \"Bishop, when the Church in Jerusalem had more work than it knew how to do, the Holy Ghost sent one of its ministers upon a long journey to convert one African.  Surely it is not much for the Christians of Christian England to send a Christian Bishop to millions who never heard there is a Savior.\"  And now I turn to the opposite quarter of the globe--Australasia, New Zealand, and Polynesia.  When I was a boy there was but one English settlement, and that was known throughout the world as Botany Bay, the abode of the most abandoned criminals of English civilization.  There are to-day twenty-one Bishops in those islands.  I wish I could tell the story inwrought in the lives of Selwyn, Patteson, Williams, and a host of others, some of whom have laid down their lives for Christ.  To-day cannibalism is a thing of the past.  Human sacrifices, thank God, are to be found nowhere on the earth.  There is not one of those islands without its Christian church, and in some of them the last vestige of heathenism has passed away.  They have thousands of Christian men and women under their native pastors.  Surely this is no time to talk about the failure of Christian missions.  Now I turn to Japan.  Less than forty year ago one of our brave American sailors, Commodore Perry, cast anchor on Sunday morning in the harbor of Yeddo.  He called his officers and crew together for public worship, and they sang that old hymn of our fathers, \"Old Hundred\"; and the first sound that this hermit nation heard from her younger sister of the West was that grand old hymn.   Next year Japan will have a constitutional government.  It has already adopted the Christian calendar.  There are more that a million of children in their public schools.  Many of these schools are under the charge of Christian men and women, and it is only a question of a few years when Japan will take her place beside other Christian nations. This is more wonderful when we remember that until recently there was a statute in Japan that, \"if any Christian shall set his foot on the Island of Japan, or if the Christian's God, Jesus, shall come, he shall be beheaded.\"  I turn to China.  I wonder that its doors are open to Christian missions when I remember that Christian nations at the mouth of the cannon have forced upon that people that deadly drug which drags body and soul to death, that their names have been by-words and hissing in Christian lands.  The secret is that God sent to China a young Englishman whose life was hid with Christ in God.  Chinese Gordon saved the nation of China, and his name will be a household word forever.  Surely a people where the poorest laborer can become the first prince of the realm if he becomes the first scholar, and if his son is a vagabond sinks to the place from which his father came, surely such a people have the elements to receive the Gospel of Christ.  Time would fail me to tell the story of missions in North America; I should begin at Hudson's Bay, where Bishop John Horden has lived thirty-five years amid its solitudes and won every one of its Indian tribes to Christianity.  I should tell you of the Bishop of Athabasca, whose home is within the Arctic circle, who could not attend the Lambeth Conference because he could not go and return the same year.  I should tell of my young friend, the Bishop of Mackenzie River, when I knew that he spent nine months each year travelling upon snowshoes and three months in a birch-bark canoe; that the only way that he could carry to them the Gospel was to follow them in the chase, hunt with them, fish with them, lie down in their wigwams in his blanket and always have waiting upon his lips the sweet story of the love of God, our Father.  I told him I wished he would give me his post-office address and I would send him books and papers; he said: \"Bishop, I am a thousand miles from a post-office and only get one mail a year.\"  I should tell you of another, the Bishop of Rupertsland, Dr. Macrae, the only Bishop in Christendom who has a university made up of a Roman Catholic college, a Presbyterian college, and a college of the Church of England; so large-hearted that almost by one consent the people of Manitoba have made him the president of their entire educational system.   If I turn to our own land, it would be to tell you that one hundred years ago the Church was a feeble folk, scattered along the Atlantic coast and known as a people that were everywhere spoken against.  Thank God, to-day her voice is heard in the miner's camp, in the schoolhouse of the border, in the wigwam of the Indians, and sturdy heralds are in the fore-front of that mighty movement which is peopling this land with its millions of souls.  Marvellous as is the progress of Christian missions and the work which has been done in this century, it has largely been committed to the English-speaking race.  In the providence of God races of men have been selected by Him to do His work.  Two hundred years ago the English-speaking people of Europe were less than many of the nations of the Latin races.  Spain outnumbered England two to one.  To-day there are one hundred and fifty millions of English-speaking people in the world, one-tenth of the entire human family. When we think of the future, that by the close of another century more than five hundred millions will be speaking one language, it leads us to ask, on bended knees, why has this commission been committed to this English-speaking race, and what are the responsibilities that rest upon our branch of the Church of God?  I reverently believe that it is because on its civil side it recognizes as no other race that government is a delegated trust from God, who alone has the right to govern.  It represents constitutional government, and it has done so since Bishop Stephen Langton, at the head of the nobles of England, wrung the _Magna Charta_ from King John, and henceforth recognized the sacredness of the citizen, who has been clothed with an individuality unlike any being who lives or will live in all the ages of eternity.  On its religious side it recognizes the two truths which underlie the possibility of the reunion of Christendom--the validity of all Christian Baptism in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and that the condition of fellowship in the Church of God is faith in the incarnate Son of God as contained in the Old Catholic creeds.  Surely we may hold up the olive branch of God's peace over all strife and divisions among the disciples of Christ, and say \"Ye are brethren.\"  When we remember that in the providence of God the Greek tongue was spoken throughout the civilized world to prepare a way for the coming of His Son and the preaching of the blessed Gospel, we see in these facts forerunning tokens of his preparation for the second coming of Jesus Christ.  If I had time to-day, I would love to tell you the story that is inwrought in the history of our noble Missionary Bishops; men who have hazarded their lives for the Lord Jesus.  I wish I could tell you of their ventures of faith, foundations for Christian schools which they have laid with prayers and watered with tears, and with a prophet's eye looked forward to a future when the land will swarm with millions of souls, that so by Christian nurture and Christian training the Church may fulfil the Master's words, \"Feed my lambs.\"  I wish I could tell you of the work, dear to every Bishop's heart, of the daughters of the Cross; yes, and I would like to bring to this Council some of the tempest-tossed and weary souls who have been led out of their darkness to the rest and peace and gladness of Christian faith.  I wish I could bring here some from the northern forests and the prairies of the West, the men of the trembling eye and the wandering foot, that they might thank you for having led them out of their heritage of anguish and sorrow into the light of the children of God.  I may not close without a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8731"],["title","Five Sermons (#7)"],["body","of tribute to those who have fallen asleep.  Since our last General Convention nine Bishops have crossed the river and are waiting for us on the other shore.  Unbidden tears come as I remember the loving Elliot, our St. John; Welles, another holy Herbert; Brown, with his Catholic heart that had room enough to take in all the poor and the sorrowful of his diocese; Harris, every whit a great leader in our Israel; Dunlop, the soldier on the outpost, often debarred brotherly sympathy, who in loneliness and weariness bravely did his work.  Others who were patriarchs of the Church of God--Green, Lee, Potter and Stevens--all men who were great leaders in the Church of God, who bravely did their work, whose faces are upon every heart, and who have entered into rest.  Since I entered the House of Bishops, fifty-three Bishops have laid down their shepherd's staves and entered into rest.   A word, and I have done.  Surely in such a day as this it is no time to discuss shibboleths.  Its is a time for brotherly sympathy and great-hearted work.  With such responsibilities around us there must be no divisions among those who love the same Saviour and look for the same heavenly home.  I remember that at a critical period in our missionary work the venerable Doctor Dyer said to me with tears in his eyes, \"Strife is an awful price to pay for the best results, but strife among the kinsmen of Christ in the presence of those for whom He died, and when wandering souls are going down to death, is almost an unpardonable sin.\"  May I not ask you to-day, dear brothers and sisters, what have we done to help on in the great work which is to be done in the eventide of the world?  What lonely missionary have we remembered in prayer during the past week?  What wanderer have we tried with love to lead to the Saviour?  Have we given the cost of the trimmings of a dress?  Have we made any sacrifices for Him who gave Himself for us?  May I not ask you to-day here beside God's altar to consecrate all you have and are to His service?  With some of us the eventide draws on.  A little while, such a little while, just time enough to do His work, and then the end shall come. And when we reach that other home, next to seeing the Saviour, next to having the old ties re-united, will be the comfort and the blessedness of meeting some one whom we helped heavenward and home.      IV. _ADDRESS IN LAMBETH CHAPEL, AT THE FIRST SESSION OF THE LAMBETH CONFERENCE, JULY 3, 1888_.   Most reverend and right reverend brethren: No assembly is fraught with such awful responsibility to God, as a council of the Bishops of His Church.  Since the Holy Spirit presided in the first council of Jerusalem, faithful souls have looked with deep interest to the deliberations of those whom Christ has made the shepherds of His flock, and to whom he gave His promise, \"Lo, I am with you always to the end of the world.\"  The responsibility is greater when division has marred the beauty of the Lamb's Bride.  Our words and acts will surely hasten or (which God forbid) retard the reunion of Christendom.  Feeling the grave responsibility which is imposed on me to-day, my heart cries out as did the prophet's, \"I am a child and cannot speak.\"  Pray for me, venerable brethren, that God may help me to obey His word--\"Whatsoever I command, that shalt thou speak.\"  I would kneel with you at our Master's feet and pray that \"the Holy Spirit may guide us into all truth.\"  We meet as the representatives of national Churches; each with its own peculiar responsibility to God for the souls intrusted to its care; each with all the rights of a national Church, to adapt itself to the varying conditions of human society; and each bound to preserve the order, the faith, the sacraments, and the worship of the Catholic Church, for which it is a trustee.  As we kneel by the table of our common Lord we remember separated brothers.  Division has multiplied division until infidelity sneers at Christianity as an effete superstition, and the modern Sadducee, more bold than his Jewish brother, denies the existence of God.  Millions for whom Christ died have not so much as heard that there is a Saviour.  It will heal no divisions to say, Who is at fault? The sin of schism does not lie at one door.  If one has sinned by self-will, the other has sinned as deeply by lack of charity and love. The way to reunion looks difficult.  To man it is impossible.  No human _eirenicon_ can bridge the gulf of separation.  There are unkind words to be taken back, alienations to be healed, and heartburnings to be forgiven.  Where we are blind, God can make a way.  When \"the God of Peace\" rules in all Christian hearts, our Lord's prayer will be answered--\"That they all may be one, as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they all may be one in Us, that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me.\"  No one branch of the Church is absolutely by itself alone the Catholic Church; all branches need reunion in order to the completeness of the Church.  There are blessed signs that the Holy Spirit is quickening Christian hearts to seek for unity.  We all know that this divided Christianity cannot conquer the world.  At a time when every form of error and sin is banded together to oppose the kingdom of Christ, the world needs the witness of a united Church.  Men must hear again the voice which peals through the lapse of centuries bearing witness to the \"faith once delivered to the saints,\" or else for many souls there will be only rationalism and unbelief--while this sad, weary world, so full of sin and sorrow, is pleading for help, it is a wrong to Christ and to the souls for whom He died that His children should be separated in rival folds.  As baptised into Christ we are brothers. Notwithstanding the hedges of human opinions which men have builded in the garden of the Lord, all who look for salvation alone through faith in Jesus Christ do hold the great verities of Divine faith.  The opinions which separate us are not necessary to be believed in order to salvation.  The truths in which we agree are parts of the Catholic faith.  The Holy Spirit has passed over these human barriers, and set his seal to the labors of separated brethren in Christ, and rewarded them in the salvation of many precious souls.  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the renewing and sanctifying influences of the Holy Ghost are the same in the peasant in the cottage, and in the emperor on the throne.  They share with us in the long line of confessors and martyrs for Christ.  We would not rob them of one sheaf which they have gathered in the garner of the Lord.  We rejoice that Churches with a like historic lineage with us are seeking reunion.  Churches whose faith has been dimmed by coldness or clouded by error are being quickened into new life from the Incarnate Son of God.  Our hearts go out in loving sympathy to the Old Catholics of Europe and America, whose names always will be linked with Selwyn, Wilberforce, and Wordsworth, Whittingham, Kerfoot, and Brown, in defence of the faith. It is with deep sorrow that we remember that the Church of Rome has separated herself from the teaching of the primitive Church by additions to the faith once delivered to the saints, and by claiming for its Bishop prerogatives which belong only to the Divine Head of the Church While we honor the devotion and zeal of her missionary heroes, and rejoice at the good works of multitudes of her children, we lament that lack of charity which anathematizes disciples of Christ who have carried the Gospel to the ends of the earth.  We bless God's Holy Name for the fraternal work which has been carried on under the guidance of the see of Canterbury, and which we trust will lead ancient Churches to a deeper personal faith in Jesus Christ.   We are sad that some of our kinsmen in Christ, children of one mother, have forsaken her ways.  God can over-rule even this sorrow, so that it shall fall out to the furtherance of the Gospel.  They must take with them precious memories of the love and the faith of the mother whom they have forsaken, and of the liberty wherewith the truth in Christ has made her children free--under God these may be a link in the chain of His providence to the restoration of unity.  It is a singular providence that at this period of the world's history, when marvellous discoveries have united the people of divers tongues in common interests, He has placed the Anglo-Saxon race in the forefront of the nations.  They are carrying civilization to the ends of the earth.  They are bringing liberty to the oppressed, elevating the down-trodden, and are giving to all these divers tongues and kindreds their customs, traditions, and laws.  I reverently believe that the Anglo-Saxon Church has been preserved by God's Providence (if her children will accept this Mission) to heal the divisions of Christendom, and lead on in His work to be done in the eventide of the world.  She holds the truths which underlie the possibility of reunion, the validity of all Christian baptism in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.  She ministers the two sacraments of Christ as of perpetual obligation, and makes faith in Jesus Christ, as contained in the Catholic Creeds, a condition of Christian fellowship.  The Anglo-Saxon Church does not perplex men with theories and shibboleths which many a poor Ephraimite cannot speak--she believes in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ His only Son, and in the Holy Ghost, three Persons and one God, but she does not weaken faith in the Triune God by human speculations about the Trinity in Unity.  She believes that the sacred Scriptures were written by inspiration of God, but she has no theory about inspiration.  She holds up the Atonement of Christ as the only hope of a lost world; but she has no philosophy about the Atonement. She teaches that it is through the Holy Ghost that men are united to Christ.
