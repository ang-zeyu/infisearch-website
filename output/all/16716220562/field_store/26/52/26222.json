They are as the beasts of the field that know not good from evil, and for them the Lord has not died.’  The young Fisherman’s eyes filled with tears when he heard the bitter words of the Priest, and he rose up from his knees and said to him, ‘Father, the Fauns live in the forest and are glad, and on the rocks sit the Mermen with their harps of red gold.  Let me be as they are, I beseech thee, for their days are as the days of flowers.  And as for my soul, what doth my soul profit me, if it stand between me and the thing that I love?’  ‘The love of the body is vile,’ cried the Priest, knitting his brows, ‘and vile and evil are the pagan things God suffers to wander through His world.  Accursed be the Fauns of the woodland, and accursed be the singers of the sea!  I have heard them at night-time, and they have sought to lure me from my beads.  They tap at the window, and laugh. They whisper into my ears the tale of their perilous joys.  They tempt me with temptations, and when I would pray they make mouths at me.  They are lost, I tell thee, they are lost.  For them there is no heaven nor hell, and in neither shall they praise God’s name.’  ‘Father,’ cried the young Fisherman, ‘thou knowest not what thou sayest. Once in my net I snared the daughter of a King.  She is fairer than the morning star, and whiter than the moon.  For her body I would give my soul, and for her love I would surrender heaven.  Tell me what I ask of thee, and let me go in peace.’  ‘Away!  Away!’ cried the Priest: ‘thy leman is lost, and thou shalt be lost with her.’  And he gave him no blessing, but drove him from his door.  And the young Fisherman went down into the market-place, and he walked slowly, and with bowed head, as one who is in sorrow.  And when the merchants saw him coming, they began to whisper to each other, and one of them came forth to meet him, and called him by name, and said to him, ‘What hast thou to sell?’  ‘I will sell thee my soul,’ he answered.  ‘I pray thee buy it of me, for I am weary of it.  Of what use is my soul to me?  I cannot see it.  I may not touch it.  I do not know it.’  But the merchants mocked at him, and said, ‘Of what use is a man’s soul to us?  It is not worth a clipped piece of silver.  Sell us thy body for a slave, and we will clothe thee in sea-purple, and put a ring upon thy finger, and make thee the minion of the great Queen.  But talk not of the soul, for to us it is nought, nor has it any value for our service.’  And the young Fisherman said to himself: ‘How strange a thing this is! The Priest telleth me that the soul is worth all the gold in the world, and the merchants say that it is not worth a clipped piece of silver.’ And he passed out of the market-place, and went down to the shore of the sea, and began to ponder on what he should do.                                  * * * * *  And at noon he remembered how one of his companions, who was a gatherer of samphire, had told him of a certain young Witch who dwelt in a cave at the head of the bay and was very cunning in her witcheries.  And he set to and ran, so eager was he to get rid of his soul, and a cloud of dust followed him as he sped round the sand of the shore.  By the itching of her palm the young Witch knew his coming, and she laughed and let down her red hair.  With her red hair falling around her, she stood at the opening of the cave, and in her hand she had a spray of wild hemlock that was blossoming.  ‘What d’ye lack?  What d’ye lack?’ she cried, as he came panting up the steep, and bent down before her.  ‘Fish for thy net, when the wind is foul?  I have a little reed-pipe, and when I blow on it the mullet come sailing into the bay.  But it has a price, pretty boy, it has a price. What d’ye lack?  What d’ye lack?  A storm to wreck the ships, and wash the chests of rich treasure ashore?  I have more storms than the wind has, for I serve one who is stronger than the wind, and with a sieve and a pail of water I can send the great galleys to the bottom of the sea. But I have a price, pretty boy, I have a price.  What d’ye lack?  What d’ye lack?  I know a flower that grows in the valley, none knows it but I.  It has purple leaves, and a star in its heart, and its juice is as white as milk.  Shouldst thou touch with this flower the hard lips of the Queen, she would follow thee all over the world.  Out of the bed of the King she would rise, and over the whole world she would follow thee.  And it has a price, pretty boy, it has a price.  What d’ye lack?  What d’ye lack?  I can pound a toad in a mortar, and make broth of it, and stir the broth with a dead man’s hand.  Sprinkle it on thine enemy while he sleeps, and he will turn into a black viper, and his own mother will slay him.  With a wheel I can draw the Moon from heaven, and in a crystal I can show thee Death.  What d’ye lack?  What d’ye lack?  Tell me thy desire, and I will give it thee, and thou shalt pay me a price, pretty boy, thou shalt pay me a price.’  ‘My desire is but for a little thing,’ said the young Fisherman, ‘yet hath the Priest been wroth with me, and driven me forth.  It is but for a little thing, and the merchants have mocked at me, and denied me. Therefore am I come to thee, though men call thee evil, and whatever be thy price I shall pay it.’  ‘What wouldst thou?’ asked the Witch, coming near to him.  ‘I would send my soul away from me,’ answered the young Fisherman.  The Witch grew pale, and shuddered, and hid her face in her blue mantle. ‘Pretty boy, pretty boy,’ she muttered, ‘that is a terrible thing to do.’  He tossed his brown curls and laughed.  ‘My soul is nought to me,’ he answered.  ‘I cannot see it.  I may not touch it.  I do not know it.’  ‘What wilt thou give me if I tell thee?’ asked the Witch, looking down at him with her beautiful eyes.  ‘Five pieces of gold,’ he said, ‘and my nets, and the wattled house where I live, and the painted boat in which I sail.  Only tell me how to get rid of my soul, and I will give thee all that I possess.’  She laughed mockingly at him, and struck him with the spray of hemlock. ‘I can turn the autumn leaves into gold,’ she answered, ‘and I can weave the pale moonbeams into silver if I will it.  He whom I serve is richer than all the kings of this world, and has their dominions.’  ‘What then shall I give thee,’ he cried, ‘if thy price be neither gold nor silver?’  The Witch stroked his hair with her thin white hand.  ‘Thou must dance with me, pretty boy,’ she murmured, and she smiled at him as she spoke.  ‘Nought but that?’ cried the young Fisherman in wonder and he rose to his feet.  ‘Nought but that,’ she answered, and she smiled at him again.  ‘Then at sunset in some secret place we shall dance together,’ he said, ‘and after that we have danced thou shalt tell me the thing which I desire to know.’  She shook her head.  ‘When the moon is full, when the moon is full,’ she muttered.  Then she peered all round, and listened.  A blue bird rose screaming from its nest and circled over the dunes, and three spotted birds rustled through the coarse grey grass and whistled to each other. There was no other sound save the sound of a wave fretting the smooth pebbles below.  So she reached out her hand, and drew him near to her and put her dry lips close to his ear.  ‘To-night thou must come to the top of the mountain,’ she whispered.  ‘It is a Sabbath, and He will be there.’  The young Fisherman started and looked at her, and she showed her white teeth and laughed.  ‘Who is He of whom thou speakest?’ he asked.  ‘It matters not,’ she answered.  ‘Go thou to-night, and stand under the branches of the hornbeam, and wait for my coming.  If a black dog run towards thee, strike it with a rod of willow, and it will go away.  If an owl speak to thee, make it no answer.  When the moon is full I shall be with thee, and we will dance together on the grass.’  ‘But wilt thou swear to me to tell me how I may send my soul from me?’ he made question.  She moved out into the sunlight, and through her red hair rippled the wind.  ‘By the hoofs of the goat I swear it,’ she made answer.  ‘Thou art the best of the witches,’ cried the young Fisherman, ‘and I will surely dance with thee to-night on the top of the mountain.  I would indeed that thou hadst asked of me either gold or silver.  But such as thy price is thou shalt have it, for it is but a little thing.’  And he doffed his cap to her, and bent his head low, and ran back to the town filled with a great joy.  And the Witch watched him as he went, and when he had passed from her sight she entered her cave, and having taken a mirror from a box of carved cedarwood, she set it up on a frame, and burned vervain on lighted charcoal before it, and peered through the coils of the smoke.  And after a time she clenched her hands in anger.  ‘He should have been mine,’ she muttered, ‘I am as fair as she is.’                                  * * * * *  And that evening, when the moon had risen, the young Fisherman climbed up to the top of the mountain, and stood under the branches of the hornbeam. Like a targe of polished metal the round sea lay at his feet, and the shadows of the fishing-boats moved in the little bay.  A great owl, with yellow sulphurous eyes, called to him by his name, but he made it no answer.  A black dog ran towards him and snarled.  He struck it with a rod of willow, and it went away whining.  At midnight the witches came flying through the air like bats.  ‘Phew!’ they cried, as they lit upon the ground, ‘there is some one here we know not!’ and they sniffed about, and chattered to each other, and made signs.  Last of all came the young Witch, with her red hair streaming in the wind.  She wore a dress of gold tissue embroidered with peacocks’ eyes, and a little cap of green velvet was on her head.  ‘Where is he, where is he?’ shrieked the witches when they saw her, but she only laughed, and ran to the hornbeam, and taking the Fisherman by the hand she led him out into"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8730"],["title","A Little Bush Maid (#0)"],["body","LITTLE BUSH MAID  By Mary Grant Bruce   CONTENTS    CHAPTER I.

BILLABONG   Norah’s home was on a big station in the north of Victoria—so large that you could almost, in her own phrase, “ride all day and never see any one you didn’t want to see”; which was a great advantage in Norah’s eyes. Not that Billabong Station ever seemed to the little girl a place that you needed to praise in any way. It occupied so very modest a position as the loveliest part of the world!  The homestead was built on a gentle rise that sloped gradually away on every side; in front to the wide plain, dotted with huge gum trees and great grey box groves, and at the back, after you had passed through the well-kept vegetable garden and orchard, to a long lagoon, bordered with trees and fringed with tall bulrushes and waving reeds.  The house itself was old and quaint and rambling, part of the old wattle and dab walls yet remaining in some of the outhouses, as well as the grey shingle roof. There was a more modern part, for the house had been added to from time to time by different owners, though no additions had been made since Norah’s father brought home his young wife, fifteen years before this story opens. Then he had built a large new wing with wide and lofty rooms, and round all had put a very broad, tiled verandah. The creepers had had time to twine round the massive posts in those fifteen years, and some even lay in great masses on the verandah roof; tecoma, pink and salmon-coloured; purple bougainvillea, and the snowy mandevillea clusters. Hard-headed people said this was not good for the building—but Norah’s mother had planted them, and because she had loved them they were never touched.  There was a huge front garden, not at all a proper kind of garden, but a great stretch of smooth buffalo grass, dotted with all kinds of trees, amongst which flower beds cropped up in most unexpected and unlikely places, just as if some giant had flung them out on the grass like a handful of pebbles that scattered as they flew. They were always trim and tidy, and the gardener, Hogg, was terribly strict, and woe betide the author of any small footmarks that he found on one of the freshly raked surfaces. Nothing annoyed him more than the odd bulbs that used to come up in the midst of his precious buffalo grass; impertinent crocuses and daffodils and hyacinths, that certainly had no right there. “Blest if I know how they ever gets there!” Hogg would say, scratching his head. Whereat Norah was wont to retire behind a pyramid tree for purposes of mirth.  Hogg’s sworn foe was Lee Wing, the Chinese gardener, who reigned supreme in the orchard and the kingdom of vegetables—not quite the same thing as the vegetable kingdom, by the way! Lee Wing was very fat, his broad, yellow face generally wearing a cheerful grin—unless he happened to catch sight of Hogg. His long pigtail was always concealed under his flapping straw hat. Once Jim, who was Norah’s big brother, had found him asleep in his hut with the pigtail drooping over the edge of the bunk. Jim thought the opportunity too good to lose and, with such deftness that the Celestial never stirred, he tied the end of the pigtail to the back of a chair—with rather startling results when Lee Wing awoke with a sudden sense of being late, and made a spring from the bunk. The chair of course followed him, and the loud yell of fear and pain raised by the victim brought half the homestead to the scene of the catastrophe. Jim was the only one who did not wait for developments. He found business at the lagoon.  The queerest part of it was that Lee Wing firmly believed Hogg to be the author of his woe. Nothing moved him from this view, not even when Jim, finding how matters stood, owned up like a man. “You allee same goo’ boy,” said the pigtailed one, proffering him a succulent raw turnip. “Me know. You tellee fine large crammee. Hogg, he tellee crammee, too. So dly up!” And Jim, finding expostulation useless, “dried up” accordingly and ate the turnip, which was better than the leek.  To the right of the homestead at Billabong a clump of box trees sheltered the stables that were the unspoken pride of Mr. Linton’s heart.  Before his time the stables had been a conglomerate mass, bark-roofed, slab-sided, falling to decay; added to as each successive owner had thought fit, with a final mixture of old and new that was neither convenient nor beautiful. Mr. Linton had apologised to his horses during his first week of occupancy and, in the second, turning them out to grass with less apology, had pulled down the rickety old sheds, replacing them with a compact and handsome building of red brick, with room for half a dozen buggies, men’s quarters, harness and feed rooms, many loose boxes and a loft where a ball could have been held—and where, indeed, many a one was held, when all the young farmers and stockmen and shearers from far and near brought each his lass and tripped it from early night to early dawn, to the strains of old Andy Ferguson’s fiddle and young Dave Boone’s concertina. Norah had been allowed to look on at one or two of these gatherings. She thought them the height of human bliss, and was only sorry that sheer inability to dance prevented her from “taking the floor” with Mick Shanahan, the horse breaker, who had paid her the compliment of asking her first. It was a great compliment, too, Norah felt, seeing what a man of agility and splendid accomplishments was Mick—and that she was only nine at the time.  There was one loose box which was Norah’s very own property, and without her permission no horse was ever put in it except its rightful occupant—Bobs, whose name was proudly displayed over the door in Jim’s best carving.  Bobs had always belonged to Norah, He had been given to her as a foal, when Norah used to ride a round little black sheltie, as easy to fall off as to mount. He was a beauty even then, Norah thought; and her father had looked approvingly at the long-legged baby, with his fine, well-bred head. “You will have something worth riding when that fellow is fit to break in, my girlie,” he had said, and his prophecy had been amply fulfilled. Mick Shanahan said he’d never put a leg over a finer pony. Norah knew there never had been a finer anywhere. He was a big pony, very dark bay in colour, and “as handsome as paint,” and with the kindest disposition; full of life and “go,” but without the smallest particle of vice. It was an even question which loved the other best, Bobs or Norah. No one ever rode him except his little mistress. The pair were hard to beat—so the men said.  To Norah the stables were the heart of Billabong. The house was all very well—of course she loved it; and she loved her own little room, with its red carpet and dainty white furniture, and the two long windows that looked out over the green plain. That was all right; so were the garden and the big orchard, especially in summer time! The only part that was not “all right” was the drawing-room—an apartment of gloomy, seldom-used splendour that Norah hated with her whole heart.  But the stables were an abiding refuge. She was never dull there. Apart from the never-failing welcome in Bobs’ loose box, there was the dim, fragrant loft, where the sunbeams only managed to send dusty rays of light across the gloom. Here Norah used to lie on the sweet hay and think tremendous thoughts; here also she laid deep plans for catching rats—and caught scores in traps of her own devising. Norah hated rats, but nothing could induce her to wage war against the mice. “Poor little chaps!” she said; “they’re so little—and—and soft!” And she was quite saddened if by chance she found a stray mouse in any of her shrewdly-designed traps for the benefit of the larger game which infested the stables and had even the hardihood to annoy Bobs!  Norah had never known her mother. She was only a tiny baby when that gay little mother died—a sudden, terrible blow, that changed her father in a night from a young man to an old one. It was nearly twelve years ago, now, but no one ever dared to speak to David Linton of his wife. Sometimes Norah used to ask Jim about mother—for Jim was fifteen, and could remember just a little; but his memories were so vague and misty that his information was unsatisfactory. And, after all, Norah did not trouble much. She had always been so happy that she could not imagine that to have had a mother would have made any particular difference to her happiness. You see, she did not know.  She had grown just as the bush wild flowers grow—hardy, unchecked, almost untended; for, though old nurse had always been there, her nurseling had gone her own way from the time she could toddle. She was everybody’s pet and plaything; the only being who had power to make her stern, silent father smile—almost the only one who ever saw the softer side of his character. He was fond and proud of Jim—glad that the boy was growing up straight and strong and manly, able to make his way in the world. But Norah was his heart’s desire.  Of course she was spoilt—if spoiling consists in rarely checking an impulse. All her life Norah had done pretty well whatever she wanted—which meant that she had lived out of doors, followed in Jim’s footsteps wherever practicable (and in a good many ways most people would have thought distinctly impracticable), and spent about two-thirds of her waking time on horseback. But the spoiling was not of a very harmful"]]]
