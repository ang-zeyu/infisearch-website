For nearly half an hour the three moved slowly along the tunnel, which made many twists and turns and sometimes slanted downward and sometimes upward. Finally Cap'n Bill stopped short, with an exclamation of disappointment, and held the flickering candle far ahead to light the scene.  \"What's wrong?\" demanded Trot, who could see nothing because the sailor's form completely filled the hole.  \"Why, we've come to the end of our travels, I guess,\" he replied.  \"Is the hole blocked?\" inquired the Ork.  \"No; it's wuss nor that,\" replied Cap'n Bill sadly. \"I'm on the edge of a precipice. Wait a minute an' I'll move along and let you see for yourselves. Be careful, Trot, not to fall.\"  Then he crept forward a little and moved to one side, holding the candle so that the girl could see to follow him. The Ork came next and now all three knelt on a narrow ledge of rock which dropped straight away and left a huge black space which the tiny flame of the candle could not illuminate.  \"H-m!\" said the Ork, peering over the edge; \"this doesn't look very promising, I'll admit. But let me take your candle, and I'll fly down and see what's below us.\"  \"Aren't you afraid?\" asked Trot.  \"Certainly I'm afraid,\" responded the Ork. \"But if we intend to escape we can't stay on this shelf forever. So, as I notice you poor creatures cannot fly, it is my duty to explore the place for you.\"  Cap'n Bill handed the Ork the candle, which had now burned to about half its length. The Ork took it in one claw rather cautiously and then tipped its body forward and slipped over the edge. They heard a queer buzzing sound, as the tail revolved, and a brisk flapping of the peculiar wings, but they were more interested just then in following with their eyes the tiny speck of light which marked the location of the candle. This light first made a great circle, then dropped slowly downward and suddenly was extinguished, leaving everything before them black as ink.  \"Hi, there! How did that happen?\" cried the Ork.  \"It blew out, I guess,\" shouted Cap'n Bill. \"Fetch it here.\"  \"I can't see where you are,\" said the Ork.  So Cap'n Bill got out another candle and lighted it, and its flame enabled the Ork to fly back to them. It alighted on the edge and held out the bit of candle.  \"What made it stop burning?\" asked the creature.  \"The wind,\" said Trot. \"You must be more careful, this time.\"  \"What's the place like?\" inquired Cap'n Bill.  \"I don't know, yet; but there must be a bottom to it, so I'll try to find it.\"  With this the Ork started out again and this time sank downward more slowly. Down, down, down it went, till the candle was a mere spark, and then it headed away to the left and Trot and Cap'n Bill lost all sight of it.  In a few minutes, however, they saw the spark of light again, and as the sailor still held the second lighted candle the Ork made straight toward them. It was only a few yards distant when suddenly it dropped the candle with a cry of pain and next moment alighted, fluttering wildly, upon the rocky ledge.  \"What's the matter?\" asked Trot.  \"It bit me!\" wailed the Ork. \"I don't like your candles. The thing began to disappear slowly as soon as I took it in my claw, and it grew smaller and smaller until just now it turned and bit me--a most unfriendly thing to do. Oh--oh! Ouch, what a bite!\"  \"That's the nature of candles, I'm sorry to say,\" explained Cap'n Bill, with a grin. \"You have to handle 'em mighty keerful. But tell us, what did you find down there?\"  \"I found a way to continue our journey,\" said the Ork, nursing tenderly the claw which had been burned. \"Just below us is a great lake of black water, which looked so cold and wicked that it made me shudder; but away at the left there's a big tunnel, which we can easily walk through. I don't know where it leads to, of course, but we must follow it and find out.\" \"why, we can't get to it,\" protested the little girl. \"We can't fly, as you do, you must remember.\"  \"No, that's true,\" replied the Ork musingly. \"Your bodies are built very poorly, it seems to me, since all you can do is crawl upon the earth's surface. But you may ride upon my back, and in that way I can promise you a safe journey to the tunnel.\"  \"Are you strong enough to carry us?\" asked Cap'n Bill, doubtfully.  \"Yes, indeed; I'm strong enough to carry a dozen of you, if you could find a place to sit,\" was the reply; \"but there's only room between my wings for one at a time, so I'll have to make two trips.\"  \"All right; I'll go first,\" decided Cap'n Bill.  He lit another candle for Trot to hold while they were gone and to light the Ork on his return to her, and then the old sailor got upon the Ork's back, where he sat with his wooden leg sticking straight out sidewise.  \"If you start to fall, clasp your arms around my neck,\" advised the creature.  \"If I start to fall, it's good night an' pleasant dreams,\" said Cap'n Bill.  \"All ready?\" asked the Ork.  \"Start the buzz-tail,\" said Cap'n Bill, with a tremble in his voice. But the Ork flew away so gently that the old man never even tottered in his seat. Trot watched the light of Cap'n Bill's candle till it disappeared in the far distance. She didn't like to be left alone on this dangerous ledge, with a lake of black water hundreds of feet below her; but she was a brave little girl and waited patiently for the return of the Ork. It came even sooner than she had expected and the creature said to her:  \"Your friend is safe in the tunnel. Now, then, get aboard and I'll carry you to him in a jiffy.\"  I'm sure not many little girls would have cared to take that awful ride through the huge black cavern on the back of a skinny Ork. Trot didn't care for it, herself, but it just had to be done and so she did it as courageously as possible. Her heart beat fast and she was so nervous she could scarcely hold the candle in her fingers as the Ork sped swiftly through the darkness.  It seemed like a long ride to her, yet in reality the Ork covered the distance in a wonderfully brief period of time and soon Trot stood safely beside Cap'n Bill on the level floor of a big arched tunnel. The sailor-man was very glad to greet his little comrade again and both were grateful to the Ork for his assistance.  \"I dunno where this tunnel leads to,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, \"but it surely looks more promisin' than that other hole we crept through.\"  \"When the Ork is rested,\" said Trot, \"we'll travel on and see what happens.\"  \"Rested!\" cried the Ork, as scornfully as his shrill voice would allow. \"That bit of flying didn't tire me at all. I'm used to flying days at a time, without ever once stopping.\"  \"Then let's move on,\" proposed Cap'n Bill. He still held in his hand one lighted candle, so Trot blew out the other flame and placed her candle in the sailor's big pocket. She knew it was not wise to burn two candles at once.  The tunnel was straight and smooth and very easy to walk through, so they made good progress. Trot thought that the tunnel began about two miles from the cavern where they had been cast by the whirlpool, but now it was impossible to guess the miles traveled, for they walked steadily for hours and hours without any change in their surroundings.  Finally Cap'n Bill stopped to rest.  \"There's somethin' queer about this 'ere tunnel, I'm certain,\" he declared, wagging his head dolefully. \"Here's three candles gone a'ready, an' only three more left us, yet the tunnel's the same as it was when we started. An' how long it's goin' to keep up, no one knows.\"  \"Couldn't we walk without a light?\" asked Trot. \"The way seems safe enough.\"  \"It does right now,\" was the reply, \"but we can't tell when we are likely to come to another gulf, or somethin' jes' as dangerous. In that case we'd be killed afore we knew it.\"  \"Suppose I go ahead?\" suggested the Ork.  \"I don't fear a fall, you know, and if anything happens I'll call out and warn you.\"  \"That's a good idea,\" declared Trot, and Cap'n Bill thought so, too. So the Ork started off ahead, quite in the dark, and hand in band the two followed him.  When they had walked in this way for a good long time the Ork halted and demanded food. Cap'n Bill had not mentioned food because there was so little left--only three biscuits and a lump of cheese about as big as his two fingers--but he gave the Ork half of a biscuit, sighing as he did so. The creature didn't care for the cheese, so the sailor divided it between himself and Trot. They lighted a candle and sat down in the tunnel while they ate.  \"My feet hurt me,\" grumbled the Ork.  \"I'm not used to walking and this rocky passage is so uneven and lumpy that it hurts me to walk upon it.\"  \"Can't you fly along?\" asked Trot.  \"No; the roof is too low,\" said the Ork.  After the meal they resumed their journey, which Trot began to fear would never end. When Cap'n Bill noticed how tired the little girl was, he paused and lighted a match and looked at his big silver watch.  \"Why, it's night!\" he exclaimed. \"We've tramped all day, an' still we're in this awful passage, which mebbe goes straight through the middle of the world, an' mebbe is a circle--in which case we can keep walkin' till doomsday. Not knowin' what's before us so well as we know what's behind us, I propose we make a stop, now, an' try to sleep till mornin'.\"  \"That will suit me,\" asserted the Ork, with a groan. \"My feet are hurting me dreadfully and for the last few miles I've been limping with pain.\"  \"My foot hurts, too,\" said the sailor, looking for a smooth place on the rocky floor to sit down.  \"Your foot!\" cried the Ork. \"why, you've only one to hurt you, while I have four. So I suffer four times as much as you possibly can. Here; hold the candle while I look at the bottoms of my claws. I declare,\" he said, examining them by the flickering light, \"there are bunches of pain all over them!\"  \"P'r'aps,\" said Trot, who was very glad to sit down beside her companions, \"you've got corns.\"  \"Corns? Nonsense! Orks never have corns,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957"],["title","The Scarecrow of Oz (#4)"],["body","\" protested the creature, rubbing its sore feet tenderly.  \"Then mebbe they're--they're-- What do you call 'em, Cap'n Bill? Something 'bout the Pilgrim's Progress, you know.\"  \"Bunions,\" said Cap'n Bill.  \"Oh, yes; mebbe you've got bunions.\"  \"It is possible,\" moaned the Ork.  \"But whatever they are, another day of such walking on them would drive me crazy.\"  \"I'm sure they'll feel better by mornin',\" said Cap'n Bill, encouragingly. \"Go to sleep an' try to forget your sore feet.\"  The Ork cast a reproachful look at the sailor-man, who didn't see it. Then the creature asked plaintively: \"Do we eat now, or do we starve?\"  \"There's only half a biscuit left for you,\" answered Cap'n Bill. \"No one knows how long we'll have to stay in this dark tunnel, where there's nothing whatever to eat; so I advise you to save that morsel o' food till later.\"  \"Give it me now!\" demanded the Ork. \"If I'm going to starve, I'll do it all at once--not by degrees.\"  Cap'n Bill produced the biscuit and the creature ate it in a trice. Trot was rather hungry and whispered to Cap'n Bill that she'd take part of her share; but the old man secretly broke his own half-biscuit in two, saving Trot's share for a time of greater need.  He was beginning to be worried over the little girl's plight and long after she was asleep and the Ork was snoring in a rather disagreeable manner, Cap'n Bill sat with his back to a rock and smoked his pipe and tried to think of some way to escape from this seemingly endless tunnel. But after a time he also slept, for hobbling on a wooden leg all day was tiresome, and there in the dark slumbered the three adventurers for many hours, until the Ork roused itself and kicked the old sailor with one foot.  \"It must be another day,\" said he.     Chapter Four  Daylight at Last   Cap'n Bill rubbed his eyes, lit a match and consulted his watch.  \"Nine o'clock.  Yes, I guess it's another day, sure enough. Shall we go on?\" he asked.  \"Of course,\" replied the Ork. \"Unless this tunnel is different from everything else in the world, and has no end, we'll find a way out of it sooner or later.\"  The sailor gently wakened Trot. She felt much rested by her long sleep and sprang to her feet eagerly.  \"Let's start, Cap'n,\" was all she said.  They resumed the journey and had only taken a few steps when the Ork cried \"Wow!\" and made a great fluttering of its wings and whirling of its tail. The others, who were following a short distance behind, stopped abruptly.  \"What's the matter?\" asked Cap'n Bill.  \"Give us a light,\" was the reply. \"I think we've come to the end of the tunnel.\" Then, while Cap'n Bill lighted a candle, the creature added: \"If that is true, we needn't have wakened so soon, for we were almost at the end of this place when we went to sleep.\"  The sailor-man and Trot came forward with a light. A wall of rock really faced the tunnel, but now they saw that the opening made a sharp turn to the left. So they followed on, by a narrower passage, and then made another sharp turn this time to the right.  \"Blow out the light, Cap'n,\" said the Ork, in a pleased voice. \"We've struck daylight.\"  Daylight at last! A shaft of mellow light fell almost at their feet as Trot and the sailor turned the corner of the passage, but it came from above, and raising their eyes they found they were at the bottom of a deep, rocky well, with the top far, far above their heads. And here the passage ended.  For a while they gazed in silence, at least two of them being filled with dismay at the sight. But the Ork merely whistled softly and said cheerfully:  \"That was the toughest journey I ever had the misfortune to undertake, and I'm glad it's over. Yet, unless I can manage to fly to the top of this pit, we are entombed here forever.\"  \"Do you think there is room enough for you to fly in?\" asked the little girl anxiously; and Cap'n Bill added:  \"It's a straight-up shaft, so I don't see how you'll ever manage it.\"  \"Were I an ordinary bird--one of those horrid feathered things--I wouldn't even make the attempt to fly out,\" said the Ork.  \"But my mechanical propeller tail can accomplish wonders, and whenever you're ready I'll show you a trick that is worth while.\"  \"Oh!\" exclaimed Trot; \"do you intend to take us up, too?\"  \"Why not?\"  \"I thought,\" said Cap'n Bill, \"as you'd go first, an' then send somebody to help us by lettin' down a rope.\"  \"Ropes are dangerous,\" replied the Ork, \"and I might not be able to find one to reach all this distance. Besides, it stands to reason that if I can get out myself I can also carry you two with me.\"  \"Well, I'm not afraid,\" said Trot, who longed to be on the earth's surface again.  \"S'pose we fall?\" suggested Cap'n Bill, doubtfully.  \"Why, in that case we would all fall together,\" returned the Ork. \"Get aboard, little girl; sit across my shoulders and put both your arms around my neck.\"  Trot obeyed and when she was seated on the Ork, Cap'n Bill inquired:  \"How 'bout me, Mr. Ork?\"  \"Why, I think you'd best grab hold of my rear legs and let me carry you up in that manner,\" was the reply.  Cap'n Bill looked way up at the top of the well, and then he looked at the Ork's slender, skinny legs and heaved a deep sigh.  \"It's goin' to be some dangle, I guess; but if you don't waste too much time on the way up, I may be able to hang on,\" said he.  \"All ready, then!\" cried the Ork, and at once his whirling tail began to revolve. Trot felt herself rising into the air; when the creature's legs left the ground Cap'n Bill grasped two of them firmly and held on for dear life.  The Ork's body was tipped straight upward, and Trot had to embrace the neck very tightly to keep from sliding off. Even in this position the Ork had trouble in escaping the rough sides of the well. Several times it exclaimed \"Wow!\" as it bumped its back, or a wing hit against some jagged projection; but the tail kept whirling with remarkable swiftness and the daylight grew brighter and brighter. It was, indeed, a long journey from the bottom to the top, yet almost before Trot realized they had come so far, they popped out of the hole into the clear air and sunshine and a moment later the Ork alighted gently upon the ground.  The release was so sudden that even with the creature's care for its passengers Cap'n Bill struck the earth with a shock that sent him rolling heel over head; but by the time Trot had slid down from her seat the old sailor-man was sitting up and looking around him with much satisfaction.  \"It's sort o' pretty here,\" said he.  \"Earth is a beautiful place!\" cried Trot.  \"I wonder where on earth we are?\" pondered the Ork, turning first one bright eye and then the other to this side and that. Trees there were, in plenty, and shrubs and flowers and green turf. But there were no houses; there were no paths; there was no sign of civilization whatever.  \"Just before I settled down on the ground I thought I caught a view of the ocean,\" said the Ork. \"Let's see if I was right.\" Then he flew to a little hill, near by, and Trot and Cap'n Bill followed him more slowly. When they stood on the top of the hill they could see the blue waves of the ocean in front of them, to the right of them, and at the left of them. Behind the hill was a forest that shut out the view.  \"I hope it ain't an island, Trot,\" said Cap'n Bill gravely.  \"If it is, I s'pose we're prisoners,\" she replied.  \"Ezzackly so, Trot.\"  \"But, 'even so, it's better than those terr'ble underground tunnels and caverns,\" declared the girl.  \"You are right, little one,\" agreed the Ork. \"Anything above ground is better than the best that lies under ground. So let's not quarrel with our fate but be thankful we've escaped.\"  \"We are, indeed!\" she replied. \"But I wonder if we can find something to eat in this place?\"  \"Let's explore an' find out,\" proposed Cap'n Bill. \"Those trees over at the left look like cherry-trees.\"  On the way to them the explorers had to walk through a tangle of vines and Cap'n Bill, who went first, stumbled and pitched forward on his face.  \"Why, it's a melon!\" cried Trot delightedly, as she saw what had caused the sailor to fall.  Cap'n Bill rose to his foot, for he was not at all hurt, and examined the melon. Then he took his big jackknife from his pocket and cut the melon open. It was quite ripe and looked delicious; but the old man tasted it before he permitted Trot to eat any. Deciding it was good he gave her a big slice and then offered the Ork some. The creature looked at the fruit somewhat disdainfully, at first, but once he had tasted its flavor he ate of it as heartily as did the others. Among the vines they discovered many other melons, and Trot said gratefully: \"Well, there's no danger of our starving, even if this is an island.\"  \"Melons,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, \"are both food an' water. We couldn't have struck anything better.\"  Farther on they came to the cherry trees, where they obtained some of the fruit, and at the edge of the little forest were wild plums. The forest itself consisted entirely of nut trees--walnuts, filberts, almonds and chestnuts--so there would be plenty of wholesome food for them while they remained there.  Cap'n Bill and Trot decided to walk through the forest, to discover what was on the other side of it, but the Ork's feet were still so sore and \"lumpy\" from walking on the rocks that the creature said he preferred to fly over the tree-tops and meet them on the other side. The forest was not large, so by walking briskly for fifteen minutes they reached its farthest edge and saw before them the shore of the ocean.  \"It's an island, all right,\" said Trot, with a sigh.  \"Yes, and a pretty island, too,\" said Cap'n Bill, trying to conceal his disappointment on Trot's account. \"I guess, partner, if the wuss comes to the wuss, I could build a raft--or even a boat--from those trees, so's we could sail away in it.\"  The little girl brightened at this suggestion. \"I don't see the Ork anywhere,\" she remarked, looking around. Then her eyes"]]]
