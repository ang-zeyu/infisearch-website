Thus Austria-Hungary became inevitably Germany's partner and vanguard in the south-east. Finally, the present war was started by the Germans and Magyars with the object of achieving the ambitious plans preached and expounded by Pan-German writers for years past. The Germans wanted at all costs to become the masters of Central Europe, to build an empire from Berlin to Bagdad, and finally to strike for world domination.  2. In this turn of events Magyar influence played a greater part than might be thought. Already in 1848 Kossuth defined the Hungarian foreign policy as follows:--      \"The Magyar nation is bound to maintain the most cordial relations with     the free German nation and help it in safeguarding Western     civilisation.\"  And while the Hungarian Slavs were prohibited from attending the Pan-Slav Congress held in Prague in 1848, the Magyars sent two delegates to Frankfurt in order to give practical expression to the above Magyar policy.  The value of Hungary for the Pan-German plans has been expressed by Friedrich List who, in 1862, dreamt of \"a powerful oriental German-Magyar Empire,\" and declared:      \"The way towards the realisation of this plan runs through Hungary, and     while without Hungary we can do nothing, with her aid we can do     everything. Hungary is for Germany the clue to Turkey and the Near     East, and at the same time a bulwark against a superior power from the     north.\"  The Magyars realised from the beginning the importance of an understanding between themselves and Prussia, and they directed their foreign policy accordingly. The setting up of dualism in 1867, which finally established the German-Magyar hegemony in Austria-Hungary in the interests of Prussia, was the work of two Magyars--Julius Andrassy and Francis Deak, who took advantage of Austria's defeat at Sadova to further their interests. In 1870, when Vienna contemplated revenge against Prussia, the Magyars again intervened in favour of Prussia. When questioned as to Hungary's attitude, Andrassy, then Premier, declared in the Hungarian Parliament that under no circumstances would he allow any action against Prussia, and exerted all his influence in Vienna to that effect. It was also due mainly to Magyar influence that all attempts of the Czechs to weaken German influence in Austria were frustrated. Francis Joseph always promised to be crowned King of Bohemia when he wished to placate the Czechs in times of stress for Austria: in 1861, 1865, 1870 and 1871. But he never carried out his promises. In this he was guided not only by considerations of dynastic interest, but also by the advice of the Magyars.  But the most decisive and fateful exercise of Magyar influence upon Austria's foreign policy occurred in 1879, when the Austro-German Alliance was finally concluded. This was equally the work of Bismarck, who spared the defeated Austria in order to make an ally of her, and of a Magyar--Count Andrassy--who from 1871 to 1879 was the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister. It was this Magyar help which made Bismarck utter words of gratitude and declare in 1883:      \"Our political judgment leads us to the conviction that German and     Magyar interests are inseparable.\"  It is true that there always was a Magyar opposition against Austria (though never against Prussia). But this opposition was used as a weapon to extort concessions from Austria. At the bottom of their hearts, however, the Austrian Germans were always at one with the Magyars in their common desire to oppress the Slavs. And the responsibility of Count Tisza for the present world catastrophe is just as great as that of the Kaiser himself.  3. The Czechs saw clearly the progress of events. Bismarck was well aware of the importance of Bohemia, for he declared that the master of Bohemia would become the master of Europe. He did not desire to annex any Austrian territory, since he knew that sooner or later Germany would swallow the whole of Austria, as she has done in this war. Indeed, at the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Bismarck did not conceal his intention of using Austria-Hungary in Germany's interests. At the bottom of his heart he was at one with the radical Pan-German writers, like Lagarde, Treitschke, Mommsen, Naumann and others, who openly declared that the Slavs should be subjugated and the Czechs, as the most courageous and therefore the most dangerous of them, crushed.  The Slavs always bitterly opposed the encroachments of Germanism, and saw in it their chief enemy. The Czech leader Palacký rejected the invitation to Frankfurt in 1848 and summoned a Slav Congress to Prague. It is true that Palacký at that time dreamt of an Austria just to all her nations. He advocated a strong Austria as a federation of nations to counterbalance Pan-Germanism. Yet at the same time Palacký has proved through his history and work that Bohemia has full right to independence. He was well aware that a federalistic and just Austria would have to grant independence to the Czecho-Slovaks. But later on he gave up his illusions about the possibility of a just Austria, when he saw that she abandoned the Slavs entirely to German-Magyar hegemony, and declared that Bohemia existed before Austria and would also exist after her. In 1866 he wrote:      \"I myself now give up all hope of a long preservation of the Austrian     Empire; not because it is not desirable or has no mission to fulfil,     but because it allowed the Germans and Magyars to grasp the reins of     government and to found in it their racial tyranny.\"  Exasperated by the pact of dualism which the Czechs never recognised, Palacký went to Moscow and on his return declared:      \"I have already said that I do not cherish any hopes of the     preservation of Austria, especially since the Germans and Magyars made     it the home of their racial despotism; the question therefore as to     what will happen to the Slavs hitherto living in Austria is not without     significance. Without attempting to prophesy future events which for a     mortal man it is difficult to foreshadow, I may say from my inner     conviction that the Czechs as a nation, if they fell under the     subjection of either Russia or Prussia, would never rest contented. It     would never fade from their memory that according to right or justice     they should be ruled by themselves, that is by their own government and     by their own sovereign. They would regard the Prussians as their deadly     enemies on account of their germanising rage. But as to the Russians,     the Czechs would regard them as their racial brothers and friends; they     would not become their faithful subjects, but their true allies and, if     need be, vanguards in Europe.\"  Moreover, modern Czech politicians always clearly saw what the Germans were aiming at. Dr. Kramár, for instance, foresaw the present situation with remarkable perspicacity. In the _Revue de Paris_ for February, 1899, he wrote on \"The Future of Austria,\" declaring that her subject nationalities should be on guard lest she should become a vassal of Germany and a bridge for German expansion into Asia:      \"The Austrian Germans wish to see Austria subordinated to German     policy, and with the help of a subordinated Austria, the sphere of     German political and economic activity would extend from Hamburg to     Asia Minor.\"  Similarly also he warned Great Britain in the _National Review_ for October, 1902, that if Pan-German plans were realised,      \"Austria would become an appanage of Germany as regards international     relations, and the policy of Europe would be obliged to reckon, not     with a free and independent Austria, but, owing to Austria's     unconditional self-surrender, with a mighty, almost invincible     Germany.... The Pan-Germans are right, the Czechs are an arrow in the     side of Germany, and such they wish to and must and will remain. Their     firm and unchangeable hope is that they will succeed in making of     themselves an impenetrable breakwater. They hope for no foreign help;     they neither wish for it nor ask for it. They have only one desire,     namely, that non-German Europe may also at last show that it     understands the meaning of the Bohemian question.\"  In 1906 Dr. Kramár wrote again in detail on the plans of German domination in Central Europe, in the Adriatic and in the Near East. In a book on Czech policy he declared that to prevent the realisation of these plans was the vital interest of the Czech nation: \"A far-seeing Austrian policy should see in the Czech nation the safeguard of the independence of the State.\" And then followed the famous passage which formed part of the \"evidence\" quoted against him during his trial for high treason:      \"If Austria-Hungary continues her internal policy by centralising in     order to be better able to germanise and preserve the German character     of the State, if she does not resist all efforts for the creation of a     customs and economic union with Germany, the Pan-German movement will     prove fatal for her. To preserve and maintain a state the sole ambition     of which was to be a second German State after Germany, would be     superfluous not only for the European Powers, but also for the     non-German nations of Europe. _And if, therefore, a conflict should     break out between the German and the non-German world and the definite     fate of Austria should be at stake, the conflict would surely not end     with the preservation of Austria_.\"  And on November 10, 1911, he admitted that his former hopes for the destruction of the Austro-German Alliance and a rapprochement between Austria and Russia proved to be in vain:      \"... _I had an aim in life and a leading idea. The events of the     annexation crisis have proved calamitous for the policy which I     followed all my life_. I wished to do everything"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9650"],["title","Independent Bohemia (#4)"],["body","lay within the     compass of my small powers, to render my own nation happy and great in     a free, powerful and generally respected Austria ... _I have always     resented the fact that when they talked about Austria people really     meant only the Germans and Magyars, as if the great majority of Slavs     upon whom rest the biggest burdens did not exist_. But now--and no     beautiful words can make me change my opinion on that point--an     entirely independent policy has become unthinkable, because the only     path which remains open to Vienna leads by way of Berlin. Berlin will     henceforward direct our policy.\"  4. To offer any proofs that the present war was deliberately planned and provoked by the Governments of Berlin, Vienna and Budapest seems to me superfluous. Who can to-day have any doubt that Austria wilfully provoked the war in a mad desire to crush Serbia? Who can doubt that Austria for a long time entertained imperialist ambitions with respect to the Balkans which were supported by Berlin which wished to use Austria as a \"bridge to the East\"?  No more damning document for Austria can be imagined than Prince Lichnowsky's Memorandum. He denounces Austria's hypocritical support of the independence of Albania. In this respect he holds similar views to those expressed in the Austrian delegations of 1913 by Professor Masaryk, who rightly denounced the Austrian plan of setting up an independent Albania on the plea of \"the right of nationalities\" which Austria denied her own Slavs. Professor Masaryk rightly pointed out at that time that an outlet to the sea is a vital necessity for Serbia, that the Albanians were divided into so many racial, linguistic and religious groups and so uncivilised that they could not form an independent nation, and that the whole project was part and parcel of Austria's anti-Serbian policy and her plans for the conquest of the Balkans. Prince Lichnowsky admits that an independent Albania \"had no prospect of surviving,\" and that it was merely an Austrian plan for preventing Serbia from obtaining an access to the sea.  He apparently disagrees with the idea of \"the power of a Ruling House, the dynastic idea,\" but stands up for \"a National State, the democratic idea.\" That in itself seems to indicate that he is in favour of the destruction of Austria and its substitution by new states, built according to the principle of nationality. He admittedly disagrees with the views of Vienna and Budapest, and criticises Germany's alliance with Austria, probably knowing, as a far-sighted and well-informed politician, that Austria-Hungary cannot possibly survive this war.  Prince Lichnowsky frankly admits that the murder of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand was a mere pretext for Vienna, which in fact had resolved on an expedition against Serbia soon after the second Balkan war by which she felt herself humiliated. In scathing terms he denounces the Triple Alliance policy and thinks it a great mistake that Germany allied herself with the \"Turkish and Magyar oppressors.\" And though he says that it was Germany which \"persisted that Serbia must be massacred,\" he makes it quite clear that it was Vienna that led the conspiracy against Europe, since on all questions Germany \"took up the position prescribed to her by Vienna.\" The policy of espousing Austria's quarrels, the development of the Austro-German Alliance into a pooling of interests in all spheres, was \"the best way of producing war.\" The Balkan policy of conquest and strangulation \"was not the German policy, but that of the Austrian Imperial House.\" What better testimony is required to prove that Austria was not the blind tool, but the willing and wilful accomplice of Germany?    III  CZECH POLITICAL PARTIES BEFORE AND DURING THE WAR  The Czech policy during the past seventy years has always had but one ultimate aim in view: the re-establishment of the ancient kingdom of Bohemia and the full independence of the Czecho-Slovak nation. From the very beginning of their political activity Czech politicians resisted the Pan-German scheme of Central Europe. They preached the necessity of the realisation of liberty and equality for all nations, and of a federation of the non-Germans of Central Europe as a barrier against German expansion.  The chief reason for the failure of their efforts was the fact that they sometimes had illusions that the Habsburgs might favour the plan of such an anti-German federation, although the Habsburgs always mainly relied on the Germans and Magyars and could not and would not satisfy the Czech aspirations. The Czechs were greatly handicapped in their political struggle, because they had only just begun to live as a nation and had to face the powerful German-Magyar predominance, with the dynasty and the whole state machinery behind them. Moreover, the Czechs had no national aristocracy like the Poles or Magyars, and their leaders lacked all political experience and all sense of reality in politics which was so marked in a state built on deceit and hypocrisy. They continually defended themselves with declarations about the justice of their claims, satisfied themselves with empty promises which Austria has never kept, and cherished vain illusions of obtaining justice in Austria, while Austria was _via facti_ steadily depriving them of all their rights. On the other hand, it should be remembered that they were faced with a government that had the whole powerful German Empire behind it, and that they had to struggle for freedom in a state where genuine constitutional government and democracy were unknown. The Czech efforts to obtain some measure of freedom by struggling for democratic reforms were consistently opposed by the dominant Germans. To-day, of course, the situation has greatly improved as compared with the situation seventy years ago. The Czecho-Slovak nation, through its own work and energy, is a highly advanced and economically self-supporting and rich nation, and in its struggle for a just resettlement of Central Europe it has the support not only of all the other non-German nations of Central Europe, but also of the Entente on whose victory it has staked its all. The Czecho-Slovaks are resolved not to let themselves be fooled by Austria any longer and claim full independence from Berlin, Vienna and Budapest, which alone will safeguard them against the possibility of being again exploited militarily, economically and politically against their own interests for a cause which they detest.  1. Although as early as 1812 the Bohemian Diet (then a close aristocratic body) demanded the restitution of the rights of the kingdom of Bohemia, the political activity of the Czechs did not really begin until 1848 when, on April 8, the emperor issued the famous Bohemian Charter recognising the rights of Bohemia to independence. It was that year which marked the end of Metternich's absolutism and in which revolution broke out in Western and Central Europe, including Hungary and Bohemia. Already at that time the Czechs counted on the break-up of Austria. Havlícek, who in 1846 began to publish the first national Czech newspaper, wrote on May 7, 1848, when inviting the Poles to attend the Pan-Slav Congress in Prague:      \"An understanding between us--the Czecho-Slovaks and the Poles--would     be to the mutual advantage of both nations, especially under the     present circumstances when everything, even the break-up of Austria,     may be anticipated. I am sure that if the government continues to     pursue its present policy, Austria will fall to pieces before next     winter and the Czechs are not going to save her. The Czecho-Slovaks,     Poles and Yugoslavs, united politically and supporting each other, will     surely sooner or later attain their object, which is to obtain full     independence, national unity and political liberty.\"  It is characteristic of Austria that during the present war she has prohibited the circulation of this article written seventy years ago.  Similarly, also, Palacký in his letter to Frankfurt, explaining why the Czechs would not attend the Pan-German Parliament, made it clear that he had no illusions about the good-will of Austria to adopt a just policy towards her nationalities:      \"In critical times we always saw this state, destined to be the bulwark     against Asiatic invasions, helpless and hesitating. In an unfortunate     blindness this state has never understood its true interests, always     suppressing its moral duty to accord to all races justice and equality     of rights.\"  At the Pan-Slav Congress presided over by Palacký, Bakunin, the Russian revolutionary, openly advocated the dismemberment of Austria in the interests of justice and democracy, and proposed a free Slav federation in Central Europe.  The Pan-Slav Congress, in which also the Poles and Yugoslavs participated, issued a manifesto to Europe on June 12, 1848, proclaiming the \"liberty, equality and fraternity of nations.\" It ended prematurely by the outbreak of an abortive revolt in Prague, provoked by the military, which resulted in bloodshed and in the re-establishment of reaction and absolutism.  2. In the first Austrian Parliament of 1848, eighty-eight Czech deputies formed a united _Nationalist Party_ (later on called the _Old Czech Party_), led by Palacký, Rieger and Brauner. They formed the Right wing which stood for democratic and federalist ideals. The Left was formed by the Germans who stood for centralism and a close union with Germany. Only an insignificant number of Germans formed the Centre which stood for the preservation of Austria.  In October, 1848, fresh troubles broke out in Vienna, partly directed against the presence of the Czechs. On November 15, the parliament was summoned to Kremsier, in which the Czechs, Ruthenes, Yugoslavs and some Poles formed a Slav _bloc_ of 120 members. On December 2, Francis Joseph ascended the throne, and a constitution was proposed by a parliamentary"]]]
