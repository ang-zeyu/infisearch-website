You will be a noble and happy hunter.  [Illustration: “BUT FIT WITH THEIR TONGUES, FEARFUL.”]  At the same time, if you hunt all day for faults you will come in at night with sights of pelts. You will find what you hunt for, track 'em right along and chase 'em down.  Wall, Lodema never got led away from her perticuler chase. She just hunted faults from mornin' till night, and done well at it. She brought in sights of skins.  But oh! wuzn't it disagreeable in the extreme to Samantha, who had always tried to bend her bow and bring down Beauty, to have her familiar huntin' grounds turned into so different a warpath. It wuz disagreeable! It wuz! It wuz!  And then, havin' to stand between her and Josiah too, wuz fearful wearin' on me. I had always stood there in the past, and now in this visit it wuz jest the same; all the hull time, till about the middle of the fifth week, I had to stand between their two tongues--they didn't fight with their hands, but fit with their tongues, fearful.     CHAPTER VII.   But along about the middle of the fifth week I see a change. Lodema had been uncommon exasperatin', and I expected she would set Josiah to goin', and I groaned in spirit, to think what a job wuz ahead of me, to part their two tongues--when all of a sudden I see a curius change come over my pardner's face.  I remember jest the date that the change in his mean wuz visible, and made known to me--for it wuz the very mornin' that we got the invitation to old Mr. and Miss Pressley's silver weddin'. And that wuz the fifteenth day of the month along about the middle of the forenoon.  And it wuz not half an hour after Elnathen Pressley came to the door and give us the invitations, that I see the change in his mean.  And when I asked him about it afterwards, what that strange and curius look meant, he never hung back a mite from tellin' me, but sez right out plain:  “Mebby, Samantha, I hain't done exactly as I ort to by cousin Lodema, and I have made up my mind to make her a happy surprise before she goes away.”  “Wall,” sez I, “so do.”  I thought he wuz goin' to get her a new dress. She had been a-hintin' to him dretful strong to that effect. She wanted a parmetty, or a balzereen, or a circassien, which wuz in voge in her young days. But I wuz in hopes he would get her a cashmere, and told him so, plain.  But I couldn't get him to tell what the surprise wuz. He only sez, sez he:  “I am goin' to make her a happy surprise.”  And the thought that he wuz a-goin' to branch out and make a change, wuz considerable of a comfort to me. And I needed comfort--yes, indeed I did--I needed it bad. For not one single thing did I do for her that I done right, though I tried my best to do well by her.  But she found fault with my vittles from mornin' till night, though I am called a excellent cook all over Jonesville, and all round the adjoining country, out as far as Loontown, and Zoar. It has come straight back to me by them that wouldn't lie. But it hain't made me vain.  But I never cooked a thing that suited Lodema, not a single thing. Most of my vittles wuz too fresh, and then if I braced up and salted 'em extra so as to be sure to please her, why then they wuz briny, and hurt her mouth.  Why, if you'll believe it, I give her a shawl, made her a present of it; it had even checks black and white, jest as many threads in the black stripes as there wuz in the white, for I counted 'em.  And she told me, after she had looked it all over and said it wuz kinder thin and slazy, and checkered shawls had gone out of fashion, and the black looked some as if it would fade with washin', and the white wuzn't over clear, and the colors wuzn't no ways becomin' to her complexion, and etcetery, etcetery.  “But,” sez she, after she had got all through with the rest of her complaints--“if the white stripes wuz where the black wuz, and the black where the white wuz, she should like it quite well.” And there it wuz, even check, two and two. Wall, that wuz a sample of her doin's. If anybody had a Roman nose she wanted a Greecy one.  [Illustration: “IF THE WHITE STRIPES WUZ WHERE THE BLACK WUZ.”]  And if the nose wuz Greece, why then she wanted Rome.  Why, Josiah sez to me along about the third week, he said (to ourselves, in private), “that if Lodema went to Heaven she would be dissatisfied with it, and think it wuz livelier, and more goin' on down to the other place.” And he said she would get the angels all stirred up a findin' fault with their feathers.  I told him “I would not hear such talk.”  “Wall,” sez he, “don't you believe it?”  And I kinder turned him off, and wouldn't tell, and told him it wuz wicked to talk so.  “Wall,” sez Josiah, “you dassent say she wouldn't.”  And I dassent, though I wouldn't own it up to him, I dassent.  And if she kinder got out of other occupations for a minute durin' them first weeks she would be a quarrelin' with Josiah Allen about age.  I s'pose she and Josiah wuzn't far from the same age, for they wuz children together. But she wanted to make out she wuz young.  And she would tell Josiah that “he seemed jest like a father to her, and always had.” And sometimes when she felt the most curius, she would call him “Father,” and “Pa,” and “Papa.” And it would mad Josiah Allen so that I would have all I could do to quell him down.  Now I didn't feel so, I didn't mind it so much. Why, there would be days, when she felt the curiusest, that she would call me “Mother,” and “Ma,” and foller me round with foot-stools and things, when I went to set down, and would kinder worry over my fallin' off the back step, and would offer to help me up the suller stairs, and so forth, and watchin' over what I et, and tellin' me folks of my age ort to be careful, and not over-eat.  And Josiah asked me to ask her “How she felt about that time?” For she wuz from three to four years older than I wuz.  But I wouldn't contend with her, and the footstools come kinder handy, I had jest as lieve have 'em under my feet as not, and ruther. And as for rich vittles not agreein' with me, and my not over-eatin', I broke that tip by fallin' right in with her, and not cookin' such good things--that quelled her down, and gaulded Josiah too.  But, as I said, it riled Josiah the worst of anything to have Lodema call him father, for he wants to make out that he is kinder young himself.  And sez he to her one day, about the third week, when she was a-goin' on about how good and fatherly he looked, and how much he seemed like a parent to her, and always had, sez he: “I wonder if I seemed like a father to you when we wuz a-kickin' at each other in the same cradle?”  Sez he: “We both used to nuss out of the same bottle, any way, for I have heard my mother say so lots of times. There wuzn't ten days' difference in our ages. You wuz ten days the oldest as I have always made out.”  She screamed right out, “Why, Josiah Allen, where is your conscience to talk in that way--and your heart?”  “In here, where everybody's is,” sez Josiah, strikin' himself with his right hand--he meant to strike against his left breast, but struck too low, kinder on his stomach.  And sez I, “That is what I have always thought, Josiah Allen. I have always had better luck reachin' your conscience through your stomach than in any other way. And now,” sez I coldly, “do you go out and bring in a pail of water.”  I used to get beat out and sick of their scufflin's and disagreein's, and broke 'em up whenever I could.  But oh! oh! how she did quarrel with Josiah Allen and that buzz saw scheme of his'n. How light she made of that enterprise, how she demeaned the buzz, and run the saws--till I felt that bad as I hated the enterprise myself, I felt that a variety of loud buzz saws would be a welcome relief from her tongue--from their two tongues; for as fur down as she would run them buzz saws, jest so fur would Josiah Allen praise 'em up.  [Illustration: LODEMA AND JOSIAH IN YOUTH.]  She never agreed with Josiah Allen but in jest one thing while she was under his ruff. I happened to mention one day how extremely anxious I wuz to have females set on the Conference; and then, wantin' to dispute me, and also bein' set on that side, she run down the project, and called it all to nort--and when too late she see that she had got over on Josiah Allen's side of the fence.  But it had one good effect. When that man see she wuz there, he waded off, way out of sight of the project, and wouldn't mention it--it madded him so to be on the same side of the fence she wuz--so that it seemed to happen all for the best.  Why, I took her as a dispensation from the first, and drawed all sorts of morels from her, and sights of 'em--sights.  But oh, it wuz tuff on me, fearful tuff.  And when she calculated and laid out to make out her visit and go, wuz more than we could tell.     CHAPTER VIII.   For two weeks had passed away like a nite mair of the nite--and three weeks, and four weeks--and she didn't seem to be no nigher goin' than she did when she came.  And I would not make a move towards gettin' rid of her, not if I had dropped down in my tracts, because she wuz one of the relatives on his side.  But I wuz completely fagged out; it did seem, as I told Tirzah Ann one day in confidence, “that I never knew the meanin' of the word 'fag' before.”  And Tirzah Ann told me (she couldn't bear her) that if she wuz in my place, she would start her off. Sez she:  “She has plenty of brothers and sisters, and a home of her own, and why should she come here to torment you and father;” and sez she, “I'll talk to her, mother, I'd jest as leve as not.” Sez I, “Tirzah Ann, if you say a word to her, I'll--I'll never put confidence in you agin;” sez I, “Life is full of tribulations, and we must expect to bear our crosses;”  sez I, “The old martyrs went through"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9456"],["title","Opera Stories from Wagner (#0)"],["body","STORIES FROM WAGNER  BY  FLORENCE AKIN  WITH ILLUSTRATIONS  1915         [Illustration: SIEGFRIED]  NOTE:  The verses printed in this book are quoted from Dr. Oliver        Huckel's translations of _The Rhine-Gold_, _The Walkuere_,        _Siegfried_, and _Goetterdaemmerung_, by the kind permission        of the publishers, Messrs.

Pollak-Ottendorff_      TO THE GIRLS AND BOYS   In these stories you will find some wonderful giants.  You will find beautiful maidens who lived in a river.  You will find a large family of little black dwarfs who lived under the river, and you will find a splendid hero.  The little children of Germany used to curl up in their mothers' arms, when bedtime came, and listen to the stories of these strange people.  When these little children grew up, they told the same stories to their children.  So it went for many, many years.  The stories have been put together by a man named Richard Wagner. He put them together in such a way that they make one long and wonderful story.  After he had told these stories in words, he told them again in a more beautiful way. He told them in music.  Sometime you will hear this music, and you will think of beautiful water-maidens, singing and dancing in the sunshine.  You will think of great giants walking over mountains.  You will think of the little black dwarfs under the river, and you will hear them hammering, hammering upon their anvils.      OPERA STORIES FROM WAGNER        THE RHINE-GOLD   THE HAPPY RHINE-DAUGHTERS  In the Rhine River there lived three beautiful maidens. They were called the Rhine-daughters.  They had long, golden hair, which floated upon the waves as they swam from rock to rock.  When their father went away, he left in their care a great lump of pure gold.  This gold was on the very top of the highest rock in the river.  Every morning the beautiful Rhine-daughters would dance and sing about their gold.  They sang a happy song:--    \"Heigh-ho! hither, ye waters!   Waver and waft me to sleep on your breast!   Heigh-ho! hither, ye waters!   Weave me sweet dreams on your billowy crest!\"    ALBERICH   One morning, when the sun was shining very brightly, the Rhine-daughters were startled by a strange sound in the depths of the water.  \"Look!\" whispered one. \"What is that scowling at us from the rocks below?\"  There, stealing along the river-bed, they saw a hideous little black dwarf.  \"Who are you, and what do you want?\" asked the Rhine-daughters.  \"I am Alberich,\" answered the dwarf as he tried to climb up on the slippery rocks. \"I came from the kingdom of the Nibelungs, down under the earth.\"  \"What!\" said the Rhine-daughters. \"Surely you do not live down in the dark earth where there is no sunshine?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Alberich. \"But I have come up to frolic in the sunshine with you\"; and he held out his ugly, misshapen little hands to take the hands of the Rhine-daughters.  They only laughed at him and darted away to a higher rock.  Alberich hurried after them.  He blinked and scowled in the sunshine, because his eyes were not used to the light.  The maidens laughed and shouted in their play.  They called to Alberich and teased him.  They went very close to him, pretending that they would take his hand, that he, too, might play in the sunshine. Then they would quickly dart away, mocking him, and laughing at him more loudly than ever.  Alberich grew fierce and angry.  He clenched his fists and cried:--  \"Woe be to you if I should catch you now.\"   THE CARELESS RHINE-DAUGHTERS  Alberich was the most hideous of all the black, ugly little Nibelungs.  The Nibelungs had cross, scowling faces, because they were always scolding each other.  They quarreled from morning till night, so, of course, their faces grew to look quarrelsome and ugly.  As Alberich hurried after the Rhine-daughters, he suddenly caught sight of the gold glittering in the morning sun.  He stood still. Then he straightened up as tall as his crooked, misshapen little back would let him. He opened his eyes wide.  \"Oh! Sisters! See how Alberich is staring at our gold!\" whispered one of the Rhine-daughters. \"Perhaps this is the foe of which our father warned us. How careless we have been!\"  \"Nonsense,\" answered one. \"Who would fear this little black fellow? He will do us no harm. Let him gaze upon the gold. Come, let us sing!\"  [Illustration: THE RHINE-MAIDENS AND ALBERICH]  The maidens joined hands and circled about the gold, singing:--    \"Hail to thee! Hail to thee!   Treasure most bright!   Rhine-gold! Rhine-gold!   Beautiful sight!    \"Hail to thee! Hail to thee!   Out of the night!   Rhine-gold! Rhine-gold!   Wakened so bright!\"   THE THEFT  Still Alberich stood and stared at the gold.  \"What is it?\" he gasped. \"What is it?\"  The Rhine-daughters shouted back to him:--    \"Heigh-ho! and heigh-ho!   Dear little imp of woe,   Laugh with us, laugh with us!   Heigh-ho and heigh-ho!\"  But Alberich did not laugh with them.  He would not take his eyes off the gold.  \"That,\" said the maidens, \"is our Rhine-gold.\"  \"A very pretty plaything it is,\" said Alberich.  \"Yes,\" replied the careless sisters, \"it is magic gold. Who moulds this gold into a ring shall have all power upon the earth, save love.\"  Alberich muttered to himself: \"What do I care for love if I have all the gold I want?\"  Then he sprang upon the slippery rock and snatched the gold. With one wild leap he plunged into the depths below.  Down, down he went to his deep, dark kingdom, clutching fast the precious gold and muttering:--  \"Now all the earth is mine. It is mine, all mine. Now I shall rule the world.\"  Poor foolish Alberich! He did not know that the best things in this world are the things which gold cannot buy.  The power of love is greater than the power of gold.  The maidens shrieked and screamed: \"Our gold! Our gold! Our precious gold!\"  Too late! Far, far below, they heard a laugh, the rough, rude laugh of Alberich, the dwarf.   THE SAD RHINE-DAUGHTERS  After that, when the Rhine-daughters came to the rock where the gold had been, they could not sing their happy song.  Their faces were very sad now, and they said: \"Oh, why did Alberich steal our beautiful gold? It cannot make him happy, for no one can ever be truly happy who does not know love.\"  They often sat upon the rocks in the dusk of the evening and cried as if their hearts would break because they had lost their gold.  \"The black waves surge in sorrow through the depths, And all the Rhine is wailing in its woe.\"   A CASTLE ON THE RHINE  On a mountain-side, above the banks of the Rhine, lived a family of splendid giants.  The greatest of the giants was Wotan. He was the king.  They had always lived out of doors, because the king had never been able to find a giant who was large enough to build such a grand castle as he wanted for his family.  But one day there came to the mountainside the largest giant Wotan had ever seen.  His name was Fafner.  He was many times larger than Wotan.  Wotan told Fafner how much he wanted a wonderful castle.  Fafner said: \"I will build such a castle for you if you will give me your sister, Freya.\"  Fafner wanted to take the beautiful Freya to his own country.  Wotan did not stop to think what an awful thing it would be to lose Freya.  His thoughts were of nothing but the wonderful castle.  \"Build it, Fafner,\" said Wotan.  That night Wotan and his family lay down upon their mountain to sleep.  Wotan dreamed of a wonderful stone castle with glittering towers.  He dreamed he saw the castle gleaming in the morning sun.  [Illustration: WOTAN]   THE MORNING  It was morning in the beautiful country where the Rhine River flows.  The giants upon the hillside were just awakening from their night's sleep.  During the night Fafner had built the wonderful castle.  Wotan's wife was the first to see it.  \"Awake, Wotan! Awake!\" she cried.  As Wotan opened his eyes he saw the castle upon the summit of the mountain.  What a great shining castle it was!  In delight Wotan cried: \"'T is finished! And my glorious dream is true!\"  All night long Fafner had toiled hard.  He finished just as the morning dawned.  He was waiting now for Wotan to awaken and to give to him the beautiful Freya.  He would take her and hurry to his own country.   THE PAYMENT  \"While you slept I built the castle,\" said Fafner. \"Now I am ready for the"]]]
