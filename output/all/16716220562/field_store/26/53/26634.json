Thy children all, though hue and form      Are varied in Thine own good will,      With Thy own holy breathings warm,      And fashioned in Thine image still.       We thank Thee, Father! hill and plain      Around us wave their fruits once more,      And clustered vine, and blossomed grain,      Are bending round each cottage door.       And peace is here; and hope and love      Are round us as a mantle thrown,      And unto Thee, supreme above,      The knee of prayer is bowed alone.       But oh, for those this day can bring,      As unto us, no joyful thrill;      For those who, under Freedom's wing,      Are bound in Slavery's fetters still:       For those to whom Thy written word      Of light and love is never given;      For those whose ears have never heard      The promise and the hope of heaven!       For broken heart, and clouded mind,      Whereon no human mercies fall;      Oh, be Thy gracious love inclined,      Who, as a Father, pitiest all!       And grant, O Father! that the time      Of Earth's deliverance may be near,      When every land and tongue and clime      The message of Thy love shall hear;       When, smitten as with fire from heaven,      The captive's chain shall sink in dust,      And to his fettered soul be given      The glorious freedom of the just,     THE YANKEE GIRL.       SHE sings by her wheel at that low cottage-door,      Which the long evening shadow is stretching before,      With a music as sweet as the music which seems      Breathed softly and faint in the ear of our dreams!       How brilliant and mirthful the light of her eye,      Like a star glancing out from the blue of the sky!      And lightly and freely her dark tresses play      O'er a brow and a bosom as lovely as they!       Who comes in his pride to that low cottage-door,      The haughty and rich to the humble and poor?      'T is the great Southern planter, the master who waves      His whip of dominion o'er hundreds of slaves.       \"Nay, Ellen, for shame! Let those Yankee fools spin,      Who would pass for our slaves with a change of their skin;      Let them toil as they will at the loom or the wheel,      Too stupid for shame, and too vulgar to feel!       \"But thou art too lovely and precious a gem      To be bound to their burdens and sullied by them;      For shame, Ellen, shame, cast thy bondage aside,      And away to the South, as my blessing and pride.       \"Oh, come where no winter thy footsteps can wrong,      But where flowers are blossoming all the year long,      Where the shade of the palm-tree is over my home,      And the lemon and orange are white in their bloom!       \"Oh, come to my home, where my servants shall all      Depart at thy bidding and come at thy call;      They shall heed thee as mistress with trembling and awe,      And each wish of thy heart shall be felt as a law.\"       \"Oh, could ye have seen her--that pride of our girls--      Arise and cast back the dark wealth of her curls,      With a scorn in her eye which the gazer could feel,      And a glance like the sunshine that flashes on steel!       \"Go back, haughty Southron! thy treasures of gold      Are dim with the blood of the hearts thou halt sold;      Thy home may be lovely, but round it I hear      The crack of the whip and the footsteps of fear!       \"And the sky of thy South may be brighter than ours,      And greener thy landscapes, and fairer thy' flowers;      But dearer the blast round our mountains which raves,      Than the sweet summer zephyr which breathes over slaves!       \"Full low at thy bidding thy negroes may kneel,      With the iron of bondage on spirit and heel;      Yet know that the Yankee girl sooner would be      In fetters with them, than in freedom with thee!\"       1835.     THE HUNTERS OF MEN.  These lines were written when the orators of the American Colonization Society were demanding that the free blacks should be sent to Africa, and opposing Emancipation unless expatriation followed. See the report of the proceedings of the society at its annual meeting in 1834.         HAVE ye heard of our hunting, o'er mountain and glen,       Through cane-brake and forest,--the hunting of men?       The lords of our land to this hunting have gone,       As the fox-hunter follows the sound of the horn;       Hark! the cheer and the hallo! the crack of the whip,       And the yell of the hound as he fastens his grip!       All blithe are our hunters, and noble their match,       Though hundreds are caught, there are millions to catch.       So speed to their hunting, o'er mountain and glen,       Through cane-brake and forest,--the hunting of men!        Gay luck to our hunters! how nobly they ride       In the glow of their zeal, and the strength of their pride!       The priest with his cassock flung back on the wind,       Just screening the politic statesman behind;       The saint and the sinner, with cursing and prayer,       The drunk and the sober, ride merrily there.       And woman, kind woman, wife, widow, and maid,       For the good of the hunted, is lending her aid       Her foot's in the stirrup, her hand on the rein,       How blithely she rides to the hunting of men!        Oh, goodly and grand is our hunting to see,       In this \"land of the brave and this home of the free.\"       Priest, warrior, and statesman, from Georgia to Maine,       All mounting the saddle, all grasping the rein;       Right merrily hunting the black man, whose sin       Is the curl of his hair and the hue of his skin!       Woe, now, to the hunted who turns him at bay       Will our hunters be turned from their purpose and prey?       Will their hearts fail within them? their nerves tremble, when       All roughly they ride to the hunting of men?        Ho! alms for our hunters! all weary and faint,       Wax the curse of the sinner and prayer of the saint.       The horn is wound faintly, the echoes are still,       Over cane-brake and river, and forest and hill.       Haste, alms for our hunters! the hunted once more       Have turned from their flight with their backs to the shore       What right have they here in the home of the white,       Shadowed o'er by our banner of Freedom and Right?       Ho! alms for the hunters! or never again       Will they ride in their pomp to the hunting of men!        Alms, alms for our hunters! why will ye delay,       When their pride and their glory are melting away?       The parson has turned; for, on charge of his own,       Who goeth a warfare, or hunting, alone?       The politic statesman looks back with a sigh,       There is doubt in his heart, there is fear in his eye.       Oh, haste, lest that doubting and fear shall prevail,       And the head of his steed take the place of the tail.       Oh, haste, ere he leave us! for who will ride then,       For pleasure or gain, to the hunting of men?        1835.     STANZAS FOR THE TIMES.  The \"Times\" referred to were those evil times of the pro-slavery meeting in Faneuil Hall, August 21, 1835, in which a demand was made for the suppression of free speech, lest it should endanger the foundation of commercial society.       Is this the land our fathers loved,      The freedom which they toiled to win?      Is this the soil whereon they moved?      Are these the graves they slumber in?      Are we the sons by whom are borne      The mantles which the dead have worn?       And shall we crouch above these graves,      With craven soul and fettered lip?      Yoke in with marked and branded slaves,      And tremble at the driver's whip?      Bend to the earth our pliant knees,      And speak but as our masters please.       Shall outraged Nature cease to feel?      Shall Mercy's tears no longer flow?      Shall ruffian threats of cord and steel,      The dungeon's gloom, the assassin's blow,      Turn back the spirit roused to save      The Truth, our Country, and the Slave?       Of human skulls that shrine was made,      Round which the priests of Mexico      Before their loathsome idol prayed;      Is Freedom's altar fashioned so?      And must we yield to Freedom's God,      As offering meet, the negro's blood?       Shall tongues be mute, when deeds are wrought      Which well might shame extremest hell?      Shall freemen lock the indignant thought?      Shall Pity's bosom cease to swell?      Shall Honor bleed?--shall Truth succumb?      Shall pen, and press, and soul be dumb?       No; by each spot of haunted ground,      Where Freedom weeps her children's fall;      By Plymouth's rock, and Bunker's mound;      By Griswold's stained and shattered wall;      By Warren's ghost, by Langdon's shade;      By all the memories of our dead.       By their enlarging souls, which burst      The bands and fetters round them set;      By the free Pilgrim spirit nursed      Within our inmost bosoms, yet,      By all above, around, below,      Be ours the indignant answer,--No!       No; guided by our country's laws,      For truth, and right, and suffering man,      Be ours to strive in Freedom's cause,      As Christians may, as freemen can!      Still pouring on unwilling ears      That truth oppression only fears.       What! shall we guard our neighbor still,      While woman shrieks beneath his rod,      And while he tramples down at will      The image of a common God?      Shall watch and ward be round him set,      Of Northern nerve and bayonet?       And shall we know and share with him      The danger and the growing shame?      And see our Freedom's light grow dim,      Which should have filled the world with flame?      And, writhing, feel, where'er we turn,      A world's reproach around us burn?       Is 't not enough that this is borne?      And asks our haughty neighbor more?

Must he be told, beside his plough,      What he must speak, and when, and how?       Must he be told his freedom stands      On Slavery's dark foundations strong;      On breaking hearts and fettered hands,      On robbery, and crime, and wrong?      That all his fathers taught is vain,--      That Freedom's emblem is the chain?       Its life, its soul, from slavery drawn!      False, foul, profane!

In the report of the celebrated pro-slavery meeting in Charleston, S.C., on the 4th of the ninth month, 1835, published in the Courier of that city, it is stated: \"The clergy of all denominations attended in a body, lending their sanction to the proceedings, and adding by their presence to the impressive character of the scene!\"        JUST God! and these are they      Who minister at thine altar, God of Right!      Men who their hands with prayer and blessing lay      On Israel's Ark of light!       What! preach, and kidnap men?      Give thanks, and rob thy own afflicted poor?      Talk of thy glorious liberty, and then      Bolt hard the captive's door?       What! servants of thy own      Merciful Son, who came to seek and save      The homeless and the outcast, fettering down      The tasked and plundered slave!       Pilate and Herod, friends!      Chief priests and rulers, as of old, combine!      Just God and holy! is that church, which lends      Strength to the spoiler, thine?       Paid hypocrites, who turn      Judgment aside, and rob the Holy Book      Of those high words of truth which search and burn      In warning and rebuke;       Feed fat, ye locusts, feed!      And, in your tasselled pulpits, thank the Lord      That, from the toiling bondman's utter need,      Ye pile your own full board.       How long, O Lord! how long      Shall such a priesthood barter truth away,      And in Thy name, for robbery and wrong      At Thy own altars pray?       Is not Thy hand stretched forth      Visibly in the heavens, to awe and smite?      Shall not the living God of all the earth,      And heaven above, do right?       Woe, then, to all who grind      Their brethren of a common Father down!      To all who plunder from the immortal mind      Its bright and glorious crown!       Woe to the priesthood! woe      To those whose hire is with the price of blood;      Perverting, darkening, changing, as they go,      The searching truths of God!       Their glory and their might      Shall perish; and their very names shall be      Vile before all the people, in the light      Of a world's liberty.       Oh, speed the moment on      When Wrong shall cease, and Liberty and Love      And Truth and Right throughout the earth be known      As in their home above.       1836.     A SUMMONS  Written on the adoption of Pinckney's Resolutions in the House of Representatives, and the passage of Calhoun's \"Bill for excluding Papers written or printed, touching the subject of Slavery, from the U. S. Post-office,\" in the Senate of the United States. Mr. Pinckney's resolutions were in brief that Congress had no authority to interfere in any way with slavery in the States; that it ought not to interfere with it in the District of Columbia, and that all resolutions to that end should be laid on the table without printing. Mr. Calhoun's bill made it a penal offence for post-masters in any State, District, or Territory \"knowingly to deliver, to any person whatever, any pamphlet, newspaper, handbill, or other printed paper or pictorial representation, touching the subject of slavery, where, by the laws of the said State, District, or Territory, their circulation was prohibited.\"       MEN of the North-land! where's the manly spirit      Of the true-hearted and the unshackled gone?      Sons of old freemen, do we but inherit      Their names alone?       Is the old Pilgrim spirit quenched within us,      Stoops the strong manhood of our souls so low,      That Mammon's lure or Party's wile can win us      To silence now?       Now, when our land to ruin's brink is verging,      In God's name, let us speak while there is time!      Now, when the padlocks for our lips are forging,      Silence is crime!       What! shall we henceforth humbly ask as favors      Rights all our own? In madness shall we barter,      For treacherous peace, the freedom Nature gave us,      God and our charter?       Here shall the statesman forge his human fetters,      Here the false jurist human rights deny,      And in the church, their proud and skilled abettors      Make truth a lie?       Torture the pages of the hallowed Bible,      To sanction crime, and robbery, and blood?      And, in Oppression's hateful service, libel      Both man and God?       Shall our New England stand erect no longer,      But stoop in chains upon her downward way,      Thicker to gather on her limbs and stronger      Day after day?       Oh no; methinks from all her wild, green mountains;      From valleys where her slumbering fathers lie;      From her blue rivers and her welling fountains,      And clear, cold sky;       From her rough coast, and isles, which hungry Ocean      Gnaws with his surges; from the fisher's skiff,      With white sail swaying to the billows' motion      Round rock and cliff;       From the free fireside of her untought farmer;      From her free laborer at his loom and wheel;      From the brown smith-shop, where, beneath the hammer,      Rings the red steel;       From each and all, if God hath not forsaken      Our land, and left us to an evil choice,      Loud as the summer thunderbolt shall waken      A People's voice.       Startling and stern! the Northern winds shall bear it      Over Potomac's to St. Mary's wave;      And buried Freedom shall awake to hear it      Within her grave.       Oh, let that voice go forth! The bondman sighing      By Santee's wave, in Mississippi's cane,      Shall feel the hope, within his bosom dying,      Revive again.       Let it go forth! The millions who are gazing      Sadly upon us from afar shall smile,      And unto God devout thanksgiving raising      Bless us the while.       Oh for your ancient freedom, pure and holy,      For the deliverance of a groaning earth,      For the wronged captive, bleeding, crushed, and lowly,      Let it go forth!       Sons of the best of fathers! will ye falter      With all they left ye perilled and at stake?      Ho! once again on Freedom's holy altar      The fire awake.       Prayer-strenthened for the trial, come together,      Put on the harness for the moral fight,      And, with the blessing of your Heavenly Father,      Maintain the right       1836.     TO THE MEMORY OF THOMAS SHIPLEY.  Thomas Shipley of Philadelphia was a lifelong Christian philanthropist, and advocate of emancipation. At his funeral thousands of colored people came to take their last look at their friend and protector. He died September 17, 1836.        GONE to thy Heavenly Father's rest!       The flowers of Eden round thee blowing,       And on thine ear the murmurs blest       Of Siloa's waters softly flowing!        Beneath that Tree of Life which gives       To all the earth its healing leaves       In the white robe of angels clad,       And wandering by that sacred river,       Whose streams of holiness make glad       The city of our God forever!        Gentlest of spirits! not for thee       Our tears are shed, our sighs are given;       Why mourn to know thou art a free       Partaker of the joys of heaven?       Finished thy work, and kept thy faith       In Christian firmness unto death;       And beautiful as sky and earth,       When autumn's sun is downward going,       The blessed memory of thy worth       Around thy place of slumber glowing!        But woe for us! who linger still       With feebler strength and hearts less lowly,       And minds less steadfast to the will       Of Him whose every work is holy.       For not like thine, is crucified       The spirit of our human pride       And at the bondman's tale of woe,       And for the outcast and forsaken,       Not warm like thine, but cold and slow,       Our weaker sympathies awaken.        Darkly upon our struggling way       The storm of human hate is sweeping;       Hunted and branded, and a prey,       Our watch amidst the darkness keeping,       Oh, for that hidden strength which can       Nerve unto death the inner man       Oh, for thy spirit, tried and true,       And constant in the hour of trial,       Prepared to suffer, or to do,       In meekness and in self-denial.        Oh, for that spirit, meek and mild,       Derided, spurned, yet uncomplaining;       By man deserted and reviled,       Yet faithful to its trust remaining.       Still prompt and resolute to save       From scourge and chain the hunted slave;       Unwavering in the Truth's defence,       Even where the fires of Hate were burning,       The unquailing eye of innocence       Alone upon the oppressor turning!        O loved of thousands! to thy grave,       Sorrowing of heart, thy brethren bore thee.       The poor man and the rescued slave       Wept as the broken earth closed o'er thee;       And grateful tears, like summer rain,       Quickened its dying grass again!       And there, as to some pilgrim-shrine,       Shall cone the outcast and the lowly,       Of gentle deeds and words of thine       Recalling memories sweet and holy!        Oh, for the death the righteous die!       An end, like autumn's day declining,       On human hearts, as on the"]]]
