When the question of the disposal of Set was being discussed by the gods, Ra ordered that he and his fiends should be given over to Isis and her son Horus, who were to do what they pleased with them.  Horus promptly cut off the heads of Set and his fiends in the presence of Ra and Isis, and be dragged Set by his feet through the country with his spear sticking in his head and neck.  After this Isis appointed Horus of Behutet to be the protecting deity of her son Horus.  The fight between the Sun-god and Set was a very favourite subject with Egyptian writers, and there are many forms of it.  Thus there is the fight between Heru-ur and Set, the fight between Ra and Set, the fight between Heru-Behutet and Set, the fight between Osiris and Set, and the fight between Horus, son of Isis, and Set.  In the oldest times the combat was merely the natural opposition of light to darkness, but later the Sun-god became the symbol of right and truth as well as of light, and Set the symbol of sin and wickedness as well as of darkness, and ultimately the nature myth was forgotten, and the fight between the two gods became the type of the everlasting war which good men wage against sin.  In Coptic literature we have the well-known legend of the slaughter of the dragon by St. George, and this is nothing but a Christian adaptation of the legend of Horus and Set.  After these things Horus, son of Ra, and Horus, son of Isis, each took the form of a mighty man, with the face and body of a hawk, and each wore the Red and White Crowns, and each carried a spear and chain.  In these forms the two gods slew the remnant of the enemies.  Now by some means or other Set came to life again, and he took the form of a mighty hissing or \"roaring\" serpent, and hid himself in the ground, in a place which was ever after called the \"place of the roarer.\"  In front of his hiding-place Horus, son of Isis, stationed himself in the form of a hawk-headed staff to prevent him from coming out.  In spite of this, however, Set managed to escape, and he gathered about him the Smai and Seba fiends at the Lake of Meh, and waged war once more against Horus; the enemies of Ra were again defeated, and Horus slew them in the presence of his father.    PLATE XI. Horus of Behutet and Thoth spearing human victims with the assistance of Isis.  PLATE XII. Horus of Behutet and Thoth spearing Set in the form of a crocodile.    Horus, it seems, now ceased to fight for some time, and devoted himself to keeping guard over the \"Great God\" who was in An-rut-f, a district in or near Herakleopolis.  This Great God was no other than Osiris, and the duty of Horus was to prevent the Smai fiends from coming by night to the place.  In spite of the power of Horus, it was found necessary to summon the aid of Isis to keep away the fiends, and it was only by her words of power that the fiend Ba was kept out of the sanctuary.  As a reward for what he had already done, Thoth decreed that Horus should be called the \"Master-Fighter.\" Passing over the derivations of place- names which occur here in the text, we find that Horus and his Blacksmiths were again obliged to fight bodies of the enemy who had managed to escape, and that on one occasion they killed one hundred and six foes.  In every fight the Blacksmiths performed mighty deeds of valour, and in reward for their services a special district was allotted to them to dwell in.  The last great fight in the North took place at Tanis, in the eastern part of the Delta.  When the position of the enemy had been located, Horus took the form of a lion with the face of a man, and he put on his head the Triple Crown.  His claws were like flints, and with them he dragged away one hundred and forty-two of the enemy, and tore them in pieces, and dug out their tongues, which he carried off as symbols of his victory.    Meanwhile rebellion had again broken out in Nubia, where about one- third of the enemy had taken refuge in the river in the forms of crocodiles and hippopotami.  Ra counselled Horus to sail up the Nile with his Blacksmiths, and when Thoth had recited the \"Chapters of protecting the Boat of Ra\" over the boats, the expedition set sail for the South.  The object of reciting these spells was to prevent the monsters which were in the river from making the waves to rise and from stirring up storms which might engulf the boats of Ra and Horus and the Blacksmiths.  When the rebels and fiends who had been uttering, treason against Horus saw the boat of Ra, with the winged Disk of Horus accompanied by the goddesses Uatchet and Nekhebet in the form of serpents, they were smitten with fear, and their hearts quaked, and all power of resistance left them, and they died of fright straightway. When Horus returned in triumph to Edfu, Ra ordered that an image of the winged Disk should be placed in each of his sanctuaries, and that in every place wherein a winged Disk was set, that sanctuary should be a sanctuary of Horus of Behutet.  The winged disks which are seen above the doorways of the temples still standing in Egypt show that the command of Ra, was faithfully carried out by the priests.    PLATE XIII. Horus of Behutet in the form of a lion slaying his foes.     V.     LEGEND OF THE BIRTH OF HORUS, SON OF ISIS AND OSIRIS.    PLATE XIV. The Procreation of Horus, son of Isis.    The text which contains this legend is found cut in hieroglyphics upon a stele which is now preserved in Paris.  Attention was first called to it by Chabas, who in 1857 gave a translation of it in the Revue Archeologique, p. 65 ff., and pointed out the importance of its contents with his characteristic ability.  The hieroglyphic text was first published by Ledrain in his work on the monuments of the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris,[FN#24] and I gave a transcript of the text, with transliteration and translation, in 1895.[FN#25]    [FN#24]  Les Monuments Egyptiens (Cabinet des Medailles et Antiques), In the Bibliotheque de l'Ecole des Hautes Etudes, Paris, 1879-1882, plate xxii. ff.   [FN#25]  First Steps in Egyptian, pp. 179-188.    The greater part of the text consists of a hymn to Osiris, which was probably composed under the XVIIIth Dynasty, when an extraordinary development of the cult of that god took place, and when he was placed by Egyptian theologians at the head of all the gods.  Though unseen in the temples, his presence filled all Egypt, and his body formed the very substance of the country.  He was the God of all gods and the Governor of the Two Companies of the gods, he formed the soul and body of Ra, he was the beneficent Spirit of all spirits, he was himself the celestial food on which the Doubles in the Other World lived. He was the greatest of the gods in On (Heliopolis), Memphis, Herakleopolis, Hermopolis, Abydos, and the region of the First Cataract, and so.  He embodied in his own person the might of Ra-Tem, Apis and Ptah, the Horus-gods, Thoth and Khnemu, and his rule over Busiris and Abydos continued to be supreme, as it had been for many, many hundreds of years.  He was the source of the Nile, the north wind sprang from him, his seats were the stars of heaven which never set, and the imperishable stars were his ministers.  All heaven was his dominion, and the doors of the sky opened before him of their own accord when he appeared.  He inherited the earth from his father Keb, and the sovereignty of heaven from his mother Nut.  In his person he united endless time in the past and endless time in the future.  Like Ra he had fought Seba, or Set, the monster of evil, and had defeated him, and his victory assured to him lasting authority over the gods and the dead.  He exercised his creative power in making land and water, trees and herbs, cattle and other four-footed beasts, birds of all kinds, and fish and creeping things; even the waste spaces of the desert owed allegiance to him as the creator.  And he rolled out the sky, and set the light above the darkness.  The last paragraph of the text contains an allusion to Isis, the sister and wife of Osiris, and mentions the legend of the birth of Horus, which even under the XVIIIth Dynasty was very ancient, Isis, we are told, was the constant protectress of her brother, she drove away the fiends that wanted to attack him, and kept them out of his shrine and tomb, and she guarded him from all accidents.  All these things she did by means of spells and incantations, large numbers of which were known to her, and by her power as the \"witch-goddess.\"  Her \"mouth was trained to perfection, and she made no mistake in pronouncing her spells, and her tongue was skilled and halted not.\"  At length came the unlucky day when Set succeeded in killing Osiris during the war which the \"good god\" was waging against him and his fiends.  Details of the engagement are wanting, but the Pyramid Texts state that the body of Osiris was hurled to the ground by Set at a place called Netat, which seems to have been near Abydos.[FN#26]  The news of the death of Osiris was brought to Isis, and she at once set out to find his body.  All legends agree in saying that she took the form of a bird, and that she flew about unceasingly, going hither and thither, and uttering wailing cries of grief.  At length she found the body, and with a piercing cry she alighted on the ground.  The Pyramid Texts say that Nephthys was with her that \"Isis came, Nephthys came, the one on the right side, the other on the left side, one in the form of a Hat bird, the other in the form of a Tchert bird, and they found Osiris thrown on the ground in Netat by his brother Set.\"  The late form of the legend goes on to say that Isis fanned the body with her feathers, and produced air, and that at length she caused the inert members of Osiris to move, and drew from him his essence, wherefrom she produced her child Horus.

This bare statement of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9411"],["title","Legends of the Gods (#6)"],["body"," dogma of the conception of Horus does not represent all that is known about it, and it may well be supplemented by a passage from the Pyramid Texts,[FN#27] which reads, \"Adoration to thee, O Osiris.[FN#28]  Rise thou up on thy left side, place thyself on thy right side.  This water which I give unto thee is the water of youth (or rejuvenation).  Adoration to thee, O Osiris!  Rise thou up on thy left side, place thyself on thy right side.  This bread which I have made for thee is warmth.  Adoration to thee, O Osiris!  The doors of heaven are opened to thee, the doors of the streams are thrown wide open to thee.  The gods in the city of Pe come [to thee], Osiris, at the sound (or voice) of the supplication of Isis and Nephthys. . . . . Thy elder sister took thy body in her arms, she chafed thy hands, she clasped thee to her breast [when] she found thee [lying] on thy side on the plain of Netat.\"  And in another place we read:[FN#29] \"Thy two sisters, Isis and Nephthys, came to thee, Kam-urt, in thy name of Kam-ur, Uatchet-urt, in thy name of Uatch-ur . . . . . . . Isis and Nephthys weave magical protection for thee in the city of Saut, for thee their lord, in thy name of 'Lord of Saut,' for their god, in thy name of 'God.'  They praise thee; go not thou far from them in thy name of 'Tua.'  They present offerings to thee; be not wroth in thy name of 'Tchentru.'  Thy sister Isis cometh to thee rejoicing in her love for thee.[FN#30]  Thou hast union with her, thy seed entereth her.  She conceiveth in the form of the star Septet (Sothis).  Horus-Sept issueth from thee in the form of Horus, dweller in the star Septet.  Thou makest a spirit to be in him in his name 'Spirit dwelling in the god Tchentru.'  He avengeth thee in his name of 'Horus, the son who avenged his father.'  Hail, Osiris, Keb hath brought to thee Horus, he hath avenged thee, he hath brought to thee the hearts of the gods, Horus hath given thee his Eye, thou hast taken possession of the Urert Crown thereby at the head of the gods.  Horus hath presented to thee thy members, he hath collected them completely, there is no disorder in thee.  Thoth hath seized thy enemy and hath slain him and those who were with him.\"  The above words are addressed to dead kings in the Pyramid Texts, and what the gods were supposed to do for them was believed by the Egyptians to have been actually done for Osiris.  These extracts are peculiarly valuable, for they prove that the legend of Osiris which was current under the XVIIIth Dynasty was based upon traditions which were universally accepted in Egypt under the Vth and VIth Dynasties.

The hymn concludes with a reference to the accession of Horus, son of Isis, the flesh and bone of Osiris, to the throne of his grandfather Keb, and to the welcome which he received from the Tchatcha, or Administrators of heaven, and the Company of the Gods, and the Lords of Truth, who assembled in the Great House of Heliopolis to acknowledge his sovereignty.  His succession also received the approval of Neb-er- tcher, who, as we saw from the first legend in this book, was the Creator of the Universe.      VI.    A LEGEND OF KHENSU NEFER-HETEP[FN#31] AND THE PRINCESS OF BEKHTEN.    [FN#31]    In the headlines of this section, p. 106 ff., for Ptah Nefer-hetep read Khensu Nefer-hetep.    The text of this legend is cut in hieroglyphics upon a sandstone stele, with a rounded top, which was found in the temple of Khensu at Thebes, and is now preserved in the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris; it was discovered by Champollion, and removed to Paris by Prisse d'Avennes in 1846.  The text was first published by Prisse d'Avennes,[FN#32] and it was first translated by Birch[FN#33] in 1853.  The text was republished and translated into French by E. de Rouge in 1858,[FN#34] and several other renderings have been given in German and in English since that date.[FN#35]  When the text was first published, and for some years afterwards, it was generally thought that the legend referred to events which were said to have taken place under a king who was identified as Rameses XIII., but this misconception was corrected by Erman, who showed[FN#36] that the king was in reality Rameses II.  By a careful examination of the construction of the text he proved that the narrative on the stele was drawn up several hundreds of years after the events described in it took place, and that its author was but imperfectly acquainted with the form of the Egyptian language in use in the reign of Rameses II.  In fact, the legend was written in the interests of the priests of the temple of Khensu, who wished to magnify their god and his power to cast out devils and to exorcise evil spirits; it was probably composed between B.C. 650 and B.C. 250.[FN#37]    [FN#32]  Choix de Monuments Egyptiens, Paris, 1847, plate xxiv.

[FN#36]  Aeg. Zeit., 1883, pp. 54-60.  [FN#37]  Maspero, Les Contes Populaires, 3rd edit., p. 166.     The legend, after enumerating the great names of Rameses II., goes on to state that the king was in the \"country of the two rivers,\" by which we are to understand some portion of Mesopotamia, the rivers being the Tigris and Euphrates, and that the local chiefs were bringing to him tribute consisting of gold, lapis-lazuli, turquoise, and logs of wood from the Land of the God.  It is difficult to understand how gold and logs of wood from Southern Arabia and East Africa came to be produced as tribute by chiefs who lived so far to the north.  Among those who sent gifts was the Prince of Bekhten, and at the head of all his tribute he sent his eldest daughter, bearing his message of homage and duty.  Now the maiden was beautiful, and the King of Egypt thought her so lovely that be took her to wife, and bestowed upon her the name \"Ra- neferu,\" which means something like the \"beauties of Ra.\"  He took her back with him to Egypt, where she was installed as Queen.  During the summer of the fifteenth year of his reign, whilst Rameses II. was celebrating a festival of Amen-Ra in the Temple of Luxor, one came to him and reported that an envoy had arrived from the Prince of Bekhten, bearing with him many gifts for the Royal Wife Ra-neferu. When the envoy had been brought into the presence, he addressed words of homage to the king, and, having presented the gifts from his lord, he said that he had come to beg His Majesty to send a \"learned man,\" i.e., a magician, to Bekhten to attend Bent-enth-resh, His Majesty's sister-in-law, who was stricken with some disease.  Thereupon the king summoned the learned men of the House of Life, i.e., the members of the great College of Magic at Thebes, and the qenbetu officials, and when they had entered his presence, he commanded them to select a man of \"wise heart and deft fingers\" to go to Bekhten.  The choice fell upon one Tehuti-em-heb, and His Majesty sent him to Bekhten with the envoy. When they arrived in Bekhten, Tehuti-em-heb found that the Princess Bent-enth-resh was possessed by an evil spirit which refused to be exorcised by him, and he was unable to cast out the devil.  The Prince of Bekhten, seeing that the healing of his daughter was beyond the power of the Egyptian, sent a second envoy to Rameses II., and besought him to send a god to drive out the devil.  This envoy arrived in Egypt in the summer of the twenty-sixth year of the reign of Rameses II., and found the king celebrating a festival in Thebes.  When he heard the petition of the envoy, he went to the Temple of Khensu Nefer-hetep \"a second time,\"[FN#38] and presented himself before the god and besought his help on behalf of his sister-in-law.    [FN#38]  Thus the king must have invoked the help of Khensu on the occasion of the visit of the first envoy.    Then the priests of Khensu Nefer-hetep carried the statue of this god to the place where was the statue of Khensu surnamed \"Pa-ari-sekher,\" i.e., the \"Worker of destinies,\" who was able to repel the attacks of evil spirits and to drive them out.  When the statues of the two gods were facing each other, Rameses II. entreated Khensu Nefer-hetep to \"turn his face towards,\" i.e., to look favourably upon Khensu.  Pa-ari- sekher, and to let him go to Bekhten to drive the devil out of the Princess of Bekhten.  The text affords no explanation of the fact that Khensu Nefer-hetep was regarded as a greater god than Khensu Pa-ari- sekher, or why his permission had to be obtained before the latter could leave the country.  It is probable that the demands made upon Khensu Nefer-hetep by the Egyptians who lived in Thebes and its neighbourhood were so numerous that it was impossible to let his statue go into outlying districts or foreign lands, and that a deputy-god was appointed to perform miracles outside Thebes.  This arrangement would benefit the people, and would, moreover, bring much money to the priests.  The appointment of a deputy-god is not so strange as it may seem, and modern African peoples are familiar with the expedient. About one hundred years ago the priests of the god Bobowissi of Winnebah, in the Tshi region of West Africa, found their business so large that it was absolutely necessary for them to appoint a deputy. The priests therefore selected Brahfo, i.e., \"deputy,\""]]]
