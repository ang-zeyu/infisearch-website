By this and by that, my head hummeth like to a hive of bees on a hot June day.\"  Then he clapped his horn to his lips and winded a blast that went echoing sweetly down the forest paths. \"Ay, marry,\" quoth he again, \"thou art a tall lad, and eke a brave one, for ne'er, I bow, is there a man betwixt here and Canterbury Town could do the like to me that thou hast done.\"  \"And thou,\" quoth the stranger, laughing, \"takest thy cudgeling like a brave heart and a stout yeoman.\"  But now the distant twigs and branches rustled with the coming of men, and suddenly a score or two of good stout yeomen, all clad in Lincoln green, burst from out the covert, with merry Will Stutely at their head.  \"Good master,\" cried Will, \"how is this? Truly thou art all wet from head to foot, and that to the very skin.\"  \"Why, marry,\" answered jolly Robin, \"yon stout fellow hath tumbled me neck and crop into the water and hath given me a drubbing beside.\"  \"Then shall he not go without a ducking and eke a drubbing himself!\" cried Will Stutely. \"Have at him, lads!\"  Then Will and a score of yeomen leaped upon the stranger, but though they sprang quickly they found him ready and felt him strike right and left with his stout staff, so that, though he went down with press of numbers, some of them rubbed cracked crowns before he was overcome.  \"Nay, forbear!\" cried Robin, laughing until his sore sides ached again. \"He is a right good man and true, and no harm shall befall him. Now hark ye, good youth, wilt thou stay with me and be one of my band? Three suits of Lincoln green shalt thou have each year, beside forty marks in fee, and share with us whatsoever good shall befall us. Thou shalt eat sweet venison and quaff the stoutest ale, and mine own good right-hand man shalt thou be, for never did I see such a cudgel player in all my life before. Speak! Wilt thou be one of my good merry men?\"  \"That know I not,\" quoth the stranger surlily, for he was angry at being so tumbled about. \"If ye handle yew bow and apple shaft no better than ye do oaken cudgel, I wot ye are not fit to be called yeomen in my country; but if there be any man here that can shoot a better shaft than I, then will I bethink me of joining with you.\"  \"Now by my faith,\" said Robin, \"thou art a right saucy varlet, sirrah; yet I will stoop to thee as I never stooped to man before. Good Stutely, cut thou a fair white piece of bark four fingers in breadth, and set it fourscore yards distant on yonder oak. Now, stranger, hit that fairly with a gray goose shaft and call thyself an archer.\"  \"Ay, marry, that will I,\" answered he. \"Give me a good stout bow and a fair broad arrow, and if I hit it not, strip me and beat me blue with bowstrings.\"  Then he chose the stoutest bow among them all, next to Robin's own, and a straight gray goose shaft, well-feathered and smooth, and stepping to the mark--while all the band, sitting or lying upon the greensward, watched to see him shoot--he drew the arrow to his cheek and loosed the shaft right deftly, sending it so straight down the path that it clove the mark in the very center. \"Aha!\" cried he, \"mend thou that if thou canst;\" while even the yeomen clapped their hands at so fair a shot.  \"That is a keen shot indeed,\" quoth Robin. \"Mend it I cannot, but mar it I may, perhaps.\"  Then taking up his own good stout bow and nocking an arrow with care, he shot with his very greatest skill. Straight flew the arrow, and so true that it lit fairly upon the stranger's shaft and split it into splinters. Then all the yeomen leaped to their feet and shouted for joy that their master had shot so well.  \"Now by the lusty yew bow of good Saint Withold,\" cried the stranger, \"that is a shot indeed, and never saw I the like in all my life before! Now truly will I be thy man henceforth and for aye. Good Adam Bell(1) was a fair shot, but never shot he so!\"        (1) Adam Bell, Clym o' the Clough, and William of Cloudesly      were three noted north-country bowmen whose names have been      celebrated in many ballads of the olden time.   \"Then have I gained a right good man this day,\" quoth jolly Robin. \"What name goest thou by, good fellow?\"  \"Men call me John Little whence I came,\" answered the stranger.  Then Will Stutely, who loved a good jest, spoke up. \"Nay, fair little stranger,\" said he, \"I like not thy name and fain would I have it otherwise. Little art thou indeed, and small of bone and sinew, therefore shalt thou be christened Little John, and I will be thy godfather.\"  Then Robin Hood and all his band laughed aloud until the stranger began to grow angry.  \"An thou make a jest of me,\" quoth he to Will Stutely, \"thou wilt have sore bones and little pay, and that in short season.\"  \"Nay, good friend,\" said Robin Hood, \"bottle thine anger, for the name fitteth thee well. Little John shall thou be called henceforth, and Little John shall it be. So come, my merry men, we will prepare a christening feast for this fair infant.\"  So turning their backs upon the stream, they plunged into the forest once more, through which they traced their steps till they reached the spot where they dwelled in the depths of the woodland. There had they built huts of bark and branches of trees, and made couches of sweet rushes spread over with skins of fallow deer. Here stood a great oak tree with branches spreading broadly around, beneath which was a seat of green moss where Robin Hood was wont to sit at feast and at merrymaking with his stout men about him. Here they found the rest of the band, some of whom had come in with a brace of fat does. Then they all built great fires and after a time roasted the does and broached a barrel of humming ale. Then when the feast was ready they all sat down, but Robin placed Little John at his right hand, for he was henceforth to be the second in the band.  Then when the feast was done Will Stutely spoke up. \"It is now time, I ween, to christen our bonny babe, is it not so, merry boys?\" And \"Aye! Aye!\" cried all, laughing till the woods echoed with their mirth.  \"Then seven sponsors shall we have,\" quoth Will Stutely, and hunting among all the band, he chose the seven stoutest men of them all.  \"Now by Saint Dunstan,\" cried Little John, springing to his feet, \"more than one of you shall rue it an you lay finger upon me.\"  But without a word they all ran upon him at once, seizing him by his legs and arms and holding him tightly in spite of his struggles, and they bore him forth while all stood around to see the sport. Then one came forward who had been chosen to play the priest because he had a bald crown, and in his hand he carried a brimming pot of ale. \"Now, who bringeth this babe?\" asked he right soberly.  \"That do I,\" answered Will Stutely.  \"And what name callest thou him?\"  \"Little John call I him.\"  \"Now Little John,\" quoth the mock priest, \"thou hast not lived heretofore, but only got thee along through the world, but henceforth thou wilt live indeed. When thou livedst not thou wast called John Little, but now that thou dost live indeed, Little John shalt thou be called, so christen I thee.\" And at these last words he emptied the pot of ale upon Little John's head.  Then all shouted with laughter as they saw the good brown ale stream over Little John's beard and trickle from his nose and chin, while his eyes blinked with the smart of it. At first he was of a mind to be angry but found he could not, because the others were so merry; so he, too, laughed with the rest. Then Robin took this sweet, pretty babe, clothed him all anew from top to toe in Lincoln green, and gave him a good stout bow, and so made him a member of the merry band.  And thus it was that Robin Hood became outlawed; thus a band of merry companions gathered about him, and thus he gained his right-hand man, Little John; and so the prologue ends. And now I will tell how the Sheriff of Nottingham three times sought to take Robin Hood, and how he failed each time.     Robin Hood and the Tinker  Now it was told before how two hundred pounds were set upon Robin Hood's head, and how the Sheriff of Nottingham swore that he himself would seize Robin, both because he would fain have the two hundred pounds and because the slain man was a kinsman of his own. Now the Sheriff did not yet know what a force Robin had about him in Sherwood, but thought that he might serve a warrant for his arrest as he could upon any other man that had broken the laws; therefore he offered fourscore golden angels to anyone who would serve this warrant. But men of Nottingham Town knew more of Robin Hood and his doings than the Sheriff did, and many laughed to think of serving a warrant upon the bold outlaw, knowing well that all they would get for such service would be cracked crowns; so that no one came forward to take the matter in hand. Thus a fortnight passed, in which time none came forward to do the Sheriff's business. Then said he, \"A right good reward have I offered to whosoever would serve my warrant upon Robin Hood, and I marvel that no one has come to undertake the task.\"  Then one of his men who was near him said, \"Good master, thou wottest not the force that Robin Hood has about him and how little he cares for warrant of king or sheriff. Truly, no one likes to go on this service, for fear of cracked crowns and broken bones.\"  \"Then I hold all Nottingham men to be cowards,\" said the Sheriff. \"And let me see the man in all Nottinghamshire that dare disobey the warrant of our sovereign lord King Harry, for, by the shrine of Saint Edmund, I will hang him forty cubits high! But if no man in Nottingham dare win fourscore angels, I will send elsewhere, for there should be men of mettle somewhere in this land.\"  Then he called up a messenger in whom he placed great trust, and bade him saddle his horse and make ready to go to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/964"],["title","The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood (#3)"],["body","Town to see whether he could find anyone there that would do his bidding and win the reward. So that same morning the messenger started forth upon his errand.  Bright shone the sun upon the dusty highway that led from Nottingham to Lincoln, stretching away all white over hill and dale. Dusty was the highway and dusty the throat of the messenger, so that his heart was glad when he saw before him the Sign of the Blue Boar Inn, when somewhat more than half his journey was done. The inn looked fair to his eyes, and the shade of the oak trees that stood around it seemed cool and pleasant, so he alighted from his horse to rest himself for a time, calling for a pot of ale to refresh his thirsty throat.  There he saw a party of right jovial fellows seated beneath the spreading oak that shaded the greensward in front of the door. There was a tinker, two barefoot friars, and a party of six of the King's foresters all clad in Lincoln green, and all of them were quaffing humming ale and singing merry ballads of the good old times. Loud laughed the foresters, as jests were bandied about between the singing, and louder laughed the friars, for they were lusty men with beards that curled like the wool of black rams; but loudest of all laughed the Tinker, and he sang more sweetly than any of the rest. His bag and his hammer hung upon a twig of the oak tree, and near by leaned his good stout cudgel, as thick as his wrist and knotted at the end.  \"Come,\" cried one of the foresters to the tired messenger, \"come join us for this shot. Ho, landlord! Bring a fresh pot of ale for each man.\"  The messenger was glad enough to sit down along with the others who were there, for his limbs were weary and the ale was good.  \"Now what news bearest thou so fast?\" quoth one, \"and whither ridest thou today?\"  The messenger was a chatty soul and loved a bit of gossip dearly; besides, the pot of ale warmed his heart; so that, settling himself in an easy corner of the inn bench, while the host leaned upon the doorway and the hostess stood with her hands beneath her apron, he unfolded his budget of news with great comfort. He told all from the very first: how Robin Hood had slain the forester, and how he had hidden in the greenwood to escape the law; how that he lived therein, all against the law, God wot, slaying His Majesty's deer and levying toll on fat abbot, knight, and esquire, so that none dare travel even on broad Watling Street or the Fosse Way for fear of him; how that the Sheriff had a mind to serve the King's warrant upon this same rogue, though little would he mind warrant of either king or sheriff, for he was far from being a law-abiding man. Then he told how none could be found in all Nottingham Town to serve this warrant, for fear of cracked pates and broken bones, and how that he, the messenger, was now upon his way to Lincoln Town to find of what mettle the Lincoln men might be.  \"Now come I, forsooth, from good Banbury Town,\" said the jolly Tinker, \"and no one nigh Nottingham--nor Sherwood either, an that be the mark--can hold cudgel with my grip. Why, lads, did I not meet that mad wag Simon of Ely, even at the famous fair at Hertford Town, and beat him in the ring at that place before Sir Robert of Leslie and his lady? This same Robin Hood, of whom, I wot, I never heard before, is a right merry blade, but gin he be strong, am not I stronger? And gin he be sly, am not I slyer? Now by the bright eyes of Nan o' the Mill, and by mine own name and that's Wat o' the Crabstaff, and by mine own mother's son, and that's myself, will I, even I, Wat o' the Crabstaff, meet this same sturdy rogue, and gin he mind not the seal of our glorious sovereign King Harry, and the warrant of the good Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, I will so bruise, beat, and bemaul his pate that he shall never move finger or toe again! Hear ye that, bully boys?\"  \"Now art thou the man for my farthing,\" cried the messenger. \"And back thou goest with me to Nottingham Town.\"  \"Nay,\" quoth the Tinker, shaking his head slowly from side to side. \"Go I with no man gin it be not with mine own free will.\"  \"Nay, nay,\" said the messenger, \"no man is there in Nottinghamshire could make thee go against thy will, thou brave fellow.\"  \"Ay, that be I brave,\" said the Tinker.  \"Ay, marry,\" said the messenger, \"thou art a brave lad; but our good Sheriff hath offered fourscore angels of bright gold to whosoever shall serve the warrant upon Robin Hood; though little good will it do.\"  \"Then I will go with thee, lad. Do but wait till I get my bag and hammer, and my cudgel. Ay, let' me but meet this same Robin Hood, and let me see whether he will not mind the King's warrant.\" So, after having paid their score, the messenger, with the Tinker striding beside his nag, started back to Nottingham again.  One bright morning soon after this time, Robin Hood started off to Nottingham Town to find what was a-doing there, walking merrily along the roadside where the grass was sweet with daisies, his eyes wandering and his thoughts also. His bugle horn hung at his hip and his bow and arrows at his back, while in his hand he bore a good stout oaken staff, which he twirled with his fingers as he strolled along.  As thus he walked down a shady lane he saw a tinker coming, trolling a merry song as he drew nigh. On his back hung his bag and his hammer, and in his hand he carried a right stout crabstaff full six feet long, and thus sang he:       \"_In peascod time, when hound to horn      Gives ear till buck be killed,      And little lads with pipes of corn      Sit keeping beasts afield_--\"  \"Halloa, good friend!\" cried Robin.  \"I WENT TO GATHER STRAWBERRIES--\"  \"Halloa!\" cried Robin again.  \"BY WOODS AND GROVES FULL FAIR--\"  \"Halloa! Art thou deaf, man? Good friend, say I!\"  \"And who art thou dost so boldly check a fair song?\" quoth the Tinker, stopping in his singing. \"Halloa, shine own self, whether thou be good friend or no. But let me tell thee, thou stout fellow, gin thou be a good friend it were well for us both; but gin thou be no good friend it were ill for thee.\"  \"And whence comest thou, my lusty blade?\" quoth Robin.  \"I come from Banbury,\" answered the Tinker.  \"Alas!\" quoth Robin, \"I hear there is sad news this merry morn.\"  \"Ha! Is it indeed so?\" cried the Tinker eagerly. \"Prythee tell it speedily, for I am a tinker by trade, as thou seest, and as I am in my trade I am greedy for news, even as a priest is greedy for farthings.\"  \"Well then,\" quoth Robin, \"list thou and I will tell, but bear thyself up bravely, for the news is sad, I wot. Thus it is: I hear that two tinkers are in the stocks for drinking ale and beer!\"  \"Now a murrain seize thee and thy news, thou scurvy dog,\" quoth the Tinker, \"for thou speakest but ill of good men. But sad news it is indeed, gin there be two stout fellows in the stocks.\"  \"Nay,\" said Robin, \"thou hast missed the mark and dost but weep for the wrong sow. The sadness of the news lieth in that there be but two in the stocks, for the others do roam the country at large.\"  \"Now by the pewter platter of Saint Dunstan,\" cried the Tinker, \"I have a good part of a mind to baste thy hide for thine ill jest. But gin men be put in the stocks for drinking ale and beer, I trow thou wouldst not lose thy part.\"  Loud laughed Robin and cried, \"Now well taken, Tinker, well taken! Why, thy wits are like beer, and do froth up most when they grow sour! But right art thou, man, for I love ale and beer right well. Therefore come straightway with me hard by to the Sign of the Blue Boar, and if thou drinkest as thou appearest--and I wot thou wilt not belie thy looks--I will drench thy throat with as good homebrewed as ever was tapped in all broad Nottinghamshire.\"  \"Now by my faith,\" said the Tinker, \"thou art a right good fellow in spite of thy scurvy jests. I love thee, my sweet chuck, and gin I go not with thee to that same Blue Boar thou mayst call me a heathen.\"  \"Tell me thy news, good friend, I prythee,\" quoth Robin as they trudged along together, \"for tinkers, I ween, are all as full of news as an egg of meat.\"  \"Now I love thee as my brother, my bully blade,\" said the Tinker, \"else I would not tell thee my news; for sly am I, man, and I have in hand a grave undertaking that doth call for all my wits, for I come to seek a bold outlaw that men, hereabouts, call Robin Hood. Within my pouch I have a warrant, all fairly written out on parchment, forsooth, with a great red seal for to make it lawful. Could I but meet this same Robin Hood I would serve it upon his dainty body, and if he minded it not I would beat him till every one of his ribs would cry Amen. But thou livest hereabouts, mayhap thou knowest Robin Hood thyself, good fellow.\"  \"Ay, marry, that I do somewhat,\" quoth Robin, \"and I have seen him this very morn. But, Tinker, men say that he is but a sad, sly thief. Thou hadst better watch thy warrant, man, or else he may steal it out of thy very pouch.\"  \"Let him but try!\" cried the Tinker. \"Sly may he be, but sly am I, too. I would I had him here now, man to man!\" And he made his heavy cudgel to spin again. \"But what manner of man is he, lad?  \"Much like myself,\" said Robin, laughing, \"and in height and build and age nigh the same; and he hath blue eyes, too.\"  \"Nay,\" quoth the Tinker, \"thou art but a green youth. I thought him to be a great bearded man. Nottingham men feared him so.\"  \"Truly, he is not so old nor so stout as thou art,\" said Robin. \"But men do call him a right deft hand at quarterstaff.\"  \"That may be,\" said the Tinker right sturdily, \"but I am more deft than he, for did I not overcome Simon of Ely in a fair bout in the ring at Hertford Town? But if thou knowest him, my jolly blade, wilt thou go with me and bring me to him? Fourscore bright angels hath the Sheriff promised me if I serve the warrant upon the knave's body, and ten of them will I give to thee if thou showest me him.\"  \"Ay, that will I,\" quoth Robin, \"but show me thy warrant, man, "]]]
