This curious \"Book\" describes the origin not only of heaven, and earth, and all therein, but also of God Himself.  In it the name of Apep is not even mentioned, and it is impossible to explain its appearance in the Apep Ritual unless we assume that the whole \"Book\" was regarded as a spell of the most potent character, the mere recital of which was fraught with deadly effect for Apep and his friends.  The story of the Creation is supposed to be told by the god Neb-er- tcher.  This name means the \"Lord to the uttermost limit,\" and the character of the god suggests that the word \"limit\" refers to time and space, and that he was, in fact, the Everlasting God of the Universe. This god's name occurs in Coptic texts, and then he appears as one who possesses all the attributes which are associated by modern nations with God Almighty.  Where and how Neb-er-tcher existed is not said, but it seems as if he was believed to have been an almighty and invisible power which filled all space.  It seems also that a desire arose in him to create the world, and in order to do this he took upon himself the form of the god Khepera, who from first to last was regarded as the Creator, par excellence, among all the gods known to the Egyptians. When this transformation of Neb-er-tcher into Khepera took place the heavens and the earth had not been created, but there seems to have existed a vast mass of water, or world-ocean, called Nu, and it must have been in this that the transformation took place.  In this celestial ocean were the germs of all the living things which afterwards took form in heaven and on earth, but they existed in a state of inertness and helplessness.  Out of this ocean Khepera raised himself, and so passed from a state of passiveness and inertness into one of activity.  When Khepera raised himself out of the ocean Nu, he found himself in vast empty space, wherein was nothing on which he could stand.  The second version of the legend says that Khepera gave being to himself by uttering his own name, and the first version states that he made use of words in providing himself with a place on which to stand.  In other words, when Khepera was still a portion of the being of Neb-er-tcher, he spake the word \"Khepera,\" and Khepera came into being.  Similarly, when he needed a place whereon to stand, he uttered the name of the thing, or place, on which he wanted to stand, and that thing, or place, came into being.  This spell he seems to have addressed to his heart, or as we should say, will, so that Khepera willed this standing-place to appear, and it did so forthwith.  The first version only mentions a heart, but the second also speaks of a heart-soul as assisting Khepera in his first creative acts; and we may assume that he thought out in his heart what manner of thing be wished to create, and then by uttering its name caused his thought to take concrete form.  This process of thinking out the existence of things is expressed in Egyptian by words which mean \"laying the foundation in the heart.\"  In arranging his thoughts and their visible forms Khepera was assisted by the goddess Maat, who is usually regarded as the goddess of law, order, and truth, and in late times was held to be the female counterpart of Thoth, \"the heart of the god Ra.\"  In this legend, however, she seems to play the part of Wisdom, as described in the Book of Proverbs,[FN#3] for it was by Maat that he \"laid the foundation.\"    [FN#3]   \"The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.  I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.  When there were no depths I was brought forth . . . . . . . Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth: while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.  When he prepared the heavens I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth: when he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: when he gave to the sea his decree, . . . . . . when he appointed the foundations of the earth: then I was by him, as one brought up with him. . . . . . .\"  Proverbs, viii. 22 ff.}    Having described the coming into being of Khepera and the place on which he stood, the legend goes on to tell of the means by which the first Egyptian triad, or trinity, came into existence.  Khepera had, in some form, union with his own shadow, and so begot offspring, who proceeded from his body under the forms of the gods Shu and Tefnut. According to a tradition preserved in the Pyramid Texts[FN#4] this event took place at On (Heliopolis), and the old form of the legend ascribes the production of Shu and Tefnut to an act of masturbation. Originally these gods were the personifications of air and dryness, and liquids respectively; thus with their creation the materials for the construction of the atmosphere and sky came into being.  Shu and Tefnut were united, and their offspring were Keb, the Earth-god, and Nut, the Sky-goddess.  We have now five gods in existence; Khepera, the creative principle, Shu, the atmosphere, Tefnut, the waters above the heavens, Nut, the Sky-goddess, and Keb, the Earth-god.  Presumably about this time the sun first rose out of the watery abyss of Nu, and shone upon the world and produced day.  In early times the sun, or his light, was regarded as a form of Shu.  The gods Keb and Nut were united in an embrace, and the effect of the coming of light was to separate them. As long as the sun shone, i.e., as long as it was day, Nut, the Sky- goddess, remained in her place above the earth, being supported by Shu; but as soon as the sun set she left the sky and gradually descended until she rested on the body of the Earth-god, Keb.    [FN#4]   Pepi I., l. 466.    The embraces of Keb caused Nut to bring forth five gods at a birth, namely, Osiris, Horus, Set, Isis, and Nephthys.  Osiris and Isis married before their birth, and Isis brought forth a son called Horus; Set and Nephthys also married before their birth, and Nephthys brought forth a son named Anpu (Anubis), though he is not mentioned in the legend.  Of these gods Osiris is singled out for special mention in the legend, in which Khepera, speaking as Neb-er-tcher, says that his name is Ausares, who is the essence of the primeval matter of which he himself is formed.  Thus Osiris was of the same substance as the Great God who created the world according to the Egyptians, and was a reincarnation of his great-grandfather.  This portion of the legend helps to explain the views held about Osiris as the great ancestral spirit, who when on earth was a benefactor of mankind, and who when in heaven was the saviour of souls.  The legend speaks of the sun as the Eye of Khepera, or Neb-er-tcher, and refers to some calamity which befell it and extinguished its light. This calamity may have been simply the coming of night, or eclipses, or storms; but in any case the god made a second Eye, i.e., the Moon, to which he gave some of the splendour of the other Eye, i.e., the Sun, and he gave it a place in his Face, and henceforth it ruled throughout the earth, and had special powers in respect of the production of trees, plants, vegetables, herbs, etc.  Thus from the earliest times the moon was associated with the fertility of the earth, especially in connection with the production of abundant crops and successful harvests.  According to the legend, men and women sprang not from the earth, but directly from the body of the god Khepera, or Neb-er-tcher, who placed his members together and then wept tears upon them, and men and women, came into being from the tears which had fallen from his eyes.  No special mention is made of the creation of beasts in the legend, but the god says that he created creeping things of all kinds, and among these are probably included the larger quadrupeds.  The men and women, and all the other living creatures which were made at that time, reproduced their species, each in his own way, and so the earth became filled with their descendants which we see at the present time.  Such is the Legend of Creation as it is found in the Papyrus of Nes- Menu.  The text of both versions is full of difficult passages, and some readings are corrupt; unfortunately variant versions by which they might be corrected are lacking.  The general meaning of the legend in both versions is quite clear, and it throws considerable light on the Egyptian religion.  The Egyptians believed in the existence of God, the Creator and Maintainer of all things, but they thought that the concerns of this world were committed by Him to the superintendence of a series of subordinate spirits or beings called \"gods,\" over whom they believed magical spells and ceremonies to have the greatest influence. The Deity was a Being so remote, and of such an exalted nature, that it was idle to expect Him to interfere in the affairs of mortals, or to change any decree or command which He had once uttered.  The spirits or \"gods,\" on the other hand, possessing natures not far removed from those of men, were thought to be amenable to supplications and flattery, and to wheedling and cajolery, especially when accompanied by gifts.  It is of great interest to find a legend in which the power of God as the Creator of the world and the sun and moon is so clearly set forth, embedded in a book of magical spells devoted to the destruction of the mythological monster who existed solely to prevent the sun from rising and shining.       II.    THE LEGEND OF THE DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND.    The text containing the Legend of the Destruction of Mankind is written in hieroglyphs, and is found on the four walls of a small chamber which is entered from the \"hall of columns\" in the tomb of Seti I., which is situated on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes.  On the wall facing the door of this chamber is painted in red the figure"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9411"],["title","Legends of the Gods (#2)"],["body","the large \"Cow of Heaven.\"  The lower part of her belly is decorated with a series of thirteen stars, and immediately beneath it are the two Boats of Ra, called Semketet and Mantchet, or Sektet and Matet.  Each of her four legs is held in position by two gods, and the god Shu, with outstretched uplifted arms, supports her body.  The Cow was published by Champollion,[FN#5] without the text.  This most important mythological text was first published and translated by Professor E. Naville in 1874.[FN#6]  It was republished by Bergmann[FN#7] and Brugsch,[FN#8] who gave a transcription of the text, with a German translation.  Other German versions by Lauth,[FN#9] Brugsch,[FN#10] and Wiedemann[FN#11] have appeared, and a part of the text was translated into French by Lefebure.[FN#12]  The latest edition of the text was published by Lefebure,[FN#13] and text of a second copy, very much mutilated, was published by Professor Naville, with a French translation in 1885.[FN#14]  The text printed in this volume is that of M. Lefebure.    [FN#5]  Monuments, tom. iii., p. 245.  [FN#6]  Trans. Soc. Bibl. Arch., vol. iv., p. 1 ff.  [FN#7]  Hieroglyphische Inschriften, Bl. 85 fl.

The legend takes us back to the time when the gods of Egypt went about in the country, and mingled with men and were thoroughly acquainted with their desires and needs.  The king who reigned over Egypt was Ra, the Sun-god, who was not, however, the first of the Dynasty of Gods who ruled the land.  His predecessor on the throne was Hephaistos, who, according to Manetho, reigned 9000 years, whilst Ra reigned only 992 years; Panodorus makes his reign to have lasted less than 100 years. Be this as it may, it seems that the \"self-created and self-begotten\" god Ra had been ruling over mankind for a very long time, for his subjects were murmuring against him, and they were complaining that he was old, that his bones were like silver, his body like gold, and his hair like lapis-lazuli.  When Ra heard these murmurings he ordered his bodyguard to summon all the gods who had been with him in the primeval World-ocean, and to bid them privately to assemble in the Great House, which can be no other than the famous temple of Heliopolis.  This statement is interesting, for it proves that the legend is of Heliopolitan origin, like the cult of Ra itself, and that it does not belong, at least in so far as it applies to Ra, to the Predynastic Period.  When Ra entered the Great Temple, the gods made obeisance to him, and took up their positions on each side of him, and informed him that they awaited his words.  Addressing Nu, the personification of the World- ocean, Ra bade them to take notice of the fact that the men and women whom his Eye had created were murmuring against him.  He then asked them to consider the matter and to devise a plan of action for him, for he was unwilling to slay the rebels without hearing what his gods had to say.  In reply the gods advised Ra to send forth his Eye to destroy the blasphemers, for there was no eye on earth that could resist it, especially when it took the form of the goddess Hathor.  Ra accepted their advice and sent forth his Eye in the form of Hathor to destroy them, and, though the rebels had fled to the mountains in fear, the Eye pursued them and overtook them and destroyed them.  Hathor rejoiced in her work of destruction, and on her return was praised by Ra, for what she had done.  The slaughter of men began at Suten-henen (Herakleopolis), and during the night Hathor waded about in the blood of men.  Ra asserted his intention of being master of the rebels, and this is probably referred to in the Book of the Dead, Chapter XVII., in which it is said that Ra rose as king for the first time in Suten- henen.  Osiris also was crowned at Suten-henen, and in this city lived the great Bennu bird, or Phoenix, and the \"Crusher of Bones\" mentioned in the Negative Confession.  The legend now goes on to describe an act of Ra, the significance of which it is difficult to explain.  The god ordered messengers to be brought to him, and when they arrived, he commanded them to run like the wind to Abu, or the city of Elephantine, and to bring him large quantities of the fruit called tataat.  What kind of fruit this was is not clear, but Brugsch thought they were \"mandrakes,\" the so-called \"love-apples,\" and this translation of tataat may be used provisionally.  The mandrakes were given to Sekti, a goddess of Heliopolis, to crush and grind up, and when this was done they were mixed with human blood, and put in a large brewing of beer which the women slaves had made from wheat.  In all they made 7,000 vessels of beer.  When Ra saw the beer he approved of it, and ordered it to be carried up the river to where the goddess Hathor was still, it seems, engaged in slaughtering men.  During the night he caused this beer to be poured out into the meadows of the Four Heavens, and when Hathor came she saw the beer with human blood and mandrakes in it, and drank of it and became drunk, and paid no further attention to men and women. In welcoming the goddess, Ra, called her \"Amit,\" i.e., \"beautiful one,\" and from this time onward \"beautiful women were found in the city of Amit,\" which was situated in the Western Delta, near Lake Mareotis.[FN#15]  Ra also ordered that in future at every one of his festivals vessels of \"sleep-producing beer\" should be made, and that their number should be the same as the number of the handmaidens of Ra. Those who took part in these festivals of Hathor and Ra drank beer in very large quantities, and under the influence of the \"beautiful women,\" i.e., the priestesses, who were supposed to resemble Hathor in their physical attractions, the festal celebrations degenerated into drunken and licentious orgies.    [FN#15]  It was also called the \"City of Apis,\" (Brugsch, Dict. Geog., p. 491), and is the Apis city of classical writers.  It is, perhaps, represented by the modern Kom al-Hisn.    Soon after this Ra complained that he was smitten with pain, and that he was weary of the, children of men.  He thought them a worthless remnant, and wished that more of them had been slain.  The gods about him begged him to endure, and reminded him that his power was in proportion to his will.  Ra was, however, unconsoled, and he complained that his limbs were weak for the first time in his life.  Thereupon the god Nu told Shu to help Ra, and he ordered Nut to take the great god Ra on her back.  Nut changed herself into a cow, and with the help of Shu Ra got on her back. As soon as men saw that Ra was on the back of the Cow of Heaven, and was about to leave them, they became filled with fear and repentance, and cried out to Ra to remain with them and to slay all those who had blasphemed against him.  But the Cow moved on her way, and carried Ra to Het-Ahet, a town of the nome of Mareotis, where in later days the right leg of Osiris was said to be preserved. Meanwhile darkness covered the land.  When day broke the men who had repented of their blasphemies appeared with their bows, and slew the enemies of Ra.  At this result Ra was pleased, and he forgave those who had repented because of their righteous slaughter of his enemies.  From this time onwards human sacrifices were offered up at the festivals of Ra celebrated in this place, and at Heliopolis and in other parts of Egypt.  After these things Ra declared to Nut that he intended to leave this world, and to ascend into heaven, and that all those who would see his face must follow him thither.  Then he went up into heaven and prepared a place to which all might come.  Then he said, \"Hetep sekhet aa,\" i.e., \"Let a great field be produced,\" and straightway \"Sekhet-hetep,\" or the \"Field of peace,\" came into being.  He next said, \"Let there be reeds (aaru) in it,\" and straightway \"Sekhet Aaru,\" or the \"Field of Reeds,\" came into being.  Sekhet-hetep was the Elysian Fields of the Egyptians, and the Field of Reeds was a well-known section of it. Another command of the god Ra resulted in the creation of the stars, which the legend compares to flowers.  Then the goddess Nut trembled in all her body, and Ra, fearing that she might fall, caused to come into being the Four Pillars on which the heavens are supported.  Turning to Shu, Ra entreated him to protect these supports, and to place himself under Nut, and to hold her up in position with his hands.  Thus Shu became the new Sun-god in the place of Ra, and the heavens in which Ra lived were supported and placed beyond the risk of falling, and mankind would live and rejoice in the light of the new sun.  At this place in the legend a text is inserted called the \"Chapter of the Cow.\"  It describes how the Cow of Heaven and the two Boats of the Sun shall be painted, and gives the positions of the gods who stand by the legs of the Cow, and a number of short magical names, or formulae, which are inexplicable.  The general meaning of the picture of the Cow is quite clear.  The Cow represents the sky in which the Boats of Ra, sail, and her four legs are the four cardinal points which cannot be changed.  The region above her back is the heaven in which Ra reigns over the beings who pass thereto from this earth when they die, and here was situated the home of the gods and the celestial spirits who govern this world.  When Ra had made a heaven for himself, and had arranged for a continuance of life on the earth, and the welfare of human beings, he remembered that at one time when reigning on earth he had been bitten by a serpent, and had nearly lost his life through the bite.
