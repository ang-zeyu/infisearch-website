The Queen turned to Shaggy.  \"Which road leads to the Metal Monarch's cavern?\"  \"We don't know, Your Majesty,\" was the reply.  \"But this is absurd!\" said Ann with a frown. \"If we can't get to Ruggedo, it is certain that we can't conquer him.\"  \"You are right,\" admitted Shaggy; \"but I did not say we could not get to him. We have only to discover the way, and that was the matter we were considering when you and your magnificent Army arrived here.\"  \"Well, then, get busy and discover it,\" snapped the Queen.  That was no easy task. They all stood looking from one road to another in perplexity. The paths radiated from the little clearing like the rays of the midday sun, and each path seemed like all the others.  Files and the Rose Princess, who had by this time become good friends, advanced a little way along one of the roads and found that it was bordered by pretty wild flowers.  \"Why don't you ask the flowers to tell you the way?\" he said to his companion.  \"The flowers?\" returned the Princess, surprised at the question.  \"Of course,\" said Files. \"The field-flowers must be second-cousins to a Rose Princess, and I believe if you ask them they will tell you.\"  She looked more closely at the flowers. There were hundreds of white daisies, golden buttercups, bluebells and daffodils growing by the roadside, and each flower-head was firmly set upon its slender but stout stem. There were even a few wild roses scattered here and there and perhaps it was the sight of these that gave the Princess courage to ask the important question.  She dropped to her knees, facing the flowers, and extended both her arms pleadingly toward them.  \"Tell me, pretty cousins,\" she said in her sweet, gentle voice, \"which way will lead us to the Kingdom of Ruggedo, the Nome King?\"  At once all the stems bent gracefully to the right and the flower heads nodded once--twice--thrice in that direction.  \"That's it!\" cried Files joyfully. \"Now we know the way.\"  Ozga rose to her feet and looked wonderingly at the field-flowers, which had now resumed their upright position.  \"Was it the wind, do you think?\" she asked in a low whisper.  \"No, indeed,\" replied Files. \"There is not a breath of wind stirring. But these lovely blossoms are indeed your cousins and answered your question at once, as I knew they would.\"     Chapter Nine  Ruggedo's Rage is Rash and Reckless   The way taken by the adventurers led up hill and down dale and wound here and there in a fashion that seemed aimless. But always it drew nearer to a range of low mountains and Files said more than once that he was certain the entrance to Ruggedo's cavern would be found among these rugged hills.  In this he was quite correct. Far underneath the nearest mountain was a gorgeous chamber hollowed from the solid rock, the walls and roof of which glittered with thousands of magnificent jewels. Here, on a throne of virgin gold, sat the famous Nome King, dressed in splendid robes and wearing a superb crown cut from a single blood-red ruby.  Ruggedo, the Monarch of all the Metals and Precious Stones of the Underground World, was a round little man with a flowing white beard, a red face, bright eyes and a scowl that covered all his forehead. One would think, to look at him, that he ought to be jolly; one might think, considering his enormous wealth, that he ought to be happy; but this was not the case. The Metal Monarch was surly and cross because mortals had dug so much treasure out of the earth and kept it above ground, where all the power of Ruggedo and his nomes was unable to recover it. He hated not only the mortals but also the fairies who live upon the earth or above it, and instead of being content with the riches he still possessed he was unhappy because he did not own all the gold and jewels in the world.  Ruggedo had been nodding, half asleep, in his chair when suddenly he sat upright, uttered a roar of rage and began pounding upon a huge gong that stood beside him.  The sound filled the vast cavern and penetrated to many caverns beyond, where countless thousands of nomes were working at their unending tasks, hammering out gold and silver and other metals, or melting ores in great furnaces, or polishing glittering gems. The nomes trembled at the sound of the King's gong and whispered fearfully to one another that something unpleasant was sure to happen; but none dared pause in his task.  The heavy curtains of cloth-of-gold were pushed aside and Kaliko, the King's High Chamberlain, entered the royal presence.  \"What's up, Your Majesty?\" he asked, with a wide yawn, for he had just wakened.  \"Up?\" roared Ruggedo, stamping his foot viciously. \"Those foolish mortals are up, that's what! And they want to come down.\"  \"Down here?\" inquired Kaliko.  \"Yes!\"  \"How do you know?\" continued the Chamberlain, yawning again.  \"I feel it in my bones,\" said Ruggedo. \"I can always feel it when those hateful earth-crawlers draw near to my Kingdom. I am positive, Kaliko, that mortals are this very minute on their way here to annoy me--and I hate mortals more than I do catnip tea!\"  \"Well, what's to be done?\" demanded the nome.  \"Look through your spyglass, and see where the invaders are,\" commanded the King.  So Kaliko went to a tube in the wall of rock and put his eye to it. The tube ran from the cavern up to the side of the mountain and turned several curves and corners, but as it was a magic spyglass Kaliko was able to see through it just as easily as if it had been straight.  \"Ho--hum,\" said he. \"I see 'em, Your Majesty.\"  \"What do they look like?\" inquired the Monarch.  \"That's a hard question to answer, for a queerer assortment of creatures I never yet beheld,\" replied the nome. \"However, such a collection of curiosities may prove dangerous. There's a copper man, worked by machinery--\"  \"Bah! that's only Tik-Tok,\" said Ruggedo. \"I'm not afraid of him. Why, only the other day I met the fellow and threw him down a well.\"  \"Then some one must have pulled him out again,\" said Kaliko. \"And there's a little girl--\"  \"Dorothy?\" asked Ruggedo, jumping up in fear.  \"No; some other girl. In fact, there are several girls, of various sizes; but Dorothy is not with them, nor is Ozma.\"  \"That's good!\" exclaimed the King, sighing in relief.  Kaliko still had his eye to the spyglass.  \"I see,\" said he, \"an army of men from Oogaboo. They are all officers and carry swords. And there is a Shaggy Man--who seems very harmless--and a little donkey with big ears.\"  \"Pooh!\" cried Ruggedo, snapping his fingers in scorn. \"I've no fear of such a mob as that. A dozen of my nomes can destroy them all in a jiffy.\"  \"I'm not so sure of that,\" said Kaliko. \"The people of Oogaboo are hard to destroy, and I believe the Rose Princess is a fairy. As for Polychrome, you know very well that the Rainbow's Daughter cannot be injured by a nome.\"  \"Polychrome! Is she among them?\" asked the King.  \"Yes; I have just recognized her.\"  \"Then these people are coming here on no peaceful errand,\" declared Ruggedo, scowling fiercely. \"In fact, no one ever comes here on a peaceful errand. I hate everybody, and everybody hates me!\"  \"Very true,\" said Kaliko.  \"I must in some way prevent these people from reaching my dominions. Where are they now?\"  \"Just now they are crossing the Rubber Country, Your Majesty.\"  \"Good! Are your magnetic rubber wires in working order?\"  \"I think so,\" replied Kaliko. \"Is it your Royal Will that we have some fun with these invaders?\"  \"It is,\" answered Ruggedo. \"I want to teach them a lesson they will never forget.\"  Now, Shaggy had no idea that he was in a Rubber Country, nor had any of his companions. They noticed that everything around them was of a dull gray color and that the path upon which they walked was soft and springy, yet they had no suspicion that the rocks and trees were rubber and even the path they trod was made of rubber.  Presently they came to a brook where sparkling water dashed through a deep channel and rushed away between high rocks far down the mountain-side. Across the brook were stepping-stones, so placed that travelers might easily leap from one to another and in that manner cross the water to the farther bank.  Tik-Tok was marching ahead, followed by his officers and Queen Ann. After them came Betsy Bobbin and Hank, Polychrome and Shaggy, and last of all the Rose Princess with Files. The Clockwork Man saw the stream and the stepping-stones and, without making a pause, placed his foot upon the first stone.  The result was astonishing. First he sank down in the soft rubber, which then rebounded and sent Tik-Tok soaring high in the air, where he turned a succession of flip-flops and alighted upon a rubber rock far in the rear of the party.  General Apple did not see Tik-Tok bound, so quickly had he disappeared; therefore he also stepped upon the stone (which you will guess was connected with Kaliko's magnetic rubber wire) and instantly shot upward like an arrow. General Cone came next and met with a like fate, but the others now noticed that something was wrong and with one accord they halted the column and looked back along the path.  There was Tik-Tok, still bounding from one rubber rock to another, each time rising a less distance from the ground. And there was General Apple, bounding away in another direction, his three-cornered hat jammed over his eyes and his long sword thumping him upon the arms and head as it swung this way and that. And there, also, appeared General Cone, who had struck a rubber rock headforemost and was so crumpled up that his round body looked more like a bouncing-ball than the form of a man.  Betsy laughed merrily at the strange sight and Polychrome echoed her laughter. But Ozga was grave and wondering, while Queen Ann"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/957"],["title","The Scarecrow of Oz (#0)"],["body","SCARECROW of OZ   by  L.

They are   big men--all of them--and all with the generous   hearts of little children.    L. Frank Baum      'TWIXT YOU AND ME  The Army of Children which besieged the Postoffice, conquered the Postmen and delivered to me its imperious Commands, insisted that Trot and Cap'n Bill be admitted to the Land of Oz, where Trot could enjoy the society of Dorothy, Betsy Bobbin and Ozma, while the one-legged sailor-man might become a comrade of the Tin Woodman, the Shaggy Man, Tik-Tok and all the other quaint people who inhabit this wonderful fairyland.  It was no easy task to obey this order and land Trot and Cap'n Bill safely in Oz, as you will discover by reading this book. Indeed, it required the best efforts of our dear old friend, the Scarecrow, to save them from a dreadful fate on the journey; but the story leaves them happily located in Ozma's splendid palace and Dorothy has promised me that Button-Bright and the three girls are sure to encounter, in the near future, some marvelous adventures in the Land of Oz, which I hope to be permitted to relate to you in the next Oz Book.  Meantime, I am deeply grateful to my little readers for their continued enthusiasm over the Oz stories, as evinced in the many letters they send me, all of which are lovingly cherished. It takes more and more Oz Books every year to satisfy the demands of old and new readers, and there have been formed many \"Oz Reading Societies,\" where the Oz Books owned by different members are read aloud.  All this is very gratifying to me and encourages me to write more stories. When the children have had enough of them, I hope they will let me know, and then I'll try to write something different.  L.

It's the knowing ones that realize one lifetime ain't long enough to git more'n a few dips o' the oars of knowledge.\"  Trot didn't answer. She was a very little girl, with big, solemn eyes and an earnest, simple manner. Cap'n Bill had been her faithful companion for years and had taught her almost everything she knew.  He was a wonderful man, this Cap'n Bill. Not so very old, although his hair was grizzled--what there was of it. Most of his head was bald as an egg and as shiny as oilcloth, and this made his big ears stick out in a funny way. His eyes had a gentle look and were pale blue in color, and his round face was rugged and bronzed. Cap'n Bill's left leg was missing, from the knee down, and that was why the sailor no longer sailed the seas. The wooden leg he wore was good enough to stump around with on land, or even to take Trot out for a row or a sail on the ocean, but when it came to \"runnin' up aloft\" or performing active duties on shipboard, the old sailor was not equal to the task. The loss of his leg had ruined his career and the old sailor found comfort in devoting himself to the education and companionship of the little girl.  The accident to Cap'n Bill's leg bad happened at about the time Trot was born, and ever since that he had lived with Trot's mother as \"a star boarder,\" having enough money saved up to pay for his weekly \"keep.\"  He loved the baby and often held her on his lap; her first ride was on Cap'n Bill's shoulders, for she had no baby-carriage; and when she began to toddle around, the child and the sailor became close comrades and enjoyed many strange adventures together. It is said the fairies had been present at Trot's birth and had marked her forehead with their invisible mystic signs, so that she was able to see and do many wonderful things.  The acacia tree was on top of a high bluff, but a path ran down the bank in a zigzag way to the water's edge, where Cap'n Bill's boat was moored to a rock by means of a stout cable. It had been a hot, sultry afternoon, with scarcely a breath of air stirring, so Cap'n Bill and Trot had been quietly sitting beneath the shade of the tree, waiting for the sun to get low enough for them to take a row.  They had decided to visit one of the great caves which the waves had washed out of the rocky coast during many years of steady effort. The caves were a source of continual delight to both the girl and the sailor, who loved to explore their awesome depths.  \"I b'lieve, Cap'n,\" remarked Trot, at last, \"that it's time for us to start.\"  The old man cast a shrewd glance at the sky, the sea and the motionless boat. Then he shook his head.  \"Mebbe it's time, Trot,\" he answered, \"but I don't jes' like the looks o' things this afternoon.\"  \"What's wrong?\" she asked wonderingly.  \"Can't say as to that. Things is too quiet to suit me, that's all. No breeze, not a ripple a-top the water, nary a gull a-flyin' anywhere, an' the end o' the hottest day o' the year. I ain't no weather-prophet, Trot, but any sailor would know the signs is ominous.\"  \"There's nothing wrong that I can see,\" said Trot.  \"If there was a cloud in the sky even as big as my thumb, we might worry about it; but--look, Cap'n!--the sky is as clear as can be.\"  He looked again and nodded.  \"P'r'aps we can make the cave, all right,\" he agreed, not wishing to disappoint her.  \"It's only a little way out, an' we'll be on the watch; so come along, Trot.\"  Together they descended the winding path to the beach. It was no trouble for the girl to keep her footing on the steep way, but Cap'n Bill, because of his wooden leg, had to hold on to rocks and roots now and then to save himself from tumbling. On a level path he was as spry as anyone, but to climb up hill or down required some care.  They reached the boat safely and while Trot was untying the rope Cap'n Bill reached into a crevice of the rock and drew out several tallow candles and a box of wax matches, which he thrust into the capacious pockets of his \"sou'wester.\"  This sou'wester was a short coat of oilskin which the old sailor wore on all occasions--when he wore a coat at all--and the pockets always contained a variety of objects, useful and ornamental, which made even Trot wonder where they all came from and why Cap'n Bill should treasure them. The jackknives--a big one and a little one--the bits of cord, the fishhooks, the nails: these were handy to have on certain occasions. But bits of shell, and tin boxes with unknown contents, buttons, pincers, bottles of curious stones and the like, seemed quite unnecessary to carry around. That was Cap'n Bill's business, however, and now that he added the candles and the matches to his collection Trot made no comment, for she knew these last were to light their way through the caves. The sailor always rowed the boat, for he handled the oars with strength and skill. Trot sat in the stern and steered. The place where they embarked was a little bight or circular bay, and the boat cut across a much larger bay toward a distant headland where the caves were located, right at the water's edge. They were nearly a mile from shore and about halfway across the bay when Trot suddenly sat up straight and exclaimed: \"What's that, Cap'n?\"  He stopped rowing and turned half around to look.  \"That, Trot,\" he slowly replied, \"looks to me mighty like a whirlpool.\"  \"What makes it, Cap'n?\"  \"A whirl in the air makes the whirl in the water. I was afraid as we'd meet with trouble, Trot. Things didn't look right. The air was too still.\"  \"It's coming closer,\" said the girl.  The old man grabbed the oars and began rowing with all his strength.  \"'Tain't comin' closer to us, Trot,\" he gasped; \"it's we that are comin' closer to the whirlpool. The thing is drawin' us to it like a magnet!\"  Trot's sun-bronzed face was a little paler as she grasped the tiller firmly and tried to steer the boat away; but she said not a word to indicate fear.  The swirl of the water as they came nearer made a roaring sound that was fearful to listen to. So fierce and powerful was the whirlpool that it drew the surface of the sea into the form of a great basin, slanting downward toward the center, where a big hole had been made in the ocean--a hole with walls of water that were kept in place by the rapid whirling of the air.  The boat in which Trot and Cap'n Bill were riding was just on the outer edge of this "]]]
