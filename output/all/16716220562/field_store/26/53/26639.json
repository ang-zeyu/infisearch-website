There isn't a person in the Land of Oz who would steal a single thing she owns.\"  \"Huh!\" replied the Patchwork Girl.  \"You don't know ev'ry person in the Land of Oz.\"  \"Why don't I?\"  \"It's a big country,\" said Scraps.  \"There are cracks and corners in it that even Ozma doesn't know of.\"  \"The Patchwork Girl's just daffy,\" declared Betsy.  \"No, she's right about that,\" replied Dorothy thoughtfully.  \"There are lots of queer people in this fairyland who never come near Ozma or the Em'rald City.  I've seen some of 'em myself, girls.  But I haven't seen all, of course, and there MIGHT be some wicked persons left in Oz yet, though I think the wicked witches have all been destroyed.\"  Just then the Wooden Sawhorse dashed into the courtyard with the Wizard of Oz on his back.  \"Have you found Ozma?\" cried the Wizard when the Sawhorse stopped beside them.  \"Not yet,\" said Dorothy.  \"Doesn't Glinda the Good know where she is?\"  \"No.  Glinda's Book of Records and all her magic instruments are gone. Someone must have stolen them.\"  \"Goodness me!\" exclaimed Dorothy in alarm.  \"This is the biggest steal I ever heard of.  Who do you think did it, Wizard?\"  \"I've no idea,\" he answered.  \"But I have come to get my own bag of magic tools and carry them to Glinda.  She is so much more powerful than I that she may be able to discover the truth by means of my magic quicker and better than I could myself.\"  \"Hurry, then,\" said Dorothy, \"for we've all gotten terr'bly worried.\"  The Wizard rushed away to his rooms but presently came back with a long, sad face.  \"It's gone!\" he said.  \"What's gone?\" asked Scraps.  \"My black bag of magic tools. Someone must have stolen it!\"  They looked at one another in amazement.  \"This thing is getting desperate,\" continued the Wizard. \"All the magic that belongs to Ozma or to Glinda or to me has been stolen.\"  \"Do you suppose Ozma could have taken them, herself, for some purpose?\" asked Betsy.  \"No indeed,\" declared the Wizard.  \"I suspect some enemy has stolen Ozma and for fear we would follow and recapture her has taken all our magic away from us.\"  \"How dreadful!\" cried Dorothy. \"The idea of anyone wanting to injure our dear Ozma!  Can't we do ANYthing to find her, Wizard?\"  \"I'll ask Glinda.  I must go straight back to her and tell her that my magic tools have also disappeared.  The good Sorceress will be greatly shocked, I know.\"  With this, he jumped upon the back of the Sawhorse again, and the quaint steed, which never tired, dashed away at full speed.  The three girls were very much disturbed in mind.  Even the Patchwork Girl seemed to realize that a great calamity had overtaken them all.  Ozma was a fairy of considerable power, and all the creatures in Oz as well as the three mortal girls from the outside world looked upon her as their protector and friend.  The idea of their beautiful girl Ruler's being overpowered by an enemy and dragged from her splendid palace a captive was too astonishing for them to comprehend at first.  Yet what other explanation of the mystery could there be?  \"Ozma wouldn't go away willingly, without letting us know about it,\" asserted Dorothy, \"and she wouldn't steal Glinda's Great Book of Records or the Wizard's magic, 'cause she could get them any time just by asking for 'em.  I'm sure some wicked person has done all this.\"  \"Someone in the Land of Oz?\" asked Trot.  \"Of course.  No one could get across the Deadly Desert, you know, and no one but an Oz person could know about the Magic Picture and the Book of Records and the Wizard's magic or where they were kept, and so be able to steal the whole outfit before we could stop 'em.  It MUST be someone who lives in the Land of Oz.\"  \"But who--who--who?\" asked Scraps.  \"That's the question.  Who?\"  \"If we knew,\" replied Dorothy severely, \"we wouldn't be standing here doing nothing.\"  Just then two boys entered the courtyard and approached the group of girls.  One boy was dressed in the fantastic Munchkin costume--a blue jacket and knickerbockers, blue leather shoes and a blue hat with a high peak and tiny silver bells dangling from its rim--and this was Ojo the Lucky, who had once come from the Munchkin Country of Oz and now lived in the Emerald City.  The other boy was an American from Philadelphia and had lately found his way to Oz in the company of Trot and Cap'n Bill.  His name was Button-Bright; that is, everyone called him by that name and knew no other.  Button-Bright was not quite as big as the Munchkin boy, but he wore the same kind of clothes, only they were of different colors.  As the two came up to the girls, arm in arm, Button-Bright remarked, \"Hello, Dorothy.  They say Ozma is lost.\"  \"WHO says so?\" she asked.  \"Ev'rybody's talking about it in the City,\" he replied.  \"I wonder how the people found it out,\" Dorothy asked.  \"I know,\" said Ojo.  \"Jellia Jamb told them. She has been asking everywhere if anyone has seen Ozma.\"  \"That's too bad,\" observed Dorothy, frowning.  \"Why?\" asked Button-Bright.  \"There wasn't any use making all our people unhappy till we were dead certain that Ozma can't be found.\"  \"Pshaw,\" said Button-Bright, \"it's nothing to get lost.  I've been lost lots of times.\"  \"That's true,\" admitted Trot, who knew that the boy had a habit of getting lost and then finding himself again, \"but it's diff'rent with Ozma.  She's the Ruler of all this big fairyland, and we're 'fraid that the reason she's lost is because somebody has stolen her away.\"  \"Only wicked people steal,\" said Ojo.  \"Do you know of any wicked people in Oz, Dorothy?\"  \"No,\" she replied.  \"They're here, though,\" cried Scraps, dancing up to them and then circling around the group.  \"Ozma's stolen; someone in Oz stole her; only wicked people steal; so someone in Oz is wicked!\"  There was no denying the truth of this statement.  The faces of all of them were now solemn and sorrowful.  \"One thing is sure,\" said Button-Bright after a time, \"if Ozma has been stolen, someone ought to find her and punish the thief.\"  \"There may be a lot of thieves,\" suggested Trot gravely, \"and in this fairy country they don't seem to have any soldiers or policemen.\"  \"There is one soldier,\" claimed Dorothy.  \"He has green whiskers and a gun and is a Major-General, but no one is afraid of either his gun or his whiskers, 'cause he's so tender-hearted that he wouldn't hurt a fly.\"   \"Well, a soldier is a soldier,\" said Betsy, \"and perhaps he'd hurt a wicked thief if he wouldn't hurt a fly.  Where is he?\"  \"He went fishing about two months ago and hasn't come back yet,\" explained Button-Bright.  \"Then I can't see that he will be of much use to us in this trouble,\" sighed little Trot.  \"But p'raps Ozma, who is a fairy, can get away from the thieves without any help from anyone.\"  \"She MIGHT be able to,\" answered Dorothy reflectively, \"but if she had the power to do that, it isn't likely she'd have let herself be stolen. So the thieves must have been even more powerful in magic than our Ozma.\"  There was no denying this argument, and although they talked the matter over all the rest of that day, they were unable to decide how Ozma had been stolen against her will or who had committed the dreadful deed. Toward evening the Wizard came back, riding slowly upon the Sawhorse because he felt discouraged and perplexed.  Glinda came later in her aerial chariot drawn by twenty milk-white swans, and she also seemed worried and unhappy.  More of Ozma's friends joined them, and that evening they all had a big talk together.  \"I think,\" said Dorothy, \"we ought to start out right away in search of our dear Ozma.  It seems cruel for us to live comf'tably in her palace while she is a pris'ner in the power of some wicked enemy.\"  \"Yes,\" agreed Glinda the Sorceress, \"someone ought to search for her. I cannot go myself, because I must work hard in order to create some new instruments of sorcery by means of which I may rescue our fair Ruler. But if you can find her in the meantime and let me know who has stolen her, it will enable me to rescue her much more quickly.\"  \"Then we'll start tomorrow morning,\" decided Dorothy.  \"Betsy and Trot and I won't waste another minute.\"  \"I'm not sure you girls will make good detectives,\" remarked the Wizard, \"but I'll go with you to protect you from harm and to give you my advice.  All my wizardry, alas, is stolen, so I am now really no more a wizard than any of you, but I will try to protect you from any enemies you may meet.\"  \"What harm could happen to us in Oz?\" inquired Trot.  \"What harm happened to Ozma?\" returned the Wizard.  \"If there is an Evil Power abroad in our fairyland, which is able to steal not only Ozma and her Magic Picture, but Glinda's Book of Records and all her magic, and my black bag containing all my tricks of wizardry, then that Evil Power may yet cause us considerable injury. Ozma is a fairy, and so is Glinda, so no power can kill or destroy them, but you girls are all mortals and so are Button-Bright and I, so we must watch out for ourselves.\"  \"Nothing can kill me,\" said Ojo the Munchkin boy.  \"That is true,\" replied the Sorceress, \"and I think it may be well to divide the searchers into several parties, that they may cover all the land of Oz more quickly.  So I will send Ojo and Unc Nunkie and Dr. Pipt into the Munchkin Country, which they are well acquainted with; and I will send the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman into the Quadling Country, for they are fearless and brave and never tire; and to the Gillikin Country, where many dangers lurk, I will send the Shaggy Man and his brother, with Tik-Tok and Jack Pumpkinhead.  Dorothy may make up her own"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/959"],["title","The Lost Princess of Oz (#5)"],["body","and travel into the Winkie Country.  All of you must inquire everywhere for Ozma and try to discover where she is hidden.\"  They thought this a very wise plan and adopted it without question. In Ozma's absence, Glinda the Good was the most important person in Oz, and all were glad to serve under her direction.     CHAPTER 6  THE SEARCH PARTY   Next morning as soon as the sun was up, Glinda flew back to her castle, stopping on the way to instruct the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, who were at that time staying at the college of Professor H. M. Wogglebug, T.E., and taking a course of his Patent Educational Pills.  On hearing of Ozma's loss, they started at once for the Quadling Country to search for her.  As soon as Glinda had left the Emerald City, Tik-Tok and the Shaggy Man and Jack Pumpkinhead, who had been present at the conference, began their journey into the Gillikin Country, and an hour later Ojo and Unc Nunkie joined Dr.  Pipt and together they traveled toward the Munchkin Country.  When all these searchers were gone, Dorothy and the Wizard completed their own preparations.  The Wizard hitched the Sawhorse to the Red Wagon, which would seat four very comfortably.  He wanted Dorothy, Betsy, Trot and the Patchwork Girl to ride in the wagon, but Scraps came up to them mounted upon the Woozy, and the Woozy said he would like to join the party.  Now this Woozy was a most peculiar animal, having a square head, square body, square legs and square tail.  His skin was very tough and hard, resembling leather, and while his movements were somewhat clumsy, the beast could travel with remarkable swiftness. His square eyes were mild and gentle in expression, and he was not especially foolish.  The Woozy and the Patchwork Girl were great friends, and so the Wizard agreed to let the Woozy go with them.  Another great beast now appeared and asked to go along.  This was none other than the famous Cowardly Lion, one of the most interesting creatures in all Oz.  No lion that roamed the jungles or plains could compare in size or intelligence with this Cowardly Lion, who--like all animals living in Oz--could talk and who talked with more shrewdness and wisdom than many of the people did.  He said he was cowardly because he always trembled when he faced danger, but he had faced danger many times and never refused to fight when it was necessary. This Lion was a great favorite with Ozma and always guarded her throne on state occasions.  He was also an old companion and friend of the Princess Dorothy, so the girl was delighted to have him join the party.  \"I'm so nervous over our dear Ozma,\" said the Cowardly Lion in his deep, rumbling voice, \"that it would make me unhappy to remain behind while you are trying to find her.  But do not get into any danger, I beg of you, for danger frightens me terribly.\"  \"We'll not get into danger if we can poss'bly help it,\" promised Dorothy, \"but we shall do anything to find Ozma, danger or no danger.\"  The addition of the Woozy and the Cowardly Lion to the party gave Betsy Bobbin an idea, and she ran to the marble stables at the rear of the palace and brought out her mule, Hank by name.  Perhaps no mule you ever saw was so lean and bony and altogether plain looking as this Hank, but Betsy loved him dearly because he was faithful and steady and not nearly so stupid as most mules are considered to be.  Betsy had a saddle for Hank, and he declared she would ride on his back, an arrangement approved by the Wizard because it left only four of the party to ride on the seats of the Red Wagon--Dorothy and Button-Bright and Trot and himself.  An old sailor man who had one wooden leg came to see them off and suggested that they put a supply of food and blankets in the Red Wagon inasmuch as they were uncertain how long they would be gone.  This sailor man was called Cap'n Bill.  He was a former friend and comrade of Trot and had encountered many adventures in company with the little girl.  I think he was sorry he could not go with her on this trip, but Glinda the Sorceress had asked Cap'n Bill to remain in the Emerald City and take charge of the royal palace while everyone else was away, and the one-legged sailor had agreed to do so.  They loaded the back end of the Red Wagon with everything they thought they might need, and then they formed a procession and marched from the palace through the Emerald City to the great gates of the wall that surrounded this beautiful capital of the Land of Oz.  Crowds of citizens lined the streets to see them pass and to cheer them and wish them success, for all were grieved over Ozma's loss and anxious that she be found again.  First came the Cowardly Lion, then the Patchwork Girl riding upon the Woozy, then Betsy Bobbin on her mule Hank, and finally the Sawhorse drawing the Red Wagon, in which were seated the Wizard and Dorothy and Button-Bright and Trot.  No one was obliged to drive the Sawhorse, so there were no reins to his harness; one had only to tell him which way to go, fast or slow, and he understood perfectly.  It was about this time that a shaggy little black dog who had been lying asleep in Dorothy's room in the palace woke up and discovered he was lonesome.  Everything seemed very still throughout the great building, and Toto--that was the little dog's name--missed the customary chatter of the three girls.  He never paid much attention to what was going on around him, and although he could speak, he seldom said anything, so the little dog did not know about Ozma's loss or that everyone had gone in search of her.  But he liked to be with people, and especially with his own mistress, Dorothy, and having yawned and stretched himself and found the door of the room ajar, he trotted out into the corridor and went down the stately marble stairs to the hall of the palace, where he met Jellia Jamb.  \"Where's Dorothy?\" asked Toto.  \"She's gone to the Winkie Country,\" answered the maid.  \"When?\"  \"A little while ago,\" replied Jellia.  Toto turned and trotted out into the palace garden and down the long driveway until he came to the streets of the Emerald City.  Here he paused to listen, and hearing sounds of cheering, he ran swiftly along until he came in sight of the Red Wagon and the Woozy and the Lion and the Mule and all the others.  Being a wise little dog, he decided not to show himself to Dorothy just then, lest he be sent back home, but he never lost sight of the party of travelers, all of whom were so eager to get ahead that they never thought to look behind them.  When they came to the gates in the city wall, the Guardian of the Gates came out to throw wide the golden portals and let them pass through.  \"Did any strange person come in or out of the city on the night before last when Ozma was stolen?\" asked Dorothy.  \"No indeed, Princess,\" answered the Guardian of the Gates.  \"Of course not,\" said the Wizard. \"Anyone clever enough to steal all the things we have lost would not mind the barrier of a wall like this in the least.  I think the thief must have flown through the air, for otherwise he could not have stolen from Ozma's royal palace and Glinda's faraway castle in the same night.  Moreover, as there are no airships in Oz and no way for airships from the outside world to get into this country, I believe the thief must have flown from place to place by means of magic arts which neither Glinda nor I understand.\"  On they went, and before the gates closed behind them, Toto managed to dodge through them.  The country surrounding the Emerald City was thickly settled, and for a while our friends rode over nicely paved roads which wound through a fertile country dotted with beautiful houses, all built in the quaint Oz fashion.  In the course of a few hours, however, they had left the tilled fields and entered the Country of the Winkies, which occupies a quarter of all the territory in the Land of Oz but is not so well known as many other parts of Ozma's fairyland.  Long before night the travelers had crossed the Winkie River near to the Scarecrow's Tower (which was now vacant) and had entered the Rolling Prairie where few people live.  They asked everyone they met for news of Ozma, but none in this district had seen her or even knew that she had been stolen.  And by nightfall they had passed all the farmhouses and were obliged to stop and ask for shelter at the hut of a lonely shepherd.  When they halted, Toto was not far behind. The little dog halted, too, and stealing softly around the party, he hid himself behind the hut.  The shepherd was a kindly old man and treated the travelers with much courtesy.  He slept out of doors that night, giving up his hut to the three girls, who made their beds on the floor with the blankets they had brought in the Red Wagon.  The Wizard and Button-Bright also slept out of doors, and so did the Cowardly Lion and Hank the Mule.  But Scraps and the Sawhorse did not sleep at all, and the Woozy could stay awake for a month at a time if he wished to, so these three sat in a little group by themselves and talked together all through the night.  In the darkness, the Cowardly Lion felt a shaggy little form nestling beside his own, and he said sleepily, \"Where did you come from, Toto?\"  \"From home,\" said the dog. \"If you roll over, roll the other way so you won't smash me.\"  \"Does Dorothy know you are here?\" asked the Lion.  \"I believe not,\" admitted Toto, and he added a little anxiously, \"Do you think, friend Lion, we are now far enough from the Emerald City for me to risk showing myself, or will Dorothy send me back because I wasn't invited?\"  \"Only Dorothy can answer that question,\" said the Lion.  \"For my part, Toto, I consider this affair none of my business, so you must act as you think best.\"  Then the huge beast went to sleep again, and Toto snuggled closer to the warm, hairy body and also slept.  He was a wise little dog in his way, and didn't intend to worry when there was something much better to do.  In the morning"]]]
