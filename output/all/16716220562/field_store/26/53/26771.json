They had the said bitch with them again, but were not by that protected; the bitch set up a very piteous cry; the clothes of their beds were all pulled off, and the bricks, without any wind, were thrown off the chimney tops into the midst.  “October 24. The candles put out as before. They thought all the wood of the King’s Oak was violently thrown down by their bedsides; they counted sixty-four fagots that fell with great violence, and some hit and shook the bed,—but in the morning none were found there, nor the door of the room opened in which the said fagots were.  “October 25. The candles put out as before. The curtains of the bed in the drawing-room were many times forcibly drawn; the wood thrown out as before; a terrible crack like thunder was heard; and one of the servants, running to see if his master was not killed, found at his return, three dozen trenchers laid smoothly upon his bed under the quilt.  “October 26. The beds were shaken as before; the windows seemed all broken to pieces, and glass fell in vast quantities all about the room. In the morning they found the windows all whole, but the floor strewed with broken glass, which they gathered and laid by.  “October 29. At midnight candles went out as before, something walked majestically through the room and opened and shut the window; great stones were thrown violently into the room, some whereof fell on the beds, others on the floor; and about a quarter after one, a noise was heard as of forty cannon discharged together, and again repeated at about eight minutes’ distance. This alarmed and raised all the neighbourhood, who, coming into their honours’ room, gathered up the great stones, fourscore in number, many of them like common pebbles and boulters, and laid them by, where they are to be seen to this day, at a corner of the adjoining field. This noise, like the discharge of cannon, was heard throughout the country for sixteen miles round. During these noises, which were heard in both rooms together, both the Commissioners and their servants gave one another over for lost, and cried out for help; and Giles Sharp, snatching up a sword, had well-nigh killed one of their honours, taking him for the spirit as he came in his shirt into the room. While they were together, the noise was continued, and part of the tiling of the house, and all the windows of an upper room, were taken away with it.  “October 30. Something walked into the chamber, treading like a bear; it walked many times about, then threw the warming-pan violently upon the floor, and so bruised it, that it was spoiled. Vast quantities of glass were now thrown about the room, and vast numbers of great stones and horses’ bones were thrown in; these were all found in the morning, and the floors, beds, and walls were all much damaged by the violence they were thrown in.  “November 1. Candles were placed in all parts of the room, and a great fire made. At midnight, the candles all yet burning, a noise like the burst of a cannon was heard in the room, and the burning billets were tossed all over the room and about the beds; and had not their honours called in Giles and his fellows, the house had assuredly been burnt. An hour after the candles went out, as usual, the clack of many cannon was heard, and many pailfuls of green stinking water were thrown on their honours in bed; great stones were also thrown in as before, the bed-curtains and bedsteads torn and broken: the windows were now all really broken, and the whole neighbourhood alarmed with the noises; nay, the very rabbit-stealers that were abroad that night in the warren, were so frightened at the dismal thundering, that they fled for fear and left their ferrets behind them.  “One of their honours this night spoke, and in the name of God asked what it was, and why it disturbed them so? No answer was given to this; but the noise ceased for a while, when the spirit came again, and as they all agreed, brought with it seven devils worse than itself. One of the servants now lighted a large candle, and set it in the doorway between the two chambers, to see what passed; and as he[1] watched it, he plainly saw a hoof striking the candle and candlestick into the middle of the room, and afterwards, making three scrapes over the snuff of the candle, to scrape it out. Upon this, the same person was so bold as to draw a sword; but he had scarce got it out, when he perceived another invisible hand had hold of it too, and pulled with him for it, and at last prevailing, struck him so violently on the head with the pommel, that he fell down for dead with the blow. At this instant was heard another burst like the discharge of the broadside of a ship of war, and at about a minute or two’s distance each, no less than nineteen more such: these shook the house so violently that they expected every moment it would fall upon their heads. The neighbours on this were all alarmed, and, running to the house, they all joined in prayer and psalm-singing, during which the noise continued in the other rooms, and the discharge of cannon without, though nobody was there.”   [1] Probably this part was also played by Sharp, who was the regular  ghost-seer of the party.   Dr. Plot concludes his relation of this memorable event[2] with observing, that, though tricks have often been played in affairs of this kind, many of these things are not reconcilable with juggling; such as, 1st, The loud noises beyond the power of man to make, without instruments which were not there; 2d, The tearing and breaking of the beds; 3d, The throwing about the fire; 4th, The hoof treading out the candle; and, 5th, The striving for the sword, and the blow the man received from the pommel of it.   [2] In his Natural History of Oxfordshire.   To shew how great men are sometimes deceived, we may recur to a tract, entitled “_The Secret History of the Good Devil of Woodstock_,” in which we find it, under the author’s own hand, that he, Joseph Collins, commonly called Funny Joe, was himself this very devil;—that, under the feigned name of Giles Sharp, he hired himself as a servant to the Commissioners;—that by the help of two friends—an unknown trapdoor in the ceiling of the bedchamber, and a pound of common gunpowder—he played all these extraordinary tricks by himself;—that his fellow-servants, whom he had introduced on purpose to assist him, had lifted up their own beds; and that the candles were contrived, by a common trick of gunpowder, to be extinguished at a certain time.  The dog who began the farce was, as Joe swore, no dog at all, but truly a bitch, who had shortly before whelped in that room, and made all this disturbance in seeking for her puppies; and which, when she had served his purpose, he (Joe Sharp, or Collins) let out, and then looked for. The story of the hoof and sword he himself bore witness to, and was never suspected as to the truth of them, though mere fictions. By the trapdoor his friends let down stones, fagots, glass, water, etc., which they either left there, or drew up again, as best suited his purpose; and by this way let themselves in and out, without opening the doors, or going through the keyholes, and all the noises, described, he declares he made by placing quantities of white gunpowder over pieces of burning charcoal, on plates of tin, which, as they melted, exploded with a violent noise.  I am very happy in having an opportunity of setting history right about these remarkable events, and would not have the reader disbelieve my author’s account of them, from his naming either white gunpowder exploding when melted, or his making the earth about the pot take fire of its own accord; since, however improbable these accounts may appear to some readers, and whatever secrets they might be in Joe’s time, they are now well known in chemistry. As to the last, there needs only to mix an equal quantity of iron filings, finely powdered, and powder of pure brimstone, and make them into a paste with fair water. This paste, when it hath lain together about twenty-six hours, will of itself take fire, and burn all the sulphur away with a blue flame and a bad smell. For the others, what he calls white gunpowder, is plainly the thundering powder called by our chemists _pulvis fulminans_. It is composed of three parts of saltpetre, two parts of pearl ashes or salt of tartar, and one part of flower of brimstone, mixed together and beat to a fine powder; a small quantity of this held on the point of a knife over a candle, will not go off till it melt, and then it gives a report like that of a pistol; and this he might easily dispose of in larger quantities, so as to make it explode of itself, while he, the said Joe, was with his masters.  Such is the explanation of the ghostly adventures of Woodstock, as transferred by Mr. Hone from the pages of the old tract, termed the Authentic Memoirs of the memorable Joseph Collins of Oxford, whose courage and loyalty were the only wizards which conjured up those strange and surprising apparitions and works of spirits, which passed as so unquestionable in the eyes of the Parliamentary Commissioners, of Dr. Plot, and other authors of credit. The _pulvis fulminans_, the secret principle he made use of, is now known to every apothecary’s apprentice.  If my memory be not treacherous, the actor of these wonders made use of his skill in fireworks upon the following remarkable occasion. The Commissioners had not, in their zeal for the public service, overlooked their own private interests, and a deed was drawn up upon parchment, recording the share and nature of the advantages which they privately agreed to concede to each other; at the same time they were, it seems, loath to intrust to any one of their number the keeping of a document in which all were equally concerned.  They hid the written agreement within a flower-pot, in which a shrub concealed it from the eyes of any chance spectator. But the rumour of the apparitions having gone abroad,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9785"],["title","Woodstock; or, the Cavalier (#2)"],["body","drew many of the neighbours to Woodstock, and some in particular, to whom the knowledge of this agreement would have afforded matter of scandel; as the Commissioners received these guests in the saloon where the flower-pot was placed, a match was suddenly set to some fireworks placed there by Sharp the secretary. The flower-pot burst to pieces with the concussion, or was prepared so as to explode of itself, and the contract of the Commissioners, bearing testimony to their private roguery, was thrown into the midst of the visiters assembled. If I have recollected this incident accurately, for it is more than forty years since I perused the tract, it is probable, that in omitting it from the novel, I may also have passed over, from want of memory, other matters which might have made an essential addition to the story. Nothing, indeed, is more certain, than that incidents which are real, preserve an infinite advantage in works of this nature over such as are fictitious. The tree, however, must remain where it has fallen.  Having occasion to be in London in October 1831, I made some researches in the British Museum, and in that rich collection, with the kind assistance of the Keepers, who manage it with so much credit to themselves and advantage to the public, I recovered two original pamphlets, which contain a full account of the phenomena at Woodstock in 1649.[3] The first is a satirical poem, published in that year, which plainly shews that the legend was current among the people in the very shape in which it was afterwards made public. I have not found the explanation of Joe Collins, which, as mentioned by Mr. Hone, resolves the whole into confederacy. It might, however, be recovered by a stricter search than I had leisure for. In the meantime, it may be observed, that neither the name of Joe Collins, nor Sharp, occurs among the _dramatis personæ_ given in these tracts, published when he might have been endangered by any thing which directed suspicion towards him, at least in 1649, and perhaps might have exposed him to danger even in 1660, from the malice of a powerful though defeated faction.

THE WOODSTOCK SCUFFLE;  or, Most dreadfull apparitions that were lately seene in the Mannor-house of Woodstock, neere Oxford, to the great terror and the wonderful amazement of all there that did behold them.   It were a wonder if one unites, And not of wonders and strange sights; For ev’ry where such things affrights           Poore people,   That men are ev’n at their wits’ end; God judgments ev’ry where doth send, And yet we don’t our lives amend,           But tipple,   And sweare, and lie, and cheat, and—, Because the world shall drown no more, As if no judgments were in store           But water;   But by the stories which I tell, You’ll heare of terrors come from hell, And fires, and shapes most terrible           For matter.   It is not long since that a child Spake from the ground in a large field, And made the people almost wild           That heard it,   Of which there is a printed book, Wherein each man the truth may look, If children speak, the matter’s took           For verdict.   But this is stranger than that voice, The wonder’s greater, and the noyse; And things appeare to men, not boyes,           At _Woodstock_;   Where _Rosamond_ had once a bower, To keep her from Queen _Elinour_, And had escap’d her poys’nous power           By good-luck,   But fate had otherwise decreed, And _Woodstock_ Manner saw a deed, Which is in _Hollinshed_ or _Speed_           Chro-nicled;   But neither _Hollinshed_ nor _Stow_, Nor no historians such things show, Though in them wonders we well know           Are pickled;   For nothing else is history But pickle of antiquity, Where things are kept in memory           From stinking;   Which otherwise would have lain dead, As in oblivion buried, Which now you may call into head           With thinking.   The dreadfull story, which is true, And now committed unto view, By better pen, had it its due,           Should see light.   But I, contented, do indite, Not things of wit, but things of right; You can’t expect that things that fright           Should delight.   O hearken, therefore, hark and shake! My very pen and hand doth quake! While I the true relation make           O’ th’ wonder,   Which hath long time, and still appeares Unto the State’s Commissioners, And puts them in their beds to feares           From under.   They come, good men, imploi’d by th’ State To sell the lands of Charles the late. And there they lay, and long did waite           For chapmen.   You may have easy pen’worths, woods, Lands, ven’son, householdstuf, and goods, They little thought of dogs that wou’d           There snap-men.   But when they’d sup’d, and fully fed, They set up remnants and to bed. Where scarce they had laid down a head           To slumber,   But that their beds were heav’d on high; They thought some dog under did lie, And meant i’ th’ chamber (fie, fie, fie)           To scumber.   Some thought the cunning cur did mean To eat their mutton (which was lean) Reserv’d for breakfast, for the men           Were thrifty.   And up one rises in his shirt, Intending the slie cur to hurt, And forty thrusts made at him for’t,           Or fifty.   But empty came his sword again. He found he thrust but all in vain; An the mutton safe, hee went amain           To’s fellow.   And now (assured all was well) The bed again began to swell, The men were frighted, and did smell           O’ th’ yellow.   From heaving, now the cloaths it pluckt The men, for feare, together stuck, And in their sweat each other duck’t.           They wished   A thousand times that it were day; ’Tis sure the divell! Let us pray. They pray’d amain; and, as they say, —— ——   Approach of day did cleere the doubt, For all devotions were run out, They now waxt strong and something stout,           One peaked   Under the bed, but nought was there; He view’d the chamber ev’ry where, Nothing apear’d but what, for feare. vThey leaked.   Their stomachs then return’d apace, They found the mutton in the place, And fell unto it with a grace.           They laughed   Each at the other’s pannick feare, And each his bed-fellow did jeere, And having sent for ale and beere,           They quaffed.   And then abroad the summons went, Who’ll buy king’s-land o’ th’ Parliament? A paper-book contein’d the rent,           Which lay there;   That did contein the severall farmes, Quit-rents, knight services, and armes; But that they came not in by swarmes           To pay there.   Night doth invite to bed again, The grand Commissioners were lain, But then the thing did heave amain,           It busled,   And with great clamor fil’d their eares, The noyse was doubled, and their feares; Nothing was standing but their haires,           They nuzled.   Oft were the blankets pul’d, the sheete Was closely twin’d betwixt their feete, It seems the spirit was discreete           And civill.   Which makes the poore Commissioners Feare they shall get but small arreares, And that there’s yet for cavaliers           One divell.   They cast about what best to doe; Next day they would to wisemen goe, To neighb’ring towns some cours to know;           For schollars   Come not to Woodstock, as before, And Allen’s dead as a nayle-doore, And so’s old John (eclep’d the poore)           His follower;   Rake Oxford o’re, there’s not a man That rayse or lay a spirit can, Or use the circle, or the wand,           Or conjure;   Or can say (Boh!) unto a divell, Or to a goose that is uncivill, Nor where Keimbolton purg’d out evill,           ’Tis sin sure.   There were two villages hard by, With teachers of presbytery, Who knew the house was hidiously           Be-pestred;   But ’lasse! their new divinity Is not so deep, or not so high; Their witts doe (as their meanes did) lie           Sequestred;   But Master Joffman was the wight Which was to exorcise the spright; Hee’ll preach and pray you day and night           At pleasure.   And by that painfull gainfull trade, He hath himselfe full wealthy made; Great store of guilt he hath, ’tis said,           And treasure.   But no intreaty of his friends Could get him to the house of fiends, He came not over for such ends           From Dutch-land,   But worse divinity hee brought, And hath us reformation taught, And, with our money, he hath bought           Him much land.   Had the old parsons preached still, The div’l should nev’r have had his wil; But those that had or art or skill           Are outed;   And those to whom the pow’r was giv’n Of driving spirits, are out-driv’n; Their colledges dispos’d, and livings,           To grout-heads.   There was a justice who did boast, Hee had as great a gift almost, Who did desire him to accost           This evill.   But hee would not employ his gifts. But found out many sleights and shifts; Hee had no prayers, nor no snifts,           For th’ divell.   Some other way they cast about, These brought him in, they throw not out; A woman, great with child, will do’t;           They got one.   And she i’ th’ room that night must lie; But when the thing about did flie, And broke the windows furiously           And hot one   Of the contractors o’re the head, Who lay securely in his bed, The woman, shee-affrighted, fled —— ——   And now they lay the cause on her. That e’re that night the thing did stir, Because her selfe and grandfather           Were Papists;   They must be barnes-regenerate, (A _Hans en Kelder_ of the state, Which was in reformation gatt,)           They said, which   Doth make the divell stand in awe, Pull in his hornes, his hoof, his claw; But having none, they did in draw —— —— ——   But in the night there was such worke, The spirit swaggered like a Turke; The bitch had spi’d where it did lurke,           And howled   In such a wofull manner that Their very"]]]
