Marcolf fails, and the king condemns him to sit up all night in his company, threatening him with death in the morning, should he fall asleep. This, of course, Marcolf does immediately, and he snores aloud. Solomon asks, \"Sleepest thou?\"--And Marcolf replies, \"No, I think.\"--\"What thinkest thou?\"--\"That there are as many vertebrae in the hare's tail as in his backbone.\"--The king, assured that he has now entrapped his adversary, replies: \"If thou provest not this, thou diest in the morning!\" Over and over again Marcolf snores, and is awakened by Solomon, but he is always _thinking_. He gives various answers during the night: There are as many white feathers as black in the magpie.--There is nothing whiter than daylight, daylight is whiter than milk.--Nothing can be safely entrusted to a woman.--Nature is stronger than education.  Next day Marcolf proves all his statements. Thus, he places a pan of milk in a dark closet, and suddenly calls the king. Solomon steps into the milk, splashes himself, and nearly falls. \"Son of perdition! what does this mean?\" roars the monarch. \"May it please Your Majesty,\" says Marcolf, \"merely to show you that milk is not whiter than daylight.\" That nature is stronger than education, Marcolf proves by throwing three mice, one after the other, before a cat trained to hold a lighted candle in its paws during the king's supper; the cat drops the taper, and chases the mice. Marcolf further enters into a bitter abuse of womankind, and ends by inducing Solomon himself to join in the diatribe. When the king perceives the trick, he turns Marcolf out of court, and eventually orders him to be hanged. One favor is granted to him: he may select his own tree. Marcolf and his guards traverse the valley of Jehoshaphat, pass to Jericho over Jordan, through Arabia and the Red Sea, but \"never more could Marcolf find a tree that he would choose to hang on.\" By this device, Marcolf escapes from Solomon's hands, returns home, and passes the rest of his days in peace.  The legend, no doubt Oriental in origin, enjoyed popularity in the Middle Ages largely because it became the frame into which could be placed collections of proverbial lore. Hence, as happened also with the legend of the Queen of Sheba and her riddles, the versions vary considerably as to the actual content of the questions and answers bandied between Solomon and Marcolf. In the German and English versions, the proverbs and wisdom are largely Teutonic; in Zabara they are Oriental, and, in particular, Arabic. Again, Marcolf in the French version of Mauclerc is much more completely the reviler of woman. Mauclerc wrote almost contemporaneously with Zabara (about 1216-1220, according to Kemble). But, on the other hand, Mauclerc has no story, and his Marcolf is a punning clown rather than a cunning sage. Marcolf, who is Solomon's brother in a German version, has no trust in a woman even when dead. So, in another version, Marcolf is at once supernaturally cunning, and extremely skeptical as to the morality and constancy of woman. But it is unnecessary to enter into the problem more closely. Suffice it to have established that in Zabara's \"Book of Delight\" we have a hitherto unsuspected adaptation of the Solomon-Marcolf legend. Zabara handles the legend with rare originality, and even ventures to cast himself for the title r√¥le in place of the wisest of kings.  In the summary of the book which follows, the rhymed prose of the original Hebrew is reproduced only in one case. This form of poetry is unsuited to the English language. What may have a strikingly pleasing effect in Oriental speech, becomes, in English, indistinguishable from doggerel. I have not translated at full length, but I have endeavored to render Zabara accurately, without introducing thoughts foreign to him.  I have not thought it necessary to give elaborate parallels to Zabara's stories, nor to compare minutely the various details of the Marcolf legend with Zabara's poem. On the whole, it may be said that the parallel is general rather than specific. I am greatly mistaken, however, if the collection of stories that follows does not prove of considerable interest to those engaged in the tracking of fables to their native lairs. Here, in Zabara, we have an earlier instance than was previously known in Europe, of an intertwined series of fables and witticisms, partly Indian, partly Greek, partly Semitic, in origin, welded together by the Hebrew poet by means of a framework. The use of the framework by a writer in Europe in the year 1200 is itself noteworthy. And when it is remembered what the framework is, it becomes obvious that the \"Book of Delight\" occupies a unique position in medieval literature.   THE GIANT GUEST    Once on a night, I, Joseph, lay upon my bed; sleep was sweet upon me, my   one return for all my toil. Things there are which weary the soul and   rest the body, others that weary the body and rest the soul, but sleep   brings calm to the body and the soul at once.... While I slept, I dreamt;   and a gigantic but manlike figure appeared before me, rousing me from my   slumber. \"Arise, thou sleeper, rouse thyself and see the wine while it is   red; come, sit thee down and eat of what I provide.\" It was dawn when I   hastily rose, and I saw before me wine, bread, and viands; and in the   man's hand was a lighted lamp, which cast a glare into every corner. I   said, \"What are these, my master?\" \"My wine, my bread, my viands; come,   eat and drink with me, for I love thee as one of my mother's sons.\" And I   thanked him, but protested: \"I cannot eat or drink till I have prayed to   the Orderer of all my ways; for Moses, the choice of the prophets, and   the head of those called, hath ordained, 'Eat not with the blood';   therefore no son of Israel will eat until he prays for his soul, for the   blood is the soul....\"    Then said he, \"Pray, if such be thy wish\"; and I bathed my hands and   face, and prayed. Then I ate of all that was before me, for my soul loved   him.... Wine I would not drink, though he pressed me sore. \"Wine,\" I   said, \"blindeth the eyes, robbeth the old of wisdom and the body of   strength, it revealeth the secrets of friends, and raiseth dissension   between brothers.\" The man's anger was roused. \"Why blasphemest thou   against wine, and bearest false witness against it? Wine bringeth joy;   sorrow and sighing fly before it. It strengtheneth the body, maketh the   heart generous, prolongeth pleasure, and deferreth age; faces it maketh   shine, and the senses it maketh bright.\"    \"Agreed, but let thy servant take the water first, as the ancient   physicians advise; later I will take the wine, a little, without water.\"    When I had eaten and drunk with him, I asked for his name and his   purpose. \"I come,\" said he, \"from a distant land, from pleasant and   fruitful hills, my wisdom is as thine, my laws as thine, my name Enan   Hanatash, the son of Arnan ha-Desh.\" I was amazed at the name, unlike any   I had ever heard. \"Come with me from this land, and I will tell thee all   my secret lore; leave this spot, for they know not here thy worth and thy   wisdom. I will take thee to another place, pleasant as a garden, peopled   by loving men, wise above all others.\" But I answered: \"My lord, I cannot   go. Here are many wise and friendly; while I live, they bear me on the   wing of their love; when I die, they will make my death sweet.... I fear   thee for thy long limbs, and in thy face I see, clear-cut, the marks of   unworthiness; I fear thee, and I will not be thy companion, lest there   befall me what befell the leopard with the fox.\" And I told him the   story.  In this manner, illustrative tales are introduced throughout the poem. Zabara displays rare ingenuity in fitting the illustrations into his framework. He proceeds:   THE FOX AND THE LEOPARD    A leopard once lived in content and plenty; ever he found easy sustenance   for his wife and children. Hard by there dwelt his neighbor and friend,   the fox. The fox felt in his heart that his life was safe only so long as   the leopard could catch other prey, and he planned out a method for   ridding himself of this dangerous friendship. Before the evil cometh, say   the wise, counsel is good. \"Let me move him hence,\" thought the fox; \"I   will lead him to the paths of death; for the sages say, 'If one come to   slay thee, be beforehand with him, and slay him instead.'\" Next day the   fox went to the leopard, and told him of a spot he had seen, a spot of   gardens and lilies, where fawns and does disported themselves, and   everything was fair. The leopard went with him to behold this paradise,   and rejoiced with exceeding joy. \"Ah,\" thought the fox, \"many a smile   ends in a tear.\" But the leopard was charmed, and wished to move to this   delightful abode; \"but, first,\" said he, \"I will go to consult my wife,   my lifelong comrade, the bride of my youth.\" The fox was sadly   disconcerted. Full well he knew the wisdom and the craft of the leopard's   wife. \"Nay,\" said he, \"trust not thy wife. A woman's counsel is evil and   foolish, her heart hard like marble; she is a plague in a house. Yes, ask   her advice, and do the opposite.\".... The leopard told his wife that he   was resolved to go. \"Beware of the fox,\" she exclaimed; \"two small   animals there are, the craftiest they, by far--the serpent and the fox.   Hast thou not heard how the fox bound the lion and slew him with   cunning?\" \"How did the fox dare,\" asked the leopard, \"to come near enough   to the lion to do it?\"  The wife than takes up the parable, and cites the incident of   THE FOX AND THE LION    Then said the leopard's wife: The lion loved the fox, but the fox had no   faith in him, and plotted his death. One day the fox went to the lion   whining that a pain had seized him in the head. \"I have heard,\" said the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9886"],["title","The Book of Delight and Other Papers (#3)"],["body","ox, \"that physicians prescribe for a headache, that the patient shall be   tied up hand and foot.\" The lion assented, and bound up the fox with a   cord. \"Ah,\" blithely said the fox, \"my pain is gone.\" Then the lion   loosed him. Time passed, and the lion's turn came to suffer in his head.   In sore distress he went to the fox, fast as a bird to the snare, and   exclaimed, \"Bind me up, brother, that I, too, may be healed, as happened   with thee.\" The fox took fresh withes, and bound the lion up. Then he   went to fetch great stones, which he cast on the lion's head, and thus   crushed him. \"Therefore, my dear leopard,\" concluded his wife, \"trust not   the fox, for I fear him and his wiles. If the place he tells of be so   fair, why does not the fox take it for himself?\" \"Nay,\" said the leopard,   \"thou art a silly prattler. I have often proved my friend, and there is   no dross in the silver of his love.\"   The leopard would not hearken to his wife's advice, yet he was somewhat moved by her warning, and he told the fox of his misgiving, adding, that his wife refused to accompany him. \"Ah,\" replied the fox, \"I fear your fate will be like the silversmith's; let me tell you his story, and you will know how silly it is to listen to a wife's counsel.\"   THE SILVERSMITH WHO FOLLOWED HIS WIFE'S COUNSEL    A silversmith of Babylon, skilful in his craft, was one day at work.   \"Listen to me,\" said his wife, \"and I will make thee rich and honored.   Our lord, the king, has an only daughter, and he loves her as his life.   Fashion for her a silver image of herself, and I will bear it to her as a   gift.\" The statue was soon made, and the princess rejoiced at seeing it.   She gave a cloak and earrings to the artist's wife, and she showed them   to her husband in triumph. \"But where is the wealth and the honor?\" he   asked. \"The statue was worth much more than thou hast brought.\" Next day   the king saw the statue in his daughter's hand, and his anger was   kindled. \"Is it not ordered,\" he cried, \"that none should make an image?   Cut off his right hand.\" The king's command was carried out, and daily   the smith wept, and exclaimed, \"Take warning from me, ye husbands, and   obey not the voice of your wives.\"   The leopard shuddered when he heard this tale; but the fox went on:   THE WOODCUTTER AND THE WOMAN    A hewer of wood in Damascus was cutting logs, and his wife sat spinning   by his side. \"My departed father,\" she said, \"was a better workman than   thou. He could chop with both hands: when the right hand was tired, he   used the left.\" \"Nay,\" said he, \"no woodcutter does that, he uses his   right hand, unless he be a left-handed man.\" \"Ah, my dear,\" she   entreated, \"try and do it as my father did.\" The witless wight raised his   left hand to hew the wood, but struck his right-hand thumb instead.   Without a word he took the axe and smote her on the head, and she died.   His deed was noised about; the woodcutter was seized and stoned for his   crime. Therefore, continued the fox, I say unto thee, all women are   deceivers and trappers of souls. And let me tell you more of these wily   stratagems.   The fox reinforces his argument by relating an episode in which a contrast is drawn between   MAN'S LOVE AND WOMAN'S    A king of the Arabs, wise and well-advised, was one day seated with his   counsellors, who were loud in the praise of women, lauding their virtues   and their wisdom. \"Cut short these words,\" said the king. \"Never since   the world began has there been a good woman. They love for their own   ends.\" \"But,\" pleaded his sages, \"O King, thou art hasty. Women there   are, wise and faithful and spotless, who love their husbands and tend   their children.\" \"Then,\" said the king, \"here is my city before you:   search it through, and find one of the good women of whom you speak.\"   They sought, and they found a woman, chaste and wise, fair as the moon   and bright as the sun, the wife of a wealthy trader; and the counsellors   reported about her to the king. He sent for her husband, and received him   with favor. \"I have something for thy ear,\" said the king. \"I have a good   and desirable daughter: she is my only child; I will not give her to a   king or a prince: let me find a simple, faithful man, who will love her   and hold her in esteem. Thou art such a one; thou shalt have her. But   thou art married: slay thy wife to-night, and to-morrow thou shalt wed my   daughter.\" \"I am unworthy,\" pleaded the man, \"to be the shepherd of thy   flock, much less the husband of thy daughter.\" But the king would take no   denial. \"But how shall I kill my wife? For fifteen years she has eaten of   my bread and drunk of my cup. She is the joy of my heart; her love and   esteem grow day by day.\" \"Slay her,\" said the king, \"and be king   hereafter.\" He went forth from the presence, downcast and sad, thinking   over, and a little shaken by, the king's temptation. At home he saw his   wife and his two babes. \"Better,\" he cried, \"is my wife than a kingdom.   Cursed be all kings who tempt men to sip sorrow, calling it joy.\" The   king waited his coming in vain; and then he sent messengers to the man's   shop. When he found that the man's love had conquered his lust, he said,   with a sneer, \"Thou art no man: thy heart is a woman's.\"    In the evening the king summoned the woman secretly. She came, and the   king praised her beauty and her wisdom. His heart, he said, was burning   with love for her, but he could not wed another man's wife. \"Slay thy   husband to-night, and tomorrow be my queen.\" With a smile, the woman   consented; and the king gave her a sword made of tin, for he knew the   weak mind of woman. \"Strike once,\" he said to her; \"the sword is sharp;   you need not essay a second blow.\" She gave her husband a choice repast,   and wine to make him drunken. As he lay asleep, she grasped the sword and   struck him on the head; and the tin bent, and he awoke. With some ado she   quieted him, and he fell asleep again. Next morning the king summoned   her, and asked whether she had obeyed his orders. \"Yes,\" said she, \"but   thou didst frustrate thine own counsel.\" Then the king assembled his   sages, and bade her tell all that she had attempted; and the husband,   too, was fetched, to tell his story. \"Did I not tell you to cease your   praises of women?\" asked the king, triumphantly.   IN DISPRAISE OF WOMAN  The fox follows up these effective narratives with a lengthy string of well-worn quotations against women, of which the following are a few: Socrates, the wise and saintly, hated and despised them. His wife was thin and short. They asked him, \"How could a man like you choose such a woman for your wrife?\" \"I chose,\" said Socrates, \"of the evil the least possible amount.\" \"Why, then, do you look on beautiful women?\" \"Neither,\" said Socrates, \"from love nor from desire, but to admire the handiwork of God in their outward form. It is within that they are foul.\" Once he was walking by the way, and he saw a woman hanging from a fig-tree. \"Would,\" said Socrates, \"that all the fruit were like this.\"--A nobleman built a new house, and wrote over the door, \"Let nothing evil pass this way.\" \"Then how does his wife go in?\" asked Diogenes.--\"Your enemy is dead,\" said one to another. \"I would rather hear that he had got married,\" was the reply.  \"So much,\" said the fox to the leopard, \"I have told thee that thou mayest know how little women are to be trusted. They deceive men in life, and betray them in death.\" \"But,\" queried the leopard, \"what could my wife do to harm me after I am dead?\" \"Listen,\" rejoined the fox, \"and I will tell thee of a deed viler than any I have narrated hitherto.\"   THE WIDOW AND HER HUSBAND'S CORPSE    The kings of Rome, when they hanged a man, denied him burial until the   tenth day. That the friends and relatives of the victim might not steal   the body, an officer of high rank was set to watch the tree by night. If   the body was stolen, the officer was hung up in its place. A knight of   high degree once rebelled against the king, and he was hanged on a tree.   The officer on guard was startled at midnight to hear a piercing shriek   of anguish from a little distance; he mounted his horse, and rode towards   the voice, to discover the meaning. He came to an open grave, where the   common people were buried, and saw a weeping woman loud in laments for   her departed spouse. He sent her home with words of comfort, accompanying   her to the city gate. He then returned to his post. Next night the same   scene was repeated, and as the officer spoke his gentle soothings to her,   a love for him was born in her heart, and her dead husband was forgotten.   And as they spoke words of love, they neared the tree, and lo! the body   that the officer was set to watch was gone. \"Begone,\" he said, \"and I   will fly, or my life must pay the penalty of my dalliance.\" \"Fear not, my   lord,\" she said, \"we can raise my husband from his grave and hang him   instead of the stolen corpse.\" \"But I fear the Prince of Death. I cannot   drag a man from his grave.\" \"I alone will do it then,\" said the woman; \"I   will dig him out; it is lawful to cast a dead man from the grave, to keep   a live man from being thrown in.\" \"Alas!\" cried the officer, when she had   done the fearsome deed, \"the corpse I watched was bald, your husband has   thick hair; the change will be detected.\" \"Nay,\" said the woman, \"I will   make him bald,\" and she tore his hair out, with execrations, and they   hung him on the tree. But a few days passed and the pair were married.   And now the leopard interlude nears it close. Zabara narrates the _d√©nouement_ in these terms:   THE LEOPARD'S FATE    The leopard's bones rattled while he listened to this tale. Angrily he   addressed his wife, \"Come, get up and follow me, or I will slay thee.\"   Together they went with their young ones, and the fox was their guide,   and they reached the promised place, and"]]]
