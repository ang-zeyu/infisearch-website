With this object in view he told Thoth to summon Keb, the Earth-god, to his presence, and this god having arrived, Ra told him that war must be made against the serpents that dwelt in his dominions. He further commanded him to go to the god Nu, and to tell him to set a watch over all the reptiles that were in the earth and in water, and to draw up a writing for every place in which serpents are known to be, containing strict orders that they are to bite, no one.  Though these serpents knew that Ra was retiring from the earth, they were never to forget that his rays would fall upon them.  In his place their father Keb was to keep watch over them, and he was their father for ever.  As a further protection against them Ra promised to impart to magicians and snake-charmers the particular word of power, hekau, with which he guarded himself against the attacks of serpents, and also to transmit it to his son Osiris.  Thus those who are ready to listen to the formulae of the snake-charmers shall always be immune from the bites of serpents, and their children also.  From this we may gather that the profession of the snake-charmer is very ancient, and that this class of magicians were supposed to owe the foundation of their craft to a decree of Ra himself.  Ra next sent for the god Thoth, and when he came into the presence of Ra, he invited him to go with him to a distance, to a place called \"Tuat,\" i.e., hell, or the Other World, in which region he had determined to make his light to shine.  When they arrived there he told Thoth, the Scribe of Truth, to write down on his tablets the names of all who were therein, and to punish those among them who had sinned against him, and he deputed to Thoth the power to deal absolutely as he pleased with all the beings in the Tuat.  Ra loathed the wicked, and wished them to be kept at a distance from him.  Thoth was to be his vicar, to fill his place, and \"Place of Ra,\" was to be his name.  He gave him power to send out a messenger (hab), so the Ibis (habi) came into being.  All that Thoth would do would be good (khen), therefore the Tekni bird of Thoth came into being.  He gave Thoth power to embrace (anh) the heavens, therefore the Moon-god (Aah) came into being.  He gave Thoth power to turn back (anan) the Northern peoples, therefore the dog-headed ape of Thoth came into being.  Finally Ra told Thoth that he would take his place in the sight of all those who were wont to worship Ra, and that all should praise him as God.  Thus the abdication of Ra was complete.  In the fragmentary texts which follow we are told how a man may benefit by the recital of this legend.  He must proclaim that the soul which animated Ra was the soul of the Aged One, and that of Shu, Khnemu (?), Heh, &c., and then he must proclaim that he is Ra himself, and his word of power Heka.  If he recites the Chapter correctly he shall have life in the Other World, and he will be held in greater fear there than here.  A rubric adds that he must be dressed in new linen garments, and be well washed with Nile water; he must wear white sandals, and his body must be anointed with holy oil.  He must burn incense in a censer, and a figure of Maat (Truth) must be painted on his tongue with green paint.  These regulations applied to the laity as well as to the clergy.     III.    THE LEGEND OF RA AND ISIS.    The original text of this very interesting legend is written in the hieratic character on a papyrus preserved at Turin, and was published by Pleyte and Rossi in their Corpus of Turin Papyri.[FN#16]  French and German translations of it were published by Lefebure,[FN#17] and Wiedemann[FN#18] respectively, and summaries of its contents were given by Erman[FN#19] and Maspero.[FN#20]  A transcript of the hieratic text into hieroglyphics, with transliteration and translation, was published by me in 1895.[FN#21]    [FN#16]  Papyrus de Turin, pll. 31, 77, 131-138.  [FN#17]  A. Z., 1883, p. 27 ff.  [FN#18]  Die Religion, p. 29.  [FN#19]  Aegypten, p. 359 ff.  [FN#20]  Les Origines, V. 162-4.   [FN#21]  First Steps in Egyptian, p. 241 ff.    It has already been seen that the god Ra, when retiring from the government of this world, took steps through Thoth to supply mankind with words of power and spells with which to protect themselves against the bites of serpents and other noxious reptiles.  The legend of the Destruction of Mankind affords no explanation of this remarkable fact, but when we read the following legend of Ra and Isis we understand why Ra, though king of the gods, was afraid of the reptiles which lived in the kingdom of Keb.  The legend, or \"Chapter of the Divine God,\" begins by enumerating the mighty attributes of Ra as the creator of the universe, and describes the god of \"many names\" as unknowable, even by the gods.  At this time Isis lived in the form of a woman who possessed the knowledge of spells and incantations, that is to say, she was regarded much in the same way as modern African peoples regard their \"medicine-women,\" or \"witch-women.\"  She had used her spells on men, and was tired of exercising her powers on them, and she craved the opportunity of making herself mistress of gods and spirits as well as of men.  She meditated how she could make herself mistress both of heaven and earth, and finally she decided that she could only obtain the power she wanted if she possessed the knowledge of the secret name of Ra, in which his very existence was bound up.  Ra guarded this name most jealously, for he knew that if he revealed it to any being he would henceforth be at that being's mercy.  Isis saw that it was impossible to make Ra declare his name to her by ordinary methods, and she therefore thought out the following plan.  It was well known in Egypt and the Sudan at a very early period that if a magician obtained some portion of a person's body, e.g., a hair, a paring of a nail, a fragment of skin, or a portion of some efflux from the body, spells could be used upon them which would have the effect of causing grievous harm to that person.  Isis noted that Ra had become old and feeble, and that as he went about he dribbled at the mouth, and that his saliva fell upon the ground.  Watching her opportunity she caught some of the saliva of the and mixing it with dust, she moulded it into the form of a large serpent, with poison-fangs, and having uttered her spells over it, she left the serpent lying on the path, by which Ra travelled day by day as he went about inspecting Egypt, so that it might strike at him as he passed along.  We may note in passing that the Banyoro in the Sudan employ serpents in killing buffaloes at the present day.  They catch a puff-adder in a noose, and then nail it alive by the tip of its tail to the round in the middle of a buffalo track, so that when an animal passes the reptile may strike at it.  Presently a buffalo comes along, does what it is expected to do, and then the puff-adder strikes at it, injects its poison, and the animal dies soon after.  As many as ten buffaloes have been killed in a day by one puff-adder.  The body of the first buffalo is not eaten, for it is regarded as poisoned meat, but all the others are used as food.[FN#22]    [FN#22]  Johnston, Uganda, vol. ii., p. 584.  The authority for this statement is Mr. George Wilson, formerly Collector in Unyoro.    Soon after Isis had placed the serpent on the Path, Ra passed by, and the reptile bit him, thus injecting poison into his body.  Its effect was terrible, and Ra cried out in agony.  His jaws chattered, his lips trembled, and he became speechless for a time; never before had be suffered such pain.  The gods hearing his cry rushed to him, and when he could speak he told them that he had been bitten by a deadly serpent.  In spite of all the words of power which were known to him, and his secret name which had been hidden in his body at his birth, a serpent had bitten him, and he was being consumed with a fiery pain. He then commanded that all the gods who had any knowledge of magical spells should come to him, and when they came, Isis, the great lady of spells, the destroyer of diseases, and the revivifier of the dead, came with them.  Turning to Ra she said, \"What hath happened, O divine Father?\" and in answer the god told her that a serpent had bitten him, that he was hotter than fire and colder than water, that his limbs quaked, and that he was losing the power of sight.  Then Isis said to him with guile, \"Divine Father, tell me thy name, for he who uttereth his own name shall live.\"  Thereupon Ra proceeded to enumerate the various things that he had done, and to describe his creative acts, and ended his speech to Isis by saying, that he was Khepera in the morning, Ra at noon, and Temu in the evening.  Apparently he thought that the naming of these three great names would satisfy Isis, and that she would immediately pronounce a word of power and stop the pain in his body, which, during his speech, had become more acute.  Isis, however, was not deceived, and she knew well that Ra had not declared to her his hidden name; this she told him, and she begged him once again to tell her his name.  For a time the god refused to utter the name, but as the pain in his body became more violent, and the poison passed through his veins like fire, he said, \"Isis shall search in me, and my name shall pass from my body into hers.\"  At that moment Ra removed himself from the sight of the gods in his Boat, and the Throne in the Boat of Millions of Years had no occupant.  The great name of Ra was, it seems, hidden in his heart, and Isis, having some doubt as to whether Ra would keep his word or not, agreed with Horus that Ra must be made to take an oath to part with his two Eyes, that is, the Sun and the Moon.  At length Ra allowed his heart to be taken from his body, and his great and secret name,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9411"],["title","Legends of the Gods (#4)"],["body","he lived, passed into the possession of Isis. Ra thus became to all intents and purposes a dead god.  Then Isis, strong in the power of her spells, said: \"Flow, poison, come out of Ra. Eye of Horus, come out of Ra, and shine outside his mouth.  It is I, Isis, who work, and I have made the poison to fall on the ground. Verily the name of the great god is taken from him, Ra shall live and the poison shall die; if the poison live Ra shall die.\"  This was the infallible spell which was to be used in cases of poisoning, for it rendered the bite or sting of every venomous reptile harmless.  It drove the poison out of Ra, and since it was composed by Isis after she obtained the knowledge of his secret name it was irresistible.  If the words were written on papyrus or linen over a figure of Temu or Heru-hekenu, or Isis, or Horus, they became a mighty charm.  If the papyrus or linen were steeped in water and the water drunk, the words were equally efficacious as a charm against snake- bites.  To this day water in which the written words of a text from the Kur'an have been dissolved, or water drunk from a bowl on the inside of which religious texts have been written, is still regarded as a never- failing charm in Egypt and the Sudan.  Thus we see that the modern custom of drinking magical water was derived from the ancient Egyptians, who believed that it conveyed into their bodies the actual power of their gods.      IV.     THE LEGEND OF HERU-BEHUTET AND THE WINGED DISK.     The text of this legend is cut in hieroglyphics on the walls of the temple of Edfu in Upper Egypt, and certain portions of it are illustrated by large bas-reliefs.  Both text and reliefs were published by Professor Naville in his volume entitled Mythe d'Horus, fol., plates 12-19, Geneva, 1870.  A German translation by Brugsch appeared in the Ahandlungen der Gottinger Akademie, Band xiv., pp. 173-236, and another by Wiedemann in his Die Religion, p. 38 ff. (see the English translation p. 69 ff.).  The legend, in the form in which it is here given, dates from the Ptolemaic Period, but the matter which it contains is far older, and it is probable that the facts recorded in it are fragments of actual history, which the Egyptians of the late period tried to piece together in chronological order.  We shall see as we read that the writer of the legend as we have it was not well acquainted with Egyptian history, and that in his account of the conquest of Egypt he has confounded one god with another, and mixed up historical facts with mythological legends to such a degree that his meaning is frequently uncertain.  The great fact which he wished to describe is the conquest of Egypt by an early king, who, having subdued the peoples in the South, advanced northwards, and made all the people whom he conquered submit to his yoke.  Now the King of Egypt was always called Horus, and the priests of Edfu wishing to magnify their local god, Horus of Behutet, or Horus of Edfu, attributed to him the conquests of this human, and probably predynastic, king.  We must remember that the legend assumes that Ra, was still reigning on earth, though he was old and feeble, and had probably deputed his power to his successor, whom the legend regards as his son.    PLATE I. Horus holding the Hippopotamus-fiend with chain and spear.  Behind stand Isis and Heru Khenti-Khatti.  PLATE II. Horus driving his spear into the Hippopotamus-fiend; behind him stands one of his \"Blacksmiths\".  PLATE III. Horus driving his spear into the belly of the Hippopotamus-fiend as he lies on his back; behind stands on of his \"Blacksmiths\".  PLATE IV. Horus and Isis capturing the Hippopotamus-fiend.    In the 363rd year of his reign Ra-Harmakhis[FN#23] was in Nubia with his army with the intention of destroying those who had conspired against him; because of their conspiracy (auu) Nubia is called \"Uaua\" to this day.  From Nubia Ra-Harmakhis sailed down the river to Edfu, where Heru-Behutet entered his boat, and told him that his foes were conspiring against him.  Ra-Harmakhis in answer addressed Heru-Behutet as his son, and commanded him to set out without delay and slay the wicked rebels.  Then Heru-Behutet took the form of a great winged Disk, and at once flew up into the sky, where he took the place of Ra, the old Sun-god.  Looking down from the height of heaven he was able to discover the whereabouts of the rebels, and he pursued them in the form of a winged disk.  Then he attacked them with such violence that they became dazed, and could neither see where they were going, nor hear, the result of this being that they slew each other, and in a very short time they were all dead.  Thoth, seeing this, told Ra that because Horus had appeared as a great winged disk he must be called \"Heru- Behutet,\" and by this name Horus was known ever after at Edfu.  Ra embraced Horus, and referred with pleasure to the blood which he had shed, and Horus invited his father to come and look upon the slain.  Ra set out with the goddess Ashthertet (`Ashtoreth) to do this, and they saw the enemies lying fettered on the ground.  The legend here introduces a number of curious derivations of the names of Edfu, &c., which are valueless, and which remind us of the derivations of place- names propounded by ancient Semitic scribes.    [FN#23]  i.e., Ra on the horizon.    PLATE V. Horus standing on the back of the Hippopotamus-fiend, and spearing him in the presence of Isis.  PLATE VI. The \"Butcher-priest\" slicing open the Hippopotamus-fiend.    In gladness of heart Ra proposed a sail on the Nile, but as soon as his enemies heard that he was coming, they changed themselves into crocodiles and hippopotami, so that they might be able to wreck his boat and devour him.  As the boat of the god approached them they opened their jaws to crush it, but Horus and his followers came quickly on the scene, and defeated their purpose.  The followers of Horus here mentioned are called in the text \"Mesniu,\" i.e., \"blacksmiths,\" or \"workers in metal,\" and they represent the primitive conquerors of the Egyptians, who were armed with metal weapons, and so were able to overcome with tolerable ease the indigenous Egyptians, whose weapons were made of flint and wood.  Horus and his \"blacksmiths\" were provided with iron lances and chains, and, baying cast the chains over the monsters in the river, they drove their lances into their snouts, and slew 651 of them.  Because Horus gained his victory by means of metal weapons, Ra decreed that a metal statue of Horus should be placed at Edfu, and remain there for ever, and a name was given to the town to commemorate the great battle that had taken place there.  Ra applauded Horus for the mighty deeds which be had been able to perform by means of the spells contained in the \"Book of Slaying the Hippopotamus.\" Horus then associated with himself the goddesses Uatchet and Nekhebet, who were in the form of serpents, and, taking his place as the winged Disk on the front of the Boat of Ra, destroyed all the enemies of Ra wheresoever he found them.  When the remnant of the enemies of Ra, saw that they were likely to be slain, they doubled back to the South, but Horus pursued them, and drove them down the river before him as far as Thebes.  One battle took place at Tchetmet, and another at Denderah, and Horus was always victorious; the enemies were caught by chains thrown over them, and the deadly spears of the Blacksmiths drank their blood.  After this the enemy fled to the North, and took refuge in the swamps of the Delta, and in the shallows of the Mediterranean Sea, and Horus pursued them thither.  After searching for them for four days and four nights he found them, and they were speedily slain.  One hundred and forty-two of them and a male hippopotamus were dragged on to the Boat of Ra, and there Horus dug out their entrails, and hacked their carcases in pieces, which he gave to his Blacksmiths and the gods who formed the crew of the Boat of Ra.  Before despatching the hippopotamus, Horus leaped on to the back of the monster as a mark of his triumph, and to commemorate this event the priest of Heben, the town wherein these things happened, was called \"He who standeth on the back ever after.\"  The end of the great fight, however, was not yet.  Another army of enemies appeared by the North Lake, and they were marching towards the sea; but terror of Horus smote their hearts, and they fled and took refuge in Mertet-Ament, where they allied themselves with the followers of Set, the Arch-fiend and great Enemy of Ra.  Thither Horus and his well-armed Blacksmiths pursued them, and came up with them at the town called Per-Rerehu, which derived its name from the \"Two Combatants,\" or \"Two Men,\" Horus and Set.  A great fight took place, the enemies of Ra were defeated with great slaughter, and Horus dragged 381 prisoners on to the Boat of Ra, where he slew them, and gave their bodies to his followers.    PLATE VII. Horus of Behutet and Ra-Harmakhis in a shrine.  PLATE VIII. Horus of Behutet and Harmakhis in a shrine.  PLATE IX.  Ashthertet ('Ashtoreth') driving her chariot over the prostrate foe.  PLATE X. Left: Horus of Behutet spearing a Typhonic animal, and holding his prisoners with rope.  Right: Horus of Behutet, accompanied by Ra-Harmakhis and Menu, spearing the Hippopotamus-fiend.    Then Set rose up and cursed Horus because he had slain his allies, and he used such foul language that Thoth called him \"Nehaha-her,\" i.e., \"Stinking Face,\" and this name clung to him ever after.  After this Horus and Set engaged in a fight which lasted a very long time, but at length Horus drove his spear into the neck of Set with such violence that the Fiend fell headlong to the ground.  Then Horus smote with his club the mouth which had uttered such blasphemies, and fettered him with his chain.  In this state Horus dragged Set into the presence of Ra, who ascribed great praise to Horus, and special names were given to the palace "]]]
