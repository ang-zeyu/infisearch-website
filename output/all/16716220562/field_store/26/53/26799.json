Can you tell me if, any time yesterday, afternoon or evening, you saw anywhere about here a tall, distinguished-looking man--the actor type. In fact, he is an actor--perhaps you've heard of him? Mr. Bassett Oliver.\"  He was looking narrowly at the girl as he spoke, and she, too, looked narrowly at him out of a pair of grey eyes of more than ordinary intelligence and perception. And at the famous actor's name she started a little and a faint colour stole over her cheeks.  \"Mr. Bassett Oliver!\" she exclaimed in a clear, cultured voice. \"My mother and I saw Mr. Oliver at the Northborough Theatre on Friday evening. Do you mean that he--\"  \"I mean--to put it bluntly--that Bassett Oliver is lost,\" answered Copplestone. \"He came to this place yesterday, Sunday, morning, to look round; he lunched at the 'Admiral's Arms,' he went out, after a chat with the landlady, and he's never been seen since. He should have turned up at the 'Angel' at Norcaster last night, and at a rehearsal at the Theatre Royal there today at noon--but he didn't. His manager and I have tracked him here--and so far I can't hear of him. I've asked people all through the village--this side, anyway--nobody knows anything.\"  He and the girl still looked attentively at each other; Copplestone, indeed, was quietly inspecting her while he talked. He judged her to be twenty-one or two; she was a little above medium height, slim, graceful, pretty, and he was quick to notice that her entire air and appearance suggested their present surroundings. Her fair hair escaped from a knitted cap such as fisher-folk wear; her slender figure was shown to advantage by a rough blue jersey; her skirt of blue serge was short and practical; she was shod in brogues which showed more acquaintance with sand and salt water than with polish. And her face was tanned with the strong northern winds, and the ungloved hands, small and shapely as they were, were brown as the beach across which she had come.  \"I have not seen--nor heard--of Mr. Bassett Oliver--here,\" she answered. \"I was out and about all yesterday afternoon and evening, too--not on this side of the bay, though. Have you been to the police-station?\"  \"The manager may have been there,\" replied Copplestone. \"He's gone along the other shore. But--I don't think he'll get any help there. I'm afraid Mr. Oliver must have met with an accident. I wanted to ask you a question--I saw you coming from the direction of those rocks just now. Could he have got out there across those sands, yesterday afternoon?\"  \"Between three o'clock and evening--yes,\" said the girl.  \"And--is it dangerous out there?\"  \"Very dangerous indeed--to any one who doesn't know them.\"  \"There's something there called the Devil's Spout?\"  \"Yes--a deep fissure up which the sea boils. Oh! it seems dreadful to think of--I hope he didn't fall in there. If he did--\"  \"Well?\" asked Copplestone bluntly, \"what if he did?\"  \"Nothing ever came out that once went in,\" she answered. \"It's a sort of whirlpool that's sucked right away into the sea. The people hereabouts say it's bottomless.\"  Copplestone turned his face towards the village.  \"Oh, well,\" he said, with an accent of hopelessness. \"I can't do any more down here, it's growing dusk. I must go back and meet the manager.\"  The girl walked along at his side as he turned towards the village.  \"I suppose you are one of Mr. Oliver's company?\" she observed presently. \"You must all be much concerned.\"  \"They're all greatly concerned,\" answered Copplestone. \"But I don't belong to the company. No--I came to Norcaster this morning to meet Mr. Oliver--he's going--I hope I oughtn't to say was going!--to produce a play of mine next month, and he wanted to talk about the rehearsals. Everything, of course, was at a standstill when I reached Norcaster at one o'clock, so I came with Stafford, the business manager, to see what we could do about tracking Mr. Oliver. And I'm afraid, I'm very much afraid--\"  He paused, as a gate, set in the thick hedge of a garden at this point of the village, suddenly opened to let out a man, who at sight of the girl stopped, hesitated, and then waited for her approach. He was a tall, well-built man of apparently thirty years, dressed in a rough tweed knickerbocker suit, but the dusk had now so much increased that Copplestone could only gather an impression of ordinary good-lookingness from the face that was turned inquiringly on his companion. The girl turned to him and spoke hurriedly.  \"This is my cousin, Mr. Greyle, of Scarhaven Keep,\" she murmured. \"He may be able to help. Marston!\" she went on, raising her voice, \"can you give any help here? This gentleman--\" she paused, looking at Copplestone.  \"My name is Richard Copplestone,\" he said.  \"Mr. Copplestone is looking for Mr. Bassett Oliver, the famous actor,\" she continued, as the three met. \"Mr. Oliver has mysteriously disappeared. Mr. Copplestone has traced him here, to Scarhaven--he was here yesterday, lunching at the inn--but he can't get any further news. Did you see anything, or hear anything of him?\"  Marston Greyle, who had been inspecting the stranger narrowly in the fading light, shook his head.  \"Bassett Oliver, the actor,\" he said. \"Oh, yes, I saw his name on the bills in Norcaster the other day. Came here, and has disappeared, you say? Under what circumstances?\"  Copplestone had listened carefully to the newcomer's voice; more particularly to his accent. He had already gathered sufficient knowledge of Scarhaven to know that this man was the Squire, the master of the old house and grey ruin in the wood above the cliff; he also happened to know, being something of an archaeologist and well acquainted with family histories, that there had been Greyles of Scarhaven for many hundred years. And he wondered how it was that though this Greyle's voice was pleasant and cultured enough, its accent was decidedly American.  \"Perhaps I'd better explain,\" said Copplestone. \"I've already told most of it to this lady, but you will both understand more fully if I tell you more. It's this way--\" and he went on to tell everything that had happened and come to light since one o'clock that day. \"So you see, it's here,\" he concluded; \"we're absolutely certain that Oliver went out of the 'Admiral's Arms' up there about half-past two yesterday, but--where? From that moment, no one seems to have seen him. Yet how he could come along this village street, this quay, without being seen--\"  \"He need not have come along the quayside,\" interrupted the girl. \"There is a cliff path just below the inn which leads up to the Keep.\"  \"Also, he mayn't have taken this side of the bay, either.\" remarked Greyle. \"He may have chosen the other. You didn't see or hear of him on your side, Audrey?\"  \"Nothing!\" replied the girl. \"Nothing!\"  Marston Greyle had fallen into line with the other two, and they were now walking along the quay in the direction of the \"Admiral's Arms.\" And presently Stafford, accompanied by a policeman, came hurriedly round a corner and quickened his steps at sight of Copplestone. The policeman, evidently much puzzled and interested, saluted the Squire obsequiously as the two groups met.  \"No news at all!\" exclaimed Stafford, glancing at Copplestone's companions. \"You got any?\"  \"None,\" replied Copplestone. \"Not a word. This is Mr. Greyle, of the Keep--he has heard nothing. This lady--Miss Greyle?--was out a good deal yesterday afternoon; she knows Oliver quite well by sight, but she did not see him. So if you've no news--\"  Marston Greyle interrupted, turning to the policeman.  \"What ought to be done, Haskett?\" he asked. \"You've had cases of disappearance to deal with before, eh?\"  \"Can't say as I have, sir, in my time,\" answered the policeman. \"Leastways, not of this sort. Of course, we can get search parties together, and one of 'em can go along the coast north'ards, and the other can go south'ards, and we might have a look round the rocks out yonder, tomorrow, as soon as it's light. But if the gentleman went out there, and had the bad luck to fall into that Devil's Spout, why, then, sir, I'm afraid all the searching in the world'll do no good. And the queer thing is, gentlemen, if I may express an opinion, that nobody ever saw the gentleman after he had left Mrs. Wooler's! That seems--\"  A fisherman came lounging across the quay from the shadow of one of the neighbouring cottages. He touched his cap to Marston Greyle, and looked inquiringly at the two strangers.  \"Are you the gentlemen as is asking after another gentleman?\" he said. \"'Cause if so, I make no doubt as how I had a word or two with him yesterday afternoon.\"  Stafford and Copplestone turned sharply on the newcomer--an elderly man of plain and homely aspect who responded frankly to their questioning glances. He went on at once, before they could put their questions into words.  \"It 'ud be about half-past two, or maybe a bit nearer three o'clock,\" he said. \"Up yonder it was, about a hundred yards this side of the 'Admiral's Arms.' I was sitting on a baulk o' timber there, doing nothing, when he comes along--a tall, fine-looking man. He gives me a pleasant sort o' nod, and said it was a grand day, and we got talking a bit, about the scenery and such-like, and he said he'd never been here before. Then he pointed up to the big house and the old Keep yonder, and asked whose place that might be, and I said that was the Squire's. 'And who may the Squire be?' says he. 'Mr. Marston Greyle,' says I, 'Recent come into the property.' 'Marston Greyle!' he says, sharp-like. 'Why, I used to know a young man of that very name in America!' he says. 'Very like,' says I, 'I have heard as how the Squire had been in them parts before he came here.' 'Bless me!' he says, 'I've a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9807"],["title","Scarhaven Keep (#4)"],["body","mind to call on him. How do you get up there?' he says. So I showed him that side path that runs up through the plantation to near the top, and I told him that if he followed that till he came to the Keep, he'd find another path there as would take him to the door of the house. And he gave me a shilling to drink his health, and off he went, the way as I'd pointed out. D'ye think that'll be the same gentleman, now?\"  Nobody answered this question. Everybody there was looking at Marston Greyle. The little group had drawn near to the light of one of the three gas-lamps which feebly illuminated the quay; it seemed to Copplestone that the Squire's face had paled when the fisherman arrived at the middle of his story. But it flushed as his companion turned to him, and he laughed, a little uneasily.  \"Said he knew me--in America?\" he exclaimed. \"I don't remember meeting Mr. Bassett Oliver out there. But then I met so many Englishmen in one place or another that I may have been introduced to him somewhere, at some time, and--forgotten all about it.\"  Stafford spoke--with unnecessary abruptness, in Copplestone's opinion.  \"I don't think it very likely that any one would forget Bassett Oliver,\" he said. \"He isn't--or wasn't--the sort of man anybody could forget, once they'd met him. Anyhow--did he come to your house yesterday afternoon as this man suggests?\"  Marston Greyle drew himself up. He looked Stafford up and down. Then he made a slight gesture to the girl, whose face had already assumed a troubled expression.  \"If I had seen Mr. Bassett Oliver yesterday, sir, we should not be discussing his possible whereabouts now,\" said Greyle, icily. \"Are you coming, Audrey?\"  The girl hesitated, glanced at Copplestone, and then walked away with her cousin. Stafford sniffed contemptuously.  \"Ass!\" he muttered. \"Couldn't he see that what I meant was that Oliver must either have been mistaken, or have referred to some other Greyle whom he met? Hang his pride! Well, now,\" he went on, turning to the fisherman, \"you're dead certain about what you've told us?\"  \"As certain as mortal man can be of aught there is!\" answered the informant. \"Sure certain, mister.\"  \"Make a note of it, constable,\" said Stafford. \"Mr. Oliver was last seen going up the path to the Keep, having said he meant to call on Mr. Marston Greyle. I'll call on you again tomorrow morning. Copplestone!\" he went on, drawing his companion away, \"I'm off to Norcaster--I shall see the police there and get detectives. There's something seriously wrong here--and by heaven, we've got to get to the bottom of it! Now, look here--will you stay here for the night, so as to be on the spot? I'll come back first thing in the morning and bring your luggage--I can't come sooner, for there are heaps of business matters to deal with. You will--good! Now I can just catch a train. Copplestone!--keep your eyes and ears open. It's my firm belief--I don't know why--that there's been foul play. Foul play!\"  Stafford hurried away up hill to the station, and Copplestone, after waiting a minute or two, turned along the quay on the north of the bay--following Audrey Greyle, who was in front, alone.     CHAPTER IV  THE ESTATE AGENT   Copplestone had kept a sharp watch on Marston Greyle and his cousin when they walked off, and he had seen that they had parted at a point a little farther along the shore road--the man turning up into the wood, the girl going forward along the quay which led to the other half of the village. He quickened his pace and followed her, catching her up as she came to a path which led towards the old church. At the sound of his hurrying steps she turned and faced him, and he saw in the light of a cottage lamp that she still looked troubled and perplexed.  \"Forgive me for running after you,\" said Copplestone as he went up to her. \"I just wanted to say that I'm sorry about--about that little scene down there, you know. Your cousin misunderstood Mr. Stafford--what Stafford meant was that--\"  \"I saw what Mr. Stafford meant,\" she broke in quickly. \"I'm sorry my cousin didn't see it. It was--obvious.\"  \"All the same, Stafford put it rather--shall we say, brusquely,\" remarked Copplestone. \"Of course, he's terribly upset about Oliver's disappearance, and he didn't consider the effect of his words. And it was rather a surprise to hear that Oliver had known some man of your cousin's name over there in America, wasn't it?\"  \"And that Mr. Oliver should mysteriously disappear just after making such an announcement,\" said Audrey. \"That certainly seems very surprising.\"  The two looked at each other, a question in the eyes of each, and Copplestone knew that the trouble in the girl's eyes arose from inability to understand what was already a suspicious circumstance.  \"But after all, that may have been a mere coincidence,\" he hastened to say. \"Let's hope things may be cleared. I only hope that Oliver hasn't met with an accident and is lying somewhere without help. I'm going to remain here for the night, however, and Stafford will come back early in the morning and go more thoroughly into things--I suppose there'll have to be a search of the neighbourhood.\"  They had walked slowly up a path on the side of the cliff as they talked, and now the girl stopped before a small cottage which stood at the end of the churchyard, set in a tree-shaded garden, and looking out on the bay. She laid her hand on the gate, glancing at Copplestone, and suddenly she spoke, a little impulsively.  \"Will you come in and speak to my mother?\" she said. \"She was a great admirer of Mr. Oliver's acting--and she knew him at one time. She will be interested--and grieved.\"  Copplestone followed her up the garden and into the house, where she led the way into a small old-fashioned parlour in which a grey-haired woman, who had once been strikingly handsome, and whose face seemed to the visitor to bear traces of great trouble, sat writing at a bureau. She turned in surprise as her daughter led Copplestone in, but her manner became remarkably calm and collected as Audrey explained who he was and why he was there. And Copplestone, watching her narrowly, fancied that he saw interest flash into her eyes when she heard of Bassett Oliver's remark to the fisherman. But she made no comment, and when Audrey had finished the story, she turned to Copplestone as if she had already summed up the situation.  \"We know this place so well--having lived here so long, you know,\" she said, \"that we can make a fairly accurate guess at what Mr. Oliver might do. There seems no doubt that he went up the path to the Keep. According to Mr. Marston Greyle's statement, he certainly did not go to the house. Well, he might have done one of two other things. There is a path which leads from the Keep down to the beach, immediately opposite the big rocks which you have no doubt seen. There is another path which turns out of the woods and follows the cliffs towards Lenwick, a village along the coast, a mile away. But--at that time, on a Sunday afternoon, both paths would be frequented. Speaking from knowledge, I should say that Mr. Oliver cannot have left the woods--he must have been seen had he done so. It's impossible that he could have gone down to the shore or along the cliffs without being seen, too--impossible!\"  There was a certain amount of insistence in the last few words which puzzled Copplestone--also they conveyed to him a queer suggestion which repulsed him; it was almost as if the speaker was appealing to him to use his own common-sense about a difficult question. And before he could make any reply Mrs. Greyle put a direct inquiry to him.  \"What is going to be done?\"  \"I don't know, exactly,\" answered Copplestone. \"I'm going to stay here for the night, anyway, on the chance of hearing something. Stafford is coming back in the morning--he spoke of detectives.\"  He looked a little doubtfully at his questioner as he uttered the last word, and again he saw the sudden strange flash of unusual interest in her eyes, and she nodded her head emphatically.  \"Precisely!--the proper thing to do,\" she said. \"There must have been foul play--must!\"  \"Mother!\" exclaimed Audrey, half doubtfully. \"Do you really think--that?\"  \"I don't think anything else,\" replied Mrs. Greyle. \"I certainly don't believe that Bassett Oliver would put himself into any position of danger which would result in his breaking his neck. Bassett Oliver never left Scarhaven Wood!\"  Copplestone made no comment on this direct assertion.  Instead, after a brief silence, he asked Mrs. Greyle a question.  \"You knew Mr. Oliver--personally?\"  \"Five and twenty years ago--yes,\" she answered. \"I was on the stage myself before my marriage. But I have never met him since then. I have seen him, of course, at the local theatres.\"  \"He--you won't mind my asking?\" said Copplestone, diffidently, \"he didn't know that you lived here?\"  Mrs. Greyle smiled, somewhat mysteriously.  \"Not at all--my name wouldn't have conveyed anything to him,\" she answered. \"He never knew whom I married. Otherwise, if he met some one named Marston Greyle in America he would have connected him with me, and have made inquiry about me, and had he known I lived here, he would have called. It is odd, Audrey, that if your cousin met Mr. Oliver over there he should have forgotten him. For one doesn't easily forget a man of reputation--and Mr. Oliver was that of course!--and on the other hand, Marston Greyle is not a common name. Did you ever hear the name before, Mr. Copplestone?\"  \"Only in connection with your own family--I have read of the Greyles of Scarhaven,\" replied Copplestone. \"But, after all, I suppose it is not confined to your family. There may be Greyles in America. Well--it's all very queer,\" he went on, as he rose to leave. \"May I come in tomorrow and tell you what's being done?--I'm sure Stafford means to leave no stone unturned--he's tremendously keen about it.\"  \"Do!\" said Mrs. Greyle, heartily. \"But the"]]]
