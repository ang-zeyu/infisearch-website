Mr. Travilla went away immediately after and now it was Elsie's bed-time. Her father reminded her of it as, on coming back from seeing his friend to the door, he found her again poring over the book.  \"Oh, papa, it is so interesting! could you let me finish this chapter?\" she asked with a very entreating look up into his face as he stood at her side.  \"I suppose I could if I should make a great effort,\" he answered laughingly. \"Yes, you may, for once, but don't expect always to be allowed to do so.\"  \"No, sir, oh, no. Thank you, sir.\"  \"Well, have you come to a good stopping-place?\" he asked, as she presently closed the book and put it aside with a slight sigh.  \"No, sir, it is just as bad a one as the other. Papa, I wish I was grown up enough to read another hour before going to bed.\"  \"I don't,\" he said, drawing her to a seat upon his knee, and passing his arm about her waist, \"I'm not ready to part with my little girl yet.\"  \"Wouldn't a fine young lady daughter be just as good or better?\" she asked, giving him a hug.  \"No, not now, some of these days I may think so.\"  \"But mayn't I stay up and read till ten to-night?\"  He shook his head. \"Till half-past nine, then?\"  \"No, not even a till quarter past. Ah, it is that now,\" he added, consulting his watch.  \"You must say good-night and go. Early hours and plenty of sleep for my little girl, that she may grow up to healthful, vigorous womanhood, capable of enjoying life and being very useful in the church and the world.\" He kissed her with grave tenderness as he spoke.  \"Good-night then, you dear father,\" she said, returning the caress. \"I know you would indulge me if you thought it for my good.\"  \"Indeed I would, pet. Would it help to reconcile you to the denial of your wish to know that I shall be reading the book, and probably enjoying it as much as you would?\"  \"Ah yes, indeed, papa! it is a real pleasure to resign it to you,\" she answered with a look of delight. \"It's just the nicest story! at least as far as I've read. Read it aloud to mamma, won't you?\"  \"Yes, if she wishes to hear it. Now away with you to your room and your bed.\"  Only waiting to bid her mamma an affectionate good-night, Elsie obeyed, leaving the room with a light step, and a cheerful, happy face.  \"Dear unselfish child!\" her father said, looking after her.  \"She is that indeed,\" said Rose. \"How happy, shall I be if Horace grows up to be as good and lovable.\"  Elsie was a fearless horsewoman, accustomed to the saddle from her very early years. Thus Arthur's wanton attack upon her pony had failed to give her nerves the severe shock it might have caused to those of most young girls of her age. Her feeling was more of excitement, and of indignation at the uncalled-for cruelty to a dumb animal, especially her own pet horse, than of fright at the danger to herself. But she well knew that the latter was what her father would think of first, and that he would be very angry with Arthur; therefore she had tried, and successfully, to control herself and suppress all signs of agitation on meeting him upon her return.  She felt glad now as the affair recurred to her recollection while preparing for the night's rest, that she had been able to do so. For a moment she questioned with herself whether she was quite right to have this concealment from her father, but quickly decided that she was. Had the wrong-doing been her own--that would have made it altogether another matter.  She was shocked at Arthur's wickedness, troubled and anxious about his future, but freely forgave his crime against her pony and herself, and mingled with her nightly petitions an earnest prayer for his conversion, and his welfare temporal and spiritual.     CHAPTER VI.    O love! thou sternly dost thy power maintain,   And wilt not bear a rival in thy reign.    --DRYDEN.   It was the middle of the forenoon, and Elsie in her own pretty little sitting room was busied with her books; so deep in study indeed, that she never noticed a slight girlish figure as it glided in at the glass doors opening upon the lawn, to-day set wide to admit the air coming fresh and cool with a faint odor of the far-off sea, pleasantly mingling with that of the flowers in the garden, on the other side of the house.  \"Buried alive in her books! Dear me! what a perfect paragon of industry you are,\" cried the intruder in a lively tone. \"I wish you would imbue me with some of your love of study.\"  \"Why, Lucy Carrington! how did you get here?\" and Elsie pushed her books away, rose hastily and greeted her friend with an affectionate embrace.  \"How? I came in through yonder door, miss; after riding my pony from Ashlands to the front entrance of this mansion,\" replied Lucy, courtesying low in mock reverence. \"I hope your ladyship will excuse the liberty I have taken in venturing uninvited into your sanctum.\"  \"Provided your repentance is deep and sincere,\" returned Elsie in the same jesting tone.  \"Certainly, I solemnly pledge myself never to do it again till the next time.\"  \"Sit down, won't you?\" and Elsie pushed forward a low rocking chair. \"It's so pleasant to see you. But if I had thought about it at all I should have supposed you were at home, and as busy over books and lessons as I.\"  \"No; my respected governess, Miss Warren, not feeling very well, has taken a week's holiday, and left me to do the same. Fancy my afflicted state at the thought of laying aside my beloved books for seven or eight whole days.\"  \"You poor creature! how I pity you,\" said Elsie, laughing; \"suppose you stay here and share the instructions of my tutor; I have no doubt I could persuade him to receive you as a pupil.\"  \"Horrors! I'm much obliged, very much, but I should die of fright the first time I had to recite. There, I declare I'm growing poetical, talking in rhyme all the time.\"  \"Let mammy take your hat and scarf,\" said Elsie. \"You'll stay and spend the day with me, won't you?\"  \"Thank you, no; I came to carry you off to Ashlands to spend a week. Will you come?\"  \"I should like to, dearly well, if papa gives permission.\"  \"Well, run and ask him.\"  \"I can't; unfortunately he is out, and not expected to return till tea-time.\"  \"Oh, pshaw! how provoking! But can't your mamma give permission just as well?\"  \"If it were only for a day she might, but I know she would say the question of a longer visit must be referred to papa.\"  \"Dear me! I wouldn't be you for something. Why, I never ask leave of anybody when I want to pay a visit anywhere in the neighborhood. I tell mamma I'm going, and that's all-sufficient. I don't see how you stand being ordered about and controlled so.\"  \"If you'll believe me,\" said Elsie, laughing a gay, sweet, silvery laugh, \"I really enjoy being controlled by papa. It saves me a deal of trouble and responsibility in the way of deciding for myself; and then I love him so dearly that I almost always feel it my greatest pleasure to do whatever pleases him.\"  \"And he always was so strict with you.\"  \"Yes, he is strict; but oh, so kind.\"  \"But that's just because you're so good; he'd have an awful time ruling me. I'd be in a chronic state of disgrace and punishment; and he obliged to be so constantly improving me and frowning sternly upon my delinquencies that he'd never be able to don a smile of approval or slip in a word of praise edgewise.\"  \"Indeed you're not half so bad as you pretend,\" said Elsie, laughing again; \"nor I half so good as you seem determined to believe me.\"  \"No, I've no doubt that you're an arch hypocrite, and we shall find out one of these days that you are really worse than any of the rest of us. But now I must finish my errand and go, for I know you're longing to be at those books. Do you get a ferruling every time you miss a word?--and enjoy the pain because it pleases papa to inflict it?\"  \"Oh, Lucy, how can you be so ridiculous?\" and a quick, vivid blush mounted to Elsie's very hair.  \"I beg your pardon, Elsie, dear, I had no business to say such a thing,\" cried Lucy, springing up to throw her arms round her friend and kiss her warmly; \"but of course it was nothing but the merest nonsense. I know well enough your papa never does anything of the kind.\"  \"No; if my lessons are not well prepared they have to be learned over again, that is all; and if I see that papa is displeased with me, I assure you it is punishment enough.\"  \"Do you think he'll let you accept my invitation?\"  \"I don't know, indeed, Lucy. I think he will hardly like to have me give up my studies for that length of time, and in fact I hardly like to do so myself.\"  \"Oh, you must come. You can practise on my piano every day for an hour or two, if you like. We'll learn some duets. And you can bring your sketch-book and carry it along when we walk or ride, as we shall every day. And we might read some improving books together,--you and Herbert, and I. He is worse again, poor fellow! so that some days he hardly leaves his couch even to limp across the room, and it's partly to cheer him up that we want you to come. There's nothing puts him into better spirits than a sight of your face.\"  \"You don't expect other company?\"  \"No, except on our birthday; but then we're going to have a little party, just of our own set,--we boys and girls that have grown up--or are growing up--together, as one may say. Oh, yes, I want to have Carrie Howard, Mary Leslie, and Enna stay a day or two after the party. Now coax your papa hard, for we must have you,\" she added, rising to go.  \"That would be a sure way to make him say no,\" said Elsie, smiling; \"he never allows me to coax or tease; at least, not after he has once answered my request.\"  \"Then don't think of it.

[Illustration: Plan of home of the Spartan Twins]     I  COMPANY AT THE FARM   One lovely spring morning long years ago in Hellas, Lydia, wife of Melas the Spartan, sat upon a stool in the court of her house, with her wool-basket beside her, spinning. She was a tall, strong-looking young woman with golden hair and blue eyes, and as she twirled her distaff and twisted the white wool between her fingers she sang a little song to herself that sounded like the humming of bees in a garden.  The little court of the house where she sat was open to the sky, and the afternoon sun came pouring over the wall which surrounded it, and made a brilliant patch of light upon the earthen floor. The little stones which were embedded in the earth to form a sort of pavement glistened in the sun and seemed to play at hide and seek with the moving shadow of Lydia's distaff as she spun. On the thatch which covered the arcade around three sides of the court pigeons crooned and preened their feathers, and from a room in the second story of the house, which opened upon a little gallery enclosing the fourth side of the court, came the _clack clack_ of a loom.  As she spun, the shadow of Lydia's distaff grew longer and longer across the floor until at last the sunlight disappeared behind the wall, leaving the whole court in gray shadow.  Under the gallery a large room opened into the court. The embers of a fire glowed dully upon a stone hearth in the center of this room, and beyond, through an open door, fowls could be seen wandering about the farm-yard. Suddenly the quiet of the late afternoon was broken by a medley of sounds. There were the bleating of sheep, and the tinkle of their bells, the lowing of cattle and the barking of a dog, the soft patter of bare feet and the voices of children.  Then there was a sudden squawking among the hens in the farm-yard, and through the back door, past the glowing hearth and into the court, rushed two children, followed by a huge shepherd dog. The children were blue-eyed and golden-haired, like their Mother, and looked so big and strong that they might easily have passed for twelve years of age, though they really were but ten. They were so exactly alike that their Mother herself could hardly tell which was Dion and which was Daphne, and, as for their Father, he didn't even try. He simply said whichever name came first to his lips, feeling quite sure that the children would always be able to tell themselves apart, at any rate. Daphne, to be sure, wore her chiton a little longer than Dion wore his, but when they were running or playing games she often pulled it up shorter through her girdle, so even that was not a sure sign.  Lydia looked from one of them to the other as the children came bounding into the court, with Argos, the dog, barking and leaping about them, and smiled with pride.  \"Where have you been, you wild creatures?\" she said to the twins, \"I haven't seen you since noon,\" and \"Down, Argos, down,\" she cried to the dog, who had put his great paws in her lap and was trying to kiss her on the nose.  \"We've been down in the field by the spring with Father,\" Dion shouted, \"and Father is bringing a man home to supper!\"  \"Company!\" gasped Lydia, throwing up her hands. \"Whoever can it be at this time of the day and in such an out of the way place as this? And nothing but black broth ready for supper! I might have had a roast fowl at least if only I had known. Where are they now?\"  \"They are coming down the road,\" said Dion. \"They stopped to see the sheep and cattle driven into the farm-yard. They'll be here soon.\"  Lydia thrust her distaff into the wool-basket by her side and rose hastily from her stool. \"There's no time to lose,\" she said. \"The Stranger will not wish to linger here if he expects to reach Ambelaca to-night. It is a good two miles to the village, and he'll not find a boat crossing to the mainland after dark. I am sure of that, unlessperhaps he has one waiting for him there.\"  As she spoke, Lydia drew her skirt shorter through her girdle and started for the hearth-fire in the room beyond. \"Shoo,\" she cried to the hens, which had followed the children into the house and were searching hopefully for something to eat among the ashes, \"you'll burn your toes as like as not! Begone, unless you want to be put at once into the pot! Go for them, Argos! Dion, you feed them. They'll be under foot until they've had their supper, and it's time they were on the roost this minute! Daphne, your face is dirty; go wash it, while I get the fire started and see if I can't find something to eat more fitting to set before a guest.\"  While the children ran to carry out their Mother's orders, Lydia herself seized the bellows and blew upon the embers of the fire. \"By all the Gods!\" she cried, \"there's not a stick of wood in the house.\" She dropped the bellows and ran into the court. From the room above still came the _clack clack_ of the loom. Lydia looked up at the gallery of the second story and clapped her hands.  \"Chloe, Chloe,\" she called. The clacking suddenly stopped, and a young girl with black hair and eyes and red cheeks came out of the upper room and leaned over the balcony rail.  \"Did you want me?\" she asked.  \"Indeed I want you!\" answered her mistress. \"Company is coming to supper and there is nothing in the house fit to set before him! Hurry and bring some wood. There's not even a fire!\"  There was a sound of hasty footsteps on the stair, and Chloe disappeared into the farm-yard. In a moment she was back again with a basket of wood, which she placed beside the hearth. Lydia knelt on the floor and laid the wood upon the coals. Then she blew upon them energetically with the bellows. Chloe knelt beside her and blew too, but not with bellows. The ashes flew in every direction.  \"Mercy!\" cried Lydia, \"you've a breath like the blasts of winter! You will blow the sparks clear across the court and set fire to the thatch if you keep on! Come! Get out the oven and start a charcoal fire! We can bake barley-cakes, at least, and there are sausages in the store-room. See if there is fresh water in the water-jar.\"  \"There isn't a drop, I know,\" said Daphne. \"I took the last to wash my face.\"  \"Was there ever anything like it?\" cried Lydia. \"Fresh water first of all! Run at once to the spring, Chloe. I '11 get the oven myself. Daphne, you take the small water-jar and go with Chloe.\"  As Chloe and Daphne, with their water-jars on their shoulders, started out of the back door for the spring, the door at the front of the court opened, and Melas entered with a tall, bearded man wearing a long cloak.  The moment she heard the door move on its hinges, Lydia stood up straight and tall beside her hearth-fire, and, at a sign from her husband, came forward to greet the Stranger.  \"You are welcome,\" she said, \"to such entertainment as our plain house affords. I could wish it were better for your sake.\"  \"I shall be honored by your hospitality,\" said the Stranger politely, \"and what is good enough for a farmer is surely good enough for a philosopher, if I may call myself one.\"  \"Though you are a philosopher, you are also, no doubt, an Athenian,\" replied Lydia, \"and it is known to all the world that the feast of the Spartan is but common fare for those who live delicately as the Athenians do.\"  \"I bring an appetite that would make a feast of bread alone,\" answered the Stranger.  Melas, a tall brown-faced man with a brown beard, now spoke for the first time.  \"There is no haste, wife,\" he said. \"The Stranger will spend the night under our roof. It is not yet late. While you get supper, we will rest beneath the olive trees and watch the sun go down behind the hills.\"  \"Until I can better serve you, then,\" Lydia replied; and the two men went out again through the open door, and sat down upon a wooden bench which commanded a view of the little valley and the hills beyond.  Meanwhile, within doors, Lydia dropped the stately dignity of her company manners and became once more the busy housewife. When Chloe and Daphne returned from the spring, she had barley-cakes baking in the oven, and sausages were roasting before the hearth-fire. A kettle of broth steamed beside it.  \"How good it smells!\" cried Dion, when he came in with Argos from the farm-yard. \"I could eat a whole pig myself. Do cook a lot of sausages, Mother. I am as hungry as a wolf.\"  \"And you a Spartan boy!\" said his Mother reprovingly. \"You should think less of what you put in your stomach! Plain fare makes the strongest men. It is only polite to give a guest the best you have, but that's no excuse for being greedy and wanting to stuff yourself every day.\"  \"Well, then,\" said Dion, \"I wish Hermes, if he is the god who guides travelers, would bring them this way oftener. I'd like to be a strong man, but I like good things to eat, too, "]]]
