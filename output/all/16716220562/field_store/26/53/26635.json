As if that pure and blessed light,       From off the Eternal altar flowing,       Were bathing, in its upward flight,       The spirit to its worship going!        1836.     THE MORAL WARFARE.       WHEN Freedom, on her natal day,      Within her war-rocked cradle lay,      An iron race around her stood,      Baptized her infant brow in blood;      And, through the storm which round her swept,      Their constant ward and watching kept.       Then, where our quiet herds repose,      The roar of baleful battle rose,      And brethren of a common tongue      To mortal strife as tigers sprung,      And every gift on Freedom's shrine      Was man for beast, and blood for wine!       Our fathers to their graves have gone;      Their strife is past, their triumph won;      But sterner trials wait the race      Which rises in their honored place;      A moral warfare with the crime      And folly of an evil time.       So let it be. In God's own might      We gird us for the coming fight,      And, strong in Him whose cause is ours      In conflict with unholy powers,      We grasp the weapons He has given,--      The Light, and Truth, and Love of Heaven.       1836.     RITNER.  Written on reading the Message of Governor Ritner, of Pennsylvania, 1836. The fact redounds to the credit and serves to perpetuate the memory of the independent farmer and high-souled statesman, that he alone of all the Governors of the Union in 1836 met the insulting demands and menaces of the South in a manner becoming a freeman and hater of Slavery, in his message to the Legislature of Pennsylvania.        THANK God for the token! one lip is still free,       One spirit untrammelled, unbending one knee!       Like the oak of the mountain, deep-rooted and firm,       Erect, when the multitude bends to the storm;       When traitors to Freedom, and Honor, and God,       Are bowed at an Idol polluted with blood;       When the recreant North has forgotten her trust,       And the lip of her honor is low in the dust,--       Thank God, that one arm from the shackle has broken!       Thank God, that one man as a freeman has spoken!        O'er thy crags, Alleghany, a blast has been blown!       Down thy tide, Susquehanna, the murmur has gone!       To the land of the South, of the charter and chain,       Of Liberty sweetened with Slavery's pain;       Where the cant of Democracy dwells on the lips       Of the forgers of fetters, and wielders of whips!       Where \"chivalric\" honor means really no more       Than scourging of women, and robbing the poor!       Where the Moloch of Slavery sitteth on high,       And the words which he utters, are--Worship, or die!        Right onward, oh, speed it! Wherever the blood       Of the wronged and the guiltless is crying to God;       Wherever a slave in his fetters is pining;       Wherever the lash of the driver is twining;       Wherever from kindred, torn rudely apart,       Comes the sorrowful wail of the broken of heart;       Wherever the shackles of tyranny bind,       In silence and darkness, the God-given mind;       There, God speed it onward! its truth will be felt,       The bonds shall be loosened, the iron shall melt.        And oh, will the land where the free soul of Penn       Still lingers and breathes over mountain and glen;       Will the land where a Benezet's spirit went forth       To the peeled and the meted, and outcast of Earth;       Where the words of the Charter of Liberty first       From the soul of the sage and the patriot burst;       Where first for the wronged and the weak of their kind,       The Christian and statesman their efforts combined;       Will that land of the free and the good wear a chain?       Will the call to the rescue of Freedom be vain?        No, Ritner! her \"Friends\" at thy warning shall stand       Erect for the truth, like their ancestral band;       Forgetting the feuds and the strife of past time,       Counting coldness injustice, and silence a crime;       Turning back front the cavil of creeds, to unite       Once again for the poor in defence of the Right;       Breasting calmly, but firmly, the full tide of Wrong,       Overwhelmed, but not borne on its surges along;       Unappalled by the danger, the shame, and the pain,       And counting each trial for Truth as their gain!        And that bold-hearted yeomanry, honest and true,       Who, haters of fraud, give to labor its due;       Whose fathers, of old, sang in concert with thine,       On the banks of Swetara, the songs of the Rhine,--       The German-born pilgrims, who first dared to brave       The scorn of the proud in the cause of the slave;       Will the sons of such men yield the lords of the South       One brow for the brand, for the padlock one mouth?       They cater to tyrants? They rivet the chain,       Which their fathers smote off, on the negro again?        No, never! one voice, like the sound in the cloud,       When the roar of the storm waxes loud and more loud,       Wherever the foot of the freeman hath pressed       From the Delaware's marge to the Lake of the West,       On the South-going breezes shall deepen and grow       Till the land it sweeps over shall tremble below!       The voice of a people, uprisen, awake,       Pennsylvania's watchword, with Freedom at stake,       Thrilling up from each valley, flung down from each height,       \"Our Country and Liberty! God for the Right!\"     THE PASTORAL LETTER  The General Association of Congregational ministers in Massachusetts met at Brookfield, June 27, 1837, and issued a Pastoral Letter to the churches under its care. The immediate occasion of it was the profound sensation produced by the recent public lecture in Massachusetts by Angelina and Sarah Grimke, two noble women from South Carolina, who bore their testimony against slavery. The Letter demanded that \"the perplexed and agitating subjects which are now common amongst us... should not be forced upon any church as matters for debate, at the hazard of alienation and division,\" and called attention to the dangers now seeming \"to threaten the female character with widespread and permanent injury.\"       So, this is all,--the utmost reach      Of priestly power the mind to fetter!      When laymen think, when women preach,      A war of words, a \"Pastoral Letter!\"      Now, shame upon ye, parish Popes!      Was it thus with those, your predecessors,      Who sealed with racks, and fire, and ropes      Their loving-kindness to transgressors?       A \"Pastoral Letter,\" grave and dull;      Alas! in hoof and horns and features,      How different is your Brookfield bull      From him who bellows from St. Peter's      Your pastoral rights and powers from harm,      Think ye, can words alone preserve them?      Your wiser fathers taught the arm      And sword of temporal power to serve them.       Oh, glorious days, when Church and State      Were wedded by your spiritual fathers!      And on submissive shoulders sat      Your Wilsons and your Cotton Mathers.      No vile \"itinerant\" then could mar      The beauty of your tranquil Zion,      But at his peril of the scar      Of hangman's whip and branding-iron.       Then, wholesome laws relieved the Church      Of heretic and mischief-maker,      And priest and bailiff joined in search,      By turns, of Papist, witch, and Quaker      The stocks were at each church's door,      The gallows stood on Boston Common,      A Papist's ears the pillory bore,--      The gallows-rope, a Quaker woman!       Your fathers dealt not as ye deal      With \"non-professing\" frantic teachers;      They bored the tongue with red-hot steel,      And flayed the backs of \"female preachers.\"      Old Hampton, had her fields a tongue,      And Salem's streets could tell their story,      Of fainting woman dragged along,      Gashed by the whip accursed and gory!       And will ye ask me, why this taunt      Of memories sacred from the scorner?      And why with reckless hand I plant      A nettle on the graves ye honor?      Not to reproach New England's dead      This record from the past I summon,      Of manhood to the scaffold led,      And suffering and heroic woman.       No, for yourselves alone, I turn      The pages of intolerance over,      That, in their spirit, dark and stern,      Ye haply may your own discover!      For, if ye claim the \"pastoral right\"      To silence Freedom's voice of warning,      And from your precincts shut the light      Of Freedom's day around ye dawning;       If when an earthquake voice of power      And signs in earth and heaven are showing      That forth, in its appointed hour,      The Spirit of the Lord is going      And, with that Spirit, Freedom's light      On kindred, tongue, and people breaking,      Whose slumbering millions, at the sight,      In glory and in strength are waking!       When for the sighing of the poor,      And for the needy, God bath risen,      And chains are breaking, and a door      Is opening for the souls in prison!      If then ye would, with puny hands,      Arrest the very work of Heaven,      And bind anew the evil bands      Which God's right arm of power hath riven;       What marvel that, in many a mind,      Those darker deeds of bigot madness      Are closely with your own combined,      Yet \"less in anger than in sadness\"?      What marvel, if the people learn      To claim the right of free opinion?      What marvel, if at times they spurn      The ancient yoke of your dominion?       A glorious remnant linger yet,      Whose lips are wet at Freedom's fountains,      The coming of whose welcome feet      Is beautiful upon our mountains!      Men, who the gospel tidings bring      Of Liberty and Love forever,      Whose joy is an abiding spring,      Whose peace is as a gentle river!

Oh, ever may the power which led      Their way to such a fiery trial,      And strengthened womanhood to tread      The wine-press of such self-denial,      Be round them in an evil land,      With wisdom and with strength from Heaven,      With Miriam's voice, and Judith's hand,      And Deborah's song, for triumph given!       And what are ye who strive with God      Against the ark of His salvation,      Moved by the breath of prayer abroad,      With blessings for a dying nation?

THE FAREWELL OF A VIRGINIA SLAVE MOTHER TO HER DAUGHTERS SOLD  INTO SOUTHERN BONDAGE.       GONE, gone,--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone.      Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings,      Where the noisome insect stings,      Where the fever demon strews      Poison with the falling dews,      Where the sickly sunbeams glare      Through the hot and misty air;      Gone, gone,--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone,      From Virginia's hills and waters;      Woe is me, my stolen daughters!       Gone, gone,--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone.      There no mother's eye is near them,      There no mother's ear can hear them;      Never, when the torturing lash      Seams their back with many a gash,      Shall a mother's kindness bless them,      Or a mother's arms caress them.      Gone, gone,--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone,      From Virginia's hills and waters;      Woe is me, my stolen daughters!       Gone, gone,--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone.      Oh, when weary, sad, and slow,      From the fields at night they go,      Faint with toil, and racked with pain,      To their cheerless homes again,      There no brother's voice shall greet them;      There no father's welcome meet them.      Gone, gone,--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone,      From Virginia's hills and waters;      Woe is me, my stolen daughters!       Gone, gone,--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone.      From the tree whose shadow lay      On their childhood's place of play;      From the cool spring where they drank;      Rock, and hill, and rivulet bank;      From the solemn house of prayer,      And the holy counsels there;      Gone, gone,--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone,      From Virginia's hills and waters;      Woe is me, my stolen daughters!       Gone, gone,--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone;      Toiling through the weary day,      And at night the spoiler's prey.

By the holy love He beareth;      By the bruised reed He spareth;      Oh, may He, to whom alone      All their cruel wrongs are known,      Still their hope and refuge prove,      With a more than mother's love.      Gone, gone,--sold and gone,      To the rice-swamp dank and lone,      From Virginia's hills and waters;      Woe is me, my stolen daughters!       1838.     PENNSYLVANIA HALL.  Read at the dedication of Pennsylvania Hall, Philadelphia, May 15, 1838. The building was erected by an association of gentlemen, irrespective of sect or party, \"that the citizens of Philadelphia should possess a room wherein the principles of Liberty, and Equality of Civil Rights, could be freely discussed, and the evils of slavery fearlessly portrayed.\" On the evening of the 17th it was burned by a mob, destroying the office of the Pennsylvania Freeman, of which I was editor, and with it my books and papers.        NOT with the splendors of the days of old,      The spoil of nations, and barbaric gold;      No weapons wrested from the fields of blood,      Where dark and stern the unyielding Roman stood,      And the proud eagles of his cohorts saw      A world, war-wasted, crouching to his law;       Nor blazoned car, nor banners floating gay,      Like those which swept along the Appian Way,      When, to the welcome of imperial Rome,      The victor warrior came in triumph home,      And trumpet peal, and shoutings wild and high,      Stirred the blue quiet of the Italian sky;      But calm and grateful, prayerful and sincere,      As Christian freemen only, gathering here,      We dedicate our fair and lofty Hall,      Pillar and arch, entablature and wall,      As Virtue's shrine, as Liberty's abode,      Sacred to Freedom, and to Freedom's God      Far statelier Halls, 'neath brighter skies than these,      Stood darkly mirrored in the AEgean seas,      Pillar and shrine, and life-like statues seen,      Graceful and pure, the marble shafts between;      Where glorious Athens from her rocky hill      Saw Art and Beauty subject to her will;      And the chaste temple, and the classic grove,      The hall of sages, and the bowers of love,      Arch, fane, and column, graced the shores, and gave      Their shadows to the blue Saronic wave;      And statelier rose, on Tiber's winding side,      The Pantheon's dome, the Coliseum's pride,      The Capitol, whose arches backward flung      The deep, clear cadence of the Roman tongue,      Whence stern decrees, like words of fate, went forth      To the awed nations of a conquered earth,      Where the proud Caesars in their glory came,      And Brutus lightened from his lips of flame!      Yet in the porches of Athena's halls,      And in the shadow of her stately walls,      Lurked the sad bondman, and his tears of woe      Wet the cold marble with unheeded flow;      And fetters clanked beneath the silver dome      Of the proud Pantheon of imperious Rome.      Oh, not for hint, the chained and stricken slave,      By Tiber's shore, or blue AEgina's wave,      In the thronged forum, or the sages' seat,      The bold lip pleaded, and the warm heart beat;      No soul of sorrow melted at his pain,      No tear of pity rusted on his chain!       But this fair Hall to Truth and Freedom given,      Pledged to the Right before all Earth and Heaven,      A free arena for the strife of mind,      To caste, or sect, or color unconfined,      Shall thrill with echoes such as ne'er of old      From Roman hall or Grecian temple rolled;      Thoughts shall find utterance such as never yet      The Propylea or the Forum met.      Beneath its roof no gladiator's strife      Shall win applauses with the waste of life;      No lordly lictor urge the barbarous game,      No wanton Lais glory in her shame.      But here the tear of sympathy shall flow,      As the ear listens to the tale of woe;      Here in stern judgment of the oppressor's wrong      Shall strong"]]]
