Seven days were gone,   when the rains descended, and in the deep of the night the river rose and   engulfed the leopard family in their beds. \"Woe is me,\" sighed the   leopard, \"that I did not listen to my wife.\" And he died before his time.   THE JOURNEY BEGUN BY JOSEPH AND ENAN  The author has now finished his protest against his visitor's design, to make him join him on a roving expedition. Enan glares, and asks, \"Am I a fox, and thou a leopard, that I should fear thee?\" Then his note changes, and his tone becomes coaxing and bland. Joseph cannot resist his fascination. Together they start, riding on their asses. Then says Enan unto Joseph, \"Carry thou me, or I will carry thee.\" \"But,\" continues the narrator, Joseph, \"we were both riding on our asses. 'What dost thou mean? Our asses carry us both. Explain thy words.'--'It is the story of the peasant with the king's officer.'\"   THE CLEVER GIRL AND THE KING'S DREAM    A king with many wives dreamt that he saw a monkey among them; his face   fell, and his spirit was troubled. \"This is none other,\" said he, \"than a   foreign king, who will invade my realm, and take my harem for his spoil.\"   One of his officers told the king of a clever interpreter of dreams, and   the king despatched him to find out the meaning of his ominous vision. He   set forth on his mule, and met a countryman riding. \"Carry me,\" said the   officer, \"or I will carry thee.\" The peasant was amazed. \"But our asses   carry us both,\" he said. \"Thou tiller of the earth,\" said the officer,   \"thou art earth, and eatest earth. There is snow on the hill,\" continued   the officer, and as the month was Tammuz, the peasant laughed. They   passed a road with wheat growing on each side. \"A horse blind in one eye   has passed here,\" said the officer, \"loaded with oil on one side, and   with vinegar on the other.\" They saw a field richly covered with   abounding corn, and the peasant praised it. \"Yes,\" said the officer, \"if   the corn is not already eaten.\" They went on a little further and saw a   lofty tower. \"Well fortified,\" remarked the peasant. \"Fortified without,   if not ruined within,\" replied the officer. A funeral passed them. \"As to   this old man whom they are burying,\" said the officer, \"I cannot tell   whether he is alive or dead.\" And the peasant thought his companion mad   to make such unintelligible remarks. They neared a village where the   peasant lived, and he invited the officer to stay with him overnight.    The peasant, in the dead of the night, told his wife and daughters of the   foolish things the officer had said, though he looked quite wise. \"Nay,\"   said the peasant's youngest daughter, a maiden of fifteen years, \"the man   is no fool; thou didst not comprehend the depth of his meaning. The   tiller of the earth eats food grown from the earth. By the 'snow on the   hill' is meant thy white beard (on thy head); thou shouldst have   answered, 'Time caused it.' The horse blind in one eye he knew had   passed, because he saw that the wheat was eaten on one side of the way,   and not on the other; and as for its burden, he saw that the vinegar had   parched the dust, while the oil had not. His saying, 'Carry me, or I will   carry thee,' signifies that he who beguiles the way with stories and   proverbs and riddles, carries his companion, relieving him from the   tedium of the journey. The corn of the field you passed,\" continued the   girl, \"was already eaten if the owner was poor, and had sold it before it   was reaped. The lofty and stately tower was in ruins within, if it was   without necessary stores. About the funeral, too, his remark was true. If   the old man left a son, he was still alive; if he was childless, he was,   indeed, dead.\"    In the morning, the girl asked her father to give the officer the food   she would prepare. She gave him thirty eggs, a dish full of milk, and a   whole loaf. \"Tell me,\" said she, \"how many days old the month is; is the   moon new, and the sun at its zenith?\" Her father ate two eggs, a little   of the loaf, and sipped some of the milk, and gave the rest to the   officer. \"Tell thy daughter,\" he said, \"the sun is not full, neither is   the moon, for the month is two days old.\" \"Ah,\" laughed the peasant, as   he told his daughter the answers of the officer, \"ah, my girl, I told you   he was a fool, for we are now in the middle of the month.\" \"Did you eat   anything of what I gave you?\" asked the girl of her father. And he told   her of the two eggs, the morsel of bread, and the sip of milk that he had   taken. \"Now I know,\" said the girl, \"of a surety that the man is very   wise.\" And the officer, too, felt that she was wise, and so he told her   the king's dream. She went back with him to the king, for she told the   officer that she could interpret the vision, but would do so only to the   king in person, not through a deputy. \"Search thy harem,\" said the girl,   \"and thou wilt find among thy women a man disguised in female garb.\" He   searched, and found that her words were true. The man was slain, and the   women, too, and the peasant's daughter became the king's sole queen, for   he never took another wife besides her.   THE NIGHT'S REST  Thus Joseph and the giant Enan journey on, and they stay overnight in a village inn. Then commences a series of semi-medical wrangles, which fill up a large portion of the book. Joseph demands food and wine, and Enan gives him a little of the former and none of the latter. \"Be still,\" says Enan, \"too much food is injurious to a traveller weary from the way. But you cannot be so very hungry, or you would fall to on the dry bread. But wine with its exciting qualities is bad for one heated by a long day's ride.\" Even their asses are starved, and Joseph remarks sarcastically, \"Tomorrow it will be, indeed, a case of carry-thou-me-or-I-thee, for our asses will not be able to bear us.\" They sleep on the ground, without couch or cover. At dawn Enan rouses him, and when he sees that his ass is still alive, he exclaims, \"Man and beast thou savest, O Lord!\" The ass, by the way, is a lineal descendant of Balaam's animal.  They proceed, and the asses nod and bow as though they knew how to pray. Enan weeps as they near a town. \"Here,\" says he, \"my dear friend died, a man of wisdom and judgment. I will tell thee a little of his cleverness.\"   THE DISHONEST SINGER AND THE WEDDING ROBES    A man once came to him crying in distress. His only daughter was   betrothed to a youth, and the bridegroom and his father came to the   bride's house on the eve of the wedding, to view her ornaments and   beautiful clothes. When the bride's parents rose next day, everything had   vanished, jewels and trousseau together. They were in despair, for they   had lavished all their possessions on their daughter. My friend   [continued Enan] went back with the man to examine the scene of the   robbery. The walls of the house were too high to scale. He found but one   place where entry was possible, a crevice in a wall in which an orange   tree grew, and its edge was covered with thorns and prickles. Next door   lived a musician, Paltiel ben Agan [or Adan] by name, and my late friend,   the judge, interviewed him, and made him strip. His body was covered with   cuts and scratches; his guilt was discovered, and the dowry returned to   the last shoe-latchet. \"My son,\" said he, \"beware of singers, for they   are mostly thieves; trust no word of theirs, for they are liars; they   dally with women, and long after other people's money. They fancy they   are clever, but they know not their left hand from their right; they   raise their hands all day and call, but know not to whom. A singer stands   at his post, raised above all other men, and he thinks he is as lofty as   his place. He constantly emits sounds, which mount to his brain, and dry   it up; hence he is so witless.\"  Then Enan tells Joseph another story of his friend the judge's sagacity:   THE NOBLEMAN AND THE NECKLACE    A man lived in Cordova, Jacob by name, the broker; he was a man of tried   honesty. Once a jewelled necklet was entrusted to him for sale by the   judge, the owner demanding five hundred pieces of gold as its price.   Jacob had the chain in his hand when he met a nobleman, one of the king's   intimate friends. The nobleman offered four hundred pieces for the   necklet, which Jacob refused. \"Come with me to my house, and I will   consider the price,\" said the would-be purchaser. The Jew accompanied him   home, and the nobleman went within. Jacob waited outside the gate till   the evening, but no one came out. He passed a sleepless night with his   wife and children, and next morning returned to the nobleman. \"Buy the   necklace,\" said he, \"or return it.\" The nobleman denied all knowledge of   the jewels, so Jacob went to the judge. He sent for the nobles, to   address them as was his wont, and as soon as they had arrived, he said to   the thief's servant, \"Take your master's shoe and go to his wife. Show   the shoe and say, Your lord bids me ask you for the necklace he bought   yesterday, as he wishes to exhibit its beauty to his friends.\" The wife   gave the servant the ornament, the theft was made manifest, and it was   restored to its rightful owner.   And Enan goes on:  THE SON AND THE SLAVE    A merchant of measureless wealth had an only son, who, when he grew up,   said, \"Father, send me on a voyage, that I may trade and see foreign   lands, and talk with men of wisdom, to learn from their words.\" The   father purchased a ship, and sent him on a voyage, with much wealth and   many friends. The father was left at home with his slave, in whom he put   his trust, and who filled his son's place in position and affection.   Suddenly a pain seized him in the heart, and he died without directing   how his property was to be divided. The slave took possession of   everything; no one in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9886"],["title","The Book of Delight and Other Papers (#5)"],["body","knew whether he was the man's slave or his   son. Ten years passed, and the real son returned, with his ship laden   with wealth. As they approached the harbor, the ship was wrecked. They   had cast everything overboard, in a vain effort to save it; finally, the   crew and the passengers were all thrown into the sea. The son reached the   shore destitute, and returned to his father's house; but the slave drove   him away, denying his identity. They went before the judge. \"Find the   loathly merchant's grave,\" he said to the slave, \"and bring me the dead   man's bones. I shall burn them for his neglect to leave a will, thus   rousing strife as to his property.\" The slave started to obey, but the   son stayed him. \"Keep all,\" said he, \"but disturb not my father's bones.\"   \"Thou art the son,\" said the judge; \"take this other as thy lifelong   slave.\"   Joseph and Enan pass to the city of Tobiah. At the gate they are accosted by an old and venerable man, to whom they explain that they have been on the way for seven days. He invites them to his home, treats them hospitably, and after supper tells them sweet and pleasant tales, \"among his words an incident wonderful to the highest degree.\" This wonderful story is none other than a distorted version of the Book of Tobit. I have translated this in full, and in rhymed prose, as a specimen of the original.   THE STORY OF TOBIT    Here, in the days of the saints of old, in the concourse of elders of age   untold, there lived a man upright and true, in all his doings good   fortune he knew. Rich was he and great, his eyes looked ever straight:   Tobiah, the son of Ahiah, a man of Dan, helped the poor, to each gave of   his store; whene'er one friendless died, the shroud he supplied, bore the   corpse to the grave, nor thought his money to save. The men of the place,   a sin-ruled race, slandering, cried, \"O King, these Jewish knaves open   our graves! Our bones they burn, into charms to turn, health to earn.\"   The king angrily spoke: \"I will weighten their yoke, and their villainy   repay; all the Jews who, from to-day, die in this town, to the pit take   down, to the pit hurry all, without burial. Who buries a Jew, the hour   shall rue; bitter his pang, on the gallows shall he hang.\" Soon a   sojourner did die, and no friends were by; but good Tobiah the corpse did   lave, and dress it for the grave. Some sinners saw the deed, to the judge   the word they gave, who Tobiah's death decreed. Forth the saint they   draw, to hang him as by law. But now they near the tree, lo! no man can   see, a blindness falls on all, and Tobiah flies their thrall. Many   friends his loss do weep, but homewards he doth creep, God's mercies to   narrate, and his own surprising fate, \"Praise ye the Lord, dear friends,   for His mercy never ends, and to His servants good intends.\" Fear the   king distressed, his heart beat at his breast, new decrees his fear   expressed. \"Whoe'er a Jew shall harm,\" the king cried in alarm, \"touching   his person or personalty, touches the apple of my eye; let no man do this   wrong, or I'll hang him 'mid the throng, high though his rank, and his   lineage long.\" And well he kept his word, he punished those who erred;   but on the Jews his mercies shone, the while he rilled the throne.    Once lay the saint at rest, and glanced upon the nest of a bird within   his room. Ah! cruel was his doom! Into his eye there went the sparrow's   excrement. Tobiah's sight was gone! He had an only son, whom thus he now   addressed: \"When business ventures pressed, I passed from clime to clime.   Well I recall the time, when long I dwelt in Ind, of wealth full stores   to find. But perilous was the road, and entrusted I my load with one of   honest fame, Peër Hazeman his name. And now list, beloved son, go out and   hire thee one, thy steps forthwith to guide unto my old friend's side. I   know his love's full stream, his trust he will redeem; when heareth he my   plight, when seeth he thy sight, then will he do the right.\" The youth   found whom he sought, a man by travel taught, the ways of Ind he knew; he   knew them through and through, he knew them up and down, as a townsman   knows his town. He brought him to his sire, who straightway did inquire,   \"Knowest thou an Indian spot, a city named Tobot?\"--\"Full well I know the   place, I spent a two years' space in various enterprise; its people all   are wise, and honest men and true.\"--\"What must I give to you,\" asked   Tobiah of his guest,\" to take my son in quest?\"--\"Of pieces pure of   gold, full fifty must be told.\"--\"I'll pay you that with joy; start forth   now with my boy.\" A script the son did write, which Tobiah did indite,   and on his son bestow a sign his friend would know. The father kissed his   son, \"In peace,\" said he, \"get gone; may God my life maintain till thou   art come again.\" The youth and guide to Tobot hied, and reached anon Peër   Hazeman. \"Why askest thou my name?\" Straight the answer came, \"Tobiah is   my sire, and he doth inquire of thy health and thy household's.\" Then the   letter he unfolds. The contents Peër espies, every doubt flies, he   regards the token with no word spoken. \"'Tis the son of my friend, who   greeting thus doth send. Is it well with him? Say.\"--\"Well, well with him   alway.\"--\"Then dwell thou here a while, and hours sweet beguile with the   tales which thou wilt tell of him I loved so well.\"--\"Nay, I must   forthwith part to soothe my father's heart. I am his only trust, return   at once I must.\" Peër Hazeman agrees the lad to release; gives him all   his father's loan, and gifts adds of his own, raiment and two slaves. To   music's pleasant staves, the son doth homeward wend. By the shore of the   sea went the lad full of glee, and the wind blew a blast, and a fish was   upward cast. Then hastened the guide to ope the fish's side, took the   liver and the gall, for cure of evil's thrall: liver to give demons   flight, gall to restore men's sight. The youth begged his friend these   specifics to lend, then went he on his way to where his sick sire lay.   Then spake the youth to his father all the truth. \"Send not away the   guide without pay.\" The son sought the man, through the city he ran, but   the man had disappeared. Said Tobiah, \"Be not afeared, 'twas Elijah the   seer, whom God sent here to stand by our side, our needs to provide.\" He   bathed both his eyes with the gall of the prize, and his sight was   restored by the grace of the Lord.    Then said he to his son, \"Now God His grace has shown, dost thou not   yearn to do a deed in turn? My niece forthwith wed.\"--\"But her husbands   three are dead, each gave up his life as each made her his wife; to her   shame and to her sorrow, they survived not to the morrow.\"--\"Nay, a demon   is the doer of this harm to every wooer. My son, obey my wish, take the   liver of the fish, and burn it in full fume, at the door of her   room,'twill give the demon his doom.\" At his father's command, with his   life in his hand, the youth sought the maid, and wedded her unafraid. For   long timid hours his prayer Tobiah pours; but the incense was alight, the   demon took to flight, and safe was all the night. Long and happily wed,   their lives sweetly sped.  Their entertainer tells Joseph and Enan another story of piety connected with the burial of the dead:   THE PARALYTICS TOUCHSTONE OF VIRTUE    Once upon a time there lived a saintly man, whose abode was on the way to   the graveyard. Every funeral passed his door, and he would ever rise and   join in the procession, and assist those engaged in the burial. In his   old age his feet were paralyzed, and he could not leave his bed; the dead   passed his doors, and he sighed that he could not rise to display his   wonted respect. Then prayed he to the Lord: \"O Lord, who givest eyes to   the blind and feet to the lame, hear me from the corner of my sorrowful   bed. Grant that when a pious man is borne to his grave, I may be able to   rise to my feet.\" An angel's voice in a vision answered him, \"Lo, thy   prayer is heard.\" And so, whenever a pious man was buried, he rose and   prayed for his soul. On a day, there died one who had grown old in the   world's repute, a man of excellent piety, yet the lame man could not rise   as his funeral passed. Next day died a quarrelsome fellow of ill fame for   his notorious sins, and when his body was carried past the lame man's   door, the paralytic was able to stand. Every one was amazed, for hitherto   the lame man's rising or resting had been a gauge of the departed's   virtue. Two sage men resolved to get to the bottom of the mystery. They   interviewed the wife of the fellow who had died second. The wife   confirmed the worst account of him, but added: \"He had an old father,   aged one hundred years, and he honored and served him. Every day he   kissed his hand, gave him drink, stripped and dressed him when, from old   age, he could not turn himself on his couch; daily he brought ox and lamb   bones, from which he drew the marrow, and made dainty foods of it.\" And   the people knew that honoring his father had atoned for his   transgressions. Then the two inquisitors went to the house of the pious   man, before whom the paralytic had been unable to rise. His widow gave   him an excellent character; he was gentle and pious; prayed three times a   day, and at midnight rose and went to a special chamber to say his   prayers. No one had ever seen the room but himself, as he ever kept the   key in his bosom. The two inquisitors opened the door of this chamber,   and found a small box hidden in the window-sill; they opened the box, and   found in it a golden figure bearing a crucifix. Thus the man had been one   of those who do the deeds of Zimri, and expect the reward of Phineas.   TABLE TALK  Joseph and Enan then retire to rest, and their sleep is sweet and long. By strange and devious ways they continue their journey on the morrow, starting"]]]
