[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/972"],["title","The Devil's Dictionary (#2)"],["body","remarkable for the violence of the sympathies and antipathies it excites in others, itself without sentiment or emotion. There have been famous babes; for example, little Moses, from whose adventure in the bulrushes the Egyptian hierophants of seven centuries before doubtless derived their idle tale of the child Osiris being preserved on a floating lotus leaf.            Ere babes were invented           The girls were contended.           Now man is tormented   Until to buy babes he has squandered   His money.  And so I have pondered           This thing, and thought may be           'T were better that Baby   The First had been eagled or condored.  Ro Amil   BACCHUS, n.  A convenient deity invented by the ancients as an excuse for getting drunk.    Is public worship, then, a sin,       That for devotions paid to Bacchus   The lictors dare to run us in,       And resolutely thump and whack us?  Jorace   BACK, n.  That part of your friend which it is your privilege to contemplate in your adversity.  BACKBITE, v.t.  To speak of a man as you find him when he can't find you.  BAIT, n.  A preparation that renders the hook more palatable.  The best kind is beauty.  BAPTISM, n.  A sacred rite of such efficacy that he who finds himself in heaven without having undergone it will be unhappy forever.  It is performed with water in two ways--by immersion, or plunging, and by aspersion, or sprinkling.    But whether the plan of immersion   Is better than simple aspersion       Let those immersed       And those aspersed   Decide by the Authorized Version,   And by matching their agues tertian.  G.J.   BAROMETER, n.  An ingenious instrument which indicates what kind of weather we are having.  BARRACK, n.  A house in which soldiers enjoy a portion of that of which it is their business to deprive others.  BASILISK, n.  The cockatrice.  A sort of serpent hatched from the egg of a cock.  The basilisk had a bad eye, and its glance was fatal. Many infidels deny this creature's existence, but Semprello Aurator saw and handled one that had been blinded by lightning as a punishment for having fatally gazed on a lady of rank whom Jupiter loved.  Juno afterward restored the reptile's sight and hid it in a cave.  Nothing is so well attested by the ancients as the existence of the basilisk, but the cocks have stopped laying.  BASTINADO, n.  The act of walking on wood without exertion.  BATH, n.  A kind of mystic ceremony substituted for religious worship, with what spiritual efficacy has not been determined.    The man who taketh a steam bath   He loseth all the skin he hath,   And, for he's boiled a brilliant red,   Thinketh to cleanliness he's wed,   Forgetting that his lungs he's soiling   With dirty vapors of the boiling.  Richard Gwow   BATTLE, n.  A method of untying with the teeth of a political knot that would not yield to the tongue.  BEARD, n.  The hair that is commonly cut off by those who justly execrate the absurd Chinese custom of shaving the head.  BEAUTY, n.  The power by which a woman charms a lover and terrifies a husband.  BEFRIEND, v.t.  To make an ingrate.  BEG, v.  To ask for something with an earnestness proportioned to the belief that it will not be given.    Who is that, father?                         A mendicant, child,   Haggard, morose, and unaffable--wild!   See how he glares through the bars of his cell!   With Citizen Mendicant all is not well.    Why did they put him there, father?                                         Because   Obeying his belly he struck at the laws.    His belly?                Oh, well, he was starving, my boy--   A state in which, doubtless, there's little of joy.   No bite had he eaten for days, and his cry   Was \"Bread!\" ever \"Bread!\"                                What's the matter with pie?    With little to wear, he had nothing to sell;   To beg was unlawful--improper as well.    Why didn't he work?                         He would even have done that,   But men said:  \"Get out!\" and the State remarked:  \"Scat!\"   I mention these incidents merely to show   That the vengeance he took was uncommonly low.   Revenge, at the best, is the act of a Siou,   But for trifles--                        Pray what did bad Mendicant do?    Stole two loaves of bread to replenish his lack   And tuck out the belly that clung to his back.    Is that _all_ father dear?                                There's little to tell:   They sent him to jail, and they'll send him to--well,   The company's better than here we can boast,   And there's--                    Bread for the needy, dear father?                                                       Um--toast.  Atka Mip   BEGGAR, n.  One who has relied on the assistance of his friends.  BEHAVIOR, n.  Conduct, as determined, not by principle, but by breeding.  The word seems to be somewhat loosely used in Dr. Jamrach Holobom's translation of the following lines from the _Dies Irae_:        Recordare, Jesu pie,       Quod sum causa tuae viae.       Ne me perdas illa die.    Pray remember, sacred Savior,   Whose the thoughtless hand that gave your   Death-blow.  Pardon such behavior.  BELLADONNA, n.  In Italian a beautiful lady; in English a deadly poison.  A striking example of the essential identity of the two tongues.  BENEDICTINES, n.  An order of monks otherwise known as black friars.    She thought it a crow, but it turn out to be       A monk of St. Benedict croaking a text.   \"Here's one of an order of cooks,\" said she--       \"Black friars in this world, fried black in the next.\"  \"The Devil on Earth\" (London, 1712)   BENEFACTOR, n.  One who makes heavy purchases of ingratitude, without, however, materially affecting the price, which is still within the means of all.  BERENICE'S HAIR, n.  A constellation (_Coma Berenices_) named in honor of one who sacrificed her hair to save her husband.    Her locks an ancient lady gave   Her loving husband's life to save;   And men--they honored so the dame--   Upon some stars bestowed her name.    But to our modern married fair,   Who'd give their lords to save their hair,   No stellar recognition's given.   There are not stars enough in heaven.  G.J.   BIGAMY, n.  A mistake in taste for which the wisdom of the future will adjudge a punishment called trigamy.  BIGOT, n.  One who is obstinately and zealously attached to an opinion that you do not entertain.  BILLINGSGATE, n.  The invective of an opponent.  BIRTH, n.  The first and direst of all disasters.  As to the nature of it there appears to be no uniformity.  Castor and Pollux were born from the egg.  Pallas came out of a skull.  Galatea was once a block of stone.  Peresilis, who wrote in the tenth century, avers that he grew up out of the ground where a priest had spilled holy water.  It is known that Arimaxus was derived from a hole in the earth, made by a stroke of lightning.  Leucomedon was the son of a cavern in Mount Aetna, and I have myself seen a man come out of a wine cellar.  BLACKGUARD, n.  A man whose qualities, prepared for display like a box of berries in a market--the fine ones on top--have been opened on the wrong side.  An inverted gentleman.  BLANK-VERSE, n.  Unrhymed iambic pentameters--the most difficult kind of English verse to write acceptably; a kind, therefore, much affected by those who cannot acceptably write any kind.  BODY-SNATCHER, n.  A robber of grave-worms.  One who supplies the young physicians with that with which the old physicians have supplied the undertaker.  The hyena.    \"One night,\" a doctor said, \"last fall,   I and my comrades, four in all,       When visiting a graveyard stood   Within the shadow of a wall.    \"While waiting for the moon to sink   We saw a wild hyena slink       About a new-made grave, and then   Begin to excavate its brink!    \"Shocked by the horrid act, we made   A sally from our ambuscade,       And, falling on the unholy beast,   Dispatched him with a pick and spade.\"  Bettel K. Jhones   BONDSMAN, n.  A fool who, having property of his own, undertakes to become responsible for that entrusted to another to a third.  Philippe of Orleans wishing to appoint one of his favorites, a dissolute nobleman, to a high office, asked him what security he would be able to give.  \"I need no bondsmen,\" he replied, \"for I can give you my word of honor.\"  \"And pray what may be the value of that?\" inquired the amused Regent.  \"Monsieur, it is worth its weight in gold.\"  BORE, n.  A person who talks when you wish him to listen.  BOTANY, n.  The science of vegetables--those that are not good to eat, as well as those that are.  It deals largely with their flowers, which are commonly badly designed, inartistic in color, and ill-smelling.  BOTTLE-NOSED, adj.  Having a nose created in the image of its maker.  BOUNDARY, n.  In political geography, an imaginary line between two nations, separating the imaginary rights of one from the imaginary rights of the other.  BOUNTY, n.  The liberality of one who has much, in permitting one who has nothing to get all that he can.        A single swallow, it is said, devours ten millions of insects   every year.  The supplying of these insects I take to be a signal   instance of the Creator's bounty in providing for the lives of His   creatures.  Henry Ward Beecher   BRAHMA, n.  He who created the Hindoos, who are preserved by Vishnu and destroyed by Siva--a rather neater division of labor than is found among the deities of some other nations.  The Abracadabranese, for example, are created by Sin, maintained by Theft and destroyed by Folly.  The priests of Brahma, like those of Abracadabranese, are holy and learned men who are never naughty.    O Brahma, thou rare old Divinity,   First Person of the Hindoo Trinity,   You sit there so calm and securely,   With feet folded up so demurely--   You're the First Person Singular, surely.  Polydore Smith   BRAIN, n. An apparatus with which we think what we think.  That which distinguishes the man who is content to _be_"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/972"],["title","The Devil's Dictionary (#3)"],["body","from the man who wishes to _do_ something.  A man of great wealth, or one who has been pitchforked into high station, has commonly such a headful of brain that his neighbors cannot keep their hats on.  In our civilization, and under our republican form of government, brain is so highly honored that it is rewarded by exemption from the cares of office.  BRANDY, n.  A cordial composed of one part thunder-and-lightning, one part remorse, two parts bloody murder, one part death-hell-and-the grave and four parts clarified Satan.  Dose, a headful all the time. Brandy is said by Dr. Johnson to be the drink of heroes.  Only a hero will venture to drink it.  BRIDE, n.  A woman with a fine prospect of happiness behind her.  BRUTE, n.  See HUSBAND.     C   CAABA, n.  A large stone presented by the archangel Gabriel to the patriarch Abraham, and preserved at Mecca.  The patriarch had perhaps asked the archangel for bread.  CABBAGE, n.  A familiar kitchen-garden vegetable about as large and wise as a man's head.  The cabbage is so called from Cabagius, a prince who on ascending the throne issued a decree appointing a High Council of Empire consisting of the members of his predecessor's Ministry and the cabbages in the royal garden.  When any of his Majesty's measures of state policy miscarried conspicuously it was gravely announced that several members of the High Council had been beheaded, and his murmuring subjects were appeased.  CALAMITY, n.  A more than commonly plain and unmistakable reminder that the affairs of this life are not of our own ordering.  Calamities are of two kinds:  misfortune to ourselves, and good fortune to others.  CALLOUS, adj.  Gifted with great fortitude to bear the evils afflicting another.  When Zeno was told that one of his enemies was no more he was observed to be deeply moved.  \"What!\" said one of his disciples, \"you weep at the death of an enemy?\"  \"Ah, 'tis true,\" replied the great Stoic; \"but you should see me smile at the death of a friend.\"  CALUMNUS, n.  A graduate of the School for Scandal.  CAMEL, n.  A quadruped (the _Splaypes humpidorsus_) of great value to the show business.

An instrument employed in the rectification of national boundaries.  CANONICALS, n.  The motley worn by Jesters of the Court of Heaven.  CAPITAL, n.  The seat of misgovernment.  That which provides the fire, the pot, the dinner, the table and the knife and fork for the anarchist; the part of the repast that himself supplies is the disgrace before meat.  _Capital Punishment_, a penalty regarding the justice and expediency of which many worthy persons--including all the assassins--entertain grave misgivings.  CARMELITE, n.  A mendicant friar of the order of Mount Carmel.    As Death was a-riding out one day,   Across Mount Carmel he took his way,       Where he met a mendicant monk,       Some three or four quarters drunk,   With a holy leer and a pious grin,   Ragged and fat and as saucy as sin,       Who held out his hands and cried:   \"Give, give in Charity's name, I pray.   Give in the name of the Church.  O give,   Give that her holy sons may live!\"       And Death replied,       Smiling long and wide:       \"I'll give, holy father, I'll give thee--a ride.\"        With a rattle and bang       Of his bones, he sprang   From his famous Pale Horse, with his spear;       By the neck and the foot       Seized the fellow, and put   Him astride with his face to the rear.    The Monarch laughed loud with a sound that fell   Like clods on the coffin's sounding shell:   \"Ho, ho!  A beggar on horseback, they say,       Will ride to the devil!\"--and _thump_       Fell the flat of his dart on the rump   Of the charger, which galloped away.    Faster and faster and faster it flew,   Till the rocks and the flocks and the trees that grew   By the road were dim and blended and blue       To the wild, wild eyes       Of the rider--in size       Resembling a couple of blackberry pies.   Death laughed again, as a tomb might laugh       At a burial service spoiled,       And the mourners' intentions foiled       By the body erecting       Its head and objecting   To further proceedings in its behalf.    Many a year and many a day   Have passed since these events away.   The monk has long been a dusty corse,   And Death has never recovered his horse.       For the friar got hold of its tail,       And steered it within the pale   Of the monastery gray,   Where the beast was stabled and fed   With barley and oil and bread   Till fatter it grew than the fattest friar,   And so in due course was appointed Prior.  G.J.   CARNIVOROUS, adj.  Addicted to the cruelty of devouring the timorous vegetarian, his heirs and assigns.  CARTESIAN, adj.  Relating to Descartes, a famous philosopher, author of the celebrated dictum, _Cogito ergo sum_--whereby he was pleased to suppose he demonstrated the reality of human existence.  The dictum might be improved, however, thus:  _Cogito cogito ergo cogito sum_-- \"I think that I think, therefore I think that I am;\" as close an approach to certainty as any philosopher has yet made.  CAT, n.  A soft, indestructible automaton provided by nature to be kicked when things go wrong in the domestic circle.    This is a dog,       This is a cat.   This is a frog,       This is a rat.   Run, dog, mew, cat.   Jump, frog, gnaw, rat.  Elevenson   CAVILER, n.  A critic of our own work.  CEMETERY, n.  An isolated suburban spot where mourners match lies, poets write at a target and stone-cutters spell for a wager.  The inscriptions following will serve to illustrate the success attained in these Olympian games:        His virtues were so conspicuous that his enemies, unable to   overlook them, denied them, and his friends, to whose loose lives   they were a rebuke, represented them as vices.  They are here   commemorated by his family, who shared them.       In the earth we here prepare a       Place to lay our little Clara.  Thomas M. and Mary Frazer        P.S.--Gabriel will raise her.  CENTAUR, n.  One of a race of persons who lived before the division of labor had been carried to such a pitch of differentiation, and who followed the primitive economic maxim, \"Every man his own horse.\"  The best of the lot was Chiron, who to the wisdom and virtues of the horse added the fleetness of man.  The scripture story of the head of John the Baptist on a charger shows that pagan myths have somewhat sophisticated sacred history.  CERBERUS, n.  The watch-dog of Hades, whose duty it was to guard the entrance--against whom or what does not clearly appear; everybody, sooner or later, had to go there, and nobody wanted to carry off the entrance.  Cerberus is known to have had three heads, and some of the poets have credited him with as many as a hundred.  Professor Graybill, whose clerky erudition and profound knowledge of Greek give his opinion great weight, has averaged all the estimates, and makes the number twenty-seven--a judgment that would be entirely conclusive if Professor Graybill had known (a) something about dogs, and (b) something about arithmetic.  CHILDHOOD, n.  The period of human life intermediate between the idiocy of infancy and the folly of youth--two removes from the sin of manhood and three from the remorse of age.  CHRISTIAN, n.  One who believes that the New Testament is a divinely inspired book admirably suited to the spiritual needs of his neighbor. One who follows the teachings of Christ in so far as they are not inconsistent with a life of sin.    I dreamed I stood upon a hill, and, lo!   The godly multitudes walked to and fro   Beneath, in Sabbath garments fitly clad,   With pious mien, appropriately sad,   While all the church bells made a solemn din--   A fire-alarm to those who lived in sin.   Then saw I gazing thoughtfully below,   With tranquil face, upon that holy show   A tall, spare figure in a robe of white,   Whose eyes diffused a melancholy light.   \"God keep you, stranger,\" I exclaimed.  \"You are   No doubt (your habit shows it) from afar;   And yet I entertain the hope that you,   Like these good people, are a Christian too.\"   He raised his eyes and with a look so stern   It made me with a thousand blushes burn   Replied--his manner with disdain was spiced:   \"What!  I a Christian?  No, indeed!  I'm Christ.\"  G.J.   CIRCUS, n.  A place where horses, ponies and elephants are permitted to see men, women and children acting the fool.  CLAIRVOYANT, n.  A person, commonly a woman, who has the power of seeing that which is invisible to her patron, namely, that he is a blockhead.  CLARIONET, n.  An instrument of torture operated by a person with cotton in his ears.  There are two instruments that are worse than a clarionet--two clarionets.  CLERGYMAN, n.  A man who undertakes the management of our spiritual affairs as a method of bettering his temporal ones.  CLIO, n.  One of the nine Muses.  Clio's function was to preside over history--which she did with great dignity, many of the prominent citizens of Athens occupying seats on the platform, the meetings being addressed by Messrs. Xenophon, Herodotus and other popular speakers.  CLOCK, n.  A machine of great moral value to man, allaying his concern for the future by reminding him what a lot of time remains to him.    A busy man complained one day:   \"I get no time!\"  \"What's that you say?\"   Cried out his friend, a lazy quiz;   \"You have, sir, all the time there is.   There's plenty, too, and don't you doubt it--   We're never for an hour without it.\"  Purzil Crofe   CLOSE-FISTED, adj.  Unduly desirous of keeping that which many meritorious persons wish to obtain.    \"Close-fisted Scotchman!\" Johnson cried       To thrifty J. Macpherson;   \"See me--I'm ready to divide       With "]]]
