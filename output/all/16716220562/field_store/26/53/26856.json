A good man was our compatriot, for he had a very recent Legion of Honour pinned upon his breast. He had been put with a few men on Hill 285, a sort of volcano stuffed with mines, and was told to telephone when he needed relief. He refused to telephone and remained there for three weeks. 'We sit like a rabbit in his hall,' he explained. He had only one grievance. There were many wild boars in the forest, but the infantry were too busy to get them. 'The Godam Artillaree he get the wild pig!' Out of his pocket he pulled a picture of a frame-house with snow round it, and a lady with two children on the stoop. It was his homestead at Trochu, seventy miles north of Calgary.         *        *        *        *        *  It was the evening of the third day that we turned our faces to Paris once more. It was my last view of the French. The roar of their guns went far with me upon my way. Soldiers of France, farewell! In your own phrase I salute you! Many have seen you who had more knowledge by which to judge your manifold virtues, many also who had more skill to draw you as you are, but never one, I am sure, who admired you more than I. Great was the French soldier under Louis the Sun-King, great too under Napoleon, but never was he greater than to-day.  And so it is back to England and to home. I feel sobered and solemn from all that I have seen. It is a blind vision which does not see more than the men and the guns, which does not catch something of the terrific spiritual conflict which is at the heart of it.    Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord   --He is trampling out the vineyard where the grapes of wrath are stored.  We have found no inspired singer yet, like Julia Howe, to voice the divine meaning of it all--that meaning which is more than numbers or guns upon the day of battle. But who can see the adult manhood of Europe standing in a double line, waiting for a signal to throw themselves upon each other, without knowing that he has looked upon the most terrific of all the dealings between the creature below and that great force above, which works so strangely towards some distant but glorious end?

The Life of  R I C H A R D    C A R E W                    of Antonie Esq;                  By HUGH C******* Esq;     RICHARD CAREW, the Celebrated Author of the Survey of Cornwall, was born of an antient Family at East-Antonie (a), the Seat of his Ancestors, in the Year 1555, if we may credit Mr. Wood (b).  He was the Son of Thomas Carew by Elizabeth Edgecumb, Daughter to Sir Richard Edgecumb, a Gentleman says our Author (c), in whom Mildness and Stoutness, Diffidence and Wisdom, Deliberateness of Undertaking, and Sufficiency of Effecting, made a more commendable, than blazing mixture of Vertue.  He adds, that Sir Richard, at his fine House, call'd to this day Mount-Edgecumb,      \"during Queen Mary's Reign, entertain'd at one time     for some good space, the Admirals of the English,     Spanish, and Netherland Fleets, with many Noblemen     besides.      But\", pursues he, \"not too much of this, lest a     partial Affection steal, as unawares, into my     Commendation, as one, by my Mother, descended from     his Loins, and by my Birth a Member of the House (d).\"  But Mr. Carew hath given us an account of his Ancestors, which I shall set down here, that the Reader may see they were no less distinguished by the great Estates in their possession, than by the Noble Families they were allyed to.  Speaking of the Lyner, which, with the Tamer, discharges itself into the Sea above Plymouth;      \"A little within this Mouth of Lyner\", says     he (e), \"standeth East-Antonie, the poore home of     mine Ancestours, with which in this manner they     were invested:      Sir John Lerchedekne ------- of Ashton in Devon.     Touching our Stock in general\", pursues our Author     (f), \"and my Family in particular -------------     our Queen.\"  The Pregnancy of his Parts being much above his Age, he was sent to Oxford in the Year 1566, being then but eleven Years old, and      \"(g) became a Gentleman Commoner of Christ Church .......     but had his Chamber in Broadgate's Hall:\"  And three Years after he was call'd to dispute with the incomparable Sir Philip Sidney, who was a Year older than he (h).  Dr. Fuller and Mr. Wood have taken notice of this memorable Dispute, without mentioning from whence they had that Particular, which, as we have seen already, is related by Mr. Carew himself.      \"He was bred\", says Dr. Fuller (i), \"a Gentleman-     Commoner in Oxford; where,"]]]
