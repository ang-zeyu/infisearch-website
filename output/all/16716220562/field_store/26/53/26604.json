And I will deliver Arques to you; and thus and thus you may take Normandy and the major portion of France; and thus and thus will I do, and thus and thus must you reward me.\"  Said d'Andreghen, \"I will hang him at dawn; and thus and thus may the devil do with his soul!\"  Then with his company d'Andreghen rode to Arques. A herald declared to the men of that place how the matter stood, and bade Hugues come forth and dance upon nothing. The Sieur d'Arques spat curses, like a cat driven into a corner, and wished to fight, but the greater part of his garrison were not willing to do so in such a cause: and so d'Andreghen took him and carried him off.  In anger having sworn by the Blood of Christ to hang Hugues d'Arques to a certain tree, d'Andreghen had no choice in calm but to abide by his oath. This day being the Sabbath, he deferred the matter; but the Marshal promised to see to it that when morning broke the Sieur d'Arques should dangle side by side with his messenger.  Thus far the Vicomte de Puysange. He concluded his narrative with a dry chuckle. \"And I think we are very well rid of him, Adhelmar. Holy Maclou! that I should have taken the traitor for a true man, though! He would sell France, you observe,--chaffered, they tell me, like a pedlar over the price of Normandy. Heh, the huckster, the triple-damned Jew!\"  \"And Mélite?\" asked Adhelmar, after a little.  Again Reinault shrugged. \"In the White Turret,\" he said; then, with a short laugh: \"Oy Dieus, yes! The girl has been caterwauling for this shabby rogue all day. She would have me--me, the King's man, look you!--save Hugues at the peril of my seignory! And I protest to you, by the most high and pious Saint Nicolas the Confessor,\" Reinault swore, \"that sooner than see this huckster go unpunished, I would lock Hell's gate on him with my own hands!\"  For a moment Adhelmar stood with his jaws puffed out, as if in thought, and then he laughed like a wolf. Afterward he went to the White Turret, leaving Reinault smiling over his wine.   4. _Folly Diversely Attested_  He found Mélite alone. She had robed herself in black, and had gathered her gold hair about her face like a heavy veil, and sat weeping into it for the plight of Hugues d'Arques.  \"Mélite!\" cried Adhelmar; \"Mélite!\" The Demoiselle de Puysange rose with a start, and, seeing him standing in the doorway, ran to him, incompetent little hands fluttering before her like frightened doves. She was very tired, by that day-long arguing with her brother's notions about honor and knightly faith and such foolish matters, and to her weariness Adhelmar seemed strength incarnate; surely he, if any one, could aid Hugues and bring him safe out of the grim marshal's claws. For the moment, perhaps, she had forgotten the feud which existed between Adhelmar and the Sieur d'Arques; but in any event, I am convinced, she knew that Adhelmar could refuse her nothing. So she ran toward him, her cheeks flushing arbutus-like, and she was smiling through her tears.  Oh, thought Adhelmar, were it not very easy to leave Hugues to the dog's death he merits and to take this woman for my own? For I know that she loves me a little. And thinking of this, he kissed her, quietly, as one might comfort a sobbing child; afterward he held her in his arms for a moment, wondering vaguely at the pliant thickness of her hair and the sweet scent of it. Then he put her from him gently, and swore in his soul that Hugues must die, so that this woman might be Adhelmar's.  \"You will save him?\" Mélite asked, and raised her face to his. There was that in her eyes which caused Adhelmar to muse for a little on the nature of women's love, and, subsequently, to laugh harshly and make vehement utterance.  \"Yes!\" said Adhelmar.  He demanded how many of Hugues' men were about. Some twenty of them had come to Puysange, Mélite said, in the hope that Reinault might aid them to save their master. She protested that her brother was a coward for not doing so; but Adhelmar, having his own opinion on this subject, and thinking in his heart that Hugues' skin might easily be ripped off him without spilling a pint of honest blood, said, simply: \"Twenty and twenty is two-score. It is not a large armament, but it may serve.\"  He told her his plan was to fall suddenly upon d'Andreghen and his men that night, and in the tumult to steal Hugues away; whereafter, as Adhelmar pointed out, Hugues might readily take ship for England, and leave the marshal to blaspheme Fortune in Normandy, and the French King to gnaw at his chains in Bordeaux, while Hugues toasts his shins in comfort at London. Adhelmar admitted that the plan was a mad one, but added, reasonably enough, that needs must when the devil drives. And so firm was his confidence, so cheery his laugh--he managed to laugh somehow, though it was a stiff piece of work,--that Mélite began to be comforted somewhat, and bade him go and Godspeed.  So then Adhelmar left her. In the main hall he found the vicomte still sitting over his wine of Anjou.  \"Cousin,\" said Adhelmar, \"I must ride hence to-night.\"  Reinault stared at him: a mastering wonder woke in Reinault's face. \"Ta, ta, ta!\" he clicked his tongue, very softly. Afterward he sprang to his feet and clutched Adhelmar by both arms. \"No, no!\" Reinault cried. \"No, Adhelmar, you must not try that! It is death, lad,--sure death! It means hanging, boy!\" the vicomte pleaded, for, hard man that he was, he loved Adhelmar.  \"That is likely enough,\" Adhelmar conceded.  \"They will hang you,\"' Reinault said again: \"d'Andreghen and the Count Dauphin of Vienna will hang you as blithely as they would Iscariot.\"  \"That, too,\" said Adhelmar, \"is likely enough, if I remain in France.\"  \"Oy Dieus! will you flee to England, then?\" the vicomte scoffed, bitterly. \"Has King Edward not sworn to hang you these eight years past? Was it not you, then, cousin, who took Almerigo di Pavia, that Lombard knave whom he made governor of Calais,--was it not you, then, who delivered Edward's loved Almerigo to Geoffrey de Chargny, who had him broken on the wheel? Eh, holy Maclou! but you will get hearty welcome and a chaplain and a rope in England.\"  Adhelmar admitted that this was true. \"Still,\" said he, \"I must ride hence to-night.\"  \"For her?\" Reinault asked, and jerked his thumb upward.  \"Yes,\" said Adhelmar,--\"for her.\"  Reinault stared in his face for a while. \"You are a fool, Adhelmar,\" said he, at last, \"but you are a brave man, and you love as becomes a chevalier. It is a great pity that a flibbertigibbet wench with a tow-head should be the death of you. For my part, I am the King's vassal; I shall not break faith with him; but you are my guest and my kinsman. For that reason I am going to bed, and I shall sleep very soundly. It is likely I shall hear nothing of the night's doings,--ohimé, no! not if you murder d'Andreghen in the court-yard!\" Reinault ended, and smiled, somewhat sadly.  Afterward he took Adhelmar's hand and said: \"Farewell, lord Adhelmar! O true knight, sturdy and bold! terrible and merciless toward your enemies, gentle and simple toward your friends, farewell!\"  He kissed Adhelmar on either cheek and left him. In those days men encountered death with very little ado.  Then Adhelmar rode off in the rain with thirty-four armed followers. Riding thus, he reflected upon the nature of women and upon his love for the Demoiselle de Puysange; and, to himself, he swore gloomily that if she had a mind to Hugues she must have Hugues, come what might. Having reached this conclusion, Adhelmar wheeled upon his men, and cursed them for tavern-idlers and laggards and flea-hearted snails, and bade them spur.  Mélite, at her window, heard them depart, and heard the noise of their going lapse into the bland monotony of the rain's noise. This dank night now divulged no more, and she turned back into the room. Adhelmar's glove, which he had forgotten in his haste, lay upon the floor, and Mélite lifted it and twisted it idly.  \"I wonder--?\" said she.  She lighted four wax candles and set them before a mirror that was in the room. Mélite stood among them and looked into the mirror. She seemed very tall and very slender, and her loosened hair hung heavily about her beautiful shallow face and fell like a cloak around her black-robed body, showing against the black gown like melting gold; and about her were the tall, white candles tipped with still flames of gold. Mélite laughed--her laughter was high and delicate, with the resonance of thin glass,--and raised her arms above her, head, stretching tensely like a cat before a fire, and laughed yet again.  \"After all,\" said she, \"I do not wonder.\"  Mélite sat before the mirror, and braided her hair, and sang to herself in a sweet, low voice, brooding with unfathomable eyes upon her image in the glass, while the October rain beat about Puysange, and Adhelmar rode forth to save Hugues that must else be hanged.  Sang Mélite:    \"_Rustling leaves of the willow-tree   Peering downward at you and me,   And no man else in the world to see,    \"Only the birds, whose dusty coats   Show dark in the green,--whose throbbing throats   Turn joy to music and love to notes_.    \"Lean your body against the tree,   Lifting your red lips up to me,   Mélite, and kiss, with no man to see!    \"And let us laugh for a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9488"],["title","The Line of Love; Dizain des Mariages (#7)"],["body","ittle:--Yea,   Let love and laughter herald the day   When laughter and love will be put away.    \"Then you will remember the willow-tree   And this very hour, and remember me,   Mélite,--whose face you will no more see!    \"So swift, so swift the glad time goes,   And Eld and Death with their countless woes   Draw near, and the end thereof no man knows,    \"Lean your body against the tree,   Lifting your red lips up to me,   Mélite, and kiss, with no man to see!\"_  Mélite smiled as she sang; for this was a song that Adhelmar had made for her upon a May morning at Nointel, before he was a knight, when both were very young. So now she smiled to remember the making of the verses which she sang while the October rain was beating about Puysange.   5. _Night-work_  It was not long before they came upon d'Andreghen and his men camped about a great oak, with One-eyed Peire a-swing over their heads for a lamentable banner. A shrill sentinel, somewhere in the dark, demanded the newcomers' business, but without receiving any adequate answer, for at that moment Adhelmar gave the word to charge.  Then it was as if all the devils in Pandemonium had chosen Normandy for their playground; and what took place in the night no man saw for the darkness, so that I cannot tell you of it. Let it suffice that Adhelmar rode away before d'Andreghen had rubbed sleep well out of his eyes; and with Adhelmar were Hugues d'Arques and some half of Adhelmar's men. The rest were dead, and Adhelmar was badly hurt, for he had burst open his old wound and it was bleeding under his armor. Of this he said nothing.  \"Hugues,\" said he, \"do you and these fellows ride to the coast; thence take ship for England.\"  He would have none of Hugues' thanks; instead, he turned and left Hugues to whimper out his gratitude to the skies, which spat a warm, gusty rain at him. Adhelmar rode again to Puysange, and as he went he sang.  Sang Adhelmar:    \"D'Andreghen in Normandy   Went forth to slay mine enemy;   But as he went   Lord God for me wrought marvellously;    \"Wherefore, I may call and cry   That am now about to die,   'I am content!'    \"Domine! Domine!   Gratias accipe!   Et meum animum   Recipe in coelum_!\"   6. They Kiss at Parting  When he had come to Puysange, Adhelmar climbed the stairs of the White Turret,--slowly, for he was growing very feeble now,--and so came again to Mélite crouching among the burned-out candles in the slate-colored twilight which heralded dawn.  \"He is safe,\" said Adhelmar. He told Mélite how Hugues was rescued and shipped to England, and how, if she would, she might straightway follow him in a fishing-boat. \"For there is likely to be ugly work at Puysange,\" Adhelmar said, \"when the marshal comes. And he will come.\"  \"But what will you do now, my cousin?\" asked Mélite.  \"Holy Ouen!\" said Adhelmar; \"since I needs must die, I will die in France, not in the cold land of England.\"  \"Die!\" cried Mélite. \"Are you hurt so sorely, then?\"  He grinned like a death's-head. \"My injuries are not incurable,\" said he, \"yet must I die very quickly, for all that. The English King will hang me if I go thither, as he has sworn to do these eight years, because of that matter of Almerigo di Pavia: and if I stay in France, I must hang because of this night's work.\"  Mélite wept. \"O God! O God!\" she quavered, two or three times, like one hurt in the throat. \"And you have done this for me! Is there no way to save you, Adhelmar?\" she pleaded, with wide, frightened eyes that were like a child's.  \"None,\" said Adhelmar. He took both her hands in his, very tenderly. \"Ah, my sweet,\" said he, \"must I, whose grave is already digged, waste breath upon this idle talk of kingdoms and the squabbling men who rule them? I have but a brief while to live, and I wish to forget that there is aught else in the world save you, and that I love you. Do not weep, Mélite! In a little time you will forget me and be happy with this Hugues whom you love; and I?--ah, my sweet, I think that even in my grave I shall dream of you and of your great beauty and of the exceeding love that I bore you in the old days.\"  \"Ah, no, I shall not ever forget, O true and faithful lover! And, indeed, indeed, Adhelmar, I would give my life right willingly that yours might be saved!\"  She had almost forgotten Hugues. Her heart was sad as she thought of Adhelmar, who must die a shameful death for her sake, and of the love which she had cast away. Beside it, the Sieur d'Arques' affection showed somewhat tawdry, and Mélite began to reflect that, after all, she had liked Adhelmar almost as well.  \"Sweet,\" said Adhelmar, \"do I not know you to the marrow? You will forget me utterly, for your heart is very changeable. Ah, Mother of God!\" Adhelmar cried, with a quick lift of speech; \"I am afraid to die, for the harsh dust will shut out the glory of your face, and you will forget!\"  \"No; ah, no!\" Mélite whispered, and drew near to him. Adhelmar smiled, a little wistfully, for he did not believe that she spoke the truth; but it was good to feel her body close to his, even though he was dying, and he was content.  But by this time the dawn had come completely, flooding the room with its first thin radiance, and Mélite saw the pallor of his face and so knew that he was wounded.  \"Indeed, yes,\" said Adhelmar, when she had questioned him, \"for my breast is quite cloven through.\" And when she disarmed him, Mélite found a great cut in his chest which had bled so much that it was apparent he must die, whether d'Andreghen and Edward of England would or no.  Mélite wept again, and cried, \"Why had you not told me of this?\"  \"To have you heal me, perchance?\" said Adhelmar. \"Ah, love, is hanging, then, so sweet a death that I should choose it, rather than to die very peacefully in your arms? Indeed, I would not live if I might; for I have proven traitor to my King, and it is right that traitors should die; and, chief of all, I know that life can bring me naught more desirable than I have known this night. What need, then, have I to live?\"  Mélite bent over him; for as he spoke he had lain back in a tall carven chair by the east window. She was past speech. But now, for a moment, her lips clung to his, and her warm tears fell upon his face. What better death for a lover? thought Adhelmar.  Yet he murmured somewhat. \"Pity, always pity!\" he said, wearily. \"I shall never win aught else of you, Mélite. For before this you have kissed me, pitying me because you could not love me. And you have kissed me now, pitying me because I may not live.\"  But Mélite, clasping her arms about his neck, whispered into his ear the meaning of this last kiss, and at the honeyed sound of her whispering his strength came back for a moment, and he strove to rise. The level sunlight through the open window smote full upon his face, which was very glad. Mélite was conscious of her nobility in causing him such delight at the last.  \"God, God!\" cried Adhelmar, and he spread out his arms toward the dear, familiar world that was slowly taking form beneath them,--a world now infinitely dear to him; \"all, my God, have pity and let me live a little longer!\"  As Mélite, half frightened, drew back from him, he crept out of his chair and fell prone at her feet. Afterward his hands stretched forward toward her, clutching, and then trembled and were still.  Mélite stood looking downward, wondering vaguely when she would next know either joy or sorrow again. She was now conscious of no emotion whatever. It seemed to her she ought to be more greatly moved. So the new day found them.         *       *       *       *       *  MARCH 2, 1414  \"_Jack, how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou soldest him for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg_?\"   _In the chapel at Puysange you may still see the tomb of Adhelmar; but Mélite's bones lie otherwhere. \"Her heart was changeable,\" as old Nicolas says, justly enough; and so in due time it was comforted.  For Hugues d'Arques--or Hugh Darke, as his name was Anglicized--presently stood high in the favor of King Edward. A fief was granted to Messire Darke, in Norfolk, where Hugues shortly built for himself a residence at Yaxham, and began to look about for a wife: it was not long before he found one.  This befell at Brétigny when, in 1360, the Great Peace was signed between France and England, and Hugues, as one of the English embassy, came face to face with Reinault and Mélite. History does not detail the meeting; but, inasmuch as the Sieur d'Arques and Mélite de Puysange were married at Rouen the following October, doubtless it passed off pleasantly enough.  The couple had sufficient in common to have qualified them for several decades of mutual toleration. But by ill luck, Mélite died in child-birth three years after her marriage. She had borne, in 1361, twin daughters, of whom Adelais died a spinster; the other daughter, Sylvia, circa 1378, figured in an unfortunate love-affair with one of Sir Thomas Mowbray's attendants, but subsequently married Robert Vernon of Winstead. Mélite left also a son, Hugh, born in 1363, who succeeded to his father's estate of Yaxham in 1387, in which year Hugues fell at the battle of Radcot Bridge, fighting in behalf of the ill-fated Richard of Bordeaux.  Now we turn to certain happenings in Eastcheap, at the Boar's Head Tavern._     CHAPTER III  _The Episode Called Love-Letters of Falstaff_   I. \"_That Gray Iniquity_\"  There was a sound of scuffling within as Sir John Falstaff--much broken since his loss of the King's favor, and now equally decayed in wit and health and reputation--stood fumbling at the door of the Angel room. He was particularly shaky this morning after a night of particularly hard drinking.  But he came into the apartment singing, and, whatever the scuffling had meant, found Bardolph in one corner employed in sorting garments from a clothes-chest, while at the extreme end of the room Mistress Quickly demurely stirred the fire; which winked at the old "]]]
