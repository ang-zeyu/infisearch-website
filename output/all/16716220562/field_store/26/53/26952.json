There's a story for you! And if you don't believe it is true, some day, when you go to Athens with your Father, you can see the Gorgon's head, snakes and all, on the breastplate of the Goddess Athena, where she has worn it ever since.\"  \"Is it the real Gorgon's head?\" asked Dion breathlessly, \"all snakes and blood and everything?\"  \"No,\" said the Stranger, laughing, \"the blood of the Gorgon dried up long ago. It is a sculptured head that adorns the breastplate of Athena.\"  Then the Twins and Chloe listened with open mouth and round eyes to another of the most wonderful stories in the world, while Lydia forgot to spin and the wine-cup of Melas stood untouched within reach of his hand. Even Lydia forgot all about time, and when the story was finished, the moon had already risen and was looking down upon them over the wall. Lydia pointed to it with her distaff.  \"See, children,\" she said, \"the Goddess Artemis herself has come to light you to bed. Thank your kind friend and say good-night.\"     III  THE SHEPHERDS   The next morning Dion was wakened by feeling a cold wet nose wiggling about in the back of his neck. It was Argos' nose. Dion knew it at once. He had felt it before.  \"Go away, Argos,\" he said crossly. He pulled the sheepskin coverings of his bed closer about his ears and turned over for another nap.  But Argos was a good shepherd dog and he knew that his first work that morning was to round up the Twins. So he gamboled about on his four clumsy paws and barked. Then, seeing that Dion had no intention of getting up, he seized the sheepskin covers and dragged them to the floor.  \"Bow-wow,\" he said.  Dion sat up shivering. \"Good dog,\" said Dion, \"go away from here; go wake Daphne!\"  \"Bow-wow, bow-wow,\" said Argos, and bounded off to Daphne's room to wake her too.  Dressing took only a minute, for the children each wore but one garment, and there were no buttons; so, though they were sleepy and their fingers were cold and clumsy, they appeared in the court while the roosters in the farm-yard were still crowing and the thrushes in the olive trees were in the midst of their sunrise song. Chloe had already gone out to feed the chickens. Lydia was bending over the hearth-fire, and their Father was just saying good-bye to the Stranger at the door of the court, and pointing out to him the road to the little seaport town.  \"You will probably find a boat going over to the Piraeus some time to-day,\" he said, \"and as they usually go early in the morning, it is well for you to make an early start from here. May Hermes speed you on your way.\"  \"Farewell,\" said the Stranger, \"and if ever a philosopher can serve a farmer, you have but to ask in the Piraeus for the home of Anaxagoras. I thank you for your hospitality,\" and with these words he was gone.  Melas had eaten his breakfast of bread and wine with his guest before dawn, and was now ready for the day's work in the fields. The slaves of Pericles were already in the farm-yard, yoking the oxen, milking the goats, and getting out the tools. There were pleasant early sounds all about, but the Twins hovered over the hearth-fire, for the morning was chill; and Dion yawned. Lydia saw him.  \"Come,\" she said briskly, \"wash your faces! That will wake you up, if you are still sleepy. And then I'll have a bite for you to eat, and some bread and cheese for you to carry with you to the hills.\"  \"Are we going to the hills?\" asked Dion.  \"Yes,\" said Melas. \"To-day you must watch the sheep. Dromas has to help me plough the corn-field. You are old enough now to look after the flock and bring the sheep all safe home again at night. Come, move quickly! 'Still on the sluggard hungry want attends.'\"  \"They were up too late,\" said Lydia. \"If they can't wake up in the morning they must go to bed very early every night.\"  When Dion and Daphne heard their Mother say that, they became at once quite lively, and were soon washed and ready for their breakfast, which was nothing but cold barley-cakes left over from the night before and a drink of warm goat's milk. When they had eaten it, Daphne put the bread and cheese which Lydia had wrapped up in a towel for their luncheon in the front of her dress and they were ready to start.  Melas and Dromas, the shepherd, were waiting for them at the farm-yard gate when the Twins came bounding out of the back door, Dion with a little reed pipe in his hand and Daphne carrying a shepherd's crook. The sheep were huddled together at the gate, waiting to be let out.  \"Be sure you keep good watch of that old black ewe,\" said Dromas to the Twins as he went to open the gate. \"She is a wanderer. I never saw a sheep like her. She is always straying off by herself. Quarrelsome too. Argos knows she has to be watched more than the others, and sometimes when she goes off by herself and he goes after her, she just puts her head down and butts at him like an old goat The wolves will get her one of these days, as sure as my name is Dromas.\"  \"Are there wolves in the hills?\" asked Daphne.  \"Maybe a few,\" answered Dromas, \"but they don't usually come round when they see the flock together, and a good dog along. You needn't be afraid.\"  \"I'm not afraid of anything,\" said Daphne proudly, and then the gate was opened, the sheep crowded through, and Dion and Daphne with Argos fell in behind the flock, and away they went toward the hills, to the music of Dion's pipe, the bleating of the sheep, and the tinkling of their bells.  The children followed the cart-path westward for some distance, and then left it to drive the flock up the southern slope of a rocky high hill, where the grass was already quite green in places and there was good pasture for the sheep. It was still so early in the morning that the sun threw long, long shadows before them, when they reached the hill pasture, though they were then two miles from home. The pasture was a lonely place. Even from the hill-tops there were no houses or villages to be seen. Far, far away toward the east they could see the olive and fig trees around their own house. On the western horizon there was a glimpse of blue sea. In a field nearer they could barely make out two brown specks moving slowly back and forth. They were oxen, and Dromas was ploughing with them. It was so still that the children could plainly hear the breathing of the sheep as they cropped the grass, and the ripple of the little stream which spread out into a shallow river and watered the valley below.  The hillside was bare except for shrubs and a few trees, but there were wonderful places to play among the rocks. Dion proposed that they play robber cave in a hollow place between two large boulders; but as he insisted on being the robber, and Daphne wouldn't play if she couldn't be the robber half the time, that game had to be given up.  Then Daphne said, \"Come on! Let's play Apollo and Daphne! I'm Daphne anyway, and I can run like the wind. You can be Apollo, only I know you can't catch me! I can run so fast that even the real Apollo couldn't catch me!\"  Dion looked scared.  \"Don't you know the Gods are all about us, only we can't see them?\" he demanded. \"Apollo may have heard what you said, and if he should take a notion to punish you for bragging, I guess you'd be sorry. Maybe he'll turn you into a tree just like the other Daphne.\"  \"Pooh,\" said Daphne. \"I'm not afraid. I should think the Gods wouldn't have time to listen to everything little girls say! They can't be very busy if they do.\"  Dion was horrified. \"That's a wicked thing to say,\" he said. \"You must never speak that way of the Gods. Oh dear! This is bound to be an unlucky day. This morning when Argos woke me, I was having a bad dream! That's a very bad sign.\"  \"It's a sign you ate too much last night,\" said Daphne. She said it very boldly, but really she was beginning to feel a little frightened too, for every one she knew believed in such signs and omens.  \"Come along out of this place, anyway,\" said Dion. \"Let's go somewhere else and play. Let's go to the brook.\"  The two children came out of their cave between the rocks and started toward the little stream, which was hidden from them by bushes. The sheep were all grazing contentedly along the hillside, the old black ewe browsing in the very middle of the flock. Argos was sitting on the hill-top in the sunshine, watching them, with his tongue hanging out. The sun was now quite high in the sky and the day was warm. The children paddled in the water and built a dam, and sent fleets of leaves down the stream, and played knuckle-bones on a flat rock beside it, until at last they were hungry, and then they ate their bread and cheese.  When they had finished the last crumb, Daphne curled herself up on the flat rock with her head on her arm.  \"I'm so sleepy,\" she said. \"I can't keep awake another minute.\"  You see, they had been up ever so many hours then, and the sunshine was very warm, and the bees buzzed so drowsily in the sunshine!  \"You and Argos watch the sheep,\" she begged, and was asleep before you could say Jack Robinson.  Dion came out of the bushes and counted the flock like a careful shepherd. They were all there, and Argos was still on watch.  \"I'll lie down a little while, too,\" said Dion to himself, \"but I won't go to sleep. I'll just look at the sky.\"  He stretched himself out beside Daphne and watched the white clouds sailing away overhead, and in two minutes he was asleep too.  How long they slept the children never knew. They were awakened at last by a long, long howl, which seemed to come from the other side of the hill. They sat up and clutched each other in terror. There was an answering howl from Argos, and mingled with it they heard the dull thud of many feet, the bleating of sheep, and the frightened cries of lambs.  \"The sheep are frightened. There's a stampede!\" cried Dion.  The two children plunged through the bushes and gazed about"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9966"],["title","The Spartan Twins (#4)"],["body","m. The whole flock had disappeared! Their bells could be heard in a mad jangle of sound from the farther side of the hill, Argos was barking wildly.  \"Come on,\" shouted Dion, springing out of the bushes, \"We must get them back.\"  \"Suppose it is a wolf!\" shrieked Daphne, tumbling after him.  \"We'll have to get the sheep back even if it is a bear,\" cried Dion, and he tore away over the crest of the hill and down the farther slope. Daphne followed after him, as fast as she could run.  The sheep were already a long distance away, in a region of the hills which the children had never seen before in their lives, but they did not stop to think of that. All they thought was that the sheep must be brought back at any cost. They could see Argos barking and circling round the frightened flock, and away in the distance a huge wild creature was just disappearing into the woods.  On the children ran, over rocks and through briars, until at last they reached the sheep, whose flight Argos had already checked. Dion ran beyond to turn them back, while Daphne herded them on one side and Argos on the other. When they had the flock together and quiet once more, the children counted them.  \"There's one missing!\" cried Daphne, aghast. \"And it's the old black ewe! What will Father say?\"  \"It's all your fault,\" said Dion. \"I told you you would have bad luck if you spoke about the Gods the way you did. I shouldn't wonder if that wasn't really a wolf that we saw. It may have been Pan himself! Or it may have been Apollo, and he meant to show you that you can't run even as fast as a sheep!\"  \"Anyway, the old black ewe is gone.\"  \"Oh dear! Oh dear! What shall we do?\" mourned Daphne.  By this time the sun was low in the sky, and it was late afternoon.  \"The first thing to do is to get home as fast as we can,\" said Dion.  \"Which way is home?\" said Daphne.  Dion looked about him. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"Maybe Argos does. Here Argos! Good dog! Take 'em home! Home Argos! Home!\"  Argos wagged his tail, and ran around behind the flock.  \"Bow-wow, bow-wow,\" he barked, and nipped the heels of the wether. In a short time he had the whole flock moving toward a hollow between the hills. As they trotted along behind the sheep, Daphne struck her hands together in dismay.  \"What else do you think I have done?\" she cried. \"I've left my crook in the robber's cave!\"  \"And I left my pipe there, too,\" Dion wailed.  \"We can't get them to-night anyway,\" sobbed Daphne. \"We could never find the place! And besides, it is too late. It will be dark before we get home.\"  They trudged along behind Argos and the sheep in dismal silence. Argos did not seem at all in doubt about the way home. He drove the sheep through the hollow between the hills and across two fields, and brought them out at last upon a roadway.  \"This must be the road that goes by the house,\" cried Dion joyfully. For answer Daphne pointed toward the east. There some distance ahead of them was Dromas driving the oxen home from the day's ploughing.  Daphne clapped her hands for joy. \"I knew Argos would find the way!\" she cried.  The bright colors of the sunset were just fading from the sky when they reached the farm-yard gate. Dromas had gone in before them with the oxen, and Melas himself was waiting to let them in and to count the sheep.  \"Where is the old black ewe?\" he said sternly to the Twins, when the last sheep had passed through the gate.  \"We don't know,\" sobbed Daphne. \"We lost her. We lost the crook, and Dion's little pipe, too. A wolf frightened the flock, and they ran away, and--\"  \"_Maybe_ it was a wolf,\" said Dion darkly.  Then the Twins told the whole story to their Father. Melas did not say much to them. He was a man of few words at any time, but he made them feel very much ashamed. And when Lydia heard the things Daphne had said about the Gods, they felt worse than ever, at least Daphne did.  That night, before the family went to bed, Melas kindled a fire upon the little altar which stood in the middle of the court and offered upon it a handful of barley, and prayed to Pan and to Apollo that Daphne might be forgiven for her wicked words.     IV  SOWING AND REAPING   The children were not allowed again to take the sheep to the hills. \"They are not to be trusted,\" said Melas. \"They are the sort of shepherds that go to sleep and let the wolves find the flock. They are not real Spartans.\"  Dion and Daphne felt this as a terrible reproach. Dromas now had to go with the sheep, and so could no longer help with the other farm work, and the ploughing and sowing of the corn-field had to be finished by Melas himself. The Twins did their best to help. When Melas scattered the grain, they followed with rakes and scratched a layer of earth over the seeds. The crows watched the planting with much interest.  \"Look at them,\" cried Dion to his Father one afternoon. \"There are five of them on that tree yonder, and the minute we get to one end of the field they begin to scratch up the grain at the other.\"  \"We'll fix them,\" said Melas shortly.  He sent the Twins to the house for sticks and straw and his old worn-out sheepskin cloak and hat, and when they came back, Melas stuck two long sticks of wood in the ground and bound a cross piece to them with strips of leather. Then he wound the sticks with straw, and made a round bundle of straw at the top. He tied it all securely with thongs. Then he dressed it with the sheepskin and put on the hat. When it was done, it was the scariest looking scarecrow you ever saw!  \"I guess that will frighten the crows!\" said Dion, as he gazed at it admiringly. \"It just about scares me.\"  \"Caw, caw, caw!\" screamed a crow.  A crow was flying right over his head! Dion shook his fist at him. \"You old thief!\" he cried.  \"I know one more thing we can do,\" said Daphne. \"Lycias told me about it.\" She got a small piece of bark and made a little amulet of it. She punched a hole through one end and put a leather string through it. Neither she nor Dion could write, so when she had explained what must be done Melas himself took a sharp stone and scratched a curse upon crows in the soft bark. When it was done Daphne hung it about the neck of the scarecrow. \"There,\" said Melas grimly, \"I don't believe he'll go to sleep on the job. He's a Spartan scarecrow! Now let's go home to supper, and to-morrow we'll see how it works.\"  The next morning the very first thing the Twins did was to rush out to the field and there, right on top of the scarecrow were three black crows, and more were on the ground eating up the seed!  \"After all we did, just look at them!\" cried Dion.  \"Caw, caw,\" screamed the crows.  \"You don't suppose Father made a mistake, and wrote a blessing instead of a curse on that amulet?\" said Daphne anxiously. They ran back to the house as fast as they could go. Melas was just coming out of the farm-yard with a pruning-hook in his hand.  \"Oh, Father,\" cried Dion, \"the crows are roosting all over the scarecrow. Maybe he wasn't a Spartan scarecrow after all.\"  \"Anyway, he seems to have gone to sleep on the job,\" added Daphne.  Melas stared at the crows in angry silence. \"You children will have to get your clappers then, and just drive the old thieves away,\" he said at last, \"You will have to spend the day in the field watching them. I've got to work in the vineyard. The vines must be pruned.\"  The Twins had not yet had their breakfast and they were hungry. So they ran to the kitchen, seized some barley-cakes and a little jar of milk, and in a few minutes were back again in the field. They sat down with the wooden clappers beside them, and ate their breakfast in the company of the scarecrow. All day long they watched the grain and rattled their clappers, or threw clods at the black marauders. It was lively work, and although they did not like it, they remembered the black ewe and stuck faithfully at it all through the long day.  When the sun was high overhead, Lydia brought them some figs and cheese and a drink of goat's milk. She also brought a message. This was the message. \"Father says you are to stay here until after dark. You are to hunt around until you find a toad, and when you find it, you must be sure not to let it get away from you. He is going to put a magic spell on the field to keep the crows away, but the spell will not work except in the dark. So you must stay here until he comes.\"  Between keeping off the birds and hunting for the toad, the Twins spent a busy afternoon. And after the toad was found it was no joke to try to keep it. It was a wonderful hopper and nearly got away twice. At dusk the crows flew away to their nests, and the children were alone in the field until the twilight deepened into darkness. Owls had begun to hoot and bats were flying about, when at last they saw three dim, shadowy figures coming across the field.  The shadowy figures were Melas, Lydia, and Chloe. Lydia bore a jar, which she placed beside the scarecrow in the middle of the field. Melas took the toad in his hand, formed the others in line, and then solemnly headed the procession as the five walked slowly round the entire field, carrying the toad. When they got back to the scarecrow again, Melas put the toad in the jar and sealed it. Then he buried the jar in the middle of the field, beside the scarecrow.  \"There,\" said Lydia, when it was done, \"that's the very strongest spell there is. If that doesn't protect the corn, I don't know another thing to do.\"  Whether it was the scarecrow, or the curse, or the spell, I cannot say, but it is certain that the corn grew well that summer, and when harvest time came, Melas was so proud of his crop that he decided to have an extra celebration. So one day in late summer every one on the entire farm rose with the dawn and hastened to the fields. It was the twelfth day of the month, which was counted a lucky day for harvesting, and every one was gay, as, with sickles in hand, slaves and master alike entered the field of ripe grain.
