MAURYA. If it wasn’t found itself, that wind is raising the sea, and there was a star up against the moon, and it rising in the night. If it was a hundred horses, or a thousand horses you had itself, what is the price of a thousand horses against a son where there is one son only?  BARTLEY. _Working at the halter, to Cathleen._—Let you go down each day, and see the sheep aren’t jumping in on the rye, and if the jobber comes you can sell the pig with the black feet if there is a good price going.  MAURYA. How would the like of her get a good price for a pig?  BARTLEY. _To Cathleen._—If the west wind holds with the last bit of the moon let you and Nora get up weed enough for another cock for the kelp. It’s hard set we’ll be from this day with no one in it but one man to work.  MAURYA. It’s hard set we’ll be surely the day you’re drownd’d with the rest. What way will I live and the girls with me, and I an old woman looking for the grave?  [_Bartley lays down the halter, takes off his old coat, and puts on a newer one of the same flannel._]  BARTLEY. _To Nora._—Is she coming to the pier?  NORA. _Looking out._—She’s passing the green head and letting fall her sails.  BARTLEY. _Getting his purse and tobacco._—I’ll have half an hour to go down, and you’ll see me coming again in two days, or in three days, or maybe in four days if the wind is bad.  MAURYA. _Turning round to the fire, and putting her shawl over her head._—Isn’t it a hard and cruel man won’t hear a word from an old woman, and she holding him from the sea?  CATHLEEN. It’s the life of a young man to be going on the sea, and who would listen to an old woman with one thing and she saying it over?  BARTLEY. _Taking the halter._—I must go now quickly. I’ll ride down on the red mare, and the gray pony’ll run behind me. . . The blessing of God on you.  [_He goes out._]  MAURYA. _Crying out as he is in the door._—He’s gone now, God spare us, and we’ll not see him again. He’s gone now, and when the black night is falling I’ll have no son left me in the world.  CATHLEEN. Why wouldn’t you give him your blessing and he looking round in the door? Isn’t it sorrow enough is on every one in this house without your sending him out with an unlucky word behind him, and a hard word in his ear?  [_Maurya takes up the tongs and begins raking the fire aimlessly without looking round._]  NORA. _Turning towards her._—You’re taking away the turf from the cake.  CATHLEEN. _Crying out._—The Son of God forgive us, Nora, we’re after forgetting his bit of bread.  [_She comes over to the fire._]  NORA. And it’s destroyed he’ll be going till dark night, and he after eating nothing since the sun went up.  CATHLEEN. _Turning the cake out of the oven._—It’s destroyed he’ll be, surely. There’s no sense left on any person in a house where an old woman will be talking for ever.  [_Maurya sways herself on her stool._]  CATHLEEN. _Cutting off some of the bread and rolling it in a cloth; to Maurya._—Let you go down now to the spring well and give him this and he passing. You’ll see him then and the dark word will be broken, and you can say “God speed you,” the way he’ll be easy in his mind.  MAURYA. _Taking the bread._—Will I be in it as soon as himself?  CATHLEEN. If you go now quickly.  MAURYA. _Standing up unsteadily._—It’s hard set I am to walk.  CATHLEEN. _Looking at her anxiously._—Give her the stick, Nora, or maybe she’ll slip on the big stones.  NORA. What stick?  CATHLEEN. The stick Michael brought from Connemara.  MAURYA. _Taking a stick Nora gives her._—In the big world the old people do be leaving things after them for their sons and children, but in this place it is the young men do be leaving things behind for them that do be old.  [_She goes out slowly. Nora goes over to the ladder._]  CATHLEEN. Wait, Nora, maybe she’d turn back quickly. She’s that sorry, God help her, you wouldn’t know the thing she’d do.  NORA. Is she gone round by the bush?  CATHLEEN. _Looking out._—She’s gone now. Throw it down quickly, for the Lord knows when she’ll be out of it again.  NORA. _Getting the bundle from the loft._—The young priest said he’d be passing to-morrow, and we might go down and speak to him below if it’s Michael’s they are surely.  CATHLEEN. _Taking the bundle._—Did he say what way they were found?  NORA. _Coming down._—“There were two men,” says he, “and they rowing round with poteen before the cocks crowed, and the oar of one of them caught the body, and they passing the black cliffs of the north.”  CATHLEEN. _Trying to open the bundle._—Give me a knife, Nora, the string’s perished with the salt water, and there’s a black knot on it you wouldn’t loosen in a week.  NORA. _Giving her a knife._—I’ve heard tell it was a long way to Donegal.  CATHLEEN. _Cutting the string._—It is surely. There was a man in here a while ago—the man sold us that knife—and he said if you set off walking from the rocks beyond, it would be seven days you’d be in Donegal.  NORA. And what time would a man take, and he floating?  [_Cathleen opens the bundle and takes out a bit of a stocking. They look at them eagerly._]  CATHLEEN. _In a low voice._—The Lord spare us, Nora! isn’t it a queer hard thing to say if it’s his they are surely?  NORA. I’ll get his shirt off the hook the way we can put the one flannel on the other [_she looks through some clothes hanging in the corner._] It’s not with them, Cathleen, and where will it be?  CATHLEEN. I’m thinking Bartley put it on him in the morning, for his own shirt was heavy with the salt in it [_pointing to the corner_]. There’s a bit of a sleeve was of the same stuff. Give me that and it will do.  [_Nora brings it to her and they compare the flannel._]  CATHLEEN. It’s the same stuff, Nora; but if it is itself aren’t there great rolls of it in the shops of Galway, and isn’t it many another man may have a shirt of it as well as Michael himself?  NORA. _Who has taken up the stocking and counted the stitches, crying out._—It’s Michael, Cathleen, it’s Michael; God spare his soul, and what will herself say when she hears this story, and Bartley on the sea?  CATHLEEN. _Taking the stocking._—It’s a plain stocking.  NORA. It’s the second one of the third pair I knitted, and I put up three score stitches, and I dropped four of them.  CATHLEEN. _Counts the stitches._—It’s that number is in it [_crying out._] Ah, Nora, isn’t it a bitter thing to think of him floating that way to the far north, and no one to keen him but the black hags that do be flying on the sea?  NORA. _Swinging herself round, and throwing out her arms on the clothes._—And isn’t it a pitiful thing when there is nothing left of a man who was a great rower and fisher, but a bit of an old shirt and a plain stocking?  CATHLEEN. _After an instant._—Tell me is herself coming, Nora? I hear a little sound on the path.  NORA. _Looking out._—She is, Cathleen. She’s coming up to the door.  CATHLEEN. Put these things away before she’ll come in. Maybe it’s easier she’ll be after giving her blessing to Bartley, and we won’t let on we’ve heard anything the time he’s on the sea.  NORA. _Helping Cathleen to close the bundle._—We’ll put them here in the corner.  [_They put them into a hole in the chimney corner. Cathleen goes back to the spinning-wheel._]  NORA. Will she see it was crying I was?  CATHLEEN. Keep your back to the door the way the light’ll not be on you.  [_Nora sits down at the chimney corner, with her back to the door. Maurya comes in very slowly, without looking at the girls, and goes over to her stool at the other side of the fire. The cloth with the bread is still in her hand. The girls look at each other, and Nora points to the bundle of bread._]  CATHLEEN. _After spinning for a moment._—You didn’t give him his bit of bread?  [_Maurya begins to keen softly, without turning round._]  CATHLEEN. Did you see him riding down?  [_Maurya goes on keening._]  CATHLEEN. _A little impatiently._—God forgive you; isn’t it a better thing to raise your voice and tell what you seen, than to be making lamentation for a thing that’s done? Did you see Bartley, I’m saying to you?  MAURYA. _With a weak voice._—My heart’s broken from this day.  CATHLEEN. _As before._—Did you see Bartley?  MAURYA. I seen the fearfulest thing.  CATHLEEN. _Leaves her wheel and looks out._—God forgive you; he’s riding the mare now over the green head, and the gray pony behind him.  MAURYA. _Starts, so that her shawl falls back from her head and shows her white tossed hair. With a frightened voice._—The gray pony behind him.  CATHLEEN. _Coming to the fire._—What is it ails you, at all?  MAURYA. _Speaking very slowly._—I’ve seen the fearfulest thing any person has seen, since the day Bride Dara seen the dead man with the child in his arms.  CATHLEEN AND NORA. Uah.  [_They crouch down in front of the old woman at the fire._]  NORA. Tell us what it is you seen.  MAURYA. I went down to the spring well, and I stood there saying a prayer to myself. Then Bartley came along, and he riding on the red mare with the gray pony behind him [_she puts up her hands, as if to hide something from her eyes._] The Son of God spare us, Nora!  CATHLEEN. What is it you seen.  MAURYA. I seen Michael himself.  CATHLEEN. _Speaking softly._—You did not, mother; it wasn’t Michael you seen, for his body is after being found in the far north, and he’s got a clean burial by the grace of God.  MAURYA. _A little defiantly._—I’m after seeing him this day, and he riding and galloping. Bartley came first on the red mare; and I tried to say “God speed you,” but something choked the words in my throat. He went by quickly; and “the blessing of God on you,” says he, and I could say nothing. I looked up then, and I crying, at the gray pony, and there was Michael upon it—with fine clothes on him, and new shoes on his feet.  CATHLEEN. _Begins to keen._—It’s"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/994"],["title","Riders to the Sea (#2)"],["body"," we are from this day. It’s destroyed, surely.  NORA. Didn’t the young priest say the Almighty God wouldn’t leave her destitute with no son living?  MAURYA. _In a low voice, but clearly._—It’s little the like of him knows of the sea. . . . Bartley will be lost now, and let you call in Eamon and make me a good coffin out of the white boards, for I won’t live after them. I’ve had a husband, and a husband’s father, and six sons in this house—six fine men, though it was a hard birth I had with every one of them and they coming to the world—and some of them were found and some of them were not found, but they’re gone now the lot of them. . . There were Stephen, and Shawn, were lost in the great wind, and found after in the Bay of Gregory of the Golden Mouth, and carried up the two of them on the one plank, and in by that door.  [_She pauses for a moment, the girls start as if they heard something through the door that is half open behind them._]  NORA. _In a whisper._—Did you hear that, Cathleen? Did you hear a noise in the north-east?  CATHLEEN. _In a whisper._—There’s some one after crying out by the seashore.  MAURYA. _Continues without hearing anything._—There was Sheamus and his father, and his own father again, were lost in a dark night, and not a stick or sign was seen of them when the sun went up. There was Patch after was drowned out of a curagh that turned over. I was sitting here with Bartley, and he a baby, lying on my two knees, and I seen two women, and three women, and four women coming in, and they crossing themselves, and not saying a word. I looked out then, and there were men coming after them, and they holding a thing in the half of a red sail, and water dripping out of it—it was a dry day, Nora—and leaving a track to the door.  [_She pauses again with her hand stretched out towards the door. It opens softly and old women begin to come in, crossing themselves on the threshold, and kneeling down in front of the stage with red petticoats over their heads._]  MAURYA. _Half in a dream, to Cathleen._—Is it Patch, or Michael, or what is it at all?  CATHLEEN. Michael is after being found in the far north, and when he is found there how could he be here in this place?  MAURYA. There does be a power of young men floating round in the sea, and what way would they know if it was Michael they had, or another man like him, for when a man is nine days in the sea, and the wind blowing, it’s hard set his own mother would be to say what man was it.  CATHLEEN. It’s Michael, God spare him, for they’re after sending us a bit of his clothes from the far north.  [_She reaches out and hands Maurya the clothes that belonged to Michael. Maurya stands up slowly, and takes them into her hands. Nora looks out._]  NORA. They’re carrying a thing among them and there’s water dripping out of it and leaving a track by the big stones.  CATHLEEN. _In a whisper to the women who have come in._—Is it Bartley it is?  ONE OF THE WOMEN. It is surely, God rest his soul.  [_Two younger women come in and pull out the table. Then men carry in the body of Bartley, laid on a plank, with a bit of a sail over it, and lay it on the table._]  CATHLEEN. _To the women, as they are doing so._—What way was he drowned?  ONE OF THE WOMEN. The gray pony knocked him into the sea, and he was washed out where there is a great surf on the white rocks.  [_Maurya has gone over and knelt down at the head of the table. The women are keening softly and swaying themselves with a slow movement. Cathleen and Nora kneel at the other end of the table. The men kneel near the door._]  MAURYA. _Raising her head and speaking as if she did not see the people around her._—They’re all gone now, and there isn’t anything more the sea can do to me.... I’ll have no call now to be up crying and praying when the wind breaks from the south, and you can hear the surf is in the east, and the surf is in the west, making a great stir with the two noises, and they hitting one on the other. I’ll have no call now to be going down and getting Holy Water in the dark nights after Samhain, and I won’t care what way the sea is when the other women will be keening. [_To Nora_]. Give me the Holy Water, Nora, there’s a small sup still on the dresser.  [_Nora gives it to her._]  MAURYA. _Drops Michael’s clothes across Bartley’s feet, and sprinkles the Holy Water over him._—It isn’t that I haven’t prayed for you, Bartley, to the Almighty God. It isn’t that I haven’t said prayers in the dark night till you wouldn’t know what I’ld be saying; but it’s a great rest I’ll have now, and it’s time surely. It’s a great rest I’ll have now, and great sleeping in the long nights after Samhain, if it’s only a bit of wet flour we do have to eat, and maybe a fish that would be stinking.  [_She kneels down again, crossing herself, and saying prayers under her breath._]  CATHLEEN. _To an old man._—Maybe yourself and Eamon would make a coffin when the sun rises. We have fine white boards herself bought, God help her, thinking Michael would be found, and I have a new cake you can eat while you’ll be working.  THE OLD MAN. _Looking at the boards._—Are there nails with them?  CATHLEEN. There are not, Colum; we didn’t think of the nails.  ANOTHER MAN. It’s a great wonder she wouldn’t think of the nails, and all the coffins she’s seen made already.  CATHLEEN. It’s getting old she is, and broken.  [_Maurya stands up again very slowly and spreads out the pieces of Michael’s clothes beside the body, sprinkling them with the last of the Holy Water_.]  NORA. _In a whisper to Cathleen._—She’s quiet now and easy; but the day Michael was drowned you could hear her crying out from this to the spring well. It’s fonder she was of Michael, and would any one have thought that?  CATHLEEN. _Slowly and clearly._—An old woman will be soon tired with anything she will do, and isn’t it nine days herself is after crying and keening, and making great sorrow in the house?  MAURYA. _Puts the empty cup mouth downwards on the table, and lays her hands together on Bartley’s feet._—They’re all together this time, and the end is come. May the Almighty God have mercy on Bartley’s soul, and on Michael’s soul, and on the souls of Sheamus and Patch, and Stephen and Shawn [_bending her head_]; and may He have mercy on my soul, Nora, and on the soul of every one is left living in the world.  [_She pauses, and the keen rises a little more loudly from the women, then sinks away._]  MAURYA. _Continuing._—Michael has a clean burial in the far north, by the grace of the Almighty God. Bartley will have a fine coffin out of the white boards, and a deep grave surely. What more can we want than that? No man at all can be living for ever, and we must be satisfied.  [_She kneels down again and the curtain falls slowly._]"]]]
