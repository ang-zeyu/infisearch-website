But you said you would be back to-night; and you weren't here when I came. I telephoned and found that the train had come in all right, and that there wasn't another until the morning. Tomorrow morning's my limit, and to-morrow's the match.\" He stopped as he saw what Raffles was doing. \"Don't, Raffles, I don't deserve it!\" he added in fresh distress.  But Raffles had unlocked the tantalus and found a syphon in the corner cupboard, and it was a very yellow bumper that he handed to the guilty youth.  \"Drink some,\" he said, \"or I won't listen to another word.\"  \"I'm going to be ruined before the match begins. I am!\" the poor fellow insisted, turning to me when Raffles shook his head. \"And it'll break my father's heart, and--and--\"  I thought he had worse still to tell us, he broke off in such despair; but either he changed his mind, or the current of his thoughts set inward in spite of him, for when he spoke again it was to offer us both a further explanation of his conduct.  \"I only came up to leave a line for Raffles,\" he said to me, \"in case he did get back in time. It was the porter himself who fixed me up at that bureau. He'll tell you how many times I had called before. And then I saw before my nose in one pigeon-hole your cheque-book, Raffles, and your pass-book bulging with old cheques.\"  \"And as I wasn't back to write one for you,\" said Raffles, \"you wrote it for me. And quite right, too!\"  \"Don't laugh at me!\" cried the boy, his lost colour rushing back. And he looked at me again as though my long face hurt him less than the sprightly sympathy of his friend.  \"I'm not laughing, Teddy,\" replied Raffles kindly. \"I was never more serious in my life. It was playing the friend to come to me at all in your fix, but it was the act of a real good pal to draw on me behind my back rather than let me feel I'd ruined you by not turning up in time. You may shake your head as hard as you like, but I never was paid a higher compliment.\"  And the consummate casuist went on working a congenial vein until a less miserable sinner might have been persuaded that he had done nothing really dishonourable; but young Garland had the grace neither to make nor to accept any excuse for his own conduct. I never heard a man more down upon himself, or confession of error couched in stronger terms; and yet there was something so sincere and ingenuous in his remorse, something that Raffles and I had lost so long ago, that in our hearts I am sure we took his follies more seriously than our own crimes. But foolish he indeed had been, if not criminally foolish as he said. It was the old story of the prodigal son of an indulgent father. There had been, as I suspected, a certain amount of youthful riot which the influence of Raffles had already quelled; but there had also been much reckless extravagance, of which Raffles naturally knew less, since your scapegrace is constitutionally quicker to confess himself as such than as a fool. Suffice it that this one had thrown himself on his father's generosity, only to find that the father himself was in financial straits.  \"What!\" cried Raffles, \"with that house on his hands?\"  \"I knew it would surprise you,\" said Teddy Garland. \"I can't understand it myself; he gave me no particulars, but the mere fact was enough for me. I simply couldn't tell my father everything after that. He wrote me a cheque for all I did own up to, but I could see it was such a tooth that I swore I'd never come on him to pay another farthing. And I never will!\"  The boy took a sip from his glass, for his voice had faltered, and then he paused to light another cigarette, because the last had gone out between his fingers. So sensitive and yet so desperate was the blonde young face, with the creased forehead and the nervous mouth, that I saw Raffles look another way until the match was blown out.  \"But at the time I might have done worse, and did,\" said Teddy, \"a thousand times! I went to the Jews. That's the whole trouble. There were more debts--debts of honour--and to square up I went to the Jews. It was only a matter of two or three hundred to start with; but you may know, though I didn't, what a snowball the smallest sum becomes in the hands of those devils. I borrowed three hundred and signed a promissory note for four hundred and fifty-six.\"  \"Only fifty per cent!\" said Raffles. \"You got off cheap if the percentage was per annum.\"  \"Wait a bit! It was by way of being even more reasonable than that. The four hundred and fifty-six was repayable in monthly instalments of twenty quid, and I kept them up religiously until the sixth payment fell due. That was soon after Christmas, when one's always hard up, and for the first time I was a day or two late--not more, mind you; yet what do you suppose happened? My cheque was returned, and the whole blessed balance demanded on the nail!\"  Raffles was following intently, with that complete concentration which was a signal force in his equipment. His face no longer changed at anything he heard; it was as strenuously attentive as that of any judge upon the bench. Never had I clearer vision of the man he might have been but for the kink in his nature which had made him what he was.  \"The promissory note was for four-fifty-six,\" said he, \"and this sudden demand was for the lot less the hundred you had paid?\"  \"That's it.\"  \"What did you do?\" I asked, not to seem behind Raffles in my grasp of the case.  \"Told them to take my instalment or go to blazes for the rest!\"  \"And they?\"  \"Absolutely drop the whole thing until this very week, and then come down on me for--what do you suppose?\"  \"Getting on for a thousand,\" said Raffles after a moment's thought.  \"Nonsense!\" I cried. Garland looked astonished too.  \"Raffles knows all about it,\" said he. \"Seven hundred was the actual figure. I needn't tell you I have given the bounders a wide berth since the day I raised the wind; but I went and had it out with them over this. And half the seven hundred is for default interest, I'll trouble you, from the beginning of January down to date!\"  \"Had you agreed to that?\"  \"Not to my recollection, but there it was as plain as a pikestaff on my promissory note. A halfpenny in the shilling per week over and above everything else when the original interest wasn't forthcoming.\"  \"Printed or written on your note of hand?\"  \"Printed--printed small, I needn't tell you--but quite large enough for me to read when I signed the cursed bond. In fact I believe I did read it; but a halfpenny a week! Who could ever believe it would mount up like that? But it does; it's right enough, and the long and short of it is that unless I pay up by twelve o'clock to-morrow the governor's to be called in to say whether he'll pay up for me or see me made a bankrupt under his nose. Twelve o'clock, when the match begins! Of course they know that, and are trading on it. Only this evening I had the most insolent ultimatum, saying it was my 'dead and last chance.'\"  \"So then you came round here?\"  \"I was coming in any case. I wish I'd shot myself first!\"  \"My dear fellow, it was doing me proud; don't let us lose our sense of proportion, Teddy.\"  But young Garland had his face upon his hand, and once more he was the miserable man who had begun brokenly to unfold the history of his shame. The unconscious animation produced by the mere unloading of his heart, the natural boyish slang with which his tale had been freely garnished, had faded from his face, had died upon his lips. Once more he was a soul in torments of despair and degradation; and yet once more did the absence of the abject in man and manner redeem him from the depths of either. In these moments of reaction he was pitiful, but not contemptible, much less unlovable. Indeed, I could see the qualities that had won the heart of Raffles as I had never seen them before. There is a native nobility not to be destroyed by a single descent into the ignoble, an essential honesty too bright and brilliant to be dimmed by incidental dishonour; and both remained to the younger man, in the eyes of the other two, who were even then determining to preserve in him all that they themselves had lost. The thought came naturally enough to me. And yet I may well have derived it from a face that for once was easy to read, a clear-cut face that had never looked so sharp in profile, or, to my knowledge, half so gentle in expression.  \"And what about these Jews?\" asked Raffles at length.  \"There's really only one.\"  \"Are we to guess his name?\"  \"No, I don't mind telling you. It's Dan Levy.\"  \"Of course it is!\" cried Raffles with a nod for me. \"Our Mr. Shylock in all his glory!\"  Teddy snatched his face from his hands.  \"You don't know him, do you?\"  \"I might almost say I know him at home,\" said Raffles. \"But as a matter of fact I met him abroad.\"  Teddy was on his feet.  \"But do you know him well enough--\"  \"Certainly. I'll see him in the morning. But I ought to have the receipts for the various instalments you have paid, and perhaps that letter saying it was your last chance.\"  \"Here they all are,\" said Garland, producing a bulky envelope. \"But of course I'll come with you--\"  \"Of course you'll do nothing of the kind, Teddy! I won't have your eye put out for the match by that old ruffian, and I'm not going to let you sit up all night either. Where are you staying, my man?\"  \"Nowhere yet. I left my kit at the club. I was going out home if I'd caught you early enough.\"  \"Stout fellow! You stay here.\"  \"My dear old man, I couldn't think of it,\" said Teddy gratefully.  \"My dear young man, I don't care whether you think of it or not. Here you stay, and moreover you turn in at once. I can fix you up with all you want, and Barraclough shall bring your kit round before you're awake.\"  \"But you haven't got a bed, Raffles?\"  \"You shall have mine. I hardly ever go to bed--do I, Bunny?\"  \"I've seldom seen you there,\" said I. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9806"],["title","Mr. Justice Raffles (#3)"],["body"," \"But you were travelling all last night?\"  \"And straight through till this evening, and I sleep all the time in a train,\" said Raffles. \"I hardly opened an eye all day; if I turned in to-night I shouldn't get a wink.\"  \"Well, I shan't either,\" said the other hopelessly. \"I've forgotten how to sleep!\"  \"Wait till I learn you!\" said Raffles, and went into the inner room and lit it up.  \"I'm terribly sorry about it all,\" whispered young Garland, turning to me as though we were old friends now.  \"And I'm sorry for you,\" said I from my heart. \"I know what it is.\"  Garland was still staring when Raffles returned with a tiny bottle from which he was shaking little round black things into his left palm.  \"Clean sheets yawning for you, Teddy,\" said he. \"And now take two of these, and one more spot of whisky, and you'll be asleep in ten minutes.\"  \"What are they?\"  \"Somnol. The latest thing out, and quite the best.\"  \"But won't they give me a frightful head?\"  \"Not a bit of it; you'll be as right as rain ten minutes after you wake up. And you needn't leave this before eleven to-morrow morning, because you don't want a knock at the nets, do you?\"  \"I ought to have one,\" said Teddy seriously. But Raffles laughed him to scorn.  \"They're not playing you for runs, my man, and I shouldn't run any risks with those hands. Remember all the chances they're going to lap up to-morrow, and all the byes they've not got to let!\"  And Raffles had administered his opiate before the patient knew much more about it; next minute he was shaking hands with me, and the minute after that Raffles went in to put out his light. He was gone some little time; and I remember leaning out of the window in order not to overhear the conversation in the next room. The night was nearly as fine as ever. The starry ceiling over the Albany Courtyard was only less beautifully blue than when Raffles and I had come in a couple of hours ago. The traffic in Piccadilly came as crisply to the ear as on a winter's night of hard frost. It was a night of wine, and sparkling wine, and the day at Lord's must surely be a day of nectar. I could not help wondering whether any man had ever played in the University match with such a load upon his soul as E.M. Garland was taking to his forced slumbers; and then whether any heavy-laden soul had ever hit upon two such brother confessors as Raffles and myself!     CHAPTER III  Council of War   Raffles was humming a snatch of something too choice for me to recognise when I drew in my head from the glorious night. The folding-doors were shut, and the grandfather's clock on one side of them made it almost midnight. Raffles would not stop his tune for me, but he pointed to the syphon and decanter, and I replenished my glass. He had a glass beside him also, which was less usual, but he did not sit down beside his glass; he was far too fidgety for that; even bothering about a pair of pictures which had changed places under some zealous hand in his absence, or rather two of Mr. Hollyer's fine renderings of Watts and Burne-Jones of which I had never seen Raffles take the slightest notice before. But it seemed that they must hang where he had hung them, and for once I saw them hanging straight. The books had also suffered from good intentions; he gave them up with a shrug. Archives and arcana he tested or examined, and so a good many minutes passed without a word. But when he stole back into the inner room, after waiting a little at the folding-doors, there was still some faint strain upon his lips; it was only when he returned, shutting the door none too quietly behind him, that he stopped humming and spoke out with a grimmer face than he had worn all night.  \"That boy's in a bigger hole than he thinks. But we must pull him out between us before play begins. It's one clear call for us, Bunny!\"  \"Is it a bigger hole than you thought?\" I asked, thinking myself of the conversation which I had managed not to overhear.  \"I don't say that, Bunny, though I never should have dreamt of his old father being in one too. I own I can't understand that. They live in a regular country house in the middle of Kensington, and there are only the two of them. But I've given Teddy my word not to go to the old man for the money, so it's no use talking about it.\"  But apparently it was what they had been talking about behind the folding-doors; it only surprised me to see how much Raffles took it to heart.  \"So you have made up your mind to raise the money elsewhere?\"  \"Before that lad in there opens his eyes.\"  \"Is he asleep already?\"  \"Like the dead,\" said Raffles, dropping into his chair and drinking thoughtfully; \"and so he will be till we wake him up. It's a ticklish experiment, Bunny, but even a splitting head for the first hour's play is better than a sleepless night; I've tried both, so I ought to know. I shouldn't even wonder if he did himself more than justice to-morrow; one often does when just less than fit; it takes off that dangerous edge of over-keenness which so often cuts one's own throat.\"  \"But what do you think of it all, A.J.?\"  \"Not so much worse than I let him think I thought.\"  \"But you must have been amazed?\"  \"I am past amazement at the worst thing the best of us ever does, and contrariwise of course. Your rich man proves a pauper, and your honest man plays the knave; we're all of us capable of every damned thing. But let us thank our stars and Teddy's that we got back just when we did.\"  \"Why at that moment?\"  Raffles produced the unfinished cheque, shook his head over it, and sent it fluttering across to me.  \"Was there ever such a childish attempt? They'd have kept him in the bank while they sent for the police. If ever you want to play this game, Bunny, you must let me coach you up a bit.\"  \"But it was never one of your games, A.J.!\"  \"Only incidentally once or twice; it never appealed to me,\" said Raffles, sending expanding circlets of smoke to crown the girls on the Golden Stair that was no longer tilted in a leaning tower. \"No, Bunny, an occasional _exeat_ at school is my modest record as a forger, though I admit that augured ill. Do you remember how I left my cheque-book about on purpose for what's happened? To be sinned against instead of sinning, in all the papers, would have set one up as an honest man for life. I thought, God forgive me, of poor old Barraclough or somebody of that kind. And to think it should be 'the friend in whom my soul confided'! Not that I ever did confide in him, Bunny, much as I love this lad.\"  Despite the tense of that last statement, it was the old Raffles who was speaking now, the incisively cynical old Raffles that I still knew the best, the Raffles of the impudent quotations and jaunty _jeux d'esprit_. This Raffles only meant half he said--but had generally done the other half! I met his mood by reminding him (out of his own _Whitaker_) that the sun rose at 3.51, in case he thought of breaking in anywhere that night. I had the honour of making Raffles smile.  \"I did think of it, Bunny,\" said he. \"But there's only one crib that we could crack in decency for this money; and our Mr. Shylock's is not the sort of city that Caesar himself would have taken _ex itinere_. It's a case for the _testudo_ and all the rest of it. You must remember that I've been there, Bunny; at least I've visited his 'moving tent,' if one may jump from an ancient to an 'Ancient and Modern.' And if that was as impregnable as I found it, his permanent citadel must be perched upon the very rock of defence!\"  \"You must tell me about that, Raffles,\" said I, tiring a little of his kaleidoscopic metaphors. Let him be as allusive as he liked when there was no risky work on hand, and I was his lucky and delighted audience till all hours of the night or morning. But for a deed of darkness I wanted fewer fireworks, a steadier light from his intellectual lantern. And yet these were the very moments that inspired his pyrotechnic displays.  \"Oh, I shall tell you all right,\" said Raffles. \"But just now the next few hours are of more importance than the last few weeks. Of course Shylock's the man for our money; but knowing our tribesmen as I do, I think we had better begin by borrowing it like simple Christians.\"  \"Then we have it to pay back again.\"  \"And that's the psychological moment for raiding our 'miser's sunless coffers'--if he happens to have any. It will give us time to find out.\"  \"But he doesn't keep open office all night,\" I objected.  \"But he opens at nine o'clock in the morning,\" said Raffles, \"to catch the early stockbroker who would rather be bled than hammered.\"  \"Who told you that?\"  \"Our Mrs. Shylock.\"  \"You must have made great friends with her?\"  \"More in pity than for the sake of secrets.\"  \"But you went where the secrets were?\"  \"And she gave them away wholesale.\"  \"She would,\" I said, \"to you.\"  \"She told me a lot about the impending libel action.\"  \"Shylock _v. Fact?_\"  \"Yes; it's coming on before the vacation, you know.\"  \"So I saw in some paper.\"  \"But you know what it's all about, Bunny?\"  \"No, I don't.\"  \"Another old rascal, the Maharajah of Hathipur, and his perfectly fabulous debts. It seems he's been in our Mr. Shylock's clutches for years, but instead of taking his pound of flesh he's always increasing the amount. Of course that's the whole duty of money-lenders, but now they say the figure runs well into six. No one has any sympathy with that old heathen; he's said to have been a pal of Nana's before the Mutiny, and in it up to the neck he only saved by turning against his own lot in time; in any case it's the pot and the kettle so far as moral colour is concerned. But I believe it's an actual fact that syndicates have been formed to buy up the black man's debts and take a reasonable interest, only the dirty white man always gets to windward of the syndicate. They're on the point of bringing it off, when old Levy inveigles the nigger into some new Oriental extravagance. _Fact_ has exposed the whole"]]]
