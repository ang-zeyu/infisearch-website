But no longer was that stately form clad in the loose and peaceful garb of the Eastern santon.  Complete armour cased his broad chest and sinewy limbs; his head alone was bare, and his prominent and impressive features were lighted, not with mystical enthusiasm, but with warlike energy.  In his right hand, he carried a drawn sword--his left supported the staff of a snow-white and dazzling banner.  So sudden was the apparition, and so excited the mind of the king, that the sight of a supernatural being could scarcely have impressed him with more amaze and awe.  \"King of Granada,\" said Almamen, \"the hour hath come at last; go forth and conquer!  With the Christian monarch, there is no hope of peace or compact.  At thy request I sought him, but my spells alone preserved the life of thy herald.  Rejoice! for thine evil destinies have rolled away from thy spirit, like a cloud from the glory of the sun.  The genii of the East have woven this banner from the rays of benignant stars.  It shall beam before thee in the front of battle--it shall rise over the rivers of Christian blood.  As the moon sways the bosom of the tides, it shall sway and direct the surges and the course of war!\"  \"Man of mystery! thou hast given me a new life.\"  \"And, fighting by thy side,\" resumed Almamen, \"I will assist to carve out for thee, from the ruins of Arragon and Castile, the grandeur of a new throne.  Arm, monarch of Granada!--arm!  I hear the neigh of thy charger, in the midst of the mailed thousands!

CHAPTER.  I.  LEILA IN THE CASTLE--THE SIEGE.  The calmer contemplations and more holy anxieties of Leila were, at length, broken in upon by intelligence, the fearful interest of which absorbed the whole mind and care of every inhabitant of the castle. Boabdil el Chico had taken the field, at the head of a numerous army. Rapidly scouring the country, he had descended, one after one, upon the principal fortresses, which Ferdinand had left, strongly garrisoned, in the immediate neighbourhood.  His success was as immediate as it was signal; the terror of his arms began, once more to spread far and wide; every day swelled his ranks with new recruits; and from the snow-clad summits of the Sierra Nevada poured down, in wild hordes, the fierce mountain race, who, accustomed to eternal winter, made a strange contrast, in their rugged appearance and shaggy clothing, to the glittering and civilised soldiery of Granada.  Moorish towns, which had submitted to Ferdinand, broke from their allegiance, and sent their ardent youth and experienced veterans to the standard of the Keys and Crescent.  To add to the sudden panic of the Spaniards, it went forth that a formidable magician, who seemed inspired rather with the fury of a demon than the valour of a man, had made an abrupt appearance in the ranks of the Moslems.  Wherever the Moors shrank back from wall or tower, down which poured the boiling pitch, or rolled the deadly artillery of the besieged, this sorcerer--rushing into the midst of the flagging force, and waving, with wild gestures, a white banner, supposed by both Moor and Christian to be the work of magic and preternatural spells--dared every danger, and escaped every weapon: with voice, with prayer, with example, he fired the Moors to an enthusiasm that revived the first days of Mohammedan conquest; and tower after tower, along the mighty range of the mountain chain of fortresses, was polluted by the wave and glitter of the ever-victorious banner.  The veteran, Mendo de Quexada, who, with a garrison of two hundred and fifty men, held the castle of Almamen, was, however, undaunted by the unprecedented successes of Boabdil.  Aware of the approaching storm, he spent the days of peace yet accorded to him in making every preparation for the siege that he foresaw; messengers were despatched to Ferdinand; new out-works were added to the castle; ample store of provisions laid in; and no precaution omitted that could still preserve to the Spaniards a fortress that, from its vicinity to Granada, its command of the Vega and the valleys of the Alpuxarras, was the bitterest thorn in the side of the Moorish power.  It was early, one morning, that Leila stood by the lattice of her lofty chamber gazing, with many and mingled emotions, on the distant domes of Granada, as they slept in the silent sunshine.  Her heart, for the moment, was busy with the thoughts of home, and the chances and peril of the time were forgotten.  The sound of martial music, afar off, broke upon her reveries; she started, and listened breathlessly; it became more distinct and clear. The clash of the zell, the boom of the African drum, and the wild and barbarous blast of the Moorish clarion, were now each distinguishable from the other; and, at length, as she gazed and listened, winding along the steeps of the mountain were seen the gleaming spears and pennants of the Moslem vanguard.  Another moment and the whole castle was astir.  Mendo de Quexada, hastily arming, repaired, himself, to the battlements; and, from her lattice, Leila beheld him, from time to time, stationing to the best advantage his scanty troops.  In a few minutes she was joined by Donna Inez and the women of the castle, who fearfully clustered round their mistress,--not the less disposed, however, to gratify the passion of the sex, by a glimpse through the lattice at the gorgeous array of the Moorish army.  The casements of Leila's chamber were peculiarly adapted to command a safe nor insufficient view of the progress of the enemy; and, with a beating heart and flushing cheek, the Jewish maiden, deaf to the voices around her, imagined she could already descry amidst the horsemen the lion port and snowy garments of Muza Ben Abil Gazan.  What a situation was hers!  Already a Christian, could she hope for the success of the infidel? ever a woman, could she hope for the defeat of her lover?  But the time for meditation on her destiny was but brief; the detachment of the Moorish cavalry was now just without the walls of the little town that girded the castle, and the loud clarion of the heralds summoned the garrison to surrender.  \"Not while one stone stands upon another!\" was the short answer of Quexada; and, in ten minutes afterwards, the sullen roar of the artillery broke from wall and tower over the vales below.  It was then that the women, from Leila's lattice, beheld, slowly marshalling themselves in order, the whole power and pageantry of the besieging army.  Thick-serried--line after line, column upon column--they spread below the frowning steep.  The sunbeams lighted up that goodly array, as it swayed, and murmured, and advanced, like the billows of a glittering sea.  The royal standard was soon descried waving above the pavilion of Boabdil; and the king himself, mounted on his cream-coloured charger, which was covered with trappings of cloth-of-gold, was recognised amongst the infantry, whose task it was to lead the assault.  \"Pray with us, my daughter!\" cried Inez, falling on her knees.-Alas! what could Leila pray for?  Four days and four nights passed away in that memorable siege; for the moon, then at her full, allowed no respite, even in night itself.  Their numbers, and their vicinity to Granada, gave the besiegers the advantage of constant relays, and troop succeeded to troop; so that the weary had ever successors in the vigour of new assailants.  On the fifth day, all of the fortress, save the keep (an immense tower), was in the hands of the Moslems; and in this last hold, the worn-out and scanty remnant of the garrison mustered, in the last hope of a brave, despair.  Quexada appeared, covered with gore and dust-his eyes bloodshot, his cheek haggard and hollow, his locks blanched with sudden age-in the hall of the tower, where the women, half dead with terror, were assembled.  \"Food!\" cried he,--\"food and wine!--it may be our last banquet.\"  His wife threw her arms round him.  \"Not yet,\" he cried, \"not yet; we will have one embrace before we part.\"  \"Is there, then, no hope?\" said Inez, with a pale cheek, yet steady eye.  \"None; unless to-morrow's dawn gild the spears of Ferdinand's army upon yonder hills.  Till morn we may hold out.\"  As he spoke, he hastily devoured some morsels of food, drained a huge goblet of wine, and abruptly quitted the chamber.  At that moment, the women distinctly heard the loud shouts of the Moors; and Leila, approaching the grated casement, could perceive the approach of what seemed to her like moving wails.  Covered by ingenious constructions of wood and thick hides, the besiegers advanced to the foot of the tower in comparative shelter from the burning streams which still poured, fast and seething, from the battlements; while, in the rear came showers of darts and cross-bolts from the more distant Moors, protecting the work of the engineer, and piercing through almost every loophole and crevice in the fortress.  Meanwhile the stalwart governor beheld, with dismay and despair, the preparations of the engineers, whom the wooden screen-works protected from every weapon.  \"By the Holy Sepulchre!\" cried he, gnashing his teeth, \"they are mining the tower, and we shall be buried in its ruins!  Look out, Gonsalvo!  see you not a gleam of spears yonder over the mountain?  Mine eyes are dim with watching.\"  \"Alas! brave Mendo, it is only the sloping sun upon the snows--but there is hope yet.\"  The soldier's words terminated in a shrill and sudden cry of agony; and he fell dead by the side of Quexada, the brain crushed by a bolt from a Moorish arquebus.  \"My best warrior!\" said Quexada; \"peace be with him!  Ho, there! see you yon desperate infidel urging on the miners?  By the heavens above, it is he of the white banner!--it is the sorcerer!  Fire on him! he is without the shelter of the woodworks.\"  Twenty shafts, from wearied and nerveless arms, fell innocuous round the form of Almamen: and as, waving aloft his ominous banner, he disappeared again behind the screen-works, the Spaniards almost fancied they could hear his exulting and demon laugh.  The sixth day came, and the work of the enemy was completed.  The tower was entirely undermined--the foundations rested only upon wooden props, which, with a humanity that was characteristic of Boabdil, had been placed there in order that the besieged might escape ere the final crash of their last hold.  It was now noon: the whole Moorish force, quitting the plain, occupied the steep that spread below the tower, in multitudinous array and breathless expectation.  The miners stood aloof--the Spaniards lay prostrate and exhausted upon the battlements, like mariners who, after every effort against the storm, await, resigned, and almost indifferent, the sweep of the fatal surge.  Suddenly the lines of the Moors gave way, and Boabdil himself, with Muza at his right hand, and Almamen on his left, advanced towards the foot of the tower.  At the same time, the Ethiopian guards, each bearing a torch, marched slowly in the rear; and from the midst of"]]]
