It is a perpetual worry to you to hear aunt going on, on, on--nagging, nagging, nagging for ever and ever at us. She is fond of you and kind to you, and you would get on quietly enough without us, while now she is in a fidget whenever you are with us, and is constantly at you not to learn mischief and bad ways from us. Besides you are always in a fright now, lest we should get into some awful scrape, as I expect we should if we stopped here. If it weren't for you, we should not let her off as easily as we do. No, no, Rhoda, it is better for us all that we should go.\"  Poor Rhoda, though she cried bitterly at the thought of losing her brothers, yet could not but allow to herself that in many respects she should be more happy when she was freed from anxiety, lest they should get into some scrape, and when her aunt would not be kept in a state of continued irritation and scolding. She felt too that, although she herself could get on well enough in her changed life, that it was very hard indeed for the boys, accustomed as they had been to the jolly and independent life of a public school, and to be their own master during the holidays, with their ponies, amusements, and their freedom to come and go when they chose. Rhoda was a thoughtful child, and felt that nothing that they could go through could do them more harm or make them more unhappy than they now were. She had thought it all over day after day, for she was sure that the boys would, sooner or later come to it, and she had convinced herself that it was better for them. Still it was with a very sad heart that she found that the time had come.  For some time she cried in silence, and then, drying her eyes, she said, trying to speak bravely, though her lips quivered.  \"I shall miss you dreadfully, boys; but I will not say a word to keep you here, for I am sure it is very, very bad for you. What do you mean to do? Do you mean to go to sea?\"  \"No, Rhoda; you see uncle was in the army, and used to talk to us about that; and, as we have never seen the sea, we don't care for it as some boys do. No, we shall try and go as soldiers.\"  \"But my dear Tom, they will never take you as soldiers; you are too little.\"  \"Yes, we are not old enough to enlist at present,\" Tom said; \"but we might go in as buglers. We have thought it all over, and have been paying old Wetherley, who was once in the band of a regiment, to teach us the bugle, and he says we can sound all the calls now as well as any bugler going. We did not like to tell you till we had made up our minds to go; but we have gone regularly to him every day since the first week we came here.\"  \"Then you won't have to fight, Tom,\" Rhoda said joyfully.  \"No,\" Tom said, in a rather dejected tone; \"I am afraid they won't let us fight; still we shall see fighting, which is the next best thing.\"  \"I heard in Warley yesterday that there will be a movement of the army in Spain soon, and that some more troops will be sent out, and we shall try and get into a regiment that is going.\"  They talked very long and earnestly on their plans, and were so engrossed that they quite forgot how time went, and got in late for tea, and were terribly scolded in consequence. For once none of them cared for the storm; the boys exulted over the thought that it would be the last scolding they would have to suffer; and Rhoda had difficulty in gasping down her tears at the thought that it was the last meal that she would take with them, for they had settled that they would start that very night.     CHAPTER III.  ENLISTED.   It was a bright moonlight night when the boys, after a sad farewell from Rhoda, let themselves down from the window, and started upon their journey. Each carried a bundle on a stick; each bundle contained a suit of clothes, a few shirts and stockings, a pair of shoes, and a pistol. The other pistols were carried loaded inside their jackets, for there was no saying whom they might meet upon the road. They had put on the oldest suit of clothes they possessed, so as to attract as little attention as possible by the way. After they had once recovered from their parting with Rhoda their spirits rose, and they tramped along lightly and cheerfully. It was eleven o'clock when they started, and through the night they did not meet a single person. Towards morning they got under a haystack near the road, and slept for some hours; then they walked steadily on until they had done twenty miles since their start. They went into a small inn, and had some breakfast, and then purchasing some bread and cold ham, went on through the town, and leaving the London road, followed that leading to Portsmouth, and after a mile or two again took up their quarters until evening, in a haystack.  It is not necessary to give the details of the journey to Portsmouth. After the first two days' tramp, having no longer any fear of the pursuit, which, no doubt, had been made for them when first missed, they walked by day, and slept at night in sheds, or under haystacks, as they were afraid of being questioned and perhaps stopped at inns. They walked only short distances now, for the first night's long journey had galled their feet, and, as Tom said, they were not pressed for time, and did not want to arrive at Portsmouth like two limping tramps. Walking, therefore, only twelve miles a day after the first two days, they arrived at Portsmouth fresh and in high spirits. They had met with no adventures upon the road, except that upon one occasion two tramps had attempted to seize their bundles, but the production of the pistols, and the evident determination of the boys to use them if necessary, made the men abandon their intention and make off, with much bad language and many threats, at which the boys laughed disdainfully.  Arrived at Portsmouth, their first care was to find a quiet little inn, where they could put up. This they had little difficulty in doing, for Portsmouth abounded with public-houses, and people were so much accustomed to young fellows tramping in with their bundles, to join their ships, that their appearance excited no curiosity whatever. Tom looked older than he really was, although not tall for his age, while Peter, if anything, overtopped his brother, but was slighter, and looked fully two years younger. Refreshed by a long night's sleep between sheets, they started out after breakfast to see the town, and were greatly impressed and delighted by the bustle of the streets, full of soldiers and sailors, and still more by the fortifications and the numerous ships of war lying in the harbor, or out at Spithead. A large fleet of merchantmen was lying off at anchor, waiting for a convoy, and a perfect fleet of little wherries was plying backwards and forwards between the vessels and the shore.  \"It makes one almost wish to be a sailor,\" Peter said, as they sat upon the Southsea beach, and looked out at the animated ocean.  \"It does, Peter; and if it had been ten years back, instead of at present, I should have been ready enough to change our plans. But what is the use of going to sea now? The French and Spanish navies skulk in harbor, and the first time our fellows get them out they will he sure to smash them altogether, and then there is an end to all fighting. No, Peter, it looks tempting, I grant, but we shall see ten times as much with the army. We must go and settle the thing to-morrow. There is no time to be lost if the expedition starts in a fortnight or three weeks.\"  Returning into the town, the boys were greatly amused at seeing a sailor's wedding. Four carriages and pair drove along; inside were women, while four sailors sat on each roof, waving their hats to the passers-by, and refreshing themselves by repeated pulls at some black bottles, with which they were well supplied. Making inquiries, the boys found that the men belonged to a fine frigate which had come in a day or two before, with several prizes.  The next morning they went down to the barracks. Several non-commissioned officers, with bunches of gay ribbons in their caps, were standing about. Outside the gates were some boards, with notices, \"Active young fellows required. Good pay, plenty of prize-money, and chances, of promotion!\"  The boys read several of these notices, which differed only from each other in the name of the regiment; and then Tom gave an exclamation of satisfaction as he glanced at a note at the foot of one of them, \"Two or three active lads wanted as buglers.\"  \"There we are, Peter; and, oh, what luck! it is Uncle Peter's regiment! Look here, Peter,\" he said, after a pause, \"we won't say anything about being his nephews, unless there is no other way of getting taken; for if we do it won't be nice. We shall be taken notice of, and not treated like other fellows, and that will cause all sorts of ill-feeling and jealousy, and rows. It will be quite time to say who we are when we have done something to show that we shan't do discredit to him. You see it isn't much in our favor that we are here as two runaway boys. If we were older we could go as volunteers, but of course we are too young for that.\"  It should be mentioned that in those days it was by no means unusual for young men who had not sufficient interest to get commissions to obtain permission to accompany a regiment as volunteers. They paid their own expenses, and lived with the officers, but did duty as private soldiers. If they distinguished themselves, they obtained commissions to fill up vacancies caused in action.  \"There is our sergeant, Tom; let's get it over at once.\"  \"If you please,\" Tom said, as they went up to the sergeant, \"are you the recruiting sergeant of the Norfolk Rangers?\"  \"By Jove, Summers, you are in luck to-day,\" laughed one of the other sergeants; \"here are two valuable recruits for the Rangers. The Mounseers will have no chance with the regiment with such"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9613"],["title","The Young Buglers (#7)"],["body","as those in it. Come, my fine fellows, let me persuade you to join the 15th. Such little bantams as you are would be thrown away upon the Rangers.\"  There was a shout of laughter from the other non-commissioned officers.  Tom was too much accustomed to chaffing bargees at Eton to be put out of countenance.  \"We may be bantams,\" he said, \"but I have seen a bantam lick a big dunghill cock many a time. Fine feathers don't always make fine birds, my man.\"  \"Well answered, young one,\" the sergeant of the Rangers said, while there was a general laugh among the others, for the sergeant of the 15th was not a favorite.  \"You think yourself sharp, youngster,\" he said angrily. \"You want a licking, you do; and if you were in the 15th, you'd get it pretty quickly.\"  \"Oh! I beg your pardon,\" Tom said gravely; \"I did not know that the 15th were famous for thrashing boys. Thank you; when I enlist it shall be in a regiment where men hit fellows their own size.\"  There was a shout of laughter, and the sergeant, enraged, stepped forward, and gave Tom a swinging box on the ear.  There was a cry of \"shame\" from the others; but before any of them could interfere, Tom suddenly stooped, caught the sergeant by the bottom of the trousers, and in an instant he fell on his back with a crash.  For a moment he was slightly stunned, and then, regaining his feet, he was about to rush at Tom, when the others threw themselves in between them, and said he should not touch the boy. He struck him first, and the boy had only given him what served him right.  The sergeant was furious, and an angry quarrel was going on, when an officer of the Rangers came suddenly out of barrack.  \"Hullo, Summers, what is all this about? I am surprised at you. A lot of non-commissioned officers, just in front of the barrack gates, quarreling like drunken sailors in a pothouse. What does it all mean?\"  \"The fact is this, Captain Manley,\" the sergeant said, saluting, \"these two lads came up to speak to me, when Sergeant Billow chaffed them. The lad gave the sergeant as good as he got, and the sergeant lost his temper, and hit him a box on the ear, and in a moment the young one tripped him up, and pretty nigh stunned him; when he got up he was going at the boy, and, of course, we wouldn't have it.\"  \"Quite right,\" Captain Manley said. \"Sergeant Billow, I shall forward a report to your regiment. Chaffing people in the street, and then losing your temper, striking a boy, and causing a disturbance. Now, sergeant,\" he went on, as the others moved away, \"do you know those boys?\"  \"No, sir; they are strangers to me.\"  \"Do you want to see the sergeant privately, lads, or on something connected with the regiment?\"  \"I see that you have vacancies for buglers, sir,\" Tom said, \"and my brother and myself want to enlist if you will take us.\"  Captain Manley smiled. \"You young scamps, you have got 'runaway from home' as plainly on your faces as if it was printed there. If we were to enlist you, we should be having your friends here after you to-morrow, and get into a scrape for taking you.\"  \"We have no friends who will interfere with us, sir, I can give you my word of honor as a gentleman.\" Captain Manley laughed. \"I mean,\" Tom said confused, \"my word of honor, as--as an intending bugler.\"  \"Indeed we have no one to interfere with us in any way, sir,\" Peter put in earnestly. \"We wouldn't tell a lie even to enlist in the Rangers.\"  Captain Manley was struck by the earnestness of the boys' faces, and after a pause he said to the sergeant,--  \"That will do, Summers; I will take these lads up to my quarters and speak to them.\"  Then, motioning to the boys to follow him, he re-entered the barracks, and led the way up to his quarters.  \"Sit down,\" he said, when they had entered his room. \"Now, boys, this is a foolish freak upon your part, which you will regret some day. Of course you have run away from school.\"  \"No, sir, we have run away from home,\" Tom said.  \"So much the worse,\" Captain Manley said gravely. \"Tell me frankly, why did you do so? No unkindness at home can excuse boys from running away from their parents.\"  \"We have none, sir,\" Tom said. \"We have lost them both--our mother many years ago, our father six months. Our only living relation, except a younger sister, is an aunt, who considers us as nuisances, and who, although meaning to do her duty, simply drives us out of our minds.\"  Captain Manley could not resist a smile. \"Do you not go to school?\"  \"We did go to a school near, but unfortunately it is broken up.\"  Captain Manley caught a little look of amusement between the boys. \"I should not be surprised if you had something to do with its breaking up,\" he said with a laugh. \"But to return to your coming here. There is certainly less reason against your joining than I thought at first, but you are too young.\"  \"We are both strong, and are good walkers,\" Tom said.  \"But you cannot be much over fifteen,\" Captain Manley said, \"and your brother is younger.\"  \"We are accustomed to strong exercise, sir, and can thrash most fellows of our own size.\"  \"Very likely,\" Captain Manley said, \"but we can't take that into consideration. You are certainly young for buglers for service work; however, I will go across with you to the orderly-room, and hear what the colonel says.\"  Crossing the barrack-yard, they found the colonel was in and disengaged.  \"Colonel Tritton,\" Captain Manley said, \"these lads want to enlist as buglers.\"  The colonel looked up and smiled. \"They look regular young pickles,\" he said. \"I suppose they have run away from school.\"  \"Not from school, colonel. They have lost both parents, and live with an aunt, with whom they don't get on well. There does not seem to be much chance of their being claimed.\"  \"You are full young,\" the colonel said, \"and I think you will be sorry, boys, for the step you want to take.\"  \"I don't think so, sir,\" Tom said.  \"Of course, you don't at present,\" the colonel said. \"However, that is your business. Mind, you will have a rough time of it; you will have to fight your way, you know.\"  \"I'll back them to hold their own,\" Captain Manley said, laughing. \"When I went out at the barrack-gate just now there was a row among a lot of recruiting sergeants, and when I went up to put a stop to it, I found that a fellow of the 15th had chaffed these boys when they went up to speak to Summers, and that they had got the best of it in that line; and the fellow having lost his temper and struck one of them, he found himself on his back on the pavement. The boy had tripped him up in an instant.\"  The colonel laughed, and then said suddenly and sharply to Peter, \"Where did you learn that trick, youngster?\"  \"At Eton,\" Peter answered promptly, and then colored up hotly at his brother's reproachful glance.  \"Oh, ho! At Eton, young gentlemen, eh!\" the colonel said. \"That alters the matter. If you were at Eton your family must be people of property, and I can't let you do such a foolish thing as enlist as buglers.\"  \"Our father lost all his money suddenly, owing to a blackguard he trusted cheating him. He found it out, and it killed him,\" Tom said quietly.  The colonel saw he was speaking the truth. \"Well, well,\" he said kindly, \"we must see what we can do for you, boys. They are young, Manley, but that will improve, and by the time that they have been a year at the depôt--\"  \"Oh, if you please, colonel,\" Tom said, \"we want to go on foreign service, and it's knowing that your regiment was under orders for foreign service we came to it.\"  \"Impossible!\" the colonel said shortly.  \"I am very sorry for that, sir,\" Tom said respectfully, \"for we would rather belong to this regiment than any in the service; but if you will not let us go with it we must try another.\"  \"Why would you rather belong to us than to any other?\" the colonel asked, as the boys turned to leave the room.  \"I had rather not say, sir,\" Tom said. \"We have a reason, and a very good one, but it is not one we should like to tell.\"  The colonel was silent for a minute. He was struck with the boys' appearance and manner, and was sorry at the thought of losing them, partly from interest in themselves, partly because the sea service was generally so much more attractive to boys, that it was not easy to get them to enlist as buglers and drummers.  \"You see, lads, I should really like to take you, but we shall be starting in a fortnight, and it would be altogether impossible for you to learn to sound the bugle, to say nothing of learning the calls, by that time.\"  \"We can't play well, sir,\" Tom answered, his spirits rising again, \"but we have practiced for some time, and know a good many of the calls.\"  \"Oh, indeed!\" the colonel said, pleased; \"that alters the case. Well, lads, I should like to take you with the regiment, for you look straightforward, sharp young fellows. So I will enlist you. Work hard for the next fortnight, and if I hear a favorable report of you by that time, you shall go.\"  \"Thank you very much,\" the boys said warmly, delighted to find their hopes realized.  \"What are your names?\" the colonel asked.  \"Tom and Peter,\" Tom answered.  \"Tom and Peter what?\" the colonel said.  The boys looked at each other. The fact that they would of course be asked their names had never occurred to them, and they not had therefore consulted whether to give their own or another name.  \"Come, boys,\" Colonel Tritton said good-temperedly, \"never be ashamed of your names; don't sail under false colors, lads. I am sure you will do nothing to disgrace your names.\"  Tom looked at Peter, and saw that he agreed to give their real names, so he said, \"Tom and Peter Scudamore.\"  \"Peter Scudamore! Why, Manley, these boys must be relations of the dear old colonel. That explains why they chose the regiment. Now, boys, what relation was he of yours?\"  \"I do not admit that he was a relation at all, colonel,\" Tom said gravely, \"and I hope that you will not ask the question. Supposing that he had been a relation "]]]
