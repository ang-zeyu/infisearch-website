The Cornish ranch was a show place. He arranged a chair for Vance at his right, and presently the talk rose above the murmur to which it had been depressed by the arrival of this important stranger. The increasing noise made a background. It left Vance alone with the sheriff.  \"And how do you find your work, sheriff?\" asked Vance; for he knew that Uncle Joe Minter's great weakness was his love of talk. Everyone in the mountains knew it, for that matter.  \"Dull,\" complained Minter. \"Men ain't what they used to be, or else the law is a heap stronger.\"  \"The men who enforce the law are,\" said Vance.  The sheriff absorbed this patent compliment with the blank eye of satisfaction and rubbed his chin.  \"But they's been some talk of rustling, pretty recent. I'm waiting for it to grow and get ripe. Then I'll bust it.\"  He made an eloquent gesture which Vance followed. He was distinctly pleased with the sheriff. For Minter was wonderfully preserved. His face seemed five years younger than his age. His body seemed even younger-- round, smooth, powerful muscles padding his shoulders and stirring down the length of his big arms. And his hands had that peculiar light restlessness of touch which Vance remembered to have seen--in the hands of Terence Colby, alias Hollis!  \"And how's things up your way?\" continued the sheriff.  \"Booming. By the way, how long is it since you've seen the ranch?\"  \"Never been there. Bear Creek Valley has always been a quiet place since the Cornishes moved in; and they ain't been any call for a gent in my line of business up that way.\"  He grinned with satisfaction, and Vance nodded.  \"If times are dull, why not drop over? We're having a celebration there in five days. Come and look us over.\"  \"Maybe I might, and maybe I mightn't,\" said the sheriff. \"All depends.\"  \"And bring some friends with you,\" insisted Vance.  Then he wisely let the subject drop and went on to a detailed description of the game in the hills around the ranch. That, he knew, would bring the sheriff if anything would. But he mentioned the invitation no more. There were particular reasons why he must not press it on the sheriff any more than on others in Craterville.  The next morning, before traintime, Vance went to the post office and left the article on Black Jack addressed to Terence Colby at the Cornish ranch. The addressing was done on a typewriter, which completely removed any means of identifying the sender. Vance played with Providence in only one way. He was so eager to strike his blow at the last possible moment that he asked the postmaster to hold the letter for three days, which would land it at the ranch on the morning of the birthday. Then he went to the train.  His self-respect was increasing by leaps and bounds. The game was still not won, but, starring with absolutely nothing, in six days he had planted a charge which might send Elizabeth's twenty-four years of labor up in smoke.  He got off the train at Preston, the station nearest the ranch, and took a hired team up the road along Bear Creek Gorge. They debouched out of the Blue Mountains into the valley of the ranch in the early evening, and Vance found himself looking with new eyes on the little kingdom. He felt the happiness, indeed, of one who has lost a great prize and then put himself in a fair way of winning it back.  They dipped into the valley road. Over the tops of the big silver spruces he traced the outline of Sleep Mountain against the southern sky. Who but Vance, or the dwellers in the valley, would be able to duly appreciate such beauty? If there were any wrong in what he had done, this thought consoled him: the ends justified the means.  Now, as they drew closer, through the branches he made out glimpses of the dim, white front of the big house on the hill. That big, cool house with the kingdom spilled out at its feet, the farming lands, the pastures of the hills, and the rich forest of the upper mountains. Certainty came to Vance Cornish. He wanted the ranch so profoundly that the thought of losing it became impossible.    CHAPTER 6   But while he had been working at a distance, things had been going on apace at the ranch, a progress which had now gathered such impetus that he found himself incapable of checking it. The blow fell immediately after dinner that same evening. Terence excused himself early to retire to the mysteries of a new pump-gun. Elizabeth and Vance took their coffee into the library.  The night had turned cool, with a sharp wind driving the chill through every crack; so a few sticks were sending their flames crumbling against the big back log. The lamp glowing in the corner was the only other light, and when they drew their chairs close to the hearth, great tongues of shadows leaped and fell on the wall behind them. Vance looked at his sister with concern. There was a certain complacency about her this evening that told him in advance that she had formed a new plan with which she was well pleased. And he had come to dread her plans.  She always filled him with awe--and never more so than tonight, with her thin, homely face illuminated irregularly and by flashes. He kept watching her from the side, with glances.  \"I think I know why you've gone away for these few days,\" she said.  \"To get used to the new idea,\" he admitted with such frankness that she turned to him with unusual sympathy. \"It was rather a shock at first.\"  \"I know it was. And I wasn't diplomatic. There's too much man in me, Vance. Altogether too much, while you--\"  She closed her lips suddenly. But he knew perfectly the unspoken words. She was about to suggest that there was too little man in him. He dropped his chin in his hand, partly for comfort and partly to veil the sneer. If she could have followed what he had done in the past six days!  \"And you are used to the new idea?\"  \"You see that I'm back before the time was up and ahead of my promise,\" he said.  She nodded. \"Which paves the way for another new idea of mine.\"  He felt that a blow was coming and nerved himself against the shock of it. But the preparation was merely like tensing one's muscles against a fall. When the shock came, it stunned him.  \"Vance, I've decided to adopt Terence!\"  His fingertips sank into his cheek, bruising the flesh. What would become of his six days of work? What would become of his cunning and his forethought? All destroyed at a blow. For if she adopted the boy, the very law would keep her from denying him afterward. For a moment it seemed to him that some devil must have forewarned her of his plans.  \"You don't approve?\" she said at last, anxiously.  He threw himself back in the chair and laughed. All his despair went into that hollow, ringing sound.  \"Approve? It's a queer question to ask me. But let it go. I know I couldn't change you.\"  \"I know that you have a right to advise,\" she said gently. \"You are my father's son and you have a right to advise on the placing of his name.\"  He had to keep fighting against surging desires to throw his rage in her face. But he mastered himself, except for a tremor of his voice.  \"When are you going to do it?\"  \"Tomorrow.\"  \"Elizabeth, why not wait until after the birthday ceremony?\"  \"Because I've been haunted by peculiar fears, since our last talk, that something might happen before that time. I've actually lain awake at night and thought about it! And I want to forestall all chances. I want to rivet him to me!\"  He could see by her eagerness that her mind had been irrevocably made up, and that nothing could change her. She wanted agreement, not advice. And with consummate bitterness of soul he submitted to his fate.  \"I suppose you're right. Call him down now and I'll be present when you ask him to join the circle--the family circle of the Cornishes, you know.\"  He could not school all the bitterness out of his voice, but she seemed too glad of his bare acquiescence to object to such trifles. She sent Wu Chi to call Terence down to them. He had apparently been in his shirt sleeves working at the gun. He came with his hands still faintly glistening from their hasty washing, and with the coat which he had just bundled into still rather bunched around his big shoulders. He came and stood against the massive, rough-finished stones of the fireplace looking down at Elizabeth. There had always been a sort of silent understanding between him and Vance. They never exchanged more words and looks than were absolutely necessary. Vance realized it more than ever as he looked up to the tall athletic figure. And he realized also that since he had last looked closely at Terence the latter had slipped out of boyhood and into manhood. There was that indescribable something about the set of the chin and the straight-looking eyes that spelled the difference.  \"Terence,\" she said, \"for twenty-four years you have been my boy.\"  \"Yes, Aunt Elizabeth.\"  He acknowledged the gravity of this opening statement by straightening a little, his hand falling away from the stone against which he had been leaning. But Vance looked more closely at his sister. He could see the gleam of worship in her eyes.  \"And now I want you to be something more. I want you to be my boy in the eyes of the law, so that when anything happens to me, your place won't be threatened.\"  He was straighter than ever.  \"I want to adopt you, Terence!\"  Somehow, in those few moments they had been gradually building to a climax. It was prodigiously heightened now by the silence of the boy. The throat of Vance tightened with excitement.  \"I will be your mother, in the eyes of the law,\" she was explaining gently, as though it were a mystery which Terry could not understand. \"And Vance, here, will be your uncle. You understand, my dear?\"  What a world of brooding tenderness went"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9925"],["title","Black Jack (#6)"],["body","her voice! Vance wondered at it. But he wondered more at the stiff-standing form of Terence, and his silence; until he saw the tender smile vanish from the face of Elizabeth and alarm come into it. All at once Terence had dropped to one knee before her and taken her hands. And now it was he who was talking slowly, gently.  \"All my life you've given me things, Aunt Elizabeth. You've given me everything. Home, happiness, love--everything that could be given. So much that you could never be repaid, and all I can do is to love you, you see, and honor you as if you were my mother, in fact. But there's just one thing that can't be given. And that's a name!\"  He paused. Elizabeth was listening with a stricken face, and the heart of Vance thundered with his excitement. Vaguely he felt that there was something fine and clean and honorable in the heart of this youth which was being laid bare; but about that he cared very little. He was getting at facts and emotions which were valuable to him in the terms of dollars and cents.  \"It makes me choke up,\" said Terence, \"to have you offer me this great thing. It's a fine name, Cornish. But you know that I can't do it. It would be cowardly--a sort of rotten treason for me to change. It would be wrong. I know it would be wrong. I'm a Colby, Aunt Elizabeth. Every time that name is spoken, I feel it tingling down to my fingertips. I want to stand straighter, live cleaner. When I looked at the old Colby place in Virginia last year, it brought the tears to my eyes. I felt as if I were a product of that soil. Every fine thing that has ever been done by a Colby is a strength to me. I've studied them. And every now and then when I come to some brave thing they've done, I wonder if I could do it. And then I say to myself that I _must_ be able to do just such things or else be a shame to my blood.  \"Change my name? Why, I've gone all my life thanking God that I come of a race of gentlemen, clean-handed, and praying God to make me worthy of it. That name is like a whip over me. It drives me on and makes me want to do some fine big thing one of these days. Think of it! I'm the last of a race. I'm the end of it. The last of the Colbys! Why, when you think of it, you see how I can't possibly change, don't you? If I lost that, I'd lose the best half of myself and my self-respect! You understand, don't you? Not that I slight the name of Cornish for an instant. But even if names can be changed, blood can't be changed!\"  She turned her head. She met the gleaming eyes of Vance, and then let her glance probe the fire and shadow of the hearth.  \"It's all right, my dear,\" she said faintly. \"Stand up.\"  \"I've hurt you,\" he said contritely, leaning over her. \"I feel--like a dog. Have I hurt you?\"  \"Not the least in the world. I only offered it for your happiness, Terry. And if you don't need it, there's no more to be said!\"  He bent and kissed her forehead.  The moment he had disappeared through the tall doorway, Vance, past control, exploded.  \"Of all the damnable exhibitions of pride in a young upstart, this--\"  \"Hush, hush!\" said Elizabeth faintly. \"It's the finest thing I've ever heard Terry say. But it frightens me, Vance. It frightens me to know that I've formed the character and the pride and the self-respect of that boy on--a lie! Pray God that he never learns the truth!\"    CHAPTER 7   There were not many guests. Elizabeth had chosen them carefully from families which had known her father, Henry Cornish, when, in his reckless, adventurous way, he had been laying the basis of the Cornish fortune in the Rockies. Indeed, she was a little angry when she heard of the indiscriminate way in which Vance had scattered the invitations, particularly in Craterville.  But, as he said, he had acted so as to show her that he had entered fully into the spirit of the thing, and that his heart was in the right place as far as this birthday party was concerned, and she could not do otherwise than accept his explanation.  Some of the bidden guests, however, came from a great distance, and as a matter of course a few of them arrived the day before the celebration and filled the quiet rooms of the old house with noise. Elizabeth accepted them with resignation, and even pleasure, because they all had pleasant things to say about her father and good wishes to express for the destined heir, Terence Colby. It was carefully explained that this selection of an heir had been made by both Elizabeth and Vance, which removed all cause for remark. Vance himself regarded the guests with distinct amusement. But Terence was disgusted.  \"What these true Westerners need,\" he said to Elizabeth later in the day, \"is a touch of blood. No feeling of family or the dignity of family precedents out here.\"  It touched her shrewdly. More than once she had felt that Terry was on the verge of becoming a complacent prig. So she countered with a sharp thrust.  \"You have to remember that you're a Westerner born and bred, my dear. A very Westerner yourself!\"  \"Birth is an accident--birthplaces, I mean,\" smiled Terence. \"It's the blood that tells.\"  \"Terry, you're a snob!\" exclaimed Aunt Elizabeth.  \"I hope not,\" he answered. \"But look yonder, now!\"  Old George Armstrong's daughter, Nelly, had gone up a tree like a squirrel and was laughing down through the branches at a raw-boned cousin on the ground beneath her.  \"And what of it?\" said Elizabeth. \"That girl is pretty enough to please any man; and she's the type that makes a wife.\"  Terry rubbed his chin with his knuckles thoughtfully. It was the one family habit that he had contracted from Vance, much to the irritation of the latter.  \"After all,\" said Terry, with complacency, \"what are good looks with bad grammar?\"  Elizabeth snorted literally and most unfemininely.  \"Terence,\" she said, lessoning him with her bony, long forefinger, \"you're just young enough to be wise about women. When you're a little older, you'll get sense. If you want white hands and good grammar, how do you expect to find a wife in the mountains?\"  Terry answered with unshaken, lordly calm. \"I haven't thought about the details. They don't matter. But a man must have standards of criticism.\"  \"Standards your foot!\" cried Aunt Elizabeth. \"You insufferable young prig. That very girl laughing down through the branches--I'll wager she could set your head spinning in ten seconds if she thought it worth her while to try.\"  \"Perhaps,\" smiled Terence. \"In the meantime she has freckles and a vocabulary without growing pains.\"  \"All men are fools,\" declared Aunt Elizabeth; \"but boys are idiots, bless 'em! Terence, before you grow up you'll have sore toes from stumbling, take my word for it! Do you know what a wise man would do?\"  \"Well?\"  \"Go out and start a terrific flirtation with Nelly.\"  \"For the sake of experience?\" sighed Terence.  \"Good heavens!\" groaned Aunt Elizabeth. \"Terry, you're impossible! Where are you going now?\"  \"Out to see El Sangre.\"  He went whistling out of the door, and she followed him with confused feelings of anger, pride, joy, and fear. She went to a side window and saw him go fearlessly into the corral where the man-destroying El Sangre was kept. And the big stallion, red fire in the sunshine, went straight to him and nosed at a hip pocket. They had already struck up a perfect understanding. Deeply she wondered at it.  She had never loved the mountains and their people and their ways. It had been a battle to fight. She had fought the battle, won, and gained a hollow victory. And watching Terry caress the great, beautiful horse, she knew vaguely that his heart, at least, was in tune with the wilderness.  \"I wish to heaven, Terry,\" she murmured, \"that you could find a master as El Sangre has done. You need teaching.\"  When she turned from the window, she found Vance watching her. He had a habit of obscurely melting into a background and looking out at her unexpectedly. All at once she knew that he had been there listening during all of her talk with Terence. Not that the talk had been of a peculiarly private nature, but it angered her. There was just a semblance of eavesdropping about the presence of Vance. For she knew that Terence unbosomed himself to her as he would do in the hearing of no other human being. However, she mastered her anger and smiled at her brother. He had taken all these recent changes which were so much to his disadvantage with a good spirit that astonished and touched her.  \"Do you know what I'm going to give Terry for his birthday?\" he said, sauntering toward her.  \"Well?\" A mention of Terence and his welfare always disarmed her completely. She opened her eyes and her heart and smiled at her brother.  \"There's no set of Scott in the house. I'm going to give Terry one.\"  \"Do you think he'll ever read the novels? I never could. That antiquated style, Vance, keeps me at arm's length.\"  \"A stiff style because he wrote so rapidly. But there's the greatest body and bone of character. Except for his heroes. Terry reminds me of them, in a way. No thought, not very much feeling, but a great capacity for physical action.\"  \"I think you'd like to be Terry's adviser,\" she said.  \"I wouldn't aspire to the job,\" yawned Vance, \"unless I could ride well and shoot well. If a man can't do that, he ceases to be a man in Terry's eyes. And if a woman can't talk pure English, she isn't a woman.\"  \"That's because he's young,\" said Elizabeth.  \"It's because he's a prig,\" sneered Vance. He had been drawn farther into the conversation than he planned; now he retreated carefully. \"But another year or so may help him.\"  He retreated before she could answer, but he left her thoughtful, as he hoped to do. He had a standing theory that the only way to make a woman meditate is to keep her from talking. And he wanted very much to make Elizabeth meditate the evil in the son of Black Jack. Otherwise all his plans might be useless and his seeds of destruction fall on barren soil. He was intensely afraid of that,"]]]
