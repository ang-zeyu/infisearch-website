(65) I have already alluded to the way in which things are referred to God, and said to be of God.  (66) (1.) As belonging to His nature, and being, as it were, part of Him;           e.g. the power of God, the eyes of God.  (67) (2.) As under His dominion, and depending on His pleasure; thus the           heavens are called the heavens of the Lord, as being His chariot           and habitation. So Nebuchadnezzar is called the servant of God,           Assyria the scourge of God, &c.  (68) (3.) As dedicated to Him, e.g. the Temple of God, a Nazarene of God,           the Bread of God.  (69) (4.) As revealed through the prophets and not through our natural           faculties. In this sense the Mosaic law is called the law of God.  (70) (5.) As being in the superlative degree. Very high mountains are styled           the mountains of God, a very deep sleep, the sleep of God, &c. In           this sense we must explain Amos iv:11: \"I have overthrown you as           the overthrow of the Lord came upon Sodom and Gomorrah,\" i.e. that           memorable overthrow, for since God Himself is the Speaker, the           passage cannot well be taken otherwise. The wisdom of Solomon is           called the wisdom of God, or extraordinary. The size of the cedars           of Lebanon is alluded to in the Psalmist's expression, \"the cedars           of the Lord.\"  (71) Similarly, if the Jews were at a loss to understand any phenomenon, or were ignorant of its cause, they referred it to God. (72) Thus a storm was termed the chiding of God, thunder and lightning the arrows of God, for it was thought that God kept the winds confined in caves, His treasuries; thus differing merely in name from the Greek wind-god Eolus. (73) In like manner miracles were called works of God, as being especially marvellous; though in reality, of course, all natural events are the works of God, and take place solely by His power. (74) The Psalmist calls the miracles in Egypt the works of God, because the Hebrews found in them a way of safety which they had not looked for, and therefore especially marvelled at.  (75) As, then, unusual natural phenomena are called works of God, and trees of unusual size are called trees of God, we cannot wonder that very strong and tall men, though impious robbers and whoremongers, are in Genesis called sons of God.  (76) This reference of things wonderful to God was not peculiar to the Jews.  (77) Pharaoh, on hearing the interpretation of his dream, exclaimed that the mind of the gods was in Joseph. (78) Nebuchadnezzar told Daniel that he possessed the mind of the holy gods; so also in Latin anything well made is often said to be wrought with Divine hands, which is equivalent to the Hebrew phrase, wrought with the hand of God.  (80) We can now very easily understand and explain those passages of Scripture which speak of the Spirit of God. (81) In some places the expression merely means a very strong, dry, and deadly wind, as in Isaiah xl:7, \"The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it.\" (82) Similarly in Gen. i:2: \"The Spirit of the Lord moved over the face of the waters.\" (83) At other times it is used as equivalent to a high courage, thus the spirit of Gideon and of Samson is called the Spirit of the Lord, as being very bold, and prepared for any emergency. (84) Any unusual virtue or power is called the Spirit or Virtue of the Lord, Ex. xxxi:3: \"I will fill him (Bezaleel) with the Spirit of the Lord,\" i.e., as the Bible itself explains, with talent above man's usual endowment. (85) So Isa. xi:2: \"And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him,\" is explained afterwards in the text to mean the spirit of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and might.  (86) The melancholy of Saul is called the melancholy of the Lord, or a very deep melancholy, the persons who applied the term showing that they understood by it nothing supernatural, in that they sent for a musician to assuage it by harp-playing. (87) Again, the \"Spirit of the Lord\" is used as equivalent to the mind of man, for instance, Job xxvii:3: \"And the Spirit of the Lord in my nostrils,\" the allusion being to Gen. ii:7: \"And God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life.\" (88) Ezekiel also, prophesying to the dead, says (xxvii:14), \"And I will give to you My Spirit, and ye shall live;\" i.e. I will restore you to life. (89) In Job xxxiv:14, we read: \"If He gather unto Himself His Spirit and breath;\" in Gen. vi:3: \"My Spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh,\" i.e. since man acts on the dictates of his body, and not the spirit which I gave him to discern the good, I will let him alone. (90) So, too, Ps. li:12: \"Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me; cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.\" (91) It was supposed that sin originated only from the body, and that good impulses come from the mind; therefore the Psalmist invokes the aid of God against the bodily appetites, but prays that the spirit which the Lord, the Holy One, had given him might be renewed. (92) Again, inasmuch as the Bible, in concession to popular ignorance, describes God as having a mind, a heart, emotions - nay, even a body and breath - the expression Spirit of the Lord is used for God's mind, disposition, emotion, strength, or breath. (93) Thus, Isa. xl:13: \"Who hath disposed the Spirit of the Lord?\" i.e. who, save Himself, hath caused the mind of the Lord to will anything,? and Isa. lxiii:10: \"But they rebelled, and vexed the Holy Spirit.\"  (94) The phrase comes to be used of the law of Moses, which in a sense expounds God's will, Is. lxiii. 11, \"Where is He that put His Holy Spirit within him?\" meaning, as we clearly gather from the context, the law of Moses. (95) Nehemiah, speaking of the giving of the law, says, i:20, \"Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them.\" (96) This is referred to in Deut. iv:6, \"This is your wisdom and understanding,\" and in Ps. cxliii:10, \"Thy good Spirit will lead me into the land of uprightness.\" (97) The Spirit of the Lord may mean the breath of the Lord, for breath, no less than a mind, a heart, and a body are attributed to God in Scripture, as in Ps. xxxiii:6. (98) Hence it gets to mean the power, strength, or faculty of God, as in Job xxxiii:4, \"The Spirit of the Lord made me,\" i.e. the power, or, if you prefer, the decree of the Lord. (99) So the Psalmist in poetic language declares, xxxiii:6, \"By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth,\" i.e. by a mandate issued, as it were, in one breath. (100) Also Ps. cxxxix:7, \"Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit, or whither shall I flee from Thy presence?\" i.e. whither shall I go so as to be beyond Thy power and Thy presence?  (101) Lastly, the Spirit of the Lord is used in Scripture to express the emotions of God, e.g. His kindness and mercy, Micah ii:7, \"Is the Spirit [i.e. the mercy] of the Lord straitened? (102) Are these cruelties His doings?\" (103) Zech. iv:6, \"Not by might or by power, but My Spirit [i.e. mercy], saith the Lord of hosts.\" (104) The twelfth verse of the seventh chapter of the same prophet must, I think, be interpreted in like manner: \"Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the Lord of hosts hath sent in His Spirit [i.e. in His mercy] by the former prophets.\" (105) So also Haggai ii:5: \"So My Spirit remaineth among you: fear not.\"  (106) The passage in Isaiah xlviii:16, \"And now the Lord and His Spirit hath sent me,\" may be taken to refer to God's mercy or His revealed law; for the prophet says, \"From the beginning\" (i.e. from the time when I first came to you, to preach God's anger and His sentence forth against you) \"I spoke not in secret; from the time that it was, there am I,\" and now I am sent by the mercy of God as a joyful messenger to preach your restoration. (107) Or we may understand him to mean by the revealed law that he had before come to warn them by the command of the law (Levit. xix:17) in the same manner under the same conditions as Moses had warned them, that now, like Moses, he ends by preaching their restoration. (108) But the first explanation seems to me the best.  (109) Returning, then, to the main object of our discussion, we find that the Scriptural phrases, \"The Spirit of the Lord was upon a prophet,\" \"The Lord breathed His Spirit into men,\" \"Men were filled with the Spirit of God, with the Holy Spirit,\" &c., are quite clear to us, and mean that prophets were endowed with a peculiar and extraordinary power, and devoted themselves to piety with especial constancy(3); that thus they perceived the mind or the thought of God, for we have shown that God's Spirit signifies in Hebrew God's mind or thought, and that the law which shows His mind and thought is called His Spirit; hence that the imagination of the prophets, inasmuch as through it were revealed the decrees of God, may equally be called the mind of God, and the prophets be said to have possessed the mind of God. (110) On our minds also the mind of God and His eternal thoughts are impressed; but this being the same for all men is less taken into account, especially by the Hebrews, who claimed a pre-eminence, and despised other men and other men's knowledge.  (111) Lastly, the prophets were said to possess the Spirit of God because men knew not the cause of prophetic knowledge, and in their wonder referred it with other marvels directly to the Deity, styling it Divine knowledge.  (112) We need no longer scruple to affirm that the prophets only perceived God's revelation by the aid of imagination, that is, by words and figures either real or imaginary. (113) We find no other means mentioned in Scripture, and therefore must not invent any. (114) As to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/989"],["title","Theologico-Political Treatise — Part 1 (#5)"],["body","law of Nature by which the communications took place, I confess my ignorance. (115) I might, indeed, say as others do, that they took place by the power of God; but this would be mere trifling, and no better than explaining some unique specimen by a transcendental term. (116) Everything takes place by the power of God. (117) Nature herself is the power of God under another name, and our ignorance of the power of God is co-extensive with our ignorance of Nature. (118) It is absolute folly, therefore, to ascribe an event to the power of God when we know not its natural cause, which is the power of God.  (119) However, we are not now inquiring into the causes of prophetic knowledge. (120) We are only attempting, as I have said, to examine the Scriptural documents, and to draw our conclusions from them as from ultimate natural facts; the causes of the documents do not concern us.  (121) As the prophets perceived the revelations of God by the aid of imagination, they could indisputably perceive much that is beyond the boundary of the intellect, for many more ideas can be constructed from words and figures than from the principles and notions on which the whole fabric of reasoned knowledge is reared.  (122) Thus we have a clue to the fact that the prophets perceived nearly everything in parables and allegories, and clothed spiritual truths in bodily forms, for such is the usual method of imagination. (122) We need no longer wonder that Scripture and the prophets speak so strangely and obscurely of God's Spirit or Mind (cf. Numbers xi:17, 1 Kings xxii:21, &c.), that the Lord was seen by Micah as sitting, by Daniel as an old man clothed in white, by Ezekiel as a fire, that the Holy Spirit appeared to those with Christ as a descending dove, to the apostles as fiery tongues, to Paul on his conversion as a great light. (124) All these expressions are plainly in harmony with the current ideas of God and spirits.  (125) Inasmuch as imagination is fleeting and inconstant, we find that the power of prophecy did not remain with a prophet for long, nor manifest itself frequently, but was very rare; manifesting itself only in a few men, and in them not often.  (126) We must necessarily inquire how the prophets became assured of the truth of what they perceived by imagination, and not by sure mental laws; but our investigation must be confined to Scripture, for the subject is one on which we cannot acquire certain knowledge, and which we cannot explain by the immediate causes. (127) Scripture teaching about the assurance of prophets I will treat of in the next chapter.     CHAPTER II. - OF PROPHETS.  (1) It follows from the last chapter that, as I have said, the prophets were endowed with unusually vivid imaginations, and not with unusually perfect minds. (2) This conclusion is amply sustained by Scripture, for we are told that Solomon was the wisest of men, but had no special faculty of prophecy. (3) Heman, Calcol, and Dara, though men of great talent, were not prophets, whereas uneducated countrymen, nay, even women, such as Hagar, Abraham's handmaid, were thus gifted. (4) Nor is this contrary to ordinary experience and reason. (5) Men of great imaginative power are less fitted for abstract reasoning, whereas those who excel in intellect and its use keep their imagination more restrained and controlled, holding it in subjection, so to speak, lest it should usurp the place of reason.  (6) Thus to suppose that knowledge of natural and spiritual phenomena can be gained from the prophetic books, is an utter mistake, which I shall endeavour to expose, as I think philosophy, the age, and the question itself demand. (7) I care not for the girdings of superstition, for superstition is the bitter enemy, of all true knowledge and true morality. (8) Yes; it has come to this! (9) Men who openly confess that they can form no idea of God, and only know Him through created things, of which they know not the causes, can unblushingly accuse philosophers of Atheism.  (10) Treating the question methodically, I will show that prophecies varied, not only according to the imagination and physical temperament of the prophet, but also according to his particular opinions; and further that prophecy never rendered the prophet wiser than he was before. (11) But I will first discuss the assurance of truth which the prophets received, for this is akin to the subject-matter of the chapter, and will serve to elucidate somewhat our present point.  (12) Imagination does not, in its own nature, involve any certainty of truth, such as is implied in every clear and distinct idea, but requires some extrinsic reason to assure us of its objective reality: hence prophecy cannot afford certainty, and the prophets were assured of God's revelation by some sign, and not by the fact of revelation, as we may see from Abraham, who, when he had heard the promise of God, demanded a sign, not because he did not believe in God, but because he wished to be sure that it was God Who made the promise. (13) The fact is still more evident in the case of Gideon: \"Show me,\" he says to God, \"show me a sign, that I may know that it is Thou that talkest with me.\" (14) God also says to Moses: \"And let this be a sign that I have sent thee.\" (15) Hezekiah, though he had long known Isaiah to be a prophet, none the less demanded a sign of the cure which he predicted. (15) It is thus quite evident that the prophets always received some sign to certify them of their prophetic imaginings; and for this reason Moses bids the Jews (Deut. xviii.) ask of the prophets a sign, namely, the prediction of some coming event. (16) In this respect, prophetic knowledge is inferior to natural knowledge, which needs no sign, and in itself implies certitude. (17) Moreover, Scripture warrants the statement that the certitude of the prophets was not mathematical, but moral. (18) Moses lays down the punishment of death for the prophet who preaches new gods, even though he confirm his doctrine by signs and wonders (Deut. xiii.); \"For,\" he says, \"the Lord also worketh signs and wonders to try His people.\" (19) And Jesus Christ warns His disciples of the same thing (Matt. xxiv:24). (20) Furthermore, Ezekiel (xiv:9) plainly states that God sometimes deceives men with false revelations; and Micaiah bears like witness in the case of the prophets of Ahab.  (21) Although these instances go to prove that revelation is open to doubt, it nevertheless contains, as we have said, a considerable element of certainty, for God never deceives the good, nor His chosen, but (according to the ancient proverb, and as appears in the history of Abigail and her speech), God uses the good as instruments of goodness, and the wicked as means to execute His wrath. (22) This may be seen from the case of Micaiah above quoted; for although God had determined to deceive Ahab, through prophets, He made use of lying prophets; to the good prophet He revealed the truth, and did not forbid his proclaiming it.  (23) Still the certitude of prophecy, remains, as I have said, merely, moral; for no one can justify himself before God, nor boast that he is an instrument for God's goodness. (24) Scripture itself teaches and shows that God led away David to number the people, though it bears ample witness to David's piety.  (25) The whole question of the certitude of prophecy, was based on these three considerations:     1. That the things revealed were imagined very vividly, affecting the       prophets in the same way as things seen when awake;     2. The presence of a sign;     3. Lastly, and chiefly, that the mind of the prophet was given wholly,       to what was right and  good.  (26) Although Scripture does not always make mention of a sign, we must nevertheless suppose that a sign was always vouchsafed; for Scripture does not always relate every condition and circumstance (as many have remarked), but rather takes them for granted. (27) We may, however, admit that no sign was needed when the prophecy declared nothing that was not already contained in the law of Moses, because it was confirmed by that law. (28) For instance, Jeremiah's prophecy, of the destruction of Jerusalem was confirmed by the prophecies of other prophets, and by the threats in the law, and, therefore, it needed no sign; whereas Hananiah, who, contrary to all the prophets, foretold the speedy restoration of the state, stood in need of a sign, or he would have been in doubt as to the truth of his prophecy, until it was confirmed by facts. (29) \"The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known that the Lord hath truly sent him.\"  (30) As, then, the certitude afforded to the prophet by signs was not mathematical (i.e. did not necessarily follow from the perception of the thing perceived or seen), but only moral, and as the signs were only given to convince the prophet, it follows that such signs were given according to the opinions and capacity of each prophet, so that a sign which convince one prophet would fall far short of convincing another who was imbued with different opinions. (31) Therefore the signs varied according to the individual prophet.  (32) So also did the revelation vary, as we have stated, according to individual disposition and temperament, and according to the opinions previously held.  (33) It varied according to disposition, in this way: if a prophet was cheerful, victories, peace, and events which make men glad, were revealed to him; in that he was naturally more likely to imagine such things. (34) If, on the contrary, he was melancholy, wars, massacres, and calamities were revealed; and so, according as a prophet was merciful, gentle, quick to anger, or severe, he was more fitted for one kind of revelation than another. (35) It varied according to the temper of imagination in this way: if a prophet was cultivated he perceived the mind of God in a cultivated way, if he was confused"]]]
