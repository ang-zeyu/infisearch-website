To me the wits were disastrously kind. Never had I been made a tenth so much of; I was even urged to sing \"All quiet along the Potomac to-night,\" and was courteously praised when I had done so. But there is where affliction overtook me; they debated its authorship. One said a certain newspaper correspondent, naming him, had proved it to be the work--I forget of whom. But I shall never forget what followed. Two or three challenged the literary preeminence of that correspondent, and from as many directions I was asked for my opinion. Ah me! Lying back against a pile of saddles with my head in my hands, sodden with self-assurance, I replied, magnanimously, \"Oh, I don't set up for a critic, but--well--would you call him a better man than Charlie Toliver?\"  \"Who--o?\" It was not one who asked; the whos came like shrapnel; and when, not knowing what else to do, I smiled as one dying, there went up a wail of mirth that froze my blood and then heated it to a fever. The company howled. They rolled over one another, crying, \"Charlie Toliver!--Charlie Toliver!--Oh, Lord, where's Scott Gholson!--Charlie Toliver!\"--and leaped up and huddled down and moaned and rolled and rose and looked for me.  But, after all, fortune was merciful, and I was gone; the Major had summoned me--his brother had come. I went circuitously and alone. As I started, some fellow writhing on the grass cried, \"Charlie Tol--oh, this is better than a tcharade!\" and a flash of divination enlightened me. While I went I burned with shame, rage and nervous exhaustion; the name Scott Gholson had gasped in my ear was the name of her in the curtained wagon, and I cursed the day in which I had heard of Charlotte Oliver.    IV   THREE DAYS' RATIONS  In the vocabulary of a prig, but in the wrath of a fishwoman, I execrated Scott Gholson; his jealousies, his disclosures, his religion, his mispronunciations; and Ned Ferry--that cockerel! Here was I in the barrel, and able only to squeal in irate terror at whoever looked down upon me. I could have crawled under a log and died. At the door of the Major's tent I paused to learn and joy of one to whom comes reprieve when the rope is on his neck, I overheard Harry Helm, the General's nephew and aide de-camp, who had been with us, telling what a howling good joke Smith had just got off on Gholson!  \"We shall have to get Ned Ferry back here,\" the Major was saying as I entered, \"to make you boys let Scott Gholson alone.\"  The young man laughed and turned to go. \"Why doesn't Ned Ferry make _her_ let Gholson alone? He can do it; he's got her round his finger as tight as she's got Gholson round hers.\"  \"Harry,\" replied the Major, from his table full of documents, \"don't you know that any man who's got a woman wrapped round his finger has also got her wrapped round his throat?\"  The aide-de-camp laughed like a rustic and vanished. \"Smith,\" said the Major, \"your eyes are--\"  \"I've been awake for forty-eight hours, Major. But--oh, I'm not sleepy.\"  \"Well, go get some sleep.--No, go at once; you'll be called when needed.\"  But I was not needed; while I slept, who should come back and do my work in my stead but Ned Ferry. When I awoke it was with a bound of alarm to see clear day. The command was breaking camp. I rushed out of the tent with canteen, soap and comb, and ran into the arms of the mess-cook. We were alone. \"Oh, yass, seh,\" he laughed as he poured the water into my hands, \"th'ee days' rairtion. Seh? Lawd! dey done drawed and cook' befo' de fus' streak o' light. But you all right; here yo' habbersack, full up. Oh, I done fed yo' hoss. Here yo' jacket an' cap; and here yo' saddle an' bridle--Oh, you welcome; I dess tryin' to git shet of 'em so's I kin strak de tent.\"  As I mounted, our wagonmaster rode by me, busy as a skipper in a storm. \"Oh, here!\" he cried, wheeled, and reaching something to me added, \"that's your pass. Major Harper wants you as quick as you can show up. He says never mind the column, ride straight after him. Keep this road to Hazlehurst and then go down the main Brookhaven road till you overtake him. He's by himself--nearly.\"  As the rider wheeled away I blurted out with anxious loudness in the general hubbub, \"Isn't his brother with him?\"  He flashed back a glare of rebuke and then bellowed to heaven and earth, \"Oh, the devil and Tom Walker! I don't keep run of sutlers and citizens!\" He took a circuit, standing in his stirrups and calling orders to his teamsters, and as he neared me again he said very gently, \"Good Lord! my boy, don't you know better than to shoot your mouth off like that? You'll find nobody with the Major but Ned Ferry, and I don't say you'll find him.\"  I galloped to the road. Away down through the woods it was full of horsemen falling into line. With the nearest colonel was Lieutenant Helm, the aide-de-camp. I turned away from them toward Hazlehurst, but looked back distrustfully. Yes, sure enough, the whole command was facing into column the other way! My horse and I whirled and stood staring and swelling with indignation--we ordered south, and the brigade heading westward! He fretted, tramped, neighed, and began hurriedly to paw through the globe to head them off on the other side. He even threatened to rear; but when I showed him I was ashamed of that, he bore me proudly, and I sat him as proudly as he bore me, for he made me more than half my friends. And now as the aide-de-camp wheeled about from the receding column and came our way saluting cordially, we turned and trotted beside him jauntily. Our first talk was of saddles, but very soon I asked where the General was.  \"Out on the Natchez Trace waiting for the command. I'm carrying orders to Fisher's battery, down here by the cross-roads. Haven't you seen the General this morning? What! haven't seen him in his new uniform? Whoop! he's a blaze of glory! Look here, Smith, I believe you know who brought it to him!\"  \"How on earth should I know?\"  \"Oh, how innocent you always are! Look here! just tell me this; was it the Major's brother brought it, or was it Ned Ferry?\"  \"Suppose it wasn't either.\"  \"I knew it! I knew it was her! Ah, you rogue, you know it was her!\"  \"Well, that _might_ depend on who 'her' is.\" We had reached the cross-roads and he was turning south.  \"Look!\" he said, and gave the glance and smile of the lady in the curtained wagon so perfectly that I cackled like a small boy. \"Oh, you know that, do you? I dare you to say she didn't bring it!\"  \"I give you my word I don't know!\" called I as the distance grew between us. \"And I give you my word I don't care!\" he crowed back as we galloped apart. His speech was two or three words longer, but they are inappropriate at the end of a chapter, and I expurgate.    V   EIGHTEEN, NINETEEN, TWENTY  On entering Hazlehurst I observed all about the railway-station a surprising amount of quartermaster's stores. A large part were cases of boots and shoes. Laden with such goods, a train of shabby box-cars stood facing south, its beggarly wood-burner engine sniffing and weeping, while the cork-legged conductor helped all hands wood up. Though homely, the picture was a stirring one. Up through the blue summer morning came the sun, bringing to mind the words of the dying Mirabeau, \"If that is not God, at least it's his first cousin.\"  Even in the character of the goods there was eloquence, and not a drollery in the scene, not even an ugliness, but was touched, was rife, with the woe of a war whose burning walls were falling in on us. And outward, too, upon others; a few up-ended cottonbales leaned against each other ragged and idle, while women and babes starved for want of them in far-away Lancaster.  One of the cars furthest from the engine had no freight proper, only a number of trunks; and these were nearly hidden by the widely crinolined flounces of an elegant elderly lady who sat on the middle one. And now she, too, was hidden, and the wide doorway in the side of the car more than filled, by the fashionable gowns of three girls. On the ground below there stood a lieutenant in a homemade gray uniform, and at his back half a dozen big, slouching, barefoot boys squirted tobacco juice and gazed at the ladies. The officer scanned me, spoke to the ladies, scanned me again, and threw up an arm. \"Ho--o! Come here! Hullo! Come here--if you please.\"  If he had not said please he should have ho'd and hullo'd in vain, but at that word I turned. Before I had covered half the distance I read New Orleans! my dear, dear old New Orleans! in every line of those ladies' draperies, and at twenty-five yards I saw one noble family likeness in all four of their sweet faces. Oh, but those three maidens were fair! and I could name each by her name at a glance: Camille, Cécile, Estelle; eighteen, nineteen, twenty!  There was a hush of attention among them as the lieutenant and I saluted. His left hand was gone at the wrist and the sleeve pinned back on itself. He asked my name; I told him. In the car there was a stir of deepening interest. I inquired if he was the post-quartermaster here. He was.  \"Ain't you Major Harper's quartermaster-sergeant?\" he asked.  \"I am his clerk.\" In the car a flash of joy and then great decorum.  As he handed me a writing he glowed kindly. It proved to be from Major Harper; a requisition upon this officer for shoes and clothing; not for a brigade, regiment or company, but for me alone, from hat to shoes. I tendered it back silently, and saw that he knew its purport already from the Major, and that the ladies knew it from him. The good fellow looked quite happy a moment, but then reddened as they joyfully crowded the car's doorway to see me fitted!  \"We can select out sev'l pair--\" he began, but heard a puerile titter and lost his nerve. \"Now, you boys that ain't got any business here, jest clair out!--Go! I tell you, aw I'll--\" The boys loitered off toward the engine. \"We can select out sev'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9839"],["title","The Cavalier (#3)"],["body","si-izes,\" he drawled, uncovering a box, \"and fit you ove' in my office. You ain't so pow'ful long nor so pow'ful slim, but these-yeh gov'ment contrac's they seldom ev' allow fo' anybody so slim in the waist bein' so long in the, eh,--so, eh,--so long f'om thah down. But yet still, if you'll jest light off yo' hoss and come and look into this-yeh box--\"  Hmm! yes! I wouldn't have got off my horse and leaned over that box to save the Confederacy. \"I thank you, Lieutenant, but I can't stop. If you'll hand me up a jacket and pair of shoes I'll sign for them and go. I don't want a hat, but I reckon I'd as well include shoes, although really,--\" I glanced down brazenly at the stirrup-leathers that so snugly hid my naked toes.  As the quartermaster lifted out a pair of brogans as broad as they were long, there came a cry of protestation from the freight-car group, that brought the entire herd of rustics from the woodpile and the locomotive. Miss Harper rose behind her nieces, tall, slender, dark, with keen black eyes as kind as they were penetrating. \"My boy!\" she cried, \"you cannot wear those things!\"  Camille, the youngest, whispered to her, whereupon she beckoned. \"Oh!--oh, do come here!--Mr. Smith, I am the sister of Major Harper. You're from New Orleans? Does your mother live in Apollo Street?\"  \"Yes, madam, between Melpomene and Terpsichore.\"  \"Richard Thorndyke Smith! My dear boy,\" she cried, while the nieces gasped at each other with gestures and looks all the way between Terpsichore and Melpomene, and then the four cried in chorus, \"We know your mother!\"  \"We've got a letter for you from her!\" exclaimed Camille.  \"And a suit of unie-fawm!\" called Cécile, with her Creole accent.  \"We smuggled it through!\" chanted the trio, ready to weep for virtuous joy. And then they clasped arms like the graces, about their aunt, and let her speak.  \"We all helped your mother make your uniform,\" she said. \"In the short time we've known her we've learned to love her dearly.\" With military brevity she told how they had unexpectedly got a pass and were just out of New Orleans--\"poor New Orleans!\" put in Estelle, the eldest, the pensive one; that they had come up from Pontchatoula yesterday and last night, and had thrown themselves on beds in the \"hotel\" yonder without venturing to disrobe, and so had let her brother pass within a few steps of them while they slept! \"Telegraph? My dear boy, we came but ten miles an hour, but we outran our despatch!\" Now they had telegraphed again, to Brookhaven, and thanks to the post-quartermaster, were going down there at once on this train. While this was being told something else was going on. The youngest niece, Camille, had put herself entirely out of sight. Now she reappeared with very rosy cheeks, saying, \"Here's the letter.\"  My thanks were few and awkward, for there still hung to the missive a basting thread, and it was as warm as a nestling bird. I bent low--everybody was emotional in those days--kissed the fragrant thing, thrust it into my bosom, and blushed worse than Camille.  \"Poor boy!\" said the aunt. \"It's the first line you've had for months. Your sweet mother wrote, but her letters were all intercepted, and the last time she was warned that next time she'd be dealt with according to military usage! I'm glad we could give you this one at once. We can't give you the uniform, for we--why, girls, what--why, what nonsense!\"  Maybe I did not say vindictive things inside me just then! The three nieces had turned open-mouthed upon one another and sunk down upon their luggage with averted faces.  \"I say we can't give it to you now,\" Miss Harper persisted, with a motherly smile; \"we're wearing it ourselves. We've had no time to take it off. I couldn't get the boots off me last night. And even if you had the boots, the other things--\"  \"Aunt Martha!\" moaned some one. \"Well, in short,\" said the aunt, twinkling like her brother, \"we can't deliver the goods, and--\" She started as though some one had slapped her between the shoulder-blades. It was the engine caused it, whistling in the old, lawless way, putting a whoop, a howl, a scream and a wail into one. The young ladies quailed, the train jerked like several collisions, the bell began tardily to clang, and my steed whirled, cleared a packing case, whirled again, and stood facing the train, his eyes blazing, his nostrils flapping, not half so much frightened as insulted. The post-quartermaster waved to the ladies and they to us. For a last touch I lifted my cap high and backed my horse on drooping haunches--you've seen Buffalo Bill do it--and then, with a leap like a cricket's, and to a clapping of maidens' hands that made me whooping drunk, we stretched away, my horse and I, on a long smooth gallop, for Brookhaven.    VI   A HANDSOME STRANGER  Certainly no cricket ever dropped blither music from his legs than did my beautiful horse that glorious morning as we clattered in perfect rhythm on the hard clean road of the wide pine forest. Ah! the forest is not there now; the lumbermen--  For an hour or so the world seemed to have taken me for its center as smoothly as a sleeping top. Only after a good seven miles did my meditations begin to reveal any bitter in the sweet; but it was in recalling for the twentieth time the last sight of Camille, that I heard myself say, I know not whether softly or loudly,  \"Oh, hang the uniform!\"  The morning was almost sultry. As I halted in the clear ripples of a gravelly \"branch\" to let my horse drink, I heard no great way off the Harpers' train shrieking at cattle on the track, and looking up I noticed just behind me an unfrequented by-road carefully masked with brush, according to a new habit of the \"citizens\". The next moment my horse threw up his head to listen. Then I heard hoofs and voices, and presently there came trotting through the oak bushes and around the mask of brush two horsemen unusually well mounted, clad and armed. Their very dark gray uniforms were so trim and so nearly blue that my heart came into my throat; but then I noticed they carried neither carbines nor sabres, but repeaters only, a brace to each. They splashed lightly to either side of me, and the three horses drank together.  \"Good-morning,\" we said. One of the men was a sergeant. He scanned my animal, and then me, with a dawning smile. \"That's a fightin'-cock of a horse you've got, sonny.\"  \"Yes, bub,\" I replied. The two men laughed so explosively that my horse lifted his head austerely.  \"Jim,\" said the younger, \"I don't believe all the conscripts we've caught these three days are worth the powder they've cost!\"  \"No,\" replied Sergeant Jim, \"I doubt if the most of 'em are.\" I turned to him and drew down my under eyelid. \"Will you kindly tell me, sir, if you see any unnatural discoloration in there?\"  He smiled. \"No, but I can put some there if you want it.\"  \"Thank you, I couldn't let you take so much trouble--or risk.\"  The three of us pattered out of the stream abreast. \"No trouble,\" replied the sergeant, \"it wouldn't take half a minute.\"  \"No,\" I rejoined, \"the first step would be the last.\"  The men laughed again. \"You must a-been born with all your teeth,\" said the private, as we quickened to a trot. \"What makes you think we ain't after conscripts?\"  \"Oh, if you were you wouldn't say so. You'd let on to be looking for good crossings on Pearl River, so that if Johnston should get chewed up we needn't be caught here in a hole, Ferry's scouts and all.\"  The pair looked at each other behind my neck for full ten seconds. Then the younger man leaned to his horse's mane in a silent laugh while Sergeant Jim looked me over again and remarked that he would be horn-swoggled!  \"I'm willing,\" I responded, and we all laughed. The younger horseman asked my name. \"Smith,\" I said, with dignity, and they laughed again, their laugh growing louder when I would not smile.  \"Well, say; maybe you'll tell us who this is we're about to meet up with.\"  Through the shifting colonnades of pine, a hundred yards in front of us, came two horsemen in the same blue-gray of the pair beside me. \"Whoever he is,\" I said, \"that gray he's riding is his second best, or it's borrowed,\" for his mount, though good, was no match for him.  \"Borrowed!\" echoed the sergeant. \"If he doesn't own that mare no man does.\"  \"Nor no woman?\" I asked, and again across the back of my neck my two companions gazed at each other.  \"By ganny!\" exclaimed one, and--\"You're a coon,\" murmured the other, as the new-comers drew near. The younger of these also was a private. Behind his elbow was swung a Maynard rifle. Both carried revolvers. The elder wore a long straight sword whose weather-dimmed orange sash showed at the front of a loose cut-away jacket. Under this garment was a shirt of strong black silk, made from some lady's gown and daintily corded with yellow. On the jacket's upturned collar were the two gilt bars of a first lieutenant, but the face above them shone with a combined intelligence and purity that drew my whole attention.  A familiar friendship lighted every countenance but mine as this second pair turned and rode with us, the lieutenant in front on Sergeant Jim Longley's right, and the two privates with me between them behind. For some minutes the sergeant, in under-tone, made report to his young superior. Then in a small clearing he turned abruptly into a neighborhood road, and at his word my two companions pricked after him westward. I closed up beside the lieutenant; he praised the weather, and soon our talk was fluent though broken, as we moved sometimes at a trot and often faster. In stolen moments I scanned him with the jealousy of my youth. Five feet, ten; humph! I was five, nine and a thirty-second. In weight he looked to be just what I always had in mind in those prayers without words with which I mounted every pair of commissary scales I came to. The play of his form as our smooth-gaited horses sped through the flecking shades was worth watching for"]]]
