Why, he did come right out one day and give hints to me to that effect.  Sez I, \"Why do you go on and be so secret about it? Why don't you tell your companion all about it, what you are a-goin' to do, and advise with her?\"  And he sez, \"I guess I know what I am about. She is one of the relations on my side, and I guess I have got a few rights left, and a little spunk.\"  \"Yes,\" sez I, sadly, \"you have got the spunk.\"  \"Wall,\" sez he, \"I guess I can spunk up, and do somethin' for one of my own relations, without any interference or any advice from any of the Smith family, or anybody else.\"  Sez I, \"I don't want to stop your doin' all you can for Lodema, but why not tell what you are a-goin' to do?\"  \"It will be time enough when the time comes,\" sez he. \"You will find it out in the course of next week.\"  Wall, it run along to the middle of the next week. And one day I had jest sot down to tie off a comforter.  It wuz unbleached cheese cloth that I had bought and colored with tea leaves. It wuz a sort of a light mice color, a pretty soft gray, and I wuz goin' to tie it in with little balls of red zephyr woosted, and work it in buttonhole stitch round the edge with the same.  It wuz fur our bed, Josiah's and mine, and it wuz goin' to be soft and warm and very pretty, though I say it, that shouldn't.  [Illustration: \"I HAD JEST SOT DOWN TO TIE OFF A COMFORTER.\"]  It wuzn't quite so pretty as them that hain't colored. I had 'em for my spare beds, cream color tied with pale blue and pink, that wuz perfectly beautiful and very dressy; but I thought for everyday use a colored one would be better.  Wall, I had brought it out and wuz jest a-goin' to put it onto the frames (some new-fashioned ones I had borrowed from Tirzah Ann for the occasion).  And Cousin Lodema had jest observed, \"that the new-fashioned frames with legs wuzn't good for nothin', and she didn't like the color of gray, it looked too melancholy, and would be apt to depress our feelin's too much, and would be tryin' to our complexions.\"  And I told her \"that I didn't spoze there would be a very great congregation in our bedroom, as a general thing in the dead of night, to see whether it wuz becomin' to Josiah and me or not. And, it bein' as dark as Egypt, our complexions wouldn't make a very bad show any way.\"  \"Wall,\" she said, \"to tie it with red wuzn't at all appropriate, it wuz too dressy a color for folks of our age, Josiah's and mine.\" \"Why,\" sez she, \"even _I_, at _my_ age, would skurcely care to sleep under one so gay. And she wouldn't have a cheese cloth comforter any way.\" She sort o' stopped to ketch breath, and Josiah sez:  \"Oh, wall, Lodema, a cheese cloth comforter is better than none, and I should think you would be jest the one to like any sort of a frame on legs.\"  But I wunk at him, a real severe and warnin' wink, and he stopped short off, for all the world as if he had forgot bein' on his good behavior; he stopped short off, and went right to behavin', and sez he to me:  \"Don't put on your comforter to-day, Samantha, for Tirzah Ann and Whitfield and the babe are a-comin' over here bimeby, and Maggie is a-comin', and Thomas Jefferson.\"  \"Wall,\" sez I, \"that is a good reason why I should keep on with it; the girls can help me if I don't get it off before they get here.\"  And then he sez, \"Miss Minkley is a-comin', too, and the Elder.\"  \"Why'ee,\" sez I, \"Josiah Allen, why didn't you tell me before, so I could have baked up somethin' nice? What a man you are to keep things; how long have you known it?\"  \"Oh, a week or so!\"  \"A week!\" sez I; \"Josiah Allen, where is your conscience? if you have got a conscience.\"  \"In the same old place,\" sez he, kinder hittin' himself in the pit of his stomach.  \"Wall, I should think as much,\" sez I.  And Lodema sez, sez she: \"A man that won't tell things is of all creeters that walks the earth the most disagreeable. And I should think the girls, Maggie and Tirzah Ann, would want to stay to home and clean house such a day as this is. And I should think a Elder would want to stay to home so's to be on hand in case of anybody happenin' to be exercised in their minds, and wantin to talk to him on religious subjects. And if I wuz a Elder's wife, I should stay to home with him; I should think it wuz my duty and my privilege. And if I wuz a married woman, I would have enough baked up in the house all the time, so's not to be afraid of company.\"  But I didn't answer back. I jest sot away my frames, and went out and stirred up a cake; I had one kind by me, besides cookies and jell tarts.  But I felt real worked up to think I hadn't heard. Wall, I hadn't more'n got that cake fairly into the oven when the children come, and Elder Minkley and his wife. And I thought they looked queer, and I thought the Elder begun to tell me somethin', and I thought I see Josiah wink at him. But I wouldn't want to take my oath whether he wunk or not, but I _thought_ he wunk.  I wuz jest a turnin' this over in my mind, and a carryin' away their things, when I glanced out of the settin' room winder, and lo, and behold! there wuz Abi Adsit a comin' up to the front door, and right behind her wuz her Pa and Ma Adsit, and Deacon Henzy and his wife, and Miss Henn and Metilda, and Lute Pitkins and his wife, and Miss Petengill, and Deacon Sypher and Drusilly, and Submit Tewksbury--a hull string of 'em as long as a procession.  Sez I, and I spoke it right out before I thought--sez I--  \"Why'ee!\" sez I. \"For the land's sake!\" sez I, \"has there been a funeral, or anything? And are these the mourners?\" sez I. \"Are they stoppin' here to warm?\"  For it wuz a cold day--and I repeated the words to myself mechanically as it wuz, as I see 'em file up the path.  \"They be mourners, hain't they?\"  \"No,\" sez Josiah, who had come in and wuz a standin' by the side of me, as I spoke out to myself unbeknown to me--sez he in a proud axent--  \"No, they hain't mourners, they are Happyfiers; they are Highlariers; they have come to our party. We are givin' a party, Samantha. We are havin' a diamond weddin' here for Lodema.\"  \"A diamond weddin'!\" I repeated mechanically.  \"Yes, this is my happy surprise for Lodema.\"  I looked at Lodema Trumble. She looked strange. She had sunk back in her chair. I thought she wuz a-goin' to faint, and she told somebody the next day, \"that she did almost lose her conscientiousness.\"  \"Why,\" sez I, \"she hain't married.\"  [Illustration: \"WE ARE GIVIN' A PARTY, SAMANTHA.\"]  \"Wall, she ort to be, if she hain't,\" sez he. \"I say it is high time for her to have some sort of a weddin'. Everybody is a havin' 'em--tin, and silver and wooden, and basswood, and glass, and etc.--and I thought it wuz a perfect shame that Lodema shouldn't have none of no kind--and I thought I'd  lay to, and surprise her with one. Every other man seemed to be a-holdin' off, not willin' seemin'ly that she should have one, and I jest thought I would happify her with one.\"  \"Wall, why didn't you make her a silver one, or a tin?\" sez I.  \"Or a paper one!\" screamed Lodema, who had riz up out of her almost faintin' condition. \"That would have been much more appropriate,\" sez she.  \"Wall, I thought a diamond one would be more profitable to her. For I asked 'em all to bring diamonds, if they brought anything. And then I thought it would be more suitable to her age.\"  \"Why!\" she screamed out. \"They have to be married seventy-five years before they can have one.\"  \"Yes,\" sez he dreemily, \"I thought that would be about the right figure.\"  Lodema wuz too mad to find fault or complain or anything. She jest marched up-stairs and didn't come down agin that night. And the young folks had a splendid good time, and the old ones, too.  Tirzah Ann and Maggie had brought some refreshments with 'em, and so had some of the other wimmen, and, with what I had, there wuz enough, and more than enough, to refresh ourselves with.  Wall, the very next mornin' Lodema marched down like a grenideer, and ordered Josiah to take her to the train. And she eat breakfast with her things on, and went away immegiately after, and hain't been back here sense.  And I wuz truly glad to see her go, but wuz sorry she went in such a way, and I tell Josiah he wuz to blame,  But he acts as innocent as you pleese. And he goes all over the arguments agin every time I take him to do about it. He sez \"she wuz old enough to have a weddin' of some kind.\"  And of course I can't dispute that, when he faces me right down, and sez:  \"Hain't she old enough?\"  And I'll say, kinder short--  \"Why, I spoze so!\"  \"Wall,\" sez he, \"wouldn't it have been profitable to her if they had brought diamonds? Wouldn't it have been both surprisin' and profitable?\" And sez he, \"I told 'em expressly to bring diamonds if they had more than they wanted. I charged old Bobbet and Lute Pitkins specially on the subject. I didn't want 'em to scrimp themselves; but,\" sez I, \"if you have got more diamonds than you want, Lute, bring over a few to Lodema.\"  [Illustration: \"IF YOU HAVE GOT MORE DIAMONDS THAN YOU WANT.\"]  \"Yes,\" sez I, coldly, \"he wuz dretful likely to have diamonds more then he wanted, workin' out by day's work to support his family. You know there wuzn't a soul you invited that owned a diamond.\"  \"How did I know what they owned? I never have prowled round into their bureau draws and things, tryin' to find out what they had; they might have had quarts of 'em, and I not know it.\"  Sez I, \"You did it to make fun of Lodema and get rid of her. And it only makes it worse to try to smooth it over.\" Sez I, \"I'd be honorable about it if I wuz in your place, and own up.\"  \"Own up? What have I got to own up? I shall always"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9445"],["title","Samantha among the Brethren — Volume 3 (#2)"],["body","if my orders wuz carried out, it would have been a profitable affair for Lodema, and it would--profitable and surprisin'.\"  And that is all I can get him to say about it, from that day to this.     CHAPTER IX.   But truly the labors that descended onto my shoulders immegiately after Lodema's departure wuz hard enough to fill up my hull mind, and tax every one of my energies.  Yes, my labors and the labors of the other female Jonesvillians wuz deep and arjuous in the extreme (of which more and anon bimeby).  I had been the female appinted in a private and becomin' female way, to go to Loontown to see the meetin' house there that we heard they had fixed over in a cheap but commojous way. And for reasons (of which more and anon) we wanted to inquire into the expense, the looks on't, etc., etc.  So I persuaded Josiah Allen to take me over to Loontown on this pressin' business, and he gin his consent to go on the condition that we should stop for a visit to Cephas Bodley'ses. Josiah sets store by 'em. You see they are relations of ourn and have been for some time, entirely unbeknown to us, and they'd come more'n a year ago a huntin' of us up. They said they \"thought relations ought to be hunted up and hanged together.\" They said \"the idea of huntin' us up had come to 'em after readin' my books.\" They told me so, and I said, \"Wall!\" I didn't add nor diminish to that one \"wall,\" for I didn't want to act too backward, nor too forward. I jest kep' kinder neutral, and said, \"Wall!\"  You see Cephas'ses father's sister-in-law wuz stepmother to my aunt's second cousin on my father's side. And Cephas said that \"he had felt more and more, as years went by, that it wuz a burnin' shame for relations to not know and love each other.\" He said \"he felt that he loved Josiah and me dearly.\"  I didn't say right out whether it wuz reciprokated or not I kinder said, \"Wall!\" agin.  And I told Josiah, in perfect confidence and the wood-house chamber, \"that I had seen nearer relations than Mr. Bodley'ses folks wuz to us,\"  [Illustration: \"CEPHAS SAID IT WUZ A BURNIN' SHAME FOR RELATIONS TO NOT KNOW AND LOVE EACH OTHER.\"]  Howsumever, I done well by 'em. Josiah killed a fat turkey, and I baked it, and done other things for their comfort, and we had quite a good time.  Cephas wuz ruther flowery and enthusiastick, and his mouth and voice wuz ruther large, but he meant well, I should judge, and we had quite a good time.  She wuz very freckled, and a second-day Baptist by perswasion, and wuz piecin' up a crazy bedquilt. She went a-visitin' a good deal, and got pieces of the women's dresses where she visited for blocks. So it wuz quite a savin' bedquilt, and very good-lookin', considerin'.  But to resoom and continue on. Cephas'ses folks made us promise on our two sacred honors, Josiah's honor and mine, that we would pay back the visit, for, as Cephas said, \"for relatives to live so clost to each other, and not to visit back and forth, wuz a burnin' shame and a disgrace.\" And Josiah promised that we would go right away after sugerin'.  We wouldn't promise on the New Testament, as Cephas wanted us to (he is dretful enthusiastick); but we gin good plain promises that we would go, and laid out to keep our two words.  Wall, we got there onexpected, as they had come onto us. And we found 'em plunged into trouble. Their only child, a girl, who had married a young lawyer of Loontown, had jest lost her husband with the typus, and they wuz a-makin' preparations for the funeral when we got there. She and her husband had come on a visit, and he wuz took down bed-sick there and died.  I told 'em I felt like death to think I had descended down onto 'em at such a time.  But Cephas said he wuz jest dispatchin' a messenger for us when we arrove, for, he said, \"in a time of trouble, then wuz the time, if ever, that a man wanted his near relations clost to him.\"  And he said \"we had took a load offen him by appearin' jest as we did, for there would have been some delay in gettin' us there, if the messenger had been dispatched.\"  He said \"that mornin' he had felt so bad that he wanted to die--it seemed as if there wuzn't nothin' left for him to live for; but now he felt that he had sunthin' to live for, now his relatives wuz gathered round him.\"  Josiah shed tears to hear Cephas go on. I myself didn't weep none, but I wuz glad if we could be any comfort to 'em, and told 'em so.  And I told Sally Ann, that wuz Cephas'ses wife, that I would do anything I could to help 'em. And she said everything wuz a-bein' done that wuz necessary. She didn't know of but one thing that wuz likely to be overlooked and neglected, and that wuz the crazy bedquilt. She said \"she would love to have that finished to throw over a lounge in the settin'-room, that wuz frayed out on the edges, and if I felt like it, it _would_ be a great relief to her to have me take it right offen her hands and finish it.\"  So I took out my thimble and needle (I always carry such necessaries with me, in a huzzy made expressly for that purpose), and I sot down and went to piecin' up. There wuz seventeen blocks to piece up, each one crazy as a loon to look at, and it wuz all to set together.  She had the pieces, for she had been off on a visitin' tower the week before, and collected of 'em.  So I sot in quiet and the big chair in the settin'-room, and pieced up, and see the preparations goin' on round us.  I found that Cephas'ses folks lived in a house big and showy-lookin', but not so solid and firm as I had seen.  It wuz one of the houses, outside and inside, where more pains had been took with the porticos and ornaments than with the underpinnin'.  It had a showy and kind of a shaky look. And I found that that extended to Cephas'ses business arrangements. Amongst the other ornaments of his buildin's wuz mortgages, quite a lot of'em, and of almost every variety. He had gin his only child, S. Annie (she wuz named after her mother, Sally Ann, but spelt it this way), he had gin S. Annie a showy education, a showy weddin', and a showy settin'-out. But she had had the good luck to marry a sensible man, though poor.  [Illustration: \"So I SOT IN QUIET AND THE BIG CHAIR.\"]  He took S. Annie and the brackets, the piano and hangin' lamps and baskets and crystal bead lambrequins, her father had gin her, moved 'em all into a good, sensible, small house, and went to work to get a practice and a livin'. He was a lawyer by perswasion.  Wall, he worked hard, day and night, for three little children come to 'em pretty fast, and S. Annie consumed a good deal in trimmin's and cheap lace to ornament 'em; she wuz her father's own girl for ornament. But he worked so hard, and had so many irons in the fire, and kep' 'em all so hot, that he got a good livin' for 'em, and begun to lay up money towards buyin' 'em a house--a home.  He talked a sight, so folks said that knew him well, about his consumin' desire and aim to get his wife and children into a little home of their own, into a safe little haven, where they could live if he wuz called away. They say that that wuz on his mind day and night, and wuz what nerved his hand so in the fray, and made him so successful. Wall, he had laid up about nine hundred dollars towards a home, every dollar on it earned by hard work and consecrated by this deathless hope and affection. The house he had got his mind on only cost about a thousand dollars. Loontown property is cheap.  Wall, he had laid up nine hundred, and wuz a-beginnin' to save on the last hundred, for he wouldn't run in debt a cent any way, when he wuz took voyalent sick there to Cephas'ses; he and S. Annie had come home for a visit of a day or two, and he bein' so run down, and weak with his hard day work and his night work, that he suckumbed to his sickness, and passed away the day before I got there.  Wall, S. Annie wuz jest overcome with grief the day I got there, but the day follerin' she begun to take some interest and help her father in makin' preparations for the funeral.  The body wuz embalmed, accordin' to Cephas'ses and S. Annie's wish, and the funeral wuz to be on the Sunday follerin', and on that Cephas and S. Annie now bent their energies.  To begin with, S. Annie had a hull suit of clear crape made for herself, with a veil that touched the ground; she also had three other suits commenced, for more common wear, trimmed heavy with crape, one of which she ordered for sure the next week, for she said, \"she couldn't stir out of the house in any other color but black.\"  I knew jest how dear crape wuz, and I tackled her on the subject, and sez I--  \"Do you know, S. Annie, these dresses of your'n will cost a sight?\"  \"Cost?\" sez she, a-bustin' out a-cryin'. \"What do I care about cost? I will do everything I can to respect his memory. I do it in remembrance of him.\"  Sez I, gently, \"S. Annie, you wouldn't forget him if you wuz dressed in white. And as for respect, such a life as his, from all I hear of it, don't need crape to throw respect on it; it commands respect, and gets it from everybody.\"  \"But,\" sez Cephas, \"it would look dretful odd to the neighbors if she didn't dress in black.\" Sez he in a skairful tone, and in his intense way--  [Illustration: \"WHAT IS LIFE WORTH WHEN FOLKS TALK?\"]  \"I would ruther resk my life than to have her fail in duty in this way; it would make talk. And.\" sez he, \"what is life worth when folks talk?\" I turned around the crazed block and tackled it in a new place (more luny than ever it seemed to me), and sez I, mekanickly--  \"It is pretty hard work to keep folks from talkin'; to keep 'em from sayin' somethin'.\"  But I see from their looks it wouldn't do to say anything more, so I had to set still and see it go on.  At that time of year flowers wuz dretful high, but S. Annie and Cephas had made up their minds that they must have several flower-pieces from the city nighest to Loontown.  One wuz a-goin' to be a gate ajar, and one wuz to be a gate wide open, and one wuz to be a big book. "]]]
