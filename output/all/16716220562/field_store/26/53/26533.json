As the name came floating down to him through the clear air, a change came over the Colonel's stern face. He stooped over the child. His hand trembled as he put it under her soft chin and raised her eyes to his.  \"Lloyd, Lloyd!\" he repeated, in a puzzled way. \"Can it be possible? There certainly is a wonderful resemblance. You have my little Tom's hair, and only my baby Elizabeth ever had such hazel eyes.\"  He caught her up in his one arm, and strode on to the gate, where the coloured woman stood.  \"Why, Becky, is that you?\" he cried, recognizing an old, trusted servant who had lived at Locust in his wife's lifetime.  Her only answer was a sullen nod.  \"Whose child is this?\" he asked, eagerly, without seeming to notice her defiant looks. \"Tell me if you can.\"  \"How can I tell you, suh,\" she demanded, indignantly, \"when you have fo'bidden even her name to be spoken befo' you?\"  A harsh look came into the Colonel's eyes. He put the child hastily down, and pressed his lips together.  \"Don't tie my sunbonnet, Mom Beck,\" she begged. Then she waved her hand with an engaging smile.  \"Good-bye, suh,\" she said, graciously. \"We've had a mighty nice time!\"  The Colonel took off his hat with his usual courtly bow, but he spoke no word in reply.  When the last flutter of her dress had disappeared around the bend of the road, he walked slowly back toward the house.  Half-way down the long avenue where she had stopped to rest, he sat down on the same rustic seat. He could feel her soft little fingers resting on his neck, where they had lain when he carried her to the gate.  A very un-Napoleonlike mist blurred his sight for a moment. It had been so long since such a touch had thrilled him, so long since any caress had been given him.  More than a score of years had gone by since Tom had been laid in a soldier's grave, and the years that Elizabeth had been lost to him seemed almost a lifetime.  And this was Elizabeth's little daughter. Something very warm and sweet seemed to surge across his heart as he thought of the Little Colonel. He was glad, for a moment, that they called her that; glad that his only grandchild looked enough like himself for others to see the resemblance.  But the feeling passed as he remembered that his daughter had married against his wishes, and he had closed his doors for ever against her.  The old bitterness came back redoubled in its force.  The next instant he was stamping down the avenue, roaring for Walker, his body-servant, in such a tone that the cook's advice was speedily taken: \"Bettah hump yo'self outen dis heah kitchen befo' de ole tigah gits to lashin' roun' any pearter.\"     CHAPTER II.   Mom Beck carried the ironing-board out of the hot kitchen, set the irons off the stove, and then tiptoed out to the side porch of the little cottage.  \"Is yo' head feelin' any bettah, honey?\" she said to the pretty, girlish-looking woman lying in the hammock. \"I promised to step up to the hotel this evenin' to see one of the chambah-maids. I thought I'd take the Little Cun'l along with me if you was willin'. She's always wild to play with Mrs. Wyford's children up there.\"  \"Yes, I'm better, Becky,\" was the languid reply. \"Put a clean dress on Lloyd if you are going to take her out.\"  Mrs. Sherman closed her eyes again, thinking gratefully, \"Dear, faithful old Becky! What a comfort she has been all my life, first as my nurse, and now as Lloyd's! She is worth her weight in gold!\"  The afternoon shadows were stretching long across the grass when Mom Beck led the child up the green slope in front of the hotel.  The Little Colonel had danced along so gaily with Fritz that her cheeks glowed like wild roses. She made a quaint little picture with such short sunny hair and dark eyes shining out from under the broad-brimmed white hat she wore.  Several ladies who were sitting on the shady piazza, busy with their embroidery, noticed her admiringly. \"It's Elizabeth Lloyd's little daughter,\" one of them explained. \"Don't you remember what a scene there was some years ago when she married a New York man? Sherman, I believe, his name was, Jack Sherman. He was a splendid fellow, and enormously wealthy. Nobody could say a word against him, except that he was a Northerner. That was enough for the old Colonel, though. He hates Yankees like poison. He stormed and swore, and forbade Elizabeth ever coming in his sight again. He had her room locked up, and not a soul on the place ever dares mention her name in his hearing.\"  The Little Colonel sat down demurely on the piazza steps to wait for the children. The nurse had not finished dressing them for the evening.  She amused herself by showing Fritz the pictures in an illustrated weekly. It was not long until she began to feel that the ladies were talking about her. She had lived among older people so entirely that her thoughts were much deeper than her baby speeches would lead one to suppose.  She understood dimly, from what she had heard the servants say, that there was some trouble between her mother and grandfather. Now she heard it rehearsed from beginning to end. She could not understand what they meant by \"bank failures\" and \"unfortunate investments,\" but she understood enough to know that her father had lost nearly all his money, and had gone West to make more.  Mrs. Sherman had moved from their elegant New York home two weeks ago to this little cottage in Lloydsborough that her mother had left her. Instead of the houseful of servants they used to have, there was only faithful Mom Beck to do everything.  There was something magnetic in the child's eyes.  Mrs. Wyford shrugged her shoulders uneasily as she caught their piercing gaze fixed on her.  \"I do believe that little witch understood every word I said,\" she exclaimed.  \"Oh, certainly not,\" was the reassuring answer. \"She's such a little thing.\"  But she had heard it all, and understood enough to make her vaguely unhappy. Going home she did not frisk along with Fritz, but walked soberly by Mom Beck's side, holding tight to the friendly black hand.  \"We'll go through the woods,\" said Mom Beck, lifting her over the fence. \"It's not so long that way.\"  As they followed the narrow, straggling path into the cool dusk of the woods, she began to sing. The crooning chant was as mournful as a funeral dirge.    \"The clouds hang heavy, an' it's gwine to rain.   Fa'well, my dyin' friends.   I'm gwine to lie in the silent tomb.   Fa'well, my dyin' friends.\"  A muffled little sob made her stop and look down in surprise.  \"Why, what's the mattah, honey?\" she exclaimed. \"Did Emma Louise make you mad? Or is you cryin' 'cause you're so ti'ed? Come! Ole Becky'll tote her baby the rest of the way.\"  She picked the light form up in her arms, and, pressing the troubled little face against her shoulder, resumed her walk and her song.    \"It's a world of trouble we're travellin' through,   Fa'well, my dyin' friends.\"  \"Oh, don't, Mom Beck,\" sobbed the child, throwing her arms around the woman's neck, and crying as though her heart would break.  \"Land sakes, what is the mattah?\" she asked, in alarm. She sat down on a mossy log, took off the white hat, and looked into the flushed, tearful face.  \"Oh, it makes me so lonesome when you sing that way,\" wailed the Little Colonel. \"I just can't 'tand it! Mom Beck, is my mothah's heart all broken? Is that why she is sick so much, and will it kill her suah 'nuff?\"  \"Who's been tellin' you such nonsense?\" asked the woman, sharply.  \"Some ladies at the hotel were talkin' about it. They said that gran'fathah didn't love her any moah, an' it was just a-killin' her.\" Mom Beck frowned fiercely.  The child's grief was so deep and intense that she did not know just how to quiet her. Then she said, decidedly, \"Well, if that's all that's a-troublin' you, you can jus' get down an' walk home on yo' own laigs. Yo' mamma's a-grievin' 'cause yo' papa has to be away all the time. She's all wo'n out, too, with the work of movin', when she's nevah been used to doin' anything. But her heart isn't broke any moah'n my neck is.\"  The positive words and the decided toss Mom Beck gave her head settled the matter for the Little Colonel. She wiped her eyes and stood up much relieved.  \"Don't you nevah go to worryin' 'bout what you heahs,\" continued the woman. \"I tell you p'intedly you cyarnt nevah b'lieve what you heahs.\"  \"Why doesn't gran'fathah love my mothah?\" asked the child, as they came in sight of the cottage. She had puzzled over the knotty problem all the way home. \"How can papas not love their little girls?\"  \"'Cause he's stubbo'n,\" was the unsatisfactory answer. \"All the Lloyds is. Yo' mamma's stubbo'n, an' you's stubbo'n--\"  \"I'm not!\" shrieked the Little Colonel, stamping her foot. \"You sha'n't call me names!\"  Then she saw a familiar white hand waving to her from the hammock, and she broke away from Mom Beck with very red cheeks and very bright eyes.  Cuddled close in her mother's arms, she had a queer feeling that she had grown a great deal older in that short afternoon.  Maybe she had. For the first time in her little life she kept her troubles to herself, and did not once mention the thought that was uppermost in her mind.  \"Yo' great-aunt Sally Tylah is comin' this mawnin',\" said Mom Beck, the day after their visit to the hotel. \"Do fo' goodness' sake keep yo'self clean. I'se got too many spring chickens to dress to think 'bout dressin' you up again.\"  \"Did I evah see her befo'?\" questioned the Little Colonel.  \"Why, yes, the day we moved heah. Don't you know she came and stayed so long, and the rockah broke off the little white rockin'-chair when she sat down in it?\"  \"Oh, now I know!\" laughed the child. \"She's the big fat one with curls hangin' round her yeahs like shavin's. I don't like her, Mom Beck. She keeps a-kissin' me all the time, an' a-'queezin' me, an' tellin' me to sit on her lap an' be a little"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9407"],["title","The Little Colonel (#2)"],["body","y. Mom Beck, I de'pise to be a little lady.\"  There was no answer to her last remark. Mom Beck had stepped into the pantry for more eggs for the cake she was making.  \"Fritz,\" said the Little Colonel, \"yo' great-aunt Sally Tylah's comin' this mawnin', an' if you don't want to say 'howdy' to her you'll have to come with me.\"  A few minutes later a resolute little figure squeezed between the palings of the garden fence down by the gooseberry bushes.  \"Now walk on your tiptoes, Fritz!\" commanded the Little Colonel, \"else somebody will call us back.\"  Mom Beck, busy with her extra baking, supposed she was with her mother on the shady, vine-covered porch.  She would not have been singing quite so gaily if she could have seen half a mile up the road.  The Little Colonel was sitting in the weeds by the railroad track, deliberately taking off her shoes and stockings.  \"Just like a little niggah,\" she said, delightedly, as she stretched out her bare feet. \"Mom Beck says I ought to know bettah. But it does feel so good!\"  No telling how long she might have sat there enjoying the forbidden pleasure of dragging her rosy toes through the warm dust, if she had not heard a horse's hoof-beats coming rapidly along.  \"Fritz, it's gran'fathah,\" she whispered, in alarm, recognizing the erect figure of the rider in its spotless suit of white duck.  \"Sh! lie down in the weeds, quick! Lie down, I say!\" They both made themselves as flat as possible, and lay there panting with the exertion of keeping still.  Presently the Little Colonel raised her head cautiously.  \"Oh, he's gone down that lane!\" she exclaimed. \"Now you can get up.\" After a moment's deliberation she asked, \"Fritz, would you rathah have some 'trawberries an' be tied up fo' runnin' away, or not be tied up and not have any of those nice tas'en 'trawberries?\"     CHAPTER III.   Two hours later, Colonel Lloyd, riding down the avenue under the locusts, was surprised by a novel sight on his stately front steps.  Three little darkies and a big flop-eared hound were crouched on the bottom step, looking up at the Little Colonel, who sat just above them.  She was industriously stirring something in an old rusty pan with a big, battered spoon.  \"Now, May Lilly,\" she ordered, speaking to the largest and blackest of the group, \"you run an' find some nice 'mooth pebbles to put in for raisins. Henry Clay, you go get me some moah sand. This is 'most too wet.\"  \"Here, you little pickaninnies!\" roared the Colonel, as he recognized the cook's children. \"What did I tell you about playing around here, tracking dirt all over my premises? You just chase back to the cabin where you belong!\"  The sudden call startled Lloyd so that she dropped the pan, and the great mud pie turned upside down on the white steps.  \"Well, you're a pretty sight!\" said the Colonel, as he glanced with disgust from her soiled dress and muddy hands to her bare feet.  He had been in a bad humour all morning. The sight of the steps covered with sand and muddy tracks gave him an excuse to give vent to his cross feelings.  It was one of his theories that a little girl should always be kept as fresh and dainty as a flower. He had never seen his own little daughter in such a plight as this, and she had never been allowed to step outside of her own room without her shoes and stockings.  \"What does your mother mean,\" he cried, savagely, \"by letting you run barefooted around the country just like poor white trash? An' what are you playing with low-flung niggers for? Haven't you ever been taught any better? I suppose it's some of your father's miserable Yankee notions.\"  May Lilly, peeping around the corner of the house, rolled her frightened eyes from one angry face to the other. The same temper that glared from the face of the man, sitting erect in his saddle, seemed to be burning in the eyes of the child, who stood so defiantly before him. The same kind of scowl drew their eyebrows together darkly.  \"Don't you talk that way to me,\" cried the Little Colonel, trembling with a wrath she did not know how to express.  Suddenly she stooped, and snatching both hands full of mud from the overturned pie, flung it wildly over the spotless white coat.  Colonel Lloyd gasped with astonishment. It was the first time in his life he had ever been openly defied. The next moment his anger gave way to amusement.  \"By George!\" he chuckled, admiringly. \"The little thing has got spirit, sure enough. She's a Lloyd through and through. So that's why they call her the 'Little Colonel,' is it?\"  There was a tinge of pride in the look he gave her haughty little head and flashing eyes. \"There, there, child!\" he said, soothingly. \"I didn't mean to make you mad, when you were good enough to come and see me. It isn't often I have a little lady like you pay me a visit.\"  \"I didn't come to see you, suh,\" she answered, indignantly, as she started toward the gate. \"I came to see May Lilly. But I nevah would have come inside yo' gate if I'd known you was goin' to hollah at me an' be so cross.\"  She was walking off with the air of an offended queen, when the Colonel remembered that if he allowed her to go away in that mood she would probably never set foot on his grounds again. Her display of temper had interested him immensely.  Now that he had laughed off his ill humour, he was anxious to see what other traits of character she possessed. He wheeled his horse across the walk to bar her way, and quickly dismounted.  \"Oh, now, wait a minute,\" he said, in a coaxing tone. \"Don't you want a nice big saucer of strawberries and cream before you go? Walker's picking some now. And you haven't seen my hothouse. It's just full of the loveliest flowers you ever saw. You like roses, don't you, and pinks and lilies and pansies?\"  He saw he had struck the right chord as soon as he mentioned the flowers. The sullen look vanished as if by magic. Her face changed as suddenly as an April day.  \"Oh, yes!\" she cried, with a beaming smile. \"I loves 'm bettah than anything!\"  He tied his horse, and led the way to the conservatory. He opened the door for her to pass through, and then watched her closely to see what impression it would make on her. He had expected a delighted exclamation of surprise, for he had good reason to be proud of his rare plants. They were arranged with a true artist's eye for colour and effect.  She did not say a word for a moment, but drew a long breath, while the delicate pink in her cheeks deepened and her eyes lighted up. Then she began going slowly from flower to flower, laying her face against the cool, velvety purple of the pansies, touching the roses with her lips, and tilting the white lily-cups to look into their golden depths.  As she passed from one to another as lightly as a butterfly might have done, she began chanting in a happy undertone.  Ever since she had learned to talk she had a quaint little way of singing to herself. All the names that pleased her fancy she strung together in a crooning melody of her own.  There was no special tune. It sounded happy, although nearly always in a minor key.  \"Oh, the jonquils an' the lilies!\" she sang. \"All white an' gold an' yellow. Oh, they're all a-smilin' at me, an' a-sayin' howdy! howdy!\"  She was so absorbed in her intense enjoyment that she forgot all about the old Colonel. She was wholly unconscious that he was watching or listening.  \"She really does love them,\" he thought, complacently. \"To see her face one would think she had found a fortune.\"  It was another bond between them.  After awhile he took a small basket from the wall, and began to fill it with his choicest blooms. \"You shall have these to take home,\" he said. \"Now come into the house and get your strawberries.\"  She followed him reluctantly, turning back several times for one more long sniff of the delicious fragrance.  She was not at all like the Colonel's ideal of what a little girl should be, as she sat in one of the high, stiff chairs, enjoying her strawberries. Her dusty little toes wriggled around in the curls on Fritz's back, as she used him for a footstool. Her dress was draggled and dirty, and she kept leaning over to give the dog berries and cream from the spoon she was eating with herself.  He forgot all this, however, when she began to talk to him.  \"My great-aunt Sally Tylah is to our house this mawnin',\" she announced, confidentially. \"That's why we came off. Do you know my Aunt Sally Tylah?\"  \"Well, slightly!\" chuckled the Colonel. \"She was my wife's half-sister. So you don't like her, eh? Well, I don't like her either.\"  He threw back his head and laughed heartily. The more the child talked the more entertaining he found her. He did not remember when he had ever been so amused before as he was by this tiny counterpart of himself.  When the last berry had vanished, she slipped down from the tall chair.  \"Do you 'pose it's very late?\" she asked, in an anxious voice. \"Mom Beck will be comin' for me soon.\"  \"Yes, it is nearly noon,\" he answered. \"It didn't do much good to run away from your Aunt Tyler; she'll see you after all.\"  \"Well, she can't 'queeze me an' kiss me, 'cause I've been naughty, an' I'll be put to bed like I was the othah day, just as soon as I get home. I 'most wish I was there now,\" she sighed. \"It's so fa' an' the sun's so hot. I lost my sunbonnet when I was comin' heah, too.\"  Something in the tired, dirty face prompted the old Colonel to say, \"Well, my horse hasn't been put away yet. I'll take you home on Maggie Boy.\"  The next moment he repented making such an offer, thinking what the neighbours might say if they should meet him on the road with Elizabeth's child in his arm.  But it was too late. He could not unclasp the trusting little hand that was slipped in his. He could not cloud the happiness of the eager little face by retracting his promise.  He swung himself into the saddle, with her in front. Then he put his one arm around her with a firm clasp, as he reached forward to take the bridle.  "]]]
