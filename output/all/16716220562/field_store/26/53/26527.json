Echo the far-off roll of thunder,         Rumbling loud     And ever louder, under     The blue-black curtain of cloud,     Where the lightning serpents gleam,       Echo the moaning     Of the forest in its sleep     Like a giant groaning   In the torment of a dream.      Now an interval of quiet     For a moment holds the air     In the breathless hush     Of a silent prayer.      Then the sudden rush     Of the rain, and the riot     Of the shrieking, tearing gale     Breaks loose in the night,     With a fusillade of hail!     Hear the forest fight,   With its tossing arms that crack and clash     In the thunder's cannonade,     While the lightning's forkèd flash   Brings the old hero-trees to the ground with a crash!   Hear the breakers' deepening roar,     Driven like a herd of cattle     In the wild stampede of battle,   Trampling, trampling, trampling, to overwhelm the shore.      Is it the end of all?     Will the land crumble and fall?     Nay, for a voice replies     Out of the hidden skies,   \"Thus far, O sea, shalt thou go,   So long, O wind, shalt thou blow:   Return to your bounds and cease,   And let the earth have peace!\"      O Music, lead the way--       The stormy night is past,   Lift up our heads to greet the day,       And the joy of things that last.      The dissonance and pain       That mortals must endure   Are changed in thine immortal strain       To something great and pure.      True love will conquer strife,       And strength from conflict flows,   For discord is the thorn of life       And harmony the rose.     May, 1916.        FRANCE AND BELGIUM       THE BELLS OF MALINES    AUGUST 17, 1914     The gabled roofs of old Malines   Are russet red and gray and green,   And o'er them in the sunset hour   Looms, dark and huge, St. Rombold's tower.   High in that rugged nest concealed,   The sweetest bells that ever pealed,   The deepest bells that ever rung,   The lightest bells that ever sung,   Are waiting for the master's hand   To fling their music o'er the land.    And shall they ring to-night, Malines?   In nineteen hundred and fourteen,   The frightful year, the year of woe,   When fire and blood and rapine flow   Across the land from lost Liége,   Storm-driven by the German rage?   The other carillons have ceased;   Fallen is Hasselt, fallen Diesl,   From Ghent and Bruges no voices come,   Antwerp is silent, Brussels dumb!    But in thy belfry, O Malines,   The master of the bells unseen   Has climbed to where the keyboard stands,--   To-night his heart is in his hands!   Once more, before invasion's hell   Breaks round the tower he loves so well,   Once more he strikes the well-worn keys,   And sends aërial harmonies   Far-floating through the twilight dim   In patriot song and holy hymn.    O listen, burghers of Malines!   Soldier and workman, pale béguine.   And mother with a trembling flock   Of children clinging to thy frock,--   Look up and listen, listen all!   What tunes are these that gently fall   Around you like a benison?   \"The Flemish Lion,\" \"Brabançonne,\"   \"O brave Liége,\" and all the airs   That Belgium in her bosom bears.    Ring up, ye silvery octaves high,   Whose notes like circling swallows fly;   And ring, each old sonorous bell,--   \"Jesu,\" \"Maria,\" \"Michaël!\"   Weave in and out, and high and low,   The magic music that you know,   And let it float and flutter down   To cheer the heart of the troubled town.   Ring out, \"Salvator,\" lord of all,--   \"Roland\" in Ghent may hear thee call!    O brave bell-music of Malines,   In this dark hour how much you mean!   The dreadful night of blood and tears   Sweeps down on Belgium, but she hears   Deep in her heart the melody   Of songs she learned when she was free.   She will not falter, faint, nor fail,   But fight until her rights prevail   And all her ancient belfries ring   \"The Flemish Lion,\" \"God Save the King!\"       THE NAME OF FRANCE     Give us a name to fill the mind   With the shining thoughts that lead mankind,   The glory of learning, the joy of art,--   A name that tells of a splendid part.   In long, long toil and the strenuous fight   Of the human race to win its way   From the feudal darkness into the day   Of Freedom, Brotherhood, Equal Right,--   A name like a star, a name of light.   I give you _France_!    Give us a name to stir the blood   With a warmer glow and a swifter flood,   At the touch of a courage that knows not fear,--   A name like the sound of a trumpet, clear.   And silver-sweet, and iron-strong,   That calls three million men to their feet,   Ready to march, and steady to meet   The foes who threaten that name with wrong,--   A name that rings like a battle-song.   I give you _France_!    Give us a name to move the heart   With the strength that noble griefs impart,   A name that speaks of the blood outpoured   To save mankind from the sway of the sword,--   A name that calls on the world to share   In the burden of sacrificial strife   When the cause at stake is the world's free life   And the rule of the people everywhere,--   A name like a vow, a name like a prayer.   I give you _France_!    The Hague, September, 1916.       JEANNE D'ARC RETURNS    1914 1916     What hast thou done, O womanhood of France,     Mother and daughter, sister, sweetheart, wife,     What hast thou done, amid this fateful strife,   To prove the pride of thine inheritance.   In this fair land of freedom and romance?     I hear thy voice with tears and courage rife,--     Smiling against the swords that seek thy life--   Make answer in a noble utterance:   \"I give France all I have, and all she asks.     Would it were more! Ah, let her ask and take;   My hands to nurse her wounded, do her tasks,--     My feet to run her errands through the dark,--   My heart to bleed in triumph for her sake,--     And all my soul to follow thee, Jeanne d'Arc!\"     April 16, 1916.       INTERLUDES IN HOLLAND       THE HEAVENLY HILLS OF HOLLAND     The heavenly hills of Holland,--     How wondrously they rise   Above the smooth green pastures     Into the azure skies!   With blue and purple hollows,     With peaks of dazzling snow,   Along the far horizon     The clouds are marching slow,    No mortal fool has trodden     The summits of that range,   Nor walked those mystic valleys     Whose colors ever change;   Yet we possess their beauty,     And visit them in dreams,   While the ruddy gold of sunset     From cliff and canyon gleams.    In days of cloudless weather     They melt into the light;   When fog and mist surround us     They're hidden from our sight;   But when returns a season     Clear shining after rain,   While the northwest wind is blowing,     We see the hills again.    The old Dutch painters loved them,     Their pictures show them clear,--   Old Hobbema and Ruysduel,     Van Goyen and Vermeer,   Above the level landscape,     Rich polders, long-armed mills,   Canals and ancient cities,--     Float Holland's heavenly hills.     The Hague, November, 1916.       THE PROUD LADY     When Stävoren town was in its prime     And queened the Zuyder Zee,   Its ships went out to every clime     With costly merchantry.    A lady dwelt in that rich town,     The fairest in all the land;   She walked abroad in a velvet gown,     With many rings on her hand.    Her hair was bright as the beaten gold,     Her lips as coral red,   Her roving eyes were blue and bold,     And her heart with pride was fed.    For she was proud of her father's ships,     As she watched them gayly pass;   And pride looked out of her eyes and lips     When she saw herself in the glass.    \"Now come,\" she said to the captains ten,     Who were ready to put to sea,   \"Ye are all my men and my father's men,     And what will ye do for me?\"    \"Go north and south, go east and west,     And get me gifts,\" she said.   \"And he who bringeth me home the best,     With that man will I wed.\"    So they all fared forth, and sought with care     In many a famous mart,   For satins and silks and jewels rare,     To win that lady's heart.    She looked at them all with never a thought     And careless put them by;   \"I am not fain of the things ye brought,     Enough of these have I.\"    The last that came was the head of the fleet,     His name was Jan Borel;   He bent his knee at the lady's feet,--     In truth he loved her well.    \"I've brought thee home the best i' the world,     A shipful of Danzig corn!\"   She stared at him long; her red lips curled,     Her blue eyes filled with scorn.    \"Now out on thee, thou feckless kerl,     A loon thou art,\" she said.   \"Am I a starving beggar girl?     Shall I ever lack for bread?\"    \"Go empty all thy sacks of grain     Into the nearest sea,   And never show thy face again     To make a mock of me.\"    Young Jan Borel, he answered naught,     But in the harbor cast   The sacks of golden corn he brought,     And groaned when fell the last.    Then Jan Borel, he hoisted sail,     And out to sea he bore;   He passed the Helder in a gale     And came again no more.    But the grains of corn went drifting down     Like devil-scattered seed,   To sow the harbor of the town     With a wicked growth of weed.    The roots were thick and the silt and sand     Were gathered day by day,   Till not a furlong out from land     A shoal had barred the way.    Then Stävoren town saw evil years,     No ships could out or in.   The boats lay rolling at the piers,     And the mouldy grain in the bin.    The grass-grown streets were all forlorn,     The town in ruin stood,   The lady's velvet gown was torn,     Her rings were sold for food.    Her father had perished long ago,     But the lady held her pride.   She walked with a scornful step and slow,     Till at last in her rags she died.    Yet still on the crumbling piers of the town,     When the midnight"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9388"],["title","The Red Flower: Poems Written in War Time (#2)"],["body","shines free,   A woman walks in a velvet gown     And scatters corn in the sea.       FLOOD-TIDE OF FLOWERS    IN HOLLAND     The laggard winter ebbed so slow   With freezing rain and melting snow,   It seemed as if the earth would stay   Forever where the tide was low,   In sodden green and watery gray.    But now from depths beyond our sight,   The tide is turning in the night,   And floods of color long concealed   Come silent rising toward the light,   Through garden bare and empty field.    And first, along the sheltered nooks,   The crocus runs in little brooks   Of joyance, till by light made bold   They show the gladness of their looks   In shining pools of white and gold.    The tiny scilla, sapphire blue,   Is gently sweeping in, to strew   The earth with heaven; and sudden rills   Of sunlit yellow, sweeping through,   Spread into lakes of daffodils.    The hyacinths, with fragrant heads,   Have overflowed their sandy beds,   And fill the earth with faint perfume,   The breath that Spring around her sheds.   And now the tulips break in bloom!    A sea, a rainbow-tinted sea,   A splendor and a mystery,   Floods o'er the fields of faded gray:   The roads are full of folks in glee,   For lo,--to-day is Easter Day!     April, 1916.       ENTER AMERICA       AMERICA'S PROSPERITY     They tell me thou art rich, my country: gold     In glittering flood has poured into thy chest;     Thy flocks and herds increase, thy barns are pressed   With harvest, and thy stores can hardly hold   Their merchandise; unending trains are rolled     Along thy network rails of East and West;     Thy factories and forges never rest;   Thou art enriched in all things bought and sold!    But dost _thou_ prosper? Better news I crave.     O dearest country, is it well with thee       Indeed, and is thy soul in health?   A nobler people, hearts more wisely brave,     And thoughts that lift men up and make them free.--       These are prosperity and vital wealth!     The Hague, October 1, 1916.       THE GLORY OF SHIPS     The glory of ships is an old, old song,     since the days when the sea-rovers ran   In their open boats through the roaring surf,     and the spread of the world began;   The glory of ships is a light on the sea,     and a star in the story of man.    When Homer sang of the galleys of Greece     that conquered the Trojan shore,   And Solomon lauded the barks of Tyre that     brought great wealth to his door,   'Twas little they knew, those ancient men,     what would come of the sail and the oar.    The Greek ships rescued the West from the East,     when they harried the Persians home;   And the Roman ships were the wings of strength     that bore up the empire, Rome;   And the ships or Spain found a wide new world     far over the fields of foam.    Then the tribes of courage at last saw clear     that the ocean was not a bound,   But a broad highway, and a challenge to seek     for treasure as yet unfound;   So the fearless ships fared forth to the search,     in joy that the globe was round.    Their hulls were heightened, their sails spread out.     they grew with the growth of their quest;   They opened the secret doors of the East,     and the golden gates of the West;   And many a city of high renown     was proud of a ship on its crest.    The fleets of England and Holland and France     were at strife with each other and Spain;   And battle and storm sent a myriad ships     to sleep in the depths of the main;   But the seafaring spirit could never be drowned,     and it filled up the fleets again.    They greatened and grew, with the aid of steam,     to a wonderful, vast array,   That carries the thoughts and the traffic of men     into every harbor and bay;   And now in the world-wide work of the ships     'tis England that leads the way.    O well for the leading that follows the law     of a common right on the sea!   But ill for the leader who tries to hold     what belongs to mankind in fee!   The way of the ships is an open way,     and the ocean must ever be free!    Remember, O first of the maritime folk,     how the rise of your greatness began.   It will live if you safeguard the round-the-world road     from the shame of a selfish ban;   For the glory of ships is a light on the sea,     and a star in the story of man!     September 12, 1916.       MARE LIBERUM     I    You dare to say with perjured lips,   \"We fight to make the ocean free\"?   _You_, whose black trail of butchered ships   Bestrews the bed of every sea   Where German submarines have wrought   Their horrors! Have you never thought,--   What you call freedom, men call piracy!     II    Unnumbered ghosts that haunt the wave,   Where you have murdered, cry you down;   And seamen whom you would not save,   Weave now in weed grown depths a crown   Of shame for your imperious head,--   A dark memorial of the dead,--   Women and children whom you sent to drown.     III    Nay, not till thieves are set to guard   The gold, and corsairs called to keep   O'er peaceful commerce watch and ward   And wolves do herd the helpless sheep,   Shall men and women look to thee,   Thou ruthless Old Man of the Sea,   To safeguard law and freedom on the deep!     IV    In nobler breeds we put our trust;   The nations in whose sacred lore   The \"Ought\" stands out above the \"Must,\"   And honor rules in peace and war.   With these we hold in soul and heart,   With these we choose our lot and part,   Till Liberty is safe on sea and shore.     _London Times_, February 12, 1917.       \"LIBERTY ENLIGHTENING THE WORLD\"     Thou warden of the western gate, above Manhattan Bay,   The fogs of doubt that hid thy face are driven clean away:   Thine eyes at last look far and clear, thou liftest high thy hand   To spread the light of liberty world-wide for every land.    No more thou dreamest of a peace reserved alone for thee,   While friends are fighting for thy cause beyond the guardian sea;   The battle that they wage is thine; thou fallest if they fall;   The swollen flood of Prussian pride will sweep unchecked o'er all.    O cruel is the conquer-lust in Hohenzollern brains;   The paths they plot to gain their goal are dark with shameful stains:   No faith they keep, no law revere, no god but naked Might;--   They are the foemen of mankind. Up, Liberty; and smite!    Britain, and France, and Italy, and Russia newly born,   Have waited for thee in the night. Oh, come as comes the morn!   Serene and strong and full of faith, America, arise,   With steady hope and mighty help to join thy brave Allies.    O dearest country of my heart, home of the high desire,   Make clean thy soul for sacrifice on Freedom's altar-fire;   For thou must suffer, thou must fight, until the war-lords cease,   And all the peoples lift their heads in liberty and peace.     _London Times_, April 12, 1917.       THE OXFORD THRUSHES    FEBRUARY, 1917     I never thought again to hear   The Oxford thrushes singing clear,   Amid the February rain,   Their sweet, indomitable strain.    A wintry vapor lightly spreads   Among the trees, and round the beds   Where daffodil and jonquil sleep,   Only the snowdrop wakes to weep.    It is not springtime yet. Alas,   What dark, tempestuous days must pass,   Till England's trial by battle cease,   And summer comes again with peace.    The lofty halls, the tranquil towers,   Where Learning in untroubled hours   Held her high court, serene in fame,   Are lovely still, yet not the same.    The novices in fluttering gown   No longer fill the ancient town,   But fighting men in khaki drest--   And in the Schools the wounded rest.    Ah, far away, 'neath stranger skies   Full many a son of Oxford lies,   And whispers from his warrior grave,   \"I died to keep the faith you gave.\"    The mother mourns, but does not fail,   Her courage and her love prevail   O'er sorrow, and her spirit hears   The promise of triumphant years.    Then sing, ye thrushes, in the rain   Your sweet, indomitable strain.   Ye bring a word from God on high   And voices in our hearts reply.       HOMEWARD BOUND     Home, for my heart still calls me;     Home, through the danger zone;   Home, whatever befalls me,     I will sail again to my own!    Wolves of the sea are hiding     Closely along the way,   Under the water biding     Their moment to rend and slay.    Black is the eagle that brands them,     Black are their hearts as the night,   Black is the hate that sends them     To murder but not to fight.    Flower of the German Culture,     Boast of the Kaiser's Marine,   Choose for your emblem the vulture,     Cowardly, cruel, obscene!    Forth from her sheltered haven     Our peaceful ship glides slow,   Noiseless in flight as a raven,     Gray as a hoodie crow.    She doubles and turns in her bearing,     Like a twisting plover she goes;   The way of her westward faring     Only the captain knows.    In a lonely bay concealing     She lingers for days, and slips   At dusk from her covert, stealing     Thro' channels feared by the ships.    Brave are the men, and steady,     Who guide her over the deep,--   British mariners, ready     To face the sea-wolf's leap.    Lord of the winds and waters,     Bring our ship to her mark,   Safe from this game of hide-and-seek     With murderers in the dark!     On the S.S. _Baltic_, May, 1917."]]]
