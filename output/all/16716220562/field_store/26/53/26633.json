Brief was the silence. Once again      Pealed to the skies that frantic yell,      Glowed on the heavens a fiery stain,      And flashes rose and fell;      And painted on the blood-red sky,      Dark, naked arms were tossed on high;      And, round the white man's lordly hall,      Trod, fierce and free, the brute he made;      And those who crept along the wall,      And answered to his lightest call      With more than spaniel dread,      The creatures of his lawless beck,      Were trampling on his very neck      And on the night-air, wild and clear,      Rose woman's shriek of more than fear;      For bloodied arms were round her thrown,      And dark cheeks pressed against her own!      Where then was he whose fiery zeal      Had taught the trampled heart to feel,      Until despair itself grew strong,      And vengeance fed its torch from wrong?      Now, when the thunderbolt is speeding;      Now, when oppression's heart is bleeding;      Now, when the latent curse of Time      Is raining down in fire and blood,      That curse which, through long years of crime,      Has gathered, drop by drop, its flood,--      Why strikes he not, the foremost one,      Where murder's sternest deeds are done?       He stood the aged palms beneath,      That shadowed o'er his humble door,      Listening, with half-suspended breath,      To the wild sounds of fear and death,      Toussaint L'Ouverture!      What marvel that his heart beat high!      The blow for freedom had been given,      And blood had answered to the cry      Which Earth sent up to Heaven!      What marvel that a fierce delight      Smiled grimly o'er his brow of night,      As groan and shout and bursting flame      Told where the midnight tempest came,      With blood and fire along its van,      And death behind! he was a Man!       Yes, dark-souled chieftain! if the light      Of mild Religion's heavenly ray      Unveiled not to thy mental sight      The lowlier and the purer way,      In which the Holy Sufferer trod,      Meekly amidst the sons of crime;      That calm reliance upon God      For justice in His own good time;      That gentleness to which belongs      Forgiveness for its many wrongs,      Even as the primal martyr, kneeling      For mercy on the evil-dealing;      Let not the favored white man name      Thy stern appeal, with words of blame.      Then, injured Afric! for the shame      Of thy own daughters, vengeance came      Full on the scornful hearts of those,      Who mocked thee in thy nameless woes,      And to thy hapless children gave      One choice,--pollution or the grave!       Has he not, with the light of heaven      Broadly around him, made the same?      Yea, on his thousand war-fields striven,      And gloried in his ghastly shame?      Kneeling amidst his brother's blood,      To offer mockery unto God,      As if the High and Holy One      Could smile on deeds of murder done!      As if a human sacrifice      Were purer in His holy eyes,      Though offered up by Christian hands,      Than the foul rites of Pagan lands!             . . . . . . . . . . .       Sternly, amidst his household band,      His carbine grasped within his hand,      The white man stood, prepared and still,      Waiting the shock of maddened men,      Unchained, and fierce as tigers, when      The horn winds through their caverned hill.      And one was weeping in his sight,      The sweetest flower of all the isle,      The bride who seemed but yesternight      Love's fair embodied smile.      And, clinging to her trembling knee,      Looked up the form of infancy,      With tearful glance in either face      The secret of its fear to trace.       \"Ha! stand or die!\" The white man's eye      His steady musket gleamed along,      As a tall Negro hastened nigh,      With fearless step and strong.      \"What, ho, Toussaint!\" A moment more,      His shadow crossed the lighted floor.      \"Away!\" he shouted; \"fly with me,      The white man's bark is on the sea;      Her sails must catch the seaward wind,      For sudden vengeance sweeps behind.      Our brethren from their graves have spoken,      The yoke is spurned, the chain is broken;      On all the bills our fires are glowing,      Through all the vales red blood is flowing      No more the mocking White shall rest      His foot upon the Negro's breast;      No more, at morn or eve, shall drip      The warm blood from the driver's whip      Yet, though Toussaint has vengeance sworn      For all the wrongs his race have borne,      Though for each drop of Negro blood      The white man's veins shall pour a flood;      Not all alone the sense of ill      Around his heart is lingering still,      Nor deeper can the white man feel      The generous warmth of grateful zeal.      Friends of the Negro! fly with me,      The path is open to the sea:      Away, for life!\" He spoke, and pressed      The young child to his manly breast,      As, headlong, through the cracking cane,      Down swept the dark insurgent train,      Drunken and grim, with shout and yell      Howled through the dark, like sounds from hell.       Far out, in peace, the white man's sail      Swayed free before the sunrise gale.      Cloud-like that island hung afar,      Along the bright horizon's verge,      O'er which the curse of servile war      Rolled its red torrent, surge on surge;      And he, the Negro champion, where      In the fierce tumult struggled he?      Go trace him by the fiery glare      Of dwellings in the midnight air,      The yells of triumph and despair,      The streams that crimson to the sea!       Sleep calmly in thy dungeon-tomb,      Beneath Besancon's alien sky,      Dark Haytien! for the time shall come,      Yea, even now is nigh,      When, everywhere, thy name shall be      Redeemed from color's infamy;      And men shall learn to speak of thee      As one of earth's great spirits, born      In servitude, and nursed in scorn,      Casting aside the weary weight      And fetters of its low estate,      In that strong majesty of soul      Which knows no color, tongue, or clime,      Which still hath spurned the base control      Of tyrants through all time!      Far other hands than mine may wreathe      The laurel round thy brow of death,      And speak thy praise, as one whose word      A thousand fiery spirits stirred,      Who crushed his foeman as a worm,      Whose step on human hearts fell firm:       Be mine the better task to find      A tribute for thy lofty mind,      Amidst whose gloomy vengeance shone      Some milder virtues all thine own,      Some gleams of feeling pure and warm,      Like sunshine on a sky of storm,      Proofs that the Negro's heart retains      Some nobleness amid its chains,--      That kindness to the wronged is never      Without its excellent reward,      Holy to human-kind and ever      Acceptable to God.       1833.     THE SLAVE-SHIPS.       \"That fatal, that perfidious bark,      Built I' the eclipse, and rigged with curses dark.\"                                MILTON'S Lycidas.  \"The French ship Le Rodeur, with a crew of twenty-two men, and with one hundred and sixty negro slaves, sailed from Bonny, in Africa, April, 1819. On approaching the line, a terrible malady broke out,--an obstinate disease of the eyes,--contagious, and altogether beyond the resources of medicine. It was aggravated by the scarcity of water among the slaves (only half a wine-glass per day being allowed to an individual), and by the extreme impurity of the air in which they breathed. By the advice of the physician, they were brought upon deck occasionally; but some of the poor wretches, locking themselves in each other's arms, leaped overboard, in the hope, which so universally prevails among them, of being swiftly transported to their own homes in Africa. To check this, the captain ordered several who were stopped in the attempt to be shot, or hanged, before their companions. The disease extended to the crew; and one after another were smitten with it, until only one remained unaffected. Yet even this dreadful condition did not preclude calculation: to save the expense of supporting slaves rendered unsalable, and to obtain grounds for a claim against the underwriters, thirty-six of the negroes, having become blind, were thrown into the sea and drowned!\" Speech of M. Benjamin Constant, in the French Chamber of Deputies, June 17, 1820.  In the midst of their dreadful fears lest the solitary individual, whose sight remained unaffected, should also be seized with the malady, a sail was discovered. It was the Spanish slaver, Leon. The same disease had been there; and, horrible to tell, all the crew had become blind! Unable to assist each other, the vessels parted. The Spanish ship has never since been heard of. The Rodeur reached Guadaloupe on the 21st of June; the only man who had escaped the disease, and had thus been enabled to steer the slaver into port, caught it in three days after its arrival.-- Bibliotheque Ophthalmologique for November, 1819.       \"ALL ready?\" cried the captain;      \"Ay, ay!\" the seamen said;      \"Heave up the worthless lubbers,--      The dying and the dead.\"      Up from the slave-ship's prison      Fierce, bearded heads were thrust:      \"Now let the sharks look to it,--      Toss up the dead ones first!\"       Corpse after corpse came up,      Death had been busy there;      Where every blow is mercy,      Why should the spoiler spare?      Corpse after corpse they cast      Sullenly from the ship,      Yet bloody with the traces      Of fetter-link and whip.       Gloomily stood the captain,      With his arms upon his breast,      With his cold brow sternly knotted,      And his iron lip compressed.       \"Are all the dead "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9580"],["title","Anti-Slavery Poems and Songs of Labor and Reform, Complete (#2)"],["body","over?\"      Growled through that matted lip;      \"The blind ones are no better,      Let's lighten the good ship.\"       Hark! from the ship's dark bosom,      The very sounds of hell!      The ringing clank of iron,      The maniac's short, sharp yell!      The hoarse, low curse, throat-stifled;      The starving infant's moan,      The horror of a breaking heart      Poured through a mother's groan.       Up from that loathsome prison      The stricken blind ones cane      Below, had all been darkness,      Above, was still the same.      Yet the holy breath of heaven      Was sweetly breathing there,      And the heated brow of fever      Cooled in the soft sea air.       \"Overboard with them, shipmates!\"      Cutlass and dirk were plied;      Fettered and blind, one after one,      Plunged down the vessel's side.      The sabre smote above,      Beneath, the lean shark lay,      Waiting with wide and bloody jaw      His quick and human prey.       God of the earth! what cries      Rang upward unto thee?      Voices of agony and blood,      From ship-deck and from sea.      The last dull plunge was heard,      The last wave caught its stain,      And the unsated shark looked up      For human hearts in vain.          . . . . . . . . . . . .       Red glowed the western waters,      The setting sun was there,      Scattering alike on wave and cloud      His fiery mesh of hair.      Amidst a group in blindness,      A solitary eye      Gazed, from the burdened slaver's deck,      Into that burning sky.       \"A storm,\" spoke out the gazer,      \"Is gathering and at hand;      Curse on 't, I'd give my other eye      For one firm rood of land.\"      And then he laughed, but only      His echoed laugh replied,      For the blinded and the suffering      Alone were at his side.       Night settled on the waters,      And on a stormy heaven,      While fiercely on that lone ship's track      The thunder-gust was driven.      \"A sail!--thank God, a sail!\"      And as the helmsman spoke,      Up through the stormy murmur      A shout of gladness broke.        Down came the stranger vessel,      Unheeding on her way,      So near that on the slaver's deck      Fell off her driven spray.      \"Ho! for the love of mercy,      We're perishing and blind!\"      A wail of utter agony      Came back upon the wind.       \"Help us! for we are stricken      With blindness every one;      Ten days we've floated fearfully,      Unnoting star or sun.      Our ship 's the slaver Leon,--      We've but a score on board;      Our slaves are all gone over,--      Help, for the love of God!\"       On livid brows of agony      The broad red lightning shone;      But the roar of wind and thunder      Stifled the answering groan;      Wailed from the broken waters      A last despairing cry,      As, kindling in the stormy' light,      The stranger ship went by.              . . . . . . . . .       In the sunny Guadaloupe      A dark-hulled vessel lay,      With a crew who noted never      The nightfall or the day.      The blossom of the orange      Was white by every stream,      And tropic leaf, and flower, and bird      Were in the warns sunbeam.       And the sky was bright as ever,      And the moonlight slept as well,      On the palm-trees by the hillside,      And the streamlet of the dell:      And the glances of the Creole      Were still as archly deep,      And her smiles as full as ever      Of passion and of sleep.       But vain were bird and blossom,      The green earth and the sky,      And the smile of human faces,      To the slaver's darkened eye;      At the breaking of the morning,      At the star-lit evening time,      O'er a world of light and beauty      Fell the blackness of his crime.       1834.     EXPOSTULATION.  Dr. Charles Follen, a German patriot, who had come to America for the freedom which was denied him in his native land, allied himself with the abolitionists, and at a convention of delegates from all the anti- slavery organizations in New England, held at Boston in May, 1834, was chairman of a committee to prepare an address to the people of New England. Toward the close of the address occurred the passage which suggested these lines. \"The despotism which our fathers could not bear in their native country is expiring, and the sword of justice in her reformed hands has applied its exterminating edge to slavery. Shall the United States--the free United States, which could not bear the bonds of a king--cradle the bondage which a king is abolishing? Shall a Republic be less free than a Monarchy? Shall we, in the vigor and buoyancy of our manhood, be less energetic in righteousness than a kingdom in its age?\" --Dr. Follen's Address.  \"Genius of America!--Spirit of our free institutions!--where art thou? How art thou fallen, O Lucifer! son of the morning,--how art thou fallen from Heaven! Hell from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming! The kings of the earth cry out to thee, Aha! Aha! Art thou become like unto us?\"--Speech of Samuel J. May.       OUR fellow-countrymen in chains!      Slaves, in a land of light and law!      Slaves, crouching on the very plains      Where rolled the storm of Freedom's war!      A groan from Eutaw's haunted wood,      A. wail where Camden's martyrs fell,      By every shrine of patriot blood,      From Moultrie's wall and Jasper's well!       By storied hill and hallowed grot,      By mossy wood and marshy glen,      Whence rang of old the rifle-shot,      And hurrying shout of Marion's men!      The groan of breaking hearts is there,      The falling lash, the fetter's clank!      Slaves, slaves are breathing in that air      Which old De Kalb and Sumter drank!       What, ho! our countrymen in chains!      The whip on woman's shrinking flesh!      Our soil yet reddening with the stains      Caught from her scourging, warm and fresh!      What! mothers from their children riven!      What! God's own image bought and sold!      Americans to market driven,      And bartered as the brute for gold!       Speak! shall their agony of prayer      Come thrilling to our hearts in vain?      To us whose fathers scorned to bear      The paltry menace of a chain;      To us, whose boast is loud and long      Of holy Liberty and Light;      Say, shall these writhing slaves of Wrong      Plead vainly for their plundered Right?       What! shall we send, with lavish breath,      Our sympathies across the wave,      Where Manhood, on the field of death,      Strikes for his freedom or a grave?      Shall prayers go up, and hymns be sung      For Greece, the Moslem fetter spurning,      And millions hail with pen and tongue      Our light on all her altars burning?       Shall Belgium feel, and gallant France,      By Vendome's pile and Schoenbrun's wall,      And Poland, gasping on her lance,      The impulse of our cheering call?      And shall the slave, beneath our eye,      Clank o'er our fields his hateful chain?      And toss his fettered arms on high,      And groan for Freedom's gift, in vain?       Oh, say, shall Prussia's banner be      A refuge for the stricken slave?      And shall the Russian serf go free      By Baikal's lake and Neva's wave?      And shall the wintry-bosomed Dane      Relax the iron hand of pride,      And bid his bondmen cast the chain      From fettered soul and limb aside?       Shall every flap of England's flag      Proclaim that all around are free,      From farthest Ind to each blue crag      That beetles o'er the Western Sea?      And shall we scoff at Europe's kings,      When Freedom's fire is dim with us,      And round our country's altar clings      The damning shade of Slavery's curse?       Go, let us ask of Constantine      To loose his grasp on Poland's throat;      And beg the lord of Mahmoud's line      To spare the struggling Suliote;      Will not the scorching answer come      From turbaned Turk, and scornful Russ      \"Go, loose your fettered slaves at home,      Then turn, and ask the like of us!\"       Just God! and shall we calmly rest,      The Christian's scorn, the heathen's mirth,      Content to live the lingering jest      And by-word of a mocking Earth?      Shall our own glorious land retain      That curse which Europe scorns to bear?      Shall our own brethren drag the chain      Which not even Russia's menials wear?       Up, then, in Freedom's manly part,      From graybeard eld to fiery youth,      And on the nation's naked heart      Scatter the living coals of Truth!      Up! while ye slumber, deeper yet      The shadow of our fame is growing!      Up! while ye pause, our sun may set      In blood, around our altars flowing!       Oh! rouse ye, ere the storm comes forth,      The gathered wrath of God and man,      Like that which wasted Egypt's earth,      When hail and fire above it ran.      Hear ye no warnings in the air?      Feel ye no earthquake underneath?      Up, up! why will ye slumber where      The sleeper only wakes in death?       Rise now for Freedom! not in strife      Like that your sterner fathers saw,      The awful waste of human life,      The glory and the guilt of war:'      But break the chain, the yoke remove,      And smite to earth Oppression's rod,      With those mild arms of Truth and Love,      Made mighty through the living God!       Down let the shrine of Moloch sink,      And leave no traces where it stood;      Nor longer let its idol drink      His daily cup of human blood;      But rear another altar there,      To Truth and Love and Mercy given,      And Freedom's gift, and Freedom's prayer,      Shall call an answer down from Heaven!       1834     HYMN.  Written for the meeting of the Anti-Slavery Society, at Chatham Street Chapel, New York, held on the 4th of the seventh month, 1834.        O THOU, whose presence went before      Our fathers in their weary way,      As with Thy chosen moved of yore      The fire by night, the cloud by day!       "]]]
