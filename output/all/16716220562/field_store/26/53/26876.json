Unlike people nowadays the Greeks did not spend much   money on their dwelling-houses. To us these houses would seem small,   badly ventilated, and very uncomfortable. But what their houses lacked   was more than made up by the beauty and splendor of the public   buildings, halls, theaters, porticoes, and especially the temples.  TEMPLES. The temples were not intended to hold hundreds of worshipers   like the large churches of Europe and America to-day. Religious   ceremonies were most often carried on in the open air. The Parthenon,   the most famous temple of Ancient Times, was small. Its principal room   measured less than one hundred feet in length. Part of this room was   used for an altar and for the ivory and gold statue of the goddess   Athena.    [Illustration: THE ACROPOLIS AT ATHENS AS IT IS TO-DAY]  THE PARTHENON. In a picture of the Parthenon, or of a similar temple,   we notice the columns in front and along the sides. The Parthenon had   eight at each end and seventeen on each side. They were thirty-four   feet high. A few feet within the columns on the sides was the wall of   the temple. Before the vestibule and entrances at the front and at the   rear stood six more columns. The beauty of the marble from which   stones and columns were cut might have seemed enough, but the builders   carved groups of figures in the three-cornered space (called the   pediment) in front between the roof and the stones resting upon the   columns. The upper rows of stones beneath the roof and above the   columns were also carved, and continuous carvings (called a frieze)   ran around the top of the temple wall on the outside. The temple was   not left a glistening white, but parts of it were painted in blue, or   red, or gilt, or orange.    [Illustration: THE TOP OF THE ACROPOLIS 2000 YEARS AGO The   Parthenon is the large temple on the right]  OTHER GREEK TEMPLES. This beautiful temple is now partly ruined. Ruins   of other temples are on the Acropolis, and one better preserved,   called the Theseum, stands on a lower hill. There are also similar   ruins in many places along the shores of the Mediterranean. The most   interesting are at Paestum in Italy, and at Girgenti in Sicily. Long   before these temples were ruined they had taught the Romans how to   construct one of the most beautiful kinds of buildings, and this the   Romans later taught the peoples of western Europe.  GREEK METHODS OF BUILDING STILL USED. If we look at our large   buildings, we shall see much to remind us of the Greek buildings.   Sometimes the exact form of the Greek building is imitated; sometimes   this form is changed as the Romans changed it, or as it was changed by   builders who lived after the time of the Romans. If the model of the   whole building is not used, there are similar pillars, or gables, or   the sculpture in the pediment and the frieze is imitated. The Greeks   had three kinds of pillars, named Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. The   Doric is simple and solid, the Ionic shows in its capital, or top,   delicate and beautiful curves, while the Corinthian is adorned with   leaves springing gracefully from the top of the pillar.    [Illustration: Doric Ionic Corinthian GREEK ORDERS OF   ARCHITECTURE]    [Illustration: RUINS OF THE GREEK THEATER AT EPIDAURUS]  THEATERS. The first Greek theater was only a smooth open space near a   hillside, with a tent, called a _sken√©_, or scene, in which the   actors dressed. Later an amphitheater of stone seats was constructed   on the hillside, and across the open end was placed the _scene_,   which had been changed into a stone building. On its front sometimes a   house or a palace was painted, just as nowadays theaters are furnished   with painted scenery. In these open-air theaters thousands of people   gathered. Plays were generally given as a part of religious festivals,   and there were contests between writers to see which could produce the   best play. Sometimes the plays followed one another for three days   from morning until night. Many of them are so interesting that people   still read them, after twenty-five hundred years. The Romans studied   them, and so do modern men who are preparing themselves to write   plays.    [Illustration: THE MODERN STADIUM AT ATHENS]  THE STADIUM. A building which somewhat resembled the theater was the   stadium, where races were run. The difference was that it was oblong   instead of half round. The most famous stadium, at Olympia, was seven   hundred and two feet long, with raised seats on both sides and around   one end of the running track. The other end was open. About fifty   thousand persons used to gather there to watch the races.  PORTICOES. There were other buildings, some for meeting places, some   for gymnasiums, and still others called porticoes, where the judges   held court or the city officers carried on their business. The   porticoes were simply rows of columns, roofed over, with occasionally   a second story. As they stretched along the sides of a square or   market place they added much to the beauty of a city.  GREEK SCULPTURE. We know that the Greeks were skilful sculptors   because from the ruins of their cities have been dug wonderful marble   and bronze statues which are now preserved in the great museums of the   world, in Paris, London, Berlin, and Rome, and here in America, in New   York and Boston. Museums which cannot have the original statues   usually contain copies or casts of them in plaster. The statues are   generally marred and broken, but enough remains to show us the   wonderful beauty of the artist's work. Among the most famous are the   Venus, of Melos (or \"de Milo\"), which stands in a special room in a   museum called the Louvre in Paris; the Hermes in the museum of Olympia   in Greece; and the figures from the Parthenon in the British Museum in   London.    [Illustration: THE DISCUS-THROWER (DISCOBOLOS) An ancient   Greek statue now in the Vatican]    Artists nowadays, like the Roman artists long ago, study the Greek   statues and the Greek sculpture, in order that they may learn how such   beautiful things can be made. They do not hope to excel the Greeks,   but are content to remain their pupils.  PAINTING AND POTTERY. The Greeks were also painters, makers of   pottery, and workers in gold and silver. Many pieces of their   workmanship have been discovered by those who have dug in the ruins of   ancient buildings and tombs.    [Illustration: A GREEK BOOK The upper picture, shows the book   open.]  WHAT THE BOYS WERE TAUGHT. The Greek boys were not very good at   arithmetic, and even grown men used counting boards or their fingers   to help them in reckoning. In learning to write they smeared a thin   layer of wax over a board and marked on that. There was a kind of   paper called papyrus, made from a reed which grew mostly in Egypt, but   this was expensive. Rolls were made of sheets of it pasted together,   and these were their books. One of the books the boys studied much was   the poems of Homer--the Iliad and the Odyssey--which tell about the   siege of Troy and the wanderings of Ulysses. Boys often learned these   long poems by heart. They also stored away in their memories the   sayings of other poets and wise men, so that they could generally know   what to think, having with them so many good and wise thoughts put in   such excellent words.  GAMES AND EXERCISES FOR BOYS. It is not surprising that Greek boys   knew how to play, but it is surprising that they played many of the   games which boys play now, such as hide-and-seek, tug of war, ducks   and drakes, and blind man's buff. They even \"pitched pennies.\" In   school the boys were taught not only to read and write, but to be   skilful athletes, and to play on the lyre, accompanying this with   singing. The gymnasium was often an open space near a stream into   which they could plunge after their exercises were over. They were   taught to box, to wrestle, to throw the discus, and to hurl the spear.   Military training was important for them, since all might be called to   fight for the safety of their city.  THE OLYMPIC GAMES. Boys and young men were trained as runners,   wrestlers, boxers, and discus throwers, not only because they enjoyed   these exercises and the Greeks thought them an important part of   education, but also that they might bring back honors and prizes to   their city from the great games which all the Greeks held every few   years. The most famous of these games were held at Olympia. There the   Greeks went from all parts of the country, carrying their tents and   cooking utensils with them, because there were not enough houses in   Olympia to hold so many people. Wars even were stopped for a time in   order that the games might not be postponed.  THE REWARDS OF THE VICTORS. The principal contest was a dash for two   hundred yards, although there were longer races and many other kinds   of contests. Unfortunately the Greeks liked to see the most brutal   sort of boxing, in which the boxer's hands and arms were covered with   heavy strips of leather stiffened with pieces of iron or lead. For the   games men trained ten months, part of the time at Olympia. The prize   was a crown of wild olive, and the winner returned in triumph to his   city, where poets sang his praises, a special seat at public games was   reserved for him, and often artists were employed to make a bronze   statue of him to be set up in Olympia or in his own city.    [Illustration: GREEK GAMES--RUNNING From an antique vase]  THE GOVERNMENT OF ATHENS. The citizen of Athens, and of other Greek   cities, had more to do with his government than do most Americans with   theirs. As nearly all work was done by slaves, he had plenty of time   to attend meetings. All the citizens could attend the great assembly,   or _ecclesia_, where six thousand at least must be present before   anything could be decided. By this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9897"],["title","Introductory American History (#4)"],["body","foreigners might be   admitted to citizenship or citizens might be expelled, or ostracized,   from Athens as hurtful to its welfare.    There was a smaller council of five hundred which decided less   important questions without laying them before the general assembly.   This body was chosen by lot just as our juries are, but members of the   council whose term had ended had a right to object to any new member   as an unworthy citizen A tenth of the council ruled for a tenth of the   year, and they chose their president by lot every day, so that any   worthy man at Athens had a chance to be president for a day and a   night.    [Illustration: A DECREE OF THE COUNCIL--ABOUT 450 B.C.]    Many citizens also served in the courts, for there were six thousand   judges, and in deciding important cases as many as a thousand and one,   or even fifteen hundred and one, took part. Before such large courts   and assemblies it was necessary to be a good speaker to be able to win   a case or persuade the citizens. Some of the greatest orators of the   world were Athenians, the best known being Demosthenes.  SOCRATES. The Athenians were not always just, although so many of them   acted as judges. One court, composed of five hundred and one judges,   condemned to death Socrates, the wisest man of the Greeks and one of   the wisest in the world. He did not make speeches, or write books, or   teach in school. He went about, in the market place, at the gymnasium,   and on the streets, asking men, young and old, questions about what   interested him most, that is, What is the true way to live? If people   did not give him an answer which seemed good, he asked more questions,   until sometimes they went away angry. Many of them thought because he   asked questions about everything that he did not believe in anything,   not even in the religion of his city.    [Illustration: SOCRATES After the marble bust in the Vatican]  THE DEATH OF SOCRATES, 399 B.C. After a while the enemies of Socrates   accused him of being a wicked man who persuaded young men to be   wicked. He was tried by an Athenian court, which made the terrible   blunder of finding him guilty and condemning him to death. According   to the Athenian custom he was obliged to drink a cup of poisonous   hemlock. This he did, after talking to his friends cheerily about how   a good man should live. As he wrote no books we have learned about him   from his friends. The most famous of these was Plato, who is also   counted among the wisest men that ever lived. The story of the lives   of these men is another gift which the Greeks made to all who were to   live after them, and it is quite as valuable as are the ways of   building, artistic skill, or great poems and plays.

CHAPTER IV   GREEK EMIGRANTS OR COLONISTS  WHEN THE ATLANTIC WAS UNKNOWN. One of the most important things   done by the men of Ancient Times was to explore the coasts and lands of   Europe and to make settlements wherever they went. At first they knew   little of the western and northern parts of Europe. Herodotus, a Greek   whom we call the \"Father of History,\" and who was a great traveler,   said, \"Though I have taken vast pains, I have never been able to get an   assurance from any eye-witness that there is any sea on the further side   of Europe.\" By the \"further side\" he meant \"western,\" and his remark   shows that he did not know of the Atlantic Ocean. He understood that tin   and amber came from the \"Tin Islands,\" which he called the \"ends of the   earth.\" As tin came from England, it is plain that he had heard a little   of that island.    [Illustration: MAP OF THE WORLD AS DESCRIBED BY THE GREEK   HISTORIAN HERODOTUS]  GREEK EMIGRANTS. Long before Athens became a great and beautiful   city the Greeks had begun to make settlements on distant shores. Those   who lived on the western coast of Asia Minor, as well as those who lived   where the kingdom of Greece is now, sent out colonists or emigrants. The   Greek colonies were very important, because by them the ancient   civilized world was made larger, just as by the settlement of America   the modern world was doubled in size. The colonists sailed away from   home for the same reasons which led our forefathers to leave England and   Europe for America. They either hoped to find it easier in a new land to   make a living and obtain property, or they did not like the way their   city was ruled, and being unable to change this, resolved to build   elsewhere a city which they could manage as they pleased.  HOW THEY LOCATED A NEW CITY. There were several different lands to   which they could go, just as the European of to-day may sail for the   United States or South America or Australia. They could attempt to   settle on the shores of the Black Sea, or cross over to northern Africa,   or try to reach Italy and the more distant coasts of what are now France   and Spain. In order to choose wisely, they generally asked the advice of   the priests of their god Apollo at his temple at Delphi. These priests   knew more about good places for settlements than most other persons,   because travelers from everywhere came to Delphi and the priests were   wise enough to inquire about all parts of the world.    [Illustration: _The territory occupied by the Greeks is   indicated by solid black_]    The story is told that one group of emigrants was advised to locate   their new colony opposite the \"city of the blind.\" They discovered that   these words meant that an earlier band of emigrants had passed by the   wonderful harbor of the present city of Constantinople and had settled   instead on the other shore of the Bosphorus. Taught by the oracle they   chose the better place and began to build the city of Byzantium, which   later became Constantinople.  MOTHER AND DAUGHTER CITIES. Solemn ceremonies took place when   colonists departed. They carried with them fire from the hearth of the   mother city in order to light a similar fire on their new hearth, for   every city had its hearthstone and on it a fire that was never quenched.   The ties between the mother and the daughter city were close, and the   enemies of one were the enemies of the other. He who wished to visit the   colony usually went to the mother city to find a ship bound thither.  WHERE THE SETTLEMENTS WERE MADE. When the Greek sailors first   entered the Black Sea, they thought it a boundless ocean, and called it   the Pontus, a word which means \"The Main.\" Until that time they had been   accustomed to sail only from island to island in the Aegean Sea. After a   while they made settlements all around the shores of the Black Sea, and   in later times Athens drew from this region her supply of grain. Still   more important settlements were made in Sicily and southern Italy, for   it was through these settlements that some of the things the Greeks   knew, like the art of writing, were taught to the Italian tribes and to   the Romans.  DANGERS OF THE VOYAGE. At first Greek sailors feared the dangers of the   western Mediterranean as much as those of the Black Sea. They imagined   that the huge, misshapen, and dreadful monsters Scylla and Charybdis   lurked in the Straits of Messina waiting to seize and swallow the   unlucky passer-by. On the slopes of Mount Aetna dwelt, they thought,   hideous, one-eyed giants, the Cyclops, who fed their fierce appetites   with the quivering flesh of many captives.    [Illustration: GREEK RUINS AT PAESTUM IN ITALY]  GREEKS IN THE WEST. The earliest settlement of the Greeks in Italy   was at Cumae, on a headland at the entrance of the Bay of Naples. Later   these colonists entered the bay and founded the \"new city,\" or Neapolis,   which we call Naples. Finally there were so many Greek cities in   southern Italy that it was named \"Great Greece.\" The Greeks also made   settlements in what is now southern France and eastern Spain. The   principal one was Massilia, or Marseilles. Through the traders of this   city the ancient world obtained a supply of tin from Britain, a country   which is now called England.  GREEK COLONIES AS CENTERS OF CIVILIZATION. The Greeks in these   colonies traded with the natives whose villages were near by, and many   of the natives learned to live like the Greeks. In this way the Greeks   became teachers of civilization, and the Greek world, which at first was   made up of cities on the shores of the Aegean Sea, was spread from place   to place along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea.
