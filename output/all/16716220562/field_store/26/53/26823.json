My captive was the most daring Union scout between Vicksburg and New Orleans; these very Harpers knew that. The thing unknown to us was that already his fate was entangled with Ned Ferry's and Charlotte Oliver's, as yet more it would be, with theirs and ours, in days close at hand.    XI   CAPTAIN JEWETT  Once more we were in the by-road which had brought us westward parallel with the highway. The prisoner drove. Aunt Martha sat beside him, slim, dark, black-eyed, stately, her silver-gray hair rolled high à la Pompadour. With a magnanimity rare in those bitter days she incited him to talk, first of New Orleans, where he had spent a month in camp on one of the public squares, and then of his far northern home, and of loved ones there, mother, wife and child. The nieces, too, gave a generous attention. Only I, riding beside the hind wheels, held solemnly aloof.  \"Front!\" I once snapped out with a ring that made the trees reply and the ladies catch their breath. \"If you steal one more look back here I'll put a ball into your leg.\"  He smiled, chirped the horses up and resumed his chat. I heard him praise my horse and compare him not unfavorably with his own which he had lost that morning'. He and a few picked men had been surprised in a farmhouse at breakfast. They had made a leap and a dash, he said, but one horse and rider falling dead, his horse, unhurt, had tumbled over them, and here was his rider.  I prompted Camille to ask if he had ever encountered Ned Ferry, and he laughed.  \"No,\" he said, but Ned Ferry had lately restored to him, by proxy, some lost letters, with an invitation to _come and see him_.  I laughed insolently. The young ladies sparkled, and so did Miss Harper, as she asked him who had been the proxy.  He said the proxy was a young woman who had a knack of getting passes through the lines, and the three girls exchanged looks as knowing as they were delighted.  \"I tell her as a friend,\" he said, \"she'll get one into Fortress Monroe yet!\"  Miss Harper's keen eyes glittered. \"You northerners hardly realize our feelings concerning the imprisonment of women, I think.\"  \"My dear madam, you don't realize ours. We don't want to imprison women.\"  So there came a silence, and then a gay laugh as three of us at once asked if he had ever heard of Lieutenant Durand. \"Durand!\" he cried, and looked squarely around at me. I lifted the cocked revolver, but he kept his fine eyes on mine and I rubbed my ear with my wrist. \"What?\" he said, \"an elegant, Creole-seeming young fellow, very handsome? Why, that fellow saved my life this very afternoon.\"  The young ladies were in rapture. Miss Harper asked how he had done it.  \"If I tell you that,\" said the Captain, \"you won't like me the least bit.\"  Whereat Cécile replied, \"Ah--well! we cou'n' like you the leaz bit any-'ow.\"  \"I suppose that's so,\" laughed the officer. \"I'll tell you how it was. My guard were just about to hang me for saying I thought we had a right to make soldiers of the darkies, when your friend came galloping along, saw the thing, and rushed in and cut the halter with his sword. And when they demanded to know who and what he was, he told them Durand, and that they'd hear it again, for he should report them.\"  \"Oh, sir,\" cried Estelle, whose eyes, brows, lashes and hair were all of the same luminous red-brown, and in whose cheeks the rose seemed always to burn through the olive, \"how can you and your people seek to kill such men as that?\"  \"Such as which?\" asked the Yankee, with a twinkle. \"There were two kinds.\"  \"But, o-oh! sir!\" exclaimed the trio, when Miss Harper waved them to forbear. There was yet some daylight left as we trundled into a broad highroad and turned northward. We passed a picket guard and then a whole regiment of cavalry going into camp. They scrambled to the sides of the road and stormed us with questions, chaffing us cruelly when I remained silent. \"Lawd! look a' this-yeh Yank a-bringin' in ow desertehs!\" \"Hey, you big Yank, you jest let that po' little conscrip' go!\"  Headquarters, we heard from a courier who said he was the third sent out to find us, were at the \"Sessions house\" two miles further on. We sent him galloping back there, and after a while here came Major Harper and three or four others of the staff, including Harry Helm. What a flood of mirthful compliment there was at sight of us and our captive; Harry was positively silly. In the series of introductions that followed he was left paired with Camille, and I said things to myself. Major Harper rode by the prisoner. \"Well, Captain,\" he said, \"you've had some experiences since you left me this morning. Don't you want to give us your parole this time, temporarily, for an hour or so, and be more comfortable?\"  \"Thank you, Major,\" the Federal affably replied, \"that would be a great relief to this most extraordinary youngster that I've brought with me.\" He gave it and we turned into a lofty grove whitened with our headquarters tents.  \"Smith,\" said the Major, \"your part is done, and well done. You needn't report to me again to-night; the General wishes to see you a moment. Captain, will you go with this young man to General Austin's tent?\"    XII   IN THE GENERAL'S TENT  I went to Gholson. He told me I was relieved of my captive and bade me go care for my horse and return in half an hour. In going I passed close by the Sessions plantation house. Every door and window was thrown wide to the night air, and preparations were in progress for a dance; and as I returned, a slave boy ran across my path, toward the house, bearing a flaming pine torch and followed by two ambulances filled with daughters of the neighborhood in clouds of white gauze. I found the General in fatigue dress. His new finery hung on the tent-pole at his back. Old Dismukes, the bull-necked colonel of the Arkansans, lounged on a camp-cot. Both smoked cigars.  The General asked me a number of idle questions and then said my prisoner had called me a good soldier. Old Dismukes smiled so broadly that I grew hot, believing the Yankee had told them of my tears.  \"Smith,\" said the Colonel, and then smoked and smiled again till my brow beaded,--\"tired?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"That's a lie,\" he pleasantly remarked, and lay back, enjoying my silent wrath. \"Send him, General,\" he added, \"he's your man.\"  The General looked at me between puffs of his cigar. \"I hear you've ridden over fifty miles to-day.\"  \"Yes, General.\" \"If I give you a good fresh horse can you go twenty-three miles more by midnight?\"  \"Yes, General, if I don't have to save the horse.\"  \"The horse may have to save you,\" drawled the Arkansan.  \"I think you know Lieutenant Durand?\" asked the General, with a quizzical eye.  \"Slightly.\"  \"Well, Smith, on his suggestion approved by Major Harper, I have detailed another clerk to the Major.\"  Rills of perspiration tickled my back like flies. \"Can't one man do the work?\"  \"Yes, the new man is detailed in your place.\"  I almost leaped from the ground in consternation. My whole frame throbbed, my mouth fell open, my tongue was tied.  The man who had got me into this thing--this barrel--lifted the tent-flap. \"Mr. Gholson,\" said the General, \"write an order assigning Smith to Ferry's scouts.\"  The flap fell again and my panic was turned into a joy qualified only by a reduced esteem for my general as a judge of character.  Old Dismukes rose. \"Good-night. Shall I send this boy that Yankee's horse?\"  \"Oh I was forgetting that; yes, do!\"  At the door the Colonel gave me a last look. \"Good-night, Legs.\"  I dared not retort, but I looked so hard at his paunch that the General smiled. Then he asked me if I knew where we were then camped, and I said we were on the Meadville and Fayette road, near Franklin, twenty miles southeast of Fayette and--  \"That will do. Now, beyond Fayette, about seven miles north, there's a place--\"  \"Clifton?\"  \"Don't interrupt me, Smith. Yes, Clifton. You're not to reach there to-night--\"  \"I can do it, General.\"  \"You can do as you're told; understand?\" I understood.  \"The enemy are in Fayette to-night,\" he continued. \"So when you get half-way to Fayette, just across Morgan's Creek, you'll take a dim fork on the right running north along the creek. Ever travel by the stars?\"  I began to tell how well I knew the stars, but he stopped me. \"Yes; well, keep straight north till you strike the road running east and west between Fayette and Union Church. You'll find there a little polling-place called Wiggins. Turn west, toward Fayette, and on the north side of the main road, opposite the blacksmith's shop, you'll come to a small--\"  \"I see.\"  \"What do you see?\" His frown scared me to my finger-tips.  \"Why, I suppose I'm to find there a road down Cole's Creek to Clifton.\"  \"Smith, if you interrupt me again, sir, you'll find the road back to your regiment. Opposite that blacksmith's shop you'll see a white cottage. There's a young lady stopping there to-night, a stranger, a traveller. The old lady who lives there has taken her in at my request. See that the young lady gets this envelope. It's no great matter, merely a pass through our lines; but it's your ostensible business till you get there; understand?\"  I thought I did until I glanced at the superscription: Miss Coralie Rothvelt.  \"Now, here is another matter of much more importance.\" He showed, but retained, another envelope. \"Behind the house where you're to find Miss Rothvelt there's a road into Cole's Creek bottom. The house you're to stop at to-night, say from twelve o'clock till three or half-past, is on that road, about five miles from Wiggins, from Clifton and from Fayette. I'm sending you there expecting the people in that house will rob you if you give them half a chance.\"  \"I understand, General; they'll not get it.\"  \"Smith, I want them to get it. I want them to rob you of this.\" He waggled the envelope. \"I want this to fall into the hands of the enemy; as it will if those people rob you of it.\"  I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9839"],["title","The Cavalier (#7)"],["body","my eyes. He smiled and then frowned. \"I don't want a clumsy job, now, mind! I don't want you to get captured if you can possibly avoid it; but all the same they mustn't get this so easily as to suspect it's a bait. So I want you to give those villains that half-chance to rob you, but not the other half, or they may--oh, it's no play! You must manage to have this despatch taken from you totally against your will! Then you must reach Clifton shortly after daylight. Ferry's scouts are there, and you'll say to Lieutenant Ferry the single word, Rodney. Understand?\" He pretended to be reconsidering. \"I--don't know but--after all--I'd better send one of my staff instead of you.\"  \"Oh, General, if you send an officer they'll see the ruse! I can do it! I'll do it all right!\"  \"I'm most afraid,\" he said, abstractedly, as he read my detail, which Gholson brought in. \"Here,\"--he handed it to me--\"and here, here's the despatch too.\"  \"What's the name, General, of the man whose house I'm to go to?\"  \"You'd best not know; I want you to seem to have stumbled upon the place. You can't miss it; there's no other house within two miles of it. Good-bye, my lad;\"--he gave me his hand;--\"good luck to you.\"  Gholson, in the Adjutant-general's tent, told me Ned Ferry had named me to the General as a first-class horseman and the most insignificant- looking person he knew of who was fit for this venture.  \"Ned Ferry! What does Ned Ferry know about my fitness?\"  \"Read the address on your despatch,\" said Gholson, resuming his pen.  I snatched the document from my bosom, into which I had thrust it to seize the General's hand \"Oh, Gholson!\" I said, in deep-toned grief, as I looked up from the superscription, \"is that honest!\"  He admitted that by the true religionist's standard it was not honest, but reminded me that Ned Ferry--in his blindness--was only a poor romanticist. The despatch was addressed to Lieutenant Edgard Ferry-Durand.  Major Harper's black boy brought me the Yankee's horse with my bridle and saddle on him; an elegant animal as fresh as a dawn breeze. Also he produced a parcel, my new uniform, and a wee note whose breath smelt of lavender as it said,--  \"Papa tells us you are being sent off on courier duty to-night. What a heart-breaking thing is war! How full of cruel sepa'--\"  That piece of a word was scored out and \"dangers\" written in its place. The missive ended all too soon, with the statement that I was requested to call, on my way out of camp, at the side gallery of the house-- Sessions's--and let the writer and her sister and her cousin and her father and her aunt see me in my new uniform and bid me good-bye.    XIII   GOOD-BYE, DICK  I found but one white figure under the dim veranda eaves. \"Miss Camille?\"  \"Wh'--who is that?\" responded a musical voice. \"Why, is that Mr. Smith?\" as if I were the last person in the world one should have expected to see there. The like of those moments I had never known. I saw her eyes note the perfect fit of my uniform, though neither of us mentioned it. I tried to tell her that Lieutenant Durand was Ned Ferry and that I was now one of his scouts, but she had already heard both facts, and would not tell me what her father had said about me, it was so good. Standing at the veranda's edge a trifle above me, with her cheek against one of the posts and her gaze on her slipper, she asked if I was glad I was going with Ned Ferry, and I had no more sense than to say I was; but she would neither say she was glad nor tell why she was not.  Through the open windows we could see the dancers. Now and then a pair of fanning promenaders came down the veranda, but on descrying us turned back. I said I was keeping her from the dance. To which she replied, drooping her head again, that she shouldn't dance that night.  \"Too tired?\"  \"No.\"  \"Too warm?\"  \"Oh, no, not too warm.\"  \"Why, then?\"  \"Oh--I--just don't feel as if I could, that's all.\"  My heart beat wildly and I wanted to ask if it was on my account; but I was too pusillanimous a coward, and when I feebly tried to look into her eyes she would not let me, which convinced me that she lacked candor. A dance ended. Gold-laced fellows came and sat on the veranda rail wiping wrists and brows with over-tasked handkerchiefs, and explaining the small mishaps of the floor. Two promenaders mentioned the hour. I gasped my amazement and extended my hand. \"Good-bye.\"  \"Wait a moment,\" she murmured, and watched the promenading pair turn back. Then she asked if I had read my mother's letter. I said I had. And then, very pensively, with head bent and eyes once more down, she inquired if I liked to get letters. Which led, quite accidentally, to my asking leave to write to her.  She replied that she did not mean that. Nevertheless, I insisted, would she? She only bent lower still. I asked the third time; and with nothing but the parting of her hair for me to look at, she nodded, and one of her braids fell over in front, and I took the pink-ribboned live end of it timorously between thumb and finger and felt as if I had hold of an electric battery.  She backed half a step, and quite needlessly I let it go. Then she bade me not forget I had promised her the words of a certain song. \"Want them? Indeed, yes! Did you not say it was an unpublished song written by a messmate of yours?--oh, Mr. Smith! I see why you stammer! You said 'a member of your mess'! oh!--oh!--oh!--you wrote it, yourself! And you wrote it to-day! That explains--\" She drew an awesome breath, rose to her toes and knit her knuckles under her throat.  I was in the sweetest consternation. With the end of her braid once more in my fingers I made her promise to keep the dark secret, and so recited them.  \"Maiden passing fair, turn away thine eyes!   Turn away thine eyes ere my bosom burn, Lit with foolish hope to hear thy fondling sighs,   Like yon twilight dove's, breathe, Return, return! Turn away thine eyes, maiden passing fair.   O maiden passing fair, turn away thine eyes!  \"Maiden passing fair, turn again thine eyes!   Turn again thine eyes, love's true mercy learn. Breathe, O! breathe to me, as these love-languid skies   To yon twilight star breathe, Return, return! Turn again thine eyes, maiden passing fair.   O maiden passing fair, turn again thine eyes!\"  \"Mis-ter Smith! you wrote that?--to-day! Wh'--who is she?\"  \"One too modest,\" I murmured, \"to know her own portrait.\" I clutched the braid emotionally and let it go intending to retake it; but she dropped it behind her and said I was too imaginative to be safe.  I stiffened proudly, turned and mounted my steed, but her eyes drew mine. I pressed close, bent over the saddle-bow, and said, \"Good-bye, Camille.\"  \"Good-bye.\" I could barely hear it.  \"Oh!--good-bye, just anybody?\" I asked; and thereupon she gathered up all her misplaced trust in me, all her maiden ignorance of what is in man, and all her sweet daring, to murmur--  \"Good-bye,--Dick.\"  I caught my breath in rapture and rode away. She was there yet when I looked back--once--and again--and again. And when I looked a last time still she had not moved. Oh, Camille, Camille! to this day I see you standing there in pink-edged white, pure, silent, motionless, a summer-evening cloud; while I, my body clad in its unstained--only because unused--new uniform, and my soul tricked out in the foolhardiness and vanity of a boy's innocence, rode forth into the night and into the talons of overmastering temptation.    XIV   CORALIE ROTHVELT  The night was still and sultry. At one of the many camp-fires on the edge of the road I saw the Arkansas colonel sitting cross-legged on the ground, in trousers, socks and undershirt, playing poker.  Out in the open country how sweet was the silence. Not yet have I forgotten one bright star of that night's sky. My mother and I had studied the stars together. Lately Camille, her letter said, had learned them with her. Now the heavens dropped meanings that were for me and for this night alone. While the form of the maiden--passing fair--yet glimmered in the firmament of my own mind, behind me in the south soared the Virgin; but as some trees screened the low glare of our camp I saw, just rising into view out of the southeast, the unmistakable eyes of the Scorpion. But these fanciful oracles only flattered my moral self-assurance, and I trust that will be remembered which I forgot, that I had not yet known the damsel from one sun to the next.  I was moving briskly along, making my good steed acquainted with me, testing his education, how promptly for instance, he would respond to rein-touch and to leg-pressure, when I saw, in front, coming toward me, three riders. Two of them were very genteel chaps, though a hand of each was on the lock of his carbine. The third was a woman, veiled, and clad in some dark stuff that in the starlight seemed quite black and contrasted strongly with the paleness of her horse. Her hat, in particular, fastened my attention; if that was not the same soft-brimmed Leghorn I had seen yesterday morning, at least it was its twin sister. I halted, revolver in hand, and said, as they drew rein,--\"Good-evening.\"  \"Good-evening,\" replied the nearer man. \"How far is it to camp--Austin's?\"  \"A short three miles.\"  \"To what command do you belong?\" he asked.  \"Ferry's scouts. What command is yours, gentlemen?\"  \"Ferry's scouts.\" He scrutinized me. \"What command do you say you--\"  \"Ferry's scouts,\" I repeated. \"F-e-r-r-y-apostrophe s, Ferry's--s-k-o-w-t-s--scouts.\"  The trio laughed, the young woman most musically.  \"How long have you belonged to Ferry's scouts?\" sceptically demanded their spokesman.  \"About an hour and a quarter.\"  \"Oh! that-a-way.\"  \"Yes,\" I replied, \"in that direction.\"  The three laughed again and the men sank their carbines across their laps, while in a voice as refined as her figure their companion said, \"Good-evening, Mr. Smith.\" She laid back her veil and even in the darkness I felt the witchery of her glance. \"I was"]]]
