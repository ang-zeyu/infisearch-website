I feared you might try to come around by Fayette, not knowing the Yankees are there. These gentlemen didn't know it.\" \"She just did save us!\" laughed the man hitherto silent.  \"I'm Miss Coralie Rothvelt,\" she added, and then how she sparkled in the dark as she said, \"I see you remember me.\"  \"I am but human.\"  \"And yet you never take a lady's name for granted?\"  \"I am to know Miss Rothvelt by finding her in a certain place.\" My honeyed bow implied that her being just now very much out of place was no fault of mine.  \"Nonsense!\" muttered both men, and I liked them the better.  \"My dear Smith,\" said Miss Rothvelt, \"keep your trust. But if I part here with these two kind gentlemen--\"  \"Who don't belong to Ferry's scouts at all,\" I still more sweetly added.  \"No,\" she laughed, \"and if I go back with you to Wiggins--to the little white cottage, you know, opposite the blacksmith's shop,--you'll give me what you've got for me, won't you?\" She dropped her head to one side and a mocking-bird chuckle rippled in her throat.  \"I shall count myself honored,\" said I, and we went, together and alone.    XV   VENUS AND MARS  Since those days men have made \"fire-proof\" buildings. You know them; let certain aggravations combine--they burn like straw. We had barely started when I began to be threatened with a conflagration against which I should have called it an insult to have been warned. The adroit beauty at my side set in to explain more fully her presence. From her window she had seen those two trim fellows hurrying along in a fair way to blunder into the Federal pickets within an hour, had cautioned them, and had finally asked leave to come with them, they under her guidance, she under their protection.  \"You were so anxious to get the General's letter?\" I asked.  \"I was so anxious about you,\" she replied, with feeling, and then broke into a quizzical laugh.  I had not the faintest doubt she was lying. What was I to her? The times were fearfully out of joint; women as well as men were taking war's licenses, and with a boy's unmerciful directness I sprang to the conclusion that here was an adventuress. Yet I had some better thoughts too. While I felt a moral tipsiness going into all my veins, I asked myself if it was not mainly due to my own inability to rise in full manliness to a most exceptional situation. Her jaunty method of confronting it, was I not failing to regard _that_ with due magnanimity? Was this the truth, or after all ought I really to see that at every turn of her speech, by coy bendings of the head, by the dark seductions of dim half-captive locks about her oval temples, and by many an indescribable swaying of the form and of the voice, I was being--to speak it brutally--challenged? Even in the poetic obscurity of the night I lost all steadiness of eye as I pertly said--  \"And so here you are in this awful fix.\"  \"I'm enjoying one advantage,\" she replied, \"which you do not.\"  \"What is that?\"  \"Why, I can read my safety in your face. You can't read anything in mine; you're afraid to look.\"  All I got by looking then was a mellow laugh from behind her relowered veil; but we were going at a swift trot, nearing a roadside fire of fence-rails left by some belated foraging team, and as she came into the glare of it I turned my eyes a second time. She was revealed in a garb of brown enriched by the red beams of the fire, and was on the gray mare I had seen that morning under Lieutenant Edgard Ferry-Durand.  \"You recognize her?\" the rider asked, delightedly. \"She's not stolen, she's only served her country a little better than usual to-day; haven't you, Cousin Sallie?\" (Cousin Sallie was short for Confederate States.)  The note of patriotism righted me and I looked a third time. The one art of dress worth knowing in '63 was to slight its fashions without offending them, and this pretty gift I had marked all day in the Harpers. But never have I seen it half so successful as in the veiled horsewoman illumined by the side-lights of those burning fence-rails. The white apparition at the veranda's edge gleamed in my mind, yet swiftly faded out, and a new fascination, more sudden than worthy heaved at my heart. Then the fire was behind us and we were in the deep night.  On the crest of a ridge we slackened speed and my fellow-traveller lifted her veil and asked exultantly what those two splendid stars were that overhung yonder fringe of woods so low and so close to each other. The less brilliant one, I said, the red one, was Mars.  \"And the one following, almost at his side?\"  \"Don't you know?\" I asked.  Her eyes flashed round upon me like stars themselves. \"Not--Venus?\" she whispered, snatched in her breath, bit her lip, and half averting her face, shot me through with both \"twinklers\" at once. Then she took a long look at the planets and suddenly exclaimed with a scandalized air--  \"They're going down into the woods together!\"  \"Yes,\" I responded, \"and without even waiting for Diana.\"  She dropped the rein and lifted both arms toward them. \"Oh, blessings on your glorious old heathen hearts, what do you want of Diana, or of any one in heaven or earth except each other!\"  Foolish, idle cry, and meant for no more, by a heart on fire with temptations of which I knew nothing. But then and there my poor adolescent soul found out that the preceptive stuff of which it had built its treasure-house and citadel was not fire-proof.    XVI   AN ACHING CONSCIENCE  Yet great is precept. Precept is a well. Up from its far depths by slow, humble, constant process you may draw, in a slender silver thread, and store for sudden use, the pure waters of character.  It has happened, however, that a man's own armor has been the death of him. So the moral isolation of a young prig of good red blood who is laudably trying to pump his conduct higher than his character--for that's the way he gets his character higher--has its own peculiar dangers. Take this example: that he does not dream any one will, or can, in mere frivolity, coquette, dally, play mud-pies, with a passion the sacredest in subjection, the shamefulest in mutiny, and the deepest and most perilous to tamper with, in our nature. As hotly alive in the nethermost cavern of his heart as in that of the vilest rogue there is a kennel of hounds to which one word of sophistry is as the call to the chase, and such a word I believed my companion had knowingly spoken. I was gone as wanton-tipsy as any low-flung fool, and actually fancied myself invited to be valiant by this transparent embodiment of passion whose outburst of amorous rebellion had been uttered not because I was there, but only in pure recklessness of my presence. Of course I ought to have seen that this was a soul only over-rich in woman's love; mettlesome, aspiring, but untrained to renunciation; consciously superior in mind and soul to the throng about her, and caught in some hideous gin of iron-bound--convention-bound--or even law-bound--foul play. But I was so besotted as to suggest a base analogy between us and those two sinking stars.  Unluckily she retorted with some playful parry that just lacked the saving quality of true resentment. How I rejoined would be small profit to tell. I had a fearful sense of falling; first like a wounded squirrel, dropping in fierce amazement, catching, holding on for a panting moment, then dropping, catching and dropping again, down from the top of the great tree where I had so lately sat scolding all the forest; and then, later, with an appalling passivity. And at every fresh exchange of words, while she laughed and fended, and fended and laughed, along with this passivity came a yet more appalling perversity; a passivity and perversity as of delirium, and as horrid to her as to me, though I little thought so then.  We came where a line of dense woods on our left marked the bottom-lands of Morgan's Creek. With her two earlier companions my fellow-traveller had crossed a ford here shortly after sunset, seeing no one; but a guard might easily have been put here since, by the Federals in Fayette. Pretty soon the road, bending toward it, led us down between two fenced fields and we stealthily walked our horses. Close to a way-side tree I murmured that if she would keep my horse I would steal nearer on foot and reconnoitre, and I had partly risen from the saddle, when I was thrilled by the pressure of her hand upon mine on the saddle-bow. \"Don't commit the soldier's deadliest sin, my dear Mr. Smith,\" she said under her breath, and smiled at my agitation; \"I mean, don't lose time.\"  I was about to put a false meaning even on that, when she added \"We don't need the ford this time of year; let us ride back as if we gave up the trip--for there may be a vidette looking at us now in the edge of those bushes--and as soon as we get where we can't be seen let us take a circuit. We can cross the creek somewhere above and strike the Wiggins road up in the woods. You can find your way by the blessed stars, can't you--being the angel you are?\"  My whole nature was upheaved. You may smile, but my plight was awful. In the sultry night I grew cold. My bridle-hand, still lying under her palm, turned and folded its big stupid fingers over hers. Then our hands slid apart and we rode back. \"I wish I were good enough to know the stars,\" she said, gazing up. \"Tell me some of them.\"  I told them. Two or three times my voice stuck in my throat, I found the sky so filled, so possessed, by constellations of evil name. At our back the Dragon writhed between the two Bears; over us hung the Eagle, and in the south were the Wolf, the Crow, the Hydra, the Serpent--\"Oh, don't tell any more,\" she exclaimed. \"Or rather--what are those three bright stars yonder? Why do you skip them?\"  \"Those? That one is the Virgin's sheaf; and those two are the Balances.\"  I failed to catch her reply.

TRANSLATED BY                            CAPTAIN HENRY BELL.

MARTIN LUTHER died on the 18th of February, 1546, and the first publication of his “Table Talk”—_Tischreden_—by his friend, Johann Goldschmid (Aurifaber), was in 1566, in a substantial folio.  The talk of Luther was arranged, according to its topics, into eighty chapters, each with a minute index of contents.  The whole work in a complete octavo edition, published at Stuttgart and Leipzig in 1836, occupies 1,390 closely printed pages, equivalent to 2,780 pages, or full fourteen volumes, of this Library.  The nearest approach to a complete and ungarbled translation into English was that of Captain Henry Bell, made in the reign of Charles the First, under the circumstances set forth by himself; but even that was not complete.  Other English versions have subjected Luther’s opinions to serious manipulation, nothing being added, but anything being taken away that did not chance to agree with the editor’s digestion.  Even the folio of Captain Bell’s translation, from which these Selections have been printed, has been prepared for reprint by some preceding editor, whose pen has been busy in revision of the passages he did mean to reprint.  In these Selections every paragraph stands unabridged, exactly as it was translated by Captain Bell; and there has been no other purpose governing the choice of matter than a resolve to make it as true a presentment as possible of Luther’s mind and character.  At least one other volume of _Selections from the Table-Talk of Martin Luther_ will be given in this Library.  Johann Goldschmid, the Aurifaber, and thereby true worker in gold, who first gave Luther’s Table-Talk to the world, was born in 1519.  He was a disciple of Luther, thirty-six years younger than his master.  Luther was born at Eisleben in 1483, and his father, a poor miner, presently settled at Mansfeld, the town in which Goldschmid afterwards was born.  Johann Goldschmid was sent by Count Albrecht of Mansfeld, in 1537, to the University of Wittenberg, where Luther had been made, in 1508, Professor of Philosophy, and where, on the 31st of October, 1517, he had nailed his ninety-five propositions against indulgences to the church door at the castle.  Luther had completed his translation of the Bible three years before Johann Goldschmid went to Wittenberg.  In 1540 Goldschmid was recalled from the University to act as tutor to Count Albrecht’s children.  In 1544 Goldschmid was army chaplain with the troops from Mansfeld in the French war; but in 1545 he was sent back to Wittenberg for special study of theology.  It was then that he attached himself to Luther as his _famulus_ and house-companion during the closing months of Luther’s life, began already to collect from surrounding friends passages of his vigorous “Table Talk,” and remained with Luther till the last, having been present at his death in Eisleben in 1546.  He then proceeded steadily with the collection of Luther’s sayings and opinions expressed among his friends.  He was army chaplain among the soldiers of Johann Friedrich, of Saxony; he spent half a year also in a Saxon prison.  He became, in 1551, court preacher at Weimar; but in 1562 was deprived of his office, and then devoted himself to the forming of an Eisleben edition of those works of Luther, which had not already been collected. In 1566 he was called to a pastorate at Erfurt, where he had many more troubles before his death.  Aurifaber died on the 18th of November, 1575.                                                                       H. M.     THE TESTIMONY OF JO. AURIFABER, DOCTOR IN DIVINITY, CONCERNING LUTHER’S DIVINE DISCOURSES.   AND whereas hitherto I have caused certain tomes of the Books, Sermons, Writings, and Missives of Luther to be printed at Eisleben, so have I also now finished this tome of his Discourses, and have ordered the same to be printed, which at the first were collected together out of the Manuscripts of these Divine Discourses, which that Reverend Father Anthony Lauterbach himself noted and wrote out of the holy mouth of Luther, and afterwards the same by me were collected into sure and certain Loci Communes, or Common-places, and distributed.  And whereas I, Joannes Aurifaber, in the years 1545 and 1546, before the death of that most famous Divine, Luther, was much with and about him, and with all diligence writ and noted down many most excellent Histories and Acts, and other most necessary and useful things which he related: I have therefore set in order and brought the same also into this tome.  Now, forasmuch as very excellent declaration is made in this tome of all the Articles and chief points of Christian Religion, Doctrine, and Faith; and also therein are found necessary Rules, Questions and Answers, many fair Histories, all sorts of Learnings, Comforts, Advices, Prophecies, Warnings, and Admonitions: I have therefore thought it a thing fitting to dedicate the same to your Highnesses, Graces, Honours and Worships, etc., as special favourers, protectors, and defenders of the Doctrines which God, through Luther, hath cleared again, to the end that by diligent reading therein, you may be president, and give good examples to others, to your subjects, citizens, etc., diligently to love, to read, to affect the same, and to make good use thereof, as being fragments that fell from Luther’s Table, and therewith may help to still, to slake, and to satisfy the spiritual hunger and thirst of the soul.  For these most profitable Discourses of Luther, containing such high spiritual things, we should in nowise suffer to be lost, but worthily esteem thereof, whereout all manner of learning, joy, and comfort may be had and received.                                               DR. AURIFABER, in his Preface                                                               to the Book.  _Given at Eisleben_, _July 7th_, _1569_.     CAPTAIN HENRY BELL’S NARRATIVE:                                      OR,  RELATION OF THE MIRACULOUS PRESERVING OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER’S BOOK, ENTITLED “COLLOQUIA MENSALIA,” OR, “HIS DIVINE DISCOURSES AT HIS TABLE,” HELD WITH DIVERS LEARNED MEN AND PIOUS DIVINES; SUCH AS WERE PHILIP MELANCTHON, CASPARUS CRUCIGER, JUSTUS JONAS, PAULUS EBERUS, VITUS DIETERICUS, JOANNES BUGENHAGEN, JOANNES FORSTERUS, AND OTHERS:                                  CONTAINING  _Divers Discourses touching Religion_, _and other Main Points of Doctrine_; _as also many notable Histories_, _and all sorts of Learning_, _Comforts_, _Advices_, _Prophecies_, _Admonitions_, _Directions_, _and Instructions_; _and how the same Book was_, _by God’s Providence_, _discovered lying under the Ground_, _where it had lain hid Fifty-two Years_; _and was a few years since sent over to the said Captain Henry Bell_, _and by him translated out of the High German into the English Tongue_.  “I, CAPTAIN HENRY BELL, do hereby declare, both to the present age, and also to posterity, that being employed beyond the seas in state affairs divers years together, both by King James, and also by the late King Charles, in Germany, I did hear and understand, in all places, great bewailing and lamentation made, by reason of the destroying and burning of above fourscore thousand of Martin Luther’s books, entitled _His Last Divine Discourses_.  “For after such time as God stirred up the spirit of Martin Luther to detect the corruptions and abuses of Popery, and to preach Christ, and clearly to set forth the simplicity of the Gospel, many Kings, Princes, and States, Imperial Cities, and Hans-Towns fell from the Popish Religion, and became Protestants, as their posterities still are, and remain to this very day.  “And for the further advancement of the great work of Reformation then begun, the aforesaid Princes and the rest did then order that the said Divine Discourses of Luther should forthwith be printed; and that every parish should have and receive one of the aforesaid printed books into every Church throughout all their principalities and dominions, to be chained up, for the common people to read therein.  “Upon which divine work, or Discourses, the Reformation, begun before in Germany, was wonderfully promoted and increased, and spread both here in England and other countries besides.  “But afterwards it so fell out that the Pope then living, viz. Gregory XIII., understanding what great hurt and prejudice he and his Popish religion had already received, by reason of the said Luther’s Divine Discourses, and also fearing that the same might bring further contempt and mischief upon himself and upon the Popish Church, he therefore, to prevent the same, did fiercely stir up and instigate the Emperor then in being, viz. Rudolphus II., to make an Edict throughout the whole Empire, that all the aforesaid printed books should be burned; and also that it should be death for any person to have or keep a copy thereof, but also to burn the same: which Edict was speedily put in execution accordingly, insomuch that not one of all the said printed books, nor so much as any one copy of the same, could be found out nor heard of in any place.  “Yet it pleased God that, anno 1626, a German gentleman, named Casparus Van Sparr, with whom, in the time of my staying in Germany about King James’s business, I became very familiarly known and acquainted, having occasion to build upon the old foundation of a house,"]]]
