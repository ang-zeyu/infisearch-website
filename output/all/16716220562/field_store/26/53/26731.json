Made a joke on the ex-Isle of Erin.  Coldly   received.  War with the whole world!  EXISTENCE, n.    A transient, horrible, fantastic dream,   Wherein is nothing yet all things do seem:   From which we're wakened by a friendly nudge   Of our bedfellow Death, and cry:  \"O fudge!\"  EXPERIENCE, n.  The wisdom that enables us to recognize as an undesirable old acquaintance the folly that we have already embraced.    To one who, journeying through night and fog,   Is mired neck-deep in an unwholesome bog,   Experience, like the rising of the dawn,   Reveals the path that he should not have gone.  Joel Frad Bink   EXPOSTULATION, n.  One of the many methods by which fools prefer to lose their friends.  EXTINCTION, n.  The raw material out of which theology created the future state.     F   FAIRY, n.  A creature, variously fashioned and endowed, that formerly inhabited the meadows and forests.  It was nocturnal in its habits, and somewhat addicted to dancing and the theft of children.  The fairies are now believed by naturalists to be extinct, though a clergyman of the Church of England saw three near Colchester as lately as 1855, while passing through a park after dining with the lord of the manor.  The sight greatly staggered him, and he was so affected that his account of it was incoherent.  In the year 1807 a troop of fairies visited a wood near Aix and carried off the daughter of a peasant, who had been seen to enter it with a bundle of clothing.  The son of a wealthy _bourgeois_ disappeared about the same time, but afterward returned.  He had seen the abduction and been in pursuit of the fairies.  Justinian Gaux, a writer of the fourteenth century, avers that so great is the fairies' power of transformation that he saw one change itself into two opposing armies and fight a battle with great slaughter, and that the next day, after it had resumed its original shape and gone away, there were seven hundred bodies of the slain which the villagers had to bury.  He does not say if any of the wounded recovered.  In the time of Henry III, of England, a law was made which prescribed the death penalty for \"Kyllynge, wowndynge, or mamynge\" a fairy, and it was universally respected.  FAITH, n.  Belief without evidence in what is told by one who speaks without knowledge, of things without parallel.  FAMOUS, adj.  Conspicuously miserable.    Done to a turn on the iron, behold       Him who to be famous aspired.   Content?  Well, his grill has a plating of gold,       And his twistings are greatly admired.  Hassan Brubuddy   FASHION, n.  A despot whom the wise ridicule and obey.    A king there was who lost an eye       In some excess of passion;   And straight his courtiers all did try       To follow the new fashion.    Each dropped one eyelid when before       The throne he ventured, thinking   'Twould please the king.  That monarch swore       He'd slay them all for winking.    What should they do?  They were not hot       To hazard such disaster;   They dared not close an eye--dared not       See better than their master.    Seeing them lacrymose and glum,       A leech consoled the weepers:   He spread small rags with liquid gum       And covered half their peepers.    The court all wore the stuff, the flame       Of royal anger dying.   That's how court-plaster got its name       Unless I'm greatly lying.  Naramy Oof   FEAST, n.  A festival.  A religious celebration usually signalized by gluttony and drunkenness, frequently in honor of some holy person distinguished for abstemiousness.  In the Roman Catholic Church feasts are \"movable\" and \"immovable,\" but the celebrants are uniformly immovable until they are full.  In their earliest development these entertainments took the form of feasts for the dead; such were held by the Greeks, under the name _Nemeseia_, by the Aztecs and Peruvians, as in modern times they are popular with the Chinese; though it is believed that the ancient dead, like the modern, were light eaters. Among the many feasts of the Romans was the _Novemdiale_, which was held, according to Livy, whenever stones fell from heaven.  FELON, n.  A person of greater enterprise than discretion, who in embracing an opportunity has formed an unfortunate attachment.  FEMALE, n.  One of the opposing, or unfair, sex.    The Maker, at Creation's birth,   With living things had stocked the earth.   From elephants to bats and snails,   They all were good, for all were males.   But when the Devil came and saw   He said:  \"By Thine eternal law   Of growth, maturity, decay,   These all must quickly pass away   And leave untenanted the earth   Unless Thou dost establish birth\"--   Then tucked his head beneath his wing   To laugh--he had no sleeve--the thing   With deviltry did so accord,   That he'd suggested to the Lord.   The Master pondered this advice,   Then shook and threw the fateful dice   Wherewith all matters here below   Are ordered, and observed the throw;   Then bent His head in awful state,   Confirming the decree of Fate.   From every part of earth anew   The conscious dust consenting flew,   While rivers from their courses rolled   To make it plastic for the mould.   Enough collected (but no more,   For niggard Nature hoards her store)   He kneaded it to flexible clay,   While Nick unseen threw some away.   And then the various forms He cast,   Gross organs first and finer last;   No one at once evolved, but all   By even touches grew and small   Degrees advanced, till, shade by shade,   To match all living things He'd made   Females, complete in all their parts   Except (His clay gave out) the hearts.   \"No matter,\" Satan cried; \"with speed   I'll fetch the very hearts they need\"--   So flew away and soon brought back   The number needed, in a sack.   That night earth rang with sounds of strife--   Ten million males each had a wife;   That night sweet Peace her pinions spread   O'er Hell--ten million devils dead!  G.J.   FIB, n.  A lie that has not cut its teeth.  An habitual liar's nearest approach to truth:  the perigee of his eccentric orbit.    When David said:  \"All men are liars,\" Dave,       Himself a liar, fibbed like any thief.       Perhaps he thought to weaken disbelief   By proof that even himself was not a slave   To Truth; though I suspect the aged knave       Had been of all her servitors the chief       Had he but known a fig's reluctant leaf   Is more than e'er she wore on land or wave.   No, David served not Naked Truth when he       Struck that sledge-hammer blow at all his race;           Nor did he hit the nail upon the head:   For reason shows that it could never be,       And the facts contradict him to his face.           Men are not liars all, for some are dead.  Bartle Quinker   FICKLENESS, n.  The iterated satiety of an enterprising affection.  FIDDLE, n.  An instrument to tickle human ears by friction of a horse's tail on the entrails of a cat.    To Rome said Nero:  \"If to smoke you turn   I shall not cease to fiddle while you burn.\"   To Nero Rome replied:  \"Pray do your worst,   'Tis my excuse that you were fiddling first.\"  Orm Pludge   FIDELITY, n.  A virtue peculiar to those who are about to be betrayed.  FINANCE, n.  The art or science of managing revenues and resources for the best advantage of the manager.  The pronunciation of this word with the i long and the accent on the first syllable is one of America's most precious discoveries and possessions.  FLAG, n.  A colored rag borne above troops and hoisted on forts and ships.  It appears to serve the same purpose as certain signs that one sees on vacant lots in London--\"Rubbish may be shot here.\"  FLESH, n.  The Second Person of the secular Trinity.  FLOP, v.  Suddenly to change one's opinions and go over to another party.  The most notable flop on record was that of Saul of Tarsus, who has been severely criticised as a turn-coat by some of our partisan journals.  FLY-SPECK, n.  The prototype of punctuation.  It is observed by Garvinus that the systems of punctuation in use by the various literary nations depended originally upon the social habits and general diet of the flies infesting the several countries.  These creatures, which have always been distinguished for a neighborly and companionable familiarity with authors, liberally or niggardly embellish the manuscripts in process of growth under the pen, according to their bodily habit, bringing out the sense of the work by a species of interpretation superior to, and independent of, the writer's powers.  The \"old masters\" of literature--that is to say, the early writers whose work is so esteemed by later scribes and critics in the same language--never punctuated at all, but worked right along free-handed, without that abruption of the thought which comes from the use of points.  (We observe the same thing in children to-day, whose usage in this particular is a striking and beautiful instance of the law that the infancy of individuals reproduces the methods and stages of development characterizing the infancy of races.)  In the work of these primitive scribes all the punctuation is found, by the modern investigator with his optical instruments and chemical tests, to have been inserted by the writers' ingenious and serviceable collaborator, the common house-fly--_Musca maledicta_. In transcribing these ancient MSS, for the purpose of either making the work their own or preserving what they naturally regard as divine revelations, later writers reverently and accurately copy whatever marks they find upon the papyrus or parchment, to the unspeakable enhancement of the lucidity of the thought and value of the work. Writers contemporary with the copyists naturally avail themselves of the obvious advantages of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/974"],["title","The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale (#0)"],["body","SECRET AGENT                               A SIMPLE TALE                                       BY                               JOSEPH CONRAD                                SECOND EDITION                                METHUEN & CO.,                            36 ESSEX STREET W C.

It could be done, because there was very little business at any time, and practically none at all before the evening.  Mr Verloc cared but little about his ostensible business.  And, moreover, his wife was in charge of his brother-in-law.  The shop was small, and so was the house.  It was one of those grimy brick houses which existed in large quantities before the era of reconstruction dawned upon London.  The shop was a square box of a place, with the front glazed in small panes.  In the daytime the door remained closed; in the evening it stood discreetly but suspiciously ajar.  The window contained photographs of more or less undressed dancing girls; nondescript packages in wrappers like patent medicines; closed yellow paper envelopes, very flimsy, and marked two-and-six in heavy black figures; a few numbers of ancient French comic publications hung across a string as if to dry; a dingy blue china bowl, a casket of black wood, bottles of marking ink, and rubber stamps; a few books, with titles hinting at impropriety; a few apparently old copies of obscure newspapers, badly printed, with titles like _The Torch_, _The Gong_—rousing titles.  And the two gas jets inside the panes were always turned low, either for economy’s sake or for the sake of the customers.  These customers were either very young men, who hung about the window for a time before slipping in suddenly; or men of a more mature age, but looking generally as if they were not in funds.  Some of that last kind had the collars of their overcoats turned right up to their moustaches, and traces of mud on the bottom of their nether garments, which had the appearance of being much worn and not very valuable.  And the legs inside them did not, as a general rule, seem of much account either.  With their hands plunged deep in the side pockets of their coats, they dodged in sideways, one shoulder first, as if afraid to start the bell going.  The bell, hung on the door by means of a curved ribbon of steel, was difficult to circumvent.  It was hopelessly cracked; but of an evening, at the slightest provocation, it clattered behind the customer with impudent virulence.  It clattered; and at that signal, through the dusty glass door behind the painted deal counter, Mr Verloc would issue hastily from the parlour at the back.  His eyes were naturally heavy; he had an air of having wallowed, fully dressed, all day on an unmade bed.  Another man would have felt such an appearance a distinct disadvantage.  In a commercial transaction of the retail order much depends on the seller’s engaging and amiable aspect.  But Mr Verloc knew his business, and remained undisturbed by any sort of æsthetic doubt about his appearance.  With a firm, steady-eyed impudence, which seemed to hold back the threat of some abominable menace, he would proceed to sell over the counter some object looking obviously and scandalously not worth the money which passed in the transaction: a small cardboard box with apparently nothing inside, for instance, or one of those carefully closed yellow flimsy envelopes, or a soiled volume in paper covers with a promising title.  Now and then it happened that one of the faded, yellow dancing girls would get sold to an amateur, as though she had been alive and young.  Sometimes it was Mrs Verloc who would appear at the call of the cracked bell.  Winnie Verloc was a young woman with a full bust, in a tight bodice, and with broad hips.  Her hair was very tidy.  Steady-eyed like her husband, she preserved an air of unfathomable indifference behind the rampart of the counter.  Then the customer of comparatively tender years would get suddenly disconcerted at having to deal with a woman, and with rage in his heart would proffer a request for a bottle of marking ink, retail value sixpence (price in Verloc’s shop one-and-sixpence), which, once outside, he would drop stealthily into the gutter.  The evening visitors—the men with collars turned up and soft hats rammed down—nodded familiarly to Mrs Verloc, and with a muttered greeting, lifted up the flap at the end of the counter in order to pass into the back parlour, which gave access to a passage and to a steep flight of stairs.  The door of the shop was the only means of entrance to the house in which Mr Verloc carried on his business of a seller of shady wares, exercised his vocation of a protector of society, and cultivated his domestic virtues.  These last were pronounced.  He was thoroughly domesticated.  Neither his spiritual, nor his mental, nor his physical needs were of the kind to take him much abroad.  He found at home the ease of his body and the peace of his conscience, together with Mrs Verloc’s wifely attentions and Mrs Verloc’s mother’s deferential regard.  Winnie’s mother was a stout, wheezy woman, with a large brown face.  She wore a black wig under a white cap.  Her swollen legs rendered her inactive.  She considered herself to be of French descent, which might have been true; and after a good many years of married life with a licensed victualler of the more common sort, she provided for the years of widowhood by letting furnished apartments for gentlemen near Vauxhall Bridge Road in a square once of some splendour and still included in the district of Belgravia.  This topographical fact was of some advantage in advertising her rooms; but the patrons of the worthy widow were not exactly of the fashionable kind.  Such as they were, her daughter Winnie helped to look after them.  Traces of the French descent which the widow boasted of were apparent in Winnie too.  They were apparent in the extremely neat and artistic arrangement of her glossy dark hair.  Winnie had also other charms: her youth; her full, rounded form; her clear complexion; the provocation of her unfathomable reserve, which never went so far as to prevent conversation, carried on on the lodgers’ part with animation, and on hers with an equable amiability.  It must be that Mr Verloc was susceptible to these fascinations.  Mr Verloc was an intermittent patron.  He came and went without any very apparent reason. He generally arrived in London (like the influenza) from the Continent, only he arrived unheralded by the Press; and his visitations set in with great severity.  He breakfasted in bed, and remained wallowing there with an air of quiet enjoyment till noon every day—and sometimes even to a later hour.  But when he went out he seemed to experience a great difficulty in finding his way back to his temporary home in the Belgravian square.  He left it late, and returned to it early—as early as three or four in the morning; and on waking up at ten addressed Winnie, bringing in the breakfast tray, with jocular, exhausted civility, in the hoarse, failing tones of a man who had been talking vehemently for many hours together.  His prominent, heavy-lidded eyes rolled sideways amorously and languidly, the bedclothes were pulled up to his chin, and his dark smooth moustache covered his thick lips capable of much honeyed banter.  In Winnie’s mother’s opinion Mr Verloc was a very nice gentleman.  From her life’s experience gathered in various “business houses” the good woman had taken into her retirement an ideal of gentlemanliness as exhibited by the patrons of private-saloon bars.  Mr Verloc approached that ideal; he attained it, in fact.  “Of course, we’ll take over your furniture, mother,” Winnie had remarked.  The lodging-house was to be given up.  It seems it would not answer to carry it on.  It would have been too much trouble for Mr Verloc.  It would not have been convenient for his other business.  What his business was he did not say; but after his engagement to Winnie he took the trouble to get up before noon, and descending the basement stairs, make himself pleasant to Winnie’s mother in the breakfast-room downstairs where she had her motionless being.  He stroked the cat, poked the fire, had his lunch served to him there.  He left its slightly stuffy cosiness with evident reluctance, but, all the same, remained out till the night was far advanced.  He never offered to take Winnie to theatres, as such a nice gentleman ought to have done.  His evenings were occupied.  His work was in a way political, he told Winnie once.  She would have, he warned her, to be very nice to his political friends.  And with her straight, unfathomable glance she answered that she would be so, of course.  How much more he told her as to his occupation it was impossible for Winnie’s mother to discover.  The married couple took her over with the furniture.  The mean aspect of the shop surprised her.  The change from the Belgravian square to the narrow street in Soho affected her legs adversely.  They became of an enormous size.  On the other hand, she experienced a complete relief from material cares.  Her son-in-law’s heavy good nature inspired her with a sense of absolute safety.  Her daughter’s future was obviously assured, and even as to her son Stevie she need have no anxiety.  She had not been able to conceal from herself that he "]]]
