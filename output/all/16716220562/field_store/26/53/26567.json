And he went on once more with a long argument full of Bible quotations and everything.  And I wuz too tuckered out to say much more. But I did contend for it to the last, that I didn't believe a rostrum would be any more tottlin' and skairful a place than the barell I had been a-standin' on all day, nor the work I'd do on it any harder than the scrapin' of the ceilin' of that meetin house.  And I don't believe it would, I stand jest as firm on it to-day as I did then.     CHAPTER XX.   Wall, we got the scrapin' done after three hard and arjous days' works, and then we preceeded to clean the house. The day we set to clean the meetin' house prior and before paperin', we all met in good season, for we knew the hardships of the job in front of us, and we all felt that we wanted to tackle it with our full strengths.  Sister Henzy, wife of Deacon Henzy, got there jest as I did. She wuz in middlin' good spirits and a old yeller belzerine dress.  Sister Gowdy had the ganders and newraligy and wore a flannel for 'em round her head, but she wuz in workin' spirits, her will wuz up in arms, and nerved up her body.  Sister Meechim wuz a-makin' soap, and so wuz Sister Sypher, and Sister Mead, and me. But we all felt that soap come after religion, not before. \"Cleanliness _next_ to godliness.\"  So we wuz all willin' to act accordin' and tackle the old meetin' house with a willin' mind.  Wall, we wuz all engaged in the very heat of the warfare, as you may say, a-scrubbin' the floors, and a-scourin' the benches by the door, and a-blackin' the 2 stoves that stood jest inside of the door. We wuz workin' jest as hard as wimmen ever worked--and all of the wimmen who wuzn't engaged in scourin' and moppin' wuz a-settin' round in the pews a-workin' hard on articles for the fair--when all of a suddin the outside door opened and in come Josiah Allen with 3 of the other men bretheren.  They had jest got the great news of wimmen bein' apinted for Deaconesses, and had come down on the first minute to tell us. She that wuz Celestine Bobbet wuz the only female present that had heard of it.  Josiah had heard it to the post-office, and he couldn't wait till noon to tell me about it, and Deacon Gowdy wuz anxius Miss Gowdy should hear it as soon es possible. Deacon Sypher wanted his wife to know at once that if she wuzn't married she could have become a deaconess under his derectin'.  And Josiah wanted me to know immegietly that I, too, could have had the privilege if I had been a more single woman, of becomin' a deaconess, and have had the chance of workin' all my hull life for the meetin' house, with a man to direct my movements and take charge on me, and tell me what to do, from day to day and from hour to hour.  And Deacon Henzy was anxious Miss Henzy should get the news as quick as she could. So they all hastened down to the meetin' house to tell us.  And we left off our work for a minute to hear 'em. It wuzn't nowhere near time for us to go home.  Josiah had lots of further business to do in Jonesville and so had the other men. But the news had excited 'em, and exhilerated 'em so, that they had dropped everything, and hastened right down to tell us, and then they wuz a-goin' back agin immegietly.  I, myself, took the news coolly, or as cool as I could, with my temperature up to five or five and a half, owin' to the hard work and the heat.  [Illustration: THE LAST NEWS FROM THE CONFERENCE.]  Miss Gowdy also took it pretty calm. She leaned on her mop handle, partly for rest (for she was tuckered out) and partly out of good manners, and didn't say much.  But Miss Sypheris such a admirin'woman, she looked fairly radiant at the news, and she spoke up to her husband in her enthusiastik warm-hearted way--  \"Why, Deacon Sypher, is it possible that I, too, could become a deacon, jest like you?\"  \"No,\" sez Deacon Sypher solemnly, \"no, Drusilly, not like me. But you wimmen have got the privelege now, if you are single, of workin' all your days at church work under the direction of us men.\"  \"Then I could work at the Deacon trade under you,\" sez she admirin'ly, \"I could work jest like you--pass round the bread and wine and the contribution box Sundays?\"  \"Oh, no, Drusilly,\" sez he condesendinly, \"these hard and arjuous dutys belong to the male deaconship. That is their own one pertickiler work, that wimmen can't infringe upon. Their hull strength is spent in these duties, wimmen deacons have other fields of labor, such as relievin' the wants of the sick and sufferin', sittin' up nights with small-pox patients, takin' care of the sufferin' poor, etc., etc.\"  \"But,\" sez Miss Sypher (she is so good-hearted, and so awful fond of the deacon), \"wouldn't it be real sweet, Deacon, if you and I could work together as deacons, and tend the sick, relieve the sufferers--work for the good of the church together--go about doin' good?\"  \"No, Drusilly,\" sez he, \"that is wimmen's work. I would not wish for a moment to curtail the holy rights of wimmen. I wouldn't want to stand in her way, and keep her from doin' all this modest, un-pretendin' work, for which her weaker frame and less hefty brain has fitted her.  \"We will let it go on in the same old way. Let wimmen have the privelege of workin' hard, jest as she always has. Let her work all the time, day and night, and let men go on in the same sure old way of superentendin' her movements, guardin' her weaker footsteps, and bossin' her round generally.\"  Deacon Sypher is never happy in his choice of language, and his method of argiment is such that when he is up on the affirmative of a question, the negative is delighted, for they know he will bring victery to their side of the question. Now, he didn't mean to speak right out about men's usual way of bossin' wimmen round. It was only his unfortunate and transparent manner of speakin'.  And Deacon Bobbet hastened to cover up the remark by the statement that \"he wuz so highly tickled that wimmen wuzn't goin' to be admitted to the Conference, because it would _weaken_ the Conference.\"  \"Yes,\" sez my Josiah, a-leanin' up aginst the meetin' house door, and talkin' pretty loud, for Sister Peedick and me had gone to liftin' round the big bench by the door, and it wuz fearful heavy, and our minds wuz excersised as to the best place to put it while we wuz a-cleanin' the floor.  \"You see,\" sez he, \"we feel, we men do, we feel that it would be weakenin' to the Conference to have wimmen admitted, both on account of her own lack of strength and also from the fact that every woman you would admit would keep out a man. And that,\" sez he (a-leanin' back in a still easier attitude, almust a luxurious one), \"that, you see, would tend naterally to weakenin' the strength of a church.\"  [Illustration: \"WALL,\" SEZ I, \"MOVE ROUND A LITTLE, WON'T YOU, FOR WE WANT TO SET THE BENCH.\"]  \"Wall,\" sez I, a-pantin' hard for breath under my burden, \"move round a little, won't you, for we want to set the bench here while we scrub under it. And,\" sez I, a-stoppin' a minute and rubbin' the perspiratin and sweat offen my face, \"Seein' you men are all here, can't you lay holt and help us move out the benches, so we can clean the floor under 'em? Some of 'em are very hefty,\" sez I, \"and all of us Sisters almost are a-makin' soap, and we all want to get done here, so we can go home and bile down; we would dearly love a little help,\" sez I.  \"I would help,\" sez Josiah in a willin' tone, \"I would help in a minute, if I hadn't got so much work to do at home.\"  And all the other male bretheren said the same thing--they had got to git to get home to get to work. (Some on 'em wanted to play checkers, and I knew it.)  But some on 'em did have lots of work on their hands, I couldn't dispute it.     CHAPTER XXI.   Why, Deacon Henzy, besides all his cares about the buzz saw mill, and his farm work, had bought a steam threshin' machine that made him sights of work. It was a good machine. But it wuz fairly skairful to see it a-steamin' and a-blowin' right along the streets of Jonesville without the sign of a horse or ox or anything nigh it to draw it. A-puffin' out the steam, and a-tearin' right along, that awful lookin' that it skairt she that wuz Celestine Bobbet most into fits.  She lived in a back place where such machines wuz unknown, and she had come home to her father's on a visit, and wuz goin' over to visit some of his folks that day, over to Loontown.  And she wuz a-travellin' along peacible, with her father's old mair, and a-leanin' back in the buggy a readin' a article her father had sent over by her to Deacon Widrig, a witherin' article about female Deaconesses, and the stern necessity of settin' 'em apart and sanctifyen' 'em to this one work--deacon work--and how they mustn't marry, or tackle any other hard jobs whatsumever, or break off into any other enterprize, only jest plain deacon work.  It wuz a very flowery article. And she wuz enjoyin' of it first rate, and a-thinkin', for she is a little timid and easily skairt, and the piece had convinced her--  She wuz jest a-thinkin' how dretful it would be if sum female deaconess should ever venter into some other branch of business, and what would be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9447"],["title","Samantha among the Brethren â€” Volume 5 (#3)"],["body","to become of her if she did. She hated to think of what her doom would most likely be, bein' tender hearted.  [Illustration: \"SHE SEE THIS WILD AND SKAIRFUL MACHINE APPROACHIN'.\"]  When lo, and behold! jest as she wuz a-thinkin' these thoughts, she see this wild and skairful machine approachin', and Deacon Henzy a-standin' up on top of it a-drivin'. He looked wild and excited, bein' very tickled to think that he had threshed more with his machine, by twenty bushels, than Deacon Petengill had with his.  There was a bet upon these two deacons, so it wuz spozed, and he wuz a-hastenin' to the next place where he wuz to be setup, so's to lose no time, and he was kinder hollerin'.  And the wind took his gray hair back, and his long side whiskers, and kinder stood 'em out, and the skirts of his frock the same.  His mean wuz wild.  And it wuz more than Celestine's old mair and she herself could bear; she cramped right round in the road (the mair did) and set sail back to old Bobbet'ses, and that great concern a-puffin' and a-steamin' along after 'em.  And by the time that she that wuz Celestine got there she wuz almost in a fit, and the mair in a perfect lather.  Wall, Celestine didn't get over it for weeks and weeks, nor the mair nuther.  And besides this enterprize of Deacon Henzy's, he had got up a great invention, a new rat trap, that wuz peculier and uneek in the extreme.  It wuz the result of arjous study on his part, by night and day, for a long, long time, and it wuz what he called \"A Travellin' Rat Trap.\" It wuz designed to sort o' chase the rats round and skair 'em.  [Illustration: DEACON HENZY'S RAT TRAP (LIKE A CIRCUS FOR THE RATS).]  It was spozed he got the idee in the first place from his threshin' machine. It had to be wound up, and then it would take after 'em--rats or mice, or anything--and they do say that it wuz quite a success.  Only it had to move on a smooth floor. It would travel round pretty much all night; and they say that when it wuz set up in a suller, it would chase the rats back into their holes, and they would set there and look out on it, for the biggest heft of the night. It would take up their minds, and kep 'em out of vittles and other mischief.  It wuz somethin' like providin' a circus for 'em.  But howsumever, the Deacon wuz a-workin' at this; he wuzn't quite satisfied with its runnin' gear, and he wuz a-perfectin' this rat trap every leisure minute he had outside of his buzz saw and threshin' machine business, and so he wuz fearful busy.  Deacon Sypher had took the agency for \"The Wild West, or The Leaping Cow Boy of the Plain,\" and wuz doin' well by it.  And Deacon Bobbet had took in a lot of mustangs to keep through the winter. And he wuz a ridin' 'em a good deal, accordin' to contract, and tryin' to tame 'em some before spring. And this work, with the buzz saw, took up every minute of his time. For the mustangs throwed him a good deal, and he had to lay bound up in linements a good deal of the time, and arneky.  [Illustration: \"HE HAD TO LAY BOUND UP IN LINEMENTS A GOOD DEAL OF THE TIME.\"]  So, as I say, it didn't surprise me a mite to have 'em say they couldn't help us, for I knew jest how these jobs of theirn devoured their time.  And when my Josiah had made his excuse, it wuzn't any more than I had looked out for, to hear Deacon Henzy say he had got to git home to ile his threshin' machine. One of the cogs wuz out of gear in some way.  He wanted to help us, so it didn't seem as if he could tear himself away, but that steam threshin' machine stood in the way. And then on his way down to Jonesville that very mornin' a new idee had come to him about that travellin' rat trap, and he wanted to get home jest as quick as he could, to try it.  And Deacon Bobbet said that three of them mustangs he had took in to break had got to be rid that day, they wuz a gettin' so wild he didn't hardly dast to go nigh 'em.  And Deacon Sypher said that he must hasten back, for a man wuz a-comin' to see him from way up on the State road, to try to get a agency under him for \"The Leaping Cow Boy of the Plain.\" And he wanted to show the \"Leaping Cow Boy\" to some agents to the tavern in Jonesville on his way home, and to some wimmen on the old Plank road. Two or three of the wimmen had gin hopes that they would take the \"Leaping Cow Boy.\"  And then they said--the hull three of the deacons did--that any minute them other deacons who wuz goin' into partnership with 'em in the buzz saw business wuz liable to drive down to see 'em about it.  And some of the other men brethren said their farms and their live stock demanded the hull of their time--every minute of it.  So we see jest how it wuz, we see these male deacons couldn't devote any of their time to the meetin' house, nor those other brethren nuther.  We see that their time wuz too valuable, and their own business devoured the hull on it. And we married Sisters, who wuz acestemed to the strange and mysterius ways of male men, we accepted the situation jest es we would any other mysterius dispensation, and didn't say nothin'.  Good land! We wuz used to curius sayin's and doin's, every one on us. Curius as a dog, and curiuser.  But Sister Meechim (onmarried), she is dretful questinin' and inquirin' (men don't like her, they say she prys into subjects she's no business to meddle with). She sez to Josiah:  \"Why is it, Deacon Allen, that men deacons can carry on all sorts of business and still be deacons, while wimmen deacons are obleeged to give up all other business and devote themselves wholly to their work?\"  \"It is on account of their minds,\" sez Josiah. \"Men have got stronger minds than wimmen, that is the reason.\"  And Sister Meechim sez agin--  \"Why is it that wimmen deacons have to remain onmarried, while men deacons can marry one wife after another through a long life, that is, if they are took from 'em by death or a divorce lawyer?\"  \"Wall,\" sez Josiah, \"that, too, is on account of their brains. Their brains hain't so hefty es men's.\"  But I jest waded into the argument then. I jest interfered, and sez in a loud, clear tone,  \"Oh, shaw!\"  And then I sez further, in the same calm, clear tones, but dry as ever a dry oven wuz in its dryest times. Sez I,  \"If you men can't help us any about the meetin' house, you'd better get out of our way, for we wimmen have got to go to scrubbin' right where you are a-standin'.\"  \"Certainly,\" sez Josiah, in a polite axent, \"certainly.\"  And so the rest of the men said.  And Josiah added to his remarks, as he went down the steps,  \"You'd better get home, Samantha, in time to cook a hen, and make some puddin', and so forth.\"  And I sez, with quite a lot of dignity, \"Have I ever failed, Josiah Allen, to have good dinners for you, and on time too?\"  \"No,\" sez he, \"but I thought I would jest stop to remind you of it, and also to tell you the last news from the Conference, about the deaconesses.\"  And so they trailed down one after another, and left us to our work in the meetin' house; but as they disapered round the corner, Sister Arvilly Lanfear, who hain't married, and who has got a sharp tongue (some think that is why, but I don't; I believe Arvilly has had chances).  But any way, she sez, as they went down the steps,  \"I'll bet them men wuz a-practisen' their new parts of men superentendents, and look on us as a lot of deaconesses.\"  [Illustration: \"JOSIAH ADDED TO HIS REMARKS.\"]  \"Wall,\" sez Sister Gowdy--she loves to put on Arvilly--\"wall, you have got one qualificatin', Arvilly!\"  \"Yes, thank the Lord,\" sez she.  And I never asked what she meant, but knew well enough that she spoke of her single state. But Arvilly has had chances, _I_ think.     CHAPTER XXII.   I got home in time to get a good supper, though mebbe I ortn't to say it.  Sure enough, Josiah Allen had killed a hen, and dressed it ready for me to brile, but it wuz young and tender, and I knew it wouldn't take long, so I didn't care.  Good land! I love to humor him, and he knows it. Casper Keeler come in jest as I wuz a-gettin' supper and I thought like as not he would stay to supper; I laid out to ask him. But I didn't take no more pains on his account. No, I do jest as well by Josiah Allen from day to day, as if he wuz company, or lay out to.  Casper came over on a errent about that buzz saw mill. He wuz in dretful good spirits, though he looked kinder peaked.  He had jest got home from the city.  It happened dretful curius, but jest at this time Casper Keeler had had to go to New York on business. He had to sign some papers that nobody else couldn't sign.  [Illustration: CASPER KEELER.]  His mother had hearn of a investment there that promised to pay dretful well, so she had took a lot of stock in it, and it had riz right up powerful. Why the money had increased fourfold, and more too, and Casper bein' jest come of age, had to go and sign suthin' or other.  Wall, he went round and see lots of sights in New York. His ma's money that she had left him made him fairly luxurius as to comfort, and he had plenty of money to go sight seein' as much as he wanted to.  He went to all the theatres, and operas, and shows of all kinds, and museums, and the Brooklyn Bridge, and circuses, and receptions, and et cetery, et cetery.  He wuz a-tellin' me how much money he spent while he wuz there, kinder boastin' on it; he had went to one of the biggest, highest taverns in the hull village of New York, where the price wuz higher than the very highest pinakle on the top of it, fur higher.  And I sez, \"Did you go to the Wimmen's Exchange and the Workin' Wimmen's Association, that wuz held there while you wuz there?\"  And he acted real scorfin'.  \"Wimmen's work!\" sez he. \"No, indeed! I had too much on my hands, and too much comfort to take in higher circles, than to take in any such little trifles as wimmen's work.\"  Sez I, \"Young man, it is a precious little you would take in in life if it hadn't been for wimmen's work. Who earned and left you the money you are a-u"]]]
