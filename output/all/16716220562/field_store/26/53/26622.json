Here were many paths, leading in various directions, and there was a signpost so old that there were now no words upon the sign. At one side was an old well, with a chain windlass for drawing water, yet there was no house or other building anywhere in sight.  While the party halted, puzzled which way to proceed, the mule approached the well and tried to look into it.  \"He's thirsty,\" said Betsy.  \"It's a dry well,\" remarked Shaggy. \"Probably there has been no water in it for many years. But, come; let us decide which way to travel.\"  No one seemed able to decide that. They sat down in a group and tried to consider which road might be the best to take. Hank, however, could not keep away from the well and finally he reared up on his hind legs, got his head over the edge and uttered a loud \"Hee-haw!\" Betsy watched her animal friend curiously.  \"I wonder if he sees anything down there?\" she said.  At this, Shaggy rose and went over to the well to investigate, and Betsy went with him. The Princess and Polychrome, who had become fast friends, linked arms and sauntered down one of the roads, to find an easy path.  \"Really,\" said Shaggy, \"there does seem to be something at the bottom of this old well.\"  \"Can't we pull it up, and see what it is?\" asked the girl.  There was no bucket at the end of the windlass chain, but there was a big hook that at one time was used to hold a bucket. Shaggy let down this hook, dragged it around on the bottom and then pulled it up. An old hoopskirt came with it, and Betsy laughed and threw it away. The thing frightened Hank, who had never seen a hoopskirt before, and he kept a good distance away from it.  Several other objects the Shaggy Man captured with the hook and drew up, but none of these was important.  \"This well seems to have been the dump for all the old rubbish in the country,\" he said, letting down the hook once more. \"I guess I've captured everything now. No--the hook has caught again. Help me, Betsy! Whatever this thing is, it's heavy.\"  She ran up and helped him turn the windlass and after much effort a confused mass of copper came in sight.  \"Good gracious!\" exclaimed Shaggy. \"Here is a surprise, indeed!\"  \"What is it?\" inquired Betsy, clinging to the windlass and panting for breath.  For answer the Shaggy Man grasped the bundle of copper and dumped it upon the ground, free of the well. Then he turned it over with his foot, spread it out, and to Betsy's astonishment the thing proved to be a copper man.  \"Just as I thought,\" said Shaggy, looking hard at the object. \"But unless there are two copper men in the world this is the most astonishing thing I ever came across.\"  At this moment the Rainbow's Daughter and the Rose Princess approached them, and Polychrome said:  \"What have you found, Shaggy One?\"  \"Either an old friend, or a stranger,\" he replied.  \"Oh, here's a sign on his back!\" cried Betsy, who had knelt down to examine the man. \"Dear me; how funny! Listen to this.\"  Then she read the following words, engraved upon the copper plates of the man's body:              SMITH & TINKER'S   Patent Double-Action, Extra-Responsive,   Thought-Creating, Perfect-Talking             MECHANICAL MAN   Fitted with our Special Clockwork Attachment.   Thinks, Speaks, Acts, and Does Everything but Live.   \"Isn't he wonderful!\" exclaimed the Princess.  \"Yes; but here's more,\" said Betsy, reading from another engraved plate:               DIRECTIONS FOR USING:    For THINKING:--Wind the Clockwork     Man under his left arm, (marked No. 1).   For SPEAKING:--Wind  the  Clockwork     Man under his right arm, (marked No. 2).   For WALKING and ACTION:--Wind Clockwork Man     in the middle of his back, (marked No. 3).    N. B.--This Mechanism is guaranteed to   work perfectly for a thousand years.   \"If he's guaranteed for a thousand years,\" said Polychrome, \"he ought to work yet.\"  \"Of course,\" replied Shaggy. \"Let's wind him up.\"  In order to do this they were obliged to set the copper man upon his feet, in an upright position, and this was no easy task. He was inclined to topple over, and had to be propped again and again. The girls assisted Shaggy, and at last Tik-Tok seemed to be balanced and stood alone upon his broad feet.  \"Yes,\" said Shaggy, looking at the copper man carefully, \"this must be, indeed, my old friend Tik-Tok, whom I left ticking merrily in the Land of Oz. But how he came to this lonely place, and got into that old well, is surely a mystery.\"  \"If we wind him, perhaps he will tell us,\" suggested Betsy. \"Here's the key, hanging to a hook on his back. What part of him shall I wind up first?\"  \"His thoughts, of course,\" said Polychrome, \"for it requires thought to speak or move intelligently.\"  So Betsy wound him under his left arm, and at once little flashes of light began to show in the top of his head, which was proof that he had begun to think.  \"Now, then,\" said Shaggy, \"wind up his phonograph.\"  \"What's that?\" she asked.  \"Why, his talking-machine. His thoughts may be interesting, but they don't tell us anything.\"  So Betsy wound the copper man under his right arm, and then from the interior of his copper body came in jerky tones the words: \"Ma-ny thanks!\"  \"Hurrah!\" cried Shaggy, joyfully, and he slapped Tik-Tok upon the back in such a hearty manner that the copper man lost his balance and tumbled to the ground in a heap. But the clockwork that enabled him to speak had been wound up and he kept saying: \"Pick-me-up! Pick-me-up! Pick-me-up!\" until they had again raised him and balanced him upon his feet, when he added politely: \"Ma-ny thanks!\"  \"He won't be self-supporting until we wind up his action,\" remarked Shaggy; so Betsy wound it, as tight as she could--for the key turned rather hard--and then Tik-Tok lifted his feet, marched around in a circle and ended by stopping before the group and making them all a low bow.  \"How in the world did you happen to be in that well, when I left you safe in Oz?\" inquired Shaggy.  \"It is a long sto-ry,\" replied Tik-Tok, \"but I'll tell it in a few words. Af-ter you had gone in search of your broth-er, Oz-ma saw you wan-der-ing in strange lands when-ev-er she looked in her mag-ic pic-ture, and she also saw your broth-er in the Nome King's cavern; so she sent me to tell you where to find your broth-er and told me to help you if I could. The Sor-cer-ess, Glin-da the Good, trans-port-ed me to this place in the wink of an eye; but here I met the Nome King him-self--old Rug-ge-do, who is called in these parts the Met-al Mon-arch. Rug-ge-do knew what I had come for, and he was so an-gry that he threw me down the well. Af-ter my works ran down I was help-less un-til you came a-long and pulled me out a-gain. Ma-ny thanks.\"  \"This is, indeed, good news,\" said Shaggy. \"I suspected that my brother was the prisoner of Ruggedo; but now I know it. Tell us, Tik-Tok, how shall we get to the Nome King's underground cavern?\"  \"The best way is to walk,\" said Tik-Tok. \"We might crawl, or jump, or roll o-ver and o-ver until we get there; but the best way is to walk.\"  \"I know; but which road shall we take?\"  \"My ma-chin-er-y is-n't made to tell that,\" replied Tik-Tok.  \"There is more than one entrance to the underground cavern,\" said Polychrome; \"but old Ruggedo has cleverly concealed every opening, so that earth dwellers can not intrude in his domain. If we find our way underground at all, it will be by chance.\"  \"Then,\" said Betsy, \"let us select any road, haphazard, and see where it leads us.\"  \"That seems sensible,\" declared the Princess. \"It may require a lot of time for us to find Ruggedo, but we have more time than anything else.\"  \"If you keep me wound up,\" said Tik-Tok, \"I will last a thou-sand years.\"  \"Then the only question to decide is which way to go,\" added Shaggy, looking first at one road and then at another.  But while they stood hesitating, a peculiar sound reached their ears--a sound like the tramping of many feet.  \"What's coming?\" cried Betsy; and then she ran to the left-hand road and glanced along the path. \"Why, it's an army!\" she exclaimed. \"What shall we do, hide or run?\"  \"Stand still,\" commanded Shaggy. \"I'm not afraid of an army. If they prove to be friendly, they can help us; if they are enemies, I'll show them the Love Magnet.\"     Chapter Eight  Tik-Tok Tackles a Tough Task   While Shaggy and his companions stood huddled in a group at one side, the Army of Oogaboo was approaching along the pathway, the tramp of their feet being now and then accompanied by a dismal groan as one of the officers stepped on a sharp stone or knocked his funnybone against his neighbor's sword-handle.  Then out from among the trees marched Private Files, bearing the banner of Oogaboo, which fluttered from a long pole. This pole he stuck in the ground just in front of the well and then he cried in a loud voice:  \"I hereby conquer this territory in the name of Queen Ann Soforth of Oogaboo, and all the inhabitants of the land I proclaim her slaves!\"  Some of the officers now stuck their heads out of the bushes and asked:  \"Is the coast clear, Private Files?\"  \"There is no coast here,\" was the reply, \"but all's well.\"  \"I hope there's water in it,\" said General Cone, mustering courage to advance to the well; but just then he caught a glimpse of Tik-Tok and Shaggy and at once fell upon his knees, trembling and frightened and cried out:  \"Mercy, kind enemies! Mercy! Spare us, and we will be your slaves forever!\"  The other officers, who had now advanced into the clearing, likewise fell upon their knees and begged for mercy.  Files turned around and, seeing the strangers for the first time, examined them with much curiosity. Then, discovering that three of the party were girls, he lifted his cap and made a polite bow.  \"What's all this?\" demanded a harsh voice, as Queen Ann reached the place and beheld her kneeling army.  \"Permit us to introduce ourselves,\" replied Shaggy, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/956"],["title","Tik-Tok of Oz (#7)"],["body","forward. \"This is Tik-Tok, the Clockwork Man--who works better than some meat people. And here is Princess Ozga of Roseland, just now unfortunately exiled from her Kingdom of Roses. I next present Polychrome, a sky fairy, who lost her Bow by an accident and can't find her way home. The small girl here is Betsy Bobbin, from some unknown earthly paradise called Oklahoma, and with her you see Mr. Hank, a mule with a long tail and a short temper.\"  \"Puh!\" said Ann, scornfully; \"a pretty lot of vagabonds you are, indeed; all lost or strayed, I suppose, and not worth a Queen's plundering. I'm sorry I've conquered you.\"  \"But you haven't conquered us yet,\" called Betsy indignantly.  \"No,\" agreed Files, \"that is a fact. But if my officers will kindly command me to conquer you, I will do so at once, after which we can stop arguing and converse more at our ease.\"  The officers had by this time risen from their knees and brushed the dust from their trousers. To them the enemy did not look very fierce, so the Generals and Colonels and Majors and Captains gained courage to face them and began strutting in their most haughty manner.  \"You must understand,\" said Ann, \"that I am the Queen of Oogaboo, and this is my invincible Army. We are busy conquering the world, and since you seem to be a part of the world, and are obstructing our journey, it is necessary for us to conquer you--unworthy though you may be of such high honor.\"  \"That's all right,\" replied Shaggy. \"Conquer us as often as you like. We don't mind.\"  \"But we won't be anybody's slaves,\" added Betsy, positively.  \"We'll see about that,\" retorted the Queen, angrily. \"Advance, Private Files, and bind the enemy hand and foot!\"  But Private Files looked at pretty Betsy and fascinating Polychrome and the beautiful Rose Princess and shook his head.  \"It would be impolite, and I won't do it,\" he asserted.  \"You must!\" cried Ann. \"It is your duty to obey orders.\"  \"I haven't received any orders from my officers,\" objected the Private.  But the Generals now shouted: \"Forward, and bind the prisoners!\" and the Colonels and Majors and Captains repeated the command, yelling it as loud as they could.  All this noise annoyed Hank, who had been eyeing the Army of Oogaboo with strong disfavor. The mule now dashed forward and began backing upon the officers and kicking fierce and dangerous heels at them. The attack was so sudden that the officers scattered like dust in a whirlwind, dropping their swords as they ran and trying to seek refuge behind the trees and bushes.  Betsy laughed joyously at the comical rout of the \"noble army,\" and Polychrome danced with glee. But Ann was furious at this ignoble defeat of her gallant forces by one small mule.  \"Private Files, I command you to do your duty!\" she cried again, and then she herself ducked to escape the mule's heels--for Hank made no distinction in favor of a lady who was an open enemy. Betsy grabbed her champion by the forelock, however, and so held him fast, and when the officers saw that the mule was restrained from further attacks they crept fearfully back and picked up their discarded swords.  \"Private Files, seize and bind these prisoners!\" screamed the Queen.  \"No,\" said Files, throwing down his gun and removing the knapsack which was strapped to his back, \"I resign my position as the Army of Oogaboo. I enlisted to fight the enemy and become a hero, but if you want some one to bind harmless girls you will have to hire another Private.\"  Then he walked over to the others and shook hands with Shaggy and Tik-Tok.  \"Treason!\" shrieked Ann, and all the officers echoed her cry.  \"Nonsense,\" said Files. \"I've the right to resign if I want to.\"  \"Indeed you haven't!\" retorted the Queen. \"If you resign it will break up my Army, and then I cannot conquer the world.\" She now turned to the officers and said: \"I must ask you to do me a favor. I know it is undignified in officers to fight, but unless you immediately capture Private Files and force him to obey my orders there will be no plunder for any of us. Also it is likely you will all suffer the pangs of hunger, and when we meet a powerful foe you are liable to be captured and made slaves.\"  The prospect of this awful fate so frightened the officers that they drew their swords and rushed upon Files, who stood beside Shaggy, in a truly ferocious manner. The next instant, however, they halted and again fell upon their knees; for there, before them, was the glistening Love Magnet, held in the hand of the smiling Shaggy Man, and the sight of this magic talisman at once won the heart of every Oogabooite. Even Ann saw the Love Magnet, and forgetting all enmity and anger threw herself upon Shaggy and embraced him lovingly.  Quite disconcerted by this unexpected effect of the Magnet, Shaggy disengaged himself from the Queen's encircling arms and quickly hid the talisman in his pocket. The adventurers from Oogaboo were now his firm friends, and there was no more talk about conquering and binding any of his party.  \"If you insist on conquering anyone,\" said Shaggy, \"you may march with me to the underground Kingdom of Ruggedo. To conquer the world, as you have set out to do, you must conquer everyone under its surface as well as those upon its surface, and no one in all the world needs conquering so much as Ruggedo.\"  \"Who is he?\" asked Ann.  \"The Metal Monarch, King of the Nomes.\"  \"Is he rich?\" inquired Major Stockings in an anxious voice.  \"Of course,\" answered Shaggy. \"He owns all the metal that lies underground--gold, silver, copper, brass and tin. He has an idea he also owns all the metals above ground, for he says all metal was once a part of his kingdom. So, by conquering the Metal Monarch, you will win all the riches in the world.\"  \"Ah!\" exclaimed General Apple, heaving a deep sigh, \"that would be plunder worth our while. Let's conquer him, Your Majesty.\"  The Queen looked reproachfully at Files, who was sitting next to the lovely Princess and whispering in her ear.  \"Alas,\" said Ann, \"I have no longer an Army. I have plenty of brave officers, indeed, but no private soldier for them to command. Therefore I cannot conquer Ruggedo and win all his wealth.\"  \"Why don't you make one of your officers the Private?\" asked Shaggy; but at once every officer began to protest and the Queen of Oogaboo shook her head as she replied:  \"That is impossible. A private soldier must be a terrible fighter, and my officers are unable to fight. They are exceptionally brave in commanding others to fight, but could not themselves meet the enemy and conquer.\"  \"Very true, Your Majesty,\" said Colonel Plum, eagerly. \"There are many kinds of bravery and one cannot be expected to possess them all. I myself am brave as a lion in all ways until it comes to fighting, but then my nature revolts. Fighting is unkind and liable to be injurious to others; so, being a gentleman, I never fight.\"  \"Nor I!\" shouted each of the other officers.  \"You see,\" said Ann, \"how helpless I am. Had not Private Files proved himself a traitor and a deserter, I would gladly have conquered this Ruggedo; but an Army without a private soldier is like a bee without a stinger.\"  \"I am not a traitor, Your Majesty,\" protested Files. \"I resigned in a proper manner, not liking the job. But there are plenty of people to take my place. Why not make Shaggy Man the private soldier?\"  \"He might be killed,\" said Ann, looking tenderly at Shaggy, \"for he is mortal, and able to die. If anything happened to him, it would break my heart.\"  \"It would hurt me worse than that,\" declared Shaggy. \"You must admit, Your Majesty, that I am commander of this expedition, for it is my brother we are seeking, rather than plunder. But I and my companions would like the assistance of your Army, and if you help us to conquer Ruggedo and to rescue my brother from captivity we will allow you to keep all the gold and jewels and other plunder you may find.\"  This prospect was so tempting that the officers began whispering together and presently Colonel Cheese said: \"Your Majesty, by combining our brains we have just evolved a most brilliant idea. We will make the Clockwork Man the private soldier!\"  \"Who? Me?\" asked Tik-Tok. \"Not for a sin-gle sec-ond! I can-not fight, and you must not for-get that it was Rug-ge-do who threw me in the well.\"  \"At that time you had no gun,\" said Polychrome. \"But if you join the Army of Oogaboo you will carry the gun that Mr. Files used.\"  \"A sol-dier must be a-ble to run as well as to fight,\" protested Tik-Tok, \"and if my works run down, as they of-ten do, I could nei-ther run nor fight.\"  \"I'll keep you wound up, Tik-Tok,\" promised Betsy.  \"Why, it isn't a bad idea,\" said Shaggy. \"Tik-Tok will make an ideal soldier, for nothing can injure him except a sledge hammer. And, since a private soldier seems to be necessary to this Army, Tik-Tok is the only one of our party fitted to undertake the job.\"  \"What must I do?\" asked Tik-Tok.  \"Obey orders,\" replied Ann. \"When the officers command you to do anything, you must do it; that is all.\"  \"And that's enough, too,\" said Files.  \"Do I get a salary?\" inquired Tik-Tok.  \"You get your share of the plunder,\" answered the Queen.  \"Yes,\" remarked Files, \"one-half of the plunder goes to Queen Ann, the other half is divided among the officers, and the Private gets the rest.\"  \"That will be sat-is-fac-tor-y,\" said Tik-Tok, picking up the gun and examining it wonderingly, for he had never before seen such a weapon.  Then Ann strapped the knapsack to Tik-Tok's copper back and said: \"Now we are ready to march to Ruggedo's Kingdom and conquer it. Officers, give the command to march.\"  \"Fall--in!\" yelled the Generals, drawing their swords.  \"Fall--in!\" cried the Colonels, drawing their swords.  \"Fall--in!\" shouted the Majors, drawing their swords.  \"Fall--in!\" bawled the Captains, drawing their swords.  Tik-Tok looked at them and then around him in surprise.  \"Fall in what? The well?\" he asked.  \"No,\""]]]
