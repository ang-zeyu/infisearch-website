Meanwhile Lydia, Chloe, and the other women prepared an out-of-door feast. A calf had been killed and cut up for cooking, and in the afternoon a huge fire was built. Lydia had charge of the cooking. She set great pieces of meat before the fire to roast, and told the children to sit by and turn them often to keep them from burning. Dion and Daphne also brought wood for the fire, while the slave women mixed cakes of meal and baked them in the ashes, or went to the spring for water, or carried refreshing drinks to the workers in the field.  It was sundown when the last sheaf was stacked and Melas gave the signal to stop work. Chloe at once brought cool water from the spring to the tired harvesters, and when they had washed their hot hands and faces, Melas made a rude altar of stones, kindled a fire upon it, and, calling the people together, offered upon it a handful of the new grain and made a prayer of thanks to Demeter, the Goddess of the fields, for the rich harvest. When this was done, the feast was ready. The meat and cakes and wine were passed to the men by the women, and when they had been well served, the women too sat down under a tree and ate their supper. It was a gay party. After supper there were jokes and songs, and Dromas played upon his shepherd's pipe, until the night came on and the moon showed her round face over the crest of the hills.  Then Lycias, the oldest slave of all, began to tell stories. He had seen the battle of Salamis, and he told how he had watched the Persian ships go down, one after another, before the victorious Greeks. \"And the King sat right on the high rocks north of the Piraeus and saw 'em go down,\" he chuckled. \"It was a great sight.\"  When Lycias had finished his story, Dromas told the tale of how the God Pan had appeared to a shepherd he knew, as he was watching his sheep along on the hills. \"It's all true,\" he declared, as the story ended. \"I knew the man myself. All sorts of things happen when you're out alone on the hillsides.\"  The fire, meanwhile, had died down to a heap of brands and gleaming coals, and Melas told the Twins to bring some wood to replenish it. They had been gone only a short time on this errand when the group around the fire was amazed to see them come darting back into the circle, all out of breath and with eyes as big as saucers.  \"What is it?\" cried Lydia, springing to her feet.  \"We don't know,\" gasped Dion. \"It's big--and black--and there's two of it. It's right out by the brush-pile.\"  \"We were just going to get an armful of brush,\" added Daphne, \"when all of a sudden there it was--right beside us! We didn't wait to see it any more. We just ran like everything!\"  Lydia poked the coals into a blaze and peered out into the surrounding darkness.  \"It was wolves, I'll go bail,\" cried Lycias, and he started at once to climb a tree.  \"Wolves!\" shrieked Chloe, and got behind her mistress. The Twins were already holding to her skirts.  \"Wolves!\" howled the slaves, \"a whole pack of them!\" and as there was nothing for them to climb, each hastily tried to get behind some one else. In the struggle Dromas got crowded back and sat down on a hot coal. He hadn't many clothes on, so he got up very quickly, and the next howl he gave was not wholly on account of wolves. Only Lydia and Melas stood their ground beside the fire. Melas waved a burning brand in the air and shouted at the top of his lungs, \"Fools! Rabbits! Don't you know wolves won't come near a fire?\" but nothing soothed the frightened slaves. Something was coming, and if it wasn't wolves, they thought it was likely to be a worse creature. They could see two black figures bounding along in the moonlight, and behind them came a huge dog, barking with all his might. Bang into the row of cowering slaves they ran, and the biggest black thing roared \"baa,\" and the little one bleated \"maa,\" right into Dromas' ear. The \"whole pack of wolves\" was just the old black ewe and her little black lamb. Argos was chasing them and when he came tearing into the circle about the fire and saw the sheep safe with Dromas, he sat down panting, with his tongue hanging out, and looked very much pleased with himself. Dromas seized the lamb in his arms.  \"It's a fine young ram,\" he cried, \"and it's nothing short of a miracle that the wolves haven't got it, and its mother too, long before this!'  \"I always said that old ewe was bewitched,\" quavered Lycias. \"It's magic, I say. And the lamb is as black as Erebus too. No good will come of this!\"  \"Come, come! We must take them up to the farm-yard at once,\" said Melas, \"before the old sheep takes it into her head to run away again. Dromas, you and Argos attend to her, and I'll carry the lamb myself.\"  \"We will all go,\" said Lydia. \"It is time for bed anyway.\" So the remains of the feast were gathered up, the fire was put out, and the whole company trailed back over the hill to the farm-house, Melas at the head of the procession, carrying the lamb in his arms. When the old sheep was corraled once more with the flock, and the slaves had gone home to their huts, Melas came in from the farm-yard with the lamb. He seemed strangely excited.  \"Light the fire on the hearth, wife,\" he said to Lydia. \"There's something queer about this lamb.\"  Lydia uncovered the coals, laid on some wood, and blew the fire to a blaze. By its light Melas examined the lamb carefully. Then he said to Lydia, who stood near with the Twins, \"This ram has but one horn!\"  \"It can't be!\" gasped Lydia. \"Whoever heard of a ram with only one horn?\"  \"Feel it,\" said Melas briefly. Lydia felt it.  \"By all the Gods,\" she cried, \"here is a strange thing!\"  \"Let us feel,\" begged Dion and Daphne. They both felt. There was only one little budding horn to be found, and that was right in the middle of the lamb's forehead.  \"What does it mean?\" cried Lydia. \"Is it a miracle? Is it a portent? Does it mean good luck or bad luck?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Melas. \"Only a priest could tell that.\"  \"Then take it to a priest,\" said Lydia.  \"It is not my sheep,\" said Melas. \"It belongs to Pericles.\"  \"Then you must take it to him and let him decide what shall be done with it,\" cried Lydia. \"And go soon, I beg of you. I don't wish to have the creature in the house. It may be bewitched. It may bring all kinds of bad luck to us.\"  \"It is just as likely to bring good luck as bad,\" said Melas.  \"Is Father really going to take the lamb to Athens?\" asked Dion.  \"Yes,\" answered Melas, with surprising promptness, \"to-morrow.\"  \"Oh,\" cried Dion and Daphne at the same instant, \"_please_ let me go too.\"  \"No,\" said Lydia at once, but Melas said, \"Not so fast, wife. Seek guidance of the Gods. The children would learn much from such a journey, and their chances for learning are few. We should be gone but two days, if the sea is calm.\"  Lydia was silent for a moment while the Twins stood by breathless with suspense. At last she said, \"Well,--if the Gods so will,--we will seek an omen. You could spend the night at the house of my brother, Phaon, the stone-cutter, I suppose. I have seen him but seldom since he married his Athenian wife, but no doubt he would make you welcome for the night.\"  She rose slowly as she spoke, and threw a handful of grain upon the family altar, at the same time praying to Hermes, the God of travelers, for guidance. Then she ran round the court with her hands over her ears, and as she came back to the group beside the hearth, suddenly uncovered them again. The Twins were talking together in low tones.  \"Oh, do you suppose they will let _me_ go?\" Daphne was saying to Dion, and just at that moment Lydia took her hands from her ears. \"Go\" was the first word she heard.  \"The omen is favorable,\" cried Lydia. \"You are to go! I prayed to Hermes, then closed my ears, well knowing that the first word I should hear when I uncovered them would be the answer to my prayer. That word was 'Go.' Hasten to bed, my children, for you must make an early start to-morrow.\"  Daphne could scarcely believe her ears. Not a word had been said about her staying at home because she was a girl! She flew upstairs to bed lest some one should suddenly think of it.     V  THE TWINS GO TO ATHENS   In the gray dawn of the following morning Lydia stood in the doorway of her house and watched the three figures disappear down the road toward the little seaport town of Ambelaca. Melas walked ahead, carrying the lamb wrapped in his cloak, and the Twins followed, bearing between them a basket in which Lydia had carefully packed two dressed fowls, some fresh eggs, and a cheese, to be taken to the home of Pericles, besides bread and cheese for Melas and the children. The Twins were so excited they would have danced along the road instead of walking if it hadn't been for the basket, but every time Daphne got too lively, Dion said, \"Remember the eggs,\" and every time Dion forgot and skipped, Daphne said the same thing to him.  They had gone nearly a mile in this way, when the road took them to the crest of a hill, from the top of which it seemed as if they could see the whole world. Just below them lay the little seaport town of Ambelaca, and beyond it the blue waters of the bay sparkled and danced in the morning breeze. On the farther side of the bay they could see the white buildings of the Piraeus, and beyond that in the distance was a chain of blue mountains over which the sun was just peeping. That sight was so beautiful that the children set down their basket, and Melas too stood still to gaze.  \"Those blue mountains beyond the Piraeus are the hills of Athens,\" said Melas. \"The one with the flat top is the sacred hill of the Acropolis. And right down there,\" he added, pointing to a white house on a near-by hill-top, overlooking the sea, \"is the house of Euripides, the Poet. He has come from the noise and confusion of the city "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9966"],["title","The Spartan Twins (#6)"],["body","find a quiet refuge upon Salamis.\"  \"Does he write real poetry?\" asked Daphne.  \"They say he does,\" answered Melas, \"though I never read any of it myself.\"  \"I wish I could write,\" sighed Daphne, \"even if it wasn't poetry! Even if it were only curses to hang around a scarecrow's neck. I'd like to write!\"  \"Girls don't need to know how to write,\" said Melas. \"It doesn't make them any better housekeepers. I don't even see how Dion is going to learn. There are no schools in Salamis.\"  \"Oh dear!\" thought Daphne, \"there it is again.\" But she said nothing and followed Melas down the hill and into the village street.  Soon they found themselves at the dock where the boat was tied. There were already passengers on board when the Twins and their Father arrived. There were two farmers with baskets of eggs and vegetables, and there was an old woman with a large bundle of bread. Next to her sat a fisherman with a basket of eels. They were all going to the market in the Piraeus to sell their produce. Melas with the lamb in his arms climbed in beside one of the farmers and sat facing the fisherman. Dion sat next to him with the basket on his knee, and Daphne had to sit beside the fisherman and the eels. The eels squirmed frightfully, and Daphne squirmed too every time she looked at them. She was afraid one might get out and wrap itself around her legs. They did look so horribly like snakes, and Daphne felt about snakes just as most girls do. However, she knew it was useless to say anything. There was no other seat for her, and so she remembered that she was a Spartan and tried not to look at them.  When they were all seated, the rowers took their places on the rowing-benches, the captain gave the signal, and off they went over the blue waters toward the distant shore. For a time everything went smoothly. There was no sound but the rattling of the oarlocks, the chant of the rowers as they dipped their oars, and the rippling of the water against the sides of the boat. Up to this time the black lamb had lain quietly in Melas' arms, but now something seemed to disturb him. He lifted his head, gave a sudden bleat, and somehow flung himself out of Melas' arms directly into the basket of eels! Such a squirming as there was then! The eels squirmed, and the lamb squirmed, and if his legs had not been securely tied together he undoubtedly would have flopped right into the water, and then this story would never have been written.  The fisherman gave an angry roar. \"Keep your miserable lamb out of my eel basket,\" he shouted.  Melas had not waited to be told. He had already seized the lamb, but it struggled hard to get away, and between the lamb and the eels there was a disturbance that threatened to upset the boat.  \"Sit still,\" roared the captain. \"Have you no sense? Do you all want to go to the bottom?\"  \"May Poseidon defend us!\" cried the old woman with the bread. \"I've no wish to be made into eel-bait.\"  \"Nor I,\" said one of the farmers angrily. \"You'd better kill your lambs before you take them to market,\" he said to Melas; \"it will be safer for the rest of us.\"  \"The lamb is not for market,\" Melas answered. \"I would not dare kill it. It bears a portent on its brow!\"  \"A portent?\" gasped the old woman.  \"May all the Gods defend us! What portent?\" Melas pointed to the horn. \"It has but one horn,\" he said.  They all became still at once. They all looked at the lamb. They all felt of his horn. Their eyes grew big.  \"There was never such a thing known,\" said the farmer.  \"Whose is the lamb?\" asked another. \"Is it yours?\"  \"No,\" said Melas, \"it belongs to Pericles the Archon. It was born on his farm. I am taking it to him so that he may decide what to do with it.\"  \"A portent on the farm of Pericles?\" cried the old woman. \"I'll warrant it will be read as favoring him, since he already has a world at his feet. May the Gods forgive me, but it seems to me they are often more partial than just.\"  \"Hush, woman,\" said one of the farmers. \"Speak no ill of the Gods, not until we are safe on the land at any rate.\"  The woman snapped her mouth shut. The farmers and the fisherman settled themselves as far away as possible from the Twins and Melas, and nothing more was said until the boat touched the other shore, and all the passengers scrambled out upon the dock. The farmers and the fisherman and the old woman all hastened away to the marketplace, and when they reached it, they must have kept their tongues busy, for as Melas and the Twins passed through it on their way to Athens a few moments later, they were followed by a crowd of curious people who wanted to see the lamb and who had a great deal to say about what such a miracle might mean.  Melas paid little attention to them, but hastened on his way, and soon they reached the eastern edge of the town and started along the paved road which ran from the Piraeus to Athens proper. This road was nearly five miles long and ran between two high walls of stone some distance apart. The curious crowd left them at this point and the three walked on alone through olive orchards and past little vineyards, toward Athens.  \"Nobody could get lost on this road,\" said Dion to his Father, \"not even if he tried! He couldn't get over the walls.\"  \"What are the walls for?\" asked Daphne. \"It seems silly to build high walls like this right out in the country.\"  \"Not so silly when you think about it,\" answered Melas. \"These walls were built by Pericles, so that if any enemy should make an invasion, Athens would always have a safe access to the sea. Without that she could be starved within her own walls in a very short time.\"  \"Pericles must be almost as powerful and wise as the Gods themselves, I should think,\" said Daphne.  \"He does all these things by the help of the Gods, without doubt,\" said Melas.  When they were halfway on their journey to the city, Dion suddenly let down his side of the basket with a thump.  \"Remember the eggs!\" cried Daphne sharply, but Dion did not seem to hear.  \"Look! Look!\" he cried and pointed toward the east. There against the sky, on the top of the sacred mountain, stood a gigantic figure shining in the sun.  \"What is it?\" cried both children at once.  \"That is the bronze statue of Athena, the Goddess who gives protection to Athens,\" said Melas.  \"Did Pericles make that too?\" asked Daphne.  Melas laughed. \"No,\" he said; \"you must not think Pericles made everything you may see in Athens. Great as he is, he is not a sculptor.\"  \"Oh, oh,\" cried Dion, \"I want to see the Gorgon's head with snaky locks. Don't you remember the Stranger said it was on the breastplate of the statue?\"  \"Ugh,\" said Daphne, shuddering. \"I don't believe I'd like it. It must look just like eels.\"  \"Come, come,\" said Melas. \"At this rate you won't have a chance. The day will be gone before we know it.\"  The Twins picked up the basket, and the three marched on toward the city, and it was not long before they had entered the gate and were passing along closely built-up streets to the home of the greatest man in Athens.  \"This is the place,\" said Melas at last, stopping at one of the houses.  \"This isn't Pericles' house, is it?\" cried Daphne. \"Why, I thought it would be the biggest house in Athens, and it looks just like the others.\"  \"Pericles does not put on much style,\" said Melas, as he lifted the knocker on the door. \"He is too great to need display. He cares more about fine public buildings for the city than about making his neighbors envious by living better than they do. Just get the idea out of your head that greatness means wealth and luxury, or you are no true Spartans, nor even good Athenians.\"  As he said this, Melas let the knocker fall. The door was immediately opened by a porter, who looked surprised when he saw Melas and the Twins.  \"What brings you in from the farm?\" he said.  \"I wish to see your mistress, the wife of Pericles,\" said Melas, with dignity. \"I have business of importance.\"  \"Come in, come in,\" said the porter, grinning good-naturedly; \"and you, too, little boys,\" he added graciously to the Twins, and led the way into the house. Dion was just opening his mouth to explain that Daphne wasn't a boy, but Daphne poked him in the ribs and shook her head at him. \"Let him think so,\" she said, jerking her chiton up shorter through her girdle.  They were ushered through a passageway into the court of the house, and there the porter left them while he went to call his mistress. The house, though little different from the other houses of well-to-do Athenians, was still much finer than anything the Twins had ever seen. The floor was of marble, and the altar of Zeus which stood in the center of the court was beautifully carved. The doorways which opened into the various rooms of the house were hung with blue curtains. A room opening into the court at the back had a hearth-fire in the middle of it, much like that in the children's own home. Soon a door in the back of the house opened, and Telesippe, the wife of Pericles, appeared. She was a large coarse-looking woman, and with her were three boys, her own two and Alcibiades, a handsome lad, who was a ward of Pericles and a member of his family.  Melas approached her and opened his cloak.  \"Why, Melas, what have you there?\" cried Telesippe in amazement, as she saw the little black rain.  \"A portent, Madam,\" said Melas with solemnity. \"This ram, born on your husband's farm, is a prodigy, it has but one horn. I have brought it to you, that the omen might be interpreted. I trust it may prove a favorable one.\"  Telesippe looked at the lamb and turned pale. She struck her hands together. The porter and another slave at once appeared.  \"Go to the temple and bring Lampon, the priest,\" she said to the slave; and to the porter she added, \"and you, the moment the priest arrives, call your master.\"  The slave instantly disappeared, and the porter went back to his post by the entrance. Although Telesippe was evidently disturbed and anxious about the portent, she"]]]
