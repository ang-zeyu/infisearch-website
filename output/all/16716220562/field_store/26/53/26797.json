He himself had the confident expression which always gave me confidence; the rattle on the conservatory roof was growing louder every minute.  \"I intend to find out,\" said he; \"and if the rain goes on long enough, we may still see Teddy playing when it stops. But I shall want your help, sir.\"  \"I am ready to go with you anywhere, Raffles.\"  \"You can only help me, Mr. Garland, by staying where you are.\"  \"Where I am?\"  \"In the house all day,\" said Raffles firmly. \"It is absolutely essential to my idea.\"  \"And that is, Raffles?\"  \"To save Teddy's face, in the first instance. I shall drive straight up to Lord's, in your brougham if I may. I know Studley rather well; he shall keep Teddy's place open till the last possible moment.\"  \"But how shall you account for his absence?\" I asked.  \"I shall account for it all right,\" said Raffles darkly. \"I can save his face for the time being, at all events at Lord's.\"  \"But that's the only place that matters,\" said I.  \"On the contrary, Bunny, this very house matters even more as long as Miss Belsize is here. You forget that they're engaged, and that she's in the next room now.\"  \"Good God!\" whispered Mr. Garland. \"I had forgotten that myself.\"  \"She is the last who must know of this affair,\" said Raffles, with, I thought, undue authority. \"And you are the only one who can keep it from her, sir.\"  \"I?\"  \"Miss Belsize mustn't go up to Lord's this morning. She would only spoil her things, and you may tell her from me that there would be no play for an hour after this, even if it stopped this minute, which it won't. Meanwhile let her think that Teddy's weatherbound with the rest of them in the pavilion; but she mustn't come until you hear from me again; and the best way to keep her here is to stay with her yourself.\"  \"And when may I expect to hear?\" asked Mr. Garland as Raffles held out his hand.  \"Let me see. I shall be at Lord's in less than twenty minutes; another five or ten should polish off Studley; and then I shall barricade myself in the telephone-box and ring up every hospital in town! You see, it may be an accident after all, though I don't think so. You won't hear from me on the point unless it is; the fewer messengers flying about the better, if you agree with me as to the wisdom of keeping the matter dark at this end.\"  \"Oh, yes, I agree with you, Raffles; but it will be a terribly hard task for me!\"  \"It will, indeed, Mr. Garland. Yet no news is always good news, and I promise to come straight to you the moment I have news of any kind.\"  With that they shook hands, our host with an obvious reluctance that turned to a less understandable dismay as I also prepared to take my leave of him.  \"What!\" cried he, \"am I to be left quite alone to hoodwink that poor girl and hide my own anxiety?\"  \"There's no reason why you should come, Bunny,\" said Raffles to me. \"If either of them is a one-man job, it's mine.\"  Our host said no more, but he looked at me so wistfully that I could not but offer to stay with him if he wished it; and when at length the drawing-room door had closed upon him and his son's _fiancee_, I took an umbrella from the stand and saw Raffles through the providential downpour into the brougham.  \"I'm sorry, Bunny,\" he muttered between the butler in the porch and the coachman on the box. \"This sort of thing is neither in my line nor yours, but it serves us right for straying from the path of candid crime. We should have opened a safe for that seven hundred.\"  \"But what do you really think is at the bottom of this extraordinary disappearance?\"  \"Some madness or other, I'm afraid; but if that boy is still in the land of the living, I shall have him before the sun goes down on his insanity.\"  \"And what about this engagement of his?\" I pursued. \"Do you disapprove of it?\"  \"Why on earth should I?\" asked Raffles, rather sharply, as he plunged from under my umbrella into the brougham.  \"Because you never told me when he told you,\" I replied. \"Is the girl beneath him?\"  Raffles looked at me inscrutably with his clear blue eyes.  \"You'd better find out for yourself,\" said he. \"Tell the coachman to hurry up to Lord's--and pray that this rain may last!\"     CHAPTER VI  Camilla Belsize   It would be hard to find a better refuge on a rainy day than the amphibious retreat described by Raffles as a \"country house in Kensington.\" There was a good square hall, full of the club comforts so welcome in a home, such as magazines and cigarettes, and a fire when the rain set in. The usual rooms opened off the hall, and the library was not the only one that led on into the conservatory; the drawing-room was another, in which I heard voices as I lit a cigarette among the palms and tree-ferns. It struck me that poor Mr. Garland was finding it hard work to propitiate the lady whom Raffles had deemed unworthy of mention overnight. But I own I was in no hurry to take over the invidious task. To me it need prove nothing more; to him, anguish; but I could not help feeling that even as matters stood I was quite sufficiently embroiled in these people's affairs. Their name had been little more than a name to me until the last few hours. Only yesterday I might have hesitated to nod to Teddy Garland at the club, so seldom had we met. Yet here was I helping Raffles to keep the worst about the son from the father's knowledge, and on the point of helping that father to keep what might easily prove worse still from his daughter-in-law to be. And all the time there was the worst of all to be hidden from everybody concerning Raffles and me!  Meanwhile I explored a system of flower-houses and vineries that ran out from the conservatory in a continuous chain--each link with its own temperature and its individual scent--and not a pane but rattled and streamed beneath the timely torrent. It was in a fernery where a playing fountain added its tuneful drop to the noisy deluge that the voices of the drawing-room sounded suddenly at my elbow, and I was introduced to Miss Belsize before I could recover from my surprise. My foolish face must have made her smile in spite of herself, for I did not see quite the same smile again all day; but it made me her admirer on the spot, and I really think she warmed to me for amusing her even for a moment.  So we began rather well; and that was a mercy in the light of poor Mr. Garland's cynically prompt departure; but we did not go on quite as well as we had begun. I do not say that Miss Belsize was in a bad temper, but emphatically she was not pleased, and I for one had the utmost sympathy with her displeasure. She was simply but exquisitely dressed, with unostentatious touches of Cambridge blue and a picture hat that really was a picture. Yet on a perfect stranger in a humid rockery she was wasting what had been meant for mankind at Lord's. The only consolation I could suggest was that by this time Lord's would be more humid still.  \"And so there's something to be said for being bored to tears under shelter, Miss Belsize.\" Miss Belsize did not deny that she was bored.  \"But there's plenty of shelter there,\" said she.  \"Packed with draggled dresses and squelching shoes! You might swim for it before they admitted you to that Pavilion, you know.\"  \"But if the ground's under water, how can they play to-day?\"  \"They can't, Miss Belsize, I don't mind betting.\"  That was a rash remark.  \"Then why doesn't Teddy come back?\"  \"Oh, well, you know,\" I hedged, \"you can never be quite absolutely sure. It might clear up. They're bound to give it a chance until the afternoon. And the players can't leave till stumps are drawn.\"  \"I should have thought Teddy could have come home to lunch,\" said Miss Belsize, \"even if he had to go back afterwards.\"  \"I shouldn't wonder if he did come,\" said I, conceiving the bare possibility: \"and A.J. with him.\"  \"Do you mean Mr. Raffles?\"  \"Yes, Miss Belsize; he's the only A.J. that counts!\"  Camilla Belsize turned slightly in the basket-chair to which she had confided her delicate frock, and our eyes met almost for the first time. Certainly we had not exchanged so long a look before, for she had been watching the torpid goldfish in the rockery pool, and I admiring her bold profile and the querulous poise of a fine head as I tried to argue her out of all desire for Lord's. Suddenly our eyes met, as I say, and hers dazzled me; they were soft and yet brilliant, tender and yet cynical, calmly reckless, audaciously sentimental--all that and more as I see them now on looking back; but at the time I was merely dazzled.  \"So you and Mr. Raffles are great friends?\" said Miss Belsize, harking back to a remark of Mr. Garland's in introducing us.  \"Rather!\" I replied.  \"Are you as great a friend of his as Teddy is?\"  I liked that, but simply said I was an older friend. \"Raffles and I were at school together,\" I added loftily.  \"Really? I should have thought he was before your time.\"  \"No, only senior to me. I happened to be his fag.\"  \"And what sort of a schoolboy was Mr. Raffles?\" inquired Miss Belsize, not by any means in the tone of a devotee. But I reflected that her own devotion was bespoke, and not improbably tainted with some little jealousy of Raffles.  \"He was the most Admirable Crichton who was ever at the school,\" said I: \"captain of the eleven, the fastest man in the fifteen, athletic champion, and an ornament of the Upper Sixth.\"  \"And you worshipped him, I suppose?\"  \"Absolutely.\"  My companion had been taking renewed interest in the goldfish; now she looked at me again with the cynical light full on in her eyes.  \"You must be rather disappointed in him now!\"  \"Disappointed! Why?\" I asked with much outward amusement. But I was beginning to feel uncomfortable.  \"Of course I don't know much about him,\" remarked Miss Belsize as though she"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9807"],["title","Scarhaven Keep (#0)"],["body","Proofreaders                                        SCARHAVEN KEEP                              BY J.S.

For at any rate forty-six weeks of the fifty-two, theatrical companies came and went at Norcaster with unfailing regularity. The company which presented itself for patronage in the first week of April in one year was almost certain to present itself again in the corresponding week of the next year. Sometimes new faces came with it, but as a rule the same old favourites showed themselves for a good many years in succession. And every actor and actress who came to Norcaster knew Jerramy. He was the first official person encountered on entering upon the business of the week. He it was who handed out the little bundles of letters and papers, who exchanged the first greetings, of whom one could make useful inquiries, who always knew exactly what advice to give about lodgings and landladies. From noon onwards of Mondays, when the newcomers began to arrive at the theatre for the customary one o'clock call for rehearsal, Jerramy was invariably employed in hearing that he didn't look a day older, and was as blooming as ever, and sure to last another thirty years, and his reception always culminated in a hearty handshake and genial greeting from the great man of the company, who, of course, after the fashion of magnates, always turned up at the end of the irregular procession, and was not seldom late for the fixture which he himself had made.  At a quarter past one of a certain Monday afternoon in the course of a sunny October, Jerramy leaned over the half-door of his sanctum in conversation with an anxious-eyed man who for the past ten minutes had hung about in the restless fashion peculiar to those who are waiting for somebody. He had looked up the street and down the street a dozen times; he had pulled out his watch and compared it with the clock of a neighbouring church almost as often; he had several times gone up the dark passage which led to the dressing-rooms, and had come back again looking more perplexed than ever. The fact was that he was the business manager of the great Mr. Bassett Oliver, who was opening for the week at Norcaster in his latest success, and who, not quite satisfied with the way in which a particular bit of it was being played called a special rehearsal for a quarter to one. Everything and everybody was ready for that rehearsal, but the great man himself had not arrived. Now Mr. Bassett Oliver, as every man well knew who ever had dealings with him, was not one of the irregular and unpunctual order; on the contrary, he was a very martinet as regarded rule, precision and system; moreover, he always did what he expected each member of his company to do. Therefore his non-arrival, his half hour of irregularity, seemed all the more extraordinary.  \"Never knew him to be late before--never!\" exclaimed the business manager, impatiently pulling out his watch for the twentieth time. \"Not in all my ten years' experience of him--not once.\"  \"I suppose you've seen him this morning, Mr. Stafford?\" inquired Jerramy. \"He's in the town, of course?\"  \"I suppose he's in the town,\" answered Mr. Stafford. \"I suppose he's at his old quarters--the 'Angel.' But I haven't seen him; neither had Rothwell--we've both been too busy to call there. I expect he came on to the 'Angel' from Northborough yesterday.\"  Jerramy opened the half-door, and going out to the end of the passage, looked up and down the street.  \"There's a taxi-cab coming round the corner now,\" he announced presently. \"Coming quick, too--I should think he's in it.\"  The business manager bustled out to the pavement as the cab came to a halt. But instead of the fine face and distinguished presence of Mr. Bassett Oliver, he found himself confronting a young man who looked like a well-set-up subaltern, or a cricket-and-football loving undergraduate; a somewhat shy, rather nervous young man, scrupulously groomed, and neatly attired in tweeds, who, at sight of the two men on the pavement, immediately produced a card-case.  \"Mr. Bassett Oliver?\" he said inquiringly. \"Is he here? I--I've got an appointment with him for one o'clock, and I'm sorry I'm late--my train--\"  \"Mr. Oliver is not here yet,\" broke in Stafford. \"He's late, too--unaccountably late, for him. An appointment, you say?\"  He was looking the stranger over as he spoke, taking him for some stage-struck youth who had probably persuaded the good-natured actor to give him an interview. His expression changed, however; as he glanced at the card which the young man handed over, and he started a little and held out his hand with a smile.  \"Oh!--Mr. Copplestone?\" he exclaimed. \"How do you do? My name's Stafford--I'm Mr. Oliver's business manager. So he made an appointment with you, did he--here, today? Wants to see you about your play, of course.\"  Again he looked at the newcomer with a smiling interest, thinking secretly that he was a very youthful and ingenuous being to have written a play which Bassett Oliver, a shrewd critic, and by no means easy to please, had been eager to accept, and was about to produce. Mr. Richard Copplestone, seen in the flesh, looked very young indeed, and very unlike anything in the shape of a professional author. In fact he very much reminded Stafford of the fine and healthy young man whom one sees on the playing fields, and certainly does not associate with pen and ink. That he was not much used to the world on whose edge he just then stood Stafford gathered from a boyish trick of blushing through the tan of his cheeks.  \"I got a wire from Mr. Oliver yesterday--Sunday,\" replied Mr. Copplestone. \"I ought to have had it in the morning, I suppose, but I'd gone out for the day, you know--gone out early. So I didn't find it until I got back to my rooms late at night. I got the next train I could from King's Cross, and it was late getting in here.\"  \"Then you've practically been travelling all night?\" remarked Stafford. \"Well, Mr. Oliver hasn't turned up--most unusual for him. I don't know where--\" Just then another man came hurrying down the passage from the dressing-rooms, calling the business manager by name.  \"I say, Stafford!\" he exclaimed, as he emerged on the street. \"This is a queer thing!--I'm sure there's something wrong. I've just rung up the 'Angel' hotel. Oliver hasn't turned up there! His rooms were all ready for him as usual yesterday, but he never came. They've neither seen nor heard of him. Did you see him yesterday?\"  \"No!\" replied Stafford. \"I didn't. Never seen him since last thing Saturday night at Northborough. He ordered this rehearsal for one--no, a quarter to one, here, today. But somebody must have seen him yesterday. Where's his dresser--where's Hackett?\"  \"Hackett's inside,\" said the other man. \"He hasn't seen him either, since Saturday night. Hackett has friends living in these parts--he went off to see them early yesterday morning, from Northborough, and he's only just come. So he hasn't seen Oliver, and doesn't know anything about him; he expected, of course, to find him here.\"  Stafford turned with a wave of the hand towards Copplestone.  \"So did this gentleman,\" he said. \"Mr. Copplestone, this is our stage-manager, Mr. Rothwell. Rothwell, this is Mr. Richard Copplestone, author of the new play that Mr. Oliver's going to produce next month. Mr. Copplestone got a wire from him yesterday, asking him to come here today at one o'clock, He's travelled all night to get here.\"  \"Where was the wire sent from?\" asked Rothwell, a sharp-eyed, keen-looking man, who, like Stafford, was obviously interested in the new author's boyish appearance. \"And when?\"  Copplestone drew some letters and papers from his pocket and selected one. \"That's it,\" he said. \"There you are--sent off from Northborough at nine-thirty, yesterday morning--Sunday.\"  \"Well, then he was at Northborough at that time,\" remarked Rothwell. \"Look here, Stafford, we'd better telephone to Northborough, to his hotel. The 'Golden Apple,' wasn't it?\"  \"No good,\" replied Stafford, shaking his head. \"The 'Golden Apple' isn't on the 'phone--old-fashioned place. We'd better wire.\"  \"Too slow,\" said Rothwell. \"We'll telephone to the theatre there, and ask them to step across and make inquiries. Come on!--let's do it at once.\"  He hurried inside again, and Stafford turned to Copplestone.  \"Better send your cab away and come inside until we get some news,\" he said. \"Let Jerramy take your things into his sanctum--he'll keep an eye on them till you want them--I suppose you'll stop at the 'Angel' with Oliver. Look here!\" he went on, turning to the cab driver, \"just you wait a bit--I might want you; wait ten minutes, anyway. Come in, Mr. Copplestone.\"  Copplestone followed the business manager up the passage to a dressing-room, in which a little elderly man was engaged in unpacking trunks and dress-baskets."]]]
