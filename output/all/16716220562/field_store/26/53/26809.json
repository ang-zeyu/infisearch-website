Then, more impulsively, the girl slips down from the bench, and sits by him on the around._) Do you think I shall make as good a match as my sisters, Guido? Do you think some great rich nobleman will marry me very soon? And shall I like the court! What shall I see there?  GUIDO Marvels. I think--yes, I am afraid that you will like them.  GRACIOSA And Duke Alessandro--shall I like him?  GUIDO Few courtiers have expressed dislike of him in my presence.  GRACIOSA Do you like him? Does he too buy lavishly?  GUIDO Eh, madonna! some day, when you have seen his jewels--  GRACIOSA Oh! I shall see them when I go to court?  GUIDO Yes, he will show them to you, I think, without fail, for the Duke loves beauty in all its forms. So he will take pleasure in confronting the brightness of your eyes with the brightness of the four kinds of sapphires, of the twelve kinds of rubies, and of many extraordinary pearls--  GRACIOSA (_With eyes shining, and lips parted._) Oh!  GUIDO And you will see his famous emerald necklace, and all his diamonds, and his huge turquoises, which will make you ashamed of your poor talisman--  GRACIOSA He will show all these jewels to me!  GUIDO (_Looking at her, and still smiling thoughtfully._) He will show you the very finest of his gems, assuredly. And then, worse still, he will be making verses in your honor.  GRACIOSA It would be droll to have a great duke making songs about me!  GUIDO It is a preposterous feature of Duke Alessandro's character that he is always making songs about some beautiful thing or another.  GRACIOSA Such strange songs, Guido! I was singing over one of them just before you came,--      Let me have dames and damsels richly clad       To feed and tend my mirth,     Singing by day and night to make me glad--  But I could not quite understand it. Are his songs thought good?  GUIDO The songs of a reigning duke are always good.  GRACIOSA And is he as handsome as people report?  GUIDO Tastes differ, of course--  GRACIOSA And is he--?  GUIDO I have a portrait of the Duke. It does not, I think, unduly flatter him. Will you look at it?  GRACIOSA Yes, yes!  GUIDO (_Drawing out a miniature on a chain._) Here is the likeness.  GRACIOSA But how should you--?  GUIDO (_Seeing her surprise._) Oh, it was a gift to me from his highness for a special service I did him, and as such must be treasured.  GRACIOSA Perhaps, then, I shall see yon at court, Messer Guido, who are the friend of princes?  GUIDO If you do, I ask only that in noisy Florence you remember this quiet garden.  GRACIOSA (_Looks at him silently, then glances at the portrait. She speaks with evident disappointment._) Is this the Duke?  GUIDO You may see his arms on it, and on the back his inscription.  GRACIOSA Yes, but--(_looking at the portrait again_)--but ... he is ... so ...  GUIDO You are astonished at his highness' coloring? That he inherits from his mother. She was, you know, a blackamoor.  GRACIOSA And my sisters wrote me he was like a god!  GUIDO Such observations are court etiquette.  GRACIOSA (_With an outburst of disgust._) Take it back! Though how can you bear to look at it, far less to have it touching you! And only yesterday I was angry because I had not seen the Duke riding past!  GUIDO Seen him! here! riding past!  GRACIOSA Old Ursula told me that the Duke had gone by with twenty men, riding down toward the convent at the border. And I flung my sewing-bag straight at her head because she had not called me.  GUIDO That was idle gossip, I fancy. The Duke rarely rides abroad without my--(_he stops_)--without my lavish patron Eglamore, the friend of all honest merchants.  GRACIOSA But that abominable Eglamore may have been with him. I heard nothing to the contrary.  GUIDO True, madonna, true. I had forgotten you did not see them.  GRACIOSA No. What is he like, this Eglamore? Is he as appalling to look at as the Duke?  GUIDO Madonna! but wise persons do not apply such adjectives to dukes. And wise persons do not criticize Count Eglamore's appearance, either, now that Eglamore is indispensable to the all-powerful Duke of Florence.  GRACIOSA Indispensable?  GUIDO It is thanks to the Eglamore whom you hate that the Duke has ample leisure to indulge in recreations which are reputed to be--curious.  GRACIOSA I do not understand you, Guido.  GUIDO That is perhaps quite as well. (_Attempting to explain as much as is decently expressible._) To be brief, madonna, business annoys the Duke.  GRACIOSA Why?  GUIDO It interferes with the pursuit of all the beautiful things he asks for in that song.  GRACIOSA But how does that make Eglamore indispensable?  GUIDO Eglamore is an industrious person who affixes seals, and signs treaties, and musters armies, and collects revenues, upon the whole, quite as efficiently as Alessandro would be capable of doing these things.  GRACIOSA So Duke Alessandro merely makes verses?  GUIDO And otherwise amuses himself as his inclinations prompt, while Eglamore rules Tuscany--and the Tuscans are none the worse off on account of it. (_He rises, and his hand goes to the dagger at his belt._) But is not that a horseman?  GRACIOSA (_She too has risen, and is now standing on the bench, looking over the wall._) A solitary rider, far down by the convent, so far away that he seems hardly larger than a scarlet dragon-fly.  GUIDO I confess I wish to run no risk of being found here, by your respected father or by your ingenious cousins and uncles.  GRACIOSA (_She turns, but remains standing upon the bench._) I think your Duke is much more dangerous looking than any of them. Heigho! I can quite foresee that I shall never fall in love with this Duke.  GUIDO A prince has means to overcome all obstacles.  GRACIOSA No. It is unbefitting and a little cowardly for Duke Alessandro to shirk the duties of his station for verse-making and eternal pleasure-seeking. Now if I were Duke--  GUIDO What would you do?  GRACIOSA (_Posturing a little as she stands upon the bench._) If I were duke? Oh ... I would grant my father a pension ... and I would have Eglamore hanged ... and I would purchase a new gown of silvery green--  GUIDO In which you would be very ravishingly beautiful.  _His tone has become rather ardent, and he is now standing nearer to her than the size of the garden necessitates. So GRACIOSA demurely steps down from the bench, and sits at the far end._  GRACIOSA And that is all I can think of. What would you do if you were duke, Messer Guido?  GUIDO (_Who is now sitting beside her at closer quarters than the length of the bench quite strictly demands._) I? What would I do if I were a great lord instead of a tradesman! (_Softly._) I think you know the answer, madonna.  GRACIOSA Oh, you would make me your duchess, of course. That is quite understood. But I was speaking seriously, Guido.  GUIDO And is it not a serious matter that a pedler of crystals should have dared to love a nobleman's daughter?  GRACIOSA (_Delighted._) This is the first I have heard of it.  GUIDO But you are perfectly right. It is not a serious matter. That I worship you is an affair which does not seriously concern any person save me in any way whatsoever. Yet I think that knowledge of the fact would put your father to the trouble of sharpening his dagger.  GRACIOSA Ye-es. But not even Father would deny that you were showing excellent taste.  GUIDO Indeed, I am not certain that I do worship you; for in order to adore whole-heartedly the idolater must believe his idol to be perfect. (_Taking her hand._) Now your nails are of an ugly shape, like that of little fans. Your nose is nothing to boast of. And your mouth is too large. I do not admire these faults, for faults they are undoubtedly--  GRACIOSA Do they make me very ugly? I know that I have not a really good mouth, Guido, but do you think it is positively repulsive?  GUIDO No.... Then, too, I know that you are vain and self-seeking, and look forward contentedly to the time when your father will transfer his ownership of your physical attractions to that nobleman who offers the highest price for them.  GRACIOSA But we daughters of the poor Valori are compelled to marry--suitably. We have only the choice between that and the convent yonder.  GUIDO That is true, and nobody disputes it. Still, you participate in a monstrous bargain, and I would prefer to have you exhibit distaste for it.  _Bending forward, GUIDO draws from his jewel pack the string of pearls, and this he moodily contemplates, in order to evince his complete disinterestedness. The pose has its effect. GRACIOSA looks at him for a moment, rises, draws a deep breath, and speaks with a sort of humility._  GRACIOSA And to what end, Guido? What good would weeping do?  GUIDO (_Smiling whimsically._) I am afraid that men do not always love according to the strict laws of logic. (_He drops the pearls, and, rising, follows her._) I desire your happiness above all things, yet to see you so abysmally untroubled by anything which troubles me is--another matter.  GRACIOSA But I am not untroubled, Guido.  GUIDO No?  GRACIOSA No. (_Rather tremulously._) Sometimes I sit here dreading my life at court. I want never to leave my father's bleak house. I fear that I may not like the man who offers the highest price for me. And it seems as if the court were a horrible painted animal, dressed in bright silks, and shining with jewels, and waiting to devour me.  _Beyond the wall appears a hat of scarlet satin with a divided brim, which, rising, is revealed to surmount the head of an extraordinarily swarthy person, to whose dark skin much powder has only loaned the hue of death: his cheeks, however, are vividly carmined. This is all that the audience can now see of the young DUKE of FLORENCE, whose proximity the two in the garden are just now too much engrossed to notice._  _The DUKE looks from one to the other. His eyes narrow, his teeth are displayed in a wide grin; he now understands"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9829"],["title","The Jewel Merchants: A Comedy in One Act (#3)"],["body","situation. He lowers his head as GRACIOSA moves._  GRACIOSA No, I am not untroubled. For I cannot fathom you, and that troubles me. I am very fond of you--and yet I do not trust you.  GUIDO You know that I love you.  GRACIOSA You tell me so. It pleases me to have you say it--  GUIDO Madonna is candid this morning.  GRACIOSA Yes, I am candid. It does please me. And I know that for the sake of seeing me you endanger your life, for if my father heard of our meetings here he would have you killed.  GUIDO Would I incur such risks without caring?  GRACIOSA No,--and yet, somehow, I do not believe it is altogether for me that you care.  _The DUKE laughs. GUIDO starts, half drawing his dagger. GRACIOSA turns with an instinctive gesture of seeking protection. The DUKE'S head and shoulders appear above the wall._  THE DUKE And you will find, my friend, that the most charming women have just these awkward intuitions.  _The DUKE ascends the wall, while the two stand motionless and silent. When he is on top of the wall, GUIDO, who now remembers that omnipotence perches there, makes haste to serve it, and obsequiously assists the DUKE to descend. The DUKE then comes well forward, in smiling meditation, and hands first his gloves, then his scarlet cloak (which you now perceive to be lined with ermine and sable in four stripes) to GUIDO, who takes them as a servant would attend his master._  _The removal of this cloak reveals the DUKE to be clad in a scarlet satin doublet, which has a high military collar and sleeves puffed with black. His tights also are of scarlet, and he wears shining soft black riding-boots. Jewels glisten at his neck. About his middle, too, there is a metallic gleaming, for he is equipped with a noticeably long sword and a dagger. Such is the personage who now addresses himself more explicitly to GRACIOSA._  THE DUKE (_Sitting upon the bench, very much at his ease while the others stand uncomfortably before him._) Yes, madonna, I suspect that Eglamore here cares greatly for the fact that you are Balthazar Valori's daughter, and cousin to the late Marquis of Cibo.  GRACIOSA (_Just in bewilderment._) Eglamore!  THE DUKE For Cibo left many kinsmen. These still resent the circumstance that the matching of his wits against Eglamore's wits earned for Cibo an unpleasantly public death-bed. So they pursue their feud against Eglamore with vexatious industry. And Eglamore goes about in hourly apprehension of another falling beam, another knife-thrust in the back, or another plate of poison.  GRACIOSA (_She comprehends now._) Eglamore!  THE DUKE (_Who is pleased alike by Eglamore's neat plan and by his own cleverness in unriddling it._) But if rich Eglamore should make a stolen match with you, your father--good thrifty man!--could be appeased without much trouble. Your cousins, those very angry but penniless Valori, would not stay over-obdurate to a kinsman who had at his disposal so many pensions and public offices. Honor would permit a truce with their new cousin Eglamore, a truce very profitable to everybody.  GRACIOSA He said they must be bought somehow!  THE DUKE Yes, Eglamore could bind them all to his interest within ten days. All could be bought at a stroke by marrying you. And Eglamore would be rid of the necessity of sleeping in chain-armor. Have I not unraveled the scheme correctly, Eglamore?  GUIDO (_Smiling and deferential._) Your highness was never lacking in penetration.  _GRACIOSA, at this, turns puzzled from one man to the other._  GRACIOSA Are you--?  THE DUKE I am Alessandro de Medici, madonna.  GRACIOSA The Duke!  THE DUKE A sadly neglected prince, who wondered over the frequent absences of his chief counselor, and secretly set spies upon him. Eglamore here will attest as much--(_As GRACIOSA draws away from GUIDO_)--or if you cannot believe Eglamore any longer in anything, I shall have other witnesses within the half-hour. Yes, my twenty cut-throats are fetching back for me a brace of nuns from the convent yonder. I can imagine that, just now, my cut-throats will be in your opinion more trustworthy witnesses than is poor Eglamore. And my stout knaves will presently assure you that I am the Duke.  GUIDO (_Suavely._) It happens that not a moment ago we were admiring your highness' portrait.  GRACIOSA And so you are Count Eglamore. That is very strange. So it was the hand of Eglamore (_rubbing her hands as if to clean them_) that I touched just now. I thought it was the hand of my friend Guido. But I forget. There is no Guido. You are Eglamore. It is strange you should have been capable of so much wickedness, for to me you seem only a smirking and harmless lackey.  _The DUKE is watching as if at a play. He is aesthetically pleased by the girl's anguish. GUIDO winces. As GRACIOSA begins again to speak, they turn facing her, so that to the audience the faces of both men are invisible._  GRACIOSA And it was you who detected--so you said--the Marquis of Cibo's conspiracy. Tebaldeo was my cousin, Count Eglamore. I loved him. We were reared together. We used to play here in this garden. I remember how Tebaldeo once fetched me a wren's nest from that maple yonder. I stood just here. I was weeping, because I was afraid he would fall. If he had fallen, if he had been killed then, it would have been the luckier for him. They say that he conspired. I do not know. I only know that by your orders, Count Eglamore, my playmate Tebaldeo was fastened to a cross, like that (_pointing to the shrine_). I know that his arms and legs were each broken in two places with an iron bar. I know that this cross was then set upon a pivot, so that it turned slowly. I know that my dear Tebaldeo died very slowly in the sunlit marketplace, while the cross turned, and turned, and turned. I know this was a public holiday; the shopkeepers took holiday to watch him die, the boy who fetched me a wren's nest from yonder maple. And I know that you are Eglamore, who ordered these things done.  GUIDO I gave orders for the Marquis of Cibo's execution, as was the duty of my office. I did not devise the manner of his punishment. The punishment for Cibo's crime was long ago fixed by our laws. All who attack the Duke's person must die thus.  GRACIOSA (_Waves his excuses aside._) And then you plan this masquerade. You plan to make me care for you so greatly that even when I know you to be Count Eglamore I must still care for you. You plan to marry me, so as to placate Tebaldeo's kinsmen, so as to leave them--in your huckster's phrase--no longer unbought. It was a fine bold stroke of policy, I know, to use me as a stepping-stone to safety. But was it fair to me?  GUIDO Graciosa ... you shame me--  GRACIOSA Look you, Count Eglamore, I was only a child, playing here, alone, and not unhappy. Oh, was it fair, was it worth while to match your skill against my ignorance?  THE DUKE Fie, Donna Graciosa, you must not be too harsh with Eglamore--  GRACIOSA Think how unhappy I would be if even now I loved you, and how I would loathe myself!  THE DUKE It is his nature to scheme, and he weaves his plots as inevitably as the spider does her web--  GRACIOSA But I am getting angry over nothing. Nothing has happened except that I have dreamed--of a Guido. And there is no Guido. There is only an Eglamore, a lackey in attendance upon his master.  THE DUKE Believe me, it is wiser to forget this clever lackey--as I do--except when there is need of his services. I think that you have no more need to consider him--  _He takes the girl's hand. GRACIOSA now looks at him as though seeing him for the first time. She is vaguely frightened by this predatory beast, but in the main her emotion is as yet bewilderment._  THE DUKE For you are very beautiful, Graciosa. You are as slim as a lily, and more white. Your eyes are two purple mirrors in each of which I see a tiny image of Duke Alessandro. (_GUIDO takes a step forward, and the DUKE now addresses him affably._) Those nuns they are fetching me are big high-colored wenches with cheeks like apples. It is not desirable that women should be so large. Such women do not inspire a poet. Women should be little creatures that fear you. They should have thin plaintive voices, and in shrinking from you should be as slight to the touch as a cobweb. It is not possible to draw inspiration from a woman's beauty unless you comprehend how easy it would be to murder her.  GUIDO (_Softly, without expression._) God, God!  _The DUKE looks with delight at GRACIOSA, who stands bewildered and childlike._  THE DUKE You fear me, do you not, Graciosa? Your hand is soft and cold as the skin of a viper. When I touch it you shudder. I am very tired of women who love me, of women who are infatuated by my beauty. You, I can see, are not infatuated. To you my touch will always be a martyrdom, you will always loathe me. And therefore I shall not weary of you for a long while, because the misery and the helplessness of my lovely victim will incite me to make very lovely verses.  _He draws her to the bench, sitting beside her._  THE DUKE Yes, Graciosa, you will inspire me. Your father shall have all the wealth and state that even his greedy imaginings can devise, so long as you can contrive to loathe me. We will find you a suitable husband--say, in Eglamore here. You shall have flattery and titles, gold and fine glass, soft stuffs and superb palaces and many lovely jewels--  _The DUKE glances down at the pedler's pack._  THE DUKE But Eglamore also has been wooing you with jewels. You must see mine, dear Graciosa.  GRACIOSA (_Without expression._) Count Eglamore said that I must.  THE DUKE (_Raises the necklace, and lets it drop contemptuously._) Oh, not such trumpery as this. I have in Florence gems which have not their fellows anywhere, gems which have not even a name, and the value of which is incalculable. I have jewels engendered by the thunder, jewels taken from the heart of the Arabian deer. I have jewels cut from the brain of a toad, and from the"]]]
