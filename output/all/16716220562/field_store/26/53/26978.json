It is not healthful.\"  \"I've got a pretty good digestion, mother,\" said Robert, laughing. \"Nothing troubles me.\"  \"Still, you mustn't trifle with it. Do you remember, Robert,\" added his mother, soberly, \"it is just two years to-day since your poor father left us for Boston to take command of his ship?\"  \"So it is, mother; I had forgotten it.\"  \"I little thought then that I should never see him again!\" and Mrs. Rushton sighed.  \"It is strange we have never heard anything of the ship.\"  \"Not so strange, Robert. It must have gone down when no other vessel was in sight.\"  \"I wish we knew the particulars, mother. Sometimes I think father may have escaped from the ship in a boat, and may be still alive.\"  \"I used to think it possible, Robert; but I have given up all hopes of it. Two years have passed, and if your father were alive, we should have seen him or heard from him ere this.\"  \"I am afraid you are right. There's one thing I can't help thinking of, mother,\" said Robert, thoughtfully. \"How is it that father left no property? He received a good salary, did he not?\"  \"Yes; he had received a good salary for several years.\"  \"He did not spend the whole of it, did he?\"  \"No, I am sure he did not. Your father was never extravagant.\"  \"Didn't he ever speak to you on the subject?\"  \"He was not in the habit of speaking of his business; but just before he went away, I remember him telling me that he had some money invested, and hoped to add more to it during the voyage which proved so fatal to him.\"  \"He didn't tell you how much it was, nor how it was invested?\"  \"No; that was all he said. Since his death, I have looked everywhere in the house for some papers which would throw light upon it; but I have been able to find nothing. I do not care so much for myself, but I should be glad if you did not have to work so hard.\"  \"Never mind me, mother; I'm young and strong, I can stand work--but it's hard on you.\"  \"I am rich in having a good son, Robert.\"  \"And I in a good mother,\" said Robert, affectionately. \"And, now, to change the subject. I suspect I have incurred the enmity of Halbert Davis.\"  \"How is that?\" asked Mrs. Rushton.  \"I went home with Hester Paine, last evening, from writing school. Just as she had accepted my escort, Halbert came up, and in a condescending way, informed her that he would see her home.\"  \"What did she say?\"  \"She told him she was engaged to me. He said, coolly, that he would relieve me of the duty, but I declined his obliging offer. He looked mad enough, I can tell you. He's full of self-conceit, and I suppose he wondered how any one could prefer me to him.\"  \"I am sorry you have incurred his enmity.\"  \"I didn't lose any sleep by it.\"  \"You know his father is the superintendent of the factory.\"  \"Halbert isn't.\"  \"But he may prejudice his father against you, and get you discharged.\"  \"I don't think he would be quite so mean as that. We won't borrow trouble, mother. But time's up, and I must go.\"  Robert seized his hat and hurried to the mill. He was in his place when the great factory bell stopped ringing on the stroke of seven, and so escaped the fine, which would have cut off one-quarter of a day's pay.  Meanwhile, Halbert Davis had passed an uncomfortable and restless night. He had taken a fancy to Hester Paine, and he had fully determined to escort her home on the previous evening. As she was much sought after among her young companions, it would have gratified his pride to have it known that she had accepted his company. But he had been cut out, and by Robert Rushton--one of his father's factory hands. This made his jealousy more intolerable, and humiliated his pride, and set him to work devising schemes for punishing Robert's presumption. He felt that it was Robert's duty, even though he had been accepted, to retire from the field as soon as his, Halbert's, desire was known. This Robert had expressly declined to do, and Halbert felt very indignant. He made up his mind that he would give Robert a chance to apologize, and if he declined to do so he would do what he could to get him turned out of the factory.  At twelve o'clock the factory bell pealed forth a welcome sound to the hundreds who were busily at work within the great building. It was the dinner hour, and a throng of men, women and children poured out of the great portals and hastened to their homes or boarding houses to dine. Among them was Robert Rushton. As he was walking homeward with his usual quick, alert step, he came upon Halbert Davis, at the corner of the street.  Halbert was dressed carefully, and, as usual, was swinging his cane in his gloved hand. Robert would have passed him with a nod, but Halbert, who was waiting for him, called out:  \"I say, you fellow, stop a minute. I want to speak to you.\"  \"Are you addressing me?\" asked Robert, with a pride as great as his own.  \"Yes.\"  \"Then you had better mend your manners.\"  \"What do you mean?\" demanded Halbert, his sallow face slightly flushing.  \"My name is Robert Rushton. Call me by either of these names when you speak to me, and don't say 'you fellow.'\"  \"It seems to me,\" sneered Halbert, \"that you are putting on airs for a factory boy.\"  \"I am a factory boy, I acknowledge, and am not ashamed to acknowledge it. Is this all you have to say to me? If so, I will pass on, as I am in haste.\"  \"I have something else to say to you. You were impudent to me last evening.\"  \"Was I? Tell me how.\"  \"Did you not insist on going home with Hester Paine, when I had offered my escort?\"  \"What of that?\"  \"You forget your place.\"  \"My place was at Hester Paine's side, since she had accepted my escort.\"  \"It was very presumptuous in a factory boy like you offering your escort to a young lady like Miss Paine.\"  \"I don't see it,\" said Robert, independently; \"and I don't think it struck Hester in that light. We had a very agreeable walk.\"  Halbert was provoked and inflamed with jealousy, and the look with which he regarded our hero was by no means friendly.  \"You mustn't regard yourself as Miss Paine's equal because she condescended to walk with you,\" he said. \"You had better associate with those of your own class hereafter, and not push yourself in where your company is not agreeable.\"  \"Keep your advice to yourself, Halbert Davis,\" said Robert, hotly, for he felt the insult conveyed in these words. \"If I am a factory boy I don't intend to submit to your impertinence; and I advise you to be careful what you say. As to Miss Hester Paine, I shall not ask your permission to walk with her, but shall do so whenever she chooses to accept my escort. Has she authorized you to speak for her?\"  \"No; but----\"  \"Then wait till she does.\"  Halbert was so incensed that, forgetting Robert's superior strength, evident enough to any one who saw the two, one with his well-knit, vigorous figure, the other slender and small of frame, he raised his cane and struck our hero smartly upon the arm.  In a moment the cane was wrested from his grasp and applied to his own person with a sharp, stinging blow which broke the fragile stick in two.  Casting the pieces upon the ground at his feet, Robert said, coolly:  \"Two can play at that game, Halbert Davis. When you want another lesson come to me.\"  He passed his discomfited antagonist and hastened to the little cottage, where his mother was wondering what made him so much behind time.     CHAPTER III.   THE SPECIAL DEPOSIT.  Stung with mortification and more incensed against Robert than ever, Halbert hastened home. The house in which he lived was the largest and most pretentious in Millville--a large, square house, built in modern style, and with modern improvements, accessible from the street by a semi-circular driveway terminating in two gates, one at each end of the spacious lawn that lay in front. The house had been built only three years, and was the show-place of the village.  Halbert entered the house, and throwing his hat down on a chair in the hall, entered the dining-room, his face still betraying his angry feelings.  \"What's the matter, Halbert?\" asked his mother, looking up as he entered.  \"Do you see this?\" said Halbert, displaying the pieces of his cane.  \"How did you break it?\"  \"I didn't break it.\"  \"How came it broken, then?\"  \"Robert Rushton broke it.\"  \"The widow Rushton's son?\"  \"Yes; he's a low scoundrel,\" said Halbert bitterly.  \"What made him break it?\"  \"He struck me with it hard enough to break it, and then threw the pieces on the ground. I wouldn't mind it so much if he were not a low factory boy, unworthy of a gentleman's attention.\"  \"How dared he touch you?\" asked Mrs. Davis, angrily.  \"Oh, he's impudent enough for anything. He walked home with Hester Paine last evening from the writing school. I suppose she didn't know how to refuse him. I met him just now and told him he ought to know his place better than to offer his escort to a young lady like Hester. He got mad and struck me.\"  \"It was very proper advice,\" said Mrs. Davis, who resembled her son in character and disposition, and usually sided with him in his quarrels. \"I should think Hester would have more sense than to encourage a boy in his position.\"  \"I have no doubt she was bored by his company,\" said Halbert, who feared on the contrary that Hester was only too well pleased with his rival, and hated him accordingly; \"only she was too good-natured to say so.\"  \"The boy must be a young brute to turn upon you so violently.\"  \"That's just what he is.\"  \"He ought to be punished for it.\"  \"I'll tell you how it can be done,\" said Halbert. \"Just you speak to father about it, and get him dismissed from the factory.\"  \"Then he is employed in the factory?\"  \"Yes. He and his mother are as poor as poverty, and that's about all they have to live upon; yet "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9990"],["title","Brave and Bold; Or, The Fortunes of Robert Rushton (#2)"],["body","goes round with his head up as if he were a prince, and thinks himself good enough to walk home with Hester Paine.\"  \"I never heard of anything so ridiculous.\"  \"Then you'll speak to father about it, won't you?\"  \"Yes; I'll speak to him to-night. He's gone away for the day.\"  \"That'll pay me for my broken cane,\" said Halbert, adding, in a tone of satisfaction: \"I shall be glad to see him walking round the streets in rags. Perhaps he'll be a little more respectful then.\"  Meanwhile Robert decided not to mention to his mother his encounter with the young aristocrat. He knew that it would do no good, and would only make her feel troubled. He caught the malignant glance of Halbert on parting, and he knew him well enough to suspect that he would do what he could to have him turned out of the factory. This would certainly be a serious misfortune.  Probably the entire income upon which his mother and himself had to depend did not exceed eight dollars a week, and of this he himself earned six. They had not more than ten dollars laid by for contingencies, and if he were deprived of work, that would soon melt away. The factory furnished about the only avenue of employment open in Millville, and if he were discharged it would be hard to find any other remunerative labor.  At one o'clock Robert went back to the factory rather thoughtful. He thought it possible that he might hear something before evening of the dismission which probably awaited him, but the afternoon passed and he heard nothing.  On leaving the factory, he chanced to see Halbert again on the sidewalk a little distance in front and advancing toward him. This time, however, the young aristocrat did not desire a meeting, for, with a dark scowl, he crossed the street in time to avoid it.  \"Is he going to pass it over, I wonder?\" thought Robert. \"Well, I won't borrow trouble. If I am discharged I think I can manage to pick up a living somehow. I've got two strong arms, and if I don't find something to do, it won't be for the want of trying.\"  Two years before, Captain Rushton, on the eve of sailing upon what proved to be his last voyage, called in the evening at the house of Mr. Davis, the superintendent of the Millville factory. He found the superintendent alone, his wife and Halbert having gone out for the evening. He was seated at a table with a variety of papers spread out before him. These papers gave him considerable annoyance. He was preparing his semi-annual statement of account, and found himself indebted to the corporation in a sum three thousand dollars in excess of the funds at his command. He had been drawn into the whirlpool of speculation, and, through a New York broker, had invested considerable amounts in stocks, which had depreciated in value. In doing this he had made use, to some extent, of the funds of the corporation, which he was now at a loss how to replace. He was considering where he could apply for a temporary loan of three thousand dollars when the captain entered. Under the circumstances he was sorry for the intrusion.  \"Good-evening, Captain Rushton,\" he said, with a forced smile. \"Sit down. I am glad to see you.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Davis. It will be the last call I shall make upon you for a considerable time.\"  \"Indeed--how is that?\"  \"I sail to-morrow for Calcutta.\"  \"Indeed--that is a long voyage.\"  \"Yes, it takes considerable time. I don't like to leave my wife and boy for so long, but we sailors have to suffer a good many privations.\"  \"True; I hardly think I should enjoy such a life.\"  \"Still,\" said the captain, \"it has its compensations. I like the free, wild life of the sea. The ocean, even in its stormiest aspects, has a charm for me.\"  \"It hasn't much for me,\" said the superintendent, shrugging his shoulders. \"Seasickness takes away all the romance that poets have invested it with.\"  Captain Rushton laughed.  \"Seasickness!\" he repeated. \"Yes, that is truly a disagreeable malady. I remember once having a lady of rank as passenger on board my ship--a Lady Alice Graham. She was prostrated by seasickness, which is no respecter of persons, and a more forlorn, unhappy mortal I never expect to see. She would have been glad, I am convinced, to exchange places with her maid, who seemed to thrive upon the sea air.\"  \"I wish you a prosperous voyage, captain.\"  \"Thank you. If things go well, I expect to come home with quite an addition to my little savings. And that brings me to the object of my visit this evening. You must know, Mr. Davis, I have saved up in the last ten years a matter of five thousand dollars.\"  \"Five thousand dollars!\" repeated the superintendent, pricking up his ears.  \"Yes, it has been saved by economy and self-denial. Wouldn't my wife be surprised if she knew her husband were so rich?\"  \"Your wife doesn't know of it?\" asked the superintendent, surprised.  \"Not at all. I have told her I have something, and she may suppose I have a few hundred dollars, but I have never told her how much. I want to surprise her some day.\"  \"Just so.\"  \"Now, Mr. Davis, for the object of my errand. I am no financier, and know nothing of investments. I suppose you do. I want you to take this money, and take care of it, while I am gone on my present voyage. I meant to make inquiries myself for a suitable investment, but I have been summoned by my owners to leave at a day's notice, and have no time for it. Can you oblige me by taking care of the money?\"  \"Certainly, captain,\" said the superintendent, briskly. \"I shall have great pleasure in obliging an old friend.\"  \"I am much obliged to you.\"  \"Don't mention it. I have large sums of my own to invest, and it is no extra trouble to look after your money. Am I to pay the interest to your wife?\"  \"No. I have left a separate fund in a savings bank for her to draw upon. As I told you, I want to surprise her by and by. So not a word, if you please, about this deposit.\"  \"Your wishes shall be regarded,\" said the superintendent. \"Have you brought the money with you?\"  \"Yes,\" said the captain, drawing from his pocket a large wallet. \"I have got the whole amount here in large bills. Count it, if you please, and see that it is all right.\"  The superintendent took the roll of bills from the hands of his neighbor, and counted them over twice.  \"It is quite right,\" he said. \"Here are five thousand dollars. Now let me write you a receipt for them.\"  He drew before him a sheet of paper, and dipping his pen in the inkstand, wrote a receipt in the usual form, which he handed back to the captain, who received it and put it back in his wallet.  \"Now,\" said the captain, in a tone of satisfaction, \"my most important business is transacted. You will keep this money, investing it according to your best judgment. If anything should happen to me,\" he added, his voice faltering a little, \"you will pay it over to my wife and child.\"  \"Assuredly,\" said the superintendent; \"but don't let us think of such a sad contingency. I fully expect to pay it back into your own hands with handsome interest.\"  \"Let us hope so,\" said the captain, recovering his cheerfulness. \"Our destinies are in the hands of a kind Providence. And now good-by! I leave early to-morrow morning, and I must pass the rest of the evening with my own family.\"  \"Good-night, captain,\" said the superintendent, accompanying him to the door. \"I renew my wish that you have a prosperous and profitable voyage, and be restored in good time to your family and friends.\"  \"Amen!\" said the captain.  The superintendent went back to his study, his heart lightened of its anxiety.  \"Could anything be more fortunate?\" he ejaculated, \"This help comes to me just when it is most needed. Thanks to my special deposit, I can make my semi-annual settlement, and have two thousand dollars over. It's lucky the captain knows nothing of my Wall Street speculations. He might not have been quite so ready to leave his money in my hands. It's not a bad thing to be a banker,\" and he rubbed his hands together with hilarity.     CHAPTER IV.   THE VOICE OF CONSCIENCE.  When the superintendent accepted Captain Rushton's money, he did not intend to act dishonestly. He hailed it as a present relief, though he supposed he should have to repay it some time. His accounts being found correct, he went on with his speculations. In these he met with varying success. But on the whole he found himself no richer, while he was kept in a constant fever of anxiety.  After some months, he met Mrs. Rushton in the street one day.  \"Have you heard from your husband, Mrs. Rushton?\" he inquired.  \"No, Mr. Davis, not yet. I am beginning to feel anxious.\"  \"How long has he been gone?\"  \"Between seven and eight months.\"  \"The voyage is a long one. There are many ways of accounting for his silence.\"  \"He would send by some passing ship. He has been to Calcutta before, but I have never had to wait so long for a letter.\"  The superintendent uttered some commonplace phrases of assurance, but in his own heart there sprang up a wicked hope that the _Norman_ would never reach port, and that he might never set eyes on Captain Rushton again. For in that case, he reflected, it would be perfectly safe for him to retain possession of the money with which he had been intrusted. The captain had assured him that neither his wife nor son knew aught of his savings. Who then could detect his crime? However, it was not yet certain that the _Norman_ was lost. He might yet have to repay the money.  Six months more passed, and still no tidings of the ship or its commander. Even the most sanguine now gave her up for lost, including the owners. The superintendent called upon them, ostensibly in behalf of Mrs. Rushton, and learned that they had but slender hopes of her safety. It was a wicked thing to rejoice over such a calamity, but his affairs were now so entangled that a sudden demand for the five thousand dollars would have ruined him. He made up his mind to say nothing of the special deposit, though he knew the loss of it would"]]]
