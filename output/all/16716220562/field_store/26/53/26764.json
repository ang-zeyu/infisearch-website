King of Granada! this is the counsel of Muza Ben Abil Gazan.\"  The prince ceased.  But he, whose faintest word had once breathed fire into the dullest, had now poured out his spirit upon frigid and lifeless matter.  No man answered--no man moved.  Boabdil alone, clinging to the shadow of hope, turned at last towards the audience.  \"Warriors and sages!\" he said, \"as Muza's counsel is your king's desire, say but the word, and, ere the hour-glass shed its last sand, the blast of our trumpet shall be ringing through the Vivarrambla.\"  \"O king! fight not against the will of fate--God is great!\" replied the chief of the alfaquis.  \"Alas!\" said Abdelmelic, \"if the voice of Muza and your own falls thus coldly upon us, how can ye stir the breadless and heartless multitude?\"  \"Is such your general thought and your general will?\" said Boabdil.  An universal murmur answered, \"Yes!\"  \"Go then, Abdelmelic;\" resumed the ill-starred king; \"go with yon Spaniards to the Christian camp, and bring us back the best terms you can obtain.  The crown has passed from the head of El Zogoybi; Fate sets her seal upon my brow.  Unfortunate was the commencement of my reign-- unfortunate its end.  Break up the divan.\"  The words of Boabdil moved and penetrated an audience, never till then so alive to his gentle qualities, his learned wisdom, and his natural valour.  Many flung themselves at his feet, with tears and sighs; and the crowd gathered round to touch the hem of his robe.  Muza gazed at them in deep disdain, with folded arms and heaving breast.  \"Women, not men!\" he exclaimed, \"ye weep, as if ye had not blood still left to shed!  Ye are reconciled to the loss of liberty, because ye are told ye shall lose nothing else.  Fools and dupes!  I see, from the spot where my spirit stands above ye, the dark and dismal future to which ye are crawling on your knees: bondage and rapine--the violence of lawless lust--the persecution of hostile faith--your gold wrung from ye by torture--your national name rooted from the soil.  Bear this, and remember me!  Farewell, Boabdil! you I pity not; for your gardens have yet a poison, and your armories a sword.  Farewell, nobles and santons of Granada!  I quit my country while it is yet free.\"  Scarcely had he ceased, ere he had disappeared from the hall.  It was as the parting genius of Granada!     CHAPTER IV.  THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY HORSEMAN.  It was a burning and sultry noon, when, through a small valley, skirted by rugged and precipitous hills, at the distance of several leagues from Granada, a horseman, in complete armour, wound his solitary way;  His mail was black and unadorned; on his vizor waved no plume.  But there was something in his carriage and mien, and the singular beauty of his coal- black steed, which appeared to indicate a higher rank than the absence of page and squire, and the plainness of his accoutrements, would have denoted to a careless eye.  He rode very slowly; and his steed, with the licence of a spoiled favourite, often halted lazily in his sultry path, as a tuft of herbage, or the bough of some overhanging tree, offered its temptation.  At length, as he thus paused, a noise was heard in a copse that clothed the descent of a steep mountain; and the horse started suddenly back, forcing the traveller from his reverie.  He looked mechanically upward, and beheld the figure of a man bounding through the trees, with rapid and irregular steps.  It was a form that suited well the silence and solitude of the spot; and might have passed for one of those stern recluses--half hermit, half soldier--who, in the earlier crusades, fixed their wild homes amidst the sands and caves of Palestine. The stranger supported his steps by a long staff.  His hair and beard hung long and matted over his broad shoulders.  A rusted mail, once splendid with arabesque enrichments, protected his breast; but the loose gown--a sort of tartan, which descended below the cuirass--was rent and tattered, and his feet bare; in his girdle was a short curved cimiter, a knife or dagger, and a parchment roll, clasped and bound with iron.  As the horseman gazed at this abrupt intruder on the solitude, his frame quivered with emotion; and, raising himself to his full height, he called aloud, \"Fiend or santon--whatsoever thou art--what seekest thou in these lonely places, far from the king thy counsels deluded, and the city betrayed by thy false prophecies and unhallowed charms?\"  \"Ha!\" cried Almamen, for it was indeed the Israelite; \"by thy black charger, and the tone of thy haughty voice, I know the hero of Granada. Rather, Muza Ben Abil Gazan, why art thou absent from the last hold of the Moorish empire?\"  \"Dost thou pretend to read the future, and art thou blind to the present? Granada has capitulated to the Spaniard.  Alone I have left a land of slaves, and shall seek, in our ancestral Africa, some spot where the footstep of the misbeliever hath not trodden.\"  \"The fate of one bigotry is, then, sealed,\" said Almamen, gloomily; \"but that which succeeds it is yet more dark.\"  \"Dog!\" cried Muza, couching his lance, \"what art thou that thus blasphemest?\"  \"A Jew!\" replied Almamen, in a voice of thunder, and drawing his cimiter: \"a despised and despising Jew!  Ask you more?  I am the son of a race of kings.  I was the worst enemy of the Moors till I found the Nazarene more hateful than the Moslem; and then even Muza himself was not their more renowned champion.  Come on, if thou wilt--man to man: I defy thee\"  \"No, no,\" muttered Muza, sinking his lance; \"thy mail is rusted with the blood of the Spaniard, and this arm cannot smite the slayer of the Christian.  Part we in peace.\"  \"Hold, prince!\" said Almamen, in an altered voice: \"is thy country the sole thing dear to thee?  Has the smile of woman never stolen beneath thine armour?  Has thy heart never beat for softer meetings than the encounter of a foe?\"  \"Am I human, and a Moor?\" returned Muza.  \"For once you divine aright; and, could thy spells bestow on these eyes but one more sight of the last treasure left to me on earth, I should be as credulous of thy sorcery as Boabdil.\"  \"Thou lovest her still, then--this Leila?\"  \"Dark necromancer, hast thou read my secret? and knowest thou the name of my beloved one?  Ah! let me believe thee indeed wise, and reveal to me the spot of earth which holds the delight of my soul!  Yes,\" continued the Moor, with increased emotion, and throwing up his vizor, as if for air--\"yes; Allah forgive me! but, when all was lost at Granada, I had still one consolation in leaving my fated birthplace: I had licence to search for Leila; I had the hope to secure to my wanderings in distant lands one to whose glance the eyes of the houris would be dim.  But I waste words.  Tell me where is Leila, and conduct me to her feet!\"  \"Moslem, I will lead thee to her,\" answered Almamen, gazing on the prince with an expression of strange and fearful exultation in his dark eyes: \"I will lead thee to her-follow me.  It is only yesternight that I learned the walls that confined her; and from that hour to this have I journeyed over mountain and desert, without rest or food.\"  \"Yet what is she to thee?\" asked Muza, suspiciously.  \"Thou shalt learn full soon.  Let us on.\"  So saying, Almamen sprang forward with a vigour which the excitement of his mind supplied to the exhaustion of his body.  Muza wonderingly pushed on his charger, and endeavoured to draw his mysterious guide into conversation: but Almamen scarcely heeded him.  And when he broke from his gloomy silence, it was but in incoherent and brief exclamations, often in a tongue foreign to the ear of his companion.  The hardy Moor, though steeled against the superstitions of his race, less by the philosophy of the learned than the contempt of the brave, felt an awe gather over him as he glanced, from the giant rocks and lonely valleys, to the unearthly aspect and glittering eyes of the reputed sorcerer; and more than once he muttered such verses of the Koran as were esteemed by his countrymen the counterspell to the machinations of the evil genii.  It might be an hour that they had thus journeyed together, when Almamen paused abruptly.  \"I am wearied,\" said he, faintly; \"and, though time presses, I fear that my strength will fail me.\"  \"Mount, then, behind me,\" returned the Moor, after some natural hesitation: \"Jew though thou art, I will brave the contamination for the sake of Leila.\"  \"Moor!\" cried the Hebrew, fiercely, \"the contamination would be mine. Things of yesterday, as thy Prophet and thy creed are, thou canst not sound the unfathomable loathing which each heart faithful to the Ancient of Days feels for such as thou and thine.\"  \"Now, by the Kaaba!\" said Muza, and his brow became dark, \"another such word and the hoofs of my steed shall trample the breath of blasphemy from thy body.\"  \"I would defy thee to the death,\" answered Almamen, disdainfully; \"but I reserve the bravest of the Moors to witness a deed worthy of the descendant of Jephtha.  But hist!  I hear hoofs.\"  Muza listened; and his sharp ear caught a distinct ring upon the hard and rocky soil.  He turned round and saw Almamen gliding away through the thick underwood, until the branches concealed his form.  Presently, a curve in the path brought in view a Spanish cavalier, mounted on an Andalusian jennet: the horseman was gaily singing one of the popular ballads of the time; and, as it related to the feats of the Spaniards against the Moors, Muza's haughty blood was already stirred, and his moustache quivered on his lip.  \"I will change the air,\" muttered the Moslem, grasping his lance, when, as the thought crossed him, he beheld the Spaniard suddenly reel in his saddle and lay prostrate on the ground. In the same instant Almamen had darted from his hiding-place, seized the steed of the cavalier, mounted, and, ere Muza recovered from his surprise, was by the side of the Moor.  \"By what harm,\" said Muza, curbing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9760"],["title","Leila or, the Siege of Granada, Book V. (#6)"],["body","barb, \"didst thou fell the Spaniard--seemingly without a blow?\"  \"As David felled Goliath--by the pebble and the sling,\" answered Almamen, carelessly.  \"Now, then, spur forward, if thou art eager to see thy Leila.\"  The horsemen dashed over the body of the stunned and insensible Spaniard. Tree and mountain glided by; gradually the valley vanished, and a thick forest loomed upon their path.  Still they made on, though the interlaced boughs and the ruggedness of the footing somewhat obstructed their way; until, as the sun began slowly to decline, they entered a broad and circular space, round which trees of the eldest growth spread their motionless and shadowy boughs.  In the midmost sward was a rude and antique stone, resembling the altar of some barbarous and departed creed. Here Almamen abruptly halted, and muttered inaudibly to himself.  \"What moves thee, dark stranger?\" said the Moor; \"and why dost thou mutter and gaze on space?\"  Almamen answered not, but dismounted, hung his bridle to a branch of a scathed and riven elm, and advanced alone into the middle of the space. \"Dread and prophetic power that art within me!\" said the Hebrew, aloud,-- \"this, then, is the spot that, by dream and vision, thou hast foretold me wherein to consummate and record the vow that shall sever from the spirit the last weakness of the flesh.  Night after night hast thou brought before mine eyes, in darkness and in slumber, the solemn solitude that I now survey.  Be it so!  I am prepared!\"  Thus speaking, he retired for a few moments into the wood: collected in his arms the dry leaves and withered branches which cumbered the desolate clay, and placed the fuel upon the altar.  Then, turning to the East, and raising his hands he exclaimed, \"Lo! upon this altar, once worshipped, perchance, by the heathen savage, the last bold spirit of thy fallen and scattered race dedicates, O Ineffable One! that precious offering Thou didst demand from a sire of old.  Accept the sacrifice!\"  As the Hebrew ended his adjuration he drew a phial from his bosom, and sprinkled a few drops upon the arid fuel.  A pale blue flame suddenly leaped up; and, as it lighted the haggard but earnest countenance of the Israelite, Muza felt his Moorish blood congeal in his veins, and shuddered, though he scarce knew why.  Almamen, with his dagger, severed from his head one of his long locks, and cast it upon the flame.  He watched it until it was consumed; and then, with a stifled cry, fell upon the earth in a dead swoon.  The Moor hastened to raise him; he chafed his hands and temples; he unbuckled the vest upon his bosom; he forgot that his comrade was a sorcerer and a Jew, so much had the agony of that excitement moved his sympathy.  It was not till several minutes had elapsed that Almamen, with a deep- drawn sigh, recovered from his swoon.  \"Ah, beloved one! bride of my heart!\" he murmured, \"was it for this that thou didst commend to me the only pledge of our youthful love?  Forgive me!  I restore her to the earth, untainted by the Gentile.\"  He closed his eyes again, and a strong convulsion shook his frame.  It passed; and he rose as a man from a fearful dream, composed, and almost as it were refreshed, by the terrors he had undergone.  The last glimmer of the ghastly light was dying away upon that ancient altar, and a low wind crept sighing through the trees.  \"Mount, prince,\" said Almamen, calmly, but averting his eyes from the altar; \"we shall have no more delays.\"  \"Wilt thou not explain thy incantation?\" asked Muza; \"or is it, as my reason tells me, but the mummery of a juggler?\"  \"Alas! alas!\" answered Almamen, in a sad and altered tone, \"thou wilt soon know all.\"     CHAPTER V.  THE SACRIFICE.  The sun was now sinking slowly through those masses of purple cloud which belong to Iberian skies; when, emerging from the forest, the travellers saw before them a small and lovely plain, cultivated like a garden.  Rows of orange and citron trees were backed by the dark green foliage of vines; and these again found a barrier in girdling copses of chestnut, oak, and the deeper verdure of pines: while, far to the horizon, rose the distant and dim outline of the mountain range, scarcely distinguishable from the mellow colourings of the heaven.  Through this charming spot went a slender and sparkling torrent, that collected its waters in a circular basin, over which the rose and orange hung their contrasted blossoms.  On a gentle eminence above this plain, or garden, rose the spires of a convent: and, though it was still clear daylight, the long and pointed lattices were illumined within; and, as the horsemen cast their eyes upon the pile, the sound of the holy chorus--made more sweet and solemn from its own indistinctness, from the quiet of the hour, from the sudden and sequestered loveliness of that spot, suiting so well the ideal calm of the conventual life--rolled its music through the odorous and lucent air.  But that scene and that sound, so calculated to soothe and harmonise the thought, seemed to arouse Almamen into agony and passion.  He smote his breast with his clenched hand; and, shrieking, rather than exclaiming, \"God of my fathers! have I come too late?\" buried his spurs to the rowels in the sides of his panting steed.  Along the sward, through the fragrant shrubs, athwart the pebbly and shallow torrent, up the ascent to the convent, sped the Israelite.  Muza, wondering and half reluctant, followed at a little distance.  Clearer and nearer came the voices of the choir; broader and redder glowed the tapers from the Gothic casements: the porch of the convent chapel was reached; the Hebrew sprang from his horse.  A small group of the peasants dependent on the convent loitered reverently round the threshold; pushing through them, as one frantic, Almamen entered the chapel and disappeared.  A minute elapsed.  Muza was at the door; but the Moor paused irresolutely, ere he dismounted.  \"What is the ceremony?\" he asked of the peasants.  \"A nun is about to take the vows,\" answered one of them.  A cry of alarm, of indignation, of terror, was heard within.  Muza no longer delayed: he gave his steed to the bystanders, pushed aside the heavy curtain that screened the threshold and was within the chapel.  By the altar gathered a confused and disordered group--the sisterhood, with their abbess.  Round the consecrated rail flocked the spectators, breathless and amazed.  Conspicuous above the rest, on the elevation of the holy place, stood Almamen with his drawn dagger in his right hand, his left arm clasped around the form of a novice, whose dress, not yet replaced by the serge, bespoke her the sister fated to the veil; and, on the opposite side of that sister, one hand on her shoulder, the other rearing on high the sacred crucifix, stood a stern, commanding form, in the white robes of the Dominican order; it was Tomas de Torquemada.  \"Avaunt, Almamen!\" were the first words which reached Muza's ear as he stood, unnoticed, in the middle of the aisle: \"here thy sorcery and thine arts cannot avail thee.  Release the devoted one of God!\"  \"She is mine! she is my daughter!  I claim her from thee as a father, in the name of the great Sire of Man!\"  \"Seize the sorcerer! seize him!\" exclaimed the Inquisitor, as, with a sudden movement, Almamen cleared his way through the scattered and dismayed group, and stood with his daughter in his arms, on the first step of the consecrated platform.  But not a foot stirred--not a hand was raised.  The epithet bestowed on the intruder had only breathed a supernatural terror into the audience; and they would have sooner rushed upon a tiger in his lair, than on the lifted dagger and savage aspect of that grim stranger.  \"Oh, my father!\" then said a low and faltering voice, that startled Muza as a voice from the grave--\"wrestle not against the decrees of Heaven. Thy daughter is not compelled to her solemn choice.  Humbly, but devotedly, a convert to the Christian creed, her only wish on earth is to take the consecrated and eternal vow.\"  \"Ha!\" groaned the Hebrew, suddenly relaxing his hold, as his daughter fell on her knees before him, \"then have I indeed been told, as I have foreseen, the worst.  The veil is rent--the spirit hath left the temple. Thy beauty is desecrated; thy form is but unhallowed clay.  Dog!\" he cried, more fiercely, glaring round upon the unmoved face of the Inquisitor, \"this is thy work: but thou shalt not triumph.  Here, by thine own shrine, I spit at and defy thee, as once before, amidst the tortures of thy inhuman court.  Thus--thus--thus--Almamen the Jew delivers the last of his house from the curse of Galilee!\"  \"Hold, murderer!\" cried a voice of thunder; and an armed man burst through the crowd and stood upon the platform.  It was too late: thrice the blade of the Hebrew had passed through that innocent breast; thrice was it reddened with that virgin blood.  Leila fell in the arms of her lover; her dim eyes rested upon his countenance, as it shone upon her, beneath his lifted vizor-a faint and tender smile played upon her lips-- Leila was no more.  One hasty glance Almamen cast upon his victim, and then, with a wild laugh that woke every echo in the dreary aisles, he leaped from the place.  Brandishing his bloody weapon above his head, he dashed through the coward crowd; and, ere even the startled Dominican had found a voice, the tramp of his headlong steed rang upon the air; an instant--and all was silent.  But over the murdered girl leaned the Moor, as yet incredulous of her death; her head still unshorn of its purple tresses, pillowed on his lap --her icy hand clasped in his, and her blood weltering fast over his armour.  None disturbed him; for, habited as the knights of Christendom, none suspected his faith; and all, even the Dominican, felt a thrill of sympathy at his distress.  How he came hither, with what object,--what hope, their thoughts were too much locked in pity to conjecture.  There, voiceless"]]]
