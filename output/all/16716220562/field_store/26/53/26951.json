She sent Chloe to the closet for a jar of wine, and some goat's-milk cheese, and she herself went upstairs to get some dried figs from the store-room. Daphne followed Chloe to the closet, and for a moment there was no one beside the hearth-fire but Dion and Argos, and the sausages smelled very good indeed.  \"I wonder if she counted them,\" thought Dion to himself, as he looked longingly at them. And then almost before he knew it himself he had snatched one of the sausages from the fire and had bitten a piece off the end! It was so very hot that it burned both his fingers and his tongue like everything, and when he tried to lick his fingers, he let go of the sausage, and Argos snapped it up and swallowed it whole. It burned all the way down to his stomach, and Argos gave a dreadful howl of pain and dashed through the door out into the farm-yard. Dion heard his Mother's footsteps coming down the stair. He thought perhaps he'd better join Argos.  When Lydia reached the hearth-fire once more, only Daphne was in the room. She set down the basket of figs and knelt to turn the sausages. She had counted them and she saw at once that one was missing. She was shocked and surprised, but she guessed what had become of it. Mothers are just like that. She rose from her knees and looked around for the culprit. She saw Daphne.  \"You naughty boy!\" she said sternly to Daphne. \"What have you done with that sausage?\"  \"I didn't do anything with it; I never even saw it,\" cried poor Daphne. \"And, besides that, I'm not a naughty boy. I'm not a boy at all! I'm Daphne!\"  \"Where's Dion, then?\" demanded Lydia.  \"I don't know where he is,\" said Daphne. \"I didn't see him either, but I heard Argos howl as if some one had stepped on his tail. Maybe he took the sausage.\"  Lydia went to the door and looked out into the farm-yard. Away off in the farthest corner by the sheep-pen she saw two dark shadows.  \"Come here at once,\" she called.  Dion and Argos both obeyed, but they came very slowly, and Argos had his tail between his legs. Lydia pointed to the fire.  \"Where is the other sausage?\" she inquired, with stern emphasis.  \"Argos ate it,\" said Dion.  \"Open your mouth,\" said his Mother. She looked at Dion's tongue. It was all red where it was burned.  \"I suppose Argos took it off the fire and made you bite it when it was hot,\" said Lydia grimly. \"Very well, he is a bad dog and cannot have any sausage with his supper. And a boy that hasn't any more manners than a dog can't have any either. And neither one can be trusted in the kitchen where things are cooking. Go sit on the wood-pile until I call you.\"  She put both Dion and Argos out of doors and turned to her cooking again.  \"Supper is nearly ready,\" she called at last to Chloe. \"You and Daphne may bring out the couch and get the table ready.\"  Under the arcade in the court there was a small wooden table. Chloe and Daphne lifted it and brought it near the fire. Then they brought a plain wooden bench that also stood under the thatch and placed it beside the table. They arranged cushions of lamb's wool upon the bench, and near the foot set a low stool. Daphne brought the dishes, and when everything was ready, Lydia sent Chloe to call her husband and the Stranger, while she herself went out to the farm-yard. She found Dion and Argos sitting side by side on the wood-pile in dejected silence.  \"Come in and wash your hands,\" she said to Dion. \"If you get yourself clean, wrists and all, you may have your supper with us, but remember, no sausage. You have had your fingers with your food.\" This is what mothers used to say to their children in those days, because there were no knives or forks, and often not even spoons, to eat with.  Lydia didn't invite Argos in, but he came anyway, and lay down beside the fire with his nose on his paws, just where people would be most likely to stumble over him.  When Melas and the Stranger came in, they sat down side by side on the couch. Chloe knelt before them, took off their sandals, and bathed their feet. Then the Stranger loosened his long, cloak-like garment, and he and Melas reclined side by side upon the couch, their left elbows resting on the lamb's-wool cushions. Chloe moved the little table within easy reach of their hands, and Lydia took her place on the stool beside the couch. It was now quite dark except for the light of the hearth-fire.  The Twins had been brought up to be seen and not heard, especially when there was company, and as Dion was not anxious to call attention to himself just then, the two children slipped quietly into their places on the floor by the hearth-fire just as Melas and the Stranger dipped their bread into their broth and began to eat.  It must be confessed that Melas seemed to enjoy the black broth much more than his guest did, but the stranger ate it nevertheless, and when the last drop was gone, the men both wiped their fingers on scraps of bread and threw them to Argos, who snapped them up as greedily as if his tongue had never been burned at all. Then Chloe brought the sausages hot from the fire, and barley-cakes from the oven. When she had served the men and had explained that these cakes were really not so good as her barley-cakes usually were, Lydia gave the Twins each one, and she gave Daphne a sausage. She just looked at Dion without a single word.  He knew perfectly well what she meant. He munched his barley-cake in mournful silence, and I suppose no sausage ever smelled quite so good to any little boy in the whole world as Daphne's did to Dion just then. However, there were plenty of barley-cakes, and his mother let him have honey to eat with them, which comforted Dion so much that when the Stranger began to talk to Melas, he forgot his troubles entirely. He forgot his manners too, and listened with his eyes and mouth both wide open until the honey ran off the barley-cake and down between his fingers. Then he licked his fingers!  No one saw him do it, not even his Mother, because she too was watching the the inhabitants of the little farm. They lived so far from the sea, and so far from highways of travel on the island, that the Twins in all their lives had seen but few persons besides their own family and the slaves who worked on the farm. The Stranger was to them a visitor from another world--the great outside world which lay beyond the shining blue waters of the bay. They had seen that distant world sometimes from a hill-top on a clear day, but they had never been farther from home than the little seaport of Ambelaca two miles away.  \"How is it,\" the Stranger was saying to Melas, \"that you, a Spartan, live here, so far from your native soil, and so near to Athens? The Spartans have but little love for the Athenians as a rule, nor for farming either, I am told.\"  \"We love the Athenians quite as well as they love us,\" answered Melas; \"and as for my being here, I have my father to thank for that. He was a soldier of the Persian Wars and settled here after the Battle of Salamis. I grew up on the island, and thought myself fortunate when I had a chance to become overseer on this farm.\"  \"Who is the owner of the farm?\" asked the Stranger.  \"Pericles, Chief Archon of Athens,\" answered Melas.  \"You are indeed fortunate to be in his service,\" said the Stranger. \"He is the greatest man in Athens, and consequently the greatest man in the world, as any Athenian would tell you!\"  \"Do you know him?\" asked Dion, quite forgetting in his interest that children should be seen and not heard.  Lydia shook her head at Dion, but the Stranger answered just as politely as if Dion were forty years old instead of ten.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"I know Pericles well. I went with him only yesterday to see the new temple he is having built upon the great hill of the Acropolis in Athens. You have seen it, of course,\" he said, turning to Melas.  \"No,\" answered Melas. \"I sell most of my produce in the markets of the Piraeus, and go to Athens itself only when necessary to take fruit and vegetables to the city home of Pericles. There is no occasion to go in the winter, and the season for planting is only just begun. Perhaps later in the summer I shall go.\"  \"When you do,\" said the Stranger, \"do not fail to see the new building on the sacred hill. It is worth a longer journey than from here to Athens, I assure you. People will come from the ends of the earth to see it some day, or I am no true prophet.\"  \"Oh,\" murmured Daphne to Dion, \"don't you wish we could go too?\"  \"You can't go. You're a girl!\" Dion whispered back. \"Girls can't do such things, but I'm going to get Father to take me with him the very next time he goes.\"  Daphne turned up her nose at Dion. \"I don't care if I am a girl,\" she whispered back. \"I'm no Athenian sissy that never puts her nose out of doors, I can do everything you can do here on the farm, and I guess I could in Athens too. Besides, no one would know I'm a girl; I look just as much like a boy as you do. I look just like you.\"  \"You do not,\" said Dion resentfully. \"You can't look like a boy.\"  \"Ail right,\" answered Daphne, \"then you must look just like a girl, for you know very well Father can't tell us apart, so there now.\"  Dion opened his mouth to reply, but just then his Mother shook her head at them, and at the same moment Chloe, coming in with the wine-jar, stumbled over Argos and nearly fell on the table. Argos yelped, and Dion and Daphne both laughed. Lydia was dreadfully ashamed because Chloe had been so awkward, and ashamed of the Twins for laughing. She apologized to the Stranger.  \"Oh, well,\" said the Stranger, and he laughed a little too, even if he was a philosopher, \"boys will be boys, and those seem two fine strong little fellows of yours. One of these days they'll be competing in the Olympian games, I suppose, and how proud you will be if they should bring home the wreath of victors!\"  \"They are as strong as the young"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9966"],["title","The Spartan Twins (#2)"],["body","ercules, both of them,\" Melas answered, \"but one is a girl, so we can hope to have but one victor in the family at best.\"  \"Perhaps two would make you over proud,\" said the Stranger, smiling, \"so it may be just as well that one is a girl, after all.\"  Dion sat up very straight at these words, but Daphne hung her head. \"I do wish I were a boy too,\" she said, \"they can do so many things a girl is not allowed to do. They get the best of everything.\"  \"That must be as the Gods will,\" said the Stranger kindly. \"And Spartan women have always been considered just as brave as men, even if they aren't quite as big. Anyway, some of us have to be women because we can't get along without women in the world.\"  Two bright spots glowed in Lydia's cheeks, and she twirled her distaff faster than ever. \"I should think not, indeed,\" she said. \"Men aren't much more fit to take care of themselves than children!\"  Melas and the Stranger laughed, and the Stranger turned to Daphne.  \"Don't you remember, my little maid, how glad Epimetheus was to welcome Pandora, even if she did bring trouble into the world with her?\" he asked.  \"No,\" said Daphne, \"I don't know about Pandora. Please tell us about her!\"  Lydia rose and glanced up at the stars. \"It's getting near bed-time,\" she said to the Twins; and to the Stranger she added, \"You must excuse the boldness of my children. They are brought up so far out of the world they scarcely understand the reverence due men like yourself. You must not permit them to impose upon your kindness.\"  \"I will gladly tell them about Pandora if you are willing,\" said the Stranger. \"The fine old tales of Hellas should be the birthright of every child. They will live so long as there are children in the world to hear them and old fellows like myself to tell them.\"  \"If you will be so gracious then,\" said Lydia, \"but first let us prepare ourselves to listen.\"  She signed to Chloe, who immediately brought a basin and towel to the Stranger and Melas. When they had washed their hands, she carried away the basin and swept the crumbs into the fire, while Lydia filled cups with wine and water and set them before her husband and his guest. Then wood was piled upon the fire, and Lydia seated herself beside it once more with her distaff and wool-basket, while Chloe crept into the shadow behind her mistress's chair, and the Twins drew nearer to her footstool. When everything was quiet once more, the Stranger lifted his wine-cup.  \"Since we are in the country,\" he said, \"we will make our libation to Demeter, the Goddess of the fields. May yours be fruitful, with her blessing.\" He poured a little wine on the earthen floor as he spoke. There was a moment of reverent silence. Then while the flames of the hearth danced upward toward the sky and the stars winked down from above, the Stranger began his story.     II  THE STRANGER'S STORY   \"Long, long ago, when the earth was young and the Gods mingled more freely with men than they do to-day, there lived in Hellas a beautiful youth named Epimetheus. I am not quite sure that he was the very first man that ever lived, but at any rate he was one of the first, and he was very lonely. The world was then more beautiful than I can say. The sun shone every day in the year, flowers bloomed everywhere, and the earth brought forth abundantly all that he needed for food, but still Epimetheus was not happy. The Gods saw how lonely he was and they felt sorry for him.  \"'Let us give him a companion,' said Zeus, the father of all the Gods. 'Even sun-crowned Olympus would be a desolate place to me if I had to live all alone.' So the Gods all fell to hunting for just the right companion to send to poor lonely Epimetheus, and soon they found a lovely maiden whose name was Pandora. 'She's just the right one,' said Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love. 'See how beautiful she is.' 'Yes,' said Athena, the Goddess of Wisdom, 'but she will need more than beauty or Epimetheus will tire of her. One cannot love an empty head forever, even if it is a beautiful one. I will give her learning and wisdom.'  \"'I will give her a sweet voice for singing,' said Apollo. In this way each one of the Gods gave to Pandora some wonderful gift, and when the time came for her departure from Olympus, where the Gods dwell, these gifts were packed away in a marriage-chest of curious workmanship, and were taken with her to the home of Epimetheus.  \"You can imagine how glad Epimetheus was to receive a bride so nobly endowed, and for a time everything went very happily upon the earth. At last, one sad day, a dreadful thing happened.  \"Pandora had been told by the Gods that she must not open the box, lest she lose all the blessings it contained.  \"But she was curious. She wished to see with her own eyes what was in it, and one day, when Epimetheus was away from home, she lifted the corner of the lid! Out flew the gifts of the Gods! She tried her best to close the lid again, but before she could do so, the blessings had flown away in a bright cloud.  \"Poor Pandora! She sat down beside the box and wept the very first tears that were ever shed in this world. While she was weeping and blaming herself for her disobedience and the trouble it had caused, she heard a little voice, way down in the bottom of the box.  \"'Don't cry, dear Pandora!' the little voice said. 'You can never be quite unhappy when I am here, and I am always going to stay with you; I am Hope.' So Pandora dried her tears, and no matter how full of sorrow the world has been since, there has never been a time when Hope was gone. If that time should ever come, the world would be a desolate place indeed.\"  When he had finished the story, no one said anything at all for a minute, and then Daphne looked up at the Stranger.  \"Is that really the way all the troubles began?\" she asked. \"Because if it isn't, I think it's mean to blame everything on poor Pandora.\"  \"Why, Daphne!\" said her Mother in a shocked voice; but the Stranger only smiled.  \"I should not be surprised if Epimetheus were to blame for a few things himself,\" he said, stroking his beard. \"Anyway, I'm sure he felt he would rather have Pandora and all the troubles in the world than to live without her, and men have felt the same way ever since.\"  \"Well, then,\" began Daphne, her eyes shining like two blue sparks, \"why don't--?\"  \"Daphne! Daphne!\" cried Lydia warningly. \"You are talking too much for a little girl.\"  The Stranger nodded kindly to Lydia. \"Let her speak,\" he said. Daphne spoke.  \"Didn't Athena say Epimetheus would get tired of Pandora if she had an empty head?\"  \"Yes,\" admitted the Stranger, \"the story certainly runs that way.\"  \"And have men felt like that ever since too?\" Daphne asked.  \"Yes, I think so,\" answered the Stranger. \"Certainly women need wisdom now as much as Pandora did.\"  \"Then why don't they let us learn things the same as boys,\" gasped Daphne, a little frightened at her own boldness. \"Dion's always telling me I can't do things or go to places because I am a girl. I want to know things if I _am_ a girl. I can't try for the Olympian games and I can't even go to see them just because I am a girl.\" She stopped quite overcome.  Melas and Lydia and Dion were all too astonished to speak. Only the Stranger did not seem shocked. He drew Daphne up beside him.  \"My dear,\" he said, \"a child can ask questions which even a philosopher cannot answer. I do not know myself why the world feels as it does, but it certainly has always seemed to be afraid to let women know too much. It has always seemed to prefer they should have beauty rather than brains.\"  \"Yes, but,\" urged Daphne, \"I don't see why I can't try for the games too, when I am big enough. I can run just as fast as Dion and do everything he can do.\"  Melas smiled. \"Daphne is true to her Spartan blood,\" he said. \"The girls used to compete in the games at Sparta.\"  The Philosopher stroked Daphne's hair. \"So your name is Daphne,\" he said, smiling, \"And you can run fast and you have golden hair! Did you know it was to the fleet-footed nymph Daphne with golden hair that we owe the victor's crown at the Olympian games, even though no woman may wear it?\"  Daphne shook her head. \"I don't know what you mean,\" she said.  \"I mean this,\" said the Stranger. \"It is said that once upon a time Apollo himself loved a beautiful nymph named Daphne. But Daphne did not love Apollo even though he was a God, and when he pursued her she ran away. She was as swift as the wind, but Apollo was still more swift, and when she saw that she could not escape him by flight, she prayed to her father, who was a river god, and, to protect her, he changed her form by magic. Her arms became branches, her golden hair became leaves, and her feet took root in the ground. When Apollo reached her side, she was no longer a beautiful maiden, but a lovely laurel tree. Apollo gathered some of the shining leaves and wove them into a wreath. 'If you will not be my bride,' he cried, 'you shall at least be my tree and your leaves shall be my crown,' and that is why at the games over which Apollo presides, the victor is still crowned with laurel. It was Apollo himself who gave us the custom and made it sacred. So, my little maid,\" he finished, \"you give us our crowns even though you may not win them for yourselves, don't you see? Isn't that almost as good?\"  \"Maybe it is,\" sighed Daphne, thoughtfully, \"but anyway I'd like to try it the other way.\" Then she slid from the Stranger's side to her Mother's footstool, and sat down with her head against her Mother's knee.  \"You are sleepy,\" said Lydia, stroking her hair. \"It is time you children were in bed.\"  \"Oh, Mother,\" pleaded Dion, \"please let him tell just one more story. It isn't late, truly.\" Then he turned to their guest. \"Those were very good stories,\" he said, \"but they were both about girls. Won't you please tell me one about a boy?\"  \"Very well,\" said the Stranger, \"if your Mother will let me, I will tell you the story of Perseus and how"]]]
