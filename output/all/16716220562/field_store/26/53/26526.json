I counted to see if they were all there. I got to ten right enough, but I did not stop there. I counted again, and this is the odd thing--_there were eleven of them_! In my dream or vision or trance, call it what you will, I was vaguely troubled by this unexpected number. I saw the ten troop out in their old familiar way, and I turned back to find the eleventh, _The Comrade in White_, and to speak to Him. I felt His presence still, and was glad of it, for the trouble and perplexity were all gone and in their place a great expectation. I seemed to know the very place where He had been kneeling, and I hurried forward. But there was nothing to be seen, nothing but the well-remembered text staring down at me from the wall--'For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.' I remembered no more, till I found myself in the base hospital. But of course I knew then how I had been saved, and what my boys had done for me.  \"It makes a man feel strange to have his life given back to him like that; it's as if God would expect a great deal in return. But there's a stronger feeling still in my heart. I believe the lads got their answer not for my sake but for their own. Think what it means to them. They've got their feet now on the rock of prayer. They know the truth of God. I'm not sure, but I don't think I'll ever tell them that I saw Christ in their midst. They know it in their own way, and perhaps their own way is best.\"  And as he said it, I saw that Lieutenant Roger Fenton was prouder of his boys than of his Victoria Cross."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9388"],["title","The Red Flower: Poems Written in War Time (#0)"],["body","RED FLOWER  POEMS WRITTEN IN WAR TIME  BY HENRY VAN DYKE D.O.L. (OXON.)   1919    PREFACE   These are verses that came to me in this dreadful war time amid the cares and labors of a heavy task.  Two of the poems, \"A Scrap of Paper\" and \"Stand Fast,\" were written in 1914 and bore the signature _Civis Americanus_--the use of my own name at the time being impossible. Two others, \"Lights Out\" and \"Remarks about Kings,\" were read for me by Robert Underwood Johnson at the meeting of the American Academy in Boston, November, 1915, at which I was unable to be present.  The rest of the verses were printed after I had resigned my diplomatic post and was free to say what I thought and felt, without reserve.  The \"Interludes in Holland\" are thoughts of the peaceful things that will abide for all the world after we have won this war against war.  SYLVANORA, October 1, 1917.

And the friendly fertile German land     Lay round me green and still.    But all day long on the eastern bank     Of the river cool and clear,   Where the curving track of the double rails     Was hardly seen though near,   The endless trains of German troops     Went rolling down to Trier.    They packed the windows with bullet heads     And caps of hodden gray;   They laughed and sang and shouted loud     When the trains were brought to a stay;   They waved their hands and sang again     As they went on their iron way.    No shadow fell on the smiling land,     No cloud arose in the sky;   I could hear the river's quiet tune     When the trains had rattled by;   But my heart sank low with a heavy sense     Of trouble,--I knew not why.    Then came I into a certain field     Where the devil's paint-brush spread   'Mid the gray and green of the rolling hills     A flaring splotch of red,   An evil omen, a bloody sign,     And a token of many dead.    I saw in a vision the field-gray horde     Break forth at the devil's hour,   And trample the earth into crimson mud     In the rage of the Will to Power,--   All this I dreamed in the valley of Kyll,     At the sign of the blood-red flower.       A SCRAP OF PAPER     \"Will you go to war just for a scrap of paper?\"--_Question of the   German Chancellor to the British Ambassador, August 3, 1914._    A mocking question! Britain's answer came   Swift as the light and searching as the flame.    \"Yes, for a scrap of paper we will fight   Till our last breath, and God defend the right!    \"A scrap of paper where a name is set   Is strong as duty's pledge and honor's debt.    \"A scrap of paper holds for man and wife   The sacrament of love, the bound of life.    \"A scrap of paper may be Holy Writ   With God's eternal word to hallow it.    \"A scrap of paper binds us both to stand   Defenders of a neutral neighbor land.    \"By God, by faith, by honor, yes! We fight   To keep our name upon that paper white.\"     September, 1914       STAND FAST           Stand fast, Great Britain!   Together England, Scotland, Ireland stand   One in the faith that makes a mighty land,   True to the bond you gave and will not break   And fearless in the fight for conscience' sake!   Against Giant Robber clad in steel,   With blood of trampled Belgium on his heel,   Striding through France to strike you down at last,         Britain, stand fast!          Stand fast, brave land!   The Huns are thundering toward the citadel;   They prate of Culture but their path is Hell;   Their light is darkness, and the bloody sword   They wield and worship is their only Lord.   O land where reason stands secure on right,   O land where freedom is the source of light,   Against the mailed Barbarians' deadly blast,         Britain, stand fast!          Stand fast, dear land!   Thou island mother of a world-wide race,   Whose children speak thy tongue and love thy face,   Their hearts and hopes are with thee in the strife,   Their hands will break the sword that seeks thy life;   Fight on until the Teuton madness cease;   Fight bravely on, until the word of peace   Is spoken in the English tongue at last,         Britain, stand fast!     September, 1914.       LIGHTS OUT    (1915)     \"Lights out\" along the land,   \"Lights out\" upon the sea.   The night must put her hiding hand   O'er peaceful towns where children sleep,   And peaceful ships that darkly creep   Across the waves, as if they were not free.    The dragons of the air,   The hell-hounds of the deep,   Lurking and prowling everywhere,   Go forth to seek their helpless prey,   Not knowing whom they maim or slay--   Mad harvesters, who care not what they reap.    Out with the tranquil lights,   Out with the lights that burn   For love and law and human rights!   Set back the clock a thousand years:   All they have gained now disappears,   And the dark ages suddenly return.    Kaiser who loosed wild death   And terror in the night   God grant you draw no quiet breath,   Until the madness you began   Is ended, and long-suffering man,   Set free from war lords, cries, \"Let there be Light.\"     October, 1915.    Read at the meeting of the American Academy, Boston,   November, 1915.       REMARKS ABOUT KINGS    _God said, \"I am tired of kings._\"--EMERSON.     God said, \"I am tired of kings,\"--   But that was a long time ago!   And meantime man said, \"No,   I like their looks in their robes and rings.\"   So he crowned a few more,   And they went on playing the game as before   Fighting and spoiling things.    Man said, \"I am tired of kings!   Sons of the robber-chiefs of yore,   They make me pay for their lust and their war;   I am the puppet, they pull the strings;   The blood of my heart is the wine they drink.   I will govern myself for while I think,   And see what that brings!\"    Then God, who made the first remark,   Smiled in the dark.     Read at the meeting of the American Academy, Boston.   November, 1915.       WAR-MUSIC         Break off! Dance no more!         Danger is at the door.         Music is in arms.       To signal war's alarms,    Hark, a sudden trumpet calling     Over the hill   Why are you calling, trumpet, calling?     What is your will?      Men, men, men!   Men who are ready to fight   For their country's life, and the right.   Of a liberty-loving land to be     Free, free, free!   Free from a tyrant's chain,   Free from dishonor's stain,   Free to guard and maintain   All that her fathers fought for,   All that her sons have wrought for,     Resolute, brave, and free!      Call again, trumpet, call again,         Call up the men!     Do you hear the storm of cheers     Mingled with the women's tears   And the tramp, tramp, tramp of marching feet?     Do you hear the throbbing drum     As the hosts of battle come   Keeping time, time, time to its beat?     O Music give a song     To make their spirit strong   For the fury of the tempest they must meet.        The hoarse roar       Of the monster guns;       And the sharp bark       Of the lesser guns;       The whine of the shells,       The rifles' clatter       Where the bullets patter,       The rattle, rattle, rattle       Of the mitrailleuse in battle,       And the yells       Of the men who charge through hells       Where the poison gas descends.       And the bursting shrapnel rends       Limb from limb       In the dim       Chaos and clamor of the strife       Where no man thinks of his life       But only of fighting through,       Blindly fighting through, through!      'Tis done     At last!     The victory won,   The dissonance of warfare past!      O Music mourn the dead     Whose loyal blood was shed,   And sound the taps for every hero slain;     Then lend into the song     That made their spirit strong,   And tell the world they did not die in vain.    Thank God we can see, in the glory of morn,     The invincible flag that our fathers defended;   And our hearts can repeat what the heroes have sworn,     That war shall not end till the war-lust is ended,   Then the bloodthirsty sword shall no longer be lord     Of the nations oppressed by the conqueror's horde,   But the banners of freedom shall peacefully wave     O'er the world of the free and the lands of the brave.     May, 1916       MIGHT AND RIGHT     If Might made Right, life were a wild-beasts' cage;   If Right made Might, this were the golden age;   But now, until we win the long campaign   Right must gain Might to conquer and to reign.     July 1, 1915.       THE PRICE OF PEACE     Peace without Justice is a low estate,--   A coward cringing to an iron Fate!   But Peace through Justice is the great ideal,--   We'll pay the price of war to make it real.    December 28, 1916.       STORM MUSIC     O Music hast thou only heard   The laughing river, the singing bird,   The murmuring wind in the poplar-trees,--   Nothing but Nature's melodies?     Nay, thou hearest all her tones,       As a Queen must hear!       Sounds of wrath and fear,       Mutterings, shouts, and moans,     Mildness, tumult, and despair,--     All she has that shakes the air     With voices fierce and wild!   Thou art a Queen and not a dreaming child,--   Put on thy crown and let us hear thee reign   Triumphant in a world of storm and strain!      Echo the long-drawn sighs   Of"]]]
