Gaga departed and hastened upon his way  68. To the god Lakhmu and the goddess Lakhamu, the gods his fathers, reverently  69. He did homage, and he kissed the ground at their feet.  70. He bowed down, stood up, and spake unto them [saying]:  71. \"[O ye gods], Anshar your son hath charged me,  72. \"The intention of his heart he hath made me to know in this wise:--  73. \"Mother Tiâmat who gave us birth hath sown these things,  74. \"She hath set in order her assembly, she rageth furiously.  75. \"All the gods have joined themselves to her.  76. \"They march by her side together with those whom ye have created,  77. \"They formed a band and went forth to battle to help Tiâmat.  78. \"They were exceedingly wroth, they made plans by day and by night without ceasing.  79. \"They offered battle, foaming and raging.  80. \"They set the battle in array, they uttered cries of defiance.  81. \"Ummu-Khubur, who formed all things,  82. \"Set up the unrivalled weapon, she spawned huge serpents,  83. \"Sharp of tooth, pitiless in attack (?)  84. \"She filled their bodies with venom instead of blood,  85. \"Grim, monstrous serpents, arrayed in terror,  86. \"She decked them with brightness, she fashioned them in exalted forms,  87. \"So that fright and horror might overcome him that looked upon them,  88. \"So that their bodies might rear up, and no man resist their attack.  89. \"She set up the Viper, and the Snake, and the god Lakhamu,  90. \"The Whirlwind, the Ravening Dog, the Scorpion-man,  91. \"The Storm-wind, the Fish-man, the Horned Beast,  92. \"They carried the Weapon which spared not, nor flinched from the battle.  93. \"Most mighty were Tiâmat's allies, they could not be resisted.  94. \"Thus she caused Eleven [monsters] of this kind to come into being.  95. \"Amongst the gods, her first-born son who had collected her company,  96. \"That is to say, Kingu, she set on high, she made him the great one among them.  97. \"Leader of the hosts in the battle, disposer of the troops,  98. \"Bearer of the firmly-grasped weapon, attacker in the fight,  99. \"He who in the battle is the master of the weapon  100. \"She appointed, she made him to sit down in [goodly apparel],  101. \"[Saying]: 'I have recited the incantation for thee, I have magnified thee in the assembly of the gods.  102. \"'I have filled his (i.e., thy) hand with the sovereignty of the whole company of the gods.  103. \"'Mayest thou be magnified, thou who art my only spouse.  104. \"'May the Anunnaki make great thy renown over all of them.'  105. \"She gave him the TABLET OF DESTINIES, she fastened it on his head [saying]:  106. \"'As for thee, thy command shall not fall empty, what goeth forth from thy mouth shall be established.'  107. \"When Kingu was raised on high, and had taken the heavens (Anutum)  108. \"He fixed the destinies for the gods, his sons, [saying]:  109. \"'Open your mouths, let the Fire-god be quenched,  110. \"'He who is glorious in battle and is most mighty shall do great deeds.  111. \"'I sent the god Anu, but he could not prevail against her.  112. \"'Nudimmud (i.e., Ea) was afraid and turned back.  113. \"'Marduk, your son, the envoy of the gods, hath set out.  114. \"'His heart is stirred up to oppose Tiâmat.  115. \"'He opened his mouth, he spoke unto me, [saying]:  116. \"'Should I as your avenger  117. \"'Slay Tiâmat, and bestow life upon you,  118. \"'Summon a meeting (i.e., council), proclaim and magnify my position,  119. \"'Sit down together in friendly fashion in Upshukkinaku,  120. \"'Let me issue decrees by the opening of my mouth, even as ye do,  121. \"'Whatsoever I bring to pass let it remain unaltered.  122. \"'That which my mouth uttereth shall neither fail nor be brought to nought.\"'  123. \"Hasten ye therefore, issue your decrees speedily  124. \"That he may go to meet your mighty enemy.\"  125. The gods Lakhmu and Lakhamu heard, they wailed loudly,  126. All the Igigi gods wept bitterly [saying]:  127. \"Who were [our] enemies until [the gods] were posted [in heaven]?  128. \"We cannot comprehend the work of Tiâmat.\"  129. They gathered themselves together, they went,  130. All the great gods, who issue decrees.  131. They entered in, they filled [the court] before Anshar.  132. Brother [god] kissed brother [god] in the [divine] assembly,  133. They held a meeting, they sat down to a feast,  134. They ate bread, they heated the [sesame wine],  135. The taste of the sweet drink confused their ...  136. They drank themselves drunk, their bodies were filled to overflowing,  137. They were overcome by heaviness [of drink], their livers (i.e., spirits) were exalted,  138. They issued the decree for Marduk as their avenger.    FOURTH TABLET.  1. They founded for him a majestic canopy,  2. He (i.e., Marduk) seated himself in the seat of kingship in the presence of his fathers [who said unto him]:  3. \"Thou art honourable by reason of thy greatness among the gods.  4. \"Thy position is unrivalled, the words thou utterest become Anum (i.e., as fixed as the sky).  5. \"Thou art honourable by reason of thy greatness among the gods.  6. \"Thy position is unrivalled, the words thou utterest become Anum (i.e., as fixed as the sky).  7. \"From this day onward thy command shall not be abrogated.  8. \"The power to exalt to heaven and to cast down to the earth both shall be in thy hand,  9. \"That which goeth forth from thy mouth shall be established, against thy utterance shall be no appeal.  10. \"No one among the gods shall overstep thy boundary,  11. \"Worship, which is the object of the sanctuary of the gods,  12. \"Whensoever they lack [it] shall be forthcoming in thy sanctuary,  13. \"O god Marduk, thou art our avenger.  14. \"We have given unto thee sovereignty over the whole creation,  15. \"Thou shalt sit down, in the council thy word shall be exalted,  16. \"Thy weapon shall never fall [from thy hands], it shall break the head of thy foe.  17. \"Lord, whosoever putteth his trust in thee, spare thou his life,  18. \"And the god who deviseth evil, pour thou out his soul.\"  19. Then a cloak (literally, one cloak) was set in their midst,  20. They addressed the god Marduk their first-born [saying]:  21. \"Thou, Lord, shalt hold the foremost position among the gods.  22. \"Decree thou the throwing down[1] and the building up,[2] and it shall come to pass.  [Footnote 1: _I.e._, the destruction of Tiâmat.]  [Footnote 2: _I.e._, the establishing of a new creation to take the place of the old.]  23. \"Speak but the word, and the cloak shall disappear,  24. \"Speak a second time and the cloak shall return uninjured.\"  25. Marduk spoke the word, the cloak disappeared,  26. He spoke a second time, the cloak reappeared.  27. When the gods his fathers saw the issue of the utterance of his mouth  28. They rejoiced and adored [him, saying], \"Marduk is King.\"  29. They conferred upon him the sceptre, the throne, and the symbol of royalty (?)[1]  [Footnote 1: The meaning of _pal-a_ is unknown.]  30. They gave him the unrivalled weapon, the destroyer of the enemy [saying]:  31. \"Go, cut off the life of Tiâmat.  32. \"Let the wind carry her blood into the depth [under the earth].\"  33. The gods, his fathers, issued the decree for the god Bel.  34. They set him on the road which leadeth to peace and adoration.  35. He strung [his] bow, he set ready his weapon [in the stand],  36. He slung his spear, he attached it to [his belly],  37. He raised the club, he grasped it in his right hand.  38. The bow and the quiver he hung at his side.[1]  [Footnote 1: This equipment of the charioteer is shown on the bas-reliefs.]  39. He set the lightning in front of him.  40. His body was filled with a glancing flame of fire.  41. He made a net wherewith to enclose Tiâmat.  42. He made the four winds to take up their position so that no part of her might escape,  [Illustration: Portion of a tablet inscribed in Babylonian with a text of the Fourth Tablet of the Creation Series. [No. 93,016.]]  43. The South wind, the North wind, the East wind, the West wind.  44. He held the net close to his side, the gift of his father Anu,  45. He created the \"foul\" wind, the storm, the parching blast,  46. The wind of \"four,\" the wind of \"seven,\" the typhoon, the wind incomparable  [Illustration: Portion of a tablet inscribed in Assyrian with a text of the Fourth Tablet of the Creation Series. [K. 3437.]]  47. He despatched the seven winds which he had made,  48. To make turbid the inward parts of Tiâmat; they followed in his train.  49. The Lord raised up the wind storm, his mighty weapon.  50. He went up into his chariot, the unequalled and terrible tempest.[1]  [Footnote 1: Compare Psalms xviii, 7-15; civ, i ff.]  51. He equipped it, he yoked thereto a team of four horses,  52. Pawing the ground, champing, foaming [eager to] fly,  53. ... [the odour] of their teeth bore foetidness,  54. They were skilled [in biting], they were trained to trample under foot.  [Lines 55-57 too fragmentary to translate; they continue the description of Marduk's equipment.]  58. His brightness streamed forth, his head was crowned [thereby].  59. He took a direct path, he hastened on his journey.  60. He set his face towards the place of Tiâmat, who was ...  61. On his lips ... he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9914"],["title","The Babylonian Legends of the Creation (#8)"],["body","62. ... his hand grasped.  63. At that moment the gods were gazing upon him with fixed intensity,  64. The gods, his fathers, gazed upon him, they gazed upon him.  65. The Lord approached, he looked upon the middle of Tiâmat,  66. He searched out the plan of Kingu, her husband.  67. Marduk looked, Kingu staggered in his gait,  68. His will was destroyed, his motion was paralysed.  69. And the gods his helpers who were marching by his side  70. Saw the [collapse of] their chief and their sight was troubled.  71. Tiâmat [shrieked but] did not turn her head.  72. With lips full of [rebellious words] she maintained her stubbornness  73. [Saying], \"... that thou hast come as the Lord of the gods, [forsooth],  74. \"They have appointed thee in the place which should be theirs.\"  75. The Lord raised up the wind-storm, his mighty weapon,  76. [Against] Tiâmat, who was furious (?), he sent it, [saying]:  77. \"[Thou hast made thyself] mighty, thou art puffed upon high,  78. \"Thy heart [hath stirred thee up] to invoke battle  79. \"... their fathers ...  80. \"...  81. \"[Thou hast exalted Kingu to be [thy] husband,  82. \"[Thou hast made him to usurp] the attributes of Anu  83. \"... thou hast planned evil.  84. \"[Against] the gods, my fathers, thou hast wrought evil.  85. \"Let now thy troops gird themselves up, let them bind on their weapons.  86. \"Stand up! Thou and I, let us to the fight!\"  87. On hearing these words Tiâmat  88. Became like a mad thing, her senses became distraught,  89. Tiâmat uttered shrill cries again and again.  90. That on which she stood split in twain at the words,  91. She recited an incantation, she pronounced her spell.  92. The gods of battle demanded their weapons.[1]  [Footnote 1: I.e., the gods were impatient to begin the fight.]  93. Tiâmat and Marduk, the envoy of the gods, roused themselves,  94. They advanced to fight each other, they drew nigh in battle.  95. The Lord cast his net and made it to enclose her,  96. The evil wind that had its place behind him he let out in her face.  97. Tiâmat opened her mouth to its greatest extent,  98. Marduk made the evil wind to enter [it] whilst her lips were unclosed.  99. The raging winds filled out her belly,  100. Her heart was gripped, she opened wide her mouth [panting].  101. Marduk grasped the spear, he split up her belly,  102. He clave open her bowels, he pierced [her] heart,  103. He brought her to nought, he destroyed her life.  104. He cast down her carcase, he took up his stand upon it,  105. After Marduk had slain Tiâmat the chief,  106. Her host was scattered, her levies became fugitive,  107. And the gods, her allies, who had marched at her side,  108. Quaked with terror, and broke and ran  109. And betook themselves to flight to save their lives.  110. But they found themselves hemmed in, they could not escape,  111. Marduk tied them up, he smashed their weapons.  112. They were cast into the net, and they were caught in the snare,  113. The ... of the world they filled with [their] cries of grief.  114. They received [Marduk's] chastisement, they were confined in restraint,  115. And [on] the Eleven Creatures which Tiâmat had filled with awfulness,  116. The company of the devils that marched at her ...  117. He threw fetters, he ... their sides.  118. They and their resistance he trod under his feet.  119. The god Kingu who had been magnified over them  120. He crushed, he esteemed him [as little worth] as the god Dugga, (as a dead god?).  121. Marduk took from him the TABLET OF DESTINIES, which should never have been his,  122. He sealed it with a seal[1] and fastened it on his breast  [Footnote 1: By impressing his seal on the Tablet Marduk proved his ownership of the Tablet, and made his claim to it legal.]  123. After he had crushed and overthrown his enemies,  124. He made the haughty enemy to be like the dust underfoot.  125. He established completely Anshar's victory over the enemy,  126. The valiant Marduk achieved the object of Nudimmud (Ea),[1]  [Footnote 1: This is an oblique way of saying that Marduk succeeded where Ea failed.]  127. He imposed strict restraint on the gods whom he had made captive.  128. He turned back to Tiâmat whom he had defeated,  129. The Lord [Marduk] trampled on the rump of Tiâmat,  130. With his unsparing club he clave her skull.  131. He slit open the channels (i.e., arteries) of her blood.  132. He caused the North Wind to carry it away to a place underground.  133. His fathers (i.e., the gods) looked on, they rejoiced, they were glad.  134. They brought unto him offerings of triumph and peace,  135. The Lord [Marduk] paused, he examined Tiâmat's carcase.  136. He separated flesh [from] hair,[1] he worked cunningly.  [Footnote 1: The word is _kupu_, i.e., \"reed\" or \"sedge.\" It is possible that Marduk skinned Tiâmat.]  137. He slit Tiâmat open like a flat (?) fish [cut into] two pieces,  138. The one half he raised up and shaded the heavens therewith,  139. He pulled the bolt, he posted a guard,  140. He ordered them not to let her water escape.  141. He crossed heaven, he contemplated the regions thereof.  142. He betook himself to the abode of Nudimmud (Ea) that is opposite to the Deep (Apsu),  143. The Lord Marduk measured the dimensions of the Deep,  144. He founded E-Sharra, a place like unto it,  145. The abode E-Sharra, which he made to be heaven.  146. He made the-gods Anu, Bel and Ea to inhabit their [own] cities.    FIFTH TABLET.  1. He appointed the Stations for the great gods,  2. He set in heaven the Stars of the Zodiac which are their likenesses.  3. He fixed the year, he appointed the limits thereof.  4. He set up for the twelve months three stars apiece.  5. According to the day of the year he ... figures.  6. He founded the Station of Nibir (Jupiter) to settle their boundaries,  7. That none might exceed or fall short.  8. He set the Station of Bel and Ea thereby.  9. He opened great gates under shelter on both sides.  10. He made a strong corridor on the left and on the right.  11. He fixed the zenith in the heavenly vault (?)  12. He gave the god Nannar (i.e., the Moon-god) his brightness and committed the night to his care.  [Illustration: Portion of a tablet inscribed in Assyrian with a text of the Fifth Tablet of the Creation Series. [K. 3567.]]  13. He set him for the government of the night, to determine the day  14. Monthly, without fail, he set him in a crown (i.e., disk) [saying]:  15. \"At the beginning of the month when thou risest over the land,  16. \"Make [thy] horns to project to limit six days [of the month]  17. \"On the seventh day make thyself like a crown.  18. \"On the fourteenth day ...  [Lines 19-26 dealt further with Marduk's instructions to the Moon-god, but are too fragmentary to translate. After line 26 comes a break in the text of 40 lines; lines 66-74 are too fragmentary to translate, but they seem to have described further acts of Creation.]  75. The gods, his (Marduk's) fathers, looked on the net which he had made,  76. They observed how craftily the bow had been constructed,  77. They extolled the work which he had done.  78. [Then] the god Anu lifted up [the bow] in the company of the gods,  79. He kissed the bow [saying]: \"That ...\"  80. He proclaimed [the names] of the bow to be as follows:--  81. \"Verily, the first is 'Long Wood,' the second is ...  82. \"Its third name is 'Bow Star in heaven' ...\"  83. He fixed a station for it ...  [Of the remaining 57 lines of this tablet only fragments of 17 lines are preserved, and these yield no connected sense.]    SIXTH TABLET.  1. On hearing the words of the gods, the heart of Marduk moved him to carry out the works of a craftsman.  2. He opened his mouth, he spake to Ea that which he had planned in his heart, he gave counsel [saying]:  3. \"I will solidify blood, I will form bone.  4. \"I will set up man, 'Man' [shall be] his name.  5. \"I will create the man 'Man.'  6. \"The service of the gods shall be established, and I will set them (i.e., the gods) free.  7. \"I will make twofold the ways of the gods, and I will beautify [them].  8. \"They are [now] grouped together in one place, but they shall be partitioned in two.\"[1]  [Footnote 1: Reading, _ishtenish lu kuppudu-ma ana shina lu uzizu_.]  9. Ea answered and spake a word unto him  10. For the consolation of the gods[1] he repeated unto him a word of counsel [saying]:  [Footnote 1: _I.e._, \"to cause the gods to be content,\"]  11. \"Let one brother [god of their number] be given, let him suffer destruction that men may be fashioned.  12. \"Let the great gods be assembled, let this [chosen] one be given in order that they (i.e., the other gods) may be established.\"  13. Marduk assembled the great gods, [he came near] graciously, he issued a decree,  14. He opened his mouth, he addressed the gods; the King spake a word unto the Anunnaki [saying]:  15. \"Verily, that which I spake unto you aforetime was true.  16. \"[This time also] I speak truth. [Some there were who] opposed me.[1]  [Footnote 1: Literally \"they (indefinite) opposed me.\"]  17. \"Who was it that created the strife,  18. \"Who caused Tiâmat to revolt, to join battle with me?  19. \"Let him who created the strife be given [as sacrifice],  20. \"I will cause the axe in the act of sinking to do away his sin.\"  21. The great gods, the Igigi, answered him,  22. Unto the King of the gods of heaven and of earth, the Prince of the gods, their lord [they said]:  23. \"[It was] Kingu who created the strife,  24. \"Who made Tiâmat to revolt, to join battle [with thee].\"  25. They bound him in fetters [they brought] him before Ea, they inflicted punishment on him, they let his blood,  26. From his blood he (i.e., Ea) fashioned mankind for the service of the gods, and he set the gods free.  27. After Ea had fashioned man he ... laid service upon him.  28. [For] that work, which pleased him not, man was chosen: Marduk ...  29. Marduk, the King of the gods, divided ... he set the Anunnaki up on high.  30."]]]
