She was touched, then--touched to tears; but her resolves were not shaken.  \"Oh, Leila!\" resumed the prince, fondly, mistaking the nature of her emotion, and seeking to pursue the advantage he imagined he had gained, \"look at yonder sunbeam, struggling through the loophole of thy cell.  Is it not a messenger from the happy world? does it not plead for me? does it not whisper to thee of the green fields and the laughing vineyards, and all the beautiful prodigality of that earth thou art about to renounce for ever?  Dost thou dread my love?  Are the forms around thee, ascetic and lifeless, fairer to thine eyes than mine?  Dost thou doubt my power to protect thee?  I tell thee that the proudest nobles of Spain would flock around my banner, were it necessary to guard thee by force of arms.  Yet, speak the word--be mine--and I will fly hence with thee to climes where the Church has not cast out its deadly roots, and, forgetful of crowns and cares, live alone for thee:  Ah, speak!\"  \"My lord,\" said Leila, calmly, and rousing herself to the necessary effort, \"I am deeply and sincerely grateful for the interest you express --for the affection you avow.  But you deceive yourself.  I have pondered well over the alternative I have taken.  I do not regret nor repent--much less would I retract it.  The earth that you speak of, full of affections and of bliss to others, has no ties, no allurements for me.  I desire only peace, repose, and an early death.\"  \"Can it be possible,\" said the prince, growing pale, \"that thou lovest another?  Then, indeed, and then only, would my wooing be in vain.\"  The cheek of the novice grew deeply flushed, but the color soon subsided; she murmured to herself, \"Why should I blush to own it now?\" and then spoke aloud: \"Prince, I trust I have done with the world; and bitter the pang I feel when you call me back to it.  But you merit my candour; I have loved another; and in that thought, as in an urn, lie the ashes of all affection.  That other is of a different faith.  We may never--never meet again below, but it is a solace to pray that we may meet above. That solace, and these cloisters, are dearer to me than all the pomp, all the pleasures, of the world.\"  The prince sank down, and, covering his face with his hands, groaned aloud--but made no reply.  \"Go, then, Prince of Spain,\" continued the novice; \"son of the noble Isabel, Leila is not unworthy of her cares.  Go, and pursue the great destinies that await you.  And if you forgive--if you still cherish a thought of--the poor Jewish maiden, soften, alleviate, mitigate, the wretched and desperate doom that awaits the fallen race she has abandoned for thy creed.\"  \"Alas, alas!\" said the prince, mournfully;  \"thee alone, perchance, of all thy race, I could have saved from the bigotry that is fast covering this knightly land like the rising of an irresistible sea--and thou rejectest me!  Take time, at least, to pause--to consider.  Let me see thee again tomorrow.\"  \"No, prince, no--not again!  I will keep thy secret only if I see thee no more.  If thou persist in a suit that I feel to be that of sin and shame, then, indeed, mine honour--\"  \"Hold!\" interrupted Juan, with haughty impatience, \"I torment, I harass you no more.  I release you from my importunity.  Perhaps already I have stooped too low.\"  He drew the cowl over his features, and strode sullenly to the door; but, turning for one last gaze on the form that had so strangely fascinated a heart capable of generous emotions, the meek and despondent posture of the novice, her tender youth, her gloomy fate, melted his momentary pride and resentment.  \"God bless and reconcile thee, poor child!\" he said, in a voice choked with contending passions-- and the door closed upon his form.  \"I thank thee, Heaven, that it was not Muza!\" muttered Leila, breaking from a reverie in which she seemed to be communing with her own soul: \"I feel that I could not have resisted him.\"  With that thought she knelt down, in humble and penitent self-reproach, and prayed for strength.  Ere she had risen from her supplications, her solitude was again invaded by Torquemada, the Dominican.  This strange man, though the author of cruelties at which nature recoils, had some veins of warm and gentle feeling streaking, as it were, the marble of his hard character; and when he had thoroughly convinced himself of the pure and earnest zeal of the young convert, he relaxed from the grim sternness he had at first exhibited towards her.  He loved to exert the eloquence he possessed, in raising her spirit, in reconciling her doubts.  He prayed for her, and he prayed beside her, with passion and with tears.  He stayed long with the novice; and, when he left her, she was, if not happy, at least contented.  Her warmest wish now was to abridge the period of her novitiate, which, at her desire, the Church had already rendered merely a nominal probation.  She longed to put irresolution out of her power, and to enter at once upon the narrow road through the strait gate.  The gentle and modest piety of the young novice touched the sisterhood; she was endeared to all of them.  Her conversion was an event that broke the lethargy of their stagnant life.  She became an object of general interest, of avowed pride, of kindly compassion; and their kindness to her, who from her cradle had seen little of her own sex, had a great effect towards calming and soothing her mind.  But, at night, her dreams brought before her the dark and menacing countenance of her father. Sometimes he seemed to pluck her from the gates of heaven, and to sink with her into the yawning abyss below.  Sometimes she saw him with her beside the altar, but imploring her to forswear the Saviour, before whose crucifix she knelt.  Occasionally her visions were haunted, also, with Muza--but in less terrible guise She saw his calm and melancholy eyes fixed upon her; and his voice asked, \"Canst thou take a vow that makes it sinful to remember me?\"  The night, that usually brings balm and oblivion to the sad, was thus made more dreadful to Leila than the day.  Her health grew feebler, and feebler, but her mind still was firm.  In happier time and circumstance that poor novice would have been a great character; but she was one of the countless victims the world knows not of, whose virtues are in silent motives, whose struggles are in the solitary heart.  Of the prince she heard and saw no more.  There were times when she fancied, from oblique and obscure hints, that the Dominican had been aware of Don Juan's disguise and visit.  But, if so, that knowledge appeared only to increase the gentleness, almost the respect, which Torquemada manifested towards her.  Certainly, since that day, from some cause or other the priest's manner had been softened when he addressed her; and he who seldom had recourse to other arts than those of censure and of menace, often uttered sentiments half of pity and half of praise.  Thus consoled and supported in the day,--thus haunted and terrified by night, but still not repenting her resolve, Leila saw the time glide on to that eventful day when her lips were to pronounce that irrevocable vow which is the epitaph of life.  While in this obscure and remote convent progressed the history of an individual, we are summoned back to witness the crowning fate of an expiring dynasty.     CHAPTER III.  THE PAUSE BETWEEN DEFEAT AND SURRENDER.  The unfortunate Boabdil plunged once more amidst the recesses of the Alhambra.  Whatever his anguish or his despondency, none were permitted to share, or even to witness, his emotions.  But he especially resisted the admission to his solitude, demanded by his mother, implored by his faithful Amine, and sorrowfully urged by Muza: those most loved, or most respected, were, above all, the persons from whom he most shrank.  Almamen was heard of no more.  It was believed that he had perished in the battle.  But he was one of those who, precisely as they are effective when present, are forgotten in absence.  And, in the meanwhile, as the Vega was utterly desolated, and all supplies were cut off, famine, daily made more terrifically severe, diverted the attention of each humbler Moor from the fall of the city to his individual sufferings.  New persecutions fell upon the miserable Jews.  Not having taken any share in the conflict (as was to be expected from men who had no stake in the country which they dwelt in, and whose brethren had been taught so severe a lesson upon the folly of interference), no sentiment of fellowship in danger mitigated the hatred and loathing with which they were held; and as, in their lust of gain, many of them continued, amidst the agony and starvation of the citizens, to sell food at enormous prices, the excitement of the multitude against them--released by the state of the city from all restraint and law--made itself felt by the most barbarous excesses.  Many of the houses of the Israelites were attacked by the mob, plundered, razed to the ground, and the owner tortured to death, to extort confession of imaginary wealth.  Not to sell what was demanded was a crime; to sell it was a crime also.  These miserable outcasts fled to whatever secret places the vaults of their houses or the caverns in the hills within the city could yet afford them, cursing their fate, and almost longing even for the yoke of the Christian bigots.  Thus passed several days; the defence of the city abandoned to its naked walls and mighty gates.  The glaring sun looked down upon closed shops and depopulated streets, save when some ghostly and skeleton band of the famished poor collected, in a sudden paroxysm of revenge or despair, around the stormed and fired mansion of a detested Israelite.  At length Boabdil aroused himself from his seclusion; and Muza, to his own surprise, was summoned to the presence of the king.  He found Boabdil in one of the most gorgeous halls of his gorgeous palace.  Within the Tower of Comares"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9760"],["title","Leila or, the Siege of Granada, Book V. (#4)"],["body"," a vast chamber, still called the hall of the Ambassadors.  Here it was that Boabdil now held his court.  On the glowing walls hung trophies and banners, and here and there an Arabian portrait of some bearded king.  By the windows, which overlooked the most lovely banks of the Llarro, gathered the santons and alfaquis, a little apart from the main crowd.  Beyond, through half-veiling draperies, might be seen the great court of the Alberca, whose peristyles were hung with flowers; while, in the centre, the gigantic basin, which gives its name to the court, caught the sunlight obliquely, and its waves glittered on the eye from amidst the roses that then clustered over it.  In the audience hall itself, a canopy, over the royal cushions on which Boabdil reclined, was blazoned with the heraldic insignia of Granada's monarchs.  His guard, and his mutes, and his eunuchs, and his courtiers, and his counsellors, and his captains, were ranged in long files on either side the canopy.  It seemed the last flicker of the lamp of the Moorish empire, that hollow and unreal pomp!  As Muza approached the monarch, he was startled by the change of his countenance: the young and beautiful Boabdil seemed to have grown suddenly old; his eyes were sunken, his countenance sown with wrinkles, and his voice sounded broken and hollow on the ears of his kinsman.  \"Come hither, Muza,\" said he; \"seat thyself beside me, and listen as thou best canst to the tidings we are about to hear.\"  As Muza placed himself on a cushion, a little below the king, Boabdil motioned to one amongst the crowd.  \"Hamet,\" said he, \"thou hast examined the state of the Christian camp; what news dost thou bring?\"  \"Light of the Faithful,\" answered the Moor, \"it is a camp no longer--it has already become a city.  Nine towns of Spain were charged with the task; stone has taken the place of canvas; towers and streets arise like the buildings of a genius; and the misbelieving king hath sworn that this new city shall not be left until Granada sees his standard on its walls.\"  \"Go on,\" said Boabdil, calmly.  \"Traders and men of merchandise flock thither daily; the spot is one bazaar; all that should supply our famishing country pours its plenty into their mart.\"  Boabdil motioned to the Moor to withdraw, and an alfaqui advanced in his stead.  \"Successor of the Prophet, and darling of the world!\" said the reverend man, \"the alfaquis and seers of Granada implore thee on their knees to listen to their voice.  They have consulted the Books of Fate; thy have implored a sign from the Prophet; and they find that the glory has left thy people and thy crown.  The fall of Granada is predestined; God is great!\"  \"You shall have my answer forthwith,\" said Boabdil.  \"Abdelemic, approach.\"  From the crowd came an aged and white-bearded man, the governor of the city.  \"Speak, old man,\" said the king.  \"Oh, Boabdil!\" said the veteran, with faltering tones, while the tears rolled down his cheeks; \"son of a race of kings and heroes! would that thy servant had fallen dead on thy threshold this day, and that the lips of a Moorish noble had never been polluted by the words that I now utter! Our state is hopeless; our granaries are as the sands of the desert: there is in them life neither for beast nor man.  The war-horse that bore the hero is now consumed for his food; the population of thy city, with one voice, cry for chains and--bread!  I have spoken.\"  \"Admit the Ambassador of Egypt,\" said Boabdil, as Abdelmelic retired. There was a pause: one of the draperies at the end of the hall was drawn aside; and with the slow and sedate majesty of their tribe and land, paced forth a dark and swarthy train, the envoys of the Egyptian soldan. Six of the band bore costly presents of gems and weapons, and the procession closed with four veiled slaves, whose beauty had been the boast of the ancient valley of the Nile.  \"Sun of Granada and day--star of the faithful!\" said the chief of the Egyptians, \"my lord, the Soldan of Egypt, delight of the world, and rose- tree of the East, thus answers to the letters of Boabdil.  He grieves that be cannot send the succour thou demandest; and informing himself of the condition of thy territories, he finds that Granada no longer holds a seaport by which his forces (could he send them) might find an entrance into Spain.  He implores thee to put thy trust in Allah, who will not desert his chosen ones, and lays these gifts, in pledge of amity and love, at the feet of my lord the king.\"  \"It is a gracious and well-timed offering,\" said Boabdil, with a writhing lip; \"we thank him.\"  There was now a long and dead silence as the ambassadors swept from the hall of audience, when Boabdil suddenly raised his head from his breast and looked around his hall with a kingly and majestic look: \"Let the heralds of Ferdinand of Spain approach.\"  A groan involuntarily broke from the breast of Muza: it was echoed by a murmur of abhorrence and despair from the gallant captains who stood around; but to that momentary burst succeeded a breathless silence, as from another drapery, opposite the royal couch, gleamed the burnished mail of the knights of Spain.  Foremost of these haughty visitors, whose iron heels clanked loudly on the tesselated floor, came a noble and stately form, in full armour, save the helmet, and with a mantle of azure velvet, wrought with the silver cross that made the badge of the Christian war.  Upon his manly countenance was visible no sign of undue arrogance or exultation; but something of that generous pity which brave men feel for conquered foes dimmed the lustre of his commanding eye, and softened the wonted sternness of his martial bearing.  He and his train approached the king with a profound salutation of respect; and falling back, motioned to the herald that accompanied him, and whose garb, breast and back, was wrought with the arms of Spain, to deliver himself of his mission.  \"To Boabdil!\" said the herald, with a loud voice, that filled the whole expanse, and thrilled with various emotions the dumb assembly.  \"To Boabdil el Chico, King of Granada, Ferdinand of Arragon and Isabel of Castile send royal greeting.  They command me to express their hope that the war is at length concluded; and they offer to the King of Granada such terms of capitulation as a king, without dishonour, may receive.  In the stead of this city, which their Most Christian Majesties will restore to their own dominion, as is just, they offer, O king, princely territories in the Alpuxarras mountains to your sway, holding them by oath of fealty to the Spanish crown.  To the people of Granada, their Most Christian Majesties promise full protection of property, life, and faith under a government by their own magistrates, and according to their own laws; exemption from tribute for three years; and taxes thereafter, regulated by the custom and ratio of their present imposts.  To such Moors as, discontented with these provisions, would abandon Granada, are promised free passage for themselves and their wealth.  In return for these marks of their royal bounty, their Most Christian Majesties summon Granada to surrender (if no succour meanwhile arrive) within seventy days.  And these offers are now solemnly recorded in the presence, and through the mission, of the noble and renowned knight, Gonzalvo of Cordova, deputed by their Most Christian Majesties from their new city of Santa Fe.\"  When the herald had concluded, Boabdil cast his eye over his thronged and splendid court.  No glance of fire met his own; amidst the silent crowd, a resigned content was alone to be perceived: the proposals exceeded the hope of the besieged.  \"And,\" asked Boabdil, with a deep-drawn sigh, \"if we reject these offers?\"  \"Noble prince,\" said Gonzalvo, earnestly, \"ask us not to wound thine ears with the alternative.  Pause, and consider of our offers; and, if thou doubtest, O brave king! mount the towers of thine Alhambra, survey our legions marshalled beneath thy walls, and turn thine eyes upon a brave people, defeated, not by human valour, but by famine, and the inscrutable will of God.\"  \"Your monarchs shall have our answer, gentle Christian, perchance ere nightfall.  And you, Sir Knight, who hast delivered a message bitter for kings to bear, receive, at least, our thanks for such bearing as might best mitigate the import.  Our vizier will bear to your apartment those tokens of remembrance that are yet left to the monarch of Granada to bestow.\"  \"Muza,\" resumed the king, as the Spaniards left the presence--\"thou hast heard all.  What is the last counsel thou canst give thy sovereign?\"  The fierce Moor had with difficulty waited this licence to utter such sentiments as death only could banish from that unconquerable heart.  He rose, descended from the couch, and, standing a little below the king, and facing the motley throng of all of wise or brave yet left to Granada, thus spoke:--  \"Why should we surrender? two hundred thousand inhabitants are yet within our walls; of these, twenty thousand, at least, are Moors, who have hands and swords.  Why should we surrender?  Famine presses us, it is true; but hunger, that makes the lion more terrible, shall it make the man more base?  Do ye despair? so be it! despair in the valiant ought to have an irresistible force.  Despair has made cowards brave: shall it sink the brave to cowards?  Let us arouse the people; hitherto we have depended too much upon the nobles.  Let us collect our whole force, and march upon this new city, while the soldiers of Spain are employed in their new profession of architects and builders.  Hear me, O God and prophet of the Moslem! hear one who never was forsworn!  If, Moors of Granada, ye adopt my counsel, I cannot promise ye victory, but I promise ye never to live without it: I promise ye, at least, your independence--for the dead know no chains!  If we cannot live, let us so die that we may leave to remotest ages a glory that shall be more"]]]
