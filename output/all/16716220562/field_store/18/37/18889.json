The mouth is generally furnished with two hooks which serve instead of jaws. The pupæ of Diptera are of two kinds. In the true flies, the outer skin of the full-grown larva is not shed, but contracts and hardens, thus assuming the appearance of an oval brownish shell or case, within which the insect changes into a chrysalis. The pupæ of the gnats, on the contrary, have the limbs distinct and enclosed in sheaths. They are generally inactive, but some of the aquatic species continue to swim about.  One group of Flies, which is parasitic on horses, sheep, bats, and other animals, has been called the Pupipara, because it was supposed that they were not born until they had arrived at the condition of pupæ. They come into the world in the form of smooth, ovate bodies, much resembling ordinary dipterous pupæ, but as Leuckart has shown,[11] they are true, though abnormal, larvæ.  The next order, that of the Aphaniptera, is very small in number, containing only the different species of Flea. The larva is long, cylindrical, and legless; the chrysalis is motionless, and the perfect insect is too well known, at least, as regards its habits, to need any description.  The Heteroptera, unlike the preceding orders of insects, quit the egg in a form differing from that of the perfect insect principally in the absence of wings, which are gradually acquired. In their metamorphoses they resemble the Orthoptera, and are active through life. The majority are dull in colour, though some few are very beautiful. The species constituting this group, though very numerous, are generally small, and not so familiarly known to us as those of the other large orders, with indeed one exception, the well-known Bug. This is not, apparently, an indigenous insect, but seems to have been introduced. The word is indeed used by old writers, but either as meaning a bugbear, or in a general sense, and not with reference to this particular insect. In this country it never acquires wings, but is stated to do so sometimes in warmer climates. The Heteroptera cannot exactly be said either to sting or bite. The jaws, of which, as usual among insects, there are two pairs, are like needles, which are driven into the flesh, and the blood is then sucked up the lower lip, which has the form of a tube. This peculiar structure of the mouth prevails throughout the whole order; consequently their nutriment consists almost entirely of the juices of animals or plants. The Homoptera agree with the Heteroptera in the structure of the mouth, and in the metamorphoses. They differ principally in the front wings, which in Homoptera are membranous throughout, while in the Heteroptera, the front part is thickened and leathery. As in the Heteroptera, however, so also in the Homoptera, some species do not acquire wings. The Cicada, celebrated for its chirp, and the lanthorn fly, belong to this group. So also does the so-called Cuckoo-spit, so common in our gardens, which has the curious faculty of secreting round itself a quantity of frothy fluid which serves to protect it from its enemies. But the best known insects of this group are the Aphides or Plant-lice; while the most useful belong to the Coccidæ, or scale insects, from one species of which we obtain the substance called lac, so extensively used in the manufacture of sealing-wax and varnish. Several species also have been used in dyeing, especially the Cochineal insect of Mexico, a species which lives on the cactus. The male _Coccus_ is a minute, active insect, with four large wings; while the female, on the contrary, never acquires wings, but is very sluggish, broad, more or less flattened, and in fact, when full grown, looks like a small brown, red, or white scale.  The larva of the order Lepidoptera are familiar to us all, under the name of caterpillars. The insects of this order in their larval condition are almost all phytophagous, and are very uniform both in structure and in habits. The body is long and cylindrical, consisting of thirteen segments; the head is armed with powerful jaws; the three following segments, the future prothorax, mesothorax, and meta-thorax, each bears a pair of simple articulated legs. Of the posterior segments, five also bear false or pro-legs, which are short, unjointed, and provided with a number of hooklets. A caterpillar leads a dull and uneventful life; it eats ravenously, and grows rapidly, casting its skin several times during the process, which generally lasts only a few weeks; though in some cases, as for instance that of the goat-moth, it extends over a period of two or three years, after which the larva changes into a quiescent pupa or chrysalis.     CHAPTER II.  _THE INFLUENCE OF EXTERNAL CONDITIONS ON THE FORM AND STRUCTURE OF LARVÆ._   The facts recapitulated briefly in the preceding chapter show, that the forms of insect larvæ depend greatly on the group to which they belong. Thus the same tree may harbour larvæ of Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera; each presenting the form typical of the family to which it belongs.  If, again, we take a group, such, for instance, as the Lamellicorn beetles, we shall find larvæ extremely similar in form, yet very different in habits. Those, for instance, of the common cockchafer (Fig. 1) feed on the roots of grass; those of _Cetonia aurata_ (Fig. 2) inhabit ants’ nests; the larvæ of the genus _Trox_ (Fig. 3) are found on dry animal substances; of _Oryctes_ (Fig. 4) in tan-pits; of _Aphodius_ (Fig. 5) in dung; of _Lucanus_ (the stag-beetle, Fig. 6) in wood.  [Illustration: FIG. 1, Larva of the Cockchafer (_Melolontha_). (Westwood, Int. to the Modern Classification of Insects, vol. i. p. 194.). 2, Larva of _Cetonia_. 3, Larva of _Trox_. 4, Larva of _Oryctes_. 5, Larva of _Aphodius_ (Chapuis and Candèze, Mém. Soc. Roy. Liège, 1853). 6, Larva of _Lucanus_. (Packard, Guide to the Study of Insects, Fig. 403).]  On the other hand, in the present chapter it will be my object to show that the form of the larva depends very much on the conditions of its life. Thus, those larvæ which are internal parasites, whether in animals or plants, are vermiform, as are those which live in cells, and depend on their parents for food. On the other hand, larvæ which burrow in wood have strong jaws and generally somewhat weak thoracic legs; whilst those which feed on leaves have the thoracic legs more developed, but less so than the carnivorous species. Now, the Hymenoptera, as a general rule, belong to the first category: the larvæ of the Ichneumons, &c., which live in animals,—those of the Cynipidæ, inhabiting galls,—and those of ants, bees, wasps, &c., which are fed by their parents, are fleshy, apodal grubs; though the remarkable fact that the embryos of bees in one stage of their development possess rudiments of thoracic legs which subsequently disappear, seems to show, not indeed that the larvæ of bees were ever hexapod, but that bees are descended from ancestors which had hexapod larvæ, and that the present apod condition of these larvæ is not original, but results from their mode of life.  On the other hand, the larvæ of _Sirex_ (Fig. 14) being wood-burrowers, possess well-developed thoracic legs. Again, the larvæ of the Tenthredinidæ, which feed upon leaves, closely resemble the caterpillars of Lepidoptera, even to the presence of abdominal pro-legs.  [Illustration: FIG. 7, Larva of _Brachytarsus_ (Ratzeburg, Forst. Insecten). 8, Larva of _Crioceris_ (Westwood, loc. cit.).]  The larvæ of most Coleoptera (Beetles) are active, hexapod, and more or less flattened: but those which live inside vegetable tissues, such as the weevils, are apod fleshy grubs, like those of Hymenoptera. Pl. II., Fig. 6, represents the larva of the nut-weevil, _Balaninus_ (Pl. I., Fig. 6), and it will be seen that it closely resembles Pl. II., Fig. 5, which represents that of a fly (_Anthrax_), Pl. I., Fig. 5, and Pl. II., Figs. 7, 8, and 9, which represent respectively those of a _Cynips_ or gall-fly (Pl. I., Fig. 7), an ant (Pl. I., Fig. 8), and wasp (Pl. I., Fig. 9). Nor is _Balaninus_ the only genus of Coleoptera which affords us examples of this fact. Thus in the genus _Scolytus_ (Pl. I., Fig. 4), the larvæ (Pl. II., Fig. 4), which, as already mentioned, feed on the bark of the elm, closely resemble those just described, as also do those of _Brachytarsus_ (Fig. 7). On the other hand, the larvæ of certain beetles feed on leaves, like the caterpillars of Lepidoptera; thus that of _Crioceris Asparagi_ (Fig. 8)—which, as its name denotes, feeds on the asparagus—closely resembles the larvæ of certain Lepidoptera, as for instance of _Thecla spini_. From this point of view the transformations of the genus _Sitaris_ (Pl. III., Fig. 4), which have been very carefully investigated by M. Fabre, are peculiarly interesting.[12]  [Illustration: FIG. 9, Larva of _Sitaris numeralis_ (Fabre, Ann. des Sci. Nat., sér. 4, tome vii.). 10, Larva of _Sitaris humeralis_, in the second stage. 11, Larva of _Sitaris humeralis_, in the third stage. 12, Larva of _Sitaris humeralis_, in the fourth stage. 13, Pupa of _Sitaris_.]  The genus _Sitaris_ (a small beetle allied to Cantharis, the blister-fly, and to _Meloë_, the oil-beetle) is parasitic on a kind of Bee (Anthophora), which excavates subterranean galleries, each leading to a cell. The eggs of the _Sitaris_, which are deposited at the entrance of these galleries, are hatched at the end of September or beginning of October; and M. Fabre not unnaturally expected that the young larvæ, which are active little creatures with six serviceable legs (Fig. 9), would at once eat their way into the cells of the Anthophora. No such thing: till the month of April following they remain without leaving their birthplace, and consequently without food; nor do they in this long time change either in form or size. M. Fabre ascertained this,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38207"],["title","On the Origin and Metamorphoses of Insects (#6)"],["body"," not only by examining the burrows of the _Anthophoras_, but also by direct observation of some young larvæ kept in captivity. In April, however, his captives at last awoke from their long lethargy, and hurried anxiously about their prisons. Naturally inferring that they were in search of food, M. Fabre supposed that this would consist either of the larvæ or pupæ of the Anthophora, or of the honey with which it stores its cell. All three were tried without success. The first two were neglected, and the larvæ, when placed on the latter, either hurried away, or perished in the attempt, being evidently unable to deal with the sticky substance. M. Fabre was in despair: “Jamais expérience,” he says, “n’a éprouvé pareille déconfiture. Larves, nymphes, cellules, miel, je vous ai tous offert; que voulez-vous donc, bestioles maudites?” The first ray of light came to him from our countryman, Newport, who ascertained that a small parasite found by Léon Dufour on one of the wild bees, and named by him Triungulinus, was, in fact, the larva of _Meloë_. The larvæ of _Sitaris_ much resembled Dufour’s Triungulinus; and acting on this hint, M. Fabre examined many specimens of Anthophora, and found on them at last the larvæ of his _Sitaris_. The males of Anthophora emerge from the pupæ sooner than the females, and M. Fabre ascertained that, as they come out of their galleries, the little _Sitaris_ larvæ fasten upon them. Not, however, for long: instinct teaches them that they are not yet in the straight path of development; and, watching their opportunity, they pass from the male to the female bee. Guided by these indications, M. Fabre examined several cells of the Anthophora: in some, the egg of the Anthophora floated by itself on the surface of the honey; in others, on the egg, as on a raft, sat the still more minute larva of the _Sitaris_. The mystery was solved. At the moment when the egg is laid the _Sitaris_ larva springs upon it. Even while the poor mother is carefully fastening up her cell, her mortal enemy is beginning to devour her offspring: for the egg of the Anthophora serves not only as a raft, but as a repast. The honey which is enough for either, would be too little for both; and the _Sitaris_, therefore, at its first meal, relieves itself from its only rival. After eight days the egg is consumed, and on the empty shell the _Sitaris_ undergoes its first transformation, and makes its appearance in a very different form, as shown in Fig. 10.  The honey which was fatal before is now necessary; the activity which before was necessary is now useless; consequently, with the change of skin, the active, slim larva changes into a white, fleshy grub, so organized as to float on the surface of the honey, with the mouth beneath, and the spiracles above the surface: “grâce à l’embonpoint du ventre,” says M. Fabre, “la larve est à l’abri de l’asphyxie.” In this state it remains until the honey is consumed; then the animal contracts, and detaches itself from its skin, within which the further transformations take place. In the next stage, which M. Fabre calls the pseudo-chrysalis (Fig. 11), the larva has a solid corneous envelope and an oval shape; and in its colour, consistency, and immobility reminds one of a Dipterous pupa. The time passed in this condition varies much. When it has elapsed, the animal moults again, again changes its form, and assumes that shown in Fig. 12; after this it becomes a pupa (Fig. 13) without any remarkable peculiarities. Finally, after these wonderful changes and adventures, in the month of August the perfect _Sitaris_ (Pl. III., Fig. 4) makes its appearance.  On the other hand, there are cases in which larvæ diverge remarkably from the ordinary type of the group to which they belong, without, as it seems in our present imperfect state of information, any sufficient reason.  Thus the ordinary type of Hymenopterous larva, as we have already seen, is a fleshy apod grub; although those of the leaf-eating and wood-boring groups, Tenthredinidæ and Siricidæ (Fig. 14), are caterpillars, more or less closely resembling those of Lepidoptera. There is, however, a group of minute Hymenoptera, the larvæ of which reside within the eggs or larvæ of other insects. It is difficult to understand why these larvæ should differ from those of Ichneumons, which are also parasitic Hymenoptera, and should be, as will be seen by the accompanying figures, of such remarkable and grotesque forms. The first known of these curious larvæ was observed by De Filippi,[13] who, having collected some of the transparent eggs of a small Beetle (_Rhynchites betuleti_), to his great surprise found more than half of them attacked by a parasite, which proved to be the larva of a minute Hymenopterous insect belonging to the Pteromalidæ. Fig. 15 shows the egg of the Beetle, with the parasitic larva, which is represented on a larger scale in Fig. 16.  [Illustration: FIG. 14, Larva of _Sirex_ (Westwood, loc. cit.). 15, Egg of _Rhynchites_, showing the parasitic Larva in the interior. 16, the parasitic Larva more magnified.]  More recently this group has been studied by M. Ganin,[14] who thus describes the development of _Platygaster_. The egg, as in allied Hymenopterous families, for instance in _Cynips_, is elongated and club-shaped (Fig. 17). After a while a large nucleated cell appears in the centre (Fig. 18). This nucleated cell divides (Fig. 19) and subdivides. The outermost cells continue the same process, thus forming an outer investing layer. The central, on the contrary, enlarges considerably, and develops within itself a number of daughter cells (Figs. 20 and 21), which gradually form a mulberry-like mass, thus giving rise to the embryo (Fig. 22).  [Illustration: FIG. 17, Egg of _Platygaster_ (after Ganin). 18, Egg of _Platygaster_ showing the central cell. 19, Egg of _Platygaster_ after the division of the central wall. 20, Egg of Platygaster more advanced. 21, Egg of _Platygaster_ more advanced. 22, Egg of Platygaster showing the rudiment of the embryo.]  Ganin met with the larvæ of _Platygaster_ in those of a small gnat, _Cecidomyia_. Sometimes as many as fifteen parasites occurred in one gnat, but as a rule only one of these attained maturity. The three species of _Platygaster _differ considerably in form, as shown in Figs. 23-25. They creep about within the larva of _Cecidomyia_ by means of the strong hooked feet, _kf_, somewhat aided by movements of the tail. They possess a mouth, stomach, and muscles, but the nervous, vascular, and respiratory systems do not make their appearance until later. After some time the larva (Fig. 23) changes its skin, assuming the form represented in Fig. 26. In this moult the last abdominal segment of the first larva is entirely thrown off: not merely the outer skin, as in the case of the other segments, but also the hypodermis and the muscles. This larva, as will be seen by the figure, resembles a barrel or egg in form, and is .870 mm. in length, the external appendages having disappeared, and the segments being indicated only by the arrangement of the muscles. _slkf_ is the œsophagus leading into a wide stomach which occupies nearly the whole body, _gsae_ is the rudiment of the supra-œsophageal ganglia, _bsm_ the ventral nervous cords. The ventral nervous mass has the form of a broad band, with straight sides; it consists of embryonal cells, and remains in this undeveloped condition during the whole larval state.  [Illustration: FIG. 23, Larva of _Platygaster_ (after Ganin)—_mo_, mouth; _a_, antenna; _kf_, hooked feet; _z_, toothed process; _lfg_, lateral process; _f_, branches of the tail. 24, Larva of another species of _Platygaster_. The letters indicate the same parts as in the preceding figure. 25, Larva of a third species of _Platygaster_. The letters indicate the same parts as in the preceding figures. 26, Larva of _Platygaster_ in the second stage—_mo_, mouth; _slkf_, œsophagus; _gsae_, supra-œsophageal ganglion; _lm_, muscles; _bsm_, nervous system; _ga_, _gh_, rudiments of the reproductive glands. 27, Larva of _Platygaster_ in the third stage—_mo_, mouth; _md_, mandibles; _gsae_, supra-œsophageal ganglion; _slk_, œsophagus; _ag_, ducts of the salivary glands; _bnm_, ventral nervous system; _sp_, salivary glands; _msl_, stomach; _im_, imaginal discs; _tr_, tracheæ; _fk_, fatty tissue; _ed_, intestine; _ga_, rudiments of reproductive organs; _ew_, wider portion of intestine; _ao_, posterior opening.]  At the next moult the larva enters its third state, which, as far as the external form (Fig. 27) is concerned, differs from the second only in being somewhat more elongated. The internal organs, however, are much more complex and complete. The tracheæ have made their appearance, and the mouth is provided with a pair of mandibles. From this point the metamorphoses of _Platygaster_ do not appear to differ materially from those of other parasitic Hymenoptera.  An allied genus, _Polynema_, has also very curious larvæ. The perfect insect is aquatic in its habits, swimming by means of its wings; flying, if we may say so, under water.[15] It lays its eggs inside those of Dragon-flies; and the embryo, as shown in Fig. 28, has the form of a bottle-shaped mass of undifferentiated embryonal cells, covered by a thin cuticle, but without any trace of further organization. Protected by the egg-shell of the Dragon-fly, and bathed in the nourishing fluid of the Dragon-fly’s egg, the young _Polynema_ imbibes nourishment through its whole surface, and increases rapidly in size. The digestive canal gradually makes its appearance; the cellular mass forms a new skin beneath the original cuticle, distinctly divided into segments, and provided with certain appendages. After a while the old cuticle is thrown off, and the larva gradually assumes the form shown in Fig. 29. The subsequent metamorphoses of _Polynema_ offer no special peculiarities.
