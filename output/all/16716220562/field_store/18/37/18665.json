It's so dark the fish can't see to get themselves caught anyway. I'm cold. I'm going home.\"  Menie got up very slowly and pulled up his line.  As they turned toward the shore, Monnie cried out, \"Look, look! The sky is on fire!\" It looked like it, truly!  Great white streamers were flashing from the Edge of the World, clear up into the sky! They danced like flames. Sometimes they shot long banners of blue or green fire up to the very stars. Overhead the sky shone red as blood. The stars seemed blotted out.  The twins had seen many wonderful things in the sky, but never such color as this. Their eyes grew as round and big and popping as those of Monnie's codfish, while they watched the long banners join themselves into a great waving curtain of color that hung clear across the heavens.  \"What is it? Oh, what is it?\" they gasped. They were too astonished to move, and they were a good deal frightened, too. They never knew the sky could act like that.  Monnie felt her black hair rise under her little fur hood. She seized Menie's coat. \"Do you suppose the world is going to be burned up?\" she said.  Just then they heard a voice calling, \"Menie, Monnie, where are you?\"  \"Here we are,\" they answered. Their teeth were chattering with cold and fright, and they ran up the slope and flung themselves into their mother's arms.  \"Oh, Mother, what is the matter with the sky?\" they gasped.  Then Koolee looked up too. The long streamers were still flinging themselves up toward the red dome overhead.  We call this the \"aurora,\" or \"northern lights,\" and know that electricity causes it, but the twins' mother couldn't know that. She told them just what had been told her when she was a little girl.  She said, \"That is the dance of the Spirits of the Dead! Haven't you ever seen it before?\"  \"Not like this,\" said the twins. \"This is so big, and so red!\"  \"The sky is not often so bright,\" said Koolee. \"Some say it is the spirits of little children dancing and playing together in the sky! They will not hurt you. You need not be afraid. See how they dance in a ring all around the Edge of the World! They look as if they were having fun.\"  \"It goes around the Edge of the World just like the flames around our lamp,\" said Menie. \"Maybe it's the Giants' lamp!\"  Menie and Monnie believed in Giants. So did their mother. They thought the Giants lived in the middle of the Great White World, where the snow never melts.  The thought of the Giants scared them all. The twins gave the fish to their mother, and then they all three scuttled up the snowy slope toward the bright window of their igloo just as fast as they could go. When they got inside they found some hot bear's meat waiting for them, and Monnie had both the eyes from her fish to eat. But she gave one to Menie.  When they were warmed and fed, they pulled off their little fur suits, crawled into the piles of warm skins on the sleeping bench, and in two minutes were sound asleep.     IV.  THE SNOW HOUSE  THE SNOW HOUSE  I.   It is very hard to tell what day it is, or what hour in the day, in a place where the days and nights are all mixed up, and where there are no clocks.  Menie and Monnie had never seen a clock in their whole lives. If they had they would have thought it was alive, and perhaps would have been afraid of it.  But people everywhere in the world get sleepy, so the Eskimos sometimes count their time by \"sleeps.\" Instead of saying five days ago, they say \"five sleeps\" ago.  The night after the bear was killed it began to snow. The wind howled around the igloo and piled the snow over it in huge drifts.  The dogs were buried under it and had to be dug out, all but Nip and Tup. They stayed inside with the twins and slept in their bed.  The twins and their father and mother were glad to stay in the warm hut.  At last the snow stopped, the air cleared, and the twins and Kesshoo went out. Koolee stayed in the igloo.  She sat on her sleeping bench upon a pile of soft furs. A bear's skin was stretched up on the wall behind her. She had a cozy nest to work in.  The lamp stood on the bench beside her. She was making a beautiful new suit for Menie. It was made of fawn-skin as soft as velvet, and the hood and sleeves were trimmed with white rabbit's fur.  Her thimble was made of ivory, and her needle too. Her thread was a fine strip of hide. There was a bunch of such thread beside her.  Soon Kesshoo came in, bringing with him a dried fish and a piece of bear's meat, from the storehouse.  Koolee looked up from her sewing. \"Isn't it five sleeps since you killed the bear?\" she said.  Kesshoo counted on his fingers. \"Yes,\" he said, \"it is five sleeps.\"  \"Then it is time to eat the bear's head,\" said Koolee. \"His spirit is now with our fathers.\"  \"Why not have a feast?\" said Kesshoo. \"There hasn't been any fresh meat in the village since the bear was killed, and I don't believe the rest have had anything to eat but dried fish. We have plenty of bear's meat still.\"  Koolee hopped down off the bench and put some more moss into the lamp.  \"You bring in the meat,\" she said, \"and tell the twins to go to all the igloos and invite the people to come at sunset.\"  \"All right,\" Kesshoo answered, and he went out at once to the storehouse to get the meat.   II.  When he came out of the tunnel, Kesshoo found the twins trying to make a snow house for the dogs. They weren't getting on very well.  Kesshoo could make wonderful snow houses. He had made a beautiful one when the first heavy snows of winter had come, and the family had lived in it while Koolee finished building the stone igloo. The twins had watched him make it. It seemed so easy they were sure they could do it too. Kesshoo said, \"If you will run to all the igloos and tell the people to come at sunset to eat the bear's head, I will help you build the snow house for the dogs.\"  Menie and Monnie couldn't run. Nobody could. The snow was too deep. They went in every step above their knees. But they ploughed along and gave their message at each igloo.  Everybody was very glad to come, and Koko said, \"I'll come right now and stay if you want me to.\"  \"Come along,\" said the twins.  They went back to their own house, kicking the snow to make a path. Koko went with them. The snow was just the right kind for a snow house. It packed well and made good blocks.  While the twins were away giving the invitations, Kesshoo carried great pieces of bear's meat into the house.  Koolee put in the cooking pan all the meat it would hold, and kept the blaze bright in the lamp underneath to cook it.  Then Kesshoo took his long ivory knife and went out to help the twins with the snow house, as he had promised.  \"See, this is the way,\" he said to them.  He took an unbroken patch of snow where no one had stepped. He made a wide sweep of his arm and marked a circle in the snow with his knife.  The circle was just as big as he meant the house to be. Then he cut out blocks of snow from the space inside the circle. He placed these big blocks of snow around the circle on the line he had marked with his knife.  When he got the first row done Menie said, \"I can do that! Let me try.\"  He took the knife and cut out a block. It wasn't nice and even like his father's blocks.  \"That will never do,\" his father said. \"Your house will tumble down unless your blocks are true.\"  He made the sides of the block straight by cutting off some of the snow.  \"Now all the other blocks in this row must be just like this one,\" he said. Koko tried next. His block was almost right the first time. But then, as I have told you before, Koko was six.  Monnie tried the next one. I am sorry to say hers wouldn't do at all. It was dreadfully crooked. They took turns. Menie cut a new block while Koko placed the last one on the snow wall.  Kesshoo had to put on the top blocks to make the roof. Neither Koko nor Menie could do it right, though they tried and tried. It is a very hard thing to do. When the blocks were all laid up and the dome finished, Kesshoo said, \"Now, Monnie can help pack it with snow.\"  Monnie got the snow shovel. The snow shovel was made of three flat pieces of wood sewed together with leather thongs. It had an edge of horn sewed on with thongs, too.  Monnie threw loose snow on the snow house and spatted it down with the back of the shovel.  While she was doing this, Menie and Koko built a tunnel entrance for the dogs just like the big one on the stone house.  They worked so hard they were warm as toast, though it was as cold as our coldest winter weather; and when it was all finished Menie ran clear over it just to show how strong and well built it was.   III.  When the snow house was all ready, Menie called the three big dogs. Tooky was the leader, and the three dogs together were Kesshoo's sledge team. Tooky was a hunting dog too.  When Menie called the dogs, the dogs thought they were going to be harnessed, so they hid behind the igloo and pretended they didn't hear. Koko and Menie followed them, but the moment they got near, the dogs bounded away. They went round to the front of the igloo and ran into the tunnel.  Koolee was just turning the meat in the pan with a pointed stick. There was a piece of bear's meat lying on the bench.  The dogs smelled the meat. They stuck their heads into the room, and when Koolee's back was turned, Tooky stole the meat!  Just then Koolee turned around. She saw Tooky. She shrieked, \"Oh, my meat, my meat!\" and whacked Tooky across the nose with the snow stick!  But Tooky was bound to have the meat. She ran out of the tunnel with it in her mouth, just as Menie and Koko got round to the front of the igloo once more.  \"I-yi! I-yi!\" they screamed, \"Tooky's got the meat!\" Kesshoo caught up his dog-whip and came running from the storehouse.  The other two dogs wanted the meat too. They flew at Tooky and snarled and fought with her to get it.  Then Koolee's head appeared in the tunnel hole! Tooky was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3774"],["title","The Eskimo Twins (#4)"],["body","in the snow in front of the tunnel, trying to fight off the other two dogs and guard the meat at the same time.  She wasn't doing a thing with her tail, but she was very busy with all the rest of her. Her tail was pointed right toward the tunnel.  The moment she saw it Koolee seized the tail with both hands and jerked it like everything! Tooky was so surprised she yelped. And when she opened her mouth to yelp, of course she dropped the meat.  Just at that instant Kesshoo's whip lash came singing about the ears of all three dogs.  \"Snap, snap,\" it went. They jumped to get out of the way of the lash.  Then Koolee leaped forward and snatched the meat from under their noses, and scuttled back with it into the tunnel before you could say Jack Robinson.  It is dangerous to snatch meat away from hungry dogs. If Kesshoo hadn't been slashing at them with his whip, and if Menie and Koko hadn't been screaming at them with all their might, so the dogs were nearly distracted, Koolee might have been badly bitten.  Just then Monnie came up with some dried fish. She threw one of the fish over in front of the snow house.  The dogs saw it and leaped for it. Then she threw another into the snow hut itself. They went after that. She fed them all with dried fish until they were so full they curled up in the snow house and went to sleep.     V.  THE FEAST  THE FEAST  I   The moment the sun had gone out of sight all the people in the village came pouring out of their tunnels on their way to the feast at Kesshoo's house.  Kesshoo's house was so small that it seemed as if all the people could not possibly get into it.  But the Eskimos are used to crowding into very small spaces, indeed. Sometimes a man and his wife and all his children will live in a space about the size of a big double bed.  First the Angakok came out of his igloo, looking fatter than ever. The Angakok always found plenty to eat somehow. Both his wives were thin. Their faces looked like baked apples all brown and wrinkled.  When they reached Kesshoo's house, the Angakok went into the tunnel first.  Now I can't tell you whether he had grown fatter during the five days, or whether the entrance had grown smaller, but this much I know: the Angakok got stuck! He couldn't get himself into the room no matter how much he tried! He squirmed and wriggled and twisted, until his face was very red and he looked as if he would burst, but there he stayed.  Other people had crawled into the tunnel after him. His two wives were just behind. Everybody got stuck, of course, because no one could move until the Angakok did. He was just like a cork in the neck of a bottle.  Kesshoo and Koolee and the twins and Nip and Tup were all in the igloo. When they saw the Angakok's face come through the hole they thought, of course, the rest of him would come too. But it didn't, and the Angakok was mad about it.  \"Why don't they build igloos the way they used to?\" he growled. \"Every year the tunnels get smaller and smaller! Am I to remain here forever?\" he went on. \"Why doesn't somebody help me?\"  Kesshoo and Koolee seized him under his arms. They pulled and pulled. The two wives pushed him from behind.  \"I-yi! I-yi!\" screamed the Angakok. \"You will scrape my skin off!\"  He kicked out behind with his feet. His wives backed hastily, to get out of the way. That made them bump into Koko's mother who was just behind them. Her baby was in her hood, and when she backed, the baby's head was bumped on the roof of the tunnel.  The baby began to roar. In the tunnel it sounded like a clap of thunder. The wives of the Angakok and Koko's mother all began to talk at once, and with that and the baby's crying I suppose there never was a tunnel that held so much noise. It all came into the igloo, and it sounded quite frightful. The twins crept into the farthest corner of the sleeping bench and watched their father and mother and the Angakok, with their eyes almost popping out of their heads.  Nip and Tup thought they would help a little, so they jumped off the bench; and barked at the Angakok. You see, they didn't know he was a great medicine man. They thought maybe he ought not to be there at all.  Nip even snapped at the Angakok's ear!  That made the Angakok more angry than ever. He reached into the room, seized Nip with one hand and flung him up on to the sleeping bench. Nip lit on top of Menie. Nip was very much surprised, and so was Menie.  Now, whether the jerk he gave in throwing Nip did it or not, I cannot say, but at that instant Kesshoo and Koolee both gave a great pull in front. At the same moment the two wives gave a great push behind, and the next moment after that, there was the Angakok, still red, and still angry, sitting on the edge of the sleeping bench in the best place near the fire!  Then his two wives came crawling through. The Angakok looked at them as if he thought they had made him stick in the tunnel, and had done it on purpose, too. The wives scuttled up on to the sleeping bench, and got into the farthest corner of it as fast as they could.  The women and children always sat back on the bench at a feast.  When Koko's mother came in, the baby was still crying. She climbed up on to the bed with him, and Menie and Monnie showed him the pups and that made the baby laugh again.  As fast as they came in, the women and children packed themselves away on the sleeping bench. The men sat along the edge of it with their feet on the floor.   II.  The smell of food soon made everybody cheerful. When at last they were all crowded into the room, Koolee placed the bear's head and other pans of meat on the floor.  Then she crawled back on to the bench with the other women.  The Angakok was the first one to help himself. He reached down and took a large chunk of meat. He held it up to his mouth and took hold of the end with his teeth. Then he sawed off a huge mouthful with his knife.  It looked as if he would surely cut off the end of his nose too, but he didn't.  When the men had all helped themselves, pieces of meat were handed out to the women and children.  Soon they were all eating as if their lives depended on it. And now I think of it, their lives did depend on it, to be sure! I will not speak about their table manners. In fact, they hadn't any to speak of! They had nothing to eat with the meat--not even salt--but it was a great feast to them for all that, and they ate and ate until every scrap was gone.  The Angakok grew better natured every minute. By the time he had eaten all he could hold he was really quite happy and benevolent! He clasped his hands over his stomach and smiled on everybody.  The women chattered in their corner of the sleeping-bench, and Koolee showed Koko's mother the new fur suit trimmed with white rabbit's skin that she was making for Menie. And Koko's mother said she really must make one for Koko just like it.  The twins and Koko talked about a trap to catch hares which they meant to made as soon as the long days began again, and the baby went to sleep on a pile of furs in the corner. Menie fed the pups with some of his own meat, and gave them each a bone. Nip and Tup buried their bones under the baby and then went to sleep too.   III.  After a while the Angakok turned his face to the wall, as he always did when he meant to tell a story or sing a song. Then he said, \"Listen, my children!\" He called everybody--even the grown up people--his children! Everybody listened. They always listened when the Angakok spoke.  The Angakok knew the secrets of the sun, moon, and stars. He had told them so many times! The people believed it, and it may be that the Angakok really believed it himself, though I have some doubt about that.  \"Listen, my children,\" said the Angakok, \"and I will tell you wonderful things.  \"There is a world beneath the sea! You catch glimpses of that world yourselves in calm summer weather, when the water is still, and you know that I speak the truth!  \"Then you can see the shadows of rocks and islands and glaciers in the smooth water. Far below you see blue sky and white clouds. That is the calm world in which the Spirits of the Dead live. I have visited that underworld, many times, I have talked there with the spirits of your ancestors.\"  The Angakok paused and looked around to see if every one was paying attention. Then he went on with his story.  \"Do you remember how two springs ago there were so few walruses and seals along the coast that you nearly died for lack of food and oil?\" he said. \"My children, it was I who brought the seals and walruses back to you! Without my efforts you might all have starved!  \"I will tell you of the perils of a fearful journey which I undertook for your sakes. Then you will see what you owe to the skill and faithfulness of your Angakok!\"  All the people looked very solemn, and nodded their heads. The Angakok went on.  \"You must know that in the depths of the underworld, far beyond the beautiful abode of the Spirits of the Dead, lives the Old Woman of the Sea!  \"There she sits forever and forever beside a monstrous lamp. Underneath the lamp is a great saucer to catch the oil which drips from it.  \"In that saucer there are whole flocks of sea-birds swimming about! All the animals that live in the sea--the whales and walruses, the codfish and the seals--swarm in the saucer of the Old Woman of the Sea. That is where they all come from. Sometimes the Old Woman of the Sea keeps all the creatures in the saucer. Then there are no seal or fish or walrus along our coasts, and there is hunger among the innuit (human beings).  \"At the time of my journey she had kept all the creatures for so long a time in her saucer that you and many others were nearly dead for lack of food.\"  \"It was then that I prepared myself for the perils of this journey to the underworld. I called my Tornak, or guiding spirit, to lead my steps. Without his Tornak an Angakok can do nothing. The Tornak came at once in answer to my call. He took me by the hand,"]]]
