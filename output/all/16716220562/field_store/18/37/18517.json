Short-haired tortoiseshell and tortoise-and-white.  FIVE.  Anomalous, as Manx, etc.  The first class would include Persian, Angora, and other long-haired cats--black, white, tabby, or tortoiseshell.  The third class would include all tabbies--brown, red, and grey or silver.  Class Four must have tortoiseshell-and-white as well as tortoiseshell, or it will be a small class, owing to the rarity of the pure tortoiseshell.  The last class will give a place to Manx, six-toed cats, wild cats, and hybrids, as well as any curious foreign pussy that may be forthcoming.  At all shows you find a great many cats entered in the wrong class.  I think it a pity that secretaries don't arrange these in their proper classes; it is not right to exclude merit through mistake.  In judging, prizes should be withheld where there is no competition; and where there is want of merit in any one class, some of the prizes should be withdrawn and added to any class of _extra_ merit.  We come now to the _black-and-white cat_.  A good black-and-white cat is a very noble-looking animal.  If well-trained and looked after, you can hardly have a nicer parlour pet. He is affectionate in his disposition, and cleanly and gentlemanly, so to speak, and makes himself quite an ornament to a well-furnished drawing-room.  I must speak, however, of the demerits of my pets, as well as of their good qualities, and feel constrained to say that I have sometimes found black-and-white Tom a pussy who did not trouble himself too much about his duties as house-cat; he much preferred the parlour to the kitchen, a good bed to a hay-loft, and seemed to think that catching mean little mice was far below his dignity.  If well treated black and white cats are apt to turn a little indolent and lazy, and if improperly fed and housed, they degenerate into the most wretched-looking specimens of felinity you ever looked upon.  All the bad in their character comes out, and their good qualities are forgotten.  Their coat gets dry, and tear, and are cinder-holed; and, instead of the plump, round-faced, clerical-looking cat which used to adorn your parlour window, you have a thin, emaciated, long-nosed, pigeon-loft-hunting, flower-unscraping, dirty, disreputable dunghill cat.  Of course, the same may, to a certain extent, be said of most neglected cats, but the two breeds that show to the least advantage, when ill-used, are the black-and-white and the red-and-white, and more especially the former.  _Merits_.--I like these cats more for their appearance than anything else.  When nicely marked they look reverend and respectable in the extreme.  I consider them but very ordinary pussies in regard to house-hunting.  A naval officer who cannot go to quarters without having his hands encased in white kids, and a black-and-white cat, carry on duty much on a par.  Neither do these cats make over good children's pets, being at times a little selfish.  They are beautiful creatures, nevertheless, and well worthy of a place at our parlour firesides.  _Points_.--1.  _Size_: As big as possible, but not leggy; reasonably plump for the show-bench, but _very_ graceful in all their motions; with stoutish short forelegs, and plenty of spring in the hindquarters.  2.  _Head_: The best black-and-white Toms have large, well-rounded heads, with moderately long ears, and a well-pleased, self-contented expression of face.  The whiskers are usually white, but black is not objectionable.  The eyes are preferred green, and sparkling like emeralds of the finest water.  3.  _Colour and markings_: The colour is black-and-white, with as much of the former, and as little of the latter as you can find.  I like to see the nose and cheeks vandyked with white, the chin black, white fore-paws, white hind legs and belly, and a white chest.  This is all that is needed for beauty's sake; but, at all events, the markings must be even.  4.  _Pelage_: Fur should be longish (and I don't object to its being ticked all over the back with longer white hairs), silky, and glossy.  Points of the Black-and-White Cat.  Size, 10.  Head, 5.  Colour and markings, 25.  Pelage, 10.  Total, 50.  The next cat on the boards is the white cat.  It is very remarkable--and most students of feline nature must have had an opportunity of observing this--the great difference in the temperament, constitution, and nature of cats, which colour alone, apparently, has the power of truly indicating; and this is nowhere more easily seen than in the peculiar characteristics of the pure black pussy and the all-white one.  The black cat, on the one hand, is bold, and free, and fierce; the white, far from brave, more fond of petting and society, and as gentle as a little white mouse.  The black cat is full of life and daring; the white of a much quieter and more loving disposition.  The black cat stands but little \"cuddling;\" the white would like to be always nursed.  It takes but little pains to teach a black cat to be perfectly cleanly, but much more to train a pure white one.  In constitution the black cat is much more hardy and lasting, the white cat being often delicate, and longing apparently for a sunnier clime.  A black cat is often afflicted with _kleptomania_, while a properly-educated white puss is as honest as the day is long.  The senses of the black cat are nearly always in a state of perfection, while the white is often deaf, and at times a little blind.  Again there is nothing demoniacal about a white cat, as there often is about a black one.  I remember, when a little boy at the grammar school of Aberdeen, receiving a box from the country containing lots of good things, and marked, \"A Present from Muffle\"--Muffle was a pet tabby of mine--and, childlike, replying in verse, the last lines of the \"poem\" being--    \"And when at last Death's withering arms       Shall throw his mantle thee around,   May angel catties carry thee       To the happy hunting-ground.\"  Well, a blue-eyed white pussy was my idea of an \"angel cattie\" then, and it is not altered still.  It will be observed, however, that the colour of the kittens of the same litter will often differ, and the question naturally comes to be asked, Do I assert that the nature and temperament of cats in the same litter will not coincide?  I do so aver most unhesitatingly; and the thing is easily explained if you bear in mind that a litter of differently-coloured kittens has had but _one_ mother, but _many_ fathers.  Although born from the same mother in one day, they stand in the relation to each other of half-brothers and half-sisters.  Except when the odds in colour is very distinct, as in black, white, or red, the difference in constitution, etc, will not be so easily perceived, but it is there, nevertheless.  _Colour follows the breed, and temper and quality follow colour_.  This is the same all throughout nature, and is often observed, though but little studied, by dog fanciers.  I have only to remind pointer and setter men, how often hardiness and good stamp cling to certain colours.  That \"God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,\" I believe to be merely metaphor, but I am ready to go to death on it that He paints the petals of the flower and the blossoms on the fruit-tree, to the requirements of the tender seedlings.  What sort of fruit would you grow in the dark, or under deeply-coloured glass shades? Lest I be found guilty of digression, I shall say no more now on this subject.  _Merits of the White Cat_.--A _pet_, gentle and loving above a cat of any other colour, though at times dull, and cross, and wayward; \"given,\" as a lady said, \"to moods of melancholy.\"  Not a bad mouser either, when \"i' th' vein,\" and a good cat for a miller to have, not being easily seen among sacks of flour.  _Points_.--1.  _Size_: Seldom a large cat. 2.  _Head_: Smallish, and as nicely rounded as possible; ears not too long, and well-feathered internally; eyes of \"himmel-blue;\" eyes ought to be both the same colour--if not so, deduct five points. 3.  _Pelage_: Fine, soft, and glossy; but a too long coat shows a cross with Angora. 4.  _Colour_: White as driven snow, if intended for a show cat; if not, a very little black wonderfully improves the constitution.

The Blue cat: just one word about this pretty creature before passing on to the Tabbies.  Although she is called a blue cat, don't fancy for a moment that ultramarine is anywhere near her colour, or himmel-blue, or honest navy serge itself.  Her colour is a sad slate-colour; I cannot get any nearer to it than that.  Apart from her somewhat sombre appearance, this cat makes a very nice pet indeed; she is exceedingly gentle and winning, and I'm sure would do anything rather than scratch a child.  But the less children have to do with her the better, for all that: for this simple reason--she is a cat of delicate constitution--all that ever I knew were so, at least, and I daresay my readers can corroborate what I say.  _Merits_.--Their extreme gentleness is one merit, and their tractability and teachability are others.  A pure blue cat is very rare, and they are greatly prized by their owners.  _Points_.--1.  _Size_: They are rather under-sized, never being much larger than the pure tortoiseshell.  2.  _Head_: The head is small and round, and the eyes are prettiest when of a beautiful orange-yellow.  The nose should be tipped with black.  3.  _Pelage_: Moderately long and delightfully soft and sheeny.  4.  _Colour_: This is the principal point.  It is, as I said, a nice cool, slate-grey, and, like the black cat, our blue pussy must be all one colour, without a hair of white anywhere.  _Even her whiskers_ must be of the same colour as her fur.

We now come to the Tabbies--the real old English cats--the playmates of our infant days and sharers of our oatmeal porridge.  They are the commonest of all cats, and justly so, too, for there is hardly anything they don't know, and nothing they can't be taught, bar conic sections, perhaps, the _Pons Asinorum_, and a few trifles of that ilk.  You will find a tabby cat wherever you go, and you will find her equally at home wherever she is--whether sitting on the footstool on the cosy hearthrug, singing duets with the tea-kettle; catching birds and rabbits in the woods, or mice in the barn; conducting a concert for your especial benefit on the neighbouring tiles at twelve o'clock at night; examining the flower seeds you lately sowed in the garden to see if they are budding yet; or locked, quite by accident, into the pigeon loft.  The first cat of the Tabby kind which claims our attention is the Red or Sandy Tabby.  This is a very beautiful animal, and quite worthy of a place in the best drawing-rooms in the land.  Although they do not grow to the immense size of some of our brown tabbies, still they are better hunters, much fiercer, and of a hardier constitution.  They much prefer out-of-door sport, and will attack and slay even the polecat and weasel; and instances have been known of their giving battle to the wild cat himself.  _Merits_.--They are the prettiest of pets, and the honestest of all cat kind.  They are such good ratters that neither mice nor rats will frequent the house they inhabit.  _Points_.--1.  _Size_: They ought to be as large as possible, and not clumsy; they are generally neater cats all over than the Brown Tabbies.  2.  _Head_: The head should be large and broad, with rather shortish ears, well placed, and the face ought to beam with intelligence and good nature.  The eyes should be deep set, and a nice yellow colour.  3.  _Pelage_: The coat is generally short in nearly all the Tabbies, but ought to be sleek and glossy.  4.  _Colour and markings_: The colour is a light sandy red, barred and striped with red of a darker, deeper hue.  No white.  The stripes or markings ought to be the same on both sides, and even the legs ought to be marked with cross bars, and one beautiful swirl, at least, across the chest.  This is called the Lord Mayor's Chain, and when the cat has two, give him extra points.  Points of the Red Tabby.  Size, 10.  Head, 5.  Colour and markings, 30.  Pelage, 5.  Total, 50.  Next comes the Brown Tabby.  This is the largest of all breeds of cats, fourteen, seventeen, and even twenty pounds a common weight.  They are also, when well marked and striped, exceedingly beautiful.  Of all cats they are the best adapted for house-hunting, being less addicted to wandering than some breeds.  _Merits_.--Their hunting proclivities.  Their fondness for children is sometimes quite remarkable.  I have known many instances of Brown Tom Tabbies, so fierce that scarce any one dare lay a finger on them unscathed, but a little child of four years of age could do anything with them, lug them about anyhow, and even carry them head down, over its shoulder by the tail.  They are, moreover, nice, loving, kind-hearted pets, and exceedingly fond of their master and mistress. They are the cats of all cats to make a family circle look cosy and complete around the fire of a winter's night.  _Points_.--1.  _Size_: It will be observed below that I give fifteen points for size.  The bigger your Brown Tom Tabby is the better he looks, _if_ the one-half of it isn't fat, for if so he won't be graceful, and that is one essential point.  I can find a Tabby at this moment who weighs over twenty pounds, and who will spring from the floor, without scrambling, mind you, clean on to the top of the parlour door, and that is little short of seven feet.  I like to see a tabby with a graceful carriage then, and shortish in forelegs, with beautifully well-fitted and rounded limbs, and with a tiger-like walk and mien.  2.  _Head_: Very large and broad and round, ears short, eyes dark, and muzzle broad, not lean, and thin and long.  This latter certainly gives him more killing power, but it brings him too near the wild cat.  I don't care how savagely he behaves in a cage at a show, for well I know he is quite a different animal at his own fireside, asleep on the rug in little Alice's arms, or purring in bed on old Maid Mudge's virgin bosom.  3.  _Colour_: A nice dark brown or grey ground, and the workings as deeply black as possible.  No white.  4.  _Markings_: Like a Bengal tiger, and even prettier.  The tail and legs likewise barred.  The head striped perpendicularly down the brow, and the marks going swirling round the cheeks.  Nose black or brown, and the eyes as dark as possible, and full of fire.  5.  _Pelage_: Short and glossy.  Points of the Brown Tabby.  Size, 15.  Head, 5.  Colour, 10.  Markings, 15.  Pelage, 5.  Total, 50.  Lastly, we have the Silver Tabby and the Spotted Tabby, and in almost all points these may be judged alike.  The Silver Tabby is a sweetly pretty cat.  Perhaps the prettiest of all pussies.  They are a size smaller than even the best Red Tabbies, and are infinitely more graceful, and quicker in all their motions.  They are proud, elegant, aristocratic cats, fond to love and quick to resent an injury.  _Merits_.--Their special merit is their exceeding beauty.  They are somewhat rare, however.  Here is a bit of advice to any one who would like to have four really pretty cats about the house, each to show the others to advantage.  Get a pure white kitten, a pure black one, a red tabby, and a silver ditto.  Take great care in the training of them, be careful in feeding and housing them, and you will have your reward.  The Spotted Tabby is also very pretty.  He ought to be a good, sizeable animal, with broad head, short ears, and a loving face; ground colour a dark grey, one dark stripe, and down the spine, and diverging from this stripes of black broken up into spots.  _Points_.--The Silver Tabby ought to be--  1.  _In size_, less than or about the size of the Red Tabby, and very quick and graceful.  2.  _Head_: Large and shapely, but not so blunt as the Brown Tabby's; ears short and eyes light.  3.  _Colour and markings_: Of a deep Aberdeen granite, grey in the ground-work, and the markings very dark and beautifully arranged.  Don't forget the Mayor's Chains.  4.  _Pelage_: Longish, if anything; but not so long as to make the judge suspect crossing with the Persian.  Points of Silver and Spotted Tabbies.  Size, 10.  Head, 5.  Colour and markings, 30.  Pelage, 5.  Total, 50.  There are one or two fancy cats I have not mentioned, as the Red-and-white, etc; but I believe I have said enough to make anyone, with a little study and attention, a good judge of the points and qualities of the different breeds of the English domestic cat.  CHAPTER SEVEN.  ASIATIC CATS.  When I was a little boy at school, floundering through Herodotus, and getting double doses of fum-fum daily for my Anabasis--for my old teacher, when he couldn't get enough Greek into one end of me, took jolly good care to put it in at the other--there was no man I had greater respect for than Alexander the Great, owing to his having done that Gordian knot business so neatly.  I practised afterwards on the dominie's tawse (i.e., the fum-fum strap); I tied a splendid knot on it, and then cut it through with a jack-knife; but, woe's me! the plaguy dominie caught me in the very act, and--and I had to take my meals standing for a week.  But ever since then I have always been a don at knots; and I give myself no small credit, whether you do or not, reader, for the dexterous manner in which I have polished off the cat-classification knot.  There it lay before me, interminable, intricate, incensing; and bother the end could I see to it at all at all.  \"Draw the sword of Scotland.\"  Swish!  There it lies, the short-haired European pussies on the one hand, and the Asiatic or long-haired on the other.  Among these latter you will find exactly the same colours, and the same variety of markings, as among the European cats proper.  We give their points in a general way.  1.  _Size_: The blue cats and the pure white are usually of the smallest dimensions; next comes the black, and lastly the tabbies.  Some of these latter grow to immense sizes, and are animals of a beauty which is at times magnificent.  The cat that belonged to Troppman, the distinguished French murderer, and now, or lately, possessed by Mr Hincks, of Birmingham, is worth going a day's journey to behold.  Yet, although very large, they are very graceful, too, and can spring enormous distances.  Fierce enough, too, they can be when there is any occasion, especially to strangers or dogs.  2.  _Head_: The heads of the white, blue, and black ought to be small, round, and sweet, the expression of the countenance being singularly kind and loving.  The heads of the tabbies ought to be broad and large, and not snouty.  The whiskers of both ought to be very long, and of a colour to match the general tone.  The ears have this peculiarity--they are slightly bent downwards and forwards, which gives rather a pensive character to their beauty.  They are, moreover, graced by the _aural tuft_.  The eyes must also match; and this is what I like to see--a blue eye in a white Persian, a hazel in a black, and a lovely sea-green in a tabby.  3.  The _Pelage_: The pelage is long (the longer the better), especially around the neck and a-down the sides; and a good brush, gracefully swirled and carried, is an essential point of beauty.  The fur ought to be as silken as possible; this shows that the cat is not only well-bred, but well-fed and taken care of.  4.  _Markings_: They ought to be as distinct as possible, as pretty as possible, and evenly laid on with reference to the two sides.  5.  _Colour_: All white in the pure white, all black in the black, and so on with the other distinct colours; and"]]]
