The next division is the name in common for all daughters, or all sons of one family of sisters. The daughters take the name from their maternal grandmother, the sons from their maternal great-uncle.  Of these divisions, called I Matrimonial Classes, there are four for each sex, bearing the same names as among the Kamilaroi. The names are--    Masculine Kumbo     BROTHER AND SISTER   Feminine, Bootha    Masculine Murree    BROTHER AND SISTER   Feminine, Matha    Masculine Hippi     BROTHER AND SISTER   Feminine, Hippitha    Masculine Kubbee    BROTHER AND SISTER   Feminine, Kubbootha   The children of Bootha will be    Masculine Hippi     BROTHER AND SISTER   Feminine, Hippitha   The children of Matha will be    Masculine Kubbee    BROTHER AND SISTER   Feminine, Kubbootha   The children of Hippatha will be    Masculine Kumbo     BROTHER AND SISTER   Feminine, Bootha   The children of Kubbootha will be    Masculine Murree    BROTHER AND SISTER   Feminine, Matha   Thus, you see, they take, if girls, their grandmother's and her sisters' 'class' names in common; if boys, the 'class' name of their grandmother's brothers.  Bootha    can only marry Murree,  Matha     can only marry Kumbo,  Hippitha  can only marry Kubbee,  Kubbootha can only marry Hippi.   Both men and women are often addressed by these names when spoken to.  A PROPOS of names, a child is never called at night by the same name as in the daytime, lest the 'devils' hear it and entice him away.  Names are made for the newly born according to circumstances; a girl born under a Dheal tree, for example, was called Dheala. Any incident happening at the time of birth may gain a child a name, such as a particular lizard passing. Two of my black maids were called after lizards in that way: Barahgurree and Bogginbinnia.  Nimmaylee is a porcupine with the spines coming; such an one having been brought to the camp just as a girl was born, she became Nimmaylee.  The mothers, with native politeness, ask you to give their children English names, but much mote often use in familiar conversation either the Kumbo Bootha names, or others derived from place of birth, from some circumstance connected with it, a child's mispronunciation of a word, some peculiarity noticed in the child, or still more often they call each other by the name proclaiming the degree of relationship.  For example, a girl calls the daughters of her mother and of her aunts alike sisters.    Boahdee       SISTER   Wambaneah     FULL BROTHER   Dayadee       HALF BROTHER   Gurrooghee    UNCLE   Wulgundee     UNCLE'S WIFE   Kummean       SISTER'S SISTER   Numbardee     MOTHER   Numbardee     MOTHER'S SISTER   Beealahdee    FATHER   Beealahdee    MOTHER'S SISTERS' HUSBANDS   Gnahgnahdee   GRANDMOTHER ON FATHER'S SIDE   Bargie        GRANDMOTHER ON MOTHER'S SIDE   Dadadee       GRANDFATHER ON MOTHER'S SIAE   Gurroomi      A SON-IN-LAW, OR ONE WHO COULD BE A SON-IN-LAW   Goonooahdee   A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW, OR ONE WHO COULD BE A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW   Gooleerh      HUSBAND OR WIFE, OR ONE WHO MIGHT BE SO.   So relationships are always kept in their memories by being daily used as names. There are other general names, too, such as--    Mullayerh     A TEMPORARY MATE OR COMPANION   Moothie       A FRIEND OF CHILDHOOD IN AFTER LIFE   Doore-oothai  A LOVER   Dillahga      AN ELDERLY MAN OF THE SAME TOTEM   Tuckandee     A YOUNG MAN OF THE SAME TOTEM, RECKONED AS A SORT OF                   BROTHER.   Another list of names used ordinarily is--    Boothan       LAST POSSIBLE CHILD OF A WOMAN   Mahmee        OLD WOMAN   Beewun        MOTHERLESS GIRL   Gowun         FATHERLESS GIRL   Yumbui        FATHERLESS BOY   Moogul        ONLY CHILD.   Those of the same totem are reckoned as brothers and sisters, so cannot intermarry. 'Boyjerh' relations, as those on the father's side are called, are not so important as on the mother's side, but are still recognised.  Now for the great Dhe, or totem system, by some called Mah, but Dhe, is the more correct.  Dinewan, or emu, is a totem, and has amongst its multiplex totems' or 'sub-totems'--    Goodoo        OR CODFISH   Gumbarl       SILVER BREAM   Inga          CRAYFISH   Boomool       SHRIMPS   Gowargay      WATER EMU SPIRIT   Moograbah     BIG BLACK-AND-WHITE MAGPIE   Booloorl      LITTLE NIGHT OWL   Byahmul       BLACK SWAN   Eerin         A LITTLE NIGHT OWL   Beerwon       A BIRD LIKE A SWALLOW   Dulloorah     THE MANNA-BRINGING BIRDS   Bunnyal       FLIES   Dheal         SACRED FIRE   Gidya         AN ACACIA   Yaraan        AN EUCALYPTUS   Deenyi        IRONBARK   Guatha        QUANDONG   Goodooroo     RIVER BOX   Mirieh        POLIGONUM   Yarragerh     THE NORTH-EAST WIND   Guie          TREE--OWENIA ACIDULA   Niune         WILD MELON   Binnamayah    BIG SALTBUSH.   Bohrah, the kangaroo, is another totem, and is considered somewhat akin to Dinewan. For example, in a quarrel between, say, the Bohrah totem and the Beewee, the Dinewan would take the part of the former rather than the latter.  Amongst the multiplex totems of Bohrah are--    Goolahwilleel    TOPKNOT PIGEONS   Boogoodoogadah   THE RAIN-BIRD   Gilah            FINK-BREASTED PARROT   Quarrian         YELLOW AND RED BREASTED GREY PARROT   Buln Buln        GREEN PARROT   Gidgerregah      SMALL GREEN PARROT   Cocklerina       A ROSE AND YELLOW CRESTED WHILE COCKATOO   Youayah          FROGS   Guiggahboorool   BIGGEST ANT-BEDS   Dunnia           WATTLE TREE   Mulga            AN ACACIA   Gnoel            SANDALWOOD   Brigalow         AN ACACIA   Yarragerh        NORTH-EAST WIND, SAME AS DINEWAN'S.   All clouds, lightning, thunder, and rain that is not blown up by the wind of another totem, belong to Bohrah.  Beewee, brown and yellow Iguana, numerically a very powerful totem, has for multiplex totems--    Gai-gai           CATFISH   Curreequinquin    BUTCHER-BIRD   Gougourgahgah     LAUGHING-JACKASS   Deenbi            DIVERS   Birroo Birroo     SAND BUILDERS   Deegeenboyah      SOLDIER-BIRD   Weedah            BOWER-BIRD   Mooregoo Mooregoo BLACK IBIS   Booloon           WHITE CRANE   Noodulnoodul      WHISTLING DUCKS   Goborrai          STARS   Gulghureer        PINK LIZARD   Goori             PINE   Talingerh         NATIVE FUCHSIA   Guiebet           NATIVE PASSION FRUIT   Boonburr          POISON TREE   Gungooday         STOCKMAN'S WOOD   Guddeeboondoo     BITTER BARK   Boorgoolbean or   Mooloowerh        A SHRUB WITH CREAMY BLOSSOMS   Yarragerh         SPRING WIND   Muddernwurderh    WEST WIND.   Those with whom the Beewee shares the winds he counts as relations. It is the Beewees of the Gwaimudthen, or dark blood, who own Yarragerh (spring wind); the light-blooded own Mudderwurderh (west wind).  Another totem is Gouyou, or Bandicoot. The animal has disappeared from the Narran district, but the totem tribe is still strong, though not so numerous as either the Beewees or Dinewans.

Amongst other totems were once the Bralgah, Native Companion, and Dibbee, a sort of sandpiper, but their kins are quite extinct as far as our blacks are concerned; the birds themselves are still plentiful. The Bralgah birds have a Boorah ground at the back of our old horse-paddock, a smooth, well-beaten circle, where they dance the grotesque dances peculiar to them, which are really most amusing to watch, somewhat like a set of kitchen lancers into which some dignified dames have got by mistake, and a curious mixture is the dance of dignity and romping.  The totem kins numerically strongest with us were the Dinewans, Beewees, Bohrahs, and Gouyous. Further back in the country, they tell me, the crow, the eaglehawk, and the bees were original totems, not multiplex ones, as with us.  It may be as well for those interested in the marriage law puzzles to state that Dinewans, Bohrahs, Douyous, and Doolungayers are always    Kumbo             Hippi   Bootha            Hippitha.   That Moodai, Gouyou, Beewee, Maira, Yubbah are always    Murree            Kubbee   Matha             Kubbootha.  Our blacks may and do eat their hereditary totems, if so desirous, with no ill effects to themselves, either real or imaginary; their totem names they take from their mothers. They may, in fact, in any way use their totems, but never abuse them. A Beewee, for example, may kill, or see another kill, and eat or use a Beewee, or one of its multiplex totems, and show no sign of sorrow or anger, but should any one speak evil of the Beewee, or of any of its multiplex totems, there will be a quarrel.  There will likewise be a quarrel if any one dares to mimic a totem, either by drawing one, except at Boorahs, or imitating it in any way.  There are members of the tribes, principally wizards, or men intended to be such, who are given an individual totem called Yunbeai. This they must never eat or they will die. Any injury to his yunbeai hurts the man himself In danger he has the power to assume the shape of his yunbeai, which of course is a great assistance to him, especially in legendary lore; but, on the other hand, a yunbeai is almost a Heel of Achilles to a wirreenun (see the chapter on Medicine and Magic).  Women are given a yunbeai too, sometimes. One girl had a yunbeai given her as a child, and she was to be brought up as a witch, but she caught rheumatic fever which left her with St. Vitus's dance. The yunbeai during one of her bad attacks jumped out of her, and she lost her chance of witchery. One old fellow told me once that when he was going to a public-house he took a miniature form of his yunbeai, which was the Kurrea--crocodile--out of himself and put it safety in a bottle of water, in case by any chance he got drunk, and an enemy, knowing his yunbeai, coaxed it away. I wanted to see that yunbeai in a bottle, but never succeeded.  The differences between the hereditary totem or Dhe, inherited from the mother, and the individual totem or yunbeai, acquired by chance, are these: Food restrictions do not affect the totem, but marriage restrictions do; the yunbeai has no marriage restrictions; a man having an opossum for yunbeai may marry a woman having the same either as her yunbeai or hereditary totem, other things being in order, but under no circumstances must a yunbeai be eaten by its possessor.  The yunbeai is a sort of alter ego; a man's spirit is in his yunbeai, and his yunbeai's spirit in him.  A Minggah, or spirit-haunted tree of an individual, usually chosen from amongst a man's multiplex totems, is another source of danger to him, as also a help.  As Mr. Canton says: 'What singular threads of superstition bind the ends of the earth together! In an old German story a pair of lovers about to part chose each a tree, and by the tree of the absent one was the one left to know of his wellbeing or the reverse. In time his tree died, and she, hearing no news of him, pined away, her tree withering with her, and both dying at the same time.  Well, that is just what a wirreenun would believe about his Minggah. These Minggah and Goomarh spirit trees and stones always make me think, perhaps irrelevantly, of one of the restored sayings of the Lord, which ends 'Raise the stone, and there thou shalt find Me; cleave the wood, and I am there.'  Blacks were early scientists in some of their ideas, being before Darwin with the evolution theory, only theirs was a kind of evolution aided by Byamee. I dare say, though, the missing link is somewhere in the legends. I rather think the Central Australians have the key to it. One old man here was quite an Ibsen with his ghastly version of heredity.  He said, when I asked him what harm it would do for, say, a Beewee totem man to come from the Gulf country, where his tribe had never had any communication with ours, and marry a girl here,--that all Beewees were originally changed from the Beewee form into human shape. The Beewee of the Gulf, originally, like the Beewee here, had the same animal shape, and should two of this same blood mate the offspring would throw back, as they say of horses, to the original strain, and partake of iguana (Beewee) attributes either in nature or form.  From the statements just given, it will be seen that the Euahlayi are in the Kamilaroi stage of social organisation. They reckon descent in the female line: they have 'phratries' and four matrimonial classes, with totems within the phratries. In their system of 'multiplex-totems' or 'sub-totems' they resemble the Wotjobaluk tribe. [Howitt, NATIVE TRIBES OF SOUTH-EAST AUSTRALIA, pp. 121, 125, 453, 455.] The essence of the 'sub-totem' system is the division of all things into the categories provided by the social system of the human society. The arrangement is a very early attempt at a scientific system of classification.  Perhaps the most peculiar feature in the organisation of the Euahlayi is the existence of Matrimonial Classes, which are named as in the Kamilaroi tongue, while the phratry names are not those of the Kamilaroi, and alone among phratry names in Australia which can be translated, are not names of animals. The phratries have thus no presiding animals, and in the phratries there are no totem kins of the phratriac names. The cause of these peculiarities is matter of conjecture.  A peculiarity in the totemic system of the Euahlayi--the right of each individual to kill and eat his own totem--has been mentioned, and may be associated here with other taboos on food.  The wunnarl, or food taboo, was taken off a different kind of food for boys at each Boorah, until at last they could eat what they pleased except their yunbeai, or individual familiar: their Dhe, or family totem, was never wunnarl or taboo to them.  A child may not perhaps know that it has had a yunbeai given to it, and may eat of it in ignorance, when immediately they say that child sickens.  Should a boy or a girl eat plains turkey or bustard eggs while they were yet wunnarl, or taboo, he or she would lose his or her sight. Should they eat the eggs or flesh of kangaroo or piggiebillah, their skins would break out in sores and their limbs wither.  Even honey is wunnarl at times to all but the very old or very young. Fish is wunnarl for about four years after his Boorah to a boy, and about four months after she is wirreebeeun, or young woman, to a girl.  When the wunnarl was taken off a particular kind of meat, a wizard poured some of the melted fat and inside blood of that animal or bird, as the case might be, over the boy, and rubbed it into him. The boy, shaking and shivering, made a spluttering noise with his lips; after that he could eat of the hitherto forbidden food.  This did not necessarily refer to his totem, but any food wunnarl to him, though it is possible that there may have been a time in tribal history, now forgotten, when totems were wunnarl, and these ceremonies may be all that is left to point to that time.  When a boy, after his first Boorah, killed his first emu, whether it was his Dhe, or totem, or not, his father made him lie on the bird before it was cooked. Afterwards a wirreenun (wizard) and the father rubbed the fat on the boy's joints, and put apiece of the flesh in his mouth. 'The boy chewed it, making a noise as he did so of fright and disgust; finally he dropped the meat from his mouth, making a blowing noise through his lips of 'Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!' After that he could eat the flesh.  A girl, too, had to be rubbed with the fat and blood of anything from which the wunnarl was to be removed for her. No ceremony of this sort would be gone through with the flesh, fat, or blood of any one's yunbeai, or individual familiar animal, for under no circumstances would any one kill or eat their yunbeai.  Concerning the yunbeai, or animal familiar of the individual, conferred by the medicine men, more is to be said in the ensuing chapters. The yunbeai answers to the Manitu obtained by Red Indians during the fast at puberty; to the 'Bush Soul' of West Africa; to the"]]]
