The four specimens from the Río San Román were obtained from edges of deep pools in clear water. In adult males the top of the head was reddish orange in life. One of the specimens from the Río San Román currently is living in the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens. The local name for this turtle is _tortuga blanca_; it is sought for its meat.   =Geoemyda areolata= (Duméril and Bibron)        Chinajá, 2.  Two specimens were obtained from dense forest at Chinajá. The local name is _mojina_.   =Pseudemys scripta ornata= (Gray)        Paso Subín, 1.  One subadult was obtained from clear water in the Río Subín. The stripes on the head and neck were yellow; there was no red \"ear\" on the side of the head. The stripes on the forelimbs were orange, and the ocelli on the carapace were red. The local name is _jicotea_.   =Coleonyx elegans elegans= Gray        Toocog, 1.  One adult male having a snout-vent length of 89 mm. was found beneath a log in the forest. Locally this gecko is known as _escorpión_; the natives believe it to be deadly poisonous. The use of the name _escorpión_ seems to be restricted to lizards thought to be venomous. Nearly everywhere in México and Central America some species of lizard carries this appellation. In El Petén I heard the name used only for _Coleonyx elegans_ and _Thecadactylus rapicaudus_; in the lowlands of Guerrero, México, the name is applied to geckos of the genus _Phyllodactylus_. The venomous lizards of the genus _Heloderma_ in the lowlands of western México are called _escorpiónes_. In the mountains of southern México various skinks of the genus _Eumeces_, as well as lizards of the genus _Xenosaurus_, carry the same appellation. _Abronia_ in the mountains of México and _Gerrhonontus_ throughout México and Central America likewise are called _escorpiónes_. Although many people in various parts of Middle America consider most lizards poisonous, there is a unanimity of opinion concerning the venomous qualities of the various kinds of _escorpiónes_. I know of only two other lizards in Middle America that are so uniformly regarded in native beliefs; these are _Enyaliosaurus clarki_ in the Tepalcatepec Valley in Michoacán, called _nopiche_, and _Phrynosoma asio_ in western México, called _cameleón_.   =Sphaerodactylus lineolatus= Lichtenstein        15 km. NW of Chinajá, 1; Toocog, 1.  These small geckos were much more abundant than the few specimens indicate. They frequently were seen on the trunks of corozo palms, where they quickly took refuge in crevices at the bases of the fronds. The specimen obtained at Toocog was under the bark of a standing dead tree. In life the ventral surface of the tail was orange. The individual from Chinajá was in the leaf litter on the ground at the base of a dead tree.   =Thecadactylus rapicaudus= (Houttuyn)        15 km. NW of Chinajá, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 2.  Two specimens were found beneath the bark of standing dead trees; another was found in the crack in the trunk of a mahogany tree about 13 meters above the ground. In life the dorsum was yellowish tan with dark brown markings; the venter was yellowish tan with brown flecks, and the iris was olive-tan. The largest specimen is a male having a snout-vent length of 95 mm.; all specimens have regenerated tails. Individuals when caught twisted their bodies and attempted to bite; upon grabbing a finger they held on with great tenacity.   =Anolis biporcatus= (Wiegmann)        14 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1; 17 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1; 20 km. NNW       of Chinajá, 3; 30 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1; Sayaxché, 1.  All specimens of this large anole were obtained from trees. Some individuals were found in the tops of trees immediately after they were felled. My limited observations on this anole suggest that it is an inhabitant of the upper levels of the forest. In life an adult male from 20 kilometers north-northwest of Chinajá was brilliant green above; the eyelids were bright yellow; the belly was white. The outer part of the dewlap was pale orange, and the median part was pinkish blue. A juvenile having a snout-vent length of 47 mm. and a tail length of 86 mm. was pale grayish green with pale gray flecks on the dorsum. The largest male has a snout-vent length of 98 mm. and a tail length of 217 mm.; the same measurements of the largest female are 89 and 213 mm. This species, together with all other anoles, is known locally as _toloque_.   =Anolis capito= Peters        Chinajá, 2; 14 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1; Río de la Pasión, 1.  All individuals were observed on trunks of trees between heights of three and ten meters above the ground. The largest male has a snout-vent length of 81 mm. and a tail length of 155 mm.; the same measurements of the largest female are 87 and 150 mm. The streaked brown dorsum, combined with the lizards' habit of pressing the body against the trunks of trees, make this anole especially difficult to see.   =Anolis humilis uniformis= Cope        Chinajá, 24; 15 km. NW of Chinajá, 22; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá,       6; Sayaxché, 1.  This small dull brown anole is a characteristic inhabitant of the forest floor, where the lizards move about in a series of quick, short hops and thus easily evade capture. Three individuals were found on small bushes, and four were on the bases of trees; otherwise, all were observed on the ground. Observations indicate that this species is active throughout the day, except during and immediately after heavy rains. The males have a deep red dewlap with a dark blue median spot.   =Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei= Bocourt        Chinajá, 11; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 4; 30 km. NNW of Chinajá,       2; Río de la Pasión, 1; Río San Román, 1; Sayaxché, 8; Toocog,       6.  This moderate-sized anole characteristically inhabits the low bushes and bases of trees in the forest. Individuals were most readily observed on the buttresses of some of the gigantic mahogany and ceiba trees. When approached the lizards usually ran around the tree or ducked to the other side of the buttress; if the observer moved closer, they jumped to the ground and ran off. None was observed to ascend large trees. Some individuals were observed foraging on the forest floor; these took shelter on the bases of trees. One individual was sleeping on a palm frond at night. The adult males have a uniformly orange-red dewlap.   =Anolis limifrons rodriguezi= Bocourt        15 km. NW of Chinajá, 2; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1.  In dry forests and more open situations than occur at Chinajá this little anole is abundant, but in the wet forests of southern El Petén, only three specimens were found. Two were on palm fronds about two meters above the ground; the other was on a low bush. I suspect that ecologically this species overlaps _A. humilis uniformis_ and _A. lemurinus bourgeaei_, but too few observations are recorded to justify a definite statement at this time.   =Anolis sericeus sericeus= Hallowell        Chinajá, 2; Sayaxché, 1; Toocog, 1.  This small anole is common and widespread in the Atlantic lowlands of southern México and northern Central America; usually it inhabits sub-humid regions. Consequently, its presence in the wet forests of southern El Petén was unexpected. The specimens from Chinajá were sleeping on low bushes at night, whereas the others were found on bushes by day.   =Basiliscus vittatus= Wiegmann        Chinajá, 6; Río de la Pasión, 1; Río San Román, 1; Sayaxché,       3; Toocog, 1.  Individuals of this abundant species were most frequently seen in dense bushes along the margins of rivers or small streams. None was observed far from water. These lizards, like the anoles, are known locally as _toloque_.   =Corythophanes cristatus= (Merrem)        Chinajá, 3; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1.  Three individuals were found on tree trunks; the fourth was on a thick vine about one meter above the ground. The two largest males have snout-vent lengths of 121 and 115 mm. and tail lengths of 265 and 243 mm. The largest female (KU 59603), obtained on June 28, has a snout-vent length of 125 mm. and a tail length of 247 mm. This individual contained eight ova varying in greatest diameter from 10.6 to 12.2 (average 11.1) mm. Also present are numerous ovarian eggs having diameters up to about 3.5 mm.  One of the large males displayed a defensive behavior prior to capture. When first observed the lizard was clinging to a tree trunk about one and one-half meters above the ground. When I approached, the lizard turned its flanks towards me; then it flattened the body laterally, extended the dewlap, opened its mouth, and made short rushing motions. When touched it bit viciously. On the ground these lizards have a rather awkward bipedal gait that is much slower than in _Basiliscus vittatus_.  In life an adult male (KU 55804) was reddish brown dorsally with dark chocolate brown markings; the venter was creamy white, and the iris was dark red. The natives call this lizard _piende jente_.   =Iguana iguana rhinolopha= Wiegmann        Río San Román, 2.  The _iguana_, as this lizard is called locally, seems to be uncommon in the forested areas of southern El Petén. Possibly this is due to the fact that the flesh of this lizard is relished as food by the natives. My two specimens were in large trees at the edge of the river.   =Laemanctus deborrei= Boulenger        Chinajá, 1; Toocog, 5.  On June 26 a female having a snout-vent length of 129 mm. and a tail length of 502 mm. was found on a bush in the forest. The lizard, when approached, faced the collector and opened its mouth. In life the dorsum was bright green; the lateral stripe was white, and the iris was yellowish brown. This specimen contained four ova having lengths of 13.4 to 14.2 (average 13.9) mm.  On June 30 at Toocog five white-shelled eggs were found in a rotting log. Measurements of the eggs are--length, 23.5 to 25.0 (average 24.2) mm.; width, 15.0 to 15.5 (average 15.4) mm. These eggs hatched on August 30. The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38398"],["title","Amphibians and Reptiles of the Rainforests of Southern El Petén, Guatemala (#7)"],["body","young had snout-vent lengths of 43 to 45 (average 44) mm., and tail lengths of 137 to 140 (average 138) mm. In life the hatchlings had a dull dark green dorsum, pale bright green venter and stripes on head, and reddish brown iris. In preservative the hatchlings are creamy tan above with five or six square dark brown blotches middorsally.  The natives consider this lizard to be one of the anoles; consequently, it is known as _toloque_.   =Lepidophyma flavimaculatum flavimaculatum= Duméril        Chinajá, 8; 15 km. NW of Chinajá, 2.  Individuals were found beneath logs on the forest floor or moving about in the litter on the forest floor. One was observed crawling across a trail during a heavy rain. In some adults the tan dorsal spots are large and distinct; in others the spots are small and indistinct. Two juveniles, apparently recent hatchlings, were found on June 28 and July 5. These specimens have snout-vent lengths of 29 mm. and tail lengths of 38 and 41 mm.   =Eumeces schwartzei= Fischer        Chinajá, 1.  One specimen (KU 59551) was found on the forest floor at midday; it is an adult female having a snout-vent length of 125 mm. and a tail length of 210 mm. This specimen is larger than those recorded by Taylor (1936:99) and extends the known range of the species south of Ramate, approximately 125 kilometers south-south-westward to Chinajá.   =Eumeces sumichrasti= (Cope)        20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1.  One adult male having a snout-vent length of 82 mm. was found beneath a palm frond on the forest floor. In life the dorsum was dull brown; the chin was cream; the belly was yellow, and the underside of the tail was orange. A juvenile having a black body, yellow dorsal stripes, and a bright blue tail was observed on the forest floor.   =Scincella cherriei cherriei= (Cope)        Chinajá, 2; 30 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1; Toocog, 1.  All individuals of this lizard were found in the leaf litter on the forest floor; many escaped capture. In life the tail is dull bluish gray. The number of dorsal scales varies from 59 to 61 (average 60); thus, these specimens fall within the range of variation of _S. cherriei cherriei_, and thereby differ from _S. cherriei stuarti_ to the west and _S. cherriei ixbaac_ to the north.   =Ameiva festiva edwardsi= Bocourt        Chinajá, 16; 15 km. NW of Chinajá, 10; Sayaché, 4; Toocog, 1.  This abundant terrestrial lizard, locally called _lagartijo_, is found throughout the forest. A juvenile obtained on March 14 at Sayaxché has a snout-vent length of 42 mm. and a prominent umbilical scar. Other juveniles were observed at Chinajá in February and March, thereby indicating that the young probably hatch in the early part of the year. Juveniles have bright blue tails.   =Celestus rozellae= Smith        20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 2.  Two specimens were obtained from trees by workmen in February. These lizards have snout-vent lengths of 70 and 83 mm. and tail lengths of 133 and 135 mm. There are 21 and 23 lamellae beneath the fourth toe; each has 31 longitudinal rows of scales around the body.   =Boa constrictor imperator= Daudin        15 km. NW of Chinajá, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 2; Toocog, 1.  All specimens were found on the forest floor. One individual was found in combat with a large _Drymarchon corais melanurus_. Apparently, the _Drymarchon_ was attempting to devour the _Boa_, which had a total length of 1683 mm. Locally this snake is called _masacuata_; it is one of the few snakes believed by the local inhabitants to be non-poisonous.   =Clelia clelia clelia= Daudin        15 km. NW of Chinajá, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1.  One specimen is represented only by the head; the snake was killed on the forest floor by workmen. Another individual was found in a pool of water at the base of a limestone outcropping in the forest; this specimen (KU 58167) is a female having a body length of 2220 mm. and a total length of 2634 mm. This snake contained 22 ova averaging 56 × 23 mm. Both specimens were uniform shiny black above and cream-color below. The local name is _sumbadora_.   =Coniophanes bipunctatus bipunctatus= (Günther)        Chinajá, 1.  This snake was found on the forest floor by day; it is a male having 130 ventrals, an incomplete tail; cream-colored belly, and a pair of large brown spots on each ventral scute.   =Coniophanes fissidens fissidens= (Günther)        Toocog, 1.  This male specimen was found beneath a rock in a sink hole. It has 122 ventrals and 77 caudals. A narrow temporal stripe extends along the upper edge of the anterior temporal and the lower edge of the upper secondary temporal. The belly is ashy white with a pair of small black spots on each ventral.   =Coniophanes imperialis clavatus= (Peters)        Chinajá, 3.  All specimens were found on the forest floor by day. These small snakes are capable of rapid movement and quickly disappear in the litter on the ground. Two individuals evaded capture. The belly is creamy white anteriorly and vermillion red posteriorly.   =Dryadophis melanolomus laevis= (Fischer)        Chinajá, 3.  These snakes, locally known as _sumbadora_, were found on the forest floor; two others were seen, but escaped. The variation in coloration has been a source of confusion in this species in northern Central America (see Stuart, 1941:86). All of the present specimens are males: KU 55709 has 178 ventrals, 121 caudals, and a total length of 914 mm.; the dorsum is olive-tan with six darker cross-bars on the neck; the belly is creamy white. KU 58160 has 188 ventrals, 123 caudals, and a total length of 1365 mm.; the dorsum is uniform olive-brown, except that some dorsal scales at midbody have black anterior borders like _D. melanolomus melanolomus_ has in the Yucatán Peninsula; the venter is pale yellow. KU 58158 has 179 ventrals, 122 caudals, and a total length of 723 mm.; the dorsum is rich chocolate brown with eight dark cross-bars on the neck; the belly is bright orange.  Stuart (1941a:87) stated that in life two distinct color phases were observed in specimens collected by him in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. One had an olive-brown dorsum and the other, a reddish orange dorsum. Stuart made no mention of variation in the color of the venter. Similar variation is known in _D. melanolomus alternatus_ in Costa Rica, where some individuals have orange-red venters. This color phase has been recognized as a distinct species, _Dryadophis sanguiventris_, by Taylor (1954:722). Examination of 18 specimens from Costa Rica shows no differences in scutellation, nor geographic segregation of two populations. I am convinced that the red-bellied _Dryadophis_ in Costa Rica, like those in Guatemala, represent a color phase of the subspecies inhabiting those areas and that _Dryadophis sanguiventris_ Taylor is a synonym of _Dryadophis melanolomus alternatus_ (Bocourt).   =Drymarchon corais melanurus= (Duméril, Bibron and Duméril)        15 km. NW of Chinajá, 1; Sayaxché, 1.  The specimen from Sayaxché was found at the edge of a clearing in the forest; that from 15 kilometers northwest of Chinajá was found on the forest floor coiled with a _Boa constrictor imperator_, which the _Drymarchon_ apparently was trying to eat. The _Drymarchon_ is a giant specimen having a total length of 2950 mm. (see Duellman, 1961:368). The _Boa_ with which it was coiled has a total length of 1683 mm. I was attracted to the snakes by a loud thrashing noise. When I approached the writhing mass, the snakes separated, but I was able to see that the _Drymarchon_ had its teeth firmly imbedded in the posterior part of the head of the _Boa_. From the _Drymarchon_ I forced the regurgitation of a recently ingested _Bothrops nummifer nummifer_ having a total length of 953 mm. These observations show that the snake-eating capabilities of _Drymarchon_ can hardly be over-estimated.  In both _Drymarchon_ the anterior one-half of the body is olive-tan, which changes to bluish black posteriorly. The local name is _sumbadora_.   =Drymobius margaritiferus margaritiferus= (Schlegel)        Chinajá, 3; Sayaxché, 1.  All individuals were obtained in clearings in the forest by day in the rainy season. Two individuals each contained a _Similisca baudini_ and another contained a _Bufo valliceps valliceps_. Locally this snake is known by the appropriate name of _ranera_.   =Imantodes cenchoa leucomelas= Cope        Chinajá, 4.  With the exception of one that was found dead in camp, all individuals were taken from low vegetation by day. The dorsum is creamy tan with 28 to 35 (average 32) chocolate brown blotches, and the venter is ashy white with small brown flecks. Three males have 238 to 248 (average 244) ventrals and 148 to 154 (average 151) caudals; one female has 239 ventrals and 142 caudals. The largest specimen, a male, has a body length of 660 mm. and a total length of 943 mm.   =Lampropeltis doliata polyzona= Cope        Chinajá, 1.  One female (KU 57156) having 230 ventrals and 54 caudals was found on the forest floor by day. This individual has a black snout with a white bar across the nasals and prefrontals, a white spot in the middle of the frontal, and a white band across the temporals and parietals that is bordered posteriorly by a black band. There are 28 white and 28 red rings on the body. The tips of the red scales are darkened. The black rings between the white and red rings are not so expanded as to interrupt the white rings dorsally as in _L. doliata abnorma_ as identified by Stuart (1948:70). Locally this snake, like all red, black, and white or yellow banded snakes, is called _coral_ or _coralillo_.   =Leptodeira frenata malleisi= Dunn and Stuart        Toocog, 1.  This specimen, a male having 173 ventrals and 69 caudals, was found beneath the bark on a log in the forest. In life the dorsum was pinkish tan with 36 chocolate brown blotches on the body; the venter was rosy pink.   =Leptodeira septentrionalis polysticta= Günther        Chinajá, 3; Toocog, 11.
