If you get any valuable information you'll let us know at once, of course. Anything else, now?\"  \"No, I don't think so; but I think what I've told you is pretty well enough for the present, eh? I'll let you know some more soon.\"  Brasyer went, and Norton, the steward of the old ship, was brought into the cabin. He was a sharp-eyed, rather cadaverous-looking man, and he spoke with sepulchral hollowness. He had heard, he said, that there was something wrong with the chests of bullion, and came on board to give any information he could. It wasn't much, he went on to say, but the smallest thing might help. If he might speak strictly confidentially he would suggest that observation be kept on Wickens, the carpenter. He (Norton) didn't want to be uncharitable, but his pantry happened to be next the bullion-room, and he had heard Wickens at work for a very long time just below--on the under side of the floor of the bullion-room, it seemed to him, although, of course, he _might_ have been mistaken. Still, it was very odd that the carpenter always seemed to have a job just at that spot. More, it had been said--and he (Norton) believed it to be true--that Wickens, the carpenter, had in his possession, and kept among his stores, keys that fitted the padlocks on the bullion-room door. That, it seemed to him, was a very suspicious circumstance. He didn't know anything more definite, but offered his ideas for what they were worth, and if his suspicions proved unfounded nobody would be more pleased than himself. But--but--and the steward shook his head doubtfully.  \"Thank you, Mr. Norton,\" said Merrick, with a twinkle in his eye; \"we won't forget what you say. Of course, if the stuff is found in consequence of any of your information, you won't lose by it.\"  The steward said he hoped not, and he wouldn't fail to keep his eye on the carpenter. He had noticed Wickens was in the tug, and he trusted that if they were going to question him they would do it cautiously, so as not to put him on his guard. Merrick promised they would.  \"By the bye, Mr. Norton,\" asked Hewitt, \"supposing your suspicions to be justified, what do you suppose the carpenter would do with the bullion?\"  \"Well, sir,\" replied Norton, \"I don't think he'd keep it on the ship. He'd probably dump it somewhere.\"  The steward left, and Merrick lay back in his chair and guffawed aloud. \"This grows farcical,\" he said, \"simply farcical. What a happy family they must have been aboard the _Nicobar_! And now here's the captain watching the second officer, and the second officer watching the captain and the steward, and the steward watching the carpenter! It's immense. And now we're going to see the carpenter. Wonder whom _he_ suspects?\"  Hewitt said nothing, but his eyes twinkled with intense merriment, and presently the carpenter was brought into the cabin.  \"Good-day to you, gentlemen,\" said the carpenter in a soft and deferential voice, looking from one to the other. \"Might I 'ave the honour of addressin' the salvage gentlemen?\"  \"That's right,\" Merrick answered, motioning him to a seat. \"This is the salvage shop, Mr. Wickens. What can we do for you?\"  The carpenter coughed gently behind his hand. \"I took the liberty of comin', gentlemen, consekins o' 'earin' as there was some bullion missin'. P'raps I'm wrong.\"  \"Not at all. We haven't found as much as we expected, and I suppose by this time nearly everybody knows it. There are two cases wanting. You can't tell us where they are, I suppose?\"  \"Well, sir, as to that--no. I fear I can't exactly go as far as that. But if I am able to give vallable information as may lead to recovery of same, I presoom I may without offence look for some reasonable small recognition of my services?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" answered Merrick, \"that'll be all right, I promise you. The company will do the handsome thing, of course, and no doubt so will the underwriters.\"  \"Presoomin' I may take that as a promise--among gentlemen\"--this with an emphasis--\"I'm willing to tell something.\"  \"It's a promise, at any rate as far as the company's concerned,\" returned Merrick. \"I'll see it's made worth your while--of course, providing it leads to anything.\"  \"Purvidin' that, sir, o' course. Well, gentlemen, my story ain't a long one. All I've to say was what I 'eard on board, just before she went down. The passengers was off, and the crew was gettin' into the other boats when the skipper turns to the steward an' speaks to him quiet-like, not observin', gentlemen, as I was agin 'is elbow, so for to say. ''Ere, Norton,' 'e sez, or words to that effeck, 'why shouldn't we try gettin' them things ashore with us--you know, the cases--eh? I've a notion we're pretty close inshore,' 'e sez, 'and there's nothink of a sea now. You take one, anyway, and I'll try the other,' 'e says, 'but don't make a flourish.' Then he sez, louder, 'cos o' the steward goin' off, 'They're the likeliest stuff, and at worst we can but drop 'em. But look sharp,' 'e says. So then I gets into the nearest boat, and that's all I 'eard.\"  \"That was all?\" asked Hewitt, watching the man's face sharply.  \"All?\" the carpenter answered with some surprise. \"Yes, that was all; but I think it's pretty well enough, don't you? It's plain enough what was meant--him and the steward was to take two cases, one apiece, on the quiet, and they was the likeliest stuff aboard, as he said himself. And now there's two cases o' bullion missin'. Ain't that enough?\"  The carpenter was not satisfied till an exact note had been made of the captain's words. Then after Merrick's promise on behalf of the company had been renewed, Wickens took himself off.  \"Well,\" said Merrick, grinning across the table at Hewitt, \"this is a queer go, isn't it? What that man says makes the skipper's case look pretty fishy, doesn't it? What he says, and what Brasyer says, taken together, makes a pretty strong case--I should say makes the thing a certainty. But what a business! It's likely to be a bit serious for some one, but it's a rare joke in a way. Wonder if Brasyer will find out anything more? Pity the skipper and steward didn't agree as to whom they should pretend to suspect. _That's_ a mistake on their part.\"  \"Not at all,\" Hewitt replied. \"_If_ they are conspiring, and know what they're about, they will avoid seeming to be both in a tale. The bullion is in bars, I understand?\"  \"Yes, five bars in each case; weight, I believe, sixteen pounds to a bar.\"  \"Let me see,\" Hewitt went on, as he looked at his watch; \"it is now nearly two o'clock. I must think over these things if I am to do anything in the case. In the meantime, if it could be managed, I should like enormously to have a turn under water in a diving-dress. I have always had a curiosity to see under the sea. Could it be managed now?\"  \"Well,\" Merrick responded, \"there's not much fun in it, I can assure you; and it's none the pleasanter in this weather. You'd better have a try later in the year if you really want to--unless you think you can learn anything about this business by smelling about on the _Nicobar_ down below?\"  Hewitt raised his eyebrows and pursed his lips.  \"I _might_ spot something,\" he said; \"one never knows. And if I do anything in a case I always make it a rule to see and hear everything that can possibly be seen or heard, important or not. Clues lie where least expected. But beyond that, probably I may never have another chance of a little experience in a diving-dress. So if it can be managed I'd be glad.\"  \"Very well, you shall go, if you say so. And since it's your first venture, I'll come down with you myself. The men are all ashore, I think, or most of them. Come along.\"  Hewitt was put in woollens and then in india-rubbers. A leaden-soled boot of twenty pounds' weight was strapped on each foot, and weights were hung on his back and chest.  \"That's the dress that Gullen usually has,\" Merrick remarked. \"He's a very smart fellow; we usually send him first to make measurements and so on. An excellent man, but a bit too fond of the diver's lotion.\"  \"What's that?\" asked Hewitt.  \"Oh, you shall try some if you like, afterwards. It's a bit too heavy for me; rum and gin mixed, I think.\"  A red nightcap was placed on Martin Hewitt's head, and after that a copper helmet, secured by a short turn in the segmental screw joint at the neck. In the end he felt a vast difficulty in moving at all. Merrick had been meantime invested with a similar rig-out, and then each was provided with a communication cord and an incandescent electric lamp. Finally, the front window was screwed on each helmet, and all was ready.  Merrick went first over the ladder at the side, and Hewitt with much difficulty followed. As the water closed over his head, his sensations altered considerably. There was less weight to carry; his arms in particular felt light, though slow in motion. Down, down they went slowly, and all round about it was fairly light, but once on the sunken vessel and among the lower decks, the electric lamps were necessary enough. Once or twice Merrick spoke, laying his helmet against Hewitt's for the purpose, and instructing him to keep his air-pipe, life-line, and lamp connection from fouling something at every step. Here and there shadowy swimming shapes came out of the gloom, attracted by their lamps, to dart into obscurity again with a twist of the tail. The fishes were exploring the _Nicobar_. The hatchway of the lower deck was open, and down this they passed to the orlop deck. A little way along this they came to a door standing open, with a broken lock hanging to it. It was the door of the bullion-room, which had been forced by the divers in the morning.  Merrick indicated by signs how the cases had been found piled on the floor. One of the sides of the room of thin steel was torn and thrust in the length of its whole upper half, and when they backed out of the room and passed the open"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37823"],["title","Neotropical Hylid Frogs, Genus Smilisca (#0)"],["body","OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS   MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY     Volume 17, No. 7, pp. 281-375, pls. 1-12, 17 figs.

Most genera (30) and about 350 species live in the American tropics. _Hyla_ and 10 other genera inhabit Central America; four of those 10 genera (_Gastrotheca_, _Hemiphractus_, _Phrynohyas_, and _Phyllomedusa_) are widely distributed in South America. The other six genera are either restricted to Central America or have their greatest differentiation there. _Plectrohyla_ and _Ptychohyla_ inhabit streams in the highlands of southern Mexico and northern Central America; _Diaglena_ and _Triprion_ are casque-headed inhabitants of arid regions in México and northern Central America. _Anotheca_ is a tree-hole breeder in cloud forests in Middle America. The genus _Smilisca_ is the most widespread geographically and diverse ecologically of the Central American genera.  The definition of genera in the family Hylidae is difficult owing to the vast array of species, most of which are poorly known as regards their osteology, colors in life, and modes of life history. The genera _Diaglena_, _Triprion_, _Tetraprion_, _Osteocephalus_, _Trachycephalus_, _Aparasphenodon_, _Corythomantis_, _Hemiphractus_, _Pternohyla_, and _Anotheca_ have been recognized as distinct from one another and from the genus _Hyla_ on the basis of various modifications of dermal bones of the cranium. _Phyllomedusa_ is recognized on the basis of a vertical pupil and opposable thumb; _Plectrohyla_ is characterized by the presence of a bony prepollex and the absence of a quadratojugal. _Gastrotheca_ is distinguished from other hylids by the presence of a pouch in the back of females. A pair of lateral vocal sacs behind the angles of the jaws and the well-developed dermal glands were used by Duellman (1956) to distinguish _Phrynohyas_ from _Hyla_. He (1963a) cited the ventrolateral glands in breeding males as diagnostic of _Ptychohyla_. Some species groups within the vaguely defined genus _Hyla_ have equally distinctive characters. The _Hyla septentrionalis_ group is characterized by a casque-head, not much different from that in the genus _Osteocephalus_ (Trueb, MS). Males in the _Hyla maxima_ group have a protruding bony prepollex like that characteristically found in _Plectrohyla_.  Ontogenetic development, osteology, breeding call, behavior, and ecology are important in the recognition of species. By utilizing the combination of many morphological and biological factors, the genus _Smilisca_ can be defined reasonably well as a natural, phyletic assemblage of species. Because the wealth of data pertaining to the morphology and biology of _Smilisca_ is lacking for most other tree frogs in Middle America it is not possible at present to compare _Smilisca_ with related groups in more than a general way.  _Smilisca_ is an excellent example of an Autochthonous Middle American genus. As defined by Stuart (1950) the Autochthonous Middle American fauna originated from \"hanging relicts\" left in Central America by the ancestral fauna that moved into South America and differentiated there at a time when South America was isolated from North and Middle America. The genus _Smilisca_, as we define it, consists of six species, all of which occur in Central America. One species ranges northward to southern Texas, and one extends southward on the Pacific lowlands of South America to Ecuador. We consider the genus _Smilisca_ to be composed of rather generalized hylids. Consequently, an understanding of the systematics and zoogeography of the genus can be expected to be of aid in studying more specialized members of the family.   Acknowledgments  Examination of many of the specimens used in our study was possible only because of the cooperation of the curators of many systematic collections. For lending specimens or providing working space in their respective institutions we are grateful to Doris M. Cochran, Alice G. C. Grandison, Jean Guibe, Robert F. Inger, Günther Peters, Gerald Raun, William J. Riemer, Jay M. Savage, Hobart M. Smith, Wilmer W. Tanner, Charles F. Walker, Ernest E. Williams, and Richard G. Zweifel.  We are indebted to Charles J. Cole and Charles W. Myers for able assistance in the field. The cooperation of Martin H. Moynihan at Barro Colorado Island, Charles M. Keenan of Corozal, Canal Zone, and Robert Hunter of San José, Costa Rica, is gratefully acknowledged. Jay M. Savage turned over to us many Costa Rican specimens and aided greatly in our work in Costa Rica. James A. Peters helped us locate sites of collections in Ecuador and Coleman J. Goin provided a list of localities for the genus in Colombia.  We especially thank Charles J. Cole for contributing the information on the chromosomes, and Robert R. Patterson for preparing osteological specimens. We thank M. J. Fouquette, Jr., who read the section on breeding calls and offered constructive criticism.  Permits for collecting were generously provided by Ing. Rodolfo Hernandez Corzo in México, Sr. Jorge A. Ibarra in Guatemala, and Ing. Milton Lopez in Costa Rica. This report was made possible by support from the National Science Foundation (Grants G-9827 and GB-1441) and the cooperation of the Museum of Natural History at the University of Kansas. Some of the field studies were carried out in Panamá under the auspices of a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH GM-12020) in cooperation with the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory in Panamá.   Materials and Methods  In our study we examined 4151 preserved frogs, 93 skeletal preparations, 88 lots of tadpoles and young, and six lots of eggs. We have collected specimens in the field of all of the species. Observations on behavior and life history were begun by the senior author in México in 1956 and completed by us in"]]]
