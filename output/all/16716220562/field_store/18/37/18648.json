The first two miles of the road might be termed uninteresting, because flat and monotonous, but it is uninteresting only to those who have no eye for the beauty of the wild flowers that line the banks, no ear for the melody of birds.  Wargrave, just two miles on the road, lies among its trees pretty close to the river's bank.  I should not like to call it a health resort all the year round, owing to the killing fogs that bury it at times, but in the season it is a pleasant spot at which to spend a week.  Wyatt's is the inn, a well-known river house indeed--old-fashioned, clean, and comfortable.  There is a sign on a pole outside which is worth taking a look at.  Mr Leslie and Mr Hodson (the well-known artists) were sojourning here once upon a time, taking their ease at their inn. Perhaps it was raining, and the time felt long.  Anyhow, between them they painted that sign, and there it hangs--Saint George on one side engaged in deadly combat with a monster dragon; on the other side the dragon lying dead, and Saint George dismounted, and engaged refreshing himself with a tankard of foaming ale.  From Wargrave to Henley the scenery is sweetly pretty, and the river never leaves your side, though at times it hides behind and beneath the spreading trees.  As every one has heard or read about or been at Henley Regatta, so every one knows something of Henley itself.  It is a charming little town, and the wooded hills about, with, even on their summits, the white mansions peeping through the trees, the river--broad and sweeping--the fine old bridge, and the church, combine to form not one picture only, but a picture in whichever direction you choose to look.  From the top of the church steeple the views on all sides are delightful.  I recommend this plan of seeing scenery to my American friends at present visiting England, and to every one else; never miss a chance of visiting the churches and getting up into the steeple.  By this means I have oftentimes found refreshment both for mind and body.  If it were not that I wish to wander and roam through my native land, and actually _feel_ from home, I could write a book on Berkshire alone. Even in the immediate neighbourhood of Twyford there are hundreds of beautiful spots, which those in search of health and quiet pleasure would do well to visit.  Marlow is a delightful village; all round Maidenhead, up and down the river, it is even more so.  One might say of the country hereabouts, especially in summer and autumn,--    \"A pleasing land of drowsy head it is,   Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye   Of gay castles...  And soft delights that witchingly   Instil a wanton sweetness thro' the breast.\"  CHAPTER FIVE.  A FIRST WEEK'S OUTING.    \"From the moist meadow to the withered hill,   Led by the breeze, the vivid verdure runs   And swells and deepens to the cherished eye;   The hawthorn whitens; and the juicy groves   Put forth their buds, unfolding by degrees,   Till the whole leafy forest stands displayed   In full luxuriance to the sighing gales,   Where the deer rustle through the twining brake,   And the birds sing concealed.\"    Thornton's \"Seasons.\"  Early in May I left my village to enjoy a taste of gipsy life in earnest--a week on the road.  Matilda is a splendid mare, and a very handsome one.  Strong and all though she be, there was in my mind a doubt as to whether she could drag the Wanderer on day after day at even the rate of ten miles in the twenty-four hours.  It had been raining the night before, and as the road from our yard leads somewhat up hill, it was no wonder that the immense caravan stuck fast before it got out of the gate.  This was a bad beginning to a gipsy cruise, and, as a small concourse of neighbours had assembled to witness the start, was somewhat annoying.  But a coal-carter's horse came to the rescue, and the start was finally effected.  Matilda took us through Twyford at a round trot, and would fain have broken into a gallop, but was restrained.  But the long hill that leads up from the Loddon bridge took the extra spirit out of her, and she soon settled down to steady work.  There is a pretty peep of Reading to be caught from the top of the railway bridge.  No traveller should miss seeing it.  Rested at Reading, our smart appearance exciting plenty of curiosity. It was inside that the crowd wanted to peep--it is inside all crowds want to peep, and they are never shy at doing so.  The town of Reading is too well-known to need description; its abbey ruins are, however, the best part of it, to my way of thinking.  The day was as fine as day could be, the sky overcast with grey clouds that moderated the sun's heat.  Our chosen route lay past Calcot Park, with its splendid trees, its fine old solid-looking, redbrick mansion, and park of deer.  This field of deer, I remember, broke loose one winter.  It scattered in all directions; some of the poor creatures made for the town, and several were spiked on railings.  The people had \"sport,\" as they called it, for a week.  It was almost gloomy under the trees that here overhang the road. Matilda was taken out to graze, the after-tent put up, and dinner cooked beneath the caravan.  Cooked! ay, and eaten too with a relish one seldom finds with an indoor meal!  On now through Calcot village, a small and straggling little place, but the cottages are neat and pretty, and the gardens were all ablaze with spring-flowers, and some of the gables and verandahs covered with flowering clematis.  The country soon got more open, the fields of every shade of green--a gladsome, smiling country, thoroughly English.  This day was thoroughly enjoyable, and the mare Matilda did her work well.  Unhorsed and encamped for the night in the comfortable yard of the Crown Inn.  When one sleeps in his caravan in an inn yard he does not need to be called in the morning; far sooner than is desirable in most instances, cocks begin to noisily assert their independence, dogs bark or rattle their chains, cows moan in their stalls, and horses clatter uneasily by way of expressing their readiness for breakfast.  By-and-bye ostlers come upon the scene, then one may as well get up as lie a-bed.  Though all hands turned out at seven o'clock am, it was fully eleven before we got under way, for more than one individual was curious to inspect us, and learn all the outs and ins of this newest way of seeing the country.  The forenoon was sunny and bright, and the roads good, with a coldish headwind blowing.  Both road and country are level after leaving Theale, with plenty of wood and well-treed braelands on each side.  This for several miles.  Jack's Booth, or the Three Kings, is a long, low house-of-call that stands by the wayside at cross roads: an unpleasant sort of a place to look at.  By the way, who was Jack, I wonder, and what three kings are referred to?  The name is suggestive of card-playing.  But it may be historical.  The fields are very green and fresh, and the larks sing very joyfully, looking no bigger than midges against the little fleecy cloudlets.  I wonder if it be more difficult for a bird to sing on the wing than on a perch.  The motion, I think, gives a delightful tremolo to the voice.  My cook, steward, valet, and general factotum is a lad from my own village, cleanly, active, and very willing, though not gifted with too good a memory, and apt to put things in the wrong place--my boots in the oven, for instance!  He sleeps on a cork mattress, in the after-compartment of the Wanderer, and _does not snore_.  A valet who snored would be an unbearable calamity in a caravan.  Hurricane Bob, my splendid Newfoundland, sleeps in the saloon on a morsel of red blanket.  He _does_ snore sometimes, but if told of it immediately places his chin over his fore-paw, and in this position sleeps soundly without any nasal noise.  On our way to Woolhampton--our dining stage--we had many a peep at English rural life that no one ever sees from the windows of a railway carriage.  Groups of labourers, male and female, cease work among the mangolds, and, leaning on their hoes, gaze wonderingly at the Wanderer. Even those lazy workaday horses seem to take stock of us, switching their long tails as they do so, in quite a businesslike way.  Yonder are great stacks of old hay, and yonder a terribly-red brick farm building, peeping up through a cloudland of wood.  We took Matilda out by the roadside at Woolhampton.  This village is very picturesque; it lies in a hollow, and is surrounded by miniature mountains and greenwood.  The foliage here is even more beautiful than that around Twyford.  We put up the after-tent, lit the stove, and prepared at once to cook dinner--an Irish stew, made of a rabbit, rent in pieces, and some bacon, with sliced potatoes--a kind of cock-a-leekie.  We flavoured it with vinegar, sauce, salt, and pepper.  It _was_ an Irish stew--perhaps it was a good deal Irish, but it did not eat so very badly, nor did we dwell long over it.  The fresh air and exercise give one a marvellous appetite, and we were hungry all day long.  But every one we met seemed to be hungry too.  A hunk of bread and bacon or bread and cheese appears to be the standing dish.  Tramps sitting by the wayside, navvies and roadmen, hawkers with barrows--all were carving and eating their hunks.  A glorious afternoon.  With cushions and rugs, our broad _coupe_ makes a most comfortable lounge, which I take advantage of.  Here one can read, can muse, can dream, in a delightfully lethargic frame of mind.  Who _would_ be a dweller in dusty cities, I wonder, who can enjoy life like this?  Foley--my valet--went on ahead on the Ranelagh Club (our caravan tricycle) to spy out the land at Thatcham and look for quarters for the night.  There were certain objections to the inn he chose, however; so, having settled the Wanderer on the broad village green, I went to another inn.  A blackish-skinned, burly, broad-shouldered fellow answered my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37687"],["title","The Cruise of the Land-Yacht \"Wanderer\"; or, Thirteen Hundred Miles in my (#6)"],["body","s. Gruff he was in the extreme.  \"I want stabling for the night for one horse, and also a bed for my driver.\"  This from me.  \"Humph!  I'll go and see,\" was the reply.  \"Very well; I'll wait.\"  The fellow returned soon.  \"Where be goin' to sleep yourse'f?\"  This he asked in a tone of lazy insolence.  I told him mildly I had my travelling saloon caravan.  I thought that by calling the Wanderer a _saloon_ I would impress him with the fact that I was a gentleman gipsy.  Here is the answer in full.  \"Humph!  Then your driver can sleep there too.  We won't 'ave no wan [van] 'osses 'ere; and wot's more, we won't 'ave no wan folks!\"  My Highland blood got up; for a moment I measured that man with my eye, but finally I burst into a merry laugh, as I remembered that, after all, Matilda was only a \"wan\" horse, and we were only \"wan\" folks.  In half an hour more both Matilda and my driver were comfortably housed, and I was having tea in the caravan.  Thatcham is one of the quietest and quaintest old towns in Berkshire. Some of the houses are really studies in primeval architecture.  I could not help fancying myself back in the Middle Ages.  Even that gruff landlord looked as if he had stepped out of an old picture, and were indeed one of the beef-eating, bacon-chewing retainers of some ancient baronial hall.  It was somewhat noisy this afternoon on the village green.  The young folks naturally took us for a show, and wondered what we did, and when we were going to do it.  Meanwhile they amused themselves as best they could.  About fifty girls played at ball and \"give-and-take\" on one side of the green, and about fifty boys played on the other.  The game the boys played was original, and remarkable for its simplicity.  Thus, two lads challenged each other to play, one to be deer, the other to be hound.  Then round and round and up and down the green they sped, till finally the breathless hound caught the breathless deer.  Then \"a ring\" of the other lads was formed, and deer and hound had first to wrestle and then to fight.  And _vae victis_! the conquered lad had no sooner declared himself beaten than he was seized and thrown on his back, a rope was fastened to his legs, and he was drawn twice round the ground by the juvenile shouting mob, and then the fun began afresh.  A game like this is not good for boys' jackets, and tailors must thrive in Thatcham.  Next day was showery, and so was the day after, but we continued our rambles all the same, and enjoyed it very much indeed.  But now on moist roads, and especially on hills, it became painfully evident that Matilda--who, by the way, was only on trial--was not fit for the work of dragging the Wanderer along in all countries and in all weathers.  She was willing, but it grieved me to see her sweat and pant.  Our return journey was made along the same route.  Sometimes, in making tea or coffee, we used a spirit-of-wine stove.  It boiled our water soon, and there was less heat.  Intending caravanists would do well to remember this.  Tea, again, we found more quickly made than coffee, and cocoatina than either.  As we rolled back again towards Woolhampton the weather was very fine and sunny.  It was a treat to see the cloud shadows chasing each other over the fields of wind-tossed wheat, or the meadows golden with buttercups, and starred with the ox-eyed daisies.  The oldest of old houses can be seen and admired in outlying villages of Berkshire, and some of the bold Norman-looking men who inhabit these take the mind back to Merrie England in the Middle Ages.  Some of these men look as though they could not only eat the rustiest of bacon, but actually swallow the rind.  On our way back to Theale we drew up under some pine-trees to dine.  The wind, which had been blowing high, increased to half a gale.  This gave me the new experience--that the van rocked.  Very much so too, but it was not unpleasant.  After dinner I fell asleep on the sofa, and dreamt I was rounding the Cape of Good Hope in a strong breeze.  There is a road that leads away up to Beenham Hill from Woolhampton from which, I think, one of the loveliest views in Berks can be had.  A long winding avenue leads to it--an avenue.  \"O'erhung with wild woods thickening green,\" and \"braes\" clad in brackens, among which wild flowers were growing--the sweet-scented hyacinth, the white or pink crane's-bill, the little pimpernel, and the azure speedwell.  The hill is wooded--and such woods!--and all the wide country seen therefrom is wooded.  Surely spring tints rival even those of autumn itself!  This charming spot is the home _par excellence_ of the merle and thrush, the saucy robin, the bold pert chaffie, and murmuring cushat.  Anchored at Crown Inn at Theale once more.  A pleasant walk through the meadows in the cool evening.  Clover and vetches coming into bloom, or already red and white.  A field of blossoming beans.  Lark singing its vesper hymn.  I was told when a boy it was a hymn, and I believe it still.  After a sunset visit to the steeple of Theale Church we turned in for the night.  Bob has quite taken up his commission as caravan guard.  By day he sleeps on the broad _coupe_, with his crimson blanket over his shoulders to keep away the cold May winds; and when we call a halt woe be to the tramp who ventures too near, or who looks at all suspicions!  On leaving the Crown Inn yard, Matilda made an ugly \"jib,\" which almost resulted in a serious accident to the whole expedition.  Matilda has a mind of her own.  I do _not_ like a horse that thinks, and I shall not have much more of Matilda.  To be capsized in a dogcart by a jibbing horse would be bad enough, but with our great conveyance it would mean something akin to shipwreck.  The last experience I wish to record in this chapter is this; in caravan travelling there is naturally more fatigue than there would be in spending the same time in a railway carriage.  When, therefore, you arrive in the evening at one village, you have this feeling--that you must be hundreds of miles from another.  [One soon gets used to caravan travelling, however, and finds it far less fatiguing than any other mode of progression.]  \"Is it possible,\" I could not help asking myself, \"that Thatcham is only ten or twelve miles from Theale, and that by train I could reach it in fifteen minutes?  It feels to me as if it were far away in the wilds of Scotland.\"  People must have felt precisely thus in the days before railways were invented, and when horses were the only progressive power.  CHAPTER SIX.  OUR LAST SPRING RAMBLE.    \"The softly warbled song   Comes from the pleasant woods, and coloured wings   Glance quick in the bright sun, that moves along   The forest openings.    \"And the bright sunset fills   The silver woods with light, the green slope throws   Its shadow in the hollows of the hill,   And wide the upland glows.\"    Longfellow.  It is now well into the middle of June.  Like the lapwing in autumn, I have been making short flights here, there, and everywhere within a day's march previous to the start on my \"journey due north.\"  Whatever it might be to others, with longer and wiser heads, to me the greatest difficulty has been in getting horses to suit.  I have tried many.  I have had jibbers, bolters, kickers; and one or two _so_ slow, but _so_ sore, that an eighty-one-ton gun fired alongside them would not increase their pace by a yard to the mile.  To get horsed may _seem_ an easy matter to many.  It might _be_ easy for some, only it ought to be borne in mind that I am leaving home on a long journey--one, at all events, that will run to weeks and mayhap months; a journey not altogether unattended with danger--and that; my horses are my motor power.  If they fail me I have nothing and no one to fall back upon.  Hence my anxiety is hardly to be wondered at.  But here let me say that caravanning for health and pleasure had better not be undertaken with a single carriage, however well horsed.  There ought to be two caravans at least.  Then, in the event of coming to an ugly hill, there is an easy way of overcoming it--by bending all your horse-power on to one carriage at a time, and so trotting them over the difficulty.  To go all alone as I am about to do is really to go at considerable risk; and at this moment I cannot tell you whether I am suitably horsed or not.  But in the stable yonder stand quietly in their stalls Pea-blossom and Corn-flower, of whom more anon.  Pea-blossom is a strong and good-looking dark bay mare of some fifteen hands and over; Corn-flower is a pretty light bay horse.  They match well; they pull together; and in their buff leather harness they really look a handsome pair.  They are good in the feet, too, and good \"doers,\" to use stable phraseology.  Corn-flower is the best \"doer,\" however.  The rascal eats all day, and would deprive himself of sleep to eat.  Nothing comes wrong to Corn-flower.  Even when harnessed he will have a pull at anything within reach of his neck.  If a clovery lea be beneath his feet, so much the better; if not, a \"rive\" at a blackthorn hedge, a bush of laurels, a bracken bank, or even a thistle, will please him.  I'm not sure, indeed, that he would not eat an old shoe if nothing else came handy.  But Pea-blossom is more dainty.  It is for her we fear on the march.  She was bought from a man who not only _is_ a dealer, but is not ashamed to sign himself dealer; whereas Corn-flower was bought right off farm work.  Well, time will tell.  Yes, spring is waning, though hardly yet has summer really come, so backward and cold has the season been.  We have had our last day's pleasant outing _en famille_.  Mamma went, and even baby Ida, who is old enough to ask questions and make queer remarks.  A clear sky and the brightest of sunshine, though not distressingly hot. We crossed country for Wokingham.  The trees very beautiful, though the leaves are already turning more crisp; in spring time, city reader mine, as the wind goes"]]]
