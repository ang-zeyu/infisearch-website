In the latter case, the young are reared in the nest; in the former, they sometimes enter the water at an early age.  The one egg laid by Murres is remarkable both in color and in shape. In color it varies from bluish green to buff, and is usually heavily scrawled with black. In outline it is pyriform or pear-shaped. When moved it does not roll away as would a hen's egg but revolves about its own tip. In this manner it retains its place on the narrow ledges often chosen by Murres for nesting-sites.

SKUAS and JAEGERS. StercorariidÃ¦. 4 species.     Family 2. GULLS and TERNS. LaridÃ¦. 37 species, 1 subspecies.     Family 3. SKIMMERS. RynchopidÃ¦. 1 species.   Skuas and Jaegers are pirates among the birds of the high seas. Bold and dashing, they pursue the swift flying Terns or much larger Gulls with equal success, forcing them to drop the fish they have captured and catching it ere it reaches the water.  Gulls (Subfamily _LarinÃ¦_) are usually considered so characteristic of the sea that 'Sea Gull' is the name popularly applied to all members of the subfamily to which they belong. Several species, however, are equally at home, both in the winter and when nesting, on the larger bodies of water in the interior, and one species is rarely or never found on our sea coasts.  Gulls nest on the ground, on drifts of marsh-grass, on cliffs, and one species, at least, among American Gulls (the Herring Gull) has as a result of persecution, acquired the habit of nesting in trees.  Gulls feed from the surface of the water, picking up their food with their strongly curved bills in passing or while hovering, not by plunging into the water, as do the Terns. They are, in fact, the scavengers of the water, and perform a service of great value to mankind by devouring the bodies of various forms of aquatic animals which, in dying, come to the surface and, if cast ashore, might, in decaying, prove a source of disease.  For this reason it was especially unfortunate that the plumage of these birds became fashionable for millinery purposes, with the result that thousands of them were destroyed for their wings and breasts. In this country, however, through the efforts of the American Ornithologists' Union and the Audubon Societies, laws have been passed prohibiting the killing of these beautiful and useful birds, and wardens have been placed on their nesting grounds to protect them.  Gulls often rest in great flocks on the water, sitting high up and riding the waves buoyantly, but the Terns (Subfamily _SterninÃ¦_), after they have acquired the power of flight, are rarely seen on the water. They are lighter, more active birds than the Gulls, with longer wings and tails, and sharper, more pointed bills. They feed largely on small fish (the species called silversides being a favorite) of no value to man, which they secure by darting from the air with great speed and directness. When looking for food, Terns usually fly with the bill downward, a habit which will aid in distinguishing them from the Gulls, whose bill is carried in a line with the body.  Terns usually nest in large colonies on the beach of some isolated islet either on our sea coasts or in the interior. The nest is generally composed of a few wisps of sea-weed or grass, or the two or three eggs are not infrequently laid in a slight hollow in the sand or among the shells and pebbles.  Like the Gulls, Terns have been slaughtered in enormous numbers for millinery purposes; but in this country, at least, effective efforts are now being made to preserve them.  Skimmers nest in numbers on our Atlantic Coast from Virginia southward, laying their four eggs in a slight depression in the sand. In feeding, their mouth is held open and the longer, thin, lower mandible is dropped beneath the surface of the water, when, flying rapidly, they readily pick up food.  In young Skimmers, however, the two mandibles are of equal length and the lower mandible does not become appreciably longer than the upper one until the birds begin to fly. During the flightless period of the bird's life, the bill may be used to pick up food along the shore, but when the power of flight is acquired and with it ability to feed in the characteristic Skimmer manner, then the peculiar bill of these birds becomes fully developed.  The young of all the Gulls and Terns are born covered with down and can leave the nest a few hours after birth. The Noddy, however, is said to be several weeks in its stick nest, which, unlike other members of its group, it often builds in bushes.  The young are colored to harmonize with their usual surroundings. Young Skimmers are pale, sandy brown, of the same color as the sand in which they are hatched. Young Terns are darker, and young Laughing Gulls born in nests of reeds or meadow grasses, are the darkest of the three.  All young Gulls and Terns have the habit of squatting low near the ground in the presence of danger and remaining motionless until actually touched when they seem to realize that they have been seen and trust to their legs for safety.
