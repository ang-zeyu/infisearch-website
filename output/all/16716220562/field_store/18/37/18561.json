We might even consider whether the two might not be given together; this would abundantly fill one concert. Discuss the requisite means, etc., for giving these, with Riedel.)  B) Wagner. What am I to say to you of Wagner? Have you had any talk with him lately in Leipzig? On what terms are you with him at present?...Ah, it is a pity that we cannot procure a stream of gold for him, or have some palaces of gold built for him! What can he do with admiration, enthusiasm, devotion, and all such non-essential things?  Nevertheless it is our indebtedness and duty to remain faithful and devoted to him. The whole German Musik-Verein shall raise up a brazen wall in his honor!--He is verily worthy of it!  Hence, dear friend, see what can be arranged with Wagner. Since I left Berlin we have not corresponded. But I am surprised almost that I did not receive a line from him after Blandine's death! .--.  Au revoir, therefore, dear friend. In Weimar or in Leipzig only can I tell you what I may be able to accomplish later. I must, however, most urgently beg to be exempted from undertaking to direct the German Musik-Verein for the year '63!--  With cordial and most friendly greetings,  Yours sincerely,  November 8th [1862]  F. Liszt  P.S.--Best thanks for your Sondershausen essays.    10. To A. W. Gottschalg  Dear Friend,  Your kind letter reached me on October 22nd, and this day, which could not pass without sorrow, has this year been brightened by many loving and solemn remembrances. Accept my thanks, and present my best remembrances to all those whose names you mention, and who have so kindly thought of me. Unfortunately there is no prospect of my soon being able to celebrate the 22nd October with Weimar friends; but I may tell you that I intend paying H.R.H. the Grand Duke a visit during the course of the summer. And we two shall then also have a bright and happy day in Tieffurt--and look through a couple of new Organ pieces together. Grosse must not fail to be there likewise, nor his trombone box, which I have specially had in my mind ever since the journey to Paris. [Grosse took his instrument with him on the journey, in order that it might be at hand in case Liszt should want it.] Meanwhile, however, tell dear, good Grosse not to be vexed about the delay in connection with the promised despatch of his \"Sonntags-Posaunenstuck.\" [Sunday piece for trombone.] It is long since finished, also some three or four Organ pieces, which, dear friend, I wrote for you last spring. But the postal arrangements are so little safe, under present circumstances, that I do not care to send manuscripts by this means. In despatching parcels to Vienna or Paris I could, of course, make use of the courtesy of the embassies; but it is more difficult with Weimar...and so the parcel with the \"Legend of Saint Elizabeth,\" the three Psalms instrumented (and essentially remodelled), several Pianoforte and Organ pieces, together with Grosse's \"Sunday-piece,\" must remain in my box till some perfectly reliable opportunity presents itself. If the worst comes to the worst I shall bring the whole lot myself.  The Schneider-Organ-Album, and the one to appear later--the Arnstadter-Bach-Organ-Album (which is to contain the magnificent fugal subject from Bach's Cantata that I arranged for the Organ-- and not without difficulty), I beg you to keep in your library till my return.  I am very unpleasantly affected by the hyper-mercantile craftiness of one of my publishers whom you mention in your letter. It would truly be unjust if you were not to receive the usual discount, and indeed an exceptional amount, when purchasing the \"Faust Symphony.\" But who would ever succeed in washing a negro white? And, in addition, one has generally to put up with the inky blackness of his bills!--I could tell many a tale of such doings, and indeed of persons who are afterwards not ashamed to talk braggingly of their friendship for me! \"O friends, not these tones, rather let us strike up pleasanter ones,\" sings Beethoven.  The \"Elizabeth,\" it is to be hoped, contains something of the sort. At least, as far as possible, I have labored carefully at the work, and, so to say, lived it through for more than a year. In No. 3 of the score--the \"Crusaders\"--you will come across the old pilgrim song from the days of the Crusades which you had the kindness to communicate to me. It has rendered me good service for the second subject of the \"Crusaders' March.\" In the concluding notice of the score I acknowledge my thanks to you for it and give the whole song from your copy.  Among the pleasant bits of news (exceptions to the rule!) which reach me from our quarters is that about the improvement of your pecuniary position, which is probably accompanied by your appointment as teacher at the newly established Seminary classes. In the way of merit you lack nothing, and nothing in zeal and energetic perseverance. Let me hope, dear friend, that you may more and more meet with your due reward!  With kindest greetings,  F. Liszt  Rome, November 15th, 1862    11. To Eduard Liszt  Dearest Eduard,  The feeling of our double relationship is to me always an elevating and comforting one. Truly you abide with me, as I do with you--cum sanguine, corde et mente.  Accept my thanks for your kind lines, and excuse my not having written to you long ago. I might indeed have told you many a thing of more or less interest; but all seemed to me tiresome and insufficient in writing to you. I needed more than ever, and above all things, ample time to compose myself, to gather my thoughts, and to bestir myself. During the first year of my stay here I secured this. It is to be hoped that you would not be dissatisfied with the state of mind which my 50th year brought me; at all events I feel it to be in perfect harmony with the better, higher aspirations of my childhood, where heaven lies so near the soul of every one of us and illuminates it! I may also say that, owing to my possessing a more definite and clearer consciousness, a state of greater peacefulness has come over me.  Blandine has her place in my heart beside Daniel. Both abide with me bringing atonement and purification, mediators with the cry of \"Sursum corda!\"--When the day comes for Death to approach, he shall not find me unprepared or faint-hearted. Our faith hopes for and awaits the deliverance to which it leads us. Yet as long as we are upon earth we must attend to our daily task. And mine shall not lie unproductive. However trifling it may seem to others, to me it is indispensable. My soul's tears must, as it were, have lacrymatoria made for them; I must set fires alight for those of my dear ones that are alive, and keep my dear dead in spiritual and corporeal urns. This is the aim and object of the Art task to me.  Yon know that I have finished the \"Legend of Saint Elizabeth\" (200 pages of score--2 and 1/2 hours' duration in performance). In addition to this some other compositions have been produced, such as: the \"SunCanticus (\"Cantico del Sole\") of Saint Franciscus\"--an instrumental Evocatio in the Sistine Chapel-two Psalms, etc. I trust you may again find us in these, in mind and feeling.  I am now about to set myself the great task of an Oratorio on Christ. By the 22nd October, '63, I hope to have solved the difficulty as far as my weakness and strength will permit.  As you see, dearest Eduard, it is impossible to get out of my head the idea of writing notes. [Notenkopfe] In spite of all good precepts and friendly counsellors (who mean it much better by me than I can ever understand!) I go so far as to maintain that for several years past and in many yet to come I have not done and shall not do anything more ingenuous than cheerfully to go on composing. And what more harmless occupation could there be? especially as I never force my little works upon any one, nay, have frequently begged persons to refrain from giving certain too unconscientious [Play on words \"gewissen\" and \"ungewissenhaft\"] renderings of them,--and that I ask for no further appreciation or approval than can, in fact, be granted according to taste and disposition.  From Pest I have lately received through Baron Pronay, in the name of the Council of the Conservatoire, an invitation to establish my domicile there, and to promote the interests of Hungarian music. Probably you will hear of my excusatory reply.  Between ourselves, and frankly said in plain German, it would be of no advantage to me again to take up any outward musical activity (such as my conductorship in Weimar which came to an end a few years ago, and after September 1861 became a locked door to me through my Chamberlain's key). But possibly I may later find a fitting opportunity for composing something for Hungary. After the precedent of the \"Gran Mass\" I might, for instance, on some extraordinary occasion, be entrusted, say, with a \"Te Deum\" or something of the kind. I would gladly do my best, and only on some such terms could I regard my return to Hungary as becoming.  Meanwhile remains quietly in Rome, honestly striving to do his duty as a Christian and an artist,  Thine from his heart,  F. Liszt  Rome, November 19th (St. Elizabeth's Day), 1862    12. To Dr. Franz Brendel  Dear Friend,  The difficulties and troubles of the musical situation of which you speak in your last letter but one, I can, unfortunately, only too well understand. No one is better acquainted with such matters than I am, and hence no one is better able to appreciate and recognise the value of your unselfish, persevering work and efforts, which also show you so sincere in your convictions. And one of the dark sides in my present position, dear friend, is that I can be of so little use to you, that I am compelled to remain in a state of passivity and forbearance that does not at all agree with me. However, you may rely upon my readiness to render any assistance wherever I may still be able to help.--In accordance with your wish I shall take an "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3750"],["title","Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 2 (#8)"],["body","opportunity of writing to Prince H[ohenzollern] concerning the Tonkunstler- Verein. It is to be hoped that our amiable, noble-minded patron will show himself no less disposed in our favor than he has done on former occasions. And you, on your part, do not fail to discuss with Seifriz by letter the points and modals of the support expected. It is a pity that Bulow's proposal to hold the next meeting of the T.K. Verein in Lowenberg has not proved feasible. Were it likely to be broached again I should not make any objections to it, because, in fact, the place seems to be precisely a favorable centre at present. But, as already said, it is not my place to express any definite opinion on the subject, and I am entirely satisfied in leaving all that has to be done to your judgment and foresight.  I am delighted to hear of Bulow's extraordinary success in Leipzig, and still more so to hear of your renewed and intimate relations with him. He is the born prototype of progress, and noble-minded to a degree! Without his active co-operation as director and standard-bearer a Tonkunstler-Versammlung at the present time would at least be an anachronism.  From Wagner I lately received a letter in which he informed me of a performance of his \"Tristan\" in Vienna towards the end of January. Afterwards he intends arranging some concerts in Berlin- -and, it seems, in St. Petersburg also. My endeavors to secure him comfortable quarters in Weimar seem for the time being to be useless, because of his dislike to an insignificant appointment, and the adverse circumstances of life in a small town. Certainly his project of drawing annually 3,000 thalers (*450 British pounds sterling*), by some agreement between the Grand Dukes of Weimar and Baden, is much more to the point. The question is only whether their Highnesses will consent to it? .--.  With heartiest greetings, most sincerely yours,  F. Liszt  December 30th, 1862    13. To Breitkopf and Hartel  Dear Herr Doctor,  The four scores of the Beethoven Symphonies, of which you advised me in your friendly letter, reached me yesterday. My eyes are meanwhile revelling and delighting in all the glories of the splendid edition, and after Easter I shall set to work. Nothing shall be wanting on my part, in the way of goodwill and industry, to fulfil your commission to the best of my power. A pianoforte arrangement of these creations must, indeed, expect to remain a very poor and far-off approximation. How instil into the transitory hammers of the Piano breath and soul, resonance and power, fulness and inspiration, color and accent?--However I will, at least, endeavor to overcome the worst difficulties and to furnish the pianoforte-playing world with as faithful as possible an illustration of Beethoven's genius.  And I must ask you, dear Herr Doctor, in order that the statement on all the title pages--\"critically revised edition\"--may be complied with, to send me--together with your new edition of the scores of the \"Pastoral,\" the C minor, and A major Symphonies--a copy of my own transcriptions of them. Probably I may alter, simplify, and correct passages--and add some fingerings. The more intimately acquainted one becomes with Beethoven, the more one clings to certain singularities and finds that even insignificant details are not without their value. Mendelssohn, at whose recommendation you formerly published my pianoforte scores of the \"Pastoral\" and C minor Symphonies, took great delight in these minutiae and niceties!--  With regard to the agreement about the A major Symphony I mean shortly to write to Carl Haslinger, and expect that he will be quite willing to meet my wish. [A pianoforte transcription of this Symphony by Liszt had been published by Haslinger.]  With grateful thanks, dear Herr Doctor, I remain yours in readiness and sincerity,  F. Liszt  Rome, March 26th, 1863  P.S.--The four Symphonies shall be finished before the end of summer and sent to Leipzig. If you are satisfied with my work would you entrust the arrangement of the Overtures to me when I have finished the Symphonies--provided, of course, that you have not made any agreement with any one else?    14. To A. W. Gottschalg in Weimar  Dear Friend,  This year my name-day fell in the middle of Easter week, on Maundy Thursday. Your hearty letter again brought what to me is the pleasantest news in the world. Thank you for it, and let those know of it who share your sincere, friendly, and faithful sentiments! First let me mention Carl Gotze, [A chorister in Weimar (a favorite copyist of the Master's) became a musical conductor in Magdeburg and died in 1886.] whose kindly words I should so gladly like to answer in accordance with his wish, and then my dear Kammer-virtuoso, Grosse. Grosses trombone no doubt officiated brilliantly at Bulow's concert and at the performance of Berlioz's opera! An echo of the former reached me, thanks to your inspired notice in Brendel's paper, where I accidentally came across a little remark which you had addressed to one of the most estimable and graceful of German lady-singers anent my little-heeded songs. I certainly cannot find fault with you for showing some interest in the songs and for thus frankly expressing your opinion. On the contrary, your sympathetic appreciation is always welcome, amid the direct and indirect disparagement which falls to my lot. Unfortunately, however, I must make up my mind that only by way of an exception can I expect to find friends for my compositions. The blame is mine; why should one presume to feel independently, and set the comfortable complacency of other folks at defiance?--Everything that I have written for several years past shows something of a pristine delinquency which is as little to be pardoned as I am unable to alter it. This fault, it is true, is the life-nerve of my compositions, which, in fact, can only be what they are and nothing else.--  In the Psalms I have made some important alterations, and shall shortly send Kahnt the manuscript. A few passages (especially the verse \"Sing us one of the songs of Zion\") which had always appeared awkward to me in the earlier version, I have now managed to improve. At least they now pretty well satisfy my soul's ear.  The \"Christus\" Oratorio is progressing but slowly, owing to the many interruptions which I have to put up with this winter. It is to be hoped I may obtain some entire months of work during the summer. I thirst for it.  Of the musical undertakings here you will learn the more noteworthy events from a paper I sent to Brendel last week. Further and fuller news about myself is meanwhile uncertain. Probably I shall in the end not find myself able to do anything better than to put my whole story in the musical notes that I am incessantly writing down, but which need not either be printed or heard.  However that may be, I remain, dear friend, in sincere affection, yours gratefully and in all friendship,  F. Liszt  Rome, April 14th, 1863  P.S.--The Bach-Album and other music which you say you had to send me (e.g., your arrangement of the Dante fugue if it has been printed) please let me have through Kahnt. Enclose also a copy of the Ave Maria for Organ.  [Figure: Musical Score Excerpt]    15. To Dr. Franz Brendel  Dear friend,  The last months brought so many interruptions in my work that I still feel quite vexed about it. Easter week I had determined should, at last, see me regularly at work again; but a variety of duties and engagements have prevented my accomplishing this. I must, therefore, to be true to myself and carry out my former intention, shut myself up entirely. To find myself in a net of social civilities is vexatious to me; my mental activity requires absolutely to be free, without which I cannot accomplish anything.  How things will turn out later about my proposed journey to Germany I do not yet know. Probably my weary bones will be buried in Rome. Till then their immovability will serve you better than my wandering about on railways and steamboats. On the other hand, there is but little for me to do in Germany. War is at the door; drums and cannon will come to the fore; God protect the faith of heroes and give victory to the righteous among humanity! .--.  Where is Wagner, and what about the performances of \"Tristan\", the \"Nibelungen\", and the \"Meistersinger\" in Weimar or elsewhere? Tell me of this. I have not written to Weimar for long, and have also not had any news from there. My only German correspondent (Frau von Bulow) is suffering from some eye-trouble, which has interrupted our exchange of letters...so I am absolutely ignorant of what is going on. The February numbers of the \"Neue Zeitschrft\" are the last I have received. Your articles on Criticism are excellent, and, indeed, nothing else was to be expected. Give Louis Kohler my most friendly thanks for his kind perseverance in \"paving the way for my scores to receive more kindly appreciation.\" The more thankless the task the more heartily grateful do I feel to my friends.  Most sincerely yours,  F. Liszt  Rome, May 8th, 1863    16. To Eduard Liszt  Dearest Eduard,  Weariness or something of the sort carried my thoughts back to my \"Berceuse.\" Various other \"Berceuses\" rose up in my dreams. Do you care to join my dreams? It shall not cost you any trouble; without touching the keyboard yourself, you will only need to rock yourself in the sentiments that hover over them. A really amiable and variously gifted lady will see to this. She plays the little piece delightfully, and has promised me to let it exercise its charms upon you. I shall, therefore, ere long send you a copy of the new version of the \"Berceuse\" addressed \"to the Princess Marcelline Czartoryska, Klostergasse 4.\" [A pupil of Chopin's] Wend yourway thither--and, in case you do not find the Princess at home, leave the manuscript with your card. I have already told her of your contemplated visit, and have spoken of you as my heart's kinsman and friend. You will"]]]
