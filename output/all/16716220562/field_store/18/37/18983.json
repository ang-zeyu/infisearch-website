B. TYRRELL, M.A.      TORONTO     THE CHAMPLAIN SOCIETY     1911         _All rights reserved._         PREFACE      BY SIR EDMUND WALKER     _President of the Champlain Society_   When the Champlain Society was first organised in 1905 one of the works on its list of proposed publications was the _Journal_ of Samuel Hearne. This book, written with great literary charm, is the first account preserved to us of an attempt to explore the interior of far-northern Canada from a base on Hudson Bay. The natives had brought to Fort Prince of Wales glowing reports of a vast store of copper at the mouth of a river which flowed into the Arctic Ocean. An attempt to find it was inevitable. Twice Hearne failed, but his third effort succeeded and, after a laborious journey, he reached the mouth of the Coppermine River. Soon after he was promoted to command at Fort Prince of Wales, now Churchill, on Hudson Bay. France had joined Britain's revolted colonies in their war on the mother land, and one day, in 1782, a French squadron, under the well-known seaman, La Pérouse, dropped anchor before Fort Prince of Wales. Hearne, mightier with the pen than with the sword, surrendered meekly enough in spite of his massive walls from thirty to forty feet thick. Thus ingloriously he dies out of history.  Hearne's _Journal_, published after his early death, has become a rather rare book. Besides the narrative of what he did, it contains copious notes on the natural history of the region which he was the first white man to make known. A new edition has long been needed. Yet to secure competent editing was a difficult task, since few knew the remote country which Hearne explored. It may be regarded as fortunate that the new edition has been delayed, for only now are we able to present Hearne's story with the annotations necessary to give it the last possible elucidation. The needed knowledge is supplied by Mr. J. B. Tyrrell and Mr. E. A. Preble, two writers pre-eminently suited for their task by journeys in the regions described by Hearne, on parts of which so few white men have set eyes.  Mr. J. B. Tyrrell began his work of exploring in North Western Canada in 1883, and during the ensuing fifteen years he made many important additions to our knowledge of the geology and geography of what is still the least known part of Canada. In 1893, accompanied by his brother, Mr. J. W. Tyrrell, as his assistant, he traversed the so-called Barren Grounds from Lake Athabasca eastward to Chesterfield Inlet, and from there his party paddled in canoes down the west shore of Hudson Bay to Fort Churchill. Of the 3200 miles thus traversed, 1650 were previously unsurveyed and unmapped. From Fort Churchill Mr. Tyrrell walked eight or nine hundred miles on snowshoes to the southern end of Lake Winnipeg. In 1894 he again crossed the Barren Grounds, this time travelling from the north end of Reindeer Lake to a point on Hudson Bay, about 200 miles south-west of Chesterfield Inlet. Thence he went to Churchill as before in canoes along the open coast. From Churchill Mr. Tyrrell again, but by another route, walked on showshoes to the southern end of Lake Winnipeg. On this journey he travelled about 2900 miles, of which 1750 were by canoe and 750 on snowshoes. Almost the whole journey was through previously unexplored country. For the geographical work done in these two years he was awarded the Back Premium by the Royal Geographical Society of London.  In response to an enquiry whether any other white man has visited the regions described by Hearne, Mr. Tyrrell writes:--      \"I happen to be the only one since Hearne who has conducted     explorations in the country lying between Fort Churchill and the     eastern end of Great Slave Lake and south of latitude 63° N.     Except Hearne, I and those who accompanied and assisted me are     the only white men who have crossed that great stretch of     country, north of a line between the mouth of the Churchill     River and Lake Athabasca and a line between the east end of     Great Slave Lake and Chesterfield Inlet. Absolutely the only     information that I had about the region when I visited it, other     than what I had secured in conversation with Indians, was     contained in Hearne's book. My last journey was made sixteen     years ago, and no white man has since travelled across that     country. With the building of the railroad to Fort Churchill, it     will doubtless soon be visited. Since I made a survey of     Chesterfield Inlet and its vicinity, my brother, Mr. J. W.     Tyrrell, has crossed from the east end of Great Slave Lake by     the Hanbury River to Chesterfield Inlet, making a survey as he     went, and the Royal North West Mounted Police have sent parties     from the Mackenzie River to Hudson Bay along this route, using     my brother's maps as their guide. It is hardly necessary to say     that a magnificent field for exploration is still left in that     far northern country.\"  So much as to Mr. Tyrrell's work. For the notes explaining Hearne's many observations on natural history we are indebted to Mr. E. A. Preble of Washington. Mr. Preble spent a summer on the west shore of Hudson Bay north of Fort Churchill. He also spent the summers of 1901 and 1903, the winter of 1903-4, and the summers of 1904 and 1907 on the Athabasca and Mackenzie Rivers and on the Barren Grounds north of Great Slave Lake. This most important study of the fauna of Northern Canada was undertaken by Mr. Preble on behalf of the Biological Survey of the United States Department of Agriculture. The various reports and other publications arising from the journeys of Mr. Tyrrell and the investigations of Mr. Preble are mentioned in a bibliographical note at the end of this volume.  This is the first work relating to the West to be published by the Champlain Society. It has already begun an extensive list of the works of early writers on Eastern Canada. The year 1911 will, it is hoped, see the completion of the three volumes of Lescarbot's _History of New France_, now for the first time entirely translated into English. In this as in all other publications of the Society the original text is given with the translation. Nicolas Denys was the first writer to describe in detail the coasts of eastern Canada, and the Society has republished his great book, adequately translated and with copious notes. It has done the same with Le Clercq's account of Gaspé and its interesting natives. The writings of Champlain, entirely translated into English for the first time, will soon appear in six volumes. The regions lying west of Lake Superior have a history as interesting, but the material is scattered. Hearne's _Journal_ makes a good beginning. In preparation are the _Journals_ of La Vérendrye, the first white man to come in sight of the Rocky Mountains by an overland route. His writings will now for the first time be translated into English. The Society is sparing no pains to provide volumes bearing on the Hudson's Bay Company. Much further work on examining and classifying the papers of the Company will, however, be necessary before anything final can be done. Meanwhile members will enjoy the pleasant narrative of Hearne edited by the competent observers whose services the Society has had the good fortune to secure.  TORONTO, _January 1911_.

When a young man, only twenty-four years old, he was sent on foot to explore the interior of a great continent. Though he knew nothing of mines or minerals, he, like many a man similarly equipped since his day, was to report on a great mining property. Naturally his report on the \"mine\" of copper is of little value, but his account of Northern Canada and of the life of the natives who inhabited it is the first published detailed description of any portion of the interior of Western Canada. Very few men of his age accomplished so much, and fewer still have published such admirable narratives of their enterprises.  All that we know of Hearne's early life is contained in an obituary notice which appeared in the _European Magazine and London Review_ for June 1797, entitled \"Some Account of the late Mr. Samuel Hearne, Author of 'A Journey from Prince of Wales Fort, in Hudson's Bay, to the Northern Ocean, undertaken by order of the Hudson's Bay Company for the discovery of Copper Mines, a North-West Passage, &c., in the years 1769, 1770, 1771, and 1772.'\"      \"Mr. Samuel Hearne was born in the year 1745. He was the son of     Mr. Hearne, Secretary to the Waterworks, London Bridge, a very     sensible man, and of a respectable family in Somersetshire; he     died of fever in his 40th year, and left Mrs. Hearne with this     son, then but three years of age, and a daughter two years     older. Mrs. Hearne, finding her income too small to admit her     living in town as she had been accustomed to, retired to     Bimmester, in Dorsetshire (her native place), where she lived as     a gentlewoman, and was much respected. It was her wish to give     her children as good an education as the place afforded, and     accordingly [she] sent her son to school at a very early period,     but his dislike to reading and writing was so great that he made     very little progress in either. His masters, indeed, spared     neither threats nor persuasion to induce him to learn, but their     arguments were thrown away on one who seemed predetermined never     to become a learned man; he had, however, a very quick     apprehension, and, in his childish sports, showed unusual     activity and ingenuity; he was particularly fond of drawing, and     though he never had the least instruction in the art, copied     with great delicacy and correctness even from nature. Mrs.     Hearne's friends, finding her son had no taste for study,     advised her fixing on some business, and proposed such as they     judged most suitable for him; but he declared himself utterly     averse to trade, and begged he might be sent to sea. His mother     very reluctantly complied with his request, took him to     Portsmouth, and remained with him till he sailed. His captain     (now Lord Hood) promised to take care of him, and he kept his     word; for he gave him every indulgence his youth required. He     was then but eleven years of age. They had a warm engagement     soon after he entered, and took several prizes. The captain told     him he should have his share, but he begged, in a very     affectionate manner, it should be given to his mother, and she     should know best what to do with it. He was a midshipman several     years under the same commander; but, either on the conclusion of     the war, or having no hopes of preferment, he left the navy, and     entered into the service of the Hudson's Bay Company as mate of     one of their sloops. He was, however, soon distinguished from     his associates by his ingenuity, industry, and a wish to     undertake some hazardous enterprise by which mankind might be     benefited. This was represented to the Company, and they     immediately applied to him as a proper person to be sent on an     expedition they had long had in view, viz. to find out the     North-West Passage. He gladly accepted the proposal, and how far     he succeeded is shown to the public in his Journal. On his     return he was advanced to a more lucrative post at Prince of     Wales Fort, on Hudson Bay, and in a few years was made     Commander-in-Chief, in which position he remained till 1782,     when the French unexpectedly landed at Prince of Wales Fort,     took possession of it, and after having given the governor leave     to secure his own property, seized the stock of furs, &c. &c.,     and blew up the fort. At the Company's request Mr. H. went out     the year following, saw it rebuilt,[1] and the new Governor     settled in his habitation (which they took care to fortify a     little better than formerly), and returned to England in 1787.     He had saved a few thousands, the fruits of many years'     industry, and might, had he been blessed with prudence, have     enjoyed many years of ease and plenty; but he had lived so long     where money was of no use that he seemed insensible of its value     here, and lent it with little or no security to those he was     scarcely acquainted with by name. Sincere and undesigning     himself, he was by no means a match for the duplicity of others.     His disposition, as may be judged by his writing, was naturally     humane; what he wanted in learning and polite accomplishments he     made up in native simplicity and innate goodness; and he was so     strictly scrupulous with regard to the property of others that     he was heard to say a few days before his death, 'He could lay     his hand on his heart and say he had never wronged any man of     sixpence.'      \"Such are the outlines of Mr. Hearne's character, who, if he had     some failings, had many virtues to counterbalance them, of which     charity was not the least. He died of the dropsy, November 1792,     aged 47.\"  He seems to have entered the service of the Hudson's Bay Company and to have been sent to Fort Prince of Wales, the great stone fortification on the low bare rocky point at the mouth of the Churchill River on Hudson Bay, when he was about twenty years old. For several years he was engaged in the fur trade with the Eskimos, up and down the coast of Hudson Bay, north of Churchill River. One little glimpse is caught of him, on July 1, 1767, for on that day he chiselled his name on the smooth hard rock of Sloops Cove, on the west side of Churchill harbour. When I visited the place, in 1894, the name was as fresh and plain as if his hammer and chisel had just been laid aside.  Being possessed of much more than the average amount of ability and enthusiasm, he was chosen by Moses Norton, the energetic Governor of Fort Prince of Wales, to go out with the Indians into the vast, and as far as that was then known, limitless, territory west of Hudson Bay, in order to find and prospect the place where the native copper had been found which the Indians often brought with them to the fort.  During the year preceding his departure on his first expedition, he had had an excellent opportunity to perfect himself in a knowledge of astronomical and geodetic work, for in the summer of 1768 the annual ship had brought William Wales, F.R.S., and Joseph Dymond from London, commissioned by the Royal Society to remain at Fort Prince of Wales throughout the ensuing year in order to observe the transit of Venus over the sun on the 3rd of June 1769.[2] They remained at the fort until the ship left again for London in August of the following year (1769). Mr. Wales was one of the foremost astronomers, mathematicians, and litterateurs of his age. Shortly after his return to England he was appointed to accompany Captain Cook on his voyage around the world in the _Resolution_ in 1772-74, and again on his last voyage in 1776-79. His presence for more than a year among the little band of white men assembled at this remote fur-trading post on Hudson Bay must have had a helpful influence in preparing Hearne for his great explorations overland to the Arctic Ocean. This book is an account of three journeys which he undertook in rapid succession into the country west of Hudson Bay and north-west of Fort Prince of Wales in search of the fabled bed of copper ore, from which pure copper could be loaded"]]]
