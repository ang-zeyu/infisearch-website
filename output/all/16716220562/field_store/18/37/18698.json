When I went back to the sofa and took the tourniquet from Mrs. Grant, she went over and pulled up the blinds.  It would be hard to imagine anything more ghastly than the appearance of the room with the faint grey light of early morning coming in upon it. As the windows faced north, any light that came was a fixed grey light without any of the rosy possibility of dawn which comes in the eastern quarter of heaven.  The electric lights seemed dull and yet glaring; and every shadow was of a hard intensity.  There was nothing of morning freshness; nothing of the softness of night.  All was hard and cold and inexpressibly dreary.  The face of the senseless man on the sofa seemed of a ghastly yellow; and the Nurse’s face had taken a suggestion of green from the shade of the lamp near her.  Only Miss Trelawny’s face looked white; and it was of a pallor which made my heart ache.  It looked as if nothing on God’s earth could ever again bring back to it the colour of life and happiness.  It was a relief to us all when Doctor Winchester came in, breathless with running.  He only asked one question:  “Can anyone tell me anything of how this wound was gotten?”  On seeing the headshake which went round us under his glance, he said no more, but applied himself to his surgical work.  For an instant he looked up at the Nurse sitting so still; but then bent himself to his task, a grave frown contracting his brows.  It was not till the arteries were tied and the wounds completely dressed that he spoke again, except, of course, when he had asked for anything to be handed to him or to be done for him.  When Mr. Trelawny’s wounds had been thoroughly cared for, he said to Miss Trelawny:  “What about Nurse Kennedy?”  She answered at once:  “I really do not know.  I found her when I came into the room at half-past two o’clock, sitting exactly as she does now.  We have not moved her, or changed her position.  She has not wakened since.  Even Sergeant Daw’s pistol-shots did not disturb her.”  “Pistol-shots?  Have you then discovered any cause for this new outrage?”  The rest were silent, so I answered:  “We have discovered nothing.  I was in the room watching with the Nurse. Earlier in the evening I fancied that the mummy smells were making me drowsy, so I went out and got a respirator.  I had it on when I came on duty; but it did not keep me from going to sleep.  I awoke to see the room full of people; that is, Miss Trelawny and Sergeant Daw, being only half awake and still stupefied by the same scent or influence which had affected us, fancied that he saw something moving through the shadowy darkness of the room, and fired twice.  When I rose out of my chair, with my face swathed in the respirator, he took me for the cause of the trouble.  Naturally enough, he was about to fire again, when I was fortunately in time to manifest my identity.  Mr. Trelawny was lying beside the safe, just as he was found last night; and was bleeding profusely from the new wound in his wrist.  We lifted him on the sofa, and made a tourniquet.  That is, literally and absolutely, all that any of us know as yet.  We have not touched the knife, which you see lies close by the pool of blood. Look!” I said, going over and lifting it. “The point is red with the blood which has dried.”  Doctor Winchester stood quite still a few minutes before speaking:  “Then the doings of this night are quite as mysterious as those of last night?”  “Quite!” I answered.  He said nothing in reply, but turning to Miss Trelawny said:  “We had better take Nurse Kennedy into another room.  I suppose there is nothing to prevent it?”  “Nothing!  Please, Mrs. Grant, see that Nurse Kennedy’s room is ready; and ask two of the men to come and carry her in.”  Mrs. Grant went out immediately; and in a few minutes came back saying:  “The room is quite ready; and the men are here.”  By her direction two footmen came into the room and, lifting up the rigid body of Nurse Kennedy under the supervision of the Doctor, carried her out of the room.  Miss Trelawny remained with me in the sick chamber, and Mrs. Grant went with the Doctor into the Nurse’s room.  When we were alone Miss Trelawny came over to me, and taking both my hands in hers, said:  “I hope you won’t remember what I said.  I did not mean it, and I was distraught.”  I did not make reply; but I held her hands and kissed them.  There are different ways of kissing a lady’s hands.  This way was intended as homage and respect; and it was accepted as such in the high-bred, dignified way which marked Miss Trelawny’s bearing and every movement.  I went over to the sofa and looked down at the senseless man. The dawn had come much nearer in the last few minutes, and there was something of the clearness of day in the light.  As I looked at the stern, cold, set face, now as white as a marble monument in the pale grey light, I could not but feel that there was some deep mystery beyond all that had happened within the last twenty-six hours.  Those beetling brows screened some massive purpose; that high, broad forehead held some finished train of reasoning, which the broad chin and massive jaw would help to carry into effect.  As I looked and wondered, there began to steal over me again that phase of wandering thought which had last night heralded the approach of sleep.  I resisted it, and held myself sternly to the present.  This was easier to do when Miss Trelawny came close to me, and, leaning her forehead against my shoulder, began to cry silently.  Then all the manhood in me woke, and to present purpose.  It was of little use trying to speak; words were inadequate to thought. But we understood each other; she did not draw away when I put arm protectingly over her shoulder as I used to do with my little sister long ago when in her childish trouble she would come to her big brother to be comforted.  That very act or attitude of protection made me more resolute in my purpose, and seemed to clear my brain of idle, dreamy wandering in thought.  With an instinct of greater protection, however, I took away my arm as I heard the Doctor’s footstep outside the door.  When Doctor Winchester came in he looked intently at the patient before speaking. His brows were set, and his mouth was a thin, hard line. Presently he said:  “There is much in common between the sleep of your Father and Nurse Kennedy. Whatever influence has brought it about has probably worked the same way in both cases.  In Kennedy’s case the coma is less marked. I cannot but feel, however, that with her we may be able to do more and more quickly than with this patient, as our hands are not tied.  I have placed her in a draught; and already she shows some signs, though very faint ones, of ordinary unconsciousness.  The rigidity of her limbs is less, and her skin seems more sensitive—or perhaps I should say less insensitive—to pain.”  “How is it, then,” I asked, “that Mr. Trelawny is still in this state of insensibility; and yet, so far as we know, his body has not had such rigidity at all?”  “That I cannot answer.  The problem is one which we may solve in a few hours; or it may need a few days.  But it will be a useful lesson in diagnosis to us all; and perhaps to many and many others after us, who knows!” he added, with the genuine fire of an enthusiast.  As the morning wore on, he flitted perpetually between the two rooms, watching anxiously over both patients.  He made Mrs. Grant remain with the Nurse, but either Miss Trelawny or I, generally both of us, remained with the wounded man. We each managed, however, to get bathed and dressed; the Doctor and Mrs. Grant remained with Mr. Trelawny whilst we had breakfast.  Sergeant Daw went off to report at Scotland Yard the progress of the night; and then to the local station to arrange for the coming of his comrade, Wright, as fixed with Superintendent Dolan.  When he returned I could not but think that he had been hauled over the coals for shooting in a sick-room; or perhaps for shooting at all without certain and proper cause.  His remark to me enlightened me in the matter:  “A good character is worth something, sir, in spite of what some of them say.  See! I’ve still got leave to carry my revolver.”  That day was a long and anxious one.  Toward nightfall Nurse Kennedy so far improved that the rigidity of her limbs entirely disappeared.  She still breathed quietly and regularly; but the fixed expression of her face, though it was a calm enough expression, gave place to fallen eyelids and the negative look of sleep. Doctor Winchester had, towards evening, brought two more nurses, one of whom was to remain with Nurse Kennedy and the other to share in the watching with Miss Trelawny, who had insisted on remaining up herself.  She had, in order to prepare for the duty, slept for several hours in the afternoon.  We had all taken counsel together, and had arranged thus for the watching in Mr. Trelawny’s room.  Mrs. Grant was to remain beside the patient till twelve, when Miss Trelawny would relieve her.  The new nurse was to sit in Miss Trelawny’s room, and to visit the sick chamber each quarter of an hour.  The Doctor would remain till twelve; when I was to relieve him.  One or other of the detectives was to remain within hail of the room all night; and to pay periodical visits to see that all was well. Thus, the watchers would be watched; and the possibility of such events as last night, when the watchers were both overcome, would be avoided.  When the sun set, a strange and grave anxiety fell on all of us; and in our separate ways we prepared for the vigil.  Doctor Winchester had evidently been thinking of my respirator, for he told me he would go out and get one.  Indeed, he took to the idea so kindly that I persuaded Miss Trelawny also to have one which she could put on when her time for watching came.  And so the night drew on.

[A] Vasco da Gama.     PREFACE.   I have been asked to write a story of Ferdinand Magellan, the value of whose discoveries has received a new interpretation in the development of the South Temperate Zone of America, and in the ceding of the Philippine Islands to the United States. The works of Lord Stanley and of Guillemard furnish comprehensive histories of the intrepid discoverer of the South Pacific Ocean and the Philippine Islands; but there would seem to be room for a short, picturesque story of Magellan's adventures, such as might be read by family lamps and in schools.  To attempt to write such a story is more than a pleasure, for the study of Magellan reveals a character high above his age; a man unselfish and true, who was filled with a passion for discovery, and who sought the welfare of humanity and the glory of the Cross rather than wealth or fame. Among great discoverers he has left a character well-nigh ideal. The incidents of his life are not only honorable, but usually have the color of chivalry.  His voyages, as pictured by his companion Pigafetta, the historian, give us our first view of the interesting native inhabitants of the South Temperate Zone and of the Pacific archipelagoes, and his adventures with the giants of Patagonia and with the natives of the Ladrone Islands, read almost like stories of Sinbad the Sailor. The simple record of his adventures is in itself a storybook.  Magellan, from his usually high and unselfish character, as well as for the lasting influence of what he did as shown in the new developments of civilization, merits a place among household heroes; and it is in this purpose and spirit I have undertaken a simple sympathetic interpretation of his most noble and fruitful life. I have tried to put into the form of a story the events whose harvests now appear after nearly four hundred years, and to picture truthfully a beautiful and inspiring character. To the narrative of his lone lantern I have added some tales of the Philippines.                                                        H.

CHAPTER I.  A STRANGE ROYAL ORDER.   I am to tell the story of a man who had faith in himself.  The clouds and the ocean bear his name. Lord Stanley has called him \"the greatest of ancient and modern navigators.\"  That was a strange royal order, indeed, which Dom Manoel, King of Portugal, issued in the early part of the fifteenth century. It was in effect: \"Go to the house of Hernando de Magallanes, in Sabrosa, and tear from it the coat of arms. Hernando de Magallanes (Ferdinand Magellan) has transferred his allegiance to the King of Spain.\"  The people of the mountain district must have been very much astonished when the cavaliers, if such they were, appeared to execute this order.  As the arms were torn away from the ancient house, we may imagine the alcalde of the place inquiring:  \"What has our townsman done? Did he not serve our country well in the East?\"  \"He is a renegade!\" answers the commander.  \"But he carried his plans for discovery to our own King first before he went to the court of Spain.\"  \"Say no more! Spain is reaping the fruits of his brain, and under his lead is planting her colonies in the new seas, to the detriment of our country and the shame of the throne. His arms must come down. Portugal rejects his name forever!\"  The officers of the King tore down the arms. They thought they had consigned"]]]
