It seems to me, indeed, that instead of courting a sense for the aromatic in literature, the critic should rather guard himself against its insidious approaches.  Disporting himself in such pleasures of the fancy, he finds it easy to believe, and to make us believe, that a piece of literature gains in intrinsic value from its power to stimulate his historical sense.  The modern appreciative critic, in short, is too likely to be the dupe of his \"sophisticated reverie,\"--like an epicure who should not taste the meat for the sauces.  A master work, once beautiful according to the great and general laws, never becomes, properly speaking, either more or less so.  If a piece of art can take us with its own beauty, there is no point in superimposing upon it shades of sentiment; if it cannot so charm, all the rose-colored lights of this kind of appreciative criticism are unavailing.  The \"literary\" treatment of art, as the \"emotional\" treatment of literature,--for that is what \"appreciation\" and \"interpretation\" really are,--can completely justify itself only as the crowning touch of a detailed aesthetic analysis of those \"order of impression distinct in kind\" which are the primary elements in our pleasure in the beautiful.  It is the absence--and not only the absence, but the ignoring of the possibility--of such analysis which tempts one to rebel against such phrases as those of Professor Gates:  \"the splendid and victorious womanhood of Titian's Madonnas,\" \"the gentle and terrestrial grace of motherhood in those of Andrea del Sarto,\" the \"sweetly ordered comeliness of Van Dyck's.\"  One is moved to ask if the only difference between a Madonna of Titian and one of Andrea is a difference of temper, and if the important matter for the critic of art is the moral conception rather than the visible beauty.  I cannot think of anything for which I would exchange the enchanting volumes of Walter Pater, and yet even he is not the ideal aesthetic critic whose duties he made clear.  What he has done is to give us the most exquisite and delicate of interpretations.  He has not failed to \"disengage\" the subtle and peculiar pleasure that each picture, each poem or personality, has in store for us; but of analysis and explanation of this pleasure--of which he speaks in the Introduction to \"The Renaissance\"--there is no more.  In the first lines of his paper on Botticelli, the author asks, \"What is the peculiar sensation which his work has the property of exciting in us?\"  And to what does he finally come?  \"The peculiar character of Botticelli is the result of a blending in him of a sympathy for humanity in its uncertain conditions...with his consciousness of the shadow upon it of the great things from which it sinks.\"  But this is not aesthetic analysis!  It is not even the record of a \"peculiar sensation,\" but a complex intellectual interpretation. Where is the pleasure in the irrepressible outline, fascinating in its falseness,--in the strange color, like the taste of olives, of the Spring and the Pallas?  So, also, his great passage on the Mona Lisa, his \"Winckelmann,\" even his \"Giorgione\" itself, are merely wonderful delineations of the mood of response to the creations of the art in question.  Such interpretation as we have from Pater is a priceless treasure, but it is none the less the final cornice, and not the corner stone of aesthetic criticism.  The tendency to interpretation without any basis in aesthetic explanation is especially seen in the subject of our original discussion,--literature.  It is indeed remarkable how scanty is the space given in contemporary criticism to the study of an author's means to those results which we ourselves experience.  Does no one really care how it is done?  Or are they all in the secret, and interested only in the temperament expressed or the aspect of life envisaged in a given work? One would have thought that as the painter turned critic in Fromentin at least to a certain extent sought out and dealt with the hidden workings of his art, so the romancer or the poet-critic might also have told off for us \"the very pulse of the machine.\"  The last word has not been said on the mysteries of the writer's art.  We know, it may be, how the links of Shakespeare's magic chain of words are forged, but the same cannot be said of any other poet.  We have studied Dante's philosophy and his ideal of love; but have we found out the secrets of his \"inventive handling of rhythmical language\"?  If Flaubert is univerally acknowledged to have created a masterpiece in \"Madame Bovary,\" should there not be an interest for criticism in following out, chapter by chapter, paragraph by paragraph, word by word, the meaning of what it is to be a masterpiece?  But such seems not to be the case.  Taine reconstructs the English temperament out of Fielding and Dickens; Matthew Arnold, although he deals more than others in first principles, never carries his analysis beyond the widest generalizations, like the requirement for \"profound truth\" and \"high seriousness,\" for great poetry.  And as we run the gamut of contemporary criticism, we find ever preoccupation with the personality of the writers and the ideas of their books.  I recall only one example--the critical essays of Henry James--where the craftsman has dropped some hints on the ideals of the literary art; and even that, if I maybe allowed the bull, in his novels rather than in his essays, for in critical theory he is the most ardent of impressionists.  Whatever the cause, we cannot but allow the dearth of knowledge of, and interest in, the peculiar subject-matter of criticism,-- the elements of beauty in a work of literature.  But although the present body of criticism consists rather of preliminaries and supplements to what should be its real accomplishment, these should not therefore receive the less regard.  The impressionist has set himself a definite task, and he has succeeded.  If not the true critic, he is an artist in his own right, and he has something to say to the world.  The scientific critic has taken all knowledge for his province; and although we hold that it has rushed in upon and swamped his distinctly critical function, so long as we may call him by his other name of natural historian of literature, we can only acknowledge his great achievements.  For the appreciative critic we have less sympathy as yet, but the \"development of the luxurious intricacy and the manifold implications of our enjoyment\" may fully crown the edifice of aesthetic explanation and appraisal of the art of every age. But all these, we feel, do not fulfill the essential function; the Idea of Criticism is not here.  What the idea of criticism is we have tried to work out:  a judgment of a work of art on the basis of the laws of beauty.  That such laws there are, that they exist directly in the relation between the material form and the suggested physical reactions, and that they are practically changeless, even as the human instincts are changeless, we have sought to show.  And if there can be a science of the beautiful, then an objective judgment on the basis of the laws of the beautiful can be rendered.  The true end of criticism, therefore, is to tell us whence and why the charm of a work of art:  to disengage, to explain, to measure, and to certify it.  And this explanation of charm, and this stamping it with the seal of approval, is possible by the help, and only by the help, of the science of aesthetics,--a science now only in its beginning, but greatly to be desired in its full development.  How greatly to be desired we realize in divining that the present dearth of constructive and destructive criticism, of all, indeed, except interpretations and reports, is responsible for the modern mountains of machine-made literature.  Will not the aesthetic critic be for us a new Hercules, to clear away the ever growing heap of formless things in book covers?  If he will teach us only what great art means in literature; if he will give us never so little discussion of the first principles of beauty, and point the moral with some \"selling books,\" he will at least have turned the flood.  There are stories nowadays, but few novels, and plenty of spectacles, but no plays; and how should we know the difference, never having heard what a novel ought to be?  But let the aesthetic critic give us a firm foundation for criticism, a real understanding of the conditions of literary art; let him teach us to know a novel or a play when we see it, and we shall not always mingle the wheat and the chaff.   II THE NATURE OF BEAUTY   II THE NATURE OF BEAUTY  EVERY introduction to the problems of aesthetics begins by acknowledging the existence and claims of two methods of attack,--the general, philosophical, deductive, which starts from a complete metaphysics and installs beauty in its place among the other great concepts; and the empirical, or inductive, which seeks to disengage a general principle of beauty from the objects of aesthetic experience and the facts of aesthetic enjoyment: Fechner's \"aesthetics from above and from below.\"  The first was the method of aesthetics par excellence.  It was indeed only through the desire of an eighteenth-century philosopher, Baumgarten, to round out his \"architectonic\" of metaphysics that the science received its name, as designating the theory of knowledge in the form of feeling, parallel to that of \"clear,\" logical thought.  Kant, Schelling, and Hegel, again, made use of the concept of the Beautiful as a kind of keystone or cornice for their respective philosophical edifices. Aesthetics, then, came into being as the philosophy of the Beautiful, and it may be asked why this philosophical aesthetics does not suffice--why beauty should need for its understanding also an aesthetics \"von unten.\"  The answer is not that no system of philosophy is universally accepted, but that the general aesthetic theories have not, as yet at least, succeeded in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3751"],["title","The Psychology of Beauty (#4)"],["body","the plain questions of \"the plain man\" in regard to concrete beauty.  Kant, indeed, frankly denied that the explanation of concrete beauty, or \"Doctrine of Taste,\" as he called it, was possible, while the various definers of beauty as \"the union of the Real and the Ideal\" \"the expression of the Ideal to Sense,\" have done no more than he.  No one of these aesthetic systems, in spite of volumes of so-called application of their principles to works of art, has been able to furnish a criterion of beauty.  The criticism of the generations is summed up in the mild remark of Fechner, in his \"Vorschule der Aesthetik,\" to the effect that the philosophical path leaves one in conceptions that, by reason of their generality, do not well fit the particular cases.  And so it was that empirical aesthetics arose, which does not seek to answer those plain questions as to the enjoyment of concrete beauty down to its simplest forms, to which philosophical aesthetics had been inadequate.  But it is clear that neither has empirical aesthetics said the last word concerning beauty.  Criticism is still in a chaotic state that would be impossible if aesthetic theory were firmly grounded.  This situation appears to me to be due to the inherent inadequacy and inconclusiveness of empirical aesthetics when it stands alone; the grounds of this inadequacy I shall seek to establish in the following.  Granting that the aim of every aesthetics is to determine the Nature of Beauty, and to explain our feelings about it, we may say that the empirical treatments propose to do this either by describing the aesthetic object and extracting the essential elements of Beauty, or by describing the aesthetic experience and extracting the essential elements of aesthetic feeling, thereby indicating the elements of Beauty as those which effect this feeling.  Now the bare description and analysis of beautiful objects cannot, logically, yield any result; for the selection of cases would have to be arbitrary, and would be at the mercy of any objection.  To any one who should say, But this is not beautiful, and should not be included in your inventory, answer could be made only by showing that it had such and such qualities, the very, by hypothesis, unknown qualities that were to be sought.  Moreover, the field of beauty contains so many and so heterogeneous objects , that the retreat to their only common ground, aesthetic feeling, appears inevitable.  A statue and a symphony can be reduced to a common denominator most easily if the states of mind which they induce are compared.  Thus the analysis of objects passes naturally over to the analysis of mental states--the point of view of psychology.  There is, however, a method subsidiary to the preceding, which seeks the elements of Beauty in a study of the genesis and the development of art forms.  But this leaves the essential phenomenon absolutely untouched.  The general types of aesthetic expression may indeed have been shaped by social forces,-- religious, commercial, domestic,--but as social products, not as aesthetic phenomena.  Such studies reveal to us, as it were, the excuse for the fact of music, poetry, painting--but they tell us nothing of the reason why beautiful rather than ugly forms were chosen, as who should show that the bird sings to attract its mate, ignoring the relation and sequence of the notes.  The decorative art of most savage tribes, for instance, is nearly all of totemic origin, and the decayed and degraded forms of snake, bird, bear, fish, may be traced in the most apparently empty geometric patterns;--but what does this discovery tell us of the essentially decorative quality of such patterns or of the nature of beauty of form?  The study of the Gothic cathedral reveals the source of its general plan and of its whole scheme of ornament in detailed religious symbolism. Yet a complete knowledge of the character of the religious feeling which impelled to this monumental expression, and of the genesis of every element of structure, fails to account for the essential beauty of rhythm and proportion in the finished work.  These researches, in short, explain the reason for the existence, but not for the quality, of works of art.  Thus it is in psychology that empirical aesthetics finds its last resort.  And indeed, our plain man might say, the aesthetic experience itself is inescapable and undeniable. You know that the sight or the hearing of this thing gives you a thrill of pleasure.  You may not be able to defend the beauty of the object, but the fact of the experience you have. The psychologist, seeking to analyze the vivid and unmistakable Aesthetic experience, would therefore proceed somewhat as follows.  He would select the salient characteristics of his mental state in presence of a given work of art.  He would then study, by experiment and introspection, how the particular sense-stimulations of the work of art in question could become the psychological conditions of these salient characteristics. Thus, supposing the aesthetic experience to have been described as \"the conscious happiness in which one is absorbed, and, as it were, immersed in the sense-object,\"<1> the further special aim, in connection with a picture, for instance, would be to show how the sensations and associated ideas from color, line, composition, and all the other elements of a picture may, on general psychological principles, bring about this state of happy absorption.  Such elements as can be shown to have a direct relation to the aesthetic experience are then counted as elements of the beauty of the aesthetic object, and such as are invariable in all art forms would belong to the general formula or concept of Beauty.  <1> M.W. Calkins: An Introduction to Psychology, 1902, p. 278.  This, it seems to me, is as favorable a way as possible of stating the possibilities of an independent aesthetic psychology.  Yet this method, as it works out, does not exhaust the problem the solution of which was affirmed to be the aim of every aesthetics.  The aesthetic experience is very complex, and the theoretical consequences of emphasizing this or that element very great.  Thus, if it were held that the characteristics of the aesthetic experience could be given by the complete analysis of a single well-marked case,--say, our impressions before a Doric column, or the Cathedral of Chartres, or the Giorgione Venus,--it could be objected that for such a psychological experience the essential elements are hard to isolate.  The cathedral is stone rather than staff; it is three hundred rather than fifty feet high.  Our reaction upon these facts may or may not be essentials to the aesthetic moment, and we can know whether they are essentials only by comparison and exclusion.  It might be said, therefore, that the analysis of a single, though typical, aesthetic experience is insufficient; a wide induction is necessary.  Based on the experience of many people, in face of the same object?  But to many there would be no aesthetic experience.  On that of one person, over an extensive field of objects?  How, then, determine the limits of this field?  Half of the dispute of modern aesthetics is over the right to include in the material for this induction various kinds of enjoyment which are vivid, not directly utilitarian, but traditionally excluded from the field.  Guyan, for instance, in a charming passage of his \"Problemes de l'Esthetique Contemporaine,\" argues for the aesthetic quality of the moment when, exhausted by a long mountain tramp, he quaffed, among the slopes of the Pyrenees, a bowl of foaming milk.  The same dispute appears, in more complicated form, in the conflicting dicta of the critics.  If we do not know what part of our feeling is aesthetic feeling, how can wee go farther?  If the introspecting subject cannot say, This is aesthetic feeling, it is logically impossible to make his state of mind the basis for further advance.  It is clear that the great question is of what one has a right to include in the aesthetic experience.  But that one should have such a \"right\" implies that there is an imperative element in the situation, an absolute standard somewhere.  It seems to me that the secret of the difficulty lies in the nature of the situation, with which an empirical treatment must necessarily fail to deal. What we have called \"the aesthetic experience\" is really a positive toning of the general aesthetic attitude.  This positive toning corresponds to aesthetic excellence in the object.  But wherever the concept of excellence enters, there is always the implication of a standard, value, judgment.  But where there is a standard there is always an implicit a priori,--a philosophical foundation.  If, then, a philosophical method is the last resort and the first condition of a true aesthetics, what is the secret of its failure?  For that it has failed seems to be still the consensus of opinion.  Simply, I believe and maintain, the unreasonable and illogical demand which, for instance, Fechner makes in the words I have quoted, for just this immediate application of a philosophical definition to concrete cases.  Who but an Hegelian philosopher, cries Professor James, ever pretended that reason in action was per se a sufficient explanation of the political changes in Europe?  Who but an Hegelian philosopher, he might add, ever pretended that \"the expression of the Idea to Sense\" was a sufficient explanation of the Sistine Madonna?  But I think the Hegelian--or other--philosopher might answer that he had no need so to pretend.  Such a philosophical definition, as I hope to show, cannot possibly apply to particular cases, and should not be expected to do so.  Beauty is an excellence, a standard, a value.  But value is in its nature teleological; is of the nature of purpose. Anything ha value because it fulfills an end, because it is good for something in the world.  A thing is not beautiful because it has value,--other"]]]
