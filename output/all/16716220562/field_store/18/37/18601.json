The creaking of tackle announced that her crew were lowering one of the Berthon boats--and within four hundred yards of the Turkish batteries.  Yet for some reason the field-pieces did not open fire until Dick and the midshipman were picked up and were in the act of being transferred from the boat to the destroyer _Calder_.  Then, with a vivid and a sharp detonation, a shell burst a couple of hundred feet short of the British craft, quickly followed by another that missed by similar distance beyond.  Having revealed their identity, Dick and his companion were taken below and furnished with dry clothing.  Quickly the Sub returned on deck and approached the Lieutenant-Commander on the bridge.  \"Field-pieces lowered over the cliff, eh?\" ejaculated that officer. \"Jolly plucky of those fellows.  We're engaged in trying to draw their fire.  Sorry I can't put you on board the _Hammerer_.  The battleships and cruisers have withdrawn until the mine-field is cleared a little higher up.  They're going to tackle Chanak and Kilid Bahr to-morrow. We're just off to reconnoitre.  The _Calder's_ taking the European and the _Irwell_ is trying her luck on the Asiatic side.\"  \"Can I be of any service, sir?\"  \"I'm afraid not--as far as I can see at present.  We'll find room for you in the conning-tower.\"  The _Calder's_ search-lights had now been switched off.  She was steaming slowly in a northerly direction, and had already passed the innermost of the mine-sweepers and their attendant destroyers.  Dick entered the limited expanse of the conning-tower, in which was a Naval Reserve sub-lieutenant and two seamen.  The Lieutenant-Commander, called by courtesy the Captain, stood without on the bridge, in company with the mate and a yeoman of signals.  Presently the Lieutenant-Commander glanced at the luminous dial of his watch.  \"Time!\" he exclaimed decisively, in the tone of a referee at a boxing tournament.  \"Full speed ahead.\"  The engine-room telegraph-bell clanged.  Black smoke tinged with lurid red flames belched from the four squat funnels, and, like a hound released from leash, the _Calder_ raced on her perilous mission, her whole fabric quivering under the rapid pulsations of her engines.  The _Calder_ was not one of the latest type of destroyers.  Her tonnage was a little over 550, her speed supposed to be 24 knots, but by dint of terrific exertion on the part of her \"black squad\" that rate was considerably exceeded.  Almost everything depended on her pace.  She had to draw the fire from the hostile batteries.  If she were hit and sunk the British navy would be the poorer by the loss of a useful destroyer and a crew of seventy gallant men--and nothing would be gained except the glory of having died for their country.  If on the other hand the _Calder_ returned in safety, the British Admiral would be in possession of important information with reference to the position of new batteries that the Turks had thrown up to supplement those which were already known to be in existence.  Moreover, there had been a report that The Narrows had been obstructed by a boom in addition to rows of mines, and a verification of the information or otherwise was urgently required before further extensive operations could be conducted.  On and on the _Calder_ tore.  Now she was abreast of the powerful batteries of Tekeh and Escali.  Almost ahead, owing to the sinuosity of The Narrows, lay the huge fortress of Chanak.  Each of these positions mounted guns heavy enough to blow the frail destroyer clean out of the water, while there was known to be rows of deadly mines which might be anchored sufficiently far beneath the surface to allow a craft of the _Calder's_ draught to pass unscathed--but they might not.  It was facing death at every revolution of the propellers.  Yet for some unknown reason the Turks made no attempt to open fire.  It might be that they relied upon their mines, and were loath to disclose their positions by opening fire upon an insignificant destroyer.  If such were the case, it showed that the Ottoman had learned a new virtue--forbearance under provocation.  It was useless to suppose that the enemy had not spotted the swiftly-moving destroyer.  The flame-tinged smoke was enough.  Besides, she had already crossed the path of three powerful fixed search-lights that swept the entire width of the Dardanelles.  \"The beggars are going to spoof us,\" remarked the Naval Reserve officer to Dick.  \"We'll have our run for nothing.  I wish they'd do something.\"  Before Crosthwaite could reply, the whole of the European shore between Tekeh and Kilid Bahr seemed to be one blaze of vivid flashes.  Then, to the accompaniment of a continuous roar that would outvoice the clap of thunder, a hundred projectiles sped towards the daring British destroyer, some falling short, others bursting ahead and astern, while many flew harmlessly overhead.  Yet in all that tornado of shell the _Calder_ survived.  Although her funnels were riddled with fragments of the bursting missiles and a shell penetrated her wardroom, she sustained no vital damage.  Zigzagging like an eel, in order to baffle the Turkish gun-layers, she held grimly on her way, her skipper, standing coolly on the bridge, sweeping the shore with powerful night-glasses.  Fragments of metal rattled against the thin armour of the conning-tower.  Wafts of cordite drifted aft as the crew of the 4-inch on the foc'sle blazed away against the powerful shore batteries.  A dozen streams of smoke from the perforated funnels eddied aft in the strong breeze caused by the destroyer's speed, and rendered it impossible for the after 4-inch gun to be worked.  Making a complete circle the _Calder_ entered the belt of dense smoke previously thrown out by the funnels.  A lot depended upon this manoeuvre, for she was lost sight of by the Turkish gunners.  While they were congratulating themselves upon having sunk another of the Giaour's ships, the destroyer emerged from the bank of vapour, and in a position that necessitated an alteration in the sighting of the hostile guns.  It was grimly exciting, this game of dodging the fire of a hundred guns.  Without giving a thought to the fact that the conning-tower afforded little or no protection, Dick revelled in the situation, now that the first salvo had been fired.  Possibly the sight of the Lieutenant-Commander scorning to take shelter helped to steady Dick's nerves.  He felt as much at home on that frail craft, the plating of which was a little thicker than cardboard, as he did behind a heavy-armoured casemate of the _Hammerer_.  From both sides of the Dardanelles shells, large and small, hurtled through the air.  It seemed as if nothing could prevent the projectiles from Kilid Bahr and the adjacent batteries ricochetting into Chanak and the forts on the Asiatic shore.  Yet, hit many times, the _Calder_ held grimly and swiftly on her course till she came abreast of Nagara.  [Illustration: \"THE _CALDER_ HELD GRIMLY AND SWIFTLY ON HER WAY\"]  She had traversed the whole extent of The Narrows.  Mines she missed, possibly by a few feet.  More than once torpedoes, launched from the tubes mounted on the shore, tore past her, the trail of foam looming with a peculiar phosphorescence, showing how near they had been to getting home; while the shells that struck her, although inflicting considerable damage, failed to strike in any vital part.  Satisfied that no boom existed at Nagara, and that the Turkish cruisers and destroyers which were thought to have left the Sea of Marmora and had taken shelter beyond Nagara were not in their expected anchorage, the Lieutenant-Commander of the _Calder_ ordered the helm to be put hard over.  Listing outwardly as she turned till her normal water-line showed three feet above the water, the destroyer began her return journey.  Before she recovered her normal trim a 4-inch shell penetrated her thin plating, and, fortunately without exploding, missed one of the boilers by a fraction of an inch and disappeared out of the starboard side.  Then, as the destroyer steadied on her helm, the aperture a few seconds previously clear of the water was now eighteen inches beneath the surface.  It poured a regular cascade that threatened to flood the engine-room.  In an instant one of the artificers saw the danger and acted promptly. Seizing a bundle of oily waste he thrust it into the irregular-shaped hole, and coolly sat with his broad shoulders hard against the impromptu plug and kept it in position.  \"There's the _Irwell_,\" suddenly exclaimed the Royal Naval Reserve officer, who was looking through one of the slits in the conning-tower on the port side.  Dick also looked.  At two cables' length from them was their consort, which, having circled to starboard, had closed in upon the _Calder_. Both were now running on parallel courses and at approximately the same speed.  The _Calder's_ skipper also saw the other destroyer.  He realized the danger of the formation, for both craft were in a direct line of fire from the forts.  \"Hard-a-port!\" he shouted.  The quartermaster heard in spite of the terrific din.  Round spun the wheel of the steam steering-gear, and with a lurch that gave those below the impression that she was turning turtle, the destroyer made a complete circle.  By the time she had steadied on her helm the _Irwell_ was nearly a mile ahead.  A repetition of the terrible fire from Kum Kale greeted the _Calder_ as she tore past the southern-most of the forts, badly mauled but still in fighting trim.  Her exploit had been successfully accomplished.  \"Can anyone oblige me with a cigarette?\" asked the Lieutenant-Commander, as he was rejoined by the officers from the conning-tower.  The Royal Naval Reserve officer hastened to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37600"],["title","The Fight for Constantinople: A Story of the Gallipoli Peninsula (#8)"],["body","y.  \"Good heavens, sir!\" he exclaimed.  \"You've been hit.\"  \"Yes,\" assented the skipper coolly.  \"A piece of shell.  It's spoilt my greatcoat, I'm afraid, but what's worse, took my cigarette-case to blazes--and it was a presentation one, worse luck.  That's why I had to ask for something to smoke.  No, it isn't a case for the medico; a Maltese jeweller will do a bit of business over this affair, I think.\"  Handing over the charge of the bridge to the second in command, the skipper went below to receive the reports of the surgeon, the chief artificer-engineer, and the gunner as to the damage to personnel and hull and fittings.  This done he retired to his cabin--which was considerably draughty, owing to the attentions of a couple of Turkish shells which had passed completely through it without exploding--and proceeded to draft his report to the Admiral.  Presently Dick remembered that he had not seen anything of young Sefton during the dash up The Narrows.  Going in search of him, he found the midshipman busily engaged in helping the doctor, a surgeon probationer of the Royal Naval Reserve entered for service during the war.  There was plenty to be done, for the casualties amounted to four men seriously wounded and about a dozen others suffering from slight injuries.  \"Can't say I liked the job at first, sir,\" remarked the midshipman confidently, \"but the skipper told me to go below.  It felt absolutely rotten being boxed up without knowing what's going on.  One thing is certain: I'll take jolly good care not to specialize in engineering if I can help it.  I mean to go for the executive branch for all I'm worth.\"  \"You've made yourself pretty useful, I hear,\" said Crosthwaite, who had been told by the surgeon how the midshipman worked like a nigger.  \"I suppose so,\" admitted Sefton modestly.  \"When you're helping to patch up a man who has been horribly knocked about, you forget what's going on on deck.  Where are we now, sir?\"  \"Making for the fleet off Tenedos,\" replied the Sub.  \"We'll be put on board the old _Hammerer_ before another hour's up, unless something unforeseen occurs.  My word, the wind is piping up!  We're in for a good hard blow, I believe.\"  Without further incident the _Calder_ rejoined the rest of the squadron.  In answer to a signal a picket boat put off from the _Hammerer_ to take off the two missing officers, who parted from their rescuers with thanks and promises to restore their borrowed garments at the first available opportunity.  Next day it blew half a gale.  Under these climatic conditions operations were hopeless, and the fleet remained in the open roadstead, rolling heavily in the terrific seas.  In such weather even the steadiest ship would be unable to use her guns with any degree of accuracy, while it was equally certain that none of the Turkish mine-laying vessels could come out to drop fresh mines in the place of those already removed by the British trawlers.  But, on the other hand, the Ottoman land forces were not handicapped by the climatic conditions.  They were doubtless hard at work throwing up new trenches and batteries, and installing fresh guns from the apparently inexhaustible supply from the arsenals of their Teutonic taskmasters.  For three days it blew heavily, accompanied by a continuous deluge of rain.  The delay was galling, and increased the desire of the officers and men of the fleet to complete the good work that up to the present had progressed with every prospect of ultimate and speedy success.  \"What do you think of that for confounded cheek, Crosthwaite?\" asked Bourne, handing the Sub a typewritten document which contained news of the war that had been received by wireless and distributed amongst the fleet.  \"A Turkish bulletin with German editing requires a lot of swallowing.\"  Dick took the proffered paper and read:  \"The Dardanelles Operations.--Berlin reports that on Monday the Anglo-French fleet made a desperate attack upon the southern forts of the Gallipoli Peninsula.  In spite of a terrific artillery fire little damage was done to the forts.  A strong English landing-party was repulsed with heavy losses.\"  \"If they call our demolition party a strong force, I pity them when we do land a few army corps!\" remarked Bourne.  \"However, the more people are fooled the more bitter the grim realization.  Carry on.\"  \"The same evening a number of enemy light cruisers and destroyers attempted to ascend The Narrows,\" read Dick aloud, for the benefit of some of the midshipmen.  \"Three cruisers and at least six destroyers were observed to sink under the accurate fire of our Turkish allies. The Anglo-French fleet, apparently realizing the hopelessness of the operations, has dispersed.\"  \"To Tenedos, to pay another visit in a day or two,\" added Maynebrace. \"We'll be through in a fortnight.  And I believe the wind's dropping. The glass has been rising steadily for the last three hours.\"  The midshipman's prognostics were correct, for on the following morning the wind and sea had subsided considerably.  From the flagship a general signal was made.  Its meaning was greeted with an outburst of acclamation, for it was brief and to the point:  \"The fleet will weigh and engage at close range.\"     CHAPTER VI  To the Rescue  \"Another picnic!\" exclaimed Sefton joyfully, as the bugles sounded for \"Action Stations\".  \"Look--there's the French squadron piling it on. They are every bit as keen as we are to have a sniff in.\"  If anything, the opening phases of the bombardment were tamer than on the occasion of the last operations.  The combined fleets delivered a tremendous fire at gradually decreasing ranges, while the Turks gradually diminished the rapidity of their reply.  It was for the most part a gigantic waste of Krupp's ammunition, for very few of the British and French ships were hit.  Against the fortifications at the entrance to the Straits the battleships directed their fire, and at half-past one all the forts had ceased to reply to the salvoes of the Allied ships.  Meanwhile the _Hammerer_ and her consorts had penetrated a considerable distance up the Dardanelles.  Here they gave and received hard knocks, for the range averaged only two thousand yards.  Several gaping holes appeared in the unarmoured portions of the _Hammerer's_ hull, her funnels were torn through and through, her after-bridge had been swept away, and almost every boat she carried was splintered.  Yet her crew, well protected by the armoured barbettes and casemates, and the broad nine-inch belt extending two-thirds of her length, suffered little loss; and when at half-past two the _Vengeance_, _Irresistible_, _Albion_, _Swiftsure_, _Ocean_, and _Majestic_ steamed up to assist in the bombardment, the forts quickly ceased firing.  During the lull in the firing Dick Crosthwaite had to go on deck to superintend the clearing away of some of the remains of the after-bridge, which interfered with the training of the starboard 6-inch gun.  As he did so he saw the _Irresistible_ listing heavily.  Whether mortally injured by gun-fire, torpedo, or mine, he knew not at the time, but it was certain that she was done for.  An attempt was being made to take her in tow, but already the stanch old craft was heeling too much.  Seeing the plight of the battleship, the Turks again opened fire, sending a hail of projectiles at the stricken ship.  Her consorts attempted to intervene and screen her from the harassing storm of shell, for her devoted crew, working hard in a vain effort to check the inrush of water by means of collision mats, were fully exposed to the fire of the Turkish guns.  Reluctantly the order was given to abandon ship, and in response to signals for assistance British destroyers dashed up, and, manoeuvring with the utmost skill and coolness under the galling fire, actually ran alongside the fast-sinking vessel.  Most of the _Irresistible's_ crew succeeded in leaping upon the decks of the destroyers; a few had to take to the water, and were promptly hauled out by ready helpers.  The rescuers were only just in time, for, amid a cloud of smoke and steam, the ship sank in deep water.  The catastrophe was not the only one, for within a very few minutes after the sinking of the _Irresistible_, the _Ocean_, a slightly larger battleship, having struck a mine, sank, with very little loss of life.  It was a black day for the Allies, for the French had not come off without serious losses.  The _Bouvet_, fouling a mine, the detonation of which caused her principal magazine to explode, sank with appalling suddenness, taking with her practically the whole of the crew.  The _Gaulois_, badly mauled by gun-fire, was obliged to haul out of line, and it was rumoured that she had to be beached on the island of Imbros.  A new and hitherto unexpected danger had threatened the British and French battleships--a danger against which ordinary mine-sweeping was impracticable.  Owing to the continual current down the Dardanelles, it occurred to the minds of the German officers serving with the Turkish forces to set adrift numbers of floating mines.  These formidable engines of destruction were launched from the southern outlet of the Sea of Marmora, while to make the chances of their fouling a ship doubly certain they were released in pairs, each couple being connected by fifty or a hundred feet of wire.  The bight of the wire getting caught across the bows of a ship would result in the mines swinging inwards and exploding upon contact with the vessel's sides.  Wisely the British Admiral ordered a retirement, until steps could be taken to cope with this latest scheme of defence on the part of the enemy, and as night fell the fleet steamed towards its anchorage.  The weather was now beginning to change back to a spell of hard winds and rain, which in itself would cause a temporary suspension of operations, and the officers and men of the fleet had to face the dismal prospect of \"standing by\" instead of returning to the"]]]
