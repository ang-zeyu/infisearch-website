Season with grated onion, pepper and salt, and a little butter, and heat thoroughly. A green pepper, shredded, is an invaluable addition to corned beef hash.   CORNED BEEF HASH À LA DELMONICO  Prepare as above, using the green pepper. Spread the hot hash thickly on thin slices of buttered toast, slip a poached egg on to each piece, sprinkle with pepper, salt, and minced parsley.   CREAMED DRIED BEEF  Prepare as directed for Frizzled Beef, having the beef cut into very small pieces. Make a cream sauce of one tablespoonful of butter, two tablespoonfuls of flour, and two cupfuls of milk. Season with salt and pepper, and when smooth and thick add the cooked beef. A well-beaten egg added just before taking from the fire is an improvement. Serve on toast.   BACON AND EGGS  Have the bacon cut very thin. The colder it is, the better. Remove the rind and cook in a hot frying-pan until crisp. Skim out the bacon, break the eggs into the fat one at a time, and cook slowly, dipping the fat over the eggs occasionally with a spoon. Eggs must always be cooked at a moderate temperature. Serve on a hot platter, the eggs in the centre, the bacon for a garnish.   BROILED BACON  Broil on a gridiron, turning constantly. It will cook in three minutes. Perfectly cooked bacon is clear and crisp.   BREADED BACON  Dip slices of bacon in corn-meal and broil or fry. A Southern method.   BACON AND MUSH  Cut slices of cold corn-meal mush, dredge in flour, and fry brown. Serve with a strip of fried or broiled bacon on each slice.   BACON FRAISE  Make a batter of four eggs, half a cupful of milk, and a teaspoonful of flour. Fry some thin slices of bacon till transparent. Dip them in the batter, spread on a stoneware platter, cover with the remaining batter, and put into a moderate oven till a golden brown.   BACON À LA CRÊME  Fry thin slices of bacon as usual, place on a platter, and put into the oven to keep warm. Make a cream sauce, using the fat in the pan instead of butter. Pour over the bacon, sprinkle with minced parsley, and serve at once.   CALF'S BRAINS  Soak in cold water, parboil, remove pipes and membranes, throw into cold water, drain, wipe, and keep cool. They may be rubbed with melted butter and fried or broiled, or dipped in egg and crumbs and fried or broiled. Serve with a cream sauce or with a sauce of melted butter, lemon-juice, and minced parsley.   CHICKEN HASH  Use cold cooked chicken and proceed according to directions previously given. Cold turkey or tongue makes delicious hash. A shredded green pepper will usually improve it. Any hash may be served on toast with a poached egg on each slice.   FRIED HAM  Freshen a slice of ham a few moments in boiling water. Drain, wipe, and fry slowly. Eggs may be served with it. See Bacon and Eggs.   FRIZZLED HAM  Prepare as above. When the ham is half done, sprinkle with flour and fry brown. When brown, add a tablespoonful of made mustard to the gravy, and boiling water enough to cover the ham. Simmer five minutes and serve on a hot platter.   HAM AND POACHED EGGS  Prepare as directed above. Poach the eggs separately and serve on the slices of ham.   BROILED HAM  Freshen in cold water, drain, wipe, and broil. May be breaded and broiled on a buttered gridiron.   HAM BALLS  One cupful of cooked ham, finely chopped, one cupful of bread crumbs, two cupfuls of cooked potatoes, mashed fine, a heaping tablespoonful of butter, two eggs, and a dash of cayenne. Melt the butter and beat all together until very light. Shape into small flat cakes, dip in egg and crumbs, and fry brown. May be prepared beforehand.   HAM TOAST  Half a cupful of cold cooked ham, finely minced, half a teaspoonful of anchovy paste, a bit of cayenne and pounded mace. Add half a cupful of milk and an egg, well beaten. Stir till thick, take from the fire, and spread thinly on dry buttered toast. A poached egg may be placed on each slice.   HAM RÉCHAUFFÉ  Butter individual custard cups, fill three fourths full of minced ham reheated in a cream sauce, break an egg into each cup, sprinkle with crumbs, dot with butter, and bake till the egg is set. Tongue, chicken, turkey, or other meats may be used in this same way.   HAM AND EGGS À L'AURORE  Mince cooked ham and reheat in a cream sauce, to which the shredded whites of hard-boiled eggs have been added. Spread on buttered toast and sprinkle with the sifted yolks of the eggs, rubbed through a sieve.   KIDNEY BACON ROLLS  Season a cupful of bread crumbs with grated onion, salt and pepper, and minced parsley. Moisten with egg well beaten. Spread the crumb mixture over thin slices of bacon and wrap each slice of bacon around a small kidney. Fasten with toothpicks or skewers. Put in a baking-pan and bake in a hot oven until the bacon is crisp. Remove the skewers and serve on a hot plate, garnished with parsley.   FRIED KIDNEYS  Cut in halves, skin, sprinkle with salt and red pepper, and fry one minute in a spider, with no additional fat. Serve with dry toast.   KIDNEYS EN BROCHETTE  Cut the kidneys into small squares after parboiling and skinning. String on small steel skewers with small squares of bacon alternating. Broil or fry or cook in the oven, dredging with flour or not, as preferred. If the bacon is not very fat, soak the kidneys in olive oil a few moments before stringing. Serve on the skewers.   CRUMBED KIDNEYS  Parboil, drain, wipe, and split the kidneys, keeping them open with skewers. Season with pepper and salt, brush with oil, roll in crumbs, and broil, fry, or cook in a very hot oven. Make a sauce of melted butter, lemon-juice, and minced parsley, and pour over them if desired.   DEVILLED KIDNEYS  Parboil, drain, wipe, and slice the kidneys. Make a marinade of three tablespoonfuls of olive-oil, one of vinegar,--tarragon vinegar or lemon-juice may be used,--a teaspoonful of mustard, salt, and red pepper. Dip the sliced kidneys in this dressing and broil. Minced parsley is a pleasant addition to the marinade. After dipping in the dressing, they may be rolled in crumbs and fried. Serve plain, or with a sauce of melted butter, lemon-juice, and minced parsley, or with the remaining marinade heated and poured over the kidneys.   KIDNEY AND BACON  Parboil and slice mutton or lamb kidneys. Fry brown in bacon fat and serve on dry toast with the bacon.   STEWED BEEF KIDNEY  Parboil, drain, wipe, and cut into dice. Cook five minutes in boiling water, drain, add a small onion, grated, a pinch of sage, and a cup of water. Bring to the boil once more, add a pinch of salt, and two hard-boiled eggs, cut fine. Thicken with one tablespoonful of cornstarch, rubbed smooth in a little cold water. Serve on toast.   KIDNEYS À LA TERRAPIN  Parboil, drain, wipe, and cut into dice. Reheat in cream sauce, to which hard-boiled eggs, cut fine, and minced parsley are added. Serve on toast.   BROILED KIDNEYS--MAÎTRE D'HÔTEL  Use veal or lamb kidneys. Plunge for an instant into boiling water, skim out, and wipe dry. Split down the middle without cutting through, skin, and run a skewer through each to keep flat. Broil as usual. When brown, remove the skewers, lay on a hot platter, pour over melted butter, add a squeeze of lemon-juice, and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Kidneys and liver must be cooked very quickly, as long cooking makes them tough.   MINCED LAMB WITH POACHED EGGS  Chop cold roast lamb very fine. Season with salt, pepper, and a bit of mint. Reheat in the gravy, or in water, adding a little butter, or in a cream sauce. Spread thinly on thin slices of dry buttered toast, slip a poached egg on each slice, and serve at once, sprinkled with pepper and minced parsley.   BROILED LAMB'S LIVER  Cut the liver in thin slices, cover with olive oil, and soak half an hour. Drain, season with salt and pepper, dip in crumbs, and broil. Finish as for Broiled Kidneys.   CALF'S LIVER AND BACON  Cook the bacon first, skim out, and put the slices of liver, dredged with flour and seasoned with salt, into the hot fat. Cook very quickly.   LIVER À LA CRÊME  Parboil calf's liver, drain, wipe, and cut into dice or chop coarsely. Reheat in a cream sauce, seasoning with salt and pepper. Minced parsley, lemon-juice, or finely cut capers may be added to the sauce. Serve on toast. Cold cooked liver may be used in this way.   LIVER HASH  Equal parts of cold cooked liver and cold potatoes, cut fine. Reheat in a frying-pan, adding butter and boiling water as necessary. Almost any cold cooked meat may be used in this way.   BAKED HASH  Butter a shallow baking-dish, pile in the hash loosely, smooth the top, dot with butter, and bake until brown and crisp. Turn out on a platter or serve in the dish, a fresh napkin or a paper frill being arranged around the dish.   LIVER BOULETTES  Chop cold cooked liver fine. Reheat in a very thick cream sauce, well seasoned. Cool, shape into small flat cakes, dip in egg and crumbs, and fry brown.   LIVER AND BACON BALLS  Cold cooked liver cut fine and half as much cooked bacon, chopped. Shape into small flat cakes, using a raw egg to bind if necessary. Dip in egg and crumbs and fry brown.   MEAT AND RICE BALLS  One cupful of cold cooked rice, one cupful of finely chopped cooked meat,--any kind, or several kinds,--a pinch of salt, a dash of pepper, two tablespoonfuls of butter, half a cupful of milk, and one egg. Put the milk on to boil, add the rice, meat, and seasoning. When it boils, add the egg, well beaten, and stir one minute. Take from the fire, cool, form into small flat cakes, dip in egg and crumbs, and fry brown. May be prepared the day before using.   FRIED SALT PORK  Cut in thin slices, freshen in cold water gradually brought to the boil. Drain, wipe, trim off the rind, roll in flour, and fry. When brown, put on a hot platter and make a cream sauce, using the fat in the pan. Fried salt pork with cream sauce poured over it is a venerable New England dish of some"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37687"],["title","The Cruise of the Land-Yacht \"Wanderer\"; or, Thirteen Hundred Miles in my (#0)"],["body","Cruise of the Land-Yacht \"Wanderer\" Thirteen Hundred Miles in my Caravan By Gordon Stables Published by Hodder and Stoughton, 27 Paternoster Row, London.

PREFACE.  I need, I believe, do little more herein, than state that the following pages were written on the road, on the _coupe_ of my caravan, and from day to day.  First impressions, it must be admitted, are not always infallible, but they are ever fresh.  I have written from my heart, as I saw and thought; and I shall consider myself most fortunate and happy if I succeed in making the reader think in a measure as I thought, and feel as I felt.  It is but right to state that many of the chapters have appeared in _The Leisure Hour_.  Some of the illustrations are from photographs kindly lent me by Messrs. Valentine and Sons, of Dundee; others from rough sketches of my own; while the frontispiece, \"Waiting till the Kettle Boils,\" is by Mr Eales, of Twyford.  Gordon Stables.  The \"Wanderer\" Caravan, Touring in Yorkshire, _August_ 1886.  CHAPTER ONE.  INTRODUCTORY--WRITTEN BEFORE STARTING.  No man who cannot live in his house on wheels, cook, eat, and sleep in, on, or under it, can say that he is cut out for a gipsy life.  But to do this you require to have your temporary home well arranged--a perfect _multum in parvo_, a _domus in minima_.  The chief faults of the old-fashioned caravan are want of space--two ordinary-sized adults can hardly move in it without trampling on each other's toes--general stuffiness, heat from sky or stove, or probably both combined, and a most disagreeable motion when on the road.  This latter is caused by want of good springs, and errors in the general build.  \"The man who is master of a caravan,\" says a writer, \"enjoys that perfect freedom which is denied to the tourist, whose movements are governed by the time-table.  He can go where he likes, stop when he lists, go to bed at the hour which suits him best, or get up or lie daydreaming, knowing there is not a train to catch nor a waiter's convenience to consult.  If the neighbourhood does not suit the van-dweller, all he has to do is to hitch in the horses and move to more eligible quarters.  The door of his hotel is always open.  There is no bill to pay nor anybody to `remember;' and, if the accommodation has been limited, the lodger cannot complain of the charges.  In a caravan one has all the privacy of a private residence, with the convenience of being able to wheel it about with a facility denied to the western settler, who shifts his `shanty' from the `lot' which he has leased to the more distant one which he has bought.  In the van may, for all the passer-by can discover, be a library and drawing-room combined, or it may be bedroom and dining-room in one, though, as the pioneers in this mode of touring sleep under canvas, we may presume that they find the accommodation indoors a little stuffy.\"  Now, this sounds very well, but at the present sitting I have my doubts if a gipsy's--even a gentle-man-gipsy's--life be altogether as independent and sunshiny as the sentences represent them to be.  About going where he likes, for instance?  Are there not certain laws of the road that forbid the tarrying by the way of caravan folks, for a longer period than that necessary to water and feed a horse or look at his feet?  By night, again, he may spy a delightfully retired common, with nothing thereon, perhaps, except a flock of gabbling geese and a superannuated cart-horse, and be tempted to draw up and on it, but may not some duty-bound police man stroll quietly up, and order him to put-to and \"move on?\"  Again, if the neighbourhood does not suit, then the caravan-master may certainly go elsewhere, _if_ the horses be not too tired or dead lame.  To be sure, there is inside a caravan all the privacy to be desired; but immediately outside, especially if drawn up on a village common, it may be noisy enough.  As regards going to bed and getting up when he pleases, the owner of a caravan is his own master, unless he chooses to carry the ideas and customs of a too-civilised life into the heart of the green country with him, and keep plenty of company.  Methinks a gentleman gipsy ought to have a little of the hermit about him.  If he does not love nature and quiet and retirement, he is unsuited for a caravan life, unless, indeed, he would like to make every day a gala day, and the whole tour a round of pleasurable excitement--in other words, a _farce_.  It is, however, my impression at the present moment that the kind of life I trust to lead for many months to come, might be followed by hundreds who are fond of a quiet and somewhat romantic existence, and especially by those whose health requires bracing up, having sunk below par from overwork, overworry, or over much pleasure-seeking, in the reckless way it is the fashion to seek it.  Only as yet I can say nothing from actual experience.  I have to _go_ on, the reader has to _read_ on, ere the riddle be solved to our mutual satisfaction.  CHAPTER TWO.  THE CARAVAN ITSELF--FIRST TRIALS--GETTING HORSED.    \"A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!\"  Travelling through the romantic little village of Great Marlow one summer's day in a pony-trap, I came suddenly on a row of caravans drawn up on the roadside.  Some flying swings were started just as I approached, and the unwonted sight, with the wild whooping and noise, startled my horse.  He shied, and made a rather thoughtless but very determined attempt to enter a draper's shop.  This resulted in damage enough to the trap to necessitate my staying an hour or two for repairs.  I would have a look at the caravans, at all events.  There was one very pretty little one, and, seeing me admire it, the owner, who stood by, kindly asked if I cared to look inside.  I thanked him, and followed him up the steps.  It proved to be a good thing of the class, but inside the space was limited, owing to the extraordinary breadth of the bed and size of the stove.  I asked the address of the builder, however, and wrote to him for an estimate.  This was sent, but the penmanship and diction in which it was couched sent no thrill of pleasure through me.  Here is a sentence: \"Wich i can build you a wagon as ill cary you anyweres with 1 orse for eity pounds, i 'as built a power o' pretty wagons for gipsies, an' can refer you to lots on 'em for reference.\"  Well, to be sure, there is no necessity for a builder of caravans being a classical scholar, but there was a sad absence of romance about this letter; the very word \"wagon\" was not in itself poetic.  Why could not the man have said \"caravan\"?  I determined to consult a dear old friend of mine who knows everything, C.A. Wheeler, to wit (the clever author of \"Sportascrapiana.\")  Why, he said in reply, did not I go straight to the Bristol Waggon Company?  They would do the thing well, at all events, and build my caravan from my own drawings.  This was good advice.  So I got a few sheets of foolscap and made a few rough sketches, and thought and planned for a night or two, and thus the Wanderer came into existence--on paper.  Now that the caravan is built and fitted she is so generally admired by friends and visitors, that I may be forgiven for believing that a short description of her may prove not uninteresting to the general reader.  Let us walk round her first and foremost and view the exterior.  A glance will show you (see illustration) that The Saloon Caravan \"Wanderer\" is by no means of small dimensions.  From stem to stern, without shafts or pole, she measures nearly twenty feet, her height from the ground being about eleven feet, and her breadth inside six feet fully.  For so long a carriage you will naturally say the wheels seem low.  This is true; the hind wheels are little over four feet, but they are _under_ the carriage.  Had they been tall they must have protruded beyond her considerably, and this would have given the Wanderer a breadth of beam which would have been awkward on the road, and rendered it impossible to get her through many gateways.  I might have had a semicircle or hollow in the sides of the caravan, in which high wheels could have moved without entailing a broader beam, but this would have curtailed the floor space in the after-cabin, on which my valet has to sleep athwartships, and this arrangement was therefore out of the question.  But she must be very heavy?  Not for her size and strength.  Although solid mahogany all round outside and lined with softer wood, she scaled at Bristol but 30 hundredweight, and loaded-up she will be under two tons.  The loading-up includes master, valet, coachman, and a large Newfoundland dog, not one of whom need be inside except \"coachee\" on a stiff hill.  Obeying my instructions, then, the builders made her as light as was consistent with strength.  The wood too is of the best and best seasoned that could be had.  A firm that builds Pullman cars, not only for England but for America, has always a good supply of old wood on hand.  But if the Wanderer does not look light she certainly looks elegant. Polished mahogany with black and gold mouldings and shutters-- jalousies--leaves little to be longed for as regards outside show, neither does it give a gay appearance.  The wheels and underworks are dark chocolate, picked out with vermilion.  The only \"ornament\" about her is the device on the side, and this is simply a sketch of the badge of my uniform cap--crown, anchor, and laurel leaves,--with a scroll of ribbon of the Robertson tartan, my mother's plaid.  This looks quite as pretty and costs less than armorial bearings.  In the illustration the fore part of the caravan is visible.  There is a splashboard, an"]]]
