From _B. kolbi_, _B. rexroadi_ differs in: over-all size of mandibular ramus, incisors, and molars smaller; anterior median fold of m1 present, though poorly developed.  From _B. brachygnathus_, _B. rexroadi_ differs in: over-all size of mandibular ramus smaller; m3 larger; posterior cusps (hypoconid and entoconid) elongated; diastema shorter, less acutely recurved; incisors less proödont; cingular ridges of m1 and m2 less well-developed.  From _B. musculus_, _B. rexroadi_ differs in: over-all size of mandibular ramus less; cingular ridges of m1 and m2 less well-developed; incisors smaller, more proödont; molars less depressed.  From _B. taylori_, _B. rexroadi_ differs in: m3 more triangular, posterior part narrower; mental foramen closer to anterior root of m1; masseteric ridge closer to alveolus of m1; incisor shorter, more proödont; molars more depressed.  _Remarks._--Two maxillary tooth-rows and associated parts were studied. On one of these specimens, the M2 has a well-developed mesostyle; the anterior median fold of M1 is also well-developed. The other specimen possesses a low cingular ridge (enteroloph) between the protocone and the hypocone, a reduced cingular ridge (mesoloph) between the paracone and metacone of M1. On the second molar, M2, a mesostyle joins with the mesoloph somewhat in the fashion indicated by Hooper (1957:9, encircled number 2).   =Baiomys kolbi= Hibbard      _Baiomys kolbi_ Hibbard, Trans.

From _B. brachygnathus_, _B. kolbi_ differs in: molar row longer; m3 and jaw larger; diastema longer; masseteric ridge not so far forward; molars more depressed.  From _B. minimus_, _B. kolbi_ differs in: molar row longer; m3 larger; jaw larger; diastema not so acutely curved; incisor shorter, narrower transversely, more proödont.  From _B. musculus_, _B. kolbi_ differs in: anterior median fold of m1 slightly developed or absent, instead of well-developed; m3 larger (not reduced), external reëntrant valley broad and extending farther across crown of tooth; incisor smaller, and more proödont; cingular ridges of m1 and m2 less well-developed.  From _B. taylori_, _B. kolbi_ differs in: molars larger, more depressed; incisor shorter, more proödont; m3 smaller relative to m1 and m2; external reëntrant valley of m3 broad, extending farther across crown of tooth.  _Remarks._--The slight development or absence of the anterior median fold in _kolbi_ suggests that it was specialized. The anterior median fold is well-developed in all species of _Baiomys_ save _B. brachygnathus_ and _B. taylori_, in which the fold is only slightly developed or absent. _B. kolbi_ may have paralleled _B. taylori_ in specialization for a diet of grasses and for a life in open country.   =Baiomys brachygnathus= (Gidley)      _Peromyscus brachygnathus_ Gidley, U.

From _B. minimus_, _B. brachygnathus_ differs in: jaw not so slender anteriorly; masseteric ridge not so far anterior; cheek-teeth slightly broader, less depressed, therefore, more hypsodont; incisor shorter, more proödont.  From _B. sawrockensis_, _B. brachygnathus_ differs in: molar row slightly longer; teeth slightly less depressed; masseteric ridge extends farther anteriorly; incisors more proödont.  From _B. musculus_, _B. brachygnathus_ differs in: jaw smaller; molar row slightly shorter; molars less depressed; incisors slender, shorter, narrower, and more proödont.  From _B. taylori_, _B. brachygnathus_ differs in: incisor more slender, shorter, more proödont; diastema shorter.  _Remarks._--The molar teeth of _B. brachygnathus_, although worn, resemble those of _B. taylori_ more than those of any known fossil species. Gidley (1922:124) stated that the absence of the divided anterior lobe of the first molar (anterior median fold) in _brachygnathus_ was one of the chief characters separating _brachygnathus_ from _taylori_. In _taylori_, the anterior median fold characteristically is only slightly developed, and in some specimens is absent. _B. brachygnathus_ differs from _taylori_ chiefly in proödont incisors, which feature seems to preclude _brachygnathus_ being ancestral to _taylori_. _B. brachygnathus_ may have been a specialized divergence from _B. minimus_.   =Baiomys minimus= (Gidley)      _Peromyscus minimus_ Gidley, U.

From _B. rexroadi_, _B. minimus_ differs in: anterior median fold deeper; incisor longer, more recurved, less proödont; molars slightly more depressed (though worn).  From _B. musculus_, _B. minimus_ differs in: over-all size of jaw and molars smaller; incisors shorter; masseteric ridge more depressed.  From _B. taylori_, _B. minimus_ differs in: anterior median fold slightly deeper; molar teeth more depressed; cingular ridges on m1 and m2 better developed; masseteric ridge more depressed.  _Remarks._--Gidley (1922:124) stated that _B. minimus_ differed considerably from _B. taylori_ in that the coronoid portion of the ascending ramus diverges at a wider angle from the alveolar part of the jaw. Study of large samples of lower jaws of _B. taylori_ reveals considerable individual variation in the angle formed between the coronoid part of the jaw and the alveolar part.  _B. minimus_, except for its small size, is like _B. musculus_ and is considered to be ancestral to that species.     PHYLETIC TRENDS   It seems that the important trends in phyletic development in the pygmy mice have been from an ancestral stock (see Figure 3) that possessed relatively brachydont teeth having raised cingular ridges (ectolophids and mesolophids) and relatively short orthodont to proödont incisors, to species having teeth more hypsodont on which cingular ridges were reduced, stylids were isolated or completely absent, and incisors were longer and more recurved or retrodont. _Baiomys sawrockensis_, or an unknown stock resembling it, might have been ancestral to the other known species. Of the four remaining fossil species, _B. kolbi_ seems least likely to have been ancestral to the two living species, owing to its proödont incisors, reduction of cingular ridges, loss of an anterior median fold in m1, and long mandibular tooth-row. _B. kolbi_ may have been an early, specialized derivation from the ancestral stock. From his knowledge of the habitats of _B. musculus_, the larger species, and _B. taylori_, the smaller species, Hibbard (1952:203) suggests that _B. kolbi_, a large species, might have inhabited lowlands, and _B. rexroadi_, a small species, highlands. I have no evidence to dispute this suggestion except that _B. musculus_ has more prominent cingular ridges (or at least vestiges of this lophid condition) than either _B. kolbi_ or _B. rexroadi_. _B. musculus_ (see page 610) is less of an open grassland inhabitant than is _B. taylori_. Therefore, both _B. kolbi_ and _B. rexroadi_, because of their poorly developed cingular ridges, might be expected to have lived in a relatively open grassland habitat.  The relationship of _B. rexroadi_ to fossil species other than _B. kolbi_ is not clear."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38290"],["title","Speciation and Evolution of the Pygmy Mice, Genus Baiomys (#3)"],["body","erficially, the former resembles _B. taylori_, but, owing to the specialized development of the molars of _rexroadi_, it could hardly have been ancestral to either of the living species. The resemblance of _B. rexroadi_ to _B. taylori_ may result from each having occupied the same ecological niche in different periods. The incisors of _B. rexroadi_, however, are much shorter than those of _B. taylori_ and suggest somewhat different food habits.  _B. minimus_ seemingly is more closely related to _B. sawrockensis_ and _B. musculus_ than to the other described species. The development of the cingular ridges leads one to suspect that _B. minimus_ was the ancestor of _B. musculus_. _B. minimus_ may have been derived from a _sawrockensis_-like stock and probably gave rise to _B. musculus_.  Hershkovitz (1955:643-644) suggests that \"... primitive brachydont, buno-mesolophodont cricetines have survived ... in forested parts of the range,\" whereas \"... the progressive branch of cricetines with mesoloph absent or vestigal, has become increasingly specialized for life in open country and a diet of grasses.\" Species of the genus _Baiomys_ can be divided into two morphological groups. One group, composed of _B. sawrockensis_, _B. minimus_, and _B. musculus_, includes those species, the teeth of which were relatively brachydont and had prominently developed cingular ridges (ectolophids or mesolophids) or, at least, showed some development of these ridges. _B. sawrockensis_ probably lived in semi-wooded to shrubby habitats. According to Hibbard (1953:409), \"The Saw Rock Canyon fauna lived in that area at a time when conditions were comparable to the conditions at the time the Rexroad fauna lived.\" The conditions in which the Rexroad fauna lived are discussed by Hibbard (1941:95). Presumably, there were at least some well-wooded situations, and the climate was warm. _B. sawrockensis_ probably inhabited denser vegetation than did _B. minimus_ or than does _B. musculus_. The teeth of the second group (_B. kolbi_, _B. rexroadi_, _B. brachygnathus_, and _B. taylori_) lack cingular ridges or have them much reduced and have more hypsodont molars. The three fossil species probably inhabited relatively open grassland. This assumption is based largely on the known habitat of _B. taylori_ (see page 632).  The suggested grouping, based on supposed similarities in niches inhabited by the extinct species, does not necessarily indicate degree of relationship. _B. taylori_ probably was not derived from an ancestor like _B. rexroadi_ or _B. kolbi_, although, in certain characters, the three species resemble one another. _B. kolbi_ and _B. rexroadi_ were already specialized in Blancan times, probably for living on grassland. _B. taylori_ shows only a slight advance in specialization of molar structures compared to either of the aforementioned species but is slightly smaller and does have longer and more recurved incisors. If only morphological criteria of lower jaws were considered, without recourse to other data derived from the study of many samples of populations of the living species, time alone might account for the differences among _B. taylori_, _B. rexroadi_, and _B. kolbi_. The available evidence (see page 658) suggests, however, that _B. taylori_ was derived from the _B. sawrockensis_-_B. minimus_-_B. musculus_ line.      [Illustration: FIG. 3. Diagram indicating probable relationships        of living and extinct species of pygmy mice.]  _Baiomys_ seems to have undergone little basic evolutionary and morphological change since Late Pliocene time. According to Simpson (1945:207), hesperomine rodents as a group have undergone little basic evolution, and \"The rapid evolution of new genera was more a matter of segregation of characters in a group with a great variation than of the origin of significantly new characters.\" Perhaps, the living southern pygmy mouse retains many basic characteristics of one of the early North American cricetine-like stocks that emigrated to South America near the end of the Pliocene epoch. There is much to suggest close relationship of the pygmy mice to certain species of South American hesperomine rodents of the genus _Calomys_.     NON-GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION   Non-geographic variation in pygmy mice (variation in a single population resulting from age, individual, seasonal, and secondary sexual differences) has been but little studied in the past. Mearns (1907:381) figured progressive stages of wear on the teeth of _B. taylori_; Osgood (1909:252) and Blair (1941:380) referred to changes in dentition, weights, and pelages.  The largest samples available for this study were 47 _B. taylori_ from the vicinity of Altamira (6 mi. N, 6 mi. W; 5 mi. N, 5 mi. W; 1 mi. S), Tamaulipas, and 44 _B. musculus_ from El Salvador (1 mi. S Los Planes, and 1 mi. NW San Salvador--two localities 3 miles apart).   VARIATION WITH AGE  Specimens of both species were segregated into five categories: Juveniles, young, subadults, adults, and old adults. Juvenal and young pygmy mice are readily separable from the other three categories; subadults are less easily distinguished from adults. In order to obtain an accurate understanding of geographic variation in these mice, only adults should be used in making taxonomic comparisons.  _Juveniles._--Nestling mice yet unweaned; sutures in cranium incompletely closed; bony parts of skull fragile; M3 and m3 not erupted or only partly erupted and not protruding above margins of alveoli.  At birth, juveniles are pink, without pelage except for the mystacial vibrissae and a few hairs about the eye. Blair (_op. cit._:381) recorded changes with age in color of the skin of new-born and suckling pygmy mice. Data obtained by me from three litters born in captivity agree with his findings. Pygmy mice are weaned when 17 to 24 days old. At that time, the mice possess a fine, but not dense, dusky-gray fur.  _Young._--Weaned mice; cranium fragile; sutures between frontals and parietals, interparietal and parietals, basioccipital and basisphenoid, basisphenoid and presphenoid, premaxillaries and maxillaries widely open; M3 and m3 erupted beyond margins of their alveoli (molars erupt from anterior to posterior; M3 and m3, therefore, are last to erupt); in some specimens, molars slightly worn; pelage still dusky and relatively fine and sparse.  _Subadults._--Sutures between bones of skull less widely open than in young; epiphyses of long bones incompletely coalesced to shaft; relative to length of skull, braincase higher and rostrum shorter than in adults; all cusps worn, but dentine not occlusally confluent; primary first and second folds of third upper molars present; primary first fold and major fold of lower molars visible; pelage a subtle mixture of colors of young and adult, but resembling most that of adult; molts into postjuvenal pelage between 46 and 50 days.  _Adults._--Sutures of skull, and those between epiphyses and shaft of long bones obliterated except that, in some mice, sutures of skull persist between frontoparietal, and interparietal; cusps of molars so worn that dentine occlusally confluent; small island of enamel in third upper and lower molars of some specimens; relative to length of skull, cranium lower, rostrum longer, and interorbital region narrower than in subadult; cranium appears to be more flattened dorsoventrally; between subadult and adult stages, principal growth occurs in basioccipital, basisphenoid, frontals, and parietals; nasals grow less.  Although all bones of the skull grow in the subadult and early adult stages (see table 1), the above-named bones grow faster than others and thus cause the general flattening of the skull, typical of adults (similar to that reported by Hoffmeister, 1951:7). The body continues to lengthen, accounting for the increase in total length of the adult (see table 1). Hind foot, tail and ear, reach their maximum lengths by subadult stage. Adult pelage has been acquired, and the color is brighter than in either subadults or old adults.  _Old Adults._--Characterized principally by well-worn molars; only thin peripheral band of enamel along with slight evidence of any primary or secondary folds on any teeth remain; all bones of skull coalesced; epiphyses and shafts of long bones ankylosed; small bony protuberances on many skulls; pelage usually ragged, tips of the hairs being worn away; white flecking and spotting not common, but occurs in some adults.
