In their plight they once more appealed to the savage chief who supplied their wants as generously as before; promising them that as long as his meal should last they should never want.  So for the time being the colonists were saved from starvation.  But another danger now threatened them, for quarrels arose among the men.  Albert de Pierria who had been set over them as captain proved to be cruel and despotic.  He oppressed the men in many ways, hanging and imprisoning at will those who displeased him.  Soon the men began to murmur under his tyranny.  Black looks greeted Albert de Pierria: he answered them with blacker deeds.  At length one day for some misdeed he banished a soldier to a lonely island, and left him there to die of hunger.  This was more than the colonists could well bear.  Their smouldering anger burst forth, and seizing the tyrant they put him to death.  Then they chose one of their number called Nicolas Barre to be their captain.  They were rid of their tyrant, and that brought peace for a time to the little colony.  But the men had grown to hate the place.  The land which had once seemed to them so fair now seemed no better than a prison, and they longed to escape from it.  They had, however, no ship, and although all around them tall trees grew no one of them knew anything of ship building.  Still, so strong was their desire to leave the hated spot that they resolved to build one.  They set to work with. a will.  Soon the sound of saw and hammer awoke the silence of the forest.  High and low, noble and peasant, all worked together, the Indians, even, lending a hand.  At length their labours were over and the rough little ship was afloat.  It made but a sorry appearance.  The planks were rough-hewn by the hatchet, and caulked with the moss which grew in long streamers on the trees.  The cordage was Indian made, and the sails were patched together from shirts and bedclothes.  Never before had men thought to dare the ocean waves in so crazy a craft.  But the colonists were in such eagerness to be gone that they chose rather to risk almost certain death upon the ocean than remain longer in their vast prison house.  So they loaded the ship with as much food as they could collect, and saying farewell to their Indian friends, they spread their patchwork sails, and glided out to sea drunken with joy at the thought of returning to France.  At first the wind blew fair, and the little ship sped gaily homeward.  Then came a calm.  The sun burned overhead, no faintest breeze stirred the slack sails, and the ship lay as if at anchor upon the glassy waters.  And as the ship lay motionless the slender stock of food grew less and less.  Soon there was nothing left but maize, and little of that.  At first a tiny handful was each man's daily portion; then it was counted by grains.  But jealously hoarded although it was the maize at length gave out, and there was nothing left to eat but their leather shoes and jerkins.  Then to the pain of hunger was added the pain of thirst, for the water barrels were emptied to the last drop.  Unable to endure the torture some drank the sea, water and so died in madness.  Beneath the burning sun every timber of the crazy little ship warped and started, and on all sides the sea flowed in.  Still through all their agony the men clung to life.  And sick with hunger, maddened with thirst as they were they laboured unceasingly bailing out the water.  But they laboured now with despair in their hearts, and they gave up hope of ever seeing their beloved France again.  Then at length the pitiless sun was overcast, a wild wind arose, and the glassy sea, whipped to fury, became a waste of foam and angry billows.  The tiny vessel was tossed about helplessly and buffeted this way and that.  \"In the turning of a hand,\" says an old writer, \"the waves filled their vessel half full of water, and bruised it upon one side.\"  The wretched men now gave themselves up for lost.  They cared no longer to bail, but cast themselves down into the bottom of the boat, and let it drift where it would.  Only one man among them did not utterly lose heart.  He set himself now to encourage the others, telling them that if only the wind held, in three days they would see the shores of France.  This man was so full of hope that at length he aroused the others from their despair.  Once more they began the weary work of bailing, and in spite of all the fury of the wind and waves the little vessel kept afloat.  At last the storm passed.  Once more the fainting wanderers righted their vessel, and turned the prow towards the shores of France. But three days passed, and no land was seen, and they became more despairing than before.  For now the last grain of corn was eaten, the last drop of water drunk.  Mad with thirst, sick with hunger, the men strained their weary eyes over the rolling waste of waters.  No land was in sight. Then a terrible thought crept into one mind after another.  In a low hoarse whisper one man and then another spoke out his thought-that one man should die for his fellows.  So deep were they sunk in woe that all were of one mind.  So lots were cast, and the man upon whom the lot fell was killed.  These tortured wayfarers had become cannibals.  Kept alive in this terrible fashion the men sailed on, and at length a faint grey streak appeared on the horizon.  It was the long-looked-for shore of France.  But the joy was too great for their over-strained minds.  The sight of land seemed to rob them of all power of thought or action.  With salvation in sight they let the little vessel drift aimlessly this way and that.  While they thus drifted aimlessly a white sail hove in sight, and an English vessel bore down upon them.  In the English vessel there happened to be a Frenchman who had sailed with Ribaut on his first voyage to Florida.  He soon recognised his countrymen in spite of their sorry plight, and they were brought aboard the English vessel. And when they had been given food and drink, and were somewhat revived, they told their tale of misery.  The Englishmen were in doubt for some time as to what it was best to do.  In the end they decided to set the most feeble on the shores of France, and to carry the others prisoners to the Queen of England, who at that time was about to send an expedition to Florida.  So ended the first attempt of the French to found a colony in North America.  __________      Chapter 8 - How The French Founded a Colony in Florida     Two years after Ribaut's ill-fated expedition another company of Frenchmen set sail for America.  This time Reté de Laudonničre was captain.  He had been with Ribaut two years before, and now again he landed on the same spot where Ribaut had first landed, and set up the arms of France.  As they saw his ship come the Indians ran down to the beach welcoming him with cries of excitement and joy, and taking him by the hand the chief led him to the pillar which Jean Ribaut had set up.  It was wreathed in flowers, and baskets of corn stood before it.  For the Indians looked upon it as an idol, and made offerings to it.  They kissed it with a great show of reverence, and begged the Frenchmen to do the same. \"Which we would not deny them,\" says Laudonničre, who himself tells the story, \"to the end we might draw them to be more in friendship with us.\"  Laudonničre was so delighted with the natives' friendly greeting that he resolved to found his colony among these kindly Indians. So a little way up the river which Ribaut had named the river of May, but which is now the St.  John's, he built a fort.  It was late one evening in June when the Frenchmen reached the spot where they intended to build the fort; wearied with their long march through the forest they lay down upon the ground and were soon fast asleep.  But at day-break Laudonničre was astir.  He commanded a trumpet to be sounded, and when all the men were aroused and stood together he bade them give thanks to God for their safe arrival.  So standing beneath the waving palms, with the deep blue sky arching overhead, the men sang a psalm of thanksgiving and praise.  Then kneeling they prayed long and earnestly.  The prayer ended, the men arose, and full of happy courage turned to their work.  Every one took part with right good will.  Some brought earth, some cut logs; there was not a man who had not a shovel or hatchet or some tool in his hand.  The work went on merrily, and soon above the banks of the river the fort rose, secure and strong, fenced and entrenched on every side.  In honour of their King Charles these new colonists called their fort Caroline, just as Ribaut had called his Charlesfort.  But as the native Chief Satouriona watched the fort grow he began to be uneasy.  He wondered what these pale-faced strangers were about, and he feared lest they should mean evil towards him.  So he gathered his warriors together, and one day the Frenchmen looked up from their labours to see the heights above them thick with savages in their war paint.  At once the Frenchmen dropped their tools and prepared to defend themselves.  But Satouriona, making signs of peace, and leaving most of his warriors behind him, came down into the camp followed by a band of twenty musicians who blew ear-piercing blasts upon discordant pipes.  Having reached the camp Satouriona squatted on his haunches, showing that he wanted to take counsel with the Frenchmen.  Then with many signs and gestures he told the Frenchmen that his great enemies the Thimagoes were near, and that if the Frenchmen wished to continue in friendship with him they must promise to help him against these powerful and hated foes.  Laudonničre feared to lose Satouriona's friendship.  And thereupon with signs, helped out now and again with a word or two, a, treaty was made between the Indians and the Frenchmen, Laudonničre promising to help Satouriona against his enemies, the Thimagoes.  With this treaty Satouriona was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37615"],["title","Ocean to Ocean on Horseback (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note: Passages in italics are indicated by _underscores_.

Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1895, by    WILLARD GLAZIER,    In the Office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington, D.C.       TO    THE MEMORY    OF    My Beloved Mother,    TO WHOSE    Precepts and Example    I AM INDEBTED FOR WHATEVER I HAVE BEEN   ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH    IN    The Journey of Life,    THIS VOLUME    THE RECORD OF MY LONGEST AMERICAN JOURNEY    IS AFFECTIONATELY    DEDICATED.     PREFACE.   It was the intention of the writer to publish a narrative descriptive of his overland tour from the Atlantic to the Pacific soon after returning from California in 1876, and his excuse for the delay in publication is that a variety of circumstances compelled him to postpone for a time the duty of arranging the contents of his journal until other pressing matters had been satisfactorily attended to. Again, considerable unfinished literary work, set aside when he began preparation for crossing the Continent, had to be resumed, and for these reasons the story of his journey from \"OCEAN TO OCEAN ON HORSEBACK\" is only now ready for the printer. In view of this delay in going to press, the author will endeavor to show a due regard for the changes time has wrought along his line of march, and while noting the incidents of his long ride from day to day, it has been his aim so far as possible to discuss the regions traversed, the growth of cities and the development of their industries from the standpoint of the present.
