Copeland hated to be an outlaw; but now he could not see effort brought to nothing. Brinker and he had survived so far, accomplishing much--far better results than he had expected; it made him surer that their purpose was generally sound.  More missiles were fired carefully--not to do damage, but to discourage the intruders; the latter were held at bay for another twelve hours. Copeland and Brinker left radio commands and threats unanswered, so it was hard for their opponents to get a fix on their position in the whirling nucleus.  Explosions blazed around them, but never very close. Masses of iron and stone were shattered and half vaporized, cooling subsequently to fine dust. The nucleus of Brulow's Comet expanded a bit under the battering that went on within it.  At an opportune moment, Copeland and Brinker clung to one of their jet-tubes and, gunning it very lightly, rode it from the central core-mass of the nucleus to a lesser meteor, and hid in a cleft. A dust-poll had concealed their change of position. And now, with so many other large meteors around them, they would be almost impossible to find.  They glimpsed the Patrol craft invading the heart of the comet. Men poured forth, struggling to set up jets in the hope of still deflecting this juggernaut from the Moon. But the comet was already much too close; before the setting-up was half completed it had to be abandoned. Still, the ships remained almost to the last.  Copeland wondered tensely if they'd ever go. His withered palms perspired.  \"We could still yell for help--have them take us off,\" Brinker suggested when they had left. He spoke by sound-channel contact.  The Moon loomed huge and ugly ahead. Copeland gave it a scared glance, and then laughed grimly. \"Ironic, that would be,\" he snapped, \"No--we've got this jet to ride, and we're still at liberty.\"  From space, lashed to the flaming propulsion tube, they saw the crash happen. It was a terrific spectacle. Copeland's hopes now had jagged cracks of worry. The comet seemed to move slowly, its coma flattening over the Moon's spaceward hemisphere. There were blinding flashes as the chunks of its nucleus bit into the lunar crust, their energy of velocity converting largely to heat. Then dust masked the region of impact. The comet's tail collapsed over the Moon like a crumbling tower.  Copeland gulped. He saw that Brinker had gone limp--fainted. Weakness was enough to cause that; but the fact of a plan carried out had a shock in it, too.  Copeland worked the jury-rigged controls of the jet, continuing to decelerate. At spotty intervals, under the terrible thrust of reducing speed, he was unconscious, too.         *       *       *       *       *  There was no such thing as picking a landing-spot. Checking velocity soon enough, so close to the Moon, took all of the propulsion tube's power--so he just followed the comet down. Almost at a stand-still at last, balanced on a streamer of flame, he toppled into hot dust Feebly he worked to unlash himself from the tube. Brinker, jolted back to semi-consciousness, managed to do the same.  Weakened and spent, they could not even lift themselves against the slight lunar gravity for a while.  The darkness around them was Stygian. But as more dust settled, the sky cleared, and the normal stars of the lunar night blazed out. Their attention was drawn in one direction inevitably.  Red-hot lava glowed there, in scattered areas over what was clearly an extensive expanse of territory. White vaporous plumes spurted high above the ground, and against the sides of new-formed meteor-craters, a white layer was collecting.  Copeland staggered erect. \"Frost and snow!\" he stammered. \"From volcanic steam! The first frost and snow on the Moon in a billion years! We've done it, Brinker! Brulow's Comet really did crack the thick lunar crust....\"  He heard Brinker's grunt of premature enthusiasm.  The Patrol picked them up hours later, wandering dazedly. They were emaciated ghosts of men--almost skeletons in armor. They gave their names, but didn't really come to their senses until the prison doctor in Tycho Station treated them, and they had slept for a long time.  \"Don't worry, fellas. Relax,\" he said--with fury in his eyes.  Other faces were grim.         *       *       *       *       *  At the speedy trial in Tycho Station, sharp-featured Krell was among many who flung accusations.  \"In the impact-zone itself--an area a hundred miles across--mining installations and machinery of tremendous value were utterly destroyed,\" he said. \"But lesser damage extends to a far wider circle. Thousands of claims have been buried in dust, till much of the far lunar hemisphere will have to be resurveyed. Luckily, miners and explorers were warned in time, and sought safety. But the charge of wholesale vandalism--terrible enough--does not stand alone. These men are to be remembered as accused robbers and murderers.\"  In rebuttal, Brinker's defiance was a little uncertain, as if under so much blame, he had lost his assurance.  \"Men who know the Moon know that its barrenness is poison, and not right for people!\" he growled. \"I tried to change it with Brulow's Comet--when I had no success by other means. Anyway, Copeland is blameless. I forced him to help me.\"  Embitted, there was no warmth in Copeland for his older codefendant and jinx. Still, even without Brinker's attempt to shield him, he would have been loyal.  \"During all important parts of mine and Jess Brinker's joint project,\" he told the court, \"I was in full agreement with his purpose.\"  Their attorney accomplished one considerable victory before these angry people. The charge of previous murders and robbery was barred; it was admitted that footprints were easy to duplicate, and that the presence of some bearing the names of the guilty was unlikely.  Brinker got fifty years in the mine-pits, and Copeland thirty.  \"You always figured I might get you in a jam, didn't you, Cope?\" Brinker said. \"I'll keep trying to fix that.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Copeland found nothing to grin about, in a thirty-year sentence. It was goodbye wandering, goodbye girls, goodbye everything. He'd get out middle-aged, finished, and marked. He might as well stay another twenty with Brinker--complete a sour association with him.  Copeland had another recent jolt to brood over. A bunch of old letters from his Frances had been delivered to him. His inability to receive or answer any of them had brought the worst result. She had married another guy, and who could blame her?  Arne Copeland wanted to kill Brinker. Getting desolation-goofy, and dragging him into this mess.  But from Brinker's infuriating grin, Copeland caught a hot spark of hope, backed by reasoning.         *       *       *       *       *  Later, sweating in the penal mine-pits near Tycho Station, Brinker and Copeland still heard scraps of news.  Explorers moved back into the region where the comet had split the lunar crust. The rising columns of steam and gas were perhaps unspectacular phenomena in themselves. But there they were, ready to fill a tremendous need. The sleepy internal fires of the Moon were unlikely to be violent. Yet they would push vapors up to the surface here perhaps for centuries.  In balancing benefit against transient damage, was it necessary even to mention that deeper and richer mineral deposits had been laid bare for easy mining by the blast effect of the comet's downfall? All free men--good or bad, and of large or small holdings--were set to gain, Krell included. But better mines were a side-issue.  The prisoners soon heard how roofs of transparent, flexible plastic, brought in bundles like fabric, were being reared over that smashed-up region, to trap escaping volcanic vapors. One tentlike structure. Then another and another.  Here was ample water from volcanic steam, and vast quantities of carbon-dioxide from which ordinary air-rejuvenators could release breathable oxygen. Men who had lived so long in the lunar silence and barrenness, soon saw that these raw materials of life need not only be used locally, but could be piped anywhere.  \"Folks have caught on, Cope,\" Brinker said. \"They were a little desolation-balmy, too--hence on our side all the time. Now they'll feel better about my Old Man. There'll be more than one city, I'll bet--clusters of big, plastic air-bubbles, self-sealing against meteor-punctures, warmed inside at night by volcanic heat. It won't happen all at once, but it'll come. Seeds'll be planted, and houses built. Parts of the Moon won't look the same.\"  Krell's death was part of the turning tide. He was found in Tycho Station, head smashed by a boot-sole of metal; it was good that Brinker was in prison, because his name was printed into Krell's skull.  Who did it? Neither Brinker nor Copeland cared very much. Some wronged stooge of Krell's, no doubt. Let the forces of law figure out the details.         *       *       *       *       *  Things got really good for Copeland and Brinker after popular demand forced their vindication. They were feted, honored, praised, rewarded. All Earth knew of them, and feminine colonists arriving as part of a new phase of the Moon's development, shined up to them as heroes.  It is not to be said that they didn't enjoy the advantages of fame. Brinker said more than once: \"Forget your Frances, Cope. Problems are easy, these days.\"  The time came when Copeland growled in answer: \"Sure--too easy. Having a lot of pals after the need is gone. No--I'm not criticizing. Most folks are swell. But I'd like to make friends and maybe find love a little more naturally. I thought I'd stay on the Moon; now I think I'll shove off for Mars. People are going there; whole towns are being built, I understand. And there's plenty of room for a lunar tramp, with a prison-record, to get"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37448"],["title","Comet's Burial (#4)"],["body","...\"  Copeland chuckled at the end. His vagabond blood was singing. He was also pitching a come-on at Brinker, for he'd seen him with some letters while they were prisoners. Copeland had glimpsed the name and address of the writer: Dorothy Wells, the big nurse that Brinker had known at Tycho Station. She was in Marsport now.  \"By gosh--I guess I'll go too, Cope!\" Brinker rumbled.  Looking back, Brinker thought it sort of funny that they were pals. He laughed.
