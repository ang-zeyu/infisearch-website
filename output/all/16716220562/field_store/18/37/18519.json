Painful operations of this sort are always better performed under chloroform.  Lay the cat on her side (rolled in the shawl) on some one else's knee, pour a little chloroform into a handkerchief, and hold it _near, not on_ pussy's nose, or you will smother her.  As soon as one portion of the chloroform gets evaporated supply its place with more; in from five to ten minutes pussy will be in the land of nod.  _Consumption_.--Consumption in the cat is curable, because it is not necessarily disease of the lungs.  The term is used to denote all sorts of wasting disease in which pussy falls away in flesh, in coat, and in general health.  The treatment must be careful--regulation of the diet and attention to her housing, an occasional mild purgative and dose of sulphur-butter.  You may give her raw meat steeped in wine if she will take it; but remember your great sheet-anchor in the care of all these cases is _cod-liver oil_, a dessert spoonful every day, or even more. And you may supplement the treatment most advantageously by giving, twice a day, the sixth of a grain of quinine.  One word of warning to cat-fanciers before I close this chapter.  _Never ask a veterinary surgeon about your cat_.  Their knowledge of canine ailments is vastly behind the times; their knowledge of cat diseases is simply and literally _carte blanche_.  If you want your pussy killed or tormented to death, _go to a chemist_.  The chemists in this country, through their ignorance, and impudent assumption of medical knowledge, slay their thousands annually.  Their ignorant patients, however, go with their eyes open, and place themselves in chemists' hands.  Well, as a paternal government refuses to protect the people, let the chemists go ahead and poison away; but, if warning of mine will be heard and heeded, they shall not poison our pussies too.  CHAPTER TEN.  DISEASES OF CATS--CONTINUED.  Probably one of the commonest and most distressing of complaints in the cat is _diarrhoea_; and what makes it all the more distressing, is the fact that, instead of receiving sympathy and good treatment in her distress, she is often harshly treated, kicked about, and thrust out of doors.  Diarrhoea is usually brought about by want of regular feeding, by improper food, and exposure to wet and cold.  Different sorts of food will also induce it--such as rancid horseflesh, sour milk, an over-allowance of fat or liver.  If taken at once, the treatment is generally very successful; if let go on too long, the cat will rapidly lose flesh; and the advent of dysentery will make it a charity to put her out of the way.  Give her at first a small teaspoonful of castor-oil, to which add two drops of solution of muriate of morphia.  This will often stop it, and remove all offending matter from the intestines.  If there is no improvement, repeat the dose on the second morning, and give small doses of common chalk mixture three times a day, with two drops of laudanum divided between the three doses.  Let her have nothing but bread and milk to eat, or a little corn-flour, if she will take it; if not, give her fish--she won't refuse that.  A few drops of solution of lime added to her milk will do good.  If she be very much reduced in weight, and has no appetite, try two grains of quinine made into twelve pills with breadcrumb: dose, one three times a day.  Or you may give cod-liver oil.  _Dysentery_ is a frequent sequel to badly-treated diarrhoea.  It is simply ulceration of the coats of the bowels, combined with great emaciation, roughness of coat, dejected look, and loss of appetite. Unless a very valuable cat, I would not advise you to keep her alive. You may, however, with patience, bring her round.  Give her, then, a grain or two of calomel occasionally, and quinine three times a day, unless she exhibits any tendency to fits.  House her well, and give her the most generous of diet--raw meat, eggs, etc, and a little port wine daily, or even a small quantity of brandy.  _Gastritis_, or inflammation of the stomach, is by no means rare in the cat, and is frequently the result of poison having been given with the hope of causing death.  The cat simply pines, and gets thin, and refuses nearly all food, which, when she does eat, causes pain, sickness, and vomiting.  The bowels, too, are often disordered.  There is nothing better, in these cases, than the tris-nitrate of bismuth, from one to three grains to be placed on the tongue twice or thrice daily.  You may also give occasionally a grain or two of calomel with a little rhubarb powder.  If there is much emaciation, cod-liver oil may be tried, and a small allowance of raw meat, cut into little bits; and quinine.  _Bronchitis_.--This is a much more common and dangerous disease than is generally supposed.  It often attacks cats at a particular age--say, six or eight months--and, indeed, is somewhat analogous to distemper in the dog.  It is ushered in by the usual symptoms of a bad cold--staring coat, watery eyes, and a slight cough.  If the disease be confined to the lining membranes of the nose and throat, there will be but little cough, but it usually attacks the bronchi (windpipes) themselves.  There is pain, a slight swelling of the nose, and mattery exudation from both nose and eyes.  After a few days of the acute comes _the chronic stage_. Pussy is now a very wretched and unhappy little object indeed.  She wanders about the house coughing continually, with her little tongue protruding.  She gets rapidly thin, and refuses all food; and, if not attended to, generally seeks some quiet, dark corner in which to die.  _Treatment_.--Great good can be done in the first stage by hot fomentations applied across the face.  These must be frequent, or they are of no avail.  Keep pussy indoors, and at first let her diet be low-- simply bread and milk, and occasionally fish.  Give her castor-oil alone, if there is no diarrhoea; if there is, add to the dose two drops of solution of muriate of morphia.  As the disease gets chronic, and pussy begins to lose flesh, do everything you can to support her strength by beef-tea, nourishing food, and wine.  If the cough is troublesome, get her the following, compounded by your own chemist:--R. Extr. conii, Pil. scillae, co. aa., gr. xv.; Camph., gr. xx.  Mix and make into twenty-four pills, and give one night and morning.  Latterly give cod-liver oil to complete the cure, which, in this case, will act like magic.  If the mange is present in any shape, it must be carefully seen to as directed under that heading.  _Fits_.--These are by no means uncommon among our domestic cats.  They are of various kinds--fainting fits, delirious fits, and convulsive fits.  The former are usually caused by weakness, exposure to the weather, and general ill-treatment, or loss of blood.  All that is required during the fit is rest and exposure to a current of cool air.  After the fit you ought to set about getting pussy's bodily health into better condition by good food, tonics, and oil.  _Delirious_ fits are those in which the poor cat, through mental or bodily suffering, apparently goes wild, dashing madly through the house, springing through a window, and finally hiding herself away in some dark corner.  You must catch her and put her into a quiet room, and do all you can to soothe her.  Apply smelling-salts to the nostrils, and bleed. This operation is easily performed by making a puncture through any of the small veins inside the ear, and fomenting in hot water.  An emetic-- if the cat is not insensible--will, in all probability, do good, as, both in the delirious and convulsive fits, the stomach and bowels are generally out of order.  _Convulsive Fits_.--The cat emits a cry as of pain and terror, and falls down on her side, foaming at the mouth, and with convulsive motions of all the limbs, accompanied with cries and moans.  Usually ends in a delirious fit.  During the fit do nothing at all, except prevent pussy from injuring herself or any one else; and do this gently and firmly.  A pinch of snuff or smelling-bottle applied to the nose can do no harm. Afterwards bleed, and keep her in a quiet, cool room, and treat as for the delirious fit above described.  When pussy has recovered--and especially if she has had a succession of fits--something ought to be done to prevent their recurrence.  If too fat, you must reduce her by lowering her diet, and giving a little sheep's liver and milt two or three times a week.  If too thin, tonics and raw meat must be given, and cod-liver oil every morning.  If, in spite of this, the fits recur, you must have recourse to such an alterative as the following, which has done good in many such cases:--R Bromid. potass., gr. xv.; Iod. potass., Zinci sulph., aa., gr. v.  Mix with moist breadcrumb, and make twenty boluses, of which the dose is one night and morning.  _Jaundice_.--Called also the yellows.  The disease can hardly be mistaken.  It is characterised by general feverishness, loss of appetite, a disposition to \"lie about,\" and by vomiting of a bright yellow or green fluid, covered with froth.  The skin, eyes, and lips are also tinged with yellow.  It is often fatal if not attended to in time.  I give, to begin with, a very small teaspoonful of Glauber salts, diluted with plenty of water.  It acts as a purgative or emetic, I don't care which.  If the vomiting continues, try a few grains of white bismuth placed on the tongue, or take three drops of creosote, and five of aromatic powder, and form into ten pills, with breadcrumb.  _Dose_, one three times a day.  For four or five nights running give one grain of calomel on the tongue.  But watch the symptoms, and omit for a night or two, if it causes too much purging.  If not, you can give a small dose of castor-oil in the morning.  As she gets well, strengthen her, and encourage her appetite with quinine first--no wine--and, after a week or two, with raw meat and cod-liver"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37339"],["title","'Midst the Wild Carpathians (#0)"],["body","Team at https://www.pgdp.net (This book was produced from scanned images of public domain material from the Google Print project.)      [Illustration: cover of 'Midst the Wild Carpathians by Dr. Jókai Mór]     'MIDST THE WILD CARPATHIANS  (\"AZ ÉRDÉLY ARÁNY KÓRA\")  BY MAURUS JÓKAI  TRANSLATED BY R. NISBET BAIN FROM THE FIRST HUNGARIAN EDITION  Authorised Version  LONDON: CHAPMAN AND HALL, LD. 1894 [All rights reserved]  RICHARD CLAY & SONS, LIMITED, LONDON & BUNGAY.     INTRODUCTION.   Hungarians regard _Az Érdély arány kora_ as, on the whole, the best of Jokai's great historical romances, and, to judge from the numerous existing versions of it, foreigners are of the same opinion as Hungarians. Few of Jokai's other tales have been translated so often, and the book is as great a favourite in Poland as it is in Germany. And certainly it fully deserves its great reputation, for it displays to the best advantage the author's three characteristic qualities--his powers of description, especially of nature, his dramatic intensity, and his peculiar humour.  The scene of the story is laid among the virgin forests and inaccessible mountains of seventeenth-century Transylvania, where a proud and valiant feudal nobility still maintained a precarious independence long after the parent state of Hungary had become a Turkish province. We are transported into a semi-heroic, semi-barbarous borderland between the Past and the Present, where Mediævalism has found a last retreat, and the civilizations of the East and West contend or coalesce. Bizarre, gorgeous, and picturesque forms flit before us--rude feudal magnates and refined Machiavellian intriguers; superb Turkish pashas and ferocious Moorish bandits; noble, high-minded ladies and tigrish odalisks; saturnine Hungarian heydukes, superstitious Wallachian peasants, savage Szeklers, and scarcely human Tartars. The plot too is in keeping with the vivid colouring and magnificent scenery of the story. The whole history of Transylvania, indeed, reads like a chapter from the _Arabian Nights_, but there are no more dramatic episodes in that history than those on which this novel is based--the sudden elevation of a country squire (Michael Apafi) to the throne of Transylvania against his will by order of the Padishah, and the dark conspiracy whereby Denis Banfi, the last of the great Transylvanian magnates, was so foully done to death.  In none of Jokai's other novels, moreover, is the individuality of the characters so distinct and consistent. The gluttonous Kemeny, who sacrificed a kingdom for a dinner; the well-meaning, easy-going Apafi, who would have made a model squire, but was irretrievably ruined by a princely diadem; his consort, the wise and generous Anna, always at hand to stop her husband from committing follies, or to save him from their consequences; the crafty Teleki, the Richelieu of Transylvania, with wide views and lofty aims, but sticking at nothing to compass his ends; his rival Banfi, rough, masterful, recklessly selfish, yet a patriot at heart, with a vein of true nobility running through his coarser nature; his tender and sensitive wife, clinging desperately to a brutal husband, who learnt her worth too late; the time-serving Csaky, as mean a rascal as ever truckled to the great or trampled on the fallen; Ali Pasha and Corsar Beg, excellent types of the official and the unofficial Turkish freebooter respectively; Kucsuk Pasha, the chivalrous Mussulman with a conscience above his creed; the renegade spy Zülfikar, groping in slippery places after illicit gains, and always falling on his feet with cat-like agility; and, last of all, that marvellous creation, Azrael, the demoniacal Turkish odalisk, blasting all who fall within the influence of her irresistible glamour, a Circe as sinuously beautiful and as utterly soulless as her own pet panther--all these personages of a, happily, by-gone age are depicted as vividly as if the author had known each one of them personally.  Finally, the book contains some of Jokai's happiest descriptions, and in this department it is generally admitted that the master, at his best, is unsurpassable. The description of the burning coal-mine in _Fekete Gyemantok_, of the Neva floods in _A szabadság a hó alatt_, of the plague in _Szomoru napok_, or of the Danube in all its varying moods in _Az arány ember_, stand alone in modern fiction; yet can any of these vivid tableaux compare with the wonderful account of Corsar Beg's aërial fairy palace, poised on the top of the savage Carpathians, or with the glowing picture of the gorgeous harem of Azrael, or with the fantastic scenery of the Devil's Garden, with its ice-built corridors, snow bridges, boiling streams, fathomless lakes, and rushing avalanches?

Before us lies the valley of the Drave, one of those endless wildernesses where even the wild beast loses its way. Forests everywhere, maples and aspens a thousand years old, with their roots under water; magnificent morasses the surface of which is covered, not with reeds and water-lilies, but with gigantic trees, from the dependent branches of which the vivifying waters force fresh roots. Here the swan builds her nest; here too dwell the royal heron, the blind crow, the golden plover, and other man-shunning animals which are rarely if ever seen in more habitable regions.  Here and there on little mounds, left bare during the long summer drought by the receding waters, sprout strange and gorgeous flowers, such perhaps as the earth has not brought forth since the Flood overwhelmed her. In this slimy soil every blade of grass shoots up like gigantic broom; the funnel-shaped convolvuluses and the evergreen ground-ivy put forth tendrils as stout and as strong as vine branches, which, stretching from tree to tree, twine round their stems and hang flowery garlands about the dark, sombre maples, just as if some hamadryad had crowned the grove dedicated to her.  But it is only when evening descends that this realm of waters begins to show signs of life. Whole swarms of water-fowl then mount into the air, whose rueful, monotonous croaking is only broken by the melancholy piping of the bittern and the whistle of the green turtle. The swan, too, raises her voice and sings that melodious lay which now, they tell us, is only to be heard in fairy-land,--for here man has never yet trod, the place is still God's.  Now and again, indeed, sportsmen of the bolder sort presume to penetrate far into this pathless labyrinth of bush and brake; but they are forced to wind their way among the trees in canoes which may at any moment be upset by the twisted tangle of roots stretching far and wide beneath the water, and it is just in these very places that the swamp is many fathoms deep; for although the dark green lake-grass and the yellow marsh-flowers, with the little black-and-red efts and newts darting about among them, seem close enough to be reached by an outstretched hand, they are nevertheless all under water deep enough to go over the head of the tallest man.  In other places it is the dense thicket which bars the canoe's way. Fallen trees, the spoil of many centuries, but untouched by the hand of man, lie rotting there in gigantic heaps. The submerged trunks have been turned to stone by the water, and the roots of the lake-grass, the filaments of the flax-plant, and the tendrils of the clematis have grown together over them, forming a strong, tough barrier just above the water which rocks and sways without giving way beneath one's feet. The knotty clout-like film of the lake, stretching far and wide, seems, to the careless eye, a continuation of this barrier, but the treacherous surface no longer bears--one step further, and Death is there. This unknown, unexplored region has however but few visitors.  Southwards, the wilderness is bounded by the river Drave. The trees which line its steep banks dip over into its waves. Not unfrequently the fierce stream sweeps them into its bed and away, to the great peril of all who sail or row upon its waters.  Northwards, the forest extends as far as Csakatorny, and where the morass ends oaks and beeches of all sorts flourish. In no other part of Hungary will you meet with trees so erect and so lofty. The wide waste abounds with all sorts of game. The wild boars, which wallow in the swampy ground there, are the largest and fiercest of"]]]
