Poor girl! Although not much hurt, for the rogue had not had time to carry out his threat to the fullest extent, she was terribly frightened, and the sight of the two dragoons lying motionless on the road did not help matters.  \"Take her down the road a little way, and make her sit down,\" said Captain Jeremy kindly. \"Then hasten back, for I'll warrant we've a fine job to make all shipshape and Bristol fashion.\"  \"Have you seen any more of these lubbers?\" he asked, after I had returned from carrying out his instructions.  \"There was a troop of them in Lyndhurst this morning. They went Southampton-wards.\"  \"I'll pray that they'll not return in a hurry,\" he exclaimed. \"We've enough to do to cover up our tracks.\"  \"Are they dead?\" I asked shudderingly.  \"As a marline-spike,\" he replied. \"For the time we are safe; they were the only ones that battened themselves to me. The Duke is taken. I saw him seized by some of Portman's Militia near Ringwood but yesterday. Faith! I was disappointed in King Monmouth, for he fled from the field long before his men began to give way.\"  \"And how did you escape?\"  \"'Twas touch and go. Monmouth, in a peasant's dress, lay hidden in some ferns, I but ten yards away. Little did I think 'twas the Duke till I heard Portman say as 'twas. I suppose that find satisfied them, for they searched no more. Farmer Shearing of Ringwood lent me his mare, and I rode off early this morning, intending to shape a course for Pitt's Deep, for 'twould have been madness to return to Lymington. Master Hammond, I was a fool even to set out for the West. What I've seen in forty years afloat is naught to what I've seen these last few days. But let's to work!\"  We thereupon dragged the bodies of the troopers into the bracken, and carefully obliterated all signs of the struggle. The troopers' horses were contentedly nibbling the coarse grass by the roadside, our pony Trotter having followed Constance.  They were fine animals, these dragoons' mounts, and I wondered what would become of them. The same question evidently troubled Captain Miles, for if they came within hearing of a trumpet call they would most likely trot off to rejoin their fellows. Yet, as there were no troopers within several miles of us, the horses might be taken by some of the peasants who lived on the outskirts of the heath, especially if we removed the saddlery.  \"Nay, 'tis too much of a risk,\" muttered Jeremy to himself, though I heard the words; and, lifting the fore-foot of one of the animals, he examined its hoof. There, in a manner that could not be effaced, were the royal monogram and regimental number; while a further search revealed the government mark branded on the creature's flank.  \"Those marks are their death warrant,\" he exclaimed.  \"How so?\"  \"No man cares for a dumb animal more than I do,\" he replied. \"Yet, when human life and liberty are at stake, it behoves us to take stern measures. Now, I pray you, take your sister home, and return speedily with a pair of serviceable spades.\"  So saying, he led the two animals aside into the gorse, while I hastened to rejoin Constance. We had barely gone a hundred paces when a pistol shot rang out, quickly followed by another.  \"What sound is that?\" asked my sister.  \"'Tis but naught,\" I replied, not daring to tell her the plain truth. \"Captain Miles has unloaded the troopers' pistols.\"     CHAPTER III  Captain Jeremy's Surprise.   \"What hath befallen you?\" asked my father anxiously, as we crossed the threshold of the house. \"Ye are both as pale as ghosts, and your clothes, Clifford, are smothered in dust. Hath Trotter thrown you?\"  For answer, Constance sat down upon a settle and sobbed hysterically, while my father, stopping abruptly his task of questioning us, bestirred himself to comfort her.  \"Two dragoons have molested us,\" I announced. \"They were in pursuit of Captain Miles.\"  \"Have they hurt you?\" he asked.  \"Nay, but little--thanks to the Captain.\" In a few words I related the incidents that had terminated in the death of the two villains. My father looked grave.  \"And Jeremy?\" he asked. \"Hath he gone to Lymington?\"  \"Nay, he awaits me by the Beaulieu bridle path.\"  \"'Tis well for him, though I am loath to risk His Majesty's displeasure in succouring rebels. Yet, especially as he did befriend you, I'll do my best to repay Jeremy's kindness. He must not go to Lymington, Clifford.\"  \"He doth not intend to do so,\" said I. \"He is making for Pitt's Deep.\"  \"Equally as rash as if he journeyed to Lymington. I, too, heard the news this morning soon after you left. The dragoons watch every mile of this part of the coast, and at every little port a watch is set, so that no strangers dare set foot on shipboard without being closely questioned. My son, I take the risk even of harbouring a rebel. I'll go with thee and speak my mind with friend Jeremy.\"  Bidding Martha, our housekeeper, stay with Constance, and impressing upon her the necessity for silence as to what had occurred, my father, taking a mattock in his hand, set out to the scene of the encounter, I accompanying him, and carrying the spades over my shoulder.  \"Where is the package I bade you bring from Lyndhurst?\" he asked, as we left the outskirts of the village.  I searched the pockets of my doublet without success, though I was certain that the article had been safely placed in one of them.  \"It must have fallen out on the road,\" I replied.  \"'Tis a grave matter,\" he said, with a look of anxiety and a gesture of impatience. \"How can I--but there! if 't comes to the worst, I must journey into Southampton myself. 'Tis the fortune of war.\"  No more was said, for we were already in sight of the cross-roads, and Captain Miles was sitting on the bracken-covered bank awaiting us.  \"Good day to you, Cap'n Hammond!\" he exclaimed as we approached. \"'Tis a sad business dragging you and yours into this bickering.\"  \"Yet, thanks to Heaven and your aid, my children were saved from the clutches of those rogues.\"  \"Had it not been for me the rascals would not have been here,\" replied Captain Miles apologetically. \"Yet I thank you, sir, for coming to my assistance, though 'tis to the advantage of this part of the countryside that we hide this carrion,\" and he pointed with his finger to the bodies of the two dragoons.  We set to work with a will, and in less than a quarter of an hour a shallow trench was dug sufficiently deep to receive the corpses of the ruffianly soldiers.  \"Egad! 'tis warm work,\" exclaimed my father, leaning on his mattock as the first part of the task was completed.  \"I'm right sorry I've no rum to offer you,\" said Captain Miles, wiping his heated brow. \"You see, we're not aboard the old _Venture_, otherwise 'twould be different.\"  \"I, too, regret that I brought not my flask of cordials,\" replied my father.  \"There is a bottle of strong waters that I found close to the body of one of these villains,\" remarked Jeremy; \"but though I did make three good attempts at it, 'twas more than I could stomach. It smells aright, but the taste--faugh! I have it in my mouth yet. Try it, Captain Hammond, and see if it suit thy palate.\"  So saying, he produced a bottle and handed it to my father, who gave an exclamation of surprise, quickly followed by a hearty laugh.  \"Why, what's amiss?\" asked the astonished Captain, as my father thrust the bottle into his pocket.  \"Hist! I'll tell thee anon,\" said my sire mysteriously. \"Now, let's resume our task.\"  The carcasses of the troopers' horses, the victims of Captain Miles's self-preservation, were next interred; while, to make doubly sure, the mount that Jeremy had borrowed from the Ringwood farmer was also buried.  This done, I happened to cross the highway, where, to my surprise, I found the wrappings of the package for which we had journeyed into Lyndhurst on that eventful morning.  \"See! here is the covering of your packet,\" I exclaimed, holding it up to my father's view.  \"Aye, Clifford, I know it. Say no more on this matter.\"  Inwardly wondering, I obeyed. Whatever the package contained, I now felt certain that 'twas the same stuff as Jeremy Miles had attempted to swallow.  \"Now, look you, Captain Miles,\" said my father, as we prepared to return homewards, \"neither Lymington nor Pitt's Deep offers an asylum for you. To go to either place is to set your head in a trap. I have made up my mind that you must tarry with us at Brockenhurst till this storm has blown over.\"  \"Nay, 'tis unfair to saddle you with the presence of a proclaimed rebel,\" objected Captain Jeremy stoutly. \"The service I rendered your children does not warrant such a generous payment. I'll accept your hospitality for this night, and at sunrise to-morrow I'll make my way into Sussex. I know of an old shipmate at Shoreham who'll gladly set me across to France.\"  \"You'll never get out of Hampshire, my friend,\" interrupted my father; \"at least, not yet awhile. Perchance the tide of monarchy will change again, though, mark you, I'd far rather have James Stuart as my lawful sovereign than James Walters. No, no, I say; further flight is out of the question. At Brockenhurst you will stay till I give you leave to go farther afield.\"  'Twas no light matter to smuggle the fugitive into our home; but we did it, and for the next week or more Captain Miles remained within doors, my father having pointed out to him the secret panel in case of an emergency. This surprised me not a little, for he was usually very reticent about this matter. True, I had been told of the existence of the hiding-place, but even Constance was kept in ignorance of it. The person who contrived the sliding panel must have done his work well, for no one unacquainted with its mechanism could cause it to move. But I've said enough concerning this matter, for although 'tis well known that our home does"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38222"],["title","The Quest of the 'Golden Hope': A Seventeenth Century Story of Adventure (#3)"],["body","such a contrivance, its position and the method of working it still remain a secret locked in the breast of a trusted few, and 'twould not be doing my duty towards the Hammonds that are to come were I to say more.  Yet there was no reason for alarm. Though troops of horse often passed through Brockenhurst on their way to and from Lymington, none stopped to search for rebels. Neither did the disappearance of two of Cornbury's Dragoons cause any trouble, for we learnt that they were set down as deserters, while, as good fortune would have it, a report came in that two men answering their description had been seen riding northwards out of Salisbury.  One morning I was seated with Captain Jeremy in the little room where he was wont to spend most of his time. Often I would go thither to be regaled with stories of his voyage to the Indies and his adventures in foreign parts, till my young blood coursed madly through my veins; and so strange were some of the tales he told that I'm afraid his share of imagination must have been a double one.  In the midst of his narrative on this particular day, my father entered, having just returned from Lymington Town.  \"I have bad news for you,\" he announced.  \"'Tis not the first time, Captain Hammond,\" replied Jeremy composedly. \"What is it this time?\"  \"The sheriff hath taken possession of your house, and it and all its contents are to be sold by candle auction.\"[1]  \"'Tis the fortune of war,\" said Captain Miles, removing his long clay pipe from his lips and puffing out a thick cloud of smoke. \"I expected it, and provided for it ere I left for Monmouth's camp. What money I possess, beyond what I require for my present disbursements, I have stowed away in the hold of the good ship 'Never-Sink'--to wit, Mother Earth. But there is one thing I'd be glad to lay my hands on. Wouldst be willing to buy a certain article out of my house?\"  \"Would I could buy the lot!\"  \"Nay, 'tis but a picture--a painting of my good barque the _Venture_, done in oils by a rascally Neapolitan, for which he charged me five ducats, though he did place the chain plates too far aft, and the spritsail yard above the bowsprit.\"  \"'Tis a common fault with a landlubber,\" said my parent. \"Nevertheless, I'll see to it.\"  \"I prize the painting but lightly,\" continued Jeremy; \"but there's more in it than meets the eye.\"  \"I do not understand.\"  \"Captain Hammond, you've treated me right nobly, and 'twould ill become me were I not to repay you to the utmost of my power. I'll be straightforward in this matter. Listen!\"  My father motioned to me to leave them, but, perceiving the gesture, Captain Jeremy exclaimed:  \"No, no, let the lad remain, for 'tis also to his advantage to hear. That picture contains the true and only clue to the lost treasure ship _Madre de Dios_.\"   [1] This custom appears to be fairly common in south-coast ports. In September, 1628, the Mayor of Portsmouth reported to the Admiralty that \"The The Gift of God\", prize, was sold on the last day of August by the burning of a candle.     CHAPTER IV  The _Madre de Dios_   My father opened his eyes wide, and his mouth also, so that his pipe clattered on the oaken floor and was broken into a score of fragments.  \"The _Madre de Dios_!\" he exclaimed at length. \"You speak truly--the same _Madre de Dios_ concerning which Fergusson adventured himself in the last reign?\"  \"The same, Captain Hammond. I have the secret under my thumb.\"  \"You know where the wreck lies hidden?\"  \"Aye, but that matters little. The treasure is not in her, but lies in a safe place.\"  Even I had heard the wonderful story of the Spanish treasure ship. 'Twas well known that in the last century Sir John Berkeley, during his attack upon Porto Rico, had captured a Spanish caravel, the _Madre de Dios_. On her he found pearls worth ten thousand ducats, gold dust, ingots, and other treasure to the value of 400,000 pounds. Of this vast spoil Sir John shipped about one-half aboard his own ship, sending the _Madre_ under convoy for England. The caravel, overtaken by a furious north-easterly gale, was lost with all hands amongst the islands of the Lesser Antilles, and although expeditions innumerable had been sent out to discover the wreck, none had met with success. If Captain Jeremy Miles was not deceiving himself and us also, a king's ransom was almost within his grasp.  \"Pardon me if I put it bluntly,\" said my father, \"but if you know where the treasure lies, why have you not recovered it ere now?\"  \"That I'll explain, methinks, to your satisfaction, though 'tis a long story. Yet, to put it briefly, I was cast away on the island where the treasure lieth in the year 1674. For two years I was cut off from my fellow-men, till a Spanish barque took me off. It goes without saying that I told the Dons naught concerning the treasure; but on setting foot in England once more, I took steps to obtain command of a vessel trading with the Indies. Yet ill fortune thwarted my purpose.\"  \"How so?\"  \"Head winds and pestilence. Then, though I was averse to sharing my secret, I applied to my Lord Rochester to intercede with the King; but, since I was only a plain merchant captain, and no King's officer, my lord must needs flout me and deride my statement.\"  \"My Lord Rochester had his own views on this matter, I take it,\" remarked my father. \"There were no less than forty applications to his late Majesty from would-be treasure seekers. Fergusson went and failed; Captain Calcott did likewise, and now Phipps has been gone these two years, spending the King's money and using his ships of war, which might be more profitably employed elsewhere. Nay, I cannot blame my Lord Rochester.\"  \"But I do!\" exclaimed Captain Miles vehemently. \"Not for his refusal, mark you, for he's the loser on't, but for his churlish manner. 'Twas mainly for this reason that I set out to join Monmouth's standard, for, had all been well, I am certain he would, as a man of spirit and enterprise, have been willing to grant me aid in the search.\"  \"The Duke will need all his spirit and enterprise to save his neck from the headsman's axe,\" replied my father. \"But concerning this matter?\"  \"I have a proposal to make, Captain Hammond. But ere we go farther, 'tis worth while laying hands on the chart.\"  \"Aye,\" replied my father. \"The sale is fixed for to-morrow, so I'll to Lymington and secure the picture at all costs.\"  The subject was then dropped for the time, yet I did not fail to notice that my sire was by no means in his usual spirits, but seemed preoccupied, and inclined to irritability. Constance, too, noticed the change.  \"What doth he ponder over?\" she asked. \"Is there fresh trouble coming upon us? Have they discovered aught of that affair on the Lyndhurst Road?\" and she gave a little shudder at the remembrance of it.  \"Nay,\" I replied. \"That affair has, I hope, blown over. Something is in the wind, nevertheless, for I doubt not that our father and Captain Miles are engaging upon some profitable enterprise; it may happen that a voyage to the West Indies will restore the fortunes of our house.\"  \"But will father have to go to sea again?\" she asked anxiously.  \"It may so happen,\" I replied.  \"And you----?\"  \"I would I could,\" I rejoined earnestly, for 'twas my cherished ambition to go to sea; yet I feared my father would withhold his consent.  The next day my father and I rode into Lymington, and having left our horses at the \"Hart\", we repaired to Jeremy's house.  It was a long, low-built, thatched-roofed building, standing at the bottom of the steep High Street, and overlooking the muddy harbour where the Lym stream joins the sea. The door and the frames of the diamond-paned windows were painted a vivid green--possibly the work of the energetic seaman; while above the porch was nailed an effigy of a woman holding an arrow in her hand--the figurehead of one of his former vessels.  Crowds of eager and curious townsfolk were gathered without the door on which the sheriff's notice of the sale was affixed, while two tip-staves, escorting a lean, pale-faced man, were trying to force their way through the press of onlookers.  \"'Tis the attorney for the Crown,\" whispered my father, pointing to the white-faced man, who was evidently ill at ease. \"'Tis fortunate for him that he has a troop of horse within ear-shot, or I'll warrant he would have a warm reception.\"  But even the presence of the soldiers, who were drawn up in an alley leading to the quay, did not prevent volleys of rotten eggs and street garbage being directed against the sheriff's representative, till, the door being opened, he disappeared within, followed by the incensed townsfolk. Jeremy was, as I have mentioned, a general favourite in and around Lymington; and, besides, his rash participation in the revolt was not unfavourably regarded by his fellow-townsmen, who took this opportunity of expressing their practical sympathy with the absent Captain.  By dint of much elbowing we succeeded in gaining admission to the house, and, to my inexperienced eyes, the scene within was strange and pathetically interesting, as preparations were made to dispose of our friend's goods and chattels.  By threats, entreaties, and commands the sheriff's officer obtained comparative quiet, and amidst the groans of his audience he read the proclamation setting forth that the house and goods of Captain Jeremy Miles, he having been declared a traitor to His Majesty King James, were to be sold forthwith.  Thereupon one of the tip-staves produced a long wax candle having a number of metal pegs stuck into it at regular intervals. This he proceeded to light; the first lot was announced, and the highest bid, ere the uppermost peg fell from the melted wax, secured the submitted article.  In the excitement, as bidder after bidder was outbidden, even the voices of the malcontents were hushed; while as peg after peg dropped out and rebounded from the oaken table, the clang of the hammer could scarce drown the"]]]
