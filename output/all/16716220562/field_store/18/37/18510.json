This book is the   result.    Among other things, it narrates how Mrs. Bindle caught a chill, how a   nephew was born to her and what effect it had upon her outlook.    It tells how she encountered a bull, and what happened to the man who   endeavoured to take forcible possession of her home.    She is shown as breaking a strike by precipitating a lock-out, burning   incense to her brother-in-law, Mr. Hearty, and refusing the armistice   that was offered.    One chapter tells of her relations with her neighbours. Another deals   with a musical evening she planned, and yet a third of how she caught   a chill and was in great fear of heaven.     _BY THE SAME AUTHOR_      BINDLE                               2s. 6d. net.

Lorst your job?\"  With one hand resting upon the edge of the pail beside which she was kneeling, Mrs. Bindle looked up, challenge in her eyes. Bindle's unexpected appearance while she was washing the kitchen oilcloth filled her with foreboding.  \"There's a strike on at the yard,\" he replied in a tone which, in spite of his endeavour to render it casual, sounded like a confession of guilt. He knew Mrs. Bindle; he knew also her views on strikes.  \"A what?\" she cried, rising to her feet and wiping her hands upon the coarse canvas apron that covered the skirt carefully festooned about her hips. \"A what?\"  \"A strike,\" repeated Bindle. \"They give Walter 'Odson the sack, so we all come out.\"  \"Oh! you have, have you?\" she cried, her thin lips disappearing ominously. \"And when are you going back, I'd like to know?\" She regarded him with an eye that he knew meant war.  \"Can't say,\" he replied, as he proceeded to fill his pipe from a tin tobacco-box. \"Depends on the Union,\" he added.  \"The Union!\" she cried with rising wrath. \"I wish I had them here. I'd give them Union, throwing men out of work, with food the price it is. What's going to 'appen to us? Can you tell me that?\" she demanded, her diction becoming a little frayed at the edges, owing to the intensity of her feelings.  Bindle remained silent. He realised that he was faced by a crisis.  \"Nice thing you coming 'ome at eleven o'clock in the morning calmly saying you've struck,\" she continued angrily. \"You're a lazy, good-for-nothing set of loafers, the whole lot of you, that's what you are. When you're tired of work and want a 'oliday you strike, and spend your time in public-'ouses, betting and drinking and swearing, and us women slaving morning, noon and night to keep you. Suppose I was to strike, what then?\"  She undid her canvas apron, and with short, jerky movements proceeded to fold and place it in the dresser-drawer. She then let down the festoons into which her skirt had been gathered about her inconspicuous hips.  Mrs. Bindle was a sharp, hatchet-faced woman, with eyes too closely set together to satisfy an artist.  The narrowness of her head was emphasised by the way in which her thin, sandy hair was drawn behind each ear and screwed tightly into a knot at the back.  Her lips were thin and slightly marked, and when she was annoyed they had a tendency to disappear altogether.  \"How are we going to live?\" she demanded. \"Answer me that! You and your strikes!\"  Bindle struck a match and became absorbed in lighting his pipe.  \"What are you going to do for food?\" She was not to be denied.  \"We're a-goin' to get strike pay,\" he countered, seizing the opening.  \"Strike pay!\" she cried scornfully. \"A fat lot of good that'll do. A pound a week, I suppose, and you eating like a--like a----\" she paused for a satisfactory simile. \"Eating me out of 'ouse and 'ome,\" she amended. \"'Strike pay!' I'd give 'em strike pay if I had my way.\"  \"It'll 'elp,\" suggested Bindle.  \"Help! Yes, it'll help you to find out how hungry you can get,\" she retorted grimly. \"I'd like to have that man Smillie here, I'd give him a bit of my mind.\"  \"But 'e ain't done it,\" protested Bindle, a sense of fair play prompting him to defend the absent leader. \"'E's a miner. We don't belong to 'is Union.\"  \"They're all tarred with the same brush,\" cried Mrs. Bindle, \"a good-for-nothing, lazy lot. They turn you round their little fingers, and then laugh at you up their sleeves. I know them,\" she added darkly.  Bindle edged towards the door. He had not been in favour of the strike; now it was even less popular with him.  \"I suppose you're going round to your low public-house, to drink and smoke and tell each other how clever you've been,\" she continued. \"Then you'll come back expecting to find your dinner ready to put in your mouth.\"  Mrs. Bindle's words were prophetic. Bindle _was_ going round to The Yellow Ostrich to meet his mates, and discuss the latest strike-news.  \"You wouldn't 'ave me a blackleg, Lizzie, would you?\" he asked.  \"Don't talk to me about such things,\" she retorted. \"I'm a hardworking woman, I am, inchin' and pinchin' to keep the home respectable, while you and your low companions refuse to work. I wish I had them all here, I'd give them strikes.\" Her voice shook with suppressed passion.  Realising that the fates were against him, Bindle beat a gloomy retreat, and turned his steps in the direction of The Yellow Ostrich.  At one o'clock he returned to Fenton Street, a little doubtful; but very hungry.  He closed the gate quietly, Mrs. Bindle hated the banging of gates. Suddenly he caught sight of a piece of white paper pinned to the front door. A moment later he was reading the dumbfounding announcement:       \"I have struck too.       \"E. BINDLE.\"  The words, which were written on the back of a coal-merchant's advertisement, seemed to dance before his eyes.  He was conscious that at the front window on either side a face was watching him intently. In Fenton Street drama was the common property of all.  With a puzzled expression in his eyes, Bindle stood staring at the piece of paper and its ominous message, his right hand scratching his head through the blue and white cricket cap he habitually wore.  \"Well, I'm blowed,\" he muttered, as Mrs. Grimps, who lived at No. 5, came to her door and stood regarding him not unsympathetically.  At the sight of her neighbour, Mrs. Sawney, who occupied No. 9, also appeared, her hands rolled up in her apron and her arms steaming. She had been engaged in the scullery when \"'Arriet,\" who had been set to watch events, rushed in from the front room with the news that Mr. Bindle was coming.  \"Serves you right, it does,\" said Mrs. Sawney. \"You men,\" she added, as if to remove from her words any suggestion that they were intended as personal. Bindle was very popular with his neighbours.  \"Strikes you does, when you ain't feeling like work,\" chorused Mrs. Grimps, \"I know you.\"  Bindle looked from one to the other. For once he felt there was nothing to say.  \"Then there's the kids,\" said a slatternly-looking woman with a hard mouth and dusty hair, who had just drifted up from two doors away. \"A lot you cares. It's us wot 'as to suffer.\"  There was a murmur from the other women, who had been reinforced by two neighbours from the opposite side of the street.  \"She 'as my sympathy,\" said Mrs. Sawney, \"although I can't say I likes 'er as a friend.\"  During these remarks, Bindle had been searching for his latch-key, which he now drew forth and inserted in the lock; but, although the latch responded, the door did not give. It was bolted on the inside.  \"Well, I'm blowed!\" he muttered again, too surprised at this new phase of the situation to be more than dimly conscious of the remarks of those about him.  \"My sister's man struck three months ago,\" said one of the new arrivals, \"and 'er expectin' 'er fifth. Crool I calls it. They ought to 'ave 'em theirselves is wot I say. That'ud learn 'em to strike.\"  A murmur of approval broke from the others at this enigmatical utterance.  \"It's all very well for them,\" cried Mrs. Sawney; \"but it's us wot 'as to suffer, us and the pore kids, bless 'em. 'Arriet, you let me catch you swingin' on that gate again, my beauty, and I'll skin you.\"  The last remark was directed at the little girl, who had seized the moment of her mother's"]]]
