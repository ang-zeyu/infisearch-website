Bill hooked; pouch small; tail long and forked; eye space feathered.     Order V. Ducks, Geese, and Swans. ANSERES.  (1 family, 49 species, 6 subspecies.)   Birds of familiar form; bill, except in Mergansers or Saw-billed Ducks, broad and with rows of 'strainers' or 'gutters' on either side; wings short, in the Ducks usually with a bright colored patch or speculum; tail generally short; legs short; feet webbed. Most species, unlike the Grebes, take wing rather than dive when pursued.     [Illustration: RED-BREASTED MERGANSER.]    [Illustration: MALLARD.]  Family 15. DUCKS, GEESE, AND SWANS. AnatidÃ¦.  Bill long, narrow, and rounded with tooth-like projections along its sides. (Mergansers. Subfamily _MerginÃ¦_.)

Bill and tarsus as in preceding, but hind toe with a broad lobe or flap. (Sea and Bay Ducks. Subfamily _FuligulinÃ¦_.)  Bill proportionately narrower than in the River or Bay Ducks; gutters on its sides less developed; scales on front of tarsus rounded. (Geese. Subfamily _AnserinÃ¦_.)  Large, usually white birds, with bare eye space. (Swans. Subfamily _CygninÃ¦_.)     Order VI. Flamingoes. ODONTOGLOSSÃ.  (1 family, 1 species.)

Rails are short-winged skulkers in grassy marshes; Gallinules frequent reedy shores; Coots, which alone of the Order have webbed (lobate) toes, are as aquatic as Ducks, from which they may be known by their pointed, white bill, nodding motion of the head when swimming, and habit of pattering over the water when alarmed.

COLOR KEY TO   NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS     Order I. DIVING BIRDS.  PYGOPODES.      Family 1. GREBES. PodicipidÃ¦. 6 species.     Family 2. LOONS. GaviidÃ¦. 5 species.     Family 3. AUKS, MURRES, and PUFFINS. AlcidÃ¦. 21 species, 3    subspecies.   Grebes are at home in reed-grown ponds or sloughs where their nests are made on rafts or islets of water-soaked vegetation. Their eggs number from four to eight, are dull white in color, and are usually covered by the bird with a portion of the nesting material when it leaves its home. Grebes occasionally rest on the shore, but are rarely found far from the water. When on land they may lie flat on their breasts or sit erect on their tails and entire foot, or tarsus. Their progress on land, as a rule, is awkward and they may use their wings as fore feet to assist them. In diving, Grebes sometimes spring partly from the water and then plunge downward head first, or they may quietly sink with scarce a ripple to mark the place of their disappearance.  Loons generally pass the summer on some large lake, and in the winter many of them live at sea. They nest, as a rule, on the shore, but so near the water that the parent bird may slide off its two dark brown, mottled eggs into its favorite element. Like the Grebes, Loons are expert divers, and birds of both families so often seek safety under the water rather than in the air that it is frequently difficult to make them fly. The young of both Grebes and Loons are born covered with feathers and take to the water shortly after birth, often using the back of the parent bird as an ever present island on which they may rest at will.  The Auks, Murres, and Puffins are sea birds which nest usually in large colonies on isolated islets or rocky, inaccessible shores of the northern part of the northern hemisphere. They lay one or two eggs, sometimes in an exposed"]]]
