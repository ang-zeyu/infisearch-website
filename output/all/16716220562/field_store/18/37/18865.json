After much delay, occasioned by nearly half the original force being withdrawn from the armament intended for the West Indies, and applied to another purpose, on the 24th of November, 1793, the Boyne of 98 guns, Captain Grey commander, having Vice Admiral Sir John Jervis's flag flying at the fore-topmast head, made the signal for sailing to the fleet destined with her for this expedition, and dropped down to St. Helen's, where she lay at single anchor, waiting for those ships that were not ready; the ordnance storeships were particularly tardy. This morning an unfortunate accident befel Mr. Scott, second lieutenant of the Boyne, whose arm was broken by a block giving way in the fore part of the ship, where he was stationed; but happily, by the care and skill of Mr. Weir the surgeon, he was nearly recovered by the time the ship reached Barbadoes.  On Tuesday the 26th of November the Boyne weighed anchor, and with the rest of the fleet sailed from St. Helen's with a fair wind down channel. On the 27th we lay to off Portland Road, waiting for the Quebec frigate, which remained at Spithead to hasten the storeships and transports (that were not at first ready to sail with the Boyne), and to convoy them through the Needles.  On the 28th of November, in the morning, we were off the Land's End, and were soon afterwards becalmed for a short time. In the evening, a fresh breeze springing up, we proceeded on our voyage. Before it was dark eight sail were seen from the mast head.  On the 29th we passed Commodore Paisley in the Bellerophon, with several frigates in company. The Commodore saluted the Admiral's flag with thirteen guns, which was returned from the Boyne with eleven guns.  As it may be proper to inform the reader that, in consequence of a particular invitation from the Admiral, the Commander in Chief and his suite, with several of the officers on the staff under him, were passengers in the Boyne, I shall here subjoin their names.    His Excellency Sir Charles Grey, K. B. Commander in Chief.    Major General Thomas Dundas.    Lieutenant Colonel Symes, Quarter Master General.    Major Henry Grey, Deputy Quarter Master General.    Lieut. Col. Fisher, Secretary to the Commander in Chief.    Major Lyon, Deputy Adjutant General.    Captain Finch Mason,   }   Lieut. John Cunningham,} Aid de Camps to the Commander in Chief.   Captain Newton Ogle,   }    Capt. Maitland, Aid de Camp to Major General Dundas.    Dr. Wardle, Surgeon on the Staff.    Also Chevalier Sancée, a brave and ingenious French Officer, whom   the Commander in Chief took with him, as being acquainted with the   island of Martinique, and the fortifications of Fort Bourbon and St.   Louis, having served under the Marquis de Bouillé at the construction   of the former works.  Thus, by the friendly intercourse subsisting between the two Commanders in Chief, the time on the passage was most usefully employed in forming plans of operation, which could not have been executed with that promptness that distinguished the ensuing campaign, had it been otherwise.  On Tuesday the 3d of December, the Rose frigate, Captain Riou, parted company; as did, on the 7th following, Commodore Thompson and part of the convoy, and we proceeded with the greater dispatch on our voyage.  On the 8th of December the wind proved foul, with rain and hazy weather. At night, in the middle watch, we were attacked by a squall of wind and rain, accompanied by a heavy sea, which struck the rudder with such violence, that the men at the wheel losing their hold, were thrown down; and the tiller breaking loose, stove in the gunner's cabin; at the same time the pinnace, a six-oared boat, that was suspended over the stern, was washed away, and totally lost.  On the 9th of December in the morning, the ship was taken aback by a sudden squall of wind, attended with thunder and lightning, with a most tremendous sea; we then wore ship, and stood to the south west. Those who have never sailed in a ship of war of the first or second rate, can form no idea of the grandeur and awfulness of the scene when so large a body is struggling with contending elements. As the ship rolls through the high swell her sides appear to twist and bend in a surprising manner. The guns hanging on one side, and pressing against the other, seem as if, at every roll, they would, by their immense weight, force their way through; which, added to the cracking of the cordage, the roaring of the wind, and a variety of other noises, forms a scene of surprise and alarm to the inexperienced voyager.  This squally weather continued at intervals for four days. On the 12th we saw some sea gulls. On the 13th two strange sail hove in sight; the Ulysses chased one of them, and we made sail after the other, and fired several shot at her to bring her to; but in the evening were obliged to give up the pursuit, for fear of parting from our convoy, which however happened in the following night, during a heavy gale of wind.  On Saturday the 14th we saw a gull, and several turtle passed near the ship.  On the 16th land was discovered at four P. M. supposed to be the island of Porto Santo. All this day we sailed at the rate of seven and eight knots an hour. Tuesday the 17th of December we found that during the night we had passed by the island of Madeira; but this morning tacked and stood towards it, and arrived off Funchial, the capital of that island, of which we had a delightful view. As we approached the land the surrounding country had a very beautiful appearance, especially after a long voyage, when the eye has been wearied by the uninteresting sameness of an extended ocean. The town of Funchial, so named from the Portuguese word funcho, fennel, which grows in great abundance on the neighbouring rocks, is situated at the bottom of a bay, and is a large ill-built town: it has many churches and convents; but as we did not go on shore, I can give no particular description of them. Immediately behind the town the hills rise gradually one above the other, terminating in prodigious high mountains, which are plentifully covered almost half-way up with plantations of vines, interspersed with churches and elegant houses. High up in the mountains, in a valley is seen a convent, which we were informed is dedicated to our Lady of the Mountain. All the buildings being white, formed very conspicuous, and not unpleasing objects in the landscape. The mountains in this island are very high. Pico Ruevo is supposed to be from its base near a mile in perpendicular height, much higher than any land in England or Wales. The sides of all the hills are well covered to a certain height with vines, above which, to a vast extent, are woods of pine, chesnut, and a variety of other trees unknown to Europe. The principal refreshments to be procured here are wine, water, and onions; the latter are the finest in the world, and in great plenty.  It being the Admiral's determination to lose no time, we only lay-to off Funchial, till the wine intended for the use of the officers and ship's company was taken on board; and it being the birth day of the Queen of Portugal, we saluted the fort in honour of the day with twenty-one guns, which was returned with an equal number. In the evening we made sail for our destination; and fortunately from this time had a fair wind till we got into the trades. On the 24th we passed the tropic of Cancer, lat. at noon 23. 21. N. long. 32. W. The usual ceremony was observed by the crew (having first obtained the Captain's permission): a grotesque Neptune and Amphitrité were drawn by their attendants on the quarter-deck, where, after a solemn ditty chaunted by his aquatic majesty, the usual collections were made, which, from the munificence of the General and his friends, together with the contributions of those officers of the ship who had never crossed the tropic before, amounted to a sum sufficient to supply the ship's company with plenty of vegetables on their arrival at Barbadoes.  The 25th of December, being Christmas day, divine service was performed on the quarter-deck by the Chaplain, the crew appearing as on a Sunday, in clean trowsers and jackets: and here I must beg leave to mention, that I never saw more regularity and decorum in any place of worship than is invariably observed on board of his Majesty's ships of war.  This day we passed an American brig; and the weather being fair, Lieutenant Bowen and Captain Mason went on board her. She was from Cadiz, and reported, that yesterday she passed a Spanish man of war bound for Europe.  On the 26th of December we saw several albicores, dolphins, and grampus, and shoals of flying fish; lat. at noon 22. 10. N. long. 34. 46. W.  On the 29th of December, being Sunday, and the weather fair, divine service was performed as usual.  The heat of the climate now began to be troublesome to those who had been unaccustomed to it.  On Monday the 6th of January, 1794, land was discovered from the mast-head, which proved to be the island of Barbadoes; and by noon the Boyne anchored in Carlisle Bay[1].       [1] On our arrival we found several of the ships that had parted      company on the voyage; and each day after brought more of them,      till the whole were collected.    CHAPTER II.      THE COMMANDERS IN CHIEF PREPARE FOR THE EXPEDITION AGAINST      MARTINIQUE ... GUN-BOATS CONSTRUCTED, AND DESCRIBED ... A SHORT      ACCOUNT OF BARBADOES ... SALE OF SLAVES ... A LIST OF THE FLEET.   The first news we received on our arrival at Barbadoes was, that the yellow fever had, in the course of last year, carried off fifty-eight officers of the army in this and the neighbouring islands, and privates in proportion. It proved fatal to great numbers of the inhabitants also of Barbadoes; from fifteen to twenty whites died daily in the town of Bridgetown,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38178"],["title","An Account of the Campaign in the West Indies, in the Year 1794 (#3)"],["body"," and about half that number of blacks and people of colour. We were at the same time comforted with an assurance that the disease had entirely subsided; but the reader will soon see how fallacious were our hopes in this respect. Alas! too many families have to lament the fatal effects of this dreadful disorder; and the kingdom at large may attribute to it the losses we afterwards sustained, rather than to any other cause. But of this more hereafter.  His Excellency Sir Charles Grey landed at Bridgetown on the 7th of January, and resided at a house called the Government House, on Constitution Hill, a healthy situation, about half a mile out of town, where he was busily employed during his residence on the island in concerting plans for future operations, in reviewing the troops, and providing against those exigencies which in an enemy's country an army must be exposed to. A report was here circulated that General Rochambeau the commanding officer at Martinique, and Bellegarde the popular leader of the people of colour, were at variance; but this news by no means caused the least relaxation on the part of our commanders, who continued their preparations with as much ardour as before; and it is well they did so, as we afterwards found the enemy on their guard, and prepared to resist us with their united force.  The Admiral in the mean time was equally employed in preparing every thing in his department, and for that purpose remained on board (a conduct he invariably followed), by which every thing was carried on under his own inspection, and delay (the consequence of neglect) was thus prevented.--On our voyage, whenever the weather permitted, a certain number of seamen were exercised, and formed into companies, to be commanded by lieutenants of the navy, with the rank of captains on shore. While in Carlisle Bay these seamen were again exercised, and instructed in the use of small arms and pikes. This plan of training the seamen for more duty was highly beneficial on this expedition, as will hereafter appear.  Every exertion was now made both by sea and land. The gun-boats, which were constructed in England, then taken to pieces, and brought to the West Indies in storeships, were put together with as much speed as possible; yet, from the nature of their structure, could not be finished until a day or two before we sailed. There were six gun-boats, each carrying a twenty-four pounder in the bow, which moved backwards and forwards on a groove: round the whole on the gun-whale was a moveable barricade or breast-work, composed of several folds of bulls' hides, nailed to some boards of an inch thick in partitions, and capable of turning a musket ball. Each boat had two masts; the foremast inclined forward (to give more room for the gun to recoil), and had a latine sail and jib: the mizen was a lug-sail. Sweeps, or large oars, were also supplied, to be used when there was no wind, or when becalmed by the high lands near the shore. Each of these vessels was at first commanded by a midshipman, who, as his conduct merited, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant[2].       [2] I have given an exact representation of one of these boats in      the view of the town and bay of St. Pierre.  In the mean time the troops were landed from the transports, the sick comfortably lodged in the hospitals, and every attention paid, to render the service complete. As the major part of our army consisted of the flank companies, great pains were taken by the commanding officers to train them for the most active service: the light infantry were exercised daily by Major General Dundas, who had, in America and on the continent, distinguished himself at the head of that battalion. Particular attention was paid to instruct the army in the absolute necessity of strict obedience to orders; for which purpose the Commander in Chief published in the general orders to the army such full and comprehensive instructions, as to preclude the necessity of multiplying them in future, and to take away the possibility of any one pleading ignorance of them[3].       [3] See in the Appendix, page 1.  Before we quit this island, it may be agreeable to the reader to have some account of it, and of the general appearance of the country. Barbadoes is situated in 13. 10. N. lat. and 59. W. long. from London. It is called one of the British Charaibé Islands, though at present none of those ancient inhabitants remain on it. The island has a flat appearance; but, from the variety of plantations, the beauty and freshness of the verdure, and the numerous houses, mills, and other buildings, scattered in great profusion, it presents a delightful prospect to strangers on their approach to it after a long voyage. I shall not pretend to give an history of the island, but must refer the reader to the elegant work of Bryan Edwards, Esq. whose account of the British West India Islands is written with every advantage to be derived from local residence and connections, as well as from the indefatigable attention and abilities of the author.  During our residence at this island curiosity led me to be present at a sale of slaves, just imported from the coast of Africa. As this horrid traffic in human flesh has been the topic of public investigation for some time past, and much learning and ingenuity has been displayed on both sides of the question, I shall not give any opinion on it, but merely state facts that came within my own knowledge. The sale is proclaimed by beat of drum, and is held (at Barbadoes at least) not in the open air, as I had been taught to believe, but in a commodious house appointed for that purpose. At the time I am speaking of, there were about forty men, women, and children, sitting on benches round a large room, with no other covering than a cloth round their waists. Some of them were decorated with beads, given to them by their captors, and bracelets round their wrists and ancles, and were much tattooed on their faces and breasts, which I understood from a seaman who came with them, was a mark of distinction in their own country. I was also informed that they had buried one hundred and forty-nine on the passage, having had a very bad and protracted voyage: the crew had suffered equally, and had buried one third of their original complement. As soon as the planter has fixed on a slave he retires with him and the salesman to another room, there concludes the bargain, and departs with his purchase to his plantation, where the newcomer, being clothed in a coarse jacket, and provided with a hat, knife, and other trifles, is placed with one of the old negroes, by whom he is instructed in his business. In regard to the severity exercised by the slave owners on their slaves, whatever may have been the case, I am well assured that now there are seldom instances of those cruelties which have been so feelingly described, at least in the islands we visited on this expedition. At Barbadoes they appeared to be in as comfortable a situation as the lower ranks of society generally are; and as the climate is peculiarly favourable to poverty (clothes and firing, the great articles of expence to the poor in other countries, being here hardly required), I may venture to affirm, that the slaves in the West Indies are in a better situation, _as to the necessaries of life_, than the labouring poor in England, or any other country in Europe. Far be it from me, however, to justify slavery in itself; it most certainly is an evil: but when a matter of great importance is in agitation, every information should be obtained, and both sides of the question ought to be strictly examined. Certainly the benevolent intentions of the friends to the abolition of slavery in the West Indies have, by their exertions in the cause of humanity, occasioned a more minute inquiry into the situation of the slaves than had ever been made before; and several excellent laws to regulate the treatment of that unfortunate class of human beings have in consequence been passed in the different islands. It is affirmed by many very humane people, that the entire abolition of the traffic _itself_ would not help the cause of humanity so much as was at first contended (for I believe the former plan of immediately emancipating those already imported, is allowed by all to be dangerous in the extreme); and it is the opinion of many writers, that the greater part of those Africans sold to our plantations would remain slaves in their own country, or be put to death by their captors. If so, surely it is better for them to be carried to a country where they have a chance at least of better treatment, and where many of them are instructed in their duty to their God, of which before they had no idea.  While we were lying in Carlisle Bay the fleet that sailed with us from Europe, and parted company on the voyage, came in, together with the transports, &c. from Ireland. The following is, I believe, a correct list of the men of war that composed our fleet at the commencement of the campaign. A few others that are hereafter mentioned joined us in the course of it.
