YOUNGMAN     INTRODUCTION   Two species of pocket gophers of the genus _Thomomys_ (Family Geomyidae) occur in Colorado, _Thomomys bottae_ (see fig. 1) in the low valleys in the south-central and southwestern parts of the state and _Thomomys talpoides_ mainly in the mountains and high valleys.  _Thomomys bottae_ occurs primarily in the Pi匾n-juniper, Ponderosa Pine, and Short Grass zones of Daubenmire (1943) but in some localities is found in the Douglas Fir Zone. _Thomomys talpoides_ occupies primarily the Douglas Fir Zone and Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Spruce Zone but is found also in the Pi匾n-juniper and Short Grass zones in some localities.  The ranges of the two species do not overlap in the strict sense but interdigitate in a parapatric type of distribution.  Two other pocket gophers, _Geomys bursarius_ and _Cratogeomys castanops_, also occur in Colorado--in the Upper Sonoran Life-Zone. _Geomys bursarius_ occupies much of the Great Plains, whereas _Cratogeomys castanops_ is found only on the plains in the southeastern part of the state.  The objectives of the study, reported on here, were to learn the geographic distribution of _Thomomys bottae_ in Colorado, to find means for recognizing the different subspecies, and to describe individual and geographic variation.  I am indebted to Mr. Sydney Anderson and Professor E. Raymond Hall for many helpful suggestions and for their critical reading of the manuscript, to Dr. Richard S. Miller, who made the collection of many of the specimens possible, and to Dr. Richard M. Hansen for numerous suggestions. I wish to express my appreciation also to the following for the loan of specimens in their care: Alfred M. Bailey and A. A. Rogers, Colorado Museum of Natural History, Denver, Colorado; David H. Johnson, United States National Museum, Washington, D. C; Robert W. Lechleitner, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado; and Robert Z. Brown, Colorado College, Colorado Springs, Colorado.     METHODS   Adults of approximately equal age were compared in the study of geographic variation. Three criteria of adulthood are: (a) suture obliterated between supraoccipital and exoccipital, (b) suture at least partly obliterated between basisphenoid and basioccipital, (c) supraorbital crests not widely separated and almost parallel. In males the crests encroach on the lateral borders of the interparietal; in females the crests approach the lateral borders of the interparietal but are more widely separated than in males.

As noted by Grinnell (1931:4), males vary more than females, especially in length of rostrum and associated nasal measurements.  Color terms are those of Munsell (1954). Color measurements were standardized by the use of a single 100 watt General Electric blue daylight bulb in a 12 inch white reflector suspended 24 inches above the specimen. All other light was excluded. The individual hairs of _Thomomys bottae_ are either bicolored or tricolored. The darkness of a specimen often may be attributed to the presence of dark-tipped hairs. The color given in the description is the basic reddish or yellowish color of the hairs. The presence of a grizzled effect or a dark dorsal stripe, or any other pattern resulting from dark hairs, is noted in the remarks.  Specimens examined are listed by counties in the following order:    Mesa   Montrose   San Miguel   Dolores   Montezuma   La Plata   Archuleta   Conejos   Chaffee   Fremont   El Paso   Pueblo   Custer   Huerfano   Alamosa   Las Animas  Localities are listed from north to south within a county. If two localities lie on the same line of latitude, the western precedes the eastern. Localities omitted on the map in order to prevent overlapping of symbols are in Italics. Unless otherwise indicated, specimens are in the University of Kansas, Museum of Natural History. The following initials are used to designate specimens in other collections:  CSU--Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado.  CMNH--Colorado Museum of Natural History, Denver, Colorado.  ERW--E. R. Warren Collection, Colorado College, Colorado Springs,     Colorado.  USNM--United States National Museum, Washington, D. C.  The following measurements of the skull are listed in the tables:  _Condylobasal length._--The shortest distance between the anteriormost projections of the premaxillaries and a line touching the posterior surfaces of the exoccipital condyles.  _Length of nasals._--The distance from the most anterior projection of the nasal bones to the most posterior projection of a nasal bone.  _Zygomatic breadth._--The greatest distance across the zygomatic arches, at right angles to the long axis of the skull.  _Squamosal breadth._--The greatest distance between the mastoidal processes of the squamosal.  _Length of rostrum._--The shortest distance from the shallow notch that lies lateral to the hamulus of the lacrymal bone, to the tip of the nasal on the same side of the skull.  _Breadth of rostrum._--The greatest width of the rostrum, anterior to the maxillae, transverse to the long axis of the skull.  _Alveolar length of upper maxillary tooth-row._--Distance between the anterior margin of the alveolus of the first cheek-tooth and the posterior margin of the alveolus of the last upper cheek-tooth, on one side of the skull.  _Least interorbital breadth._--The least distance across the frontal bones at the interorbital constriction as seen in dorsal view.     PHYSIOGRAPHY   _Thomomys bottae_ occurs in the Colorado Plateau Province (terminology of Fenneman, 1931), the Southern Rocky Mountain Province and a small part of the Great Plains Province.  The Colorado Plateau Province, in the southwestern part of the state, is mostly above 5000 feet and is characterized by the great number of canyons cut by rivers and streams in the nearly horizontal strata. Prominent features of the landscape are cuestas, such as Mesa Verde, and laccoliths, such as Ute Peak.  The Southern Rocky Mountain Province consists mainly of high granitic mountains running north and south, many of which extend to more than 14,000 feet above sea level. Included in this region are several large basins, such as North Park and South Park and the San Luis Valley. The San Juan Mountains, which separate the Colorado Plateau Province from the San Luis Valley, and the Sangre De Cristo and Wet mountains, which intervene between the San Luis Valley and the Great Plains, importantly influence the distribution of _Thomomys bottae_.  The Great Plains Province is a broad highland that slopes gradually eastward from the Rocky Mountains. Of importance to the present study are two subdivisions of the Great Plains, the Colorado Piedmont and the Raton Section.  The Colorado Piedmont is a much dissected fluviatile plain, roughly extending from the vicinity of the Arkansas River to the northern boundary of the state. In general the topography of the Colorado Piedmont is broadly rolling with greater relief than the high plains to the east; however, buttes and steep bluffs occur locally.  The Raton Section imperceptibly blends into the southern boundary of the Colorado Piedmont and extends south into New Mexico and Texas. A trenched peniplane of greater relief and altitude than the Colorado Piedmont, it is characterized by high mesas, extensive dissected lava-capped plateaus, deep canyons, and mountains of volcanic origin.     GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION   Six subspecies of _Thomomys bottae_ occur in Colorado. _T. b. aureus_ and _T. b. howelli_ occupy the Colorado Plateau Province (see fig. 1) and are characterized by a yellowish color; nasals posteriorly truncate or rounded; posterior extensions of premaxillae long; basioccipital wide; and interpterygoid space U-shaped with a median spicule.  _T. b. internatus_, _T. b. cultellus_, and a new subspecies from the vicinity of Ca匾n City described on page 376, inhabit the Sangre De Cristo and Wet mountains in the Southern Rocky Mountain Province and adjacent parts of the Colorado Piedmont and Raton Section of the Great Plains Province (see fig. 1). This group of closely related subspecies is characterized by reddish color; posterior margins of nasals forming a V; posterior extensions of premaxillae short; basioccipital narrow; and interpterygoid space V-shaped, lacking a median spicule.  _T. b. pervagus_ occupies part of the San Luis Valley to the west of the Rio Grande (see fig. 1). In Colorado _T. b. pervagus_ is isolated from _T. b. internatus_ and _T. b. cultellus_ by the Sangre De Cristo and Culebra ranges and is separated from _T. b. aureus_ by the San Juan Mountains. _T. b. pervagus_ occupies an area geographically intermediate between _T. b. aureus_ to the west and _T. b. internatus_ and _T. b. cultellus_ to the east and has some characters in common with these subspecies. _T. b."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37317"],["title","Geographic Variation in the Pocket Gopher, Thomomys bottae, in Colorado (#1)"],["body","resembles _T. b. aureus_ in having long posterior extensions of the premaxillae and in sometimes having rounded posterior margins of the nasals. _T. b. pervagus_ resembles _T. b. internatus_ and _T. b. cultellus_ in color, the presence of a V-shaped interpterygoid space, and a narrow basioccipital. Kelson (1951:69) has pointed out that in New Mexico the separation of the ranges of _T. b. pervagus_ and _T. b. cultellus_ is probably complete, but probably incomplete between _T. b. pervagus_ and _T. b. aureus_. Nevertheless, the similarities between _T. b. pervagus_ and _T. b. cultellus_ and _T. b. internatus_ suggest that _T. b. pervagus_ was originally derived from the more eastern stock.  _T. b. aureus_ is a variable subspecies which, according to Durrant (1952:211), intergrades with _T. b. howelli_ in Utah. Specimens of _T. b. aureus_ showing the greatest amount of geographic variation cranially are from the ecotone between the Pi匾n-juniper and Douglas Fir zones at the edge of the range of the subspecies.  _T. b. howelli_ is a markedly distinct subspecies that shows certain similarities to _T. b. aureus_, but the degree of cranial difference from _T. b. aureus_ suggests an isolation of long duration, or a rapid evolution from the parent stock.  _T. b. internatus_ and _T. b. cultellus_ probably intergrade east of the Sangre De Cristo Range in the vicinity of the Colorado-New Mexico boundary. The amount of intergradation is obscured by the great amount of geographic variation occurring in _T. bottae_ at the edge of the plains and by the lack of specimens from this area.  _T. b. internatus_ is a widespread subspecies showing its greatest variation at the edge of the plains. This area is an ecotone between the coniferous forest and the grassland and is by nature an area of change owing to the alternation of wet and dry periods such as the pluvial, interpluvial, and postpluvial periods. This seems to support Durrant's observation (1952:496) that \"the greatest range of morphological variation is in animals from the least stable environments.\"  Specimens from a small area north of the Arkansas River in the vicinity of Ca匾n City (see fig. 1) differ sufficiently from _T. b. internatus_ to be given nominal recognition. High mountains and the Arkansas River isolate the new subspecies found at Ca匾n City from populations of _T. b. internatus_ to the west and south; however there are no apparent geographic barriers between the newly named subspecies and populations of _T. b. internatus_ twelve miles to the north or from the vicinity of Pueblo to the east. This new subspecies is the most extreme of the variants occurring in the unstable environment at the edge of the plains.   =Thomomys bottae aureus= Allen      _Thomomys aureus_ Allen, Bull. Amer.

Rowley.    _Distribution._--Colorado Plateau Province of southwestern Colorado   (see fig. 1), northwestern New Mexico, southeastern Utah, and   northeastern Arizona.    _Distinctive characters._--Size large (see measurements); usually   pale in western part of range, dark in eastern part; posterior   extensions of premaxillae long, wide, and deeply serrated; posterior   margins of nasals truncate or slightly rounded (see fig. 2);   interpterygoid space U-shaped, with median spicule; basioccipital   wide; bullae well inflated, rounded ventrally.    _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _T. b. howelli_ and _T. b.   pervagus_, see accounts of those subspecies.  _Remarks._--_T. b. aureus_ is a variable subspecies, which differs considerably from _T. b. internatus_, _T. b. cultellus_, and _T. b. rubidus_ and includes several microgeographic races distinguishable to a taxonomist specializing in the group. These slightly varying populations are here not considered sufficiently distinct for nominal recognition.  Characters such as color of the pelage and conformation of the bullae and zygomatic arches vary with the locality, and to some extent vary among specimens from a single locality.  The name _Thomomys bottae optabilis_, given to specimens from Coventry by Goldman (1936:116), is here placed in synonymy under _T. b. aureus_ Allen. The characters originally used to describe _T. b. optabilis_ are of the type that vary between populations only a few miles apart, or often vary within a population. The skulls of specimens from Coventry are not lighter in structure than those of _T. b. aureus_. The premaxillae are not narrower, nor is the frontal region narrower or more constricted than in _T. b. aureus_.  The name _Thomomys bottae apache_, given to specimens from Lake La Jara, New Mexico, by Bailey (1910:79), and later applied to specimens from Colorado by Bailey (1915:75), is here also placed in synonymy under _T. b. aureus_. Specimens from Lake La Jara, New Mexico, and nearby localities in Colorado may be separated from topotypes of _T. b. aureus_ on the basis of color only. The topotypes of _T. b. aureus_ are mostly pale; some, however, are dark. The number of pale specimens in any given series decreases gradually in a clinal pattern from west to east. Since there is no noticeable step in the cline and since all specimens show close cranial similarity, it is felt that nominal recognition of the darker specimens does not present a realistic picture of the relationships of the relatively unisolated populations in the Colorado Plateau Province.  Since _Thomomys bottae_ in the Colorado Plateau Province is especially plastic, varying from locality to locality, emphasis is here placed on similarities that unite specimens from different localities. The individual and microgeographic variations are outlined below.  Specimens from Bedrock have zygomatic arches that are heavy anteriorly. Specimens from Coventry are dorsally almost uniformly Strong Brown (7.5YR 5/6) and lack a strong dorsal stripe. The venters are Reddish Yellow (7.5YR 8/6). Specimens from 15 miles west of Cortez are the palest specimens of _T. b. aureus_ from Colorado, and closely resemble topotypes. The basic color varies from Reddish Yellow (7.5YR 7/6 and 6/6) to Strong Brown (7.5YR 5/6). Specimens are marked with a narrow dark dorsal stripe. The venters are white. Specimens from Ute Peak and Cortez have Reddish Yellow (7.5YR 6/6) flanks and are slightly darker dorsally. Many specimens from Mesa Verde are indistinguishable from specimens from Coventry and from Cortez. Others have dark diffuse dorsal stripes. The venters are Pink (7.5YR 7/4) or Pinkish White (7.5YR 8/2). Some specimens from the Mancos River have wide dorsal stripes. Specimens from three miles west of Durango have especially wide-spreading zygomatic arches posteriorly and have wide black dorsal stripes. The venters are Pink (7.5YR 7/4). One specimen from Florida is dark and grizzled and has a dark dorsal stripe. Another specimen is pale and has only a small dorsal stripe. Specimens from 12 miles west of Pagosa Springs have thin rostra and diffuse dorsal stripes. Specimens from Bondad have a V-shaped interpterygoid space and in it a small median spicule. One specimen is uniformly grizzled and lacks a dorsal stripe, giving an overall effect of Dark Yellowish Brown (10YR 3/3). Another specimen has Strong Brown (7.5YR 5/6) flanks and is only slightly darker dorsally.    _Specimens examined._--Total 114. _Colorado_: Montrose Co.: West   Paradox Valley, 5 (CMNH); Bedrock, 5150 ft., 5 (ERW); Coventry,   6800 ft., 14 (12 ERW, 2 USNM).
