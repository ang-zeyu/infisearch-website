First we passed through the beautiful World of Spirits, where it is always summer. This part of the way was quite pleasant, but on the farther side of that world we came to a fearful abyss. It could be crossed only on a large slippery wheel, as slippery as ice.\"  \"I mounted this wheel and was whirled across the chasm. No sooner had I reached the other side than new terrors came upon me. I had to pass by great cauldrons of boiling oil, in which seals were swimming about.\"  \"A misstep would have sent me plunging into the boiling oil, and you would have lost your Angakok forever!\"  The thought of this was so dreadful that the Angakok paused and wiped his eyes. Then he went on again with his story.  \"However, with great courage I kept upon my way until at last I saw the Old Woman's house! A deep gulf lay between us and her dwelling, and outside it stood a great dog with bloody jaws. This dog guards the entrance, and he sleeps only for a single moment, once in a very great while.\"  \"For six days I and my Tornak waited there for the dog to sleep. At last on the seventh day he closed his eyes! Instantly the Tornak seized my hand and drew me across the bridge which spanned the chasm. This bridge was as narrow as a single thread.\"  \"When we were safely across the bridge we passed the sleeping dog and boldly entered the Old Woman's house. The Old Woman is terrible to look upon! Her hand is the size of a large walrus, and her teeth like the rocks along the coast!\" The Angakok dropped his voice to a whisper.  \"However, when she looked upon me she trembled!\" he said. \"She saw at once that I possessed great power, and was a great Angakok. I spoke to her flattering words. Then I told her of the hunger of my children!\"  \"I begged that she would send the seal and walrus and sea-birds to our coast at once. But she had no mind to yield to my requests. Then I stormed and threatened.\" The Angakok's voice grew louder. \"The walls shook with the thunder of my voice! At last I seized her by the hair! I tipped over the saucer with my foot! My great power prevailed against the mighty sorceress!\"  \"The seal and walrus swam away. The birds flew into the air and were gone. I had conquered the Old Woman of the Sea! My children were saved!\" The Angakok was silent for a moment. Then he spoke again in a natural voice.  \"When I opened my eyes in my own igloo again,\" he said, \"the famine was already over. Flocks of sea-birds were flying overhead. The sea swarmed with fish, and with walrus and seal. Every one along the whole coast was happy. Ask yourselves--is it not so?\"  The Angakok seemed very much pleased with himself, and he looked about, as if he expected every one else to be pleased with him too. All the people were filled with wonder at his great power. They began to talk among themselves.  \"Yes, I remember the famine well,\" said Koko's father. \"I was away up the coast that season. Several died in our village for lack of food.\"  Other men remembered things about other times when food had been scarce.  \"It is lucky,\" they said to each other, \"that here we have a great Angakok who understands all the secrets of the World and who can save us from such dreadful things.\"   IV.  At last Kesshoo said, \"Will you tell us, great Angakok, how you make these wonderful journeys?\"  \"Do you really wish to know?\" asked the Angakok. \"If you do, I will summon my guiding spirits to tell you, but they will speak only in the darkness.\"  Kesshoo took the lamp at once and put it out in the tunnel. Then he placed a thick musk-ox hide over the entrance, so that not a single ray of light came into the room. The darkness could almost be felt. Everybody sat very still and listened.  Soon a heavy body was heard to strike the floor with a dull thud, and a strange voice said, \"Who calls me?\"  Another voice said, \"You are called, mighty spirits, to tell these children of the labors of their Angakok.\"  Then began all sorts of strange noises, as of different persons speaking. All the voices sounded much like the Angakok's, and they all said what a great medicine man the Angakok was, and how every one in the village must be sure to do what he told them to!  At last the Angakok himself spoke, in his own voice. \"I will tell you how I make these strange journeys,\" he said.  \"My body is now lying on the floor at your feet. Now I begin to rise. You cannot see me. You cannot touch me. Now I am floating about your heads, now I am touching the roof! I can go wherever I please! Nothing can stop me! I know the secret places of the sun, moon, and stars. I can fly through the roof and go at once to the moon, if I wish to.\"  Then the voice was still. Nobody moved or spoke.  Monnie had gone to sleep in the corner of the bed, but Koko and Menie were still awake. They had listened to every word about the Old Woman of the Sea, and how the Angakok traveled to the moon.  You know I told you before that Koko was six. He wanted to know all about things. So he spoke right out in the dark, when every one else was still.  He said, \"Mother, if the Angakok can go anywhere he wants to, why couldn't he get out of the tunnel?\"  Koko's mother tried to hush him up. \"Sh, sh,\" she said, and put her hand over his mouth. At least she thought she did, but she made a mistake in the dark and put her hand over Menie's mouth instead!  Menie tried to say, \"I never said a word,\" but he could only make queer sounds, because Koko's mother's hand was tight on his mouth.  Of course Koko didn't know his mother was trying to keep him still, so he said again, \"Why is it, mother?\"  Koko's mother heard Koko's voice speaking just as plainly as ever though she was sure she had her hand over his mouth! She was frightened.  \"Magic! magic!\" she screamed. \"Bring the light! Koko is bewitched! I have my hand over his mouth, yet you hear that he talks as plainly as ever!\"  Koko tried to say, \"Your hand isn't over my mouth,\" and Menie tried to say, \"It's over mine!\" but he could only say, \"M-m-m,\" because she held on so tight!  Koko's mother was making so much noise herself that she wouldn't have heard what either one said anyway. The baby woke up and whimpered. Nip and Tup woke up and barked like everything.  Kesshoo got the light from the tunnel as quickly as he could, and set it on the bench. Then every one saw what was the matter! They all laughed--all but Menie and the Angakok. The Angakok said to Koko's father, \"You'd better look after that boy. He is disrespectful to me. That is a bad beginning!\"  Koko's father was ashamed of him. He said, \"Koko is so small!\"  But the Angakok said, \"Koko is six. He is old enough to know better.\"   V.  Everybody was so glad to see the light again that they all began to talk at once.  Some one said to Kesshoo, \"Tell us about the long journey to the south you took once long ago.\"  Then everybody else listened, while Kesshoo told about how once he had taken his dog sledge with a load of musk-ox and seal skins on it far down the coast and how at last he had come to a little settlement where the houses were all made of wood, if they would believe it!  He told them that in the bay before the village there was a boat as big as the Big Rock itself. It had queer white wings, and the wind blew on these wings and made the boat go!  Kesshoo had been out in a kyak to see it. He had even paddled all round it. The men on the great boat had fair hair, and one of them, the chief man of all, had bought some of Kesshoo's skins and one of his dogs. The man was a great chief. His name was Nansen.  This great chief had told Kesshoo that he was going to take a sledge and go straight into the inland country where the Giants live! He said he was going to cross the great ice! No man had ever done that since the world began.  Kesshoo thought probably the great chief had been eaten by the Giants, but he did not know surely, because he had never been back there since to find out. And to be sure, if he had been eaten by Giants, no one ever would know about it anyway.  Then Kesshoo showed them all a great knife that the white chief had given him, in exchange for a sealskin, and two steel needles that he had sent to Koolee. Koolee kept the needles in a little ivory case all by themselves.  She always carried the case in her kamik, so it would not be lost. She could do wonderful sewing with the needles. Koolee was very proud of her sewing. No one else in the whole village could sew so well, because they had not such good needles to do it with. Koolee used them only for her very finest work.  At last the Angakok said, \"It is time to go home.\" He called to his wives. They climbed down off the bench.  That started the others. One after another they put on their upper garments, which they had taken off in the warm igloo, said good bye, and popped down into the tunnel. Last of all came the Angakok's turn.  Then Kesshoo and Koolee and the Angakok's wives all began to look very anxious. The Angakok looked a little worried himself. If he had stuck coming in, what would happen now after he had eaten so much!  He got down on his hands and knees, and looked at the hole. He had taken off his thick fur coat when he came in. Now he took off his undercoat, and his thick fur trousers! He gave them to his wives.  Then he stretched himself out just as long as he possibly could and slowly hitched himself down into the tunnel, groaning all the way.  Kesshoo and Koolee and the wives waited until his feet disappeared, and they heard him scraping along through the tunnel. Then they breathed a great sigh of relief, and the two wives popped down after him.  The last Kesshoo and Koolee heard of the Angakok, was a kind of muffled roar when a piece of ice fell from the top of the tunnel on to his bare back.  Menie and Monnie and the pups were already sound asleep in their corner of the bench when their father and mother fixed the lamp for the night and crawled in among the fur robes beside them.     VI.  THE REINDEER "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3774"],["title","The Eskimo Twins (#6)"],["body","THE REINDEER HUNT  I.   The day after the feast it was still very cold, but there were signs of spring in the air. When Menie went out to feed the dogs, he saw a flock of ravens flying north, and Koko saw some sea-birds on the same day.  Two days after that, when the twins and Koko were all three playing together on the Big Rock, they saw a huge iceberg float lazily by.  It had broken away from a glacier, farther north, and was drifting slowly toward the Southern Sea. It gleamed in the sun like a great ice palace.  One morning the air was thick with fog. When Kesshoo saw the fog he said, \"This would be a great day to hunt reindeer.\"  \"Oh, let me go with you!\" cried Menie.  Monnie knew better than to ask. She knew very well she would never be allowed to go.  Kesshoo thought a little before he answered. Then he said, \"If Koko's father will go, too, you and Koko may both go with us. You are pretty small to go hunting, but boys cannot begin too early to learn.\"  Menie was wild with joy. He rushed to Koko's house and told him and his father what Kesshoo had said.  When he had finished, Koko's father said at once, \"Tell Kesshoo we will go.\"  It was not long before they were ready to start. Kesshoo had his great bow, and arrows, and a spear. He also had his bird dart. Koko's father had his bow and spear and dart, too. Menie had his little bow and arrows.  Kesshoo put a harness on Tooky and tied the end of Tooky's harness trace around Menie's waist. Koko's father had brought his best dog, too, and Koko was fastened to the end of that dog's harness in the same way.  Then the four hunters started on their journey--Menie and Koko driving the dogs in front of them.  Monnie stood on the Big Rock and watched them until they were out of sight in the fog. Nip and Tup were with her. They wanted to go as much as Monnie did and she had hard work to keep them from following after the hunters.   II.  Kesshoo knew very well where to look for the reindeer. He led the way up a steep gorge where the first green moss appeared in the spring. They all four walked quietly along for several miles.  When they got nearly to the head of the gorge, Kesshoo stopped. He said to the boys, \"You must not make any noise yourselves, and you must not let the dogs bark. If you do there will be no reindeer today.\"  The boys kept very still, indeed. The dogs were good hunting dogs. They knew better than to bark.  They walked on a little farther. Then Kesshoo came very near the others and spoke in a low voice. He said, \"We are coming to a spot where there are likely to be reindeer. The wind is from the south. If we keep on in this direction, the reindeer will smell us. We must go round in such a way that the wind will carry the scent from them to us, not from us to them.\"  They turned to the right and went round to the north. They had gone only a short distance in this direction, when they found fresh reindeer tracks in the snow. The dogs began to sniff and strain at their harnesses.  \"They smell the game,\" whispered Kesshoo. \"Hold on tight! Don't let them run.\"  Menie and Koko held the dogs back as hard as they could. Kesshoo and Koko's father crept forward with their bows in their hands. The fog was so thick they could not see very far before them.  They had gone only a short distance, when out of the fog loomed two great gray shadows. Instantly the two men dropped on their knees and took careful aim.  The reindeer did not see them. They did not know that anything was near until they felt the sting of the hunters' arrows. One reindeer dropped to the earth. The other was not killed. He flung his head in the air and galloped away, and they could hear the thud, thud, of his hoofs long after he had disappeared in the fog.  The moment the dogs heard the singing sound of the arrows, they bounded forward. Koko and Menie were not strong enough to hold them back, and they could not run fast enough to keep up with them. So they just bumped along behind the dogs! Some of the time they slid through the snow.  The snow was rough and hard, and it hurt a good deal to be dragged through it as if they were sledges, but Eskimo boys are used to bumps, and they knew if they cried they might scare the game, so they never even whimpered.  It was lucky for them that they had not far to go. When they came bumping along, Kesshoo and Koko's father laughed at them.  \"Don't be in such a hurry,\" they called. \"There's plenty of time!\"  They unbound the traces from Menie and Koko and hitched the dogs to the body of the reindeer. Then they all started back to the village with Koko's father driving the dogs.  Soon the fog lifted and the sky grew clear.  Monnie was playing with her doll in the igloo, when she heard Tooky bark. She knew it was Tooky at once. She and Koolee both plunged into the tunnel like mice down a mouse hole. Nip and Tup were ahead of them.  Outside they found Koko's mother and the baby. Koolee called to her, and she called to the wives of the Angakok, who were scraping a bear's skin in the snow.  The Angakok's wives, and Koko's mother and her baby, and Koolee, and Monnie, and Nip and Tup all ran to meet the hunters, and you never saw two prouder boys than Koko and Menie when they showed the reindeer to their mothers.  The mothers were proud of their young hunters, too. Koolee said, \"Soon we shall have another man in our family.\"  When they were quite near the village again, they met the Angakok. He had been trying to catch up with them and he was out of breath from running. He looked at them sternly.  \"Why didn't you call me?\" he panted.  His wives looked frightened and didn't say a word. Nobody else said anything. The Angakok glared at them all for a moment. Then he poked the reindeer with his fingers to see if it was fat and said to the men, \"Which portion am I to have?\"  \"Would you like the liver?\" asked Kesshoo. He remembered about the bear's liver, you see.  But the Angakok looked offended. \"Who will have the stomach?\" he said. \"You know very well that the stomach is the best part of a reindeer.\"  \"Take the stomach, by all means, then,\" said Kesshoo, politely.  Koolee and Monnie looked very much disappointed. They wanted the stomach dreadfully.  But the Angakok answered, \"Since you urge me, I will take the stomach. I had a dream last night, and in the dream I was told by my Tornak that today I should feed upon a reindeer's stomach, given me by one of my grateful children. When you think how I suffered to bring food to you, I am sure you will wish to provide me with whatever it seems best that I should have.\"  He stood by while Kesshoo and Koko's father skinned the reindeer and cut it in pieces. Then he took the stomach and disappeared into his igloo--with his face all wreathed in smiles.     VII.  WHAT HAPPENED WHEN MENIE AND KOKO WENT HUNTING BY THEMSELVES  WHAT HAPPENED WHEN MENIE AND KOKO WENT HUNTING BY THEMSELVES  I.   It was very lucky for the twins that their father was such a brave and skillful kyak man. You will see the reason why, when I tell you the story of the day Menie and Koko went hunting alone on the ice.  One April morning Kesshoo was working on his kyak to make sure that it was in perfect order for the spring walrus hunting. Koko and Menie watched him for a long time. Monnie was with Koolee in the hut.  By and by Koko said to Menie, \"Let's go out on the ice and hunt for seal-holes.\"  \"All right,\" said Menie. \"You take your bow and arrows and I'll take my spear. Maybe we shall see some little auks.\"  Koko had a little bow made of deer's horns, and some bone arrows, and Menie had a small spear which his father had made for him out of driftwood.  \"I'll tell you!\" said Menie. \"Let's go hunting just the way father does! You do the shooting and I'll do the spearing! Won't everybody be surprised to see us bring home a great load of game? I shall give everything I get to my mother.\"  \"I'm going to hunt birds and seal-holes too,\" Koko answered.  Kesshoo was very busy fixing the fastening of his harpoon, and he did not hear what they said.  The two boys went to their homes for their weapons, and then ran out on the ice. Nobody knew where they were. Of course, Nip and Tup went along.   II.  All the way over the ice they looked for seal-holes. It takes sharp eyes to find them, for seal-holes are very small.  You see, the mother seals try to find the safest place they can to hide their babies, and this is the way they do it:  As soon as the ice begins to freeze in the autumn, the seals gnaw holes in it to reach the air, and they keep these holes open all winter. It freezes so fast in that cold country that they have to be busy almost every minute all through the winter breaking away the ice there. They get their sleep in snatches of a minute or so at a time, and between their naps they clear the ice from their breathing holes.  There is usually a deep layer of snow over the ice. Each mother seal hollows out a little igloo under the snow, around her breathing hole, and leaves a tiny hole in the top of it, so her baby can have plenty of fresh air and be hidden from sight at the same time.  The mother seal leaves the baby in the snow house, and she herself dives through the hole and swims away. Every few minutes she comes back to breathe, and to see that her baby is safe.  It was the tiny hole in the top of the seal's snow house that Menie and Koko hoped to find.  The days had grown quite long by this time and there was fog in the air. Once in a while there would be a loud crackling noise.  \"The ice is beginning to break,\" Koko said. \"Don't you hear it pop? My father says he thinks the warm weather will begin early this year.\"  They had gone some distance out on the ice, when suddenly Menie said, \"Look! Look there!\" He pointed toward the north. There not far from shore was a flock of sea-birds, resting on the ice.  \"Just let me get a shot at them!\" cried Koko. \"You stay here and hold on to the dogs! Nip and Tup haven't any sense at all about game!"]]]
