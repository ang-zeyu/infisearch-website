In the first two voyages that he made Vespucci sailed under the flag of Spain.  In the second two he sailed in the service of the King of Portugal.  But after his fourth voyage he returned again to Spain.  There he received a large salary and the rank of captain. Later he was made Pilot Major of Spain, and was held in high honour till his death.  Yet in all the voyages Vespucci went, whether under the flag of Portugal or of Spain, he was never leader.  He went as astronomer, or as pilot, while other men captained the expeditions.  It is from Amerigo's letters alone that we gather the little we know about his voyages.  For although he says in one of his letters that he has written a book called \"The Four Voyages\" it has never been found, and perhaps was never published.  One long letter, however, which he wrote to an old schoolfellow was so interesting that it was published and read by many people all over Europe.  It was, says an old English writer, \"abrode in every mannes handes.\"  Amerigo's voyages led him chiefly to Central and South America and he became convinced that South America was a continent.  So soon, what with the voyages of Vespucci and the voyages of other great men, it became at last quite certain that there was a vast continent beyond the Atlantic ocean.  Map-makers, therefore, began to draw a huge island, large enough to form in itself a continent, south of the Equator.  They called it the New World, or the land of the Holy Cross, but the Northern Continent was still represented on the maps by a few small islands, or as a part of Asia.  Thus years passed.  Daring sailors still sailed the stormy seas in search of new lands, and learned men read the tales of their adventures and wrote new books of geography.  Then one day a professor who taught geography at the Monastery of St.  Dié in Alsace published a little book on geography.  In it he spoke of Europe, Asia and Africa, the three parts of the world as known to the ancients.  Then he spoke of the fourth part which had been discovered by Amerigo Vespucci, by which he meant what we now call South America. \"And,\" continues this professor, \"I do not see what is rightly to hinder us calling this part Amerige or America, that is, the land of Americus after its discoverer Americus.\"  This is the first time the word America was ever used, and little did this old German professor, writing in his quiet Alsatian College, think that he was christening the great double continent of the New World.  And as little did Amerigo think in writing his letter to his old school fellow that he was to be looked upon as the discoverer of the New World.  At first the new name came slowly into use and it appears for the first time on a map made about 1514.  In this map America is shown as a great island continent lying chiefly south of the Equator.  All the voyages which Columbus had made had been north of the Equator.  No man yet connected the land south of the Equator with him, and it was at first only to this south land that the name America was given.  Thirty years and more went by.  Many voyages were made, and it became known for certain that Columbus had not reached the shores of India by sailing west, and that a great continent barred the way north as well as south of the Equator.  Then a famous map-maker gave the name of America to both continents.  But many Spaniards were jealous for the fame of Columbus, and they thought that the Northern Continent should be called Colonia or Columbiana.  One, anxious that the part in the discovery taken by Ferdinand and Isabella should not be forgotten, even tried to make people call it Fer-Isabelica.  But all such efforts were in vain.  America sounded well, people liked it, and soon every one used it.  Amerigo Vespucci himself had nothing to do with the choice, and yet because others gave his name to the New World many hard things have been said of him.  He has been called in scorn a \"land lubber, \" a beef and biscuit contractor,\" and other contemptuous names. Even one of the greatest American writers has poured scorn on him. \"Strange,\" he says, \"that broad America must wear the name of a thief.  Amerigo Vespucci, the pickle dealer of Seville . . . whose highest naval rank was a boatswain's mate in an expedition that never sailed, managed in this lying world to supplant Columbus and baptise half the earth with his own dishonest name.\"  But it was the people of his day, and not Vespucci, who brought the new name into use.  Vespucci himself had never any intention of being a thief or of robbing Columbus of his glory.  He and Columbus had always been friends, and little more than a year before he died Columbus wrote a letter to his son Diego which Vespucci delivered. In this letter Columbus says, \"Amerigo Vespucci, the bearer of this letter . . . has always been wishful to please me.  He is a very honest man. . . .  He is very anxious to do something for me, if it is in his power.\"  It was only accident which gave the name of America to the New World, and perhaps also the ingratitude of the great leader's own generation.  Later generations, however, have not been so unmindful of Columbus and his deeds; Americans have not allowed his great name to be wholly forgotten.  The district in which the capital of the United States is situated is called Columbia.  In Canada too there is the great province of British Columbia, and in South America the 'United States of Colombia, besides many towns all named in honour of the great discoverer.  __________      Chapter 6 - How The Flag of England Was Planted on the Shores of the New World     Christopher Columbus showed the way across the Sea of Darkness; Amerigo Vespucci gave his name to the great double continent, but it was another Italian, John Cabot, who first landed on the Continent of North America.  Like Columbus, Cabot was born in Genoa.  When, however, he left his own land he did not go to Spain like Columbus, but to England.  He had been living in England for some years when the news of the first great voyage of Columbus was brought there.  Soon every one was talking about the wonderful discovery from the King and his court downward.  Cabot was a trader and a daring sailor, well used to sailing on the stormy seas.  Yet even he was awed by what Columbus had done. To find that way never known before, and by sailing west to reach the east \"where the spices grow\" seemed to him \" a thing more divine than human. \"And he too longed to follow Columbus, and maybe discover new lands.  King Henry VII was eager to claim new lands as the Kings of Spain and Portugal were doing.  So he listened to the persuasions of John Cabot.  And in spite of the Pope - who had divided all the undiscovered world between the Kings of Spain and Portugal - gave him leave to sail forth to \"the seas of the east and west and north\" and to plant the banner of England upon any islands, countries or regions belonging to heathens or infidels which he might discover. He bade his \"well-beloved John Cabot\" take five ships and set forth on the adventure at his \" own proper costs and charges.\" For Henry was a King \"wise but not lavish,\" and although he wanted England to have the glory of new discoveries he was not eager to spend his gold on them.  But where could a poor sailor find money enough for so great an adventure?  So a year went past, and although Cabot had the King's leave to go he did not set out.  But he did not let the King forget.  And at length close-fisted Henry listened to \"the busy request and supplication\" of the eager sailor, and consented to fit out one small ship.  So at five o'clock one sweet May morning a frail little vessel called the Matthew, with a crew of but eighteen men, sailed out from Bristol harbour.  Many people came to see the vessel sail.  For they were nearly all Bristol men who were thus venturing forth on the unknown deep, and their friends crowded to the harbour to wish them godspeed.  It was a great occasion for Bristol, and indeed for all England, for it was the first voyage of discovery with which the English king and people had to do.  So the tiny whitesailed ship put out to sea, followed by the prayers and wishes of those left behind.  With tear-dimmed eyes they watched it till it faded from view.  Then they turned homewards to pray for the return of their loved ones.  Round the coast of Ireland the vessel sped.  But at last its green shores faded from sight and the little company of eighteen brave men were alone upon the trackless waves.  Westward and ever westward they sailed,  \"Over the hazy distance, Beyond the sunset's rim\"  Week after week went by.  Six weeks and then seven, and still no land appeared.  Those were days of anxiety and gloom.  But still the hope of the golden west lured Cabot on, and at length one day in June he heard the glad cry of \"Land! Land!\"  So on St.  John's Day, in 1497, John Cabot landed somewhere on the coast of America.  He called the land Prima Tierra Vista or First Land Seen, and because of the day upon which it was found he called an island near to it St.  John's Isle.  We cannot tell exactly where Cabot east anchor: it may have been at Cape Breton or somewhere on the coast of Labrador.  But wherever it was that he landed he there set up a great cross and unfurled the flag of England, claiming the land for King Henry.  When Cabot set out he was full of the ideas of Columbus.  He had hoped to find himself on the coast of Asia and in the land of gold and spices.  Now he knew himself mistaken.  He did not see any natives, but he knew the land was inhabited, for he found notched trees, snares for wild animals and other signs of habitation which he took home.  He had found no \"golden cities,\" he had had speech with no stately potentate.  Yet he was not utterly disappointed.  For the country he had found seemed to him fair and fertile, and the quantities of fish which swarmed in the seas amazed "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3761"],["title","This Country of Ours (#7)"],["body","himself and his men.  They had no need of lines or even of nets.  They had but to let down a basket weighted with a stone and draw it up again to have all the fish they wanted.  Cabot stayed but a short time in the new-found land.  He would fain have stayed longer and explored further, but he feared lest his provisions would give out, and so regretfully he turned homeward.  Great was the excitement in Bristol when the tiny ship came to anchor there once more, little more than three months after it had sailed away.  And so strange were the tales Master Cabot had to tell that the folk of Bristol would hardly have believed him (for he was a poor man and a foreigner) had not his crew of honest Bristol men vouched for the truth of all he said.  Every one was delighted.  Even thrifty King Henry was so much pleased that he gave Cabot Ł10.  It seems a small enough sum for one who had found \"a new isle.\" But we must remember that it was worth more than Ł100 would be worth today.  Cabot at any rate found it enough with which to buy a suit of silk.  And dressed in this new splendour he walked about the streets of Bristol followed by gaping crowds.  He was now called the Great Admiral, and much honour was paid to him.  Every one was eager to talk with him, eager to go with him on his next voyage: and that even although they knew that many of the crew would be thieves and evil-doers.  For the King had promised to give Cabot for sailors all prisoners except those who were confined for high treason.  We know little more of John Cabot.  Later King Henry gave him a pension of Ł20 a year.  It seems likely that the following year he set out again across the broad Atlantic, taking his sons with him. \"The rest is silence.\"  How John Cabot ended his life, where he lies taking his rest, we do not know.  \"He sleeps somewhere in sod unknown, Without a slab, without a stone.\"  We remember him chiefly because he was the first to lead Englishmen across the Atlantic, the first to plant the flag of England upon the Continent of North America, which, in days to come, was to be the home of two great English speaking peoples.  __________      Chapter 7 - How The Flag of France Was Planted in Florida     As years went on many voyages of discovery and exploration were made to the New World by both the Spaniards and the Portuguese, but chiefly by the Spaniards.  America was the land of golden hopes, the land of splendid adventure, and the haughty knights of Spain, thirsting for gold and for fame, were lured thither.  They sought the fabled seven cities of gold, they sought the fountain of eternal youth.  Through the dark pathless forests, across the wide prairies they flashed in glittering array, awaking the vast silences with the clash of arms.  They came in all the pomp and splendour of warfare; they brought also the Cross of Christ, threatening the heathen with death if they did not bow to Him and be baptised.  And it seemed for a time as if they, and they only, would possess the vast continent. But expedition after expedition ended in disaster.  The Spaniards found neither the far-famed seven cities nor the fountain of youth. And the Redmen, instead of accepting their religion, hated them and it with a deep hatred.  But the Spaniards were not long left in undisputed possession of America.  The French King too desired to have new lands across the seas, and he saw no reason why Spain and Portugal should divide the New World between them.  \"I would fain see Father Adam's will,\" he said, \"in which he made you the sole heirs to so vast an inheritance.  Until I do see that, I shall seize as mine whatever my good ships may find upon the ocean. \"  From France, therefore, daring men sailed forth to the New World. And there they set up the arms of their country, claiming broad lands for their King.  And now came the time when all Christian lands were torn asunder by religious strife.  The Reformation had begun, and everywhere there was discord between the people who followed the old religion and those who followed the new.  In France those who followed the new religion were called Huguenots.  They were often hardly used, and were denied freedom to worship God in their own way.  Many of them therefore longed to get away from France, and go to some new country where they would have the freedom they desired.  So a few grave, stern men gathered together and determined to set out for some place in the New World where they might make a home.  Then one February day in 1562 two little ships sailed away from France.  Westward they sailed until about two and a half months later they landed in what is now Florida.  It was May Day, the sun shone and all the world seemed gay and green, and these Protestant adventurers thought they had never seen so fair a land.  It was, they said, the fairest, fruitfullest and pleasantest of all the world, \"abounding in honey, venison and wildfowl.\" The natives were friendly and told the newcomers by signs that the seven golden cities were not far off.  That rejoiced their hearts, for even those stern old Huguenots were not above following the quest for gold.  Here then in this far-off land the Huguenots set up a stone pillar carved with the arms of the King of France.  And kneeling round it they gave thanks to God for having brought them to so fair a country.  Then returning to their ships they sailed northward along the coast, For they had not come to settle, but merely to explore, and find out a good spot on which to found a colony.  But the land seemed so fair, the air so balmy, that they were ready to settle there at once, and never return to France.  At length after inspecting several places the adventurers reached a spot not far from what is now Beaufort in South Carolina.  Here they landed, and knowing that many of the men were already eager to remain in this beautiful country, Jean Ribaut, their leader, resolved to found a colony.  So he called them all together, and speaking wise and brave words to them asked who among them would remain.  \"Declare your minds freely unto me,\" he said, \"and remember that if you decide to remain you will for ever be famous, and be known as the first white men who inhabited this land.\"  Ribaut had scarcely finished speaking when nearly all the men replied with a shout, \"We ask nothing better than to remain in this beautiful country.\"  Indeed so many were anxious to remain that Ribaut had enough to do to persuade a sufficient number to man the ships to return with him.  In the end thirty men were chosen to remain.  At once they set about building a fort which they called Charlesfort in honour of the boy King, Charles IX, who was then upon the throne.  The men worked so well that in a very few days the fort was so far finished that it was fit to live in.  Food and ammunition were brought from the ships, and a man named Albert de la Pierria was chosen as Governor.  Then for the last time Ribaut gathered all the men together and took leave of those to be left behind.  \"Captain Albert,\" he said, \"I have to ask you in the presence of all these men, to quit yourself so wisely in your charge, that I shall be able to commend you to your King.  \"And you,\" he said, turning to the soldiers, \"I beg you to esteem Captain Albert as if he were myself, and to yield to him that obedience that a true soldier owes to his general and captain.  I pray you live as brethren together without discord.  And in so doing God will assist you, and bless your enterprises.\"  Then farewells were said, and Ribaut sailed away, leaving the thirty white men alone in the wilderness.  From north to south, from east to west, in all the vast continent there were no white men save themselves.  The little company was made up of young nobles, sailors, merchants and artisans.  There were no farmers or peasants among them, and when they had finished their fort none of them thought of clearing the land and sowing corn.  There was no need: Ribaut would soon return, they thought, bringing with him all they required.  So they made friends with the Indians, and roamed the forest wilds in search of gold and of adventures, without care for the future.  But the days and weeks passed and Ribaut did not return.  For when he arrived home he found that France was torn with civil war, and that it was impossible to get ships fitted out to sail to America.  Soon the little colony began to feel the pangs of hunger.  Daily they scanned the pitiless blue sea for a glimpse of Ribaut's returning sail.  No sail appeared, and daily their supplies dwindled away.  Had it not been for the friendly Redmen they might all have perished. For the Indians were generous, and as long as they had food themselves they shared it with their white friends.  But at length they could spare no more.  Indeed they had already given the Pale-faces so much food that they themselves, they said, would be forced to roam the woods in search of roots and herbs to keep them from starving until harvest was ripe.  They told the Frenchmen, however, of two rich and powerful chiefs who held sway over land which lay to the south, where they might obtain endless supplies of corn and vegetables.  This was indeed good news to the Frenchmen.  And guided by their Indian friends they lost no time in setting out to beg food from those dusky potentates.  When the Frenchmen reached the wigwams of one of these chiefs they were received with great honour.  They found that their Redskin friends had spoken truly.  Here there was food in abundance; and after a great feast they returned joyfully to the fort, carrying with them a great supply of corn and beans, and - what was still better - a promise from the friendly chief that he would give them more food whenever they had need of it.  Once more the colonists rejoiced in plenty.  But not for long.  For the very night they arrived home their storehouse took fire, and all the food which they had brought with such joy was destroyed.  Again famine stared "]]]
