The other two wolves were added to the procession, but they looked small and insignificant beside the body of that killed by the boys. Harry learned that no one had suspected that they had gone in pursuit of the wolf.  A vigilant look-out had been kept all round the thicket, while the dogs hunted it from end to end, but no signs had been seen of it, and none were able to understand how it could have slipped between the watchers unseen.  After the ravine had been thoroughly beaten the party had moved off to another cover. On their way there the marquis had missed the two boys. No one had seen them, and it was supposed that they had loitered behind in the forest. Two or three notes of recall had been blown, and then no one had thought more of the matter until they rode into the glade when the second wolf had just been pulled down by the pack.  It was afternoon when the hunting party arrived at the chateau. Before they started homewards the marquis had sent off two horsemen; one to Dijon to bring a surgeon with all speed to the chateau, the other to tell the marquise that Ernest had been hurt, and that everything was to be got in readiness for him; but that she was not to make herself uneasy, as the injury was not a serious one.  The messengers were charged strictly to say nothing about the death of the demon wolf.  The marquise and her daughters were at the entrance as the party arrived. The sight of the litter added to the anxiety which Ernest's mother was feeling; but the marquis rode on a short distance ahead to her.  \"Do not be alarmed, Julie,\" he said; \"the lad is not very seriously hurt. He has been torn a bit by a wolf, and has behaved splendidly.\"  \"The messenger said he had been hurt by a wolf, Edouard; but how came he to put himself in such peril?\"  \"He will tell you all about it, my dear. Here he is to speak for himself.\"  \"Do not look so alarmed, mother,\" Ernest said as she ran down to the side of the litter. \"It is no great harm, and I should not have minded if it had been ten times as bad.\"  \"Bring up the wolf,\" the marquis said, \"and Harry, do you come here and stand by Ernest's side. Madam la marquise,\" he went on, \"do you see that great gray wolf? That is the demon wolf which has for years been the terror of the district, and these are its slayers. Your son and M. Sandwith, they, and they alone, have reaped the glory which every sportsman in Burgundy has been so long striving to attain; they alone in the forest, miles away from the hunt, pursued and slew this scourge of the province.\"  He put his horn to his lips. The others who carried similar instruments followed his example. A triumphant traralira was blown. All present took off their hunting-caps and cheered, and the hounds added their barking to the chorus.  \"Is it possible, Edward,\" the marquise said, terrified at the thought of the danger her son must have run in an encounter with the dreaded beast, \"is it possible that these two alone have slain this dreadful wolf?\"  \"It is quite possible, my dear, since it has been done, though, had you asked me yesterday, I should almost have said that it could not be; however, there it is. Ernest and his brave young friend have covered themselves with glory; they will be the heroes of the department. But we must not stay talking here. We must get Ernest into bed as soon as possible. A surgeon will be here very shortly. I sent a messenger on to Dijon for one at the same time I sent to you.\"  The marquis stayed outside for a few minutes while the domestics handed round great silver cups full of spiced wine, and then bidding good-bye to his guests entered the chateau just as the surgeon rode up to the entrance.  \"Please tell us all about it,\" his daughters asked him when, having seen the surgeon set the broken bone and bandage the wound, operations which Ernest bore with stoical firmness, he went down to the salon where his daughters were anxiously expecting him. \"All about it, please. We have heard nothing, for Harry went upstairs with Ernest, and has not come down again.\"  The marquis told the whole story, how the wolf had made his escape unseen through the cordon round his lair, and had passed within the sight of the two boys some distance away, and how they had hunted it down and slain it. The girls shuddered at the story of the death of the wood-cutter and the short but desperate conflict with the wolf.  \"Then Ernest has the principal honour this time,\" the eldest girl said.  \"It is pretty evenly divided,\" the marquis said. \"You see Ernest brought the wolf to bay by breaking its shoulder, and struck the first blow as it was flying upon Harry, who had been thrown from his horse. Then, again, Ernest would almost certainly have been killed had not Harry in his turn come to his assistance and dealt it its mortal blows. There is not much difference, but perhaps the chief honours rest with Ernest.\"  \"I am glad of that, papa,\" Mademoiselle de St. Caux said; \"it is only right the chief honour should be with your son and not with this English boy. He has had more than his share already, I think.\"  \"You would not think so if he had saved your life, sister,\" Jeanne broke in impetuously. \"It was very brave of them both to kill the wolf; but I think it was ever, ever so much braver to attack a great mad dog without weapons. Don't you think so, papa?\"  \"I don't think you should speak so warmly to your elder sister, Jeanne,\" the marquis said; \"she is a grown-up young lady, and you are in the school-room. Still, in answer to your question, I admit that the first was very much the braver deed. I myself should have liked nothing better than to stand before that great wolf with my hunting sword in my hand; but although if I had been near you when the hound attacked you, I should doubtless have thrown myself before you, I should have been horribly frightened and should certainly have been killed; for I should never have thought of or carried so promptly out the plan which Harry adopted of muzzling the animal. But there is no need to make comparisons. On the present occasion both the lads have behaved with great bravery, and I am proud that Ernest is one of the conquerors of the demon wolf. It will start him in life with a reputation already established for courage. Now, come with me and have a look at the wolf. I don't think such a beast was ever before seen in France. I am going to have him stuffed and set up as a trophy. He shall stand over the  fireplace in the hall, and long after we have all mouldered to dust our descendants will point to it proudly, telling how a lad of their race, with another his own age, slew the demon wolf of Burgundy.\"  Ernest was confined to his bed for nearly a month, and during this time Harry often went long rides and walks by himself. In the evening the marquis frequently talked with him over the situation of the country and compared the events which had taken place with the struggle of the English parliament with the king.  \"There was one point of difference between the two cases,\" he said one evening. \"In England the people had already great power in the state. The parliament had always been a check upon the royal authority; and it was because the king tried to overrule parliament that the trouble came about. Here our kings, or at least the ministers they appointed, have always governed; often unwisely I admit, but is it likely that the mob would govern better? That is the question. At present they seem bent on showing their incapacity to govern even themselves.\"  The Marquis de St. Caux had, in some respects, the thoughts and opinions of the old school. He was a royalist pure and simple.  As to politics, he troubled his head little about them. These were a matter for ministers. It was their business to find a remedy for the general ills. As to the National Assembly which represented only the middle class and people, he regarded it with contempt.  \"Why, it was from the middle class,\" he said, \"that the oppressors of the people were drawn. It is they who were farmers-general, collectors, and officials of all kinds. It is  they who ground down the nation and enriched themselves with the spoil. It is not the nobles who dirtied their hands with money wrung from the poor. By all means let the middle class have a share in the government; but it is not a share they desire. The clergy are to have no voice; the nobility are to have no voice; the king himself is to be a cipher. All power is to be placed in the hands of these men, the chosen of the scum of the great towns, the mere mouthpieces of the ignorant mob. It is not order that these gentry are organizing, it is disorder.\"  Such were the opinions of the marquis, but he was tolerant of other views, and at the gatherings at the chateau Harry heard opinions of all kinds expressed.  During his rambles alone he entered as much as he could into conversation with the peasants, with woodcutters, foresters, and villagers. He found that the distress which prevailed everywhere was terrible. The people scarcely kept life together, and many had died of absolute starvation. He found a feeling of despair everywhere, and a dull hatred of all who were above them in the world. Harry had difficulty in making them talk, and at first could obtain only sullen monosyllables. His dress and appearance showed him to belong to the hated classes, and set them against him at once; but when he said that he was English, and that in England people were watching with great interest what was passing in France, they had no hesitation in speaking.  Harry's motives in endeavouring to find out what were the feelings of the people at large, were not those of mere curiosity. He was now much attached to the marquis and his family; and the reports which came from all parts of France, as well as from Paris, together with the talk among"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37856"],["title","The Determined Angler and the Brook Trout (#0)"],["body","=By Charles Bradford=       =The Determined Angler=      \"Most sensible volume of its kind.\"--Grover     Cleveland. 12º. illustrated.

How delightful in the early spring, after the dull and tedious time of winter, when the frosts disappear and the sunshine warms the earth and waters, to wander forth by some clear stream, to see the leaf bursting from the purple bud, to scent the odors of the bank perfumed by the violet, and enameled, as it were, with the primrose and the daisy; to wander upon the fresh turf below the shade of trees, whose bright blossoms are filled with the music of the bee; and on the surface of the waters to view the gaudy flies sparkling like animated gems in the sunbeams, whilst the bright and beautiful trout is watching them from below; to hear the twittering of the water-birds, who, alarmed at your approach, rapidly hide themselves beneath the flowers and leaves of the water-lily; and as the season advances, to find all these objects changed for others of the same kind, but better and brighter, till the swallow and the trout contend as it were for the gaudy May fly, and till in pursuing your amusement in the calm and balmy evening, you are serenaded by the songs of the cheerful thrush ... performing the offices of paternal love, in thickets ornamented with the rose and woodbine.\"--_Days of Fly Fishing, 1828._  \"Gentlemen, let not prejudice prepossess you. I confess my discourse is like to prove suitable to my recreation, calm and quiet.... And so much for the prologue of what I mean to say-\"      Izaak Walton  [Illustration]     PREFACE  \"Don't give up if you don't catch fish; the unsuccessful trip should whet your appetite to try again.\"--GROVER CLEVELAND.   A preface is either an excuse or an explanation, or both. The Brook Trout needs no excuse, and it is fully explained in the general text of this volume. Nor does the Angler, be he Determined or otherwise, need any excuse, because \"our Saviour chose simple fishermen ... St. Peter, St. John, St. Andrew, and St. James, whom he inspired, and He never reproved these for their employment or calling\" (Izaak Walton, _The Compleat Angler_, 1653). And the Angler--the man--needs no explanation, though it seems ever necessary to define the word.  Webster, himself a profound Angler, must have been unconscious of his gentle bearing, for his definition of \"angle\" is simply: \"to fish,\" and every Angler knows that merely to fish--to go forth indifferent of correct (humane) tackle, the legal season, and ethical methods in the pursuit--is not the way of the Angler.  I like the explanation of the word by Genio C. Scott: \"Angling, a special kind of fishing.\"  The inspired landscape genius and the kalsominer who shellacs the artist's studio are both painters; so, the gentle Angler with perfect tackle and the mere hand-line fish taker are both fishermen.  The Angler is the highest order of fisherman, and while all Anglers are fishermen there are many fishermen who are not Anglers.  \"Anglo-Saxon,\" writing in the New York _Press_. October 14, 1915, uses the term \"gentleman Anglers.\" He should have said \"gentleman fishermen\" (Anglers), because all Anglers are gentlemen, regardless of their business calling, appearance, personality, companionship, etc. When a man, fisherman or no fisherman, develops into an Angler he must first become gentle in order to be of the gentle art. \"Angling is the gentle art\" (Walton). \"The gentle art of angling\" (Cotton).  \"If true Anglers,\" says Genio C. Scott, \"you are sure to be gentle.\"  Peter Flint (New York _Press_, Oct. 15, 1915): \"Our most successful Anglers, amateurs as well as professionals.\"  All Anglers are amateurs, brother Peter. There are no professional Anglers, though there are both amateur and professional fishermen, and those fishermen who are amateurs are Anglers. The word \"amateur\" seems to be adrift upon the same bewildering tideway as the words \"angler\" and \"angling.\" \"Amateur\" hasn't the definition commonly attributed to it--it doesn't signify inefficiency, inexperience, unpracticality, etc., as do the words \"beginner,\" \"neophyte,\" \"tyro,\" etc. An amateur in fishing, or farming, or any other pastime or pursuit, may be far more practical, more experienced, more proficient, and better equipped in tools and paraphernalia than a professional, and he usually is so; he is certainly always so in angling.  Watch your word.  \"It is the belief of Acker that hand-line fishing is as good [as], if not better than, the rod and reel kind.\" (Wandering Angler, New York _Press_, Aug. 17, 1915.)  Hand-line fishing, as fishing,--though the Tuna Angling Club, of Santa Catalina Island, California, is bound to the use of light rods and fine reels and tells us hand-lines are unsportsmanlike and detrimental to the public interest,--is good (Christ and His disciples sanctioned it), but to say it is as good as or better than rod and reel angling is not convincing. The indifferent fisher can't condemn angling in praising common fishing with any more reason than he might proclaim against cricket playing in favoring carpentry, or _vice versa_. One might as correctly say hand-line fishing is as good as riding, or driving, or golf, or baseball, or canoeing (of course it is), for fishing without rod and reel and fishing with proper tackle are pursuits as distinct in character as riding a plain horse bareback with a rough halter, and straddling a gallant charger with neat bridle and saddle; or as mere boating upon a refuse creek, and skimming the green billows in a trim yacht.  That the fisher's hand-line and the fisherman's net will take _more_ fish than the Angler's tackle is not of moment, because a stick of dynamite or a cannon filled with leaden pellets or a boy with a market basket will take still more fish than the net and hand-line. Quantity makes fishing \"good\" with the fisherman; quality delights the Angler. There is no objection to the mere fish-getter filling his boat with fishes with or without tackle, but as the jockey is separated from the sportsman rider and the sailor from the yachtsman so should the quantity fisher and the quality Angler be considered in contrasting spheres. \"What a man brings home in his heart after fishing is of more account than what he brings in his basket,\" says W. J. Long. \"Anglers encourage the adoption of angling methods,\" says Dr. Van Dyke, \"which make the wholesale slaughter of fishes impossible and increase the sport of taking a fair number in a fair way.\"  As chivalric single-missile bow-and-arrow exercise dignifies archery above bunch-arrow work in war, so the gentle use of refined tackle dignifies angling above mere fish getting. Trap shooting is delightful, and more birds are killed than the gunner would bag in marsh and meadow, but is trap shooting therefore more \"good\" than game-shooting in the glorious fields and forests? No, sir; and though the hand-line fisherman may honestly take half the ocean's yield, still his pursuit and his catch cannot equal and cannot be legitimately compared to the code and the creel of the competent Angler.      =C.
