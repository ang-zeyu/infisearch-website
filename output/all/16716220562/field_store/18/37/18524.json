INTRODUCTION   In trying to determine the ancestral relationships of modern orders of Amphibia it is not possible to select satisfactory structural ancestors among a wealth of fossils, since very few of the known fossils could even be considered possible, and scarcely any are satisfactory, for such a selection. The nearest approach thus far to a solution of the problem in this manner has been made with reference to the Anura. Watson's paper (1940), with certain modifications made necessary by Gregory (1950), provides the paleontological evidence so far available on the origin of frogs. It shows that several features of the skeleton of frogs, such as the enlargement of the interpterygoid spaces and orbits, reduction of the more posterior dermal bones of the skull, and downward spread of the neural arches lateral to the notochord, were already apparent in the Pennsylvanian _Amphibamus_ (Fig. 1), with which Gregory synonymized _Miobatrachus_ and _Mazonerpeton_. But between the Pennsylvanian and the Triassic (the age of the earliest known frog, _Protobatrachus_) there was a great lapse of time, and that which passed between any conceivable Paleozoic ancestor of Urodela and the earliest satisfactory representative of this order (in the Cretaceous) was much longer still. The Apoda, so far as known, have no fossil record.  Nevertheless it should be possible, first, to survey those characters of modern Amphibia that might afford some comparison with the early fossils, and second, to discover among the known Paleozoic kinds those which are sufficiently unspecialized to permit derivation of the modern patterns. Further circumstantial evidence may be obtained by examining some features of Recent Amphibia which could not readily be compared with anything in the fossils; such are the embryonic development of the soft structures, including cartilaginous stages of the skeleton, the development and various specializations of the ear mechanism, adaptive characters associated with aquatic and terrestrial life, and so on.     COMPARISON OF MODERN ORDERS WITH THE LABYRINTHODONTS AND LEPOSPONDYLS   [Illustration: Fig. 1. _Saurerpeton_ (× 1/2, after Romer, 1930, fig. 6); _Amphibamus_, the palatal view × 2-1/4, from Watson, 1940, fig. 4 (as _Miobatrachus_), the dorsal view × 2-1/2, from Gregory's revised figure of _Amphibamus_ (1950, Fig. 1); _Protobatrachus_, × 1, from Watson, 1940, fig. 18, 19.]  In both Anura and Urodela the skull is short, broad, relatively flat, with reduced pterygoids that diverge laterally from the parasphenoids leaving large interpterygoid vacuities, and with large orbits. (These statements do not apply to certain larval or perennibranchiate forms.) The skull in both orders has lost a number of primitive dermal bones in the posterior part; these are: basioccipital, supraoccipital, postparietal, intertemporal, supratemporal, and tabular. The exoccipitals form the two condyles but there are no foramina for the 11th and 12th nerves, since these are not separate in modern Amphibia. The opisthotic is missing in all except Proteidae (but see discussion of the ear). Although the skull is normally autostylic, a movable basipterygoid articulation is present among Hynobiid salamanders and in at least the metamorphic stages of primitive frogs, and therefore should be expected in their ancestors. The vertebrae are, of course, complete; see discussion in later section. The quadratojugal, lost in salamanders, is retained in frogs, and conversely the lacrimal, absent in frogs, occurs in a few primitive salamanders. The situation in Apoda is different, but postfrontal and jugal should be noted as bones retained in this order while lost in the others.  Thus, in spite of minor differences, the above list shows that there are numerous and detailed similarities between Anura and Urodela with respect to the features in which they differ from the Paleozoic orders. Pusey (1943) listed 26 characters which _Ascaphus_ shares with salamanders but not with more advanced frogs; a few of these might be coincidental, but most of them are of some complexity and must be taken to indicate relationship. The main adaptive specializations of Anura, however, including loss of the adult tail, extreme reduction in number of vertebrae, formation of urostyle, elongation of the ilium and lengthening of the hind legs, must have appeared at a later time than the separation of that order from any possible common stem with Urodela, although they are only partially developed in the Triassic _Protobatrachus_.  Turning to the Paleozoic Amphibia, there are two groups in which some likelihood of a relationship with modern order exists. In the Pennsylvanian Trimerorhachoidea (Labyrinthodontia, order Temnospondyli) some members, such as _Eugyrinus_, _Saurerpeton_, and notably _Amphibamus_ (Fig. 1) had short, broad heads, an expansion of palatal and orbital openings, posterior widening of the parasphenoid associated with divergence of the pterygoids, a movable basipterygoid articulation, and reduction in size (but not loss) of the more posterior dermal bones of the skull. In recognition of Watson's (1940) evidence that these animals make quite suitable structural ancestors of frogs, Romer (1945) placed _Amphibamus_ in an order, Eoanura, but Gregory (1950) indicated that it might better be left with the temnospondyls. Association of the urodele stem with this group does not seem to have been proposed hitherto.  The other group of Paleozoic Amphibia that has been considered probably ancestral to any modern type is the subclass Lepospondyli, containing three orders, Aistopoda, Nectridia and Microsauria. In these the vertebrae are complete (holospondylous), the centra presumably formed by cylindrical ossification around the notochord, and there is no evidence as to the contributions from embryonic cartilage units. It is important to note at this point that precisely the same statement can be made regarding the vertebrae of _adults_ of all three Recent orders, yet for all of them, as shown in a later section, we have ample evidence of the part played by cartilage elements in vertebral development. Therefore (a) we cannot say that there were no such elements in embryonic stages of lepospondyls, and (b) it would take more than the evidence from adult vertebrae to relate a particular modern order (for example, Urodela) to the Lepospondyli. Vague similarities to Urodela have been noted by many authors in the Nectridia, Aistopoda and Microsauria, but these are not detailed and refer mainly to the vertebrae. The skulls do not show, either dorsally or in the palate, any striking resemblance to those of generalized salamanders, and certainly most known lepospondyls are too specialized to serve as the source of Urodela. It is true that the elongate bodies, small limbs, and apparent aquatic habitus of some lepospondyls accord well with our usual picture of a salamander, but such a form and way of life have appeared in many early Amphibia, including the labyrinthodonts. The family Lysorophidae (Fig. 2), usually placed among microsaurs, is sufficiently close in skull structure to the Apoda to be a possible ancestor of these, but it probably has nothing to do with Urodela, by reason of the numerous morphological specializations that were associated with its snakelike habitus.  [Illustration: Fig. 2. _Lysorophus tricarinatus_, lateral and posterior views × 2-1/2, modified after Sollas, 1920, Figs. 8 and 12, respectively; palatal view after Broom, 1918, × 1-1/2. For explanation of abbreviations see Fig. 3.]  McDowell's (1958) suggestion that it would be profitable to look among the Seymouriamorpha for the ancestors of frogs seems to be based upon a few details of apparent resemblance rather than a comprehensive view of the major characters of the animals. In most points which he mentions (limb girdles, form of ear, pterygoid articulation) the present writer does not see a closer similarity of frogs to Seymouriamorpha than to Temnospondyli.  Still other opinions have been expressed. Herre (1935), for instance, concludes \"on anatomical, biological and paleontological grounds\" that the orders of Urodela, Anura, Apoda and Stegocephali were all independently evolved from fish, but beyond citing the opinions of a number of other authors he does not present tangible evidence for this extreme polyphyletic interpretation.  More notable are the views of several Scandinavian workers (Säve-Söderbergh, 1934; Jarvik, 1942; Holmgren, 1933, 1939, 1949a, b), of whom Jarvik, in a thorough analysis of the ethmoid region, would derive the Urodela from Porolepid Crossopterygii, and all other tetrapods from the Rhipidistia; Säve-Söderbergh and Holmgren, the latter using the structure of carpus and tarsus, see a relationship of Urodela to Dipnoi, but accept the derivation of labyrinthodonts and other tetrapods from Rhipidistia. All of this work is most detailed and laborious, and has produced a great quantity of data useful to morphologists, but the diphyletic theory is not "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37350"],["title","The Ancestry of Modern Amphibia: A Review of the Evidence (#1)"],["body","adopted; the evidence adduced for it seems to consist largely of minutiae which, taken by themselves, are inconclusive, or lend themselves to other interpretation. For instance Holmgren's numerous figures of embryonic limbs of salamanders show patterns of cartilage elements that he would trace to the Dipnoan type of fin, yet it is difficult to see that the weight of evidence requires this, when the pattern does not differ in any fundamental manner from those seen in other embryonic tetrapods, and the differences that do appear may well be taken to have ontogenetic rather than phylogenetic meaning. Further, the Dipnoan specialization of dental plates and autostylic jaw suspension, already accomplished early in the Devonian, would seem to exclude Dipnoi from possible ancestry of the Urodela, an order unknown prior to the Mesozoic, in which the teeth are essentially similar to those of late Paleozoic Amphibia, and the jaw suspension is not yet in all members autostylic.

In this position the tympanum could receive airborne sounds whether the animal were entirely on land or lying nearly submerged with only the upper part of its head exposed. Among those Anura in which the ear is not reduced the same is true, except that the tabular is lost. In Temnospondyli (Fig. 3) the posterior wall of the otic capsule was usually formed by the opisthotic, which extended up and outward as a buttress from the exoccipital to the tabular, and sometimes showed a paroccipital process for the insertion, presumably, of a slip or tendon of the anterior axial musculature. The stapes, in addition to its foot in the fenestra ovalis and its tympanic or extrastapedial process to the tympanum, bore a dorsal process (or ligament) to the tabular, an \"internal\" process (or ligament) to the quadrate or an adjacent part of the squamosal, and a ligament to the ceratohyal. Some of these attachments might be reduced or absent in special cases, but they seem to have been the ones originally present both phylogenetically and embryonically in Amphibia.  Among typical frogs (Fig. 4) the base, or otostapes, is present and bony, the extrastapedial process (extracolumella, or hyostapes) is usually cartilaginous, the dorsal process (processus paroticus) is of cartilage or ligament, but the other two attachments are absent in the adult. The exoccipital extends laterally, occupying the posterior face of the otic capsule. Between it and the otostapes is a small disc, usually ossified, the operculum, which normally fits loosely in a portion of the fenestral membrane, and is developed from the otic capsule. The opercularis muscle extends from this disc to the suprascapula, in many but by no means all families of Anura.  [Illustration: Fig. 4. Diagram of middle ear structures in _Rana_ (upper figure, after Stadtmüller, 1936, and lower left after DeBeer, 1937), and _Ambystoma_ (lower right, after DeBeer, 1937); all × 4. For explanation of abbreviations see Fig. 3.]  Among Urodela (Fig. 4) the middle ear cavity and tympanum are lacking, and the stapes (columella) consists of no more than its footplate and the stylus, which is attached to the border of the squamosal, thus corresponding to the \"internal\" process. In families in which individuals metamorphose and become terrestrial (Hynobiidae, Ambystomidae, Salamandridae, Plethodontidae), an operculum and opercularis muscle appear in the adult, just as in frogs, except that in Plethodontidae, the most progressive family, the operculum fuses with the footplate of the stapes. Among neotenous or perennibranchiate urodeles there is no separate operculum or opercularis. The evidence given by Reed (1915) for fusion of the operculum with the columella in _Necturus_ appears inconclusive, in spite of the great care with which his observations were made. On the other hand, _Necturus_ and _Proteus_ alone among living salamanders have a distinct opisthotic on the posterior wall of the otic capsule (Fig. 3), as do the Cretaceous _Hylaeobatrachus_ and the Eocene _Palaeoproteus_. Probably these Proteidae should be regarded as primitive in this respect, although many other features may be attributed to neoteny.  There is a contrast between Anura and most Urodela in the relative positions of the stapes and facial nerve, as shown in DeBeer's (1937) diagrams. In the latter (_Ambystoma_) the nerve is beneath, and in the former (_Rana_) above, the stapes. Judging by figures of _Neoceratodus_, _Hypogeophis_, and several types of reptiles and mammals, the Urodela are exceptional. _Necturus_, however, has the nerve passing above its stapes, and this may be primitive in the same sense as the persistent opisthotic. There can be, of course, no question of the nerve having worked its way through or over the obstructing stapes in order to come below it in salamanders; rather, the peripheral growth of neuron fibers in the embryo must simply pursue a slightly different course among the partially differentiated mesenchyme in the two contrasting patterns.  Although DeBeer (1937) shows in his figure of _Hypogeophis_ (one of the Apoda) an operculum, this is apparently a mistake. The stapes has a large footplate, and its stylus articulates with the quadrate, but no true operculum or opercularis has been described in the Apoda. The facial nerve passes above the stapes. It does not seem necessary to regard the conditions in this order as related directly to those of either salamanders or frogs, but a reduction of the stapes comparable to that in salamanders has occurred.  The presence in both frogs and terrestrial salamanders of a special mechanism involving the opercularis muscle and an operculum cut out in identical fashion from the wall of the otic capsule behind the stapes seems to require some other explanation than that of a chance convergence or parallelism. Although the stapes and otic region are readily visible in a number of labyrinthodonts and lepospondyls, no indication of an operculum seems to be reported among them. But in the Triassic _Protobatrachus_ (Fig. 1), which is unmistakably a frog in its skull, pelvis and some other features, Piveteau (1937) has shown, immediately behind the foot of the stapes, a small bony tubercle, which he and Watson (1940) designated opisthotic. Very clearly it served for insertion of a muscle, and it is equally clear that the bone is a reduced opisthotic, carrying the paroccipital process already mentioned as characteristic of it in some temnospondyls. Since the remainder of the posterior wall of the otic capsule consists of cartilage, meeting the exoccipital, it may be that the opisthotic becomes the operculum in frogs. _Protobatrachus_ was too far specialized in the Anuran direction, although it still had a tail, and the forelegs and hind legs were nearly the same size, to be considered a possible ancestor of the Urodeles. But at one stage in the general reduction of the skull in the ancestry of both groups, a condition similar to that in _Protobatrachus_ may have characterized the otic region, long before the Triassic.  In the argument thus far we have considered terrestrial, adult amphibians, since it is only in these that either the normal middle ear and tympanum, or the opercular apparatus, is present. But among the urodeles several neotenic types occur (this term applies also to the perennibranchs). For most of these there is nothing about the otic region that would be inconsistent with derivation, by neoteny, from known families in which adults are terrestrial; for example, _Cryptobranchus_ could have had a Hynobiid-like ancestor. But this, as mentioned above, does not hold for the Proteidae, which possess an opisthotic of relatively large size, distinctly separate from the exoccipital and prootic. Either this bone is a neomorph, which seems improbable, or there has not been in the ancestry of this particular family an episode of reduction comparable to that seen in the terrestrial families, where there is an operculum instead of a normal opisthotic. Therefore the Proteidae probably are not derived from the general stem of other salamanders, but diverged sufficiently long ago that the bones of the otic region were"]]]
