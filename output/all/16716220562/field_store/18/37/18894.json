The tell-tale line of spots crossed the highway and led on to the gorse-clad heath, but though there were evidences that the fugitive had blundered into many bushes in his flight in the dark, the general direction remained the same. At this I wondered not a little, for from my forest experience I knew that a man crossing an open space in the dark would, without a light or other means to guide him, inevitably make a wide circle, unless he had the sense to keep his course by observing the direction of the wind. Yet I knew that after the storm the wind had died utterly away, so that the circumstance seemed stranger still.  I suppose I had not gone half a mile when, thrown behind some bushes, I espied the picture that the rogue had cut from its frame. There were signs that he had made a lengthy halt, one being a large dark stain upon the damp soil, showing that much blood had been spilled. Another thing I conjectured: he had discovered that the chart was not, as evidently he had imagined, part of the picture, and in his rage he had thrown it aside. That being so, it showed that day had dawned ere he could have become acquainted with the failure of his fell designs.  Making the canvas into a roll, I slipped it into my belt, and continued my way.  On and on I went, sometimes breaking into a run, keeping both a sharp lookout in case of a surprise and a careful watch on the dull brown track, which now began to show at greater intervals than heretofore.  At length my progress was stopped by a narrow, gurgling stream that flowed southwards between gravelly banks lined with bushes and dwarfed trees. This stream I knew to be the Lym, the same that joins the sea at Lymington.  Here I was thwarted, for though I took off my hose and shoes and waded over the clayey bottom, not the slightest track could I find on the farther bank. I walked both up and down stream for nearly a quarter of a mile, carefully examining the soft clay, which would assuredly reveal any trace of footprints after the heavy rain of the previous night; but the bank was innocent of any traces of human agency, though I encountered well-defined marks of ponies, deer, and otters.  Sick at heart, I now bethought me of Captain Jeremy's warning, so, uncocking my piece, I shouldered the weapon and set my face homewards. Bruno, who had followed the trail as keenly as I had done, seemed to share my dejection, for, instead of keeping a few paces ahead as he had done on the outward journey, he stuck close to my heels.  I was not returning by the same path, but rather, I should think, about two hundred yards to the right of it; yet with the smoke of the chimneys of Brockenhurst village to guide me I kept steadily onwards.  Suddenly, almost before I could utter a sound of alarm, the ground gave way beneath me; the bracken and the gorse seemed to shoot up past me, and the daylight gave place to semi-darkness.  Instinctively I clutched at the ledge of the pit, but without avail; then a thousand lights seemed to flash across my eyes, and I lost consciousness.  When I recovered my senses I found myself lying on the sandy floor of a natural cave or hollow, into which the light filtered through an aperture almost above my head--the hole through which I had fallen.  My head throbbed painfully, and, putting my hands to my forehead, I found that it was bound with a wet rag. As I moved my arm Bruno thrust his muzzle against my hand with a low bark of joy; the faithful dog had evidently followed his master in his fall.  I tried to raise myself into a sitting posture, but the exertion was too great, and with a stifled exclamation of pain I fell back.  \"Lie still, young maäster,\" exclaimed a gruff though kindly voice. \"You'll be safe enow wi' us.\"  \"Give him a drink o' water,\" said another. \"He'll do better sittin' up.\"  With that I felt myself raised and propped against the wall of the cave, so that I could look about.  Eight or ten men, dressed in rough clothing, some with peajackets, others in tarpaulins, were either seated on the ground or standing with folded arms regarding me intently. Two or three had pistols stuck in their belts, while a pair of heavy cutlasses and a bundle of stout staves, some with iron spikes, were placed in one corner of the cave, which was roughly three-sided, and formed by hands, as far as I could make out in the subdued light.  In the centre of the cavern was the trunk of a young tree, its upper portion leaning against the aperture overhead, while the branches had been lopped off sufficiently close to the stem to allow of the stumps being used as a rough ladder. Two small casks, an earthenware vessel containing water, a heap of clothing, and a coil of rope completed the utensils of this subterranean retreat.  \"You'll be the son of Cap'n Foul-weather Dick?\" asked the man who had first spoken.  \"Yes,\" I replied, for my questioner had used the name by which my father was frequently called by the seafaring population of Lymington.  \"'Twas well for you I knew it, for when you came tumbling down that hole we thought 'twas the sogers, and Bill 'ere got ready to knock you over th' head. D'ye know me?\"  I looked at the man as intently as my throbbing head would allow, then at his companions. Like an inspiration a thought flashed across my mind.  \"Yes,\" I answered. \"Ye are the men who went with Captain Miles to the West.\"  \"Aye,\" said the man referred to as Bill, \"an' well we know it. Look 'ee, young maäster, can we trust ye to keep your mouth shut on this business?\"  \"I have as weighty a matter on my mind now,\" I replied. \"You can count upon my silence.\"  \"The youngster's true enow, 'Enery,\" said Bill. \"Maybe he'll lend us a hand afore long. Look you,\" he continued, addressing me, \"there are but eleven left of the score of Lymington men who marched to help the Duke o' Monmouth. Kitt Binns, Carrol Tanner, Cripps, Fred Dadge--they went down in the fight; young Garge Pitman the red-coated devils took near Bridgwater. They strung him up on a gallows at the roadside. Poor fellow, he didn't half give 'em a rough time afore they did the dirty job, an' I was up to my neck in a ditch an' saw it all, yet couldn't bear a hand to help him. That makes five. What happened to the rest of us we don't know--taken, doubtless, after the fight. Anyways, Cap'n Miles, Joe Scott, Sammy Cross, an' Long Bristowe won't see Lymington again, I fear, though we aren't much better off on that score.\"  \"Captain Miles!\" I exclaimed. \"Why!----\" I broke off, though reasoning that as these men had confided in me, there was little harm in telling them of Captain Jeremy's hiding-place in our house.  \"What of him?\" asked several of the men.  \"He is alive and well; I saw him scarce two hours ago.\"  \"Hurrah!\" exclaimed the men, but softly, for they durst not shout lest the noise should betray them.  \"Alive and well, say you?\" repeated 'Enery, a burly, bearded seaman who, it seemed, had no other name. \"'Enery\" he answered to, and 'Enery he remains till the close of my story. \"But, young maäster, 'tis a good six hours you've been lying 'ere.\"  \"Six hours!\" I exclaimed amazedly; then, remembering my father's condition, I attempted to rise.  \"Nay, young sir,\" said Bill, noticing my effort, \"you cannot go home without aid, and none can we give till Black Lewis comes. But concerning Captain Jeremy?\"  In a few words I told them all I knew of the Captain's adventures, the men eagerly following every word.  \"Tell him,\" said 'Enery, as I finished my story, \"that ten stanch men await him here. Cooped up like rats in a hold, we durst not show our faces in Lymington, much less try for a ship; but with Cap'n Jeremy to lead us, we'll shape a true course yet. Tell him also----\"  A low cry like the call of a forest stag for its mate broke upon our ears. Twice 'twas repeated.  \"'Tis Black Lewis,\" said one of the men, for my information, and the next instant the bushes overhead were thrust back, and a man began to descend the rough ladder.  Black Lewis gave no sign of surprise at seeing a lad in the cave. I knew him by sight, and also by repute--a short, shrivelled-up little man, with a head that seemed too large and heavy for his body, wrinkled face, massive and protruding cheek bones, and sandy-coloured hair. He lived mainly by his wits, killing adders that infested the forest glades, hawking the skins of animals he caught, and, no doubt, poaching, though he had as yet managed to escape being branded as a felon. Some would have it that he was dullwitted, yet those who thus avowed had often cause to fear his tongue, which was as sharp as a rapier. He was dressed in loose, home-made garments of moleskin, and carried a long forked stick in his hand, not even relinquishing it when he descended the tree trunk. Over his back was strung a canvas bag, from which he produced a hare, some eggs, and a flagon of ale.  He readily consented to assist me to my home, and having bade farewell to the refugee seamen (who had persuaded me to lend them my fowling-piece), I was slung up the shaft by means of the rope, Bruno being carried up on the shoulders of one of the men. Once in the open air I walked strongly, though twice or thrice I reeled, and would have fallen but for my companion's assistance.  At the entrance to our grounds Black Lewis left me, and just as I gained the door Captain Jeremy met me. By the look on his face I knew that some thing was amiss.  \"They have searched for you high and low, Master Clifford,\" said he; \"but thanks be you are safe! Come at once and see your father, for----\"  \"He is not dead?\" I asked anxiously.  \"Nay, lad, but be prepared for the worst. Master Blackwood says he'll not last the night. If so, he'll pass away before the young flood sets in.\"     CHAPTER VIII  Concerning the Events that Prompted Me to a Desperate Resolve   My father had been removed to his room, and was now lying on his bed, his head and shoulders raised and supported by pillows, for the nature of his wound had "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38222"],["title","The Quest of the 'Golden Hope': A Seventeenth Century Story of Adventure (#7)"],["body","him to fight hard for breath.  He was now quite conscious, though very weak. Captain Jeremy afterwards said that what with cupping and applying leeches Master Blackwood had kept down the fever, but had also done his patient more harm than good.  My father knew full well that the end was at hand, yet he faced it manfully, like the stanch old seaman he was. I fancy his voice faltered when he spoke to me of Constance, but beyond that he was calm and collected, giving me advice as to my future, and preparing himself for the end.  'Tis unnecessary to dwell upon the events of the next few hours, for the remembrance of that mournful time is an affair for the minds of our own family; but just before midnight, at dead low water by the shore, as Captain Jeremy had predicted, my father passed peacefully away.  Neither do I care to relate too minutely the happenings of the following week. There was, according to custom, an inquest, but by mutual consent Captain Jeremy's name was left out of the case, although we were considerably ill at ease lest old Martha should babble on't.  Two days after my father had been laid to rest under the great yew tree in Brockenhurst Churchyard I received a letter from my uncle, John Hammond, stating that, in accordance with arrangements made with my father many years ago, he would take up his abode in our house, and look after the estate.  Captain Jeremy took his departure before my uncle arrived, and joined the party of Lymington seamen in the cave. He gave me his assurance that his understanding with my late parent would remain as before, and that he would, to use his own expression, \"keep his weather eye lifting\", and endeavour to find a means of procuring a stout craft, in order to prosecute his search for the _Madre de Dios_ treasure.  Shortly after the arrival of my uncle I had an attack of smallpox, which, Heaven be praised! left me unmarked. Master Blackwood, the chirurgeon, tended me with the utmost care, though at the time I feared his remedies more than I did the disorder.  August had run its course, and September was well advanced ere I could get abroad once more, and during that time much had happened relating to the ill-fortuned rising in the West.  Monmouth's head had rolled on the scaffold on Tower Hill, and Jeffreys had completed his circuit of the West, leaving behind him a never-to-be-forgotten record of cruelty, infamy, and shame, while his brutal actions in condemning Lady Alice Lisle to the stake sickened even the most loyal supporters of King James.  Then, and only then, did I realize the risk we had run in harbouring Captain Jeremy; yet I had learnt to look upon him as the one stanch friend in my solitude, and as such I would right willingly take all chances could I but render him further aid.  At the first opportunity, directly I felt strong enough, I crossed the heath and stealthily approached his place of concealment. In vain I gave the call of the red deer, for no welcome reply came from the yawning pit; and when at length I descended by the rude ladder I found the place dank and deserted. Captain Miles and his men had gone--whither?--to bondage, or to freedom?  Neither did I from that day set eyes on Black Lewis; he, too, had vanished, and thus all chance of communicating with the honest Captain seemed to be hopelessly lost.  One afternoon towards the close of September I was sent by my uncle into Lymington to procure some books that an acquaintance had promised him.  It was a blustering day, cold for the time of year, and on the journey I encountered several heavy showers that, for want of shelter, soaked me to the skin. However, I accomplished my errand, and laden with a heavy burden I trudged homewards, having also taken the opportunity of obtaining from a cutler's the blade of the dagger with which my father had been slain, I having left it some weeks before for the purpose of having a hilt fitted to it.  At the outskirts of the village I almost ran into the arms of Captain Jeremy, who was leading a heavy cob by the bridle.  For a few moments I could scarce believe my eyes; yet 'twas he, bold, jovial, and beaming with kindliness as of yore, before that fateful journey to the West.  \"What cheer, ho!\" he shouted. \"I've sought you high and low.\"  \"Oh, Captain Miles!\" I exclaimed apprehensively, \"is it safe for you to be seen, sir?\"  \"Safe?\" he roared. \"Why, safe as a parson's barn. Thanks to my patron Sir William Soams, of whom I have oft spoken beforetimes, and in no small measure to a heavy drain upon my hidden hoard, I've gained a pardon from His Majesty, and now I can flaunt my Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys, or any of his satellites, come what may. I've got a ship, lad! A. goodly vessel--as sweet a little craft as ever you'd clap eyes on betwixt Yarmouth and Bristol. Thanks once again to Sir William Soams, who threw himself into my plans, the _Golden Hope_ has been chartered to seek the _Madre_ treasure--and I'll warrant Sir William will receive a good per centum on his outlay. She lies at Poole, lad. We sailed her round from Deptford two days agone, I and the ten lads you saw in the hole on Brockenhurst Heath, they having made their way safely one by one to a rendezvous at Wapping; and I've ridden over from Poole to tell you the news, though I am but a sorry horseman.\"  \"You rode well enough when you fled before the dragoons, sir.\"  \"Aye,\" he replied, with a hearty laugh; \"e'en though I rode the farmer's mare to death. It beats me to think how I kept in the saddle that day, and I've fallen thrice on my way hither; yet 'tis strange what a man will do when he's put to it. But can you persuade your uncle to let you ride over to Poole and see the _Golden Hope_ ere we sail? We weigh on Saturday morn, for 'tis, as you know, ill luck to leave port on a Friday.\"  I shook my head sorrowfully.  \"I fear he'll not think of it,\" I replied. \"But, Captain Jeremy, how I wish I were off with you!\"  \"'Tis not to be thought of, lad. Adventuring in the Indies is no fit business for you. I've spun you yarns times without number, but you've not heard of the dark side of a seaman's life. No, no, Clifford; make the best of things and bide at home, and I'll do my best for you and me.\"  \"But, Captain----\"  \"No buts, lad; your duty lies at home. Now, say no more on 't, though I would you could see the _Golden Hope_ ere she leaves Poole Harbour. Well, well, the best of friends must say farewell, and so 'tis with us. Please Heaven another couple o' years will see us home once more with the treasure; so good-bye, Clifford.\"  \"Farewell, Captain Jeremy, and God be with you!\"  Awkwardly the seaman scrambled into the saddle, urged his nag into a trot, and set off along the Christchurch Road, not daring to look round for fear of losing his seat. I watched him till his burly figure disappeared from view, then slowly I made my way homewards.  \"Why have you tarried on your errand, sirrah?\" demanded my uncle, as I placed the pile of heavy books on the table. \"Hast entered into worldly and unbecoming conversation with that seafaring man who, with many strange oaths on his lips, hath troubled me with his presence? To your room, sir! Supperless you shall go; but before retiring, read, mark, and learn the beautiful discourse on procrastination as set forth in this book of godly sermons. To-morrow I'll speak further on this matter.\"  On the morrow he did more than speak, being a too zealous exponent of King Solomon for my peace of mind; and, smarting under the treatment I had endured, I determined to run away and join, by hook or by crook, the good ship _Golden Hope_.     CHAPTER IX  Flight   I had no sooner made up my mind than I immediately began to take steps to put my plan into execution, for the _Golden Hope_ was to sail at early morn on the following day, and twenty good miles had to be covered betwixt sunset and sunrise, were I to be in time.  My great regret was that I was unable to let Constance know of my departure; but beyond that I cared little.  I managed to secrete the best part of a loaf, some cheese, and a small flask of milk; and unobserved I secured a lengthy rope, which I hid under my bed.  Longer and more tedious than ever seemed the evening prayers, but at last my uncle bade me retire for the night. I lay abed till I heard him fastening my door on the outside, as was his wont, and go to his room. Then, when all was quiet, I hurriedly dressed, packed my food in a wallet, and prepared to escape by the window. As 'twas a calm moonlight night, the tree that served my father's murderer so timely did not sway sufficiently for me to descend by it, and for that reason I had provided myself with the rope.  This I passed round a leg of the massive bedstead, throwing the two ends out of the casement on to the ground. Noiselessly I slipped out, and grasping both parts of the rope, I descended hand over hand. Then it was an easy matter to pull the rope down after me, so as to remove all traces of my escape, which, I hoped, would prevent my flight being discovered for some hours later than otherwise.  Having hidden the rope, I set out with a rapid stride and beating heart on my long walk to Poole Town.  For the first few miles my route lay over well-known ground, but soon I plunged into the thickest portion of the forest, where the tall branches, meeting overhead, shut out the moonlight. 'Twas a weird journey in the dead of night, with not a sound save my own footsteps and the occasional hooting of an owl in the tree tops.  At length I left the confines of the New Forest, the road continuing hilly yet fair-going; and having gotten well into the swing, I footed it strongly.  Just as I reached the meeting of two fork roads I heard the distant thud of a horse's hoofs, which came rapidly nearer and nearer.  Could my flight have been discovered already?  Plunging through a gap in the bushes I stood, my heart throbbing violently, expecting every moment to see my uncle's manservant on my"]]]
