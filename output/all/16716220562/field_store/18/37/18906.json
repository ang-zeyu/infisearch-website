The family burying-ground was at Waltham, where eight generations were then sleeping--that is, eight generations of Pickerings and Bemises. There were the bodies of my great-grandmother, and of ancestors belonging to the first Colonial days. My cousin, George Pickering Bemis, Mayor of Omaha, afterward had a monument erected over the spot where so many Bemises and Pickerings lay in their long rest, to preserve their memory. But my father's body was never to rest there; nor was it ever seen by any of his relatives.  My uncle, John Clarke, Jr., who had brought me out of New Orleans and rescued me from the plague, tried to find some trace of my father; but no record or vestige of him could be found in that city. Every trace of him had been swept away. His very existence there had been forgotten, erased. No one could be found who had ever heard of him, or knew anything about his store. So completely had the pestilence done its terrible work of destruction and obliteration. As this period was prior to the invention of the daguerreotype, we had no photographs of him. The only likenesses that were made then were expensive miniatures on ivory. I have no picture of him, except the one I carry forever in my memory.  Sixty years passed away. One day I received a letter from one of my cousins, Louisa Train, who was living in Michigan. She told me that her father and mother had died, and that the furniture of the old house, in which they and her grandparents had lived, had fallen to her. \"In moving an old bureau,\" she wrote, \"it fell to pieces, and, to my surprise, two documents rolled upon the floor. These papers relate to you. One of them was a letter from your father to his mother, written from New Orleans shortly before you left that city. In it he says:  \"'You can imagine my loneliness in being in this great house, always so lively, with eleven persons in it, including my own family--now all alone. George is with his tutor. He is a very extraordinary boy, though only four years old. The other day he repeated some verses, of which I can remember these lines:      \"'I am monarch of all I survey;       My right there is none to dispute;     From the center all round to the sea,       I am lord of the fowl and the brute.'\"  I was to receive one other message from my father. Since I began writing this autobiography, my aged aunt, Abigail Pickering Frost, now in her ninetieth year, discovered a letter that my father had written to her and to her sister, my aunt Alice, who afterward married Henry A. Winslow, upon the day that he placed me on the ship Henry, and sent me to my grandmother at Waltham, Mass. Aunt Abigail, after the death of aunt Alice, who was one of the victims in the wreck of the Lexington, in January, '40, hid the letter in the garret of the old Waltham farmhouse, where she later discovered it. She now sends it to me from her home in Omaha, Neb., where it had again been lost, and found after a long search, as she knew that I would appreciate it as a part of my life-story.  The letter came to me as a wail from the dead. I was very young, and childish, and thoughtless when I parted from him forever; but his letter brought back to me in a flood the bitterness of our life in New Orleans, the loneliness of my father in his great grief, and made me suffer, nearly seventy years afterward, for the pain that I was then too young to understand or feel. I give this letter, which is inexpressibly dear to me, just as it was written.                                        \"NEW ORLEANS, _June 10th, 1833_.       \"DEAR SISTERS ABIGAIL AND ALICE:       \"'Tis just two years since I left this place for New York, and      arrived in Boston the evening of the 3d of July. I hope MY DEAR      BOY will arrive safe and pass the 4th of July with you. He is now      on board the ship (and the steamboat alongside the ship) to the      Balize. I have written several letters by the ship, and found I      had a few moments to spare which I will improve by addressing      you. I refer you to the letters to Mother Pickering for      _particulars_--as I have not time to say much. I can only say, my      dear girls, that I am very unhappy here for reasons you well      know. _I part with George as though I was parting with my right      eye_--but 'tis for his good and the happiness of all that he      should go; take him to your own home, care, and protection; _he      is no ordinary boy, but is destined for a great scholar_.       \"I am left here without a friend except my God! in a city where      the cholera is raging to a great extent--100 are dying daily! and      among them some of the most valuable citizens. A sweet little      girl about the age of Ellen, and an intimate acquaintance of      George's, who used to walk arm in arm with him, died this morning      with the cholera, and a great number of others among our most      intimate acquaintances have passed on. Mrs. Simons died in six      hours! What is life worth to me? Oh, my dear sisters! could I      leave this dreadful place I would, and die among my friends! The      thoughts of my dear Maria and Ellen fill me with sorrow! I have      mourned over their tombs in silence. I have been with them in my      dreams, and frequently I meet them in my room and talk with them      as though alive. All here is melancholy. When shall I see you,      God only knows! I have relieved my heavy heart of a burden--a      weight that was almost unsupportable.       \"In parting with my _lovely boy_ I have bequeathed him to Mother      Pickering as a legacy--it being all that I possess! You will take      a share of the care, and I know will be all that mothers could be      for your dear sister Maria's sake!       \"Give my love to Grandpa Bemis, Father Pickering, and all the      rest of the family. Say to them that _my mind is constantly with      them_, and will ever be so. I have written in great haste and      very badly, as I am on board the ship and _all is confusion_,      with the steamboat alongside. Farewell, my dear sisters! Do write      me a line. If you knew how much I prize a letter from you, you      would write often. Adieu, and believe me your affectionate      brother,                                                          \"OLIVER TRAIN.      \"To Misses ABIGAIL and ALICE PICKERING,     _Waltham, Mass._\"  The other document mentioned by my cousin Louisa, was the deed of a farm by my paternal grandfather, making a certain physician trustee of the property. I never came into that property! This was my first bequest. I had begun, even in my infancy, to give away my property, and I have thrown it away ever since. This first \"bequest,\" however, was none of my making, although I accepted it, without trying to question the matter.  Another involuntary \"bequest\" of my childhood was brought about in this way. My mother, when a girl, was engaged to marry Stebbins Fiske. It was by a mere chance that they were not married--and therefore my name is \"Train\" by a mere accident which changed the fate of my mother and her fianc√©. My father was a warm friend of Stebbins Fiske, and when Fiske was called suddenly to New Orleans, just before the day set for the marriage, he left his betrothed, Maria Pickering, in charge of my father. The result might have been foreseen. It is the common theme of romance the world over. My mother and my father fell in love with each other, and were married. There was no thought of unfaithfulness; it was merely inevitable. Fiske understood the situation, and forgave both of them, and continued the stanch friend of both.  In his will Fiske left a small sum--$5,000--to my mother's mother. It was the most delicate way in which he could leave some of his money so that his old sweetheart might get it. The terms of the will were that this money should be divided at my grandmother's death. It was so divided, and a certain portion of it should have come to me; but I never received a penny. This was my second bequest, for I allowed others to take freely what belonged to me.  My third bequest was made with my eyes open. When I was about starting for Australia in '53, another uncle-in-law, George W. Frost, whom I afterward appointed purchasing agent of the Union Pacific Railway, a splendid gentleman and a clergyman, came to me and said: \"Your Aunt Abbie\" (his wife) \"and myself are going to take care of your old grandmother on the farm. Have you any objections to signing away your interest in the old place?\"  I said that, of course, I would sign it away. I was all right. I was going out into the great world to make fortunes. And I signed it away, as if it were a mere nothing.  These incidents I mention here as illustrations of my whole life. Since my fourth year I have given away--thrown away--money. I have made others rich. But I have never yet got what was due me from others.     CHAPTER II  MY VOYAGE FROM NEW ORLEANS TO BOSTON  1833   I found myself a part of the cargo--shipped as freight, 2,000 miles, from the tropics to the arctic region, without a friend to take care of me. I was alone. This feeling, however, did not oppress me overmuch. Every one on board tried to make a pet of me, and, besides, there was so much to do, so much to see, so much to feel. From cabin to fo'cas'le I was made welcome.  There was only one cabin passenger besides myself. I sat at table opposite this passenger, and I remember that at the first meal they brought on some \"flapjacks\" (our present-day wheat-cakes). I was very fond of them, and ate them with sirup or molasses. I noticed that my companion in the cabin did not use molasses with his. I could not understand why any one should eat his flapjacks without molasses.  I thought this stranger too ignorant to know that molasses was the proper thing with flapjacks, and tried to help him to a fuller knowledge of the resources of the table. I reached over, and tried to pour some molasses on his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38265"],["title","My Life in Many States and in Foreign Lands, Dictated in My Seventy-Fourth Year (#4)"],["body","te. Just then a heavy sea struck the ship, and I was thrown forward with a lurch. The entire contents of the molasses jug went in a flood over the man's trousers! Of course he was furious, and did not appreciate my efforts to teach him. I expected him to strike me, but he did not. It did not occur to me to beg his pardon, as I was doing what I thought to be a pure act of kindness. We afterward became good friends.  We were twenty-three days on the voyage. Before we had been aboard long I became friendly with everybody on the ship, and they with me. I was very active, and had the run of the boat. I was like a parrot, a goat, or a monkey--or all three. There was no stewardess on the boat, and as I had no one to look after me, I led a wild sort of life. I lived in the fo'cas'le, or with the sailors on deck or in the riggings. I liked the fo'cas'le best. I soon got to feel at home there. Sometimes I was in the cabin with my molasses-hating friend, but the fo'cas'le was my delight, and there I was to be found at all hours. During the twenty-three days of the voyage I was not washed once! I wore the same clothes days and nights, and became a little dirty savage!  It may be easily imagined that communication with these rough, coarse, honest, but vulgar sailors had a terrible effect on me. Everything bad that is known to sailors these sailors knew, and very soon I knew. I observed everything, learned everything. I soon cursed and swore as roundly as any of them, using the words as innocently as if they were quotations from the Bible.  One of the games the sailors used to play with me was to go up into the rigging and call down to me that there was a great plantation up there that I could not see. Then they would throw lumps of sugar to me and tell me they came from the plantation in the rigging, and monkeys were throwing them to me. Of course I believed it all. How was I to know they were lying to me? I was only four years old. They stamped upon my mind the whole fo'cas'le--its rough life, its jollity, its oaths, and its lies.  As soon as our ship came to anchor out came a boat with my uncle. I remember that there was a little dog in the boat also. My uncle took me to the wharf, and then to his tobacco store in Dock Square. There I found awaiting us an old-fashioned chaise, and my uncle said he would take me right out to my grandmother's, at Waltham. The drive took us through two or three villages, and through several strips of forest. Finally we drove up to a little gate that stood about half a mile from the old farmhouse, and divided the next place from the farm of my grandmother. There were my aunts, all waiting for me.  Imagine the astonishment of my grandmother and of my aunts on seeing the dirty little street Arab that came to see them! I was as intolerably filthy as any brat that ever came out of a sewer. I fairly reeked with the smells and the dirt of the fo'cas'le! To the dust and grime of New Orleans I had added the dust and grime of the ship, for I had not been near soap and water since I left New Orleans. Fancy going to these clean and prim old ladies in such a plight! But I was at least in good health, and magnificently alive.  The first thing they did was to summon a sort of town-meeting, to have me narrate the events of my voyage. But before I was to go before my audience I must be washed and have a change of clothes. This part of the program was postponed by an accident. The ladies heard me swear! It shocked their gentle minds immeasurably. But I didn't know what swearing meant.  What can not a boy learn in three weeks that is bad? I suppose I must have picked up all the wickedness of the fo'cas'le without knowing what it was. It seemed all right to me; but not to my good grandmother and to my aunts.  They wanted to cleanse me outwardly and inwardly, and prepared to start outwardly. They insisted that I must change my clothes and have a good scrubbing. But before they began I told them some of my experiences aboard ship. I told them about the sailors getting sugar from the plantation up in the riggings and the monkeys throwing it down to me. They told me there were no fields up there, no monkeys and no sugar, except what the sailors had carried up with them.  I was indignant. \"If you don't believe my story,\" said I, \"about the plantation in the rigging and about the monkeys and the sugar, you can not wash me or change my clothes.\"  The line of battle was now drawn. If they did not want to believe my story, I was not going to let them do anything for me. That monkey-and-sugar story was my ultimatum. They refused to accept it. For three days they laid siege to me, but I refused to be washed or clothed in a fresh clean suit until they believed my story. I felt I was telling the truth, and could not bear to have my word doubted. Finally they said that they believed my story.  There is an old tale of a boy who was told by his parents, who did not want him to cling any longer to the old myth about Santa Claus, that it was not Santa Claus that brought him all the good things on Christmas, but that they, his parents, had been giving him the presents year after year. The boy turned to his mother and said: \"Have you been fooling me about the God question too?\"     CHAPTER III  MY BOYHOOD ON A FARM  1833-1843   The old house where I spent these years of my childhood and boyhood is now more than two hundred years old. It was the home of the old Methodists in that section, and had been the headquarters of the sect for a hundred years before it began to have regular \"conferences.\" Here lived the slave-owner Pickering, who married my grandmother, the farmer's daughter. If it had not been for this home, which was a refuge and asylum for the itinerant preacher, grandfather Pickering would have starved. The farm was his anchorage. Otherwise he would have gone adrift.  A religious atmosphere pervaded the place. It left the deepest impress upon my mind. The only paper we took was Zion's Herald, a religious weekly published by Stevens, of Boston. The difference between this calm, religious life of the Methodists and the turbulent, rough, and swearing life of the fo'cas'le was very marked. But it took me a long time to get away from the atmosphere of the fo'cas'le and into that of the Methodists. Even the bath and the clean clothes did not seem to change me very much. I discovered that cleanliness is not so very near to godliness, after all.  Of course the old Methodists had prayers in the morning and at night, and they had grace at every meal. Every one knelt at prayers. But they could not make me kneel. I would not bow the knee. I had not got over the sailors' ways, and the monkeys, and the throwing down sugar from the plantation in the sails--the Santa Claus part of it. I always remembered it.  Of course I was taken to the little church, a mile off up in the woods, where my grandfather preached. It was in his \"circuit.\" As we were coming home one day, and I was driving, the chaise struck a stone, and the old gentleman was jostled considerably. He impatiently seized the reins from me and gave the horse a severe flip with them, and drove the rest of the way himself. The little incident made a deep impression on my mind. I said to myself: \"If this is the way Christians act, I do not want to have anything to do with them.\"  The Pickerings were an ancient Southern--and before that, an English--family. Some of the members lived in South Carolina, some in Virginia, others in Maryland. One of them sat in Washington's first cabinet. Like my grandfather, they were all slave-owners. Judge Gilbert Pickering was chairman of Cromwell's committee that cut off King Charles's head. Grandfather Pickering was a liberal man in many ways. I have spoken already of his freeing his own slaves. He chose the calling of an itinerant Methodist preacher, when to do so meant tremendous financial sacrifice and the loss of social rank. He almost starved at it, but he stuck to it with great nobleness of mind. It gave him a sort of religious freedom.  Once he could have been a bishop in the New England branch of Methodism; but he refused the ambitious title. He did not believe in bishops for their church. And so, setting aside every offer of preferment, every opportunity of rising or getting on in the world, he chose to labor at his simple calling, like a martyr. And he would shortly have found martyrdom in starvation, had it not been for my lovely grandmother, with her thrift and care.  The branch of Methodists to which my grandfather belonged was very liberal. It was so liberal, indeed, that my mother and her five sisters had all been educated at the Ursuline convent at Charlestown, Mass., which was destroyed by the mob in '42. I remember that after the mob burned this convent to the ground the Methodists wanted to buy the site, and applied to the Roman Catholic archbishop in Boston, who replied: \"We sometimes purchase, but we never sell.\"  Another incident of my boyhood may be recalled here, as it illustrates the stubborn pride that had begun to show itself even then. One day an elegant carriage drove up to the old house, and a young lady, beautifully dressed, got out and asked to see George Train. I went up to her, and she told me who she was.  \"You must remember, when you grow up,\" she said, \"that I am Miss Sallie Rhoades. We are one of the few families of Maryland,\" she added, with a pride that was evident even to my boyish eyes, \"that have been able to support their carriages for one hundred and fifty years.\" She spoke with the air of a _grande dame_, which stung my own pride keenly.  \"While I am very glad to meet my Southern relative,\" I said, with equal pride, even if I could not equal her manner, \"we have kept our ox-cart on the old farm for two hundred years.\" I expected the additional half a century to stagger her. But it did not seem to reach home; and she drove away. This was the last I ever saw of \"Miss Sallie Rhoades, of Maryland.\"  In"]]]
