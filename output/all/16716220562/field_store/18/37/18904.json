He came alongside like a lamb, but the instant I started to make my transition from \"Civilization to the Primitive with a click\" he started climbing into the car. The only click I heard was when my ear hit the ground. Roos couldn't have spoiled any more film than I did cuticle, but, being a \"Director,\" he made a good deal more noise about it. After barking his hocks on the fender, \"Grayback\" refused to be enticed within mounting distance of the car again, so finally, with a comparatively un-clicky transition from Civilization to the Primitive, I got aboard by the usual route from the ground.  The next shot was a quarter of a mile farther up the trail. Here Roos found a natural sylvan frame through which to shoot the whole outfit as it came stringing along. Unfortunately, the \"Director\" failed to tell the actors not to look at the camera--that, once and for all, the clicking box must be reckoned as a thing non-existent--and it all had to be done over again. The next time it was better, but the actors still had a wooden expression on their faces. They didn't look at the camera, but the expression on their faces showed that they were conscious of it. Roos then instructed me to talk to my companions, or sing, or do anything that would take their minds off the camera and make them appear relaxed and natural. That time we did it famously. As each, in turn, cantered by the sylvan bower with its clicking camera he was up to his neck \"doing something.\" Nixon was declaiming Lincoln's Gettysburg speech as he had learned it from his phonograph, Gordon was calling his dog, Jim was larruping a straggling pinto and cursing it in fluent local idiom, and I was singing \"Onward, Christian Soldiers!\" We never had any trouble about \"being natural\" after that; but I hope no lip reader ever sees the pictures.  After picking up Roos and his camera we made our real start. One pack-horse was reserved for the camera and tripod, and to prevent him from ranging from the trail and bumping the valuable apparatus against trees or rocks, his halter was tied to the tail of Nixon's saddle animal. Except that the latter's spinal column must have suffered some pretty severe snakings when the camera-carrier went through corduroy bridges or lost his footings in fords, the arrangement worked most successfully. The delicate instrument was not in the least injured in all of the many miles it was jogged over some of the roughest trails I have ever travelled.  The sunshine by which the last of the trail shots was made proved the parting glimmer of what had been a month or more of practically unbroken fair weather. Indeed, the weather had been rather too fine, for, toward the end of the summer, lack of rain in western Canada invariably means forest fires. As these had been raging intermittently for several weeks all over British Columbia, the air had become thick with smoke, and at many places it was impossible to see for more than a mile or two in any direction. Both Roos and Harmon had been greatly hampered in their work about Banff and Lake Louise by the smoke, and both were, therefore, exceedingly anxious for early and copious rains to clear the air. Otherwise, they said, there was no hope of a picture of the Lake of the Hanging Glaciers that would be worth the film it was printed on. They must have rain. Their prayer was about to be answered, in full measure, pressed down and running over--and then some.  We had been encountering contending currents of hot and cold air all the way up the wagon-road from Invermere and the lower valley. Now, as we entered the mountains, these became more pronounced, taking the form of scurrying \"dust-devils\" that attacked from flank and van without method or premonitory signal. The narrowing gorge ahead was packed solid with a sullen phalanx of augmenting clouds, sombre-hued and sagging with moisture, and frequently illumined with forked lightning flashes discharged from their murky depths. Nixon, anxious to make camp before the storm broke, jogged the horses steadily all through the darkening afternoon. It was a point called \"Sixteen-mile\" he was driving for, the first place we would reach where there was room for the tent and feed for the horses. We were still four miles short of our destination when the first spatter of ranging drops opened up, and from there on the batteries of the storm concentrated on us all the way.  We made camp in a rain driving solidly enough to deflect the stroke of an axe. I shall not enlarge upon the acute discomfort of it. Those who have done it will understand; those who have not would never be able to. It was especially trying on the first day out, before the outfit had become shaken down and one had learned where to look for things. Nixon's consummate woodcraftsmanship was put to a severe test, but emerged triumphant. So, too, Jim, who proved himself as impervious to rain as to ill-temper. The fir boughs for the tent floor came in dripping, of course, but there were enough dry tarpaulins and blankets to blot up the heaviest of the moisture, and the glowing little sheet-iron stove licked up the rest. A piping hot dinner drove out the last of the chill, and we spent a snug, comfy evening listening to Nixon yarn about his mountaineering exploits and of the queer birds from New York and London whom he had nursed through strange and various intervals of moose and sheep-hunting in the Kootenays and Rockies. We slept dry but rather cold, especially Roos, who ended up by curling round the stove and stoking between shivers. Nixon and Jim drew generously on their own blanket rolls to help the both of us confine our ebbing animal heat, and yet appeared to find not the least difficulty in sleeping comfortably under half the weight of cover that left us shaking. It was all a matter of what one was used to, of course, and in a few days we began to harden.  It was September tenth that we had started from Invermere, hoping at the time to be able to accomplish what we had set out to do in from four to six days. The rain which had come to break the long dry spell put a very different face on things, however. The eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth we were held in our first camp by an almost continuous downpour, which turned the mountain streams into torrents and raised Horse Thief till it lapped over the rim of the flat upon which our tent was pitched. The night of the thirteenth, with a sharp drop of the temperature, the rain turned to snow, and we crawled out on the fourteenth to find the valley under a light blanket of white. Then the clouds broke away and the sunshine and shadows began playing tag over the scarps and buttresses of the encompassing amphitheatre of mountains. For the first time there was a chance for a glimpse of the new world into which we had come. The transition from the cultivation and the gentle wooded slopes of Windermere was startling. Under the mask of the storm clouds we had penetrated from a smooth, rounded, pleasant country to one that was cliffy and pinnacled and bare--a country that was all on end, a land whose bones showed through. A towering Matterhorn reared its head six or eight thousand feet above us, and so near that slabs of rock cracked away from its scarred summit were lying just across the trail from the tent. The peaks walling in Horse Thief to the north were not so high but no less precipitous and barren, while to the west a jumble of splintered pinnacles whose bases barred the way were still lost in the witch-dance of the clouds. A tourist folder would have called it a \"Land of Titans,\" but Jim, leaning on his axe after nicking off a fresh back-log for the camp fire, merely opined it was \"some skookum goat country. But not a patch,\" he added, \"to what we'll be hittin' to-night if we get them _geesly_ hawsses rounded up in time fer a start 'fore noon.\"  It appeared that the horses, with their grazing spoiled by the snow, had become restless, broken through the barrier Nixon had erected at a bridge just below camp, and started on the back trail for Invermere. As their tracks showed that they had broken into a trot immediately beyond the bridge, it looked like a long stern-chase, and Nixon did not reckon on being able to hit the trail for several hours. Roos grasped the occasion to make a couple of \"camp life\" shots his fertile brain had conceived the idea of during the long storm-bound days of enforced inaction. In one of these the \"sportsman\" was to go to bed in silhouette by candlelight. Ostensibly this was to be the shadow of a man crawling into his blankets _inside_ of the tent, and taken from the outside. In reality, however, Roos set up his camera _inside_ of the tent and shot the antics of the shadow the sunlight threw on the canvas when I went through the motions of turning in close against the _outside_ of the wall. This went off smartly and snappily; but I would have given much for a translation of the voluble comments of a passing Indian who pulled up to watch the agile action of the retiring \"sportsman.\"  It was while Roos was rehearsing me for this shot that Gordon must have heard him iterating his invariable injunction that I should not be a \"foot-hog,\" meaning, I shall hardly need to explain, that I should be quick in my movements so as not to force him to use an undue footage of film. A little later I overheard the boy asking Jim what a \"foot-hog\" was. \"I don't quite _kumtrux_ myself,\" the sturdy blacksmith-packer replied, scratching his head. \"It sounds as if it might be suthin like pig's feet, but they want actin' as if they wuz ready to eat anythin', 'less it was each other.\" Now that I think of it, I can see how the clash of the artistic temperaments of \"Director\" and \"Star\" over just about every one of the shots they made might have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38265"],["title","My Life in Many States and in Foreign Lands, Dictated in My Seventy-Fourth Year (#0)"],["body","Team (http://www.pgdp.net) from images generously made available by Internet Archive/American Libraries (http://www.archive.org/details/americana)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

Appleton and Company     1902      Copyright, 1902     by D. Appleton and Company      Published November, 1902      MY LIFE IN MANY STATES  AND IN FOREIGN LANDS            TO THE CHILDREN     AND TO THE CHILDREN'S CHILDREN       IN THIS AND IN ALL LANDS     WHO LOVE AND BELIEVE IN ME       BECAUSE THEY KNOW     I LOVE AND BELIEVE IN THEM     PREFACE   I have been silent for thirty years. During that long period I have taken little part in the public life of the world, have written nothing beyond occasional letters and newspaper articles, and have conversed with few persons, except children in parks and streets. I have found children always sympathetic and appreciative. For this reason I have readily entered into their play and their more serious moods; and for this reason, also, have dedicated this book to them and to their children.  For many years I have been a silent recluse, remote from the world in my little corner in the Mills Hotel, thinking and waiting patiently. That I break this silence now, after so many years, is due to the suggestion of a friend who has told me that the world of to-day, as well as the world of to-morrow, will be interested in reading my story. I am assured that many of the things I have accomplished will endure as a memorial of me, and that I ought to give some account of them and of myself.  And so I have tried to compress a story of my life into this book. With modesty, I may say that the whole story could not be told in a single volume. I have tried not to be prolix, keeping in mind while preparing this record of events, \"all of which I saw, and part of which I was,\" that there is a limit to the patience of readers.  I beg my readers to remember that this book was spoken, not written, by me. It is my own life-story that I have related. It may not, in every part, agree with the recollections of others; but I am sure that it is as accurate in statement as it is blameless in purpose. If I should fail at any point, this will be due to some wavering of memory, and not to intention. Thanks to my early Methodist training, I have never knowingly told a lie; and I shall not begin at this time of life.  While I may undertake other volumes that will present another side of me--my views and opinions of men and things--that which stands here recorded is the story of my life. It has been dictated in the mornings of July and August of the past summer, one or two hours being given to it during two or three days of each week. Altogether, the time consumed in the dictation makes a total of thirty-five hours. Before I began the dictation, I wrote out hastily a brief sketch, or mere epitome, of my history, so that I might have before my mind a guide that would prevent me from wandering too far afield or that might save me from tediousness. I give it here, as a foretaste of the book. I have called it \"My Autobiography boiled down--400 Pages in 200 Words.\"  \"Born 3-24-'29. Orphaned New Orleans, '33. (Father, mother, and three sisters--yellow fever.) Came North alone, four years old, to grandmother, Waltham, Mass. Supported self since babyhood. Farmer till 14.

Second, eighty days, '70. Third, sixty-seven and a half days, '90. Fourth, sixty days, shortest record, '92. Through psychic telepathy, am doubling age. Seventy-four years young.\"  It may be a matter of surprise to some readers that I should have accomplished so much at the early age when so many of my most important enterprises were accomplished. It should be remembered, however, that I began young. I was a mature man at an age when most boys are still tied to their mothers' apron strings. I had to begin to take care of myself in very tender years. I suppose my experiences in New Orleans, on the old farm in Massachusetts, in the grocery store in Boston, and in the shipping house of Enoch Train and Company, matured and hardened me before my time. I was never much of a boy. I seem to have missed that portion of my youth. I was obliged to look out for myself very early, and was soon fighting hard in the fierce battle of competition, where the weak are so often lost.  It may be worth while to present here some important evidence of the confidence that was reposed in me by experienced men, when, as a mere youth, I was undertaking vast enterprises that might have made older men hesitate. When I was about to leave Boston in '53 for business in Australia, and organized the house of Caldwell, Train and Company, I was authorized by the following well-established houses of this and other countries to use them as references, and did so on our firm circulars: John M. Forbes, John E. Thayer and Brother, George B. Upton, Enoch Train and Company, Sampson and Tappan, and Josiah Bradlee and Company, of Boston; Cary and Company, Goodhue and Company, Josiah Macy and Sons, Grinnell, Minturn and Company, and Charles H. Marshall and Company, of New York; H. and A. Cope and Company, of Philadelphia; Birckhead and Pearce, of Baltimore; J. P. Whitney and Company, of New Orleans; Flint, Peabody and Company, and Macondray and Company, of San Francisco; George A. Hopley and Company, of Charleston; Archibald Gracie, of Mobile; and the following foreign houses: Bowman, Grinnell and Company, and Charles Humberston, of Liverpool; Russell and Company and Augustine Heard and Company, of Canton.  These were among the best known commercial houses in the world at that time. Any business man, familiar with the commercial history of the modern world, should consider this list fair enough evidence of the confidence I enjoyed among men of affairs. Let me reproduce here--partly as evidence along the same line, and partly because of the value I attach to it on personal and friendly grounds--the following letter from Mr. D. O. Mills:                                        \"NEW YORK, _September 30, 1901_.     \"Hon. GEORGE FRANCIS TRAIN,           \"_Mills Hotel, Bleecker St., New York_.      \"MY DEAR CITIZEN:      \"The many appreciative notices that have come to my attention of     your distinguished talents of early years lead me also to send you     a line of appreciation, particularly as touching the part played     by you in some of the great commercial enterprises that have so     signally marked the nineteenth century, notably in the Merchant     Marine, and in the building of the Union Pacific Railroad, in the     conception and construction of which you bore so distinguished a     part.      \"The present generation, with its conveniences of travel and     communication, can not realize what were the difficulties and     experiences of the merchant and traveler of those early days when     you were engaged in the China trade, and your Clipper Ships were     often seen in the port of San Francisco.      \"The long voyage around the Horn, the danger experienced from     sudden attack by Indians while traversing the wild and uninhabited     country lying between Omaha and the Pacific Coast, are experiences     which even an old voyager like myself questions as he speeds     across the continent, privileged to enjoy the comforts of a     Pullman car, and a railroad service that has shortened the journey     from New York to San Francisco from months to a few days. In     recalling the many years of our pleasant acquaintance by sea and     land, not the least is the remembrance of your kind and genial     spirit, and I am glad to see that you have lost none of your     sincere wish to do good.      \"With kind regards.                   \"Very truly yours,                               \"D.
