The avoidance of interspecific competition in feeding is well illustrated by three species of snakes that probably are the primary ophidian predators on frogs. _Drymobius margaritiferus margaritiferus_ is diurnal and terrestrial; it feeds on frogs at the edges of breeding ponds by day. Also during the day _Leptophis mexicanus mexicanus_ feeds on frogs in bushes and trees. At night the activities of both of these species is replaced by those of _Leptodeira septentrionalis polysticta_, which not only feeds on the frogs in the trees and bushes, but descends to the ground and even enters the water in search of food.  From the examples discussed above, the importance of the three dimensional aspect of the rainforest is apparent. The presence of a large and diverse habitat above the ground is of great significance in the rainforest, for of the non-aquatic components of the herpetofauna in the rainforests of southern El Petén, 42 per cent of the species spend at least part of their lives in the bushes and trees. Another important part of the forest is the subterranean level--the rich mulch, underground tunnels, and rotting subterranean vegetation. Of the 78 species of amphibians and reptiles in southern El Petén, seven are primarily fossorial, and half-a-dozen others are secondarily fossorial. Probably the fossorial members of the fauna are the least well represented in the collection, for such widespread species as _Dermophis mexicanus mexicanus_, _Rhadinaea decorata decorata_ and _Tantilla schistosa schistosa_ were expected, but not found.  In the following discussion of the ecological distribution of amphibians and reptiles in the rainforest I have depended chiefly on my observations made in southern El Petén, but have taken into consideration observations made on the same species in other regions, together with reports from other workers. The reader should keep in mind that the evidence varies from species to species. Of some species I have observed only one animal in the field; of others, I have seen scores and sometimes hundreds of individuals. For species on which I have few observations or rather inconclusive evidence, the circumstance of inadequate data is mentioned.  In analyzing the ecological distribution within the forest, it is convenient to recognize five subdivisions (habitats); each is treated below as a unit.  1. AQUATIC.--This habitat includes permanent streams and rivers (Pl. 10, fig. 1), some of which are clear and others muddy. In the rainy season temporary ponds form in depressions on the forest floor (Pl. 10, fig. 2); these are important as breeding sites for many species of amphibians. Aquatic members of the herpetofauna are here considered to be those species that either spend the greatest part of their lives in the water or usually retreat to water for shelter. Seven species of turtles and one crocodilian are aquatic. Of these, _Dermatemys mawi_, _Staurotypus triporcatus_, and _Pseudemys scripta ornata_ inhabit clear water, whereas _Chelydra rossignoni_, _Claudius angustatus_, _Kinosternon acutum_, and _K. leucostomum_ inhabit muddy water. _Crocodylus moreleti_ apparently inhabits both clear and muddy water, for in the dry season it lives along the clear rivers, but in the rainy season inhabits flooded areas in the forest as well.  2. AQUATIC MARGIN.--Extensive marshes were lacking in the part of southern El Petén that I visited; consequently, the aquatic margin habitat is there limited to the edges of rivers and borders of temporary ponds. _Bufo marinus_, _Rana palmipes_, and _Rana pipiens_ are characteristic inhabitants of the aquatic margin, although in the rainy reason _Bufo marinus_ often is found away from water. Observations indicate that _Tretanorhinus nigroluteus lateralis_ inhabits the margins of ponds and streams and actually spends considerable time in the water. Although _Iguana iguana rhinolopha_ is arboreal, it lives in trees along rivers, into which it plunges upon being disturbed. Species included in this category are those that customarily spend most of their lives at the edge of permanent water. Frogs and toads that migrate to the water for breeding and the snakes that prey on the frogs at that time are not assigned to the aquatic-margin habitat.  3. FOSSORIAL.--Characteristic inhabitants of the mulch on the forest floor are _Bolitoglossa moreleti mulleri_, _Lepidophyma flavimaculatum flavimaculatum_, _Scincella cherriei cherriei_, _Ninia sebae sebae_, _Pliocercus euryzonus aequalis_, and _Micrurus affinis apiatus_. Other species of snakes that spend most of their lives above ground often forage in the mulch layer; among these are _Coniophanes bipunctatus biserialis_, _Coniophanes fissidens fissidens_, _Coniophanes imperialis clavatus_, _Lampropeltis doliata polyzona_, and _Stenorrhina degenhardti_. Among the amphibians, at least _Hypopachus cuneus nigroreticulatus_, _Eleutherodactylus rostralis_, and _Syrrhophus leprus_ are known to seek shelter in the mulch.  4. TERRESTRIAL.--One turtle, _Geoemyda areolata_, is primarily terrestrial. Among the lizards, conspicuous terrestrial species are _Anolis humilis uniformis_ and _Ameiva festiva edwardsi_; _Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei_ and _Basiliscus vittatus_ spend part of their lives on the ground, but also live on trees and in bushes. _Eumeces schwartzei_ and _E. sumichrasti_ apparently are terrestrial. The only terrestrial lizard that is nocturnal is _Coleonyx elegans elegans_, which by day hides in the leaf litter or below ground. Nocturnal amphibians that are terrestrial include _Bufo marinus_, _Bufo valliceps valliceps_, _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus rugulosus_, _Syrrhophus leprus_, and _Hypopachus cuneus nigroreticulatus_. A large number of active diurnal snakes are terrestrial; these include _Boa constrictor imperator_, _Clelia clelia clelia_, _Dryadophis melanolomus laevis_, _Drymarchon corais melanurus_, _Drymobius margaritiferus margaritiferus_, _Pseustes poecilonotus poecilonotus_, and _Spilotes pullatus mexicanus_. Nocturnal terrestrial snakes include three kinds of _Bothrops_ (_B. atrox asper_, _B. nasutus_, and _B. nummifer nummifer_), all of which seem to be equally active by day.  5. ARBOREAL.--In this habitat the third dimension (height) of the rainforest probably is the most complex insofar as the inter-relationships of species and ecological niches are concerned. I have attempted to categorize species as to microhabitats within the arboreal habitat; in so doing, I recognize four subdivisions--bushes, tree trunks, tree tops, and epiphytes.  Bush inhabitants include several species of lizards and snakes, all of which have rather elongate, slender bodies, and long tails. Common bush-inhabitants in southern El Petén are _Anolis limifrons rodriguezi_, _Basiliscus vittatus_, _Laemanctus deborrei_, _Leptophis mexicanus mexicanus_, and _Oxybelis aeneus aeneus_. All of these are diurnal, and all but _Laemanctus_ have been observed sleeping on bushes at night.  Tree-trunk inhabitants include five species of lizards. _Thecadactylus rapicaudus_ lives on the trunks of large trees; _Sphaerodactylus lineolatus_ lives beneath the bark on dead trees and on corozo palms. _Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei_ lives on the bases and buttresses of large trees, from which it often descends to the ground. _Corythophanes cristatus_ and _Anolis capito_ were found only on tree trunks and large vines.  The least information is available for the species living in the tree tops. The following species were obtained from tops of trees when they were felled, or have been observed living in the tree tops: _Anolis biporcatus_, _Iguana iguana rhinolopha_, _Celestus rozellae_, _Leptodeira septentrionalis polysticta_, _Leptophis ahaetulla praestans_, _Sibon dimidiata dimidiata_, and _Sibon nebulata nebulata_.  Epiphytes, especially the bromeliads, provide refuge for a variety of tree frogs and small snakes. Of the tree frogs, _Hyla picta_, _Hyla staufferi_, _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_, _Similisca baudini_, and _Similisca phaeota cyanosticta_ have been found in bromeliads; other species probably occur there. Among the snakes, _Imantodes cenchoa leucomelas_, _Leptodeira frenata malleisi_, _Leptodeira septentrionalis polysticta_, _Sibon dimidiata dimidiata_, and _Sibon nebulata nebulata_ are frequent inhabitants of bromeliads; all of these snakes are nocturnal.   Relationships of the Fauna  Most of the 78 species of amphibians and reptiles definitely known from the rainforest in southern El Petén have extensive ranges in the Atlantic lowlands of southern México and Central America; many extend into South America. Sixty-two (80%) of the species belong to this group having extensive ranges in Middle America. Three species (_Syrrhophus leprus_, _Leptodeira frenata_, and _Kinosternon acutum_) are at the southern limits of their distributions in southern El Petén and northern Alta Verapaz, whereas _Eleutherodactylus rostralis_ and _Thecadactylus rapicaudus_ are at the northern and western limits of their distributions in El Petén. Nine (11%) species have the center of their distributions in El Petén and the Yucatán Peninsula; representatives of this group include _Claudius angustatus_, _Dermatemys mawi_, _Laemanctus deborrei_, and _Eumeces schwartzei_.  In determining a measure of faunal resemblance, I have departed from the formulae discussed by Simpson (1960) and have analyzed the degree of resemblance by the following formula used to calculate an index of faunal relationships:        C (2) / (N_{1} + N_{2}) = R, where        C = species common to both faunas.        N_{1} = number of species in the first fauna.        N_{2} = number of species in the second fauna.        R = degree of relationships (when R = 1.00, the faunas are       identical; when R = 0, the faunas are completely different).  The herpetofauna of southern El Petén has been compared with that in the Tikal-Uaxactún area (Stuart, 1958), that in the humid lowlands of Alta Verapaz (Stu"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38398"],["title","Amphibians and Reptiles of the Rainforests of Southern El Petén, Guatemala (#3)"],["body","art, 1950, plus additional data), and that in the Mexican state of Yucatán (Smith and Taylor, 1945, 1948, and 1950). The herpetofaunas of lowland Alta Verapaz and Yucatán are the largest, having respectively 94 and 91 species, where as there are 78 species known from southern El Petén and 64 from the Tikal-Uaxactún area. An analysis of faunal relationships (Table 2) shows that the faunas of the rainforests of southern El Petén and lowland Alta Verapaz are closely related. The relationships between these two areas and the Tikal-Uaxactún area in northern El Petén is notably less. Apparently the biggest faunal changes take place between southern El Petén and the Tikal-Uaxactún area, and between the latter and Yucatán. As stated by Stuart (1958:7) the Tikal-Uaxactún is transitional between the humid rainforests to the south and the dry outer end of the Yucatán Peninsula. The transitional nature of the environment is exemplified by a rather depauperate herpetofauna consisting of some species of both dry and humid environments and lacking a large fauna typical of either. Contrariwise, the continuity of the environment from southern El Petén to the lowlands of Alta Verapaz is reflected in degree of resemblance of the herpetofaunas.

ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES   In the following pages various aspects of the occurrence, life histories, ecology, and variation of the species of amphibians and reptiles known from southern El Petén are discussed. Only _Cochranella fleischmanni_ reported by Stuart (1937) from Río Subín at Santa Teresa was not collected by us and is excluded. Because more worthwhile information was gathered for some species than others, the length and completeness of the accounts vary. All specimens listed are in the Museum of Natural History at the University of Kansas, to which institution all catalog numbers refer. Preceding the discussion of each species is an alphabetical list of localities from which specimens were obtained; numbers after a locality indicate the number of specimens obtained at each locality.   =Bolitoglossa dofleini= (Werner)        Chinajá, 1.  An adult female having minute ovarian eggs has a snout-vent length of 81 mm., a tail length of 59 mm., 13 costal grooves, two intercostal spaces between adpressed toes, 38-35 vomerine teeth in irregular rows forming a broad arch from a point posterolaterad to the internal nares to a point near the anterior edge of the parasphenoid teeth, and 43-44 maxilliary-premaxillary teeth. In life the dorsum was rusty brown with irregular black and orange spots and streaks. The flanks were bluish gray with black in the costal grooves and creamy tan flecks along the ventral edge of the flank. The belly and underside of the tail were yellowish tan with dark brown spots laterally. The limbs were orange proximally and black distally; the pads of the feet were bluish black. The dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tail were yellowish orange with black spots. The iris was grayish yellow.  Stuart (1943:17) reported this species from Finca Volcán, Alta Verapaz. He diagnosed his specimens as having 13 costal grooves and two or three intercostal spaces between adpressed toes. He stated that the vomerine teeth were about 12 in number and that in life the dorsum was mottled gray and black, the sides gray and brown, and the undersurfaces uniformly dark gray. These specimens differ noticeably from the individual from Chinajá in the number of vomerine teeth and in coloration.  In August, 1961, I obtained a specimen of _Bolitoglossa dofleini_ at Finca Los Alpes, Alta Verapaz, approximately 13 kilometers airline south-southwest of Finca Volcán and at approximately the same elevation. Although the salamander was dead when found, it obviously was more heavily pigmented than the individual from Chinajá. The belly was bluish gray with black spots laterally; the dorsum was dull brownish gray with some brownish red streaks. The specimen is a female having small ovarian eggs, a snout-vent length of 90 mm., 13 costal grooves, and two intercostal spaces between adpressed limbs. There are 28-29 vomerine teeth, more than twice as many as in specimens from Finca Volcán (Stuart, 1943:17), but noticeably fewer than in the specimen from Chinajá.  The presence of this species at Chinajá lends support to the idea that the specimen from the Río de la Pasión listed by Brocchi (1882:116) also is _Bolitoglossa dofleini_. Furthermore, the confirmed presence of this species in the lowlands of El Petén suggests that there may be genetic connection between _B. dofleini_ in the Alta Verapaz and _B. yucatana_ in the Yucatán Peninsula. _Bolitoglossa yucatana_ differs from _B. dofleini_ in having five intercostal spaces between adpressed toes and in having a different color pattern. Both are robust species having no close relationships to other species of _Bolitoglossa_ in northern Central America.  The specimen from Chinajá was found in water in the axil of a large elephant-ear plant (_Xanthosoma_) by day in March. Its stomach contained fragments of beetles and a large roach. The natives did not know salamanders and had no name for them.   =Bolitoglossa moreleti mulleri= (Brocchi)        Chinajá, 2; Río San Román, 1.  One specimen is a female having a snout-vent length of 80 mm., a tail length of 82 mm., and a total length of 162 mm. It contains 63 large eggs, the largest of which has a diameter of about three millimeters. This specimen has 13 costal grooves, four intercostal spaces between adpressed toes, and 12-13 vomerine teeth. A juvenile having a snout-vent length of 39 mm. and a tail length of 33 mm. has 12 costal grooves, three intercostal spaces between adpressed toes, and 8-8 vomerine teeth. In life these salamanders were uniformly dull brownish black above with a dull creamy yellow irregular dorsal stripe beginning on the occiput and continuing onto the tail. There are no yellow or orange streaks or flecks on the head or limbs. The specimen from the Río San Román was taken from the stomach of a _Pliocercus euryzonus aequalis_ and has not been studied in detail, because of its poor condition.  The present specimens show no tendency for the development of a broad irregular dorsal band that encloses black spots or forms irregular dorsolateral stripes, as is characteristic of _B. moreleti mexicanus_, a subspecies that has been reported from La Libertad (Stuart, 1935:35) and Piedras Negras (Taylor and Smith, 1945:545) in El Petén, and from Xunantunich, British Honduras (Neill and Allen, 1959:20).  Schmidt (1936:151) and Stuart (1943:13) found _B. moreleti mulleri_ in bromeliads at Finca Samac, Alta Verapaz. Taylor and Smith's (1945:545) and Neill and Allen's (1959:20) specimens of _B. moreleti mexicanus_ were obtained from bromeliads, but Neill and Allen (_loc. cit._) stated that the natives in British Honduras said that they had found salamanders beneath rubbish on the forest floor. My specimens were obtained from beneath logs on the forest floor in the rainy season. Possibly in drier environments the species characteristically inhabits bromeliads, at least in the dry season.   =Bufo marinus= (Linnaeus)        Chinajá, 3; 10 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1; 11 km. NNW of Chinajá,       1.  During both visits to Chinajá this large toad was breeding in a small permanent pond in the camp. During the day the toads took refuge in crevices beneath the buildings or beneath large boulders by the pond. At dusk from four to ten males congregated at the pond and called. Tadpoles of this species were in the pond in March and in July. One juvenile was found beneath a rock in the forest, and another was on the forest floor by day.  The natives' name for this species and the following one is _sapo_.   =Bufo valliceps valliceps= Wiegmann        Chinajá, 52; Río San Román, 8; Sayaxché, 2; Toocog, 1.  This is one of the most abundant, or at least conspicuous, amphibians inhabiting the forest. Breeding congregations were found on February 24, March 2, March 11, and June 27. At these times the toads were congregated at temporary ponds in the forest or along small sluggish streams. Throughout the duration of both visits to Chinajá individual males called almost nightly at the permanent pond at the camp.  The variation in snout-vent length of 20 males selected at random is 56.7 to 72.5 mm. (average, 64.8 mm.). Two adult females have snout-vent lengths of 80.4 and 87.6 mm. In all specimens the parotid glands are somewhat elongated and not rounded as in _Bufo valliceps wilsoni_ (see Baylor and Stuart, 1961:199). My observations on the condition of the cranial crests of the toads in El Petén agree with the findings of Baylor and Stuart (_op. cit._:198) in that hypertrophied crests are usual in large females. In the shape of the parotids and nature of the cranial crests the specimens from El Petén are"]]]
