It was their duty to take as few chances as possible. But they never let the risk stop them when there wasn't any safer way. When you are pulling through Celilo Canal a few days from now, and being eased down a hundred feet in the locks, just remember that Lewis and Clark put their whole outfit down the Tumwater and Five-Mile Rapids of the Dalles, in either of which that skiff of yours would be sucked under in half a minute.\"  Bulking insignificantly as an achievement as does my trip in comparison with the many Columbia voyages, recorded and unrecorded, of early days, it still seems to me that the opportunity I had for a comprehensive survey of this grandest scenically of all the world's great rivers gives me warrant for attempting to set down something of what I saw and experienced during those stirring weeks that intervened between that breathless moment when I let the whole stream of the Columbia trickle down my back in a glacial ice-cave in the high Selkirks, and that showery end-of-the-afternoon when I pushed out into tide-water at the foot of the Cascades.  It is scant enough justice that the most gifted of pens can do to Nature in endeavouring to picture in words the grandest of her manifestations, and my own quill, albeit it glides not untrippingly in writing of lighter things, is never so inclined to halt and sputter as when I try to drive it to its task of registering in black scrawls on white paper something of what the sight of a soaring mountain peak, the depth of a black gorge with a white stream roaring at the bottom, or the morning mists rising from a silently flowing river have registered on the sensitized sheets of my memory. Superlative in grandeur to the last degree as are the mountains, glaciers, gorges, waterfalls, cascades and cliffs of the Columbia, it is to my photographs rather than my pen that I trust to convey something of their real message.  If I can, however, pass on to my readers some suggestion of the keenness of my own enjoyment of what I experienced on the Columbia--of the sheer _joie de vivre_ that is the lot of the man who rides the running road; it will have not been in vain that I have cramped my fingers and bent my back above a desk during several weeks of the best part of the California year. Robert Service has written something about      \"Doing things just for the doing,         Letting babblers tell the story....\"  Shall I need to confess to my readers that the one cloud on the seaward horizon during all of my voyage down the Columbia was brooding there as a consequence of the presentiment that, sooner or later, I should have to do my own babbling?

As the trip to the glaciers was largely a matter of engaging a good packer well in advance, while there was no certainty of getting any one who would undertake the passage of the Big Bend, it was to the latter that we first directed our attention. Chester wired the Publicity Department of the Canadian Pacific and I wrote friends in various parts of British Columbia. The C. P. R. replied that they had requested their Sub-Divisional Superintendent at Revelstoke to institute inquiries for boatmen in our behalf. The only one of my friends who contributed anything tangible stated that \"while the Columbia above Golden and below Revelstoke was admirably suited to pleasure boating, any attempt to run the Big Bend between those points would result in almost certain disaster.\"  As this appeared to be about the extent of what we were likely to learn from a distance, I decided to start north at once to see what could be arranged on the ground. Victoria yielded little save some large scale maps, and even these, they assured me in the Geographic Department of the B. C. Government where I secured them, were very inaccurate as to detail. The Big Bend region, it appeared, had never been surveyed north of the comparatively narrow zone of the C. P. R. grant. Several old hunting friends whom I met at the Club, although they had ranged the wildernesses of the Northwest from the Barren Lands to Alaska, spoke of the Big Bend as a veritable _terra incognita_.  \"It's said to be a great country for grizzly,\" one of them volunteered, \"but too hard to get at. Only way to get in and out is the Columbia, and that is more likely to land you in Kingdom Come than back in Civilization. Best forget about the Big Bend and go after sheep and goat and moose in the Kootenays.\"  At Kamloops I was told of an Indian who had gone round the Big Bend the previous May, before the Spring rise, and come out not only with his own skin, but with those of seven grizzlies. I was unable to locate the Indian, but did find a white man who had made the trip with him. This chap spent half an hour apparently endeavouring to persuade me to give up the trip on account of the prohibitive risk (my experience on other rivers, he declared, would be worse than useless in such water as was to be encountered at Surprise, Kinbasket and Death Rapids) and about an equal amount of time trying to convince me that my life would be perfectly safe if only I would engage him and his Indian and confide it to their care. As the consideration suggested in return for this immunity figured out at between two and three times the rate we had been expecting to pay for boatmen, I had to decline to take advantage of it.  Finally, in Revelstoke, through the efforts of T. C. McNab of the Canadian Pacific, who had been at considerable trouble to line up possible candidates for a Big Bend trip, I met Bob Blackmore. After that things began moving toward a definite end.  \"You won't find old Bob Blackmore an active church-worker,\" I was told in Revelstoke, \"and at one time he had the reputation of being the smoothest thing in the way of a boot-legger in this part of B. C. But he drinks little himself, is a past-master of woodcraft, a dead shot, and has twice the experience of swift-water boating of any man on the upper Columbia. In spite of the fact that he has undergone no end of hardship in his thirty years of packing, hunting, prospecting, trapping and boating all over the West, he's as hard to-day at fifty odd as most men are at thirty. Because he dished a boatload of freight last year somewhere up river, there are a few who are saying that old Bob Blackmore is losing his grip. Don't believe it. He was never better in his life than he is right now, and if you can persuade him to run your show round the Big Bend you're in luck. Once you start, you'll come right on round to Revelstoke all right. No fear on that score. But if you have old Bob Blackmore you'll stand a jolly lot better chance of arriving on top of the water.\"  I found Bob Blackmore at his river-side home in the old town--what had been the metropolitan centre of Revelstoke in the days when it was the head of navigation of steamers from below the Arrow Lakes, and before the railway had come to drag settlement a mile northeastward and away from the Columbia. He was picking apples with one hand and slapping mosquitoes with the other--a grey-haired, grey-eyed man of middle height, with a muscular torso, a steady stare, and a grip that I had to meet half way to save my fingers. He might have passed for a well-to-do Middle Western farmer except for his iron-grey moustaches, which were long and drooping, like those affected by cowboy-town sheriffs in the movies.  I knew at once that this was the man I wanted, and my only doubt was as to whether or not he felt the same way about me. They had told me in town that Blackmore, having some means and being more or less independent, never went out with a man or an outfit he did not like. I felt that it was I who was on approval, not he. I need not have worried, however. In this instance, at least, Bob Blackmore's mind was made up in advance. It was the movies that had done it.  \"The C. P. R. people wrote me that you might be wanting me for the Bend,\" he said genially after I had introduced myself, \"and on the chance that we would be hitching up I have put my big boat in the water to give her a good soaking. I've figured that she's the only boat on the upper river that will do for what you want. I reckon I know them all. She'll carry three or four times as much as the biggest Peterboro. Besides, if you tried to go round in canoes, you'd be portaging or lining in a dozen places where I would drive this one straight through. With any luck, and if the water doesn't go down too fast, I'd figure on going the whole way without taking her out of the river at more'n one place, and maybe not there.\"  \"So you're willing to go ahead and see us through,\" I exclaimed delightedly. \"They told me in the town that you'd probably need a lot of persuading, especially as you've been saying for the last two or three years that you were through with the Bend for good and all.\"  Blackmore grinned broadly and somewhat sheepishly. \"So I have,\" he said. \"Fact is, I've never yet been round the Bend that I didn't tell myself and everybody else that I'd never try it again. I really meant it the last time, which was three or four years ago. And I've really meant it every time I said it right up to a few days back, when I heard that you wanted to take a movie machine in there and try and get some pictures. If that was so, I said to myself, it was sure up to me to do what I could to help, for there's scenery in there that is more worth picturing than any I've come across in thirty years of knocking around all over the mountain country of the West. So I'm your man if you want me. Of course you know something of what you're going up against in bucking the Bend?\"  \"Yes,\" I replied a bit wearily. \"I've been hearing very little else for the last week. Let's talk about the scenery.\"  \"So they've been trying to frighten you out of it,\" he said with a sympathetic smile. \"They always do that with strangers who come here to tackle the Bend. And mostly they succeed. There was one chap they couldn't stop, though. He was a professor of some kind from Philadelphia. Fact is, he wasn't enough frightened. That's a bad thing with the Columbia, which isn't to be taken liberties with. I buried him near the head of Kinbasket Lake. We'll see his grave when we come down from Surprise Rapids. I'll want to stop off for a bit and see if the cross I put up is still standing. He was....\"  \"_Et tu Brute_,\" I muttered under my breath. Then, aloud: \"Let's look at the boat.\"  Already this penchant of the natives for turning the pages of the Big Bend's gruesome record of death and disaster was getting onto my nerves, and it was rather a shock to find even the quiet-spoken, steady-eyed Blackmore addicted to the habit. Afterwards, when I got used to it, I ceased to mind. As a matter of fact, the good souls could no more help expatiating on what the Big Bend had done to people who had taken liberties with it than an aviator who is about to take you for a flight can help leading you round back of the hangar and showing you the wreckage of his latest crash. It seems to be one of the inevitable promptings of the human animal to warn his brother animal of troubles ahead. This is doubtless the outgrowth of the bogies and the \"don'ts\" which are calculated to check the child's explorative and investigative instincts in his nursery days. From the source to the mouth of the Columbia it was never (according to the solicitous volunteer advisers along the way) the really dangerous rapids that I had put behind me. These were"]]]
