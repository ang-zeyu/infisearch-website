CHAPTER ONE.  CLASSIFICATION: ITS BASIS.  In the feline world you find no such diversity, of form, shape, disposition, coat, size, etc, as you do in the canine.  Dogs differ from each other in both the size and conformation of the skeleton, and in many other important points, almost as much as if they belonged to entirely different species.  Mark, for instance, how unlike the bulldog is to the greyhound, or the Scotch toy-terrier to the English mastiff; yet, from the toy-terrier upwards to the giant Saint Bernard, they are all _dogs_, every one of them.  So is the jackal, so is the fox and the wolf.  The domesticated dog himself, indeed, is the best judge as to whether any given animal belongs to his own species or not.  I have taken dogs to different zoological gardens, and have always found that they were ready enough to hob-nob with either jackal or fox, if the latter were only decently civil; but they will turn away with indifference, or even abhorrence, from a wild goat or sloth.  But among the various breeds of cats there exists no such characteristic differences, so that in proposing a classification one almost hesitates to use the word \"breed\" at all, and feels inclined to search about for another and better term.  If I were not under a vow not to let my imagination run riot in these papers, but to glide gently over the surface of things, rather than be erudite, philosophical, theoretical, or speculative, I should feel sorely tempted to pause here for a moment, and ask myself the question--Why are there so many distinct breeds of the domesticated dog, and, properly speaking, only one of the more humble cat?  Did the former all spring from the same original stock, or are certain breeds, such as the staghound, etc, more directly descended from the wolf, the collie, Pomeranian, etc, from the fox after his kind, and other breeds from animals now entirely extinct in the wild state? And once upon a time, as the fairy books say, did flocks of wolves, foxes, wild mastiffs, and all dogs run at large in these islands, clubbing together in warlike and predatory bands, each after his kind, much in the same way that the Scottish Highlanders used to do two or three hundred years ago?  Animals of the dog kind are a step or two more advanced in civilisation, if I may be allowed to use the term, than cats; and hence, as intelligence can appreciate intelligence, and always seeks to rise to a higher level, more breeds, or a larger number of species, of the former than of the latter have forsaken their wild or natural condition to attach themselves to man.  May not the time come, in the distant future, when a larger variety of feline animals shall become fashionable--when domesticated tigers, tame lions, or pet ocelots shall be the rage?  If so, that will indeed be the millennium for cats. Just fancy how becoming it would be to meet the lovely and accomplished Miss De Dear out walking, and leading a beautiful leopard by a slight silver chain, or Lady Bluesock in her phaeton, with a tame ocelot beside John on the dickey!  A lady beside a lion on the lawn would, I think, make a prettier picture than one by the side of a peacock, and a tame Bengalese tiger would be a pet worthy to crouch at the foot of a throne. To be sure, little bits of mistakes would occur at times; instead of the pussy of the period bolting away with the canary, nothing less would satisfy the pet than a nice fat baby, and then those extraordinary people the cat--exterminators would be louder in their denunciations than ever.  If we dissect the cat, we will find that the skeleton of one breed of pussy would pretty nearly pass for that of another; we find the same shape and almost the same size of bones, the same arrangement of teeth as regards their levelness, the same number of teeth, and the same formation of jawbone.  Clothe that skeleton with muscle, and still you can hardly tell the breed of the cat, for scarcely will you be able to find a muscle in the one breed that has not its fellow in all, a little difference perhaps in the size and development of one or two, but even this more the result of accident and use than a distinction real and natural.  I feel as I write that I am sailing as close to a wind as possible; I am luffing all my ship will steer; were I to keep her away a single point, I should drift down into the pleasant gulf-stream of comparative anatomy, and thence away and away to the broad enchanted ocean of speculative theory.  And I confess, too, I wouldn't mind a cruise or two in those latitudes, did space and time admit of it.  Now, I do not mean to say that there is really no difference in shape and form between the different breeds of the domestic cat, but rather that this difference is so minute, compared to that which exists between dogs, that the term \"breeds\" seems almost a misnomer as applied to cats. It is only when you see pussy arrayed in all the wealth and beauty of her lovely fur, that you can see any real distinction between her and another.  In regard to the origin of the domestic cat, naturalists have squabbled and fought for centuries, and the best thing possible, I think, is for every man steadfastly to retain his own opinion, then everybody is sure to be right.  For myself, I really cannot see that it would either assist us in breeding better cats, or render us a bit more humane in our treatment of the pretty animal, to be assured that she was first imported into this country from Egypt or Persia in the year one thousand and ever so much before Christ, or that the father of all the cats was a Scottish wild cat, captured and tamed by some old Highland witch-wife a thousand years before the birth of Noah's grandfather.  What matters it to us whether the pussy that purrs on our footstool is a polecat bred bigger, or a Polar bear bred less?  There she is,--    The rank is but the guinea stamp,   And a cat's a cat for a' that.  But, and if, you are fond of pedigree, why then surely it ought to satisfy you to know that, ages before your ancestors or mine could distinguish between a B and a bull, pussy was the pet of Persian princes, the idol of many a harem, and the playmate of many a juvenile Pharaoh.  What classification, then, are we to make of cats?  We search around us in vain for something to guide us; then, fairly on our beam-ends, are fain to clutch at the only solution to the question, and fall back upon coat and colour, with some few distinctive points of difference in the size and shape of the skull and body.  Colour or markings, then, and quality of coat, are the guiding distinctions between one breed of cat and another; and to these we add, as auxiliaries, size and shape.  _Colour_.--Whether we understand it or not, there, undoubtedly, is nothing in this world left to chance alone, and nothing, I sincerely believe, is done by Nature without a purpose.  The same merciful Providence that clothes the lambs with wool, the reason for which we can understand, paints the rose's petal, the pigeon's breast, or even the robin's egg, for reasons which to us are inscrutable, or only to be vaguely guessed at.  We can tell the \"why\" and the \"wherefore\" of the rainbow's evanescent hues, but who shall investigate the laws that determine the fixed colours of the animal and vegetable creation?  Who shall tell us why the grass is green, the rose is red, that bullfinch on the pear-tree so glorious in his gaudiness, and that sparrow so humble in his coat of brown?  If we ask the Christian philosopher, he will tell us that the colours in animated nature are traced by the finger of God, who always paints the coat or skin of an animal with that tint or hue, which shall tend most to the propagation and preservation of its species.  That He clothes the hare and rabbit in a suit of humble brown, that they may be less easily seen by the eye of the sportsman, or their natural enemies, the polecat, weasel, white owl, or golden-headed eagle.  That birds--who flit about all summer in coats so gay and jackets so gaudy, that even a hawk may mistake them for bouquets of flowers, and think them not worth eating-- as soon as the breeding season is over, and the leaves and flowers fade and fall, are presented by nature with warmer but more homely suits of apparel, more akin in colour to the leafless hedgerows, or the brown of the rustling beech leaves, among which they seek shelter from the wintry blast.  If you go farther you may fare worse.  No one in the world can be a greater admirer than I of the genius of Tyndall, Darwin, or Huxley, but I must confess they get a little, just a _leetle_, \"mixed\" at times; and I doubt if Darwin himself, or any other sublunarian whatever, understands his (Darwin's) theory of colour.  He says, for instance--I can't use the exact words, but can give his meaning in my own--that the wild rabbit or the hare was not painted by the finger of nature the colour we find them with any pre-defined idea of protecting the animal against its enemies; but that in the struggle for life that has been going on for aeons, considering the conditions of its surroundings, it was only the grey rabbit that had the power of continuing in existence, escaping its enemies by aid of its dusky coat.  Darwin thinks, indeed, that religionists put the cart before the horse, to use a homely phrase. I confess that I myself prefer the good old theory of design--of a God of design, and a prescient Providence.  I believe the testimony of the rocks, I believe to a great extent in evolution--it is a grand theory, and one which gives the Creator an immensity of glory--but I cannot let any one rob me of the belief"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],["title","The Domestic Cat (#1)"],["body","beauty and colour are not all chance.  Yonder is a hornet, just alighted at the foot of the old oak-tree where I am writing, so uncomfortably near my nose, indeed, that I can't help wishing he had kept to his nest for another month; but the same April sunshine that lured me out of doors lured the hornet, and there it stands, all a-quiver with delight, on a budding acorn, looking every moment as if it would part amidships.  \"Do you think, Mrs Hornet, O thou tigress of bees, if your lovely body, with its bars of gold, had been of any other colour, that, under the peculiar conditions in which your ancestors lived, you would, ages ago, have ceased to exist; that ants, or other `crawling ferlies,' who detest the colour of turmeric, would, in spite of your ugly sting, have devoured you and yours?\"  Yonder, again, is a beautiful chaffinch; he was very glad to come to my lawn-window every day, during all the weary winter, to beg a crumb of bread.  He forgets that now, or thinks perhaps that I do not know him in his spring suit of clothes, and golden-braided coat and vest.  But I do, and I still believe--simple though the belief may be--that the same Being, who gave life and motion to that little beetle which is now making its way to the highest pinnacle of my note-book, as proud as a boy with a new kite, to try its wings for the first time, tipped that ungrateful finch's feathers with crimson, white, and gold, in order to make him more attractive to his little dowdy thing of a wife, who has been so busy all the morning building her nest on the silver birch, and trying to find lichens to match the colour of the tree.  For Mrs Finch is a nervous, timid little body, and had no thoughts of marrying at all, and indeed would have preferred to remain single, and would have so remained, had she not been a female; but being a female, how could she resist that splendid uniform?  I go into the garden and bend me over the crocus beds--white crocuses, orange crocuses, and blue, all smiling in the sunshine of spring.  Each is a little family in itself, and they would like to know each other too so very much, for they have ever so many love tales to breathe into each other's ears.  But they are all fast by one end and cannot move. Whatever shall they do, and what will become of the next generation of crocuses?  I can hear them whispering their tales of love to the passing wind, and so can you if you are a lover of Nature; but the wind is too busy, or too light, or too something or another, and cannot pause to listen.  So the little things are all in despair, when past comes a bee. Now bees, and butterflies too, for all they have got so many eyes, are rather short-sighted, but even a bee cannot help seeing that gorgeous display of orange, white, and blue, so he pops at once into the bosom of a blue crocus, and is made as welcome as the flowers in May.  \"Oh! you dear old bee,\" says the crocus, \"you're just come in time; have something to eat first.  I have a nice little store of honey for you; and then you shall bear a message to my lady-love--the pretty blue belle crocus mind, not the white.  I wouldn't have a race of variegated children for the world.\"  \"All right,\" says the bee, and away he flies with the message of love to the blue belle crocus, and thus the loves of the crocuses are cemented. They tell the old, old story by proxy, because they can't do it as you or I do, reader, eye to eye and lip to lip.  For colour has its uses, and nothing that exists was made in vain, although some are selfish enough to believe that all the colour and beauty they see around them, during a ramble in the country, was made but to please the eye of man.  Colour I believe to be connected in some way with the mystery of heat and life.  We all know that certain colours will dispel or retain heat; black is more warm, for instance, than white.  There may be, then, a _scale_ of colours as it were, each colour differing in the amount of heat-retaining power; and, it may be that, having reference to this scale, the colours on an animal's coat, are apportioned to it in the way which shall best conduce to its health, comfort, and happiness.  The colour of any animal is an important consideration in determining its breed, and this is especially the case among cats, where indeed it forms the basis of our classification.  Colour is often the key to the character of the cat--to its temper, whether savage or good-natured; to its qualities as a good hunter or the reverse; and to its power of endurance, its eyesight, and its hearing.  _Size_.--Cats of different breeds--I use the word for want of a better-- are generally of different sizes, and the skeleton is, as a rule, larger in some breeds than in others.  The male ought to be larger than the female.  _Form_.--The difference in form is principally observable in the shape and rotundity of skull, the length and shape of the nasal bones and jaw, and the length of the tail and its form at the point.  The ears also vary a good deal in length in the different breeds, and also in breadth, and in \"sit\" or position.  _Pelage, or Coat_.--The coat is of two different kinds, the long and the short.  In the former, the longer and softer and silkier the better, and in the latter the length of the hairs, their closeness and glossiness, are to be taken into consideration.  You can generally tell by one glance at the animal's coat how she is fed, how she is treated and housed, and the condition of her health.  Having got so far, we will next bring pussy herself on the stage, and see how far these remarks apply to her, according to her breed and species.  CHAPTER TWO.  BREEDS AND CLASSES.  In future chapters I will give the habits and characteristics of the domestic cat in general, with some specialities of a few of the different kinds in particular.  The \"tricks and manners\" of one cat, however, will be found to correspond pretty closely with those of any other.  But before going farther on with this chapter, I wish to make a plea in pussy's favour.  I myself have studied cat life, off and on, for twenty years, so I suppose it will be admitted I am no mean authority on the subject.  During that time I have come to certain conclusions, which in some cases run contrary to the opinions generally conceived of those animals--contrary, at any rate, to the belief current some years ago, before pussy was thought worthy to hold a show of her own.  Towards this ocean of contrary opinions I have been wafted, not by the wind of my own sails alone, but aided and supported by many hundreds of anecdotes of domestic pussy's daily life, habits, likes and dislikes.  These anecdotes have been supplied to me from trustworthy people, in every position of life--from the poverty-stricken old maid with her one feline favourite; from the honest working-man with his fireside pet and children's playmate; from farmers, solicitors, doctors, and parsons; from baronets' ladies; and, in more than one instance, from the daughters of peers of the realm, allied to royalty itself.  These anecdotes have, in almost every case, been substantially authenticated, and _always_ discarded wherever, in any case, they were open to doubt.  From these anecdotes and essays, and from my own experience as well, I have arrived at the following conclusions--and be it remembered I speak of cats that are properly fed and housed, and have been taught habits of cleanliness when kittens:--  1.  That cats are extremely sagacious.  2 That cats are cleanly and regular in their habits.  3.  That cats are fond of children.  4.  That cats are excellent mothers, and will nurse the young of any small animal on the loss of their own.  5.  That cats are fond of roaming abroad.  6.  That cats are brave to a fault.  7.  That cats are fond of other animals as playmates.  8.  That cats are easily taught tricks.  9.  That cats are excellent hunters.  10.  That cats are good fishers, and can swim on occasion.  11.  That cats are very tenacious of life.  12.  That cats are fond of home.  13.  That cats are _fonder far of master or mistress_.  14.  That cats are _not_, as a rule, _thieves, but the reverse_.  15.  That long-headed, sharp-nosed cats are the best mousers.  These are not texts, but deductions.  All that is known for certain of the origin of the domestic cat may be expressed in three letters, _n i l_--nil.  And, after all, I cannot see that it matters very much, for if the theory of Darwin be correct, that everything living sprang originally from the primordial cell, then cats or dogs, or human beings, we all had the same origin.  But, again, according to Darwin, the cat is an older animal than man in the world's history; and if this be so, how silly of us to bother our heads in trying to find out who first domesticated the cat, when in all probability _it was the cat who first domesticated man_.  But, avaunt! all learned discourse on the subject; perish all discursive lore.  I have studied the matter over and over again, and read about it in languages dead and living, till my head ached, and my heart was sick; and still, for the life of me, I cannot make out that there are any more than two distinct _species_ of domestic cats in existence.  There are, first, the European or Western cat, a short-haired animal; and secondly, the Asiatic or Eastern cat--called also Persian or Angora, according to the difference in the texture of the coat, it being exceedingly fine, soft, and satiny in the Angora, and not so much so in the Persian--a long-haired cat.  All the others, such as Assyrian, Abyssinian, the Maltese, Russian, Chinese, Italian, French, Turkish, etc, are either inter-breeds between the two, or lineal descendants of the one or the other, altered and modified by climate and mode of life.  Taking everything into consideration, I am inclined to favour the belief held by some, that our own fireside cat was first domesticated from our mountain wild cat.  I mentioned, this to a"]]]
