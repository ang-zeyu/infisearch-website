Small birds, remarkable for their activity, not highly gifted with musical power, constantly flitting and climbing about trees and bushes, which they examine for small insects, suspending themselves in all attitudes, feeding also on grains and fruits, and not sparing small birds when they are able to overpower them.    13. ACRÉDULA (Long-tailed Tit). Bill much compressed, both mandibles     curved, upper considerably longer than lower. Eyelids with wide bare     margins. Length of wing quills increases to fourth and fifth, which     are longest. Tail very long, narrow, graduated, outer feathers     one-third length of middle pair. Tarsus long, feet moderate.  _Page 35_    14. PARUS (Great, Blue, Cole, Marsh, and Crested Tits). Bill slightly     compressed, upper mandible hardly longer than lower.

Whole     body closely covered with down.                               _Page 51_     FAMILY ORIOLIDÆ  Bill with notch in upper mandible; nostrils placed well in front of base of bill and quite bare.    20. ORIÓLUS (Oriole). Bill an elongated cone, depressed at the base;     upper mandible keeled above, notched near the point, bending over     the lower one; nostrils basal, lateral, naked, pierced horizontally     in a large membrane; tarsus not longer than the middle toe; wings     moderate; first primary very short, second shorter than the third,     which is the longest.                                         _Page 53_     FAMILY STURNIDÆ    (STARLINGS)  Bill nearly straight, short at the base, diminishing regularly to a sharp point, which is not distinctly notched; the ridge of the upper mandible; ascends upon the forehead, dividing the plumage of that part; nostrils placed low in the bill; planta tarsi entire; wings moderate, not reaching to end of tail. An extensive and widely diffused family, comprising species for the most part above the average size of Passerine birds, yet inferior to the Crows. They are in general social, feeding much on the ground; their legs and feet are robust, their gait stately, their plumage, though commonly of dark colours, is lustrous, with reflections of steel-blue, purple, or green.    21. STURNUS (Starling). Bill straight, forming an elongated cone,     depressed broad at the base, bluntish; upper mandible broader than     the lower; nostrils at the base of the bill, partly closed by an     arched membrane; first primary very short, second longest.    _Page 54_    22. PASTOR (Rose-coloured Starling). Bill slightly arched, forming an     elongated cone, compressed; nostrils at the base of the bill partly     covered by a feathery membrane; wings with the first primary very     short, second and third longest.                              _Page 56_     FAMILY CORVIDÆ    (CROWS)  Bill powerful, more or less compressed at the sides; upper mandible more or less arched to the point without distinct notch; gape nearly straight; nostrils concealed by stiff bristles. Hallux very strong, but with its claw not as long as the middle toe and claw. Birds of firm and compact structure; their wings long, pointed, and powerful; their feet and claws robust. In disposition bold and daring, extremely sagacious, easily tamed and made familiar. Most of them have the power of imitating various sounds, but their natural voices are harsh. They evince a remarkable propensity for thieving and hiding brilliant and gaudy substances. In appetite they are omnivorous.    23. PYRRHÓCORAX (Chough). Bill longer than the head, rather slender,     arched from the base, and pointed; nostrils oval; feet strong,     tarsus longer than the middle toe; wings rounded, first primary     short, fourth and fifth the longest; tail even at the end.   _Page 56_    24.

Bill not longer than the head,     strong, straight at the base, cutting at the edges, and curved     towards the point; nostrils oval; feet strong, tarsus longer than     the middle toe; wings pointed, first primary moderate, second and     third shorter than the fourth, which is the longest; tail moderate,     rounded.                                                      _Page 61_     FAMILY LANIIDÆ    (SHRIKES)  Bill strong, arched, and hooked, the upper mandible strongly notched after the manner of the FALCONIDÆ; claws adapted for capturing insects and even small birds. Sylvan. Young barred below.    28. LÁNIUS (Shrike, or Butcher Bird). Bill short, flattened vertically     (compressed) at the sides; gape furnished with bristly feathers     directed forwards; wings with the first three primaries graduated,     the third and fourth being the longest.                       _Page 73_     FAMILY AMPELIDÆ    (CHATTERERS)  Bill stoat, approaching, especially in the form of the lower mandible, to that of the Corvidæ; the upper mandible is however somewhat broad at the base, flat, with the upper edge more or less angular and ridged, and the tip distinctly notched. Feet usually stout, with the outer toe united to the middle one as far as, or beyond, the first joint. They feed principally on berries and other soft fruits, occasionally also on insects.    29. ÁMPELIS (Waxwing). Bill as above; nostrils oval, concealed by     small feathers directed forwards; "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38077"],["title","British Birds in Their Haunts (#2)"],["body","long and pointed; first and     second primaries longest, some of the secondaries and tertials     terminating in wax-like prolongations of their shafts.        _Page 76_     FAMILY MUSCICAPIDÆ    (FLYCATCHERS)  Bill broad, flattened horizontally (depressed), slightly toothed and adapted for catching small flying insects; nostrils more or less covered by bristly hairs; feet generally feeble.    30. MUSCÍCAPA (Flycatcher). Bill moderate, somewhat triangular,     depressed at the base, compressed towards the tip, which is slightly     curved downwards; gape armed with stiff bristles; tarsus equal to or     longer than the middle toe; side toes of equal length; wings with     the first primary very short, and the third and fourth longest.                                                                   _Page 77_     FAMILY HIRUNDINIDÆ    (SWALLOWS AND MARTINS)  Beak short but broad, and more or less flattened horizontally; mouth very deeply cleft; feet small and weak; wings with nine visible primaries, long and powerful, and thus adapted for sustaining a protracted flight in pursuit of winged insects, which form the sole sustenance of these birds; tail long and usually forked; plumage close, smooth, often burnished with a metallic gloss. Migratory birds, spending the summer in temperate climates, but being impatient of cold, withdrawing in winter to equatorial regions.    31. HIRUNDO (Swallow). Bill short, depressed, very wide at base,     commissure straight. Nostrils basal, oval, partly closed by     membrane. Tail deeply forked, of twelve feathers, the outermost     greatly elongated and abruptly attenuated.

Tail forked, of twelve feathers,     outermost not abruptly attenuated. Legs and feet slender, closely     feathered above; toes rather long, three in front, one behind; claws     moderate, sharp.                                              _Page 83_    33. CÓTILE (Sand-martin). Bill short, depressed, very wide at base,     commissure straight. Nostrils, wings and tail as in Chelidon. Legs     and feet slender, and bare except for tuft of feathers on tarsus     just above hallux; toes moderate, three in front, one behind; claws     strong.                                                       _Page 84_     FAMILY FRINGILLIDÆ    (FINCHES)  Remarkable for the shortness, thickness, and powerful structure of the bill; the upper and lower mandibles are usually equally thick, and their height and breadth are nearly alike, so that the bill when closed presents the appearance of a short cone, divided in the middle by the gape. By its aid they break open the hard woody capsules and fruit-stones containing the seeds and kernels which form their chief food. At nesting-time many species live on insect larvæ, with which the young are almost exclusively fed. The wings have nine visible primaries. This family is one of immense extent, consisting of relatively small birds.    34. LIGURINUS (Greenfinch). Bill compressed towards tip, with scarcely     perceptible notch at point; nostrils basal, concealed by stiff     feathers directed forwards; wings rather pointed, first quill     obsolete, second, third and fourth nearly equal and longest.

Nostrils basal, lateral, oval, nearly hidden by projecting     and recurved frontal plumes. Wings with first quill obsolete, third     and fourth primaries nearly equal, sixth, seventh, and eighth curved     outwards. Tail short, and nearly square. Tarsus scutellate in front,     covered at sides with single plate, stout and short; claws     moderately curved, rather short and strong.                   _Page 87_    36. CARDUÊLIS (Goldfinch and Siskin). Bill a rather elongated cone,     compressed at the tip, and finely pointed; wings long, pointed;     first three primaries nearly equal and the longest; tail slightly     forked.                                                       _Page 88_    37. PASSER (Sparrows). Bill somewhat arched above; lower mandible     rather smaller than the upper; first three primaries longest.                                                                   _Page 92_    38. FRINGILLA (Chaffinch and Brambling). Bill straight, sharp,     pointed; mandibles nearly equal; first primary a little shorter than     the second, much shorter than the third and fourth, which are nearly     equal and the longest.                                        _Page 95_    39.

PÝRRHULA (Bullfinch). Bill short and thick, the sides tumid; upper     mandible much arched and bending over the lower one; first primary     nearly equal to the fifth, second a little shorter than the third     and fourth, which are the longest.                           _Page 101_    41. LOXIA (Crossbill). Bill thick at the base; both mandibles equally     curved, hooked at the tips, and crossing each other at the points.                                                                  _Page 103_    42.

Wings long and pointed, first     primary obsolete, second and third nearly equal and longest in wing,     fourth considerably longer than fifth. Tail moderate and slightly     forked. Front claws rather long and curved; hind claw considerably     curved and elongated.                                        _Page 110_    44. CALCARIUS (Lapland Bunting). Bill with considerably inflected     cutting edges (tomia); claws of front toes short and slightly     curved; hind claw nearly straight and elongated; other characters     much as in Plectrophenax.                                    _Page 111_     FAMILY MOTACILLIDÆ    (WAGTAILS AND PIPITS)  Wings with nine visible primaries.

Planta tarsi scutellate. Granivorous birds, frequenting open spaces, and singing during their flight; nesting on ground and seeking their food there by running; they are 'pulverators', i. e. they shake dust or sand into their feathers instead of bathing.    47. ALAUDA (Lark). Bill moderate, slightly compressed at edges; upper     mandible more or less arched from middle. Nostrils basal, oval,     covered by bristly feathers directed forward. Gape straight. Wings     long; first primary short but unmistakably developed; second, third     and fourth nearly equal, but third longest. Tail moderate, slightly     forked. Tarsus longer than middle toe; claws slightly curved and     moderate, except that of hind toe, which is generally elongate and     nearly straight.                                             _Page 119_    48. OTÓCORYS (Shore-lark). Bill rather short, subconic; upper mandible     slightly arched. Head--in adult male--with tuft of long, erectile     feathers on either side of occiput. Wings long; first primary so     small as at first sight to seem wanting, second longest but third     nearly its equal, fourth decidedly shorter, outer secondaries short     and emarginate at tip.
