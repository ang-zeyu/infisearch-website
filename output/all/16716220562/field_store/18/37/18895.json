Hardly had he gone past when I again heard the thud of horses' hoofs, and riding apparently in close pursuit came four men, with set faces and loose rein. They, too, disappeared, but I could not summon up courage to resume my way until the last sounds of the pursuers had died away in the dim distance.  Then I came in sight of a town of considerable size, dominated by a lofty square tower. This I guessed rightly to be Christchurch.  On reaching a long stone bridge I halted at one of the recesses to rest awhile, making a meal of the food I had brought, for the walk had made me ravenous.  'Twas a glorious view. Standing out clearly in the moonlight was the long, regular outline of the priory church, the graceful tower of which I had seen a long way down the road. The moonbeams danced on the placid waters of an inland sea, while from farther still, beyond a lofty, flat-topped hill, came the sound of the swell of the English Channel roaring on the sandy shore.  Beneath the bridge flowed the river, swiftly and silently, though oft the stillness was broken by the splash of a lordly salmon. \"The stream and I have both the same purpose,\" thought I. \"Each would gain the sea, though by different means.\"  My reverie was broken by the clatter of horsemen, and fearing to be stopped and questioned, I ran down the approach to the bridge and, vaulting over the low parapet, stood ankle deep in the dewy grass, scarce daring to raise my eyes above the coping.  'Twas the same troop of horsemen I had seen a short while ago, and in their midst, his legs bound beneath his horse's belly, rode the man they had pursued, entreating and reviling his captors almost in the same breath.  Once again I proceeded on my way, keeping close to the side of the main street, where the moon threw deep shadows athwart the cobbles; and once again I was brought to a standstill.  Hobbling down the street was a decrepit old man, muffled in a long cloak. In his left hand he carried a lantern, while his right grasped a halberd--though why thus armed I am at pains to suggest, for so tottering were his footsteps that I could have knocked him down with ease. Neither could he have had good sight, for he passed me, as I stood flattened against a door, within three paces, and, halting in the middle of the road, croaked:  \"One o' the clock, and a fine morning, and all's well.\"  Three hours more and day would be breaking. If I were to be on Poole Quay by sunrise no time must be lost, so directly the way was clear I set off at a steady trot, never stopping till I had gained a second bridge and had reached the foot of a steep hill, from the summit of which I saw I had completely shaken off the dust of Christchurch.  For the next five or six miles 'twas up and down, with occasional glimpses of the sea away on my left; and just as the pale dawn began to glimmer in the east, I saw from the brow of a lofty hill the whole extent of Poole Harbour spread out like a map, the undulating downs that I knew afterwards to be Purbeck Heights being barely visible against the dark grey sky.  Half an hour later I was threading my way down the narrow High Street, guided by the tall masts of the shipping in the harbour.  At length I reached the quay, and stood bewildered by the maze of vessels of all sorts, sizes, and rigs. Although 'twas yet early, there was much bustling about--fishermen returning from their night's work, and men, heavy-eyed as the result of their previous night's carouse, stumbling back to their ships; while already the creaking of tackle and the hoarse shouts of seamen proclaimed that more than one vessel was getting under way.  I had two immediate objects in view. I must avoid Captain Jeremy, for I was very doubtful whether he would take me aboard the Golden Hope. I must also find the ship, and manage to stow myself away till she set sail.  Once more luck was in my favour, for as I made my way along the slippery wharf I espied a large, wall-sided brig, with tall masts, from which the sails hung loosely, awaiting but to be sheeted home. Beneath her small, square stern ports were the words _Golden Hope_.  Even as I looked at her from a safe distance a heavy footstep caused me to turn round, and to my surprise I saw no other than 'Enery.  He recognized me in an instant, and gripping me by the shoulder he exclaimed:  \"Avast there, Master Hammond, what brings you here?\"  \"I've run away from home. Don't betray me, Henry,\" I replied; \"I want to go with Captain Miles, and I'm afraid he'll not take me.\"  \"Say 'Enery an' I'll answer to my name,\" said the seaman reprovingly. \"Why, if so be you wants to go to sea, why shouldn't you? Why shouldn't you, I wants to know?\"  \"Perchance Captain Jeremy will not see eye to eye with me in that matter; though, once we are fairly out at sea----\"  \"'Nough said, young maäster. Sink me if I don't do my best, for you were as true as steel to us when we were shut up in that hole in Brockenhurst Heath. Come on, and look sharp about it.\"  So saying, he led the way to a dirty, disreputable inn situated in a narrow street leading off the quay. Here he spoke a few words to a ferrety, blear-eyed man, handing tankards of spirits to the crowd of seafaring men who thronged there in spite of the time of day.  \"Up aloft,\" said the man, jerking his thumb in the direction of a rough ladder that led to a room above.  [Illustration: I DESCENDED HAND OVER HAND]  Here 'Enery provided me with a pair of heavy sea boots which, when I had slipped my legs into them, reached almost to my thighs. Next I donned a long oilskin coat, cracked all over by the heat of the sun and smelling most vilely; while on my head 'Enery clapped a tarpaulin, the back of which rested betwixt my shoulder-blades.  Stepping back, he examined me critically; then, not satisfied with his handiwork, he crossed over to the hearth, and covering his hand with soot, he smothered my face till I was as dusky as a blackamoor.  \"It's all plain sailing now,\" he remarked approvingly; and sallying out into the street, we regained the quay.  \"'Ere, clap hold o' that,\" exclaimed 'Enery, pointing to a heavy sack, and, hoisting it on to my shoulders, he also seized a similar article, and told me to follow him.  There was a constant stream of men engaged in the same task, some of them seamen belonging to the ship, others longshoremen hired to assist in the loading.  As I crossed the quay I saw Captain Jeremy, looking very smart in a maroon-coloured coat, dark blue breeches, and long boots, while on his head he sported a full-bottomed peruke, surmounted by a three-cornered hat.  Bending low with my burden, I passed him in great dread lest he should penetrate my disguise, but, to my great relief, he went by unsuspectingly, and the next moment I staggered up the narrow, creaking gangway and gained the deck of the _Golden Hope_.  Large as she appeared when viewed from the quay, the size of the brig astonished me. She was about 200 tons burthen, and carried nine seven-pounder pieces abroadside, with two small swivelled guns on her poop.  Betwixt the masts a yawning hatchway and a stout longboat occupied nearly all the space amidships; and down the hatch descended the stream of laden men, jostling against those who, having got rid of their burdens, were returning to the shore for more.  Passing out of the dazzling light, for the sun was now well up in the heavens, the sudden change to the gloom of the hold made it hard for me to distinguish my surroundings until my eyes grew accustomed to the semi-darkness.  The floor of the hold was composed of rough planks, with a narrow hatch to gain access to the ballast. On either side I could discern the stout curved frames, while overhead, save where the hatch gaped to the light of day, huge timbers crossed athwart ship barely five feet from the floor. The whole place smelt strongly of tar; mingled with a dozen different odours, all more or less obnoxious to my nostrils.  Having relieved myself of the sack, I followed 'Enery towards the fore end of the hold, where a low bulkhead, barely three feet in height, separated the cargo and stores from the cable tier. There two neatly coiled ropes, thicker than my leg above the knee, occupied the greater part of the limited space, their ends vanishing through two small apertures in the deck above.  This I saw by the feeble glimmer of a horn lantern.  \"Here's your mess for awhile, till I gives you the word,\" said 'Enery. \"I'll pass you down a pannikin of water and some hard tack as soon as I can. No one will see you here, but take care of yon cable, for if we've got to let go in a hurry you'll find yourself capsized in a brace of shakes.\"  \"Let go what?\" I asked, bewildered by his warning.  \"The anchor, Maäster Hammond. We never know when we've got to let go, 'specially if she misses stays as we beat down the harbour.\"  Fearing to betray my ignorance, I refrained from asking him what missing stays meant; and, promising to look me up as soon as his duties would permit, the old seaman hastened away, and I was left in solitude, though the men were still at work stowing the stores in the after part of the hold.  At length the stream of hold trimmers gradually slackened and died away; the hatches were replaced, and the hold was in darkness, save for the dull yellow glimmer of the lantern that 'Enery had thoughtfully left for my benefit.  It seemed several hours before the old seaman reappeared, bringing the promised biscuit and water.  \"Cap'n's come aboard,\" he announced. \"We're just going to warp out, for the wind's dead in our teeth. 'Twill be a long job, I'll allow, afore we clear the bar. Never mind, Maäster Hammond; keep your heart up, and watch the cable.\"  With this repeated warning he again left me, and soon afterwards I heard the tramp of many feet"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38233"],["title","Birds Every Child Should Know (#0)"],["body","[Transcriber's notes]   This is derived from a copy on the Internet Archive:    http://www.archive.org/details/birdsthateverych00doub    Page numbers in this book are indicated by numbers enclosed in curly   braces, e.g. {99}.

Nature herself is the teacher who rouses him from his bed with an outburst of song under the window and sets his sleepy brain to wondering whether it was a robin's clear, ringing call that startled him from his dreams, or the chipping sparrow's wiry tremulo, or the gushing little wren's tripping cadenza. Interest in the birds trains the ear quite unconsciously. A keen, intelligent listener is rare, even among grown-ups, but a child who is becoming acquainted with the birds about him hears every sound and puzzles out its meaning with a cleverness that amazes those with ears who hear not. He responds to the first alarm note from the nesting blue birds in the orchard and dashes out of the house to chase away a prowling cat. He knows from {vi} afar the distress caws of a company of crows and away he goes to be sure that their persecutor is a hawk. A faint tattoo in the woods sends him climbing up a tall straight tree with the confident expectation of finding a woodpecker's nest within the hole in its side.  While training his ears, Nature is also training every muscle in his body, sending him on long tramps across the fields in pursuit of a new bird to be identified, making him run and jump fences and wade brooks and climb trees with the zest that produces an appetite like a saw-mill's and deep sleep at the close of a happy day.  When President Roosevelt was a boy he was far from strong, and his anxious father and mother naturally encouraged every interest that he showed in out-of-door pleasures. Among these, perhaps the keenest that he had was in birds. He knew the haunts of every species within a wide radius of his home and made a large collection of eggs and skins that he presented to the Smithsonian Museum when he could no longer endure the evidences of his \"youthful indiscretion,\" as he termed the collector's mania. But those bird hunts that had kept him happily employed in the open air all day long, helped to make him the strong, manly man he is, whose wonderful physical endurance is not the least factor of his greatness. No one abhors the killing of birds and the {vii} robbing of nests more than he; few men, not specialists, know so much about bird life.  Nature, the best teacher of us all, trains the child's eyes through study of the birds to quickness and precision, which are the first requisites for all intelligent observation in every field of knowledge. I know boys who can name a flock of ducks when they are mere specks twinkling in their rapid rush across the autumn sky; and girls who instantly recognise a goldfinch by its waving flight above the garden. The white band across the end of the kingbird's tail leads to his identification the minute some sharp young eyes perceive it. At a considerable distance, a little girl I know distinguished a white-eyed from a red-eyed vireo, not by the colour of the iris of either bird's eye, but by the yellowish white bars on the white-eyed vireo's wings which she had noticed at a glance. Another girl named the yellow-billed cuckoo, almost hidden among the shrubbery, by the white thumb-nail spots on the quills of his outspread tail where it protruded for a second from a mass of leaves. A little urchin from the New York City slums was the first to point out to his teacher, who had lived twenty years on a farm, the faint reddish streaks on the breast of a yellow warbler in Central Park. Many there are who have eyes and see not.  What does the study of birds do for the {viii} imagination, that high power possessed by humans alone, that lifts them upward step by step into new realms of discovery and joy? If the thought of a tiny hummingbird, a mere atom in the universe, migrating from New England to Central America will not stimulate a child's imagination, then all the tales of fairies and giants and beautiful princesses and wicked witches will not cause his sluggish fancy to roam. Poetry and music, too, would fail to stir it out of the deadly commonplace.  Interest in bird life exercises the sympathies. The child reflects something of the joy of the oriole whose ecstasy of song from the elm on the lawn tells the whereabouts of a dangling \"cup of felt\" with its deeply hidden treasures. He takes to heart the tragedy of a robin's mud-plastered nest in the apple tree that was washed apart by a storm, and experiences something akin to remorse when he takes a mother bird from the jaws of his pet cat. He listens for the return of the bluebirds to the starch-box home he made for them on top of the grape arbour and is strangely excited and happy that bleak day in March when they re-appear. It is nature sympathy, the growth of the heart, not nature study, the training of the brain, that does most for us.
