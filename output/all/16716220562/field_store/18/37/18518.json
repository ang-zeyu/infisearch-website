Next see to the length and texture of the pelage--its glossiness, and its freedom from cinder-holes, or the reverse.  Then note the colour, and the evenness or unevenness of the markings.  The head most be carefully noted, as to its size and shape, the colour of the eyes and nose, ditto the whiskers; mark, too, the _lay_ of the ear, and its _aural tuft_.  In the tabbies the _Mayor's Chain_ should swirl around the chest.  Lastly, take a glance at the expression of face.  _Merits of the Asiatic Cats_.--I think every cat-fancier will bear me out in saying that, although more delicate in constitution than our European short-hairs, and hardly so keen at mousing, ratting, or so fierce in fighting larger game, there can be no doubt of it they make far nicer pets.  They are extremely affectionate and loving in their dispositions, and so fond of other animals, such as dogs, pet rabbits, guinea-pigs, etc.  Their love for a kind master or mistress only ends with life itself.  Then they are so beautiful and so cleanly, and, if kept in a clean room, take such care of their lovely pelage, that I only wonder there are not more of them bred than there are.  They are a little more expensive at first.  You can seldom pick up a good kitten at a show under one pound sterling--but if you do succeed in getting one or two nice ones, I am quite certain you will never have to repent it, if you only do them ordinary justice.  It will be well to end this chapter here; but before doing so, I beg to make one or two remarks, which I feel sure will interest secretaries of coming cat-shows.  1.  In all shows give the cats nice roomy pens, whether of wood or zinc.  2.  Attend well to the ventilation, and more especially to disinfection.  3.  Attend to the feeding, and, at a more than one-day show, cats ought to have _water_ as well as milk.  I think boiled lights, cut into small pieces, with a very small portion of bullock's liver and bread soaked, is the best food; but I have tried Spratt's Patent Cat Food with a great number of cats, both of my own and those of friends, and have nearly always found it agree; and at a cat-show it would, I believe, be both handy and cleanly.  4.  On no account let the pussies lie on the bare wood or zinc, but provide each with a cushion of some sort, and have a small box filled with earth or sand, in each pen.  _Sawdust in a cat's cage is an abomination_.  It soils the fur, and gets into the food-dish, and renders pussy simply miserable.  CHAPTER EIGHT.  ON DIET, DRINK, AND HOUSING.  \"Throw physic to the dogs,\" said the immortal William.  That was a good many years ago, and dogs then were of very little value, and little used either to physic or good treatment; but nowadays we have found out that the possession of even a cat, entails upon us the duty and responsibility of seeing she is well cared for while in health, and properly treated in sickness.  I recommended small doses of quinine and steel to an unwell pussy the other day.  \"Ma conscience!\" cried her owner; \"gie medicine to a cat!  Wha ever heard o' the like?\"  I'm sorry that woman was Scotch, but glad to say I reasoned even her round, and her cat is now as sleek and lively as the day is long.  Most, if not all the diseases which feline flesh is heir to, are brought on by bad feeding, starvation, or exposure to the weather, especially the cruel custom many people have of leaving their poor cats out all night, to seek for food and shelter for themselves.  These are the cats who make night hideous with their howling, who tear up beautiful flowerbeds, rob pigeon-lofts, murder valuable rabbits, and, in a general way, do all they can to bring into disrepute the whole feline race.  I declare to you honestly, there is as much difference between one of these night-prowlers and a well-cared-for cat, as there is between one of the lean and mangy curs who do scavengers' duty in Cairo, and a champion Scottish Collie.  Some men will tell you that it is unmanly to love or care for a cat; just as if it _could_ be unmanly to love anything that God made and gifted with sagacity, wisdom, and undying love for all the human race! But I can point you out scores of men who are good sportsmen, fearless huntsmen, and fond of every manly sport--ay, and men, too, who are at home on the stormiest ocean, and never pale when fired upon in anger-- who can both pride and prize a favourite cat.  At Exeter, not long since, out of thirty-nine owners of cats, all were men except nine, and of these nine seven were married, and the two others were young ladies, while the owner of the first-prize cat _was a gallant soldier_.  So much for the notion that only old maids care for cats.  Before going on to describe the diseases which afflict pussydom, we must give a few general instructions regarding her treatment while well.  And first, as to her food.  Pussy will catch a mouse, and after playing with it for half an hour in a way which is very cruel, but no doubt makes it very tender, she will generally kill and eat it; but it by no means follows that mice are the cat's natural food.  The majority of cats catch mice more for the love of sport than anything else.  Nothing, therefore, is more cruel than to starve poor pussy, with the erroneous idea that it will make her a good mouser; it is just the reverse.  My Phiz bids me say that mice-catching is long, weary, anxious work at the best, and she is quite certain she would die if compelled to make a living at it.  Feed your pussy well, then, if you would have her be faithful and honest, and keep your house clear of mice and rats.  I have lived a good deal in apartments in my time, and I have always avoided places where there was a lean and hungry-looking cat.  It is a sure sign of irregularity and bad housekeeping.  Twice a day is often enough, but not too often, to feed your cat, and it is better to let her have her allowance put down to her at once, instead of feeding her with tid-bits.  Nothing can be better for pussy's breakfast than oatmeal porridge and sweet milk.  _Entre nous_, reader, nothing could be better for your own breakfast.  Oatmeal is the food of both mind and matter, the food of the hero and the poet; it was the food of Wallace, Bruce, and Walter Scott, and has been the food of brave men and good since their day.    \"Oh! were I able to rehearse   Scotch oatmeal's praise in proper verse,   I'd blaw it oot as loud and fierce,           As piper's drones could blaw, man.\"  But I cannot wonder for a single moment at this favourite Scottish food being in disrepute in England, because hardly anyone knows how to make it.  Our cook at sea once undertook to supply our mess with a daily matutinal meal of porridge, and of oatcakes too.  He was sure he could make them, because his \"father had once lived in Scotland.\" Nevertheless, I gave him some additional information, and we, the Scottish officers, of whom there were two or three besides myself, were in high glee, and took an extra turn on deck the first morning, to give us a good appetite for the great coming double event.  Then down we bolted to our porridge.  Porridge! save the name, such a slimy, thin, disgusting mess you never saw!  Well might our chief engineer call out:  \"Tak' it awa', steward, tak' it awa'; it would scunner (sicken) the de'il himsel'!\"  \"But, hurrah!\"  I cried, \"there's the oatcakes to come.  Steward, where are the oatcakes?\"  The steward lifted the cover from the dish on which was wont to repose our delicious \"'spatch cock,\" or savoury curry, and there, lo and behold! half-a-dozen things of the shape and thickness of a ship's biscuit, black, and wet, and steaming, and we were supposed to eat them _with a knife and fork_!  Meanwhile the ham and eggs were fast disappearing among the Englishmen at the other end of the table, and we poor Scots had to go without our breakfast, and get laughed at into the bargain.  But here, now, I'll tell you what I'll do for you, as Cheap Jack says-- I'll give you a receipt by which you shall live a hundred years, and begin your second century a deal stronger than you began your first. Buy your meal from the meal-shop--no, not the chemist, my dear--taste it to make sure it has no \"nip;\" see, also, that it is fresh, and not ground before Culloden, and buy it neither too fine nor too round, but just a _happy medium_.  Having thus caught your hare, so to speak, go home with it, and put a saucepan on a clear fire, with a pint of beautiful spring-water, into which throw a teaspoonful, or more, of salt, and a dessert spoonful of oatmeal.  This is essential.  Then sit down and read till the water boils.  Now take your \"spurckle\" or \"whurtle\" in your right hand--I don't know the English of \"spurckle\" or \"whurtle,\" but it is a round piece of wood, rather thicker than your thumb and not so long as your arm, and you never see it silver-mounted-- and commence operations.  You stir in the meal very gradually, to prevent its getting knotted, and you occasionally pause to let it boil a moment, and you continue this until the porridge is quite thick, and the bubbles rise into small mountains ere they escape, with a sound between a \"whitch\" and a \"whirr,\" which is in itself a pleasure to listen to. And now it is ready, and you have only to pour it into a large soup-plate, sprinkle a little dry oatmeal over the top of it, and set it aside until reasonably cold.  You eat it with a spoon--not a fork--and with nice sweet milk.  \"A dish fit for a king,\" you say; \"A dish fit for the gods!\"  I resound.  Now, having told you all this, I feel I have well deserved of my country; and I'm not above accepting--a hamper at any time.  Bread-and-milk, soaked, is the next best thing for pussy; and at dinner you must let her have a wee bit "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37329"],["title","The Domestic Cat (#7)"],["body","meat.  Lights, boiled and cut in pieces, are best, but horseflesh isn't bad; but you mustn't give her too much of either, or you will induce diarrhoea.  Give her fish, occasionally, as a treat.  If pussy is a show cat, a little morsel of butter, given every day, after dinner, will make her dress her jacket with surprising regularity.  Now, as to what she drinks, a well-bred cat is always particular, and at times even fastidious; but two things they must have--water and milk. They will often prefer the former to the latter.  _But do keep their dishes clean_.  Disease is often brought on from neglect of this precaution.  Cats will drink tea or beer, and I have seen a Tom get as drunk as a duke on oatmeal and whisky.  An old lady, an acquaintance of mine, has a fine red-and-white Tom, and whenever he is ailing she gives him \"just a leetle drop o' brandy, sir.\"  Tom, I think, must have had two little drops o' brandy yesterday, when he rode my fox-terrier, Princie, all round the paddock.  Those naughty drops o' brandy!  Just one word about housing.  There is no more objectionable practice than that of turning your cat out of doors at night, and none more certain to engender disease and spoil your pussy's morals.  If you have taken the least pains to train your cat to habits of cleanliness, she will never misbehave herself.  Keep her in at night, then, and you'll have her in health; keep her in if you want to run no risk of getting her poisoned; keep her in, and the neighbours will bless you.  Don't lock her into a room, though, unless she has an attic to herself.  Let her have the run of the house from basement to roof.  Give pussy a bed to lie on, or let her find one for herself, which she has a happy knack of doing, as I daresay more than one of my readers can testify.  My pretty Phiz needn't have kittened in my cocked hat, nevertheless.  So much, then, for the prevention of disease.  We will now come to diseases themselves.  But just let me impress upon your mind, reader, this fact--that attention to your pussy's housing, drink, and the cleanliness and regularity of her diet, will almost certainly prevent her from getting sick.  CHAPTER NINE.  THE DISEASES OF CATS.  Before describing the management and treatment of feline ailments, I may as well mention that there are three different plans usually adopted for giving a cat medicine.  Pussy must first and foremost be caught--not always an easy job, as the little creature is fond of hiding away when ill.  Take her on your knee, and, as you gently soothe her, envelope her, all save the head, in a woollen shawl, and then place her in some one else's arms to hold.  Now, if it is a pill or small bolus it must be dipped in oil, and placed well down behind the tongue, and towards the roof of the mouth; if it is a powder, it may simply be placed on the tongue; but the better plan is to mix it first with a little treacle or glycerine; thirdly, if it is a fluid, the mouth must be held well open, and the medicine poured down the throat out of a small phial, but only a few drops at a time.  If your cat is suffering from any severe illness, such as bronchitis, and you value her, set aside a garret or lumber-room for her accommodation, for quiet is essential to her recovery.  Arrange her bed as common sense tells you will best suit her comfort; don't forget to let her have plenty of clean water to drink, and a large box of garden mould in the far corner of the room.  There is only one other little matter, which must not be overlooked--and, with this, pussy's little hospital is complete--Grass.  _Grass_.--This is the natural medicine of both cat and dog.  In large doses, it acts as an emetic; in smaller, as a purgative; its mode of action being similar in both cases, namely, mechanical irritation of the muscular and mucous coats of the alimentary canal; this causing spasmodic contraction of the stomach, or increasing the peristaltic motions of bowel.  Grass also possesses valuable antiscorbutic properties, and the cat, either in sickness or health, should never want a supply of it.  If pussy has been out all night at a feline entertainment on the tiles, and the excitement has produced constipation, her remedy is grass.  If she has made too free in the aviary, and the feathers of the Norwich cock lie unpleasantly on her stomach, grass is her cure; or if she, at any time, feels hot or feverish, out into the garden she goes, and a little grass, taken at intervals, soon makes her feel as fresh as the lark.  Don't let your cat want grass, then; if you live in a town, and she has some difficulty in getting it, either procure it for her yourself, or, what is better, get a boxful of earth, and sow it, and call it pussy's garden.  Now for pussy's ailments.  _Mange_.--All skin diseases in the cat, whether pustular, papular, or squamous, may be, for convenience' sake, called _mange_.  Cats are very subject to skin diseases, especially long-haired ones, and those who have been the subjects of bad or careless treatment; for they are always brought about by poverty of the blood, from under-feeding, or surfeit from over-eating on dainties.  Now I must warn the cat-fancier that there is no _specific_ for the cure of mange in the cat, and that the cure will take weeks, and at times even months; he must therefore make up his mind either to destroy the cat at once, or set about curing her in earnest.  Attend, in the first place, to her diet.  It must be nourishing, but not heating; plenty of good milk, and no meat, unless she be very thin, when raw meat in small quantities may be given twice a day.  Dress the skin with carbolic oil, washing her carefully next day; then try equal parts of sulphur-ointment and green iodide of mercury ointment, mixed with an equal bulk of lard.  Give her arsenic internally--one drop of the _Liquor arsenicalis_ twice a day, in milk, for a week, then thrice a day for another week, when you must omit it for a day or two, and then begin again.  At the same time give her, once or twice a week, a little sulphur.  Placing brimstone-roll in a cat's drinking-water is all a mistake, and does no good at all.  Sometimes the disease will only yield to a course of iodide of potash.  Give her half-grain or whole-grain doses, made into little boluses with breadcrumbs--which any chemist can make for you--twice a day.  _Ulcers_.--Cats are liable to a variety of these, but they can best and most conveniently be described as of two sorts--_constitutional_ and _accidental_.  The first are the most difficult to cure, and are usually found on the toes or feet.  Confine the cat to the house for a term; any simple ointment, such as that of zinc, will do for a dressing, as it will not hurt her if she licks it.  Put her on a course of arsenic, as recommended above; give her, once a week, one grain of calomel, or two or three grains of grey powder and a little sulphur; and, if the sores appear sluggish, touch them once a day with blue-stone or nitrate of silver.  Feed her well and regularly.  _Accidental ulcers_ are generally the result of scratches and wounds received in the hunting-field, or during some slight difference of opinion with the pussy over the way.  They require no internal treatment.  If they look angry, bathe in warm water, or milk and water, and use, occasionally, a little lotion of sulphate of zinc--ten grains to four ounces of water, to which add one drachm of tincture of lavender.  If the sores are sluggish, and indisposed to heal kindly, truss the cat in the shawl, and cauterise with nitrate of silver; afterwards dress with the mildest mercurial ointment.  _Inflammation of the eyes_ is generally the result of injury or cold caught from exposure.  It may be confined to one eye, or may attack both.  In either case the treatment is the same.  Begin by the use of a purgative--say two or three grains of compound jalap-powder mixed in glycerine, and given in the morning; give nothing but bread-and-milk to eat, and let the cat have a little sulphur mixed with butter or lard every second day.  The external treatment consists in bathing frequently with warm water or weak green tea, and the following lotion, may afterwards be used with advantage: two grains of sulphate of zinc to an ounce of water, or one grain of nitrate of silver to the same quantity of _aqua pura_.  _Simple Maladies_.--If you are fond of your cat you will naturally easily know when she is getting out of sorts or going to be ill.  When you observe, then, from her appearing dull and apathetic, refusing her food, taking to dark corners, or sleeping all day, without attempting to go out of doors; and, especially if her coat is dry; catch her at once, and give her an emetic.  Try a little salt and water first, and, if that will not act, two grains of sulphate of zinc will, given in luke-warm water.  Afterwards administer as much castor-oil as you would give to a baby, or two or three grains of grey powder.  Such treatment, taken in time, will often have the effect of cutting short a serious illness.  _Operations_.--Never hesitate to open an abscess if you think, or rather, if you are about half sure, there is matter in it.  Afterwards foment with warm water.  Poultices are unhandy.  If the cat's leg has been severely lacerated and broken in a trap, and there seems little likelihood of its being able to heal, cut it off.  Do it quietly, gently, and firmly; the ragged edge of the bone may be sawn off with a table-knife made into a saw with a file.  (I cut a man's finger off the other day with the same instrument.  About a fortnight after, the commander, sitting at luncheon, made the innocent remark: \"This knife is rather blunt, steward.  I'm hanged!\" he roared, immediately after, as he dashed the knife through the open port, \"I'm hanged if it isn't the doctor's saw!\")  Be sure to leave enough flesh to form a flap to cover the bone; stop the bleeding with the actual cautery, then sew up and dress the wound in"]]]
