The orchestra has long deserved such an attention; should such a thing ever fall to their lot, pray urge upon Stein to spread out the Podium of the orchestra as far as possible, and not to submit to the usual limited space, as they made the mistake of doing in the Gewandhaus, the Odeonsaal in Munich, etc., etc., and also, alas, in Lowenberg. The concert- hall of the Paris Conservatoire offers in this respect the right proportions, and a good part of the effect produced by the performances there is to be ascribed to this favorable condition.--  According to what I hear Bulow is not disposed to mix himself up in the preliminaries of the next Tonkunstler-Versammlung. Accordingly some one else must be entrusted with the afore- mentioned task in Carlsruhe, although Bulow was the best suited for it. If you do not care to enter at once into direct communication with Devrient, Pohl would be the best man to \"pioneer\" the way. It would not be any particular trouble to him to go from Baden to Carlsruhe, and to persuade Devrient to favor the matter. This is before all else needful, for without Devrient's co-operation nothing of the sort can be undertaken in Carlsruhe. If the Tonkunstler-Versammlung takes place not out of the theater season, then one or more theatrical performances can be given in conjunction with it, especially of Gluck's Operas; as also an ultra-classical Oratorio of Handel's might well be given over to the Carlsruhe Vocal Unions. .--.  What \"astonishing things\" are you planning, dear friend? This word excites my curiosity; but, on the other hand, I share your superstition to speak only of actions accomplished (\"faits accomplis\"). In Schelle you will gain a really valuable colleague. Has his \"History of the Sistine Chapel\" come out yet? If so, please be so good as to send me the book with the other musical things.--  My daughter, Frau von Bulow, writes to me that Wagner's new work \"Die Meistersinger\" is a marvel, and amongst other things she says:--  \"These 'Meistersinger' are, to Wagner's other conceptions, much the same as the 'Winter's Tale' is to Shakespeare's other works. Its phantasy is found in gaiety and drollery, and it has called up the Nuremberg of the Middle Ages, with its guilds, its poet- artisans, its pedants, its cavaliers, to draw forth the most fresh laughter in the midst of the highest, the most ideal, poetry. Exclusive of its sense and the destination of the work, one might compare the artistic work of it with that of the Sacraments-Hauschen of St. Lawrence (at Nuremberg). Equally with the sculptor, has the composer lighted upon the most graceful, most fantastic, most pure form,--boldness in perfection; and as at the bottom of the Sacraments-Hauschen there is Adam Kraft, holding it up with a grave and collected air, so in the 'Meistersinger' there is Hans Sachs, calm, profound, serene, who sustains and directs the action,\" etc.  This description pleased me so much that, when once I was started on the subject, I could not help sending you the long quotation. The Bulows, as you know, are with Wagner at Biebrich--at the end of this month there is to be a performance of \"Lohengrin\" at Frankfort under Wagner's direction. There must not fail to be a full account of this in the Neue Zeitschrift, and for this I could recommend my daughter as the best person. The letters in which she has written to me here and there of musical events in Berlin and elsewhere are really charming, and full of the finest understanding and striking wit.--  Berlioz was so good as to send me the printed pianoforte edition of his Opera \"Les Troyens.\" Although for Berlioz's works pianoforte editions are plainly a deception, yet a cursory reading through of \"Les Troyens\" has nevertheless made an uncommonly powerful impression on me. One cannot deny that there is enormous power in it, and it certainly is not wanting in delicacy--I might almost say subtilty--of feeling.  Pohl will let you know about the performance of Berlioz's comic Opera \"Beatrice and Benedict\" in Baden, and I venture to say that this Opera, which demands but little outside aids, and borrows its subject from a well-known Shakespeare play, will meet with a favorable reception. Berlin, or any other of the larger theaters of Germany, would certainly risk nothing of its reputation by including an Opera of Berlioz in its repertoire. [This took place a quarter of a century later.] It is no good to try to excuse oneself, or to make it a reason, by saying that Paris has committed a similar sin of omission--for things in which other people fail we should not imitate. Moreover Paris has been for years past developing a dramatic activity and initiative which Germany is far from attaining--and if special, regrettable personal circumstances prevent Berlioz from performing his works in Paris, the Germans have nothing to do with that.  Hoping soon for news of you (even if not about the \"astonishing things\"), I remain, dear friend, with faithful devotion,  F. Liszt  Rome, August 10th, 1862 Via Felice, 113  Who has corrected the proofs of the \"Faust Symphony\"? Please impress upon Schuberth not to send out into the world any unworthy editions of my works. Bulow is so good as to undertake the final revision, if only Schuberth will take the trouble to ask him to do so.    8. To Dr. Franz Brendel  Via Felice, 113 [Rome], August 29th [1862]  Dear Friend,  In explanation of the main point of your last letter (which crossed mine), namely, the question as to where the next Tonkunstler-Versammlung is to be held, let me add the following in colloquial form.  I should not, without further proof, exactly like to consider Carlsruhe as a town altogether unsuitable for the purpose-- although Pohl and Bulow are afraid it is, and have various reasons for assuming it to be so. As regards Bulow, I have already asked you not to trouble him with any of the preliminary details. When the time comes, he is certain to do his part--that is, more than could be expected or demanded of him. Only he must not be tormented with secondary considerations, not even where, owing to his position and antecedents, he is best known (for instance, in Carlsruhe, as already said). His individuality is such an exceptional one that its singularities must be allowed scope. Hence let us meanwhile leave him out of the question, he being what he is, with this reservation--that he undertakes to conduct the musical performances--as I hope and trust he will finally arrange to do. But again as to Carlsruhe, I would propose that unless you have important, positive objections to the place, you should write to the Grand Duke yourself and beg him in my name to take the Musik-Verein under his patronage, etc.--The worst that could happen to me in return would be to receive a courteously worded refusal; this, it is true, is not a kind of thing I cultivate as a rule, but as a favor to such an honorable association I would gladly face the danger, in the hope that it might prove of some use and advantage.  Write and tell me, therefore, in what spirit Seifriz has answered you, and what information Riedel has gathered in Prague. Prague, for certain (yet rather uncertain?) considerations, is indeed much to be recommended; only one would need, in some measure, to have the support of the musical authorities and notabilities of the place, as well as that of the civic corporation (because of municipal approbation and human patronage). In short, if the Tonkunstler-Versammlung were taken up and set in a good light there by a few active and influential persons, everything else would be easy to arrange, whereas otherwise all further steps would be so much trouble thrown away. I cannot altogether agree with your opinion, dear friend, that \"the difficulties would in no way be greater in Prague than in Leipzig\"--you forget that you yourself, in the capacity of a Leipzig citizen, removed most of the difficulties by your unswerving perseverance and your personal influence, whereas in Prague you could act only through the intervention of others. The question, therefore, is whether you can confidently reckon upon reliable friends there.  Until I receive further news from you, it seems to me that Bulow's idea of preferring Lowenberg to all other places is one very well worth consideration. Our amiable Prince would certainly not fail to give his earnest support to the Tonkunstler- Versammlung, and the small miseries of the little town of Lowenberg might be put up with or put down, for a few days at all events. Think this plan over again carefully, and do not look at Lowenberg through the glasses of our excellent friend Frau von Bonsart!--Of course a date would have to be fixed when the orchestra is assembled there, and the whole programme arranged with Seifriz and drawn up with his friendly co-operation. In my opinion many things might be possible in Lowenberg that could scarcely be broached elsewhere; and as, in fact, Bulow conceived the idea I expressly recommend it you as a means for \"paving the way\" to a happy issue.--  Together with your last letter I received three of the Faust essays by Pohl. I shall send him my warm thanks for them by next post, and shall add, for his bibliographical and statistical edification, the little remark that Mademoiselle Bertin had an Italian opera performed in Paris before the Revolution of July, entitled \"Faust\" or \"Fausto.\" Before Pohl's articles appear in pamphlet form I should like to have read them all through--but if he is in a hurry about them, do not mention this to him; perhaps, however, if it did not make the pamphlet too thick, it might be well to include Pohl's essay on the \"Dante Symphony\" (as it appeared in Hartel's edition of the score).  In spite of the unsatisfactory performance of the \"Dante Symphony\" in Dresden (partly, moreover, the fault of the bad, incorrectly written"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3750"],["title","Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 2 (#6)"],["body","parts, and my careless conducting), and without regard to the rapture of the spiritual substance (a matter which the general public tolerates only when demanded by the higher authority of tradition, and then immediately gapes at it upside down!)--in spite, therefore, of this grievous Dresden performance, which brought me only theone satisfaction of directly setting to work at some not unessential improvements, simplifications, and eliminations in the score-- that had taken hold of me during the rehearsals and the performance, and which I felt at once, without troubling myself about the audience present...--Now, what was I about to say, after all these parentheses and digressions? Yes, I remember now:--the \"Dante Symphony\" is a work that does not need to be ashamed of its title,--and what you tell me of the impression produced by the \"Bergsymphonie\" (in Sondershausen) strengthens me in my presumption. Hence I should be glad to see the preface by Pohl printed again, and placed at the end of the \"Faust\" pamphlet; for, considering what most people are, they require to read first, before attaining the capacity for learning, understanding, feeling, and appreciating.--  The edition of the \"Faust Symphony\" (arranged for two pianofortes) is worthy of all praise, and, in the language of music-sellers, elegant. The printer has done well in so arranging the type that a number of lines are brought on to one page and a number of bars on to every line. Schuberth shall ere long receive a complimentary note from me, together with a few \"proof\" indications for the \"Faust Symphony.\" But, in fact, I have come across only a few and unimportant errors as yet.  The publication of Lenau's two \"Faust Episodes\" (a point Pohl touches upon in his essay with fine discrimination) Schuberth might undertake according as he sees fit. I am pretty well indifferent as to whether the pianoforte arrangement or the score appears first; only, the two pieces must appear simultaneously, the \"Nachtlicher Zug\" as No. 1 and \"Mephisto's Walzer\" as No. 2. There is no thematic connection between the two pieces, it is true; but nevertheless they belong together, owing to the contrast of ideas. A \"Mephisto\" of that species could proceed only from a poodle of that species!--.--.  With the \"Elizabeth\" (of which I have now to write only the pianoforte score, which will take about a fortnight's time) I am also sending to Weimar the three Psalms in their new definitive form. It would please me if, some day, a performance of the 13th Psalm, \"How long wilt Thou forget me, O Lord?\" could be given. The tenor part is a very important one;--I have made myself sing it, and thus had King David's feelings poured into me in flesh and blood!--  It is to be hoped that Schnorr will be kind enough to adapt himself to the tenor part (the only solo voice in the Psalm, but which affects everything, and penetrates and sways chorus and orchestra). Theodor Formes sang the part very well eight years ago in Berlin; but that performance at Stern's Concert was to me only a first trial performance!--  With notes alone nothing can be accomplished; one thirsts for soul, spirit, and actual life. Ah! composing is a misery, and the pitiful children of my Muse appear to me often like foundlings in a hospital, wandering about only as Nos. so and so!--  Please give my best thanks to Schnorr for having so kindly interested himself in my orphaned \"Songs.\" His better self- consciousness--the God we carry in our breasts--requite him for it!--My daughter, Frau von Bulow, writes and tells me marvels about Schnorr and his wife, and of the performance of \"Tristan\" at Wagner's in Biebrich. If only we possessed electric telegraphs in favor of musical ubiquity! Assuredly I would not make any misuse of them, and only rarely put myself in correspondence with the music-mongers; but Tristan and Isolde are my \"soul's longing\"!  The French journals contain nothing but praise and exclamations of delight at the success of \"Benedict and Beatrice,\" Berlioz's new opera, which was performed in Baden. Pohl is sure to give you a full report of it. To judge from his essay, the tenor solo at the end of the \"Faust Symphony\" caused less offence in Leipzig (it was the stumbling-block in the Weimar performance, so much so that influential and well-disposed friends have urgently advised me to strike out the solo and chorus and to end the Symphony with the C major common chord of the orchestra). It was really my intention at first to have the whole \"Chorus mysticus\" sung invisibly--which, however, would be possible only at performances given in theaters, by having the curtain lowered. Besides which, I felt doubtful whether the sound would not have thus become too indistinct...  However it may be with this and other things, I will not fail to exercise patience and goodwill--but neither will I make too great a demand upon yours. Enough, therefore, for today from your heartily devoted  F. Liszt  P.S.--N.B.--With the next sending of music please enclose the choruses from Schumann's \"Manfred\" (Songs and pianoforte accompaniment). I shall probably this autumn be engaged with the same subject, which, in my opinion, Schumann has not exhausted.    9. To Dr. Franz Brendel  Dear Friend,  You will have heard of the grievous shock I received in the middle of September. [Liszt's eldest daughter, Mme. Blandine Ollivier, had died.] Shortly afterwards Monsieur Ollivier came to Rome, and during his stay here, which lasted till the 22nd October, I could not calculate upon being able to take any interest in other outward matters. This last week I have had to spend in bed. Hence my long delay in answering you.  So far as I understand the position of affairs with regard to the Tonkunstler-Versammlung, it seems difficult to give any definite advice. The question here is not one of theoretical, but of absolutely practical considerations, with regard to which unfortunately my influence is very limited. In my last letter I believe I told you that I am prepared, in case you decide upon Prague, to subscribe my name to the petition addressed to the Austrian ministry in behalf of state support. At the same time I intimated to you that my cousin Dr. Eduard Liszt would be the best one to draw up the said petition (in accordance with a draft sent to him), and in fact might aid the undertaking with good advice, and otherwise promote its interests. I, on my side, will not spare myself any trouble in order to obtain from the Austrian government a favorable result for the objects of the Tonkunstler- Versammlung. I cannot, of course, guarantee success beforehand; still I consider it not impossible, and when the time comes I will communicate all further details to you.  In the first place, however, comes the question whether I can take any personal part in the meeting of the Tonkunstler- Versammlung in the year '63? [This meeting did not take place in 1863, but in 1864.] And unfortunately this question I am forced to answer decidedly in the negative. Owing to its being my custom not to enlighten others by giving an account of my own affairs, I avoid, even in this case, entering further into particulars. Of this much you may meanwhile be assured with tolerable certainty: I have neither the intention nor the inclination to make any lengthened stay in Germany. Probably, however, during the course of next summer I may go to Weimar for perhaps a three weeks' visit to my gracious Master the Grand Duke. From Weimar I should go to Leipzig, and then return here by way of Trieste or Marseilles.  Requests for concert performances of my works under my direction have been addressed to me from several quarters of late. Yesterday again I received a letter on this same subject from London, to which, as in the case of the others, I shall reply with grateful thanks and excuses.--  I am firmly resolved for some length of time to continue working on here undisturbed, unremittingly and with an object. After having, as far as I could, solved the greater part of the \"Symphonic\" problem set me in Germany, I mean now to undertake the \"Oratorio\" problem (together with some other works connected with this). The \"Legend of Saint Elizabeth,\" which was altogether finished a couple of months ago, must not remain an isolated work, and I must see to it that the society it needs is forthcoming! To other people this anxiety on my part may appear trifling, useless, at all events thankless, and but little profitable; to me it is the one object in art which I have to strive after, and to which I must sacrifice everything else. At my age (51 years!) it is advisable to remain at home; what there is to seek, is to be found within oneself, not without; and, let me add, I am as much wanting in inclination to wander about as I am in the necessary means for doing so. But enough of my insignificant self. Let us pass over at once to the subject of those two brave fellows who, in your opinion, ought to play a chief part in the next Tonkunstler-Versammlung: Berlioz--and Wagner.  To class them together thus seemed strange to me at first, considering the present state of affairs. And, so far as their two-headed personality is drawn in, I hold it to be impossible even. So let us take each apart.  A) Berlioz. Considering what has occurred, and what has appeared in print, it strikes me as more than doubtful whether Berlioz would make up his mind to undertake the musical conductorship of the Tonkunstler-Versammlung, even though Benazet should come forward en personne as mediator. Besides which his moral influence at the Festival and the negotiations would be hindering and disturbing. Hence let us leave Berlioz in Paris or in Baden- Baden, and be content in being consistent and in giving him a proof of our admiration by getting up a performance of one of his larger works. (Perhaps the \"Te Deum?\"--if I am not mistaken it lasts a good hour. For Prague this choice would be appropriate-- unless the \"Requiem\" might be"]]]
