The enemy being masters of the grand road and the heights above it, he made a movement towards the mountains, and turning them (unperceived) with part of his force, gained the most commanding post in that part of the country. By day-break on the 9th instant Colonel Myers, descending the heights, took possession of la Chapelle, and a post established by the enemy above it; and on his return to the column, Sir Charles Gordon proceeded through most difficult ground to the heights of Berne, above Ance La Haye. The enemy, after having abandoned the battery of Cayman, and set fire to the village, still keeping a constant fire on him from the batteries of St. Catharine, he took a position which gave him an easy communication with the transports; when on the 12th he observed the battery and works at St. Catharine, and the posts which guarded the first ravine, abandoned by the enemy, on which he took possession of them, while Colonel Myers, with five companies of grenadiers and the forty-third regiment, crossed four ravines higher up, seizing all the batteries that defended them. This movement was completely successful, the enemy flying on every side, and our troops were soon in possession of the five batteries between Cas de Navires and Fort Royal. They then proceeded, and occupied the posts of Gentilly, La Coste, and La Archet, within a league of Fort Bourbon.       [11] They met with considerable opposition in this business; and      the boats employed in landing the troops by some mistake got close      under the enemy's batteries, before they discovered their      situation. Our loss however was less than might have been expected.      The Dromedary, venturing too near the battery of Point Negro,      received a shot between wind and water, entering under the counter,      and a second shot went through the quarter-deck barricade, killed      one man, and wounded four, among whom was Captain Tatham.

When Commodore Thompson with his division (having on board Major General Dundas and the second brigade) parted from the fleet on their voyage from Barbadoes, he proceeded with the utmost expedition to the north east part of the island; and on Feb. 5th arrived off the bay of Gallion. Captain Faulknor in the Zebra led in, and placed himself along-side of the battery on Point a Chaux, from whence he soon drove the enemy. The Beaulieu, Captain Salisbury, and the Woolwich, Captain Parker, followed; and the troops were landed without further opposition about a league from the town of Trinité, which was situated on the further side of the isthmus that formed the bay of Gallion. Here General Dundas halted for that night. Early the next morning he began his march towards Trinité. As he moved off from the ground he had occupied during the night, the enemy annoyed him much by a brisk fire of musketry from the cane fields, where a large body of them were concealed; from thence however they were soon driven by the bayonet, which (as the Commander in Chief observed[12]) in the hands of a gallant British soldier is the first of weapons. In this business we had one artilleryman killed, and two officers and three privates wounded. The General then continued his march to La Bruen, a strong post situated on an eminence immediately over the town of Trinité. The light infantry drove the enemy from this post after an action of about fifteen minutes. We had two men killed and seven or eight wounded, among which were two officers. The enemy's loss was much greater. Early on the night of the 6th our troops took possession of Fort Louis (and changed its name to Fort Dundas), and Fort Bellgarde, a post that commanded the harbour of Trinité. Mons. Bellgarde, general of the army composed of people of colour, finding that we had taken possession of the forts, made a precipitate retreat towards the mountains, having previously set fire to the town of Trinité, the best part of which, together with a great quantity of stores of all kinds, was consumed; but Commodore Thompson took possession of the vessels in the harbour and road. In all these attacks the seamen (under command of Captain Salisbury) bore a part, and by their intrepidity and good conduct gained the esteem as well as applause of the army.       [12] Vide Appendix, page 7.  On the evening of the 7th General Dundas proceeded with his brigade to the attack of Gros Morne, where he was informed General Bellgarde was strongly posted in considerable force; but on his arrival he found the forts evacuated. Gros Morne is a situation of great importance, being strongly fortified, and commanding the principal pass between the northern and southern parts of the island, and famous for being the rendezvous of the democrats during the revolution, previous to our arrival. Besides the principal fort, there is a redoubt on either side, about a mile distant, commanding the road leading to the fort. A detachment of the queen's regiment and a party of the marines being left to garrison Trinité, under command of Major Skerret, and the battalion of the 64th to garrison Le Gros Morne, the remainder of the brigade marched early in the morning of the 9th instant, and on the evening of the same day took possession of a strong situation called Bruno, where there had formerly been a fort, some of the guns of which were still remaining: it lies about two leagues north east of Fort Bourbon, and from it our army could see the enemy in their out-posts from that fort[13]. After the troops had halted for some time, Colonel Cradock with three companies of the second battalion of grenadiers was ordered to advance and take possession of the post of Maltide, where a considerable number of the enemy were assembled with their colours flying; but on his approach they evacuated the place in haste. Of this post our troops had the quiet possession that night, and all the next day; but in the night between the 10th and 11th they were attacked by a party of the enemy, commanded by Mons. Bellgarde, amounting to about eight hundred men, who, having crept up under cover of the canes and underwood, commenced a heavy fire on our troops, who, though rather taken by surprise, charged the enemy in their turn with such vigour and determined bravery, as forced them sorely to repent their temerity, and retreat towards Fort Bourbon with considerable loss. In this action Captain M'Ewen of the thirty-eighth regiment and seven privates were killed, and nineteen wounded. Next day a great quantity of fire arms were picked up, which the enemy had left behind them in their precipitate retreat. In the evening of the 11th the post was reinforced by three companies of grenadiers and part of the second battalion of light infantry; but that night all was quiet. Early on the morning of the 12th the grenadiers were ordered back to Bruno, and the battalion of the sixth regiment, commanded by Major Scott, took their place at Maltide, and the wounded were sent on board the hospital ship.       [13] About this time the army had nearly experienced an irreparable      loss. As General Dundas was writing in his tent, a notorious      villain, of the name of Barbarose, presented himself at the door of      the tent, demanding to speak with the General, who, to drive him      away, called to the centinel to \"bayonet the fellow;\" on which, in      his fright, he dropped a dagger well oiled; and on being seized,      proved to have been the assassin of a French royalist.  As the bay and harbour of Fort Royal were now completely opened to our shipping by the capture of Pigeon Island, the Commander in Chief moved forward on the 14th from La Riviere Sallée to Bruno with the remainder of the first brigade, a principal part of which had, under General Prescott, reached that place the day before; having previously concerted the attack of St. Pierré with General Dundas, that general marched on the evening of the 13th from Bruno with the second battalion of grenadiers, the thirty-third and fortieth light companies, and the sixty-fifth regiment, to Gros Morne, where he halted that night, and early on the 14th marched to Trinité; from whence he dispatched a sloop with the packs and blankets of his army round towards la Basse Pointe, in order to expedite his march toward St. Pierre, the capital of the island, the capture of which was now his object. From Gros Morne General Dundas had detached Colonel Campbell through the woods by Bois le Buc with the second battalion of light infantry and sixty-fifth regiment to Montigné. At five o'clock in the evening of the 14th General Dundas marched from Trinité (being joined by a company of the second or queen's regiment, commanded by the Honourable Captain Ramsay): after marching all night he halted for three hours; and soon after day-break on the morning of the 15th, having passed the river Capot, arrived at the heights of Calbass, after a march of thirty miles over a rough mountainous country. The fatigue of such a march in a tropical climate can only be conceived by those who have experienced it: harassed and worn down, it was necessary to give the troops some rest before they attempted to ascend the steep and craggy mountain, over the top of which was their road, commanded by a battery, where the enemy appeared in great force, with their colours flying. The spirit of our soldiers however overcame all difficulties, and they ascended the heights with such alacrity, that the enemy, alarmed at their determined conduct, evacuated the fort (fortunately for our men), without making any resistance; as, by the time they reached the summit of the mountain, they were so exhausted,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38178"],["title","An Account of the Campaign in the West Indies, in the Year 1794 (#7)"],["body","a steady opposition might have proved fatal to them. From hence (the post having previously been destroyed by the enemy, who had broken the guns and scattered the ammunition) General Dundas proceeded about four miles further, to a place called Morne Rouge: here he halted, and shortly after saw Colonel Campbell at Post au Pin, half a mile short of Montigné, under a heavy fire from five or six hundred of the enemy, strongly posted. General Dundas instantly pushed forward his advanced guard, under command of the Hon. Captain Ramsay, who gained the summit by extraordinary exertions, fired on the enemy, at that time engaged with Colonel Campbell, and silenced their fire; and, when joined by the second battalion of grenadiers, took possession of Montigné, where he was reinforced by two companies of grenadiers. The major general took post himself on Morne Rouge, and visiting Colonel Campbell's column, found he had been attacked at half past nine o'clock in the morning, and the enemy being within twenty yards of the fortieth light company, at the head of which he was, had charged them with bayonets, when, to the great grief of the whole army, he fell by a ball through his head from the musket of a mulatto, who had concealed himself behind a bush till the Colonel came close up to it. Colonel Campbell was a man high in estimation as a military character, and no less respected for his private worth, being sincere in his friendships and steady in his attachments. When General Dundas arrived at Morne Rouge, the enemy were on their march to re-attack our troops; but the appearance of our grenadiers so near them, caused them to relinquish their plan at that time: but in the evening of the same day the General observed bodies of the enemy moving towards his front at Morne Rouge, and forming under a small redoubt near that post. The thirty-third, thirty-fourth, and forty-fourth companies of grenadiers, with a field piece, and Captain Whitworth of the artillery (the whole under the command of Major Forbes), were ordered to advance, when a smart engagement commenced. The enemy were covered by a brisk fire from two field pieces on Morne Bellvieu, a strongly situated battery immediately in their rear. The action continued for about half an hour, when the enemy gave way, and during the night abandoned the fort, leaving two field pieces behind them. From the number of graves observed the following day (corroborated by the accounts of some prisoners), their loss must have been considerable; ours consisted of one officer (Lieutenant Keating of the thirty-third regiment) and two privates wounded, and one private killed.--At two o'clock the following morning the sixteenth, thirty-fifth, and fifty-fifth companies of grenadiers were ordered to advance and storm the battery upon Morne Bellvieu, and were to be supported (if necessary) by the ninth and sixty-fifth companies. All their flints were taken out, the bayonet alone to be the soldier's defence. However, the enemy had been so roughly handled the day before, that they thought fit to decamp during the night, and our troops took possession of the fort without any opposition. Our army had now arrived within two leagues of St. Pierre, from whence by day-break the enemy sent a flag of truce, requiring three days to consider of a capitulation; to which General Dundas returned an answer, that instead of three days, he would allow them only three hours; and if they did not surrender within that time, he would advance against the town. The fifty-fifth company of grenadiers being left in possession of Bellvieu, the remainder of the battalion moved on towards St. Pierré. In the mean time the Admiral, Sir John Jervis, to co-operate with the land forces under General Dundas, had ordered the following ships to sail for the bay of St. Pierre, the Asia, Veteran, Santa Margarita, Blonde, Rattlesnake, Zebra, and Nautilus, with the Vesuvius bomb. On board of this fleet Colonel Symes had embarked with three light companies, and Major Maitland with a detachment of the fiftieth regiment; Colonel Myers with five companies of the first battalion of grenadiers, and five companies of the third battalion of light infantry, (for the same purpose of co-operating with General Dundas) had marched from Camp la Coste towards Trinité.  The fleet on their arrival in the bay prepared for instant operation. Colonel Symes, with the troops and seamen who were to land with him, had, previous to their entering the bay, embarked on board of the Zebra and Nautilus sloops, and some other vessels, which, being small, could get nearer the shore, thereby rendering the debarkation of the troops much less difficult.  In the evening of Feb. 16th they began to work towards the north part of the bay, beyond the Jesuits' College, the other men of war standing towards the town to cover them. About eleven o'clock the vessels with troops and seamen on board were under a cross fire from two batteries of red hot shot, which happily did them no damage, though they fell round and near them. Captain Harvey in the Santa Margarita, perceiving the troops were likely to be much annoyed, went close under the guns of the most considerable of the two batteries, which he silenced; and about four in the morning of the 17th the troops and seamen made good their landing, and found that the enemy had left the other battery. During the night the Vesuvius bomb did much execution with her shells, many of them falling in the town, to which it set fire in some places: the fire however was soon extinguished. The batteries in the town and on the adjacent hills kept up a constant fire of shot and shells on the men of war, as they advanced towards the town, which was returned with great spirit. The Santa Margarita was struck with a shell, which fortunately neither fired her, nor did any considerable damage. Colonel Symes on landing advanced with the troops towards St. Pierre, which the enemy evacuated on his approach, leaving their guns primed and loaded, and their colours flying, which were hauled down by our people, and the British union hoisted. About ten the whole of the troops and seamen had marched into the town. No man was suffered to quit his ranks, nor was the least injury done to any of the inhabitants, who, with the women and children, sat at their doors and windows to see our army march in, the same as when troops pass through a town in England. While our men were drawn up in the market place, a flag of truce came in from General Dundas, who with his army was on the hills near the town, and was on his march to attack it. This flag was in answer to one sent by the enemy to him, offering to capitulate. The officer who brought the flag was agreeably surprised to find on his entering the town that it was already in the possession of his countrymen. In the evening General Dundas with the army marched in; and having taken possession of the government-house, he instantly established quiet and good order in the town. As our troops marched into St. Pierre a drummer was discovered in the act of plundering one of the peaceable inhabitants, for which he was instantly hung up at the gate of the Jesuits' College, by order of the provost marshal. In the evening the seamen embarked on board their respective ships. The men of war having anchored in the bay, were busily employed in taking an account of and unbending the sails of the different ships in the harbour. Unfortunately at day-break of this morning, when the town surrendered, a schooner got out of the south side of the bay, in which it was reported there was a considerable quantity of money and some people of distinction. She passed within gun-shot of the Santa Margarita, who (for some reason or other) did not fire at her to bring her to. The next morning the Santa Margarita sailed to Fort Royal bay with Mons. Au Cane[14], the mayor of St. Pierre, and Abbé Maunier, the vicar general of the island, and other prisoners.       [14] On our first arrival at the island of Martinique, the      Commanders in Chief dispatched Captain Mason (aid de camp to the      General) bearing a flag of truce, with a summons to the town of St.      Pierre. Au Cane, the mayor, met him on the quay on horseback,      attended by a numerous body of armed men, with a field piece; &c.      and instead of reading the letter and summons, dismissed him rudely      with threats.  St. Pierre is a long handsome town, situated on the shore of an open bay, and flanked by a strong battery at either end; also defended by two redoubts on the hills which overhang the town. The surrounding country rises in a succession of hills beautifully variegated with woods and sugar plantations; and near the town are some fine gardens, which before the revolution had been kept up in a superior stile of elegance and convenience. Each street of this beautiful town is watered by a clear stream from the mountains, running rapidly down the middle, which adds greatly to the health as well as convenience of the place. The streets in general are narrow and rough paved, but very regular; the houses are built of a fine stone like free-stone, the lower apartments of which were in general handsomely, and sometimes superbly, furnished.  There are two convents of nuns, one dedicated to St. Ursuline, the other called Les Blancs. The Ursuline convent has very beautiful gardens, situated at the declivity of a hill, which rises immediately behind the town: it was in a wretched state when we took it, the poor nuns having been deprived of their revenues by the revolutionists. Near this convent is a neat church, whose high altar, as well as pavement, is of good marble. Not far from the church is the opera house, which, from its high roof, is a very conspicuous object. Towards the south end of the town is the church of Notre Dame de bon Porte du Mouillage (of which Pere Maunier, one of the chiefs of the revolution, was curé). It is a handsome building: round the grand altar (which"]]]
