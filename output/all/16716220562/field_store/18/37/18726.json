CHAPTER III  THE ANGLER AND THE FISHERMAN   One profound proof of the soundness in the philosophy that teaches against wantonly wasteful slaughter in the chase is the disinclination on the part of certain so-called sportsmen--a vulgar gentry that resort to the woods and waters solely because it is fashionable to do so--and their guides to honorably dispose of their game after the killing. These greedy snobs are viciously adverse to losing a single bird or fish in the pursuit, but they think little of letting the game rot in the sun after the play. With this fact easily provable any day in the year, it may be said that outside of market fishing and camp fishing for the pot the one real object in fishing and angling is the pursuit itself and not the quarry.  In baseball, it's the game, not the bases; in archery, it's the straightest shooting, not the target. True, we play cards for prizes, but surely as much for the game itself, not altogether for the prizes, because it is possible to buy the prizes or their equivalent outright or take the prizes by force.  My bayman develops fits bordering closely upon incurable hysteria if I lose a single bluefish in the play, but he worries not when he goes ashore with a sloopful of hand-liners and half a hundred fish he cannot make good use of.  \"Pull it in! you'll lose it!\" \"We could catch a hundred if you wouldn't fool!\" \"The other boats'll beat us badly!\" \"There's a million right 'round the boat!\"  These are a few of his excitable expressions. But, when I say to him, \"What's the difference, Captain, in losing one or two fish here and wasting half a hundred on shore?\" he calms down for a minute or two. Only for a minute or two, however, for he's in the game solely for fish, not the fishing. It's all numbers and size with him, and he's encouraged in this greed by nine out of every ten men he takes aboard his boat.  \"We caught fifty,\" says Tom.  \"We caught a hundred and ten,\" says Dick.  \"We caught two hundred and sixty,\" says Harry.  And so the bayman brags, too, because it's purely business with him.  I have always found the greatest pleasure in fishing is the fishing and not the blood and bones associated with the pursuit. I would rather take five fair fish on fine tackle correctly manipulated than fill the hold with a hundred horrid monsters mastered by mere strength, as in hand-line trolling for bluefish in the ocean and for muskellonge, etc., in fresh water.  \"But,\" says Captain Getemanyway, \"I can catch more fish with a hand-line than you can with your fine rod and reel.\"  \"Of course you can,\" I reply, \"and you could catch more if you used a net, a stick of dynamite, or a shotgun.\"  If it's the fish alone that is the object of the Angler's eye, why resort to any sort of tackle when there's a fish stall in every bailiwick?  There is great need of enlightenment in the common ethics of angling. Many persons are under the impression that quantity rather than quality makes the Angler's day.  According to their view of the pursuit, fishing is judged by figures, as in finance--glory to the man with the biggest balance. This is not so, because with this view accepted, Rockefeller would shine above Christ, Shakespeare, and Lincoln.  The mere catch--the number of fish taken--is only one little detail; it is not all of angling. If it were, the superior fisherman would be the man who got his fish in any manner.  Some of our greatest Anglers purposely never excel in the matter of numbers. The Angler's true qualities are based on the application of correct tackle, correct methods in fishing, and a correct appreciation of the pursuit, the game, the day, and the craft.  'Tis the day and the play, not the heads and hides that count.  An ancient writer says of the royal hounds: \"The hunter loves to see the hounds pursue the hare, and he is glad if the hare escapes.\" So it is in angling; we do not wish to catch all the fish we can take in any fashion. We want to take some of them in a proper manner with appropriate implements.  \"I can catch more trout with the angleworm and more bass with the trolling spoon than you can with the artificial fly,\" says Robert.  \"Of course you can, Robert,\" say I, \"and you could catch still more if you spread a screen across the tiny stream or set a trap, or if you used a set line with a hundred hooks, just as the target shooter might more readily puncture the circle with a charge of shot than with the single bullet, or just as the greedyman with a blunderbuss might excel in number the wing shot by potting quail bunched on the ground instead of chivalrously bagging single birds on the wing with a pertinent arm.\"  The neophyte always confounds the angler with the indiscriminate fisherman and so implicates the angler in the cruelty and wastefulness associated with mere chance fishing, when in fact the Angler is the real propagator and protector of the fishes, and is in no sense cruel or wasteful.  The laws that prohibit greedy catches, and protect the mother fish in breeding time, are made by, enforced by, and supported financially by the Angler.  The rearing of the fishes that are placed in depleted waters was originated by, is conducted by, and is paid for by the Angler.  No other class has earnestly bothered its head, honestly lifted its hands, or liberally opened its purse in these matters, and the nearest association man in general has with the preservation of both wild fish and fowl is in uttering a cowardly, false accusation against the one who really deserves sole credit for the work, the sportsman, the genuine field sportsman, not the vicious sporting man of the race track, cockpit, and gambling den--two distinct species of animal, as vastly separated in character as the deerhound and the dragon.  And why this charge against the innocent? Simply because the guilty wish to shield and profit themselves, as the thief cries fire that he may pick your pocket in the panic that ensues.  But then there is a well meaning but wholly unenlightened element, that, influenced by the cry of the methodical spoiler, ignorantly condemns the honest man--the really humane men and women who are sincere in their condemnation but totally ignorant of their subject.  One of this sort, an estimable woman in public life, loudly preaches against the chase and is all the time drawing dividends that provide her with the means to indulge in the vulgarest and cruelest of fashionable extravagances--among them the wool of the unborn lamb, furs from the backs of fast-disappearing quadrupeds, and feathers of the farmers' most valuable insect-destroying song birds--and these wicked dividends derived from several acid factories, a gas house, a power plant, and a dye works that have not only killed off the trillions of fishes in several rivers but destroyed forever the very habitat of the species!  Another of this sort is well exemplified in the character of an old gentleman in Pennsylvania who loudly proclaims against trout fishing, but who utterly ruins nearly eight miles of trout water, once the home of thousands of lordly fish, by permitting his mill hands to run off sawdust in the streams.  This poor, ignorant soul objects to you and me chivalrously taking half a dozen specimens on the fly--catching the cunning trout with an imitation of the living thing itself destroys by the thousands for food and play--while he mercilessly slaughters the entire immediate supply, and prevents further propagation of the whole species with the refuse of his forest-devastating, money-making machine.  True, the Angler like all fishermen, and like the fishes themselves, kills his specimens, but this killing is ordained by nature herself--at least it has better grounds for excuse, if excuse it needs, than that ten-fold more destructive killing _by_ the fishes that not only slay for food, but actually "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37856"],["title","The Determined Angler and the Brook Trout (#4)"],["body","millions upon millions of their kind for the mere play afforded them in this practice--and though the Angler may be in the wrong when he humanely dispatches a few of the batch he breeds, he is not as hopeless as the wanton fisher, or as brutal as the unenlightened \"reformers,\" the so-called humane lady with the fashionable furs and feathers of fast-disappearing species she never turns a hair to replenish or protect, and the old gentleman hypocrite with his murderous sawmill.     CHAPTER IV  FLY-FISHING   \"Of all sports, commend me to angling; it is the wisest, virtuousest, best.\"--THOMAS HOOD.  When I go fishing, it is for the purpose of catching fish; when I go angling--fly-fishing--it is the soul I seek to replenish, not the creel.  \"One of the charms of angling,\" says Pritt, \"is that it presents an endless field for argument, speculation, and experiment.\"  True, but Anglers have no argument in the first feature of their pastime--the object of it. Fishermen and men who do not go fishing or angling argue that the object sought by the Angler is the fish, but Anglers all agree that the game is but one of the trillion of pleasant things that attract them to the pursuit of it.  They argue and speculate and experiment in the matter of rods and tackle, and they argue as to the virtues of the various species, the qualities of the waters, the conditions of the weather, but they have ever been and ever will be calmly agreed as to the object of it all--the love of studying rather than destroying the game, the love of the pursuit itself.  They angle because of its healthfulness, and the consequent exhilaration of mind and body that attends the gentle practice, not merely for the fishes it may procure them, or for the sake of killing something, as the unenlightened person charges, for the death of an animal, to the Angler, is the saddest incident of his day.  All things animate, man included, were made to kill and to be killed. The only crimes in killing are in killing our own kind, and in killing any kind inhumanly.  And, of all creatures, the Angler is the least offender in these crimes. The very game he seeks, though beautiful and gentle to the eye, and, at times, noble in deed and purpose, is the most brutal killer of all the races--the lovely trout in its attacks upon gaudy flies, the valiant bass and pike in devouring their smaller brethren, and the multitudinous sea-fishes, not alone in their feeding upon one another, but in their wanton murder of the millions upon millions of victims of their pure love of slaughter.  But, of fly-fishing for brook trout:  \"Fly-fishing,\" says Dr. Henshall, \"is the poetry of angling\"; and \"the genuine Angler,\" says Frederick Pond, \"is invariably a poet.\"  Fly-fishing, the highest order of angling, is indulged in in several forms--in fresh water for salmon, trout, black bass, grayling, perch, pike-perch, pickerel (Long Island brook pickerel), sunfish, roach, dace, shad, herring (branch), etc.; in brackish water for shad, trout, white perch, etc.; and in salt water for bluefish (young), herring (common), mackerel, and--doubt not, kind sir, for I am prepared to prove it--squeteague (weakfish), plaice (fluke, summer flounder), and other species of both bottom and surface habitats--another \"endless field for argument, speculation, and experiment.\"  As there are many forms of fly-fishing, so are there many ways of fly-fishing for trout, and many kinds of trout, the various forms of brook trout, lake trout, and sea trout.  Volumes would be required to discourse intelligently upon all these forms of trout and fly-fishing for them; so I purpose in this particular instance to confine myself to one species and one form of trout and one order of fly-fishing.  The trout referred to is the true brook trout, scientifically alluded to as _Salvelinus fontinalis_ and commonly called, besides brook trout (its most popular name), speckled trout, mountain trout, speckled beauty, spotted trout, etc.  The fly-fishing treated of is that popular form that is most indulged in by the Eastern trout fly-fisherman--small-stream fishing in the mountains and wooded level lands that \"carries us,\" as Davy wrote as far away as 1828, \"into the most wild and beautiful scenery of nature to the clear and lovely streams that gush from the high ranges of elevated hills.\"  Above all other styles of fly-fishing, it calls for the most delicate tackle and the very daintiest hand.  \"How delightful,\" says the author of _Salmonia_, \"in the early spring, after the dull and tedious time of winter, when the frosts disappear and the sunshine warms the earth and waters, to wander forth by some clear stream, to see the leaf bursting from the purple bud, to scent the odors of the bank perfumed by the violet, and enameled, as it were, with the primrose and the daisy; to wander upon the fresh turf below the shade of trees, whose bright blossoms are filled with the music of the bee; and on the surface of the waters to view the gaudy flies sparkling like animated gems in the sunbeams, whilst the bright and beautiful trout is watching them from below; to hear the twittering of the water-birds, who, alarmed at your approach, rapidly hide themselves beneath the flowers and leaves of the water-lily; and, as the season advances, to find all these objects changed for others of the same kind, but better and brighter, till the swallow and the trout contend as it were for the May fly, and till in pursuing your amusement in the calm and balmy evening you are serenaded by the songs of the cheerful thrush, performing the offices of paternal love in thickets ornamented with the rose and woodbine.\"  The other forms of fly-fishing for trout, the pursuit of larger specimens of the same species in larger waters, the lakes and ponds and rivers--all equally inviting by their gentle requirements and the \"beautiful scenery of nature\"--deserve special treatment, because, as in fly-fishing for salmon (_salmo salar_), the very top notch of all forms of angling, the play, the player, the scenes, and the accessories are sufficiently different to confound the reader I am mainly endeavoring to amuse with these particular lines.  Small stream fly-fishing for brook trout belongs in a class just between fly-fishing for the brook trout of broader waters, the lakes and ponds, and fly-fishing for salmon in the lordly rivers of Maine and Canada.  The brook trout is angled for in the spring and summer, principally with the artificial fly, and by the chivalric Angler only with the artificial fly, though many greedy fishermen of trifling experience and wholly deprived of the true spirit of angling--in that they fish for the fish alone and judge their day and play solely by the size of their catch--contrive to convince us that the live lure is equally honorable, notwithstanding that the cruel, clumsy, uncleanly, unfair, wasteful practice of live-bait trout fishing is condemned by every truly gentle disciple and practical authority.  Most advocates of live-bait trout fishing, who would have us believe that their method is entitled to recognition in the same category with fly-fishing, proudly proclaim that this should be because they \"can catch more fish with the worm or minnow than the Angler can catch with his fly.\"  If this reasoning is to settle the debate, if killing and quantity compose the Angler's axiom, why not resort to still more productive means--dynamite, or net the stream instead of gently fishing it?  No, the trout fly-fisherman abhors trout bait-fishing for the same reason the wing shot prefers his appropriate arm to a cannon; the yachtsman, his gentle craft to a man-o'-war; the horseman, his trained mount to a locomotive; the archer, his arrow instead of a harpoon; and so I might go on in similes that would burlesque every form of recreative amusement in the world.  The brook trout breeds in the autumn, favors eddies, riffles, pools, and deep spots under the banks of the stream, and near rocks and fallen trees, and feeds on flies, small fish, worms, and other small life forms.  Its shape, weight, size, and color are influenced by its food, its age, its activity, its habitat, and its habits. Its color corresponds to the color of the water bottom and will change as the water bottom changes. If removed to a new water, where the bottom color is different from the bottom color of its first abode--lighter or darker, as the case may be,--it will gradually grow to a corresponding shade, blending with its new habitat just as its colors suited the stones and grasses and earthy materials of its native domain.  In weight, the brook trout ranges up to ten pounds in large waters. There is a record of one weighing eleven pounds. This specimen was taken in Northwestern Maine. The species averages threequarters of a pound to one pound and a half in the streams, and one pound to three pounds in the lakes and ponds. It occurs between latitude 32-1/2° and 55°, in the lakes and streams of the Atlantic watershed, near the sources of a few rivers flowing into the Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico, and some of the southern affluents of Hudson Bay, its range being limited by the western foothills of the Alleghanies, extending about three hundred miles from the coast, except about the Great Lakes, in the northern tributaries of which it abounds. It also inhabits the headwaters of the Chattahoochee, in the southern spurs of the Georgia Alleghanies, and tributaries of the Catawba in North Carolina and clear waters of the great islands of the Gulf of St. Lawrence--Anticosti, Cape Breton, Prince Edward, and Newfoundland; and abounds in New York, Michigan, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maine. Long Island, Canada, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.  My favorite rod for stream trout fishing is a cork-handled, all-lancewood rod of three or four ounces in weight and eight feet in length, or a rod of similar length weighing four or five ounces and made of split bamboo--the best"]]]
