The more I study hens, the more things they seem able to get along without--which abruptly disturbed her calm detachment. She shot out at the spot where Mr. Chase was waiting with his coat off, and was promptly enveloped in that garment and captured.  \"The essence of strategy,\" observed Mr. Chase approvingly, \"is surprise. A neat piece of work!\"  I thanked him. He deprecated my thanks. He had, he said, only done his duty, as expected to by England. He then introduced me to the elderly Irishman, who was, it seemed, a professor at Dublin University, by name, Derrick. Whatever it was that he professed, it was something that did not keep him for a great deal of his time at the University. He informed me that he always spent his summers at Combe Regis.  \"I was surprised to see you at Combe Regis,\" I said. \"When you got out at Yeovil, I thought I had seen the last of you.\"  I think I am gifted beyond other men as regards the unfortunate turning of sentences.  \"I meant,\" I added, \"I was afraid I had.\"  \"Ah, of course,\" he said, \"you were in our carriage coming down. I was confident I had seen you before. I never forget a face.\"  \"It would be a kindness,\" said Mr. Chase, \"if you would forget Garnet's as now exhibited. You seem to have collected a good deal of the scenery coming through that hedge.\"  \"I was wondering----\" I said. \"A wash--if I might----\"  \"Of course, me boy, of course,\" said the professor. \"Tom, take Mr. Garnet off to your room, and then we'll have lunch. You'll stay to lunch, Mr. Garnet?\"  I thanked him, commented on possible inconvenience to his arrangements, was overruled, and went off with my friend the lieutenant to the house. We imprisoned Aunt Elizabeth in the stables, to her profound indignation, gave directions for lunch to be served to her, and made our way to Mr. Chase's room.  \"So you've met the professor before?\" he said, hospitably laying out a change of raiment for me--we were fortunately much of a height and build.  \"I have never spoken to him,\" I said. \"We travelled down from London in the same carriage.\"  \"He's a dear old boy, if you rub him the right way. But--I'm telling you this for your good and guidance; a man wants a chart in a strange sea--he can cut up rough. And, when he does, he goes off like a four-point-seven and the population for miles round climbs trees. I think, if I were you, I shouldn't mention Sir Edward Carson at lunch.\"  I promised that I would try to avoid the temptation.  \"In fact, you'd better keep off Ireland altogether. It's the safest plan. Any other subject you like. Chatty remarks on Bimetallism would meet with his earnest attention. A lecture on What to do with the Cold Mutton would be welcomed. But not Ireland. Shall we do down?\"  We got to know each other at lunch.  \"Do you hunt hens,\" asked Tom Chase, who was mixing the salad--he was one of those men who seemed to do everything a shade better than anyone else--\"for amusement or by your doctor's orders? Many doctors, I believe, insist on it.\"  \"Neither,\" I said, \"and especially not for amusement. The fact is, I've been lured down here by a friend of mine who has started a chicken farm--\"  I was interrupted. All three of them burst out laughing. Tom Chase allowed the vinegar to trickle on to the cloth, missing the salad-bowl by a clear two inches.  \"You don't mean to tell us,\" he said, \"that you really come from the one and only chicken farm? Why, you're the man we've all been praying to meet for days past. You're the talk of the town. If you can call Combe Regis a town. Everybody is discussing you. Your methods are new and original, aren't they?\"  \"Probably. Ukridge knows nothing about fowls. I know less. He considers it an advantage. He says our minds ought to be unbiassed.\"  \"Ukridge!\" said the professor. \"That was the name old Dawlish, the grocer, said. I never forget a name. He is the gentleman who lectures on the management of poultry? You do not?\"  I hastened to disclaim any such feat. I had never really approved of these infernal talks on the art of chicken-farming which Ukridge had dropped into the habit of delivering when anybody visited our farm. I admit that it was a pleasing spectacle to see my managing director in a pink shirt without a collar and very dirty flannel trousers lecturing the intelligent native; but I had a feeling that the thing tended to expose our ignorance to men who had probably had to do with fowls from their cradle up.  \"His lectures are very popular,\" said Phyllis Derrick with a little splutter of mirth.  \"He enjoys them,\" I said.  \"Look here, Garnet,\" said Tom Chase, \"I hope you won't consider all these questions impertinent, but you've no notion of the thrilling interest we all take--at a distance--in your farm. We have been talking of nothing else for a week. I have dreamed of it three nights running. Is Mr. Ukridge doing this as a commercial speculation, or is he an eccentric millionaire?\"  \"He's not a millionaire yet, but I believe he intends to be one shortly, with the assistance of the fowls. But you mustn't look on me as in any way responsible for the arrangements at the farm. I am merely a labourer. The brainwork of the business lies in Ukridge's department. As a matter of fact, I came down here principally in search of golf.\"  \"Golf?\" said Professor Derrick, with the benevolent approval of the enthusiast towards a brother. \"I'm glad you play golf. We must have a round together.\"  \"As soon as ever my professional duties will permit,\" I said gratefully.   * * * * *  There was croquet after lunch,--a game of which I am a poor performer. Phyllis Derrick and I played the professor and Tom Chase. Chase was a little better than myself; the professor, by dint of extreme earnestness and care, managed to play a fair game; and Phyllis was an expert.  \"I was reading a book,\" she said, as we stood together watching the professor shaping at his ball at the other end of the lawn, \"by an author of the same surname as you, Mr. Garnet. Is he a relation of yours?\"  \"My name is Jeremy, Miss Derrick.\"  \"Oh, you wrote it?\" She turned a little pink. \"Then you must have--oh, nothing.\"  \"I couldn't help it, I'm afraid.\"  \"Did you know what I was going to say?\"  \"I guessed. You were going to say that I must have heard your criticisms in the train. You were very lenient, I thought.\"  \"I didn't like your heroine.\"  \"No. What is a 'creature,' Miss Derrick?\"  \"Pamela in your book is a 'creature,'\" she replied unsatisfactorily.  Shortly after this the game came somehow to an end. I do not understand the intricacies of croquet. But Phyllis did something brilliant and remarkable with the balls, and we adjourned for tea. The sun was setting as I left to return to the farm, with Aunt Elizabeth stored neatly in a basket in my hand. The air was deliciously cool, and full of that strange quiet which follows soothingly on the skirts of a broiling midsummer afternoon. Far away, seeming to come from another world, a sheep-bell tinkled, deepening the silence. Alone in a sky of the palest blue there gleamed a small, bright star.  I addressed this star.  \"She was certainly very nice to me. Very nice indeed.\" The star said nothing.  \"On the other hand, I take it that, having had a decent up-bringing, she would have been equally polite to any other man whom she had happened to meet at her father's house. Moreover, I don't feel altogether easy in my mind about that naval chap. I fear the worst.\"  The star winked.  \"He calls her Phyllis,\" I said.  \"Charawk!\" chuckled Aunt Elizabeth from her basket, in that beastly cynical, satirical way which has made her so disliked by all right-thinking people.    CHAPTER VIII  A LITTLE DINNER AT UKRIDGE'S  \"Edwin comes to-day,\" said Mrs. Ukridge.  \"And the Derricks,\" said Ukridge, sawing at the bread in his energetic way. \"Don't forget the Derricks, Millie.\"  \"No, dear. Mrs. Beale is going to give us a very nice dinner. We talked it over yesterday.\"  \"Who is Edwin?\" I asked.  We were finishing breakfast on the second morning after my visit to the Derricks. I had related my adventures to the staff of the farm on my return, laying stress on the merits of our neighbours and their interest in our doings, and the Hired Retainer had been sent off next morning with a note from Mrs. Ukridge inviting them to look over the farm and stay to dinner.  \"Edwin?\" said Ukridge. \"Oh, beast of a cat.\"  \"Oh, Stanley!\" said Mrs. Ukridge plaintively. \"He's not. He's such a dear, Mr. Garnet. A beautiful, pure-bred Persian. He has taken prizes.\"  \"He's always taking something. That's why he didn't come down with us.\"  \"A great, horrid, _beast_ of a dog bit him, Mr. Garnet. And poor Edwin had to go to a cats' hospital.\"  \"And I hope,\" said Ukridge, \"the experience will do him good. Sneaked a dog's dinner, Garnet, under his very nose, if you please. Naturally the dog lodged a protest.\"  \"I'm so afraid that he will be frightened of Bob. He will be very timid, and Bob's so boisterous. Isn't he, Mr. Garnet?\"  \"That's all right,\" said Ukridge. \"Bob won't hurt him, unless he tries to steal his dinner. In that case we will have Edwin made into a rug.\"  \"Stanley doesn't like Edwin,\" said Mrs. Ukridge, sadly.  Edwin arrived early in the afternoon, and was shut into the kitchen. He struck me as a handsome cat, but nervous.  The Derricks followed two hours later. Mr. Chase was not of the party.  \"Tom had to go to London,\" explained the professor, \"or he would have been delighted to come. It was a disappointment to the boy, for he wanted to see the farm.\"  \"He must come some other time,\" said Ukridge. \"We invite inspection. Look here,\" he broke off suddenly--we were nearing the fowl-run now, Mrs. Ukridge walking in front with Phyllis Derrick--\"were you ever at Bristol?\"  \"Never, sir,\" said the professor.  \"Because I knew just such another fat little buffer there a few years ago. Gay old bird, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3829"],["title","Love Among the Chickens (#8)"],["body","was. He--\"  \"This is the fowl-run, professor,\" I broke in, with a moist, tingling feeling across my forehead and up my spine. I saw the professor stiffen as he walked, while his face deepened in colour. Ukridge's breezy way of expressing himself is apt to electrify the stranger.  \"You will notice the able way--ha! ha!--in which the wire-netting is arranged,\" I continued feverishly. \"Took some doing, that. By Jove, yes. It was hot work. Nice lot of fowls, aren't they? Rather a mixed lot, of course. Ha! ha! That's the dealer's fault though. We are getting quite a number of eggs now. Hens wouldn't lay at first. Couldn't make them.\"  I babbled on, till from the corner of my eye I saw the flush fade from the professor's face and his back gradually relax its poker-like attitude. The situation was saved for the moment but there was no knowing what further excesses Ukridge might indulge in. I managed to draw him aside as we went through the fowl-run, and expostulated.  \"For goodness sake, be careful,\" I whispered. \"You've no notion how touchy he is.\"  \"But _I_ said nothing,\" he replied, amazed.  \"Hang it, you know, nobody likes to be called a fat little buffer to his face.\"  \"What! My dear old man, nobody minds a little thing like that. We can't be stilted and formal. It's ever so much more friendly to relax and be chummy.\"  Here we rejoined the others, and I was left with a leaden foreboding of gruesome things in store. I knew what manner of man Ukridge was when he relaxed and became chummy. Friendships of years' standing had failed to survive the test.  For the time being, however, all went well. In his role of lecturer he offended no one, and Phyllis and her father behaved admirably. They received his strangest theories without a twitch of the mouth.  \"Ah,\" the professor would say, \"now is that really so? Very interesting indeed.\"  Only once, when Ukridge was describing some more than usually original device for the furthering of the interests of his fowls, did a slight spasm disturb Phyllis's look of attentive reverence.  \"And you have really had no previous experience in chicken-farming?\" she said.  \"None,\" said Ukridge, beaming through his glasses. \"Not an atom. But I can turn my hand to anything, you know. Things seem to come naturally to me somehow.\"  \"I see,\" said Phyllis.  It was while matters were progressing with this beautiful smoothness that I observed the square form of the Hired Retainer approaching us. Somehow--I cannot say why--I had a feeling that he came with bad news. Perhaps it was his air of quiet satisfaction which struck me as ominous.  \"Beg pardon, Mr. Ukridge, sir.\"  Ukridge was in the middle of a very eloquent excursus on the feeding of fowls, a subject on which he held views of his own as ingenious as they were novel. The interruption annoyed him.  \"Well, Beale,\" he said, \"what is it?\"  \"That there cat, sir, what came to-day.\"  \"Oh, Beale,\" cried Mrs. Ukridge in agitation, \"_what_ has happened?\"  \"Having something to say to the missis--\"  \"What has happened? Oh, Beale, don't say that Edwin has been hurt? Where is he? Oh, _poor_ Edwin!\"  \"Having something to say to the missis--\"  \"If Bob has bitten him I hope he had his nose _well_ scratched,\" said Mrs. Ukridge vindictively.  \"Having something to say to the missis,\" resumed the Hired Retainer tranquilly, \"I went into the kitchen ten minutes back. The cat was sitting on the mat.\"  Beale's narrative style closely resembled that of a certain book I had read in my infancy. I wish I could remember its title. It was a well-written book.  \"Yes, Beale, yes?\" said Mrs. Ukridge. \"Oh, do go on.\"  \"'Hullo, puss,' I says to him, 'and 'ow are _you_, sir?' 'Be careful,' says the missis. ''E's that timid,' she says, 'you wouldn't believe,' she says. ''E's only just settled down, as you may say,' she says. 'Ho, don't you fret,' I says to her, ''im and me understands each other. 'Im and me,' I says, 'is old friends. 'E's my dear old pal, Corporal Banks.' She grinned at that, ma'am, Corporal Banks being a man we'd 'ad many a 'earty laugh at in the old days. 'E was, in a manner of speaking, a joke between us.\"  \"Oh, do--go--on, Beale. What has happened to Edwin?\"  The Hired Retainer proceeded in calm, even tones.  \"We was talking there, ma'am, when Bob, what had followed me unknown, trotted in. When the cat ketched sight of 'im sniffing about, there was such a spitting and swearing as you never 'eard; and blowed,\" said Mr. Beale amusedly, \"blowed if the old cat didn't give one jump, and move in quick time up the chimney, where 'e now remains, paying no 'eed to the missis' attempts to get him down again.\"  Sensation, as they say in the reports.  \"But he'll be cooked,\" cried Phyllis, open-eyed.  \"No, he won't. Nor will our dinner. Mrs. Beale always lets the kitchen fire out during the afternoon. And how she's going to light it with that----\"  There was a pause while one might count three. It was plain that the speaker was struggling with himself.  \"--that cat,\" he concluded safely, \"up the chimney? It's a cold dinner we'll get to-night, if that cat doesn't come down.\"  The professor's face fell. I had remarked on the occasion when I had lunched with him his evident fondness for the pleasures of the table. Cold impromptu dinners were plainly not to his taste.  We went to the kitchen in a body. Mrs. Beale was standing in front of the empty grate, making seductive cat-noises up the chimney.  \"What's all this, Mrs. Beale?\" said Ukridge.  \"He won't come down, sir, not while he thinks Bob's about. And how I'm to cook dinner for five with him up the chimney I don't see, sir.\"  \"Prod at him with a broom handle, Mrs. Beale,\" said Ukridge.  \"Oh, don't hurt poor Edwin,\" said Mrs. Ukridge.  \"I 'ave tried that, sir, but I can't reach him, and I'm only bin and drove 'im further up. What must be,\" added Mrs. Beale philosophically, \"must be. He may come down of his own accord in the night. Bein' 'ungry.\"  \"Then what we must do,\" said Ukridge in a jovial manner, which to me at least seemed out of place, \"is to have a regular, jolly picnic-dinner, what? Whack up whatever we have in the larder, and eat that.\"  \"A regular, jolly picnic-dinner,\" repeated the professor gloomily. I could read what was passing in his mind,--remorse for having come at all, and a faint hope that it might not be too late to back out of it.  \"That will be splendid,\" said Phyllis.  \"Er, I think, my dear sir,\" said her father, \"it would be hardly fair for us to give any further trouble to Mrs. Ukridge and yourself. If you will allow me, therefore, I will----\"  Ukridge became gushingly hospitable. He refused to think of allowing his guests to go empty away. He would be able to whack up something, he said. There was quite a good deal of the ham left. He was sure. He appealed to me to endorse his view that there was a tin of sardines and part of a cold fowl and plenty of bread and cheese.  \"And after all,\" he said, speaking for the whole company in the generous, comprehensive way enthusiasts have, \"what more do we want in weather like this? A nice, light, cold, dinner is ever so much better for us than a lot of hot things.\"  We strolled out again into the garden, but somehow things seemed to drag. Conversation was fitful, except on the part of Ukridge, who continued to talk easily on all subjects, unconscious of the fact that the party was depressed and at least one of his guests rapidly becoming irritable. I watched the professor furtively as Ukridge talked on, and that ominous phrase of Mr. Chase's concerning four-point-seven guns kept coming into my mind. If Ukridge were to tread on any of his pet corns, as he might at any minute, there would be an explosion. The snatching of the dinner from his very mouth, as it were, and the substitution of a bread-and-cheese and sardines menu had brought him to the frame of mind when men turn and rend their nearest and dearest.  The sight of the table, when at length we filed into the dining room, sent a chill through me. It was a meal for the very young or the very hungry. The uncompromising coldness and solidity of the viands was enough to appall a man conscious that his digestion needed humouring. A huge cheese faced us in almost a swashbuckling way. I do not know how else to describe it. It wore a blatant, rakish, _nemo-me-impune-lacessit_ air, and I noticed that the professor shivered slightly as he saw it. Sardines, looking more oily and uninviting than anything I had ever seen, appeared in their native tin beyond the loaf of bread. There was a ham, in its third quarter, and a chicken which had suffered heavily during a previous visit to the table. Finally, a black bottle of whisky stood grimly beside Ukridge's plate. The professor looked the sort of man who drank claret of a special year, or nothing.  We got through the meal somehow, and did our best to delude ourselves into the idea that it was all great fun; but it was a shallow pretence. The professor was very silent by the time we had finished. Ukridge had been terrible. The professor had forced himself to be genial. He had tried to talk. He had told stories. And when he began one--his stories would have been the better for a little more briskness and condensation--Ukridge almost invariably interrupted him, before he had got half way through, without a word of apology, and started on some anecdote of his own. He furthermore disagreed with nearly every opinion the professor expressed. It is true that he did it all in such a perfectly friendly way, and was obviously so innocent of any intention of giving offence, that another man--or the same man at a better meal--might have overlooked the matter. But the professor, robbed of his good dinner, was at the stage when he had to attack somebody. Every moment I had been expecting the storm to burst.  It burst after dinner.  We were strolling in the garden, when some demon urged Ukridge, apropos of the professor's mention of Dublin, to start upon the Irish question."]]]
