When bent, heat it red once more and plunge quickly into water to re-temper it. Rubbing on an oil stone may be necessary to remove roughness. Should the handles show any tendency to split, it would be well to wrap the end tightly with waxed thread.  The forceps (_fig. 4_) may be purchased either of brass or steel at no great expense. Although not necessary it is more convenient to have them curved than straight.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]  If the reader will carefully follow the directions given below and endeavor to see for himself all the parts spoken of, he will probably have very little difficulty afterward in the use of the instruments just described; and the enjoyment he will have when he has learned how to examine little things, will amply repay for careful and persistent efforts at the start. Get a Dandelion in full bloom and also one that has gone to seed.  Have the microscope and the other instruments ready for use. The best place to work is on a table in front of a window where there is plenty of light, but not the direct rays of the sun.  Now cut the blossom in halves from the stem up. It will be seen that the stem is hollow and ends above in a cushion-like expansion. From the upper surface of this grow a number of little flowers, while from the sides there sprang two rows of little green organs that enclose the flower cluster like a cup. Remove one of the flowers with the forceps and place it in a drop of water on the glass stage of the microscope. Examine with one and one half inch power.[A]  Be careful to get just the focus. You are now ready to see the general form of the flower. At the base is a little body with roughened sides and slightly narrowed above (the ovary). Springing from the top of the ovary are a number of fine bristles (the pappus). Inside the bristles is a yellow portion, tubular below and flat above (the corolla). Projecting from the tube of the corolla is a little yellow rod (the top of the stamens joined together); and coming from among the stamens are two slender recurved organs (the stigmas).  Now take a mounted needle in each hand and holding one needle on the flat part of the corolla split open the tubular part with the other. By keeping the lower part spread open with the needles, you will see that a number of delicate yellow threads grow from the sides of the corolla and are connected with the yellow stamen rod. These threads are another part of the stamens. In the middle of the flower is a single thread-like organ (the style) which comes from the top of the ovary and passing through the stamens projects beyond them, divided into two stigmas.  Most of my readers have probably studied enough botany to know the names of the different parts of a flower, but very likely many of them do not recognize the parts of the Dandelion flower as looking anything like the parts of the flower with which they are familiar.  Before proceeding further, therefore let us take a Morning-Glory flower--which you all know and can easily obtain, or at least some flower like it--and let us see that the parts of the two correspond.  Commencing in the centre we find in both a pistil, consisting of an ovary at the base and a stigma at the top and a style between. In the Dandelion the stigma is split in halves, while in the morning-glory it is not split but has three little knobs. Around the pistil come the stamens in each case. Each stamen is composed of two parts: a slender stem (the filament) and a little sac at the end (the anther) which is filled with pollen dust. In both cases the filaments grow out of the sides of the corolla. But while in the Morning-Glory the anthers are entirely free from one another, in the Dandelion they are joined together by their sides and form a tube around the style. The corolla in both cases is all of one piece, but in the Dandelion it is as if the upper part of the corolla were split open one side and then made flat. Instead of a green calyx as in the Morning-Glory, the Dandelion has a number of delicate white bristles. And, finally, in the Morning-Glory both the calyx and corolla grow out from below the ovary, while in the Dandelion its calyx of bristles and its corolla issue from above the ovary. So after all, you will see that corresponding organs are in both, and the difference between the two flowers is not so great as one might think at first.  Let the different parts of the Dandelion be examined now more minutely. First take some of the bristles and examine them with one quarter inch power. They are not perfectly smooth, but are more or less saw-like on the edge. With the same power look at other parts of the flower; notice the hairiness of the stigmas, the pollen grains coming out of the anthers (some grains may be found on the stigmas) also the roughness of the ovary and the delicate ribs or veins in the corolla. Examine one of the seed-like fruits with one and one half inch power. It is a ripened ovary. Compare the fruit with the ovary of a flower. The nutlet has become hard, rougher and more strongly ribbed. The narrowed upper part of the ovary has become much elongated and the pappus is spread out like an inverted umbrella.  Examine some bristles with one quarter inch power. They show the saw-like edges much more developed than in the younger bristles of the flower. We see throughout a beautiful adaptation of every part for fitting the little parachute to be carried long distances by the wind and finally to catch on some suitable place in which to sprout.   XIV.--HOW TO SEE A BUMBLE BEE.  You will first need to catch your Bumble Bee. A little chloroform poured on one will kill it instantly. Make a general examination at the outset of the insect. The outside of the body is horny and covered thickly with hairs. On the upper side the hairs are much more numerous than on the under side. The whole body is divided into three regions: the head, bearing the feelers and mouth-parts; a middle part (thorax) bearing the four wings and six legs; and a hind part (abdomen) armed with the sting.  Remove the head and examine with one and one half inch power. At the sides are two prominent oval bodies (compound eyes) which seem to be crossed by five lines; near the top of the head, between the compound eyes, are three little shiny bead-like organs (simple eyes); starting from about the middle of the face are the two feelers (antennæ) and at the lower part of the head are the mouth-parts. The sides, top and front of the head are all covered with hair.  Examine one of the compound eyes with one fourth inch power. The surface is made up of innumerable little facets, something like a cut diamond.  Cut off a piece of one of the compound eyes, remove some of the black pigment on the back and examine the piece in a drop of water. Each facet is a tiny hexagon. Some care is necessary to see them well.  Remove an antenna and examine it with three fourths inch power. It is thickly covered with minute hairs which give it a velvety appearance. Count the joints. At the base is the longest joint; at the lower end of which is a little knob that fits into a socket in the head. The next joint is quite small while those beyond are much alike.  Scrape the hairs from the face and examine the horny shell with three fourths inch power. The surface is full of little pits. In the upper part of the face there is a groove, in the middle of which is one of the simple eyes. Just below the antennæ sockets is a groove which extends crosswise a short distance on either side and then bends downwards to the mouth. The portion of the face bounded by this groove is called the clypeus. At its lower part is hinged a little oblong piece (labium) which may be moved up and down with a needle.  Melt a piece of sealing wax on the centre of a slip of glass (taking care not to break the glass by too sudden heating) and before the wax hardens press the head into it face downwards.  Examine with one inch power. The hole near the top of the head shows the position of the neck. The portion of the head around this hole is destitute of hairs and is hollowed in, to make room for the rounded front part of the thorax. Below this one there is another cavity which contains a portion of the mouth parts when they are retracted. At each side of the mouth in front of the base of the sucking organs, are the two jaws (mandibles) each with a little tuft of hair on the outer side. The jaws move freely to and from each other, sideways instead of up and down as do the jaws of the higher animals. The sucking apparatus consists of five pieces viz: two outermost pieces each tapering to a fine point, two, each of which ends in three little joints and one in the centre which projects beyond the others. It may be necessary to spread these out with the needle, to see them well.  Separate the thorax from the rest of the body. Scrape off the hairs on the back. Two principal grooves extend across the back, one near the front and one near the hind margin. The thorax is composed of three divisions and these grooves show where they are joined together. The hind division bears the hind wings and the hind pair of legs; the middle division, much the largest division of the three, bears the fore wings and the middle pair of legs; and the foremost division is quite small and bears only the front pair of legs.  Remove the wings of one side and examine in a drop of water with one and one half inch power. The wings consist of a shining transparent membrane strengthened by numerous horny veins running through it. Examine with one half inch power. The membrane is seen to be covered with minute hairs and little dots. On the front edge of the hind wing a short distance from the outer end is a row of hooks. At a corresponding place on the hind edge of the fore wing there is a thickening or ridge. When flying, the hooks catch onto the ridge and thus the wings are held together and act as one large wing.

Before World War II the isthmus could be reached readily only by railroad or by ocean vessel to Salina Cruz or Coatzacoalcos. With the advent of roads, principally the Trans-isthmian Highway, vast areas of the interior of the isthmus became accessible to biologists. Nevertheless, long before roads were built in the isthmian region collectors and biologists visited it, especially the town of Tehuantepec, from which collections date back to the 1870's. Therefore, it is rather surprising that no attempt has been made to present a faunal list of the amphibians or reptiles of the isthmus. Ruthven (1912) summarized his collections from the vicinity of Cuatotolapam, Veracruz, and Hartweg and Oliver (1940) presented an annotated list of the species collected by them in the vicinity of Tehuantepec. In recent years there have been only a few papers reporting species from the isthmus (Fugler and Webb, 1957; Langebartel and Smith, 1959). The zoogeographic significance of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec is exemplified by the works of Burt (1931), Duellman (1958), Gloyd (1940), Oliver (1948), and Stuart (1941), who in their discussions of evolution and dispersal of various genera of reptiles, pointed out that the Isthmus of Tehuantepec was a region of zoogeographic importance.  Originally I intended to study the entire herpetofauna of the isthmus. But I have not had opportunity to study all of the reptiles, and I have not had the inclination to solve certain taxonomic problems concerning them. The amphibians that I collected, together with all other known specimens in museums, have been studied. Therefore, the present report is concerned only with the amphibians. Only the amphibians of the lowlands of the isthmus have been sampled adequately. Although I have commented on the highland species in the discussion of distribution, they are not included in the systematic section, which deals solely with the 36 species definitely known to occur in the lowlands of the isthmus.  Among the species of amphibians that I would expect to occur in the isthmus, the only one not yet found there is _Hyla phaeota_. Sufficient specimens of most of the species are available to show their variation in the isthmus. Consequently, the systematics of these amphibians is on a fairly substantial basis. Probably certain species in the isthmian region will be found to be conspecific with others to the south, for example _Hyla ebraccata_ with _Hyla leucophyllata_ and _Hyla robertmertensi_ with _Hyla underwoodi_. Nevertheless, such taxonomic changes will not affect the distributional picture presented here. Our greatest lack of knowledge concerning the amphibians is about their life histories, as may be illustrated by the following questions, all of which now are without definite answers. Where do many of the small frogs conceal themselves during the dry season? What amount of, if any, interspecific competition exists among several species of tree frogs, all of which breed in the same ponds? What factors in the environment permit certain amphibians, but not others, to live in the humid rainforests, as well as in the arid tropical scrub forest? The answers to these questions and many others must await additional field studies.  The purpose of this paper is to make known the species of amphibians living in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, to describe the environments in which they live, and to discuss their distribution in the isthmus. With respect to the distribution of animals in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec I will attempt to explain the present patterns of distribution with special reference to climatic fluctuation in the Pleistocene.   _Acknowledgments_  My extensive field work in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec was made possible by grants from the Penrose Fund of the American Philosophical Society (1956) and the Bache Fund of the National Academy of Sciences (1958). Furthermore, my field work received the hearty support of the Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan; for their cooperation I am indebted to Norman Hartweg, T. H. Hubbell, and Henry van der Schalie. In the course of my studies I received helpful suggestions from Norman Hartweg, L. C. Stuart, and Charles F. Walker, to whom I am grateful. For permission to examine specimens in their care I thank Doris M. Cochran, Hobart M. Smith, and Richard G. Zweifel. I am deeply indebted to Thomas MacDougall for many suggestions and for aid in preparing the gazetteer. I am most grateful for the efforts of my field companions, Richard E. Etheridge, Jerome B. Tulecke, John Wellman, and especially my wife, Ann S. Duellman, who spent many long days and nights gathering much of the data on which this report is based. Our work in the isthmus was furthered by the generous help and hospitality of many residents, especially the late Wilbur Barker of Tehuantepec, Fortunado Delgado of Rancho Las Hojitas near Acayucan, César Fárjas of Donají, and Juan Mayol of San Andrés Tuxtla. Profesor Jordi Juliá Z. of the Laboratorio de Entomología, Comisión del Papaloapan, Ciudad Alemán, Veracruz, helped make possible my field work in 1959; for this he has my sincere thanks. In conclusion I express my gratitude to Ing. Juan Lozano Franco, Secretaria de Agricultura y Ganadería, for providing me with the necessary permits.   _Field Studies in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec_  I first visited the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and collected on the Pacific lowlands of the isthmus in July, 1955. At that time heavy rains and impassable roads restricted travelling. In February and March of 1956 my wife and I concentrated our efforts in the central region between the Río Jaltepec and Matías Romero, but also made several trips across the isthmus to gather ecological data in the dry season. In July of the same year, accompanied by Richard E. Etheridge, we again crossed the isthmus several times in order to gather ecological data in the wet season, and studied especially hylid frogs, most of which had not been seen in the dry season. Accompanied by Jerome B. Tulecke and John Wellman, I collected again in the isthmus in July, 1958, between Salina Cruz and Tehuantepec, and between Coatzacoalcos and Cosoleacaque. In March and April, 1959, I collected at Ciudad Alemán. Nearly 1200 specimens of 30 species of amphibians were thus collected in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; all specimens are now in the Museum of Zoology at the University of Michigan. Of other species known from the isthmus, I have had field experience with all but one (_Bolitoglossa veracrucis_) in other parts of México.   _Sources of Material_  There are in museum collections nearly 3000 specimens of amphibians with reliable data from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Among the first herpetological specimens collected in the isthmian region are those assembled by Francis Sumichrast in the 1870's from the vicinity of Santa Efigenia and Tapanatepec, Oaxaca. These specimens were sent to the United States National Museum and the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris; many served as the types of new species: _Bufo canaliferus_ Cope, _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_ Cope, _Syrrhophus leprus_ Cope, and _Hylella sumichrasti_ Brocchi. In 1911 Alexander G. Ruthven collected in the savanna country near Cuatotolapam, Veracruz; the report on his"]]]
