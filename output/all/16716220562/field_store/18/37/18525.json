They need not be removed from the order, but, in this respect, recognized as more primitive than any other existing Urodela or Anura. A recent paper by Hecht (1957) discusses many features of _Necturus_ and _Proteus_, and shows that they are remote from each other; his evidence does not seem to prove, however, that they were of independent origin or that they need be placed in separate families.     VERTEBRAE AND RIBS   Development of the vertebrae and ribs of Recent Amphibia has been studied by Gamble (1922), Naef (1929), Mookerjee (1930 a, b), Gray (1930) and Emelianov (1936), among others. MacBride (1932) and Remane (1938) provide good summaries. In this section reference will be made to the embryonic vertebral cartilages by the names used for them in these studies, although the concept of \"arcualia\" is currently considered of little value in comparative anatomy.  [Illustration: Fig. 5. Development of Anuran vertebrae. Upper left, late tadpole of _Xenopus laevis_; lower left, same just after metamorphosis; upper right, diagram of general components of primitive Anuran vertebra. (After MacBride, 1932, Figs. 35, 38, 47D, respectively.) Lower right, section through anterior portion of urostyle, immediately posterior to sacral vertebra, in transforming _Ascaphus truei_ (original, from specimen collected on Olympic Peninsula, Washington). All × 20 approx. For explanation of abbreviations see Fig. 3.]  The centrum in Anura (Fig. 5) is formed in the perichordal sheath (_Rana_, _Bufo_) or only in the dorsal portion thereof (_Bombinator_, _Xenopus_). The neural arch develops from the basidorsal cartilages that rest upon, and at first are entirely distinct from, the perichordal sheath. Ribs, present as separate cartilages associated with the 2nd, 3rd and 4th vertebrae in the larvae of _Xenopus_ and _Bombinator_, fuse with lateral processes (diapophyses) of the neural arches at metamorphosis, but in _Leiopelma_ and _Ascaphus_ the ribs remain freely articulated in the adult. Basiventral arcualia have been supposed to be represented by the hypochord, a median rod of cartilage beneath the shrinking notochord in the postsacral region, which at metamorphosis ossifies to produce the bulk of the urostyle. Fig. 5, lower right, a transverse section taken immediately posterior to the sacral ribs in a transforming specimen of _Ascaphus_, shows that the \"hypochord\" is a mass of cartilage formed in the perichordal sheath itself, and very obviously is derived from the ventral part of postsacral perichordal centra; there are, then, no basiventral arcualia, and the discrete hypochord shown in MacBride's diagram (Fig. 5, upper right) of a frog vertebra does not actually occur below the centrum, but only below the notochord in the postsacral region.  [Illustration: Fig. 6. Development of Urodele vertebrae. Upper figures, _Triton_: at left, larva at 20 mm., at right, diagram of components of vertebra (from MacBride, 1932, figs. 17, 47C).

For explanation of abbreviations see Fig. 3.]  In Urodela (Fig. 6) the pattern of vertebral and rib development is more complex, and there has been much controversy over its interpretation. Neural arches and perichordal centra form in the same manner as in frogs, but with the addition in certain cases (_Triton_) of a median supradorsal cartilage, which gives rise to the zygapophyses of each neural arch. Difficulty comes, however, in understanding the relationship of the ribs to the vertebrae. Each rib, usually two-headed, articulates with a \"transverse process\" that in its early development seems to be separate from both the vertebra and the rib, and is therefore known, noncommittally, as \"rib-bearer.\" This lies laterally from the centrum, neural arch, and vertebral artery; upon fusing with the vertebra it therefore encloses the artery in a foramen separate from the one between the capitulum and tuberculum of the rib (the usual location of the vertebral artery). At least four different interpretations of these structures have been suggested:  (1) Naef (1929) considered the rib-bearer a derivative of the basiventral, which, by spreading laterally and dorsally to meet the neural arch, enclosed the vertebral artery. He then supposed that by reduction of the rib-bearer in other tetrapods (frogs and amniotes) the vertebrarterial foramen and costal foramen were brought together in a single foramen transversarium. The implication is that the Urodele condition is primitive, but it cannot now be supposed that Urodela are ancestral to any other group, and the rib-bearer is most probably a specialization limited to salamanders. This does not, of course, invalidate the first part of his interpretation.  (2) Remane (1938), noting that rib insertions of early Amphibia are essentially as in Amniota, argued that the rib-bearer is not from the basiventral but is a neomorph which originates directly from the neural arch and grows ventrally. This he inferred mainly from Gamble's (1922) observation on _Necturus_, but his assumption that _Necturus_ is more primitive than other salamanders (such as the Salamandridae), where the pattern differs from this, is not necessarily correct. Rather, the perennibranchs are distinguished mainly by their neotenous features, and their development is likely to show simplifications which are not necessarily primitive. The suggestion of a \"neomorph\" ought not to be made except as a last resort, for it is simply an acknowledgment that the author does not recognize homology with any structure already known; sometimes further information will make such recognition possible.  (3) Gray (1930), using _Molge taeniatus_, concluded that the normal capitulum of the rib was lost, but that the tuberculum bifurcated to make the two heads seen in Urodela, thus accounting for the failure of the costal foramen to coincide with that of the vertebral artery. This answer, too, seems to entail an unprovable assumption which should not be made without explicit evidence.  (4) Finally, Emelianov (1936) regarded the rib-bearer as a rudimentary _ventral_ rib, on account of its relationship to the vertebral artery, and considered the actual rib to be a neomorph in the _dorsal_ position characteristic of tetrapod ribs in general. This argument would fit the ontogenetic picture satisfactorily, provided that (_a_) there were some evidence of ventral, rather than dorsal, ribs in early Amphibia, and (_b_) we accept the invention of another neomorph in modern Amphibia as an unavoidable necessity. Emelianov's conclusion (p. 258) should be quoted here (translation): \"The ribs of Urodela are shown to be upper ribs, yet we find besides these in Urodela rudimentary lower ribs fused with the vertebral column. The ribs of Apoda are lower ribs. In Anura ribs fail to develop fully, but as rare exceptions rudiments of upper ribs appear.\"  Of these various interpretations, that of Naef seems to involve the minimum of novelty, namely, that the rib-bearer is the basiventral, expanded and external to the vertebral artery. It is not necessary to take this modification as the ancestral condition in tetrapods, of course. The basiventral (=intercentrum) would merely have expanded sufficiently to provide a diapophysis for the tuberculum as well as the (primitive) facet for the capitulum. No neomorph appears under this hypothesis, which has the distinct advantage of simplicity.  Figures of early stages in vertebral development by the authors mentioned show that the basidorsals chondrify first, as neural arches, while a separate mass of mesenchyme lies externally and ventrally from these. This mesenchyme may chondrify either in one piece (on each side) or in two; in _Molge_ the part adjacent to the centrum is ossified in the 20-mm. larva, and subsequently unites with the more dorsal and lateral cartilaginous part, while the rib, appearing farther out, grows inward to meet this composite \"rib-bearer.\" In _Necturus_ the mesenchyme below the neural arch differentiates into a cartilage below the vertebral artery (position proper to a basiventral), a bridge between this and the neural arch, and a rib, the latter two chondrifying later than the \"basiventral\" proper. In the \"axolotl\" (presumably _Ambystoma tigrinum_) the rib-bearer grows downward from its first center of chondrification at the side of the neural arch (Emelianov, 1936).  Thus it appears that the simplest hypothesis to account for the rib-bearer is that (_a_) it is the basiventral, (_b_) it is recognizable just before chondrification as a mass of mesenchyme in contact with both the notochordal sheath and the basidorsal cartilage, (_c_) it may chondrify or ossify first in its ventral portion or in its dorsal portion, the two then joining before it fuses with the rest of the vertebra, (_d_) the enclosure of the vertebral artery is a consequence of the extension of the basiventral beyond the position occupied by it in primitive Amphibia, and (_e_) there is no indication that this took place in other orders than the Urodela.  It seems that the vertebrae in Urodela have at least the following components: perichordal centra, separate basidorsal cartilages, and basiventrals, which are somewhat specialized in their manner of development. The vertebrae of Anura develop in the fashion just described except that basiventrals are lacking. It would seem no more difficult to accept the derivation of salamander vertebrae from the temnospondylous type than it is in the case of frogs, if other evidence points to such an ancestry.  [Illustration: Fig. 7. Vertebrae of _Eusthenopteron_ (×1) and _Ichthyostega_ (×2/3, after Jarvik, 1952), _Trimerorhachis_ (×1-1/2,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37350"],["title","The Ancestry of Modern Amphibia: A Review of the Evidence (#3)"],["body","Case), and _Amphibamus_ (×10, after Watson, 1940) in lateral and end views; the two lower right-hand figures are from Watson (1940, as _Miobatrachus_); the lower left is from a cast of the \"_Miobatrachus_\" specimen in Chicago Natural History Museum, No. 2000, in the presacral region (original, ×10).]  Fig. 7, lower right, is Watson's (1940) illustration of the anterior trunk vertebrae of _Amphibamus_ (_Miobatrachus_), in which the intercentrum is shown as a single median piece. Fig. 7, lower left, shows two of the more posterior trunk vertebrae seen as impressions in a cast of the type of \"_Miobatrachus romeri_;\" evidently the inter-centra were paired at about the level of the 16th vertebra, and relatively large. Gregory's (1950) figure of the type specimen of \"_Mazonerpeton_\" (also equivalent to _Amphibamus_) shows the anterior trunk vertebrae in relation to the ribs essentially as they appear to me in the cast of _Miobatrachus_, and rather differently from Watson's figure of the latter. Gregory is probably right in considering the specimens to represent various degrees of immaturity. So far as present information goes, then, the vertebrae of salamanders and frogs show no _clear_ evidence of derivation from those of any particular group among the early Amphibia, but their features are not inconsistent with a simplification of the pattern of Temnospondyli.  [Illustration: Fig. 8. Pectoral girdles of _Protobatrachus_ (after Piveteau, 1937), _Notobatrachus_ (after Stipanicic and Reig, 1956), Ascaphus (after Ritland, 1955 a) and _Rana_ (original); all ×2. For explanation of abbreviations see Fig. 3.]     PECTORAL GIRDLE   Hecht and Ruibal (Copeia, 1928:242) make a strong point of the nature of the pectoral girdle in _Notobatrachus_, as described recently by Stipanicic and Reig (1955, 1956) from the Jurassic of Patagonia, and quite rightly recommend that the significance of the arciferal and firmisternal types of girdle be restudied. That of _Notobatrachus_ is said to be firmisternal; in view of the arciferal condition in the supposedly primitive _Leiopelma_, _Ascaphus_, _Bombinator_, etc., this comes as a surprise. Is the firmisternal girdle, as seen in _Rana_, _Bufo_, and others, actually the ancestral type, and has the arciferal been derived from something like this?  In the figures given by Stipanicic and Reig the ossified parts of the girdle are figured in detail (Fig. 8) and Reig's discussion of it is thorough. The decision to call it firmisternal was taken with some hesitancy, for no median elements are indicated, and the position and shape of those seen is closely similar to the ossified parts in _Ascaphus_ and _Leiopelma_; there is no bony sternum or omosternum. It is safe to suppose that some cartilage lay in the midline between the clavicles and coracoids, but there is no evidence as to its extent, rigidity, or degree of overlapping if any. Apparently, then, there is not sufficient reason to infer that this Jurassic frog had a pectoral girdle comparable with the modern firmisternal type.  Piveteau (1955:261) remarks that the only living Anuran that can be compared usefully with _Protobatrachus_ (Triassic) with regard to its pectoral girdle is _Ascaphus_. Again, the extent of cartilage in _Protobatrachus_ (Fig. 8) can only be inferred, and there are no median elements. The agreement with _Ascaphus_ includes the presence, in both, of a separate coracoid ossification situated posterior to the ossified \"scapulocoracoid\" (actually scapula). This ossification is evidently that shown in _Notobatrachus_ as \"coracoid.\" Direct comparison of the three genera with one another suggests that if we use the term arciferal for any, we should use it for all.  In the remote predecessor of Anura, _Amphibamus_ of the Pennsylvanian, the pectoral girdle was less substantial than in many of its contemporaries, but it contained the primitive median interclavicle in addition to the clavicle, cleithrum, and scapulocoracoid. (The figure of Watson, 1940, and that by Gregory, 1950, are of individuals of different ages, the latter being older.) It is clear that the paired elements of such a girdle were held rigid by their attachment to the interclavicle, _via_ the clavicles. Subsequent elimination of the interclavicle in the Anuran line of descent, and decrease of ossification, left a girdle like that of _Protobatrachus_, _Notobatrachus_, _Ascaphus_ and _Leiopelma_. But in several advanced families a more rigid median \"sternum,\" of one or two bony pieces plus cartilage, is developed secondarily, possibly (as Cope, 1889: 247, suggested) in correlation with axillary amplexus.  Among Urodela no dermal bones occur in the pectoral girdle. There is usually a scapulocoracoid ossified as a single piece, from which a thin cartilaginous suprascapula extends dorsally and a broad cartilaginous coracoid plate extends medially, overlapping the one from the opposite side; a precoracoid lobe of this reaches forward on either side, and a median, posterior \"sternum\" of cartilage may make contact with the edges of the two coracoids. In _Siren_ and _Amphiuma_ two centers of ossification are found for each scapulocoracoid, and in _Triton_ and _Salamandra_ three. Probably the more dorsal and lateral of these represents the primitive scapula and the other one (or two) the primitive coracoid.  Comparing the girdle of a salamander with that of a frog, the closest similarity can be seen between _Ascaphus_ and a salamander in which the scapula and coracoid ossify separately. Both have the median \"sternum\" in contact with the coracoid plates. The major difference, of course, is the lack of clavicle and cleithrum in the salamander.     CARPUS AND TARSUS   In _Ascaphus_ (Ritland, 1955a; cleared and stained specimens of nearly grown males) distal carpals 1, 2, 3 and 4 are present and separate, increasing in size in the order given (Fig. 9). A prepollex rests against centrale 1; centralia 2 and 3 are fused; the radiale fuses with centrale 4, and the intermedium fuses with the ulnare; radius and ulna are fused with each other as in other frogs. The digits (and metacarpals) are considered by Ritland to be 1-4, in addition to the prepollex, rather than 2-5.  [Illustration: Fig. 9. Skeleton of fore foot of _Notobatrachus_ (after Stipanicic and Reig, 1956, terminology revised) and _Ascaphus_ (after Ritland, 1955 a); all ×5. For explanation of abbreviations see Fig. 3.]  In the Jurassic _Notobatrachus_ Stipanicic and Reig (1956) have shown the carpus with surprising clarity (Fig. 9). If their nomenclature of the parts be revised, we obtain a fairly close resemblance to _Ascaphus_, except that centralia 2 and 3 are not fused, distal carpals 1 and 2 do not show (which would easily be understood if they were of the size of those in _Ascaphus_, or not ossified), and the intermedium remains separate from the ulnare.  In _Salamandra_ (Francis, 1934; Nauck, 1938) distal carpals 1 and 2 are fused in both larva and adult, and 3 and 4 are separate; the radiale, intermedium and ulnare are separate in the larva but the latter two fuse in the adult; centrale 1 (labelled prepollical cartilage by Francis) and centrale 2 are separate. Francis considers the digits (and metacarpals) to be 1-4. Apparently the arrangement here indicated for the larva is characteristic of other larval salamanders, except where further reduced, and reduction below the number given for the adult is common in other terrestrial forms. The radius and ulna are, of course, separate.  The ossification of carpals is more likely to be complete in adult frogs than in salamanders, but some ossification of all parts named is found in several of the latter. A common ancestor of frogs and salamanders could be expected to have the following elements present and ossified in the adult: distal carpals 1-4 separate; 3 centralia; radiale, intermedium and ulnare separate. Comparison with fossils older than _Notobatrachus_ is fruitless on these points, unless we go back to forms too distant to have any special value, such as _Eryops_. This is because of inadequate preservation and because the elements are not fully ossified in many immature specimens.  For the purpose of this review there is no special value in a comparison of the tarsi of frogs and salamanders, since the leaping adaptation of the former leaves very little common pattern between them. Even in _Protobatrachus_, where the legs were not yet conspicuously lengthened, the tibiale and fibulare (\"astragalus\" and \"calcaneum\" respectively) were already considerably elongated. The carpus and tarsus of _Amphibamus_ are as yet undecipherable.     THE LARVA   Considering the postembryonic developmental stages of modern Amphibia, there can be no doubt that a gill-bearing, four-legged larva of a salamander, in which lateral line pores and a gular fold are present, represents much more closely the type of larva found in labyrinthodonts than does the limbless, plant-nibbling tadpole of the Anura. Salamander-like larvae of labyrinthodonts are well known, especially those formerly supposed to comprise the order Branchiosauria. Many, perhaps the majority of, labyrinthodonts show some features associated with aquatic life even when full-grown, as do the lepospondyls. These features may include impressions of sensory canals on the dermal bones of the skull, persistence of visceral arches, reduction in size of appendages, and failure of tarsal and carpal elements to ossify. In fact, it appears that very few of the Paleozoic Amphibia were successful in establishing themselves as terrestrial animals even as adults.  Nevertheless, in the ancestry of Anura, and that of at least the Hynobiid, Ambystomid, Salamandrid and Plethodontid salamanders, there must certainly have been a terrestrial adult, transforming from an aquatic larva. The leaping mechanism of Anura, shown in so many features of their anatomy, is perhaps to be explained as a device for sudden escape from land into the"]]]
