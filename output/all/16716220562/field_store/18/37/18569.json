Thus the metaphysical definition of Beauty must set forth what this end of Beauty is,--what it serves in the universe.  But to determine what anything does, or fulfills, or exemplifies, is not the same as to determine what it is in itself.  The most that can be said is that the end, or function, shapes the means or constitution.  The end is a logical imperative.  Beauty does, and must do, such things.  To ask how, is at once to indicate an ultimate departure from the philosophical point of view; for the means to an end are different, and to be empirically determined.  Now the constitution of Beauty can be only the means to the end of Beauty,--that combination of qualities in the object which will bring about the end fixed by philosophical definition. The end is general; the means may be different kinds.  Evidently, then, the philosophical definition cannot be applied directly to the object until the possibilities, conditions, and limitations of that object's fitness for the purpose assigned are known.  We cannot ask, Does the Sistine Madonna express the Idea of Sense? until we know all possibilities and conditions of the visual for attaining that expression.  But, indeed, the consideration of causes and effects suggests at once that natural science must guide further investigation.  Philosophy must lay down what Beauty has to do, but since it is in our experience of Beauty that its end is accomplished, since the analysis of such experience and the study of its contributing elements is a work of the natural science of such experience--it would follow that psychology must deal with the various means through which this end is to be reached.  Thus we see that Fechner's reproach is unjustified.  Those concepts which are too general to apply to particular cases are not meant to do so.  If a general concept expresses, as it should, the place of Beauty in the hierarchy of metaphysical values, it is for the psychologist of aesthetics to develop the means by which that end can be reached in the various realms in which works of art are found.  Nor can we agree with Santayana's dictum<1> that philosophical aesthetics confuses the import of an experience with the explanation of its cause.  It need not.  The aesthetic experience is indeed caused by the beautiful object, but the beautiful object itself is caused by the possibility of the aesthetic experience,-- beauty as an end under the conditions of human perception.  Thus the Nature of Beauty is related to its import, or meaning, or end, as means to that end; and therefore the import of an experience may well point out to us the constitution of the cause of that experience.  A work of art, a piece of nature, is judged by its degree of attainment to that end; the explanation of its beauty--of its degree of attainment, that is--is found in the effect of its elements, according to psychological laws, on the aesthetic subject.  <1> The Sense of Beauty, 1898. Intro.  Such a psychological study of the means by which the end of Beauty is attained is the only method by which we can come to an explanation of the wealth of concrete beauty.  The concept of explanation, indeed, is valid only within the realm of causes and effects.  The aim of aesthetics being conceded, as above, to be the determination of the Nature of Beauty and the explanation of our feelings about it, it is evident at this point that the Nature of Beauty must be determined by philosophy; but the general definition having been fixed, the meaning of the work of art having been made clear, the only possible explanation of our feelings about it--the aesthetic experience, in other words--must be gained from psychology.  This method is not open to the logical objections against the preceding.  No longer need we ask what has a right to be included in the aesthetic experience. That has been fixed by the definition of Beauty.  But how the beautiful object brings about the aesthetic experience, the boundaries of which are already known, is clearly matter for psychology.  The first step must then be to win the philosophical definition of Beauty.  It was Kant, says Hegel, who spoke the first rational word concerning Beauty.  The study of his successors will reveal, I believe, that the aesthetic of the great system of idealism forms, on the whole, one identical doctrine.  It is worth while to dwell somewhat on this point, because the traditional view of the relation of the aesthetic of Kant, Schiller, Schelling, and Hegel is otherwise.  Kant's starting-point was the discovery of the normative, \"over-individual\" nature of Beauty, which we have just found to be the secret of the contradictions of empirical aesthetics.  Yet he came to it at the bidding of quite other motives.  Kant's aesthetics was meant to serve as the keystone of the arch between sense and reason.  The discovery of all that is implicit in the experience of the senses had led him to deny the possibility of knowledge beyond the matter of this experience. Yet the reason has an inevitable tendency to press beyond this limit, to seek all-embracing, absolute unities,--to conceive an unconditioned totality.  Thus the reason presents us with the ideas--beyond all possibility of knowledge--of the Soul, the World, and God.  In the words of Kant, the Ideas of Reason lead the understanding to the consideration of Nature according to a principle of completeness, although it can never attain to this.  Can there be a bridge across this abyss between sense and reason? then asks Kant; which bridge he believes himself to have found in the aesthetic faculty.  For on inquiring what is involved in the judgment, \"This is beautiful,\" he discovers that such a judgment is \"universal\" and \"necessary,\" inasmuch as it implies that every normal spectator must acknowledge its validity, that it is \"disinterested\" because it rests on the \"appearance of the object without demanding its actual existence,\" and that it is \"immediate\" or \"free,\" as it acknowledges the object as beautiful without definite purpose, as of adaptation to use.  But how does this judgment constitute the desired bond between sense and reason?  Simply in that, though applied to an object of the senses, it has yet all the marks of the Idea of Reason,--it is universal, necessary, free, unconditioned; it is judged as if it were perfect, and so fulfills those demands of reason which elsewhere in the world of sense are unsatisfied.  The two important factors, then, of Kant's aesthetics are its reconciliation of sense and reason in beauty, and its reference of the \"purposiveness\" of beauty to the cognitive faculty.  Schiller has been given the credit of transcending Kant's \"subjective\" aesthetic through his emphasis on the significance of the beautiful object.  It is not bound by a conception to which it must attain, so that it is perceived as if it were free.  Nor do we desire the reality of it to use for ourselves or for others; so that we are free in relation to it.  It, the object, is thus \"the vindication of freedom in the world of phenomena,\" that world which is otherwise a binding necessity. But it would seem that this had been already taught by Kant himself, and that Schiller has but enlivened the subject by his two illuminating phrases, \"aesthetic semblance\" and the \"play-impulse,\" to denote the real object of the aesthetic desire and the true nature of that desire; form instead of material existence, and a free attitude instead of serious purpose.  Still, his insistence on Beauty as the realization of freedom may be said to have paved the way for Schelling's theory, in which the aesthetic reaches its maximum of importance.  The central thought of the Absolute Idealism of Schelling is the underlying identity of Nature and the Self.  In Nature, from matter up to the organism, the objective factor predominates, or, in Schelling's phrase, the conscious self is determined by the unconscious.  In morality, science, the subjective factor predominates, or the unconscious is determined by the conscious.  But the work of art is a natural appearance and so unconscious, and is yet the product of a conscious activity.  It gives, then, the equilibrium of the real and ideal factors,--just that repose of reconciliation or \"indifference\" which alone can show the Absolute.  But-- and this is of immense importance for our theory--in order to explain the identity of subject and object, the Ego must have an intuition, through which, in one and the same appearance, it is in itself at once conscious and unconscious, and this condition is given in the aesthetic experience.  The beautiful is thus the solution of the riddle of the universe, for it is the possibility of the explicit consciousness of the unity of Nature and the Self--or the Absolute.  So Beauty is again the pivot on which a system turns.  Its place is not essentially different from that which it held in the systems of Kant and Schiller.  As the objective possibility for the bridge between sense and reason, as the vindication of freedom in the phenomenal world, and as vindication of the possible unity of the real and the ideal, or nature and self, the world-elements, its philosophical significance is nearly the same.  With Hegel Beauty loses little of its commanding position. The universe is in its nature rational; Thought and Being are one.  The world-process is a logical process; and nature and history, in which spirit of the world realizes itself, are but applied logic.  The completely fulfilled or expressed Truth is then the concrete world-system; at the same time the life or self of the universe; the Absolute.  This Hegel calls the Idea, and he defines Beauty as the expression of the Idea to sense.  This definition would seem to be as to the letter in accord with the general tendency as have already outlined.  It might be said that it is but another phrasing of Schelling's thought of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3751"],["title","The Psychology of Beauty (#6)"],["body","Absolute as presented to the Ego in Beauty.  But not so.  For Schelling, the aesthetic is a schema or form,--that is, the form of balance, equilibrium, reconciliation of the rational ideal,--not a content.  But Hegel's Beauty expresses the Idea by the way of information or association.  That this is true any one of his traditional examples makes evident. Correggio's Madonna of the St. Sebastian is found by him inferior to the Sistine Madonna.  Why?  \"In the first picture we have the dearest and loveliest of human relations consecrated by contrast with what is Divine.  In the second picture we have the Divine relation itself, showing itself under the limitations of the human.\"<1>  Dutch painting, he tells us, ought not to be despised; \"for it is this fresh and wakeful freedom and vitality of mind in apprehension and presentation that forms the highest aspect of these pictures.\"  And a commentator adds, \"The spontaneous joy of the perfect life is figured to this lower sphere.\"  His whole treatment of Art as a symbol confirms this view, as do all his criticisms.  Art or Beauty shall reveal to our understanding the eternal Ideal.  <1> Kedney's Hegel's _Aesthetics_, 1892, p. 158.  On comparing this with what we have won from Kant, Schiller, and Schelling, the divergence becomes apparent.  I have tried to show that there is no essential difference between these three either in their general view of the aesthetic experience, or in the degree of objectivity of their doctrine of Beauty. They do not contradict one another.  They merely emphasize now the unity, now the reconciliation of opposites, in the aesthetic experience.  The experience of the beautiful constitutes a reconciliation of the warring elements of experience, in a world in which the demands of Reason seem to conflict with the logic of events, and the beautiful object is such that it constitutes the permanent possibility for this reconciliation.  But the attempt to include Hegel within this circle reveals at once the need of further delimitation.  The beautiful is to reveal, and to vindicate in revealing, the union of the world-elements, that is, the spirit of the world.  On Hegel's own principles, the Idea should be \"expressed to sense.\"  Now if this expression is not, after all, directly to sense, but the sense gives merely the occasion for passing over to the thought of the Divine, it would seem that the Beauty is not after all in the work of art, but out of it.  The Infinite, or the Idea, or the fusion of real and ideal, must be shown to sense.  Is there any way in which this is conceivable?  We cannot completely express to sense Niagara Falls or the Jungfrau, for they are infinitely beyond the possibilities of imitation. Yet the particular contour of the Jungfrau is never mistaken in the smallest picture. In making a model of Niagara we should have to reproduce the relation between body of water, width of stream, and height of fall, and we might succeed in getting the peculiar effect of voluminousness which marks that wonder of Nature.  The soaring of a lark is not like the pointing upward of a slender Gothic spire, yet there is a likeness in the attitudes with which we follow them.  All these cases have certain form-qualities in common, by virtue of which they resemble each other.  Now it is these very form-qualities which Kant is using when he takes the aesthetic judgment as representative of reason in the world of sense because it shows the qualities of the ideas of reason,--that is, unconditional totality or freedom.  And we might, indeed, hope to \"express the Idea to sense\" if we could find for it a form-quality, or subjectively, in the phrase of Kant, a form of reflection.  What is the form of reflection for the Absolute, the Idea? It would appear to be a combination of Unity and Totality-- self-completeness.  An object, then, which should be self- complete from all possible points of view, to which could be applied the \"form of reflection\" for the Absolute, would, therefore, alone truly express it, and so alone fulfill the end of Beauty.  The Idea would be there in its form; it would be shown to sense, and so first full expressed.  With this important modification of Hegel's definition of Beauty, which brings it into line with the point of view already won, I believe the way is at last opened from the traditional philosophy of aesthetics to a healthy and concrete psychological theory.  But must every self-complete object give rise to the aesthetic experience?  An object is absolutely self-complete only for the perceiving subject; it is so, in other words, only when it produces a self-complete experience for that subject.  If reconciliation of the warring elements of the universe is the end of Beauty it must take place not for, but in, the human personality; it must not be understood, but immediately, completely experienced; it should be realized in the subject of the aesthetic experience, the lover of beauty.  The beautiful object would be not that which should show in outline form, or remind of, this Unity of the World, but which should create for the subject the moment of self- completeness; which should inform the aesthetic subject with that unity and self-completeness which are the \"forms of reflection\" of the Infinite.  The subject should be not a mirror of perfection, but a state of perfection.  Only in this sense does the concept of reconciliation come to its full meaning.  Not because I see freedom, but because I am free; not because I think of God, or the Infinite, or the one, but because I am for the moment complete, at the highest point of energy and unity, does the aesthetic experience constitute such a reconciliation.  Not because I behold the Infinite, but because I have, myself, a moment of perfection.  Herein it is that our theory constitutes a complete contradiction to all \"expression\" or \"significant\" theories of the Beautiful, and does away with the necessity those theories are under of reading sermons into stones.  The yellow primrose needs not to remind us of the harmony of the universe, or to have ulterior significance whatever, if it gives by its own direct simple stimulation a moment of Unity and Self- completeness.  That immediate experience indeed contains in itself the \"form of reflection\" of the Absolute, and it is through this that we so often pass, in the enjoyment of Beauty, to the thought of the divine.  But that thought is a corollary, a secondary effect, not an essential part of the aesthetic moment.  There is a wonderful bit of unconscious aesthetics in the following passage from Senancour, touching the \"secret of relation\" we have just analyzed.  \"It was dark and rather cold.  I was gloomy, and walked because I had nothing to do.  I passed by some flowers placed breast- high upon a wall.  A jonquil in bloom was there.  It is the strongest expression of desire:  it was the first perfume of the year.  I felt all the happiness destined for man.  This unutterable harmony of souls, the phantom of the ideal world, arose in me complete.  I never felt anything so great or so instantaneous.  I know not what shape, what analogy, what secret of relation it was that made me see in this flower a limitless beauty.... I shall never inclose in a conception this power, this immensity that nothing will express; this form that nothing will contain; this ideal of a better world which one feels, but which it would seem that nature has not made.\"<1>  <1> Translation by Carleton Noyes:  _The Enjoyment of Art_, 1903, p. 65.  Our philosophical definition of Beauty has thus taken final shape.  The beautiful object possesses those qualities which bring the personality into a state of unity and self-completeness. Lightly to case aside such a definition as abstract, vague, Empty, is no less short sighted than to treat the idea of the Absolute Will, of the Transcendental Reason, of the Eternal Love, as mere intellectual factors in the aesthetic experience. It should not be criticised as giving \"no objective account of the nature and origin of Beauty.\"  The nature of Beauty is indicated in the definition; the origin of Beauty may be studied in its historical development; its reason for being is simply the desire of the human heart for the perfect moment.  Beauty is to bring unity and self-completeness into the personality.  By what means?  What causes can bring about this effect?  When we enter the realm of causes and effects, however, we have already left the ground of philosophy, and it is fitting that the concepts which we have to use should be adapted to the empirical point of view.  The personality, as dealt with in psychology, is but the psychophysical organism; and we need to know only how to translate unity and self-completeness into psychological terms.  The psychological organism is in a state of unity either when it is in a state of virtual congealment or emptiness, as in a trance or ecstasy; or when it is in a state of repose, without tendency to change.  Secondly, the organism is self-complete when it is at the highest possible point of tone, of functional efficiency, of enhanced life.  Then a combination of favorable stimulation and repose would characterize the aesthetic feeling.  But it may be said that stimulation and repose are contradictory concepts, and we must indeed admit that the absolute repose of the hypnotic trance is not aesthetic, because empty of stimulus. The only aesthetic repose is that in which stimulation resulting in impulse to movement or action is checked or compensated for by its antagonistic impulse; inhibition of action, or action returning upon itself, combined with heightening of tone.  But this is TENSION, EQUILIBRIUM, or BALANCE OF FORCES, which is thus seen to be A GENERAL CONDITION OF ALL AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE.  The concept is familiar in pictorial composition and to some extent also in music and poetry, but here first appears as grounded in the very demand for the union of repose with"]]]
