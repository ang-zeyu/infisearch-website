Some Little Things to See     114     PART I  THROUGH A MICROSCOPE  BY SAMUEL WELLS     THROUGH A MICROSCOPE   I  An object one hundredth of an inch in diameter, or of which it would take one hundred placed side by side to make an inch, is about the smallest thing that can be easily seen by the unassisted eye. Take a piece of card and punch a little hole through it with the point of a small needle, hold it towards a lamp or a window, and you will see the light through it.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]  This hole will be about the size just mentioned, and you will find that you can see it best and most distinctly when you hold it at a certain distance from your eye; and this distance will not be far from ten inches, unless you are near-sighted. Now bring it towards your eye and you will find it becomes blurred and indistinct. You will see by this experiment that you cannot see things distinctly when held too close to your eye, or in other words, that you cannot bring your eye nearer to an object than eight or ten inches and see it well at the same time.  You could see things much smaller than one hundredth of an inch if you could get your eye close enough to them. How can that be done? By a microscope? yes, but what is that? This name comes from two Greek words that mean \"to see small things;\" and a microscope is an instrument by which your eye can get very close to what you want to see.  To understand this, take out one of your eyes and look at it with the other one. You see that it is a little round camera; most boys have seen a camera and some boys can make one. The simplest way to do that is to take a box, say a cigar box (empty, of course); pull off the cover and fasten in the place of it a piece of ground glass if you have one: if not a piece of white letter paper, oiled, will do; bore a hole in the middle of the bottom with a small gimlet and your camera is done. Point the bottom with the hole in it out of the window, and throw a piece of cloth over your head and over the box, as the photographers do, to shut out the side light, but mind and not cover up the hole; look at the ground glass (or oiled paper) and you will see things upside down. (Fig. 1.) But what has it to do with my eye? you say. Why, your eye is just like it, only round, as in fig. 2. And if you hold a doll or anything else about ten inches in front of the eye you have taken out and look at the inside of it (the eye, not the doll) just as you look at the ground glass of your box camera, you will see the doll upside down on the back of the eye.  But how, do you say, can I see things right side up when they are upside down in my eye? This is a very good conundrum and it will keep a long time, till you are about seventy years old and have spare time to sit down and think about it.  Now you see how your eye is a camera; the pupil is the hole and the back of the eye, called the retina, is the ground glass.  But you will find that the camera you have just made does not show things distinctly and beautifully as the photographer's camera does; how can they be distinct in the eye then?  Because in the photographer's camera, in the hole is a lens, which is a piece of glass, shaped like a sun glass; and so in your eye just behind the pupil is a lens, not made of glass, but still almost as transparent as if it were. In order to see what effect this lens has, take your box camera, make the hole larger and put a lens in it; one of your magic lantern lenses will do; and if the lens has the right focus you will see the images sharp and distinct on your ground glass. The focus probably will not be just right, so make a paper tube, into which fasten your lens and slide the tube in and out of the hole until you find the right focus.  When you have got that right so that you see a boy on the sidewalk upside down and see his teeth when he laughs, put some small object, the little doll will do, about three feet in front of your lens, and you will find the image of it is blurred and indistinct, and that you must pull your tube out to get the focus on the doll; or if you had another lens of just the right shape to hold in front of your camera, you would with that get the focus on the doll.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]  Thus you can see how it is with your eye, and why you cannot see things distinctly held close to it. The lens in the eye can change its shape a little, so that it will focus objects a mile off, or ten inches off, but it cannot be pushed in and out like the tube in your camera. You can do this, however, if you take another lens and hold it outside your eye and let the light go through that first before it comes to the lens in your eye, and in this way you can get a focus in your retina, and the outside lens thus forms a part of that optical instrument called your eye. Does your grandma know that her spectacles are a part of the cameras that she calls her eyes?  How is it that a lens bends (refracts is the big word for it) the rays of light? You will learn by and by. You can see that it does so by a few experiments with your sun glass or any such lens. Hold it between the sun and a piece of white paper until the white spot in the centre is as small as you can make it. You will see that the rest of the lens casts a shadow although it is all glass; this is because the rays of sunlight that fall on the lens are all bent towards the centre, and so you have a small white spot on which is concentrated the light and the heat, and before you have found out how it is all done, your paper takes fire and the experiment ends in smoke.  Take another piece of paper, and when the white spot is at its smallest, measure the distance between the lens and the paper, and you will have the focal distance of the lens.  You have now found out how to get your eye close to an object and see something that is very small; this is usually called magnifying it, because it seems to make it look large. Suppose you have a lens that will let you see a flea through it held just one inch from it, this lens is now an addition to your eye, as we measure from the lens. If you had another flea held ten inches off, so big that it would just be hidden by the little flea, the one farthest off would be ten times as large as the near one. (Fig. 3.) In this case it is said that the lens having a focal length of one inch magnifies ten times, or has a power of ten.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.]  The shortest usual distance of objects seen distinctly being taken as ten inches, microscopists have agreed to consider that as the standard of measurement, and objects seen through a lens are considered magnified to the size they would have if projected ten inches off, like our little flea.   II.--THE OUTFIT.  Now that we have got hold of the idea that the eye is an optical instrument, and that to increase its capacity for seeing small things we add to it other optical contrivances, making with it one instrument composed of several parts, let us look at such additions more particularly.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--OPEN AND CLOSED.]  One pleasant September afternoon, three gentlemen were strolling along the banks of the Wissahickon, in Philadelphia's beautiful park, and stopping now and then to examine some little flower or insect with pocket lenses, when they discovered that some little boys out for a holiday were watching their proceedings with a curious and mystified interest. One of the gentlemen had a pocket microscope with three lenses of different sizes, as in Fig. 1. Calling the boys up to him he showed them a little flower magnified. They had never dreamed of such a sight, and their wonder and amazement were as great as if they suddenly beheld a new world. You will be as surprised as they were when you take your first peep, but you must learn to see such things _by yourselves_. The first thing you need is a simple microscope, that is, one with a single lens, small enough to be carried in the pocket. There are different forms and sizes of such microscopes, varying in quality and price. Those like the one just mentioned are made with from one to four lenses each, and are perhaps the most generally useful. Then there is the Coddington lens (Fig. 2) which is still more compact; and it is sometimes made in the form of Fig. 3. It has a very short focus, and is not, therefore, very easy to use. Achromatic doublets and triplets are made of two or more lenses cemented together and mounted in the same style as the Coddington lens; they are very much better than the Coddington, but are more expensive.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]  There are several devices for mounting these simple microscopes on stands so that they can be kept steady and the objects to be examined placed behind them. One of these is illustrated in Fig. 4. An ingenious boy with a block of wood for a base, some stout wire and corks, can make one almost as useful, though not so handsome.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.]  A more elaborate "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38428"],["title","Through a Microscope (#1)"],["body","is shown in Fig. 5. It has a glass stage to hold transparent objects, and a brass one for opaque objects, and a mirror below to reflect light up through transparent objects.  It is much better to use a good simple microscope than a poor and cheap compound one; be sure and remember this and not be enticed to buy such an one by any representations as to its great magnifying power.  A compound microscope is one with a tube from four to ten inches long, an arrangement for holding the object to be looked at, and a mirror below to reflect light upon or through it. The lenses at the end next the object are small, and are set in a small brass tube, which is called an \"objective.\" It screws into the large tube. The lenses at the end of the large tube next the eye are set in a tube, called the eye-piece, which slides in and out of the large tube. Different objectives contain lenses of different sizes according to the magnifying power desired, and they are named \"two inch,\" \"one inch,\" \"half inch,\" and so on down to \"one seventy-fifth.\" Eye-pieces are sometimes named \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" but more properly \"two inch,\" and so on down to \"one eighth.\" There is a very great variety in the forms of compound microscopes, from the very simple up to the very elaborate, and the prices vary accordingly. A simple but useful form is given in Fig. 6.  A great deal of money can be expended on a microscope and the various instruments made to use with it and which are called \"accessory apparatus\"; but it is best not to buy these instruments until you know just what you want, and not to spend much money at first except under the advice of a \"microscopist.\"  Some simple things, however, you will need at once, such as a few slips of glass three inches long and one inch wide, called \"glass slides,\" some pieces of very thin glass, called \"cover glass,\" a pair of tweezers, some needles fastened into pen-holders for handles, and a few glass tubes commonly called \"pipettes,\" or \"dipping tubes.\" These can be readily bought, and some of them easily made.    [Illustration: CATCHING ANIMALCULA WITH A PIPETTE.]   III.--OBJECTS.  As soon as you have a microscope you will begin to look at everything and anything: dust, crumbs of bread, flour, starch, mosquitoes, flies, and moth millers in their season; flowers and leaves, cotton, wool, and silk. But this scattering kind of observation will soon weary you. In order to get the greatest pleasure and best results from your work, you must proceed with some system.    [Illustration: BULL'S EYE LENS.]  There are so many objects visible only through the microscope that life is not long enough for you to see them all, much less to study them. Some microscopists devote the time they have for such studies to the observation of single classes of objects; the physician observes the various parts of the animal structure, and calls his work \"histology;\" the botanist examines the vegetable kingdom; the entomologist, insects; but in all these departments there are numerous subdivisions. As a guide to your work, you will find some book on the microscope very useful; the best one is _The Microscope and its Revelations_, by Dr. William B. Carpenter.    [Illustration: MAGNIFIED 50 DIAMETERS.]    [Illustration: FLY'S EYE--5 DIAMETERS.]  Objects through which you can see light are called \"transparent,\" and are the easiest to look at with the microscope, because you can lay them on a glass slide and throw light up through them with your mirror. Thick objects through which light cannot pass are called \"opaque,\" and are more difficult to examine, and can only be seen with low powers and a bright light.  In order to see such objects in the evening, you will need a \"bull's eye\" lens mounted on a stand, which you can place beside your microscope and between the lamp and the stage, condensing the light of the lamp on the object. (_Fig. 1._) There are other methods of illuminating opaque objects, but they are expensive and difficult to manage, yet by and by if you persevere in this delightful occupation you will learn what they are.    [Illustration: Scale of Butterfly   MAGNIFIED 200 DIAMETERS.]    [Illustration: HEAD OF MOSQUITO. MAGNIFIED 15 DIAMETERS.]  Some persons will expect you to show them a fly as big as a horse; but you will soon be able to prove to them that you know more about the matter than they do. With a large hand-lens, you can see a whole fly at once and magnify it two or three times; but when you put it on the stage of your compound microscope and try to magnify it still more, you will find that you can only see a part of it at a time, and the higher the power you use, the less can you see; in other words, the more you magnify an object, the smaller is the field of view.  An inch-objective will show the head of an housefly, which in a bright light is a very beautiful object. No picture can equal the delicacy of the color of the eyes of a live fly.    [Illustration: SECTION OF WOOD.   MAGNIFIED 50 DIAMETERS.]  After a little practise you will be able to separate the different parts of insects and look at them with higher powers. The moth fly will soon be on the wing, and your aunt will not call you cruel if you kill and cut up large numbers of them. Put a little of the dust that comes off from the wing of a moth on a glass slide, look at it with a high power, and you will find that each particle of dust is a pretty leaf-like scale. You have seen in summer the dust on the wings of butterflies; remember this, and look at this butterfly dust with your microscope.  Flowers and leaves you can always easily obtain; but in looking at them you must remember what has already been said about \"transparent\" and \"opaque\" objects.  Thin slices or sections of stems, leaves, and portions of flowers, can be made with a sharp knife, and examined as transparent objects, so that thus you can observe the internal or cellular structure of the vegetable kingdom.   IV.--HOME EXPERIMENTS.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.]  During the cold weather it is not pleasant to make excursions into the country and search for objects for the microscope; so you will look about and see what you can find at home; and if you live in Boston, Cochituate water will invite your inspection. The best way to get at the minute objects in this or any water that is supplied through pipes, is to make a bag of cotton cloth, not too fine, well washed in water without soap, about a foot long, large enough at the top to slip over a faucet that has a screw on it (like the common kitchen faucet adapted for a filter), so that it can be tied with a string, and small enough at the bottom to be tied on to the neck of a small bottle such as is used for homoeopathic pills. This bag should taper gradually in size from the top to the bottom. (_Fig. 1._)    [Illustration: The Water Flea   FIG. 2. CYCLOPS QUADRICORNIS. MAGNIFIED 20 DIAMETERS.]    [Illustration: FIG. 3. CANTHOCAMPTUS MINUTUS. 40 DIAMETERS.]  If there is a strong head of water where your faucet is, you must reduce the pressure by opening other faucets on the same floor, such as those in the laundry, otherwise many of the small creatures will be crushed in the interstices of the bag. Now let the water run. The bag will swell out and the water ooze through its sides, and all objects too small to pass through it will fall down and settle in the little bottle at the bottom. When you see that there is a considerable amount of sediment in the bottle, shut off the water and gently squeeze the bag between your thumb and forefinger, beginning at the top and moving your hand down towards the bottle. This movement will cause much of the sediment that has adhered to the sides of the bag to fall down. Now untie your bottle and set it aside and let the water run through the bag to clean it. If you have a filter attached to your kitchen faucet you can get a very good idea of the solid contents of the water by unscrewing it, or turning it over if it is made so as to reverse, and letting the sediment that has collected on it drip into a tumbler, but the bag gives much better results, as many of the delicate forms that live in the water are crushed to death on the filter.    [Illustration: FIG. 4. CHYDORUS SPHOERICUS. 50 DIAMETERS.]  Having got the sediment in either a tumbler or a bottle, you must make your first observation on it with the naked eye by holding it up to the light and looking through it. You will find it of a brown color, because a large part of it consists of particles of earth and decayed vegetable matter, but you will presently see many little white specks moving about with a jumping or hopping movement. These are commonly called \"water-fleas,\" on account of their peculiar movements, but the name is misleading, as they belong to the crustacea (animals having a shell or crust like the lobster), and not to the insects.  They are found abundantly in ponds and ditches, and in salt water. Sometimes they are so abundant in drinking water that has not been filtered, as to alarm a timid person, but you will find them just as good to eat raw as they are cooked. The most common of these little creatures is the _Cyclops Quadricornis_, so called because he has one eye and four horns. (_Fig. 2._)  This picture represents a female, and she carries her eggs in the two little black bags that you see fastened on each side of the abdomen. You will find it very interesting by and by to watch the eggs hatch and see the little cyclops hop away. When young they do not look much like their parents; they are rounder and their legs are more prominent. The female cyclops (the male is comparatively rare) is the most common creature in Cochituate water, and as it is constantly eating, it helps to purify the water, and, in its turn, is eaten by the fishes.  In swimming it contracts its four horns and its fringed feet with a quick movement that throws it forward through the water with a leap.  Its one eye is of a brilliant red, and is a beautiful"]]]
