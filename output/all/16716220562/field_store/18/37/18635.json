A million tiny factors, all depending on blind, uncontrollable chance, determine the course of your life--including your love-life.... Well, we needn't waste any time on philosophy. Go on, ask some questions. I admit I've hurt you--unwittingly, to be sure--but I do want to make amends.\"  \"Your machine, then,\" said Fraser. \"How did you get it? How does it work.\"  \"I was practicing in Chicago,\" said Kennedy, \"and collaborating on the side with Gavotti. How much do you know of cybernetics? I don't mean computers and automata, which are only one aspect of the field; I mean control and communication, in the animal as well as in the machine.\"  \"Well, I've read Wiener's books, and studied Shannon's work, too.\" Despite himself, Fraser was thawing, just a trifle. \"It's exciting stuff. Communications-theory seems to be basic, in biology and psychology as well as in electronics.\"  \"Quite. The future may remember Wiener as the Galileo of neurology. If Gavotti's work ever gets published, he'll be considered the Newton. So far, frankly, I've suppressed it. He died suddenly, just when his machine was completed and he was getting ready to publish his results. Nobody but I knew anything more than rumors; he was inclined to be secretive till he had a _fait accompli_ on hand. I realized what an opportunity had been given me, and took it; I brought the machine here without saying much to anyone.\"  Kennedy leaned back in his chair. \"I imagine it was mostly luck which took Gavotti and me so far,\" he went on. \"We made a long series of improbably good guesses, and thus telescoped a century of work into a decade. If I were religious, I'd be down on my knees, thanking the Lord for putting this thing of the future into my hands.\"  \"Or the devil,\" said Fraser.  Briefly, anger flitted across Kennedy's face. \"I grant you, the machine is a terrible power, but it's harmless to a man if it's used properly--as I have used it. I'm not going to tell you just how it works; to be perfectly honest, I only understand a fraction of its theory and its circuits myself. But look, you know something of encephalography. The various basic rhythms of the brain have been measured. The standard method is already so sensitive that it can detect abnormalities like a developing tumor or a strong emotional disturbance, that will give trouble unless corrected. Half of Gavotti's machine is a still more delicate encephalograph. It can measure and analyze the minute variations in electrical pulses corresponding to the basic emotional states. It won't read thoughts, no; but once calibrated for a given individual, it will tell you if he's happy, sorrowful, angry, disgusted, afraid--any fundamental neuro-glandular condition, or any combination of them.\"  He paused. \"All right,\" said Fraser. \"What else does it do?\"  \"It does _not_ make monsters,\" said Kennedy. \"Look, the specific emotional reaction to a given stimulus is, in the normal individual, largely a matter of conditioned reflex, instilled by social environment or the accidental associations of his life.  \"Anyone in decent health will experience fear in the presence of danger; desire in the presence of a sexual object, and so on. That's basic biology, and the machine can't change that. But most of our evaluations are learned. For instance, to an American the word 'mother' has powerful emotional connotations, while to a Samoan it means nothing very exciting. You had to develop a taste for liquor, tobacco, coffee--in fact most of what you consume. If you're in love with a particular woman, it's a focusing of the general sexual libido on her, brought about by the symbolizing part of your mind: she _means_ something to you. There are cultures without romantic love, you know. And so on. All these specific, conditioned reactions can be changed.\"  \"How?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Kennedy thought for a moment \"The encephalographic part of the machine measures the exact pulsations in the individual corresponding to the various emotional reactions. It takes me about four hours to determine those with the necessary precision; then I have to make statistical analyses of the data, to winnow out random variations. Thereafter I put the subject in a state of light hypnosis--that's only to increase suggestibility, and make the process faster. As I pronounce the words and names I'm interested in, the machine feeds back the impulses corresponding to the emotions I want: a sharply-focused beam on the brain center concerned.  \"For instance, suppose you were an alcoholic and I wanted to cure you. I'd put you in hypnosis and stand there whispering 'wine, whisky, beer, gin,' and so on; meanwhile, the machine would be feeding the impulses corresponding to your reactions of hate, fear, and disgust into your brain. You'd come out unchanged, except that your appetite for alcohol would be gone; you could, in fact, come out hating the stuff so much that you'd join the Prohibition Party--though, in actual practice, it would probably be enough just to give you a mild aversion.\"  \"Mmmm--I see. Maybe.\" Fraser scowled. \"And the--subject--doesn't remember what you've done?\"  \"Oh, no. It all takes place on the lower subconscious levels. A new set of conditioned neural pathways is opened, you see, and old ones are closed off. The brain does that by itself, through its normal symbolizing mechanism. All that happens is that the given symbol--such as liquor--becomes reflectively associated with the given emotional state, such as dislike.\"  Kennedy leaned forward with an air of urgency. \"The end result is in no way different from ordinary means of persuasion. Propaganda does the same thing by sheer repetition. If you're courting a girl, you try to identify yourself in her mind with the things she desires, by appropriate behavior.... I'm sorry; I shouldn't have used that example.... The machine is only a direct, fast way of doing this, producing a more stable result.\"  \"It's still--tampering,\" said Fraser. \"How do you know you're not creating side-effects, doing irreparable long-range damage?\"  \"Oh, for Lord's sake!\" exploded Kennedy. \"Take your mind off that shelf, will you? I've told you how delicate the whole thing is. A few microwatts of power more or less, a frequency-shift of less than one percent, and it doesn't work at all. There's no effect whatsoever.\" He cooled off fast, adding reflectively: \"On the given subject, that is. It might work on someone else. These pulsations are a highly individual matter; I have to calibrate every case separately.\"  There was a long period of silence. Then Fraser strained forward and said in an ugly voice:  \"All right You've told me how you do it. Now tell me _why_. What possible reason or excuse, other than your own desire to play God? This thing could be the greatest psychiatric tool in history, and you're using it to--pimp!\"  \"I told you that was unimportant,\" said Kennedy quietly. \"I'm doing much more. I set up in practice here in New York a couple of years ago. Once I had a few chance people under control--no, I tell you again, I didn't make robots of them. I merely associated myself, in their own minds, with the father-image. That's something I do to everyone who comes under the machine, just as a precaution if nothing else, Kennedy is all-wise, all-powerful; Kennedy can do no wrong. It isn't a conscious realization; to the waking mind, I am only a shrewd adviser and a damn swell fellow. But the subconscious mind knows otherwise. It wouldn't _let_ my subjects act against me; it wouldn't even let them want to.  \"Well, you see how it goes. I got those first few people to recommend me to certain selected friends, and these in turn recommended me to others. Not necessarily as a psychiatrist; I have variously been a doctor, a counsellor, or merely a research-man looking for data. But I'm building up a group of the people I want. People who'll back me up, who'll follow my advice--not with any knowledge of being dominated, but because the workings of their own subconscious minds will lead them inevitably to think that my advice is the only sound policy to follow and my requests are things any decent man must grant.\"  \"Yeah,\" said Fraser. \"I get it. Big businessmen. Labor-leaders. Politicians. Military men. And Soviet spies!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Kennedy nodded. \"I have connections with the Soviets; their agents think I'm on their side. But it isn't treason, though I may help them out from time to time.  \"That's why I have to do these services for my important clients, such as getting them the women they want--or, what I actually do more often, influencing their competitors and associates. You see, the subconscious mind knows I am all-powerful, but the conscious mind doesn't. It has to be satisfied by occasional proofs that I _am_ invaluable; otherwise conflicts would set in, my men would become unstable and eventually psychotic, and be of no further use to me.  \"Of course,\" he added, almost pedantically, \"my men don't know how I persuade these other people--they only know that I do, somehow, and their regard for their own egos, as well as for me, sets up a bloc which prevents them from reasoning out the fact that they themselves are dominated. They're quite content to accept the results of my help, without inquiring further into the means than the easy rationalization that I have a 'persuasive personality.'  \"I don't like what I'm doing, Fraser. But it's got to be done.\"  \"You still haven't said _what's_ got to be done,\" answered the engineer coldly.  \"I've been given something unbelievable,\" said Kennedy. His voice was very soft now. \"If I'd made it public, can you imagine what would have happened? Psychiatrists would use it, yes; but so would criminals, dictators, power-hungry men of all kinds. Even in this country, I don't think libertarian principles could long survive. It would be too simple--  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37653"],["title","Sentiment, Inc. (#4)"],["body","\"And yet it would have been cowardly to break the machine and burn Gavotti's notes. Chance has given me the power to be more than a chip in the river--a river that's rapidly approaching a waterfall, war, destruction, tyranny, no matter who the Pyrrhic victor may be. I'm in a position to do something for the causes in which I believe.\"  \"And what are they?\" asked Fraser.  Kennedy gestured at the pictures on the mantel. \"Both my sons were killed in the last war. My wife died of cancer--a disease which would be licked now if a fraction of the money spent on armaments had been diverted to research. That brought it home to me; but there are hundreds of millions of people in worse cases. And war isn't the only evil--there is poverty, oppression, inequality, want and suffering. It could be changed.  \"I'm building up my own lobby, you might say. In a few more years, I hope to be the indispensable adviser of all the men who, between them, really run this country. And yes, I have been in touch with Soviet agents--have even acted as a transmitter of stolen information. The basic problem of spying, you know, is not to get the information in the first place as much as to get it to the homeland. Treason? No. I think not. I'm getting my toehold in world communism. I already have some of its agents; sooner or later, I'll get to the men who really matter. Then communism will no longer be a menace.\"  He sighed. \"It's a hard row to hoe. It'll take my lifetime, at least; but what else have I got to give my life to?\"  Fraser sat quiet. His pipe was cold, he knocked it out and began filling it afresh. The scratching of his match seemed unnaturally loud. \"It's too much,\" he said. \"It's too big a job for one man to tackle. The world will stumble along somehow, but you'll just get things into a worse mess.\"  \"I've got to try,\" said Kennedy.  \"And I still want my girl back.\"  \"I can't do that; I need Snyder too much. But I'll make it up to you somehow.\" Kennedy sighed. \"Lord, if you knew how much I've wanted to tell all this!\"  With sudden wariness: \"Not that it's to be repeated. In fact, you're to lay off me; call off your dogs. Don't try to tell anyone else what I've told you. You'd never be believed and I already have enough power to suppress the story, if you should get it out somehow. And if you give me any more trouble at all, I'll see to it that you--stop.\"  \"Murder?\"  \"Or commitment to an asylum. I can arrange that too.\"  Fraser sighed. He felt oddly unexcited, empty, as if the interview had drained him of his last will to resist. He held the pipe loosely in his fingers, letting it go out.  \"Ask me a favor,\" urged Kennedy. \"I'll do it, if it won't harm my own program. I tell you, I want to square things.\"  \"Well--\"  \"Think about it. Let me know.\"  \"All right.\" Fraser got up. \"I may do that.\" He went out the door without saying goodnight.     4   He sat with his feet on the table, chair tilted back and teetering dangerously, hands clasped behind his head, pipe filling the room with blue fog. It was his usual posture for attacking a problem.  And damn it, he thought wearily, this was a question such as he made his living on. An industrial engineer comes into the office. We want this and that--a machine for a very special purpose, let's say. What should we do, Mr. Fraser? Fraser prowls around the plant, reads up on the industry, and then sits down and thinks. The elements of the problem are such-and-such; how can they be combined to yield a solution?  Normally, he uses the mathematical approach, especially in machine design. Most practicing-engineers have a pathetic math background--they use ten pages of elaborate algebra and rusty calculus to figure out something that three vector equations would solve. But you have to get the logical basics straight first, before you can set up your equations.  All right, what is the problem? To get Judy back. That means forcing Kennedy to restore her normal emotional reactions--no, he didn't want her thrust into love of him; he just wanted her as she had been.  What are the elements of the problem? Kennedy acts outside the law, but he has blocked all official channels. He even has connections extending through the Iron Curtain.  Hmmmm--appeal to the FBI? Kennedy couldn't have control over them--_yet_. However, if Fraser tried to tip off the FBI, they'd act cautiously, if they investigated at all. They'd have to go slow. And Kennedy would find out in time to do something about it.  Martinez could help no further. Sworsky had closer contact with Washington. He'd been so thoroughly cleared that they'd be inclined to trust whatever he said. But Sworsky doubted the whole story; like many men who'd suffered through irresponsible Congressional charges, he was almost fanatic about having proof before accusing anyone of anything. Moreover, Kennedy knew that Sworsky was Fraser's friend; he'd probably be keeping close tabs on the physicist and ready to block any attempts he might make to help. With the backing of a man like Snyder, Kennedy could hire as many detectives as he wanted.  In fact, whatever the counter-attack, it was necessary to go warily. Kennedy's threat to get rid of Fraser if the engineer kept working against him was not idle mouthing. He could do it--and, being a fanatic, would.  But Kennedy, like the demon of legend, would grant one wish--just to salve his own conscience. Only what should the wish be? Another woman? Or merely to be reconciled, artificially, to an otherwise-intolerable situation?  _Judy, Judy, Judy!_  Fraser swore at himself. Damn it to hell, this was a problem in logic. No room for emotion. Of course, it might be a problem without a solution. There are plenty of those.  He squinted, trying to visualize the office. He thought of burglary, stealing evidence--silly thought. But let's see, now. What was the layout, exactly? Four suites on one floor of the skyscraper, three of them unimportant offices of unimportant men. And--  _Oh, Lord!_  Fraser sat for a long while, hardly moving. Then he uncoiled himself and ran, downstairs and into the street and to the nearest pay phone. His own line might be tapped--  \"Hello, hello, Juan?... Yes, I know I got you out of bed, and I'm not sorry. This is too bloody important.... Okay, okay.... Look, I want a complete report on the Messenger Advertising Service.... When? Immediately, if not sooner. And I mean _complete_.... That's right, Messenger.... Okay, fine. I'll buy you a drink sometime.\"  \"Hello, Jim? Were you asleep too?... Sorry.... But look, would you make a list of all the important men you know fairly well? I need it bad.... No, don't come over. I think I'd better not see you for a while. Just mail it to me.... All right, so I am paranoid....\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jerome K. Ferris was a large man, with a sense of his own importance that was even larger. He sat hunched in the chair, his head dwarfed by the aluminum helmet, his breathing shallow. Around him danced and flickered a hundred meters, indicator lights, tubes. There was a low humming in the room, otherwise it was altogether silent, blocked and shielded against the outside world. The fluorescent lights were a muted glow.  Fraser sat watching the greenish trace on the huge oscilloscope screen. It was an intricate set of convolutions, looking more like a plate of spaghetti than anything else. He wondered how many frequencies were involved. Several thousand, at the very least.  \"Fraser,\" repeated Kennedy softly into the ear of the hypnotized man. \"Colin Fraser. Colin Fraser.\" He touched a dial with infinite care. \"Colin Fraser. Colin Fraser.\"  The oscilloscope flickered as he readjusted, a new trace appeared. Kennedy waited for a while, then: \"Robert Kennedy. Sentiment, Inc. Robert Kennedy. Sentiment, Inc. Robert Kennedy. Sentiment--\"  He turned off the machine, its murmur and glow died away. Facing Fraser with a tight little smile, he said: \"All right. Your job is done. Are we even now?\"  \"As even, as we'll ever get, I suppose,\" said Fraser.  \"I wish you'd trust me,\" said Kennedy with a hint of wistfulness. \"I'd have done the job honestly; you didn't have to watch.\"  \"Well, I was interested,\" said Fraser.  \"Frankly, I still don't see what you stand to gain by the doglike devotion of this Ferris. He's rich, but he's too weak and short-sighted to be a leader. I'd never planned on conditioning him for my purposes.\"  \"I've explained that,\" said Fraser patiently. \"Ferris is a large stockholder in a number of corporations. His influence can swing a lot of business my way.\"  \"Yes, I know. I didn't grant your wish blindly, you realize. I had Ferris studied; he's unable to harm me.\" Kennedy regarded Fraser with hard eyes. \"And just in case you still have foolish notions, please remember that I gave him the father-conditioning with respect to myself. He'll do a lot for you, but not if it's going to hurt me in any way.\"  \"I know when I'm licked,\" said Fraser bleakly; \"I'm getting out of town as soon as I finish those courses I'm signed up for.\"  Kennedy snapped his fingers. \"All right, Ferris, wake up now.\"  Ferris blinked. \"What's been happening?\" he asked.  \"Nothing much,\" said Kennedy, unbuckling the electrodes. \"I've taken my readings. Thank you very much for the help, sir. I'll see that you get due credit when my research is published.\"  \"Ah--yes. Yes.\" Ferris puffed himself out. Then he put an arm around Fraser's shoulder. \"If you aren't busy,\" he said, \"maybe we could go have lunch.\"  \"Thanks,\" said Fraser. \"I'd like to talk to you about a few things.\"  He lingered for a moment after Ferris had left the room. \"I imagine this is goodbye for us,\" he said.  \"Well, so long, at least. We'll probably hear from each other again.\" Kennedy shook Fraser's hand. \"No hard feelings? I did go to a lot of trouble for you--wangling your introduction to Ferris when you'd named him, and having one of my men persuade him to come here. And right when I'm so infernally busy,"]]]
