Time may be saved by reference to graphic tables, too lengthy for reproduction here, showing the projected reading in degrees for every boundary, at every position of the moon; and a mechanical device, designed by C. M. Arney, duplicating the conditions of the original projection, speeds up the work even further. Both methods are based on the principle of the following formula:      tan [theta] = tan ([eta] - [psi]) / cos Z_{0}    (1)      [Illustration: FIG. 17. The meaning of symbols used in the        direction formula.]  The symbols have these meanings:  [theta] is the position angle of the sector boundary on the lunar clock, with positive values measured counterclockwise from 12 o'clock, negative angles clockwise (Figure 17A).  [eta] is the compass direction of the sector boundary expressed in degrees reckoned west from the south point (Figure 17B).  Z_{0} is the zenith distance of the moon's center midway through the hour of observation, that is, at the half hour. It represents the number of degrees of arc between the center of the moon and a point directly over the observer's head (Figure 17C).  [psi] is the azimuth of the moon midway through the hour of observation, measured from the south point, positive values to the west, negative values to the east (Figure 17D).      [Illustration: FIG. 18. Form used in the computation of the        zenith distance and azimuth of the moon.]  The angle [eta] for any sector boundary can be found immediately by measuring its position in the diagram (Figure 16). The form (Figure 18) for the \"Computation of Zenith Distance and Azimuth of the Moon\" illustrates the steps in calculating the values of Z_{0} and [psi]_{0}. From the American Air Almanac (Anonymous, 1945-1948), issued annually by the U. S. Naval Observatory in three volumes, each covering four months of the year, the Greenwich Hour Angle (GHA) and the declination of the moon may be obtained for any ten-minute interval of the date in question. The Local Hour Angle (LHA) of the observation station is determined by subtracting the longitude of the station from the GHA. Reference is then made to the \"Tables of Computed Altitude and Azimuth,\" published by the U. S. Navy Department, Hydrographic Office (Anonymous, 1936-1941), and better known as the \"H.O. 214,\" to locate the altitude and azimuth of the moon at the particular station for the middle of the hour during which the observations were made. The tables employ three variables--the latitude of the locality measured to the nearest degree, the LHA as determined above, and the declination of the moon measured to the nearest 30 minutes of arc. Interpolations can be made, but this exactness is not required. When the latitude of the observation station is in the northern hemisphere, the H.O. 214 tables entitled \"Declinations Contrary Name to Latitude\" are used with south declinations of the moon, and the tables \"Declinations Same Name as Latitude,\" with north declinations. In the sample shown in Figure 15, the declination of the moon at 11:30 P. M., midway through the 11 to 12 o'clock interval, was S 20° 22´. Since the latitude of Progreso, Yucatán is N 21° 17´, the \"Contrary Name\" tables apply to this hour.  Because the H.O. 214 expresses the vertical position of the moon in terms of its altitude, instead of its zenith distance, a conversion is required. The former is the number of arc degrees from the horizon to the moon's center; therefore Z_{0} is readily obtained by subtracting the altitude from 90°. Moreover, the azimuth given in the H.O. 214 is measured on a 360° scale from the north point, whereas the azimuth used here ([psi]_{0}) is measured 180° in either direction from the south point, negative values to the east, positive values to the west. I have designated the azimuth of the tables as Az_{n} and obtained the desired azimuth ([psi]_{0}) by subtracting 180° from Az_{n}. The sign of [psi]_{0} may be either positive or negative, depending on whether or not the moon has reached its zenith and hence the meridian of the observer. When the GHA is greater than the local longitude (that is, the longitude of the observation station), the azimuth is positive. When the GHA is less than the local longitude, the azimuth is negative.  Locating the position of a particular sector boundary now becomes a mere matter of substituting the values in the equation (1) and reducing. The computation of the north point for 11 to 12 P. M. in the sample set of data will serve as an example. Since the north point reckoned west from the south point is 180°, its [eta] has a value of 180°.      [Illustration: FIG. 19. Method of plotting sector        boundaries on the diagrammatic plots. The example employed is        the 11:00 to 12:00 P. M. diagram of Figure 15.]       tan [theta]_{Npt.} = tan (180° - [psi]_{0}) / cos Z_{0}  Substituting values of [psi]_{0} found on the form (Figure 18):      tan [theta]_{Npt.} = tan [180° - (-35°)] / cos 50°                        = tan 215° / cos 50° = .700 / .643 = 1.09      [theta]_{Npt.} = 47°28´       [Illustration: FIG. 20. Form for computing sector        densities.]  Four angles, one in each quadrant, have the same tangent value. Since, in processing spring data, we are dealing mainly with north sectors, it is convenient to choose the acute angle, in this instance 47° 28´. In doubtful cases, the value of the numerator of the equation (here 215°) applied as an angular measure from 6 o'clock will tell in which quadrant the projected boundary must fall. The fact that projection always draws the boundary closer to the 3-9 line serves as a further check on the computation.      [Illustration: FIG. 21. Determinationn of the angle [alpha]]  In the same manner, the projected position angles of all the pertinent sector boundaries for a given hour may be calculated and plotted in red pencil with a protractor on the circular diagrams of Figure 15. To avoid confusion in lines, the zones are not portrayed in the black and white reproduction of the sample plot form. They are shown, however, in the shaded enlargement (Figure 19) of the 11 to 12 P. M. diagram. The number of birds recorded for each sector may be ascertained by counting the number of tally marks between each pair of boundary lines and the information may be entered in the columns provided in the plot form (Figure 15). We are now prepared to turn to the form for \"Computations of Sector Densities\" (Figure 20), which systematizes the solution of the following equation:           (220) 60/T (No. of Birds) (cos^2 Z_{0})     D =  ---------------------------------------                   (2)          (1 - sin^2 Z_{0} cos^2 [alpha])^0.5       [Illustration: FIG. 22. Facsimile of form summarizing        sector densities. The totals at the bottom of each column        give the station densities.]       [Illustration: FIG. 23. Determination of Net Trend Density.]   Some of the symbols and factors, appearing here for the first time, require brief explanation. D stands for Sector Density. The constant, 220, is the reciprocal of the quotient of the angular diameter of the moon divided by 2. T is Time In, arrived at by subtracting the total number of minutes of time out, as noted for each hour on the original data sheets, from 60. \"No. of Birds\" is the number for the sector and hour in question as just determined on the plot form. The symbol [alpha] represents the angle between the mid-line of the sector and the azimuth line of the moon. The quantity is found by the equation:      [alpha] = 180° - [eta] + [psi]_{0}                             (3)  The symbol [eta] here represents the position of the mid-line of the sector expressed in terms of its 360° compass reading. This equation is illustrated in Figure 21. The values of [eta] for various zones are given in the upper right-hand corner of the form (Figure 20). The subsequent reductions of the equations, as they appear in the figure for four zones, are self-explanatory. The end result, representing the sector density, is entered in the rectangular box provided.  After all the sector densities have been computed, they are tabulated on a form for the \"Summary of Sector Densities\" (Figure 22). By totaling each vertical column, sums are obtained, expressing the Station Density or Station Magnitude for each hour.  An informative way of depicting the densities in each zone is to plot them as lines of thrust, as in Figure 23. Each sector is represented by the directional slant of its mid-line drawn to a length expressing the flight density per zone on some chosen scale, such as 100 birds per millimeter. Standard methods of vector analysis are then applied to find the vector resultant. This is done by considering the first two thrust lines as two sides of an imaginary parallelogram and using a drawing compass to draw intersecting arcs locating the position of the missing corner. In the same way, the third vector is combined with the invisible resultant whose distal end is represented by the intersection of the first two arcs. The process is repeated successively with each vector until all have been taken into consideration. The final intersection of arcs defines the length and slant of the Vector Resultant, whose magnitude expresses the Net Trend Density in terms of the original scale.  The final step in the processing of a set of observations is to plot on graph paper the nightly station density curve as illustrated by Figure 24.      [Illustration: FIG. 24. Nightly station density curve at        Progreso, Yucatán, on April 24-25, 1948.]     PART II. THE NATURE OF NOCTURNAL MIGRATION   Present day concepts of the whole broad problem of bird migration are made up of a few facts and many guesses.

I express elsewhere my indebtedness to a few French authors. I have also been greatly assisted in a variety of ways, but especially in the study of the older Paris streets, by my friend Mr. Frank Holford.       E. V. L.
