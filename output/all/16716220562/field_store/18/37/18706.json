You know he's got them.\"  \"In the name of the prophet, rats!\" answered the first mate, who was of a less fussy disposition. \"What a fatiguing creature you are, Brasyer! Don't you know the man's a boiler-maker by regular trade, and has only taken to stewardship for the last year or two? That sort of man doesn't like parting with his tools, and as he's a widower, with no home ashore, of course he has to carry all his traps aboard. Do shut up, and take your proper rest like a Christian. Here, I'll give you a cigar; it's all right--Burman; stick it in your mouth, and keep your jaw tight on it.\"  But there was no soothing the second officer. Still he prowled about the after orlop deck, and talked at large of his anxiety for the contents of the bullion-room. Once again, a few days later, as he approached the iron door, he was startled by the appearance of the captain coming, this time, _from_ the steward's pantry. He fancied he had heard tapping, Brasyer explained, and had come to investigate. But the captain turned him back with even less ceremony than before, swearing he would give charge of the bullion-room to another officer if Brasyer persisted in his eccentricities. On the first deck the second officer was met by the carpenter, a quiet, sleek, soft-spoken man, who asked him for the padlock and key he had borrowed from the stores during the week. But Brasyer put him off, promising to send it back later. And the carpenter trotted away to a job he happened to have, singularly enough, in the hold, just under the after orlop deck, and below the floor of the bullion-room.  As I have said, the voyage was in no way a pleasant one. Everywhere the weather was at its worst, and scarce was Gibraltar passed before the Lascars were shivering in their cotton trousers, and the Seedee boys were buttoning tight such old tweed jackets as they might muster from their scanty kits. It was January. In the Bay the weather was tremendous, and the _Nicobar_ banged and shook and pitched distractedly across in a howling world of thunderous green sea, washed within and without, above and below. Then, in the Chops, as night fell, something went, and there was no more steerage-way, nor, indeed, anything else but an aimless wallowing. The screw had broken.  The high sea had abated in some degree, but it was still bad. Such sail as the steamer carried, inadequate enough, was set, and shift was made somehow to worry along to Plymouth--or to Falmouth if occasion better served--by that means. And so the _Nicobar_ beat across the Channel on a rather better, though anything but smooth, sea, in a black night, made thicker by a storm of sleet, which turned gradually to snow as the hours advanced.  The ship laboured slowly ahead, through a universal blackness that seemed to stifle. Nothing but a black void above, below, and around, and the sound of wind and sea; so that one coming before a deck-light was startled by the quiet advent of the large snowflakes that came like moths as it seemed from nowhere. At four bells--two in the morning--a foggy light appeared away on the starboard bow--it was the Eddystone light--and an hour or two later, the exact whereabouts of the ship being a thing of much uncertainty, it was judged best to lay her to till daylight. No order had yet been given, however, when suddenly there were dim lights over the port quarter, with a more solid blackness beneath them. Then a shout and a thunderous crash, and the whole ship shuddered, and in ten seconds had belched up every living soul from below. The _Nicobar's_ voyage was over--it was a collision.  The stranger backed off into the dark, and the two vessels drifted apart, though not till some from the _Nicobar_ had jumped aboard the other. Captain Mackrie's presence of mind was wonderful, and never for a moment did he lose absolute command of every soul on board. The ship had already begun to settle down by the stern and list to port. Life-belts were served out promptly. Fortunately there were but two women among the passengers, and no children. The boats were lowered without a mishap, and presently two strange boats came as near as they dare from the ship (a large coasting steamer, it afterwards appeared) that had cut into the _Nicobar_. The last of the passengers were being got off safely, when Brasyer, running anxiously to the captain, said:--  \"Can't do anything with that bullion, can we, sir? Perhaps a box or two----\"  \"Oh, damn the bullion!\" shouted Captain Mackrie. \"Look after the boat, sir, and get the passengers off. The insurance companies can find the bullion for themselves.\"  But Brasyer had vanished at the skipper's first sentence. The skipper turned aside to the steward as the crew and engine-room staff made for the remaining boats, and the two spoke quietly together. Presently the steward turned away as if to execute an order, and the skipper continued in a louder tone:--  \"They're the likeliest stuff, and we can but drop 'em, at worst. But be slippy--she won't last ten minutes.\"  She lasted nearly a quarter of an hour. By that time, however, everybody was clear of her, and the captain in the last boat was only just near enough to see the last of her lights as she went down.   II.  The day broke in a sulky grey, and there lay the _Nicobar_, in ten fathoms, not a mile from the shore, her topmasts forlornly visible above the boisterous water. The sea was rough all that day, but the snow had ceased, and during the night the weather calmed considerably. Next day Lloyd's agent was steaming about in a launch from Plymouth, and soon a salvage company's tug came up and lay to by the emerging masts. There was every chance of raising the ship as far as could be seen, and a diver went down from the salvage tug to measure the breach made in the _Nicobar's_ side, in order that the necessary oak planking or sheeting might be got ready for covering the hole, preparatory to pumping and raising. This was done in a very short time, and the necessary telegrams having been sent, the tug remained in its place through the night, and prepared for the sending down of several divers on the morrow to get out the bullion as a commencement.  Just at this time Martin Hewitt happened to be engaged on a case of some importance and delicacy on behalf of Lloyd's Committee, and was staying for a few days at Plymouth. He heard the story of the wreck, of course, and speaking casually with Lloyd's agent as to the salvage work just beginning, he was told the name of the salvage company's representative on the tug, Mr. Percy Merrick--a name he immediately recognised as that of an old acquaintance of his own. So that on the day when the divers were at work in the bullion-room of the sunken _Nicobar_, Hewitt gave himself a holiday, and went aboard the tug about noon.  Here he found Merrick, a big, pleasant man of thirty-eight or so. He was very glad to see Hewitt, but was a great deal puzzled as to the results of the morning's work on the wreck. Two cases of gold bars were missing.  \"There was £200,000 worth of bullion on board,\" he said, \"that's plain and certain. It was packed in forty cases, each of £5,000 value. But now there are only thirty-eight cases! Two are gone clearly. I wonder what's happened?\"  \"I suppose your men don't know anything about it?\" asked Hewitt.  \"No, they're all right. You see, it's impossible for them to bring anything up without its being observed, especially as they have to be unscrewed from their diving-dresses here on deck. Besides, bless you, I was down with them.\"  \"Oh! Do you dive yourself, then?\"  \"Well, I put the dress on sometimes, you know, for any such special occasion as this. I went down this morning. There was no difficulty in getting about on the vessel below, and I found the keys of the bullion-room just where the captain said I would, in his cabin. But the locks were useless, of course, after being a couple of days in salt water. So we just burgled the door with crowbars, and then we saw that we might have done it a bit more easily from outside. For that coasting-steamer cut clean into the bunker next the bullion-room, and ripped open the sheet of boiler-plate dividing them.\"  \"The two missing cases couldn't have dropped out that way, of course?\"  \"Oh, no. We looked, of course, but it would have been impossible. The vessel has a list the other way--to starboard--and the piled cases didn't reach as high as the torn part. Well, as I said, we burgled the door, and there they were, thirty-eight sealed bullion cases, neither more nor less, and they're down below in the after-cabin at this moment. Come and see.\"  Thirty-eight they were; pine cases bound with hoop-iron and sealed at every joint, each case about eighteen inches by a foot, and six inches deep. They were corded together, two and two, apparently for convenience of transport.  \"Did you cord them like this yourself?\" asked Hewitt.  \"No, that's how we found 'em. We just hooked 'em on a block and tackle, the pair at a time, and they hauled 'em up here aboard the tug.\"  \"What have you done about the missing two--anything?\"  \"Wired off to headquarters, of course, at once. And I've sent for Captain Mackrie--he's still in the neighbourhood, I believe--and Brasyer, the second officer, who had charge of the bullion-room. They may possibly know something. Anyway, _one_ thing's plain. There were forty cases at the beginning of the voyage, and now there are only thirty-eight.\"  There was a pause; and then Merrick added, \"By the bye, Hewitt, this is rather your line, isn't it? You ought to look up these two cases.\"  Hewitt laughed. \"All right,\" he said; \"I'll begin this minute if you'll commission me.\"  \"Well,\" Merrick replied slowly, \"of course I can't do that without authority from headquarters. But if you've nothing to do for an hour or so there is no harm in putting on your considering cap, is there? Although, of course, there's nothing to go upon as yet. But you might listen to what"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37820"],["title","Chronicles of Martin Hewitt (#7)"],["body","and Brasyer have to say. Of course I don't know, but as it's a £10,000 question probably it might pay you, and if you _do_ see your way to anything I'd wire and get you commissioned at once.\"  There was a tap at the door and Captain Mackrie entered. \"Mr. Merrick?\" he said interrogatively, looking from one to another.  \"That's myself, sir,\" answered Merrick.  \"I'm Captain Mackrie, of the _Nicobar_. You sent for me, I believe. Something wrong with the bullion I'm told, isn't it?\"  Merrick explained matters fully. \"I thought perhaps you might be able to help us, Captain Mackrie. Perhaps I have been wrongly informed as to the number of cases that should have been there?\"  \"No; there were forty right enough. I think though--perhaps I might be able to give you a sort of hint.\"--and Captain Mackrie looked hard at Hewitt.  \"This is Mr. Hewitt, Captain Mackrie,\" Merrick interposed. \"You may speak as freely as you please before him. In fact, he's sort of working on the business, so to speak.\"  \"Well,\" Mackrie said, \"if that's so, speaking between ourselves, I should advise you to turn your attention to Brasyer. He was my second officer, you know, and had charge of the stuff.\"  \"Do you mean,\" Hewitt asked, \"that Mr. Brasyer might give us some useful information?\"  Mackrie gave an ugly grin. \"Very likely he might,\" he said, \"if he were fool enough. But I don't think you'd get much out of him direct. I meant you might watch him.\"  \"What, do you suppose he was concerned in any way with the disappearance of this gold?\"  \"I should think--speaking, as I said before, in confidence and between ourselves--that it's very likely indeed. I didn't like his manner all through the voyage.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Well, he was so eternally cracking on about his responsibility, and pretending to suspect the stokers and the carpenter, and one person and another, of trying to get at the bullion cases--that that alone was almost enough to make one suspicious. He protested so much, you see. He was so conscientious and diligent himself, and all the rest of it, and everybody else was such a desperate thief, and he was so sure there would be some of that bullion missing some day that--that--well, I don't know if I express his manner clearly, but I tell you I didn't like it a bit. But there was something more than that. He was eternally smelling about the place, and peeping in at the steward's pantry--which adjoins the bullion-room on one side, you know--and nosing about in the bunker on the other side. And once I actually caught him fitting keys to the padlocks--keys he'd borrowed from the carpenter's stores. And every time his excuse was that he fancied he heard somebody else trying to get in to the gold, or something of that sort; every time I caught him below on the orlop deck that was his excuse--happened to have heard something or suspected something or somebody every time. Whether or not I succeed in conveying my impressions to you, gentlemen, I can assure you that I regarded his whole manner and actions as very suspicious throughout the voyage, and I made up my mind I wouldn't forget it if by chance anything _did_ turn out wrong. Well, it has, and now I've told you what I've observed. It's for you to see if it will lead you anywhere.\"  \"Just so,\" Hewitt answered. \"But let me fully understand, Captain Mackrie. You say that Mr. Brasyer had charge of the bullion-room, but that he was trying keys on it from the carpenter's stores. Where were the legitimate keys then?\"  \"In my cabin. They were only handed out when I knew what they were wanted for. There was a Chubb's lock between the two padlocks, but a duplicate wouldn't have been hard for Brasyer to get. He could easily have taken a wax impression of my key when he used it at the port where we took the bullion aboard.\"  \"Well, and suppose he had taken these boxes, where do you think he would keep them?\"  Mackrie shrugged his shoulders and smiled. \"Impossible to say,\" he replied. \"He might have hidden 'em somewhere on board, though I don't think that's likely. He'd have had a deuce of a job to land them at Plymouth, and would have had to leave them somewhere while he came on to London. Bullion is always landed at Plymouth, you know, and if any were found to be missing, then the ship would be overhauled at once, every inch of her; so that he'd have to get his plunder ashore somehow before the rest of the gold was unloaded--almost impossible. Of course, if he's done that it's somewhere below there now, but that isn't likely. He'd be much more likely to have 'dumped' it--dropped it overboard at some well-known spot in a foreign port, where he could go later on and get it. So that you've a deal of scope for search, you see. Anywhere under water from here to Yokohama;\" and Captain Mackrie laughed.  Soon afterward he left, and as he was leaving a man knocked at the cabin door and looked in to say that Mr. Brasyer was on board. \"You'll be able to have a go at him now,\" said the captain. \"Good-day.\"  \"There's the steward of the _Nicobar_ there too, sir,\" said the man after the captain had gone, \"and the carpenter.\"  \"Very well, we'll see Mr. Brasyer first,\" said Merrick, and the man vanished. \"It seems to have got about a bit,\" Merrick went on to Hewitt. \"I only sent for Brasyer, but as these others have come, perhaps they've got something to tell us.\"  Brasyer made his appearance, overflowing with information. He required little assurance to encourage him to speak openly before Hewitt, and he said again all he had so often said before on board the _Nicobar_. The bullion-room was a mere tin box, the whole thing was as easy to get at as anything could be, he didn't wonder in the least at the loss--he had prophesied it all along.  The men whose movements should be carefully watched, he said, were the captain and the steward. \"Nobody ever heard of a captain and a steward being so thick together before,\" he said. \"The steward's pantry was next against the bullion-room, you know, with nothing but that wretched bit of three-eighths boiler plate between. You wouldn't often expect to find the captain down in the steward's pantry, would you, thick as they might be. Well, that's where I used to find him, time and again. And the steward kept boiler-makers' tools there! That I can swear to. And he's been a boiler-maker, so that, likely as not, he could open a joint somewhere and patch it up again neatly so that it wouldn't be noticed. He was always messing about down there in his pantry, and once I distinctly heard knocking there, and when I went down to see, whom should I meet? Why, the skipper, coming away from the place himself, and he bullyragged me for being there and sent me on deck. But before that he bullyragged me because I had found out that there were other keys knocking about the place that fitted the padlocks on the bullion-room door. Why should he slang and threaten me for looking after these things and keeping my eye on the bullion-room, as was my duty? But that was the very thing that he didn't like. It was enough for him to see me anxious about the gold to make him furious. Of course his character for meanness and greed is known all through the company's service--he'll do anything to make a bit.\"  \"But have you any positive idea as to what has become of the gold?\"  \"Well,\" Brasyer replied, with a rather knowing air, \"I don't think they've dumped it.\"  \"Do you mean you think it's still in the vessel--hidden somewhere?\"  \"No, I don't. I believe the captain and the steward took it ashore, one case each, when we came off in the boats.\"  \"But wouldn't that be noticed?\"  \"It needn't be, on a black night like that. You see, the parcels are not so big--look at them, a foot by a foot and a half by six inches or so, roughly. Easily slipped under a big coat or covered up with anything. Of course they're a bit heavy--eighty or ninety pounds apiece altogether--but that's not much for a strong man to carry--especially in such a handy parcel, on a black night, with no end of confusion on. Now you just look here--I'll tell you something. The skipper went ashore last in a boat that was sent out by the coasting steamer that ran into us. That ship's put into dock for repairs and her crew are mostly having an easy time ashore. Now I haven't been asleep this last day or two, and I had a sort of notion there might be some game of this sort on, because when I left the ship that night I thought we might save a little at least of the stuff, but the skipper wouldn't let me go near the bullion-room, and that seemed odd. So I got hold of one of the boat's crew that fetched the skipper ashore, and questioned him quietly--pumped him, you know--and he assures me that the skipper _did_ have a rather small, heavy sort of parcel with him. What do you think of that? Of course, in the circumstances, the man couldn't remember any very distinct particulars, but he thought it was a sort of square wooden case about the size I've mentioned. But there's something more.\" Brasyer lifted his fore-finger and then brought it down on the table before him--\"something more. I've made inquiries at the railway station and I find that two heavy parcels were sent off yesterday to London--deal boxes wrapped in brown paper, of just about the right size. And the paper got torn before the things were sent off, and the clerk could see that the boxes inside were fastened with hoop-iron--like those!\" and the second officer pointed triumphantly to the boxes piled at one side of the cabin.  \"Well done!\" said Hewitt. \"You're quite a smart detective. Did you find out who brought the parcels, and who they were addressed to?\"  \"No, I couldn't get quite as far as that. Of course the clerk didn't know the names of the senders, and not knowing me, wouldn't tell me exactly where the parcels were going. But I got quite chummy with him after a bit, and I'm going to meet him presently--he has the afternoon off, and we're going for a stroll. I'll find something more, I'll"]]]
