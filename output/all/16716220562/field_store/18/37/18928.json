From _B. m. pallidus_, _B. m. brunneus_ differs in: dorsal, lateral, and facial coloration deeper reddish brown, more melanins present; venter darker; buff gray rather than whitish buff to gray as in paratypical series; vibrissae black rather than brownish to white; tail sooty, less flesh-colored; forefeet and hind feet averaging slightly grayer; most external and cranial dimensions averaging slightly larger; nasals less attenuated; presphenoid less hour-glass shaped, sides more nearly straight.  From _B. m. infernatis_, _B. m. brunneus_ differs in: side of face and neck deep reddish-brown rather than yellowish-gray (the differences in dorsal colorations are greater between _brunneus_ and _infernatis_ than between _brunneus_ and _pallidus_); venter darker buff-gray; tail brownish rather than flesh-colored; forefeet and hind feet average slightly grayer; most external dimensions averaging slightly larger; cranial dimensions nearly the same except length of incisive foramina, which is smaller; presphenoid differs in much the same way as from pallidus.  _Remarks_.--Specimens from Chichicaxtle, Puente Nacional, 3 km. W Boca del Río, 1 km. E. Mecayucan, and Río Blanco (20 km. WNW Piedras Negras), are all paler than the paratypical series and other specimens from within the assigned range of _B. m. brunneus_. All these specimens from the coastal plain average considerably paler than those from the front range and slopes of the mountains. Specimens from Puente Nacional are intermediate in color between paler, grayish brown, specimens from the coastal plains and the darker, brown, specimens from the mountains. When Allen and Chapman (1897:203) described _brunneus_, they did so on the basis of the darker brown mice from the higher altitudes. The name, _brunneus_, _sensu stricto_, could be restricted to those mice from the higher altitudes of central Veracruz. However, when the mice of intermediate color from Puente Nacional are considered, it seems best to include the material from the coastal plain with _brunneus_. Crania from the higher altitudes are slightly larger than, but not significantly different from, crania of specimens from the coastal plains. Specimens examined from the coastal plains resemble the darker series of _B. m. pallidus_ to the west in central México. But there is no evidence of gene flow between the paler coastal specimens and _B. m. pallidus_ to the west. In fact, these paler brown mice on the coastal plain grade in color into the darker brown mice from the mountains. The paler mice from the coast may be an incipient subspecies.  The type and paratypes seem to have faded somewhat since they were described by Allen and Chapman (_loc. cit._) and by Osgood (1909:259). However, the color of the paratypes and other specimens herein assigned is the feature most useful for distinguishing _brunneus_ from all other subspecies of _B. musculus_.  _Specimens examined._--Total 187 all from VERACRUZ, Republic of México, and distributed as follows: type locality, 4400 ft., 16[1] (including the type), 6[2], 1[3]; _Cerro Gordo_, 1500 ft., 19; _Teocelo_ [= _Texolo_], 4500 ft., 1; _2 mi.

Coll.); Comayabuela [= Comayaguela] just south of Tegucigalpa, 3100 feet, Honduras; obtained on March 6, 1932, by C. F. Underwood, original number 838.  _Range._--Central to south-central Guatemala, east to south-central Honduras. Zonal range: Lower parts of the Merendon Biotic Province of Smith (1949:235). Occurs from 3200 feet at a place 1/2 mi. N and 1 mi. W Salama, Guatemala, up to approximately 4500 feet at Monte Redondo, Guatemala.  _Diagnosis._--Size medium to small for the species; general ground color of dorsum between Olive Brown and Buffy Brown; distal fourth of individual guard hairs of dorsum black-tipped, proximal three-fourths gray, underfur black-tipped with subterminal band of Vinaceous-Buff, gray basally; facial region below eye Olive-Buff to Deep Olive-Buff; regions of flanks without black-tipped guard hairs, therefore, appearing paler brownish-buff than dorsum; venter Pale Olive-Buff to whitish in midline, hairs there white to base, laterally grayish basally; hairs in region of throat and chin resemble those of underparts; forefeet and hind feet flesh-colored with grayish suffusion; ears dusky brown; tail almost unicolored, slightly darker brown above than below; coronoid process less acutely falcate than in other subspecies; zygoma bowed. Average and extreme external and cranial measurements of 14 adults from La Piedra de Jesús Sabana Grande, Honduras, are as follows: Total length, 110.7 (100-123); length of tail vertebrae, 44.0 (32-55); length of body, 66.7 (60-70); length of hind foot, 14.1 (12-15); length of ear from notch, 11.8 (10-13); occipitonasal length, 19.3 (18.9-19.8); zygomatic breadth, 10.1 (9.8-10.4); postpalatal length, 6.8 (6.2-7.3); least interorbital breadth, 3.9 (3.8-4.1); length of incisive foramina, 4.3 (4.0-4.5); length of rostrum, 6.9 (6.6-7.2); breadth of braincase, 9.6 (9.2-10.1); depth of cranium, 7.0 (6.8-7.3); alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row, 3.2 (3.0-3.4); for photographs of skull, see Plate 1_b_, and Plate 3_b_.  _Comparisons._--For comparisons with _B. m. pullus_ and _B. m. handleyi_, see accounts of those subspecies. From _B. m. nigrescens_, _B. m. grisescens_ differs in: dorsum less blackish (dark brown to buffy); face buffy below eye rather than brownish-black; venter buffy to whitish in midline, not sooty gray; forefeet and hind feet flesh-colored with gray overtones, not dusky to sooty; zygoma bowed, sides less parallel; braincase and bony palate slightly broader.  _Remarks._--Goodwin (1942:160) mentioned that a specimen from the type locality of _grisescens_ was as dark as specimens of _B. m. nigrescens_ from Guatemala. However, all specimens from Guatemala, other than those from Sacapulas, were referred by Goodwin (1934:40) to _B. m. nigrescens_. My studies reveal a grayish-brown population in central Honduras near to and including the type locality. This population appears to grade into a slightly paler, particularly as concerns color of hind foot and tail, group of Guatemalan mice from 1 mi. S Rabinal, from 1/2 mi. N, 1 mi. E Salama, and from Lake Atescatempa. Specimens from western Guatemala at Nentón and Jacaltenango, on the other hand, are darker brownish-black, more nearly like the paratypical series of _nigrescens_ from the Valley of Comitán, Chiapas, Republic of México. This darker brownish-black color of the back persists in specimens from southern Guatemala and El Salvador (see specimens examined of _B. m. nigrescens_ for localities), and they are best referred to _nigrescens_. _B. m. grisescens_, in color and certain cranial characters, therefore, seems to grade into two different subspecies: (1) _B. m. handleyi_, pale mice in the Río Negro valley in central Guatemala, and (2) _B. m. nigrescens_, dark mice from southern Guatemala, and parts of El Salvador.  Felten (1958:136) referred all _B. musculus_ from El Salvador to _B. m. grisescens_. Although I have not examined the specimens reported on by Felten (_loc. cit._), I have examined specimens from Lake Atescatempa, Guatemala (which I refer to _grisescens_), not too distant from Cerro Blanco, and Finca Las Canarias, Department of Ahuachapan, and Laguna de Guija, Department of Santa Ana (localities listed by Felten). It would seem that specimens from these localities might indeed be _grisescens_. However, specimens that I examined from 1 mi. S Los Planes, and 1 mi. NW San Salvador were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38296"],["title","Wild Adventures round the Pole (#0)"],["body","Adventures round the Pole The Cruise of the \"Snowbird\" Crew in the \"Arrandoon\" By Gordon Stables Published by Hodder and Stoughton, 27 Paternoster Row, London.

CHAPTER ONE.  THE TWIN RIVERS--A BUSY SCENE--OLD FRIENDS WITH NEW FACES--THE BUILDING OF THE GREAT SHIP--PEOPLE'S OPINIONS--RALPH'S HIGHLAND HOME.  Wilder scenery there is in abundance in Scotland, but hardly will you find any more picturesquely beautiful than that in which the two great rivers, the Clyde and the Tweed, first begin their journey seawards.  It is a classic land, there is poetry in every breath you breathe, the very air seems redolent of romance.  Here Coleridge, Scott, and Burns roved. Wilson loved it well, and on yonder hills Hogg, the Bard of Ettrick--he who \"taught the wandering winds to sing\"--fed his flocks.  It is a land, too, not only of poetic memories, but one dear to all who can appreciate daring deeds done in a good cause, and who love the name of hero.  If the reader saw the rivers we have just named, as they roll their waters majestically into the ocean, the one at Greenock, the other near the quaint old town of Berwick, he would hardly believe that at the commencement of their course they are so small and narrow that ordinary-sized men can step across them, that bare-legged little boys wade through them, and thrust their arms under their green banks, bringing therefrom many a lusty trout.  But so it is.  Both rise in the same district, within not very many miles of each other, and for a considerable distance they follow the same direction and flow north.  But soon the Tweed gets very faint-hearted indeed.  \"The country is getting wilder and wilder,\" she says to her companion, \"we'll never be able to do it.  I'm going south and east.  It is easier.\"  \"And I,\" says the bold Clyde, \"am going northwards and west; it is more difficult, and therein lies the enjoyment.  I will conquer every obstacle, I'll defy everything that comes against me, and thus I'll be a mightier river than you.  I'll water great cities, and on my broad breast I will bear proud navies to the ocean, to do battle against wind and wave.  `Faint heart never won fair lady.'  Farewell, friend Tweed, farewell.\"  And so they part.  This conversation between the two rivers is held fourteen hundred feet above the level of the sea, and five score miles and over have to be traversed before the Clyde can reach it.  Yet, nothing daunted, merrily on she rolls, gaining many an accession of strength on the way from streams and burns.  \"If you are going seaward,\" say these burns, \"so are we, so we'll take the liberty of joining you.\"  \"And right welcome you are,\" sings the Clyde; \"in union lies strength.\"  In union lies strength; yes, and in union is happiness too, it would seem, for the Clyde, broader and stronger now, glides peacefully and silently onwards; or if not quite silently, it emits but a silvery murmur of content.  Past green banks and wooded braes, through daisied fields where cattle feed, through lonely moorlands heather-clad, now hidden in forest depths, now out again into the broad light of day, sweeping past villages, cottages, mansions, and castles, homes of serf and feudal lord in times long past and gone, with many a sweep and many a curve it reaches the wildest part of its course.  Here it must rush, the rapids and go tumbling and roaring over the lynns, with a noise that may be heard for miles on a still night, with an impetuosity that shakes the earth for hundreds of yards on every side.  \"I wonder how old Tweed is getting on?\" thinks our brave river as soon as it has cleared the rocks and rapids and pauses for breath.  But the Clyde will soon be rewarded for its pluck and its daring, before long it will enter and sweep through the second city of the empire, the great metropolis of the west; but ere it does so, forgive it, if it lingers awhile at Bothwell, and if it seems sullen and sad as it dashes underneath the ancient bridge where, in days long gone, so fierce a fight took place that five hundred of the brave Covenanters lay dead on the field of battle.  And pardon it when anon it makes a grand and splendid sweep round Bothwell Bank, as if loth to leave it.  Yonder are the ruins of the ancient castle--    \"Where once proud Murray held the festive board.   *****   But where are now the festive board,   The martial throng, and midnight song?   Ah! ivy binds the mouldering walls,   And ruin reigns in Bothwell's halls.   O, deep and long have slumbered now   The cares that knit the soldier's brow,   The lovely grace, the manly power,   In gilded hall and lady's bower;   The tears that fell from beauty's eye,   The broken heart, the bitter sigh,   E'en deadly feuds have passed away,   Still thou art lovely in decay.\"  But see, our river has left both beauty and romance far behind it.  It has entered the city--the city of merchant princes, the city of a thousand palaces; it bears itself more steadily now, for hath not Queen Commerce deigned to welcome it, and entrusted to it the floating wealth of half a nation?  The river is in no hurry to leave this fair city.  \"My noble queen,\" it seems to say, \"I am at your service.  I come from the far-off hills to obey your high behests.  My ambition is fulfilled, do with me as you will.\"  But soon as the bustle and din of the city are led behind, soon as the grand old hills begin to appear on the right, and glimpses of green on the southern banks, lo! the tide comes up to welcome the noble river; and so the Clyde falls silently and imperceptibly into the mighty Atlantic.  Yet scarcely is the lurid and smoky atmosphere that hangs pall-like over the town exchanged for the purer, clearer air beyond, hardly have the waters from the distant mountains begun to mingle with ocean's brine, ere the noise of ten thousand hammers seems to rend the very sky.  Clang, clang, clang, clang--surely the ancient god Vulcan has reappeared, and taken up his abode by the banks of the river.  Clang, clang, clang.  See yonder is the _Iona_, churning the water into foam with her swift-revolving paddles.  She has over a thousand passengers on board; they are bound for the Highlands, bent on pleasure.  But this terrible noise and din of hammers--they will have three long miles of it before they can even converse in comfort.  Clang, clang, clang--it is no music to them.  Nay, but to many it is.  It is music to the merchant prince, for yonder lordly ship, when she is launched from the slips, will sail far over the sea, and bring him back wealth from many a foreign shore.  It is music to the naval officer; it tells him his ship is preparing, that ere long she will be ready for sea, that his white flag will be unfurled to the breeze, and that he will walk her decks--her proud commander.  And it is music--merry music to the ears of two individuals at least, who are destined to play a very prominent part in this story.  They are standing on the quarter-deck of a half-completed ship, while clang, clang, clang, go the hammers outside and inside.  The younger of the two--he can be but little over twenty-three--with folded arms, is leaning carelessly against the bulwarks.  Although there is a thoughtful look upon his handsome face, there is a smile as well, a smile of pleasure.  He is taller by many inches than his companion, though by no means better \"built,\" as sailors call it.  This companion has a bold, brown, weather-beaten face, the lower half of it buried in a beard that is slightly tinged with grey; his eyes are clear and honest,--eyes that you can tell at a glance would not flinch to meet even death itself.  He stands bold, erect, firm.  Both are dressed well, but there is a marked difference in the style of their attire.  The garments of the elder pronounce him at once just what he is,--one who has been \"down to the sea in ships.\"  The younger is dressed in the fashionable attire of an English gentleman.  To say more were needless. A minute observer, however, might have noticed that there was a slight air of _neglige_ about him, if only in the unbuttoned coat or the faultless hat pushed back off the brow.  \"And so you tell me,\" said the younger, \"that the work still goes bravely on?\"  \"Ay, that it does,\" said his companion; \"there have been rumours of a strike for higher wages among the men of other yards, but none, I am proud to say, in this.\"  \"And still,\" continued the former, \"we pay but a fraction of wage more than other people, and then, of course, there is the extra weekly half-holiday.\"  \"There is something more, Ralph--forgive me if I call you Ralph, in memory of dear old times.  You will always be a boy to me, and I could no more call you Mr Leigh than I could fly.\"  Ralph grasped his companion by the hand; the action was but momentary, but it showed a deal of kindly feeling.  \"Always call me Ralph,\" he said, \"always, McBain, always.  When we are back once more at sea I'll call you captain, not till then.  But what is the something more that makes our men so happy?\"  \"Why, your kindly manner, Ralph boy.  You mix with them, you talk with them, and take an interest in all their doings, and you positively seem to know every one of them by name.  Mind you, that extra half-holiday isn't thrown away: they work all the harder, and they are happy.  Why, listen to them now.\"  He paused, and held up one hand.  From bows to stern of the vessel there arose the sound of industry, incessant, continual; but high over the clang of hammers and the grating noise of saws there arose the voice of song.  \"They sing, you see,\" continued McBain; \"but they don't put down their tools to sing.  But here comes old Ap.  What cheer, Mr Ap Ewen?\"  Those of my readers who knew Ap as "]]]
