The other cottonmouth contained one juvenile pond      turtle, _Pseudemys scripta_....\"       Texas: \"... several ... feeding on frogs.... One ... found DOR      was found to contain a large catfish.\" (Guidry, 1953:54.)  Of 246 cottonmouths that I examined for food items, only 46 contained prey in their digestive tracts. Almost all of the snakes examined were museum specimens that had been collected at many places over a period of about 40 years. It was not known how long each had been kept alive before being preserved. Therefore it was impossible to determine what proportion of any population of cottonmouths could be expected to contain food. The food items were not analyzed numerically because the scales and hair, by means of which many food items in the intestine were identified, yielded no clue as to the number of individuals actually present unless several distinct kinds were found. Each occurrence of scales or hair was thus recorded as a single individual, although some such occurrences may have represented more than one animal. The contents of some stomachs were so well digested that it was difficult to determine the number of items present. As a rule only one food item was present in a digestive tract, but a few tracts contained several items of the same or different species. Three frogs (_Acris crepitans_) were in one snake and three hylas (_Hyla versicolor_) in another. Still another individual captured beside a drying pond contained six individuals of _Lepomis_ each about three inches long and two pikes (_Esox_) about six inches long.

Most of the unidentifiable matter could be assumed to consist of remains of amphibians, since they leave no hard parts. If this assumption is correct, amphibians comprise about 40 per cent of the diet. Since intestinal contents were included, a volumetric analysis was not feasible. Therefore, the weight of each type of food item was estimated and the percentage by bulk calculated from it (Table 13).  Pieces of dead leaves and small sticks constituted most of the plant material found and presumably were ingested secondarily because they adhered to the moist skin of the prey, especially to fish and amphibians. However, some plant materials probably are eaten because they have acquired the odor of the prey. One cottonmouth contained a _Hyla cinerea_, several leaves, and five sticks from 37 to 95 millimeters long and from 12 to 14 millimeters in diameter.  Most reports in the literature state that gravid females do not feed, but four gravid females examined by me containing large, well-developed embryos also contained evidences of having recently fed. Two of them had scales of snakes in the stomach or intestine, one contained a six-inch _Lepomis_, and the other had hair in the intestine and the head and neck of an adult egret in the stomach.     MORTALITY FACTORS  Natural Enemies and Predators   Published records of other animals preying on cottonmouths or killing them are few. Reptiles more often than other classes of vertebrates prey on the cottonmouth. McIlhenny (1935:44) reported on the scarcity of snakes in areas where alligators were present. Predation on cottonmouths by indigo snakes (_Drymarchon corais_) was reported by Conant (1958:153) and Lee (1964:32). Allen and Swindell (1948:6) obtained a photograph of a king-snake (_Lampropeltis getulus_) killing a cottonmouth but thought that moccasins are not eaten by _L. getulus_. However, one occasion reported herein shows that cottonmouths are eaten by king-snakes; and Clark (1949:252) reported finding 13 cottonmouths, along with other prey, in the stomach contents of 301 king-snakes (_L. g. holbrooki_) from northwestern Louisiana. Cannibalism is also common among cottonmouths. Klauber (1956:1058;1079) cited predation on cottonmouths by a blue heron (_Ardea herodias_) and a largemouth bass (_Micropterus salmoides_). Man is probably the greatest enemy of the cottonmouth. Intentional killing, capturing, road kills, and alteration of the environment destroy large numbers.   Parasites and Diseases  Allen and Swindell (1948:12) listed several diseases and parasites of snakes and stated that \"some moccasins captured in the woods are so poor and weak from parasitic infection that they can barely crawl.\" The only kind of ectoparasite found on captive cottonmouths in the course of my study was a snake mite, _Ophionyssus natricus_. An infestation of that mite was thought to be partly responsible for the death of one captive moccasin. Other moccasins spent increasing amounts of time in their water dish after they became infected with mites. Under natural conditions frequent swimming probably keeps cottonmouths nearly free of mites.  Endoparasites found included lung flukes, stomach nematodes, and tapeworms. Lung flukes (_Ochetosoma_ sp.) were found in 16 of 20 captive cottonmouths. Snails and frogs serve as intermediate hosts for various stages in the life cycle of these flukes. The high percentage of cottonmouths infested with flukes is indicative of the use of frogs as a major source of food. Less than ten flukes were usually observed in the snakes' mouths but occasionally more were seen. One snake was observed thrashing about in its cage for nearly an hour, after which time it died. Upon examination of the mouth, 32 flukes were found, most of which were located in the Jacobson's organs. Whether or not flukes caused the death is not known. Nematodes (_Kalicephalus_ sp.) were found in the stomach of each of several preserved specimens; most of these snakes had no food in their digestive tracts. In a high percentage of the moccasins, tapeworms (_Ophiotaenia_ sp.) were in the duodenum, in many instances so tightly packed as seemingly to prevent passage of food. The importance of fish in the diet is reflected by the high percentage of snakes containing tapeworms. An unidentified cyst (?) about an inch long and containing two hooks on one end was found attached to the outer wall of the stomach of a cottonmouth. Yamaguti (1958) listed all the kinds of helminths known from cottonmouths.   Miscellaneous Causes of Death  Munro (1949:71-72) reported on the lethal effect of 10 per cent DDT powder on two young cottonmouths which were dusted with it to kill mites. Herald (1949:117) reported an equal effect caused by spraying a five per cent DDT solution in a room with several snakes. All but three large cottonmouths, which were under shelter at the time of spraying, were killed.

In our teaching of plastic anatomy, especially at the École des Beaux-Arts--where, for the past nine years, we have had the very great honour of supplementing the teaching of our distinguished master, Mathias Duval, after having been prosector for his course of lectures since 1881--it is our practice to give, as a complement to the study of human anatomy, a certain number of lessons on the anatomy of those animals which artists might be called on to represent.  Now, we were given to understand that the subject treated in our lectures interested our hearers, so much so that we were not surprised to learn that a certain number repeatedly expressed a desire to see these lectures united in book form.  To us this idea was not new; for many years the work in question had been in course of preparation, and we had collected materials for it, with the object of filling up a void of which the existence was to be regretted. But our many engagements prevented us from executing our project as early as we would have wished. It is this work which we publish to-day.  [Illustration: FIG. I.--REPRODUCTION OF A SKETCH BY BARYE (COLLECTIONS OF THE ANATOMICAL MUSEUM OF THE ÉCOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS--HUGUIER MUSEUM).]  Putting aside for a moment the wish expressed by our hearers, we feel ourselves in duty bound to inquire whether the utility of this publication is self-evident. Let it be clearly understood that we wish to express here our opinion on this subject, while putting aside every personal sentiment of an author.  No one now disputes the value of anatomical studies made in view of carrying out the artistic representation of man. Nevertheless--for we must provide against all contingencies--the conviction on this subject may be more or less absolute; and yet it must possess this character in an intense degree in order that these studies may be profitable, and permit the attainment of the goal which is proposed in undertaking them. It is in this way that we ever strive to train the students whose studies we direct; not only to admit the value of these studies, but to be materially and deeply convinced of the fact without any restriction. Such is the sentiment which we endeavour to create and vigorously encourage. And we may be permitted to add that we have often been successful in this direction.  Therefore it is that, at the beginning of our lectures, and in anticipation of possible objections, we are accustomed to take up the question of the utility of plastic anatomy. And in so doing, it is in order to combat at the outset the idea--as mischievous as it is false--which is sometimes imprudently enunciated, that the possession of scientific knowledge is likely to tarnish the purity and freshness of the impressions received by the artist, and to place shackles on the emotional sincerity of their representation.  [Illustration: FIG. II.--REPRODUCTION OF A SKETCH OF BARYE (COLLECTIONS OF THE ANATOMICAL MUSEUM OF THE ÉCOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS--HUGUIER MUSEUM).]  It is chiefly by employment of examples that we approach the subject. These strike the imagination of the student more forcibly, and the presentation of models of a certain choice, although rough in execution, is, in our opinion, preferable to considerations of an order possibly more exalted, but of a character less clearly practical. Let us, then, ask the question: Those artists whose eminence nobody would dare to question, did they study anatomy? If the answer be in the affirmative, we surely cannot permit ourselves to believe that we can dispense with a similar course. And, as proof of the studies of this class which the masters have made, we may cite Raphael, Michelangelo, and, above all, Leonardo da Vinci; and, of the moderns, Géricault. And we may more clearly define these proofs by an examination of the reproductions of their anatomical works, chosen from certain of their special writings.[1]    [1] Mathias Duval and A. Bical, 'L'anatomie des Maîtres.'

The manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci of the Royal Library,       Windsor, 'Anatomy, Foliæ A.,' published by Théodore Sabachnikoff,       with a French translation, written and annotated by Giovanni       Piumati, with an introduction by Mathias Duval.

Accordingly, there is no scope for serious discussion, and it only remains for us to enunciate the opinion that it is necessary that we should imitate those masters, and, with a sense of respectful discipline, follow their example.  Here, with regard to the anatomy of animals, we pursue the same method, and the example chosen shall be that of Barye. His talent is too far above all criticism to allow that this example should be refused. The admiration which the works of this great artist elicit is too wide-spread for us to remain uninfluenced by the lessons furnished by his studies. It is sufficient to see the sketches relating to these studies, and his admirable casts from nature which form part of the anatomical museum of the École des Beaux-Arts, to be convinced that the artistic temperament, of which Barye was one of the most brilliant examples, has nothing to lose by its association with researches the precision of which might seem likely to check its complete expansion.  [Illustration: FIG. III.--REPRODUCTION OF A SKETCH OF BARYE (COLLECTIONS OF THE ANATOMICAL MUSEUM OF THE ÉCOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS--HUGUIER MUSEUM).]  In those sketches we find proofs of observation so scrupulous that we cannot restrain our admiration for the man whose ardent imagination was voluntarily subjected to the toil of study so profound.  If the example of Barye, with whom we associate the names of other great modern painters of animals, can determine the conviction which we seek to produce, we shall be sincerely glad. To contribute to the propagation of useful ideas, and to see them accepted, gives a feeling of satisfaction far too legitimate for us to hesitate to say what we should feel if our hope be realized in this instance.
