Rameau was in his service as household clavecinist and set Voltaire's poem. The authors looked forward to a production on the stage of the Grand Opera, where at least two Biblical operas, an Old Testament \"Jephte\" and a New Testament \"Enfant prodigue\" were current; but Rameau had powerful enemies, and the opera was prohibited on the eve of the day on which it was to have been performed. The composer had to stomach his mortification as best he could; he put some of his Hebrew music into the service of his Persian \"Zoroastre\". The other French Samson to whom I have re ferred had also to undergo a sea-change like unto Rameau's, Rossini's Moses, and Verdi's Nebuchadnezzar. Duprez, who was ambitious to shine as a composer as well as a singer (he wrote no less than eight operas and also an oratorio, \"The Last Judgment\"), tried his hand on a Samson opera and succeeded in enlisting the help of Dumas the elder in writing the libretto. When he was ready to present it at the door of the Grand Opera the Minister of Fine Arts told him that it was impracticable, as the stage-setting of the last act alone would cost more than 100,000 francs, Duprez then followed the example set with Rossini's \"Mose\" in London and changed the book to make it tell a story of the crusades which he called \"Zephora\". Nevertheless the original form was restored in German and Italian translations of the work, and it had concert performances in 1857. To Joachim Raff was denied even this poor comfort. He wrote a German \"Simson\" between 1851 and 1857. The conductor at Darmstadt to whom it was first submitted rejected it on the ground that it was too difficult for his singers. Raff then gave it to Liszt, with whom he was sojourning at Weimar, and who had taken pity on his \"Konig Alfred\"; but the tenor singer at the Weimar opera said the music was too high for the voice. Long afterward Wagner's friend, Schnorr von Carolsfeld, saw the score in the hands of the composer. The heroic stature of the hero delighted him, and his praise moved Raff to revise the opera; but before this had been done Schnorr died of the cold contracted while creating the role of Wagner's Tristan at Munich in 1865. Thus mournfully ended the third episode. As late as 1882 Raff spoke of taking the opera in hand again, but though he may have done so his death found the work unperformed and it has not yet seen the light of the stage-lamps.  Saint-Saens's opera has also passed through many vicissitudes, but has succumbed to none and is probably possessed of more vigorous life now than it ever had. It is the recognized operatic masterpiece of the most resourceful and fecund French musician since Berlioz. Saint-Saens began the composition of \"Samson et Dalila\" in 1869. The author of the book, Ferdinand Lemaire, was a cousin of the composer. Before the breaking out of the Franco-Prussian War the score was so far on the way to completion that it was possible to give its second act a private trial. This was done, an incident of the occasion-which afterward introduced one element of pathos in its history-being the singing of the part of Samson by the painter Henri Regnault, who soon after lost his life in the service of his country. A memorial to him and the friendship which existed between him and the composer is the \"Marche Heroique,\" which bears the dead man's name on its title-page. Toward the end of 1872 the opera was finished. For two years the score rested in the composer's desk. Then the second act was again brought forth for trial, this time at the country home of Mme. Viardot, at Croissy, the illustrious hostess singing the part of Dalila. In 1875 the first act was performed in concert style by M. Edouard Colonne in Paris. Liszt interested himself in the opera and secured its acceptance at the Grand Ducal Opera House of Weimar, where Eduard Lassen brought it out on December 2, 1877. Brussels heard it in 1878; but it did not reach one of the theatres of France until March 3, 1890, when Rouen produced it at its Theatre des Arts under the direction of M. Henri Verdhurt. It took nearly seven months more to reach Paris, where the first representation was at the Eden Theatre on October 31 of the same year. Two years later, after it had been heard in a number of French and Italian provincial theatres, it was given at the Academie Nationale de Musique under the direction of M. Colonne. The part of Dalila was taken by Mme. Deschamps-Jehin, that of Samson by M. Vergnet, that of the High Priest by M. Lassalle. Eight months before this it had been performed as an oratorio by the Oratorio Society of New York. There were two performances, on March 25 and 26, 1892, the conductor being Mr. Walter Damrosch and the principal singers being Frau Marie Ritter-Goetze, Sebastian Montariol, H. E. Distelhurst, Homer Moore, Emil Fischer, and Purdon Robinson. London had heard the work twice as an oratorio before it had a stage representation there on April 26, 1909, but this performance was fourteen years later than the first at the Metropolitan Opera House on February 8, 1895. The New York performance was scenically inadequate, but the integrity of the record demands that the cast be given here: Samson, Signor Tamagno; Dalila, Mme. Mantelli; High Priest, Signor Campanari; Abimelech and An Old Hebrew, M. Plancon; First Philistine, Signor Rinaldini; Second Philistme, Signor de Vachetti; conductor, Signor Mancinelli. The Metropolitan management did not venture upon a repetition until the opening night of the season 1915-1916, when its success was such that it became an active factor in the repertory of the establishment; but by that time it had been made fairly familiar to the New York public by performances at the Manhattan Opera House under the management of Mr. Oscar Hammerstein, the first of which took place on November 13, 1908. Signor Campanini conducted and the cast embraced Mme. Gerville-Reache as Dalila, Charles Dalmores as Samson, and M. Dufranne as High Priest. The cast at the Metropolitan Opera House's revival of the opera on November 15,1915, was as follows: Dalila, Mme. Margarete Matzenauer; Samson, Signor Enrico Caruso; High Priest, Signor Pasquale Amato; Abimelech, Herr Carl Schlegel; An Old Hebrew, M. Leon Rothier; A Philistine Messenger, Herr Max Bloch; First Philistine, Pietro Audisio; Second Philistine, Vincenzo Reschiglian; conductor, Signor Polacco.    It would be a curious inquiry to try to determine the source of the fascination which the story of Manoah's son has exerted upon mankind for centuries. It bears a likeness to the story of the son of Zeus and Alcmene, and there are few books on mythology which do not draw a parallel between the two heroes. Samson's story is singularly brief. For twenty years he \"judged Israel,\" but the Biblical history which deals with him consists only of an account of his birth, a recital of the incidents in which he displayed his prodigious strength and valor, the tale of his amours, and, at the end, the account of his tragical destruction, brought about by the weak element in his character.  Commentators have been perplexed by the tale, irrespective of the adornments which it has received at the hands of the Talmudists. Is Samson a Hebrew form of the conception personified by the Greek Herakles? Is he a mythical creature, born in the human imagination of primitive nature worship--a variant of the Tyrian sun-god Shemesh, whose name his so curiously resembles? [In Hebrew he is called Shimshon, and the sun shemesh.] Was he something more than a man of extraordinary physical strength and extraordinary moral weakness, whose patriotic virtues and pathetic end have kept his memory alive through the ages? Have a hundred generations of men to whom the story of Herakles has appeared to be only a fanciful romance, the product of that imagination heightened by religion which led the Greeks to exalt their supreme heroes to the extent of deification, persisted in hearing and telling the story of Samson with a sympathetic interest which betrays at least a sub-conscious belief in its verity? Is the story only a parable enforcing a moral lesson which is as old as humanity? If so, how got it into the canonical Book of Judges, which, with all its mythical and legendary material, seems yet to contain a large substratum of unquestionable history?  There was nothing of the divine essence in Samson as the Hebrews conceived him, except that spirit of God with which he was directly endowed in supreme crises. There is little evidence of his possession of great wisdom, but strong proof of his moral and religious laxity. He sinned against the laws of Israel's God when he took a Philistine woman, an idolater, to wife; he sinned against the moral law when he visited the harlot at Gaza. He was wofully weak in character when he yielded to the blandishments of Delilah and wrought his own undoing, as well as that of his people. The disgraceful slavery into which Herakles fell was not caused by the hero's incontinence or uxoriousness, but a punishment for crime, in that he had in a fit of madness killed his friend Iphitus. And the three years which he spent as the slave of Omphale were punctuated by larger and better deeds than those of Samson in like situation--bursting the new cords with which the men of Judah had bound him and the green withes and new ropes with which Delilah shackled him. The record that Samson \"judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years\" leads the ordinary reader to think of him as a sage, judicial personage, whereas it means only that he was the political and military leader of his people during that period, lifted to a magisterial position by his strength and prowess in war. His achievements were muscular, not mental.  Rabbinical legends have magnified his stature and power in precisely the same manner as the imagination of the poet of the \"Lay"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37718"],["title","Elias: An Epic of the Ages (#0)"],["body","http://bencrowder.net/books/mtp.

ELIAS  _An Epic of the Ages_  BY ORSON FERGUSON WHITNEY  _Progress eterne! thou goest hand in hand With Life eterne, and naught but death e'er dies_.  REVISED AND ANNOTATED EDITION     Copyright, 1914 O. F. Whitney Salt Lake City, Utah     FOREWORD   \"Elias\" was begun in the spring of 1900, and was first published in the autumn of 1904, when an edition de luxe, limited to one hundred and fifty copies, and two less pretentious editions, were subscribed for by friends of the author. He was hardly a party to the project, the initial step being taken without his knowledge. Prior to that time he had read the poem to select gatherings in private homes and in two of the leading church schools, but had no thought of printing it so early, until solicited by a committee of prominent citizens to allow them to undertake, in his behalf, its publication.  That committee consisted of Governor Heber M. Wells, Senator George Sutherland, President Anthon H. Lund, Major Richard W. Young, and Mr. H. L. A. Culmer. These gentlemen, out of pure public spirit and a friendly feeling for the author, had associated themselves together for this purpose. Though aware of many defects in his work, and anxious to mend them before facing the public and the critics, he nevertheless accepted gratefully the very generous offer. All the members of the committee gave to the enterprise their hearty support, and two of them, Major Young and Mr. Culmer, conducted most of the business necessary to putting the book through the press.  Since the original issuance the author has endeavored to bring the work into a more finished state, and the results are now before the reader. The poem is in twelve parts--a prelude, ten cantos, and an epilogue. Following these are explanatory notes, for the benefit of students; the introduction of the epic as a text book into the schools being one of the purposes for which it was written.  The character and scope of the work are partly indicated by the title, \"Elias--An Epic Of The Ages.\" It is an attempt to present, in verse form, historically, doctrinally, and prophetically, the vast theme comprehended in what the world terms \"Mormonism.\"                                                     THE AUTHOR.     DEDICATION  (SEE NOTE.)     This song to thee, friend, chieftain, sixth to rise   From him, the foremost of a seeric line,   Mock of the worldly, marvel of the wise,--   His martyred brother's son! May light divine,   Which 'lumined them, forever on thee shine,   Flooding with splendors new thy lineal fame;   And ancient rays with modern beams combine   To glorify a brow whose stalwart aim, To merit heaven's high praise, nor fear a world's false blame!     THEME  (SEE NOTE.)   \"And if you will receive it, this is Elias, which was to come to gather together the tribes of Israel and restore all things.\"     ARGUMENT   The aim of this poem is to point out those manifestations of the Divine Mind and those impulsions from human enterprise which have contributed in all ages to the progress of the race toward perfection.  Thus it deals not only with man's origin and destiny, with earth's creation, redemption, and ultimate glorification, but with events and epochs leading up to and having those greater ends as their decreed consummation. The Christ theme, in its heavenly and earthly phases, is supplemented by the sacred and secular history of man upon both hemispheres. God's direct dealings through prophets, apostles, and other inspired agents, and His indirect dealings through poets, painters, philosophers, inventors, discoverers, statesmen, kings, conquerors and the like, are indicated, and the experiences of the Church of Christ in various dispensations portrayed.  The title \"Elias,\" signifying restoration and preparation,--the lesser going before the greater with those objects in view,--is used to denote and personify the Genius of Progress, whose beneficent workings, under the guidance of the Infinite Spirit, through the aeons and the ages, behind the scenes and upon the stage of human action, are the warp and woof of the entire poem. The medial point is the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times, the era of restitution, when the House of God is to be set in order, and all things in Christ are to be gathered into one.

The work for Him I asked and aimed to do,   Ere death should claim my dust, my spirit free,--   That, looking down from where the wise and true   Inherit glory, gracious eyes might see   A spark I kindled beaming endlessly,   And lighting other wanderers to the goal   Where blends the life that is with life to be;--   Now done, or well or ill, the lettered scroll Of what is writ on heart and mind I here unroll.     CANTO ONE  As From a Dream[1]   Youth's morn was breaking, when I dreamed a dream, Splendid as springtime's weft of wonders rare; Idyllic vision, beauteous, bright romance, Glory of love and glamor of renown. I dreamed that fame held all of happiness, Save the sweet charm that lurked in woman's smile.  Wealth wooed I not, nor power--to wear the sign And wave the symbol of authority; To speak, and have hosts tremble; or to frown, And find all pale and prostrate at my feet.                       10 But oh! to sway, like swinging forest boughs In summer breeze, men's yearning hearts and minds,-- Sway them in duty's name, in virtue's cause, By tongue of thunder or by pen of flame, Leaving some wise, sublime, benefic deed, Some word or work of merit and of might, To fix the fleeting gaze of centuries!  Glory and love--these were my guides divine, The planet passions of my destiny, The Baal and Astoreth[2] to whom I bowed,                         20 At human shrines a worldly worshiper, Adoring beauteous dust, my fellow clay, And coveting an earthly immortality.  And at the feet of these dear deities, Careless of great Jehovah's smile or frown, In the fresh morning of my youth's fair might, Slumbering I dreamed, till golden grew the dawn.  A strange and stern awakening--a sky, Pearl, gold, and sapphire, clear and calm till then, Cloud-curtained, grim, with anger audible,                        30 Tortured and torn with swift-flung darts of fire; Booming and crashing, bolt on bolt descends; Earth, air, and heaven are wrapt in roaring flame.  And when the rifted storm has rolled away, And stillness reascends her solemn throne, Ruin looks forth from retrospection's tower, And memory weeps where desolation reigns.  It was the end. Dispelled illusion's dream. Youth's fond ideals, thunder-stricken, strewn, Lay level with the dust. But light had come!                      40 My soul had cast its fetters and was free.  I slept and dreamed no more; I was awake! And saw and heard with other eyes and ears, Which taught me things unseen, unheard, before; Things new yet old--old as eternity, Old e'en to time, though new and strange to me.  I talked with Truth on solemn mountain tops; I soared with winged thought the sunlit dome; Studied the midnight stars; and when anon The hurrying, far-flung legions of the storm                      50 In supermortal might went forth to war, Would fain have charioted the charging plain, Or spurred the tempest as a battle steed, Grasping the volted lightnings as they flew, And thundering through the mists on things below.  Rejoicing in my new-found strength, I gave Glory to Him, the Source and Sire of all; That God whom I had neither loved nor feared, That God whom now I worshipt and adored. Who girdled me with Light, truth's triple key[3],                 60 Unlocking what hath been, what yet shall be, Probing death's gloom, life's three-fold mystery, Solving the secret--Whither, Whence and Why.  Oh, wondrous transformation! when with wand Of wakening might, that all-uplifting power Waved o'er the cross where hung fond hopes impaled, Waved o'er the tomb where loved ambitions lay, Touched the strewn fragments of my shattered dream, Bidding the dead arise in bodies new, Building, on ruined hope, faith's battlement,                     70 Love's palace, peace-domed, pinnacled in light, In glory greater than earth's grandest dream, Than glittering fame's most splendid spectacle; Ideal transcending ideality, Ideal made real past all reality!  Whose earth-dimmed eye could see what then I saw? Whose earth-dulled ear such harmonies could hear? When the all-searching Spirit tore the veil Of things that seem, and showed me things that are.  Beauty, both good and evil--lamp to heaven                        80 Or lure-light o'er the marshes of despair. Beauty, divine--but not divinity; Not parent--child of purity and truth; Nor fount, nor stream, but bubble lost in air, Nor tree, nor fruit--only a fragrant flower, Flung from ambrosial gardens[4], here to grow That life might be the less a wilderness.  But lo! a loveliness that blooms for aye, That, withering here, is there revivified, A loveliness made lovelier evermore;                              90 The beauty of the restful and the risen, Of Paradise[5] and Glory's higher home.  Pure as the mountain monarch's ice-crowned crest, Pure as the snow-king's mantle, diamond-strewn, Pure as the cascade's limpid crystalline, Leaping from cliff to chasm, the breeze-flung flood Blown into spirit spray of dazzling sheen; So pure the love that warmed my boyish breast, And lit the yearning of my youthful eye.  But pure love, e'en the purest, may be blind.                    100 Truth spake--then fell"]]]
