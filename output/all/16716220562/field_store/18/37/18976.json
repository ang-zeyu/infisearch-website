As I pointed out (1960:53), the validity of the subspecies _Bufo valliceps macrocristatus_, described from northern Chiapas by Firschein and Smith (1957:219) and supposedly characterized by hypertrophied cranial crests, is highly doubtful.  In the toads from El Petén the greatest variation is in coloration. The dorsal ground-color varies from orange and rusty tan to brown, yellowish tan, and pale gray. In some individuals the flanks and dorsum are one continuous color, whereas in others a distinct dorsolateral pale colored band separates the dorsal color from dark brown flanks. In some individuals the venter is uniform cream color, in others it bears a few scattered black spots, and in still others there are many spots, some of which are fused to form a black blotch on the chest. In breeding males the vocal sac is orange tan. All specimens have a coppery red iris.  Aside from the breeding congregations, active toads were found on the forest floor at night; a few were there by day. Some individuals were beneath logs during the day.   =Eleutherodactylus rostralis= (Werner)        Chinajá, 10.  Because of the multiplicity of names and the variation in coloration, the small terrestrial _Eleutherodactylus_ in southern México and northern Central America are in a state of taxonomic confusion. Stuart (1934:7, 1935:37, and 1958:17) referred specimens from El Petén to _Eleutherodactylus rhodopis_ (Cope). Stuart (1941b:197) described _Eleutherodactylus anzuetoi_ from Alta Verapaz and El Quiché, Guatemala, suggested that the new species was an upland relative of _Eleutherodactylus rostralis_ (Werner), and used that name for the frogs that he earlier had referred to _Eleutherodactylus rhodopis_. Dunn and Emlen (1932:24) placed _E. rostralis_ in the synonymy of _E. gollmeri_ (Peters). Examination of series of these frogs from southern México, Guatemala, and Costa Rica causes me to think that there are four species; these can be distinguished as follows:        _E. rhodopis._--No web between toes; one tarsal tubercle;       tibiotarsal articulation reaches to nostril; iris bronze in       life.        _E. anzuetoi._--No web between toes; a row of tarsal       tubercles; tibiotarsal articulation reaches to tip of snout;       color of iris unknown.        _E. rostralis._--A vestige of web between toes; no tarsal       tubercles; tibiotarsal articulation reaches snout or slightly       beyond; iris coppery red in life.        _E. gollmeri._--A vestige of web between toes; no tarsal       tubercles; tibiotarsal articulation reaches well beyond snout;       iris coppery red in life.  The presence of webbing between the toes, the absence of tarsal tubercles, and the coppery red iris distinguish _E. rostralis_ and _E. gollmeri_ from the other species. Probably _E. rostralis_ and _E. gollmeri_ are conspecific, but additional specimens are needed from Nicaragua and Honduras to prove conspecificity. On the other hand, the characters of the frogs from Chinajá clearly show that they are related to _E. gollmeri_ to the south and not to _E. rhodopis_ to the north in México.  At Chinajá, _Eleutherodactylus rostralis_ was more abundant than the few specimens indicate, for upon being approached the frogs moved quickly and erratically, soon disappearing in the leaf litter on the forest floor. Most of the specimens were seen actively moving on the forest floor in the daytime; one was found beneath a rock, and one was on the forest floor at night.   =Eleutherodactylus rugulosus rugulosus= (Cope)        Chinajá, 2; 15 km. NW of Chinajá, 4.  These frogs were found on the forest floor by day. With the exception of one female having a snout-vent length of 69.5 mm., all are juveniles. The apparent rarity of this species at Chinajá may be due to the absence of rocky streams, a favorite habitat of this frog. The local name for this frog is _sapito_, meaning little toad.   =Leptodactylus labialis= (Cope)        Toocog, 1.  One juvenile having a snout-vent length of 16.4 mm. was found at night beside a pond in the forest. The scarcity of the species of _Leptodactylus_ in the southern part of El Petén probably is due to the lack of permanent marshy ponds.   =Leptodactylus melanonotus= (Hallowell)        Sayaxché, 1.  One individual was found beneath a rock beside a stream in the forest. The local name is _ranita_, meaning little frog.   =Syrrhophus leprus= Cope        Chinajá, 2; 15 km NW of Chinajá, 1.  An adult female having a snout-vent length of 27.5 mm. was found on the forest floor by day. Two juveniles having snout-vent lengths of 15.5 and 19.0 mm. were beneath rocks on the forest floor. The specimens are typical of the species as defined by Duellman (1958:8).   =Hyla ebraccata= Cope        Toocog, 66.  This small tree frog congregated in large numbers at a forest pond at Toocog. Between June 30 and July 2 we collected specimens and observed the breeding habits of this and other species at the pond. Calling males were distributed around the pond, where they called from low herbaceous vegetation at the edge of the pond or from plants rising above the water. Calling commenced at dusk and continued at least into the early hours of the morning. On one occasion a female was observed at a distance of about 50 centimeters away from a calling male sitting on a blade of grass. The female climbed another blade of grass until she was about eight centimeters away from the male, at which time he saw her, stopped calling, jumped to the blade of grass on which she was sitting and clasped her. Clasping pairs were observed on blades of grass and leaves of plants above the water; most pairs were less than 50 centimeters above the surface of the pond.  The eggs are deposited on the dorsal surfaces of leaves above the water. All eggs are in one plane (a single layer) on the leaf. External membranes are barely visible, as the eggs consist of a single coherent mass. Eggs in the yolk plug stage have diameters of 1.2 to 1.4 mm. Seventeen eggs masses were found; these contained from 24 to 76 (average 44) eggs. The jelly is extremely viscous and tacky to the touch. At time of hatching the jelly becomes less viscous; the tadpoles wriggle until they reach the edge of the leaf and drop into the water.  Eleven tadpoles were preserved as they hatched; these have total lengths of 4.5 to 5.0 (average 4.77) mm. Hatchling tadpoles are active swimmers and have only a small amount of yolk. The largest tadpoles preserved have total lengths of 13.0 and 13.5 mm. At this size distinctive sword-tail and bright coloration have developed.  [Illustration: FIG. 2. Tadpole of _Hyla ebraccata_ (KU 59986) from Toocog, El Petén, Guatemala. × 6.]  Description of fully developed tadpole (KU 59986): Total length, 13.5 mm.; tail-length, 8.4 mm., 62 per cent of total length. Snout, in dorsal view, bluntly rounded; in lateral view less bluntly rounded; body depressed; head flattened; mouth terminal; eye large, its diameter 25 per cent of length of body; nostrils near tip of snout and directed anteriorly; spiracle sinistral and situated postero-ventrad to eye; cloaca median. Tail-fin thrice depth of tail-musculature, which extends beyond posterior end of tail-fin giving sword-tail appearance (Fig. 2). In life, black stripe on each side of body and on top of head; black band on anterior part of tail and another on the posterior part; body and anterior part of tail creamy yellow; dark red band between black bands on tail. Mouth terminal, small, its width about one-fifth width of body; fleshy ridge dorsally and ventrally; row of small papillae on ventral lip; no lateral indentations of lips; upper beak massive, convex, and finely serrate; lower beak small and mostly concealed behind upper; no teeth (Fig. 3).  [Illustration: FIG. 3. Mouthparts of larval _Hyla ebraccata_ (KU 59986) from Toocog, El Petén, Guatemala. × 100.]   =Hyla loquax= Gaige and Stuart        Toocog, 14.  These specimens were found at night when they were calling from low vegetation in a forest pond. Most of the frogs were several meters away from the edge of the pond. Although two clasping pairs were found, we obtained no eggs or tadpoles referable to this species.   =Hyla microcephala martini= Smith        Chinajá, 1; Toocog, 21.  The specimen from Chinajá was calling from a small bush at the edge of a temporary grassy pond in a clearing in the forest. At Toocog this species was closely associated with _Hyla ebraccata_; males were calling from herbaceous vegetation in and around the forest pond. These frogs were not so abundant in the forest at Toocog as they were around ponds on the savanna at La Libertad.   =Hyla picta= (Günther)        Toocog, 8.  This small tree frog was calling from herbs in a pond in the forest on June 30 and July 2. The voice is weak; probably greater numbers of males were present than are indicated by the few specimens collected, for the din from the more vociferous species made it impossible to hear _Hyla picta_ unless one was calling close by.   =Hyla staufferi= Cope        Chinajá, 1.  This individual was calling from a low bush in the clearing at Chinajá. None was found in the pond in the forest at Toocog. Stuart (1935:38) and Duellman (1960:63) noted that _Hyla staufferi_ breeds early in the rainy season. Nevertheless, I think early breeding habits do not account for the near absence of this species in our collections from southern El Petén. In early July, 1960, a few individuals were heard at a pond on the savanna at La Libertad. In mid-July of the same year they were calling sporadically from temporary ponds in the lower Motagua Valley. Possibly the individual collected at Chinajá was accidentally transported there in cargo from Toocog, from which camp at the edge of the savanna planes fly to Chinajá weekly. My observations on this species throughout its range in México and Central America indicate that it inhabits savannas and semi-arid forests and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38398"],["title","Amphibians and Reptiles of the Rainforests of Southern El Petén, Guatemala (#5)"],["body","is absent from heavy rainforest. Stuart (1948:34) obtained this species at Cubilquitz in the lowlands of Alta Verapaz.   =Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori= Funkhouser        Toocog, 25.  Between June 30 and July 2 this species was abundant at a pond in the forest at Toocog. Calling males were as high as five meters in bushes and trees around the pond. At dusk males were observed descending a vine-covered tree at the edge of the pond; this strongly suggests that the frogs retreat to this tree and others like it for diurnal seclusion. Clasping pairs were found on branches and leaves above the water. The eggs are deposited in clumps usually on vertical leaves, but sometimes on horizontal leaves or on branches, vines, and aerial roots above the water. Twenty-six clutches of eggs contained from 14 to 44 (average 29) eggs. In a clutch in which the eggs are in yolk plug stage the average diameter of the embryos is 2.3 mm. and that of the vitelline membranes, 3.4 mm. Most of the eggs are in the external part of the gelatinous mass; the jelly is clear. The yolk is pale green, and the animal pole is brown. As development ensues, the yolk becomes yellow and the embryo first dark brown and then pale grayish tan. Upon hatching the tadpoles wriggle free of the jelly and drop into the water. One clutch of 19 eggs was observed to hatch in three minutes. Apparently, on dropping into the water the hatchling tadpoles go to the bottom of the pond, for one or two minutes pass from the time they enter the water until they reappear near the surface. The average total length of seven hatchling tadpoles is 7.4 mm. There is a moderate amount of yolk, but this does not form a large ventral bulge. Large tadpoles congregate in the sunny parts of the pond, where they were observed just beneath the surface. Many had their mouths at the surface. Except for constant fluttering of the tip of the tail, they lie quietly with the axis of the body at an angle of about 45 degrees with the surface of the water.  Description of tadpole (KU 60006): total length, 24.5 mm.; tail-length, 15.4 mm.; body broader than deep; head moderately flattened; snout viewed from above blunt; nostrils close to snout and directed dorsally; eyes of moderate size and directed laterally; mouth directed anteroventrally; anus median; spiracle ventral, its opening just to left of midline slightly more than one-half distance from tip of snout to vent. Tail-fin slightly more than twice as deep as tail musculature, which curves upward posteriorly; tail-fin narrowly extending to tip of tail (Fig. 4). Color in life pale gray; in preservative white with scattered melanophores; tail-fin transparent.  [Illustration: FIG. 4. Tadpole of _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_ (KU 60006) from Toocog, El Petén, Guatemala. × 4.]  Upper lip having single row of papillae laterally, but none medially; lower lip having single row of papillae; no lateral indentation of lips; two or more rows of papillae at lateral corners of lips; tooth-rows 2/3; second upper tooth row as long as first, interrupted medially; inner lower tooth-row as long as upper rows, interrupted medially; second and third lower rows decreasingly shorter; upper beak moderate in size and having long lateral projections; lower beak moderate in size; both beaks finely serrate (Fig. 5).  [Illustration: FIG. 5. Mouthparts of larval _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_ (KU 60006) from Toocog, El Petén, Guatemala. × 30.]   =Smilisca baudini= (Duméril and Bibron)        Chinajá, 9; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 42; Río de la Pasión, 1;       Río San Román, 5; Sayaxché; Toocog, 2.  Individuals of this species were found at night sitting on bushes and small trees in the forest in February and March and again in June and July. One was in the axil of a leaf of a _Xanthosoma_. In June and July males were heard nearly every night. The series of specimens from 20 kilometers north-northwest of Chinajá was taken from a breeding congregation in a shallow muddy pool in the forest. Tadpoles of this species were in small, often muddy pools in the forest. To my knowledge _Smilisca baudini_ is the only hylid to breed in these pools at Chinajá, although perhaps _Smilisca phaeota_ also utilizes them. The only other amphibian at Chinajá known to breed in the pools is _Bufo valliceps valliceps_. Although two specimens were on bushes at night at Toocog, _Smilisca baudini_ was not present at the pond where five other species of hylids were breeding. Nevertheless, _Smilisca baudini_ was calling from two ponds on the savannas near La Libertad. All of the specimens from southern El Petén have yellow or yellowish white flanks and ventrolateral surfaces.   =Smilisca phaeota cyanosticta= (Smith)        Chinajá, 4; 10 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1.  All specimens were found in February and March. Those from Chinajá were obtained from _Xanthosoma_ and bromeliads; the individual from 10 kilometers north-northwest of Chinajá is an adult male that was calling from a puddle in a fallen tree on March 13. A juvenile having a snout-vent length of 34.7 mm. lacks the pale blue spots on the thighs; instead, the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs are bright red.   =Hypopachus cuneus nigroreticulatus= Taylor        Toocog, 1.  An adult male having a snout-vent length of 41.7 mm. was found at night on the forest floor at the edge of a temporary pond. In life the dorsum was dark brown with chocolate brown markings; the stripe on the side of the head was white; the middorsal stripe was pale orange; the belly was black and white, and the iris was a bronze color.  Characteristically this species inhabits savannas and open forest; thus, its occurrence in the rainforest at Toocog is surprising. This is the southernmost record for the species in El Petén; to the south in the highlands it is replaced by the smaller _Hypopachus inguinalis_, having rounded, instead of compressed, metatarsal tubercles.   =Rana palmipes= Spix        Chinajá, 11; 15 km. NW of Chinajá, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá,       1.  With the exception of one recently metamorphosed juvenile having a snout-vent length of 30.7 mm. that was found on the forest floor by day on June 24, and one that was found beside a pool in a cave, all individuals were found at temporary woodland pools or along sluggish streams at night. The largest specimen is a female having a snout-vent length of 107 mm.   =Rana pipiens= Schreber        Chinajá, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1; Río San Román, 1;       Toocog, 1.  All specimens were found near water at night. The largest individual is a female having a snout-vent length of 112.5 mm.   =Crocodylus moreleti= Duméril and Duméril        Chinajá, 1; Río San Román, 1.  One specimen was obtained from a quiet pool in the Río San Román at night; another was found in a small sluggish stream at Chinajá. Two large individuals were seen in tributaries to the Río San Román. On the savannas at Toocog two small individuals were obtained in the dry season, at which time the crocodiles apparently were migrating to water. The local name for this species is _lagarto_.   =Chelydra rossignoni= (Bocourt)        Chinajá, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1.  The paucity of specimens of _Chelydra_ from Central America has resulted in rather inadequate diagnoses of various populations. The present specimens have carapace lengths of 250 and 238 mm. and plastral lengths of 185 and 176 mm. The length of carapace/bridge ratio is 6.0 and 6.1 per cent. Each individual has four barbels, the median pair of which are extremely long. In KU 55977 the lateral pair of barbels is forked at the base. The relative length of the plastral bridge in these specimens compares favorable with the ratio (.06-.08) given by Schmidt (1946:4) for five specimens from Honduras. _Chelydra serpentina_, which may occur sympatrically with _C. rossignoni_ in some parts of Central America, has a narrower plastral bridge and only two barbels beneath the chin. Furthermore, _C. rossignoni_ and _C. osceola_ in Florida have long, flat tubercles on the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the neck, whereas _C. serpentina_ has short, round tubercles.  The specimen from Chinajá was found in a small sluggish stream; the other individual was in a muddy pool in the forest. The local name is _sambodanga_.   =Claudius angustatus= Cope        20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 1.  One specimen was unearthed from the bank of a small muddy stream by a bulldozer. This individual represents the second record for the species in Guatemala; the first was provided by specimens, likewise found in muddy waters, at Tikal (Stuart, 1958:19). The local name is _caiman_.   =Kinosternon acutum= Gray        20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 4; 30 km. NNW of Chinajá, 2.  These turtles were found on the forest floor, in small sluggish streams, and in pools in the forest. One adult male had, in life, the top of the head yellow with black spots; the stripes on the head and neck were red. Specimens were obtained both in the dry and rainy seasons. The local name for both species of _Kinosternon_ is _pochitoque_.   =Kinosternon leucostomum= Duméril and Bibron        Chinajá, 3; 15 km. NW of Chinajá, 1; 20 km. NNW of Chinajá, 2.  Individuals of this turtle were found on the forest floor and in small sluggish streams. In life most specimens had a tan or pale brown head with pinkish tan stripes on the head and neck. All individuals were obtained in February and March. No ecological differences between this species and _K. acutum_ were evident.   =Staurotypus triporcatus= (Wiegmann)        Paso Subín, 1.  This species is represented in the collection by one complete shell found on the bank of the Río Subín. The carapace has a length of 292 mm. The local name is _Guao_. Natives stated that this turtle was not uncommon in clear rivers and lakes, a habitat suggested for the species by Stuart (1958:19).   =Dermatemys mawi= Gray        Chinajá, 1; Río San Román, 4.  The record from Chinajá is based on a carapace found in a chiclero camp,"]]]
