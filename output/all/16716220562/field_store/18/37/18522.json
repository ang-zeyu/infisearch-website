Shame upon it that the cares and anxieties which it behoves a man to bear should rest upon her shoulders! She has to look after the whole of this vast household, and, as if that were not enough, she must needs farm the estates of her sisters, the ladies Banfi and Teleki. How many lawsuits must she not carry on with this neighbour and with that! But they've met their match in her, I'll warrant. She appears in person before the judges and pleads so shrewdly, that our best advocates might take lessons from her. And then, too, when my Lord Banfi came capering hither with his killing ways, some little time ago, fancying that our gracious lady was one of your straw-widows, how she sent him away with a flea in his ear! The worthy gentleman did not know whether he stood on his head or his heels, and yet he is one of the chief men in the land! And afterwards, too, when, out of revenge, he saddled us with that freebooter of a captain and his lanzknechts, don't you recollect how our lady had them all flogged out of the village, and how the rascals took to their heels when they saw our gracious mistress herself march out against them, blunderbuss in hand?\"  \"Would that they had not scampered off quite so quickly,\" interrupted the girl, with a burst of enthusiasm. \"I'd have laid the poker about their ears, I warrant you.\"  \"Hark'e, Clara! when a woman has been forced to keep house alone for so long a time, and to defend herself and family by the might of her own arms, she comes at last to feel herself a man all over. That is why our mistress looks as stern as if she had never been a girl.\"  \"But tell me, Aunt Magdalene,\" returned the girl, drawing her chair nearer, \"shall we never see master again?\"  \"Alas! God only knows,\" replied the old dame, sighing. \"How can I tell when the poor fellow will be released from his captivity? I always had a presentiment that it would come to this, and I said so, but no one heeded me. It happened in this wise. In the days when our Prince George[7] of blessed memory, not content with his own land, must needs set out to conquer Poland at the head of the Hungarian chivalry, our good master, Sir Michael, went with him. Oh, how I tried--and our lady too--to keep him back. They were a newly-wedded couple then, and the good gentleman himself had little heart for war--he always preferred to sit at home among his books, his water-mills, and his fruit trees--but honour called him and he went. I begged him to at least take my son Andy with him. God gave me that thought, for otherwise we should never have heard again of our gracious master, for when his Highness, our Sovereign Prince George, beheld the bestial hordes of Tartars marching out against him, he himself galloped off home, leaving his nobility captives in the hands of the heathen, who dragged them off in fetters to Tartary. My son Andy, who was of no use to them, for he was badly wounded in the thigh, and therefore could not work, they sent home; he brought the tidings that Sir Michael was sickening in sad confinement, and the Tartars, perceiving how high he stood in the esteem of his fellow-prisoners, took him for their prince, and set upon his head such a frightfully high ransom, that all his property turned into gold could not have paid it off. Nevertheless our noble lady rejoiced exceedingly when she heard that her husband was still alive, and ran hither and thither and left no stone unturned to raise the money. But neither her kind friends nor her dear relations would lend her anything--no, not on the best security, for no one willingly lends on land in time of war. So she sold her treasures, her bridal dower which her mother had given her; all the beautiful silver plate, jewelled bracelets, and embossed gold and pearl ornaments which her ancestors had handed down to her; her large satin-trimmed, fur-embroidered mantle and her filagreed _mente_[8]; her rings, agraffes, and hairpins; her carbuncle bracelets and orient pearls; her diamond ear-rings--in short, everything which could be turned into money. Yet even all that came to not one-half of what the Tartar demanded, so what does she do but farm the estates of her sisters, plough up the fallow-lands, and cut down the forests to make way for corn-fields. To find time for more work, she turned night into day. No sort of husbandry whereby money could be made escaped her attention. At one time she laid down clay-pits and dug out quarries, the products of which found customers in the neighbourhood. At another time she bred prize oxen and sold them to the Armenian herdsmen. She visited all the markets in person; carried her wine as far as Poland, her corn to Hermannstadt, her honey, wax, and preserved fruits to Kronstadt--nay, in order to obtain a fair price for her wools, she crossed the border and took them as far as Debreczin. And how frugally she fared all the time! It is true she never stinted her servants in anything, but she seemed to weigh every morsel that went into her own mouth. At harvest time she would have nothing cooked for herself at home for weeks together, so that she might remain in the fields all day. A piece of bread which would have been too little for a child was all she ate, and her drink was a bowl of spring water; yet, believe me, Clara, we never once saw her in a bad humour, and never did a single bitter tear fall upon the dry bread which her loyalty to her husband constrained her to live upon.\"       [Footnote 7: George Rakoczy I., Prince of Transylvania,      1630-1648.]       [Footnote 8: _Mente._ A fur pelisse.]  \"And why was all this?\"  \"I'll tell you, my child. The money which she thus scraped together by toil and frugality, year by year, is regularly sent by Andy to Tartary, in part payment of Sir Michael's ransom. At such times our dear lady grudges herself every morsel she puts into her mouth.\"  The old nurse wiped the tears from her eyes.  \"And what then was the amount of the ransom?\"  \"That's more than I can tell you, my daughter. Andy always brings back the parchment on which the Tartar marks down the amount received and the amount still due. Our noble lady keeps it herself. I, of course, never ask any questions about it.\"  The girl was silent and appeared to be reflecting; doubly quick the spindle flew round in her hands, and her heart beat faster too.  \"My son Andy is there now,\" said the old dame, weary of the long silence. \"I expect him back every hour now; from him we shall hear something certain.\"  At that moment the gate outside creaked on its hinges, a little gig rolled boisterously into the courtyard, and a joyful barking and yelping told that an old acquaintance had arrived.  \"Our mistress has come,\" cried the two servants, rising from their seats, and at the same moment the door opened and Anna Bornemissa, Michael Apafi's wife, stepped in.  A stately woman of almost masculine stature; the outline of her slim but vigorous and muscular figure is plainly visible through her simple grey linen dress. She cannot be more than thirty-six, but her face is of those on which time leaves no trace until extreme old age. Her features are deeply tanned by the sun, but the velvet down of well-preserved youth and the natural ruddiness of perfect health lend a peculiar loveliness to that extraordinary countenance. Her look surprises, dominates, subdues; the charm which lies concealed there appears not so much in the features as in the expression--her face is the mirror of a noble soul. Not as if there was anything hard, rough, stiff, or masculine in the features themselves: on the contrary. Her brow is finely arched, delicately smooth, unobscured as yet by a single wrinkle, and yet so full of majesty; her eyelashes are most exquisitely pencilled; the shape of the eyes is enchanting, those large, not exactly wild-black, but rather deep, bright, nut-brown eyes, half hidden by their long eyelashes, and in those eyes there is so much fire, so much sparkle, and yet so much coldness. The delicate nose, the oval face, every feature is so femininely regular. Even the mouth when closed is so sweet, so tender, the other features seem to use violence towards it to prevent its smile from spreading further, and yet when it opens, how haughty, how commanding it becomes.  \"What, still up?\" cried she to her servants.  The voice is pleasantly sonorous, although affliction has somewhat deadened its lower notes.  \"We thought it best to stay up, in case your ladyship might be kept waiting outside,\" replied the old woman, tripping round her mistress and taking the heavy mantle from her shoulders.  \"Has not Andy yet returned?\" asked Lady Apafi, in a low, melancholy voice.  \"Not yet; but I expect him every moment.\"  Lady Apafi sighed deeply. How much of stifled grief, vanishing hope, and patient renunciation was concealed in that sigh! The recollection of the manifold sufferings of her wretched life rose up before that heroic woman's soul. She called to mind her brave struggle with fate, with her fellow-men, and with her own heart; her love, grafted on pain, had brought forth not gladness but ungratified longing. Another toilsome year of her life had passed away. With the self-sacrificing industry of a bee, she had hoarded up, morsel by morsel, her little store, and who could tell how many years would be requisite to complete it? And till then nothing but toil, patience, and unrequited love.  Lady Apafi, not without an effort, resumed her habitual coldness, wished her servants good-night, and was already on her way to her chamber, when Clara rushed forward and kissed her mistress's hand. The lady looked at her with astonishment. She felt"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37339"],["title","'Midst the Wild Carpathians (#6)"],["body","a burning tear had fallen on her hand, which the girl held fast and pressed to her lips.  \"What ails you?\" asked Dame Apafi, much surprised.  \"Nothing,\" replied the girl, sobbing; \"it is only that I feel so sorry for your ladyship. I have long had an idea in my head, but have never yet dared to express it. We have often talked about our master's captivity and his grievous ransom. We village girls have all of us got necklaces of gold and silver coins which are no good to us. So we have agreed among ourselves to club together all this money now lying idle and give it to your ladyship towards our master's ransom. It may not be much, but still is something.\"  Lady Apafi, her eyes glistening with involuntary tears, pressed hard the peasant girl's trembling hand.  \"I thank thee, my girl,\" she said, deeply touched. \"I prize thy offer more highly than if my sister Banfi had placed ten thousand gold chains at my disposal. But God will also be my helper. In Him is my trust.\"  At that moment the trampling of horses was heard in the courtyard and the dogs fell to barking.  \"Who can that be? Robbers, perhaps!\" stammered the old nurse, and neither of the two servants durst approach the door.  Then Dame Apafi took the light from the table, stepped to the door, opened it, and looked out into the courtyard.  \"Who's there?\" she cried, loudly and clearly.  \"We!--I mean to say I,\" returned a hesitating voice, which all three immediately recognized as Andy's.  \"Oh, 'tis you? Come hither quickly!\" said Lady Apafi joyfully, pushing Andy into the room, who was plainly very much confused, for he kept on twirling about his hat in his hands, and looked sheepishly at the floor.  \"Well, did you see him and speak to him? Is he well?\" asked Lady Apafi impetuously.  \"Yes, he is quite well,\" replied the man, glad to have found his voice again; \"he respectfully kisses your ladyship's hand. He also bade me say that God is good!\"  \"But what do you keep looking sideways for? At whom are the dogs barking?\"  \"At the black horse perhaps; it is a long time since they saw him.\"  \"And you gave the purse to the Mirza?\"  Instead of answering this question, Andy began to fumble about in the pocket of his sheepskin jacket, and as this pocket was very high up, narrow and deep, his features expressed the most exquisite torture till he had fished up the parchment, and he trembled all over as he handed it to his mistress.  \"Is there still much in arrear? What says the Mirza?\" asked Lady Apafi, with a very shaky voice.  \"There is not much more. One might even say there is very little,\" replied Andy, with downcast eyes, fumbling in his confusion with the rim of his hat.  \"But how much, how much then?\" they all cried together.  Andy got very red.  \"Well--well, there is nothing at all!\"  He said this in a broken voice, and with that he burst into a loud and long roar of laughter, and immediately after wept as if his heart would break.  The mind of Dame Apafi instantly grasped the whole truth.  \"Speak, man!\" cried she passionately, seizing the fellow by the shoulder; \"you have brought my husband back with you?\"  Andy waved his fist behind him and nodded his head; he laughed and wept at the same time; but, to save his life, he could not have uttered a word.  Dame Apafi, with a sob and a cry of boundless joy, rushed to the door which already stood ajar. Some one had been waiting there and listening all the time; it was Michael Apafi, her long expected, often bewailed consort.  \"Michael! my beloved husband!\" cried the woman, trembling with emotion; and half swooning, half beside herself, she fell upon her husband's neck, murmuring unintelligible words of love, joy, and tenderness.  Apafi pressed her to his breast. She embraced him convulsively; no other sound was to be heard but a deep sobbing.  \"Thou art mine!\" she stammered, after a long pause, when the tempest of her emotion had somewhat subsided and she was more herself.  \"I am thine,\" cried Apafi; \"and I swear that nothing in the world shall ever tear me from thee again!\"  \"O God, what bliss!\" cried Anna, raising her streaming eyes to heaven. \"What joy thou hast brought back to me!\" she stammered once more, leaning on her husband and hiding her face in his bosom.  \"And if the whole world were mine,\" continued Apafi, \"even then I should not be rich enough to requite thy devotion. I take God to witness, that if I could call a kingdom my own I would give it thee, and think it but a beggarly recompense.\"  The joyful, loving pair, happy beyond all expression, were then left alone with their joy and happiness. Late into the night burned the taper in their window. How much, how endlessly much they had to say to one another!     CHAPTER III.  A PRINCE IN HIS OWN DESPITE.   A year had elapsed since Michael Apafi's return home. There was a great hubbub in the house at Ebesfalva. One team of horses had scarcely had time to rest, when off went another at full gallop along the high-road; the servants themselves were sent hither and thither; some great trouble had evidently visited the house, but for all that, not a glum or sorrowful face was to be seen.  To those who could question discreetly, it was presently whispered that the wife of Michael Apafi expected every moment to be delivered of a child.  Good Sir Michael never quitted the chamber of his suffering consort. The gossips said that the sight of her husband was a great consolation to the invalid lady, and that he never ceased whispering sweet, caressing words into her ear.  Suddenly a wild tumult filled the courtyard, and, to the great terror of the servants assembled there, four-and-twenty mounted Albanians, armed with swords and lances, and headed by a big-headed Turkish Aga, dashed up to the door.  \"Is your master at home?\" cried the Aga dictatorially to Andy, who stood rooted to the spot with fright. \"For if he is,\" continued he, without waiting for an answer, \"tell him to come here. I have something to say to him.\"--Andy still could not find his voice.--\"If, however,\" proceeded the Turk emphatically, \"if he won't come, I'll go and fetch him.\"  And with these words he sprang from his horse, and was crossing the threshold, when Andrew plucked up sufficient courage to stammer--\"But, most gracious sir ...\" The Turk turned savagely upon him.  \"It were better, my son, if you did not chatter so much!\" said he, and forthwith he plunged into the vestibule.  At that very moment Apafi, startled by the clatter of the sabres, came out of his wife's chamber. He was not a little alarmed when he found himself face to face with this unexpected guest.  \"Are you Michael Apafi?\" asked the Turk wrathfully.  \"The same, at your service, gracious sir,\" returned Apafi meekly.  \"Good! My master, his Highness, the famous Ali Pasha, commands you to instantly get into your carriage, and come to my lord's camp at Kis-Selyk without a single attendant.\"  \"This is a pretty go,\" murmured Apafi to himself. \"Pardon me, worthy Aga,\" added he aloud; \"just now it is quite impossible for me to comply with your wish. My wife lies in the pangs of child-birth; the issues of life and death depend on the next five minutes. I cannot leave her now.\"  \"Send for a doctor if your wife is ill; and recollect that to bring down the wrath of the illustrious Pasha on your head is not the proper way to cure _her_.\"  \"Grant me but one day, and then I don't care if I lose my head.\"  \"You won't lose your head if you obey instantly; but otherwise I'll not answer for the consequences. Come! don't be a fool.\"  Anna heard in her chamber the dialogue that was going on outside, and anxiously called her consort. Apafi quitted the Aga and hastened to his wife.  \"What is it?\" asked the sufferer, much disturbed. How pale she was at that moment!  \"Nothing, nothing, my darling! Some one has sent for me, but I don't mean to go.\"  But Lady Apafi had perceived the points of the Turkish lances through the rifts of the window-curtains, and she cried despairingly--  \"Michael, they want to carry you off!\" Then she clasped her husband convulsively to her heart. \"I won't let you go, Michael! I won't lose you again. You shall not be dragged off into captivity. Rather let them kill me.\"  \"Calm yourself, dear child,\" said Apafi soothingly. \"I really don't know what they want me for. I have certainly done nothing to offend these good people. I suppose it is an attempt to levy black-mail. I'll satisfy them.\"  \"Alas! I have an evil foreboding. My heart fails me. Some calamity threatens you,\" stammered the sick woman; then, bursting into a violent fit of sobbing, she threw herself on her husband's bosom. \"Michael, I shall never see you again.\"  Meanwhile, the Aga outside began to feel bored, so he fell to hammering at the door, and cried--  \"Apafi! hi! Apafi! come out! I may not enter your wife's chamber, for that would be an abomination to a servant of Allah; but if you don't come out at once I'll burn your house down.\"  \"I'd better go, perhaps,\" said Apafi, trying to soothe his wife with kisses. \"My refusal would only make matters worse for us. They are sure to let me go. I shall be back in the twinkling of an eye.\"  \"I shall never see you again,\" gasped Anna. She was near to swooning.  Apafi took advantage of this momentary fainting fit, plucked up his courage, left his wife, and joined the Aga with streaming eyes.  \"Well, sir, let us be off,\" said the Turk. \"But surely you won't go without your sword, just as if you were some poor peasant,\" continued he fiercely. \"Go back, I say; gird on your sword, and tell your wife that she need fear nothing.\"  Apafi returned to his room, and as he took down his large silver-embossed sword (it was hanging up on the wall right over the bed) he said cheerily to his wife--  \"Look, now! there can scarcely be anything unpleasant in store for me, or they would not have bidden me buckle on my sword. Trust in God!\"  \"I do, I do trust in Him,\" she replied, convulsively kissing her husband's hand and pressing it to "]]]
