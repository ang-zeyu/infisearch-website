I wish we were once upon the road!--this anxiety is tormenting; I long, though why desire, to see England, when all I love, is here?       _Enter NANNETTE._  Oh, Nannette, is the gentleman come?  _Nan._ No, ma'am, but I desired the boy to show him to this apartment.  _Henry._ [_Without._] What! is the lady this way?  _Nan._ The devil take the blockhead! may I die, if it isn't the young English officer, he's sending up here.  _Rosa._ Shut the door, I'll be seen by nobody--Undone! my brother Henry!--       _Enter HENRY._  _Henry._ Is it possible? can it be!--My dear, will you step down a moment? [_Exit NANNETTE._] My sister Rosa!  _Rosa._ What shall I do?  _Henry._ Escaped from the convent, I suppose?--Tell me, Rosa, what--lost to every sense of virtue! to fly from the only place that could afford an asylum for your shame?  _Rosa._ My dear brother! though appearances are against me, yet, when you are acquainted with certain circumstances, which prudence forbids me, at present, to account for----  _Henry._ Talk of prudence, and your fame blemished--your character departed with its destroyer.--But, of your Lord Winlove's memory, let me be tender, as his life has answered for his share in your offence.  _Rosa._ [_Aside._] He does not know yet of my lord's being alive--I dread his return--their meeting again must, indeed, be fatal.  _Henry._ Tell me, Rosa, why would you quit the convent?  _Rosa._ [_Aside._] I must get Henry out of the house before my Lord Winlove comes back! how shall I?--Come, take me, I'll go with you there this instant--do forgive me; come, dear brother!  _Henry._ Yes, yes; I'll lodge you once more:--yet how perplexing! if I quit Fontainbleau at this juncture, I may lose my wished-for interview, with the unknown charmer that brought me hither.  _Rosa._ [_Aside._] Ruin! I think I hear--if it should be Lord Winlove!--Come, Henry, I have but little preparation, and will immediately attend you.  _Henry._ Be assured I won't part with you now, untill I again deliver you to the Lady Abbess, with a strict charge, that she'll strengthen your spiritual chains. [_Aside._] And yet the sympathy of my own heart, inclines me to excuse the weakness of my sister's.   _DUETT.--HENRY and ROSA._    _Brooks, to your sources, ah, quickly return!   Tear drop on tear, and give life to the urn;   Truth and virtue pass away,   Ere I for another my true love betray._                                                                  [Exeunt.     ACT THE SECOND.    SCENE I.       _The Course.--A Shouting within._       _Enter TALLYHO and JOCKEY._  _Tall._ Huzza! Ecod, Dick, my boy, you did the thing nicely!  _Jockey._ Didn't I, your honour? I said I'd win for you--Huzza!  _Tall._ Huzza! we've banged the monsieurs. Hey for Yorkshire! d'ye hear--See Whirligig well rubbed down, and give her a horn of egg, milk, oil, and saffron; and while you lead her down the course in triumph, let the French horns play, _Britons strike home_. [Sings.] _Merry be the first of August._--Let's see, besides the fifteen thousand from this French Colonel Epaulette,--ay, I shall win twenty thousand by the day; and then my slang match to-morrow--Eh, Dick?  _Jockey._ Ay, sir; Whirligig and old England against the Globe--Huzza!                                                                  [_Exit._       _Enter ENGLISH WAITER._  _Eng. Wait._ Sir, my mistress would be glad to know how many she must provide dinner for.  _Tall._ Eh! Dinner!--true: Tell old Moll Casey to knock her whole house into one room, and to roast, boil, bake, and fricassee, as if she hadn't an hour to live--we're a roaring, screeching party----       _Enter LACKLAND._  _Lack._ Yes, tell your mistress we're a numerous party--I've left my name at the bar.                                                           [_Calling out._                                                           [_Exit WAITER._  _Tall._ Yes, I dare say they have your name in the bar--I see, by his grin, he wants to come Captain Borrowman, but 'twon't do.                                                                 [_Aside._  _Lack._ Ah, Tallyho, my dear fellow, I give you joy--Upon my honour I never saw finer running in the whole course of----  _Tall._ I won't lend you sixpence.  _Lack._ Sir!  _Tall._ It's a fine day.  _Lack._ Why, sir, as to the--ha! ha! ha! Upon my soul, you are the most----  _Tall._ So I am, ha! ha! ha!  _Lack._ Ha! ha! ha! Oh, I have you, ha! ha! ha!  _Tall._ No, you han't, ha! ha! ha! Nor you won't have me, ha! ha! ha! I'm not to be had--know a thing or two--up to all--if you're flint, I'm steel.  _Lack._ Well, but don't strike fire to me--reserve your flashes of wit or----  _Tall._ You will catch them, as your coat is a kind of tinder, ha! ha! ha!  _Lack._ Sir, I desire you will find some other subject for your jokes.  _Tall._ True, your coat is rather a thread-bare subject, ha! ha! ha!--touching the cash makes a body so comical, ha! ha! ha!  _Lack._ Cash; ay, your wit is sterling to-day, Tallyho, and as you carry your brains in your pocket, I wish you'd change me a twenty pound joke.  _Tall._ Ha! ha! ha! Ah, well, Lackland, you're so full of jokes, that you even laugh at the elbows, ha! ha! ha! that is the best humoured suit of clothes--  _Lack._ [_Calmly._] Sir, if you were any body else, upon my honour, I'd knock you down!  _Tall._ Hold, if you raise your arm, you'll increase the laugh--Come, don't be angry, [_Looks out._] and I'll help you to a graver sort o'coat, that's not quite so much upon the broad grin, ha! ha! ha! Hush! I'll introduce you to Colonel Epaulette yonder.  _Lack._ [_Looking._] That, ay, a right Frenchman; one might guess by his mirth that he has lost to day.  _Tall._ True; but I keep up the old saying, ha! ha! ha! they may laugh that win.  _Lack._ I've heard the most unaccountable stories of his attempt at our style of doing things.  _Tall._ Yes, I'm his tutor; I teach him all our polite accomplishments.  _Lack._ Polite! then I suppose he can drink, swear, play at cricket, and smoke tobacco.  _Tall._ Yes, he comes on, but I'll give him up to you--or you to him, to get rid of you.                                                                 [_Aside._  _Lack._ Yet, I am told this French gentleman has a most benevolent heart--a man of much worth.  _Tall._ Yes, he is worth twenty thousand a year.  _Lack._ I like a man of twenty thousand a year--hem! tell him who I am.                                                [_With great Consequence._  _Tall._ I'll tell him, you're a wrangling mastiff, pointer-made--he thinks so highly of our courage, with him, the boldest bully, is the bravest Briton, ha! ha! ha!--he's so fond of our English customs, ha! ha! ha! why, he'd introduce himself to a duchess, with a zounds; and thinks if he can come out with a dozen dammes or so, he speaks very good English.       _Enter COLONEL EPAULETTE, singing._  Colonel E. _Rule Britannia, Britannia rule de vay._ Ah, my victorious squire--[_Sings._] _If you should like, De Yorkshire tyke, an honest lad behold me._  _Both._ Tol lol de rol, &c.  _Colonel E._ I lose five tousand to you on dis match--Dere is one tousand on de Paris bank, two de bank of England, von Drummond, and von Child.                                                           [_Gives Notes._  _Lack._ Tallyho, as I have none of my own, I'll adopt that child.  _Colonel E._ [_Looks at LACKLAND with Admiration._] Ha! ha! ha! Le drole!  _Tall._ Oh yes, it's a very good joke. [_Puts up Notes._] Colonel, this here is Squire What d'ye call him--Squire, that there is Colonel Thing-o-me, and now you know one another, shake fists.  _Lack._ Sir, your most obedient.  _Tall._ Colonel, this is an honest fellow, and a finished gentleman; a jig or allemande--Robin Gray or Mallbrook--he'll whip you through with a small sword, or break your head with a cudgel.  _Colonel E._ I'm much oblig'd to him, but is he fond of play?  _Tall._ Play! He'll pull the longest straw for a twenty pound joke, or run with you in a sack for a ginger-bread hat.  _Lack._ Sir, my friend Tallyho is rather lavish in his recommendations--I have the honour to be known, and, indeed, live with some persons, not of the lowest order, in this, and--every country.  _Tall._ Yes, he has so many great acquaintances, and so polite himself--look at his hat--he has almost saluted away the front cock.  _Lack._ I hate ceremony, but one must be civil, you know.  _Tall._ Says so many good things too!--A capital bon motter.  _Lack._ Hang it!--no, Tallyho, my wit is rather o' the--sometimes, indeed, comes out with a little sally, that----  _Colonel E._ Sir, I should be proud to be introduced to your little Sally.  _Lack._ Ha! ha! ha! You shall, Colonel--my little Molly, and my little Jenny, and--ha! ha! ha! you see what I am, Colonel--rather an ordinary fellow, [_Conceitedly._] but the ladies do squint at me, now and then, ha! ha! ha!--overheard a most diverting confab amongst that group of ladies yonder, as I passed them--Oh, dear! look at him, says one--at who? says another--that smart gentleman, says a third--I vow, a monstrous pretty fellow, says a fourth--but who is he? perhaps he's the English ambassador--oh, madam, not he, oh, not him, no, no--but at last they all concluded, from a certain something in my air, that I can be no other than--the Emperor, incog.--ha! ha! ha!  _All._ Ha! ha! ha!  _Tall._ Well said, Master Emperor! ha! ha! ha! but I will new robe your Imperial Majesty. [_Apart to LACKLAND._] I'll touch him for a coat for you--A man of high taste in our modes. [_Apart to the COLONEL._] I'll try and get him to change a suit with you.  _Lack._ Why, I must say, I'm somewhat partial to the Newmarket style.  _Colonel E._ I tink his coat look de Oldmarket style.  _Tall._ Yes, but from your coat, and your feathered head, he took you for a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35699"],["title","Fontainbleau; a comic opera.

[_Takes Snuff in a hasty manner._  _Lack._ Colonel, without offence to your nose, lend me your little finger.  _Tall._ Do, he'll give it you again.  _Colonel E._ [_Shaking Hands with LACKLAND._] Ah, I see he is de true Englishman; for he has de courage to fight, and de good nature to forgive.--Mr. Lackland, vill you dine vid me to-morrow?  _Lack._ Dine! my dear fellow, I'll breakfast with you--I'll stay a whole month in your house.  _Colonel E._ [_With Joy._] Indeed!  _Tall._ Yes, and you'll find it cursed hard to get him out of it, he's so friendly.  _Colonel E._ [_To LACKLAND._] Gi' me your hand--You're a most hospitable fellow! Zounds! Damme!  _Lack._ Oh, pray, Tallyho, isn't that your sister Celia?  _Tall._ [_Looking._] Yes, that's sister Celia.  _Lack._ Haven't seen her some time--A fine girl, indeed!  _Tall._ I wish I'd left her behind, in Paris.--Badger'd--pestered with petticoats, when one has their betts and their business to mind.  _Colonel E._ I vill vait on de lady.  _Lack._ Yes, we'll all wait on the lady.--I shall engage her hand at the ball to-night.  _Tall._ Lackland, be quiet: she has a fortune.  _Lack._ Well, has her money spoiled her dancing?  _Tall._ No; but I am her guardian, Master Emperor.  _Lack._ Ha! ha! ha! then, by Heaven! I'll attack Miss Buffalo, or what is that--the grocer's----  _Tall._ What, then you have thrust your copper face into Sir John Bull's family?  _Lack._ Bull! ay, I thought it was some beast or other.  _Colonel E._ Oh, my Lady de Bull--Oh, dat is she, dat is recommend to me by a noble duke in Paris.  _Tall._ The daughter Doll is a fine filly--We start for matrimony, on our return to Paris.  _Lack._ After dinner, I'll challenge him in pint bumpers of Casey's burgundy.  _Colonel E._ And I sall shake an elbow, and set de merry caster.  _Tall._ Very well, very well, gentlemen, have at you both--yoicks--hurrah!   AIR.--TALLYHO.    _I'm yours at any sort of fun,             My buck, I'll tell you so;   A main to fight, a nag to run,   But say the word, 'tis done and done,             All's one to Tallyho._    _Upon a single card I'll set             A thousand pound, or so.   But name the thing, I'll bind the bet,   And, if I lose, I'll scorn to fret;             All's one to Tallyho._    _Suppose you challenge in a glass,             Sweet Doll, my pretty Doe;   And think your love could mine surpass,   I'd swallow hogsheads, for my lass,             All's one to Tallyho._                                                                  [Exeunt.       _Enter CELIA, calling after them._  _Celia._ Brother! why, brother! was there ever such a mad mortal! Lud, I wish he'd left me in Paris. I wish I hadn't left England--Fontainbleau!--better to have shone on the Steyne, at Brighton--Bless me! I wish I had only one dear beau, if but to keep me out o'the way o'the coaches--talk of French gallantry, and attention to the ladies! I protest, we've quite spoiled them--No, I find I have no chance here, while rivalled by Eclipse, Gimcrack, and Whirligig--Now, if love would but throw the handsome officer in my way, that entertained me so agreeably at the Sunday opera, at Paris.       _Enter HENRY and ROSA._  _Henry._ [_Seeing CELIA._] Yes, 'tis she, 'tis my charming unknown.                                                                 [_Aside._  _Celia._ Is that lady with him? [_ROSA takes HENRY'S Arm._] takes him by the arm!--I wonder women haven't some regard to decency, in public!                                                         [_Exit, singing._  _Rosa._ [_Agitated, and looking about._] If Lord Winlove follows me,--death to him, or my brother, must be the consequence. [_Aside._] Henry, if you design to take me to the convent to-night, we shall be too late--the gate's shut at vespers.  _Henry._ [_Looking after CELIA,_] 'Sdeath, if I lose her now, difficult, perhaps, to meet again--and, if I quit Rosa, she'll----       _Enter LAPOCHE._  _Lap._ Ah, Mademoiselle Rosa! I'm glad you have escape from dat cruel rogue of a--[_HENRY turns._] my dear friend, I am so overjoice I overtake a you--I did vash you all over dis great horse field--I did ask a for you all de littel jockeyboy, and I vas vip, and push, and kick, and tump about, from dis a post, to dat a post--  _Henry._ Well, pray what did you want with me?  _Lep._ Only in your hurry, I did forget to give you de receipt for your lodging money.  _Henry._ Oh, I forgot to pay you, that's it; but I wasn't gone.--[_Looking out._] If she mixes in that crowd, I shall certainly lose her--may I venture to leave Rosa in this fellow's care? [_Aside._] Lepoche, I want to speak to a person yonder, you'll oblige me exceedingly, if you'll not quit this lady till I return.  _Lep._ [_Apart._] I varrant I vil stick close.  _Henry._ Rosa, I shall be back in a few minutes.

Tell me, man--I mean the gentleman that--has that gentleman been to inquire for me since?  _Lep._ Ah, sly coquin--I have hear all about you--You, 'scape from de convent in man's coat, to de gentleman--den here you run avay vid de captain from de gentleman, and now, I see it in your eye, you vant to run back to de gentleman again.  _Rosa._ You're not much out there.  _Lep._ I see she love me ver much. [_Aside._] I vill go see vere de captain is got--hush you little devil of a sly pretty rogue!                                                                  [_Exit._  _Rosa._ How perverse! by loitering here, Lord Winlove and Henry must certainly meet, and I have the worst to dread from their violence of temper.       _Enter LAPOCHE._  _Lap._ All is safe--your captain is facing up to anoder lady--come to my house vid me.  _Rosa._ 'Tis certainly the surest, and speediest means of seeing my lord again--then the necessity of relieving him from the anxiety, into which, my absence must have thrown him--I'm strongly tempted, notwithstanding the impertinence of this fellow.  _Lep._ She ver fond of me, vonce I have her in my power, if she be unkind--up I lock her for de Lady Abbess. [_Aside._] Oh, you pretty pattern for a tailor's wife--I do adore de dimple of your chin--your hand soft as Englis broad cloth--your lip, Genoa velvet, and your eye bright as de Birmingham button.    SCENE II.       _Another Part of the Course._       _Enter CELIA and HENRY._  _Henry._ Charming creature! since the joy inspired by your conversation at the opera, and the grief of such a hopeless parting, to the instant of this lucky meeting, I have not enjoyed a moment's peace.  _Celia._ You think this a lucky meeting, sir; I congratulate you on your good fortune, and leave you to the enjoyment of your happiness.                               [_Courtesies and going, he takes her Hand._  _Henry._ One moment, my love!  _Celia._ Very fine, this; so here my captive presumes to make his conqueror a prisoner of war!  _Henry._ I am your captive, your slave--thus I kiss my chain; [_Kisses her Hand._] and thus on my knee--  _Celia._ Stop, you'll soil your regimentals.  _Henry._ Dear, charming--[_Aside._] I wish I knew her name.  _Celia._ Ha! ha! ha! do forgive me.  _Henry._ I am enchanted with your gaiety, charmed with your beauty--  _Celia._ 'Pray, were you ever enchanted, or charmed before?  _Henry._ But never lov'd till now.  _Celia._ Oh, if you're serious, I must--Come, come, come, I'll talk no more to you; walk that way, and I'll walk this way.  _Henry._ Nay, but my angel--  _Celia._ Well, well, I know all that, but if you really expect to meet me in the field again, you must send me a challenge by my brother--Eh--but I'll not tell you, for you seem to be conceited enough already.   AIR.--CELIA.    _No hurry I'm in to be married,     But if it's the will of my brother,           I'd much rather stay,           Yet, since in the way,   I as well may have you as another._    _A strange custom this, to be marry'd,     Though follow'd by father and mother,         The grave and the gay,         But, since in the way,   I as well may have you as another._    _A prude, though she long to be marry'd,     Endeavours her wishes to smother,         I'd give you her nay,         But, since in the way,   I as well may have you as another._                                                                    [Exit.  _Henry._ Charming woman!  _Tallyho._ [_Without._] Yoics! I'll bring in the stragglers--I'm the boy to fill the rooms, and empty the bottles.  _Henry._ Oh, here's Tallyho--as this brother she speaks of, is a man of the turf, probably he knows him--I'll just ask him, and--then for my sister Rosa.       _Enter TALLYHO._  _Tall._ I'm an excellent whipper-in for the bottle--Oh, ho! [_Looking at HENRY, then takes him under the Arm._] Come along.  _Henry._ Where?  _Tall._ To get drunk, to be sure--You wear his Majesty's cloth, and go to bed sober, when my English Whirligig has beat the mounseers!--Such a pack of jolly dogs! such burgundy!--won't you come and get drunk with us?  _Henry._ Certainly, my boy--but, pray, Tallyho, can you tell me--you saw the young lady that parted from me now--admirably handsome!----  _Tall._ Handsome! Yes, every body says she's like me.  _Henry._ I shall soon call her mine.  _Tall._ The devil you shall!  _Henry._ I have some hopes; the only"]]]
