The girls helped to bind it, and Jimmy Mulcahy carted it in return for three days' binding Dad put in for him.  The stack was n't built twenty-four hours when a score of somebody's crawling cattle ate their way up to their tails in it. We took the hint and put a sapling fence round it.  Again Dad decided to go up country for a while.  He caught Emelina after breakfast, rolled up a blanket, told us to watch the stack, and started. The crows followed.  We were having dinner.  Dave said, \"Listen!\"  We listened, and it seemed as though all the crows and other feathered demons of the wide bush were engaged in a mighty scrimmage.  \"Dad's back!\" Dan said, and rushed out in the lead of a stampede.  Emelina was back, anyway, with the swag on, but Dad was n't.  We caught her, and Dave pointed to white spots all over the saddle, and said--\"Hanged if they have n't been ridin' her!\"--meaning the crows.  Mother got anxious, and sent Dan to see what had happened.  Dan found Dad, with his shirt off, at a pub on the main road, wanting to fight the publican for a hundred pounds, but could n't persuade him to come home. Two men brought him home that night on a sheep-hurdle, and he gave up the idea of going away.  After all, the barley turned out well--there was a good price that year, and we were able to run two wires round the paddock.  One day a bulky Government letter came.  Dad looked surprised and pleased, and how his hand trembled as he broke the seal!  \"THE DEEDS!\" he said, and all of us gathered round to look at them.  Dave thought they were like the inside of a bear-skin covered with writing.  Dad said he would ride to town at once, and went for Emelina.  \"Could n't y' find her, Dad?\" Dan said, seeing him return without the mare.  Dad cleared his throat, but did n't answer.  Mother asked him.  \"Yes, I FOUND her,\" he said slowly, \"DEAD.\"  The crows had got her at last.  He wrapped the deeds in a piece of rag and walked.  There was nothing, scarcely, that he did n't send out from town, and Jimmy Mulcahy and old Anderson many and many times after that borrowed our dray.  Now Dad regularly curses the deeds every mail-day, and wishes to Heaven he had never got them.     Chapter IV.  When the Wolf was at the Door.   There had been a long stretch of dry weather, and we were cleaning out the waterhole.  Dad was down the hole shovelling up the dirt; Joe squatted on the brink catching flies and letting them go again without their wings--a favourite amusement of his; while Dan and Dave cut a drain to turn the water that ran off the ridge into the hole--when it rained.  Dad was feeling dry, and told Joe to fetch him a drink.  Joe said:  \"See first if this cove can fly with only one wing.\" Then he went, but returned and said:  \"There's no water in the bucket--Mother used the last drop to boil th' punkins,\" and renewed the fly-catching. Dad tried to spit, and was going to say something when Mother, half-way between the house and the waterhole, cried out that the grass paddock was all on fire.  \"So it is, Dad!\" said Joe,  slowly but surely dragging the head off a fly with finger and thumb.  Dad scrambled out of the hole and looked.  \"Good God!\" was all he said. How he ran!  All of us rushed after him except Joe--he could n't run very well, because the day before he had ridden fifteen miles on a poor horse, bare-back.  When near the fire Dad stopped running to break a green bush. He hit upon a tough one.  Dad was in a hurry.  The bush was n't.  Dad swore and tugged with all his might.  Then the bush broke and Dad fell heavily upon his back and swore again.  To save the cockatoo fence that was round the cultivation was what was troubling Dad.  Right and left we fought the fire with boughs.  Hot! It was hellish hot!  Whenever there was a lull in the wind we worked. Like a wind-mill Dad's bough moved--and how he rushed for another when one was used up!  Once we had the fire almost under control; but the wind rose again, and away went the flames higher and faster than ever.  \"It's no use,\" said Dad at last, placing his hand on his head, and throwing down his bough.  We did the same, then stood and watched the fence go. After supper we went out again and saw it still burning.  Joe asked Dad if he did n't think it was a splendid sight?  Dad did n't answer him--he did n't seem conversational that night.  We decided to put the fence up again.  Dan had sharpened the axe with a broken file, and he and Dad were about to start when Mother asked them what was to be done about flour?  She said she had shaken the bag to get enough to make scones for that morning's breakfast, and unless some was got somewhere there would be no bread for dinner.  Dad reflected, while Dan felt the edge on the axe with his thumb.  Dad said, \"Won't Missus Dwyer let you have a dishful until we get some?\"  \"No,\" Mother answered; \"I can't ask her until we send back what we owe them.\"  Dad reflected again.  \"The Andersons, then?\" he said.  Mother shook her head and asked what good there was it sending to them when they, only that morning, had sent to her for some?  \"Well, we must do the best we can at present,\" Dad answered, \"and I'll go to the store this evening and see what is to be done.\"  Putting the fence up again in the hurry that Dad was in was the very devil!  He felled the saplings--and such saplings!--TREES many of them were--while we, \"all of a muck of sweat,\" dragged them into line.  Dad worked like a horse himself, and expected us to do the same.  \"Never mind staring about you,\" he'd say, if he caught us looking at the sun to see if it were coming dinner-time--\"there's no time to lose if we want to get the fence up and a crop in.\"  Dan worked nearly as hard as Dad until he dropped the butt-end of a heavy sapling on his foot, which made him hop about on one leg and say that he was sick and tired of the dashed fence.  Then he argued with Dad, and declared that it would be far better to put a wire-fence up at once, and be done with it, instead of wasting time over a thing that would only be burnt down again.  \"How long,\" he said, \"will it take to get the posts? Not a week,\" and he hit the ground disgustedly with a piece of stick he had in his hand.  \"Confound it!\" Dad said, \"have n't you got any sense, boy? What earthly use would a wire-fence be without any wire in it?\"  Then we knocked off and went to dinner.  No one appeared in any humour to talk at the table.  Mother sat silently at the end and poured out the tea while Dad, at the head, served the pumpkin and divided what cold meat there was.  Mother would n't have any meat--one of us would have to go without if she had taken any.  I don't know if it was on account of Dan arguing with him, or if it was because there was no bread for dinner, that Dad was in a bad temper; anyway, he swore at Joe for coming to the table with dirty hands.  Joe cried and said that he could n't wash them when Dave, as soon as he had washed  his, had thrown the water out.  Then Dad scowled at Dave, and Joe passed his plate along for more pumpkin.  Dinner was almost over when Dan, still looking hungry, grinned and asked Dave if he was n't going to have some BREAD?  Whereupon Dad jumped up in a tearing passion.  \"D--n your insolence!\" he said to Dan, \"make a jest of it, would you?\"  \"Who's jestin'?\" Dan answered and grinned again.  \"Go!\" said Dad, furiously, pointing to the door, \"leave my roof, you thankless dog!\"  Dan went that night.  It was only upon Dad promising faithfully to reduce his account within two months that the storekeeper let us have another bag of flour on credit. And what a change that bag of flour wrought!  How cheerful the place became all at once!  And how enthusiastically Dad spoke of the farm and the prospects of the coming season!  Four months had gone by.  The fence had been up some time and ten acres of wheat put in; but there had been no rain, and not a grain had come up, or was likely to.  Nothing had been heard of Dan since his departure.  Dad spoke about him to Mother.  \"The scamp!\" he said, \"to leave me just when I wanted help--after all the years I've slaved to feed him and clothe him, see what thanks I get! but, mark my word, he'll be glad to come back yet.\" But Mother would never say anything against Dan.  The weather continued dry.  The wheat did n't come up, and Dad became despondent again.  The storekeeper called every week and reminded Dad of his promise.  \"I would give it you willingly,\" Dad would say, \"if I had it, Mr. Rice; but what can I do?  You can't knock blood out of a stone.\"  We ran short of tea, and Dad thought to buy more with the money Anderson owed him for some fencing he had done; but when he asked for it, Anderson was very sorry he had n't got it just then, but promised to let him have it as soon as he could sell his chaff.  When Mother heard Anderson could n't pay, she DID cry, and said there was n't a bit of sugar in the house, nor enough cotton to mend the children's bits of clothes.  We could n't very well go without tea, so Dad showed Mother how to make a new kind.  He roasted a slice of bread on the fire till it was like a black coal, then poured the boiling water over it and let it \"draw\" well. Dad said it had a capital flavour--HE liked it.  Dave's only pair of pants were pretty well worn off him; Joe had n't a decent coat for Sunday; Dad himself wore a pair of boots with soles tied on with wire; and Mother fell sick.  Dad did all he could--waited on her, and talked hopefully of the fortune which would come to us some day; but once, when talking to Dave, he broke down, and said he did n't, in the name of the Almighty God, know what he would do!  Dave could n't say anything--he moped about, too, and home somehow did n't seem like home at all.  When Mother was sick and Dad's time was mostly taken up nursing her; when there was nothing, scarcely, in the house; when, in fact, the wolf was at the very door;--Dan came home with a pocket full of money and swag full of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3677"],["title","On Our Selection (#3)"],["body"," clothes.  How Dad shook him by the hand and welcomed him back! And how Dan talked of \"tallies\", \"belly-wool\", and \"ringers\" and implored Dad, over and over again, to go shearing, or rolling up, or branding--ANYTHING rather than work and starve on the selection.  That's fifteen years ago, and Dad is still on the farm.     Chapter V.  The Night We Watched For Wallabies.   It had been a bleak July day, and as night came on a bitter westerly howled through the trees.  Cold! was n't it cold!  The pigs in the sty, hungry and half-fed (we wanted for ourselves the few pumpkins that had survived the drought) fought savagely with each other for shelter, and squealed all the time like--well, like pigs.  The cows and calves left the place to seek shelter away in the mountains; while the draught horses, their hair standing up like barbed-wire, leaned sadly over the fence and gazed up at the green lucerne.  Joe went about shivering in an old coat of Dad's with only one sleeve to it--a calf had fancied the other one day that Dad hung it on a post as a mark to go by while ploughing.  \"My! it'll be a stinger to-night,\" Dad remarked to Mrs. Brown--who sat, cold-looking, on the sofa--as he staggered inside with an immense log for the fire.  A log! Nearer a whole tree!  But wood was nothing in Dad's eyes.  Mrs. Brown had been at our place five or six days.  Old Brown called occasionally to see her, so we knew they could n't have quarrelled. Sometimes she did a little house-work, but more often she did n't.  We talked it over together, but could n't make it out.  Joe asked Mother, but she had no idea--so she said.  We were full up, as Dave put it, of Mrs. Brown, and wished her out of the place.  She had taken to ordering us about, as though she had something to do with us.  After supper we sat round the fire--as near to it as we could without burning ourselves--Mrs. Brown and all, and listened to the wind whistling outside.  Ah, it was pleasant beside the fire listening to the wind!  When Dad had warmed himself back and front he turned to us and said:  \"Now, boys, we must go directly and light some fires and keep those wallabies back.\"  That was a shock to us, and we looked at him to see if he were really in earnest.  He was, and as serious as a judge.  \"TO-NIGHT!\" Dave answered, surprisedly--\"why to-night any more than last night or the night before?  Thought you had decided to let them rip?\"  \"Yes, but we might as well keep them off a bit longer.\"  \"But there's no wheat there for them to get now.  So what's the good of watching them?  There's no sense in THAT.\"  Dad was immovable.  \"Anyway\"--whined Joe--\"I'M not going--not a night like this--not when I ain't got boots.\"  That vexed Dad.  \"Hold your tongue, sir!\" he said--\"you'll do as you're told.\"  But Dave had n't finished.  \"I've been following that harrow since sunrise this morning,\" he said, \"and now you want me to go chasing wallabies about in the dark, a night like this, and for nothing else but to keep them from eating the ground.  It's always the way here, the more one does the more he's wanted to do,\" and he commenced to cry. Mrs. Brown had something to say.  SHE agreed with Dad and thought we ought to go, as the wheat might spring up again.  \"Pshah!\" Dave blurted out between his sobs, while we thought of telling her to shut her mouth.  Slowly and reluctantly we left that roaring fireside to accompany Dad that bitter night.  It WAS a night!--dark as pitch, silent, forlorn and forbidding, and colder than the busiest morgue.  And just to keep wallabies from eating nothing!  They HAD eaten all the wheat--every blade of it--and the grass as well.  What they would start on next--ourselves or the cart-harness--was n't quite clear.  We stumbled along in the dark one behind the other, with our hands stuffed into our trousers.  Dad was in the lead, and poor Joe, bare-shinned and bootless, in the rear.  Now and again he tramped on a Bathurst-burr, and, in sitting down to extract the prickle, would receive a cluster of them elsewhere.  When he escaped the burr it was only to knock his shin against a log or leave a toe-nail or two clinging to a stone.  Joe howled, but the wind howled louder, and blew and blew.  Dave, in pausing to wait on Joe, would mutter:  \"To HELL with everything!  Whatever he wants bringing us out a night like this, I'm DAMNED if I know!\"  Dad could n't see very well in the dark, and on this night could n't see at all, so he walked up against one of the old draught horses that had fallen asleep gazing at the lucerne.  And what a fright they both got! The old horse took it worse than Dad--who only tumbled down--for he plunged as though the devil had grabbed him, and fell over the fence, twisting every leg he had in the wires.  How the brute struggled!  We stood and listened to him.  After kicking panels of the fence down and smashing every wire in it, he got loose and made off, taking most of it with him.  \"That's one wallaby on the wheat, anyway,\" Dave muttered, and we giggled. WE understood Dave; but Dad did n't open his mouth.  We lost no time lighting the fires.  Then we walked through the \"wheat\" and wallabies!  May Satan reprove me if I exaggerate their number by one solitary pair of ears--but from the row and scatter they made there were a MILLION.  Dad told Joe, at last, he could go to sleep if he liked, at the fire. Joe went to sleep--HOW, I don't know.  Then Dad sat beside him, and for long intervals would stare silently into the darkness.  Sometimes a string of the vermin would hop past close to the fire, and another time a curlew would come near and screech its ghostly wail, but he never noticed them. Yet he seemed to be listening.  We mooched around from fire to fire, hour after hour, and when we wearied of heaving fire-sticks at the enemy we sat on our heels and cursed the wind, and the winter, and the night-birds alternately.  It was a lonely, wretched occupation.  Now and again Dad would leave his fire to ask us if we could hear a noise. We could n't, except that of wallabies and mopokes.  Then he would go back and listen again.  He was restless, and, somehow, his heart was n't in the wallabies at all.  Dave could n't make him out.  The night wore on.  By-and-by there was a sharp rattle of wires, then a rustling noise, and Sal appeared in the glare of the fire.  \"DAD!\" she said.  That was all.  Without a word, Dad bounced up and went back to the house with her.  \"Something's up!\" Dave said, and, half-anxious, half-afraid, we gazed into the fire and thought and thought.  Then we stared, nervously, into the night, and listened for Dad's return, but heard only the wind and the mopoke.  At dawn he appeared again, with a broad smile on his face, and told us that mother had got another baby--a fine little chap.  Then we knew why Mrs. Brown had been staying at our place.     Chapter VI.  Good Old Bess.   Supper was over at Shingle Hut, and we were all seated round the fire--all except Joe.  He was mousing.  He stood on the sofa with one ear to the wall in a listening attitude, and brandished a table-fork. There were mice--mobs of them--between the slabs and the paper--layers of newspapers that had been pasted one on the other for years until they were an inch thick; and whenever Joe located a mouse he drove the fork into the wall and pinned it--or reckoned he did.  Dad sat pensively at one corner of the fire-place--Dave at the other with his elbows on his knees and his chin resting in his palms.  \"Think you could ride a race, Dave?\" asked Dad.  \"Yairs,\" answered Dave, without taking his eyes off the fire, or his chin from his palms--\"could, I suppose, if I'd a pair o' lighter boots 'n these.\"  Again they reflected.  Joe triumphantly held up the mutilated form of a murdered mouse and invited the household to \"Look!\"  No one heeded him.  \"Would your Mother's go on you?\"  \"Might,\" and Dave spat into the fire.  \"Anyway,\" Dad went on, \"we must have a go at this handicap with the old mare; it's worth trying for, and, believe me, now! she'll surprise a few of their flash hacks, will Bess.\"  \"Yairs, she can go all right.\" And Dave spat again into the fire.  \"GO!  I've never known anything to keep up with her.  Why, bless my soul, seventeen years ago, when old Redwood owned her, there was n't a horse in the district could come within coo-ee of her.  All she wants is a few feeds of corn and a gallop or two, and mark my words she'll show some of them the way.\"  Some horse-races were being promoted by the shanty-keeper at the Overhaul--seven miles from our selection.  They were the first of the kind held in the district, and the stake for the principal event was five pounds.  It was n't because Dad was a racing man or subject to turf hallucinations in any way that he thought of preparing Bess for the meeting.  We sadly needed those five pounds, and, as Dad put it, if the mare could only win, it would be an easier and much quicker way of making a bit of money than waiting for a crop to grow.  Bess was hobbled and put into a two-acre paddock near the house.  We put her there because of her wisdom.  She was a chestnut, full of villainy, an absolutely incorrigible old rogue.  If at any time she was wanted when in the grass paddock, it required the lot of us from Dad down to yard her, as well as the dogs, and every other dog in the neighbourhood.  Not that she had any brumby element in her--she would have been easier to yard if she had--but she would drive steadily enough, alone or with other horses, until she saw the yard, when she would turn and deliberately walk away. If we walked to head her she beat us by half a length; if we ran she ran, and stopped when we stopped.  That was the aggravating part of her!  When it was only to go to the store or the post-office that we wanted her, we could have walked there and back a dozen times before we could run her down; but, somehow, we generally preferred to work hard catching her rather than walk.  When we had spent half "]]]
