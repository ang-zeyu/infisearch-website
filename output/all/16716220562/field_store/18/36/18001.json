I'm glad that beastly thing's gone. It gives a fellow a peculiar sensation somewhere in the region of the stomach. What's the time?\"  \"About eleven, I should imagine,\" replied Barcroft. \"I won't strike a match. Well, I suppose the Zep. has missed Barborough by this time--unless she's slowed down and circling over the town,\" he added in an undertone.  They were descending into one of the numerous valleys that lay betwixt them and Tarleigh. The effluvium of a neighbouring bleaching works was wafted to their nostrils.  \"Rufford's Works,\" explained Entwistle. \"Lucky that Zep didn't drop a bomb. There are hundreds of gallons of benzine stored there.... Yes, I fancy it's all right as far as Barborough is concerned. Wish a car would overtake us. Notwithstanding the fine night I don't feel particularly keen for a long tramp.\"  \"Let me give you a shakedown at Ladybird Fold,\" suggested Peter. \"You can telephone through to Barborough and let your wife know where you are.\"  \"No, no, my dear fellow,\" protested Entwistle. \"It's imposing on your good nature. Besides, you mentioned that your son was coming home on leave.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Barcroft. \"Wonder if he's arrived yet, or is held up at some out-of-the-way railway station or in a tunnel. That won't make any difference. If it did I shouldn't have mentioned the matter. I can be as confoundedly blunt as you Lancashire people when I want.\"  \"So I believe,\" rejoined Entwistle tersely. \"Well, I'll accept your offer with pleasure. Now for the next hill. It's a regular brute, even for this part of the world. When a fellow is past forty he's not so good at this sort of work as he was. One has to admit the fact however much one tries to stifle the discovery. I used to pride myself on being a runner, and it came as a nasty shock when my fifteen-year-old son beat me in a 440 sprint--not by so very much, though,\" he added in defence of his bygone prowess.  \"The third milestone,\" announced Peter pointing to a weatherbeaten slab just visible in the gloom.  \"Yes, and the highest part of the road,\" added Entwistle. \"It is about----\".  He stopped abruptly. Away to the southward a vivid flash illuminated the sky, followed by three more in quick succession. Summer lightning would pale into insignificance compared with the intensity of those momentary sheets of lurid light.  \"Good heavens--Barborough!\" ejaculated the vet.  Barcroft made no remark. Failing his inability to read the face of his watch he placed the fingers of his right hand on his left wrist and carefully counted the pulse beats.  \"Forty-five!\" he announced calmly as the first of four loud detonations rent the air.  Crash--crash--crash--crash. It was as if he had been inside a tin bath and some one was belabouring it with a wooden mallet. Even allowing for the distance of the source of the sound the din was terrible.  A minute later came two more flashes, almost simultaneously, with forty-eight beats before the reports. Then one solitary flash followed by an even greater interval ere the detonation was heard.  \"The brutes!\" muttered Entwistle.  Again Peter made no audible comment. He was making a rapid mental calculation. Seventy pulsations to a minute: sound travels at roughly 365 yards to a second. Yes, that placed the scene of the raid at a distance of nine miles, and judging by the direction it was that populous town that had been the target for the missiles of the Zeppelin.  \"She's gone, at any rate,\" he said.  \"Yes, but goodness only knows what damage she's done in that minute and a half,\" added Entwistle. \"What's more we're between her and that cursed Germany. Come on, man, let's hasten.\"  It was half-past twelve as the two pedestrians made their way through the village of Scatterbeck. Almost the whole of the population was astir, discussing in the shrill rapid Lancashire dialect the totally unexpected visit of the aerial raider. Thrice enquiries on the part of Barcroft and his companion brought the disconcerting information that no vehicle of any description was available. There was nothing for it but to continue their long tramp.  At length the summit of Tarleigh Hill was surmounted. Here they encountered a belated wayfarer--a watchman from the neighbouring works.  \"Eh, ma√§ster,\" he replied to an anxious question. \"I'm thinkin' 'tes Barborough right enow. Seed 'em drop mysen, an' agen ower Percombe way. Eh, but there'll be a rush to t' recruitin' office after this. Lancashire's done main well in sojerin', but this'll cap everythin'. This night's work'll cost that there Kayser summat when the Barborough lads in t' trenches get to know o' it.\"  \"That fellow's right,\" commented Mr. Barcroft after the watchman had taken a by-road. \"These Zeps, do very little military damage. They don't intimidate or terrify the people, except, perhaps, those in the actual district raided. The German bombs are like the dragon's teeth of mythology; sown, they spring up as British soldiers, eager to avenge themselves upon the Kaiser's troops. If I had my way I'd run cheap excursions to the raided areas from Bristol, Exeter and other towns as yet not troubled with the Zeps. to let the people see the damage done to British homes. That would stir their imaginations and let 'em think strongly. Instead, all details of raids are kept, or are endeavoured to be kept, a profound secret by our wiseacres in authority. The report of the damage done is minimised--not that I would suggest making the news public as far as buildings of military importance are concerned--and the result is that the phlegmatic Briton who is not directly affected by the raid merely reads the bald newspaper account, mentally consigns the Government to perdition and forgets all about it.\"  \"According to that American lecturer, Curtin, they do things better in France,\" added Entwistle. \"The French allow full descriptions of the Zeppelin raids in their country to be published, and the result is discouraging to the Huns. At the time we were referring to these raids taking place in the 'eastern counties,' when the Germans knew exactly where they had been. I shouldn't wonder if this night's affair is described as taking place on the East Coast or the South Midlands instead of within sight of the Irish Sea.\"  \"And yet nothing did more to depress the Germans than the humorous and true accounts of the Zep, raids that were eventually allowed to appear in the British newspapers.\"  \"Except when we do bag half a dozen of them at one swoop,\" added the vet. \"Mark my words, we'll get our own back with interest.\"  \"What's the matter?\" asked Peter, noticing that his companion had reduced his pace and was limping slightly.  \"Galled heel, worse luck,\" replied the vet. Even in the darkness Barcroft could discern his face twitching. \"But it's nothing. I'll stick it.\"  \"Look here,\" declared Barcroft authoritatively. There were times when the easy-going Peter could make himself obeyed. \"It's all jolly rot your carrying on. You'll be lame in another mile. You must stick to the original programme, and stop at my place. What's happened at Barborough has happened, and your presence there to-night won't mend matters. Besides, there's the telephone.\"  Entwistle capitulated. In fact he was in great pain. The injury to his foot was more than he cared to admit. Not only was his heel badly chafed, but he had twisted his ankle on a loose stone.  \"All right,\" he replied. \"But suppose I can't get through on the 'phone?\"  \"You will,\" said Barcroft confidently. \"Now: hang on to my arm. It's only a couple of hundred yards up the hill.\"  The last two hundred yards was a pilgrimage of pain. The approach was along a narrow lane paved with irregular slabs and enshrouded: with trees that threw the path into even greater gloom than the high road. The blackness was so intense that it appeared to have weight--to press upon their eyeballs like a tightly adjusted bandage. Away to the left came the gurgle of a mountain stream as it flowed swiftly through a deep cutting in the rocks.  \"Here we are,\" said Peter at last.  \"Yes,\" agreed Entwistle. \"I know the place.\"  They were now clear of the trees. Looming mistily against the dark sky was a long, rambling, two-storeyed building surrounded by a roughly built stone wall. The latticed windows were heavily curtained. Not a light nor a sound came from the isolated dwelling.  \"So Billy hasn't turned up yet,\" remarked Barcroft senior as he fumbled for his key. \"Why, by Jove, the door's wide open!\"     CHAPTER V  AT LADYBIRD FOLD   \"COME in,\" he continued, assisting his companion over the threshold. \"I won't switch a light on in the hall until I close the door. Jolly queer about it being open. There'll be a court of enquiry in the morning.\"  A violent scratching upon the study door attracted his attention.  \"That's Ponto and Nan--my sheep-dogs,\" he explained. \"Wonder why they are locked in? They ought to be in the kennels. They're quiet enough: they won't bite.\"  Entwistle smiled grimly. Peter's idea of quiet seemed rather peculiar, for the animals were barking furiously and redoubling their attacks upon the door.  \"The paintwork?\" echoed Barcroft in answer to his companion's enquiry, as he proceeded to hang up his cap and coat. \"Oh, that won't matter. You see, there's a curtain on the inside and that hides the marks.\"  He opened the door of the study, to be greeted with a blaze of dazzling light and a couple of shaggy-haired dogs, who hurled themselves upon him in an ecstasy of delight.  \"Down, down, both of you! Kennel up,\" ordered their master.  The dogs obeyed, Ponto retiring to the limited space between the pedestals of the roll-top desk while Nan bounded into the large arm-chair by the fire.  \"That's better,\" said Barcroft composedly, glancing at the desk to see if any letter had arrived. \"Now take it easy for a bit. There's the telephone. I'll scout round and see what's going. Whisky? Good! Excuse me a minute"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35362"],["title","Billy Barcroft, R.N.A.S.: A Story of the Great War (#5)"],["body","I look for some stuff for your foot.\"  Philip Entwistle settled himself in the only vacant arm-chair and took stock of his immediate surroundings. The study was a fairly large room, measuring, roughly, thirty feet by twenty. On the side facing south were three broad casement windows, now heavily curtained with a light-proof fabric. The door was on the eastern side, opening into a spacious hall. The remaining walls were blank except for the old-fashioned fireplace. Oak panelling and massive beams of the same material--wood that had been in position for close on three hundred years--gave an old-time appearance to the room. The furniture was hardly in keeping with the place. Presumably it was for utility. The large pedestal, roll-top desk occupied a proportionate position against the west wall. Almost every available bit of wall-space was taken up with book-cases groaning under the weight of volumes of all sizes and ages, from the leatherbound tomes of the late Stuart period to the modern \"sevenpenny.\" Not a picture was in evidence. Instead, above the book-shelves the walls were adorned with pieces of medieval armour and weapons ranging from the Elizabethan musketoon and pike to the latest type of magazine rifle. Above the fireplace was a seven-feet-scale model of a super-Dreadnought that, in its sombre garb of battleship grey, contrasted strongly with the black and yellow striped hull and dun-coloured canvas of an eighteenth century frigate that adorned another part of the room.  The study, like the rest of the house, was lighted by electricity--a discovery that Peter Barcroft had made with huge satisfaction. It was, indeed, a rare chance to hit upon an isolated dwelling, in a commanding, lofty situation, well-built and supplied with water, gas and electricity. The secret lay in the fact that at one time it had been the residence of the manager of the nearest bleaching works. Had it been daylight one would have noticed a line of hefty posts supporting a cable-system that ran up hill and down dale almost as far as the eye could reach. At certain intervals the supports bore a large board on which was painted in bold letters: \"Dangerous--10,000 volts\"--a warning to the youth of the district who might feel tempted to fly kites over the wires or even to climb the poles out of sheer exuberance of juvenile spirits.  It was from this cable by means of a \"transformer\" that Ladybird Fold derived its supply of electric current, and, as it happened, the works had not received any warning that night of the raid--a circumstance that contributed greatly to the comfort of Peter Barcroft's den.  From his chair Entwistle glanced at his host's desk and shuddered. The cover had been left rolled back, disclosing a veritable chaos of papers, reference books, writing materials, pipes and two large tobacco-jars. The pigeon-holes were crammed to bursting-point with a medley of papers, particularly the one labelled \"Letters to be answered.\" From another gaped the crumpled ends of what were evidently a number of cheques that awaited a favourable opportunity on the part of the busy author (he put in an occasional two hours a day, be it remembered) to be paid into the Barborough Bank. A thick layer of dust covered the desk, although everything else in the room was fairly clear if the patches of tobacco ash on the carpet square were not taken into account. It was part of Peter's creed to knock out his pipes on the heel of his boot and deposit their remains on the floor, convenient ash-trays notwithstanding. For one thing it kept the moth away.  The dust, too, upon the desk was the result of studied design. The \"help\" from the village--a temporary importation pending Mrs. Barcroft's return and provided she was successful in her distracting quest--had been strictly enjoined, browbeaten and threatened with divers pains and penalties, not to disturb Peter's papers. With luck he could find what he wanted in five minutes; without, in an hour. That is, if the desk had been left severely alone. Otherwise, should the timorous female dare to \"side-up\"--a Lancashire expression that puzzled Barcroft tremendously at first--the quest would be almost hopeless.  Had Philip Entwistle been more inquisitive and observant he might have noticed that on the top of the pile of literary debris were two objects that showed no signs of a coating of dust. One was a bound volume entitled _The Theories of Modern Naval Warfare_--a work of Peter's that had been responsible for a price being set upon the head of that as yet unconscious-of-the-fact worthy. The other was a batch of manuscript comprising his nearly completed book _The Great Reckoning--and After._  The reappearance of his host with a tray bearing a tantalus, syphon and a couple of glasses, cut short Entwistle's casual survey.  \"How goes it now?\" asked Barcroft. \"Telephoned?\"  \"You certainly said, 'There's the telephone,'\" replied his guest, \"but failed to explain to my satisfaction where 'there' is. Consequently that solemn and protracted rite has not yet been performed.\"  \"Sorry,\" said Peter with a laugh. \"My mistake entirely. I ought to have mentioned that that convenient but much maligned instrument is in the hall. There's a great-coat hanging over it: my device to deaden the nerve-racking sound of the bell.\"  Entwistle shuffled across the room. In spite of the fact that he was now wearing a pair of his host's capacious slippers the injured foot occasioned him more pain than while he was on his way to the house.  He left the door ajar. Barcroft could hear him thumping the as yet unresponsive machine. Quite five minutes passed before his guest could \"get on.\"  \"Number four four five, Barborough ... what--engaged ... no reply? Well, try again.\"  More violent manipulation of the telephone accompanied by a flow of forcible language resulted in the desired object being attained.  \"That you, Vi?... Yes,.. yes,.. no, I wasn't injured ... what's that? Church Street knocked out of existence.... Not nervous? That's good. I'm speaking from Ladybird Fold, Tarleigh. Tell Jarvis to run the car over for me in the morning. Yes, about ten. Good-night.\"  Returning to his study he found Peter at his desk.  \"Needn't have worried so much about my wife,\" he announced. \"She's quite plucky over it. She even chipped me at having missed the excitement.\"  Barcroft did not reply. He was regarding his desk with a distinctly preoccupied air.  \"Dash the L.L.P.\" he exclaimed, addressing the room in general rather than his guest. \"I'll swear she's been meddling with my papers. And she left that door open. I'll let her know who rules this show.\"  \"Who's L.L.P.?\" enquired Entwistle.  His host laughed.  \"Merely the help,\" he replied. \"Carter's her name. I call her Little Liver Pill--she reminds me of one. L.L.P, for short, you know.\"  \"Might be your friend Andrew Norton,\" suggested the other.  \"By Jove, yes! I hadn't thought of that,\" was the reply. \"All the same, I don't think he would touch my desk. It's just likely that in a preoccupied moment (although as a rule he isn't given that way) he may have gone home and left the lights switched on and the door open. Hulloa, this looks queer! I wonder if Norton got into a funk over the Zep.?\"  Barcroft pointed to a pipe lying on the mantelpiece. It was freshly filled and the tobacco was slightly charred, indicating that the owner had been interrupted in the act of lighting up.  \"His pipe,\" he continued. \"And he seems a fairly methodical fellow, not likely to leave anything behind. Hope he's all right. If it wasn't for the fact that I've had a long tramp and it's close on one thirty I'd run across to his place.\"  \"What sort of a man is he?\" enquired Entwistle.  \"Decent--quite. Nothing of the bore about him, or I would have choked him off very quickly,\" replied Barcroft grimly. \"Quite informal, and different from the ordinary type of caller when a fellow comes into a fresh district. You know the sort--stiff-necked blighters of both sexes who pay formal calls for the sole purpose of finding out who you are, what you are and what you've got. In my case, I suppose, they expect to find a sort of untamed curiosity: that's how they regard literary men, I believe. But my time is too precious to waste in that way, so I let them know it pretty quickly. Ah, there are the trains running again,\" he added as a dull rumble was borne to their ears. \"Zep. show's over for to-night. Keen on bed?\"  \"Not very,\" replied Entwistle. \"Are you?\"  \"I'm going to wait up for Billy,\" said the fond parent. \"Wonder what the young bounder is doing now?\"  As he spoke came the sounds of quick, firm footsteps up the cobbled path. Before Peter could get across the room the door was thrown open and Flight-Sub-lieutenant Barcroft, his face blackened with smoke and dust and his great-coat bearing signs of rough usage, burst into the room.  \"Cheer-o, pater!\" he exclaimed. \"Sorry I'm late. Some night, eh, what?\"     CHAPTER VI  KIDNAPPED   IT will now be necessary to set back the hands of the clock to the hour of ten on the evening of the Zeppelin's visit to Barborough.  At that hour Mr. Andrew Norton was knocking on the door of Ladybird Fold, and vainly endeavouring to restrain the boisterous attentions of Ponto and Nan.  \"Good evening, Mrs. Carter,\" he said as the door was opened revealing the domestic stopgap with her head covered by a shawl--the recognised head-dress of the working-class women of industrial Lancashire. \"Any one at home?\"  \"Only mysen, master,\" was the reply. \"An' in another minute you would be findin' me gone. Mr. Barcroft he's out, but he'll not be long, I'm thinkin'. An' young Mr. Barcroft--'im as is in the Navy--is expected home to-night. But come in, you're kindly welcome.\"  \"And at what time is young Mr. Barcroft expected?\" he asked in a tone that implied mild curiosity, as he stepped over the threshold.  \"I'm not for sayin' for certain. Master had a telegram. You'll not be wantin' anythin', sir?\"  Norton"]]]
