Just then came the rapid pop-pop of another motor-bike.  Kenneth, having discovered that his chum was no longer in his company, had returned.  \"Give me a push off, old man,\" panted Rollo, as he set his burden across the carrier and stood astride his steed.  In went the clutch; Kenneth, running by the side of the cycle for a few yards, steadied the wounded sergeant, who was clinging desperately to the young dispatch-rider.  \"All right, let go!\" shouted Rollo.  The bike wobbled dangerously under the unusual burden.  The sergeant's grip wellnigh destroyed the lad's power of command on the steering. The _zipp_ of a bullet did much to add to the difficulty, and momentarily Rollo thought that nothing could save him from toppling into the ditch.  \"Let go my arms and catch hold of my waist,\" he shouted desperately. The sergeant fortunately understood and obeyed; the motor-cycle began to recover its balance, and as Rollo opened the throttle and increased speed it settled down to its normal condition.  On either side the trees seemed to slip past like the spokes of a wheel; the pace was terrific, and although the wounded man must have been suffering agonies, not a groan came from his lips.  Presently Kenneth rode up alongside, for they were out of range and the road was no longer encumbered with the fallen.  Five minutes later the two lads dismounted at the barricade of Argenteau.  Here ready arms relieved Rollo of his burden; soldiers assisted in lifting the cycles over the barrier.  As they did so one of them pointed to one of the tool-bag panniers on Rollo's cycle.  It was pierced by a bullet.  \"Where are you going to?\" demanded a major.  \"To Saint André, to warn a half-company of the 9th regiment to retire, sir.\"  \"It is unnecessary.  The men have already rejoined.  Return to Fort de Barchon and say that if need be we can still hold the enemy in check, but that we are losing heavily.\"  Soon they were back again at Argenteau, with instructions for the remains of the badly-mauled regiment to fall back upon the lines of defence prepared between the two forts in the north-eastern side of the circle surrounding Liége.  The invaders had been delayed sufficiently to allow General Leman to complete his dispositions.  They were yet to learn that even the much-vaunted German infantry could not afford to despise the gallant Belgians.  \"It's a jolly sight better than Rugby, anyway,\" declared Kenneth, as at the end of their first day on active service they returned to their quarters at Fort de Barchon.  But Rollo did not reply.  He was thinking of the bullet hole in the pannier of his cycle.  It had been a narrow squeak.     CHAPTER VI  A Vain Assault  \"I say, how about your sister, old man?\" asked Rollo.  \"She's all right,\" replied Kenneth optimistically.  \"These Germans don't make war on women and girls.  Besides, Madame de la Barre doubtless dropped a little of her standoffishness directly she heard the sound of firing.  I'm pretty sure they are now either safe in Dutch territory or else on their way to Brussels.\"  \"If I had a sister I would be a jolly sight more anxious about her than you are,\" persisted Rollo.  \"Now, how can I help it?  Besides, you don't know Thelma.  She wouldn't, under the circumstances, wait for Madame to give her permission to clear out, and, since Yvonne is her special friend, she'll look after the Major's daughter as well.  I'm sorry we haven't come across Major Résimont since our return.\"  \"He must feel a bit anxious,\" remarked Rollo.  \"About the money he entrusted us with?\" laughed Kenneth.  \"Well, I admit that it was a bit of a risk, for we might have been bowled over by one of those German shells.  Ah! there's another!\"  The two dispatch-riders were under cover at Fort de Barchon, enjoying a hasty meal after their return from their fruitless errand.  It was late in the day, and many hours had elapsed since they had had anything to eat.  It was a kind of preliminary to the period of short rations through which they were to pass.  The German artillery was furtively shelling the Liége forts as a prelude to the general bombardment that was to take place as soon as the shades of night began to fall.  General von Emmich had brought up a force of 88,000 men against the 23,000 Belgian troops manning the Liége defences; but, owing to the difficulty of transporting his heavy guns, the German commander decided to open a furious cannonade with his light field artillery, and to follow up with an assault by means of dense masses of troops.  Soon the cannonade became general, the heaviest of the hostile fire being directed upon Forts d'Évegnée and de Fléron, while Fort de Barchon came in for a hot bombardment.  It was by no means a one-sided encounter.  The Belgian infantry, lying snugly sheltered either in the trenches or in the bomb-proof galleries of the forts, were for the time being inactive.  The Belgian gunners, however, worked their guns in the armoured cupolas with skill, bravery, and precision, and at the end of two hours' bombardment the forts were practically intact.  Kenneth and Rollo, in the galleries of Fort de Barchon, could feel the concussion of the revolving guns and the detonations of the exploding German shells, although they were, like the rest of the infantry, in ignorance of what was taking place.  The inaction was far more nerve-racking than actual exposure with the chance of getting in a shot.  Suddenly above the roar of the artillery came a bugle-call, followed by excited shouts of \"Aux armes!\"  Instantly there was a wild rush to man the parapets on the inner face of the glacis.  \"Come along, old man!\" exclaimed Kenneth.  \"We may as well have a look in.\"  Snatching up a rifle and making sure that the magazine was charged, he dashed out of the gallery, Rollo following hard on his heels.  A weird sight met their eyes.  The blackness of the night was pierced by the dazzling rays of powerful searchlights and punctuated by the rapid flashes from the heavy ordnance.  The thunder of the guns was ear-splitting, the crash of the exploding projectiles appalling, yet the attention of the two lads was directed towards the scene that lay before them.  All along the parapet, protected by sandbags, were the Belgian infantry, ready, with their rifles sighted to 800 yards, to open fire at the word of command.  Beyond the turf of the glacis, where almost every blade of grass stood up under the sweeping rays of the searchlights as if made of gleaming silver, were dense masses of grey-coated, spike-helmeted Germans.  On they came as steadily as if on parade, while between the rapid crashes of the artillery could be distinguished the harsh voices of the men as they sang \"Deutschland über Alles\" and the \"Wacht am Rhein\". The only relief to those grey-clad battalions was the glitter of the forest of bayonets.  If numbers could annihilate, the fate of the comparative handful of Belgians was sealed; but von Emmich had, like many another man, underrated the courage of the plucky little Belgians.  The Germans were now within the danger-zone of shell-fire.  Shrapnel tore ghastly lanes through their serried ranks, but other men were instantly forthcoming to fill up the gaps.  On and on they came till they reached the outer edge of the glacis.  Here the huge fortress-guns in the armoured cupolas could not be sufficiently depressed to do them harm.  The crackle of the Belgian musketry added to the din.  The men, firing steadily, swept away hundreds of their Teutonic foes, but the ant-like swarm of ferocious humanity still swept onwards.  Kenneth and Rollo were firing away as hard as they could thrust home the bolts of the rifles and press trigger.  The hostile gun-fire had now ceased, lest German should fall by German shell.  The infantry, firing with the butts of their rifles at the hip, let loose a terrific volley.  The air was torn by the _zipp_ of the bullets, but for the most part the hail of missiles either flew high or harmlessly expended itself in the soft earth.  Now, in spite of the withering fire, the foremost of the German stormers were almost up to the parapet of the outer defences.  Victory seemed within their grasp.  Their shouts redoubled.  Drunk with the apparent success of their suicidal tactics, they rushed to overwhelm the slender line of Belgian riflemen.  Through the rapidly-drifting clouds of smoke--for there was a strong wind blowing athwart the line of attack--the two British lads could clearly see the features of the exultant foes, as they recklessly plunged straight into the dazzling rays of the searchlight.  Mechanically Kenneth began to wonder what would happen next, for it seemed imminent that bayonet would cross bayonet, and that the handful of Belgian infantry would be cut off to the last man.  Then, even as he faced the enemy, the dense masses of Germans seemed to melt away.  They fell, not in sixes and sevens, but in scores and hundreds, till a barricade of dead prevented the massacre of the living.  The Belgians had machine-guns in readiness to take up the work that the heavier weapons had been obliged to suspend.  The commandant of the 9th regiment of the line saw his chance.  The rattle of the Berthier machine-guns ceased as if by magic, and the shout was heard \"A la baïonnette!\"  Instantly the active Belgians swarmed over the glacis and threw themselves upon the demoralized foe.  The repulse of the Germans became a rout.  Carried away by the enthusiasm of the charge, the British dispatch-riders tore along with their Belgian comrades, Kenneth with rifle and bayonet, while Rollo was brandishing his Mauser and using the butt-end like an exaggerated hockey-stick.  Just in front of them was a little Belgian officer who, on the point of cutting down a burly German major, had arrested the fatal stroke upon the latter crying out for quarter.  The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36500"],["title","The Dispatch-Riders: The Adventures of Two British Motor-cyclists in the Great (#7)"],["body","man, who had been beaten to the ground, tendered his sword, and the Belgian, casting it aside, rushed on to continue the counter-charge.  Before he had taken two strides he fell, hit in the ankle, and Kenneth, who was following, promptly tripped across his body.  The sight of his chum pitching on his face caused Rollo's heart to jump into his mouth.  He stopped, and to his great relief Kenneth regained his feet.  The Belgian also attempted to rise, but could only raise himself to the extent of his outstretched arms.  Rollo was on the point of going to assist his chum, who was directing his attention to the wounded Belgian officer, when he saw the German major stealthily produce his revolver and take aim at the man who had spared his life.  Perhaps it was well for the ungrateful major that Rollo was a keen footballer.  Forgetting that he held a clubbed rifle in his hand the lad took a flying kick; his boot caught the German major on the wrist, and the revolver, exploding harmlessly, went spinning a dozen paces away.  Standing over the recreant officer Rollo swung the butt of his rifle. The German howled for mercy.  \"Hold hard, old man!\" shouted Kenneth, grasping his chum by the shoulder.  He could scarcely credit his senses, seeing the usually deliberate and self-possessed Rollo about to kill a defenceless German officer.  \"That brute was about to shoot down a fellow who had given him quarter,\" hissed Rollo: \"that captain over there, the one sitting up with a wounded leg.\"  \"We'll collar the cad in any case,\" declared Kenneth, for the Belgian troops were now being recalled.  The attack had been repulsed, but the defenders were too wary to risk being caught out in the open.  Drawing his revolver Rollo ordered the German to rise.  The Major apparently did not understand French, for he only cried the more.  \"Get up instantly,\" exclaimed Rollo in English.  The German looked at his captor in surprise.  His appeals for mercy ceased.  He stood up.  \"I surrender,\" he said in the same language.  With one of the British lads on either side the prisoner was urged onwards at a rapid pace, surrounded by swarms of exultant Belgians, many of whom were limping or nursing their wounded arms.  Others were supporting or carrying those of their comrades who were more seriously hurt, yet all were uplifted by their enthusiasm at the thought of having vanquished von Emmich's hordes.  Upon gaining the shelter of Fort de Barchon the British lads handed their prisoner over to the charge of a corporal and a file of men.  It was well for the German that his captors refrained from giving the Belgian soldiers an account of the circumstances under which he had been made prisoner.  The German major seemed dazed.  He could not understand how he had been captured by Englishmen; for it had been given out to the troops of von Emmich's division that Great Britain had decided to remain neutral. Her attitude had been gained by a promise on the part of the German Government that only the French and Belgian colonies should be annexed, and that no permanent occupation of these two countries was contemplated.  And now he had been informed that Great Britain and her vast empire beyond the seas had fallen into line to aid right against might.  The news troubled him beyond measure--far more than the probability of what the result of his treacherous act would be; for he was a Teuton imbued with the belief that all is fair in war, and that treaties and conventions are alike mere matters of form.  \"Ah! you have been in the fight,\" exclaimed Major Résimont.  \"That should not be.  Dispatch-riders are required for other things.\"  Kenneth and Rollo saluted.  \"Couldn't help it,\" explained Kenneth.  \"When the men charged we simply had to go.  It was splendid.\"  \"You think so?  So do we,\" said the Major proudly.  \"We have taught the Bosches a lesson; we have shown them that Belgians can fight.  We must hold them in front of the Liége forts for a few days, and then the French and the English armies will be here.  A matter of three days, perhaps, and then, _pouf!_ they blow the Kaiser and his armies upon the bayonets of the Russians.  It is good to think that the English are so close.\"     CHAPTER VII  Disabling a Taube  \"Here is the money and the letter you entrusted us with, sir,\" said Kenneth.  \"We couldn't get within five miles of Visé.\"  \"The place is burned to the ground, I hear,\" announced Major Résimont. \"Those Prussians are like devils, they spare neither man, woman, nor child.  Liége is filled with terrible stories brought by the peasants who escaped.  I could, alas! gather no definite tidings of my daughter or of her friend your sister, Monsieur Everest.  One thing is certain. They left before the German shells began to fall in Visé, but whither, I know not.  Let us hope they went to Maastricht.\"  It was now early morning.  The bombardment, which had ceased during the futile assault, was now being renewed, although the fire lacked the fierceness that characterized the beginning of the siege of Liége.  The Belgian reply, too, had almost ceased, for so rapidly had the big guns been served that they had become overheated.  Moreover--a further proof of German methods--the ordnance supplied by Krupp's to the Belgian Government before the war was obviously inferior in workmanship and material, and in consequence had rapidly deteriorated.  The two British dispatch-riders had run across Major Résimont in one of the vaulted galleries.  He looked tired and worried: tired owing to the fact that he had been for seventeen hours on duty in the trenches or in the fort; worried by reason of anxiety for his daughter.  Yet he was willing and anxious to face the Germans at any time they should take it into their heads to attempt another assault.  \"If I were you I would take the chance to get a few hours' sleep,\" he advised as he bade the lads au revoir.  \"Remember what I said the next time there is an attack: a dispatch-rider's duty is not in the firing-line.  His work lies in another sphere, equally hazardous and equally important.\"  \"Jolly good advice about getting some sleep, at all events,\" remarked Kenneth, after the Major had gone.  \"I vote we turn in.  I had no idea I was so horribly sleepy until just now.\"  \"Guns or no guns, I think I can do my share of sleep,\" agreed Rollo. \"Let us put the scheme into practice.\"  Just then the heavy armoured door of the gallery was thrown open, and an authoritative voice shouted:  \"Dispatch-riders!  Are there any dispatch-riders here?\"  \"Here, sir,\" replied the lads promptly.  \"Ah!  The English motor-cyclists,\" exclaimed the Belgian--a staff officer.  \"Do you know the headquarters offices in the Palace of Justice in Liége?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" was again the reply.  \"Good!  Take this paper--you!\" (pointing to Kenneth)--\"and deliver it into the hands of Commandant Fleurus at all costs, and await his commands.  Your comrade will accompany you, so that should you meet with any mishap he is to take the paper from you and proceed.  You understand?  Good!  Now, away!\"  \"A good spin will be almost as refreshing as a few hours' sleep, Rollo,\" said Kenneth, as the two chums made their way to the place where their motor-cycles were stored, protected by three feet of concrete and six feet of earth from hostile shells.  \"With plenty of excitement thrown in,\" added Rollo.  \"We'll have a difficulty to dodge those shells as we get clear of the fort, I'm thinking.\"  \"Rush it and trust to luck.  We'll do it all right,\" declared Kenneth optimistically, as he hurriedly overhauled his cycle and proceeded to warm up the engine.  It was a tricky business getting out of the fort, for the sunken lane that wound through the extensive glacis was littered with debris of exploded shells.  There were deep holes in several places, while at various points the effect of the German projectiles was evident by the fact that the approach to the fort was choked by landslides.  Thrice the lads had to dismount and push their cycles over obstacles, to the accompaniment of the dull crash of the shells, some of which burst unpleasantly near.  All the while, although not a defender was visible, the armoured cupolas were appearing and disappearing with the regularity of clockwork, sending out their iron hail upon the pontoons which the German engineers were constructing to replace the broken bridges at Visé and Argenteau.  \"All out!\" exclaimed Rollo as they reached the open road.  With throttle well open and spark advanced, both motor-cycles bounded forward.  The pace was terrific.  At times the riders were almost jerked from the saddles as their steeds leapt across the irregularities on the surface of the _pavé_.  The lads could no longer hear the thunder of the guns: it was drowned by the roar of their exhausts.  The wind shrieked past their ears, grit flew in showers, a cloud of dust followed in their wake.  Suddenly they saw a large silvery-grey object swoop down about a quarter of a mile ahead, close to the outskirts of the village of Jupille, which had been abandoned by the terrified inhabitants.  The riders recognized it as one of the German Taubes that had been aggressively active during the operations by locating the position of the Belgian trenches.  The monoplane was in difficulties.  It took all the skill of the pilot to prevent it from making a nose-end dive to earth.  With superb presence of mind he managed to restore the disturbed equilibrium and to bring the Taube to rest without much damage.  Bringing his motor-cycle to a halt, Kenneth dismounted and placed his mount on its stand.  Rollo did likewise.  \"What's the game?\" he asked as his companion unfastened the flap of his holster.  \"We'll collar those fellows,\" declared Kenneth resolutely \"They must not get away.\"  \"But the dispatch?\"  \"This is more important, I guess.  See, those fellows are already setting things to rights.  Before any of the Belgian vedettes can come up they will be off again.\"  Kenneth was"]]]
