And now Corianton noticed for the first time that the form was supple and finely proportioned. Her head, too, had been covered with a kind of mantilla which had also partly shrouded her face; this fell back now, revealing a face of uncommon loveliness, and a profusion of brown hair.  \"You must know then, sir prophet,\" she said with a light air, \"that I am Joan, from Siron; my father is a Nephite by birth, but when young met with my mother, taken captive during a war with your people. He fell in love with the captive, married her and she induced him to go with her to her people. They settled in Siron where they lived happily until my mother died. My father still lives, and has never been entirely rid of the traditions of the Nephites, and hearing that a party of Nephite prophets were preaching in Antionum, it was his wish that I should come to our kinsman Seantum, find you, and ask that you would also preach in Siron.\"  \"But why did you come to me? I do not lead our party, I am youngest in it.\"  \"Ah, sir prophet, you are more famous than you know. It was Corianton that we first heard of in Siron; it is he whose eloquence most baffles the Zoramites, and threatens the disruption of their church--believe me, sir, I was charged by my father to bid you come.\"  Oh, flattery! what man is proof against thy sweet, seducing charms! And how those charms are heightened, when flattery falls from beauty's lips! The vanity of Corianton was well pleased with the words of the woman; pride swelled his bosom, and he felt exalted above his brethren.  \"For two days I have sought you\" (Corianton had been absent two days from his lodgings), \"now I have found you and delivered my message, will you go to Siron?\"  \"I cannot say, lady, I must first confer with my brethren, and if by them it is thought best, I--\"  \"What! are you not free to come and go where and when you like. Are you in bondage?\"  \"No, lady, not in bondage, yet it is mete I counsel with my associates, and if--\"  \"And 'if' they give you leave, why then you'll go! Ah me, that is such liberty as a maiden has under her father's control. I've often wished myself a man, that I might have a more extended liberty, but if men cannot act independent of control, it pleases me that I am a woman.  I fear, Sir prophet, that I shall never be a convert to your faith.\"  \"Then I would esteem my success in Siron of little value though I gained the whole people, if I failed to number one so fair among those who followed me.\"  \"Come, sir, let us now go in; you begin to find your tongue, and even a prophet, I see, can flatter.\"  So saying she drew her mantle over her head, and they walked in silence towards the house.  Corianton, as he walked away, did not observe shadowy forms glide from under adjacent trees, hold a brief consultation and depart from the spot which he himself had just quitted.     CHAPTER EIGHT.  THE REVEL.   As Corianton and Joan approached the house, lively strains of music floated out upon the evening air, and lights gleamed from all the windows; now sounds of revelry could be heard--the merry laugh, and flying feet. In the hall they were met by Seantum. \"Returned home at last, Corianton, eh?\" he said with blustering familiarity, \"what, and with Joan, too!\"  \"Yes, kinsman; I found our prophet as he was entering the grounds, and have detained him long enough to deliver my message.\"  \"Quite right, too, quite right; if you have anything to do, do it, and do it at once, say I. But come, sir, some young people have gathered here, to make merry the night, recreation will do you good, sir; youth was made for enjoyment, sir, and youth cheats itself if it make not good use of its time.\"  \"Oh, kinsman, you forget!\" said Joan. \"This man, though he hath not a gray beard, or a stooped back--and though he hath no staff, yet is he a holy man! and will account the youthful revels you commend, as sinful. Alas,\" said she, with charming mock solemnity,--\"alas, that youth should so soon wed itself to the vocation of the aged! Besides, I warrant me, he will tell thee he must first counsel with his fellow-prophets, before he can stir in what you would have him enjoy. So pray forbear, tempt not the holy prophet!\" And with this tantalizing witchery she left him.  Seantum laughed heartily at the evident discomfiture of Corianton. \"By my life, sir, she hath hit you as hard with her sarcasm of your solemnities, as your ridicule hits the weakness of our Zoramite faith; but come, sir, come, you must rally, you must let her see that you have spirit--which I know you have--go in, sir,\" lowering his voice, \"it shall not harm your reputation; go in, you shall find beauty, gaiety, pleasure and secrecy beneath my roof--go in, sir; youth was made for pleasure!\"  His pride, wounded by the light sarcasm of Joan, and, influenced, it must also be confessed, by the cajolery of Seantum, Corianton permitted himself to be led down the hall into a spacious saloon, brilliantly lighted by cressets, and at one end of which, on a platform, was arranged a banqueting table, ladened profusely with all the delicacies of the tropics--a rich variety of meats, fruits and wines, of which all were free to partake at pleasure. The ceiling and wall of the saloon were frescoed with voluptuous figures or grim monsters, half animal, half human--with here and there indications that some knowledge of the old mythologies was still retained; the windows were draped with curtains of rich stuffs, variously colored; their ample folds gently stirred by the soft breeze which stole into the room, filling it with the rich perfumes of the garden. The floor was variegated Mosaic work, smooth as polished ivory, covered at the sides and ends by soft carpeting.  As Corianton and Seantum entered the saloon, a pretty dark-eyed girl was executing a sort of fandango to the evident delight of a number of young men sitting or lounging promiscuously about the room. At the conclusion of the dance the girl was greeted warmly with a round of applause. Then there was quiet, broken occasionally by light ripples of laughter, the hum of confused conversation, or occasional commands to the slaves to serve fruits or wines. There were whispered nothings, tender caresses, and loose jests. Groups of women of all degrees of beauty were reclining on divans or cushions, half concealed by the rich foliage of gigantic plants in great vases; and sometimes in recesses nearly shut out from the main body of the saloon by closely drawn curtains.  The entrance of Seantum and Corianton had attracted no attention; but as the tall, graceful Nephite passed the various groups, the girls broke out in exclamations of admiration--\"how handsome!\" \"how young!\" \"what fine eyes!--and what a form!\" \"who is he?\" \"a stranger--a Nephite.\" All this agitated Corianton, and rendered him uneasy. Arriving at the head of the saloon, he was introduced to a group of young men about his own age.  \"This is my Nephite prophet of whom you have heard me speak,\" said Seantum, \"receive him as my honored guest and friend.\" At this Corianton was warmly saluted, and called upon to pledge the acquaintance in wine. There was no retreating now, nor could there be any refusal.  \"Though our new friend is a Nephite,\" said Seantum, after the pledge of friendship had been drunk, \"and reared under traditions which we have forsaken, religious differences, arising solely from training in childhood, should make no difference in social life.\" \"No, no,\" broke in several voices. \"Let us bury thoughts of all such differences in another bowl of wine,\" said a youth of Lamanitish appearance, and already under the influence of the beverage he now called for.  At that moment in the lower part of the saloon some one was greeted by hearty applause; looking in that direction Joan was seen advancing clad in loose, fleecy garments; she held in her hand a long strip of crimson gauze, and as she reached the middle of the saloon she shook out its folds and began a dance of exquisite grace.  What mischief hath not been worked by the witching grace exhibited by beautiful women in the dance! The elegance and harmony of motion, the poetry of movement, gives a lustre to beauty and influences the senses through the imagination. 'Twas the dancing of the fair daughter of Jared which drove Akish of old to pledge himself to murder King Omer among the Jaredites; and men hereafter shall promise with an oath anything to the half of a kingdom, to some fair one for dancing before them.  Never had Corianton seen such a combination of motion and beauty as that now before him. The slight willowy form of Joan swaying with easy grace, the poise of the head, the movement of the arms, all in perfect harmony with the rest of her actions. Frequently the company applauded her, but now evidently the dance is drawing to a close, concluding with rapid whirling round the entire saloon. As she passed near Corianton she suddenly threw her gauze scarf over his head, as a challenge for him to join her in the finale; and he, forgetful of all but her loveliness and bewitching grace, caught her hand, holding the tips of her fingers, and accompanied her in that whirling circuit. He had evidently acquitted himself well, for he shared in the applause which greeted her, and the compliments that followed.  \"Ah, my friend, I scarcely thought a prophet could do so well,\" she whispered, in her taunting manner; but seeing that he turned pale at her remark, and that a pained expression also passed over his features, she quickly added \"you did well, I am proud of you, and you must be my companion for the night;\" and her hand once more stole within his arm.  The revels were continued through the night, wine flowed as freely as water, and long before the gray dawn began to break in the east, many had sunk down in a helpless, drunken sleep. Corianton also was intoxicated, but not so much with wine as with the beauty"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35974"],["title","Corianton: A Nephite Story (#7)"],["body","chic of Joan. When she left him, as she did soon after midnight, he began to realize the situation into which his half thoughtless indiscretion had plunged him, and he knew not how he would well answer his brethren for his conduct. Though he had drunk but little wine, not being accustomed to it his brain was on fire, and a mad spirit of recklessness seized him. Passing a group of young fellows in an advanced stage of intoxication in one of the recesses of the saloon, he was hailed by them, and congratulated upon his conquest of the fairest lady in all their land. He joined them in their praises of her beauty and in their revel. What he did, what was done he knew not, his brain was confused--he had an indistinct recollection of boisterous, frenzied jollity, then high words, a quarrel, but not the reason of it, and then all was darkness, oblivion.     CHAPTER NINE.  ISABEL.   As the grey light of morning struggled through the heavy curtained windows of the saloon, Corianton awoke. For some time he lay half bewildered, unable to call to mind what had happened, or where he was, conscious only of the heavy, dull pain in his head. At last, however, the revels of the past night were conjured up by his recollection; but awakening consciousness brought with it a sickening sense of shame. He was lying on a cushioned divan in one of the many recesses opening into the saloon, and near him in a heavy stupor, on the floor, was a young Lamanite girl. He arose and staggered from the recess to seek the open air. In the saloon the lights in the cressets were burning low, but giving out sufficient of their pale, yellow light to reveal the general disorder that prevailed. Fruits, drinking bowls, withered flowers and ottomans lay scattered about promiscuously. The banquet table itself with its burden of fruits and wines and silver furniture, had been overturned, doubtless in the melee which followed the quarrel, of which Corianton had but an indistinct recollection. Near the door leading into the hall were two slaves sleeping in each other's arms--worn out by the services of the past night.  Corianton wended his way through all this debris and at last reached the garden; but neither the cool morning air, the song of birds nor the perfume of flowers brought relief to his aching heart or troubled mind.  He followed the same path down which Joan had led him the night before to the margin of the lake, and stood under the same trees where her loveliness first attracted his attention. Again he saw her half reclining against the tree, once more heard her sweet voice deriding his faith and mocking at the bondage it brought with it--\"What, are you not free? Are you in bondage?\" she had said; and the humiliation he had experienced by the taunting question still hurt his pride. He sought a bower near at hand, and stretching himself upon a seat beneath it, was soon lost in a fitful slumber.  He was suddenly awakened by some one in a subdued but hurried tone calling his name. Shaking off his sleep at last, he was surprised and not a little troubled at seeing his brother Shiblon standing over him.  \"Wake, brother, wake and leave this horrible place!\" The speaker was pale and evidently much excited. \"Come brother, in the name of God shake off this slumber, and come with me before it is too late!\"  \"Why Shiblon, what's amiss?\"  \"Alas, I fear thou art amiss; and your bad deeds are like to bring trouble to us all. Your association with harlots in this place is the talk of the whole city, and everywhere we are threatened with violence--we can no longer preach to the people since they judge us all by your conduct, and condemn us all as hypocrites and bid us be gone. The other brethren have started to leave the city, but I came in search of you; now brother, come--in God's name come! Come, let us leave together; by a penitent life you may yet cancel this great sin--you are young--not yet hardened in vice; I pray you, come!\"  Corianton stood before his brother bewildered; to him his speech was incoherent--wild. \"Shiblon,\" said he, \"I have not associated with harlots, and though the revels of last night were indiscreet, I am free from such sin as you impute to me.\"  \"God grant that you are, and far be it from me to believe that you add the sin of falsehood to a grosser sin; but brother, the house of Seantum where you have lodged, is the worst den of infamy in all Antionum, and only last night you were seen in loving converse on the shores of this very lake with the harlot Isabel.\"  \"Isabel!\" echoed Corianton, \"I know and have seen no such woman. I walked through the grounds here last evening with Joan, niece of Seantum, and though of sprightly disposition yet modest, and I believe as virtuous as she is fair.\"  \"Oh, Corianton, in this you are cozened. That woman is not Joan, nor is she Seantum's niece; but a wicked harlot from Siron whose body to the chief men of this city has been as common as their wills have desired it; you have fallen into the trap laid by the Zoramites to destroy the mission in this city. Seantum is one of the leaders of the Zoramites, he it was who sent for this cunning harlot to work your ruin, and in that hoped for the destruction of our mission; and he has succeeded, alas! too well. They have deceived you; and as the devil appears as an angel of light, so this woman assumes a virtue that she possesses not, and by that seeming grace wins you to your destruction. But break this chain, and let us flee.\"  Before Corianton could reply there was heard a hurrying of feet and they were surrounded by a body of men.  \"Take that man,\" said Seantum, pointing to Shiblon, \"and bind him.\" The young man saw at a glance that neither flight nor resistance would avail anything, and he submitted without an effort at either.  \"Corianton,\" said Seantum, \"I overheard the ungracious words of your brother against my house and my kinswoman, and I insist upon a vindication of both before the magistrates of this city; hence I have taken him, but I mean him no further mischief; and does not justice to my great reputation and to my household dictate the taking of this course?\"  \"Though the sentence fall upon my brother, I must say your cause is just; let him answer it before your judges, and let this experience teach him discretion.\"  \"Corianton,\" said Shiblon, \"I complain not at my captivity, incurred by an anxiety for your good; nor shall I shrink before the judges however unjust or merciless they may be. But take my advice, if you are still free from the sin that reputation sticks on you, lose no time in leaving this man's accursed house; trust not his friendship, for it is poison; believe not in the pretensions of the harlot Isabel, Joan she is not, she is one whose feet go down to death, whose steps take hold on hell!\"  \"Away with him, and stop his slanderous mouth!\" cried Corianton, white with rage. One of those who held him, struck Shiblon a blow in the face.  \"Noble Seantum,\" continued Corianton, \"see that yourself and your fair niece be cleared of those slanders, and tell her that there is one Nephite at least who can rise above the prejudices of a narrow faith and not impute lewdness to mirthfulness, nor wantonness to innocent gaiety.\"  \"Be assured, sir,\" replied the one addressed, \"I shall not fail to report you truly to the fair Joan; and you shall not suffer in her estimation by reason of your brother's slander.\"  \"Brother, you are now blinded by your infatuation and anger,\" said Shiblon, whose spirit neither blows nor prospective harsher treatment could daunt, \"but the time will come, when the scales will fall, and you will see the black wickedness of those who have entrapped your unwary feet; farewell, and whatever fate overtakes me, remember I suffer it out of love of you.\"  He was then dragged away in the direction of the house, followed by Seantum.     CHAPTER TEN.  TAUNTS OF THE CROWD.   Left alone to battle with the contending emotions that struggled in his breast, and his anger having subsided, Corianton began to be plagued with rising apprehensions. What if Shiblon were right? What if he had been duped by the crafty Zoramites? Many things that passed under his observation in the banqueting saloon the night before now arose to give support to his increasing fears. \"Yet, I'll not believe it, until proven true, then if she be indeed a harlot, and hath betrayed me into this compromising position, may God pity her, for she hath need of pity!\"  With these words he left the garden and started in the direction of the market place of the city.  He observed as he walked along that many people looked curiously at him, and turned to follow him with their gaze. As he turned into one of the principal streets he heard a tumult, and saw an excited crowd of people rapidly gathering about two men who were evidently making efforts to extricate themselves from the throng. They were coming in his direction, and stepping aside into a narrow alleyway, he thought to let the throng pass without being observed. As the crowd drew near, to his astonishment, he saw the two men were his father and Ammon. The mob at their heels, however, was evidently, as yet, good natured, and were merely mocking them. Some who occasionally ran in front of them would shout at the spectators gathered at the sides of the streets--  \"Behold the Nephite prophet, who comes to teach us 'holiness' while his son makes merry the night with harlots!\"  \"Teach your own son virtue before you leave your cities to convert the Zoramites,\" cried another.  \"The son's no worse than the father I'll warrant,\" shouted a third.  \"Nor so bad either,\" broke in several.  \"Say old greybeard,\" said a voice from the crowd, \"which of you holy men is contracted to Isabel to-night?\" and the insinuation was followed by shouts of laughter.  So the crowd passed on, yelling, cursing, mocking, deriding, pushing; the spirit of violence constantly increasing. The two prophets answered nothing, but bore all meekly;"]]]
