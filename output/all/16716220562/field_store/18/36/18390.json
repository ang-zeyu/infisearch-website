[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3689"],["title","Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 1 (#6)"],["body","am writing to you from Albano, whence I can only discern the dome, and, secondly, this poor St. Peter's has been so disguised, so embellished by papier-mache wreaths, horrid curtains at alcoves, etc., etc., all in honor of the five or six last saints whom His Holiness has canonised, that I try to put away the recollection of it. Happily there have not been any workers of miracles to glorify at the Coliseum and the Campo Vaccino, otherwise it would have been impossible to live in Rome.  If nothing occurs to prevent it, I expect to pass the end of next winter (March and April) in Paris. Will you permit me then to fill up all the gaps in my correspondence from the Rue d'Anjou? [Here the Princess lived.] I count always upon your friendly and indulgent kindness. But shall you extend this so far as to give me a sign of life before the close of my stay in Italy? I do not know. In any case, letters addressed poste restante, Florence, will reach me till the 1st of next September.  I beg you, Madame la Princesse, to accept the expression of my profound and most devoted respect.  F. Liszt  Albano, June 4th, 1839  Will you be good enough to remember me affectionately to (Madame) your sister and to Mr. d'Aragon?    19. To Robert Schumann  [From a copy from the Royal Library in Berlin.]  Albano, June 5th, 1839  My dear Monsieur Schumann,  At the risk of appearing very monotonous, I must again tell you that the last pieces you were so kind as to send me to Rome appear to me admirable both in inspiration and composition. The \"Fantaisie\" dedicated to me is a work of the highest kind--and I am really proud of the honor you have done me in dedicating to me so grand a composition.  Op. 17, C dur. With the motto:--  \"Durch alle Tone tonet Im bunten Erdentraum Ein leiser Ton gezogen Fur den, der heimlich lauschet.\"  (\"Through all the sounds of nature, In earth's fair dream of joy, An under-current soundeth For him whose ears can hear.\"]  I mean, therefore, to work at it and penetrate it through and through, so as to make the utmost possible effect with it.  As to the \"Kinderscenen,\" I owe to them one of the greatest pleasures of my life. You know, or you don't know, that I have a little girl of three years old, whom everybody agrees in considering angelic (did you ever hear such a commonplace?). Her name is Blandine-Rachel, and her surname Moucheron. [Pet name; literally, \"little fly.\"] It goes without saying that she has a complexion of roses and milk, and that her fair golden hair reaches to her feet just like a savage. She is, however, the most silent child, the most sweetly grave, the most philosophically gay in the world. I have every reason to hope also that she will not be a musician, from which may Heaven preserve her!  Well, my dear Monsieur Schumann, two or three times a week (on fine and good days!) I play your \"Kinderscenen\" to her in the evening; this enchants her, and me still more, as you may imagine, so that often I go over the first repeat twenty times without going any further. Really I think you would be satisfied with this success if you could be a witness of it!  I think I have already expressed to you, in one of my former letters, the desire I felt to see you write some ensemble pieces, Trios, Quintets, or Septets. Will you pardon me for pressing this point again? It seems to me that you would be more capable of doing it than any one else nowadays. And I am convinced that success, even commercial success, would not be wanting.  If between now and next winter you could complete some ensemble work, it would be a real pleasure to me to make it known in Paris, where that sort of composition, when well played, has more chance of success than you perhaps think. I would even gladly undertake to find a publisher for it, if you liked, which would moreover in no wise prevent you from disposing of it for Germany.  In the interim I mean to play in public your \"Carnaval,\" and some of the \"Davidsbundlertanze\" and of the \"Kinderscenen.\" The \"Kreisleriana,\" and the \"Fantaisie\" which is dedicated to me, are more difficult of digestion for the public. I shall reserve them till later.  Up to the present time I only know the following works of yours:--  Impromptus on a theme by Clara Wieck. Pianoforte Sonata, dedicated to Clara. Concerto without orchestra. \"Etudes Symphoniques\" \"Davidsbundlertanze\" \"Kreisleriana.\" \"Carnaval.\" \"Kinderscenen\" and my \"Fantaisie.\"  If you would have the kindness to complete your works to me it would be a great pleasure to me; I should like to have them bound all together in three or four volumes. Haslinger, on his side, will send you my Etudes and my other publications as they come out.  What you tell me of your private life has interested and touched me deeply. If I could, I know not how, be in the least pleasant or useful to you in these circumstances, dispose of me as you will. Whatever happens, count on my absolute discretion and sincere devotion. If I am not asking too much, tell me if it is Clara of whom you speak. But if this question should seem to you misplaced, do not answer it.  Have you met at Leipzig Mr. Frank, [Dr. Hermann Frank edited Brockhaus' Allgemeine Zeitung for a year.] at the present moment editor of the Leipzig Allgemeine Zeitung? From the little I know of him (for he has been much more intimate with Chopin and Hiller than with me) I think he is capable of understanding you. He has left a charming impression behind him in Rome. If you see him, give him my affectionate regards.  My plans remain the same. I still intend to be in Vienna at the beginning of December, and in Paris at the end of February. I shall be capable of coming to look you up in Leipzig if you will let me make the journey from Paris with you. Try! Adieu, my dear Monsieur Schumann; write soon (address care of Ricordi, Florence: I shall be in the neighborhood of Lucca till the middle of September), and depend always on my sincere esteem and lively affection.  Yours in all friendship,  F. Liszt    20. To Breitkopf and Hartel  [Milan, June, 1839]  Gentleman,  About three weeks ago I gave to Mr. Ricordi (who was on his way to Rome) the proofs of the two Symphonies you addressed to me. I hope they have reached you by now. Forgive me for having kept them so long, and also for having corrected them with so much care. But, firstly, they did not reach me till about the 20th of February, and then I did not know how to send them to you direct, for the diligences in this happy country are so insecure. I am therefore of necessity (though very unwillingly) behindhand.  Allow me to ask you for a second proof (for it is of great consequence to me that the edition should be as correct as possible), and this time I will beg you to send me three proofs of each Symphony, so that I may forward one to Paris and the other to London. Probably there will not be any more corrections to make in this second proof, and in that case I will let you know in two words (without returning your proof), telling you at the same time the date of publication.  My intention being to visit Vienna, Munich, and perhaps Leipzig at the beginning of next year (before going to England in the month of April), I shall take advantage of this opportunity to let the Symphonies be heard at my concerts, so as to give them a certain publicity.  I have looked through the Lieder you have been good enough to send me. I shall certainly do the \"Adelaide,\" however difficult it may seem to me to transcribe simply and elegantly. As regards the others, I am afraid I cannot find the necessary time. Moreover, that good Haslinger overwhelms me with Schubert. I have just sent him twenty-four more new songs (\"Schwanengesang\" and \"Winterreise\"), and for the moment I am rather tired with this work.  Would you be so kind as to send me, at the same time with the proofs of the Beethoven Symphonies, Mr. Mendelssohn's \"Preludes and Fugues\"? It is an extremely remarkable work, and it has been impossible to get it in Italy. I shall be greatly obliged if you will send it me.  When you see Mr. Schumann please remember me very kindly to him. I have received the \"Fantaisie\" which he has done me the honor to dedicate to me, and the \"Kinderscenen.\" Don't you think you ought to publish a book of Studies by him? I should be extremely curious to make acquaintance with them. All his works interest me in a high degree. It would be difficult for me to say as much of many of the compositions of my respected colleagues, with some exceptions.  I beg to remain, Gentlemen,  Yours most sincerely,  F. Liszt  Address the Symphonies to Mr. Ricordi, Florence. From the 15th of June till the 1st of September I shall be in the neighborhood of Lucca. Ricordi's address is the safest.    21. To the Beethoven Committee at Bonn  [Printed in L. Ramann's Biography of Liszt, vol. 1]  Gentlemen,  As the subscription for Beethoven's monument is only getting on slowly, and as the carrying out of this undertaking seems to be rather far distant, I venture to make a proposal to you, the acceptance of which would make me very happy. [In Bonn, Beethoven's birthplace, a committee had been formed to erect a Beethoven monument. Yet, in spite of the assent which met the proposal, the contributions flowed in so meagrely--Paris, for example, contributed only 424 francs 90 centimes--that Liszt, on reading this in a paper, immediately formed the noble resolution mentioned in the above letter. \"Such a niggardly almsgiving, got together with such trouble and sending round the hat, must not be allowed to help towards building our Beethoven's monument!\" he wrote to Berlioz. Thus the German nation has in great measure to thank Franz Liszt for the monument erected to its greatest composer at Bonn.]  I offer myself to make up, from my own means, the sum still wanting for the erection of the monument, and ask no other privilege than that of naming the artist who shall execute the work. That artist is Bartolini of Florence, who is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3689"],["title","Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 1 (#7)"],["body"," considered the first sculptor in Italy.  I have spoken to him about the matter provisionally, and he assures me that a monument in marble (which would cost about fifty to sixty thousand francs) could be finished in two years, and he is ready to begin the work at once. I have the honor to be, etc.,  Franz Liszt  Pisa, October 3rd, 1839    22. To Count Leo Festetics in Pest  [Printed in F. von Schober's \"Letters about Liszt's Sojourn in Hungary.\"]  Dear Count,  Shall you like to have me again at Pest this year? I know not. In any case you are threatened with my presence from the 18th to the 22nd of next December. I shall come to you a little older, a little more matured, and, permit me to say, more finished an artist, than I was when you saw me last year, for since that time I have worked enormously in Italy. I hope you have kept me in remembrance, and that I may always count on your friendship, which is dear to me.  What joy, what an immense happiness it will be to be once more in my own country, to feel myself surrounded by such noble and vigorous sympathies, which, thank God, I have done nothing to forfeit in my distant and wandering life. What feelings, what emotions will then fill my breast! All this, dear Count, I will not attempt to express to you, for in truth I should not know how. Let it suffice you to know that the love of my country, of my chivalrous and grand country, has ever lived most deeply in my heart; and that, if unhappily it does not seem likely that I can ever show to my country what a love and devotion I feel for it, the sentiments will remain none the less unchanged in my heart.  But I will not tire you any longer with myself and my sentiments.  I forgot to tell you that for nearly a week I have been confined to my bed with a very severe fever, which might easily have become more serious still. My second concert was obliged to be put off on account of it. Today my doctor has given me permission to play on Wednesday. I don't really know whether I shall be able to do it, for my hand trembles fearfully. Excuse this horrible writing, but I did want to send you a few words. It is a sort of anticipation of Pest, which is sweet to me.  A revoir then very soon, dear Count; meanwhile believe me, as ever, yours most sincerely,  F. Liszt  November 24th, 1839, in bed    23. To Clara Wieck  [The great pianist, afterwards Schumann's wife.]  Pest, December 25th, 1839  How grateful I am, Mademoiselle, for the kind remembrance you keep of me! And how much I am already rejoicing at the thought of seeing you and hearing you again soon in Leipzig! I was so vexed not to be in Paris last winter when I knew you were going to spend some time there. Perhaps I should have been able to be of some little use to you there. You know that, at all times and in every country, I shall always be at your service. I should become too lengthy if I allowed myself to reply in detail to your kind questions about my new compositions. I worked immensely hard in Italy. Without exaggeration I think I have written four to five hundred pages of pianoforte music. If you have patience to hear half a quarter of them I shall be delighted to play them to you, so so.  The \"Studies after Paganini,\" which are dedicated to you, will only appear in two months' time; but I will bring you the proofs, which have long been corrected, to Leipzig.  Once more many thanks, and many tender and respectful wishes for everything that can contribute to your happiness. And above all a bientot.  Yours in admiration and sympathy,  F. Liszt    24. To Robert Schumann in Leipzig  [Autograph in the Royal Library in Berlin.]  Dresden, March 27th, 1840  My dear Schumann,  It is all splendid. Only I should prefer to play the \"Hexameron\" last, so as to finish with orchestra. Please, therefore, have the \"Etudes\" and the \"Carnaval\" put after the Mendelssohn Concerto! [Refers to Liszt's third concert in Leipzig, on March 30th, 1840, for the benefit of the Orchestral Pension Fund.]  Best remembrances to Mendelssohn and Hiller; and believe me yours ever,  F. Liszt  I shall certainly return Monday morning, for on Sunday I am giving a concert for the poor here. But if it should de possible for me to come on Sunday...but I doubt it. [Together with this letter a friend, Carl K[ragen?], writes to Schumann: \"He [Liszt] has played me the glorious Mendelssohn Concerto. It was divine! Tomorrow Tieck is to read Faust for Liszt at my mother's house, and Liszt is to play at our house with Lipinski!, Do come for it! Ah, if you could only induce Mendelssohn and his wife to come too!\"]    25. To Franz von Schober in Vienna  [The autographs of all the letters in this collection to Schober are in the possession of Fran Babette Wolf at Dresden.-Addressed to the poet and writer, an intimate and worthy friend of Franz Schubert. He became Councillor of Legation to Weimar, and died at Dresden in 1882.]  Metz, April 3rd, 1840  I did not get any news from you at Leipzig, dear Schober, as I expected. I am afraid I was very indiscreet in asking you to be so good as to undertake this work, which I should have valued so much, coming from you. [In answer to the distorted reports in various newspapers of Liszt's visit to Hungary (January, 1840), Schober, who had been an eyewitness, thought it right to clear up the misrepresentations, which he did in the form of \"Letters about Liszt's Sojourn in Hungary\"; these he published, but much later (Berlin, Schlesinger, 1843)] But I will not speak of it any more. If by any chance you have already done it I should be grateful to you to send it me--otherwise we will not speak of it any more.  Do you know that I have been pursued by one constant regret during my journey, the regret not to have induced you to accompany me? Your society has always been beneficial and strengthening to me: I do not know why, but I imagine that we should live smoothly together. Your qualities, your faults (if you have any), your character and temper, all please me and attach me to you. You know that I flatter myself I can understand and appreciate you...Should you see any great difficulty in joining me somewhere next autumn-at Venice, for example--and in making a European tour with me? Answer me frankly on this matter. And once more, the question of money need not be considered. As long as we are together (and I should like you to have at least three free years before you) my purse will be yours, on the sole condition that you consent to undertake the management of our expenses,--and that you are thoroughly convinced beforehand of the gratitude I shall feel towards you.  Excuse me, my dear good friend, for entering so plainly into matters, but we have talked together too openly, it seems to me, for it to be possible that your delicate feeling on certain points should be wounded by this.  I have sent back Kiss, of Dresden. He is a good fellow, but a little awkward, and wanting in a certain point of honor, without which a man is not a man as I understand the word. So I am alone now, and am not going to have any one tacked on to me. A former pupil of mine, Monsieur Hermann, has undertaken to arrange my concerts, which is a great relief to me. A propos of concerts, I gave six (in nine days!) at Prague, three at Dresden, and the same number at Leipzig (in twelve days)--so I am perfectly tired out, and feel great need of rest. That was good, wasn't it? Adieu, my dear good friend-let me hear from you soon (address 19, Rue Pigalle, Paris), and depend entirely upon me--nunc et semper.  Yours ever sincerely,  F. Liszt  Will you be so good as to go to Diabelli's [Music publisher in Vienna] when you pass by, and advise him again not to publish the third part of the Hungarian Melodies (which I sent him by Hartel) without first sending me a proof to Paris to correct. Adieu.  Best remembrances to Kriehuber [A well-known Vienna painter and lithographer, from whom a number of Liszt portraits have come.] and Lowy. Why does not the latter write to me?    26. To Maurice Schlesinger, Editor of the Gazette Musicale in Paris  [Given by L. Ramann, \"Franz Liszt,\" vol. ii., i.]  Sir,  Allow me to protest against an inexact assertion in your last number but one:--  \"Messieurs Liszt and Cramer have asked for the Legion of Honor,\" etc.  I do not know if M. Cramer (who has just been nominated) has obtained the cross.  In any case I think that you, like every one else, will approve of a nomination so perfectly legitimate.  As to myself, if it be true that my name has figured in the list of candidates, this can only have occurred entirely without my knowledge. It has always seemed to me that distinctions of this sort could only be accepted, but never \"asked for.\"  I am, sir, etc.,  F. Liszt  London, May 14th, 1840    27. To Franz von Schober  [London, May or June, 1840]  My worthy friend,  A fortnight ago my mother wrote me word that she had given several letters, which had come for me from Germany, to a gentleman who was to bring them to me to London. I suppose there was one from you among the number, but up to now I have not received anything.  Allow me to repeat once more the request, which I have already made to you, to come for some time with me (a year or two, and more if you can); for I feel deeply that, the more we are separated by time and space, the more my thoughts and my heart go out to you. I have rarely felt this so strongly, and my wish to feel you settled with me grows daily stronger.  Moreover the persuasion that I feel that we should pass a happy and serious life together, makes me again press you further.  Try then to be at liberty as soon as possible, and once for all make a frank and friendly resolve. I assure you that it will not be difficult to ameliorate, by each other, our two lives, which in their different ways are sad and bad thus separated.  Let me have two words in reply on this point--which, to tell the truth, is the only important one for us both at this moment. Speak quite freely to "]]]
