I suspect that male Sharp-tailed Sparrows do not even know where nests are. On July 18 at 7:00 a.m. I was watching a nest from a nearby blind when an unbanded male (I saw the individual sing later) appeared. As the bird foraged through the black grass, it headed directly toward the nest. When the male was almost one foot from the nest the incubating female left. She ran from the tussock and flew a short distance away to a cattail stem. From here she watched the male, which seemingly oblivious continued foraging, coming within inches of the nest. As the male walked away from the nest the female returned. At 8:00 p.m. the same day I was in the blind again. The female was out searching for food when a different, banded male appeared. In his foraging, the male walked up on the grass stems over the nest. The male apparently saw the young (two had hatched on July 17 and one on July 18) for he turned his head and seemed to peer down under the stems. The female appeared (with food) as he was doing this; she flew directly toward him and he flew away. The male was not seen near the nest in later observations.  On July 1 (6:50 a.m.) I was in a blind near another nest as the female approached with food for the young. At this moment a male appeared and the female immediately flew away. The male perched on a tussock within two feet of the nest, sang, and then flew off. The female reappeared in a few seconds without the food. She searched through a clump of black grass four feet from the nest, caught a small, pale green insect, fed it to her one young (there were also two eggs in the nest) and began brooding.   VOICE   _Song_  Only males of the two species sing. The normal song of the Seaside Sparrow lasts just under two seconds, the buzzing final note constituting three-quarters of the song. Saunders (1951:257-258) describes this song as short, and buzzlike, beginning with two or three short, rather faint notes and ending in a trill at first loud but fading away toward the end. The introductory notes are followed by a higher-pitched, loud, strongly accented, but buzzy note. This note is usually higher than the final trill and connected with it. The song has been written as _tup tup ZEE reeeeeeeeee_ and _tup TEE tle reeeeeeeeeee_ (Saunders, 1951:257), _cutcut_, _zhé-eeeeeeeee_ (Peterson, 1947:232) and _che-zheéeege_, _che-zhée_, _che-wéege_, _chur-zhée_ and _too-szheée_ (Stone, 1937:910). My field notes contain the following: _CHUR-er eeeee_, _CHUR eeeeee_ and _oka-CHE weeeee_. These variations in the phonetic representation of the songs are attributable mostly to the birds. Not only is there variation among individuals, but also individuals vary their songs. Birds that I heard giving a characteristic song suddenly sang a different type for awhile, and then reverted to the original. The bill is elevated and opens considerably with each note; the head bobs with the loud note. Typical singing postures are shown by Tomkins (1941: pl. 3).  The song of the Sharp-tailed Sparrow, as described by Saunders (1951:256-257), is short and insectlike, introduced by one or two short notes; the remainder is a somewhat wheezy trill, growing fainter towards the end. Sometimes there are two trills on different pitches, and occasionally a final short, low note. The quality is as though the sound _sh_ ran through all but the introductory notes. Saunders writes these trills as: _tsup tsup shreeeeeeeee_ and _tip tish eeeeee shaaaaaaay_. The bill is opened slightly with each note, as I saw when I watched a singing bird with the sun directly behind it. Montagna (1942a:116) noted that _A. c. caudacuta_ sang less often than the more northern _A. c. subvirgata_.  Both species have specialized flight songs, but in the birds that I studied these songs were infrequent and seemingly unimportant. The flight song of the Seaside Sparrows consisted of a double version of the normal song. Although I heard it only a few times, the flight song of the Sharp-tailed Sparrow seemed slightly louder than the normal song. This song is given by both species as the bird flutters upward ten or 20 feet and glides back down.  Singing begins at daylight and decreases at 9 or 10:00 a.m. when the temperature rises. On cloudy days singing seemed to last longer. Towards dusk singing again increases, but not to the frequency of the morning peak.  The major differences between the songs of the two species are in loudness, length, and frequency. The fact that the Seaside Sparrow sings louder than the Sharp-tailed Sparrow is mentioned by Stone (1937:906). On windless days I heard singing Seaside Sparrows more than 200 yards away; Sharp-tailed Sparrows were inaudible at distances of more than 40 yards. The song of a Seaside Sparrow is rarely longer than two seconds; the song of a Sharp-tailed Sparrow usually lasts for almost 20 seconds and consists of a variable number of phrases like those described by Saunders. A Seaside Sparrow that I watched for one hour sang 395 times or 6.6 times per minute. I doubt that any of the Sharp-tailed Sparrows sang more than 20 times per hour, although I made no comparable count.  Additionally, Seaside Sparrows sing from exposed perches such as tall cattail stems and tall or isolated marsh-elder bushes. Sharp-tailed Sparrows do not often use conspicuous perches for singing. They sing while on the ground or when in flight. They do use exposed perches as observation posts and occasionally sing from them.  Seaside Sparrows often face their nearest neighbor when singing and alternate songs with this bird. The one time Sharp-tailed Sparrows almost always sing is when they are involved in fighting. In such a case the several birds sing simultaneously.  Seaside Sparrows began singing the morning after their nocturnal arrival. For resident birds, singing is at its maximum at this time and is maintained at a high level throughout incubation. At hatching of the eggs, singing declines sharply; males then are busy aiding in care of the young. Males that have successfully reared a brood rarely sing after the young leave the nest.  Sharp-tailed Sparrows sang infrequently when they first arrived, and singing did not reach its peak until late May. By August singing had almost ceased in this species.  Song of the Seaside Sparrow functions importantly in the establishment and maintenance of its territory. Newly-arrived males sing vigorously. In the Sharp-tailed Sparrow I think song is merely an expression of sexual excitement because song does not reach maximum frequency until the females arrive and become receptive to the males.  Differences in song correspond to differences in territorial behavior. The distinct, loud song, sung often and from exposed perches, which is frequently alternated with that of the nearest competitor, is given by the Seaside Sparrow, a territorial species. The indistinct, quiet song, sung infrequently and often from unexposed places belongs to the Sharp-tailed Sparrow, a non-territorial species.   _Calls_  Seaside Sparrows give a soft, lisping call note, probably the one referred to by Saunders as a squeaky _tseep_ (1951:258), that functions as a social call. When migrants were numerous on the marshes at Chadwick I heard this note often. At Lavallette I did not hear it until June 30 (work began there on June 16) and then it was from an unbanded, non-resident bird. In late July and in August the number of non-resident sparrows increased and the social call was heard often. I never heard a resident bird give this call. On December 29, 1955, on a marsh at the mouth of the Manasquan River on the Monmouth-Ocean County line, a group of wintering Seaside Sparrows frequently used this call. I do not know whether the Sharp-tailed Sparrow has a comparable call.  Both species emit alarm notes. Although variable, the Seaside Sparrow has two general types. One, recorded by me as a short _chip_ or _tick_ was given by both sexes whenever I was near a nest. The other type, a high, sharp _tsip_, is indicative of a higher degree of excitement. When I captured young already out of the nest, or when I investigated nests containing young old enough to depart, the adults gave this call. The tail is jerked downward each time this note is given.  The alarm call of the Sharp-tailed Sparrow is not so loud as that of the Seaside Sparrow and it is not given so often. I described it as a short _tsick_ or _tsuck_. Females emitted such calls when I was at their nests or when male Sharp-tailed Sparrows came near their nests. Males may have a similar call, but I never recorded it. Montagna (1942a:116) remarks on the quietness of this species. This is especially evident when one compares Sharp-tailed Sparrows with Seaside Sparrows.   PLATE 1  [Illustration: FIG. _a_. An aerial photograph of the Lavallette study island.

Certain of these new arrivals established territories in areas unoccupied by the remaining original residents. These new residents were birds that probably had unsuccessful nestings elsewhere. Because of tropical storms that almost covered the island with water in August, I doubt that any of these late nestings were successful. On July 7 at 8:30 a.m., while watching a pair of these new arrivals, I recorded my only observation of copulation in the Seaside Sparrow. The female seemed to be searching for a nest site when copulation occurred. The female crawled about in a marsh-elder bush seemingly testing the various forks in the branches for size. The male followed her, remaining a few inches above and behind. Several times the two birds disappeared in the lower branches and were hidden by the surrounding black grass. Finally, while the female squatted on a branch the male mounted. He fluttered his wings before mounting and continued to do so as coition took place.  I began observations at Lavalette on June 16, too late to observe copulation of the early residents. All the nests contained eggs by that time. At Chadwick, pair formation seemingly never occurred, at least with the males I was studying. The territories established by males at Chadwick contained few marsh-elder bushes. Possibly females, finding no suitable nest sites, refused to accept these territories.  Copulation in the Sharp-tailed Sparrow was observed several times. It occurs most frequently in the course of, or immediately following, a fight between several males. I do not know what instigates the gathering of several males into these groups; it may be a certain behaviorism of a female, or possibly, merely the appearance of a female. Montagna (1942a:117) was convinced that females of _A. c. subvirgata_ were present in these fights. On the other hand, in two instances with _A. c. diversa_ where he collected all the birds in the group, no females were present. Twice, at Chadwick, my observations indicated that females of _A. c. caudacuta_ were not always involved in these groups. In these instances all the birds in the group had previously been banded and diagnosed as males. Possibly a female was the original stimulus of these groups, and she may have disappeared while the males were fighting with each other. I found it difficult to distinguish fighting males from a copulating pair. On June 3, however, a banded pair was observed. Copulation occurred on the ground. The male fluttered his wings as he mounted and the female remained motionless. Copulation lasted approximately three seconds; immediately thereafter the male flew to a nearby cattail stem and the female climbed a tussock of grass and chipped quietly. This same female was seen to copulate with other males, and males were observed copulating with several females.  _A. m. maritima_ is monogamous, the pair-bond being maintained throughout a breeding cycle. _A. c. caudacuta_ is promiscuous, relations between the sexes being limited to copulation. For _A. c. subvirgata_ a relationship other than promiscuity has been intimated (Lewis, 1920:587-589). Concerning observations of the nest he found at Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Lewis wrote: \"The nest was found after I had quietly watched the parent Sparrows for about an hour, while they were bringing food to their young.... The male sang from time to time from a piece of driftwood on the marsh about 30 feet distant from the nest. When I was examining the nest and the young birds, the parents made no demonstration for some minutes, but later they came near and uttered chip's, much like those of Savannah Sparrows.\"   NESTS  I found the nests of all eight pairs of Seaside Sparrows which nested on the Lavallette study island in 1955. Four nests were supported by marsh-elder bushes, three of which were dead. These nests were placed low enough to be hidden by numerous stems of black grass, as were the other four nests. Of the remaining four nests, three were placed in tussocks of black grass and the fourth one gained support mostly from cord-grass stems. The eight nests ranged from 9 to 11 inches (9.6 inch average) from the rim to the ground, the four nests in the bushes being the highest. The outside diameters of the nests ranged from 3 to 4.5 inches (3.9 inch average) and the outside depth varied between 2 and 3.5 inches (2.7 inch average). Seven of the nests had an inside depth of 1.5 inches; the other one was only an inch from the rim to the floor. The inside diameter of the cup varied between 2 and 2.5 inches.  As mentioned above all eight nests were shielded by stems of black grass. Stems were not woven over the nests by the birds; rather it was the choice of the nest sites that resulted in the concealment. The only plant used for nest material was black grass.  In all cases the black grass limited the directions from which the nests could be entered. Six of the nests were approached from a direction varying between northeast and southeast. The prevailing winds of spring and summer are from the south and southwest; the black grass consequently leans in the opposite direction. The remaining two nests were entered from the northwest. These were nests built in marsh-elder bushes where the grass stems were held upright by the branches of the bushes.  One nest, built in a small dead marsh-elder bush, was tilted by the growth of stems of black grass which were used for support on one side. This tilting did not cause the contents to spill, but, I judged, did cause the adults to desert the nest.  Seven nests of the Sharp-tailed Sparrow were found; two of these were old nests. Four of the five nests used in the breeding season of 1955 were found on the Lavallette marsh study area, the other one I discovered on the Chadwick marshes. Two young Sharp-tailed Sparrows that I saw at Lavallette were not from nests I found, nor were they from the same nest. Therefore, a minimum of six Sharp-tailed Sparrows bred on the Lavallette island. Measurements were taken of only the five nests that were used in 1955. The Sharp-tailed Sparrow builds its nest closer to the ground than does the Seaside Sparrow. The five nests were five to six inches off the ground; the two nests of a previous year appeared to have been no higher. The Sharp-tailed Sparrow nests were built in areas where black grass was the predominant plant, and the nests were constructed entirely from this grass. The outside diameters varied from 3 to 4.25 inches (3.4 inch average). The outside depth of the nests varied from 2 to 3.5 inches (2.8 inch average). The inside depth was 1.5 inches in all nests and the inside diameter ranged from 2 to 2.5 inches (2.1 inch average).  Harrison F. Lewis (1920:587) studied a nest of _A. c. subvirgata_ in a small salt marsh near Bunker's Island at the southern end of Yarmouth Harbor, Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, which he found on June 12, 1920. For details of this nest I quote Dr. Lewis. \"The nest proper was a neat, round cup of fine, dry, dead grass, with some horsehair in the lining. Its foundation consisted of some small masses of 'eel-grass' and roots. Its dimensions were: inside diameter, 2.5 in.; outside diameter, 4.5 in.; inside depth, 1.5 in.; outside depth 2.375 in. It was elevated above the general surface of the marsh by being placed on the top of a low, grassy ridge, about fourteen inches high, formed from material thrown up when a ditch was dug across the marsh, many years before. During some storm a mat of dead 'eel-grass' had been left on top of this ridge, and this had later been lifted by the growing marsh grass, leaving several inches between it and the ground. The nest was placed on the northwest edge of this mat, about half of the nest being under it, while the other side was sheltered and concealed by grass about six inches high. The nest was not sunk in the ground at all.\"  Two of the nests found were entered from the north-northeast, the other three from the east-southeast. All five nests were sheltered above by stems of black grass. Three of the nests were beneath a layer of dead black grass where a clump of erect living stems parted the mat. One nest (pl. 4, fig. a) was situated where cattail stubs held the black grass somewhat erect. Green stalks as well as dead stalks were woven into a canopy over this nest. Another nest was constructed on a mat of black grass under and among numerous horizontal living stems, some of which were woven into the outer lining of the nest (pl. 4, fig. b).  Nests of both species were found in tussocks of black grass. The locations of these sites differed. The Sharp-tailed Sparrow prefers the higher and therefore dryer portions of the marsh where black grass is the characteristic plant. Contrastingly the Seaside Sparrow almost always chooses the wetter portions of the marsh (Cruickshank, 1942:45; Forbush and May, 1939:514; Stone, 1937:906; personal observations) where several species of plants are abundant. In areas that have been ditched, as have almost all marshes in New Jersey, the mound of excavated muck is ideal for"]]]
