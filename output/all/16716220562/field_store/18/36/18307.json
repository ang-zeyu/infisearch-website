[_Aside._  _Don Scipio._ Do let me have it--Zounds, here's five pistoles, and the gold of the ring is not worth a dollar.  _Spado._ We always humour him; give him this ring, and take the money.                                        [_Apart.--Gives FERNANDO a Ring._  _Don Fer._ [_Presents it to DON SCIPIO._] There, sir.  _Don Scipio_ [_Gives Money._] And there, sir--Oh, you mercenary rascal! [_Aside._] I knew 'twas in the purse I gave you last night in the forest.  _Spado._ Give me the cash, I must account for his pocket money.

Pedrillo! sirrah!  _Don Scipio._ Run, don't you hear your master, you brace of rascals?--Fly!                                                           [_Exit SPADO._  _Don Scipio._ [_Looking out._] What an alteration!  _Enter PEDRILLO, richly dressed._  _Ped._ [_To FERNANDO._] How now, sirrah! loitering here, and leave me to dress myself, hey!                                                 [_With great Authority._  _Don Fer._ Sir, I was----                                                        [_With Humility._  _Ped._ Was!--and are--and will be, a lounging rascal, but you fancy you are still in your finery, you idle vagabond!  _Don Scipio._ Bless me, Don Fernando is very passionate, just like his father.  _Don Fer._ [_Aside._] The fellow, I see, will play his part to the top.  _Ped._ Well, Don Scipio,--A hey! an't I the man for the ladies? [_Strutting._] I am, for I have studied Ovid's Art of Love.  _Don Scipio._ Yes, and Ovid's Metamorphoses too, ha! ha! ha!  _Ped._ [_Aside._] He! he! he! what a sneaking figure my poor master cuts!--Egad! I'll pay him back all his domineering over me.--Pedrillo!  _Don Fer._ Your honour?  _Ped._ Fill this box with Naquatoch.

[_Going._  _Ped._ Pedrillo!  _Don Fer._ [_Aside._] What an impudent dog!--Sir?  _Ped._ Nothing--Abscond.  _Don Fer._ [_Aside._] If this be my picture, I blush for the original.  _Ped._ Master, to be like you, do let me give you one kick.                                                    [_Aside to FERNANDO._  _Don Fer._ What!  _Ped._ Why, I won't hurt you much.  _Don Fer._ I'll break your bones, you villain.  _Ped._ Ahem! Tol de rol.  _Don Scipio._ Pedrillo!  _Ped._ Sir?                                                   [_Forgetting himself._  _Don Fer._ [_Apart._] What are you at, you rascal?  _Ped._ Ay, what are you at, you rascal? avoid!  _Don Fer._ I'm gone, sir.                                                                 [_Exit._  _Ped._ Cursed ill-natured of him, not to let me give him one kick.                                                                [_Aside._  _Don Scipio._ Don Fernando, I like you vastly.  _Ped._ So you ought--Tol de rol.--Who could now suspect me to be the son of a tailor, and that, four hours ago, I was a footman! [_Aside._] Tol de rol.  _Don Scipio._ Son-in-law, you're a flaming beau!--Egad, you have a princely person.  _Ped._ All the young girls--whenever I got behind--Inside of a coach,--All the ladies of distinction, whether they were making their beds, or dressing the--dressing themselves at the toilet, would run to the windows,--peep through their fingers, their fans I mean, simper behind their handkerchiefs, and lisp out in the softest, sweetest tones, \"Oh, dear me, upon my honour and reputation, there is not such a beautiful gentleman in the world, as this same Don Pedrill--Fernando.\"  _Don Scipio._ Ha! ha! ha! can't forget Pedrillo.--But come, ha' done with your Pedrillos now--be yourself, son-in-law.  _Ped._ Yes, I will be yourself, son-in-law, you are sure of that honour, Don Scipio; but pray, what fortune am I to have with your daughter? You are a grey-headed old fellow, Don Scipio, and by the course of nature, you know, you cannot live long.  _Don Scipio._ Pardon me, sir, I don't know any such thing.  _Ped._ So when we put a stone upon your head----  _Don Scipio._ Put a stone upon my head!  _Ped._ Yes, when you are settled--screwed down, I shall have your daughter to maintain, you know.  _Don Scipio._ [_Aside._] A narrow-minded spark!  _Ped._ Not that I would think much of that, I am so generous.  _Don Scipio._ Yes, generous as a Dutch usurer!                                                                [_Aside._  _Ped._ The truth is Don Scipio, I was always a smart young gentleman.                                                     [_Dances and sings._  _Don Scipio._ A hey! Since Don Fernando turns out to be such a coxcomb, 'faith, I'm not sorry that my own child, has escaped him:--A convent itself is better than a marriage with a monkey.--The poor thing's fortune though!--And then my son--I begin now to think I was too hard upon Cæsar--to compare him with this puppy--but I must forget my children, Dame Isabel will have me upon no other terms.                                                                [_Aside._  _Ped._ D'ye hear, Don Scipio, let us have a plentiful feast.  _Don Scipio._ Was ever such a conceited, empty, impudent----                                                                 [_Exit._  _Ped._ Yes, I'm a capital fellow, ha! ha! So my fool of a master sets his wits to work after a poor girl, that, I am told, they are packing into a convent, and he dresses me up as himself, to carry the rich Italian heiress. Donna Victoria--Well, I'm not a capital fellow; but I was made for a gentleman--gentleman! I'm the neat pattern for a lord--I have a little honour about me--a bit of love too; ay, and a scrap of courage, perhaps--hem! I wish I'd a rival to try it though--odd, I think I could fight at any weapon, from a needle to a hatchet.  _Enter PHILIPPO, with a Letter and Basket._  _Phil._ Signor, are you Don Fernando de Zelva?  _Ped._ Yes, boy.  _Phil._ Here's a letter for you, sir, from Don Alphonso.  _Ped._ I don't know any Don Alphonso, boy. What's the letter about?  _Phil._ I think, sir, 'tis to invite you to a feast.  _Ped._ A feast!--Oh, I recollect now--Don Alphonso, what! my old acquaintance! give it me, boy.  _Phil._ But, are you sure, sir, you're Don Fernando?  _Ped._ Sure, you dog!--don't you think I know myself?--let's see, let's see--[_Opens the Letter, and reads._] _Signor, though you seem ready to fall on to a love-feast, I hope a small repast in the field won't spoil your stomach_--Oh, this is only a snack before supper--_I shall be, at six o'clock this evening_--You dog, it's past six now--_in the meadow, near the cottage of the vines, where I expect you'll meet me_--Oh dear, I shall be too late!--_As you aspire to Donna Victoria, your sword must be long enough to reach my heart, Alphonso._ My sword long enough! [_Frightened._] Oh, the devil!--Feast! Zounds, this is a downright challenge!   _Phil._ I beg your pardon, signor, but if I hadn't met my sweetheart, Catilina, you would have had that letter two hours ago.  _Ped._ Oh, you have given it time enough, my brave boy.  _Phil._ Well, sir, you'll come?  _Ped._ Eh! Yes, I dare say he'll come.  _Phil._ He!  _Ped._ Yes, I'll give it him, my brave boy.  _Phil._ Him! Sir, didn't you say you were----  _Ped._ Never fear, child, Don Fernando shall have it.  _Phil._ Why, sir, an't you Don Fernando?  _Ped._ Me! not I, child--no, no, I'm not Fernando, but, my boy, I would go to the feast, but you have delayed the letter so long, that I have quite lost my stomach--Go, my fine boy.  _Phil._ Sir, I----  _Ped._ Go along, child, go! [_Puts PHILIPPO off._] however, Don Fernando shall attend you--but here comes my sposa--  _Enter LORENZA, reading a Letter._      _Dearest LORENZA,_      _By accident I heard of your being in the castle--If you don't     wish to be the instrument of your mother's imposition, an impending     blow, which means you no harm, this night shall discover an     important secret relative to him, who desires to resign even life     itself, if not your_      RAMIREZ.   My love! [_Kisses the Letter._] I wish to be nothing, if not your Lorenza; this foolish Fernando! [_Looking at PEDRILLO._] but, ha! ha! ha! I'll amuse myself with him--looks tolerably now he's dressed--not so agreeable as my discarded lover Alphonso, though.

[_Hands a Chair._  _Lor._ So polite too!  _Ped._ Oh, I admire politeness.                                                                 [_Sits._  _Lor._ This would not be good manners in Florence, though.  _Ped._ Oh! [_Rises._] I beg pardon--Well, sit in that chair; I'll assure you, Donna Victoria, I don't grudge a little trouble for the sake of good manners.

Mind you let us all in by the little wicket in the east rampart.  _Spado._ I'll let you in, captain, and a banditti is like a cat, where the head can get in, the body will follow.  _Don Cæsar._ Soft! Letting down the drawbridge for me now may attract observation. [_Looks out._] Yonder I can get across the moat.  _Spado._ But, captain! [_Calling._] My dear captain!

I don't owe you any--  _Spado._ Yes, you do, sir; recollect, didn't you ever hire any thing of me?  _Ped._ Me! no!  _Spado._ Oh, yes; I lent you the use of my two fine ears, to hear your song, and the use of my most capital nose, to snuff up your macquabah.  _Ped._ Eh! what the deuce, do you hire out your senses and organs, and--  _Spado._ Yes, and if you don't instantly pay the hire, I'll strike up a symphonia on this little barrel organ here.

Alack-a-day, no, your honour, I am poor Spado.  _Don Juan._ Where's Don Scipio? What the devil, is this his hospitality? he has heard that I am here?  _Spado._ He hear! Ah, poor gentleman--hear! his misfortune!  _Don Juan._ Misfortune! What, he's married again?  _Spado._ At the brink.  _Don Juan._ Marry, and near threescore! What, has he lost his senses?  _Spado._ He has nearly lost one, sir.  _Don Juan._ But where is he? I want to ask him about it.  _Spado._ Ask! then you must speak very loud, sir.  _Don Juan._ Why, what, is he deaf?  _Spado._ Almost, sir, the dear gentleman can scarce hear a word.  _Don Juan._ Ah, poor fellow! Hey! Isn't yonder my son?

Spado, I hope he ha'n't heard of his son's pranks.  _Spado._ Hear! Ah! poor Don Juan's hearing! I've been roaring to him these five minutes.  _Don Scipio._ Roaring to him!  _Spado._ He's almost deaf.  _Don Scipio._ Bless me!  _Spado._ You must bellow to him like a speaking trumpet.

Strange that your deaf people always speak loud--[_Very loud._] I'm glad to see you, Don Scipio.  _Don Scipio._ When people are deaf themselves, they think every body else is too--How long have you been this way?
