Any Lady disposed to Matrimony, answering this Description, is desired to direct for Y. Z., at the Baptist's Head Coffee-house, Aldermanbury. _N.B._--The Gentleman can make adequate Return, and is, in every Respect, deserving a Lady with the above Qualifications.\"  This reminds us of the old lady who told her steward she wished him to attend a neighbouring fair in order to buy her a cow. She explained to him that it must be young, well-bred, fine in the skin, a strawberry in colour, straight in the back, and not given to breaking through fences when it smelt clover on the other side; above all, it was not to cost more than ten pounds. The steward, who was a Scotchman, and a privileged old servant, bowed his head and replied reverently, \"Then, my lady, I think ye had better kneel down and pray for her, for ye'll get her nae other way, I'm thinkin'.\"  While the possession of a little money is by no means a drawback, those do not well consult their happiness who marry for money alone.    \"In many a marriage made for gold,   The bride is bought--and the bridegroom sold.\"  Though Cupid is said to be blind, he is a better guide than the rules of arithmetic. We have false ideas of happiness. What will make me happy--contented? \"Oh, if I were rich, I should be happy!\" A gentleman who was enjoying the hospitalities of the great millionaire and king of finance, Rothschild, as he looked at the superb appointments of the mansion, said to his host, \"You must be a happy man!\" \"Happy!\" said he, \"happy! I happy--happy!\" \"Aye, happy!\" \"Let us change the subject.\" John Jacob Astor of America, was also told that he must be a very happy man, being so rich. \"Why,\" said he, \"would you take care of my property for your board and clothes? That's all I get for it.\" In taking a dowry with a wife \"thou losest thy liberty,\" says an old writer: \"she will ride upon thee, domineer as she list, wear the breeches in her oligarchical government, and beggar thee besides.\"  Better to have a fortune _in_ your wife than _with_ her. \"My wife has made my fortune,\" said a gentleman of great possessions, \"by her thrift, prudence, and cheerfulness, when I was just beginning.\" \"And mine has lost my fortune,\" answered his companion, bitterly, \"by useless extravagance, and repining when I was doing well.\" The girl who brings to her husband a large dowry may also bring habits of luxury learned in a rich home. She may be almost as incapable of understanding straitened circumstances as was the lady of the court of Louis XVI., who, on hearing of people starving, exclaimed, \"Poor creatures! No bread to eat! Then let them eat cakes!\"  Nor is it wise to marry for beauty alone: as even the finest landscape, seen daily, becomes monotonous, so does the most beautiful face, unless a beautiful nature shine through it. The beauty of to-day becomes commonplace to-morrow; whereas goodness, displayed through the most ordinary features, is perennially lovely. Moreover, this kind of beauty improves with age, and time ripens rather than destroys it. No man is so much to be pitied as the husband of a \"professional beauty.\" Yet beauty, when it betokens health, or when it is the outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace, is valuable, and has a great power of winning affection.  Above all things do not marry a fool who will shame you and reveal your secrets. For ourselves we do not believe the first part at least of Archbishop Whately's definition of woman: \"A creature that does not reason, and that pokes the fire from the top.\" The wife who does not and cannot make use of reason to overcome the daily difficulties of domestic life, and who can in no sense be called the companion of her husband, is a mate who hinders rather than helps. Sooner or later a household must fall into the hands of its women, and sink or swim according to their capacities. It is hard enough for a man to be married to a bad woman; but for a man who marries a foolish woman there is no hope.  \"One must love their friends with all their failings, but it is a great failing to be ill,\" and therefore unless you are one of those rare men who would never lose patience with a wife always in pain, when choosing you should think more of a healthy hue than of a hectic hue, and far more of good lungs than of a tightly-laced waist \"See that she chews her food well, and sets her foot down firmly on the ground when she walks, and you're all right.\"  As regards the marriageable age of women we may quote the following little conversation: \"No woman is worth looking at after thirty,\" said young Mrs. A., a bride with all the arrogant youthfulness of twenty-one summers. \"Quite true, my dear,\" answered Lady D., a very pretty woman some ten or fifteen years older; \"nor worth listening to before.\"  Please yourself, good sir! only do not marry either a child or an old woman. Certainly a man should marry to obtain a friend and companion rather than a cook and housekeeper; but yet that girl is a prize indeed who has so well prepared herself for the business of wifehood as to be able to keep not only her husband company, but her house in good order. \"If that man is to be regarded as a benefactor of his species who makes two stalks of corn to grow where only one grew before, not less is she to be regarded as a public benefactor who economizes and turns to the best practical account the food products of human skill and labour.\"  Formerly a woman's library was limited to the Bible and a cookery-book. This curriculum has now been considerably extended, and it is everywhere acknowledged that \"chemistry enough to keep the pot boiling, and geography enough to know the different rooms in her house,\" is _not_ science enough for women. It is surely not impossible, however, for an intending husband to find a girl who can make her higher education compatible with his comforts, who can when necessary bring her philosophy down to the kitchen. Why should literature unfit women for the everyday business of life? It is not so with men. You see those of the most cultivated minds constantly devoting their time and attention to the most homely objects.  The other day, speaking superficially and uncharitably, a person said of a woman, whom he knew but slightly, \"She disappoints me utterly. How could her husband have married her? She is commonplace and stupid.\" \"Yes,\" said a friend, reflectively, \"it is strange. She is not a brilliant woman, she is not even an intellectual one; but there is such a thing as a genius for affection, and she has it. It has been good for her husband that he married her.\" In the sphere of home the graces of gentleness, of patience, of generosity, are far more valuable than any personal attractions or mental gifts and accomplishments. They contribute more to happiness and are the source of sympathy and spiritual discernment. For does not the woman who can love see more and understand more than the most intellectual woman who has no heart?  A vacancy in the floor sweeping department of a public institution having been advertised, the testimonials to the intellectual and moral eminence of an old woman were overwhelming; but after the election it appeared she had only one arm! Not less unfitted to be a wife is the woman who, with every other qualification, has no genius for affection.  Dress is one of the little things that indicate character. A refined woman will always look neat; but, on the other hand, she will not bedizen and bedeck herself with a view to display. Again, there is no condition of life in which industry in a wife is not necessary to the happiness of a family. A lazy mistress makes lazy servants, and, what is worse, a lazy mother makes lazy children.  \"But how,\" asks Cobbett, \"is the purblind lover to ascertain whether she, whose smiles have bereft him of his senses--how is he to judge whether the beloved object will be industrious or lazy?\" In answer to this question several outward and visible signs are suggested, such as early rising, a lively, distinct utterance, a quick step, \"the labours of the teeth; for these correspond with those of the other members of the body, and with the operations of the mind.\"  Then we are told of a young man in Philadelphia, who, courting one of three sisters, happened to be on a visit to her, when all the three were present, and when one said to the others, \"I _wonder_ where _our_ needle is.\" Upon which he withdrew, as soon as was consistent with politeness, resolved never to think more of a girl who possessed a needle only in partnership, and who, it appeared, was not too well informed as to the place where even that share was deposited.  It would be impossible even to allude to every point of character that should be observed in choosing a wife. Frugality, or the power to abstain from unnecessary expenditure, is very important, so is punctuality. As to good temper, it is a most difficult thing to ascertain beforehand; smiles are so easily put on for the _lover's_ visits. We know the old conundrum--why are ladies"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35534"],["title","How to be Happy Though Married: Being a Handbook to Marriage (#7)"],["body","bells? Because you never know what metal they are made of until you _ring_ them. An ingenuous girl thus alluded to the change that is frequently perceptible after marriage. \"Your future husband seems very exacting: he has been stipulating for all sorts of things,\" said her mother to her. \"Never mind, Mamma,\" said the affectionate girl, who was already dressed for the wedding; \"these are his last wishes.\"  There is, however, one way of roughly guessing the qualifications of a girl for the most responsible position of a wife. Find out the character of her mother, and whether the daughter has been a good one and a good sister. Ask yourself, if you respect as well as admire her, and remember the words of Fichte: \"No true and enduring love can exist without esteem; every other draws regret after it, and is unworthy of any noble soul.\"  Thackeray said of women: \"What we (men) want for the most part is a humble, flattering, smiling, child-loving, tea-making being, who laughs at our jokes however old they may be, coaxes and wheedles us in our humours, and fondly lies to us through life.\" And he says of a wife: \"She ought to be able to make your house pleasant to your friends; she ought to attract them to it by her grace. Let it be said of her, 'What an uncommonly nice woman Mrs. Brown is!' Let her be, if not clever, an appreciator of cleverness. Above all, let her have a sense of humour, for a woman without a laugh in her is the greatest bore in existence.\" It is, we think, only very weak men who would wish their wives to \"fondly lie\" to them in this way. Better to be occasionally wound up like an eight-day clock by one's wife and made to go right. There is no one who gives such wise and brave advice as a good wife. She is another, a calmer and a better self. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, for he knows that when her criticism is most severe it is spoken in love and for his own good. Lord Beaconsfield described his wife as \"the most severe of critics, but a perfect wife.\"  Burns the poet, in speaking of the qualities of a good wife, divided them into ten parts. Four of these he gave to good temper, two to good sense, one to wit, one to beauty--such as a sweet face, eloquent eyes, a fine person, a graceful carriage; and the other two parts he divided amongst the other qualities belonging to or attending on a wife--such as fortune, connections, education (that is, of a higher standard than ordinary), family blood, &c.; but he said, \"Divide those two degrees as you please, only remember that all these minor proportions must be expressed by fractions, for there is not any one of them that is entitled to the dignity of an integer.\"  Let us add the famous advice given by Lord Burleigh to his son: \"When it shall please God,\" said he, \"to bring thee to man's estate, use great providence and circumspection in choosing thy wife, for from thence will spring all thy future good or evil. And it is an action of thy life, like unto a stratagem of war, wherein a man can err but once.... Inquire diligently of her disposition, and how her parents have been inclined in their youth. Let her not be poor, how generous (well-born) soever; for a man can buy nothing in the market with gentility. Nor choose a base and uncomely creature altogether for wealth, for it will cause contempt in others, and loathing in thee. Neither make choice of a dwarf or a fool, for by the one thou shalt beget a race of pigmies, while the other will be thy continual disgrace, and it will yirke (irk) thee to hear her talk. For thou shalt find it to thy great grief that there is nothing more fulsome than a she-fool.\"  The ideal wife is either what Crashaw calls an \"impossible she,\" or--    \"Somewhere in the world must be   She that I have prayed to see,   She that Love assigns to me.\"  But then--    \"Shall we ever, ever meet?   Shall I find in thee, my sweet,   Visions true and life complete?\"  To the old question, \"Who can _find_?\" it may too often be replied, Who _seeks_ \"a virtuous woman\"? Is she wealthy? is she pretty? is she talented? are questions asked more frequently than Is she good, sensible, industrious, affectionate? And yet that man takes to himself one of the bitterest of earth's curses who marries carelessly instead of seeking with all diligence for those qualities in a wife that are the foundation of lasting happiness.  A minister's wife falling asleep in church, her husband thus addressed her: \"Mrs. B., a' body kens that when I got ye for my wife I got nae beauty; yer frien's ken that I got nae siller; and if I dinna get God's grace I shall hae a puir bargain indeed.\" If men would seek for wives women with the grace of God, if they would choose them as they do their clothes, for qualities that will last, they would get much better bargains.  One reason for this carelessness about the character of a wife may be found in the prevailing opinion that there is little or no room for choice in matters matrimonial. Sir John More (father of the Chancellor, Sir Thomas) was often heard to say, \"I would compare the multitude of women which are to be chosen for wives unto a bag full of snakes, having among them a single eel. Now, if a man should put his hand into this bag, he may chance to light on the eel; but it is a hundred to one he shall be stung by a snake.\"  Perhaps the lottery theory of marriage was never stated more strongly or with greater cynicism; but is it true? If it were, to expend care and attention in choosing a wife would be to labour in vain. If, however, marriage is by no means such an affair of chance, a prudent choice may prevent a man from being stung by a snake, and may give him a goodly eel as his marriage portion. The important thing to do is to keep well in mind the fact that a man's prospect of domestic felicity does not depend upon the face, the fortune, or the accomplishments of his wife, but upon her character. The son of Sirach says that he would rather dwell with a lion and a dragon than to keep house with a wicked woman. \"He that hath hold of her is as though he held a scorpion. A loud crying woman and a scold shall be sought out to drive away the enemies.\" On the other hand, \"the grace of a wife delighteth her husband, and her discretion will fatten his bones. A silent and loving woman is a gift of the Lord; and there is nothing so much worth as a mind well instructed.\"     CHAPTER V  THE CHOICE OF A HUSBAND.    \"How shall I know if I do choose the right?\"--_Shakespeare._    \"God, the best maker of marriages, bless you!\"--_Ibid._       \"And while thou livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and      uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee right, because      he hath not the gift to woo in other places; for these fellows of      infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours,      they do always reason themselves out again. What! a speaker is      but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a      straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curled      pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax      hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon; or,      rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it shines bright, and      never changes, but keeps his course truly.\"--_Ibid._   They that enter into the state of marriage cast a die of the greatest contingency, and yet of the greatest interest in the world, next to the last throw for eternity. Life or death, felicity or a lasting sorrow, are in the power of marriage. A woman, indeed, ventures most, for she hath no sanctuary to retire to from an evil husband; she must dwell upon her sorrow and hatch the eggs which her own folly or infelicity hath produced; and she is more under it, because her tormentor hath a warrant of prerogative, and the woman may complain to God, as subjects do of tyrant princes; but otherwise she hath no appeal in the causes of unkindness. And though the man can run from many hours of his sadness, yet he must return to it again; and when he sits among his neighbours he remembers the objection that is in his bosom, and he sighs deeply. \"The boys and the pedlars and the fruiterers shall tell of this man when he is carried to his grave that he lived and died a poor, wretched person.\"  In these words Jeremy Taylor puts before men and women the issues of choice in matrimony. What, however, concerns us in this chapter is that \"a woman ventures most.\" \"Love is of man's life a thing apart, 'tis woman's whole existence.\" How important that a treasure which is dear as life itself should be placed in safe keeping! And yet so blind is love that defects often seem to be virtues, deformity assumes the style of beauty, and even hideous vices have appeared under an attractive form.  In Shakespeare's play Cleopatra speaks of an old attachment which she had lived to despise as having arisen in her \"salad days,\" when she was green in judgment. In extreme youth love is especially blind, and for this, as well as for other reasons, girls, who are yet at school, do not consult their best interests when they allow love to occupy their too youthful minds. It prevents the enjoyment of happy years of maidenhood, and sometimes leads to marriage before the girl is fit, either physically, mentally, or domestically, for the cares of married life.  \"I believe,\" says R. W. Dale, of Birmingham, \"in falling in love. The imagination should be kindled and the heart touched; there should be enthusiasm and even romance in the happy months that precede marriage, and something of the enthusiasm and romance should remain to the very end of life, or else the home is wanting in its perfect happiness and grace. But take my word for it, solid virtues are indispensable to the security and happiness of a home.\"  You would not like to live with a liar, with a thief, with a drunkard, for twenty or thirty years. A lazy man will make but a weak band or support for his and your house; so will one"]]]
