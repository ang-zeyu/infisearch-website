When I say or do a thing which seems to me to be perfectly right, I read immediately in Marie's countenance an expression of proud satisfaction which elevates me; and so when my conscience reproaches me her face instantly clouds over. Although I have great power over her mind, I see with pleasure that she awes me; and so long as I love her as I do now I am sure that I shall never allow myself to be drawn into anything that is wrong.\"  Many a man has been shown the pathway to heaven by his wife's practice of piety. \"My mercy,\" says Bunyan, \"was to light upon a wife whose father and mother were accounted godly. This woman and I, though we came together as poor as poor might be (not having so much household stuff as a dish or a spoon betwixt us both), yet she had for her part 'The Plain Man's Pathway to Heaven' and 'The Practice of Piety,' which her father had left her when he died.\" By reading these and other good books, helped by the kindly influence of his wife, Bunyan was gradually reclaimed from his evil ways, and led gently into the way of righteousness.  Nor does this companionship of good wives, which enables men to gain \"in sweetness and in moral height,\" cause them in the least degree to lose \"the wrestling thews which throw the world.\" Quite the reverse. Weak men have displayed real public virtue, and strong men have been made stronger, because they had by their side a woman of noble character, who exercised a fortifying influence on their conduct. Lady Rachel Russell is one of the many celebrated women who have encouraged their husbands to suffer and be strong. She sat beside her husband day after day during his public trial, taking notes and doing everything to help him.  In the sixth year of his marriage Baxter was brought before the magistrates for holding a conventicle, and was sentenced to be confined in Clerkenwell Gaol. There he was joined by his wife, who affectionately nursed him during his imprisonment. \"She was never so cheerful a companion to me,\" he says, \"as in prison, and was very much against me seeking to be released.\"  There is a sort of would-be wit which consists in jesting at the supposed bondage of the married state. The best answer to this plentiful lack of wit is the fact that some of the best of men have kissed the shackles which a wife imposes, and have either thought or said, \"If this be slavery, who'd be free?\" Luther, speaking of his wife, said, \"I would not exchange my poverty with her for all the riches of Croesus without her.\" In more recent times the French statesman, M. Guizot, says in his \"Mémoires\": \"What I know to-day, at the end of my race, I have felt when it began, and during its continuance. Even in the midst of great undertakings domestic affections form the basis of life, and the most brilliant career has only superficial and incomplete enjoyments if a stranger to the happy ties of family and friendship.\" Not long ago, when speaking of his wife, Prince Bismarck said, \"She it is who has made me what I am.\"  And there have been English statesmen who could say quite as much. Burke was sustained amid the anxiety and agitation of public life by domestic felicity. \"Every care vanishes,\" he said, \"the moment I enter under my own roof!\" Of his wife he said that she was \"not made to be the admiration of everybody, but the happiness of one.\" A writer in a recent number of _Leisure Hour_ relates the following of Lord Beaconsfield: \"The grateful affection which he entertained for his wife, whom he always esteemed as the founder of his fortunes, is well known. She was in the habit of travelling with him on almost all occasions. A friend of the earl and of the narrator of the incident was dining with him, when one of the party--a Member of the House for many years, of a noble family, but rather remarkable for raising a laugh at his buffoonery than any admiration for his wisdom--had no better taste or grace than to expostulate with Disraeli for always taking the viscountess with him. 'I cannot understand it,' said the graceless man, 'for, you know, you make yourself a perfect laughing-stock wherever your wife goes with you.' Disraeli fixed his eyes upon him very expressively and said, 'I don't suppose you can understand it, B.--I don't suppose you can understand it, for no one could ever in the last and wildest excursions of an insane imagination suppose you to be guilty of gratitude!'\"  It is true that there have been memorable celibates, but in the main the world's work has been done by the married. Fame and reward are powerful incentives, but they bear no comparison to the influence exercised by affection.  A man's wife and family often compel him to do his best; and, when on the point of despairing, they force him to fight like a hero, not for himself, but for them. Curran confessed that when he addressed a court for the first time, if he had not felt his wife and children tugging at his gown, he would have thrown up his brief and relinquished the profession of a lawyer.  \"It is often the case when you see a great man, like a ship, sailing proudly along the current of renown, that there is a little tug--his wife--whom you cannot see, but who is directing his movements and supplying the motive power.\" This truth is well illustrated by the anecdote told of Lord Eldon, who, when he had received the Great Seal at the hands of the king, being about to retire, was addressed by his majesty with the words, \"Give my remembrance to Lady Eldon.\" The Chancellor, in acknowledging the condescension, intimated his ignorance of Lady Eldon's claim to such a notice. \"Yes, yes,\" the king answered; \"I know how much I owe to Lady Eldon. I know that you would have made yourself a country curate, and that she has made you my Lord Chancellor.\" Sir Walter Scott and Daniel O'Connell, at a late period of their lives, ascribed their success in the world principally to their wives.  When Sir Joshua Reynolds--himself a bachelor--met the sculptor Flaxman shortly after his marriage, he said to him, \"So, Flaxman, I am told you are married; if so, sir, I tell you you are ruined for an artist.\" Flaxman went home, sat down beside his wife, took her hand in his, and said, \"Ann, I am ruined for an artist.\" \"How so, John? How has it happened? and who has done it?\" \"It happened,\" he replied, \"in the church, and Ann Denman has done it.\" He then told her of Sir Joshua's remark--whose opinion was well known, and had often been expressed, that if students would excel they must bring the whole powers of their mind to bear upon their art, from the moment they rose until they went to bed; and also, that no man could be a _great_ artist unless he studied the grand works of Raphael, Michael Angelo, and others, at Rome and Florence. \"And I,\" said Flaxman, drawing up his little figure to its full height, \"_I_ would be a great artist.\" \"And a great artist you shall be,\" said his wife, \"and visit Rome, too, if that be really necessary to make you great.\" \"But how?\" asked Flaxman. \"_Work and economize_,\" rejoined the brave wife; \"I will never have it said that Ann Denman ruined John Flaxman for an artist.\" And so it was determined by the pair that the journey to Rome was to be made when their means would admit. \"I will go to Rome,\" said Flaxman, \"and show the President that wedlock is for a man's good rather than his harm; and you, Ann, shall accompany me.\"  After working for five years, aided by the untiring economy of his wife, Flaxman actually did accomplish his journey. On returning from Rome, where he spent seven years, conscious of his indebtedness to his wife, he devised an original gift as a memorial of his domestic happiness. He caused a little quarto book to be made, containing some score or so of leaves, and with pen and pencil proceeded to fill and embellish it. On the first page is drawn a dove with an olive branch in her mouth; an angel is on the right and an angel on the left, and between is written, \"To Ann Flaxman\"; below, two hands are clasped as at an altar, two cherubs bear a garland, and there follows an inscription to his wife introducing the subject. Instead of finding his genius maimed by his alliance with Ann Denman, this eminent sculptor was ever ready to acknowledge that his subsequent success was in a great part marriage-made.  It was through the eyes of his wife that Huber, the great authority on bees, who was blind from his seventeenth year, conducted his observations and studies. He even went so far as to declare that he should be miserable were he to regain his eyesight. \"I should not know,\" he said, \"to what extent a person in my situation could be beloved; besides, to me my wife is always young, fresh, and pretty, which is no light matter.\"  Sir William Hamilton of Edinburgh found his wife scarcely less helpful, especially after he had been stricken by paralysis through overwork. When he was elected Professor of Logic and Metaphysics, and had no lectures on stock, his wife sat up with him night after night to write out a fair copy of the lectures from the rough sheets which he had drafted in the adjoining room. \"The number of pages in her handwriting still preserved is,\" says Sir William's biographer, \"perfectly marvellous.\"  Equally effective as a literary helper was Lady Napier, the wife of Sir William Napier, historian of the Peninsular War. She translated and epitomized the immense mass of original documents, many of them in cipher, on which it was in a great measure founded. When Wellington was told of the art and industry she had displayed in deciphering King Joseph's portfolios, and the immense mass of correspondence taken at Vittoria, he at first would hardly believe it, adding: \"I would have given £20,000 to any person who could have done this for me in the Peninsula.\" Sir William Napier's handwriting being almost illegible, Lady Napier made out his rough interlined manuscript, which he himself could scarcely"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35534"],["title","How to be Happy Though Married: Being a Handbook to Marriage (#5)"],["body",", and wrote out a fair copy for the printer; and all this vast labour she undertook and accomplished, according to the testimony of her husband, without having for a moment neglected the care and education of a large family.  The help and consolation that Hood received from his wife during a life that was a prolonged illness is one of the most affecting things in biography. He had such confidence in her judgment that he read and re-read and corrected with her assistance all that he wrote. He used to trust to her ready memory for references and quotations. Many wives deserve, but few receive, such an I.O.U. as that which the grateful humorist gave to his wife in one of his letters when absent from her side. \"I never was anything, Dearest, till I knew you, and I have been a better, happier, and more prosperous man ever since. Lay by that truth in lavender, Sweetest, and remind me of it when I fail. I am writing warmly and fondly, but not without good cause.... Perhaps there is an afterthought that, whatever may befall me, the wife of my bosom will have the acknowledgment of her tenderness, worth, excellence--all that is wifely or womanly--from my pen.\"  Mr. Froude says of Carlyle's wife that \"her hardest work was a delight to her when she could spare her husband's mind an anxiety or his stomach an indigestion. While he was absorbed in his work and extremely irritable as to every ailment or discomfort, her life was devoted to shield him in every possible way.\" In the inscription upon her tombstone Carlyle bore testimony that he owed to his wife a debt immense of gratitude. \"In her bright existence she had more sorrows than are common, but also a soft invincibility, a capacity of discernment, and a noble loyalty of heart which are rare. For forty years she was the true and loving helpmate of her husband, and by act and word unweariedly forwarded him as none else could in all of worthy that he did or attempted. She died at London, April 21st, 1866, suddenly snatched away from him, and the light of his life as if gone out.\"  What an influence women have exercised upon teachers of religion and philosophy! When no one else would encourage Mahomet, his wife Kadijah listened to him with wonder, with doubt. At length she answered: \"Yes, it was true this that he said.\" We can fancy, as does Carlyle, the boundless gratitude of Mahomet, and how, of all the kindnesses she had done him, this of believing the earnest struggling word he now spoke was the greatest. \"It is certain,\" says Novalis, \"my conviction gains infinitely the moment another soul will believe in it.\" It is a boundless favour. He never forgot this good Kadijah. Long afterwards, Ayesha, his young favourite wife, a woman who indeed distinguished herself among the Moslem by all manner of qualities, through her whole long life, this young brilliant Ayesha was one day questioning him: \"Now am I not better than Kadijah? she was a widow; old, and had lost her looks: you love me better than you did her?\" \"No, by Allah!\" answered Mahomet: \"No, by Allah! She believed in me when none else would believe. In the whole world I had but one friend, and she was that!\"  It will suffice to hint at the scientific value of the little that has been disclosed respecting Madame Clothilde de Vaux in elucidating the position of Auguste Comte as a teacher. Some may think that John Stuart Mill first taught his wife and then admired his own wisdom in her. His own account of the matter is very different, as we learn from the dedication of his essay \"On Liberty\":  \"To the beloved and deplored memory of her who was the inspirer, and in part the author, of all that is best in my writings--the friend and wife whose exalted sense of truth and right was my strongest incitement, and whose approbation was my chief reward--I dedicate this volume. Like all that I have written for many years, it belongs as much to her as to me; but the work as it stands has had, in a very insufficient degree, the inestimable advantage of her revision; some of the most important portions having been reserved for a more careful re-examination, which they are now never destined to receive. Were I but capable of interpreting to the world one-half the great thoughts and noble feelings which are buried in her grave, I should be the medium of a greater benefit to it than is ever likely to arise from anything that I can write, unprompted and unassisted by her all but unrivalled wisdom.\"  In a speech upon woman's rights, a lady orator is said to have exclaimed, \"It is well known that Solomon owed his wisdom to the number of his wives!\" This is too much; nevertheless, Sir Samuel Romilly gave the experience of many successful men when he said that there was nothing by which through life he had more profited than by the just observations and the good opinion of his wife.  Most people are acquainted with husbands who have lost almost all self-reliance and self-help because their wives have been only too helpful to them. Trollope and George Eliot faithfully portrayed real life in their stories when they put the reins into the hands of good wives and made them drive the domestic coach, to the immense advantage and comfort of the husbands, who never suspected the real state of the case. No man has so thoroughly as Trollope brought into literature the idea which women have of men--creatures that have to be looked after as grown-up little boys; interesting, piquant, indispensable, but shiftless, headstrong, and at bottom absurd.  But this consciousness which good wives have of the helplessness of husbands renders them all the more valuable in their eyes. Before Weinsberg surrendered to its besiegers, the women of the place asked permission of the captors to remove their valuables. The permission was granted, and shortly after the women were seen issuing from the gates carrying their husbands on their shoulders. Indeed it would be impossible to relate a tenth part of the many ways in which good wives have shown affection for and actively assisted their wedded lords. Knowing this to be the case, we were not surprised to read some time since the following piece of Irish news: \"An inquiry was held at Mullingar on Wednesday respecting Mr. H. Smythe's claim of £10,000 as compensation for the loss of his wife, who was shot whilst returning from church. The claim was made under the nineteenth section of the Crime Preservation Act, Ireland.\" The result of the inquiry we do not know, but for ourselves we think that £10,000 would barely compensate for the loss of a really good article in wives.  Some one told an old bachelor that a friend had gone blind. \"Let him marry, then,\" was the crusty reply; \"let him marry, and if that doesn't open his eyes, then his case is indeed hopeless.\" But this, we must remember, was not the experience of a married man.  A friend was talking to Wordsworth of De Quincey's articles about him. Wordsworth begged him to stop; he hadn't read them, and did not wish to ruffle himself about them. \"Well,\" said the friend, \"I'll tell you only one thing he says, and then we'll talk of other things. He says your wife is too good for you.\" The old poet's dim eyes lighted up, and he started from his chair, crying with enthusiasm, \"And that's true! There he's right!\" his disgust and contempt visibly moderating. Many a man whose faith in womankind was weak before marriage can a few years afterwards sympathize most fully with this pathetic confession of the old poet.  A Scotch dealer, when exhorting his son to practise honesty on the ground of its being the \"best policy,\" quietly added, \"I hae tried _baith_.\" So is it in reference to matrimony and celibacy. The majority of those who have \"tried baith\" are of opinion that the former is the best policy.  It would be absurd to assert that the marriage state is free from care and anxiety; but what of that? Is not care and trouble the condition of any and every state of life? He that will avoid trouble must avoid the world. \"Marriage,\" says Dr. Johnson, \"is not commonly unhappy, but as life is unhappy.\" And the summing up, so to speak, of this great authority is well known--\"Marriage has many pains, but celibacy no pleasures.\"     CHAPTER IV.  THE CHOICE OF A WIFE.    \"Go, draw aside the curtains, and discover   The several caskets to this noble prince:--   Now make your choice.\"--_Shakespeare._       \"If, as Plutarch adviseth, one must eat _modium salis_, a bushel      of salt, with him before he choose his friend, what care should      be had in choosing a wife--his second self! How solicitous should      he be to know her qualities and behaviour! and, when he is      assured of them, not to prefer birth, fortune, beauty, before      bringing up and good conditions.\"--_Robert Burton._   Whether a man shall be made or marred by marriage greatly depends upon the choice he makes of a wife. Nothing is better than a good woman, nor anything worse than a bad one. The idea of the great electrician Edison's marrying was first suggested by an intimate friend, who made the point that he needed a mistress to preside over his large house, which was being managed by a housekeeper and several servants. Although a very shy man, he seemed pleased with the proposition, and timidly inquired whom he should marry The friend somewhat testily replied, \"Any one;\" that a man who had so little sentiment in his soul as to ask such a question ought to be satisfied with anything that wore a petticoat and was decent.  Woe to the man who follows such careless advice as this, and marries \"any one,\" for what was said by the fox to the sick lion might be said with equal truth to Hymen: \"I notice that there are many prints of feet entering your cave, but I see no trace of any returning.\" Before taking the irrevocable step choose well, for your choice though brief is yet endless. And, first, we make the obvious suggestion that it is useless to seek perfection in a wife, even though you may fancy yourself capable of"]]]
