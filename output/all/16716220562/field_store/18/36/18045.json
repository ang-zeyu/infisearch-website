[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3546"],["title","The Eureka Stockade (#6)"],["body"," correct, as far as it goes.  Some five hundred diggers were present.  Now for the perversion from the reporter of 'The Argus', Melbourne, Tuesday, October 2.  \"Carboni Raffaello, a foreigner [a foreign anarchist, if you please, Mr. Editor], then spoke in his usual style [that is, sedition, revolution, and rebellion, that's it], the principal (sic) points of his remarks being, that while incarcerated in the Melbourne gaol [was it for common felony, or high treason?] he was not supplied with snuff, though he had entreated his learned counsel, Mr. J. H. Dunne, for sixpenny worth.  He [Please, Raffaello or Dunne? fine pair together] did not consider himself under any obligation to the lawyers:  he [but who?  Dunne or Raffaello?] was not fond of yabber-yabber.\"  Thus an honest man is brayed at by asses in this colony! The fun is odious and ridiculous enough.  When such reporters of the British press prostitute British ink, the only ink that dares to register black on white the name, word and deed of any tyrant through the whole face of the earth, and for the sake of a pair of Yankee boots, lower themselves to the level of a scribbler, thus affording to be audacious because anonymous, the British press in the southern hemisphere will be brought to shame, and Victoria cannot possibly derive any benefit from it.  Let the above observation stand good, I proceed with my work.  'The Age' was then just budding, and was considered, on the diggings the organ of the new chum Governor.  'The Age' soon mustered a Roman courage in the cause of the diggers, and jumped the claims both of The Herald and 'The Argus'; and though the 'own correspondent,' under the head of Ballaarat, be such a dry, soapy concern that will neither blubber nor blather, yet 'The Age' remained the diggers' paper.  The 'Ballaarat Times' was all the go, on the whole extent of the diggings. Soon enough the reporter, aye, the editor himself, will both appear 'in propria persona'.     Chapter XVII.    Arcane, Impenetrabili, Profunde, Son Le Vie Di Chi Die L'Esser Al Niente.   When our southern sky is overloaded with huge, thick, dark masses, and claps of thunder warn us of the pending storm, then a gale of wind is roaring in space, doing battle with the bush, cowing down man and beast, sweeping away all manner of rottenness.  This fury spares not, and desolation is the threat of the thunder.  A kind Providence must be blessed even in the whirlwind.  Big, big drops of rain fight their way through the gale; soon the drops muster in legions, and the stronger the storm, the stronger those legions.  At last they conquer; then it pours down--that is, the flood is made up of legions of torrents.  Is the end of the world now at hand?  Look at the victorious rainbow! it reminds man of the covenant of our God with Noah, not far from this southern land.  The sun restores confidence that all is right again as before, and nature, refreshed and bolder, returns again to her work.  Hence, the storm is life.  Not so is the case with fire.  Devouring everything, devouring itself, fire seems to leave off its frenzy, only to devour the sooner any mortal thing that comes in the way to retard destruction.  A few embers, then a handful of ashes, are the sole evidence of what was once kingly or beggarly.  Fire may destroy, consume, devour, but has no power to reduce to 'nothing.'  Hence the calamity of fire is death.  The handful of ashes lie lifeless until a storm forces them into the living order of nature, which, when refreshed, has the power to ingraft those ashes to, and make them prosper with, the grain of mustard seed.  Hence death is life.  Such is the order of Providence.  Now, good reader, watch the handful of ashes of what was once Bentley's Eureka Hotel.     Chapter XVIII.    Pecunia Omnia Vincit.   In the dead of the night after the burning of the Eureka Hotel, three men had been taken into custody, charged with riot, and subsequently committed to take their trial in Melbourne.  I think the diggers at this time seriously contemplated to burn down the Camp, and thus get rid in a blaze of all their grievances.  A committee for the defence of these men, met at the Star Hotel, and sent round to all the tents on Ballaarat for subscriptions.  I contributed my mite, and then learned that VERN, KENNEDY, and HUMFFRAY were the triumvirate of said committee.  The following placard was posted throughout the goldfields:-   500 POUNDS REWARD  for the discovery, apprehension and conviction of the murderer of James Scobie, found dead near the late Eureka Hotel, etc., etc.   At one and at the same time, also, the following placards were posted at each prominent gum-tree on the goldfield:-   500 POUNDS REWARD  increased by Government to  1,600 POUNDS!!  for the apprehension and conviction of the robbers of the Bank of Victoria.   A desperate deed was committed in broad mid-day; Monday, October 16th, in the Ballaarat township.  Four men in the garb of diggers, wearing sou'-wester hats, and having crepe over their faces, entered the Bank of Victoria, and succeeded in carrying off property in notes and gold, to the amount of about 15,000 pounds.  Who would have told me then, that soon I should be messmate to those unknown audacious robbers, in the same gaol!!  Let's go to the public meeting in the next chapter.     Chapter XIX.    Una Scintilla, Sparasi La Bomba, Spalanca A Multitudini La Tomba.   The following story was going the rounds of the Eureka.  There was a licence-hunt; the servant of the Rev. P. Smyth, the priest of the Catholic church, Bakery-hill, went to a neighbouring tent to visit a sick man. While inside, a trooper comes galloping up at the tent-door, and shouts out, \"Come out here, you d----d wretches! there's a good many like you on the diggings.\"  The man came outside, and was asked if \"he's got a licence?\" The servant, who is a native of Armenia, answers, in imperfect English, that he is a servant to the priest.  The trooper says, \"Damn you and the priest,\" and forthwith dismounts for the purpose of dragging Johannes M'Gregorius, the servant, along with him.  The servant remonstrates by saying he is a disabled man, unable to walk over the diggings. This infuriates the trooper, he strikes and knocks down the poor disabled foreigner, drags him about, tears his shirt--in short, inflicting such injuries on the poor fellow, that all the diggers present cried out \"shame! shame!\"  Commissioner Johnson rides up, and says to the crowd about him, that he should not be interrupted in the execution of his 'dooty.' The priest hears of his servant's predicament, comes to the spot, hands a five-pound note to Johnson as bail for his servant's appearance the next day at the police-office.  The following morning, Johannes M`Gregorius is charged with being on the gold-fields without a licence.  The poor foreigner tries to make a defence, but was fined five pounds.  Commissioner Johnson now comes in and says, M`Gregorius is not charged with being without a licence, but with assaulting the trooper Lord--ridiculous!  This alters the case.  The trooper is called, and says the old story about the execution of 'dooty,' that is, licence-hunting.  A respectable witness takes his oath that he saw the trooper strike the foreigner with his clenched fist, and knock him down.  The end of the story is in the Ballaarat tune, then in vogue:  \"Fined 5 pounds; take him away.\"     Chapter XX.    Public Meeting Held at the Catholic Chapel, Bakery-hill, Wednesday, October 25th.   After a good deal of pretty intelligible talk about the 'helpless Armenian,' the trooper Lord, and our respected priest; Thomas Kennedy, pouncing on the thing of the day proposed:--  \"That it is the opinion of this meeting that the conduct of Mr. Commissioner Johnson towards the Rev. Mr. Smyth has been calculated to awaken the highest feeling of indignation on the part of his devoted flock:  and to call upon the government to institute an inquiry into his (gold-lace) character, and to desire to have him at once removed from Ballaarat.\"  Carried unanimously.  The priest was requested to address the meeting.  Father Patricius Smyth, a native of Mayo, looks some thirty-five years old, and belongs to the unadulterated Irish caste--half-curled hair, not abundant, anxious semicircular forehead, keen and fiery eyes, altogether a lively interesting head.  He is a Latin and Celtic scholar; and that excuses him for his moderate proficiency in modern languages.  He was educated at Maynooth, the eye-sore of Sabbatarians, and therefore believes it incontestable that the authority conferred on him by the Bishop must needs be derived from God; because the Bishop had been consecrated by the Pope, who--inasmuch as a second branch of the Prince of the Apostles never was heard of at the time of St. Augustin--is the successor of St. Peter, the corner stone on which OUR LORD did build the Christian church, and our Lord's warrant is written in St. John, chapter xiv, 24:  'Sermo quem auditis non est meus, sed ejus qui misit me, nempe Patris.'  And so Father Smyth feels himself entitled to adopt what was said of the Divine Master, 'Docebat enim eos ut habens auctoritatem, non autem ut scribae.'  St. Matthew, chap. vii, 29. Hence his preaching, though not remarkable for much eloquence, does not lull to sleep.  There is no cant, and strange as it may appear, there is little argument in his short-framed sentences, because they are the decided opinion of his mind and the warm expression of his heart, anxious for the salvation of his flock, as he believes he will be called to account if any be lost.  He, out of civility, may not object to hear what Paley or Butler has to say, but he scorns any conversation with Voltaire, and would see the fellow burnt, as in the times of old.  His character was never impeached, because his conduct is an example to all of the strength of his faith.  Either at the altar or at the table he forgets not that he belongs to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3546"],["title","The Eureka Stockade (#7)"],["body","of Ireland, the 'proved gold' of the Catholic church.  His song is, 'Erin, my country,' and 'I love thy green bowers,' is the end of his story, which is a hint to me that this is not the place to say more for the peace of John Bull.  Hence Ireland produced a Daniel O'Connell, but has not yet got the repeal.  Father Smyth, in addressing the meeting, spoke with coolness and forbearance, yet commendatory of the constitutional manner in which his congregation sought redress from the government, for the insult offered them, through his person, in the abuse of his servant by the trooper Lord.  On concluding his address, he was warmly cheered, when the reverend gentleman and his friends adjourned to the parsonage, to partake of some refreshments.     Chapter XXI.    Public Meeting Held on Bakery-hill, November llth.   Political changes contemplated by THE REFORM LEAGUE.  1.  A full and fair representation.--Don't you wish you may get it?  2.  Manhood suffrage.--Thanks to the Eureka-boys, it costs now one pound. Cheap!  3.  No property qualification of members for the Legislative Council.--The identical thing for 'starring' on stumps to a fellow's heart's content.  4.  Payment of members.--That's the accommodation!  5.  Short duration of Parliament.--Increase the chances of accommodation, that's it.  What was the freight per ton, of this sort of worn out twaddle imported from old England?  How much does this new chum's bosh fetch in the southern markets, and in the Victorian market particularly?  For my part I decline to answer, because I want to attend at the meeting. J. B. Humffray, is the Secretary of the League; his name is going now the round of the diggings; I wish to see the man in person; is he a great, grand, or big man? that's the question.  When you seen JOHN BASSON HUMFFRAY, you have at once before you a gentleman, born of a good old family; his manners confirm it, and his words indicate an honest benevolent heart, directed by a liberal mind, entangled perhaps by too much reading of all sorts, perplexed at the prosperity of the vicious, and the disappointment of the virtuous in this mysterious world of ours, but could never turn wicked, because he believes in the resurrection of life. He is looking some thirty five years old, his person is well proportioned, but inclining to John Bull's.  His prepossessing countenance is made up of a fine forehead, denoting astuteness, not so much as shrewdness, how, when and whither to shift his pegs in the battle of life; of a pair of eyes which work the spell; of a Grecian nose; of a mouth remarkable for the elasticity of the lips, that make him a model in the pronunciation of the English language.  His voice, that of a tenor, undulating and clear, never obstreperous, enables his tongue to work the intended charm, when his head puts that member into motion; but the semi-earnestness of his address, his cool sort of John Bull smile, betray that his heart does not go always with his head.  Hence he has many enemies, and yet not one ever dared to substantiate a charge against his character; he has as many friends, but not one friend, because it is his policy ever to keep friendly, with redcoats and gold-lace, at one and the same time as with blueshirts and sou'-westers.  As I cannot possibly mean any thing dishonourable to our old mate, John Basson Humffray, I may here relate what his foes do say of him.  Suppose any given square and the four pegs to be:   C-------D |       | |   W   | |       | B-------E  C., that is, the Camp; E., that is, the Eureka; D., that is, the doodledom of red-tape., and B., that is, blue-shirts.  Let W., that is work, be the central point at C, E, and D, B.  Now:  John is sinking at Eureka with the red cap; and Basson cracks some yabber-yabber at D, that is, getting a sip of Toorak small-beer, as aforesaid.  Again:  when Basson puts on a sou'-wester to go through the main-drift with blue-shirts, then John feels entitled to tramp up to Camp, and there, somewhere not far off, toast on the fourth of July a Doctor Kenworthy; soon after, however, said Johnny bends his way to shake hands with Signor Raffaello, at the old peg Eureka, and helps him to rock the cradle.  Further, to give evidence of his consistency, Humffray himself will express his sorrow to Peter Lalor for his loss of the left arm at the same peg Eureka; and, to atone for past transgressions, he will soon after call in both the prodigal John and yabbering Basson, and with his whole heart and voice, strike up, 'God Save the Queen,' at peg Camp.  As for bottoming his shaft at the central point Work, that's a different thing altogether; and yet it must be admitted that he is 'all there' in his claim, when the hole is bottomed, especially if a drive is to be put in with his quill.  Sum total:--He was, is, and ever will be, John Basson Humffray, Esquire, of Ballaarat; 'Honi soi qui mal y pense', because his friends want him in St. Patrick's Hall.     Chapter XXII.    Strike Off A Medal In Commemoration.   We are on Bakery-hill, though, attention.  Immediate objects of the Reform League.  I.  An immediate change in the management of the goldfields, by disbanding the Commissioners (undoubtedly the unanimous demand, or 'desire'--if the word suit better the well-affected--of all blue-shirts).  Three cheers for Vern! Go it hearty!  Fine fellow!  Legs rather too long!  Never mind.  II.  The total abolition of the diggers' and storekeeper's licence tax. (Ah! ah! prick John Bull at his pounds, shillings and pence, that's the dodge to make him stir.)  Three cheers for Humffray!  Hurrah!  The whole of the grand talk of these Bakery reformers leagued together on its hill, can properly be framed in, on a 'copper;' thus doing justice to all.  Image. LET a course of action be decided on and carried out unswervingly until the heel of our oppressors be removed from our necks. DON'T LET THE THING DROP THROUGH, for want of co-operation and support NOTA BENE. 2s. 6d. gentleman's ticket. No admission for ladies at present.  'Durum sed levius fit Patientia.' REMEMBER! GOD HELPS HIM WHO HELPS HIMSELF (to the 2s. 6d.) DO NOT LET the word 'British' become a bye-word. AND ABOVE ALL LEAVE OFF SINGING 'Britons never, never shall be slaves,' until you leave fondling the chains which prove the song a lie, a mockery, a delusion, a snare. ---- Great works!     Chapter XXIII.    Ortica ensis:  Prima.   Here is a plant of Cayenne pepper, growing in those days on Ballaarat: it withered some three months in limbo, but...oh yes, butt at it again.   'Ballaarat Times', November 18, 1854.  \"THE REFORM LEAGUE.  \"There is something strange, and to the government of this country, something not quite comprehensible, in this League.  For the first time in the southern hemisphere, a Reform League is to be inaugurated. There is something ominous in this; the word 'League,' in a time of such feverish excitement as the present, is big with immense purport (indeed!) Indeed, it would ill become 'The Times' to mince in matter of such weighty importance.  This League is not more or less that the germ of Australian independence (sic).  The die is cast, and fate has stamped upon the movement its indelible signature.  No power on earth can restrain the united might and headlong strides for freedom of the people of this country, and we are lost in amazement while contemplating the dazzling panorama of the Australian future (Great works).  We salute the League [but not the trio, Vern, Kennedy, Humffray], and tender our hopes and prayers for its prosperity [in the shape of a goodly pile of half-crowns].  The League has undertaken a mighty task [the trio'll shirk it though], fit only for a great people--that of changing the dynasty of the country (Great works).  The League does not exactly propose, nor adopt such a scheme, but we know what it means, the principles it would inculcate, and that eventually it will resolve itself into an Australian Congress.\" (Great Works!!)   Vote for HUMFFRAY to be Auctioneer, KENNEDY to be Bellman, VERN to be Runner, of the 'Starring league.'     Chapter XXIV.    Ortica ensis:  Secunda.   Out came the 'Ballaarat Times', Saturday, November 25, 1854.  Work was stopped at every hole:  the miners left the deep and mobbed together round any reader of the full report of the--   Trial of MR. AND MRS. BENTLEY, Hanse, and Farrel, FOR THE MURDER OF JAMES SCOBIE. ---- Supreme Court, Melbourne. ---- GUILTY! of Manslaughter. Mrs. Bentley scot-free.  His Honour considered their conduct was wanton and reckless.  He should mark his sense of the outrage of which they have been found guilty, by passing on each of them a sentence of THREE (!) YEARS' IMPRISONMENT WITH HARD LABOUR ON THE ROADS.  Great Works!   Trial of Fletcher, M`Intyre and Westerby, for BURNING THE EUREKA HOTEL. ---- Supreme Court, Melbourne. Criminal Sittings. ---- GUILTY, with a recommendation to mercy!!  The Foreman of the Jury appended the following rider to the verdict:--  \"The jury feel, in giving their verdict against the prisoners at the bar, that in all probability, they (the jury) should never have had that painful duty to Perform, if those entrusted with the government offices at Ballaarat had done theirs properly.\"  His Honour said:  THE SENTENCE of the Court is, that you, M`Intyre be confined in H.M. gaol, at Melbourne, for THREE MONTHS, but I shall not subject you to labour. (Great works!)  You, Fletcher, to four months; and you, Westerby, to six months confinement... ...The Executive was sufficiently strong to punish those who outrage the law! (Great works at Toorak!)   -------------  La vita in grammatica, Facil declinazione; La vita poi in pratica, Storta congiugazione: Della vita lo spello dal mondo sciolto, Al mondo vivi, poiche non sei sepolto.
