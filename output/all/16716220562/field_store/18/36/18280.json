Stand by to receive a prize crew.\"  Although completely surprised by the dramatic turn of events, both the crew and passengers of the _Nichi Maru_ remained perfectly calm.  The captain, a descendant of the knightly Samurai of Old Japan, was on the point of ordering full speed ahead, with the object of ramming the perfidious vessel and sending both ships to a common destruction; but the knowledge that the safety of nearly a thousand non-combatants, many of them women and children, would be in dire peril through such an act compelled him to submit to the inevitable.  Humanity, not fear, had conquered the courteous and lion-hearted yellow skipper.  Boats were lowered from the German auxiliary cruiser--for such she undoubtedly was.  Into them clambered a number of motley-garbed men armed with rifles and automatic pistols.  But for their modern weapons the boat's crew might have come from the deck of an Eighteenth-Century buccaneering craft.  \"I say, you fellows,\" said O'Hara, \"I'm off below.\"  \"What for?\" asked his companions in surprise.  Not for one moment did they imagine that the Irishman was showing the white feather, but at the same time they were mystified by his announcement.  \"To get into uniform,\" he replied.  \"Those skunks won't find me in mufti.\"  \"Right oh!\" declared Denbigh.  \"We'll slip into ours, too.\"  In a few minutes the chums had changed into their naval uniforms.  By the time they regained the promenade deck the Germans were in possession of the ship.  A fat ober-leutnant, backed up by half a dozen armed seamen, held the bridge, the Japanese captain and deck officers being compelled to retire to the chart-room.  A couple of arrogant unter-leutnants with much sabre-rattling, were herding the European male passengers on the port side of the promenade deck.  The Japanese passengers they drove forward with every insulting expression they could make use of.  It was the German officers' idea of revenge, for the fall of Kiau Chau, where the boasted Teutonic fortress had succumbed to Oriental valour, rankled in the breasts of the subjects of the All-Highest War Lord.  Two German officers, apparently of the Accountant branch, had possessed themselves of the passenger list of the captured vessel, and were proceeding to call the names it contained.  Each person on hearing his name had to step forward.  \"Denbigh, Frank,\" exclaimed one of the officers.  Denbigh, standing erect, faced his captors.  \"Ah!  Englander officer, hein?\" queried the Teuton insolently.  \"Goot!  More to say soon.  Step there over, quick.\"  The Sub obeyed.  He realized that at times even passive resistance was indiscreet.  \"Stirling, Charles,\" continued the German.  \"Ach, yet anoder Englander. Unter-leutnant?  Goot, a goot capture of Englanders we haf.\"  \"I'm a Scot--not an Englishman,\" protested Stirling.  \"No matter.  The one is as bad as odder, if nod worse.  Over dere,\" and he pointed to the place where Denbigh was standing.  \"We're marked down for something, old man,\" whispered Denbigh.  \"Yes, but listen.  They're tackling O'Hara now.\"  Sub-lieutenant O'Hara faced his inquisitor with a broad smile on his face.  The Germans could not understand why a man should look pleasant in time of adversity.  \"Irish?  Ach, goot!\" declared the Teuton.  \"Der Irish not like Englischmans.  When we Germans take London, Ireland free country will be.\"  \"You haven't got to London yet,\" remarked O'Hara with the perplexing smile still on his lips.  \"Already our Zeppelins hab there been.  It is matter of time.  Ach? Brussels, Warsaw, Bukharest, Cettigne--five capitals--all conquered.\"  \"How about Paris?\" enquired O'Hara.  \"To say nothing of Calais.  And who commands the sea?  You Germans haven't a vessel afloat outside your own territorial waters.\"  \"Vot is dis?\" asked the Teuton, pointing to the armed liner.  His voice rose to a crescendo of triumph.  O'Hara was temporarily non-plussed.  Evidently something was at fault somewhere.  How could a large vessel like that evade the strong cordon of British warships?  \"You're at the end of your tether, old sport,\" he said after a brief hesitation.  \"That ship will be at the bottom before another twenty-four hours.\"  \"You tink so?\" almost howled the exasperated German.  \"You vill see. If she sink, den you sink mit her.  Over dere.\"  O'Hara rejoined his chums.  A couple of armed seamen mounted guard over them while the work of investigation and pillage continued.  \"We're marked down as hostages,\" began the Irishman; but one of the seamen, bringing the butt end of his rifle down on the deck within a couple of inches of O'Hara's toes, rendered unnecessary the guttural \"Verboten\" that accompanied the action.  In silence the three Subs watched the proceedings.  Under the orders of their captors the Japanese seamen were compelled to transfer bullion stores from the _Nichi Maru_ into the boats.  German seamen brought charges of explosives and placed them below.  It was apparent that the destruction of the captured vessel was already decided.  At length all preparations were completed.  One of the _Nichi Maru's_ officers, acting under the authority of the ober-leutnant gave the order--first in Japanese and then in English--to abandon the ship.  \"Fifteen minutes only are allowed.  Boats to be provisioned and manned. No personal property is to be taken.  Women and children first.\"  The Japanese captain was expostulating, firmly and in a dignified manner.  He pointed out the inhumanity of sending women and children adrift in mid-Atlantic and under a tropical sun.  His protests were in vain.  \"We will send a small vessel to pick up the boats,\" retorted the German lieutenant.  \"We will not sink a small one purposely.  A little discomfort will do these English good.  You yellow apes are used to it.\"  The Japanese accepted the direct insult without signs of emotion.  The disguise of his feelings was a national trait, but it would have gone hard with the arrogant Prussian had the captain of the _Nichi Maru_ not been hampered with a crowd of non-combatants.  \"Now, Englishmen,\" exclaimed the German.  \"Into that boat.  Any trouble make and you dead men.  Ach!  You smile now: your trouble it only has just commenced.\"     CHAPTER II  The Last of the _Nichi Maru_  In silence the three Subs left the doomed _Nichi Maru_ and entered the waiting boat.  At the word of command the men pushed off and rowed towards the modern pirate.  The disguised vessel had now swung round and was lying motionless at a distance of two cables' length from her prize.  The hull was painted a light yellow, with a broad black band.  Her funnels were buff with black tops.  On her stern were the words, _Zwaan_--Rotterdam.  \"She's no more the _Zwaan_ of Rotterdam than I am,\" cogitated Denbigh.  He was right in his surmise.  The vessel was originally the _Pelikan_--a supplementary Hamburg-Amerika Line boat.  On the outbreak of the war she was homeward bound from South America, with, as was the case with all liners flying the German flag, an armament of quick-firers stowed away in her hold.  Unfortunately for Kaiser Wilhelm's plans the abrupt entry of Great Britain into the arena of war had nipped in the bud the activities of German commerce raiders.  A few ran amok until promptly rounded up and settled by the ubiquitous British cruisers.  Others fled for neutral ports.  Amongst them was the _Pelikan_, whose captain, with considerable astuteness, contrived to make for a harbour belonging to an obscure South American Republic.  Before doing so he had fallen in with the light cruiser _Karlsruhe_--a craft doomed shortly afterwards to end her career at the hands of her own crew rather than face an action that would end either in destruction or ignominious capture--and from her received a number of additional officers and men.  For a twelvemonth or more the _Pelikan_ lay hidden.  Lavish sums expended in bribery sealed the mouths of the grasping officials of the port, in addition to procuring coal and stores to enable the German vessel to put to sea whenever an opportunity offered.  At length the chance came.  Acting under wireless orders from Berlin the _Pelikan_ was to make a dash for the Atlantic, do as much damage as she possibly could to shipping of the Allies, and finally attempt to reach Dar es Salaam, the principal port of German East Africa.  Here, should she succeed in evading the British patrols, she was to transfer her crew, armament, and munitions to shore to assist the land forces of the Colony against a threatened advance from Rhodesia.  Accordingly the _Pelikan_ became the _Zwaan_.  Disguised by a different colour paint and supplied with forged ship's papers she easily evaded the lax authority of the neutral port and made for the open sea.  A course was shaped to cut the Dutch East Indies liners' route in the latitude of Cape Verde.  Then, following in a parallel direction, the track usually taken by the vessels she was impersonating, the pseudo _Zwaan_ headed due south.  Kapitan von Riesser, her commanding officer, was a resourceful and crafty Hun.  He was steeped in the doctrine of \"frightfulness\", but in the present instance there were limits.  Had he been the commander of a U boat he would not have hesitated to send the _Nichi Maru_ to the bottom without warning, for a German submarine could strike a fatal blow and not show herself during the attack.  The _Pelikan_---to revert to her original name--was not capable of emulating the methods of German unterseebooten without risk of subsequent capture.  And as the possibility of being taken by a British warship always loomed upon von Riesser's mental horizon, he was determined to tread warily.  The fear of reprisals alone kept him within the bounds of discretion as laid down by up-to-date rules of warfare.  He might sink any merchant-vessel that fell into his clutches, provided he gave the passengers and crew time to take to their boats.  Three days before sighting the _Nichi Maru_ the _Pelikan_"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36499"],["title","Rounding up the Raider: A Naval Story of the Great War (#2)"],["body","been stopped and examined by a British cruiser.  The boarding-officer knew neither German nor Dutch, and conversation had to be conducted in English.  The ship's papers were apparently in order.  The British lieutenant failed to pay sufficient attention to the bulky deck-gear that concealed the raider's quick-firers; nor did he discover that, hidden between double bulkheads abaft the engine-room, two torpedo-tubes, removed from the _Karlsruhe_, were ready for instant use should occasion arise.  The cruiser had, indeed, a very narrow escape of sharing the fate of a British battleship that was torpedoed in the Channel on a dark and stormy night, the deadly missile being launched from a vessel sailing under the Dutch flag.  Only Kapitan von Riesser's doubts as to the immediate success of a torpedo attack prevented him putting his treacherous design into effect.  A stricken cruiser, he knew, could use her guns with tremendous results, and he had no wish to lay down his life for the Fatherland while an easier course lay open to him. Accordingly the boarding officer, with many apologies for having detained a neutral vessel, returned to the cruiser, which immediately steamed northwards, while the _Pelikan_ proceeded on her course.  Having assumed that the British cruiser was well out of her way, the raider began to send out wireless calls, limiting the radius of action to about fifty miles.  She did not call in vain, for the _Nichi Maru_, picking up the appeal for aid, hastened to the _Pelikan's_ assistance and, all unsuspecting, fell a victim to her captor.  During the \"round-up\" of the passengers, Kapitan von Riesser had been informed by signal of the presence of three British naval officers on board the _Nichi Maru_, and instructions were asked as to their disposal.  The kapitan resolved the problem in his mind.  He could not murder the prisoners without the news being conveyed by the rest of the passengers of the Japanese liner.  If they were brought on board the _Pelikan_, they would be a source of danger should the ship again be overhauled by a patrolling cruiser, unless----  He consulted the ship's surgeon.  Apparently the latter's advice was satisfactory.  In addition, should the _Pelikan_ arrive at Dar es Salaam with three British naval officers on board as prisoners, well and good.  If, on the other hand, the vessel were captured on the high seas, the prisoners would no doubt be willing to testify to the fact that Kapitan von Riesser had committed no unpardonable breach of the usages of war.  From which it will be seen that von Riesser was always considering how to save his own skin in the event of capture.  \"Up--at once!\" ordered the unter-leutnant as the boat containing Denbigh and his companions ran alongside the lowered accommodation-ladder of the _Pelikan_.  The German did not hesitate to show his arrogance; but he was severely snubbed by his kapitan.  \"I must apologize, gentlemen,\" began von Riesser in good English as the British officers came over the side.  \"My subordinate, Herr Klick, has allowed his zeal to outrun his discretion.  It is necessary for me to detain you.  I know you will bow to the inevitable and recognize that it is the fortune of war.  I will speak to you again shortly!\"  The kapitan hurried off, leaving Denbigh and his fellow-prisoners standing close to the head of the accommodation-ladder.  Beyond the fact that a sentry stood within ten feet of them, no attempt was made to place them under restraint.  They were free to speak, and to watch the scene that was being enacted a few hundred yards from the vessel to which they had been removed.  The _Nichi Maru_ was lowering her boats rapidly yet with admirable discipline.  Without accident the heavy lifeboats with their human freights took the water.  As soon as the falls were cast off, the crews rowed to a safe distance, where they lay on their oars and awaited the end of the huge liner.  With some minutes to spare, the work of abandoning the vessel was completed.  The captain was the last to leave, the imperturbable look upon his olive features masking the rage and grief that gripped his mind.  The two German boats still lay alongside.  Presently half a dozen Teutons hurriedly scrambled into the waiting craft, which without delay were rowed quickly toward the _Pelikan_.  Three muffled reports came almost simultaneously from the interior of the doomed liner.  These were followed by two more at comparatively long intervals.  The _Nichi Maru_ heeled slightly, and began to settle slowly by the bows.  The ship took her time.  The wreaths of fleecy steam mingled with denser columns of smoke that issued from 'tween decks.  Then, as the in rushing water came in contact with the furnaces, the vessel was enveloped in a cloud of eddying pungent fumes.  When the cloud dispersed, the _Nichi Maru's_ bows were level with the water, while her stern was raised until the blades of her now motionless propellers were clear of the agitated sea.  Lower and lower sank the doomed ship.  At frequent intervals, small explosions of compressed air took place.  The sea was strewn with fragments of floating wreckage.  \"She's going!\" whispered Stirling.  The liner recovered herself.  For a moment it seemed as if she were floating on an even keel.  Then, with a convulsive effort, she flung her stern high out of the water and slid rapidly to her ocean grave. Almost the last to be seen of her was the mercantile flag of Japan, still floating proudly from the ensign staff.  In the liner's crowded boats the Japanese officers were standing erect and at the salute as the vessel disappeared from view.  They, too, were of a breed that is not to be intimidated by Teutonic frightfulness.     CHAPTER III  On Board the Raider  \"I wish to call attention to the fact, gentlemen, that we acted in strict accordance with the rights of belligerents,\" remarked Kapitan von Riesser.  The _Pelikan's_ captain was seated in his cabin.  On either side of him stood von Langer, the ober-leutnant who had been in charge of the boarding-party, and Unter-leutnant Kaspar Klick.  Facing him stood Denbigh, Stirling, and O'Hara.  \"I am afraid we cannot agree with you,\" replied Denbigh.  \"Possibly not,\" retorted von Riesser, \"but on what grounds?\"  \"It is hardly a humane act to turn those people adrift in open boats,\" continued the Sub.  \"What else could I do?  Surely you would not expect us to receive a thousand people on board this ship?  They will be picked up, without doubt, within a few hours.\"  \"Perhaps,\" declared Denbigh.  \"But there is always a risk.  Your action in sinking that ship is unjustifiable.  I am not here to argue the point, but I will merely state a case in which one of your captains did not think it advisable to go to the lengths you did.  When, in the early part of the war, the _Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse_ compelled the British liners _Galicia_ and _Arlanza_ to heave-to, these ships were subsequently allowed to proceed----\"  \"Yes, but at that time you English were not attempting to starve us out by a blockade,\" interrupted the kapitan excitedly, as men do when cornered in argument.  Denbigh shrugged his shoulders.  He had made his protest and had scored a point.  \"We have done with the past,\" continued von Riesser.  \"My object in sending for you is to explain your position.  You are, of course, prisoners of war.  It is my intention to accord you treatment as your rank demands.  In ordinary circumstances you are at liberty to leave your cabins and come on deck whenever you wish during hours of daylight.  There may be times when it will be necessary for you to be locked in--perhaps taken below.  But, understand: if you attempt to jeopardize the safety of the ship, or to communicate with any passing vessel, or, in short, to behave other than officers on parole----\"  \"But we are not on parole,\" interrupted O'Hara.  \"It matters not,\" declared the kapitan.  \"If I choose to consider that you are equivalent to being on parole that is my affair.  If, then, you break any of the conditions I have mentioned you will be tried by a properly constituted court consisting of officers of the ship, and if found guilty you will be shot.  Is that perfectly clear?\"  The three prisoners signified their assent.  After all, the German's stipulations were reasonable.  Von Riesser turned and conversed for a few minutes with his ober-leutnant.  O'Hara, being ignorant of German, and Stirling having but a slight knowledge of the language, were unable to understand the drift of the conversation.  Denbigh, on the other hand, was a fluent linguist, but he had already decided to keep that knowledge from his captors.  Presently Kapitan von Riesser produced a British Navy List.  Somewhat to the British officers' surprise they noticed that it was dated \"April 1916\", or more than a twelvemonth since the last list had been obtainable by the public.  \"You have qualified as an interpreter, I see,\" remarked von Riesser. \"For what languages?\"  \"Hindustani, Swahili, and Arabic,\" replied Denbigh promptly.  He did not think it necessary to add that German was amongst his qualifications, and he thanked his lucky stars that the recent Navy Lists do not specify the language in which officer-interpreters are expert.  \"You are evidently considered a promising young officer,\" continued the kapitan.  He could not refrain from adding, with a thinly-veiled sneer, \"I am afraid your services will be lost to the English Admiralty for some time to come.\"  \"Perhaps,\" drawled Denbigh, with such well-feigned indifference that von Riesser glanced keenly at the young officer's clear-cut features.  Having subjected Stirling and O'Hara to an examination--in which the Irishman scored more than once by his smart repartees--the prisoners were dismissed.  The first meal on board the raider was served in the cabin allotted them.  Judging by the nature of the repast provisions were neither scarce nor unvaried.  Having finished, they went on deck."]]]
