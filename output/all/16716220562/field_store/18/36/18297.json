Mr. Slidell, an older man, was present and so was Mr. Jamison, of Barnwell, who had presided when secession was carried.  There were more present, some prominent, others destined to become so, and Harry was introduced to them one by one.  He gave his letters to Yancey and retired with young St. Clair to the other end of the room, while the leaders read what had been written from Kentucky.  Harry was learning to become a good observer, and he watched them closely as they read.  He saw a look of pleasure come on the face of every one, and presently Yancey beckoned to him.  \"These are fine assurances,\" said the orator, \"and they have been brought by the worthy son of a worthy father.  Colonel Kenton, Senator Culver and others, have no doubt that Kentucky will go out with us. Now you are a boy, but boys sometimes see and hear more than men, and you are old enough to think; that is, to think in the real sense. Tell us, what is your own opinion?\"  Harry flushed, and paused in embarrassment.  \"Go on,\" said Mr. Yancey, persuasively.  \"I do not know much,\" said Harry slowly, wishing not to speak, but feeling that he was compelled by Mr. Yancey to do so, \"but as far as I have seen, Kentucky is sorely divided.  The people on the other side are perhaps not as strong and influential as ours, but they are more numerous.\"  A shade passed over the face of Yancey, but he quickly recovered his good humor.  \"You have done right to tell us the truth as you see it,\" he said, \"but we need Kentucky badly.  We must have the state and we will get it. Did you hear anything before you left, of one Raymond Bertrand, a South Carolinian?\"  \"He was at my father's house before I came away.  I think it was his intention to go from there to Frankfort with some of our own people, and assist in taking out the state.\"  Yancey smiled.  \"Faithful to his errand,\" he said.  \"Raymond Bertrand is a good lad. He has visions, perhaps, but they are great ones, and he foresees a mighty republic for us extending far south of our present border. But now that you have accomplished your task, what do you mean to do, Mr. Kenton?\"  \"I want to stay here,\" replied Harry eagerly.  \"This is the head and center of all things.  I think my father would wish me to do so. I'll enlist with the South Carolina troops and wait for what happens.\"  \"Even if what happens should be war?\"  \"Most of all if it should be war.  Then I shall be one of those who will be needed most.\"  \"A right and proper spirit,\" said Mr. Jamison, of Barnwell.  \"When we can command such enthusiasm we are unconquerable.  Now, we'll not keep you longer, Mr. Kenton.  This is Christmas Day, and one as young as you are is entitled to a share of the hilarity.  Look after him, St. Clair.\"  Harry went out with young St. Clair, whom he was now calling by his first name, Arthur.  He, too, was staying with Madame Delaunay, who was a distant relative.  Harry ate Christmas dinner that evening with twenty people, many of types new to him.  It made a deep impression upon him then, and one yet greater afterward, because he beheld the spirit of the Old South in its inmost shrine, Charleston.  It seemed to him in later days that he had looked upon it as it passed.  They sat in a great dining-room upon a floor level with the ground. The magnolias and live oaks and the shrubs in the garden moved in the gentle wind.  Fresh crisp air came through the windows, opened partly, and brought with it, as Harry thought, an aroma of flowers blooming in the farther south.  He sat with young St. Clair--the two were already old friends--and Madame Delaunay was at the head of the table, looking more like a great lady who was entertaining her friends than the keeper of an inn.  Madame Delaunay wore a flowing white dress that draped itself in folds, and a lace scarf was thrown about her shoulders.  Her heavy hair, intensely black, was bound with a gold fillet, after a fashion that has returned a half century later.  A single diamond sparkled upon her finger.  She seemed to Harry foreign, handsome, and very distinguished.  About half the people in the room were of French blood, most of whom Harry surmised were descendants of people who had fled from Hayti or Santo Domingo.  One, Hector St. Hilaire, almost sixty, but a major in the militia of South Carolina, soon proved that the boy's surmise was right.  Lemonade and a mild drink called claret-sanger was served to the boys, but the real claret was served to the major, as to the other elders, and the mellowness of Christmas pervaded his spirit.  He drank a toast to Madame Delaunay, and the others drank it with him, standing. Madame Delaunay responded prettily, and, in a few words, she asked protection and good fortune for this South Carolina which they all loved, and which had been a refuge to the ancestors of so many of them. As she sat down she looked up at the wall and Harry's glance followed hers.  It was a long dining-room, and he saw there great portraits in massive gilt frames.  They were of people French in look, handsome, and dressed with great care and elaboration.  The men were in gay coats and knee breeches, silk stockings and buckled shoes.  Small swords were at their sides.  The women were even more gorgeous in velvet or heavy satin, with their hair drawn high upon their heads and powdered. One had a beauty patch upon her cheek.  Major St. Hilaire saw Harry's look as it sped along the wall.  He smiled a little sadly and then, a little cheerfully:  \"Those are the ancestors of Madame Delaunay,\" he said, \"and some, I may mention in passing, are my own, also.  Our gracious hostess and myself are more or less distantly related--less, I fear--but I boast of it, nevertheless, on every possible occasion.  They were great people in a great island, once the richest colony of France, the richest colony in all the world.  All those people whom you see upon the walls were educated in Paris or other cities of France, and they returned to a life upon the magnificent plantations of Hayti.  What has become of that brightness and glory?  Gone like snow under a summer sun.  'Tis nothing but the flower of fancy now.  The free black savage has made a wilderness of Hayti, and our enemies in the North would make the same of South Carolina.\"  A murmur of applause ran around the table.  Major St. Hilaire had spoken with rhetorical effect and a certain undoubted pathos.  Every face flushed, and Harry saw the tears glistening in the eyes of Madame Delaunay who, despite her fifty years, looked very handsome indeed in her white dress, with the glittering gold fillet about her great masses of hair.  The boy was stirred powerfully.  His sensitive spirit responded at once to the fervid atmosphere about him, to the color, the glow, the intensity of a South far warmer than the one he had known.  Their passions were his passions, and having seen the black and savage Hayti of which Major St. Hilaire had drawn such a vivid picture, he shuddered lest South Carolina and other states, too, should fall in the same way to destruction.  \"It can never happen!\" he exclaimed, carried away by impulse.  \"Kentucky and Virginia and the big states of the Upper South will stand beside her and fight with her!\"  The murmur of applause ran around the table again, and Harry, blushing, made himself as small as he could in his chair.  \"Don't regret a good impulse.  Mr. Kenton,\" said a neighbor, a young man named James McDonald--Harry had noticed that Scotch names seemed to be as numerous as French in South Carolina--\"the words that all of us believe to be true leaped from your heart.\"  Harry did not speak again, unless he was addressed directly, but he listened closely, while the others talked of the great crisis that was so obviously approaching.  His interest did not make him neglect the dinner, as he was a strong and hearty youth.  There were sweets for which he did not care much, many vegetables, a great turkey, and venison for which he did care, finishing with an ice and coffee that seemed to him very black and bitter.  It was past eight o'clock when they rose and any lingering doubts that Harry may have felt were swept away.  He was heart and soul with the South Carolinians.  Those people in the far north seemed very cold and hard to him.  They could not possibly understand.  One must be here among the South Carolinians themselves to see and to know.  Harry went to his room, after a polite good-night to all the others. He was not used to long and heavy dinners, and he felt the wish to rest and take the measure of his situation.  He threw back the green blinds and opened the window a little.  Once more the easy wind brought him that odor of the far south, whether reality or fancy he could not say. But he turned to another window and looked toward the north.  Away from the others and away from a subtle persuasiveness that had been in the air, some of his doubts returned.  It would not all be so easy.  What were they doing in the far states beyond the Ohio?  He heard footsteps in the hail and a voice that seemed familiar. He had left his door partly open, and, when he turned, he caught a glimpse of a face that he knew.  It was young Shepard, whom he and Major Talbot had met in Nashville.  Shepard saw Harry also, and saluted him cheerfully.  \"I've just arrived,\" he said, \"and through letters from friends in St. Louis, members of one of the old French families there, I've been lucky enough to secure a room at Madame Delaunay's inn.\"  \"Fortune has been with us both,\" said Harry, somewhat doubtfully, but not knowing what else to say.  \"It certainly has,\" said Shepard, with easy good humor.  \"I'll see you again in the morning and we'll talk of what we've been through, both of us.\"  He walked briskly on and Harry heard his firm"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3657"],["title","Wild Beasts and Their Ways, Reminiscences of Europe, Asia, Africa and America — (#0)"],["body","[Portions of this header are copyright (C) 2001 by Michael S.

Baker F.R.S., F.R.G.S., etc., etc. Volume 1     CHAPTER I  THE RIFLE OF A PAST HALF CENTURY  Forty years ago our troops were armed with a smooth-bore musket, and a small force known as the \"Rifle Brigade\" was the exception to this rule.  The military rifle carried a spherical bullet, and, like all others of the period, it necessitated the use of a mallet to strike the ball, which, being a size larger than the bore, required the blow to force it into the rifling of the barrel in order to catch the grooves.  Sporting rifles were of various sizes, but they were constructed upon a principle generally accepted, that extreme accuracy could only be obtained by burning a very small charge of powder.  The outfit required a small mallet made of hardwood faced with thick buff leather, a powerful loading-rod, a powder-flask, a pouch to contain greased linen or silk patches; another pouch for percussion caps; a third pouch for bullets. In addition to this cumbersome arrangement, a nipple-screw was carried, lest any stoppage might render necessary the extraction of the nipple.  The charge of powder in ordinary use for a No. 16 bore (which carried an ounce spherical ball) was 1 1/2 dram, and the sights were adjusted for a maximum range of 200 yards. Although at this distance considerable accuracy could be attained at the target upon a quiet day, it was difficult to shoot with any precision at an unmeasured range owing to the high trajectory of the bullet. Thus for sporting purposes it was absolutely essential that the hunter should be a first-rate judge of distance in order to adjust the sights as required by the occasion. It was accordingly rare to meet with a good rifle-shot fifty years ago. Rifle-shooting was not the amusement sought by Englishmen, although in Switzerland and Germany it was the ordinary pastime. In those countries the match-rifle was immensely heavy, weighing, in many instances, 16 lbs., although the bullet was exceedingly small.  The idea of non-recoil was paramount as necessary to ensure accuracy.  It will be at once perceived that the rifle was a most inferior weapon, failing through a low velocity, high trajectory, and weakness of penetration.  In 1840, I had already devoted much attention to this subject, and I drew a plan for an experimental rifle to burn a charge of powder so large that it appeared preposterous to the professional opinions of the trade. I was convinced that accuracy could be combined with power, and that no power could be obtained without a corresponding expenditure of powder. Trajectory and force would depend upon velocity; the latter must depend upon the volume of gas generated by explosion.  The rifle was made by Gibbs of Bristol. The weight was 21 lbs., length of barrel 36 inches, weight of spherical belted bullet 3 ounces, of conical bullet 4 ounces, charge of powder 16 drams. The twist was one full turn in the length of barrel. The rifling was an exceedingly deep and broad groove (two grooves), which reduced the difficulty of loading to a minimum, as the projecting belt enabled the bullet to catch the channel instantly, and to descend easily when wrapped in a greased silk patch without the necessity of hammering. The charge of powder was inserted by inverting the rifle and passing up the loading-rod with an ounce measure screwed to the end; this method prevented the powder from adhering to the sides of the barrel, and thus fouling the grooves.  An extraordinary success attended this rifle, which became my colossal companion for many years in wild sports with dangerous game. It will be observed that the powder charge was one-third the weight of the projectile, and not only a tremendous crushing power, but an extraordinary penetration was obtained, never equalled by any rifle that I have since possessed.  This weapon was in advance of the age, as it foreshadowed the modern Express, and the principle was thoroughly established to my own satisfaction, that a sporting rifle to be effective at a long range must burn a heavy charge of powder, but the weight of the weapon should be in due proportion to the strain of the explosion.  When I first visited Ceylon in 1845, there were several renowned sportsmen who counted their slain elephants by many hundreds, but there were no rifles. Ordinary smooth-bore shot-guns were the favourite weapons, loaded invariably with a double charge of powder and a hardened ball. In those days the usual calibre of a gun was No. 14 or 16. A No. 12 was extremely rare. The charge for No. 16 was 2 3/4 drams of fine grain powder, and drams for No. 12. Accordingly, the light guns, or \"fowling-pieces,\" as they were termed, were severely tested by a charge of 6 drams of the strongest powder with a hardened bullet; nevertheless I never heard of any failure.  At a short range the velocity and penetration of an ounce spherical ball, with the heavy powder charge, were immense, but beyond 50 yards the accuracy was imperfect.  I believe I was the first to introduce rifles into Ceylon, which were then regarded by the highest authorities in the island as impractical innovations, too difficult to sight, whereas an ordinary gun could be used with ball more quickly in taking a snap-shot.  The rifles which I had provided were heavy, the 3 ounce already mentioned, 21 lbs., and a long 2 ounce by Blisset, 16 lbs. The latter was a polygroove, the powder charge only 1 1/2 dram when I originally purchased it. It was wonderfully accurate at short ranges with the small charge, which I quickly increased to 6 drams, thereby losing accuracy, but multiplying velocity.  Twelve months' experience with elephants and buffaloes decided me to order a battery of double-barrelled rifles, No. 10, two-grooved, with 6 drams of fine grain powder, and spherical-belted bullets. These were most satisfactory, and they became the starting-point for future experiments.  Shortly before the Crimean War, the musket was abolished, and about 1853 the British army was armed throughout with rifles. The difficulty of a military rifle lay in the rapid fouling of the barrel, which necessitated a bullet too small to expand sufficiently to fill the grooves; this resulted in inaccuracy. Even if the bullet were properly fitted, it became impossible to load when the barrel began to foul after a few discharges.  At that time I submitted a plan to the authorities which simplified the difficulty, and having left the pattern bullet at Woolwich, it quickly appeared with a slight modification as the \"Boxer bullet.\" My plan designed a cone hollowed at the base. The bullet was a size smaller than the bore, which enabled it to slide easily down the barrel when foul. The hollow base fitted upon a cone of boxwood pointed at the insertion, but broad at the base, which was larger than the diameter of the hollow in the bullet. It may be easily understood that although this compound bullet was smaller than the bore of the rifle, a blow with the ramrod after loading would drive the conical bullet upon the larger diameter of the boxwood cone, which, acting like a wedge, would expand the lead, thus immediately secured within the barrel. The expansion when fired drove the boxwood into the centre of the bullet, which of necessity took the rifling.  The Boxer bullet superseded the boxwood plug by the use of a piece of burnt clay, which was less expensive and equally serviceable.  Before breechloaders were invented, we were obliged to fit out a regular battery of four double rifles for such dangerous game as elephants, buffaloes, etc., as the delay in re-loading was most annoying and might lead to fatal accidents.  In hot damp climates it became necessary to fire off and clean the entire battery every evening, lest a miss-fire should be the consequence upon the following morning from the condensation of moisture in the nipple during night. This was not only great trouble and a wasteful expenditure of ammunition, but the noise of so many loud reports just at the hour when wild animals were on the move, alarmed the country. Trustworthy gun-carriers are always difficult to procure, and it was by no means uncommon that in moments of danger, when the spare rifles were required, the gun-bearers had bolted from the scene, and the master was deserted.  The introduction of breechloaders has made shooting a luxury, and has obviated the necessity of a large battery of guns. For military purposes the breechloader has manifold advantages--as the soldier can load while lying down, and keep up a rapid fire from a secure cover. It was remarked during the Crimean War that a large proportion of wounded men were struck in the right arm, which would have been raised above the head when loading the old-fashioned rifle, and was thus prominently exposed.  It is not my intention to enter into the minutiae of military rifles, but I cannot resist the satisfaction with which I regard the triumph of the small-bore which I advocated through the columns of the Times in 1865, at a time when the idea was opposed by nearly all authorities as impracticable, owing to the alleged great drawback of rapid fouling. There can be no doubt that the charge of 70 grains with a small-bore bullet, '303, will have a lower trajectory (higher velocity (equivalent to long range)) than a heavier projectile, '450, with the additional advantage of a minimum recoil.  The earliest in the field of progress was the"]]]
