O. and send George's letter and this one. Good-bye, dear mother.      WALT.   IV  _Washington, Monday morning, Feb. 9, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--I write to enclose you a letter I have just received from George. His corps (Ninth Army) and perhaps one other are to move either to Fort Monroe, or somewhere down there--some say Suffolk. I am in hopes that when they get there, George will still have a sight for a furlough. I have written him I should think four letters since the 27th Jan. (and have sent him Han's letter to you in one). I hope he has got most of them before this. I am afraid the $3 change I sent him is gone. He will write to you as soon as he gets settled wherever they go to. I don't know as it makes any difference in respect to danger, or fighting, from this move. One reason they have to move from the Rappahannock, up there, is that wood is all gone for miles, forage is scarce to get, and I don't know as there is any need of their staying there, for any purpose. In some haste, dearest mother, as I am off to visit for an hour or so, one of my hospitals. Your affectionate son,      WALT.   V  _Office Major Hapgood, cor. 15th & F sts, Washington, Feb. 13, 1863._ DEAR BROTHER[12]--Nothing new; still I thought I would write you a line this morning. The $4, namely $2 from Theo A. Drake and $2 from John D. Martin, enclosed in your letter of the 10th, came safe. They too will please accept the grateful thanks of several poor fellows, in hospital here.  The letter of introduction to Mr. Webster, chief clerk, State department, will be very acceptable. If convenient, I should like Mr. Lane to send it on immediately. I do not so much look for an appointment from Mr. Seward as his backing me from the State of New York. I have seen Preston King this morning for the second time (it is very amusing to hunt for an office--so the thing seems to me just now, even if one don't get it). I have seen Charles Sumner three times--he says ev'ry thing here moves as part of a great machine, and that I must consign myself to the fate of the rest--still [in] an interview I had with him yesterday he talked and acted as though he had life in him, and would exert himself to any reasonable extent for me to get something. Meantime I make about enough to pay my expenses by hacking on the press here, and copying in the paymasters' offices, a couple of hours a day. One thing is favorable here, namely, pay for whatever one does is at a high rate. I have not yet presented my letters to either Seward or Chase--I thought I would get my forces all in a body, and make one concentrated dash, if possible with the personal introduction and presence of some big bug. I like fat old Preston King very much--he is fat as a hogshead, with great hanging chops. The first thing he said to me the other day in the parlor chambers of the Senate, when I sent in for him and he came out, was, \"Why, how can I do this thing, or any thing for you--how do I know but you are a Secessionist? You look for all the world like an old Southern planter--a regular Carolina or Virginia planter.\" I treated him with just as much hauteur as he did me with bluntness--this was the first time--it afterward proved that Charles Sumner had not prepared the way for me, as I supposed, or rather not so strongly as I supposed, and Mr. King had even forgotten it--so I was an entire stranger. But the same day C. S. talked further with Mr. King in the Senate, and the second interview I had with the latter (this forenoon) he has given me a sort of general letter, endorsing me from New York--one envelope is addressed to Secretary Chase, and another to Gen. Meigs, head Quartermaster's dept. Meantime, I am getting better and better acquainted with office-hunting wisdom and Washington peculiarities generally. I spent several hours in the Capitol the other day. The incredible gorgeousness of some of the rooms, (interior decorations, etc.)--rooms used perhaps but for merely three or four committee meetings in the course of the whole year--is beyond one's flightiest dreams. Costly frescoes of the style of Taylor's saloon in Broadway, only really the best and choicest of their sort, done by imported French and Italian artists, are the prevailing sorts. (Imagine the work you see on the fine china vases in Tiffany's, the paintings of Cupids and goddesses, etc., spread recklessly over the arched ceiling and broad panels of a big room--the whole floor underneath paved with tesselated pavement, which is a sort of cross between marble and china, with little figures, drab, blue, cream color, etc.) These things, with heavy elaborately wrought balustrades, columns, and steps--all of the most beautiful marbles I ever saw, some white as milk, other of all colors, green, spotted, lined, or of our old chocolate color--all these marbles used as freely as if they were common blue flags--with rich door-frames and window-casings of bronze and gold--heavy chandeliers and mantles, and clocks in every room--and indeed by far the richest and gayest, and most un-American and inappropriate ornamenting and finest interior workmanship I ever conceived possible, spread in profusion through scores, hundreds, (and almost thousands) of rooms--such are what I find, or rather would find to interest me, if I devoted time to it. But a few of the rooms are enough for me--the style is without grandeur, and without simplicity. These days, the state our country is in, and especially filled as I am from top to toe of late with scenes and thoughts of the hospitals, (America seems to me now, though only in her youth, but brought already here, feeble, bandaged, and bloody in hospital)--these days I say, Jeff, all the poppy-show goddesses, and all the pretty blue and gold in which the interior Capitol is got up, seem to me out of place beyond anything I could tell--and I get away from it as quick as I can when that kind of thought comes over me. I suppose it is to be described throughout--those interiors--as all of them got up in the French style--well, enough for a New York.   VI  _Washington, March 31, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--I have not heard from George, except a note he wrote me a couple of days after he got back from his furlough. I think it likely the regiment has gone with its corps to the West, the Kentucky or Tennessee region--Burnside at last accounts was in Cincinnati. Well, it will be a change for George, if he is out there. I sent a long letter to Han last Saturday--enclosed George's note to me. Mother, when you or Jeff writes again, tell me if my papers and MSS. are all right; I should be very sorry indeed if they got scattered, or used up or anything--especially the copy of \"Leaves of Grass\" covered in blue paper,[13] and the little MS. book \"Drum-Taps,\" and the MS. tied up in the square, spotted (stone-paper) loose covers--I want them all carefully kept.  Mother, it is quite a snow-storm here this morning--the ground is an inch and a half deep with snow--and it is snowing and drizzling--but I feel very independent in my stout army-boots; I go anywhere. I _have_ felt quite well of my deafness and cold in my head for four days or so, but it is back again bad as ever this morning.  Dear mother, I wrote the above in my room--I have now come down to Major Hapgood's office. I do not find anything from home, and no particular news in the paper this morning--no news about the Ninth Army Corps, or where they are. I find a good letter from one of my New York boys, (Fifth avenue) a young fellow named Hugo Fritsch, son of the Austrian Consul-General--he writes me a long, first-rate letter this morning. He too speaks about the Opera--like Jeff he goes there a good deal--says that Medori, the soprano, as Norma made the greatest success ever seen--says that the whole company there now, the singers, are very fine. All this I write for Jeff and Mat--I hope they will go once in a while when it is convenient.  It is a most disagreeable day here, mother, walking poshy and a rain and drizzle.  There is nothing new with me, no particular sight for an office that I can count on. But I can make enough with the papers, for the present necessities. I hear that the paymaster, Major Yard, that pays the 51st, has gone on West, I suppose to Cincinnati, or wherever the brigade has gone--of course to pay up--he pays up to 1st of March--all the Army is going to be paid up to 1st March everywhere.  Mother, I hope you are well and hearty as usual. I am so glad you are none of you going to move. I would like to have the pleasure of Miss Mannahatta Whitman's company, the first fine forenoon, if it were possible; I think we might have first-rate times, for one day at any rate. I hope she will not forget her Uncle Walt. I received a note from Probasco, requesting me not to put his name in my next letter. I appreciate his motive, and wish to please him always--but in this matter I shall do what I think appropriate. Mother, I see some very interesting persons here--a young master's mate, who was on the Hatteras, when surprised and broadsided by the Alabama, Capt Semmes--he gave me a very good acc't of it all--then Capt. Mullen, U. S. Army, (engineer) who has been six years out in the Rocky mts. making a Gov't road 650 miles from Ft. Benton to Walla Walla--very, very interesting to know such men intimately, and talk freely with them. Dearest mother, I shall have great yarns to spin, when I come home. I am not a bit homesick, yet I should like to see you and Mat very, very much--one thinks of the women when he is away.      WALT.  Shall send the shirts in a day or two.   VII  _Washington, Wednesday forenoon, April 15, 1863._ DEAREST MOTHER--Jeff's letter of the 11th, acknowledging the books, also the one about five days previous, containing the $10 from Van Anden, came safe. Jeff's letters are always first rate and welcome--the good long one with so much about home, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35744"],["title","The gradual acceptance of the Copernican theory of the universe (#0)"],["body","http://www.archive.org/details/gradualacceptan00stim)          [Transcriber's Note: Obvious printer errors have been corrected without note.

Bologna, 1651.)]   EXPLANATION  \"Astrea, goddess of the heaven, wearing angel's wings and gleaming everywhere with stars, stands at the right; on the left is Argus of the hundred eyes, not tense, but indicating by the position of the telescope at his knee rather than at the eyes in his head, that while observing the work of God's hand, he appears at the same time to be worshipping as in genuflexion.\" (Riccioli: _Alm. Nov._, _Præfatio_, xvii). He points to the cherubs in the heavens who hold the planets, each with its zodiacal sign: above him at the top is Mars, then Mercury in its crescent form, the Sun, and Venus also in the crescent phase; on the opposite side are Saturn in its \"tripartite\" form (the ring explanation was yet to be given), the sphere of Jupiter encircled by its four satellites, the crescent Moon, its imperfections clearly shown, and a comet. Thus Father Riccioli summarized the astronomical knowledge of his day. The scrolls quote Psalms 19:2, \"Day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night showeth knowledge.\"  Astrea holds in her right hand a balance in which Riccioli's theory of the universe (an adaptation of the Tychonic, see p. 68) far outweighs the Copernican or heliocentric one. At her feet is the Ptolemaic sphere, while Ptolemy himself half lies, half sits, between her and Argus, with the comment issuing from his mouth: \"I will arise if only I am corrected.\" His left hand rests upon the coat of arms of the Prince of Monaco to whom the _Almagestum Novum_ is dedicated.  At the top is the Hebrew _Yah-Veh_, and the hand of God is stretched forth in reference to the verse in the Book of Wisdom (10:20): \"But thou hast ordered all things in measure, and number and weight.\"     CONTENTS     ILLUSTRATIONS                                                      7    PREFACE                                                            8     PART I.

The opening chapter is intended to do no more than to review briefly the astronomical theories up to the age of Copernicus, in order to provide a background for the better comprehension of the work of Copernicus and its effects.  Such a study has been rendered possible only by the generous loan of rare books by Professor Herbert D. Foster of Dartmouth College, Professor Edwin E. Slosson of Columbia University, Doctor George A. Plimpton and Major George Haven Putnam, both of New York, and especially by the kindly generosity of Professor David Eugene Smith of Teachers College who placed his unique collection of rare mathematical books at the writer's disposal and gave her many valuable suggestions as to available material. Professors James T. Shotwell and Harold Jacoby of Columbia University have read parts of this study in manuscript. The writer gratefully acknowledges her indebtedness not only to these gentlemen, but to the many others, librarians and their assistants, fellow-students and friends, too numerous to mention individually, whose ready interest and whose suggestions have been of real service, and above all to Professor James Harvey Robinson at whose suggestion and under whose guidance the work was undertaken, and to the Reverend Doctor Henry A. Stimson whose advice and criticism have been an unfailing source of help and encouragement.     PART ONE  AN HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE HELIOCENTRIC THEORY OF THE UNIVERSE.     CHAPTER I.  THE DEVELOPMENT OF ASTRONOMICAL THOUGHT TO 1400 A.D.  _A Preliminary Sketch of Early Theories as a Background._   The appearances in the heavens have from earliest historic ages filled men with wonder and awe; then they gradually became a source of questioning, and thinkers sought for explanations of the daily and nightly phenomena of sun, moon and stars. Scientific astronomy, however, was an impossibility until an exact system of chronology was devised.[1] Meanwhile men puzzled over the shape of the earth, its position in the universe, what the stars were and why the positions of some shifted, and what those fiery comets were that now and again appeared and struck terror to their hearts.  [Footnote 1: The earliest observation Ptolemy uses is an Egyptian one of an eclipse occurring March 21, 721 B.C. (Cumont: 7). [In these references, the Roman numerals refer to the volume, the Arabic to the page, except as stated otherwise. The full title is given in the bibliography at the back under the author's name.]]  In answer to such questions, the Chaldean thinkers, slightly before the rise of the Greek schools of philosophy, developed the idea of the seven heavens in their crystalline spheres encircling the earth as their center.[2] This conception seems to lie back of both the later Egyptian and Hebraic cosmologies, as well as of the Ptolemaic. Through the visits of Greek philosophers to Egyptian shores this conception helped to shape Greek thought and so indirectly affected western civilization. Thus our heritage in astronomical thought, as in many other lines, comes from the Greeks and the Romans reaching Europe (in part through Arabia and Spain), where it was shaped by the influence of the schools down to the close of the Middle Ages when men began anew to withstand authority in behalf of observation and were not afraid to follow whither their reason led them.  [Footnote 2: Warren: 40. See \"Calendar\" in Hastings: _Ency. of Religion and Ethics_.]  But not all Greek philosophers, it seems,[3] either knew or accepted the Babylonian cosmology.[4] According to Plutarch, though Thales (640?-546? B.C.) and later the Stoics believed the earth to be spherical in form, Anaximander (610-546? B.C.) thought it to be like a \"smooth stony pillar,\" Anaximenes (6th cent.) like a \"table.\" Beginning with the followers of Thales or perhaps Parmenides (?-500 B.C.), as Diogenes Laërtius claims,[5] a long line of Greek thinkers including Plato (428?-347? B.C.) and Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) placed the earth in the center of the universe. Whether Plato held that the earth \"encircled\" or \"clung\" around the axis is a disputed point;[6] but Aristotle claimed it was the fixed and immovable center around which swung the spherical universe with its heaven of fixed stars and its seven concentric circles of the planets kept in their places by their transparent crystalline spheres.[7]  [Footnote 3: For a summary of recent researches, see the preface of Heath: _Aristarchus of Samos_. For further details, see Heath: _Op. cit._, and the writings of Kugler and Schiaparelli.]  [Footnote 4: See Plutarch: _Moralia: De placitas Philosophorum_, Lib. I et II, (V. 264-277, 296-316).]  [Footnote 5: Diogenes Laërtius: _De Vitis_, Lib. IX, c. 3 (252).]  [Footnote 6: Plato: _Timæus_, sec. 39 (III, 459 in Jowett's translation).]  [Footnote 7: Aristotle: _De Mundo_, c. 2 et 6 (III, 628 and 636).]  The stars were an even greater problem. Anaximenes thought they were \"fastened like nails\" in a crystalline firmament, and others thought them to be \"fiery plates of gold resembling pictures.\"[8] But if the heavens were solid, how could"]]]
