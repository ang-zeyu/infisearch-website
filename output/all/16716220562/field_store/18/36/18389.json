And has no accident happened to him on the way? You are surprised, perhaps, at my anxiety; but by-and-bye you will understand it without difficulty, when I have explained to you how terribly interested I am in the fact of his journey being safely accomplished.  Just imagine that at this moment I have only 200 fr. in my purse (a ridiculously small sum for a traveler), and that it is M. Pavy who is to be my financial Providence, considering that it is to him that my mother has confided my little quarterly income of a thousand francs. Now at this point I must entrust you with a little secret, which at present is only known to two individuals, Messrs. Paccard and Roger (charming names for confidants, are not they?), and which I beg you to make known as quickly as possible to your brother. It concerns a little scrap of paper (which these rogues of bankers call a draft, I believe), for a thousand francs, by which Messrs. Paccard and Roger are authorized by my signature, which is at the bottom, to demand the above sum of a thousand francs (which my mother entrusted to M. Pavy in Paris) from M. Pavy, junior, living at La Glaciere at Lyons, after the 22nd of August, 1836.  A thousand pardons for troubling you with these details, but I should never have had the courage to write direct to your brother, on account of my profound ignorance in money matters.  You tell me that you passed part of the fine season in the country--why did not you arrange so as to tour for a little among the mountains of Switzerland? I should have had such pleasure in doing the honors, and Mademoiselle Merienne also...but don't let us speak any more of Mademoiselle Merienne (who, be it observed in parenthesis, must have already appeared a dozen times in this letter), for fear of again falling into inextricable parentheses.  Au revoir then; in five weeks at latest I shall come and warm myself at your \"glacier.\"  F. Liszt    11. To Abbe de Lamennais  [Autograph in the possession of M. Alfred Bovet at Valentigney.]  My friend Louis de Ronchaud writes me word that he has had the honor of seeing you, dear Father, and that you were kind enough to give him a message of affectionate remembrance for me. I am very happy to know that you continue to keep this precious and friendly feeling for me, of which you have already given me so many proofs, and which I shall endeavour always to deserve as far as is in my power.  I am still not very far advanced in my Italian journey. The beauty of these parts, the necessity of writing with some little continuance, and also, if all be said, some altogether unexpected successes, have kept me in Milan and the neighborhood (Como and the delicious shores of the lake) much longer than I had foreseen. As regards musical matters, the presence of Rossini, whom I frequently see, gives a certain impetus to this country. I have been singularly well received here, so I shall probably pass the greater part of the winter here, and shall not start for Venice till towards the beginning of March. Thence I shall go to Florence and Rome, where I expect I shall stay a good long time.  D. has no doubt talked to you of our stay at Nohant last summer. I think that he got rid there of a good many old prejudices about me. It was a sweet satisfaction to me to learn through him how good and indulgent you have been towards me on several occasions, even so far as to contradict and defend me warmly against him and against others who knew me still less. I had charged our secret friend to defend me in his turn from a slight wrong which I had, only apparently, committed, but even \"apparently\" is too much, and I think I have entirely justified myself with regard to it. I don't know whether in his noble carelessness he will have thought of it. However that may be, I shall always count on your paternal affection more than all the rest.  What can I say to you of Italy that you do not know, and that you have not said in such manner as to cause despair for ever to the makers of observations!--It is always the same status quo, the excellent and perfectly happy government that you know.--I am hoping and longing ardently for your next book [probably \"Le Livre du Peuple\": Paris, 1837], which I shall read with my whole heart and soul, as I have read all that you have written for four years. I shall owe you just so many more good and noble emotions. Will they remain for ever sterile? Will my life be for ever tainted with this idle uselessness which weighs upon me? Will the hour of devotion and of manly action never come? Am I condemned without respite to this trade of a Merry Andrew and to amuse in drawing-rooms?  Whatever may be my poor and humble destiny, do not ever doubt my heart. Do not ever doubt the deep respect and unalterable devotion with which you have inspired me.  Yours for ever,  F. Liszt  Como, December 18th, 1837    12. To Breitkopf and Hartel in Leipzig  [Autograph in the possession of Herr Hermann Scholtz, Kammervirtuoso in Dresden.]  I thank you much, gentlemen, for the obliging letter that you have written me. Up to the present time I have had none but the most pleasant business relations with Mr. Hofmeister, who has the kindness to publish the greater part of my works in Germany. As I do not know very much of the laws which regulate literary and musical proprietorship in Saxony, I had spoken to him about the Beethoven Symphonies, of which I have undertaken the arrangement, or, more correctly speaking, the pianoforte score. To tell the truth, this work has, nevertheless, cost me some trouble; whether I am right or wrong, I think it sufficiently different from, not to say superior to, those of the same kind which have hitherto appeared. The recent publication of the same Symphonies, arranged by Mr. Kalkbrenner, makes me anxious that mine should not remain any longer in a portfolio. I intend also to finger them carefully, which, in addition to the indication of the different instruments (which is important in this kind of work), will most certainly make this edition much more complete. If, then, as I imagine, it is impossible for Mr. Hofmeister to publish them, I shall be very grateful if you will undertake it. The reputation of your house is European, and I perfectly remember having had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Raymond Hartel in Paris. It will be a pleasure to me to conclude this little business with you, at the rate of eight francs a page. Up to the present time I have only finished three Symphonies (that in A major), but I could promise to let you have the others successively, according as you might wish, or I could limit my work to the four most important Symphonies (if I may express my opinion), namely, the Pastoral, C minor, A major, and the Eroica. I think those are the ones which are most effective on the piano.  I start tomorrow for Vienna, where I expect to remain till the end of April. Please address to me to the care of Mr. Tobias Haslinger till the 25th of April, and after that to Mr. Ricordi, Milan, who has undertaken to forward me all my letters while I am in Italy. My compliments and affectionate thanks.  F. Liszt    13. To Robert Schumann  [Addressed to the celebrated German Tone-poet (1810-1856). Liszt had spoken of Schumann's Op. 5, 11, and 14 in the Gazette Musicale, 1837, with equal enthusiasm and understanding, which soon brought the two together.]  [Without a date; received by R. S. May 5th, 1838.]  My dear Monsieur Schumann,  I shall not attempt to tell you how grateful and touched I am by your friendly letter. Mademoiselle Wieck, whom I have been so happy as to meet here, will express to you, better than I can, all the sympathy, all the admiring affection I have for you. I have been such a nomad latterly that the pieces you were kind enough to address to me at Milan only reached me on the eve of my departure from Venice about a fortnight ago; and since then we have been talking so much of you, day and night, that it hardly occurred to me to write to you. Today, however, to my great astonishment, I get a fresh token of your friendly remembrance, and I certainly will not delay thanking you many times for it, so I have just left a charming party of very pretty women in order to write these few lines to you. But the truth is you need hardly thank me for this little sacrifice, for it is a great pleasure to me to be able to have a little chat with you.  The \"Carneval\" and the \"Fantasiestucke\" have interested me excessively. I play them really with delight, and God knows that I can't say as much of many things. To speak frankly and freely, it is absolutely only Chopin's compositions and yours that have a powerful interest for me.  The rest do not deserve the honor of being mentioned...at least, with a few exceptions,--to be conciliatory, like Eusebius.  In six weeks to two months I shall send you my twelve Studies and a half-dozen of \"Fantasiestucke\" (\"Impressions et Poemes\")--I consider them less bad than others of my making. I shall be happy to think that they do not displease you.  May I confess to you that I was not very much struck with Henselt's Studies, and that I found them not up to their reputation? I don't know whether you share my opinion, but they appear to me, on the whole, very careless. They are pretty to listen to, they are very pretty to look at, the effect is excellent, the edition (thanks to our friend Hofmeister) is most carefully done; but, all counted, I question whether H. is anything but a distinguished mediocrity. [How highly Liszt thought, later on, of Henselt's Concerto and other of his compositions is well known, and is spoken of in a subsequent letter to Baroness Wrangel, in May, 1883.] For the rest, he is very young, and will doubtless develop. Let us, at least, hope so.  I am extremely sorry that I cannot come and pay you a little visit at Leipzig at present. It is one of my keenest desires to make your personal acquaintance and to pass some"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3689"],["title","Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 1 (#5)"],["body","with you. But as that is not possible now, let us, at least, try not to be entirely separated, and let us combat, as far as we can, the laziness about writing, which is, I think, equally in us both.  In a fortnight I am returning to Venice. I shall be back in Milan at the time of the coronation (towards the end of August). Next winter I expect to pass in Rome, if the cholera or some other plague does not stop it. I will not induce you to come to Italy. Your sympathies would be too deeply wounded there. If they have even heard that Beethoven and Weber ever existed, it is as much as they have done.  Will you not have what you have sent me printed? Haslinger would have it gladly, I think, and it would be a great pleasure to me to see my name associated with yours.  If I might make a request, I would ask you to write some trios, or a quintet or septet. It seems to me that you would do that admirably, and for a long time nothing remarkable in that line has been published. If ever you determine to do so, let me know at once, as I should be anxious to have the honor of making them known to the public. Adieu, my dear Monsieur Schumann; keep me always in affectionate remembrance, and accept once more my warm sympathy and devotion.  F. Liszt    14. To the \"Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde\" in Vienna  [Society of Musical Dilettanti, or Amateur Musical Society. Autograph in the Archives of the Society in Vienna]  Gentlemen,  I am extremely grateful for the honor you have done me in admitting me among you as a member of the Vienna Musik-Verein [Musical Union]. I cannot, unfortunately, flatter myself that I have as yet deserved this distinction, but allow me to say that it will not be my fault if I do not become worthy of it.  If ever the occasion should offer in which I can be agreeable or useful to the Society of the Musik-Verein, be assured that I shall gladly avail myself of it, and that you will henceforth have a claim on my gratitude and devotion.  I have the honor to be, gentlemen,  Yours faithfully,  F. Liszt  Venice, June 1st, 1838    15. To Simon Lowy in Vienna  [Autograph in the possession of Herr O. A. Schulz, bookseller in Leipzig.--Addressed to a Vienna banker, an intimate friend of Liszt The \"Soirees de Vienne,\" composed on Schubert Valses, are dedicated to him.]  I am very sensible, my dear sir, of your friendly remembrance. Your kind letter found me in the midst of the official hurly- burly of the coronation fetes. What business on earth had I to do with such an affair? I have not the least idea. Thank Heaven we are now at the end of it all, safe and sound, rejoicing, and sated with amusement!  I found at Milan a certain number of my Vienna connections. One or two of the persons whom you will not mention to me (and whose anonymity I respect) were also there. I know that a great many of the people who approach me with a smile on their lips, and protestations of friendship on their tongues, have nothing better to do than to pull me to pieces as best they can as soon as they are outside my door. It is, moreover, the fate of all the world. I resign myself to it willingly, as I do to all the absurd and odious necessities of this lower world. There is, besides, just this much good in these sad experiences of various relations with men--which is, that one learns to relish and appreciate better the devotion of the few friends whom chance has thrown in your path.  In a few days from now I shall start for Bologna, Florence, and Rome. In spite of all my desire to return to Vienna, where people have been so kind and indulgent to me, I do not yet see when I shall be able to get there. However this journey may be put off, I hope, nevertheless, my dear sir, that you will continue till then the affectionate feelings you so kindly entertain towards me. Receive in return my assurances of consideration and affectionate devotion.  F. Liszt  Milan, September 22nd, 1838  Will you be so good as to give the enclosed note to the charming woman who is good enough to remember me so kindly?    16. To M. Pacini, Music Publisher in Paris  [Autograph in the possession of M. Alfred Bovet at Valentigney.]  My Dear Monsieur Pacini,  In two or three days at latest from now you will receive the manuscript for which you asked me for the book of the Hundred and One. [A collective work with contributions by celebrities of the day.] Mr. Hugot has kindly undertaken to bring it to you.  As the title implies, it is an Etude (di Bravura) after Paganini. [Bravura Studies on Paganini's Capricci, arranged for the pianoforte, brought out by Haslinger, Vienna, in 1839. A second, newly arranged edition, dedicated to Clara Schumann, \"Grandes Etudes de Paganini,\" was brought out by Breitkopf and Hartel in 1851.] You will oblige me by recommending the engraver to engrave it very spaciously. In addition, you had better, I think, reprint directly afterwards this Etude facilitee, which I have also sent you. This second arrangement is by M. Schumann, a young composer of very great merit. It is more within the reach of the general public, and also more exact than my paraphrase.  Many apologies for having kept you waiting so long for such a small thing, and kind remembrances to Emilien.  Yours affectionately,  F. Liszt  Please send the corrected proofs of this study to Haslinger, musical editor to the Court, at Graben, Vienna.  I must have at least two corrected proofs. Prego! Prego!! [I beg!] leave only such mistakes as are absolutely necessary in order that an edition may be supposed to be correct.  Padua, September 30th, 1838    17. To Breitkopf and Hartel.  [This is the first of the Liszt letters extant in the archives of the firm.]  I am really grieved, gentlemen, at the trouble you have been good enough to take about these unlucky Symphonies, and I hardly know how to express my acknowledgments. As I have already had the honor of telling you, Mr. Mori had been previously engaged to publish these Symphonies, and, as the steps you have taken have not been crowned with success, I will keep to this first publisher, with whom I have every reason to be satisfied up to now.  You can then publish this work in two or three months from now. [Pianoforte scores of the C minor and Pastoral Symphonies of Beethoven.] Only it is essential that I should correct the last proof, so that the edition may be absolutely correct. I also wish to add the fingering to several passages, to make them easier for amateurs. Be so good, therefore, as to send me, through the Embassy (or by any other opportunity which is not too expensive), two proofs to Rome, where I shall be in about twelve days, and where I expect to remain till the middle of March.  I hope, gentlemen, that you will not have cause to regret the obliging advances that you have made to me in this matter, and for which I am sincerely grateful to you. If you will be so good as to add to the proofs of the Beethoven Symphonies such of the songs of Beethoven (or Weber) as you would like me to transcribe for piano solo, I will then give you a positive answer as to that little work, which I shall be delighted to do for you, but to which I cannot assent beforehand, not knowing of which songs you are the proprietors. If \"Leyer und Schwert\" was published by you, I will do that with pleasure. I think that these songs, or at any rate four or five of them, would be rather satisfactory for the piano.  Accept, gentlemen, the expression of my high esteem.  F. Liszt  Florence, January 3rd, 1839    18. To Princess Christine Belgiojoso in Paris  [Autograph in the possession of M. Alfred Bovet at Valentigney.-- Addressed to the celebrated writer and patriot. In 1837 a charity concert took place in her salons, at which Liszt and Thalberg both played.]  It would be self-conceit in me, Princess, to complain of your silence. Your letters have always been for me a favor, a charm. I am not meaning to say that I have the slightest right to them. Nevertheless, as you do not reply to me any more, I hope you will at least permit me to tell you how very much I feel the very slightest marks of your kindness, and what a price I set upon your remembrance.  Some numbers of the Gazette or Revue Musicale, which have accidentally fallen into my hands at the house of one of my Russian friends (for in this happy country of the Arts, and of music in particular, you can well imagine that no one is foolish enough to spend a thirty francs' subscription on the Revue Musicale), have informed me that you had decidedly raised altar for altar, and made your charming salon echo with magnificent harmonies. I confess that this is perhaps the one regret of my winter. I should so immensely have liked to be there to admire you, to applaud you. Several people who had the honor of being present at these choice evenings have spoken to me about them with enthusiasm.  What a contrast to the tiresome musical soliloquies (I do not know what other name to give to this invention of mine) with which I contrived to gratify the Romans, and which I am quite capable of importing to Paris, so unbounded does my impudence become! Imagine that, wearied with warfare, not being able to compose a programme which would have common sense, I have ventured to give a series of concerts all by myself, affecting the Louis XIV. style, and saying cavalierly to the public, \"The concert is--myself.\" For the curiosity of the thing I copy one of the programmes of the soliloquies for you:--  1. Overture to William Tell, performed by M. L.  2. Reminiscences of the Puritani. Fantaisie composed and performed by the above-mentioned!  3. Etudes and fragments by the same to the same!  4. Improvisation on themes given--still by the same. And that was all; neither more nor less, except lively conversation during the intervals, and enthusiasm if there was room for it.  A propos of enthusiasm, I ought at least to talk to you of St. Peter's. That is the proper thing to do when one writes from Rome. But, in the first place, "]]]
