American miners who have written to the Department of State asking protection for their Klondyke claims have no reason to worry; and, in fact, it maybe surmised that their anxieties, rather than any indications given by the Ottawa Government, are the source of the absurd rumor of exclusion.     DAWSON NOT A TOUGH TOWN.  THE CIVILIZATION OF A MINING CAMP.   Ladue, who is a veteran prospector, and has seen all the tough mining camps on the Pacific coast, gives this interesting description of the new city of Dawson, which promises to have 30,000 inhabitants before Spring:  \"It may be said with absolute truth that Dawson City is one of the most moral towns of its kind in the world. There is little or no quarreling and no brawls of any kind, though there is considerable drinking and gambling. Every man carries a pistol if he wishes to, yet it is a rare occurrence when one is displayed. The principal sport with mining men is found around the gambling table. There they gather after nightfall, and play until the late hours in the morning. They have some big games, too. It sometimes costs as much as $50 to draw a card. A game with $2,000 as stakes is an ordinary event. But with all of that there has not been decided trouble. If a man is fussy and quarrelsome he is quietly told to get out of the game, and that is the end of it.  \"Many people have an idea that Dawson City is completely isolated and can communicate with the outside world only once in every twelve months. That is a big mistake, however. Circle City, only a few miles away, has a mail once each month, and there we have our mail addressed. It is true the cost is pretty high, $1 a letter and two for a paper; yet by that expenditure of money we are able to keep in direct communication with our friends on the outside.  \"In the way of public institutions our camp is at present without any, but by next season we will have a church, a music hall, a schoolhouse and a hospital. The last institution will be under direct control of the Sisters of Mercy, who have already been stationed for a long time at Circle City and Forty-Mile Camp.  \"Nearly a score of children were in Dawson City when I left, so I donated a lot and $100 for a school. No one can buy anything on credit in Dawson. It is spot cash for every one, and payment is always gold dust. Very few have any regular money.\"  All experts estimate that the minimum supply of provisions which a man should take to Klondyke is 1,000 pounds, though several say they wouldn't venture in without at least one ton, as the season over the Juneau route closes up by September 15. The rush promises to be unprecedented, and a large number of prospectors, after being landed at Juneau, will find it impossible to get their supplies transported. Like all other great mining rushes, this promises to be full of disappointments.  A new route to the Klondyke will be opened next spring. It is overland from Juneau to Fort Selkirk, on the Yukon, and is entirely by land. Captain Goodall, of the Pacific Coast Steamship Company, inspected it this Summer, and reported it practicable. It is about 700 miles long, and it crosses the divide over Chilkat Pass, which is lower and more easily crossed than the Chilkoot Pass. No lakes or rivers are on the route, but the trail runs over a high level prairie. Old Pioneer Dalton, after whom the trail is named, is now driving a band of sheep on the trail to Dawson City, where he expects to arrive in August, with fresh meat for the miners. This Dalton trail is well adapted for driving stock, but for men the tramp is too long.  \"Dawson is not like most of the mining camps. It is not a 'tough' town. Murders are almost unknown.  \"The miners are a quiet and peaceable kind of men, who have gone there to work, and are willing that everybody else shall have an equal chance with themselves. A great deal of gambling is done in the town, but serious quarrels are an exception. As a gambling town I think it is equal to any that I have ever seen; and this, by the way, is always the test of a mining camp's prosperity. Stud poker is the usual game. They play $100 and oftentimes $200 or $500 on the third card.\"  L. B. Roads said: \"I am located on claim 21, above the discovery on Bonanza Creek. I did exceedingly well up there. I was among the fortunate ones, as I cleared about $40,000, but brought only $5,000 with me. I was the first man to get to bed rock gravel and to discover that it was lined with gold dust and nuggets. The rock was seamed and cut in V-shaped streaks, caused, it is supposed by glacial action. In those seams I found a clay that was exceedingly rich. In fact, there was a stratum of pay gravel four feet thick upon the rock, which was lined with gold, particularly in these channels or streaks. The rock was about sixteen feet from the surface. The discovery made the camp. It was made on October 23, 1896, and as soon as the news spread everybody rushed to the diggings from Circle City, Forty-Mile, and from every other camp in the district.  \"Some of the saloons here take in $300 per day in dust and nuggets. Beer is fifty cents per drink. I have quit drinking. Logs are worth $30 per 1,000, and lumber $150 per 1,000. Most people live in tents, but cabins are being put up rapidly.  \"We have the most orderly mining community in the world. There is no thief, no claim jumping, no cheating or swindling in the many gambling houses. The greenhorn gets an honest game and every man's hand is above-board. If any funny work is attempted we run the offender out.\"     FEARS OF STARVATION.   If twenty or thirty thousand go to the mining camp, as now seems probable, starvation will result, as it will be absolutely impossible to feed more than ten thousand people with the supplies that are now on the way. In another season boats can be built and arrangements made for laying down an unlimited supply of food, but now the Alaska Commercial Company has only three vessels, while the other two lines only run to Juneau. Yukon river steamers are sent up in small sections and put together on the river. They draw only three or four feet of water, but with even this light draught they often become stranded on the sand bars in the upper waters of the Yukon. By the Juneau waters it is impossible to carry in any large quantity of provisions, as every pound of supplies must be carried on Indian's backs over Chilkoot Pass and by frequent portages that separate the lakes and streams on this overland route. After Sept. 15 this Juneau route is impassible to all except Indians, because of fierce storms which only Indians and experienced travellers can face.  The Alaska Commercial Company is very fearful that starvation will occur in the new camp this winter. President Louis Sloss said to-day that his company would do the best it could to feed those who rushed into the Klondyke, but he said that probably it would be impossible to get in more than 3,200 tons of food before ice closed the Yukon River. The company has 500 tons on the way to St. Michael's, but the river usually freezes over about the middle of September. They have only three boats, as one of the best boats was wrecked last spring. The supply will not suffice for more than the number of people already at the mining camp; so, if 20,000 or 30,000 should rush in, carrying only a small supply of food, the stores will be compelled to limit sales to each purchaser, and those not able to find work will starve.  Joe Ladue, who owns the town site of Dawson City, emphasized Mr. Sloss's warning. He said no one had any idea of the amount of food required by hearty men doing hard manual work in extreme cold weather. He said the suffering was keen last winter because the men could not secure a variety of food, which their systems craved. The transportation companies sent large amounts of whiskey, which found no great sale. Then they rushed in stoves, picks, shovels and other hardware, but the last thing they seemed to think of delivering was food, which was needed more than anything else. Especially the men needed such things as evaporated potatoes, which relieve the solid diet of bacon and beans; but it will be hopeless to try to land any of these luxuries, or even dried fruits, which are indispensable.  A returned New Yorker said:  \"'The only thing I fear is a famine the coming winter. The united efforts of the Alaska Commercial Company and the North American Transportation and Trading Company cannot transport over 4,500 tons of freight up the river this season, and not until next February can stuff be freighted over from Dyea, Juneau and other points down along the southern coast. There was great suffering last winter, and, though no one starved, food rates and rates for everything in the supply line were beyond belief. Flour was $120 a hundred weight at one time and beef from $1 to $2 a pound. Moose hams sold for about $30, or $2 per pound. Ordinary shovels for digging brought $17 and $18 apiece, and other stuff of that kind could not be obtained.  \"'Wages, however, were proportional; $2 per hour was common wages, and even now in these long days a man can command $1.50 per hour up here, or from $15 to $20 per day. The river steamers cannot keep crews this summer, for all run away to the mines as soon as they get in that region. Indians are all the help that can be kept, and even they are doing something in the line of locating claims.  \"'The man who goes in this winter over the Chilkat and Chilkoot Passes, or the man who goes in this summer by this steamboat route, should take in two years' grub. I understand that steamboat companies will not carry grub or merchandise for any man, and that they are making a flat passenger rate of $150 for any port from Seattle to Dawson. This means that they will get several thousand people in there this season, and if they do not get enough grub in, grub will be high. Not less than 1,000 newcomers came over this spring and how many will come by boat "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35838"],["title","Five Natural Hybrid Combinations in Minnows (Cyprinidae) (#0)"],["body","[Transciber's Note:  The follow suspected error has been corrected in this text:     Page 3: _C. erythogaster_ changed to _C. erythrogaster_]   UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY  Volume 13, No. 1, pp. 1-18  June 1, 1960     Five Natural Hybrid Combinations in Minnows (Cyprinidae)   BY FRANK B.

CROSS AND W. L. MINCKLEY   The hybrid fishes described herein are _Chrosomus erythrogaster_ (Rafinesque) × _Notropis cornutus frontalis_ (Agassiz), _C. erythrogaster_ × _Semotilus atromaculatus_ (Mitchill), _Campostoma anomalum plumbeum_ (Girard) × _S. atromaculatus_, _Gila nigrescens_ (Girard) × _Rhinichthys cataractae_ (Valenciennes), and _Notropis venustus venustus_ (Girard) × _Notropis whipplei_ (Girard). Two of the combinations have been reported, without descriptions, in literature (citations below), and Hubbs (1955: Fig. 3) graphically indicated hybridization between the same genera with which this paper is concerned, but did not designate the species involved.  All specimens of _C. erythrogaster_ × _N. c. frontalis_, _C. erythrogaster_ × _S. atromaculatus_, _C. a. plumbeum_ × _S. atromaculatus_, and _N. v. venustus_ × _N. whipplei_ were taken in a period of severe drought in Kansas and Arkansas. All were from small, spring-fed streams that support large populations of fishes. That the drought of 1953-1956 had pronounced effects on stream habitats in Kansas has been documented by Minckley and Cross (1959). Satisfactory sites for spawning may have been few, but an abundance of adult fishes persisted from earlier, wet years. Unusual crowding of spawning fishes would increase the opportunity for fertilization of the eggs of one species by sperm from another species. We think that the hybrids reported here (excepting _G. nigrescens_ × _R. cataractae_) are explainable on the basis of crowding; we have no information about stream-conditions where the last-named hybrid was found. Generally, hybridization of fishes seems most common in areas that have been subject to radical climatic change in the past 20,000 or fewer years (Hubbs, 1955:18-19), and in streams that have been altered recently by the activities of man (Hubbs and Strawn, 1956:342, and others). Streams from which we report hybrids probably were affected by overgrazing of their watersheds; overgrazing was unusually severe in the drought.  Most of the hybrids were recognized as unusual at the time of capture, and were saved as part of numerically selective samples from the streams (rather than being discovered in the laboratory, in random samples).  Our measurements were made by methods defined by Hubbs and Lagler (1958); values are expressed as thousandths of the larger dimension.  =_Chrosomus erythrogaster_ × _Notropis cornutus frontalis_=: KU 3872 (26.7 mm. in standard length) and KU 4170 (46.6 mm.) from Deep Creek, Riley Co., Kansas, Sec. 23, T. 11S, R. 7E, Dec. 14, 1957, and Apr. 26, 1958, respectively; and KU 4185 (39.3 mm.) from Bluff Creek, Pottawatomie Co., Kansas, Sec. 15, T. 6S, R. 8E, June 29, 1958. Compared in Table 1 with five specimens of _C. erythrogaster_, KU 3914 (39.3 to 47.3 mm., mean 43.0 mm.) from the same locality and of the same date as KU 3872 (above); and with five specimens of _N. c. frontalis_, KU 4184 (41.0 to 46.5 mm., mean 42.5 mm.) from the same locality and of the same date as KU 4185 (above). This cross has previously been recorded by Trautman (1957:326, 355) and by Minckley (1959:431).  The head-lengths of the hybrids are greater than in specimens of like size of _C. erythrogaster_ or _N. c. frontalis_ (Table 1). Hubbs and Miller (1943:373-374) reported that hybrids of _Gila orcutti_ × _Siphateles mohavensis_ have larger, more robust heads than either of the parental species, perhaps because of heterosis. The enlarged heads in hybrids of _C. erythrogaster_ and _N. c. frontalis_ result primarily from elongation of the postorbital region, with lesser elongation of the snout and orbit. The enlarged head affects measurements obtained for other structures that are parts of the head (and expressed as proportions of standard length or head-length), causing a tendency toward _N. c. frontalis_ when the head-part is divided by standard length, and greater intermediacy or a tendency toward _C. erythrogaster_ when the head-part is divided by head-length. In characters in which the parental species differ most (size of eye, length of upper jaw, and width of gape), the hybrids are intermediate between the parental species, regardless of whether the measurements are expressed as proportions of head-length or standard length; however, tendencies toward one or the other of the parental species (dependent on the divisor) can also been seen in these characters. Some experimentally propagated hybrids show highly variable, and sometimes extreme characters, rather than intermediacy of meristic and proportional characters (Hubbs, 1956).  TABLE 1.
