CHAPTER I.  VOYAGE FROM NEW ORLEANS TO HAVANA. DESCRIPTION OF THE CAPITAL OF CUBA.       Introductory remarks.--Departure from New      Orleans.--Compagnons de voyage.--Their different      objects.--Grumblers and grumbling.--Arrival at      Havana.--Passports.--The Harbor.--The Fortifications.--The      City.--Its streets and houses.--Anecdote of a      sailor.--Society in Cuba.--The nobility.--\"Sugar      noblemen.\"--Different grades of Society.--Effects upon the      stranger.--Charitable judgment invoked.--Hospitality of      individuals.--General love of titles and show.--Festival      celebration.--Neatness of the Habañeros.   Who, in these days of easy adventure, does not make a voyage, encounter the perils of the boisterous ocean, gaze with rapture upon its illimitable expanse, make verses upon its deep, unfathomable blue--if perchance the Muse condescends to bear him company--plant his foot on a foreign shore, scrutinize the various objects which are there presented to his view, moralize upon them all, contemplate nations in their past, present and future existence, swell with wonder at the largeness of his comprehension--and return, if haply he may, to his native land, to pour into the listening ears of friends and countrymen, the tale of his ups and downs, his philosophic gatherings, with undisguised complacency? Whose history does not present a chapter analogous to this? We might almost write one universal epitaph, and apply it to every individual who has flourished in the present century.--\"He lived, travelled, wrote a book, and died.\"  And, seeing that in this auspicious age, when the public mind is alive      \"To every peril, pain and dread of woe,     That _genius_ condescends to undergo--\"  when it seems disposed to appreciate the toil of intellectual effort, by the deference which it pays, the obedience it yields, and the signal support which it gives, to the meritorious productions of the historian, the statesman and the scholar; when we behold the power of discrimination so strikingly developed in the fact, that men are infinitely more regaled with the simple, truthful narrative, than with the ponderous tome of fictitious events, however pleasing the fabrication is made to appear;--who, it may be asked, I care not whether he has washed his hands in the clouds, while tossed upon the summit of a troubled wave, or looked out upon the world, from Alps highest peak, or whether he has leaned over the side of an humble canoe, to disturb the tranquil waters of some placid stream, above the bosom of which, his modest aspirations will never suffer him to rise,--who that has _travelled_, it matters not _how_, can do otherwise than exclaim, \"Oh that my words were now written--Oh that they were printed in a book!\"  Though not disposed to allow that no higher sentiment than this prevalent _cacoethes scribendi_ has influenced me in the present attempt, I am, nevertheless, so thoroughly convinced of its epidemic prevalence at the present time, that I am resolved neither to wonder nor complain, if friends as well as foes, \"gentle readers\" as well as carping critics, should set it down as only and unquestionably a symptom. I shall retain my own opinion, however, albeit I do not express it; and, contenting, nay congratulating myself with being in good company, shall complacently set out upon another \"ramble,\" and sit down to another book, whenever      \"the stars propitious shine,\"  or health, or business, drives me away from my quiet pursuits at home.  It is no slight gratification, it must be allowed, to be enabled, by so feeble an effort, to make all one's friends, as well as a portion of the great world unknown, _compagnons de voyage_ in all our rambles--to bring them into such a magnetic communication with our souls, that they shall at once see with our eyes, and hear with our ears, and enjoy, without the toil and weariness of travel, all that is worthy of remembrance and record, in our various adventures by sea and land.  On the 20th of January, 1844, in company with sixty fellow passengers, I turned my back upon the crescent city, and embarked on board the Steam Ship Alabama, Captain Windle, bound from Now Orleans to Havana. Many of our number, like myself, were in pursuit of health and pleasure, some were braving the dangers and enduring the privations of the passage, for the purpose of amassing wealth in the sugar and coffee trade; and others were seeking, what they probably will never find this side the grave, a happier home than the one they were leaving behind"]]]
