Here in winter, buried in her furs, she slept curled up for whole days together. But which of us is without a fault? A little greedy without being actually voracious, sweet Grisette sometimes ventured on to the stone-work of the cooking-stove, and from there was able to discover from which of the saucepans was exhaled the most savoury odour, and never did she make a mistake on that score!\"  Du Fouilloux states in his _Venerie_:--\"Je ay veu aux blereaux prendre deuant moy les petis cochons de laict, lesquelz ilz tray-noient tout vifz en leur terrier. C'est vne chose certaine qu'ilz en sont plus friandz que de toutes autres chairs: car si on passe vn carnage de porceau par dessus leurs terriers, ilz ne faudront iamais de sorter pour y aller.\"  The badger is credited with a special love for pork. I have seen a statement in an old volume of the _Gentleman's Recreation_, in which the writer refers to the taste of the badger for pork. \"They love Hog's-flesh above any other; for take but a piece of Pork and train it over a badger's Burrow, if he be within, you shall quickly see him appear without.\"  Badgers are omnivorous. In their wild state their food is principally roots and insects--they are especially fond of beetles and such creatures as are to be found just below the surface of the ground, or under the decaying dung of cattle. The natural history books say they eat frogs. This may be true, but I have not observed it. I have tried badgers in confinement with all sorts of insects and grubs, but I never could get them to touch slugs or worms. They are carnivorous, and eat mice, rats, voles, and moles. They will take a rabbit out of a trap, turn it inside out, and eat all the meat, leaving the skin behind, turned neatly with the fur inside. They are also fond of very young rabbits, and will dig a shaft through several feet of solid earth direct on to the nest. But when this has been stated, nearly all has been said with regard to their propensity to damage in game coverts. I am supported by other observers in this opinion; for instance, a recent writer in the _Field_ who says:--\"In reply to E. T. D'Egmont's inquiry about catching badgers, I have never found them do much harm to the nests of winged game; but they are death on rabbits, and much resemble a fox in finding a young one appetizing. Their skins would make good waistcoats, but, apart from that, I would not destroy them upon any property of my own, because they do so much more good than harm in divers ways. We have a small property in my family, where foxes and badgers lie up together in close proximity to a rabbit warren, upon the inhabitants of which they feed. It is a spot practically unknown to the outward gaze of man, as it is difficult of access; and I should fancy that any one attempting to attack their stronghold would meet with a stubborn resistance. Badgers mostly go seeking for food during the night-time. Where they abound, one occasionally meets them walking quietly along a path, with their snout low down, and occasionally giving a kind of grunt like a mongoose. They are very fond of honey. A bag pegged back over the entrance to their holes is a good way of catching them.\"  They do not hunt for rabbits or game like a fox or cat, and though there are undoubtedly instances of their taking partridge and pheasant eggs, in my experience I have never known it done by those around me, nor from other places where they have ample opportunity of doing so. I have known a pheasant rear a young brood on an earth tenanted by badgers; but, curiously enough, I have known a similar case on a fox's earth, containing a vixen and cubs, and I cannot defend the general character of a fox in regard to game. Still it may be taken that a badger, though occasionally eating rabbits and rarely eggs, does not hunt for game, ground or feathered, or do a hundredth part of the damage done by a fox or a cat. There have always been more rabbits, hares, and pheasants in a hollow near my house, where there is a large colony of badgers, than in any other part of the coverts. The badger has a special weakness for wild honey, and the grubs of wasps and humble bees. The wildest and most unconciliatory badgers I have ever had in confinement would come out and eat a wasp's nest, and they will hunt every bank and hedgerow in July and August, routing out every wasp's and hornet's nest in the country-side. A keeper told me that upon one occasion, when he was walking along the covert edges in summer-time about nine o'clock in the evening, his attention was arrested by a curious chapping, champing noise, and looking over the fence he saw an old badger with his head in a huge wasp's nest hanging in a bramble bush, and he was crunching up and eating with the greatest gusto the wasps and grubs, quite undeterred by the thousand angry insects that covered his head and body. In truth, I must admit that while he is thus useful, he has been known to enter a garden and upset the hives and purloin the honey, being as fond of it as his larger cousins, the bears.  I must also bring another charge against him. Let me introduce this painful subject by giving the following correspondence from the _Field_ newspaper:--  \"Wilfred writes--'I shall be obliged if you will allow me to ask your readers whether they have known old badgers to kill fox cubs. Last year our M.F.H. gave a neighbouring keeper a litter of cubs. He put them into a natural empty fox-earth, and kept them shut in until they had got fairly on their feed, and were quite at home. When he opened the earth, and allowed them to come out, they played about, and all went well for two or three days, when he found one at a little distance from the mouth of the earth dead, with its skull smashed in, and very much bitten about the head and neck. He lost the lot in the same way in a few days. He thought an old badger or fox killed his cubs. About this time I got five cubs, and put them into an empty artificial fox-earth. All went well with them for some time after they played out, when the keeper reported finding one about twenty yards from the earth dead, and killed after the same fashion as my neighbour's cubs, and I too lost mine. In the same artificial earth I had a natural litter this season, and the cubs played out well; but on the keeper telling me he did not think they were there now, I went to examine the earth, found the foxes gone, and the earth occupied by an old badger. I had a litter of fox cubs in the deer park here, where I live, and all went well with them until ten days ago, when one was picked up dead, killed in the same manner as those last year, and another was found dead yesterday. I feel quite certain myself that they were killed by an old badger or an old fox, for I am sure if killed by dogs they would not smash the skull and neck. I shall be glad if any one can enlighten me on this subject.'\"  In reply to \"Wilfred\" there were several letters, among which were the following:--      \"Sir,--Undoubtedly; every one that they can get near, and more     especially hand-reared cubs that have not got the old foxes to     protect them. I was first told this by old Jem Hills, the     well-known huntsman of the Heythrop, in his latter years; and     subsequently I had positive proof of what he said. On one     occasion a man brought a fine half-grown cub to my house which     he had picked up dead in the road he came along. It was bitten     most severely through and behind the shoulder, and I at once     remarked to a friend that was with me, 'That is the work of a     badger.' On going down to an earth where I knew there was a     natural litter, we found tracks of a badger all about the place,     as if he had been hunting the cubs. Having at the time eight     cubs that I was hand-rearing in an artificial drain, I thought     it was high time to look after them, for though regularly fed,     I did not always watch to see whether they all came to feed.     However, I did so that evening, and only two came, and these     looked very wild and scared. I then searched the plantation, and     picked up four of my cubs killed quite recently, and bitten in     the same savage way. A few weeks after we killed a big boar     badger in the drain. Several years later, I was again rearing     some hand-bred cubs, and everything went well until they were a     good size, when one morning I found one of them killed,     evidently by a badger; and I eventually took four more of them,     and the others were all driven away. This badger beat me for     some little time, but I got him at last. Though old badgers and     foxes are often found in the same earth, more frequently when     one of the latter has been run to ground by hounds, yet, as a     rule, they give each other wide berths. If your correspondent     'Wilfred' wishes to save his cubs, let him kill every badger as     soon as possible.\"      \"Sir,--Replying to 'Wilfred's' question, 'Do badgers kill fox     cubs?' I cannot say they do, because there are no badgers in     this district; but having at different times had young foxes     killed in the way he describes, namely, bitten in the head, I     can assure him that it is done by an old dog fox. Should he wish     for further information, I refer him to Mr. John Douglas, Royal     Hotel, Pudding Chare, Newcastle-on-Tyne, who will tell him of     the experience he gained when at Clumber, under the Duke of     Newcastle.\"      \"Sir,--I may tell 'Wilfred' that I have never known old badgers     kill fox cubs, though I have studied the habits of both for     nearly forty years. No doubt an old vixen, with no cubs of her     own, killed his; the dog fox will not do this. Indeed, he will     cater for all the cubs of his own get, but a strange vixen is     very apt to kill any cubs which have no mother of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36830"],["title","The Badger: A Monograph (#7)"],["body"," own. I     have known a terrier bitch kill a litter of foxhound puppies,     and one of my Irish terriers will kill puppies if she has the     chance. As to the 'natural' litter which 'Wilfred' found gone,     they had merely been shifted by the vixen; as soon as the cubs     get able to travel they are always shifted. Last year I had two     tame wild ducks sitting in a hedge. A badger passed regularly     within a yard of them every night, but they were undisturbed.     This year a fox took one of them just before it hatched. I was     sorry to read the other day in the _Field_ an account of two old     and four cub badgers having been dug out in Gloucestershire.     There is surely no sport in this, and the badgers are destitute     of grease now, whereas at Michaelmas they are fat enough to     provide grease for all the rheumatic people in the parish. I     like to catch one with my terriers when the harvest moon shines.     Sometimes I get up in a convenient tree near the earth and watch     the badgers feeding on the crazy roots. How fond they are of the     wild bees' honey, and also of wasps' nests. Let me advise     'Wilfred' to read the exhaustive and interesting account given     in a letter to the _Times_ (October 24, 1877), and quoted in     _Cassell's Natural History_, vol. ii. It thus concludes--'The     badgers and the foxes are not unfriendly, and last spring a     litter of cubs was brought forth very near the badgers; but     their mother removed them after they had grown familiar, as she     probably thought they were showing themselves more than was     prudent.' Mr. Ellis of Loughborough was the author of the     letter, and he had rare opportunities of studying the habits of     badgers.\"  I am loth to do it, but wishing to be an impartial historian, am compelled to state that the badger is capable of vulpicide. As a rule he can put up with an occasional lodger of the fox family, and live happily with him, and from his superior qualities as an architect of subterranean dwellings, he is on the whole an encourager of foxes. He often gives up his spacious apartments to a vixen in the spring, and submits to eviction. A fox will often take possession of a badger's earth, new or old; and in order to persuade foxes to take to a particular covert, no surer method can be pursued than to get badgers to make earths when they are required. But even a badger's patience can be exhausted, as the following history of my own experience will show. I would premise, however, that I do not credit the oft-repeated story that the fox gets rid of the badger by leaving his evacuations in the badger's earth. Being the less and weaker animal, all a fox does is allowed on sufferance. My suspicions of a badger's capability to wage war on foxes were first aroused some years ago. The badgers had made a fine double set of earths on the north side, of a hill in a neighbouring larch wood, where no effort on my part to get foxes to breed and stay had succeeded. No sooner, however, was a colony of badgers established than foxes haunted the holes and covert. In a succession of years there was as certain to be a litter of fox cubs in the badger earth as a sunrise on the morrow.  What happened each spring was that the foxes and badgers frequented both sets indiscriminately till about March. When the vixen lay in the badgers abandoned the set of holes where she was, and restricted themselves to the other set some twenty yards distant. Year after year the fox cubs prospered and grew up, till one summer the keeper found a fox cub in a field with his head bitten in two and terribly worried. I did not know how to account for it. I watched the vixen and the other cubs one evening to see that they were all right, and saw them, but found they had left the earth and were in the covert. For two years all went well and the foxes were unmolested, and then occurred something that gave me a clue to the death of the cub three years before. Two vixens lay in at the badgers' earth, and brought up their families of seven and four respectively, till they were about one-third grown. There were then to my knowledge at least four badgers and twelve foxes in these two earths. On one or two occasions the stillness of the night was broken by the veriest pandemonium at the earth, but still I did not think much of it. At the end of the hunting season, at the end of April, when the cubs were seven or eight weeks old, and a fortnight after the hounds had been through the coverts, I found the largest and finest of the vixens dead, and thought that, in spite of the earths being open, she must have been chopped by the hounds. A post-mortem examination, as well as the improbability of a vixen with cubs being out in the early part of the day, convinced me that she had not been killed by hounds. She seemed to have been badly bitten through the legs and thighs but not on the body. From this time the other vixen and all the cubs left the badgers' earths and remained in the covert. It was on this occasion that an attempt to find out how many badgers there were in these earths was rewarded by seeing seven full-grown badgers emerge from a single hole. It was rough, no doubt, that the badgers should be invaded by two large families of smelling foxes, and no doubt their patience had become exhausted. Still I could not tolerate this kind of behaviour, and so I had a dig at them, took two old ones out, and transported them to Scotland. The following year there was peace and fox cubs again. The year after, however, the vixen and her cubs took off into the covert very early after another bit of Bank Holiday business, at a time of night when all respectable people were quietly in bed. And yet all through the year foxes are in the earth, and this spring, as heretofore, a litter of cubs has been raised, but removed to another earth at a safe distance from the badgers. I have never heard of badgers taking the offensive against foxes; they will never molest a fox or vixen unless their earth is invaded, and in my case if I had had no badgers in this covert I should have had no foxes; and whilst it is annoying that the fox cubs and vixen should be driven out, and perhaps occasionally killed, the drawback is slight when it is considered that as long as there are badgers there will be a litter of cubs, which nine times out of ten will get safely off.  There are every now and then albino badgers reported, but I have never seen one alive. I think, however, they are more subject to albinism than most animals. I do not know of a case of melanism.  \"_White Badger at Overton, Hants._--While digging for badgers on April 30, we came across two dog badgers in the same earth, one of which was quite white, the colour of a white ferret, with pink eyes. Unfortunately, the terriers punished him so much he had to be destroyed. I have helped to dig out a great many of these animals, but never saw nor heard of a white one before.\"--T. P.     PART III   There are several methods by which the badger can be taken alive, or killed, with ease. I am familiar with several successful ways of trapping him. The reader, if he is not aware of these, must not expect me to enlighten him, as my object in writing is to arouse an interest in his preservation, not to facilitate his destruction. It may be as well to state, however, that the inhuman engine, the steel trap (by which so many of the birds and beasts that frequented the wild woods of England and Scotland have been exterminated) is an instrument that arouses the suspicion of a badger at once, and he is as clever in avoiding it as an old-fashioned rat. The badger if caught in a steel trap will frequently bite his leg or foot clean off. In my opinion there are two legitimate methods of hunting the badger. First, that of a straight-forward attack on his fortress; and should it be an old-established earth, it may be the end of the longest day will not see the battle ended. There are, of course, the fortunes of war--a lucky engagement, a wrong turn on the part of the defender, a successful trench quickly cutting off his retreat--which may deliver him unexpectedly into your hands; or the enemy may outwit you altogether, conducting a masterful retreat, with gallant sorties on the dogs, and by continually changing his front drive you to abandon works, trenches, and operations that have cost great labour and time; thus you may be left with a tired and wounded pack of terriers, exhausted sappers, and the badger, having blocked and barricaded his retreat with soil, stones, and sand, is lost. The war thus made is an equal one: you attack him on his own ground in his fortress where he is acquainted with every passage, gallery, and casement; he is armed to the teeth and armour-plated, and can drive a road forward, downward, or upward with extraordinary rapidity. It is true you may have many terriers, but he has an advantage over your forces. Only one of your dogs can engage at a time, and the badger has the advantage of weight, size, knowledge of the ground, and familiarity with the dark--in fact, in every respect except those of courage and endurance, which in some terriers may equal his own. The other method, less sure, depends on taking the badger off his guard, and is more in the character of an ambuscade under cover of night. When the badgers are away from home you block up their earths, placing sacks with running nooses in the mouth, in the most frequented holes. Station one of your party near the \"set,\" and you may either take a small pack of hounds and draw the country for a few miles round, and hunt him like a fox, getting a run across country and a fine cry; or you may beat the neighbouring coverts with men and dogs of any description that are trained to hunt the badger.  In the following, taken from an article which appeared in a newspaper, there is a good account of night hunting.  \"Owing to his shy and retiring habits, rather than to the scarcity of"]]]
