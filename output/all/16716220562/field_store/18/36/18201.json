Say not to thyself, to-morrow I will repent; for it is thy duty to do it daily.  The gospel of grace and salvation is above all doctrine the most dangerous, if it be received in _word_ only by graceless men; if it be not attended with a sensible need of a Saviour, and bring them to him; for such men only as have the _notion_ of it, are of all men most miserable; for by reason of their knowing more than heathens, this shall only be their final portion, that they shall have greater stripes.    OF PRAYER.   Before you enter into prayer, ask thy soul these questions, 1.  To what _end_, O my soul! art thou retired into this place?  Art thou come to converse with the Lord in prayer?  Is he present, will he hear thee?  Is he merciful, will he help thee?  Is thy business slight, is it not concerning the welfare of thy soul?  What words wilt thou use to move him to compassion?  To make thy preparation complete, consider that thou art but _dust_ and _ashes_; and he the great God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, _that clothes himself with light as with a garment_; that thou art a vile sinner, and he a holy God; that thou art but a poor crawling worm, and he the omnipotent Creator.  In all your prayers, forget not to thank the Lord for his mercies.  When thou prayest, rather let thy heart be without _words_ than thy words without _heart_.  Prayer will make a man cease from sin, or sin will entice a man to cease from prayer.  The spirit of prayer is more precious than thousands of gold and silver.  Pray often, for prayer is a shield to the soul, a sacrifice to God, and a scourge for Satan.    OF THE LORD’S-DAYS, SERMONS, AND WEEK-DAYS.   Have a special care to sanctify the Lord’s-day; for as thou keepest it, so will it be with thee all the week long.  Make the Lord’s-day the _market_ for thy soul; let the whole day be spent in prayer, repetitions, or meditations; lay aside the affairs of the other parts of the week; let the sermon thou hast heard be converted into _prayer_: shall God allow thee six days, and wilt thou not afford him one?  In the church, be careful to serve God; for thou art in his eyes, and not in man’s.  Thou mayst hear sermons often, and do well in practising what thou hearest; but thou must not expect to be told in a pulpit all that thou oughtest to do, but be studious in reading the Scriptures, and other good books; what thou hearest may be forgotten, but what thou readest may better be retained.  Forsake not the public worship of God, lest God forsake thee; not only in public, but in private.  On the week-day, when thou risest in the morning, consider, 1.  Thou must die; 2.  Thou mayst die that minute; 3.  What will become of thy soul. Pray often.  At night consider, 1.  What sins thou hast committed; 2. How often thou hast prayed; 3.  What hath thy mind been bent upon; 4. What hath been thy dealing; 5.  What thy conversation; 6.  If thou callest to mind the errors of the day, sleep not without a confession to God, and a hope of pardon.  Thus, every morning and evening make up thy account with Almighty God, and thy reckoning will be the less at last.    OF THE LOVE OF THE WORLD.   Nothing more hinders a soul from coming to Christ than a vain love of the _world_; and till a soul is freed from it, it can never have a true love for God.  What are the honours and riches of this world, when compared to the glories of a crown of life?  Love not the world, for it is a moth in a Christian’s life.  To despise the world is the way to enjoy heaven; and blessed are they who delight to converse with God by prayer.  What folly can be greater than to labour for the meat that perisheth, and neglect the food of eternal life?  God or the world must be neglected at _parting_ time, for then is the time of trial.  To seek yourself in this life is to be lost; and to be humble is to be exalted.  The epicure that delighteth in the dainties of this world, little thinketh that those very creatures will one day witness against him.    ON SUFFERING.   It is not every suffering that makes a man a martyr; but suffering for the Word of God after a right manner; that is, not only for _righteousness_, but for righteousness’ sake; not only for _truth_, but out of love to truth; not only for God’s Word, but according to it: to wit, in that holy, humble, meek manner, as the Word of God requireth.  It is a rare thing to suffer aright, and to have my spirit in suffering bent against God’s enemy, sin.  Sin in doctrine, sin in worship, sin in life, and sin in conversation.  Neither the devil, nor men of the world, can kill thy righteousness, or love to it, but by thy own hand; or separate that and thee asunder, without thy own act.  Nor will he that doth indeed suffer for the sake of it, or out of love he bears thereto, be tempted to _exchange_ it for the good will of the whole world.  I have often thought that the best of Christians are found in the worst times: and I have thought again, that one reason why we are not better is, because God purges us no more.  Noah and Lot, who so _holy_ as they in the time of their afflictions! and yet, who so _idle_ as they in the time of their prosperity?    OF DEATH AND JUDGMENT.   As the devil labours by all means to keep out other things that are good, so to keep out of the heart as much as in him lies, the thoughts of passing out of this life into another world; for he knows if he can but keep them from the serious thoughts of _death_, he shall the more easily keep them in their sins.  Nothing will make us more earnest in working out the work of our salvation than a frequent meditation of mortality; nothing hath a greater influence for the taking off our hearts from vanities, and for the begetting in us desires for holiness.  O! sinner, what a condition wilt thou fall into when thou departest the world; if thou depart unconverted, thou hadst better have been _smothered_ the first hour thou wast born; thou hadst better have been plucked one limb from the other; thou hadst better have been made a dog, a toad, a serpent, than to die unconverted; and this thou wilt find true if thou repent not.  A man would be counted a fool to slight a judge before whom he is to have a trial of his whole estate.  The trial we are to have before God is of _otherwise_ importance; it concerns our eternal happiness or misery, and yet dare we affront him.  The only way for us to escape that terrible judgment is to be often passing a sentence of condemnation upon ourselves here.  When the sound of the trumpet shall be heard, which shall summon the dead to appear before the tribunal of God, the righteous shall hasten out of their graves with joy to meet their Redeemer in the clouds; others shall call to the mountains and hills to fall upon them, to cover them from the sight of their judge; let us, therefore, in time be _posing_ ourselves which of the _two_ we shall be.    OF THE JOYS OF HEAVEN.   There is no good in this life but what is mingled with some evil: honours perplex, riches disquiet, and pleasures ruin health.  But in heaven we shall find blessings in their purity, without any ingredient to imbitter; with everything to sweeten it.  O! who is able to conceive the inexpressible, inconceivable joys that are there!  None but they who have tasted of them.  Lord, help us to put such a value upon them here, that in order to prepare ourselves for them, we may be willing to forego the loss of all those deluding pleasures here.  How will the heavens echo for joy, when the bride, the Lamb’s wife, shall come to dwell with her husband for ever!  Christ is the desire of nations, the joy of angels, the delight of the Father; what solace then must the soul be filled with, that hath the possession of him to all eternity!  O! what acclamations of joy will there be, when all the children of God shall meet together, without fear of being disturbed by the anti-Christian and Cainish brood.  Is there not a time coming when the godly may ask the wicked, what profit they have in their pleasure? what comfort in their greatness? and what fruit in all their labour?  If you would be better satisfied what the beatifical vision means, my request is, that you would live _holily_ and go and see.    OF THE TORMENTS OF HELL.   Heaven and salvation is not surely _more_ promised to the godly, than hell and damnation is threatened to, and shall be executed on, the wicked.  Oh! who knows the power of God’s wrath?  None but damned ones.  Sinners’ company are the devil and his angels, tormented in everlasting fire with a curse.  Hell would be a kind of paradise, if it were no worse than the _worst_ of this world.  As different as grief is from joy, as torment from rest, as terror from peace; so different is the state of sinners from that of _saints_ in the world to come."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3614"],["title","An Exhortation to Peace and Unity (#0)"],["body","UNITY***   Transcribed from the “Works of the Puritan Divines (Bunyan)”, 1845 Thomas Nelson edition, by David Price, email ccx074@pglaf.org                          AN EXHORTATION TO PEACE AND UNITY.   [We deem it proper to state, that, though the following Treatise of Christian Union appears in nearly all the collected editions of BUNYAN’S WORKS, yet its genuineness has been called in question by the Rev. Mr Philip in his admirable work, “The Life and Times of Bunyan.”  Without here entering into this question, we have separately appended it to the works of Bunyan in this volume, and trust that it will not prove unacceptable to our readers, especially considering the efforts that are now being made to promote the living union of all true Christians who hold the one Lord, the one faith, and the one baptism.]           _Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of                            peace_.—Ephesians iv. 3.  BELOVED, religion is the great bond of human society; and it were well if itself were kept within the bond of unity; and that it may so be, let us, according to the text, use our utmost endeavours “to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.”  These words contain a counsel and a caution: the counsel is, That we endeavour the unity of the Spirit; the caution is, That we do it in the bond of peace; as if I should say, I would have you live in unity, but yet I would have you to be careful that you do not purchase unity with the breach of charity.  Let us therefore be cautious that we do not so press after unity in practice and opinion as to break the bond of peace and affection.  In the handling of these words, I shall observe this method.  I.  I shall open the sense of the text.  II.  I shall shew wherein this unity and peace consist.  III.  I shall shew you the fruits and benefits of it, together with nine inconveniences and mischiefs that attend those churches where unity and peace is wanting.  IV.  And, lastly, I shall give you twelve directions and motives for the obtaining of it.  1.  As touching the sense of the text, when ye are counselled to keep the unity of the Spirit, we are not to understand the Spirit of God, as personally so considered; because the Spirit of God, in that sense, is not capable of being divided, and so there would be no need for us to endeavour to keep the unity of it.  By the unity of the spirit then, we are to understand that unity of mind which the Spirit of God calls for, and requires Christians to endeavour after; hence it is that we are exhorted, by one spirit, with one mind, to strive together for the faith of the gospel; Phil. i. 27.  But farther, the apostle in these words alludes to the state and composition of a natural body, and doth thereby inform us, that the mystical body of Christ holds an analogy with the natural body of man: as, 1.  In the natural body there must be a spirit to animate it; for the body without the spirit is dead; James ii. 26.  So it is in the mystical body of Christ; the apostle no sooner tells of that one body, but he minds us of that one Spirit; Eph. iv. 4.  2.  The body hath joints and hands to unite all the parts; so hath the mystical body of Christ; Col. ii. 19.  This is that bond of peace mentioned in the text, as also in the 16th verse of the same chapter, where the whole body is said to be fitly joined together, and compacted, by that which every joint supplieth.  3.  The natural body receives counsel and nourishment from the head; so doth the mystical body of Christ; he is their counsellor, and him they must hear; he is their head, and him they must hold: hence it is that the apostle complaineth, Col. ii. 19, of some that did not hold the head from which the whole body by joints and hands hath nourishment.  4.  The natural body cannot well subsist, if either the spirit be wounded or the joints broken or dislocated; the body cannot bear a wounded or broken spirit—“A broken spirit drieth the bones;” Prov. xvii. 22, and “A wounded spirit who can bear?” Prov. xviii. 14.  And, on the other hand, how often have the disjointing of the body, and the breakings thereof, occasioned the expiration of the spirit?  In like manner it fares with the mystical body of Christ; how do divided spirits break the bonds of peace, which are the joints of this body?  And how do the breakings of the body and church of Christ wound the spirit of Christians, and oftentimes occasion the spirit and life of Christianity to languish, if not to expire.  How needful is it then that we endeavour the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace!  II.  I now come to shew you wherein this unity and peace consists; and this I shall demonstrate in five particulars.  1.  This unity and peace may consist with the ignorance of many truths, and in the holding of some errors; or else this duty of peace and unity could not be practicable by any on this side perfection: but we must now endeavour the unity of the spirit, till we come to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God; Eph. iv. 13.  Because now, as the apostle saith, “We know in part, and we prophesy in part,” and “Now we see through a glass darkly;” 1 Cor. xiii. 9, 12.  And as this is true in general, so we may find it true if we descend to particular instances.  The disciples seem to be ignorant of that great truth which they had often, and in much plainness, been taught by their Master once and again, viz., that his kingdom was not of this world, and that in the world they should suffer and be persecuted; yet in the 1st of the Acts, ver. 6, we read, that they asked of him if he would at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? thereby discovering that Christ’s kingdom (as they thought) should consist in his temporal jurisdiction over Israel, which they expected should now commence and take place amongst them.  Again, our Lord tells them, that he had many things to say (and these were many important truths) which they could not now bear; John xvi. 12.  And that these were important truths, appear by the 10th and 11th verses, where he is discoursing of righteousness and judgment, and then adds, that he had yet many things to say which they could not bear; and thereupon promises the Comforter to lead them into ALL TRUTH; which implies, that they were yet ignorant of many truths, and consequently held divers errors; and yet for all this, he prays for, and presses them to, their great duty of peace and unity; John xiv. 27; xvii. 21.  To this may be added that of Heb. v. 11, where the author saith, he had many things to say of the priestly office of Christ, which by reason of their dulness they were not capable to receive; as also that in the 10th of the Acts, where Peter seems to be ignorant of the truth, viz., that the gospel was to be preached to all nations; and contrary hereunto, he erred in thinking it unlawful to preach amongst the Gentiles.  I shall add two texts more, one in Acts xix., where we read that those disciples which had been discipled and baptized by John were yet ignorant of the Holy Ghost, and knew not (as the text tells us) whether there were any holy Ghost or no; though John did teach constantly, that he that should come after him should baptize with the Holy Ghost and fire.  From hence we may easily and plainly infer, that Christians may be ignorant of many truths, by reason of weak and dull capacities, and other such like impediments, even while those truths are with much plainness delivered to them.  Again, we read, Heb. v. 13, of some that were unskilful in the word of righteousness, who nevertheless are called babes in Christ, and with whom unity and peace is to be inviolably kept and maintained.  2.  As this unity and peace may consist with the ignorance of many truths, and with the holding some errors, so it must consist with (and it cannot consist without) the believing and practising those things which are necessary to salvation and church-communion; and they are, 1st, Believing that Christ the Son of God died for the sins of men.  2d, That whoever believeth ought to be baptized.  The third thing essential to this communion, is a holy and a blameless conversation.  (1.)  That believing that the Son of God died for the sins of men is necessary to salvation, I prove by these texts, which tell us, that he that doth not believe shall be damned, Mark xvi. 16; John iii. 36; Rom. x. 9.  That it is also necessary to church-communion appears from Matt. xvi. 16–18.  Peter having confessed that Christ was the Son of the living God, Christ thereupon assures Peter, that upon this rock, viz., this profession of faith, or this Christ which Peter had confessed, he would build his church, and the gates of hell should not prevail against it. And, 1 Cor. iii. 11, the apostle having told the Corinthians that they were God’s building, presently adds, that they could not be built upon any foundation but upon that which was laid, which was Jesus Christ.  All which proves, that Christian society is founded upon the profession of Christ; and not only scripture, but the laws of right reason, dictate this, that some rules and orders must be observed for the founding all society, which must be consented to by all that will be of it.  Hence it comes to pass, that to own Christ as the Lord and head of Christians is essential to the founding of Christian society.  (2.)  The Scriptures have declared, that this faith gives the professors of it a right to baptism, as in the case of the eunuch, Acts viii.  When he demanded why he might not be baptized, Philip answered, that if he believed with all his heart, he might.  The eunuch thereupon confessing Christ, was baptized.  Now, that baptism is essential to church-communion, I prove from 1 Cor. xii., where we shall find the apostle labouring to prevent an evil use that might be made of spiritual gifts, as thereby to be puffed up, and to think that such as wanted them were not of the body, or to be esteemed members: he thereupon"]]]
