Some naturalists do not expect to find a broad line of demarkation between the two great divisions of living things, but others characterise such an idea as \"unphilosophical,\" in spite of which, however, we incline towards it.  Mr. Gosse, whose opinion is entitled to great respect, calls the _Euglenæ_ \"animals\" in his 'Evenings with the Microscope;' but from the aggregate of recorded observations it seems that they evolve oxygen, are coloured with the colouring matter of plants, reproduce their species in a manner analogous to plants, and have in some cases been clearly traced to the vegetable world. It is, however, possible that some _Euglenæ_ forms may be animal and others vegetable, and while their place at nature's table is being decided, they must be content to be called _Phytozoa_, which, as we have before explained, is merely _Zoophyte_ turned upside down.  Some authorities have thought their animality proved by the high degree of contractility which their tissues evince. This, however, cannot go for much, as all physiologists admit contractility to belong to the vegetable tissues of the sensitive plant, \"Venus' Fly-trap,\" &c., and a little more or less cannot mark the boundary between two orders of being.  We shall have occasion again to notice the _Protophytes_, and now pass to the _Protozoa_, of which we have a good illustration in the _Vorticella_ already spoken of. In the group before us a number of elegant bells or vases stand at the end of long stalks, as shown at the top of the frontispiece, while round the tops of the bells, the vibrations of a wreath or cilia produce little vortices or whirlpools, and hence comes the family name. This current brings particles of all sorts to the mouth near the rim of the bells, and the creature seems not entirely destitute of power to choose or reject the morsels according to its taste. Every now and then the stalk of some specimen is suddenly twisted into a spiral, and contracted, so as to bring the bell almost to the ground. Then the stem gracefully elongates again, and the cilia repeat their lively game.  The general effect can be seen very well by a power of about sixty linear, but one of them from one to two hundred is necessary to bring out the details, and a practised observer will use still more magnification with good effect. They should be examined by a moderately oblique light, or most of the cilia are apt to be rendered invisible, and also by _dark ground_ illumination. This may be accomplished in a well-made microscope by turning the mirror quite out of the plane of the axis of the instrument, that is to say, on one side of the space the body would occupy if it were prolonged. By this means, and by placing the lamp at an angle with the mirror, that must be learnt by experiment, all the light that reaches the eye has first passed through the object, and is refracted by it out of the line it was taking, which would have carried it entirely away. Or the object may be illuminated by an apparatus called a _spotted lens_, which is a small bull's-eye placed under the stage, and having all the centre of its face covered with a plaster of black silk. In this method the central or direct rays from the mirror are obstructed, but those which strike the edge of the bull's-eye are bent towards the object, which they penetrate and illuminate if it is sufficiently transparent and refractive. Another mode of dark ground illumination is by employing an elegant instrument called a _parabolic illuminator_, which need not be described.  [Illustration: Vorticella, with posterior circlet of cilia in process of separation, 300 linear.--_Stein._]  [Illustration: Vorticella in process of self-division. A new frontal wreath in formation in each of the semi-lunar spaces.]  Different specimens and species of _Vorticellæ_ vary in the length of their bells from one three or four thousandth to one hundred and twentieth of an inch, and when they are tolerably large, the dark ground illumination produces a beautiful effect. The bells shine with a pearly iridescent lustre, and their cilia flash with brilliant prismatic colours.  [Illustration: Vorticella microstoma, showing alimentary tube, ciliated mouth, and formation of a gemma at the base, 300 linear.--_Stein._]  [Illustration: Vorticella microstoma, the encysted animal protruding through a supposed rupture of the tunic.]  The _Vorticellina_ belong to the upper division of the _Protozoa_--the _ciliata_, or ciliated animalcules, and they have a mouth, an oesophagus, and an orifice for the exit of their food.  Many observers used to ascribe to those creatures a complete intestinal canal, but such an apparatus is now believed not to exist in any of the Infusoria. Food particles, after leaving the oesophagus, are thrust forward into the sarcode, or soft flesh, and any cavity thus formed acts as a stomach.  The bells or cups are not, as might be fancied from a casual inspection, open like wineglasses at the top, but furnished with a retractile disk or cover, on which the cilia are arranged. Their stalks are not simple stems, but are hollow tubes, which in the genus Vorticella are furnished with a muscular band, by whose agency the movements are principally made.  Some of the Vorticellids will be observed to leave their stalks, having developed cilia round their base, and may be seen to swim about in the enjoyment of individual life. They are also capable of becoming _encysted_, that is, of secreting a gelatinous cover.  [Illustration: Encysted Vorticella, showing the obliteration of special organs by the advancement of the process.--_Pritchard._]  These changes are exhibited in the annexed cuts, which are copied from known authorities. By careful observation of the bodies of Vorticellids, a contractile vesicle may be observed, which appears to cause a movement of fluids, that is probably connected either with respiration or secretion.  Another piece of apparatus in this family, but not confined to it, is the so-called _nucleus_, which in this case is of a horseshoe shape and granular texture, and greater solidity than the surrounding parts. The functions of this organ formed the subject of various conjectures, but it is now generally held to be an ovary.  [Illustration: Vorticella microstoma, in process of encystment, 300 linear; in the last the inclosing tunic is plainly developed.--_Stein._]  In common with many of the lower animals, the Vorticellids have three ways of multiplying their race. One by _fission_, or division of their bodies: another by _buds_, somewhat analogous to those of plants; and another by reproductive germs. These processes will come again under our notice, and we shall leave the Vorticellids for the present by observing that if they are fed with a very small quantity of indigo or carmine, the vacuoles or spaces, into which their nutriment passes, will be clearly observed. Ehrenberg thought in these and similar creatures that every vacuole was a distinct stomach, and that all the stomachs were connected by an intestinal canal; hence his name _Polygastrica_, or many stomached. In these views he has not been followed by later observers, and it is probable he was misled, partly by pushing the process of reasoning from the analogies of higher animals much too far, and partly by the imperfection of the glasses he employed.  [Illustration: Rotifer vulgaris.--A, mouth, or gizzard; B, contractile vesicle.--_Micrographic Dictionary._ N.B.--When the cilia and tail part are retracted, and the body shortened, the creature assumes an obtuse oval form.]  Having thus briefly considered the Vorticellids we must turn to the wheel-bearer, who belongs to a higher race than even the ciliated _Protozoa_. We left her crawling about with her snout or proboscis protruded, but now she has moored herself by her tail-foot, pulled in her nose, and put out two groups of cilia, which look like revolving wheels, and a little below them is seen a gizzard in a state of active work. After a little while she swims away with her wheels going, and her tail, forked at the end, is found to be telescopic, or capable of being pulled in and out. As the cilia play, the neighbouring water is agitated, and the multitudes of small objects are brought by the whirlpools within her ravenous maw. But the strangest thing of all is that inside her body is seen a young one; in this case a large and fine infant, which, like \"a chip of the old block,\" imitates the parental motions, thrusts forth its cilia and works its gizzard.[3] In other genera the eggs are hatched externally, but this one is ovoviparous, and carries its nursery inside.  [3] This was met with in the summer, but is described here to avoid repetition. I do not know whether the eggs are hatched in very cold weather.  A very slight investigation is sufficient to show that in the wheel-bearer we have made a great advance towards a higher organization than we discovered in the preceding creatures. We witness what the learned call a \"differentiation\" of parts"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36903"],["title","Marvels of Pond-life (#5)"],["body"," tissues, and a \"specialization\" of organs. The head is plainly distinguishable from the body, the skin or integument is distinctly different from the internal tissues, behind the eyes we can detect a nervous ganglion or miniature brain, the gizzard is a complicated piece of vital mechanism, such as we have not met with before, and in various parts of the transparent inside we see organs to which particular functions are assigned.  It was at one time thought that Rotifers were hermaphrodite--uniting both sexes in one body--but that idea is now generally abandoned, for in many species the males have been discovered, and the fair sex may be gratified to hear that they are without doubt the \"inferior animals.\" Their function is simply to assist the female in producing young, and as this can be quickly accomplished, their lives are short, and they are not supplied with the gizzard and digestive apparatus, which their lady-loves possess. Much discussion has taken place as to the rank which the Rotifers hold in the animal kingdom, some naturalists thinking them relations of the crabs, and others believing them to belong to the family of the worms. Professor Huxley, who adopts the latter view, which has the most friends, groups the lower _Annulosa_ together under the name of _Annuloida_, in which he includes _Annelides_, or worms of various kinds, the _Echinodermata_ (or \"spine skins,\" among which are the star-fish and sea hedgehogs), and some other families. He considers the Rotifers to be \"the permanent forms of Echinoderm larvæ.\" This does not mean that they were ever produced by Echinoderms, and had their development checked, but that they resemble them in organization, and illustrate a general law, observable in animated beings, namely, that the lower creatures are like the imperfect stages of higher animals, and that all things are formed according to general principles, and exhibit a uniformity of plan.  Mr. Gosse adopts a different view, and while admitting a connection between the Rotifers and the worms, adduces important reasons for associating them with the insects.  Leaving zoologists to settle their position, we may remark that the Rotifers form a very numerous family, presenting very great diversities of structure, some of the most interesting of which we shall meet with in the course of our rambles; but they all possess a gizzard, which, though differing in complexity, is throughout formed upon the same principle, and that we must now explain.  We have called the masticatory apparatus of the Rotifers a _gizzard_; but Mr. Gosse, who has done most to elucidate its structure, contends that it is a _mouth_; and in some species it is frequently protruded, and used like the mouth of higher animals. Taking one of the most typical forms of this organ, and drawing our illustrations from Mr. Gosse's admirable paper in the \"Transactions of the Royal Society,\" we may describe it, when completely developed, as consisting of three lobes, having a more or less rounded form. The eminent naturalist we have named calls the whole organ the _mastax_, and states that it is composed of dense muscular fibre. The tube which leads down to it he designates the \"buccal (mouth) funnel,\" and the tube that issues from it, and conveys the food to the digestive sac or stomach, he calls the _oesophagus_, in conformity with the nomenclature applied to creatures whose mouths are in the usual place. Inside the mouth-gizzard are placed two organs, which work like hammers, and which Mr. Gosse therefore names _mallei_. The hammers work against a sort of anvil, which is called _incus_, the Latin for that implement. Each hammer consists of two portions articulated by a hinge joint. The lower portion, the _manubrium_, or handle, gives motion to the upper portion, which from its shape is named the _uncus_, or hook. The _unci_ are furnished with finger-like processes of teeth, which vary in number. There are five or six in the best developed specimens. These hooks or teeth work against each other, and against the _incus_, or anvil, which consists of distinct articulated portions, of which the principal are two _rami_, or branches, jointed so that they can open and close like a pair of shears. These two rest upon the third portion, which is called the _fulcrum_. Some faint idea of the working of the toothed hammers may be obtained by rubbing the knuckles of both hands together, but the motion is more complicated, and the _rami_ play their part in the trituration of the food. Mr. Gosse states that when an objectionable morsel has got as far as this mouth-gizzard, \"it is thrown back by a peculiar scoop-like action of the _unci_, very curious to witness.\" The foregoing diagram will help the reader to comprehend this description, but no opportunity should be lost for viewing this remarkable organ busy at work in the living animals.  [Illustration: Gizzard of Notomata.]  The respiration of the Rotifers is supposed to be effected by the passage of water through vessels running round them, and called the \"water vascular system,\" and in addition to their eyes, which often disappear in adult specimens, the organ we described as standing out like a pig-tail, as our acquaintance crawled along, is thought to act as an _antenna_, or feeler, and brings its possessor in further relation to the external world. It is also called the _calcar_, or spur, and is furnished with cilia or bristles at its extremity.  Sometimes the particles swallowed by the Common Rotifer are large enough for their course to be traced, but there is frequently a great commotion and grinding of the gizzard, without any appreciable cause, although doubtless something is taken in, and when the creature is tired, or has had enough, we see both head and tail retracted, and the body assumes a globular form. In another chapter, when viewing a Philodine, we shall see how in the family to which the Common Rotifer belongs, the gizzard departs from the perfect type.     CHAPTER III.  FEBRUARY.

It has been a bitterly cold night, and as the sun shines on a clear keen morning, and glistens in the hoar-frost which covers the trees, it might seem an unpropitious time for visiting the ponds, in search of microscopic prey. We will, however, try our luck, and take a brisk trot to the top of Hampstead Heath, where the air is still keener, and the ice more thick. Arriving at the highest point, London appears on one side enveloped in its usual great coat of smoke, through which St. Paul's big dome, with a score or two of towers and steeples, can be dimly made out; while looking towards Harrow-on-the-Hill, or Barnet, we see the advantage of country air in the sharpness with which distant objects cut the blue sky. We leave the large ponds for another time, and hunt out the little hollows among the furze and fern. One looks promising from the bright green vegetation to be discovered under the sheet of ice, which is almost firm enough to bear human weight.  Breaking a convenient hole we hook up some of the water-plants, and place them in a wide-mouthed vial, which we fill with water, and cursorily examine with a pocket-lens. Some water-fleas briskly skipping about, and a beautiful little beetle, with an elegant dotted pattern on his brown back, and a glistening film of air covering his belly, show that we have not been unsuccessful, although we must wait till we get home to know the extent of our findings, among which, however, we can only discern the graceful spiral shell of a small water-snail, the _Planorbis_.  Arriving at home the bottle was left undisturbed for some hours in a warm light place, and then on being examined several specimens of that beautiful polyp, the _Hydra viridis_, were seen attached to the glass, and spreading their delicate tentacles in search of prey. One of the polyps is carefully removed by the _dipping-tube_, a small glass tube, open at both ends. The forefinger is placed upon the top, and when the other end is brought over the object the finger is raised for an instant, and as the water rushes in the little hydra comes too, and is placed in a glass cell, about half an inch wide, and one tenth of an inch deep. These cells are obtained from the opticians, and cemented with varnish or marine glue to an ordinary glass slide. After an object has been placed in one of them, a little water is taken up in the dipping-tube, and the cell filled until the fluid stands in a convex heap above its brim. We then select around glass cover, and press it gently on the walls of our cell. A few drops of superfluous water escape, and we have the cell quite full, and the cover held tight by force of the capillary attraction between the water and the glass.  [Illustration: _Hydra viridis_ with developed young one, and bud beginning to sprout.]  The polyp deposited in one of these water cages is then transferred to the stage of the microscope, and its proceedings watched. At first it looks like a shapeless mass of apple-green jelly. Soon, however, the tail end of the creature is fixed to the glass, the body elongates, and the tentacles (in this case eight) expand something after the manner of the leaves of a graceful palm.  By accident two small Water Fleas were imprisoned with the polyp, and one (a shrimp-like looking creature, carrying behind her a great bag of eggs) came into contact with the tentacles, and seemed paralysed for a time.
