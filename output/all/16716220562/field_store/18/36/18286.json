At the village of Wandre Rollo gave vent to a shout of delight. Standing outside an inn was an army wagon, and under its tilt, in company with a medley of other articles, were their motor-cycles.  \"Now, what's to be done?\" asked Rollo.  \"I vote we take them and make off as hard as we can,\" suggested Kenneth.  \"The soldiers in charge are evidently after more official loot.\"  \"Won't do,\" replied the cautious Rollo.  \"Ten to one we would hopelessly damage the bikes getting them off the wagon.  The best we can do is to tackle the fellow in charge.\"  \"The fellow in charge\" turned out to be a phlegmatic Walloon corporal. When appealed to he replied that he was acting under the orders of his lieutenant, and that he must account for all the articles on his list upon his return to Liége.  The production of Major Résimont's pass did not save the situation, although the Belgian's demeanour thawed considerably.  \"Nevertheless, if messieurs are English, perhaps they would like to ride on the wagon.  At Liége, no doubt, all will be set right,\" he added.  It was, fortunately, the last of that particular corporal's work, and he was at liberty to return without delay.  A sapper drove, the corporal sitting beside him on the box seat.  On the tail-board, with their backs against their precious motor-cycles, sat the two lads, another sapper keeping them company.  As the cart jolted through the village of Jupille there came a dull rumbling, like that of distant thunder.  \"Guns!\" exclaimed Rollo.  \"Thunder, I think,\" declared his chum.  The Belgian soldier, when questioned, merely remarked in matter-of-fact tones:  \"We are blowing up the bridges, monsieur.\"  The work of demolition had already begun.  The Belgian troops, with commendable forethought, had destroyed four bridges across the Meuse in order to delay the momentarily expected German advance.  Yet, on either side of the sluggish river, peasants were unconcernedly toiling in the fields.  As the wagon passed the loftily-situated and obsolete fort of La Chatreuse a round of cheering could be heard from the city of Liége. Presently the strains of \"La Brabançonne\"--the Belgian National Anthem--could be distinguished above the din.  The sapper began to grow excited.  \"All is well, messieurs,\" he exclaimed.  \"We are now ready for these Prussians.  Our Third Division has arrived.\"  Presently the head of the column of blue-greatcoated troops swung blithely along the road to take up positions in the newly-constructed trenches between Fort de Barchon and Fort de Fléron.  The men marched well, although covered with dust from head to foot; for during the previous forty-eight hours they had, by forced marches, covered more than eighty miles from Diest to their allotted positions at Liége. Yet, for some unaccountable reason, these troops went into what was soon to be the firing-line in blue tunics with white facings, which would offer a conspicuous target to their foes.  It was late in the afternoon when the cart drew up in a large open space by the side of the Church of St. Jacques.  The square was crowded with all kinds of military transport and commissariat wagons.  Officers were shouting orders, men were rushing hither and thither, motors were popping, horses neighing.  The corporal in charge of the wagon descended and stood rigidly at attention.  For quite a quarter of an hour he remained in this attitude, without any of the officers approaching to give him further directions.  The crowd of wagons became more congested, till Kenneth and Rollo realized that, should they regain possession of their mounts, there would be great difficulty in wheeling them out of the press.  Suddenly Kenneth gripped his friend's shoulder and pointed in the direction of a group of officers.  \"There's Major Résimont!\" he exclaimed.  \"He'll get us out of the fix.\"  \"Ah!  You have got yourselves in a difficulty again, that I can see,\" declared the genial Major.  \"What, then, is the trouble?\"  Briefly Kenneth described the commandeering of their motor-cycles.  \"I am indeed most busy,\" said Major Résimont, and the perspiration on his face did not belie this statement.  \"Nevertheless, come with me, and we will find the Quartermaster of the Commissariat.\"  He led the lads at a rapid pace through several crowded thoroughfares. At one point the press was so great as to impede their progress.  The Liégeois were shouting and cheering, cries of \"Vive la Belgique!\" and \"Vive l'Angleterre!\" predominating.  Outside a large building a Union Jack and the Belgian tricolour had been hoisted side by side.  A telegraphic communication had just been received that Great Britain had declared war on Germany.  \"Ah!  I thought it,\" chuckled the Major.  \"Now the Prussians will get the right-about.  My friends, the Germans are also now your enemies,\" and he shook Kenneth and Rollo by the hand.  \"What will you do?  Return to England and join the army?\"  \"We are not old enough for commissions, sir,\" replied Kenneth; then on the spur of the moment he added: \"Couldn't we be attached to the Belgian army as dispatch-riders?\"  Rollo almost gasped at his chum's impetuosity, but loyalty to his chum and a desire to do something against the oppressor of Europe checked his inclination to counsel caution.  \"We will see,\" said the Major gravely.  \"It is good to see such a spirit amongst Englishmen to come to the aid of our brave Belgians. You are resolute?\"  \"Rather!\" declared Kenneth stoutly; and Rollo likewise signified his willingness.  The Quartermaster having been found at his office, Major Résimont soon obtained the requisite order for the release of the Englishmen's motor-cycles.  \"Now, this way!\" he exclaimed.  Five minutes' brisk walk brought them to the door of a large building at which were stationed two soldiers in the uniform of the Grenadiers. These stood stiffly at attention as the Major entered, drawing themselves up with an alertness that was almost entirely lacking in most of the men of the line regiments.  Giving his name to a staff officer, the Major had to wait in an ante-room, with at least a dozen other officers, mostly of brevet rank. At length his turn came, for business was being carried out with dispatch.  \"Monsieur le Major Résimont, mon Général,\" announced a junior officer, as he opened the door and motioned for the Belgian Major and his two companions to enter.  Seated at a table was a man in the undress uniform of the Belgian staff.  He was sparely built, although from his attitude it was impossible to judge his height.  His features were sallow, one might almost say cadaverous, with a bright tinge of red upon his prominent cheek-bones.  Heavily-bushed eyebrows overhung a pair of deep-set eyes that seemed hawk-like in their intensity.  His closely-cropped hair was iron-grey.  A slightly drooping moustache hid a resolute mouth.  The two English lads were in the presence of a man whose name, hitherto practically unknown outside his own country, was soon to be on the lips of everyone who was likely to hear of the gallant stand of Liége--General Albert Leman.  A quick vertical motion of the General's right hand--he was a man of few words--was the signal for Major Résimont to make known his business.  \"I have here two Englishmen, mon Général,\" began the Major.  \"They are desirous of entering our army as motor-cyclist dispatch-riders.\"  Without a moment's delay the General asked: \"Can they read a map?\"  Kenneth and Rollo both replied that they could.  \"Good!\" exclaimed General Leman; then, turning to his secretary, he added: \"Make out an order for these gentlemen to be attached to the 9th regiment of the line--your company, Major?\"  \"If you please, sir.\"  \"Here, then, is the order,\" continued the General after a brief instant, during which the secretary had been writing as hard as he possibly could.  \"They can be sworn in as soon as an opportunity occurs.  I wish you good day.\"  That was all.  The whole business was over in less than five minutes. Not a word of thanks or encouragement to the two British volunteers.  A chill had descended upon their ardour.  \"The General--he is magnificent,\" said their companion as they gained the street.  \"Down to the humblest private we swear by him.  One has to earn praise from the General before it is bestowed: it is our General's way.  He is a man of few words, but his heart is in the right place. Now go and demand your motor-cycles and proceed to Fort de Barchon.  I will meet you there and see you are attested.\"  With that the Major hurried off, and the two lads hastened to take possession of their own property.  \"Fancy Great Britain being at war with Germany at last!\" exclaimed Kenneth.  \"We can hardly realize it, although most people have been talking about it for years.  Perhaps even now our fleet is giving the Germans a good hiding.  The rotten part about our job is that we may not be able to get news of how things are going on at home.\"  Therein Kenneth was right.  The news they received was mostly rumour. In fact, the statement they had just heard, that Great Britain had declared war, was premature.  An ultimatum had been sent to Berlin stating that, unless Belgian neutrality were respected, hostilities would commence at midnight.  The Liégeois had anticipated the hour, and so had the Germans, for already their mine-layers were at work in the North Sea.  An hour later, just as the sun was sinking behind the smoke-enshrouded city of Liége, Kenneth Everest and Rollo Barrington were enlisted as volunteer dispatch-riders in the 9th regiment of the line of the Belgian army.     CHAPTER V  A Baptism of Fire  At eight o'clock on the following morning the motorcyclist section--nine in number--was paraded in front of the orderly-room of Fort de Barchon.  Already the bulk of the regiments had marched out to take up a position in the trenches between the fortifications and the right bank of the Meuse.  The two English lads had been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36500"],["title","The Dispatch-Riders: The Adventures of Two British Motor-cyclists in the Great (#5)"],["body"," out with a dark-blue uniform, with heavy boots and brown gaiters, and had been armed with a Belgian service revolver--a .45-bore, made by the famous firm of Cockerill of Seraing.  Already they had been instructed in its use, and had--thanks to their cadet training--met with the approval of their musketry instructor. Their motor-cycles had also been subjected to a critical inspection. The officer--who in civil life had been in the motor industry at Liége--had to report, in spite of slight professional jealousy, that the English motor-cycles were fit for service, and almost equal to those owned by the other members of the dispatch-riding section.  One by one the men were called into the orderly-room, where they received instructions and dispatches, till only Kenneth and Rollo remained.  \"Private Ever-r-rest and Private Bar-r-rington,\" shouted the orderly-room sergeant, sounding his r's like the roll of a drum.  Within they found Major Résimont, and, as befitting their relative rank, the lads saluted and stood at attention.  \"Deliver this to Captain Leboeuf at Visé,\" ordered the Major.  \"In view of the German advance, he is to cross the river and impede the enemy as much as possible, retiring upon Fort de Pontisse if in danger of being outflanked.\"  Then dropping the official voice, he added in English, \"Since Madame de la Barre would pay no heed to my request, it is necessary for strategic reasons to occupy her house.  You may now have an opportunity of seeing your sister, Monsieur Everest.  There are, I believe, only our pupils there during the holidays.  Captain Leboeuf will arrange for them to be sent into Maastricht by train, or by a carriage if railway communication is interrupted.  They can then proceed to Brussels in the ordinary way.  You might give this to Mademoiselle Yvonne for incidental expenses for herself and her friend, your sister,\" and the Major handed Kenneth a packet containing a sheaf of notes.  \"Be cautious,\" he added.  \"The Germans have already advanced upon Lembourg.\"  The lads saluted and withdrew.  A minute later they were dashing over the drawbridge, bound on their first duty as dispatch-riders in the Belgian army, though with a semi-official motive.  Away on their right came the rapid booming of light artillery fire. Beyond the woods of Verviers a thick cloud of black smoke rose sullenly in the heavy air.  Their route lay along a fairly level road bounded on each side by tall trees.  In the centre was a strip of _pavé_, but between it and the ditch on either hand was a dusty path which afforded good going.  The cyclists were soon touching thirty miles an hour, the rapid beats of their engines drowning the noise of the distant cannonade.  Once they had to slow down in order to allow a cart to draw up on one side.  The floor of the cart was covered with straw, and on the straw lay some strange objects.  The lads did not realize what these burdens were.  They were new to the game of war, but not for long.  Presently they noticed a group of soldiers approaching.  Thrice the lads sounded their horns without effect.  Again they had to slow down.  \"Good heavens!  Look!\" ejaculated Kenneth.  The men were limping painfully.  One had his arm thrown around a comrade's neck, and his head falling limply upon the other's shoulder. Another, his head bound by a blood-stained scarf, was using the butt of his rifle as a crutch.  \"There's been an action already,\" said Rollo.  \"Yes, and on the Visé road,\" added his companion.  \"Let's push on.  I hope we are not too late.\"  During the slowing-down process the thunder of the guns became horribly distinct.  There was terrific firing in the direction of Argenteau. More, there were heavy Belgian losses, for the men they had just passed were but the van of a ghastly procession of wounded.  At Argenteau a body of reserves was in possession of the village. Barricades had been hastily constructed, walls of buildings loopholed, and barbed-wire entanglements placed across the road.  \"Halte-là!\"  Rollo came to a standstill with the point of a Belgian bayonet within a couple of inches of his chest.  Kenneth, who was twenty yards in the rear, almost as promptly alighted.  \"Qui v'là?\" demanded the sentry.  \"Dispatches for Captain Leboeuf,\" replied Kenneth.  The man recovered his arms.  \"May you have the good fortune to find him!\" said he.  \"Our troops have been compelled to fall back in the face of superior numbers.  Turn to the right, then take the first road to the left.  It will bring you back to the Visé road.\"  Following the sentry's direction the lads found that the route was still open, although soldiers and peasants were standing ready to barricade that exit.  A couple of miles farther on the motor-cyclists reached the firing-line--a comparatively weak detachment of infantry holding a hastily-constructed trench.  Overhead the shrapnel was flying, the iron hail for the most part bursting harmlessly in the rear.  On the left the great guns of Fort de Pontisse were shelling the dense masses of German troops as they vainly sought to cross the Meuse.  A shell, happily without exploding, struck the pave five yards from the spot where Kenneth dismounted, burying itself in a hole at least two feet in depth.  \"Into the ditch with the bikes,\" shouted Kenneth; and having assisted Rollo to place his steed in a place of comparative safety, he returned, and, helped by his companion, managed to shelter his own cycle.  \"What's to be done now?\" asked Rollo.  \"See if the Captain is with these men.  We must hasten: it will be a jolly sight safer in the trench.\"  Abandoning their motor-cycles, the two lads made their way along the ditch, which fortunately ran with considerable obliquity to the direction of the fire of the German artillery.  At length they reached the trench where the Belgian infantry, taking admirable cover, were replying steadily to the hail of ill-directed rifle bullets.  The only unwounded officer was a slim young lieutenant--a mere boy.  \"We have dispatches for Captain Leboeuf, sir,\" announced Kenneth.  \"He was in charge of an outpost at Visé.\"  \"Visé is all aflame,\" replied the officer.  \"No doubt the Captain has crossed the Meuse.  But we are about to retire, so look to yourselves. The enemy is threatening our right flank, otherwise we might hold this trench for another twenty-four hours.\"  \"Any orders, sir, before we return to Fort de Barchon?\"  \"Yes; ride as quickly as you can to Saint André.  The rest of our company is there.  Tell the officer in command that I am retiring, and that unless he falls back he is in danger of being cut off.  You understand?  Good, now----\"  The lieutenant's instructions ended in a faint shriek.  His hands flew to his chest, and he pitched forward on his face.  A grizzled colour-sergeant instantly took command.  \"Retire by sections!\" he shouted.  \"Steady, men, no hurry.  Keep them back as long as you can.\"  The caution was in vain.  While the untried troops were lining the trench and replying to the German fire, all went well; but at the order to retire, men broke and ran for their lives.  Heedless of the cover afforded by the ditch, they swarmed along the road in the direction of Argenteau, shrapnel and bullet accounting for half their numbers.  Only the sergeant, two corporals, and the British dispatch-riders remained.  The Germans, advancing in close formation, were now eight hundred yards off.  Without a word the Belgian sergeant crawled along the trench, picking up the rifles and caps of the slain and placing them at intervals along the top of the mound; while the rest, including Kenneth and Rollo, who had taken possession of a couple of abandoned rifles, maintained a rapid magazine fire at the approaching troops.  \"Each for himself, mes enfants,\" said the veteran at length.  \"One at a time and trust to luck.\"  With that a corporal cast aside his greatcoat and heavy knapsack.  He was about to make a plunge through the zone of hissing bullets when Kenneth stopped him.  \"There's a ditch farther along,\" he announced.  \"We came that way.\"  The man hesitated, then, communicated the news to his sergeant.  \"Come then, mes braves,\" exclaimed the veteran.  One by one, crawling along the ditch the five made their way, till they gained the comparative shelter afforded by the walls of a ruined cottage.  Proof against bullets, the house had been practically demolished by shell-fire.  \"We must go back and get our bikes,\" declared Kenneth.  \"It's fairly safe.  Those fellows are apparently directing their fire against those caps and rifles showing above the trench.\"  They found their steeds uninjured.  In record time they were in the saddle and tearing along the avenue, which here and there was dotted with dead Belgians.  The wounded had evidently been carried off by their comrades.  As they passed the ruined cottage where they had parted from the three soldiers the latter were no longer to be seen, but a hoarse cry of \"A moi, camarades!\" caused Rollo to turn.  He alone caught the appeal, for Kenneth had secured a slight start and the noise of his engine had drowned the shout for aid.  \"Hold on!\" shouted Rollo; but Kenneth, unaware of the call, was out of ear-shot, and doing a good thirty or forty miles an hour.  Leaving his engine still running, Rollo dismounted and made his way towards the building.  Shots were whistling overhead.  He crouched as he hastened, for he had not yet acquired the contempt for the screech of a bullet that the old soldier has, knowing that with the whizzing of the missile that particular danger has passed.  Lying against the bullet-spattered wall was the old sergeant.  A fragment of shrapnel, rebounding from the masonry, had fractured his left ankle.  There was no time for first-aid.  The Germans were now within three hundred yards of the abandoned trench.  Throwing his arms round the sergeant's body, Rollo lifted him from the ground, then kneeling, he managed to transfer him across his back.  Fortunately"]]]
