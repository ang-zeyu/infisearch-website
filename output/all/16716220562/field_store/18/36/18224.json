But the associates reckoned without their host. \"They no longer considered their articles towards the king, Monseigneur le Prince, and me,\" writes Champlain, \"and they esteem as nothing the contracts and promises which they have signed.\" So he wrote first to the company, and then went to Rouen (the chief seat of the company), with all his followers; there he produced their articles, and showed them that, as lieutenant of the prince, he had the right to command the settlement, and all the people there, or who might be sent, saving their chief clerk and people of the magazine, so far as trading affairs went; and as for discoveries, they were not to make laws for him; that he should set about them whenever circumstances should seem to him propitious, as he had done before; and that he was not obliged to do anything that was not in the articles, and they said nothing about discoveries. As for Du Pont-Gravé, he was his friend, and he respected him as a father; but that he would not suffer that which by right belonged to him (Champlain) to be given to another; that the pains, risks, and fortunes of life which he had incurred in the discoveries of lands and people, of which they derived the benefit, had gained him the honours which he possessed; that Du Pont-Gravé and he had always lived together in good friendship, and he wished to continue on the same terms; but he would not make the voyage, save with the same authority as before. Moreover, he would render the company liable for all expenses, damages, and interests that might be occasioned by delay; \"and upon that,\" he adds, \"I presented to them this letter from his majesty:--      \"BY THE KING.      \"Dear and well-beloved:--On the report made to us that there has     hitherto been bad management in the establishment of the families     and workmen sent to the settlement of Quebec, and other places of     New France; We write to you this letter, to declare to you our     desire that all things should proceed better in future; and to tell     you, that it will give us pleasure that you should assist, as much     as you conveniently can, the Sieur Champlain in the things     requisite and necessary for the execution of the commands which he     has received from us, to choose experienced and trusty men to be     employed in the discovery, inhabiting, cultivating, and sowing the     lands; and do all the works which he shall judge necessary for the     establishment of the colonies which we desire to plant in the said     country, for the good of the service and the use of our subjects;     without, however, on account of the said discoveries and     settlements, your factors, clerks, and agents in the traffic of     peltry, being troubled or hindered in any way whatever during the     term which we have granted you. And fail not in this, for such is     our pleasure. Given at Paris the 12th day of March, 1618.      (Signed)       \"LOUIS.     (And below)    \"POTIER.\"  This letter, it might be supposed, would have settled the matter, but the associates were stiff-necked; so Champlain made his protest and proceeded to Paris. The vessel sailed without him, and Du Pont-Gravé commanded, and wintered that year at the settlement, while Champlain pleaded his rights before the king and the Council of State. \"Nous voilà à chicaner,\" says he; and with his characteristic activity and energy, he followed the council to Tours, and, after many and long debates, obtained a judgment, ordering that he should have the command, not only at Quebec, but over all other settlements in New France, and prohibiting the company from troubling or interfering with him in the functions of his charge, under penalty of damages, fines, expenses, etc.; \"and which judgment,\" he adds, \"I caused to be signified to the associates in full Exchange at Rouen: they threw the blame on Boyer, saying they had not consented, but I knew better.\" About this time Monseigneur the Prince de Condé, with the king's permission, resigned the viceroyalty of New France to the Duc de Montmorency, high-admiral of France, who seems to have paid a round sum for the honour.[19] Champlain was continued in the lieutenancy of the country, and was ordered by the new viceroy to proceed to Quebec, to fortify himself there as well as he could, and to let him know all that should occur, so that he might take order accordingly. Monsieur Dolu, Grand Audiencier of France, an able and well-meaning man, was named intendant of the province, \"who,\" says Champlain, \"burned with ardour to do something for the advancement of the glory of God, the good of the country, and to place our society in a better position to do well than heretofore. I saw him on the matter, and gave him a memoir for his instruction.\"        [19] In the beginning of 1620, the Duke de Montmorency was       created viceroy and lieutenant-general of New France and the       neighbouring islands and coasts, from Florida along the sea coast       to the Arctic circle; to the west, from Newfoundland to the Great       Lake, called the Freshwater Sea (Lake Superior), with all the       lands adjoining the rivers which flow into the St. Lawrence, or       Great River of Canada; the ports of Tadoussac and of Quebec,       etc., etc.  Champlain accordingly left Paris with his family, and everything necessary for the voyage, but at Honfleur the company, grievously annoyed at the overthrow of their plans, again made some difficulties about the command which he was to exercise. He immediately wrote to the viceroy and to the new intendant, Monsieur Dolu, who sent instantly peremptory notice to the associates, \"that the king and governor had determined that Champlain should have the entire and absolute command in the colony, and over all and everything in it, excepting always their mere merchandise, of which their people might dispose; and if they would not obey the orders of his majesty, Champlain was to stop their ships till the said orders were executed;\" which at last brought them to their senses.  At the same time the king did Champlain the honour to write to him, with his own hand, the following letter.      \"Champlain,--Having been informed of the commands which you have     received from my cousin, the Duke, of Montmorency, admiral of     France, and my viceroy in New France, to proceed to the said     country and be his lieutenant, and care for all that shall present     itself for the good of my service, I have been pleased to write you     this letter to assure you, that the services that you may render me     on this occasion will be very agreeable to me, above all if you     maintain the said country in its obedience to me, causing the     people there to live, as much as you can, in conformity with the     laws of my kingdom, and taking requisite care for the Catholic     religion, in order, by that means, to attract the Divine     benediction on you, which will cause your undertakings and actions     to succeed, to the glory of God, whom I pray to have you in His     holy keeping.                  7  \"LOUIS.     (And below)    \"BRULART.      \"Written at Paris, the 7th day of May 1620.\"  In the course of May 1620, Champlain at last again set sail for New France with his family, and after being nearly two months at sea, cast anchor in July opposite the mill of Baudé, about a league from Tadoussac, where, as usual, his first care was to return thanks to God for the preservation of himself and his family, who had suffered much from the perils of a bad voyage. He found there a vessel, on board of which was his wife's brother, the Sieur Boullé, who was greatly surprised at seeing his sister, marvelling how she had ventured to pass the dangerous sea. Champlain also learned that the old opponents of the company, the Rochelle people, had sent two vessels, of seventy and eighty-five tons respectively, to trade, in spite of the king's prohibition; that they had obtained a great quantity of peltry and other merchandise, and, what was worse, had supplied the natives with firearms and powder and ball.  Champlain is very bitter against the Rochellois (who were Protestants), calling them \"meschans larrons\"--wicked rascals, \"who came into the country to suborn the savages, and hold very pernicious and bad discourse about our religion, in order to render us odious!\"  On the 11th of July Champlain left Tadoussac for Quebec, with his family, three missionaries, whom he had brought out with him, his brother-in-law, Boullé, and Guers, his commissary, and immediately on arriving he proceeded to the chapel to give thanks to God. On the morrow, after mass, \"a sermon of exhortation\" was preached by a Recollet father, explaining to all their duty towards the king and the Duke de Montmorency, and to Champlain as their lieutenant; after which Guers, the commissary, read publicly the king's and the viceroy's commissions, appointing Champlain to the sole command of the colony; \"which being done, every one cried 'Vive le roy,' the cannon was fired in token of joy, and thus I took possession of the settlement and the country.\"  Champlain, thus fairly installed in his government, immediately bestirred himself to bring matters to some state of order, which, during his absence in France, had fallen into confusion and neglect,--the buildings almost in ruins, the gardens unenclosed, and the land"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36249"],["title","Among the Canadian Alps (#0)"],["body","[Illustration]  BERG LAKE AND TUMBLING GLACIER  _R.

mighty, snow-capped sea of mountains, whose stupendous waves tossed far into the heavens seem ever about to overwhelm the level wheat-fields of Western Canada? The lure of the mountains defies analysis, but it is surely there with its irresistible appeal to all in whom the spirit of romance is not quite dead. It stirs the blood strangely when, far out on the plains of Alberta, you get your first glimpse of the Canadian Alps--a line of white, glittering peaks just above the horizon, infinitely remote and ethereal, something altogether apart from the prosaic world about you of grain and cattle, neat farm-house and unsightly elevator.  As you follow the course of the sun, the peaks loom gradually up into the sky and dominate the scene, but still retain the atmosphere of another world. The rolling foothills in the foreground, like spent waves from the storm-tossed sea, seem tangible and comprehensible, but beyond and above the dark ramparts of the outer range, the towering outer wave of the mountains, float silvery outlines that seem to be the fabric of some other and purer world. Doubt may come with the marvellously clear and hardening light of the western day, but at sunrise, and peculiarly at sunset, the last shreds of uncertainty are swept away. Not of this earth is that dream of fairyland poised mysteriously in the upper air, glowing in exquisite tints, soft as a summer cloud; a realm of the spirit to which one might hope to journey over the path of a rainbow.  One who has seen this vision may not resist the insistent call to explore the mountain world, to discover what lies beyond the frowning battlements that guard this other realm. The call has been working in the hearts of men for generations. They came alone in the early days, each man fighting his way up through some doorway that led into the heart of the Glittering Mountains. Only the stout of heart might then win through, for this Wonderland was guarded close on every side. Pitfalls awaited the unwary. The explorer must cut his own trail through the wilderness, cross icy torrents, climb alpine passes, find a way through networks of fallen timber, face perils and discomforts every hour of the day. And yet there was something alluring, something that drew him on, and brought him back again to these high fastnesses; something that he could not understand, but that was none the less imperative. That same spell is as potent to-day, but most of the barriers are down, and where once men came singly or in twos and threes, paying heavily in labour and peril for the joys they found in the mountains, thousands now follow at just enough cost to themselves to give spice to the experience.  The history of the Canadian "]]]
