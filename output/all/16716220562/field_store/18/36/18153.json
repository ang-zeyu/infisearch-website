Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Mikroskopie, XIII, 1896.)   31. The sliding microscope is an instrument by means of      which very large microscope sections, as, for example,      large sections of the brain, can be systematically      examined. It is also of service in looking over plate      cultures of bacteria.       The microscope is carried on a heavy beam supported      by two stout pillars under which the stage      moves. The various movements are accomplished by      motion of the microscope on a lateral track upon      its support and by motion of the stage on a similar      track at right angles to the first. The motion of the      microscope is by means of a screw, that of the stage      by double rack and pinion. The extent of the movements      is indicated in each case by a scale, thus      permitting the systematic examination of the entire      specimen.       The stage consists of a glass plate, measuring      16×20 cm, which is carried in a frame supported on      four columns. The tracks permit a motion of the      microscope of 18 cm and of the stage of 13,5 cm. A      mirror under the stage affords ample illumination.       The microscope tube is so arranged that it can be      easily removed from the stand and a simple lens substituted      for it. The coarse adjustment of the microscope      is by rack and pinion. A screw above the objective      serves for fine adjustment.

It is provided       with all the adjustments of Stand No. V, consisting of       fine adjustment by micrometer-screw, coarse adjustment       by rack and pinion and illuminating apparatus d (p. 22).       The box is arranged so as to accommodate three       objectives and two oculars. It locks, has a handle, and       measures 25×15×7 cm, the whole apparatus weighing 5       pounds.

(Size of mahogany case 28×19×8 cm.)]  This instrument (in size like the Ib.) combines all the essential features of a large laboratory microscope with a folding stand. It will be found invaluable on scientific expeditions, for research work etc.  When lifted out of the case, spread the two parts forming the base, which are then held by a spring-catch. After raising the tube, turn the stage around and tighten it by means of a lever. It is supplied with large Abbe condenser and Iris diaphragm adjustable by side screw. Coarse adjustment by rack and pinion, fine adjustment by micrometer-screw. Graduated draw-tube. The stand has joint for inclination.
