[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35374"],["title","The Dreamers: A Club (#1)"],["body"," say, what's the matter with our inducing dreams and then putting 'em down?\"  That was the scheme in a nutshell--to induce dreams and put them down. The receipt was a simple one. The club was to meet once a month, and eat and drink \"such stuff as dreams are made of\"; the meeting was then to adjourn, the members going immediately home and to bed; the dreams of each were to be carefully noted in their every detail, and at the following meeting were to be unfolded such soul-harrowing tales as might with propriety be based thereon. An important part of the programme was a stenographer, whose duty it would be to take down the stories as they were told and put them in type-written form, which Dobbs was sure he had heard an editor say was one of the first steps towards a favorable consideration by professional readers of the manuscripts of the ambitious.  \"I am told,\" said he, \"that many a truly meritorious production has gone unpublished for years because the labor of deciphering the author's handwriting proved too much for the reader's endurance--and it is very natural that it should be so. A professional reader is, after all, only human, and when to the responsibilities of his office is added the wearisome task of wading through a Spencerian morass after the will-o'-wisp of an idea, I don't blame him for getting impatient. Why, I saw the original manuscript of one of Charles Dickens's novels once, and I don't see how any one knew it was good enough to publish until it got into print!\"  \"That's simply a proof of what I've always said,\" observed one of the Snobbe boys. \"If Charles Dickens's works had been written by me, no one would ever have published them.\"  \"I haven't a doubt of it,\" returned Billy Jones of the _Oracle_, dryly. \"Why, Snobbey, my boy, I believe if you had written the plays of Shakespeare they'd have been forgotten ages ago!\"  \"So do I,\" returned Snobbe, innocently. \"This is a queer world.\"  \"The stenographer will save us a great deal of trouble,\" said Bedford. \"The hard part of literary work is, after all, the labor of production in a manual sense. These real geniuses don't have to think. Their ideas come to them, and they let 'em develop themselves. In realistic writing, as I understand it, the author sits down with his pen in his hand and his characters in his mind's eye, and they simply run along, and he does the private-detective act--follows after them and jots down all they do. In imaginative writing it's done the same way. The characters of these ridiculous beings we read of are quite as real to the imaginative writer as the characters of the realist are to the latter, and they do supernatural things naturally. So you see these things require very little intellectual labor. It's merely the drudgery of chasing a commonplace or supernatural set of characters about the world in order to get 400 pages full of reading-matter about 'em that makes the literary profession a laborious one. Our stenographer will enable us to avoid all this. There isn't a man of us but can talk as easily as he can fall off a log, and a tale once told at our dinners becomes in the telling a bit of writing.\"  \"But, my dear Parke,\" said Billy Jones of the _Oracle_, who had been a \"literary journalist,\" as his fond grandmother called it, for some years, \"a story told is hardly likely to be in the form calculated to become literature.\"  \"That's just what we want you for, Billy,\" Bedford replied. \"You know how to give a thing that last finishing-touch which will make it go, where otherwise it might forever remain a fixture in the author's pigeon-hole. When our stories are told and type-written, we want you to go over them, correct the type-writer's spelling, and make whatever alterations you may think, after consulting with us, to be necessary. Then, if the tales are ever published as a collection, you can have your name on the title-page as editor.\"  \"Thanks,\" answered Billy, gratefully. \"I shall be charmed.\"  And then he hurried back to his apartments, and threw himself on his bed in a paroxysm of laughter which seemed never-ending, but which in reality did not last more than three hours at the most.  Hudson Rivers of Hastings, when the idea was suggested to him, was the most enthusiastic of all--so enthusiastic that the Snobbe boys thought that, in their own parlance, he ought to be \"called down.\"  \"It's bad form to go crazy over an idea,\" they said. \"If Huddy's going to behave this way about it, he ought to be kept out altogether. It is all very well to experience emotions, but no well-bred person ever shows them--that is, not in Yonkers.\"  \"Ah, but you don't understand Huddy,\" said Tenafly Paterson. \"Huddy has two great ambitions in this life. One is to get into the Authors' Club, and the other is to marry a certain young woman whose home is in Boston and whose ambitions are Bostonian. To appear before the world as a writer, which the Dreamers will give him a chance to do at small expense, will help him on to the realization of his most cherished hopes; in fact, Huddy told me that he thought we ought to publish the proceedings of the club at least four times a year, so establishing a quarterly magazine, to which we shall all be regular contributors. He thinks it will pay for itself, and knows it will make us all famous, because Billy Jones is certain to see that everything that goes out is first chop, and I'm inclined to believe Huddy is right. The continual drip, drip, drip of a drop of water on a stone will gradually wear away the stone, and, by Jove! before we know it, by constant hammering away at this dream scheme of ours we'll gain a position that won't be altogether unenviable.\"  \"That's so,\" said Billy. \"I wouldn't wonder if with the constant drip, drip, drip of your drops of ink and inspiration you could wear the public out in a very little while. The only troublesome thing will be in getting a publisher for your quarterly.\"  \"I haven't any idea that we want a publisher,\" said Bedford Parke. \"We've got capital enough among ourselves to bring the thing out, and so I say, what's the use of letting anybody else in on the profits? A publisher wouldn't give us more than ten per cent. in royalties. If we publish it ourselves we'll get the whole thing.\"  \"Yes,\" assented Tom Snobbe, \"and, what's more, it will have a higher tone to it if we can say on the title-page 'Privately printed,' eh? That'll make everybody in society want one for his library, and everybody not in society will be crazy to get it because it's aristocratic all through.\"  \"I hadn't thought of that,\" said Billy Jones. \"I've no doubt you are right, only I'd think you'd sell more copies if you'd also put on the title-page 'For circulation among the élite only.' Then every man, woman, or child who happened to get a copy would take pride in showing it to others, who would immediately send for it, because not having it would seem to indicate that one was not in the swim.\"  Nor were the others to whom the proposition was advanced any less desirous to take part. They saw, one and all, opportunities for a very desirable distinction through the medium of the Dreamers, and within two weeks of the original formation of the plan the club was definitely organized. Physicians were consulted by the various members as to what edibles contained the properties most likely to produce dreams of the nature desired, and at the organization meeting all but Billy Jones were well stocked with suggestions for the inauguration dinner. Hudson Rivers was of the opinion that there should be six courses at that dinner, each one of Welsh-rabbit, but varying in form, such as Welsh-rabbit purée, for instance, in which the cheese should have the consistency of pea-soup rather than of leather; such as Welsh-rabbit pâté, in which the cheese should rest within walls of pastry instead of lying quiescent and inviting like a yellow mantle upon a piece of toast; then a Welsh-rabbit roast; and so on all through the banquet, rabbit upon rabbit, the whole washed down with the accepted wines of the ordinary banquet, which experience had taught them were likely in themselves to assist in the work of dream-making.  [Illustration: AND SO TO DREAM]  Monty St. Vincent observed that he had no doubt that the Welsh-rabbit dinner would work wonders, but he confessed his inability to see any reason why the club should begin its labors by committing suicide. He added that, for his part, he would not eat six Welsh rabbits at one sitting if he was sure of Shakespeare's immortality as his reward, because, however attractive immortality was, he preferred mortality in the flesh to the other in the abstract. If the gentlemen would begin the meal with a grilled lobster apiece, he suggested, going thence by an easy stage to a devilled bird, rounding up with a \"slip-on\"--which, in brief, is a piece of mince-pie smothered in a blanket of molten cheese--he was ready to take the plunge, but further than this he would not go. The other members were disposed to agree with Monty. They thought the idea of eating six Welsh rabbits in a single evening was preposterous, and that in making such a suggestion Huddy was inspired by one of but two possible motives--that he wished to leap to the foremost position in imaginative literature at one bound, or else was prompted, by jealousy of what the others might do, to wish to kill the club at its very start. Huddy denied these aspersions upon his motives with vociferous indignation, and to show his sincerity readily acquiesced in the adoption of Monty St. Vincent's menu as already outlined.  The date of the dinner was set, Billy Jones was made master of ceremonies, the dinner was ordered, and eaten amid scenes of such revelry as was possible in the presence of the Snobbe boys, to whom anything in the way of unrestrained enjoyment was a bore and bad form, and at its conclusion the revellers went straight home to bed and to dream.  Two weeks later they met again over viands of a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35374"],["title","The Dreamers: A Club (#2)"],["body","digestible nature than those which lent interest to the first dinner, and told the tales which follow. And I desire to add here that my report of this dinner and the literature there produced is based entirely upon the stenographer's notes, coupled with additional information of an interesting kind furnished me by my friend William Jones, Esq., Third Assistant Exchange Editor of _The Weekly Oracle, a Journal of To-day, Yesterday, and To-morrow_.     II  IN WHICH THOMAS SNOBBE, ESQ., OF YONKERS, UNFOLDS A TALE   The second dinner of the Dreamers had been served, all but the coffee, when Mr. Billy Jones, of the _Oracle_, rapped upon the table with a dessert-spoon and called the members to order.  \"Gentlemen,\" said he, when all was quiet, \"we have reached the crucial crisis of our club career. We have eaten the stuff of which our dreams were to be made, and from what I can gather from the reports of those who are now seated about this festal board--and I am delighted to note that the full membership of our organization is here represented--there is not a single one of you who is unprepared for the work we have in hand, and, as master of ceremonies, it becomes my pleasant duty to inform you that the hour has arrived at which it behooveth us to begin the narration of those tales which--of those tales which I am certain--yes, gentlemen, very certain--will cause the unlaid ghosts of those masters of the story-tellers' art--\"  \"Is this a continued story Billy is giving us?\" observed Tenafly Paterson.  \"No,\" replied Bedford Parke, with a laugh; \"it is only a life sentence.\"  \"Get him to commute it!\" ejaculated Hudson Rivers.  \"Order, gentlemen, order!\" cried the master of ceremonies, again rapping upon the table. \"The members will kindly not interrupt the speaker. As I was saying, gentlemen,\" he continued, \"we are now to listen to the narration of tales which I am convinced will cause the unlaid ghosts of the past grand masters of the story-tellers' art to gnash their spirit teeth with anguish for that they in life failed to realize the opportunities that were theirs in not having told the tales to which we are about to listen, and over which, when published, the leading living literary lights will writhe in jealousy.\"  When the applause which greeted these remarks had subsided, Mr. Jones resumed:  \"That there may be no question of precedence among the gifted persons from whom we are now to hear, I have provided myself with a small leathern bottle, such as is to be seen in most billiard-parlors, within which I have placed twelve numbered ivory balls. These I will now proceed to distribute among you. When you receive them, I request that you immediately return them to me, that I may arrange the programme according to your respective numbers.\"  Mr. Jones thereupon distributed the ivory balls, and when the returns had been made, according to his request, he again rose to his feet and announced that to Mr. Thomas Snobbe, of Yonkers, had fallen the lot of telling the first story, adding that he took great pleasure in the slightly supererogative task that devolved upon him of presenting Mr. Snobbe to his audience. Mr. Snobbe's health was drunk vociferously, after which, the stenographer having announced himself as ready to begin, the distinguished son of Yonkers arose and told the following story, which he called    VAN SQUIBBER'S FAILURE  [Illustration: THE DREAMERS DINE]  You can't always tell what kind of a day you are going to have in town in October just because you happen to have been in town on previous October days, and Van Squibber, for that reason, was not surprised when his man, on waking him, informed him that it was cold out. Even if he had been surprised he would not have shown it, for fear of demoralizing his man by setting him a bad example. \"We must take things as they come,\" Van Squibber had said to the fellow when he engaged him, \"and I shall expect you to be ready always for any emergency that may arise. If on waking in the morning I call for a camel's-hair shawl and a bottle of Nepaul pepper, it will be your duty to see that I get them without manifesting the slightest surprise or asking any questions. Here is your next year's salary in advance. Get my Melton overcoat and my box, and have them at the Rahway station at 7.15 to-morrow morning. If I am not there, don't wait for me, but come back here and boil my egg at once.\"  This small bit of a lecture had had its effect on the man, to whom thenceforth nothing was impossible; indeed, upon this very occasion he demonstrated to his employer his sterling worth, for when, on looking over Van Squibber's wardrobe, he discovered that his master had no Melton overcoat, he telegraphed to his tailor's and had one made from his previous measure in time to have it with Van Squibber's box at the Rahway station at the stipulated hour the following morning. Of course Van Squibber was not there. He had instructed his man as he had simply to test him, and, furthermore, the egg was boiled to perfection. The test cost Van Squibber about $150, but it was successful, and it was really worth the money to know that his man was all that he should be.  \"He's not half bad,\" said Van Squibber, as he cracked the egg.  \"It's wintry,\" said Van Squibber's man on the morning of the 5th of October.  \"Well,\" Van Squibber said, sleepily, \"what of that? You have your instructions as to the bodily temperature I desire to maintain. Select my clothing, as usual--and mark you, man, yesterday was springy, and you let me go to the club in summery attire. I was two and a half degrees too warm. You are getting careless. What are my engagements to-day?\"  \"University settlement at eleven, luncheon at the Actors' at one, drive with the cynical Miss Netherwood at three, five-o'clock tea at four--\"  \"What?\" cried Van Squibber, sharply.  \"At fuf--five, I should say, sir,\" stammered the embarrassed man.  \"Thought so,\" said Van Squibber. \"Proceed, and be more careful. The very idea of five-o'clock tea at four is shocking.\"  \"Dinner with the Austrian ambassador at eight, opera at eleven--\"  \"In October? Opera?\" cried Van Squibber.  \"Comic,\" said the man. \"It is Flopper's last night, sir, and you are to ring down the curtain.\"  \"True,\" said Van Squibber, meditatively--\"true; I'd forgotten. And then?\"  \"At midnight you are to meet Red Mike at Cherry Street and Broadway to accompany him to see how he robs national banks, for the _Sunday Whirald_.\"  \"What bank is it to be?\"  \"The Seventeenth National.\"  \"Gad!\" cried Van Squibber, \"that's hard luck. It's my bank. Wire Red Mike and ask him to make it the Sixteenth National, at once. Bring me my smoking-jacket and a boiled soda mint drop. I don't care for any breakfast this morning. And, by-the-way, I feel a little chilly. Take a quinine pill for me.\"  \"Your egg is ready, sir,\" said the man, tremulously.  \"Eat it,\" said Van Squibber, tersely, \"and deduct the Café Savarin price of a boiled egg from your salary. How often must I tell you not to have my breakfast boiled until I am boil--I mean ready until I am ready for it?\"  The man departed silently, and Van Squibber turned over and went to sleep.  An hour later, having waited for his soda mint drop as long as his dignity would permit, Van Squibber arose and dressed and went for a walk in Central Park. It was eccentric of him to do this, but he did it nevertheless.  \"How Travers would laugh if he saw me walking in Central Park!\" he thought. \"He'd probably ask me when I'd come over from Germany,\" he added. And then, looking ahead, a thing Van Squibber rarely did, by-the-way--for you can't always tell by looking ahead what may happen to you--his eyes were confronted by a more or less familiar back.  \"Dear me!\" he said. \"If that isn't Eleanor Huyler's back, whose back is it, by Jove?\"  Insensibly Van Squibber quickened his pace. This was also a thing he rarely did. \"Haste is bad form,\" he had once said to Travers, who, on leaving Delmonico's at 7.20, seemed anxious to catch the 7.10 train for Riverdale. Insensibly quickening his pace, he soon found himself beside the owner of the back, and, as his premonitions had told him, it was Eleanor Huyler.  \"Good-morning,\" he said.  \"Why, Mr. Van Squibber!\" she replied, with a terrified smile. \"You here?\"  \"Well,\" returned Van Squibber, not anxious to commit himself, \"I think so, though I assure you, Miss Huyler, I am not at all certain. I seem to be here, but I must confess I am not quite myself this morning. My man--\"  \"Yes--I know,\" returned the girl, hastily. \"I've heard of him. He is your _alter ego_.\"  \"I had not noticed it,\" said Van Squibber, somewhat nonplussed. \"I think he is English, though he may be Italian, as you suggest. But,\" he added, to change the subject, \"you seem disturbed. Your smile is a terrified smile, as has been already noted.\"  \"It is,\" said Miss Huyler, looking anxiously about her.  \"And may I ask why?\" asked Van Squibber, politely--for to do things politely was Van Squibber's ambition.  \"I--I--well, really, Mr. Van Squibber,\" the girl replied, \"I am always anxious when you are about. The fact is, you know, the things that happen when you are around are always so very extraordinary. I came here for a quiet walk, but now that you have appeared I am quite certain that something dramatic is about to occur. You see--you--you have turned up so often at the--what I may properly call, I think, the nick of time, and so rarely at any other time, that I feel as though some disaster were impending which you alone can avert.\"  \"And what then?\" said Van Squibber, proudly. \"If I am here, what bodes disaster?\"  \"That is the question I am asking myself,\" returned Miss Huyler, whose growing anxiety was more or less painful to witness. \"Can your luck hold out? Will your ability as an averter of danger hold out? In short, Mr. Van Squibber, are you infallible?\"  The question came to Van Squibber like a flash of lightning out of a clear sky. It was too pertinent."]]]
