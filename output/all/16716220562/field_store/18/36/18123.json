It will take days to fully realize it, and then she will struggle and grow strong. God in his mercy helps the poor human hearts that suffer, struggle, and grow strong in these sad years of warfare! No one came now--no word to show that life still throbbed in the silent city.  The fresh air told of the coming morning: the guns were still. Peace for a short time reigned in the troubled city; and, in the perfect quiet that prevailed, my eyes grew heavy, and I once more sought my bed--this time to rest peacefully until the cheerful morning light dawned upon us.     CHAPTER XV.  AN EXCITEMENT--SINKING OF THE CINCINNATI--SKY PARLOR HILL--MOVING PROSPECTS.   With the dawn came the old unrest and distrust, for the shells were again falling quite thickly around us; and I passed an hour or two in continual shrinkings and exclamations. At length our tormentors passed farther on, and I again felt relieved from anxiety.  At ten or twelve o'clock, we saw, in spite of the continual falling of the shells, gentlemen hurrying toward the river. Soon we heard the Confederate river batteries booming loudly, and then all was silent. What could it mean? I did not venture to look without; and so I sat waiting for some one to come to me. At last a friend appeared, who, in the most triumphant manner, told us that the Confederates had routed the Federal fleet. The gunboats had formed in line of battle, sailing down majestically, with the Cincinnati--one of the finest boats in the river navy--leading the attack.  She came rapidly down around the point of the peninsula--the signal guns silent--when the battery, containing the Brooks gun, opened on her, as she came within range. The first shot cut down the flag; the second struck her side; and the third, the Brooks ball, with the steel wedge, cut into the iron plates near the water's edge. She turned immediately, and steamed back up the river in a sinking condition. The remaining boats, also, changed their course and retired. The Cincinnati had scarcely turned the point, when she sank near the shore.  \"Ah! yes!\" said the Major, \"had it not been for the fortunate sinking of the Cincinnati, you would have become conscious of a fearful warfare raging in the city. Had the boats gotten opposite and engaged our batteries, the firing would have been terrific.\"  The Major also told us that many ladies had been so much interested in the expected engagement, that they had gone up on Sky Parlor Hill for a better view.  It has been said that the Federal guns have never been sufficiently elevated to throw shell and shot so high as Sky Parlor Hill; yet, I should not like to risk my life for mere curiosity sake, when it was not possible to be of any service.  The Sky Parlor Hill is so called from its extreme height, being a portion of the bluff that stood where the principal commercial street now stands, the grading of the city having taken most of the elevation down. The hill now occupies about a square--the distance of two squares from the river--and is a prominent feature from all parts of the city. A rugged drive winds on one side up the steep ascent, and a long and dizzy flight of wooden steps ascend from the street on the opposite side.  It is surmounted by a little house that one could imagine surmounted \"the bean stalk,\" in the celebrated history of \"Jack,\" quaint and old, yet one that the earlier inhabitants would have called a \"fine house.\"  The view--and that is what the place is visited for--is good, both of the city and river, for some miles above. Crowds of people collect here on the occasion of any move being made in the direction of the river.  A large trunk was picked up after the sinking of the Cincinnati, belonging to a surgeon on board. It contained valuable surgical instruments that could not be procured in the Confederacy; a letter, also, written to the gentleman's wife previous to the departure of the fleet from above, telling her that the letter would be mailed at Vicksburg, as there was no doubt whatever that the place would be taken when an attack was made from the river.  It was also said that Commodore Porter was aboard the Cincinnati. How the fact was ascertained, no one could tell.  Shortly after the sinking of the Cincinnati, I received a note from M----, saying that he was very much troubled in regard to our safety in the city--fearing that some time a mortar shell might fall on our cave, or that the constant jarring of the earth from the near explosion might cause it to seam and fall upon us. Therefore, he had decided to have a home made for me near the battle field, where he was stationed--one that would be entirely out of reach of the mortar shells. I was positively shocked at the idea--going to the battle field! where ball and shell fell without intermission. Was M---- in earnest? I could scarcely believe it.  A friend came soon after, and told me that I would find my home on the battle field far more pleasant and safe than the one in town--that we were protected from the fragments only in our cave--that on the battle field the missiles were of far less weight, and in falling far less dangerous.  We were to experience our last and nearest explosion of the never-to-be-forgotten mortar shells before we left. M---- had written to me to be ready on the following night. As the moon was not shining, the firing from the Federal batteries would cease at dark afterward we could go out without interruption. I was delighted at the prospect of a change in our mouldy lives, and looked forward to our ride--after dark though it was--with the utmost pleasure.     CHAPTER XVI.  FALL OF A SHELL AT THE CORNER OF MY CAVE--MUSIC--CASUALTIES OF THE DAY.   I was sitting near the entrance, about five o'clock, thinking of the pleasant change--oh, bless me!--that to-morrow would bring, when the bombardment commenced more furiously than usual, the shells falling thickly around us, causing vast columns of earth to fly upward, mingled with smoke. As usual, I was uncertain whether to remain within or run out. As the rocking and trembling of the earth was very distinctly felt, and the explosions alarmingly near, I stood within the mouth of the cave ready to make my escape, should one chance to fall above our domicile. In my anxiety I was startled by the shouts of the servants and a most fearful jar and rocking of the earth, followed by a deafening explosion, such as I had never heard before. The cave filled instantly with powder smoke and dust. I stood with a tingling, prickling sensation in my head, hands, and feet, and with a confused brain. Yet alive!--was the first glad thought that came to me;--child, servants, all here, and saved!--from some great danger, I felt. I stepped out, to find a group of persons before my cave, looking anxiously for me; and lying all around, freshly torn, rose bushes, arbor-vit√¶ trees, large clods of earth, splinters, pieces of plank, wood, &c. A mortar shell had struck the corner of the cave, fortunately so near the brow of the hill, that it had gone obliquely into the earth, exploding as it went, breaking large masses from the side of the hill--tearing away the fence, the shrubbery and flowers--sweeping all, like an avalanche, down near the entrance of my good refuge.  I stood dismayed, and surveyed the havoc that had been made around me, while our little family under it all had been mercifully preserved. Though many of the neighboring servants had been standing near at the time, not one had been injured in the slightest degree; yet, pieces of plank, fragments of earth, and splinters had fallen in all directions. A portion of earth from the roof of my cave had been dislodged and fallen. Saving this, it remained intact.  That evening some friends sat with me: one took up my guitar and played some pretty little airs for us; yet, the noise of the shells threw a discord among the harmonies. To me it seemed like the crushing and bitter spirit of hate near the light and grace of happiness. How could we sing and laugh amid our suffering fellow beings--amid the shriek of death itself?  This, only breaking the daily monotony of our lives!--this thrilling knowledge of sudden and horrible death occurring near us, told to-night and forgotten in to-morrow's renewal!--this sad news of a Vicksburg day! A little negro child, playing in the yard, had found a shell; in rolling and turning it, had innocently pounded the fuse; the terrible explosion followed, showing, as the white cloud of smoke floated away, the mangled remains of a life that to the mother's heart had possessed all of beauty and joy.  A young girl, becoming weary in the confinement of the cave, hastily ran to the house in the interval that elapsed between the slowly falling shells. On returning, an explosion sounded near her--one wild scream, and she ran into her mother's presence, sinking like a wounded dove, the life blood flowing over the light summer dress in crimson ripples from a death-wound in her side, caused by the shell fragment.  A fragment had also struck and broken the arm of a little boy playing near the mouth of his mother's cave. This was one day's account.  I told of my little girl's great distress when the shells fell thickly near us--how she ran to me breathless, hiding her head in my dress without a word; then cautiously looking out, with her anxious face questioning, would say: \"Oh! mamma, was it a mortar tell?\" Poor children, that their little hearts should suffer and quail amid these daily horrors of war!  The next evening, about four o'clock, M----'s dear face appeared. He told us that he had heard of all the danger through which we had passed, and was extremely anxious to have us out of reach of the mortar shells, and near him; he also thought we would find our new home on the battle field far superior to this; he wished us to go out as soon as possible.

It is hoped that the present volume will supply a want that is really felt by students of philosophy in our universities‚Äîthe want of an English text-book on General Metaphysics from the Scholastic standpoint. It is the author‚Äôs intention to supplement his _Science of Logic_(1) and the present treatise on Ontology, by a volume on the Theory of Knowledge. Hence no disquisitions on the latter subject will be found in these pages: the Moderate Realism of Aristotle and the Schoolmen is assumed throughout.  In the domain of Ontology there are many scholastic theories and discussions which are commonly regarded by non-scholastic writers as possessing nowadays for the student of philosophy an interest that is merely historical. This mistaken notion is probably due to the fact that few if any serious attempts have yet been made to transpose these questions from their medieval setting into the language and context of contemporary philosophy. Perhaps not a single one of these problems is really and in substance alien to present-day speculations. The author has endeavoured, by his treatment of such characteristically ‚Äúmedieval‚Äù discussions as those on _Potentia_ and _Actus_, Essence and Existence, Individuation, the Theory of Distinctions, Substance and Accident, Nature and Person, Logical and Real Relations, Efficient and Final Causes, to show that the issues involved are in every instance as fully and keenly debated‚Äîin an altered setting and a new terminology‚Äîby recent and living philosophers of every school of thought as they were by St. Thomas and his contemporaries in the golden age of medieval scholasticism. And, as the purposes of a text-book demanded, attention has been devoted to stating the problems clearly, to showing the significance and bearings of discussions and solutions, rather than to detailed analyses of arguments. At the same time it is hoped that the treatment is sufficiently full to be helpful even to advanced students and to all who are interested in the ‚ÄúMetaphysics of the Schools‚Äù. For the convenience of the reader the more advanced portions are printed in smaller type.  The teaching of St. Thomas and the other great Schoolmen of the Middle Ages forms the groundwork of the book. This _corpus_ of doctrine is scarcely yet accessible outside its Latin sources. As typical of the fuller scholastic text-books the excellent treatise of the Spanish author, Urraburu,(2) has been most frequently consulted. Much assistance has also been derived from Kleutgen‚Äôs _Philosophie der Vorzeit_,(3) a monumental work which ought to have been long since translated into English. And finally, the excellent treatise in the Louvain _Cours de Philosophie_, by the present Cardinal Archbishop of Mechlin,(4) has been consulted with profit and largely followed in many places. The writer freely and gratefully acknowledges his indebtedness to these and other authors quoted and referred to in the course of the present volume.      GENERAL INTRODUCTION.   I. REASON OF INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.‚ÄîIt is desirable that at some stage in the course of his investigations the student of philosophy should be invited to take a brief general survey of the work in which he is engaged. This purpose will be served by a chapter on _the general aim and scope of philosophy_, its distinctive characteristics as compared with other lines of human thought, and its relations to these latter. Such considerations will at the same time help to define _Ontology_, thus introducing the reader to the subject-matter of the present volume.  II. PHILOSOPHY: THE NAME AND THE THING.‚ÄîIn the fifth book of Cicero‚Äôs _Tusculan Disputations_ we read that the terms _philosophus_ and _philosophia_ were first employed by Pythagoras who flourished in the sixth century before Christ, that this ancient sage was modest enough to call himself not a ‚Äúwise man‚Äù but a ‚Äúlover of wisdom‚Äù (œÜ·Ω∑ŒªŒøœÇ, œÉŒøœÜ·Ω∑Œ±), and his calling not a profession of wisdom but a search for wisdom. However, despite the disclaimer, the term _philosophy_ soon came to signify _wisdom_ simply, meaning by this the highest and most precious kind of knowledge.  Now human knowledge has for its object everything that falls in any way within human experience. It has _extensively_ a great variety in its subject-matter, and _intensively_ a great variety in its degrees of depth and clearness and perfection. _Individual facts_ of the past, communicated by human testimony, form the raw materials of _historical_ knowledge. Then there are all the individual things and events that fall within one‚Äôs own personal experience. Moreover, by the study of human language (or languages), of works of the human mind and products of human genius and skill, we gain a knowledge of _literature_, and of the _arts_‚Äîthe fine arts and the mechanical arts. But not merely do we use our senses and memory thus to accumulate an unassorted stock of informations about isolated facts: a miscellaneous mass of mental furniture which constitutes the bulk of human knowledge in its _least developed_ form‚Äî_cognitio ____vulgaris,___ the knowledge of the comparatively uneducated and unreflecting classes of mankind. We also use our reasoning faculty to reflect, compare, classify these informations, to interpret them, to reason about them, to infer from them _general truths_ that embrace individual things and events _beyond our personal experience_; we try to explain them by seeking out their _reasons_ and _causes_. This mental activity gradually converts our knowledge into _scientific_ knowledge, and thus gives rise to those great groups of systematized truths called the _sciences_: as, for example, the physical and mathematical sciences, the elements of which usually form part of our early education. These sciences teach us a great deal about ourselves and the universe in which we live. There is no need to dwell on the precious services conferred upon mankind by discoveries due to the progress of the various _special_ sciences: mathematics as applied to engineering of all sorts; astronomy; the physical sciences of light, heat, sound, electricity, magnetism, etc.; chemistry in all its branches; physiology and anatomy as applied in medicine and surgery. All these undoubtedly contribute much to man‚Äôs _bodily_ well-being. But man has a _mind_ as well as a body, and he is moreover a _social_ being: there are, therefore, other special sciences‚Äî‚Äúhuman‚Äù as distinct from ‚Äúphysical‚Äù sciences‚Äîin which man himself is studied in his mental activities and social relations with his fellow-men: the sciences of social and political economy, constitutional and civil law, government, statesmanship, etc. Furthermore, man is a _moral_ being, recognizing distinctions of good and bad, right and wrong, pleasure and happiness, duty and responsibility, in his own conduct; and finally he is a _religious_ being, face to face with the fact that men universally entertain views, beliefs, convictions of some sort or other, regarding man‚Äôs subjection to, and dependence on, some higher power or powers dwelling somehow or somewhere within or above the whole universe of his direct and immediate experience: there are therefore also sciences which deal with these domains, morality and religion. Here, however, the domains are so extensive, and the problems raised by their phenomena are of such far-reaching importance, that the sciences which deal with them can hardly be called special sciences, but rather constituent portions of the one wider and deeper _general_ science which is what men commonly understand nowadays by philosophy.  The distinction between the special sciences on the one hand and philosophy, the general science, on the other, will help us to realize more clearly the nature and scope of the latter. The special sciences are concerned with discovering the _proximate_ reasons and causes of this, that, and the other definite department in the whole universe of our experience. The subject-matter of some of them is totally different from that of others: physiology studies the functions of living organisms; geology studies the formation of the earth‚Äôs crust. Or if two or more of them investigate the same subject-matter they do so from different standpoints, as when the zoologist and the physiologist study the same type or specimen in the animal kingdom. But the common feature of all is this, that each seeks only the reasons, causes, and laws which give a _proximate_ and _partial_ explanation of the facts which it investigates, leaving untouched and unsolved a number of deeper and wider questions which may be raised about the _whence_ and _whither_ and _why_, not only of the facts themselves, but of the reasons, causes and laws assigned by the particular science in explanation of these facts.
