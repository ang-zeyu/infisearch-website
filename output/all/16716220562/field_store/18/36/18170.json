There was a half stifled exclamation from the scoffer, and he wildly clutched the air; his eyes seemed bursting from their sockets and his face was purple with his effort to speak. Those who had stood with him drew back as if by instinct, and he stood alone writhing under his curse. Exhausted at last by violent contortions of his whole frame, he became more calm; and in answer to the question by the Chief Judge--  \"Art thou now convinced of the existence of God?\"  He wrote an answer, saying that he was; that he knew there was a God, but the devil had deceived him by appearing to him as an angel of light, that he had taught his words because they were pleasing to the carnal mind, and his success made him believe, finally, that they were true. He pleaded piteously that the High Priest would remove the curse, but Alma replied:  \"If this curse should be taken from thee, thou wouldst again lead away the hearts of this people; therefore it shall be unto thee, even as the Lord will.\"  Korihor looked around him, but no one gave him recognition as a friend; those who had accompanied him into the hall stood terror stricken, and amazement was depicted in every countenance. He realized that he was deserted in this his extremity, and with a gurgling cry he fled from the hall and the city.  The vast audience which had breathlessly witnessed this remarkable scene and the demonstration of the power of God, began to break up, and quietly leave the hall, each person too deeply impressed with what he had witnessed to speak to his neighbor. The Chief Judge and the High Priest were among the last to depart. As the latter was approaching the door his robe was clutched, and turning round he stood face to face with his wayward son--Corianton.     CHAPTER FIVE.  THE NEW CONVERT.   For a moment father and son faced each other, but neither spoke. The proud head of Corianton was bowed, his lips quivered with emotion. The father held out his hand, and the young man grasped it. \"Father,\" he said, in humbled tone, \"I have sinned against God, and against thee; I pray you pardon me, and ask thy God to pardon me, too.\"  \"Corianton, thy rebellion against God is in truth a grievous sin. But youth is thoughtless and wayward, impatient of restraint, easily misled, and often, too, by generous impulses. The high sounding phrase, the reckless plea for unbridled license, miscalled liberty, of which men of Korihor's type well know the influence, the mocking jests at sober, righteous lives, the boldness which dares mock at sacred things, and bid defiance even to God, hath in it a false daring which captures inconsiderate youth, and works its ruin. I do remember my own youth, Corianton, and how in my mad folly I threw away restraint, consorted with the wicked, mocked the righteous, and impiously blasphemed the name of God, and afflicted my noble father's soul as thou hast mine--but I forgive thee,\" hastily added the Priest, as a great sob escaped his son, \"as he did me; and so far as my earnest prayer can pluck down God's forgiveness on thy head, be assured, my son, my most dear son, God shall forgive thee, too.\" With these words ho fondly embraced Corianton, and a few moments later they left the Hall of Justice together.  At the house of the High Priest they found Ammon, Aaron, Omner and Himni, and also Helaman and Shiblon, the two elder sons of Alma. The first four persons named were the sons of Mosiah, the last king of the Nephites, at whose death the reign of the judges began. These men had been the companions of Alma from his boyhood, and together in their youthful days they had been recklessly wicked and sought the destruction of the Church, as already detailed in chapter two. After their conversion they had traveled to and fro through all the land of the Nephites, seeking to undo the mischief they had done; and then performed glorious missions among the Lamanites where the power of God had been wondrously manifested to the converting of many of that people to the truth. Often separated in their labors, cast into prisons, surrounded by dangers, threatened by mobs, weary, foot-sore, hungry--now received into palaces and hailed almost as Gods, now outcasts, without a place to lay their heads--they experienced all the changes, the successes, and the vicissitudes of missionary life, but through all of it they were faithful to God, and held each other in fondest remembrance.  The present occasion of their meeting together was to determine what steps should be taken in relation to the Zoramites, a people who had dissented from the Nephites and had established themselves at Antionum, south of the land Gershon, and bordering on the lands occupied by the Lamanites; and it was feared they would become confederate with the Lamanites and create trouble. The meeting held on the subject the day before had been interrupted by the Chief Judge sending for Alma to consult over the case of Korihor. Now they had met to conclude the business thus interrupted.  Alma was warmly greeted by his brethren, who had witnessed the scene in the Hall of Justice; and all expressed their gratitude to God for the great manifestation of his power, and the vindication of his cause.  \"The most happy fruit of this issue,\" said Alma, \"is that it gives back to us my son Corianton; who, at first, stood with the unbeliever, but now has seen a demonstration of God's power, to the conversion of his soul.\" At this announcement the brethren gathered about Corianton and warmly embraced him, thanking God for his deliverance from darkness.  It was finally arranged that Alma, Ammon, Aaron, Omner together with Shiblon and Corianton, should go on a mission to the Zoramites; that Himni should remain to preside over the church at Zarahemla, assisted by Helaman.  As the council was breaking up, Alma suggested that he would like to take with him on this mission Amulek and Zeezrom, but they were in the city of Melek, west of Zarahemla. Corianton volunteered to go after them, and Shiblon expressed a willingness to accompany him. That afternoon they started.  En route they passed through several villages, and on such occasions were everywhere questioned in relation to the curse which had fallen upon Korihor, of which they had heard conflicting rumors. The young men gave to those inquiring correct information, though Corianton in testifying to the existence of God, and to the truth, was not always as humble or merciful to those who were not yet converted as was conformable to the spirit of the gospel, or consistent with the position which he himself had so lately occupied. It is ever thus with your new convert; by his actions and by his words you would be led to think, if you did not know better, that he was the last sinner God was waiting to bring into his fold before he damned the rest. Shiblon observed these faults in his brother, but knowing his haughty spirit, which could ill brook restraint, he resolved to remain silent, and let those older correct him.  Finding Amulek and Zeezrom, they delivered their message from the council of the priesthood in Zarahemla, and both these worthy men returned with them to that city, and from thence the party took its journey to Antionum, the chief city of the Zoramites.  Of that journey it is necessary to say but little. It occupied eight days, the party going on foot, driving with them but two asses, on which were packed the tents, food and other necessary articles for the comfort of the party. For the sons of Mosiah and Alma, who were all experienced missionaries, and had passed through many trying scenes together, as also, indeed, had Amulek and Zeezroni, it was a glorious reunion; and many and various were the adventures and special manifestations of the power of God related. To the younger men, Shiblon and Corianton, it was a feast of spiritual food--the conversation of these servants of God.     CHAPTER SIX.  THE ZORAMITES.   The sun was slowly sinking in the western sky, as the party of missionaries presented themselves at the main entrance to the city Antionum, the gateway of the north wall. They were permitted to pass in unchallenged, and inquired out a lodging house, where they all stayed together. Uninformed as to the exact nature of the heresy of the Zoramites, they had resolved to avoid proclaiming their mission, until they should become acquainted with the nature of the errors it was their hope to correct.  The day following their entrance into the city was the holy day of the Zoramites, when they repaired to the synagogues, of which there were many, to worship. The interior of their places of worship was gorgeously decorated. Near the center of each rose a stand, the top of which extended half the height from the floor to the ceiling. The stand proper rested on a sort of frustum of a cone. Up the sides were several flights of steps, and at the top of the frustum was standing room for a number of people; but in the stand proper there was room for but one. Each in his turn ascended the single flight of steps to the top of this holy stand--Rameumptom they called it--and stretching forth his hands towards heaven, exclaimed in solemn tones:          Holy, Holy, Holy God!       Thou art God, There is no God beside.     Spirit Bright, and Everlasting--     The same to-day and ever more.     Separate are we from men--     Elected us hast Thou and made us holy,     While all beside thou hast condemned;     For which,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35974"],["title","Corianton: A Nephite Story (#5)"],["body","High, and Holy God we give Thee thanks--     That we are not as other men.     Separated are we from false traditions of the Christ--     That deep blasphemy of corrupted Nephites,     Who know not Thee as Spirit-God:     But as a man expect to see Thee     Come on earth, and all mankind redeemed!     For deliverance from such traditions vile     Most High and Holy God--I give Thee thanks!       Amen, amen, amen!  At the conclusion of every distinct thought in the above prayer, the company of worshippers at the top of the frustum would cry aloud--\"Amen, amen!\" And at the conclusion of the prayer an unseen choir accompanied by instruments, chanted selected and slightly altered passages of the above prayer such as--  \"Holy, holy God! Thou art God. Thou are holy. Thou are spirit, and ever shall be--Holy is thy name! Amen! amen!\"  Such was their form of worship, such their set prayers, as witnessed that day by Alma and his fellow missionaries.  After witnessing this mixture of impiety and hypocrisy, self-glorification, and abasement of those not of them. Alma thought it not necessary to wait longer in commencing the work, and hence, that night he laid hands upon the heads of his associates, blessed them and set them apart for the accomplishment of the work in hand. The next morning they separated for the better prosecution of their enterprise. They took no thought of themselves, what they should eat, or where they should be lodged. They preached in the synagogues, in private houses, and even in the streets.  No one in the beginning of this work was more zealous, or more successful than Corianton. Indeed it was his success that began to work a great mischief; for it filled him with pride and boasting in his own strength. By the force of his brilliancy, and a kind of genius for controversy, he discomfited the Zoramites, and exposed the shallowness of their principles to the great delight of the multitude who, though they believed not the message he was delivering, were immensely pleased with the youthful orator.  There were fundamental truths of the gospel, however, to which Corianton himself was not converted; the atonement of Christ, the resurrection, the justice of God in punishing the wicked, being among them. He found, as many since his day have found, that seeing a single manifestation of the power of God--a miracle--had not removed all the difficulties in the way of a sound faith in the gospel; and in his own mind he began to find ways of accounting for the destruction of Korihor's speech--his own excitement, the mysterious magnetism of his father which swayed men's minds, a power which he flattered himself he had inherited, notwithstanding his unbelief.  One day about sunset, while in this frame of mind, as he was passing down one of the main thoroughfares of Antionum, he saw a poor, wretched object begging of those who passed him on the street. He was miserably clad and filthy, his form emaciated and trembling with weakness, but there was something in the profile of the face, a resemblance to a countenance which lived in Corianton's recollection, that attracted his attention. As he approached nearer he observed a wildness about the man, occasioned by desperate efforts at speech, resulting only in harsh, disconnected and unintelligible mumbling. To his astonishment, it was Korihor. The form was wasted, the features shrunken almost past recognition, and insanity glared from his wild eyes. Corianton gazed in pity upon him, and Korihor returned that look with one of puzzled wonder. Then as the mists and confusion of his mind cleared up for the moment, he recognized his former, and what he accounted his false friend, and with a wild shriek fled out into the street, looking back at Corianton as he ran with an air expressive of horror. At that moment a troop of horsemen was passing down the street, and so sudden had been the poor half maniac's flight from the presence of Corianton, that he threw himself in front of the horsemen, and before they could check their speed or change their course, he was knocked down and trampled upon.  A crowd quickly gathered around the bruised and bleeding form. His case was notorious in Antionum, and it was generally believed that his dumbness was brought upon him through sorcery; hence, even while he was shunned by the people, there were many who sympathized with him, so far, at least, as execrating those who had been the means, as they thought, of bringing the evil upon him. Corianton ran to the man and raised him to a sitting posture, but he never regained consciousness; a few painful gasps, and the body sank back into the arms of the young man, limp and lifeless. One of the guards of the city came up to the crowd, and, recognizing the body as that of the dumb, half-crazed beggar, he took charge of it, and finally interred it.  As Corianton walked away with the mangled form of the once bold anti-Christ vividly pictured in his mind, he muttered half aloud--\"This is one of the judgments of God--cruel, infinitely cruel! He above all others could have been generous and have pardoned him before his justice,\" and he fairly hissed the word, \"had turned to cruelty!\"  By this time he had reached his lodgings, one of the finest palaces in all that city, and strange enough, it was the home of one of the chief Zoramites who had been especially pleased, or at least feigned to be especially pleased, with Corianton, and had invited him to make his house his home. At the entrance to the walk leading up to the house, he was met by a woman, who asked if he was one of the Nephite prophets that had come to preach the doctrines of the Nephites to the Zoramites. Corianton answered that he was of that party. \"And is your name Corianton?\"  \"Yes, that is my name.\"  \"Then at last I have found you!\"     CHAPTER SEVEN.  JOAN.   Was the woman who accosted Corianton at the gate of his lodging, young, beautiful? He could not tell; the twilight had deepened too much into the shadow of night, to permit him to see clearly; but there was a fascination in the full, sweet tones of her voice, and he was thrilled by the touch of her soft hand, as she laid it gently on his arm, as if to detain him while asking the questions with which the last chapter closed.  \"You are going to Seantum's?\"  \"Yes, that is where I lodge.\"  \"I will go with you.\"  He hesitated, and was not a little astonished at her perfect self-possession, which, to his thinking, bordered on boldness. It must be remembered that among the Nephites, one of the chief characteristics of their women, so far as one is able to judge from their annals, was modesty--an excellent thing in woman, when not feigned or prudish. The freedom, therefore, with which this woman had accosted him, a perfect stranger, and now proposed to go with him, uninvited, to the place where he lodged, was a boldness to which Corianton was unaccustomed. She observed that he hesitated, and broke out into a light, silvery laugh.  \"Ah, I forgot,\" she said, in an apologizing tone, yet with a touch of mockery in it, \"thou art one of the prophets, perhaps a solemn one, and unacquainted with our people, and my manners are too bold. But Seantum, with whom you lodge, is a near kinsman--my father's brother; now, will you throw open the gate, and allow me to go in with you?\"  He complied with her request mechanically, and in silence, for he knew not what to say. As they approached the house he again felt that soft hand laid gently on his arm, and the same sweet voice said, almost pleadingly: \"Let us not go into the house yet, the evening is beautiful; see, the moon is just peeping over the tree tops, and floods the earth with her soft light--let us walk in the garden.\" She had retained her hold upon his arm, and obeying her will rather than his own, he turned down a path leading away from the house.  The house of Seantum was situated at the southern outskirts of the city, in the midst of a spacious and splendid garden. There were extensive lawns, studded with tropical trees, several species of palms and plantain; the cocoa trees standing in groups, their great tufts of gigantic leaves rustling in the moonlight at the height of sixty and seventy feet; banana and papaw trees growing side by side in rows along the walks, and back of them in irregular order stood pomegranates, while here and there were clumps of lindens, interspersed with sumach and cashew, and a great variety of evergreen shrubbery. Here side by side, and in fine contrast, were rhododendrons, with their rose-colored flowers, and the coffee shrub with its clusters of delicate white blossoms. Other flowers and flowering trees there were in great profusion--the fragrant eglantine, the elegant, airy though thorny acacia, and now and then an aloe plant, and, ah, rare sight! several of them were in full bloom; these, with splendid magnolias, mingled their odors; and burdened the air with ambrosial fragrance, which, with the chirrup and hum of insect life, the gentle whispering wind, stealing softly through shrubbery and tree, and all kissed to beauty by the glorious moonlight, made up a night such as lovers love, and love's young dream expands.  \"You are not at all curious,\" said Corianton's new-found companion. \"You have not yet asked my name, nor why I am here, nor what it is I want with you--you have not spoken half a dozen words since we met--you smile, do you mean by that I have not given you a chance to say more?\"  \"Such were my thoughts, lady, but I would know your name, and am most curious to know what you would with me.\"  By this they had reached a lakelet at the lower end of the garden, from whose moist beach grew several gigantic mango and sycamore trees. They had passed in the shadow of one of the latter whose inclining trunk extended far out over the water-lily bedecked lake. Half seating herself on the inclined tree, she raised her hand to clutch a grape vine that drooped from a branch above, and as she did so the ample"]]]
