Heels broadly overlap when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation reaches to middle of eye; a low rounded tarsal fold on distal half of tarsus; inner metatarsal tubercle elevated, flat, and elliptical; outer metatarsal tubercle at base of fourth toe, round; row of low, sometimes indistinct, tubercles from heel to base of fifth toe; subarticular tubercles round; length of digits from shortest to longest 1-2-3-5-4, third and fifth being about equal in length; third and fifth toes webbed to base of disc; fourth toe webbed to base of penultimate phalanx; discs of toes much smaller than on fingers. Anal opening near dorsal surface of thighs; short anal flap; opening bordered laterally by heavy dermal fold and ventrolaterally by large tubercles. Skin of dorsum and ventral surfaces of forelimbs and shanks smooth; that of throat, belly, and ventral surfaces of thighs granular. Ventrolateral glands moderately developed, reaching axilla but not to groin and broadly separated midventrally. Tongue cordiform, shallowly notched behind and barely free posteriorly; vomerine teeth 4-3, situated on transverse elevations between ovoid inner nares; openings to vocal sac large, one situated along inner posterior edge of each mandibular ramus.  Dorsal ground-color of head, body, and limbs pale tan with large interconnected dark brown blotches on head and body and broad dark brown transverse bands on limbs; dorsal surfaces of first and second fingers and of webbing of hands pale brown; dorsal surfaces of third and fourth fingers dark brown; anterior surfaces of thighs flesh-color; posterior surfaces of thighs brown; dorsal surfaces of tarsi and feet dark brown; narrow white stripe along ventrolateral edges of forearms and tarsi; a faint creamy white stripe above anal opening; axilla white; flanks creamy white, boldly spotted with black; throat and chest white; ventral surfaces of tarsi and feet dark brown; other ventral surfaces dusty cream color; large brown spots on chin and anterior part of abdomen.  In life the dorsum was reddish brown (Orange-Cinnamon) with dark brown (Chocolate) blotches; first and second fingers and webbing on hand pale reddish brown (Cinnamon); webbing on feet dark brown (Clove Brown); flanks pale creamy white (Pale Olive Buff) with dark brown (Bone Brown) spots; iris reddish bronze (Apricot Orange).  _Variation._--No noticeable geographic variation is apparent in the few available specimens; variations in proportions are given in Table 1. The distal subarticular tubercle of the fourth finger is either bifid or double in all specimens; that on the third finger usually is bifid, sometimes single. The vertical rostral keel is prominent in all freshly preserved specimens; in some older specimens it is indistinct. The tongue always is notched posteriorly; in some individuals the notch is shallow; in others it is deep.  Some specimens are paler and less boldly marked than the specimen described above. All specimens from Agua del Obispo and some specimens from the northern slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental in Oaxaca have a pale tan dorsum with brown markings. In most individuals the white color in the axilla extends onto the posterior edge of the upper arm. The creamy white color of the flanks is constant and usually extends slightly dorsad in the inguinal region. The white stripe above, and sometimes continuing down beside, the anal opening varies from a thin indistinct line or row of flecks to a distinct continuous stripe. Two specimens have dark brown spots on the belly; in the others the spots are confined to the flanks and throat.  _Description of tadpole._--The following description is based on KU 68556 from 7.5 kilometers south of Yetla, Oaxaca, México (Figs. 4C and 6C). No limb buds; total length, 37.3 mm.; body length, 12.2 mm.; body length/total length, 32.7 per cent; body slightly depressed, barely wider than deep, ovoid in dorsal profile; mouth directed ventrally; eyes small, directed dorsolaterally; nostrils barely protuberant and directed anterolaterally, about midway between snout and eye; spiracle sinistral and posteroventrad to eye; anal tube dextral. Caudal fin low, bluntly rounded posteriorly; greatest depth of caudal musculature about one-half depth of caudal fin; musculature extends nearly to tip of tail.  Mouth large; lips having deep lateral folds; two complete rows of papillae on lips; five to seven rows of papillae laterally; beaks moderately developed, bearing short peglike serrations; moderately wide lateral projections on upper beak; tooth-rows 4/6; upper rows subequal in length; fourth row interrupted medially; length of lower rows 1-4 equal to upper rows; fifth and sixth lower rows shorter; first lower row interrupted medially.  Body brown above; tip of snout brown; venter creamy gray; caudal musculature creamy tan; caudal fin transparent; cream-colored crescent-shaped mark on posterior edge of body; dark brown flecks on caudal musculature and all except anterior two-thirds of ventral caudal fin; large brown square blotches on dorsum of caudal fin; eye reddish brown in life.  _Variation._--The variation in size and proportions is given in Table 2. With the exception of one specimen having a short, broken, seventh tooth-row, all specimens have 4/6 tooth-rows that are like those described above. In some specimens the brown blotches on the dorsum of the caudal musculature are fused and marked with cream-colored flecks.  _Comparisons._--_Ptychohyla leonhardschultzei_ differs from all other members of the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group in having a square snout, and further differs from _P. spinipollex_ in more numerous and smaller nuptial spines and in transverse, instead of posteromedially slanting, vomerine processes between the inner nares. _Ptychohyla leonhardschultzei_ differs from _P. euthysanota_ in having a rostral keel and in having white flanks boldly spotted with black.  All small hylids that are sympatric with _Ptychohyla leonhardschultzei_ are either yellow (_Hyla dendroscarta_ and _H. melanomma_) or green (_Hyla erythromma_, which has a red eye, _Hyla hazelae_, which has a black line on the canthus, and _Ptychohyla ignicolor_, which has red flash colors on the thighs).  _Life History._--This frog has been found along streams in cloud forests and in pine-oak forest. Males call from vegetation along the stream or from rocks in and at the edge of the stream. The call is a single, long, soft \"wraack,\" repeated at intervals of anywhere from several seconds to three or four minutes. Each note has a duration of 0.62 to 0.95 of a second and a rate of 76 to 78 pulses per second; the dominant frequency falls between 2700 and 2800 cycles per second (Pl. 11C).  Tadpoles were found in several streams in northern Oaxaca. A tadpole having a total length of 21.1 mm. has three upper and four lower tooth-rows well developed; the fourth upper and fifth lower rows are weakly present, and the sixth lower row has not started to develop. Two metamorphosed young have snout-vent lengths of 15.2 and 15.5 mm.  _Remarks._--Four specific names have been applied to this species. Ahl (1934:185) based his description of _Hyla leonhardschultzei_ on a small, poorly preserved female. Taylor (1944:41) proposed the generic name _Ptychohyla_ for a species (named therein as _P. adipoventris_) of hylid having ventrolateral glands and horn-covered nuptial spines. Obviously, Taylor was unaware that _Hyla leonhardschultzei_ was the same species. Earlier Taylor (1937:46) described _Hyla pinorum_. The types of all of these species came from the Pacific slopes of the Sierra del Sur in Guerrero. Examination of the types and other available specimens shows that they are representatives of a single species. The type of _Hyla pinorum_ is an immature male having a snout-vent length of 26.7 mm. All of these specimens have the square snout and black and white flanks characteristic of _Ptychohyla leonhard-schultzei_. Although Shannon (1951:473) based his description of _Hyla milleri_ on a male having well-developed ventrolateral glands, he overlooked the presence of these glands in his description and discussion of relationships. The acquisition of more specimens from northern Oaxaca has shown that _Hyla milleri_ is the same as _Ptychohyla leonhardschultzei_.  _Distribution._--This species is known from pine-oak forest and cloud forest on the Pacific slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur in Guerrero and Oaxaca and from the Atlantic slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental in northern Oaxaca. Specimens have been collected at elevations between 700 and 1650 meters. Probably the species occurs in humid forests at similar elevations around the eastern end of the Mexican Highlands in Oaxaca.  _Specimens examined._--MEXICO: _Guerrero_: Agua del Obispo, CNHM 123489-90, 126651, 106300, MCZ 29639, UIMNH 25047, 25049, USNM 114551; Malinaltepec, ZMB 34351, 34353. _Oaxaca_: 2.5 km.

Alta Verapaz, Guatemala (Pl. 15). Adult male having a snout-vent length of 37.7 mm.; tibia length, 18.2 mm.; tibia length/snout-vent length, 48.2 per cent; foot length, 15.8 mm.; head length, 11.7 mm.; head length/snout-vent length, 31.0 per cent; head width, 11.7 mm.; head width/snout-vent length, 31.0 per cent; diameter of eye, 3.6 mm.; diameter of tympanum, 1.9 mm.; tympanum/eye, 52.7 per cent. Snout in lateral profile nearly square, slightly rounded above, and in dorsal profile rounded with a pointed tip resulting from vertical rostral keel; canthus pronounced; loreal region barely concave; lips thick, rounded, and barely flaring; nostrils protuberant; internarial distance, 3.0 mm.; top of head flat; interorbital distance, 3.7 mm., about equal to width of eyelid, 3.6 mm. A heavy dermal fold from posterior corner of eye above tympanum to point above insertion of forearm, covering upper edge of tympanum; tympanum round, its diameter equal to its distance from eye. Forearm moderately robust, having faint dermal fold on wrist; row of low, rounded tubercles along ventrolateral edge of forearm; pollex only slightly enlarged, bearing triangular patch of moderate-sized, pointed, horn-covered spines (38 on right, 43 on left); second finger noticeably shorter than fourth; subarticular tubercles round, distal one on fourth finger bifid; discs of fingers of moderate size, that of third finger slightly smaller than diameter of tympanum; vestigial web between first and second fingers; other fingers one-third webbed. Heels broadly overlapping when hind limbs adpressed; tibiotarsal articulation reaches to middle of eye; distinct, but low, tarsal fold extending length of tarsus; inner metatarsal tubercle elevated, flat, and elliptical; outer metatarsal tubercle small and round, near base of fourth toe; row of low indistinct tubercles from heel to base of fifth toe; subarticular tubercles round; length of toes from shortest to longest 1-2-3-5-4, the third and fifth being about equal in length; third and fifth toes webbed to base of disc; fourth toe webbed to base of penultimate phalanx; discs of toes slightly smaller than those on fingers. Anal opening near upper edge of thighs; opening bordered laterally by moderately heavy dermal folds and ventrolaterally by tubercles. Skin of dorsum and ventral surfaces of forelimbs and shanks smooth; that of throat, belly, and ventral surfaces of thighs granular. Ventrolateral glands barely evident. Tongue ovoid, barely notched behind and slightly free posteriorly; vomerine teeth 2-3, situated on V-shaped elevations between round inner nares; openings to vocal sac large, one situated along inner posterior edge of each mandibular ramus.  Dorsal ground-color of head, body, and limbs grayish tan with dark brown reticulations on head and body and dark brown transverse bars or spots on limbs; first and second fingers cream color; third and fourth fingers and webbing on hands pale grayish brown; anterior surfaces of thighs reddish tan; posterior surfaces of thighs yellowish tan; tarsi and toes pale grayish tan with brown flecks; webbing on foot pale brown; faint white stripe along ventrolateral edges of tarsi and forearms; narrow white line above and beside anal opening; no white stripe on edge of upper lip; axilla pale flesh-color; throat, chest, and ventral surfaces of limbs pale creamy gray; belly white with scattered brown flecks; flanks grayish white with dark brown flecks; ventral surfaces of tarsi dark brown; ventrolateral glands grayish tan.  In life the dorsal ground-color of the head, body, fore limbs, and thighs was yellowish tan (Pinkish Buff); dorsal surfaces of shanks and tarsi pale yellowish tan (Pale Pinkish Buff); markings on head and back brown (Snuff Brown) to dark brown (Chocolate); dark bands on limbs brown (Tawny-Olive); first and second fingers creamy tan (Light Pinkish Cinnamon); posterior surfaces of thighs creamy tan (Light Pinkish Cinnamon); third and fourth fingers and webbing on hand grayish brown (Avellaneous); webbing on feet dark brown (Olive Brown); axilla pale pink (Hydrangea Pink); flanks buff (Cream-Buff) becoming yellow (Lemon Chrome) in groin; spots on flanks dark brown (Clove Brown); iris dull grayish bronze (Orange-Citrine).  _Variation._--The distal subarticular tubercle beneath the fourth finger is bifid in about two-thirds of the specimens; in the rest it is round. The posterior edge of the tongue varies from being emarginate to shallowly notched. In most specimens the row of tubercles along the outer edge of the tarsus is made up of discrete tubercles, but in some individuals the tubercles form a nearly continuous dermal fold. Most specimens have the vomerine teeth situated on V-shaped elevations, but in some individuals the elevations are more nearly transversely situated between the inner nares.  All 42 specimens from Finca Los Alpes, Guatemala, have dark brown spots and flecks on the venter. Some individuals have only a few flecks on the throat and a few large spots on the flanks, as does KU 64125. Other specimens, such as KU 64132, have dense spotting over the entire venter. The color of the dorsum varies from pale tan to dark brown with darker brown markings; the white line above the anus is present in all specimens, but in some it is indistinct. KU 58053 and 64127 have a dark brown dorsum with large pale tan, square blotches; in life the blotches were pale tan (Pinkish Buff); the rest of the dorsum was dark brown (Sayal Brown). KU 58052 is dark brown with many small white flecks on the dorsum; in life the dorsum was deep olive brown (Dark Olive).  Aside from the differences mentioned above, all specimens from Guatemala are similar in coloration. Three specimens from Honduras (MCZ 21300 and UMMZ 113102-3) have unspotted white venters. MCZ 21300, the holotype of _P. spinipollex_, lacks a white stripe above the anal opening, whereas the stripe is indistinct in UMMZ 113102-3.  _Description of tadpole._--The following description is based on KU 60053 from Fina Los Alpes, Depto. Alta Verapaz, Guatemala (Figs. 4D and 6D). No limb buds; total length, 37.2 mm.; body length, 12.2 mm.; body length/total length, 32.8 per cent. Body rounded, not depressed, as wide as deep, ovoid in dorsal profile; mouth directed ventrally; eyes small, directed dorsolaterally; nostrils barely protuberant and directed anterolaterally, somewhat closer to eye than snout; spiracle sinistral and posteroventrad to eye; anal tube dextral. Caudal fin low, bluntly rounded posteriorly; greatest depth of caudal musculature about one-half depth of caudal fin; musculature extends nearly to tip of tail.  Mouth large; lips having deep lateral folds; two complete rows of papillae on lips; six or seven rows of papillae laterally; beaks moderately developed, bearing fine blunt serrations; slender lateral projections on upper beak; tooth-rows 4/7; upper rows subequal in length; fourth row interrupted medially; lower rows 1-4 equal in length to upper rows; lower rows 5-7 decreasing in length; first lower row interrupted medially.  Top of head and tip of snout brown; venter creamy gray; caudal musculature tan; caudal fin transparent; faint cream-colored, narrow, crescent-shaped mark on posterior edge of body, not bordered posteriorly by dark brown mark; brown flecks scattered on caudal musculature and caudal fin; only a few flecks on anterior half of ventral caudal fin; eye bronze-color in life.  _Variation._--The variation in size and proportions as compared with tadpoles of other species is given in Table 2. Of the 57 tadpoles of this species that I have examined, 21 have only six lower tooth-rows, although in some of these specimens a faint ridge for a seventh row is present. In those specimens having seven lower rows, the seventh often is broken.  There is considerable variation in coloration. None has a distinct cream-colored, crescent-shaped mark bordered posteriorly by a dark brown bar or triangle, as in the other species in the _Ptychohyla euthysanota_ group. Most specimens have a rather indistinct crescent; some have no crescent. In a few specimens there is a weakly outlined dark mark posterior to the crescent. Some specimens in a series of tadpoles from 32 kilometers north of Morazán, Baja Verapaz, Guatemala, have faint dorsal blotches on the dorsal musculature, much like those in tadpoles of _Ptychohyla leonhardschultzei_.  _Comparisons._--_Ptychohyla spinipollex_ differs from all other species in the genus by having moderate-sized, instead of small, pointed nuptial spines; also it has fewer spines than the other species (see discussion of this character in Analysis of Data). The nearly equal interorbital breadth and width of the upper eyelid also is diagnostic of this species.  Other hylids sympatric with _Ptychohyla spinipollex_ include three species of _Plectrohyla_, each of which has a bony prepollex, heavy body, and rugose skin on the dorsum. The only other sympatric hylid that could be confused with _Ptychohyla spinipollex_ is _Hyla bromeliacea_, which has a round snout and yellowish tan dorsum not marked with dark brown.  _Life History._--At Finca Los Alpes, Guatemala, in July, 1960, and in August, 1961, calling males were found on bushes and trees along cascading mountain streams. The breeding call consists of a soft \"wraack,\" repeated at intervals of 45 seconds to four minutes. Each note has a duration of about .46 of a second and a rate of 147 pulses per second. The"]]]
