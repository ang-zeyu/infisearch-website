All fleas were _Ctenophthalmus pseudagyrtes_ Baker.]  Some fleas have a habitat preference as well as a host specificity. As voles from different areas were examined, different kinds of fleas were encountered. A population of free-living voles under observation on the Campus at Lawrence was parasitized only by _Ctenophthalmus pseudagyrtes_. From 90 prairie voles collected in a field of clover 4 miles northwest of Lawrence, the only species of flea recovered was _Orchopeas leucopus_. In both places the prairie vole was the most common mammal, but in the field of clover three deer mice (_P. maniculatus_) also were trapped. In a third field, one mile west of Lawrence, the prairie vole was host to both the above mentioned fleas. Here both the prairie vole and the cotton rat (_Sigmodon hispidus_) were common.  The host distribution of fleas on seven small mammals which lived in the same habitats as the prairie vole is given in table 6.

The mammals were collected at Lawrence, Douglas County, Kansas, between October, 1945, and June, 1946. These data are entirely from snap-trapped animals with the exception of those from _Microtus_ and _Pitymys_ which are from both snap-trapped and live-trapped animals.]  It is seen that some fleas are rather specific in their choice of hosts, and that others are commonly found on two or more small mammals in the same habitat. In each of these groups there are fleas which have a habitat preference, that is to say, the flea lives on the host when the host lives in a given habitat, but is absent when the host lives in another habitat.   GROUP 1: FLEAS WITH A HOST PREFERENCE  _Epitedia wenmanni_ was found on the white-footed mouse (_Peromyscus leucopus_) and only rarely on the prairie vole. _Corrodopsylla hamiltoni_ was taken only from the two kinds of shrews (_Blarina brevicauda_ and _Cryptotis parva_). Fleas on shrews may have a well-developed host preference. At any rate, Elton, Baker, Ford, and Gardner (1931) found that _Doratopsylla dasycnemus_ rarely strayed from its normal host (_Sorex araneus_) to other small mammals. _Peromyscopsylla scotti_ was taken from the white-footed mouse (_Peromyscus leucopus_), and had a habitat preference also. It was found only on those white-footed mice which were trapped in the woodlands at various places in Douglas County; white-footed mice which were trapped in areas of brush were free of this parasite.   GROUP 2: FLEAS COMMONLY FOUND ON TWO OR MORE KINDS OF SMALL MAMMALS  _Orchopeas leucopus_ was an outstanding example of this group. It was the most common flea on the deer mouse, the white-footed mouse, and the cotton rat. In certain areas it was common on the two voles (_Pitymys nemoralis_ and _Microtus ochrogaster_). _Ctenophthalmus pseudagyrtes_ is the most abundant flea on the two kinds of voles and on the large shrew (_Blarina brevicauda_), and was found sparingly on the cotton rat.  Several kinds of fleas do not belong in either of the above groups. Some fleas were accidental strays from mammals not included in table 6; and one flea (_Rectofrontia fraterna_) may prove to be a common nest parasite. _Orchopeas howardii_ is common on tree squirrels (_Sciurus niger_ and _S. carolinensis_). _Nosopsyllus fasciatus_ is a cosmopolitan flea on _Rattus norvegicus_. _Rectofrontia fraterna_ was taken once from a prairie vole. Since the only specimens in the University of Kansas Entomological Collections are from \"mouse nests,\" this flea may be found to be a nest inhabiting parasite.  Some fleas are possible bridges by which a blood parasite could be transmitted from one kind of a mammal to another. If _Ctenophthalmus pseudagyrtes_ acted as the intermediate host of a disease-causing organism, an epizootic from _Microtus ochrogaster_ might be transmitted to _Pitymys nemoralis_ or to _Sigmodon hispidus_ or _Blarina brevicauda_. There are several other such potential bridges for blood parasites. Although table 6 does not prove that individual fleas wander from one host to another, the frequency with which the several kinds of fleas are removed from live mice suggests that the fleas occasionally do so.   LICE (ANOPLURA)  Lice collected from the prairie vole were all of one species, _Hoplopleura acanthopus_ (Burmeister). Of 59 voles examined for the presence of lice, 33 were found to be parasitized; the 59 voles had an average of 3.4 lice each. Other mice which used the same runways as the prairie vole had their own species of Anoplura. The cotton rat was host to _Hoplopleura hirsuta_ Ferris, and the two species of _Peromyscus_ were parasitized by _Hoplopleura hesperomydis_ (Osborn).  The writer collected _Hoplopleura acanthopus_ from _Microtus californicus_ at Calaveras Dam, Alameda County, California, and from _M. pennsylvanicus_ at Ithaca, Tompkins County, New York. Elton, Ford, Baker, and Gardner (1931) recorded this same species from _M. argestis_ in England.  Lice on the prairie vole are the same species as those found on other species of _Microtus_ in other areas, but since Anoplura of the prairie vole do not parasitize the cotton rat, the white-footed mouse, and the deer mouse, this host specificity of lice makes it unlikely that lice would carry blood parasites from the prairie vole to any of the latter named rodents.   MITES (ACARINA EXCEPT IXODOIDEA)  Many of the small mammals examined in this study had mites, some of which were collected and identified. Mites were collected from other species of voles in several localities in the United States and in one locality in Canada; as voles in widely separated regions are sometimes hosts to the same species of mites, these records will be presented here.  The frequency of some kinds of mites in the identified material suggests that they are more abundant than other kinds. The occurrence of mites on small mammals from Lawrence, Kansas, is presented in table 7.  The following comments can be made concerning the specificity and geographic ranges of several species of mites:  _Liponyssus occidentalis_ Ewing was found only on _Cryptotis parva_.  _Eulaelaps stabularis_ (Koch) was one of the more common kinds found on the prairie vole. This mite is rather large (about 1 mm. long) and is frequently (with the following species) seen running through the pelage of its host. In addition to the records for this species in table 1, it was found to be a common parasite on _Pitymys pinetorum_ at Point Abino, Welland County, Ontario. Elton, Ford, Baker and Gardner (1931) found this same mite on _Apodemus sylvaticus_ and _Clethrionomys glareolus_ in England.  _Atricholaelaps glasgowi_, like the preceding species, was one of the commoner mites on the prairie vole. It was found also on _Pitymys pinetorum_ at Point Abino, Welland County, Ontario; on _Microtus pennsylvanicus_ at Ithaca, Tompkins County, New York; and on _M. californicus_ at Calaveras Dam, Alameda County, California.  _Atricholaelaps sigmodoni_ occurred only on the cotton rat.  _Laelaps kochi_ was less commonly found than _Eulaelaps stabularis_ and _Atricholaelaps glasgowi_. In Kansas the prairie vole and the cotton rat were hosts to _Laelaps kochi_, and it occurred on _Microtus pennsylvanicus_ at Ithaca, New York, and on _M. californicus_ at Berkeley, California.  Trombiculidae are commonly known by their larvae which are called chiggers or harvest mites. The white-footed mouse, the cotton rat, and the prairie vole were parasitized at Lawrence. In the winter these mites live in the ears of these small mammals, but in the summer they were found both in the ears and on the rump. Those obtained in winter were _Ascoschöngastia brevipes_ (Ewing); other species may be involved.  Listrophoridae was represented on the prairie vole by a species of _Myocoptes_ and a species of _Listrophorus_. These mites cling to the hairs of their host, and do not occur on the skin of the voles.  No evidence was seen that mites had any ill effect on the health of their hosts. No voles had scabs on the skin; and the ears were not swollen and disfigured as they sometimes are by chiggers. Although the identity of a specimen of mite could not be determined until it was mounted, a person could tell whether or not it was one of the larger, very active Laelaptidae, one of the hair-clinging Listrophoridae, or one of the tiny, orange Trombiculidae.  On July 12, 1946, three prairie voles were examined to determine the number of mites they supported. The voles were freshly caught, no one of them having been dead for more than five minutes before they were examined. These three voles had an average of 25 Laelaptidae, 22 Listrophoridae, and 53 Trombiculidae.  Six species of mites (Ixodoidea excepted) were found on the prairie vole. Four of these"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36286"],["title","Natural History of the Prairie Vole (Mammalian Genus Microtus) (#4)"],["body"," collected also from other small mammals living in the same habitat as this vole. Two species of mites were found to occur on voles in New York, Kansas, and California.   TICKS (IXODOIDEA)  Two kinds of ticks were found. One adult specimen of _Ixodes sculptus_ Neumann was clinging to the head of a vole, just in front of its eye. This species of tick was taken also from the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (_Citellus tridecimlineatus_) at Lawrence. One nymph of _Dermacentor variabilis_ (Say) was found attached to the scapular region of a prairie vole. Both of these specimens were taken in June.

The three age classes are characterized in table 8.  TABLE 8. _Characters of Juvenile, Subadult, and Adult Prairie Voles_      Juvenile              Subadult               Adult  Less than 21 grams       21-38 grams          38 grams or more  Weight usually less      Average weight       Average weight than 20 grams            30-32 grams          40-45 grams  Entire pelage dull       Pelage of rump       Pelage usually                          dull; rest of        entirely glossy                          pelage glossy        (rump sometimes dull)  Dorsal color black       Dorsal color         Entire dorsal color                          grizzled except      grizzled except                          on rump              sometimes on rump   FECUNDITY  Hamilton (1941:4) found for _Microtus pennsylvanicus_ that macroscopic tubules of the cauda epididymis were an indication of fecundity. By noting the size of the tubules (whether macroscopic or not) and by making smears from them in approximately every 25th male caught, I found that the presence of sperm was positively correlated with large-sized tubules of the cauda epididymis in _Microtus ochrogaster_. Inferentially, males with sperm were fecund.  There is a relationship almost positive between the size of the tubules of the cauda epididymis and the length of the testes. Testes longer than 7 mm. have macroscopic tubules in the cauda, and in testes shorter than 7 mm. these tubules cannot be seen with the naked eye, Hamilton (1937b) found that in _M. pennsylvanicus_ testes smaller than 8 × 4 mm. did not contain sperm. The testes of the prairie vole descend into the scrotum in the breeding season. In the two winter months, when the voles did not bring forth young, the testes decreased in size (see figure 3) and were withdrawn into the body cavity. The presence of the testes in the body cavity does not mean that a vole is not in breeding condition, for many specimens with abdominal testes were fecund.  The females were considered to be fecund if they were gravid, or if there were placental scars in the horns of the uteri.  [Illustration: FIGURE 2. Fecundity of Prairie Voles by Months. Adults and Subadults are Considered Together.]  [Illustration: FIGURE 3. Seasonal Changes in the Length of Testes.]   SIZE OF LITTERS  The number of mammae characteristic of a species of vole may be a rough guide to the average size of a litter for that species. The prairie vole has fewer mammae (three pairs) than some other voles in North America, and might, therefore, be expected to have smaller litters. Fifty-eight gravid females of _Microtus ochrogaster_ examined by me had an average of 3.4 embryos each; the number of embryos ranged from one to seven. Hamilton (1936a) gave 5.07 as the average number of young per litter in _M. pennsylvanicus_. Hatfield (1935) stated that _M. californicus_ has an average of 5.7 young in a litter. Both _pennsylvanicus_ and _californicus_ normally have four pairs of mammae. The expectation as to the size of the litter seems to be realized. In the prairie vole one pair of mammae is pectoral and two pairs are abdominal. Usually a lactating vole showed evidence of only the abdominal mammae having been in use.  The size of litters was found to vary with the season of the year (see table 9). Gravid females were collected in every breeding month except September.  TABLE 9. _Average Size of Litters of Microtus ochrogaster by Months_[G]  Jan.  Feb.  Mar.  Apr.  May  June  July  Aug.  Sept.  Oct.  Nov.

[Footnote G: These months are from October, 1945, until August, 1946. The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of gravid females collected each month.]  Table 9 shows that the prairie vole produced the largest litters in March. A comparison of table 9 with figure 2 shows that the largest litters were produced at the height of the breeding season. Baker and Ransom (1933), studying _Microtus agrestis_, also found that larger litters were characteristic of the height of the breeding season; and that at the beginning and at the end of the breeding season the litters averaged smaller.  The size of litters varied also with the age of the female. To place a gravid female in its proper age class, the weight of the embryos was subtracted from the total weight, and the remaining weight was used as the body weight. The average size of the litters of 14 subadults was 2.9, and in 35 adults it was 3.4. Hatfield (_op. cit._) found that the younger females of _M. californicus_ gave birth to smaller litters than did the adults.  Not included in either of the above analyses are nine gravid females collected in November in a pasture watered by an artesian spring in Atchison County, Kansas. In this pasture there was a high concentration of prairie voles, and the percentage of fecundity was much higher than in Douglas County at the same time. In November only 29 per cent of the female prairie voles in Douglas County were fecund, as against 59 per cent in Atchison County. The average number of embryos of these nine voles was 4.1. Data from Atchison County are not included in table 9.   THE BREEDING SEASON  In October, 1945, when this study was begun, the prairie vole was bringing forth young. In the winter of 1945-'46 at Lawrence, Kansas, there was a cessation of reproduction. The reproductive activity was measured in terms of the fecundity of the subadults and the adults of both sexes. Figure 2 suggests that the decline was most marked in December and January; no gravid females were collected in these two months, although two females trapped in the first week of December were lactating. In October, November, and December, 85 per cent of the breeding females were adults. In October, 85 per cent of the adult females were fecund, and in November, this figure was 80 per cent. Reproduction at this season, in the females, it appears, was largely a function of the adults. The proportion of adults to the rest of the population was calculated for each month; and the monthly changes in relative numbers of adults is shown in figure 4. In November, December, and January there was a scarcity of adult voles in the population. The autumnal decline in reproduction occurred simultaneously with the disappearance of these adults, and is thought to have been largely a result of it.  Reproductive activity began in February; and in this month one-third of the females contained embryos, and 90 per cent of the males were fecund. Reproduction reached its height in March when fecundity for the females and males was 77 per cent and 100 per cent respectively. In April both sexes showed signs of being less productive, and still later in the spring the percentage of fecundity remained at slightly over 65 for both sexes, this figure being higher for the males than for the females for any one month. From January to February there was a 30 per cent increase in the percentage of adults in the population; and for this period, there was a 33 per cent increase in the fecundity of both males and females. In February, 80 per cent of the fecund females were adults. The breeding in the late winter, as in the fall, is thought to depend upon the percentage of adults in the population. Hamilton (1937b) noted a similar correlation between winter breeding and dominance of adults in _Microtus pennsylvanicus_ in New York. Fisher (1945) found that the prairie vole continued to breed throughout the winter of 1943-'44 in Missouri; in such a case, one would expect to find a large proportion of adults in the population.  [Illustration: FIGURE 4. Seasonal Changes in the Numbers of Adults in Relation to the Total Population of Prairie Voles.]  Throughout the winter of 1945-'46, at Lawrence, the majority of males were fecund; but fecundity in the females was much less, and in January, no females showed signs of reproductive activity. From this it appears that the females,"]]]
