SUMMARY  A comparative study of the breeding behavior of the Seaside Sparrow and Sharp-tailed Sparrow was made in New Jersey in 1955.  Observations of marked individuals indicate that the Seaside Sparrow is monogamous and territorial, whereas the Sharp-tailed Sparrow is promiscuous, and at least the male is non-territorial. The male Seaside Sparrow defends its territory by chasing and singing. The male Sharp-tailed Sparrow confines itself to a breeding home range. This range is not a territory; it is inhabited by several males. Female Sharp-tailed Sparrows may be territorial; this is not certainly known.  The Seaside Sparrow sings louder, more distinctly, more often, and from more exposed perches than does the Sharp-tailed Sparrow. These characteristics seem to be correlated with territorial habits. Other calls are described and their functions are discussed.  The Seaside Sparrow nests in marsh-elder bushes, or in areas of mixed vegetation. The Sharp-tailed Sparrow prefers the inner, drier areas of a marsh, where black grass is dominant. The Seaside Sparrow places its nest farther above the ground than does the Sharp-tailed Sparrow. Both species used only black grass in constructing the nest.  Copulation is described. The incubation period was not determined for either species. Three or four eggs seem to be a normal clutch. Females do all of the incubating.  The young remained in the nests nine to ten days. These nests, of course were disturbed, for I visited them at least daily. The nestlings of the Seaside Sparrow are fed by both parents. Male Sharp-tailed Sparrows seem not to know the location of the nests and take no part in rearing the young at least up to time of fledging. The natal down of both species is described. Data on growth and behavior of the young are presented.  Seaside Sparrows obtained most of their food from the shoreline of the marsh, in areas of open mud and smooth cord-grass. The plumage of the adult matches, in color, this mud. The Sharp-tailed Sparrow feeds everywhere in the marsh, but mostly in areas of dense and matted black grass. The plumage on the dorsum of this species is brown and streaked resembling the dead grass. Juvenal Seaside Sparrows, which spend most of their time concealed in the dense grass, resemble adult and juvenal Sharp-tailed Sparrows in plumage. Sharp-tailed Sparrows molt completely twice per year. The Seaside Sparrow molts but once per year. The difference in number of molts, too, is correlated with habitat preference, since the grassy forage habitat of the Sharp-tailed Sparrow must result in greater abrasion of the plumage than does the open feeding habitat of the Seaside Sparrow.

The color on the dorsum is dark gray with a grizzled appearance from the mixture of black and fulvous on the long hairs; the venter is paler, sometimes pale fulvous or cinnamon. The animal is compactly built much as are the other microtine rodents. The short legs and short tail, small eyes and partly hidden ears, and heavy and flattened head all suggest its semifossorial mode of life. The prairie vole spends most of its time in an elaborate system of tunnels (some entirely below the ground) and in almost hidden galleries in the dense grass.  _Microtus ochrogaster_ can be separated from other voles in its geographic range by a combination of several characters. The plantar tubercles usually number five, although a few individuals with six tubercles were found at Lawrence, Kansas. _Microtus pennsylvanicus_, normally with six plantar tubercles, as Bole and Moulthrop (1942:156) pointed out, sometimes has only five. Therefore, the number of plantar tubercles alone is not a certain means for separating _pennsylvanicus_ from _ochrogaster_. The color of the venter of _ochrogaster_ is usually fulvous or cinnamon instead of grayish as in _pennsylvanicus_, but there is variation in this respect too; some prairie voles also have a grayish venter. The shorter tail of _ochrogaster_ will assist in establishing its identity where it occurs with _pennsylvanicus_. The third upper molar has two closed triangles in _ochrogaster_ and usually three in _pennsylvanicus_. The pelage of _ochrogaster_ is coarse whereas _pennsylvanicus_ has fine fur. Prairie voles may be separated from pine mice (_Pitymys nemoralis_ and _P. pinetorum_) with which they are sometimes found, by the larger eyes, less rusty color, and longer tail. The Cooper lemming mouse (_Synaptomys cooperi_) differs from the prairie vole in having the upper incisors grooved, and in possessing a shorter tail which approximates the hind foot in length.  Of _Microtus ochrogaster_ from Lawrence, Douglas County, Kansas, average measurements of twenty-five adult males are: total length, 143 (121-167) mm.; tail, 32 (25-42) mm.; hind feet, 20 (17-22) mm.; weight, 43 (38-55) grams. Twenty-five adult females from the same place average: total length, 150 (131-170) mm.; tail, 33 (31-41) mm.; hind foot, 19 (17-21) mm.; weight, 45 (38-58) grams.  The prairie vole is found in suitable habitats in the central part of North America. It has been recorded from Edmonton, Alberta, in the northwest (Bailey, 1900:76), southeastward to Chesapeake, Ohio (Bole and Moulthrop, _op. cit._:156), and in the southwest as far as Ft. Reno, Oklahoma (Bailey, _op. cit._:74). See figure 1 showing the known range of _Microtus ochrogaster_. _Microtus ludovicianus_, a close relative of _ochrogaster_, has been taken along the southern part of the boundary between Texas and Louisiana (Lowery, 1943:247).  The activities of voles, especially those of the genus _Microtus_, attracted the attention of naturalists even in early times. Aristotle (translated by Thompson, 1910) wrote: \"The rate of propagation of field mice in country places, and the destruction that they cause, are all beyond telling. In many places their number is so incalculable that but very little of the corn-crop is left to the farmer; and so rapid is their mode of proceeding that sometimes a small farmer will one day observe that it is time for reaping, and on the following morning, when he takes his reapers afield, he finds his entire crop devoured. Their disappearance is unaccountable: in a few days not a mouse will be there to be seen.\"  [Illustration: FIGURE 1. Range of the Prairie Vole (_Microtus ochrogaster_).]  Several early naturalists in this country commented on the fluctuations in numbers of individuals, and on the breeding and feeding habits of voles. Kennicott (1857) in an agricultural report on the mammals of Illinois wrote about the breeding of the prairie vole. He described its stores of plants and commented on the behavior of some captives. Quick and Butler (1885) discussed the habits of _Microtus ochrogaster_ as well as those of _M. pennsylvanicus_, _Pitymys pinetorum_, and _Synaptomys cooperi_ in Indiana, and described the feeding and breeding habits of these species. Criddle (1926) gave an account of the feeding and breeding habits of _Microtus ochrogaster_ in Manitoba, and Fisher (1945) published a short description of the food and reproduction of the same species as he observed it in Missouri. Stone investigated the fauna in the nests of this vole in the same state, but has not yet, as of March, 1946, published his findings.     METHODS   The information in the present account was obtained by observing animals in the field, and by examining trapped animals that were brought into the laboratory. Five hundred individuals were caught in snap-traps, and forty additional voles that were marked were captured a total of 157 times. More than 90 per cent of the specimens were trapped at Lawrence, Douglas County, Kansas, but voles were examined also in Ellsworth, Atchison, and Jefferson counties, Kansas, and in Douglas County, Illinois. My data pertain to _Microtus ochrogaster_ in the above named areas from October, 1945, until August, 1946. The findings may not be typical of this species in other areas and in other years.  The museum special traps were used both with and without bait. The bait consisted of a piece of walnut meat on the treadle. By placing the trap crosswise in the runway, voles were captured whether or not the treadle was baited. Immediately upon removal from the trap, each vole was placed in a white flannel sack, one sack sufficing for several voles when necessary. In this way the loss of ectoparasites was kept to a minimum. The fleas were counted, and the numbers of lice and mites were estimated; some specimens of ectoparasites were saved for identification.  The voles taken in live traps were marked and released. The marking was done by cutting off one or more toes in such a manner that the vole could later be identified. From left to right, the toes were assigned numbers from one to five on the left hind foot, and by tens from ten to fifty on the right hind foot. Number 33, therefore, was assigned to the one vole of which the middle toe of each hind foot had been cut off. Each time an animal was captured alive, it was weighed, specimens of fleas, lice and mites were preserved, and the external appearance of the reproductive organs was noted. The extent of the molt line, if the vole was molting, was recorded. Corresponding data were kept for each dead vole caught in a snap trap.  Assistance is acknowledged from Professors E. Raymond Hall, A. Byron Leonard, Worthie H. Horr, and Donald F. Hoffmeister; and I have had also much helpful advice from Professors W. J. Hamilton, Jr., and P. C. Stone.     MOLT   The skins of 44 molting prairie voles were pinned out flat. The flesh sides clearly show the areas of molt. Various stages in the molt process were observed also in animals caught in live traps. The molt begins when the animal is three or four weeks old; at this time the juvenal pelage is replaced by the subadult pelage. The second molt occurs when the prairie vole is between eight and twelve weeks old, and is the means by which the adult pelage replaces the subadult pelage. These same two molts were found by Hatfield (1935) to occur in captive _Microtus californicus_. Molting voles of the species ochrogaster were trapped in each month of the year.  The molting processes of juveniles and subadults follow the same pattern. The first area of molting is in the pectoral region. The molt patch extends caudad toward the tail and cephalad toward the chin. New pelage separates this area of active molt into two strips on the fourth or fifth day. By this time each strip has spread laterad to the legs and sides, and is 10 to 20 mm. wide. Ultimately each strip unites with its opposite, usually at the center of the dorsum. This area of molt then spreads cephalad and caudad. Fourteen to fifteen days after the"]]]
