It has already been shown how improbable it is that his journey was made previous to 1634. It only remains, therefore, to give his whereabouts previous to 1640, and subsequent to 1635. His presence in Three Rivers, according to Mr. Sulte (see Appendix, I., to this narrative), is noted in the parish register in December, 1635; in May, 1636; in November and December, 1637; in March, 1638; in January, March, July, October, and December, 1639. As to mention of him in the _Relations_ during those years, see the next chapter of this work.  It was the identification by Mr. Shea, of the Winnebagoes as the \"Ouinipigou,\" or \"Gens de Mer,\" of the _Relations_, that enabled him to call the attention of the public to the extent of the discoveries of Nicolet. The claims of the latter, as the discoverer of the Northwest, were thus, for the first time, brought forward on the page of American history.]  [Footnote 24: \"Le huictiesme de Iuin, le Capitaine des Naiz percez, ou de la Nation du Castor, qui est à trois iournées de nous, vint nous demander quelqu'vn de nos François, pour aller auec eux passer l'Este dans vn fort qu'ils ont fait, pour la crainte qu'ils ont des _A8eatsi8aenrrhonon_, c'est à dire, des gens puants, qui ont rompu le traicté de paix, et ont tuè deux de leurs dont ils ont fait festin.\"--Le Jeune, _Relation_, 1636, p. 92.  \"On the 18th of June [1635], the chief of the Nez Percés, or Beaver Nation, which is three days' journey from us [the Jesuit missionaries, located at the head of Georgian bay of Lake Huron], came to demand of us some one of our Frenchmen to go with them to pass the summer in a fort which they have made, by reason of the fear which they have of the _Aweatiswaenrrhonon_;[A] that is to say, of the Nation of the Puants [Winnebagoes], who have broken the treaty of peace, and have killed two of their men, of whom they have made a feast.\"]  [Footnote A: The figure 8 which occurs in this word in the _Relation_ of 1636, is supposed to be equivalent, in English, to \"w,\" \"we,\" or \"oo.\"]  [Footnote 25: 'Iean Nicolet, en son voyage qu'il fit auec nous iusques à l'Isle souffrit aussi tous les trauaux d'vn des plus robustes Sauuages.'--Brébeuf, _Relation_, 1635, p. 30.]  [Footnote 26: Parkman's \"Jesuits in North America,\" p. 53.]  [Footnote 27: The Mattawan has its source on the very verge of Lake Nipissing, so that it was easy to make a \"portage\" there to reach the lake. The Indians, and afterward the French, passed by the Mattawan, Mattouane, or Mattawin (\"the residence of the beaver\"), went over the small space of land called the \"portage,\" that exists between the two waters, floated on Lake Nipissing, and followed the French river, which flows directly out of that lake to the Georgian bay.  A \"portage\" is a place, as is well known, where parties had to \"port\" their baggage in order to reach the next navigable water.]  [Footnote 28: Vimont, _Relation_, 1643, p. 3.]  [Footnote 29: \"Sieur Nicolet, interpreter en langue Algonquine et Huronne,\" etc.--Vimont, _Relation_, 1640, p. 35.  The Hurons and Nipissings were, at that date, great friends, having constant intercourse, according to all accounts of those days.]  [Footnote 30: \"The People of the Sea\"--that is, the Winnebagoes--were frequently at war with the Hurons, Nez Percés, and other nations on the Georgian bay, which fact was well known to the governor of Canada. Now, the good offices of Nicolet were to be interposed to bring about a reconciliation between these nations. He, it is believed, was also to carry out Champlain's policy of making the Indian tribes the allies of the French. Vimont (_Relation_, 1643, p. 3) says, he was chosen to make a journey to the Winnebagoes and treat for peace with them _and with the Hurons_; showing, it is suggested, that it was not only to bring about a peace _between the two tribes_, but to attach them both to French interests. The words of Vimont are these:  \"Pendant qu'il exerçoit cette charge, il [_Nicolet_] fut delegué pour faire vn voyage en la nation appellée des Gens de Mer, et traitter la paix auec eux et les Hurons, desquels il sont esloignés, tirant, vers l'Oüest, d'enuiron trois cents lieuës.\"]  [Footnote 31: \"Il [_Nicolet_] s'embarque au pays des Hurons avec sept Sauuages.\"--Vimont, _Relation_, 1643, p. 3.]  [Footnote 32: Saint Mary's strait separates the Dominion of Canada from the upper peninsula of Michigan, and connects Lake Superior with Lake Huron.]  [Footnote 33: The route taken by Nicolet, from the mouth of French river, in journeying toward the Winnebagoes, is sufficiently indicated by (1) noting that, in mentioning the various tribes visited by him, Nicolet probably gave their names, except the Ottawas, in the order in which he met them; and (2) by calculating his time as more limited on his return than on his outward trip, because of his desire to descend the Ottawa with the annual flotilla of Huron canoes, which would reach the St. Lawrence in July, 1635.]  [Footnote 34: The Ouasouarim, the Outchougai, and the Atchiligoüan.--Vimont, _Relation_, 1640, p. 34.]  [Footnote 35: Called Amikoüai (_Rel._, 1640, p. 34), from _Amik_ or _Amikou_--a beaver.]  [Footnote 36: The Manitoulin islands stretch from east to west along the north shores of Lake Huron, and consist chiefly of the Great Manitoulin or Sacred Isle, Little Manitoulin or Cockburn, and Drummond. Great Manitoulin is eighty miles long by twenty broad. Little Manitoulin has a diameter of about seven miles. Drummond is twenty-four miles long, with a breadth varying from two to twelve miles. It is separated from the American shore, on the west, by a strait called the True Detour, which is scarcely one mile wide, and forms the principal passage for vessels proceeding to Lake Superior.]  [Footnote 37: The Oumisagai.--Vimont, _Relation_, 1640, p. 34.]  [Footnote 38: These falls are distinctly marked on Champlain's map of 1632; and on that of Du Creux of 1660.]  [Footnote 39: In giving Nicolet this credit, it is necessary to state, that the governor of Canada, in 1688, claimed that honor for Champlain (N. Y. Col. Doc, Vol. IX., p. 378). He says:  \"In the years 1611 and 1612, he [Champlain] ascended the Grand river [Ottawa] as far as Lake Huron, called the Fresh sea [La Mer Douce]; he went thence to the Petun [Tobacco] Nation, next to the Neutral Nation and to the Macoutins [Mascoutins], who were then residing near the place called the Sakiman [that part of the present State of Michigan lying between the head of Lake Erie and Saginaw bay, on Lake Huron]; from that he went to the Algonquin and Huron tribes, at war against the Iroquois [Five Nations]. He passed by places he has, himself, described in his book [Les Voyages De La Novvelle France, etc., 1632], which are no other than Detroit [_i.e._, \"the straight,\" now called Detroit river] and Lake Erie.\"--_Mem. of M. de Denonville_, _May 8, 1688_.  The reader is referred to Champlain's Map of 1632, and to \"his book\" of the same date, for a complete refutation of the assertion as to his visiting, at any time before that year, the Mascoutins. In 1632, Champlain, as shown by his map of that year, had no knowledge whatever of Lake Erie or Lake St. Clair, nor had he previously been so far west as Detroit river. It is, of course, well known, that he did not go west of the St. Lawrence during that year or subsequent to that date. Locating the Mascoutins \"near the place called the Sakiman,\" is as erroneous as that Champlain ever visited those savages. The reported distance between him when at the most westerly point of his journeyings and the Mascoutins is shown by himself: \"After having visited these people [the Tobacco Nation, in December, 1615] we left the place and came to a nation of Indians which we have named the Standing Hair [Ottawas], who were very much rejoiced to see us again [he had met them previously on the Ottawa river], with whom also we formed a friendship, and who, in like manner, promised to come and find us and see us at the said habitation. At this place it seems to me appropriate to give a description of their country, manners, and modes of action. In the first place, they make war upon another nation of Indians, called the Assistagueronon, which means nation of fire [Mascoutins], ten days distant from them.\"--_Voyages_, 1632, I., p. 262 [272].  Upon his map of 1632, Champlain speaks of the \"discoveries\" made by him \"in the year 1614 and 1615, until in the year 1618\"--\"of this great lake [Huron], and of all the lands _from the Sault St. Louis_ [the rapids in the St. Lawrence];\"--but he nowhere intimates that he had made discoveries _west_ of that lake. It is, therefore, certain that the first white man who ever saw or explored any portion of the territory forming the present State of Michigan was John Nicolet--not Champlain. Compare Parkman's \"Pioneers of France in the New World,\" Chap. XIV., and map illustrative of the text.]  [Footnote 40: Their name, as stated by Nicolet and preserved in the _Relation_ of 1640, was Baouichtigouin; given in the _Relation_ of 1642, as Paüoitigoüeieuhak--\"inhabitants of the falls;\" in the _Relation_ of 1648, as Paouitagoung--\"nation of the Sault;\" on Du Creux' map of 1660, \"Pasitig8ecü;\" and they were sometimes known as Paouitingouach-irini--\"the men of the shallow cataract.\" They were estimated, in 1671, at one hundred and fifty souls. They then united with other kindred nations.  By the French, these tribes, collectively, were called Sauteurs; but they were known to the Iroquois as Estiaghicks, or Stiagigroone--the termination, _roone_, meaning men, being applied to Indians of the Algonquin family. They were designated by the Sioux as Raratwaus or \"people of the falls.\" They were the ancestors of the modern Otchipwes, or Ojibwas (Chippewas).]  [Footnote 41: That this was the location in 1641 is certain.

My inducement to this enterprise was the spectacle of very inferior rubbish palmed off by so-called popular novelists such as Honbles Kipling, Joshua Barrie, Antony Weyman, Stanley Hope, and the collaborative but feminine authoresses of \"The Red Thumb in the Pottage,\" all of whom profess (very, very incorrectly) to give accurate reliable descriptions of Indian, English or Scotch episodes.  The pity of it, that a magnificent and gullible British Public should be suckled like a babe on such spoonmeat and small beer!  Would no one arise, inflamed by the pure enthusiasm of his _cacoethes scribendi_, and write a romance which shall secure the plerophory of British, American, Anglo-Indian, Colonial, and Continental readers by dint of its imaginary power and slavish fidelity to Nature?  And since Echo answered that no one replied to this invitation, I (like a fool, as some will say) rushed in where angels were apprehensive of being too bulky to be borne.  Being naturally acquainted with gentlemen of my own nationality and education, and also, of course, knowing London and suburban society _ab ovo usque ad mala_ (or, from the new-laid egg to the stage when it is beginning to go bad), I decided to take as my theme the adventures of a typically splendid representative of Young India on British soil, and I am in earnest hopes to avoid the shocking solecisms and exaggerations indulged in by ordinary English novelists.  I have been compelled to take to penmanship of this sort owing to pressure of _res angusta domi_, the immoderate increase of hostages to fortune, and proportionate falling off of emoluments from my profession as Barrister-at-Law.  Therefore, I hope that all concerned will smile favourably upon my new departure, and will please kindly understand that, if my English literary style has suffered any deterioration, it is solely due to my being out of practice, and such spots on the sun must be excused as mere flies in ointment.  After forming my resolution of writing a large novel, I confided it to my crony, Mr Ram Ashootosh Lall, who warmly recommended me to persevere in such a _magnum opus_. So I became divinely inflated periodically every evening from 8 to 12 P.M., disregarding all entreaties from feminine relatives to stop and indulge in a blow-out on ordinary eatables, like Archimedes when Troy was captured, who was so engrossed in writing prepositions on the sand that he was totally unaware that he was being barbarously slaughtered.  And at length my colossal effusion was completed, and I had written myself out; after which I had the indescribable joy and felicity to read my composition to my mothers-in-law and wives and their respective progenies and offspring, whereupon, although they were not acquainted with a word of English, they were overcome by such severe admiration for my fecundity and native eloquence that they swooned with rapture.  I am not a superstitious, but I took the trouble to consult a soothsayer, as to the probable fortunes of my undertaking, and he at once confidently predicted that my novel was to render all readers dumb as fishes with sheer amazement and prove a very fine feather in my cap.  For all the above reasons, I am modestly confident that it will be generally recognised as a masterpiece, especially when it is remembered that it is the work of a native Indian, whose 'prentice hand is still a novice in wielding the _currente calamo_ of fiction.  I cannot conclude without some allusion to the drawings which are, I believe, to adorn my work, but which I have not yet been enabled to inspect, owing to the fact that, having fish of more importance to fry at the time, I commissioned a certain young English friend (the same who furnished sundry poetic headings for chapters) to engage a designer for the pictorial department.  Needless to say, I intended that he was to award the apple only to some Royal Academician of distinguished talents--yet at the eleventh hour, when too late to make other arrangements, I am informed that the job has been entrusted to a certain Birnadhur Pahtridhji, whose name (though probably incorrectly transcribed) certainly denotes a draughtsman of native Indian origin!  Whether he is fully competent for such a task I cannot at present say. But, unless he is qualified, like myself, by actual residence in Great Britain, I fear that he may not possess sufficient familiarity with the customs and solecisms of English society to avoid at least a few ludicrous and even lamentable mistakes.  To guard against such contingencies I shall insert a note or comment opposite each picture as it is submitted to me, pointing out in what respects (if any) the artist has failed to represent the author's intentions.  I sincerely hope that I may now and then be able to pat the aforesaid Mr P. on the back instead of acting as a Rhadamanthus to rap his knuckles.     CHAPTER I  FROM CALCUTTA TO CAMBRIDGE OVERSEA ROUTE      At sea the stoutest stomach jerks,     Far, far away from native soil,     When Ocean's heaving waterworks     Burst out in Brobdingnagian boil!      _Stanza written at Sea, by H. B. J. (unpublished)._   The waves of Neptune erected their seething and angry crests to incredible altitudes; overhead in fuliginous storm-clouds the thunder rumbled its terrific bellows, and from time to time the ghastly flare of lightning illuminated the entire neighbourhood. The tempest howled like a lost dog through the cordage of the good ship _Rohilkund_ (Captain O. Williams), which lurched through the vasty deep as though overtaken by the drop too much.  At one moment her poop was pointed towards celestial regions; at another it aimed itself at the recesses of Davey Jones's locker; and such was the fury of the gale that only a paucity of the ship's passengers remained perpendicular, and Mr Chunder Bindabun Bhosh was recumbent on his beam end, prostrated by severe sickishness, and hourly expecting to become initiated in the Great Secret.  Bitterly did he lament his hard lines in venturing upon the Black Water, to be snipped off in the flower of his adolescence, and never again to behold the beloved visages of his relations!  So heartrending were his tears and groans that they moved all on board, and Honble Mr Commissioner Copsey, who was returning on leave, kindly came to inquire the cause of such vociferous lachrymation.  \"What is the matter, Baboo?\" began the Commissioner in paternal tones. \"Why are you kicking up the shindy of such a deuce's own hullabaloo?\"  \"Because, honble Sir,\" responded Mr Bhosh, \"I am in lively expectation that waters will rush in and extinguish my vital spark.\"  \"Pooh!\" said Mr Commissioner, genially. \"This is only the moiety of a gale, and there is not the slightest danger.\"  Having received this assurance, Mr Bhosh's natural courage revived, and, coming up on deck, he braved the tempest with the cool composure of a cucumber, admonishing all his fellow-passengers that they were not to give way to panic, seeing that Death was the common lot of all, and, though everyone must die once, it was an experience that could not be repeated, with much philosophy of a similar kind which astonished many who had falsely supposed him to be a pusillanimous.  The remainder of the voyage was uneventful, and, soon after setting his feet on British territory, Mr Bhosh became an alumnus and undergraduate of the _Alma Mater_ of Cambridge.  I shall not attempt to relate at any great length the history of his collegiate career, because, being myself a graduate of Calcutta University, I am not, of course, proficient in the customs and etiquettes of any rival seminaries, and should probably make one or two trivial slips which would instantly be pounced upon and held up for derision by carping critics.  So I shall content myself with mentioning a few leading facts and incidents. Mr Bhosh very soon wormed himself into the good graces of his fellow college boys, and his principal friend and _fidus Achates_ was a young high-spirited aristocrat entitled Lord Jack Jolly, the only son of an earl who had lately been promoted to the dignity of a baronetcy.  Lord Jolly and Mr Bhosh were soon as"]]]
