COUSIN'S          Lectures on the True, the Beautiful, and the Good,                   IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED,         IN ADMIRATION OF A PROFOUND AND INDEPENDENT THINKER,          OF AN INCOMPARABLE MASTER OF PHILOSOPHIC CRITICISM;             AS A TOKEN OF ESTEEM FOR A MAN IN WHOM GENIUS                  AND ALMOST UNEQUALLED LEARNING                       HAVE BEEN ADORNED BY               TRUTH, BEAUTY, AND GOODNESS OF LIFE.     AUTHOR'S PREFACE.   For some time past we have been asked, on various sides, to collect in a body of doctrine the theories scattered in our different works, and to sum up, in just proportions, what men are pleased to call our philosophy.  This _résumé_ was wholly made. We had only to take again the lectures already quite old, but little known, because they belonged to a time when the courses of the Faculté des Lettres had scarcely any influence beyond the Quartier Latin, and, also, because they could be found only in a considerable collection, comprising all our first instruction, from 1815 to 1821.[1] These lectures were there, as it were, lost in the crowd. We have drawn them hence, and give them apart, severely corrected, in the hope that they will thus be accessible to a greater number of readers, and that their true character will the better appear.  The eighteen lectures that compose this volume have in fact the particular trait that, if the history of philosophy furnishes their frame-work, philosophy itself occupies in them the first place, and that, instead of researches of erudition and criticism, they present a regular exposition of the doctrine which was at first fixed in our mind, which has not ceased to preside over our labors.  This book, then, contains the abridged but exact expression of our convictions on the fundamental points of philosophic science. In it will be openly seen the method that is the soul of our enterprise, our principles, our processes, our results.  Under these three heads, the True, the Beautiful, the Good, we embrace psychology, placed by us at the head of all philosophy, æsthetics, ethics, natural right, even public right to a certain extent, finally theodicea, that perilous _rendez-vous_ of all systems, where different principles are condemned or justified by their consequences.  It is the affair of our book to plead its own cause. We only desire that it may be appreciated and judged according to what it really is, and not according to an opinion too much accredited.  Eclecticism is persistently represented as the doctrine to which men deign to attach our name. We declare that eclecticism is very dear to us, for it is in our eyes the light of the history of philosophy; but the source of that light is elsewhere. Eclecticism is one of the most important and most useful applications of the philosophy which we teach, but it is not its principle.  Our true doctrine, our true flag is spiritualism, that philosophy as solid as generous, which began with Socrates and Plato, which the Gospel has spread abroad in the world, which Descartes put under the severe forms of modern genius, which in the seventeenth century was one of the glories and forces of our country, which perished with the national grandeur in the eighteenth century, which at the commencement of the present century M. Royer-Collard came to re-establish in public instruction, whilst M. de Chateaubriand, Madame de Staël, and M. Quatremère de Quincy transferred it into literature and the arts. To it is rightly given the name of spiritualism, because its character in fact is that of subordinating the senses to the spirit, and tending, by all the means that reason acknowledges, to elevate and ennoble man. It teaches the spirituality of the soul, the liberty and responsibility of human actions, moral obligation, disinterested virtue, the dignity of justice, the beauty of charity; and beyond the limits of this world it shows a God, author and type of humanity, who, after having evidently made man for an excellent end, will not abandon him in the mysterious development of his destiny. This philosophy is the natural ally of all good causes. It sustains religious sentiment; it seconds true art, poesy worthy of the name, and a great literature; it is the support of right; it equally repels the craft of the demagogue and tyranny; it teaches all men to respect and value themselves, and, little by little, it conducts human societies to the true republic, that dream of all generous souls which in our times can be realized in Europe only by constitutional monarchy.  To aid, with all our power, in setting up, defending, and propagating this noble philosophy, such is the object that early inspired us, that has sustained during a career already lengthy, in which difficulties have not been wanting. Thank God, time has rather strengthened than weakened our convictions, and we end as we began: this new edition of one of our first works is a last effort in favor of the holy cause for which we have combated nearly forty years.  May our voice be heard by new generations as it was by the serious youth of the Restoration! Yes, it is particularly to you that we address this work, young men whom we no longer know, but whom we bear in our heart, because you are the seed and the hope of the future. We have shown you the principle of our evils and their remedy. If you love liberty and your country, shun what has destroyed them. Far from you be that sad philosophy which preaches to you materialism and atheism as new doctrines destined to regenerate the world: they kill, it is true, but they do not regenerate. Do not listen to those superficial spirits who give themselves out as profound thinkers, because after Voltaire they have discovered difficulties in Christianity: measure your progress in philosophy by your progress in tender veneration for the religion of the Gospel. Be well persuaded that, in France, democracy will always traverse liberty, that it brings all right into disorder, and through disorder into dictatorship. Ask, then, only a moderated liberty, and attach yourself to that with all the powers of your soul. Do not bend the knee to fortune, but accustom yourselves to bow to law. Entertain the noble sentiment of respect. Know how to admire,--possess the worship of great men and great things. Reject that enervating literature, by turns gross and refined, which delights in painting the miseries of human nature, which caresses all our weaknesses, which pays court to the senses and the imagination, instead of speaking to the soul and awakening thought. Guard yourselves against the malady of our century, that fatal taste of an accommodating life, incompatible with all generous ambition. Whatever career you embrace, propose to yourselves an elevated aim, and put in its service an unalterable constancy. _Sursum corda_, value highly your heart, wherein is seen all philosophy, that which we have retained from all our studies, which we have taught to your predecessors, which we leave to you as our last word, our final lecture.

Cousin.  We have attempted to render his book, without comment, faithfully into English. Not only have we endeavored to give his thought without increase or diminution, but have also tried to preserve the main characteristics of his style. On the one hand, we have carefully shunned idioms peculiar to the French; on the other, when permitted by the laws of structure common to both languages, we have followed the general order of sentences, even the succession of words. It has been our aim to make this work wholly Cousin's in substance, and in form as nearly his as possible, with a total change of dress. That, however, we may have nowhere missed a shade of meaning, nowhere introduced a gallicism, is too much to be hoped for, too much to be demanded.  M. Cousin, in his Philosophical Discussions, defines the terms that he uses. In the translation of these we have maintained uniformity, so that in this regard no farther explanation is necessary.  This is, perhaps, in a philosophical point of view, the most important of all M. Cousin's works, for it contains a complete summary and lucid exposition of the various parts of his system. It is now the last word of European philosophy, and merits serious and thoughtful attention.  This and many more like it, are needed in these times, when noisy and pretentious demagogues are speaking of metaphysics with idiotic laughter, when utilitarian statesmen are sneering at philosophy, when undisciplined sectarians of every kind are decrying it; when, too, earnest men, in state and church, men on whose shoulders the social world really rests, are invoking philosophy, not only as the best instrument of the highest culture and the severest mental discipline, but also as the best human means of guiding politics towards the eternally true and the eternally just, of preserving theology from the aberrations of a zeal without knowledge, and from the perversion of the interested and the cunning; when many an artist, who feels the nobility of his calling, who would address the mind of man rather than his senses, is asking a generous philosophy to explain to him that ravishing and torturing Ideal which is ever eluding his grasp, which often discourages unless understood; when, above all, devout and tender souls are learning to prize philosophy, since, in harmony with Revelation, it strengthens their belief in God, freedom, immortality.  Grateful to an indulgent public, on both sides of the ocean, for a kindly and very favorable reception of our version of M. Cousin's \"Course of the History of Modern Philosophy,\" we add this translation of his \"Lectures on the True, the Beautiful, and the Good,\" hoping that his explanation of human nature will aid some in solving the grave problem of life,--for there are always those, and the most gifted, too, who feel the need of understanding themselves,--believing that his eloquence, his elevated sentiment, and elevated thought, will afford gratification to a refined taste, a chaste imagination, and a disciplined mind.

PART FIRST.--THE TRUE.  LECTURE I.--THE EXISTENCE OF UNIVERSAL AND NECESSARY PRINCIPLES       39      Two great wants, that of absolute truths, and that of absolute     truths that may not be chimeras. To satisfy these two wants is     the problem of the philosophy of our time.--Universal and     necessary principles.--Examples of different kinds of such     principles.--Distinction between universal and necessary     principles and general principles.--Experience alone is     incapable of explaining universal and necessary principles, and     also incapable of dispensing with them in order to arrive at the     knowledge of the sensible world.--Reason as being that faculty     of ours which discovers to us these principles.--The study of     universal and necessary principles introduces us to the highest     parts of philosophy.  LECTURE II.--ORIGIN OF UNIVERSAL AND NECESSARY PRINCIPLES             51      _Résumé_ of the preceding Lecture. A new question, that of the     origin of universal and necessary principles.--Danger of this     question, and its necessity.--Different forms under which truth     presents itself to us, and the successive order of these forms:     theory of spontaneity and reflection.--The primitive form of     principles; abstraction that disengages them from that form,     and gives them their actual form.--Examination and refutation of     the theory that attempts to explain the origin of principles by     an induction founded on particular notions.  LECTURE III.--ON THE VALUE OF UNIVERSAL AND NECESSARY PRINCIPLES      65      Examination and refutation of Kant's skepticism.--Recurrence to     the theory of spontaneity and reflection.  LECTURE IV.--GOD THE PRINCIPLE OF PRINCIPLES                          75      Object of the lecture: What is the ultimate basis of absolute     truth?--Four hypotheses: Absolute truth may reside either in us,     in particular beings and the world, in itself, or in God. 1. We     perceive absolute truth, we do not constitute it. 2. Particular     beings participate in absolute truth, but do not explain it;     refutation of Aristotle. 3. Truth does not exist in itself;     defence of Plato. 4. Truth resides in God.--Plato; St.     Augustine; Descartes; Malebranche; Fénelon; Bossuet;     Leibnitz.--Truth the mediator between God and man.--Essential     distinctions.  LECTURE V.--ON MYSTICISM                                             102      Distinction between the philosophy that we profess and     mysticism. Mysticism consists in pretending to know God without     an intermediary.--Two sorts of mysticism.--Mysticism of     sentiment. Theory of sensibility. Two sensibilities--the one     external, the other internal, and corresponding to the soul as     external sensibility corresponds to nature.--Legitimate part of     sentiment.--Its aberrations.--Philosophical mysticism. Plotinus:     God, or absolute unity, perceived without an intermediary by     pure thought.--Ecstasy.--Mixture of superstition and abstraction     in mysticism.--Conclusion of the first part of the course.   PART SECOND.--THE BEAUTIFUL.  LECTURE VI.--THE BEAUTIFUL IN THE MIND OF MAN                        123      The method that must govern researches on the beautiful and art     is, as in the investigation of the true, to commence by     psychology.--Faculties of the soul that unite in the perception     of the beautiful.--The senses give only the agreeable; reason     alone gives the idea of the beautiful.--Refutation of     empiricism, that confounds the agreeable and the     beautiful.--Pre-eminence of reason.--Sentiment of the beautiful;     different from sensation and desire.--Distinction between the     sentiment of the beautiful and that of the     sublime.--Imagination.--Influence of sentiment on     imagination.--Influence of imagination on sentiment.--Theory of     taste.  LECTURE VII.--THE BEAUTIFUL IN OBJECTS                               140      Refutation of different theories on the nature of the beautiful:     the beautiful cannot be reduced to what is useful.--Nor to     convenience.--Nor to proportion.--Essential characters of the     beautiful.--Different kinds of beauties. The beautiful and the     sublime. Physical beauty. Intellectual beauty. Moral     beauty.--Ideal beauty: it is especially moral beauty.--God, the     first principle of the beautiful.--Theory of Plato.  LECTURE VIII.--ON ART                                                154      Genius:--its attribute is creative power.--Refutation of the     opinion that art is the imitation of nature--M. Emeric David,     and M. Quatremère de Quincy.--Refutation of the theory of     illusion. That dramatic art has not solely for its end to excite     the passions of terror and pity.--Nor even directly the moral     and religious sentiment.--The proper and direct object of art is     to produce the idea and the sentiment of the beautiful; this     idea and this sentiment purify and elevate the soul by the     affinity between the beautiful and the good, and by the relation     of ideal beauty to its principle, which is God.--True mission of     art.  LECTURE IX.--THE DIFFERENT ARTS                                      165      Expression is the general law of art.--Division of     arts.--Distinction between liberal arts and trades.--Eloquence     itself, philosophy, and history do not make a part of the fine     arts.--That the arts gain nothing by encroaching upon each     other, and usurping each other's means and     processes.--Classification of the arts:--its true principle is     expression.--Comparison of arts with each other.--Poetry the     first of arts.  LECTURE X.--FRENCH ART IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY                    178      Expression not only serves to appreciate the different arts, but     the different schools of art. Example:--French art in the     seventeenth century. French poetry:--Corneille. Racine. Molière.     La Fontaine. Boileau.--P"]]]
