The parent or instructer, moreover, is then justly entitled to, and has gratefully given to him, the entire confidence of the adolescent; and he is thereby enabled exactly to appreciate the degree of power of the propensity which he desires to divert or to guide.  Such being the case, it is the business of the parent to present a true picture of the effects of too early association of this kind, on the stature, the various development of the figure, the muscular power, the quality of the voice, the health, the moral sense, and especially on the acuteness, the power, the dignity, and the courage, of the mind.  In doing this, it would be as stupid as injurious to employ the slightest degree of false representation, of unjust reprimand, or too much of what is called moralizing, which is often only the contemptible cant of a being who cannot reason, especially when it takes the place of a simple and powerful statement of facts. All of these would only render the young man a dissembler, and would compel him to choose another confidant.  Among other considerations, varying according to the circumstances of the case, those stated below may with advantage be presented.  At a certain period in the life both of plants and animals, varying according to their kind and the climate they live in, they are fit for and disposed to the reproduction of their species. The sexes in both are then attracted to each other. In plants, the powder termed pollen, in animals a peculiar liquid which, deriving its name by analogy from the seeds of plants, is termed seminal, is secreted by the male plant or animal, and, by organs differently formed in each kind, is cast upon ova or eggs either contained within, or deposited by, the female. The details of this process are among the most beautiful and interesting of the living economy. In mankind, the attainment of this period is termed puberty.  It is with this critical period, and his conduct during it, that all that the youth deems most valuable, all that can decide his fortunes and his happiness in the world, his stature, figure, strength, voice, health, and mental powers, are most intimately connected.  In regard to stature, the body appears to complete its increase in height chiefly at the age of puberty, and during the first years which succeed that age. To be assured of the powerful influence of his own conduct, at this period, upon his stature, the youth has only to compare the tall men and women of the country as in Yorkshire, Lancashire, Westmoreland, Cumberland, and the Scottish borders, where they have not been overworked, with the stunted and dwarfed creatures of the metropolis, where a stranger, when he first enters it, is apt to think he sees so many ugly boys and girls, whereas, they are full-grown London men and women. Half the population of the metropolis is affected in this way; and it is the obvious consequence of the acceleration of puberty by confinement, stimulating food, indecent plays, and sexual association.  In regard to the perfect development and beauty of the figure, the youth is probably aware that the most beautiful races of horses and dogs rapidly deteriorate, if men do not carefully maintain them by continence as well as by crossing. The too early employment, the depraved abuses, the injury, or the removal, of the sexual organs, are all of them causes still more certain of deformity. The latter of these causes acts, of course, most obviously; and it is evidenced in the almost universal malformation of eunuchs, geldings, &c.  That, in regard to bodily strength, sexual continence adds energy to the muscular fibre, is clearly seen by observing the most ardent quadrupeds previous to the time of the union of their sexes. But, this being past, precisely in the same proportion does the act of reproduction debilitate and break down the strongest animal. Many male animals even fall almost exhausted by a single act of union with the opposite sex.  Every classical student has read the beautiful allegory of Hercules, who, having spun at the knees of Omphale ([Greek: omphalos] the navel, here put for the most essential part of the female generative organ), thereby lost his strength: this beautifully expresses the abasement of power amid the indulgences of love. Euripides also depicts the terrible Achilles as timid before women, and respectful with Clytemnestra and Iphigenia. Hence, when a foolish lord reproached the poet Dryden with having given too much timidity toward women to a personage in one of his tragedies, and added that he knew better how to employ his time with the ladies, the poet answered: \"You now acknowledge that you are no hero, which I intended that personage to be.\"  As to voice, which depends on the muscles of respiration, and more immediately on those of the mouth and throat, as general strength does on the muscles of the whole body, both merely affording expressions of the mind, the influence of the sexual union upon it is prodigious. How entirely it is altered by the removal of the testes in eunuchs is known to every one: in corresponding proportion, is it altered by every act of the generative organs, but especially by sexual indulgence during puberty. The horrible voice of early libertines and prostitutes presents an alarming example of this. To those who value voice in conversation, in the delightful and humanizing exercise of music, or in the grander efforts of public speaking, nothing more need be said.  As to health, the less we are prodigal of life, the longer we preserve it. Every one capable of observing may see that the stag loses his horns and his hair after procreation; that birds fall into moulting and sadness; and that male insects even perish after this effort, as if they yielded their individual life to their progeny. Indeed, everything perishes so much the more readily, as it has thus transmitted life to its descendants, or has cast it away in vain pleasures.  In mankind, as in other animals, to procreate is in effect to die to one's self, and to leave one's life to posterity; especially, if this takes place in early life. It is then that man becomes bald and bent; and that the charms of woman fade. Even in advanced age, epicures are so well aware of this, that they are known to abstain from amorous excess, as the acknowledged cause of premature death.  In relation to mind--as the generative power is the source of several characteristics of genius, the exhaustion of that power at an early age must take away these characteristics. Genius as surely languishes and is extinguished amid early sexual indulgence, as do the faculties of voice and locomotion, which are merely its signs and expressions.  It is thus with all our faculties, locomotive, vital, mental, at an early age. They are strengthened by all that they do not dissipate; and that which their organs too abundantly dispense is not only taken immediately from their own power, and mediately from that of the other organs, but it ensures the permanent debility of the whole.  It is true that the strong passions which are modified or characterized by the sexual impulse, excite the imagination and impel the mind to sublime exertions; but the sole means of either obtaining or preserving such impulsion is, to shun the indulgence of pleasure in early life, and its waste at later periods.  It has accordingly been observed, that the passion of love appears to be most excessive in animals which least excel in mental faculties. Thus the beasts which are the most lascivious, the ass, the boar, &c., are also the most stupid; and idiots and cretins display a sensuality which brutifies them still more. Hence, the Homeric fable that Circe transformed men into beasts.  It would also appear that the most stupid animals, swine, rabbits, &c., in general produce the greatest number of young; while men of genius have engendered the fewest. It is remarked that none of the greatest men of antiquity were much given to sexual pleasure.  It is, then, of the greatest importance to young men who are ambitious of excellence, to mark well this truth, that the most powerful and distinguished in mental faculties, other things being equal, will be he who wastes them least in early life by sexual indulgence--who most economizes the vital stimulant, in order to excite the mental powers on great occasions. By such means may a man surely surpass others, if he have received from his parents proportional mental energy.  Beside the means already indicated, there is one proposed by an able writer, as serving to divert the instinct of propagation when too early and excessive, and consequently dangerous: that is, the sentiment of love. To employ this means, he observes, \"it is necessary to search early, after knowing the character of the adolescent whom it is wished to direct, for a young woman whose beauty and good qualities may inspire him with attachment. This means will serve, more than can easily be imagined, to preserve the adolescent both from the grosser attractions of libertinism and the disease it entails, and from _the more dangerous snares of coquetry_. It is,\" he adds, \"a virtuous young woman and a solid attachment that are here spoken of.\"--At some future period I shall probably show how wise this recommendation is, as well as the necessity and the advantages of early marriages, under favorable circumstances.  Having now shown the evils of early sexual association, I may briefly notice those of later libertinism.  If, even in more advanced life, and when the constitution is stronger, the instinct of propagation be not restrained within just limits, it degenerates into inordinate lewdness or real mania: \"Repperit obscænas veneres vitiosa libido.\" By such"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35413"],["title","A Review of the Middle American Tree Frogs of the Genus Ptychohyla (#0)"],["body","Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net                            UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS PUBLICATIONS                       MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY            Volume 15, No. 7, pp. 297-349, pls. 11-18, 7 figs.

During the last half of the nineteenth century most of the species of hylids living in the lowlands of southern México and northern Central America were named and described. Despite the extensive collecting by Salvin and Godman, Nelson and Goldman, and the various expeditions of the _Mission Scientifique_, no members of the genus _Ptychohyla_ were obtained until 1927, when in the mountains of El Salvador Ruben A. Stirton found a small tree frog that subsequently was described and named _Hyla euthysanota_ by Kellogg (1928). Until recently frogs of this genus were known from few specimens and in the literature by nearly as many names.  Although I first collected _Ptychohyla_ in 1956, it was not until 1960 that special efforts were made to obtain specimens of this genus. The summer of 1960 was spent in southern México and Guatemala, where every accessible stream in the cloud forests was searched for tree frogs, especially _Ptychohyla_ and _Plectrohyla_. Similar, but less extensive, investigations were carried out in 1961 and 1962. The result of this field work is a rather large collection of _Ptychohyla_ representing all of the known species, plus tape recordings of the breeding calls and tadpoles of all of the species.  Previously, I have discussed the nomenclature of one of the species (Duellman, 1960) and have described two new species (Duellman, 1961). In the latter paper I made reference to a future account (this one) that would deal with the systematics and biology of the entire genus. Although I have series of specimens, tadpoles, osteological preparations, and recordings of breeding calls, thereby having a wide array of data at my disposal, much still remains to be learned about these frogs, especially about various aspects of their life histories. Even the validity of the genus is open to question; this problem is discussed at length in the section beyond entitled \"_Ptychohyla_ as a Natural Assemblage.\"   Acknowledgments  I am indebted to the following persons for permitting me to examine specimens in their care: Miguel Alvarez del Toro, Museo Zoología de Tuxtla Gutierrez, México (MZTG); Charles M. Bogert and Richard G. Zweifel, American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); Doris M. Cochran, United States National Museum (USNM); Norman Hartweg and Charles F. Walker, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (UMMZ); Robert F. Inger, Chicago Natural History Museum (CNHM); Hobart M. Smith, University of Illinois Museum of Natural History (UIMNH); Heinz Wermuth, Zoologisches Museum Berlin (ZMB); and Ernest E. Williams, Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ). The abbreviations following names of institutions will be used throughout the text; the Museum of Natural History at the University of Kansas is abbreviated KU.  Throughout my work on these frogs I have profited from discussions with L. C. Stuart, who has made many valuable suggestions and with his characteristic generosity has placed at my disposal his extensive collections of tadpoles from Guatemala. For his aid I am indeed grateful. I am grateful to Thomas E. Moore for tapes of breeding calls of two species.  My own field work was made more enjoyable and profitable through the assistance of Dale L. Hoyt, Craig E. Nelson, Jerome B. Tulecke, and John Wellman, all of whom spent many hours in often unsuccessful attempts to collect specimens and record breeding calls of _Ptychohyla_. I am indebted to many residents of México, Guatemala, and El Salvador for permission to work on their land and for providing shelter, food, and guides. I am especially grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Horatio Kelly of \"Colegio Linda Vista\" at Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacán, Chiapas, for a pleasant stay at their school; Jordi Juliá Z. of the Comisión del Papaloapan, Ciudad Alemán, Veracruz, for arranging for field work in northern Oaxaca in 1959; Walter Hannstein and Lothar Menzel for the use of facilities at Finca La Paz, Guatemala, in 1960; Alan Hempstead for the use of facilities at Finca Los Alpes, Guatemala in 1960 and 1961; and Julio Aguirre C. of the Instituto Tropical de Investigaciones Científicas, San Salvador, El Salvador, for providing comfortable working quarters and transportation and guides to the mountains in northern El Salvador. Without the cheerful efforts of Jorge A. Ibarra, Director of the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural in Guatemala, my field work would have been greatly restricted during politically precarious times in that country. Permits to collect in México were furnished by the late Luis Macías Arellano of the Dirección General de Caza. Each of these individuals has my profound thanks for his indispensable aid.  Field work on hylid frogs in Middle America has been supported by the National Science Foundation, Grant NSF-G9827, and this is the 9th publication on the results of study of the material from America.   Materials and Methods  During the course of this study I have examined 247 frogs that I assign to the genus _Ptychohyla_, plus 40 lots of tadpoles and 12 skeletal preparations. Furthermore, I have examined all of the type specimens. I have studied each of the species and subspecies in the field and have examined from seven (_P. euthysanota macrotympanum_) to 33 (_P. spinipollex_) living individuals of each species.  Measurements given in the analysis of data and in the descriptions of the species are those described by Duellman (1956). In the descriptions of living colors the capitalized names are from Ridgway (1912). All interpretations of osteological characters are based on specimens cleared in potassium hydroxide and stained with alizarin red.  Recordings of the breeding calls were made with a Magnemite Portable Tape-recorder; audiospectrographs were made on a vibralyzer (Kay Electric Company) using normal"]]]
