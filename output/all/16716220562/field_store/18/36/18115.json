I wing'd a marquis yesterday--poor Rosa! where is she now?  _Henry._ I have lodged her in the convent of Villeneuve.  _Lack._ And have taken the races of Fontainbleau in your way back to Paris?  _Henry._ I'll tell you frankly, though you'll say, rather inconsistent with my present situation; I'm drawn hither purely by the hopes of meeting an amiable young lady, who engaged my conversation at the Sunday opera, in Paris.  _Lack._ Her name?--Good family, eh?  _Henry._ I'm a total stranger to both--talks of her brother's having horses to run, and of their intention of being there at the races.  _Lepoche._ [_Without._] Je n'y manquerai pas.  _Lack._ [_Aside._] This cursed tailor! now I shall be dunned and pestered!       _Enter LAPOCHE._  _Lap._ Monsieur Lackland, I ville no longer vait for my----  _Lack._ [_Apart to him._] Hush! I'll make your fortune--A customer, rolling in money. Captain, if you're unprovided with neat lodgings, and a good tailor, here's your man, and there's his house.  _Lap._ Oh, de new customer! bon--speak de goot vort for me.  _Lack._ He has good apartments.  _Lap._ Oh, very goot--Speake more.  _Lack._ I will. [_To LAPOCHE._] This ill-looking little rascal--                                                              [_To HENRY._  _Lap._ Much obligé to you.  _Lack._ [_Apart to HENRY._] If you are slack in cash, [_Loud._] you'll find his lodgings convenient.  _Lap._ Very convenient, because----  _Lack._ [_Apart._] Because when he asks for his money, you may kick him down stairs.  _Lap._ Much obligé to you, sir.

Must attend where beauty calls--[_Pulls down his Ruffles._] My dear Henry, at your time, I am yours; from a beef steak to a bottle of burgundy--can't stay now--you know I was always a Philander among the ladies.

I was vonce great man in Londres; but now I am anoder man.  _Henry._ Another man! what, then, my motley friend, I suppose you have a character for every country?  _Lap._ Oui, I have appear in many character, but Londres vas my grand theatre--Ah! England is de great field of battle for us soldiers of fortune; and ven I could no longer fight my vay----  _Henry._ Why, then you----  _Lap._ Oui, I ran avay. Ah, monsieur! in England, I vas high, and I vas low--I vas dit, and I vas dat:--I vas cook, parfumeur, maitre de langue, juggle, and toos drawer--in short I vas every ting.  _Henry._ And pray, my good friend, what are you now?  _Lap._ I am now myself, in my true charactere--A tailor, à votre service.  _Henry._ A tailor! what, and come here to the races of Fontainbleau, to sport your Louis d'ors upon the jockeys of France?  _Lap._ Non, monsieur, but I am come here to sport de pretty jacket upon de jockeys of France. Ah!

Ah, monsieur, vy no lodge in my house? So convenient for de single gentilhomme!--[_Aside._] I will not tell him of de lady, my lodger, because I love her myself.  _Henry._ Well, I don't know but private lodgings, at this time, may be preferable to the noise and bustle of an hotel.  _Lap._ Eh bien, monsieur, vill you look at my lodgment?  _Henry._ With all my heart.  _Lap._ Je vous attend.--[_Calls._] Nannette!--And if you like them, you may send your baggage and little ting after you.--Nannette! prepare for de new lodger.

Madam, it's Sir John Bull, and Lady Bull, and Miss Bull, and all the family.  _Sir John._ [_Without._] I wish, my Lady Bull, you'd let Robin have rolled us up to the door.  _Mrs. Casey._ Ha! upon my honour, it is Sir John Bull and his lady--this is the truth of an English family.       _Enter SIR JOHN and LADY BULL, FRENCH INN-KEEPER, Four FRENCH     PORTERS, with small Bandboxes, &c._  _Mrs. Casey._ Sir John, you are welcome from Paris.  _Sir J. B._ Welcome from Paris! [_Mimicking._]---Where the devil are you taking us? Such a way, to walk over your damned pavement!  _Lady B._ Oh fie, Sir John! Do you consider where you are? When English gentlemen come to France, they should leave their dammes at Dover.  _Sir J. B._ I wish I had left you, or myself there, damme!--what are these fellows doing with the things?  _Lady B._ Don't you see, the gentlemen are porters, Sir John?  _Sir J. B._ Porters! pickpockets--paid by the ounce: One Thames Street porter, would take the whole seven and their bundles on his knot; here's a proof--       _Enter ROBIN, with a very large Trunk._  My trunk, Robin?  _Rob._ Yes, your honour; four of the monsieurs trying to carry it, dropped it in the dirt, yonder.

B._ Well, what have you to say to my honest face?  _Lack._ Say? me!--Damme, if I have any thing to say--but, only--how d'ye do?  _Sir J. B._ Why, pretty well; how are you?--A damned impudent fellow!

[_Aside._] As you're English, I feel an attachment;--harkye--a damned sharping place, this--you may profit by my advice; avoid strangers, particularly our own countrymen;--all upon the sharp--they'll introduce themselves, intrude their conversation, amuse you with some flam of their families, and spending fortunes, and losses; and the story generally ends in borrowing money from you, that is, if you are fool enough to lend it.--Now, my dear sir, 'tis my pleasure to warn a gentleman, like you, of the tricks and deceptions, of these sort of fellows.  _Sir J. B._ I'm very much obliged to you--give me your hand--will you eat a bit of mutton with us?  _Lack._ Sir, I should be proud of the honour, but something awkward--this dishabille!--and as I understand you have ladies, you know, they expect a man--the fellow here over the way, detains a handsome suit of mine, only for--sir, if you could oblige me with a guinea, I should repay you with many thanks.  _Sir J.

As with cold lips I kiss'd the sacred veil,   The shrines all trembled, and the lamps grew pale._  Poor Eloisa in her cloister, spoke my sentiments!--I begin to repent my elopement.--By this time the abbess has heard of my departure from the convent.--Heigho! I wonder if Lord Winlove has got my letter--I wish he was come!   AIR.--ROSA.    _Oh, ling'ring time! why with us stay,       When absent love we mourn?

Safer, as I advised you, waiting for me at Villeneuve, and, by a cross route, got to Paris.  _Rosa._ Nay, don't be angry with me! if I had remained at all in the village, the abbess might have discovered my retreat; for, though in my noviciate, I dare say, she's highly incensed at my escape.  _Lord W._ Your letter says, you got out of the convent in boy's clothes, ha! ha! ha!  _Rosa._ Yes; and I was e'en obliged to change them before I reached Fontainbleau. Oh, my lord! this is a wicked step of me!  _Lord W._ The impiety was mine, my love! to rob Heaven of an angel--But how unlucky! here, my dear, you've got into the house of this Lapoche--the most busy little coxcomb!  _Rosa._ I wish, indeed, I had been any where else!  _Lord W._ Well, we may get from hence to-night: my death, from that rencontre with your brother, is every where believed.  _Rosa._ My dear lord! now only yours--I know no guide but your opinion.  _Lord W._ My sweet Rosa! though I wasn't to be threatened into a marriage, by the young Chamont, your brother, when he overtook us at Rochester; on my return to England, I shall, with pride, acknowledge my sweet Rosa to be Lady Winlove.
