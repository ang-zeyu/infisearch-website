INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.   He was a sage and a seer who remarked concerning Mormonism: \"It presents a problem which the wisest politician has failed to solve, and whose outcome lies in the mystery of the future.\" It is acknowledged to be the Great Modern Abomination, the most pernicious heresy of this century; and yet in ten years from its origin its devotees numbered thousands, and Joseph Smith, its founder, predicted that it was to be the religious faith of the Western Continent. To-day its membership numbers its hundreds of thousands, its organizations extend over a large part of the globe, and the most careless observer of the times must realize that this institution has become one of the gravest and most difficult religious, social, and political puzzles of the day.  Throughout our whole land it is universally despised and execrated; and if popular odium could extinguish it, it would speedily be sunk in the slimy depths of the Great Salt Lake. But thus far it has successfully withstood even the fiercest opposition. That Mormonism is not the weak, empty, insignificant thing which it is so generally assumed to be must be obvious to any one who sets himself seriously to account for its origin, its growth, and its present position and influence. There _must_ be more in the system than is popularly supposed; otherwise the organization could never have grown to be what it is, nor could it now stand up so persistently and even prosperously in the presence of such universal opposition.  Very much of what is said and written concerning Mormonism amounts to but very little because of its obvious failure to understand what it denounces; and it will be well for us at the outset to notice A FEW OF THE MISTAKES CONCERNING MORMONISM that are now current.  1. Most people talk as if _Mormonism and polygamy are synonymous_, whereas polygamy is only a comparatively trifling and non-essential part of Mormonism. For ten years after the Church was founded, it was not heard of; and it was not openly taught for twenty years. If it could be brought to a sudden conclusion either by a new revelation, or stamped out by law, Mormonism, with its preposterous claims, its absorption of things political in things ecclesiastical, its ideas, some of them more than heathenish,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36791"],["title","The Mormon Puzzle, and How to Solve It (#2)"],["body"," its intensely secular spirit, its standard of morality lamentably low--MORMONISM, in its worst phases, and in what it is most damaging to souls and fullest of peril to the Republic, would still stand unscathed.  2. And then, in strict accordance with that false notion, is the idea that _the Mormons are a mere horde of sensualized barbarians_, and should consequently be dealt with in the most severe manner imaginable; whereas, the fact is that the great mass of Mormons do not practise polygamy, and _never have done so_. It is true that, as a people, they are chargeable with the gravest crimes; and yet they have been perpetrated by _the few_, while _the many_ have been, and are, devoted to what _they believe_ to be the true and the right. Contrasts are often drawn (and truthfully drawn, too) by their preachers between \"the unworldly lives of the Saints and the evil practices of the Gentiles,\" and pertinent examples are given of aberration from rectitude of men intrusted with the making of our laws or those who ministers at the altars of divine worship, until they regard themselves as clothed with the resplendent robes of righteousness. Perhaps the worst thing that can be said of the mass of the Mormons is that they are poor, ignorant, and superstitious, and therefore an easy prey to a corrupt and infamous priesthood. But many who are equally poor, ignorant, and superstitious can be found in every State in the Union, and in some States they are far greater in number than in Utah.  3. Then, too, there is another mistaken idea concerning Mormonism. The assertion is often made that _it is an exotic--an importation from the Old World_, and especially that the pollutions of polygamy may justly be charged to the English, Swedes, and Danes. But this is not true. Facts compel a conclusion far less flattering. Smith and his system are essentially a New World product. It took its rise in a region lying between the birthplace of the Rochester Rappings, from which Modern Spiritualism sprang, and the seat of the Oneida Community. It had much in common, too, with the great Campbellite movement, which antedated it only by five or ten years, and from which it received a large number of important accessions. Millerism and Shakerism were also near relatives and neighbors. Yea, more--in Mormonism we have an obnoxious plant which _sprang from Puritan seed_, though it first _took root_ in the Empire State. Joseph Smith, its founder, and Brigham Young, its greatest leader, were both born in Vermont. At least ninety per cent of the converts gathered during the first ten years (1830-40) were of New England descent. In 1860, out of a population in Utah of some 70,000, it is affirmed that 10,000 were born in New York and 20,000 in New England; while in the legislature, of thirty-six members, thirteen were born in New York, six in Massachusetts, and five in Vermont. And in an editorial written less than two years ago, the official Mormon Church paper states that \"of twenty-eight men constituting the general authorities of the Church, twenty-four were born in the United States and eighteen were of New England birth or origin. Of twenty-seven 'Stakes of Zion,' twenty have presidents born under the Stars and Stripes, and a large majority are of New England parentage. The founders were mostly descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers; the leading minds are nearly all of Puritan blood.\" It is, however, some comfort to know that, since polygamy was accepted and proclaimed, recruiting from among the sons of the Pilgrims has almost altogether ceased; and yet it is well for those of us who are so boastful of what Puritan thought and energy have accomplished for America to remember that this greatest abomination of our land is also a product of the thought and energy of the descendants of the Pilgrims--an institution, therefore, ESSENTIALLY AMERICAN.  4. It is also commonly supposed at the present day that _about nine tenths of the Mormons are foreign rather than American_; but the last census gives Utah a foreign-born population of 43,933 and a native-born population of 99,974. Making allowance for the probable preponderance of the native element among the Gentile population, and allowing a large subtraction from the latter figure on account of the thousands of children born of foreign parentage in Utah, it would still be probable that the native is, at least, equal to the foreign fraction in the general aggregate. And this will be the more readily admitted when it is remembered that, while public attention has been more attracted toward the recent importations of converts from Europe, the earlier Mormons in Utah were almost exclusively American. So far as personal prominence goes, if not in numbers, _the native element has always been, and is now, entirely predominant_.  Since, then, there are so many common mistakes with reference to Mormonism, let us endeavor to look at the system fully in a fair and impartial manner, considering _its marvellous history_, in the first place; and, then, _its threefold character_ as a religious, social, and political system, with which we have to deal not only as patriots, but also as Christians.     PART I.  HISTORY OF MORMONISM.   \"Examine history, for it is 'Philosophy teaching by experience.'\" --CARLYLE.    \"'Tis strange, but true; for truth is always strange,   Stranger than fiction.\" BYRON.     CHAPTER I.      Alleged origin of Mormonism--Joseph Smith's early life--Finding the     peek-stone--Visited by an angel--Received the golden plates--Was Smith     a swindler or an enthusiast?--\"Book of Mormon\" published, and Mormon     Church established--Smith's first alleged miracle--Rigdon joins the     Mormons--Mormonism compared to Mohammedanism.   It is acknowledged by all who have given careful thought to the subject, that Mormonism presents us with a very extraordinary civilization and the most peculiar religion under the sun; but _its history_ is as unique and peculiar as the system itself, and is well worthy the attention of the philosopher as well as the student of human nature and human history.  Its alleged origin was miraculous, and calculated to inspire its followers with wonder, admiration, and awe. As Moses, the founder of Judaism, received the two tables of the moral law, which constituted the brief Bible of the Israelites, from the hand of God Himself, while the lightning blazed around his head and the earth quaked beneath his feet, so Joseph Smith (it is alleged) received his Golden Bible from the hand of an angel on the Hill Cummorah near Palmyra, N. Y., amid thunder and lightning. He is represented in an old picture as kneeling on the steep incline of that hill, the wind blowing his long hair out in all directions, and his eyes big with surprise. Above him in a cloud is the placid angel, gazing intently upon the future prophet, who is eagerly taking his credentials from a cemented stone chest which had been buried some 1400 years, while out of the overshadowing cloud have come forth zigzags of lightning which are playing around both Joseph and the angel.  The name of the angel was Moroni, and he informed Smith that the fate of the early inhabitants of America was written on golden tablets within that chest, and that these could be read only by the aid of some wonderful stone spectacles called \"Urim and Thummim,\" which were also in the chest. Smith said that on opening the precious box he found six golden tablets eighteen inches square held together by rings at the back, and also the stone spectacles to decipher the tablets; and besides these, the sword of Laban and a \"breastplate\" which had been brought from Jerusalem by the early inhabitants of our land were inclosed in the chest.  The hill on which these sacred things were found is at present known as Gold Bible Hill, and the true Mormon venerates it as a sacred spot, and travels from afar to see its quiet but not remarkable beauty. It is a conical elevation several hundred feet in height, and in its isolation and peculiar form bears a certain resemblance to an extinct volcano. It is smooth and green to the very top, from which there is a picturesque view of hills and dales in all directions. It is situated in Wayne County, N. Y., four miles from the village of Palmyra and three miles from the home of the false prophet who has given it its present fame.  Like all other prophets, whether true or false, Joseph Smith was of very humble origin. His father was a cooper by trade, and he dug wells and worked on the neighboring farms when he could. His mother washed by the day, but it is said that her employers were careful to have the clothes in before dark, as experience had taught them they would disappear if left on the lines over night. The whole family made baskets and maple sugar, and raised and sold garden vegetables.  The youthful Joseph assisted generally, and (it is alleged) was an adept in robbing hen-roosts and orchards. It seems that when quite young he could read, but not write. His two standard volumes were \"The Life of Stephen Burroughs,\" the clerical scoundrel, and the autobiography of Captain Kidd, the pirate. The latter work was eagerly and often perused. At an early age he committed the following lines to memory, which seemed to give him great pleasure:    \"My name was Robert Kidd,     As I sailed, as I sailed;   And most wickedly I did,   And God's laws I did forbid,     As I sailed, as I sailed.\"  A certain superstitious feeling concerning the Smith family existed in the minds of their more ignorant neighbors on account of the reputation which Mrs. Smith had for telling fortunes. She seems to have been a woman full of odd conceits and superstitions, while at the same time she possessed a great deal of natural talent; and Joseph resembled his mother in mental quickness and imaginative power.  When he was scarcely fifteen years old, while he was watching the digging of a well, he said that he found a peculiarly shaped stone that"]]]
