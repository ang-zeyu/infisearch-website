Some mother’s heart must be bursting for her!—Hush thee! hush thee, little one; we will take thee home and clothe thee, and then thou shalt go to thy mother,” she added, in better English than she had spoken four years earlier in Alton Wood. But the child still cried for her da-da, and the Princess asked again, “What is thy father’s name, little maid?”  “Père,” she answered, with a peculiar accent that made the Prince say, “That is a Provençal tongue.”  “They are Provençal eyes likewise,” added Eleanor.  “See how like their hue is to Richard’s own;” and in Provençal she repeated the question what the father’s name and the child’s own might be.  But “Père” again, and “Bessee, pretty Bessee,” was all the answer she obtained, the last in unmistakable English.  “I thought,” said Eleanor, “that it was only my own children that scarce knew whether they spoke English, Languédoc, or Languéd’ouì.”  “It was the same with us, Lady,” said Richard.  “Father Adam was wont to say we were a little Babel.”  The child looked towards him on hearing his voice, and held out her hands to go to him, reiterating an entreaty to be taken to her father.  “She is probably the child of some minstrel or troubadour,” said the Prince.  “We will send in search of him as soon as we have reached the Savoy.”  The Savoy Palace had been built for Queen Eleanor’s obnoxious uncle, Prince Thomas of Savoy, and had recently been purchased by the Queen herself, as a wedding gift for her son Edmund; but in the meantime Edward and his family were occupying it during their stay near Westminster, and their barge was brought up to the wide stairs of its noble court. Richard was obliged to give up the child to the Princess and her ladies, though she shrieked after him so pertinaciously, that Eleanor called to him to return so soon as he should have changed his garments.  In a few minutes he again appeared, and found the little girl dressed in a little garment of one of the royal children, but totally insensible to the honour, turning away from all the dainties offered to her, and sobbing for her father, much to the indignation of the two little princes, Henry and John, who stood hand in hand staring at her.  She flew to him directly, with a broken entreaty that she might be taken to her father.  Again they tried questioning her, but Richard, whether speaking English or Provençal, always succeeded in obtaining readier and more comprehensible replies than did the Princess.  Whether she recognized him as her preserver, or whether his language had a familiar tone, she seemed exclusively attracted by him; and he it was who learnt that she lived at home—far off—on the Green near the red monks, and that her father could not see—he would be lost without Bessee to lead him.  And the little creature, hardly three years old if so much, was evidently in the greatest trouble at her father having lost her guidance and protection.  Richard, touched and flattered by the little maiden’s exclusive preference, and owning in her Provençal eyes and speech something strangely like his own young sister Eleanor, entreated permission to be himself the person to take her in search of her friends.  The Princess added her persuasions, declaring it would be cruel to send the poor little thing with another stranger, and that his Provençal tongue was needed in order to discovering her father among the troubadours.  Edward yielded to her persuasion, adding, however, that Richard must take two men-at-arms with him, and gravely bidding him be on his guard.  Nor would he permit him to be accompanied by little John de Mohun, who, half page, half hostage, had lately been added to the Princess’s train, and being often bullied and teased by Hamlyn and his fellows, had vehemently attached himself to Richard, and now entreated in vain to go with him on the adventure.  In fact, Prince Edward was a stern disciplinarian, equally severe against either familiarity or insolence towards the external world, and especially towards any one connected with London.  If Richard ever gave him any offence, it was by a certain freedom of manner towards inferiors, such as the Earl of Leicester had diligently inculcated on his family, but which more than once had excited a shade of vexation on the Prince’s part.  Even after Richard had reached the door, he was called back and commanded on no pretext to loiter or enter on any dispute, and if his search should detain him late, to sleep at the Tower, rather than be questioned and stopped at any of the gates which were guarded at night by the citizens.     CHAPTER V THE OLD KNIGHT OF THE HOSPITAL       “The warriors of the sacred grave,           Who looked to Christ for laws.”                                                            _Lord Houghton_.  RICHARD summoned a small boat, and with two stout men-at-arms, of whom Adam de Gourdon was one, prepared again to cross the river.  Leonillo ran down the stone stairs with a wistful look of entreaty and it occurred to both Richard and Adam, that, could the child only lead them to the place where her father had sat, the dog’s scent might prove their most efficient guide.  Little Bessee seemed quite comforted when on her way back to her father, and sat on Richard’s knee, eating the comfits with which the Princess had provided her, and making him cut a figure that seemed somewhat to amaze the other boat-loads whom they encountered on the river.  When they landed, the throng was more dispersed, but revelry and sports of all kinds were going on fast and furiously; each door of the Abbey was besieged by hungry crowds receiving their dole, and Richard’s inquiries for a blind man who had lost his child were little heeded, or met with no satisfactory answer.  Bessee herself was bewildered, and incapable of finding her father’s late station; and Richard was becoming perplexed, and doubtful whether he ought to take her back, as well as somewhat put out of countenance by the laughter of Thomas de Clare, and other young nobles, who rallied him on his strange charge.  At last the little girl’s face lightened as at sight of something familiar.  “Good red monks,” she said.  “They give Bessee soup—make father well.”  With a ray of hope, Richard advanced to a party of Brethren of St. John, who were mounting at the Abbey gate to return to their house at Spitalfields, and doffing his bonnet, intimated a desire to address the tall old war-worn knight with a benevolent face, who was adjusting his scarlet cloak, before mounting a gray Arab steed looking as old and worthy as himself.  “Ha! a young Crusader, I perceive,” was the greeting of the old knight, as his eye fell on the white cross on Richard’s mantle.  “Welcome, brother!  Dost thou need counsel on thy goodly Eastern way?”  “Thanks, reverend Sir,” returned Richard, “but my present purpose was to seek for the father of this little one, who fell into the river in the press.  She pointed to you, saying she had received your bounty.”  “It is Blind Hal’s child, Sir Robert!” exclaimed a serving-brother in black, coming eagerly forward; “the villeins on the green told me the poor knave was distraught at having lost his child in the throng!”  “What brought he her there for?” exclaimed Sir Robert.  “Poor fool! his wits must have forsaken him!”  “The child had a craving to see the show,” replied the Brother, “so Hob the cobbler told me; and all went well till my Lord of Pembroke’s retainers forced all right and left to make way in the crowd.  Hal was thrown down, and the child thrust away till they feared she had fallen over the bank.  Hob and his wife were fain to get the poor man away, for his moans and fierce words were awful: and he was not a little hurt in the scuffle, so I e’en gave them leave to lay him in the cart that brought up your reverence’s vestments, and the gear we lent the Abbey for the show.”  “Right, Brother Hilary,” said Sir Robert; “and now the poor knave will have his best healing.—He must have been a good soldier once,” he added to Richard; “but he is a mere fragment of a man, wasted in your Earl of Leicester’s wars.”  “Where dwells he?” asked Richard, keenly interested in all his father’s old followers; “I would fain restore him his child.”  “In a hut on Bednall Green,” answered the serving-brother; “but twice or thrice a week he comes to the Spital to have his hurts looked to.”  “Ay! we tell him his little witch must soon be shut out!  She turns the heads of all our brethren,” said Sir Robert, smiling.  “Wild work she makes with our novices.”  “Wilder with our Knights Commanders, maybe, Sir,” retorted, laughing, a fair open-faced youth in his novitiate.  “I shall some day warn Hal how our brethren, the Templars, are said to play at ball with tender babes on their lances.”  “No scandal about our brethren of the Temple, Rayland,” said Sir Robert, looking grave for a moment.—“Young Sir, it would be a favour if you would ride with us; we would gladly show you the way to Bednall Green.”  “I should rejoice to go, Sir,” returned Richard, “but I am of Prince Edward’s household—Richard Fowen; and my horse is on the other side of the river.”  “That is soon remedied,” said Sir Robert, who seemed to have taken a great fancy to Richard, either for the sake of his crossed shoulder, or of his kindness to the little plaything of the Spital.  “Our young brother, Engelbert von Fuchstein, has leave to tarry this night with his brother in the train of the King of the Romans, and his horse is at your service, if you will do our poor Spital the favour to tarry there this night, and ride it back in the morn to meet him at Westminster.”  Richard knew that this invitation might be safely accepted without danger of giving umbrage to the Prince, who was on the best terms with the Knights of the Hospital.

HIS DISCOVERY OF THE NORTH POLE IS ENDORSED BY THE EXPLORERS OF ALL THE WORLD.  In placing Dr. Cook on the Chautauqua platform as a lecturer, we have been compelled to study the statements issued for and against the rival polar claims with special reference to the facts bearing upon the present status of the Polar Controversy.  Though the question has been argued during four years, we find that it is almost the unanimous opinion of arctic explorers today, that Dr. Cook reached the North Pole on April 21, 1909.  With officer Peary's first announcement he chose to force a press campaign to deny Dr. Cook's success and to proclaim himself as the sole Polar Victor. Peary aimed to be retired as a Rear-Admiral on a pension of $6,000 per year. This ambition was granted; but the American Congress rejected his claim for priority by eliminating from the pension bill the words \"Discovery of the Pole.\" The European geographical societies, forced under diplomatic pressure to honor Peary, have also refused him the title of \"Discoverer.\" By a final verdict of the American government and of the highest European authorities, Peary is therefore denied the assumption of being the discoverer of the Pole, though his claim as a re-discoverer is allowed. The evasive inscriptions on the Peary medals prove this statement.  Following the acute excitement of the first announcement, it seemed to be desirable to bring the question to a focus by submitting to some authoritative body for decision. Such an institution, however, did not exist. Previously, explorers had been rated by the slow process of historic digestion and assimilation of the facts offered, but it was thought that an academic examination would meet the demands. Officer Peary first submitted his case to a commission appointed by the National Geographical Society of Washington, D. C. This jury promptly said that in their \"opinion\" Peary reached the Pole on April 6, 1909; but a year later in congress the same men unwillingly admitted that in the Peary proofs there was no positive proof.  Dr. Cook's data was sent to a commission appointed by the University of Copenhagen. The Danes reported that the material presented was incomplete and did not constitute positive proof. This verdict, however, did not carry the interpretation that the Pole had not been reached. The Danes have never said, as they have been quoted by the press, that Dr. Cook did not reach the Pole; quite to the contrary, the University of Copenhagen conferred the degree of Ph. D. and the Royal Danish Geographical Society gave a gold medal, both in recognition of the merits of the Polar effort.  This early examination was based mostly upon the nautical calculations for position, and both verdicts when analyzed gave the version that in such observations there was no positive proof. The Washington jury ventured an opinion. The Danes refused to give an opinion, but showed their belief in Dr. Cook's success by conferring honorary degrees.  It is the unfair interpretation of the respective verdicts by the newspapers which has precipitated the turbulent air of distrust which previously rested over the entire Polar achievement. All this, however, has now been cleared by the final word of fifty of the foremost Polar explorers and scientific experts.  In so far as they were able to judge from all the data presented in the final books of both claimants the following experts have given it as their opinion that Dr. Cook reached the Pole, and that officer Peary's similar report coming later is supplementary proof of the first victory:  General A. W. Greely, U. S. A., commander of the Lady Franklin Bay Expedition, who spent four years in the region under discussion.  Rear Admiral W. S. Schley, U. S. N., commander of the Greely Relief Expedition.  Capt. Otto Sverdrup, discoverer of the land over which Dr. Cook's route was forced.  Capt. J. E. Bernier, commanding the Canadian Arctic Expeditions.  Prof. G. Frederick Wright, author of the \"Ice Age of North America.\"  Capt. E. B. Baldwin, commanding the Baldwin-Ziegler Expedition.  Prof. W. H. Brewer for 16 years president of the Arctic Club of America.  Prof. Julius Payer of the Weyprecht-Payer Expedition.  Prof. L. L. Dyche, member of various Peary and Cook Expeditions.  Mr. Maurice Connell, Greely Expedition, and U. S. Weather Bureau.  Capt. O. C. Hamlet, U. S. A. Arctic Revenue Service.  Capt. E. A. Haven, Baldwin-Ziegler Expedition.  Mr. Andrew J. Stone, Explorer of North Coast of America.  Mr. Dillon Wallace, Labrador Explorer.  Mr. Edwin Swift Balch, author of \"The North Pole and Bradley Land.\"  Captains Johan Menander, B. S. Osbon and Thomas F. Hall.  Messrs. Henry Biederbeck, Frederick B. Wright, F. F. Taylor, Ralph H. Cairns, Theodore Lerner, M. Van Ryssellberghe, J. Knowles Hare, Chas. E. Rilliet, Homer Rogers, R. C. Bates, E. C. Rost, L. C. Bement, Clarence Wychoff, Alfred Church, Archibald Dickinson, Robert Stein, J. S. Warmbath, Geo. B. Butland, Ralph Shainwald, Henry Johnson, S. J. Entrikin, Clark Brown, W. F. Armbruster, John R. Bradley, Harry Whitney and Rudolph Franke.  Drs. T. F. Dedrick, Middleton Smith, J. G. Knowlton, H. J. Egbert, W. H. Axtell, A. H. Cordier and Henry Schwartz.  Judge Jules Leclercq, and Prof. Georges Lecointe, Secretary of the International Bureau of Polar Research.  Thus endorsed by practically all Polar Explorers, Dr. Cook's attainment of the Pole and his earlier work of discovery and exploration is farther established by the following honorary pledges of recognition. (These are now in the possession of Dr. Cook, the press reports to the contrary being untrue).  By the King of Belgium, decorated as Knight of the Order of Leopold.  By the University of Copenhagen in conferring the degree of Ph. D.  By the Royal Danish Geographical Society, presentation of a gold medal.  By the Arctic Club of America, presentation of a gold medal.  By the Royal Geographical Society of Belgium, presentation of a gold medal.  By the Municipality of the City of Brussels, presentation of a gold medal.  By the Municipality of the City of New York, with the ceremony of presenting the keys and offering the freedom of the city.  Without denying officer Peary's success, we note that his case rests upon the opinion of three of his official associates in Washington. Three men acting for a society financially interested--three men who have never seen a piece of Polar ice--have given it as their \"opinion\" that Mr. Peary (a year later than Dr. Cook) reached the Pole. By many this was accepted as a final verdict of experts for Peary. But are such men dependable experts?  Dr. Cook now offers in substantiation of his work the support and the final verdict of fifty of the foremost explorers and scientific experts. Each in his own way has during the past four years examined the polar problem and pronounced in favor of Dr. Cook.  He is therefore vindicated of the propaganda of insinuation and distrust which his enemies forced, and his success in reaching the Pole is conceded and endorsed by his own peers.  In his book, \"My Attainment of the Pole,\" Dr. Cook offers with thrilling vividness a most remarkable series of adventures in the enraptured wilderness at the top of the globe. And in his lectures he takes his audience step by step over the haunts of northernmost man and beyond to the sparkling sea of death at the pole. Above all he leaves in the hearts of his listeners the thrills of a fresh vigor and a new inspiration, which opens the way for other worlds to conquer. By his books and by his lectures, Dr. Cook seeks justice at the bar of public opinion, and three million people have applauded his effort on the platform. One hundred thousand people will read his book during the coming year. We are inclined to agree with Capt. E. B. Baldwin and other Arctic explorers who say--\"Putting aside the academic and idle argument of pin-point accuracy, the North Pole has been honestly reached by Dr. Cook, three hundred and fifty days before any one else claimed to have been there.\"    May 22, 1913.
