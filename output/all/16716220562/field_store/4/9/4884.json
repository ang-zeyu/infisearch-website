Then, crossing the room into the corner, that was dusky enough, he faced us, again holding the blessed relic, whereon we stared, in holy fear.  Then he rose, and in his hand was the goodwife's glass vessel, without crack or flaw! {6}  \"Such,\" he said, \"are the properties of this miraculous relic; there is nothing broken but it will mend, ay, a broken limb, as I can prove on my own sinful body,\"--thrusting out his great brown leg, whereon, assuredly, were signs of a fracture; \"ay, a broken leg, or, my dear daughters, a broken heart.\"  At this, of course, they were all eager to touch the blessed relic with their poor rings of base metal, such as they wear who are not rich.  Nay, but first, he said, they must give their mites for a convent of the Clarisses, that was building at Castres, by the care of the holy Colette, whom he might call his patroness, unworthy as he was.  Then he showed us a safe-conduct, signed with that blessed woman's own hand, such as she was wont to give to the religious of the Order of St. Francis.  By virtue of this, he said (and, by miracle, for once he said truly, as I had but too good cause to learn), he could go freely in and out among the camps of French, English, and Burgundians.  You may conceive how joyous they were in that poor cottage, on a night so blessed, and how Brother Thomas told us of the holy Colette, that famous nun and Mother in Christ, as he that had often been in her company.  He had seen her body lifted in the air while she remained in a pious ecstasy, her mind soaring aloft and her fleshly body following it some way.  He had often watched that snow-white beast which followed her, such a creature as is known in no country of the sinful world, but is a thing of Paradise.  And he had tried to caress this wondrous creature of God, but vainly, for none but the holy sister Colette may handle it.  Concerning her miracles of healing, too, he told us, all of which we already knew for very truth, and still know on better warranty than his.  Ye may believe that, late and at last, Brother Thomas had his choice of the warmest place to sleep in--by the \"four,\" as is the wont of pilgrims, for in his humility this holy man would not suffer the farmer's wife and the farmer to give him their bed, as they desired.  I, too, was very kindly entreated by the young lads, but I could scarcely sleep for marvelling at these miracles done by one so unworthy; and great, indeed, I deemed, must be the virtue of that relic which wrought such signs in the hands of an evil man.  But I have since held that he feigned all by art magic and very sorcery, for, as we wended next morning on our road, he plainly told me, truly or falsely, that he had picked up the blackened finger-bone out of the loathly ashes of the dead in the burned castle near Ruffec.  Wherefore I consider that when Brother Thomas sold the grace of his relic, by the touching of rings, he dealt in a devilish black simony, vending to simple Christians no grace but that of his master, Sathanas. Thus he was not only evil (if I guess aright, which I submit to the judgment of my ecclesiastical superiors, and of the Church), but he had even found out a new kind of wickedness, such as I never read of in any books of theology wherein is much to be learned.  I have spoken with some, however, knights and men of this world, who deemed that he did but beguile our eyes by craft and sleight-of-hand.  This other hellish art he had, by direct inspiration, as I hold, of his master Behemoth, that he could throw his voice whither he would, so that, in all seeming, it came from above, or from below, or from a corner of a room, fashioning it to resemble the voice of whom he would, yet none might see his lips move.  With this craft he would affray the peasants about the fire in the little inns where we sometimes rested, when he would be telling tales of bogles and eldritch fantasies, and of fiends that rout and rap, and make the tables and firkins dance.  Such art of speech, I am advised, is spoken of by St. Jerome, in his comment on the holy prophet the saint Isaiah, and they that use it he calls \"ventriloqui,\" in the Latin, or \"belly-speakers,\" and he takes an unfavourable sense of them and their doings.  So much I have from the learned William de Boyis, Prior of Pluscarden, where now I write; with whom I have conversed of these matters privately, and he thinks this art a thing that men may learn by practice, without dealing in nigromancy and the black magic.  This question I am content to leave, as is fitting, to the judgment of my superiors.  And indeed, as at that time, Brother Thomas spake not in his belly except to make sport and affray the simple people, soon turning their fears to mirth.  Certainly the country folk never misdoubted him, the women for a holy man, the men for a good fellow; though all they of his own cloth shrank from him, and I have seen them cross themselves in his presence, but to no avail.  He would say a word or two in their ears, and they straightway left the place where he might be.  None the less, with his tales and arts, Brother Thomas commonly so wrought that we seldom slept \"a la belle etoile\" in that bitter spring weather, but we ordinarily had leave to lie by the hearth, and got a supper and a breakfast.  The good peasants would find their hen- roosts the poorer often, for all that he could snap up was to him fortune of war.  I loved these manners little, but leave him I could not.  His eye was ever on me; if I stirred in the night he was awake and watching me, and by day he never let me out of a bolt's flight.  To cut the string of his wicked weapon was a thought often in my mind, but he was too vigilant.  My face was his passport, he said; my face, indeed, being innocent enough, as was no shame to me, but an endless cause of mirth and mockery to him. Yet, by reason of the serviceableness of the man in that perilous country, and my constant surprise and wonder at what he did and said, and might do next (which no man could guess beforehand), and a kind of foolish pride in his very wickedness, so much beyond what I had ever dreamed of, and for pure fear of him also, I found myself following with him day by day, ever thinking to escape, and never escaping.  I have since deemed that, just as his wickedness was to a boy (for I was little more), a kind of charm, made up of a sort of admiring hate and fear, so my guilelessness (as it seemed to him) also wrought on him strangely.  For in part it made sport for him to see my open mouth and staring eyes at the spectacle of his devilries, and in part he really hated me, and hated my very virtue of simplicity, which it was his desire and delight to surprise and corrupt.  On these strange terms, then, now drawn each to other, and now forced apart, we wended by Poictiers towards Chinon, where the Dauphin and his Court then lay.  So we fared northwards, through Poitou, where we found evil news enough.  For, walking into a village, we saw men, women, and children, all gathered, gaping about one that stood beside a horse nearly foundered, its legs thrust wide, its nostrils all foam and blood.  The man, who seemed as weary as his horse, held a paper in his hands, which the priest of that parish took from him and read aloud to us.  The rider was a royal messenger, one Thomas Scott of Easter Buccleuch, in Rankel Burn, whom I knew later, and his tidings were evil.  The Dauphin bade his good towns know that, on the 12th of February, Sir John Stewart, constable of the Scottish forces in France, had fallen in battle at Rouvray, with very many of his company, and some Frenchmen.  They had beset a convoy under Sir John Fastolf, that was bringing meat to the English leaguered about Orleans.  But Fastolf had wholly routed them (by treachery, as we later learned of the Comte de Clermont), and Sir John Stewart, with his brother Sir William, were slain.  Wherefore the Dauphin bade the good towns send him money and men, or all was lost.  Such were the evil tidings, which put me in sore fear for my brother Robin, one that, in such an onfall, would go far, as beseemed his blood. But as touching his fortunes, Thomas Scott could tell me neither good nor bad, though he knew Robin, and gave him a good name for a stout man-at- arms.  It was of some comfort to me to hear a Scots tongue; but, for the rest, I travelled on with a heavier heart, deeming that Orleans must indeed fall ere I could seek my brother in that town.     CHAPTER III--WHAT BEFELL OUTSIDE OF CHINON TOWN   My old nurse, when I was a child, used to tell me a long story of a prince who, wandering through the world, made friends with many strange companions.  One she called Lynx-eye, that could see through a mountain; one was Swift-foot, that could outrun the wind; one was Fine-ear, that could hear the grass growing; and there was Greedy-gut, that could swallow a river.  All these were very serviceable to this gracious prince, of I know not what country, in his adventures; and they were often brought into my mind by the companions whom we picked up on the grass-grown roads.  These wanderers were as strange as the friends of the prince, and were as variously, but scarce as honourably, gifted.  There was the one-armed soldier, who showed his stump very piteously when it was a question of begging from a burgess, but was as well furnished with limbs as other men when no burgess was in sight.  There was a wretched woman violer, with her jackanapes, and with her husband, a hang-dog ruffian, she bearing the mark of his fist on her eye, and commonly trailing far behind him with her brat on her back.  There was a blind man, with his staff, who might well enough answer to Keen-eye, that is, when no strangers were in sight. There was a layman, wearing cope and stole and selling indulgences, but our captain, Brother Thomas, soon banished him from our company, for that he divided"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1631"],["title","A Monk of Fife (#5)"],["body"," trade.  Others there were, each one of them a Greedy-gut, a crew of broken men, who marched with us on the roads; but we never entered a town or a house with these discreditable attendants.  Now, it may seem strange, but the nearer we drew to Chinon and the Court, the poorer grew the country, for the Court and the men-at-arms had stripped it bare, like a flight of locusts.  For this reason the Dauphin could seldom abide long at one place, for he was so much better known than trusted that the very cordwainer would not let him march off in a new pair of boots without seeing his money, and, as the song said, he even greased his old clouted shoon, and made them last as long as he might.  For head-gear he was as ill provided, seeing that he had pawned the fleurons of his crown.  There were days when his treasurer at Tours (as I myself have heard him say) did not reckon three ducats in his coffers, and the heir of France borrowed money from his very cook.  So the people told us, and I have often marvelled how, despite this poverty, kings and nobles, when I have seen them, go always in cloth of gold, with rich jewels.  But, as you may guess, near the Court of a beggar Dauphin the country-folk too were sour and beggarly.  We had to tighten our belts before we came to the wood wherein cross-roads meet, from north, south, and east, within five miles of the town of Chinon.  There was not a white coin among us; night was falling, and it seemed as if we must lie out under the stars, and be fed, like the wolves we heard howling, on wind.  By the roadside, at the crossways, but not in view of the road, a council of our ragged regiment was held in a deep ditch.  It would be late ere we reached the town, gates would scarce open for us, we could not fee the warders, houses would be shut and dark; the King's archers were apt to bear them unfriendly to wandering men with the devil dancing in their pouches.  Resource we saw none; if there was a cottage, dogs, like wolves for hunger and fierceness, were baying round it.  As for Brother Thomas, an evil bruit had gone before us concerning a cordelier that the fowls and geese were fain to follow, as wilder things, they say, follow the blessed St. Francis.  So there sat Brother Thomas at the cross-roads, footsore, hungry, and sullen, in the midst of us, who dared not speak, he twanging at the string of his arbalest.  He called himself our Moses, in his blasphemous way, and the blind man having girded at him for not leading us into the land of plenty, he had struck the man till he bled, and now stood stanching his wound.  Suddenly Brother Thomas ceased from his twanging, and holding up his hand for silence, leaned his ear to the ground.  The night was still, though a cold wind came very stealthily from the east.  \"Horses!\" he said.  \"It is but the noise of the brook by the way,\" said the blind man, sullenly.  Brother Thomas listened again.  \"No, it is horses,\" he whispered.  \"My men, they that ride horses can spare somewhat out of their abundance to feed the poor.\"  And with that he began winding up his arbalest hastily.  \"Aymeric,\" he said to one of our afflicted company, \"you draw a good bow for a blind man; hide yourself in the opposite ditch, and be ready when I give the word 'Pax vobiscum.'  You, Giles,\" he spoke to the one-armed soldier, \"go with him, and, do you hear, aim low, at the third man's horse.  From the sound there are not more than five or six of them.  We can but fail, at worst, and the wood is thick behind us, where none may pursue.  You, Norman de Pitcullo, have your whinger ready, and fasten this rope tightly to yonder birch-tree stem, and then cross and give it a turn or two about that oak sapling on the other side of the way.  That trap will bring down a horse or twain.  Be quick, you Scotch wine-bag!\"  I had seen many ill things done, and, to my shame, had held my peace.  But a Leslie of Pitcullo does not take purses on the high-road.  Therefore my heart rose in sudden anger, I having all day hated him more and more for his bitter tongue, and I was opening my mouth to cry \"A secours!\"--a warning to them who were approaching, when, quick as lightning, Brother Thomas caught me behind the knee-joints, and I was on the ground with his weight above me.  One cry I had uttered, when his hand was on my mouth.  \"Give him the steel in his guts!\" whispered the blind man.  \"Slit his weasand, the Scotch pig!\" said the one-armed soldier.  They were all on me now.  \"No, I keep him for better sport,\" snarled Brother Thomas.  \"He shall learn the Scots for 'ecorcheurs' (flayers of men) \"when we have filled our pouches.\"  With that he crammed a great napkin in my mouth, so that I could not cry, made it fast with a piece of cord, trussed me with the rope which he had bidden me tie across the path to trip the horses, and with a kick sent me flying to the bottom of the ditch, my face being turned from the road.  I could hear Giles and Aymeric steal across the way, and the rustling of boughs as they settled on the opposite side.  I could hear the trampling hoofs of horses coming slowly and wearily from the east.  At this moment chanced a thing that has ever seemed strange to me: I felt the hand of the violer woman laid lightly and kindly on my hair.  I had ever pitied her, and, as I might, had been kind to her and her bairn; and now, as it appears, she pitied me.  But there could be no help in her, nor did she dare to raise her voice and give an alarm.  So I could but gnaw at my gag, trying to find scope for my tongue to cry, for now it was not only the travellers that I would save, but my own life, and my escape from a death of torment lay on my success.  But my mouth was as dry as a kiln, my tongue was doubled back till I thought that I should have choked.  The night was now deadly still, and the ring of the weary hoofs drew nearer and nearer.  I heard a stumble, and the scramble of a tired horse as he recovered himself; for the rest, all was silent, though the beating of my own heart sounded heavy and husky in my ears.  Closer and closer the travellers drew, and soon it was plain that they rode not carelessly, nor as men who deemed themselves secure, for the tramp of one horse singled itself out in front of the others, and this, doubtless, was ridden by an \"eclaireur,\" sent forward to see that the way ahead was safe.  Now I heard a low growl of a curse from Brother Thomas, and my heart took some comfort.  They might be warned, if the Brother shot at the foremost man; or, at worst, if he was permitted to pass, the man would bear swift tidings to Chinon, and we might be avenged, the travellers and I, for I now felt that they and I were in the same peril.  The single rider drew near, and passed, and there came no cry of \"Pax vobiscum\" from the friar.  But the foremost rider had, perchance, the best horse, and the least wearied, for there was even too great a gap between him and the rest of his company.  And now their voices might be heard, as they talked by the way, yet not so loud that, straining my ears as I did, I could hear any words.  But the sounds waxed louder, with words spoken, ring of hoofs, and rattle of scabbard on stirrup, and so I knew, at least, that they who rode so late were men armed.  Brother Thomas, too, knew it, and cursed again very low.  Nearer, nearer they came, then almost opposite, and now, as I listened to hear the traitorous signal of murder--\"Pax vobiscum\"--and the twang of bow-strings, on the night there rang a voice, a woman's voice, soft but wondrous clear, such as never I knew from any lips but hers who then spoke; that voice I heard in its last word, \"Jesus!\" and still it is sounding in my ears.  That voice said--  \"Nous voila presqu'arrives, grace a mes Freres de Paradis.\"  Instantly, I knew not how, at the sound of that blessed voice, and the courage in it, I felt my fear slip from me, as when we awaken from a dreadful dream, and in its place came happiness and peace.  Scarce otherwise might he feel who dies in fear and wakes in Paradise.  On the forest boughs above me, my face being turned from the road, somewhat passed, or seemed to pass, like a soft golden light, such as in the Scots tongue we call a \"boyn,\" that ofttimes, men say, travels with the blessed saints.  Yet some may deem it but a glancing in my own eyes, from the blood flying to my head; howsoever it be, I had never seen the like before, nor have I seen it since, and, assuredly, the black branches and wild weeds were lit up bare and clear.  The tramp of the horses passed, there was no cry of \"Pax vobiscum,\" no twang of bows, and slowly the ring of hoofs died away on the road to Chinon.  Then came a rustling of the boughs on the further side of the way, and a noise of footsteps stealthily crossing the road, and now I heard a low sound of weeping from the violer woman, that was crouching hard by where I lay.  Her man struck her across the mouth, and she was still.  \"You saw it?  Saints be with us!  You saw them?\" he whispered to Brother Thomas.  \"Fool, had I not seen, would I not have given the word?  Get you gone, all the sort of you, there is a fey man in this company, be he who he will.  Wander your own ways, and if ever one of you dogs speak to me again, in field, or street, or market, or ever mention this night . . . ye shall have my news of it.  Begone!  Off!\"  \"Nay, but, Brother Thomas, saw'st thou what we saw?  What sight saw'st thou?\"  \"What saw I?  Fools, what should I have seen, but an outrider, and he a King's messenger, sent forward to warn the rest by his fall, if he fell, or to raise the country on us, if he passed, and if afterward they passed us not.  They were men wary in war, and travelling on the Dauphin's business.  Verily there was no profit in them.\"  \"And that was all?  We saw other things.\"  \"What I saw was enough for me, or for any good clerk of St. Nicholas, and of questions there has been more than enough.  Begone! scatter to the winds, and be silent.\"  \"And"]]]
