If we make enemies at sight, we make friends at sight too.\"  \"Echish here says that the harper is a Jew.\"  \"What!--a deserter?\"  \"I do not know that; that is the king's lookout. Their company came up a week ago, were reviewed the day I was on guard at the outposts, and they had this post I tell you of assigned to them. So the king is satisfied; and, if he is, I am.\"  \"Jew or Gentile, Jehovah's man or Dagon's man,\" said one of the younger soldiers, with a half-irreverent tone, \"I wish we had him here to sing to us.\"  \"And to keep us awake,\" yawned another.  \"Or to keep us from thinking of to-morrow,\" said a third.  \"Can nobody sing here, or play, or tell an old-time story?\"  There was nobody. The only two soldiers of the post, who affected musical skill, were the two who had gone up to the Carmelites' bivouac; and the little company of Joppa--catching louder notes and louder, as the bard's inspiration carried him farther and farther away--crept as far up the stream as the limits of their station would permit; and lay, without noise, to catch, as they best could, the rich tones of the music as it swept down the valley.  Soothed by the sound, and by the moonlight, and by the summer breeze, they were just in mood to welcome the first interruption which broke the quiet of the night. It was the approach of one of their company, who had been detached to Accho a day or two before; and who came hurrying in to announce the speedy arrival of companions, for whom he bespoke a welcome. Just as they were to leave Accho, he said, that day, on their return to camp, an Ionian trading-vessel had entered port. He and his fellow-soldiers had waited to help her moor, and had been chatting with her seamen. They had told them of the chance of battle to which they were returning; and two or three of the younger Ionians, enchanted at the relief from the sea's imprisonment, had begged them to let them volunteer in company with them. These men had come up into the country with the soldiers, therefore; and he who had broken the silence of the listeners to the distant serenade had hurried on to tell his comrades that such visitors were on their way.  They soon appeared on foot, but hardly burdened by the light packs they bore.  A soldier's welcome soon made the Ionian sailors as much at home with the men of the bivouac, as they had been through the day with the detachment from the sea-board. A few minutes were enough to draw out sheep-skins for them to lie upon, a skin of wine for their thirst, a bunch of raisins and some oat-cakes for their hunger; a few minutes more had told the news which each party asked from the other; and then these sons of the sea and these war-bronzed Philistines were as much at ease with each other as if they had served under the same sky for years.  \"We were listening to music,\" said the old chief, \"when you came up. Some of our young men have gone up, indeed, to the picket yonder, to hear the harper sing, whose voice you catch sometimes, when we are not speaking.\"  \"You find the Muses in the midst of arms, then,\" said one of the young Ionians.  \"Muses?\" said the old Philistine, laughing. \"That sounds like you Greeks. Ah! sir, in our rocks here we have few enough Muses, but those who carry these lances, or teach us how to trade with the islands for tin.\"  \"That's not quite fair,\" cried another. \"The youngsters who are gone sing well; and one of them has a harp I should be glad you should see. He made it himself from a gnarled olive-root.\" And he turned to look for it.  \"You'll not find it in the tent: the boy took it with him. They hoped the Ziklag minstrel might ask them to sing, I suppose.\"  \"A harp of olive-wood,\" said the Ionian, \"seems Muse-born and Pallas-blessed.\"  And, as he spoke, one of the new-comers of the Philistines leaned over, and whispered to the chief: \"He is a bard himself, and we made him promise to sing to us. I brought his harp with me that he might cheer up our bivouac. Pray, do you ask him.\"  The old chief needed no persuasion; and the eyes of the whole force brightened as they found they had a minstrel \"of their own\" now, when the old man pressed the young Ionian courteously to let them hear him: \"I told you, sir, that we had no Muses of our own; but we welcome all the more those who come to us from over seas.\"  Homer smiled; for it was Homer whom he spoke to,--Homer still in the freshness of his unblinded youth. He took the harp which the young Philistine handed to him, thrummed upon its chords, and as he tuned them said: \"I have no harp of olive-wood; we cut this out, it was years ago, from an old oleander in the marshes behind Colophon. What will you hear, gentlemen?\"  \"The poet chooses for himself,\" said the courtly old captain.  \"Let me sing you, then, of _the Olive Harp_\"; and he struck the chords in a gentle, quieting harmony, which attuned itself to his own spirit, pleased as he was to find music and harmony and the olive of peace in the midst of the rough bivouac, where he had come up to look for war. But he was destined to be disappointed. Just as his prelude closed, one of the young soldiers turned upon his elbow, and whispered contemptuously to his neighbor: \"Always _olives_, always _peace_: that's all your music's good for!\"  The boy spoke too loud, and Homer caught the discontented tone and words with an ear quicker than the speaker had given him credit for. He ended the prelude with a sudden crash on the strings, and said shortly, \"And what is better to sing of than the olive?\"  The more courteous Philistines looked sternly on the young soldier; but he had gone too far to be frightened, and he flashed back: \"War is better. My broadsword is better. If I could sing, I would sing to your Ares; we call him Mars!\"  Homer smiled gravely. \"Let it be so,\" said he; and, in a lower tone, to the captain, who was troubled at the breach of courtesy, he added, \"Let the boy see what war and Mars are for.\"  He struck another prelude and began. Then was it that Homer composed his \"Hymn to Mars.\" In wild measure, and impetuous, he swept along through the list of Mars's titles and attributes; then his key changed, and his hearers listened more intently, more solemnly, as in a graver strain, with slower music, and an almost awed dignity of voice, the bard went on.--              \"Helper of mortals, hear!              As thy fires give         The present boldnesses that strive              In youth for honor;     So would I likewise wish to have the power       To keep off from my head thy bitter hour,     And quench the false fire of my soul's low kind,     By the fit ruling of my highest mind I           Control that sting of wealth     That stirs me on still to the horrid scath           Of hideous battle!      \"Do thou, O ever blessed! give me still     Presence of mind to put in act my will,           Whate'er the occasion be;     And so to live, unforced by any fear,     Beneath those laws of peace, that never are     Affected with pollutions popular           Of unjust injury,     As to bear safe the burden of hard fates,     Of foes inflexive, and inhuman hates!\"  The tones died away; the company was hushed for a moment; and the old chief then said gravely to his petulant follower, \"That is what _men_ fight for, boy.\" But the boy did not need the counsel. Homer's manner, his voice, the music itself, the spirit of the song, as much as the words, had overcome him; and the boasting soldier was covering his tears with his hands.  Homer felt at once (the prince of gentlemen he) that the little outbreak, and the rebuke of it, had jarred the ease of their unexpected meeting. How blessed is the presence of mind with which the musician of real genius passes from song to song, \"whate'er the occasion be!\" With the ease of genius he changed the tone of his melody again, and sang his own hymn, \"To Earth, the Mother of all.\"  The triumphant strain is one which harmonizes with every sentiment; and he commanded instantly the rapt attention of the circle. So engrossed was he, that he did not seem to observe, as he sang, an addition to their company of some soldiers from above in the valley, just _as_ he entered on the passage:--               \"Happy, then, are they         Whom thou, O great in reverence!     Are bent to honor. They shall all things find     In all abundance! All their pastures yield     Herds in all plenty. All their roofs are filled                With rich possessions.       High happiness and wealth attend them,       While, with laws well-ordered, they       Cities of happy households sway;     And their sons exult in the pleasure of youth,     And their daughters dance with the flower-decked girls,     Who play among the flowers of summer!     Such are the honors thy full hands divide;     Mother of Gods and starry Heaven's bride!\"[A]  A buzz of pleasure and a smile ran round the circle, in which the new-comers joined. They were the soldiers who had been to hear and join the music at the Carmel-men's post. The tones of Homer's harp had tempted them to return; and they had brought with them the Hebrew minstrel, to whom they had been listening. It was the outlaw David, of Bethlehem Ephrata.  David had listened to Homer more intently than any one; and, as the pleased applause subsided, the eyes of the circle gathered upon him, and the manner of all showed that they expected him, in minstrel-fashion, to take up the same strain.  He accepted the implied invitation, played a short prelude, and taking Homer's suggestion of topic, sang in parallel with it:--      \"I will sing a new song unto thee, O God!     Upon psaltery and harp will I sing praise to thee.     Thou art He that giveth salvation to kings,     That delivereth David, thy servant, from the sword.     Rid me and save me from those who speak vanity,     Whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood,--     That our sons may be as plants in fresh youth;     That our daughters may be as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15869"],["title","A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World Volume 2 (#0)"],["body","-       A VOYAGE TOWARDS THE SOUTH POLE, AND ROUND THE WORLD; PERFORMED IN HIS MAJESTY'S SHIPS THE RESOLUTION AND ADVENTURE, IN THE YEARS 1772, 3, 4, AND 5.

CHAPTER I.  _Passage from Ulietea to the Friendly Isles, with a Description of several Islands that were discovered, and the Incidents which happened in that Track._  1774 June  On the 6th, being the day after leaving Ulietea, at eleven o'clock a.m., we saw land bearing N.W., which, upon a nearer approach, we found to be a low reef island about four leagues in compass, and of a circular form. It is composed of several small patches connected together by breakers, the largest lying on the N.E. part. This is Howe Island, discovered by Captain Wallis, who, I think, sent his boat to examine it; and, if I have not been misinformed, found a channel through, within the reef, near the N.W. part. The inhabitants of Ulietea speak of an uninhabited island about this situation, called by them Mopeha, to which they go at certain seasons for turtle. Perhaps, this may be the same; as we saw no signs of inhabitants upon it. Its latitude is 16° 46' S. longitude 154° 8' W.  From this day to the 16th, we met nothing remarkable, and our course was west southerly; the winds variable from north round by the east to S.W., attended with cloudy, rainy, unsettled weather, and a southerly swell. We generally brought-to, or stood upon a wind during night; and in the day made all the sail we could. About half an hour after sun-rise this morning, land was seen from the top-mast head, bearing N.N.E. We immediately altered the course, and steering for it, found it to be another reef island, composed of five or six woody islets, connected together by sand-banks and breakers inclosing a lake, into which we could see no entrance. We ranged the west and N.W. coasts, from its southern to its northern-extremity, which is about two leagues, and so near the shore, that at one time we could see the rocks under us; yet we found no anchorage, nor saw we any signs of inhabitants. There were plenty of various kinds of birds, and the coast seemed to abound with fish. The situation of this isle is not very distant from that assigned by Mr Dalrymple for La Sagitaria, discovered by Quiros; but, by the description the discoverer has given of it, it cannot be the same. For this reason, I looked upon it as a new discovery, and named it Palmerston Island, in honour of Lord Palmerston, one of the lords of the Admiralty. It is situated in latitude 18° 4' S. longitude 163° 10' W.  At four o'clock in the afternoon, we left this isle, and resumed our course to the W. by S. with a fine steady gale easterly, till noon on the 20th, at which time, being in latitude 18° 50', longitude 168° 52, we thought we saw land to S.S.W. and hauled up for it accordingly. But two hours after, we discovered our mistake, and resumed our course W. by S. Soon after, we saw land from the mast-head in the same direction; and, as we drew nearer, found it to be an island, which, at five o'clock, bore west, distant five leagues. Here we spent the night plying under the topsails; and at day-break next morning, bore away, steering to the northern point, and ranging the west coast at the distance of one mile, till near noon. Then perceiving some people on the shore, and landing seeming to be easy, we brought-to, and hoisted out two boats, with which I put off to the land, accompanied by some of the officers and gentlemen. As we drew near the shore, some of the inhabitants, who were on the rocks, retired to the woods, to meet us, as we supposed; and we afterwards found our conjectures right. We landed with ease in a small creek, and took post on a high rock to prevent a surprise. Here we displayed our colours, and Mr Forster and his party began to collect plants, etc. The coast was so over-run with woods, bushes, plants, stones, etc. that we could not see forty yards round us. I took two men, and with them entered a kind of chasm, which opened a way into the woods. We had not gone far before we heard the natives approaching; upon which I called to Mr Forster to retire to the party, as I did likewise. We had no sooner joined than the islanders appeared at the entrance of a chasm not a stone's throw from us. We began to speak, and make all the friendly signs we could think of, to them, which they answered by menaces; and one of two men, who were advanced before the rest, threw a stone, which struck Mr Sparrman on the arm. Upon this two muskets were fired, without order, which made them all retire under cover of the woods; and we saw them no more.  After waiting for some little time, and till we were satisfied nothing was to be done here, the country being so overrun with bushes, that it was hardly possible to come to parley with them, we embarked and proceeded down along shore, in hopes of meeting with better success in another place. After ranging the coast for"]]]
