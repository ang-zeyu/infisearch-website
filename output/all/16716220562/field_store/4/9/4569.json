This vista of tall, leaning chimneys seems to us one of the most agreeable things in New York, and we wonder whether any artist has ever drawn it. As our colleague Endymion suggested, it would make a fine subject for Walter Jack Duncan. In the eastern end of this strip of fine old masonry resides the seafaring tavern we spoke of above; formerly known as Sweet's, and a great place of resort (we are told) for Brooklynites in the palmy days before the Bridge was opened, when they used to stop there for supper before taking the Fulton Ferry across the perilous tideway.  The Fulton Ferry--dingy and deserted now--is full of fine memories. The old waiting room, with its ornate carved ceiling and fine, massive gas brackets, peoples itself, in one's imagination, with the lively and busy throngs of fifty and sixty years ago. \"My life then (1850-60) was curiously identified with Fulton Ferry, already becoming the greatest in the world for general importance, volume, variety, rapidity, and picturesqueness.\" So said Walt Whitman. It is a curious experience to step aboard one of the boats in the drowsy heat of a summer afternoon and take the short voyage over to the Brooklyn slip, underneath one of the huge piers of the Bridge. A few heavy wagons and heat-oppressed horses are almost the only other passengers. Not far away from the ferry, on the Brooklyn side, are the three charmingly named streets--Cranberry, Orange, and Pineapple--which are also so lastingly associated with Walt Whitman's life. It strikes us as odd, incidentally, that Walt, who loved Brooklyn so much, should have written a phrase so capable of humorous interpretation as the following: \"Human appearances and manners--endless humanity in all its phases--Brooklyn also.\" This you will find in Walt's Prose Works, which is (we suppose) one of the most neglected of American classics.        [Illustration: Drawing of \"Lightning\" statue]  But Fulton Street, Manhattan--in spite of its two greatest triumphs: Evelyn Longman Batchelder's glorious figure of \"Lightning,\" and the strictly legal \"three grains of pepsin\" which have been a comfort to so many stricken invalids--is a mere byway compared to Fulton Street, Brooklyn, whose long bustling channel may be followed right out into the Long Island pampas. At the corner of Fulton and Cranberry streets \"Leaves of Grass\" was set up and printed, Walt Whitman himself setting a good deal of the type. Ninety-eight Cranberry Street, we have always been told, was the address of Andrew and James Rome, the printers. The house at that corner is still numbered 98. The ground floor is occupied by a clothing store, a fruit stand, and a barber shop. The building looks as though it is probably the same one that Walt knew. Opposite it is a sign where the comparatively innocent legend BEN'S PURE LAGER has been deleted.  The pilgrim on Fulton Street will also want to have a look at the office of the Brooklyn _Eagle_, that famous paper which has numbered among its employees two such different journalists as Walt Whitman and Edward Bok. There are many interesting considerations to be drawn from the two volumes of Walt's writings for the _Eagle_, which were collected (under the odd title \"The Gathering of the Forces\") by Cleveland Rodgers and John Black. We have always been struck by the complacent naïveté of Walt's judgments on literature (written, perhaps, when he was in a hurry to go swimming down at the foot of Fulton Street). Such remarks as the following make us ponder a little sadly. Walt wrote:       We are no admirer of such characters as Doctor Johnson. He was      a sour, malicious, egotistical man. He was a sycophant of power      and rank, withal; his biographer narrates that he \"always spoke      with rough contempt of popular liberty.\" His head was educated      to the point of _plus_, but for his heart, might still more      unquestionably stand the sign _minus_. He insulted his equals      ... and tyrannized over his inferiors. He fawned upon his      superiors, and, of course, loved to be fawned upon himself....      Nor were the freaks of this man the mere \"eccentricities of      genius\"; they were probably the faults of a vile, low nature.      His soul was a bad one.  The only possible comment on all this is that it is absurd, and that evidently Walt knew very little about the great Doctor. One of the curious things about Walt--and there is no man living who admires him more than we do--is that he requires to be forgiven more generously than any other great writer. There is no one who has ever done more grotesquely unpardonable things than he--and yet, such is the virtue of his great, saline simplicity, one always pardons them. As a book reviewer, to judge from the specimens rescued from the _Eagle_ files by his latest editors, he was uniquely childish.  Noting the date of Walt's blast on Doctor Johnson (December 7, 1846), it is doubtful whether we can attribute the irresponsibility of his remarks to a desire to go swimming.  The editors of this collection venture the suggestion that the lighter pieces included show Walt as \"not devoid of humour.\" We fear that Walt's waggishness was rather heavily shod. Here is a sample of his light-hearted paragraphing (the italics are his):--       Carelessly knocking a man's eye out with a broken axe, may be      termed a _bad axe-i-dent_.  It was in Leon Bazalgette's \"Walt Whitman\" that we learned of Walt's only really humorous achievement; and even then the humour was unconscious. It seems that during the first days of his life as a journalist in New York, Walt essayed to compromise with Mannahatta by wearing a frock coat, a high hat, and a flower in his lapel. We regret greatly that no photo of Walt in this rig has been preserved, for we would like to have seen the gentle misery of his bearing.         [Illustration]    McSORLEY'S   This afternoon we have been thinking how pleasant it would be to sit at one of those cool tables up at McSorley's and write our copy there. We have always been greatly allured by Dick Steele's habit of writing his Tatler at his favourite tavern. You remember his announcement, dated April 12, 1709:       All accounts of gallantry, pleasure, and entertainment, shall      be under the article of White's Chocolate-house; poetry, under      that of Will's Coffee-house; learning, under the title of The      Grecian; foreign and domestic news, you will have from Saint      James's Coffee-house; and what else I have to offer on any      other subject shall be dated from my own apartment.  Sir Dick--would one speak of him as the first colyumist?--continued by making what is, we suppose, one of the earliest references in literature to the newspaper man's \"expense account.\" But the expenses of the reporter two centuries ago seem rather modest. Steele said:       I once more desire my reader to consider that as I cannot keep      an ingenious man to go daily to Will's under twopence each day,      merely for his charges; to White's under sixpence; nor to The      Grecian, without allowing him some plain Spanish, to be as able      as others at the learned table; and that a good observer cannot      speak with even Kidney[*] at Saint James's without clean linen:      I say, these considerations will, I hope, make all persons      willing to comply with my humble request of a penny-a-piece.                                            [* Evidently the bus boy.]  But what we started to say was that if, like Dick Steele, we were in the habit of dating our stuff from various inns around the town, our choice for a quiet place in which to compose items of \"gallantry, pleasure, and entertainment\" would be McSorley's--\"The Old House at Home\"--up on Seventh Street. We had feared that this famous old cabin of cheer might have gone west in the recent evaporation; but rambling round in the neighbourhood of the Cooper Union we saw its familiar doorway with a shock of glad surprise. After all, there is no reason why the old-established houses should not go on doing a good business on a Volstead basis. It has never been so much a question of what a man drinks as the atmosphere in which he drinks it. Atrocious cleanliness and glitter and raw naked marble make the soda fountains a disheartening place to the average male. He likes a dark, low-ceilinged, and not too obtrusively sanitary place to take his ease. At McSorley's is everything that the innocent fugitive from the world requires. The great amiable cats that purr in the back room. The old pictures and playbills on the walls. The ancient clocks that hoarsely twang the hours. We cannot imagine a happier place to sit down with a pad of paper and a well-sharpened pencil than at that table in the corner by the window. Or the table just under that really lovely little portrait of Robert Burns--would there be any more propitious place in New York at which to fashion verses? There would be no interruptions, such as make versifying almost impossible in a newspaper office. The friendly bartenders in their lilac-coloured shirts are wise and gracious men. They would not break in upon one's broodings. Every now and then, while the hot sun smote the awnings outside, there would be another china mug of that one-half-of-1-per-cent. ale, which seems to us very good. We repeat: we don't care so much what we drink as the surroundings among which we drink it. We are not, if you will permit the phrase, sot in our ways. We like the spirit of McSorley's, which is decent, dignified, and refined. No club has an etiquette more properly self-respecting.  One does not go to McSorley's without a glimpse at that curious old red pile Bible House. It happened this way: Our friend Endymion was back from his vacation and we were trying to celebrate it in modest fashion. We were telling him all the things that had happened since he went away--that Bob Holliday had had a fortieth birthday, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15795"],["title","The Rover Boys in Camp; or, The Rivals of Pine Island (#0)"],["body","ROVER BOYS IN CAMP  Or, The Rivals of Pine Island  by  Arthur M. Winfield  1904        INTRODUCTION  My Dear Boys: \"The Rover Boys in Camp\" is a complete story in itself, but forms the eighth volume of \"The Rover Boys Series for Young Americans.\"  As I have mentioned before, when I started this line of stories I had in mind to make not more than three, or possibly four, volumes. But the publication of \"Rover Boys at School,\" \"Rover Boys on the Ocean,\" \"Rover Boys in the Jungle,\" and \"Rover Boys Out West\" did not appear to satisfy my readers, and so I followed with \"Rover Boys on the Great Lakes,\" \"Rover Boys in the Mountains,\" and lastly with \"Rover Boys on Land and Sea.\" But the publishers say there is still a cry for \"more! more!\" and so I now present to you this new Rover Boys book, which relates the adventures of Dick, Tom, and Sam, and a number of their old-time friends, at home, at dear old Putnam Hall, and in camp on Pine Island.  In writing this tale I have had in mind two thoughts--one to give my young readers an out-and-out story of jolly summer adventure, along with a little touch of mystery, and the other to show them that it very often pays to return good for evil. Arnold Baxter had done much to bring trouble to the Rover family, but what Dick Rover did in return was Christian-like in the highest meaning of that term. Dick was not a \"goody-goody\" youth, but he was a thoroughly manly one, and his example is well worth following by any lad who wishes to make something of himself.  Once more let me thank all of those who have expressed themselves as satisfied with the previous stories in this series. I earnestly trust the present volume will also prove acceptable to them, and will do them good.  Affectionately and sincerely yours,  ARTHUR M. WINFIELD.     CONTENTS       I.

Turning a New Leaf--Conclusion      CHAPTER I  THE ROVER BOYS AT HOME   \"All out for Oak Run!\" shouted the brakeman of the train, as he thrust his head in through the doorway of the car. \"Step lively, please!\"  \"Hurrah for home!\" shouted a curly-headed youth of sixteen, as he caught up a small dress-suit case. \"Come on, Sam.\"  \"I'm coming, Tom,\" answered a boy a year younger. \"Where is Dick?\"  \"Here I am,\" replied Dick Rover, the big brother of the others. \"Just been in the baggage car, making sure the trunks would be put off,\" he added. \"Say, but this looks natural, doesn't it, after traveling thousands of miles across the Pacific?\"  \"And across the Continent from San Francisco,\" put in Sam Rover.  \"Do you know, I feel as if I'd been away for an age?\"  \"It's what we've gone through with that makes you feel that way, Sam,\" came from Tom Rover. \"Just think of being cast away on a lonely island like Robinson Crusoe! Why, half the folks won't believe our story when they hear it.\"  \"They'll have to believe it.\" Sam hopped down to the depot platform, followed by the others. \"Wonder if the folks got that telegram I forwarded from Buffalo?\"  \"They must have, for there is Jack with the big carriage,\" said Tom, and walked over to the turnout he mentioned. \"Hullo, Jack!\" he called out. \"How is everybody?\"  \"Master Tom!\" ejaculated Jack Ness, the Rovers' hired man. \"Back at last, are you, an' safe an' sound?\"  \"Sound as a dollar, Jack. How are the folks?\"  \"Your father is putty well, and so is your Uncle Randolph. Your Aunt Martha got so excited a-thinkin' you was coming hum she got a headache.\"  \"Dear Aunt Martha!\" murmured Tom. \"I'll soon cure her of that.\" He turned to his brothers. \"What shall we do about the trunks? We can't take 'em in the carriage.\"  \"Aleck is comin' for them boxes,\" said the hired man. \"There's his wagon now.\"  A box wagon came dashing up to the depot platform, with a tall, good-looking colored man on the seat. The eyes of the colored man lit up with pleasure when he caught sight of the boys.  \"Well! well! well!\" he ejaculated, leaping down and rushing forward. \"Heah yo' are at las', bless you! I'se been dat worried 'bout yo' I couldn't 'most sleep fo' t'ree nights. An' jess to t'ink yo' was cast away on an island in de middle of dat Pacific Ocean! It's a wonder dem cannonballs didn't eat yo' up.\"  \"Thanks, but we didn't meet any 'cannonballs,' Aleck, I am thankful to say,\" replied Dick Rover. \"Our greatest trouble was with some mutineers who got drunk and wanted to run things to suit themselves. They might have got the best of us, but a warship visited the island just in the nick of time and rescued us.\"  \"So I heared out ob dat letter wot yo' writ yo' father. An' to t'ink dat Miss Dora Stanhope and de Laning gals was wrecked wid yo'! It's wonderful!\"  \"It certainly was strange, Aleck. But, come, I am anxious to get home. Here are the trunk checks,\" and Dick passed the brasses over.  In a moment more the three boys had entered the carriage, along with Jack Ness. Tom insisted on driving, and away they went at a spanking gait, over Swift River, through the little village of Dexter's Corners, and then out on the road that led to Valley Brook farm.  As my old readers know, the Rover boys were three in number, as already introduced. They were the sons of Anderson Rover, a well-to-do gentleman, who was now living in retirement at Valley Brook, in company with his brother Randolph, and the latter's wife, Martha.  While Anderson Rover had been on a hunt for gold in the heart of Africa, the three boys had been sent by their Uncle Randolph to a military academy known as Putnam Hall. Here they made many friends and also a few enemies, the worst of the latter being Dan Baxter, a bully who wanted his way in everything. Baxter was the offspring of a family of low reputation, and his father, Arnold Baxter, was now in prison for various misdeeds.  The first term at school had been followed by an exciting chase on the ocean, after which the boys had gone with their uncle to the jungles of Africa, in a search after Anderson Rover. After the parent was found it was learned that Arnold Baxter was trying to swindle the Rovers out of a valuable gold mine in the far West, but this plot, after some exciting adventures, was nipped in the bud.  The trip West had tired the boys, and they hailed an outing on the Great Lakes with delight. During this outing they learned something about a treasure located in the heart of the Adirondack Mountains, and the next winter visited the locality and unearthed a box containing gold, silver, and precious stones, worth several thousands of dollars. During this treasure-hunt Dan Baxter did his best to bring the Rover boys to grief, but without success.  After the winter in the Adirondacks, the boys had expected to return at once to Putnam Hall to continue their studies. But three pupils were taken down with scarlet fever, and the academy was promptly closed by the master, Captain Victor Putnam.  \"That gives us another holiday,\" Tom had said. \"Let us put in the time by traveling,\" and, later on, it was decided that the boys should visit California for their health. This they did, and in the seventh volume of this series, entitled \"The Rover Boys on Land and Sea,\" I related the particulars of how they were carried off to sea during a violent storm, in company with three of their old-time girl friends, Dora Stanhope and her cousins, Nellie and Grace Laning. It may be mentioned here that Dick thought Dora Stanhope the sweetest girl in the world, and Tom and Sam were equally smitten with Nellie and Grace Laning.  Being cast away on the Pacific was productive of additional adventures and surprises. On a ship that picked the girls and boys up they fell in again with Dan Baxter, and he did all in his power to make trouble for them. When all were cast away on a deserted island, Dan Baxter joined some mutineers among the sailors, and there was a fight which threatened to end seriously for our friends. But as luck would have it, a United States warship hove into sight, and from that moment the boys and girls, and the friends, who had stuck to them through thick and thin, were safe.  Before the warship left the island a search was made for Dan Baxter and for those who had mutinied with him. But the bully and his evil-minded followers kept out of sight, and so they were left behind to shift for themselves.  \"Do you think that we will ever see Dan Baxter again?\" Sam had questioned.  \"I hardly think so,\" had been Dick's reply. But in this surmise the elder Rover boy was mistaken, as later events will prove.  The journey across the Pacific to San Francisco was accomplished without incident. As soon as the Golden Gate was reached the boys, and also the girls, sent telegrams to their folks, telling them that all was well.  Mrs. Stanhope was staying at Santa Barbara for her health. All of the girls had been stopping with her, and now it was decided that Dora, Nellie, and Grace should go to her again.  \"It's too bad we must part,\" Dick had said, as he squeezed Dora's hand. \"But you are coming East soon, aren't you?\"  \"In a month or two, yes. And what will you do?\"  \"Go back to Putnam Hall most likely--if the scarlet fever scare is over.\"  \"Then"]]]
