[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16355"],["title","Combed Out (#4)"],["body"," forgot my numb feet in thinking of the long dreary day before me, with no one to talk to.  \"Corporal Locke's party!\"  I saw another friend of mine fall out and I went with him. Corporal Locke counted his men and found he had one too many. He looked down the ranks, he saw me, and said:  \"You don't belong to my party--you'll have to go somewhere else.\"  \"I want to work with Private Black--I've been on your party before.\"  \"I don't remember you. Anyhow, you weren't with me yesterday--I'm sorry, but I can't have you.\"  \"Nobody'll notice the difference.\"  \"I'm sorry; the S.M. has told me off once already for having too many men on my party. He went off the deep end [lost his temper] about it and said I'd get him into trouble. I can't let you stay.\"  One after another the fatigue parties were called out and I fell in with my own, the last of all and about eighty strong. Sergeant Hyndman was in charge.  The Sergeant-Major blew his whistle and shouted, \"Move off!\" and one by one the N.C.O.'s gave the words of command:  \"Party--Tshn! Into File--Right Turn! By the Right--Quick March!\"  As we passed out of the camp each of us drew a shovel or a pick from a great heap of tools near the entrance.  We got on to the road and formed fours, and at last began the longed-for march which would restore our circulation and warm our frozen feet.  The snow was still falling heavily and the wind blew it into our faces. We bowed our heads and pulled our caps down over our eyes. Our feet began to glow but our ears became painfully cold instead. We held our hands over them and as our ears grew warm our fingers became numb and frozen, so that we put our hands back into our pockets (although it was against regulations) and tried to think of something else.  Gradually, however, I became warm in every member and was filled with a sense of physical comfort that released my thoughts from immediate, material things. I thought of home and made plans for the future. I had a long, stubbornly contested argument with an imaginary opponent about the issues of the war. And then physical discomfort made itself felt again, all my free and wandering thoughts were gathered in by a wide-flung net and roughly thrown into a narrow dungeon.  I was growing unpleasantly hot and I longed to get rid of my heavy, sodden great-coat. The strap of my haversack was making my shoulder ache. I became peevish and fretful once more.  We swung along the road with rapid strides. Some of the feebler marchers showed signs of weariness and began to grumble at our speed. There was an ironical shout of \"Double up in front,\" whereupon the front fours slowed down a little.  The wind increased in power and the snow flew past us in horizontal lines obscuring the Flemish landscape. We marched on in silence for an hour or more until suddenly the front fours halted and all the others thronged up against them. We had reached our destination.  There was a broad-gauge railway. On one side of it huge stacks of sleepers stretched away in long rows that were soon lost to sight in the wintry atmosphere. On the other side was a barbed wire fence. Beyond it lay flat fields on which the snow had settled evenly. In one of the fields was the dim form of a farm-building, barely visible through the rush and turmoil of dancing snowflakes.  A Sergeant of the Royal Engineers came up and told us what our work would be. We were to carry all the sleepers across the line and stack them in four rows on the far side of the fence.  \"Is it a task job?\" we asked.  The Sergeant did not know.  \"What did they make us bring our shovels for?\"  A voice, mocking such a na√Øve questioner, answered:  \"Don't yer know the army be now?\"  We broke down a section of the fence. Two men were assigned to each stack. They loaded each sleeper on to the shoulders of a couple of men who carried it across the railway lines into the field, where it would be received and stacked by other men.  Hour by hour we trudged to and fro in pairs, bearing our wet and heavy loads. We lost consciousness of everything except driving snow, squelching mud, aching backs and sore shoulders. When one shoulder became so sore that mere contact with our load was intensely painful, we changed over to the other, until that too became bruised, and then we would change back again. And so on, hour by hour.  Our legs seemed as heavy as lead and yet they seemed to move of their own accord without any effort of the will. Our minds became blurred and numb--a numbness that was broken from time to time by a sharp stab of pain whenever a sleeper was placed across our shoulders.  \"For Christ's sake, let's 'ave a blow,\" said my partner suddenly.  I looked at my watch. It was a quarter-past ten--nearly two hours more till lunch!  We observed that only a small number of men were working, and my partner blurted out:  \"I ain't goin' ter do more'n me share. There's a lot o' fellers swingin' the lead be'ind them stacks. I'm goin' ter 'ave a bit of a rest, I'm bloody well done up.\"  We both went behind a stack and found that a crowd of men had gone there before us. One of them shouted cheerfully: \"Here come two more leadswingers!\" [idlers] We leaned against the wood and rested, but a few minutes had hardly passed when a Corporal appeared and shouted peremptorily: \"Come on out o' that--get on wi' yer job an' put a jerk in it.\" We struggled reluctantly back to our work.  The wearisome, monotonous trudge began again. As the first stacks disappeared the journey became longer and longer. I again looked at my watch--it was twenty to eleven. The quarter-past ten seemed several hours ago! The way the time dragged drove us to despair. But there was no escape--we had to live through every minute of this dismal day.  My partner and I worked on in silence. Gradually the men slackened their pace and tried to miss their turn. We did the same. Others, who were behind us, followed suit, refusing to do more than their share. Our progress became slower and slower until at length it stopped altogether. There was a long straggling queue in front of the half-demolished stack. The first pair of men refused to take the sleeper held in readiness for them, protesting that there were others who ought to have gone before, and the others refused to work until the first two had taken their turn. A deadlock ensued and then a Sergeant came up with \"What's the matter now? This ain't a bleed'n' picnic! Don't yer know there's a war on? Yer like a lot o' school kids. Go an' get a bloody move on!\"  A chorus of voices asserted that some people couldn't play the game and were swinging the lead and dodging their turn. Thereupon the Sergeant formed us up into two ranks and ordered us to proceed with the work. This interruption made at least a portion of our time pass more quickly. Then we continued our wearisome tramp. An age seemed to pass. I looked at my watch, but it was only twenty-three minutes after eleven. To and fro we went with bruised shoulders, aching backs and numbed intelligence. I fell into a kind of semi-conscious state. Suddenly the whistle blew for lunch. How quickly the last twenty-seven minutes seemed to have passed!  It was good to have an hour's rest before us. As for the afternoon, well, there was no need to think about it, for it was still a long way off. Besides, somehow or other, the afternoons always seemed to pass more quickly than the mornings. Moreover, we had paraded an hour earlier than usual, so perhaps we would also stop work an hour earlier.  \"'Urry up an' dror yer tea,\" our Sergeant shouted. \"Yer only gettin' 'alf an hour fur yer dinner--we've got ter git the job done ter-day.\"  \"Why didn' yer tell us it was a task job? Gorblimy--we ain't done 'alf of it! We won't get 'ome afore five or six o'clock ter-night.\"  \"_I_ can't 'elp it, 'tain't _my_ fault. Yer've got ter git it done, them's me orders!\"  There was vociferous grumbling and swearing that continued while we formed a queue and filed past a man who poured tea in our mugs from three large dixies.  We sat down by the stacks wherever we could find shelter from the wind. We were still hot and perspiring after our morning's labours. We ate our rations in silence, for the resentful shouting had died down and had given way to a sullen quiet.  When we had finished our meal we stared vacantly at the snowflakes that were blown over the top of the stack above our heads and whirled round and round in front of our eyes. Gradually we began to feel the cold again. Many of us got up and walked about, for it was nipping our feet. I was stiff in every limb and full of bitter thoughts. I hoped the half-hour would be over soon.  At length the Sergeant blew the whistle and shouted:  \"Fall in! Yer'd better put a jerk in it--yer won't go till yer've finished. It's a task job. Yer didn't shift 'alf the sleepers this mornin'--there's another couple o' thousand left, so get a bloody move on!\"  The grumbling was renewed in the ranks.  \"It's no good yer bloody well grousin'. The work's got ter be done. Carry on!\"  Our tedious round began again. The distance from the old stacks to the new increased steadily. We tramped through mud and slush in wind and snow, hour by hour.  \"I'm goin' ter 'ave a rest--I've 'ad enough o' this,\" said my partner. I felt annoyed, for although I was stiff and tired and sore, I had again relapsed into that state of dulled sensibility in which my limbs seemed to move automatically and time to have no existence at all. Although I was aware of pain I was yet indifferent to it. And now my partner was going to drag me back to full consciousness. I gave way to his wish and we leaned against a stack. We stayed there with several others until we were discovered by a Corporal who chased us out and abused us roundly.  We went on with our work. The brief rest had only done harm, for the first sleeper that was subsequently laid on to my shoulders produced such a pang that I had to close my eyes for a moment. Nor could I set my stiff"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16355"],["title","Combed Out (#5)"],["body"," in motion without difficulty. I silently cursed my partner.  The dreary hours dragged on. I tried hard to fall back into my former state of blurred consciousness, but the very attempt itself frustrated the effort. I was full of growing resentment against my partner. My dormant anger was aroused, it had found an object and, against all reason and fairness, demanded vengeance. I pretended to stumble and jerked the sleeper so as to hurt his bruised shoulder.  \"'Ere, what yer doin' of?\" he shouted, in great pain. \"Christ Almighty--be a bit careful!\"  In a moment I regretted what I had done and said, \"Sorry, I stumbled over something--I hope I didn't hurt you!\" I felt ashamed and all my resentment vanished. Thereupon I became too oppressed in spirit even to look at my watch.  We had been splashing and squelching to and fro, I did not know how long, when an officer arrived. He stood still for a moment and watched us work, and then he said:  \"The job's got to be done this afternoon, my lads, but I'll try to get you a day off to-morrow. Who's in charge of the party?\"  We pointed to Sergeant Hyndman. He was sitting in an improvised shelter in front of a fire, sipping hot tea. He had spent the greater part of the day there and had not observed the arrival of the officer, who was walking slowly towards him. Suddenly he jumped up and there was an exchange of words which we could not hear, although we tried hard to do so. The Sergeant came over to us, looking rather disconcerted, so we were able to guess the nature of the conversation.  We felt greatly encouraged and worked with renewed vigour. The stacks vanished one by one. Time appeared to slip by with gathering speed. A kind of common rhythm seemed to pervade our movements as we plodded to and fro with mechanical regularity.  The officer went up to the stacks from which we were removing the sleepers and made a mental calculation. \"Only four hundred sleepers left now, boys--that's five apiece or ten to each pair. You'll soon be finished, and I've ordered lorries to take you home!\"  His kindness did us good and we worked with a kind of grim determination. My partner was coming to the end of his strength. His knees were bent and from time to time he staggered, jerking the sleeper so as to make me wince with pain. But he kept up obstinately. We counted the sleepers as we received them--one, two, three and so on. This occupied our minds and the time passed all the more quickly. Eight ... nine ... ten! At last our work was done! \"Thank God,\" said my partner with deep conviction. We rested against one of the newly erected stacks, but it was not long before Sergeant Hyndman came striding up and addressed us angrily. He had evidently been snubbed by the officer and was giving relief to his mortification by bullying us.  \"What yer doin' there? Swingin' it on yer mates, are yer? Call yerselves sportsmen, do yer? Get back an' bloody well do yer bit!\"  \"We've done our share--there were four hundred sleepers left, which makes ten journeys for each pair. If it doesn't work out it's because some of the others have been swinging the lead behind the stacks. We've carried our ten and aren't going to do any more.\"  \"Why d'yer let 'em swing it on yer? It's yer own bleed'n' fault! D'yer think I'm goin' ter stand over yer all day? Some o' you blokes is as 'elpless as a lot o' kids--yer want a wet nurse to look arter yer!\"  \"That's what _you're_ there for, to look after us!\"  \"Don't bloody well tell me what I'm there for! I know me job an' don't want no tellin'. Get stuck into it an' don't let me 'ave any o' yer bloody lip, else yer'll be up fur orderly room--I shan't give yer another warnin'!\"  Seeing that argument was useless, we walked away and crossed the railway lines. My partner growled: \"I 'ope I meet 'im in civvy life--I'll give 'im somethin' ter think about--I've seen better things'n what 'e is crorlin' about in cheese!\"  There were fifty or sixty sleepers left. We dawdled on our way back, hoping that there would be enough men in front of us to clear the lot. The officer shouted: \"Come along, my lads, sharp's the word and quick's the action! You'll be finished in a few minutes.\"  The khaki-clad flock straggled forward. The remaining sleepers were loaded on to our shoulders--my partner and I received the last one. As we carried it off a cheer was raised by the other men.  At last the whistle blew and we fell in. The sky was still covered with dark, heavy clouds, but the snow had ceased to fall and the wind had dropped. We could see the dreary landscape a little better now. The railway lines curved away until, in the far distance, they ran into a ghostly procession of tall, slim poplars that filed across the dim horizon and marked the passage of a main road. On one side of the lines long rows of dark squares in the snow showed where the sleepers had lain before we moved them. A brown stretch of churned and trodden mud and water connected them with the new stacks that extended in four rows along the other side of the lines. We had shifted five thousand eight hundred sleepers in all. Around us were level, snow-covered fields unrelieved by anything except an occasional tree and the farm. It consisted of three buildings, a house and two big barns, forming three sides of a square. The cottage had a low, thatched roof, dirty, whitewashed walls, and green shutters. In the middle of the square was a huge muck heap, covered with patches of melting snow. A pig was pushing its snout into it here and there and grunting from time to time. There was no other sign of life anywhere. A dreary, depressing landscape!  \"Remember Belgium!\" said one of the men in the ranks derisively.  \"We won't forget it in a hurry!\"  \"Fritz can have it for all I care!\"  \"He's welcome to it--I don't want it, I want to get back to Blighty!\"  We were called to attention. The promised lorries were waiting for us--three lorries for eighty men. We marched towards them in file, but as we got nearer to them, the men broke rank and everybody rushed wildly to get in first so as to secure any available boxes or petrol-tins that might serve as seats. A noisy, turbulent throng clustered round each lorry. We scrambled in, pushing, hustling, and swearing. We were soon so crowded together that there seemed to be no room for any more, but nevertheless more men climbed up and forced an entrance. We formed a compact mass and our picks and shovels were heaped on the floor in everybody's way.  The lorries started with a lurch so that we all staggered backwards. They raced along, and bumped, and swayed from side to side. The roof of the lorry in which I stood was so low that I had to keep my head bent forward all the time. The fumes from the exhaust made our eyes water and smart.  We reached camp after about half an hour's ride. We jumped out and lined up on the road. Sergeant Hyndman perceived the Commanding Officer strolling about amongst the tents and said to us in an awe-stricken voice:  \"Smarten up a bit, for Christ's sake--there's the Captin walkin' about--don't make no bloomers when yer dismissin' else yer'll get extra shovel-drill an' get me into trouble in the bargin. Mind yer salute prop'ly.... Party--Tshn! Inter File, Right Turn! Quick March!\"  We wheeled into the camp holding our picks and shovels at the trail. Our Commanding Officer stood still and watched us. As we passed him the Sergeant yelled out with unaccustomed sharpness: \"Eyes--Right!\" We all turned our heads smartly to the right and he saluted with strained, affected precision. The Captain touched the peak of his cap in a perfunctory manner. He hardly seemed to be looking at us at all, but suddenly he spotted a man who was not holding his shovel perfectly horizontally and thundered:  \"Hold your shovel properly, that man there!\"  The man was disconcerted for a moment but soon re-adjusted his shovel to the satisfaction of his superior. The ground was so muddy and uneven that it was sometimes impossible to keep the exact military formation. Without having noticed it, I was a little more than the regulation distance from the man in front of me.  \"Close in there, you with the glasses,\" bawled the Captain in a resentful voice, as though my transgression were intended as a personal insult. But his anger was diverted by another man and he shouted with gathering fury:  \"That tall man over there--hold your pick properly. Not like that, damn it ... hold it at the point of balance--no, no, no, not like that ... here, Sergeant, take that man's name and number and give it to the Corporal of the Police. He'll do half an hour's extra shovel-drill this evening.\"  We halted. The Sergeant made a note of the offender's name and then said to us in an awestruck whisper: \"Now mind yer dismiss prop'ly for Christ's sake!\"  We faced to the front and on the command \"Dismiss!\" we all turned to the right, raised our picks and shovels and transferred them from our right hands to our left, touched the peaks of our caps with our right hands, turning the palms outwards, paused a moment and then broke away.  \"Fall in, fall in--very bad, very bad, absolutely disgraceful!\" bawled our infuriated C.O. \"If you don't do it correctly this time, you'll get an hour's extra drill every day for a week! Now dismiss them again, Sergeant!\"  The prospect of extra drill filled us with dismay. Sore shouldered, stiff, and aching in every limb, oppressed and wearied in mind and body, we only had one intense desire--to get away, to hide somewhere, to enjoy at least a brief spell of warmth and comfort.  The Sergeant gave the command, and we dismissed a second time. We went through the absurd performance with anxious punctiliousness, but three men, either through fear, weariness or carelessness, made some slight mistakes and their names were taken for extra drill.  As soon as the men were off the parade ground there was a wild stampede in the direction of the cook-house.  The scramble became a mad hustle. The men raced"]]]
