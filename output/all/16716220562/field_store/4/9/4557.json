They are both clever, just clever enough for my purpose. Catherine might with advantage be a shade less beautiful, but Mabel will, I am convinced, fulfil all my expectations. Then, if only Loftie,\" but here Mrs. Bertram sighed. She was returning from her visit to Mrs. Meadowsweet, walking slowly down the long avenue which led to the Manor. This avenue was kept in no order; its edges were not neatly cut, and weeds appeared here and there through its scantily gravelled roadway. The grass parterre round the house, however, was smooth as velvet, and interspersed with gay flower-beds. It looked like a little agreeable oasis in the middle of a woodland, for the avenue was shaded by forest trees, and the house itself had a background of two or three acres of an old wood.  Mrs. Bertram was tired, and walked slowly. She did not consider herself a proud woman, but in this she was mistaken. Every line of her upright figure, each glance of her full, dark eyes, each word that dropped from her lips spoke of pride both of birth and position. She often said to herself, \"I am thankful that I don't belong to the common folk; it would grate on my nerves to witness their vulgarities,--their bad taste would torture me; their want of refinement would act upon my nature like a blister. But I am not proud, I uphold my dignity, I respect myself and my family, but with sinful, unholy pride I have no part.\"  This was by no means the opinion held of her, however, by the Northbury folk. They had hailed her advent with delight; they had witnessed her arrival with the keenest, most absorbing interest, and, to the horror of the good lady herself, had one and all called on her. She was petrified when this very natural event happened. She had bargained for a life of retirement for herself and her girls. She had never imagined that society of a distinctly lower strata than that into which she had been born would be forced on her. Forced! Whoever yet had forced Mrs. Bertram into any path she did not care to walk in?  She was taken unawares by the first visitors, and they absolutely had the privilege of sitting on her sofas, and responding to a few icy remarks which dropped from her lips.  But the next day she was armed for the combat. The little parlor-maid, in her neat black dress, clean muslin apron, large frilled, picturesque collar, and high mob-cap, was instructed to say \"Not at home\" to all comers. She was a country girl, not from Northbury, but from some still more rusticated spot, and she thought she was telling a frightful lie, and blushed and trembled while she uttered it. So apparent was her confusion that Miss Peters, when she and her sister, Mrs. Butler, appeared on the scene, rolled her eyes at the taller lady and asked her in a pronounced manner if it would not be well to drop a tract on the heinousness of lying in the avenue.  This speech was repeated by Clara to the cook, who told it again to the young ladies' maid, who told it to the young ladies, who narrated it to their mother.  Mrs. Bertram smiled grimly.  \"Don't repeat gossip, my dears,\" she said, Then after a pause she remarked aloud: \"The difficulty will be about returning the calls.\"  Mabel, the youngest and most subservient of the girls, ventured to ask her mother what she intended to do, but Mrs. Bertram was too wise to disclose her plans, that is, if she had made any.  The Rector of Northbury was one of the first to visit the new inhabitants of the Manor. To him Mrs. Bertram opened her doors gladly. He was old, unmarried, and of good family. She was glad there was at least one gentleman in the place with whom she might occasionally exchange a word.  About a fortnight after his visit the Rector inclosed some tickets for a bazaar to Mrs. Bertram. The tickets were accompanied by a note, in which he said that it would gratify the good Northbury folk very much if Mrs. Bertram and the young ladies would honor the bazaar with their presence.  \"Every soul in the place will be there,\" said Mr. Ingram. \"This bazaar is a great event to us, and its object is, I think, a worthy one. We badly want a new organ for our church.\"  \"Eureka!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bertram when she had read this note.  \"What is the matter, mother?\" exclaimed Mabel.  \"Only that I have found a way out of my grand difficulty,\" responded their mother, tossing Mr. Ingram's note and the tickets for the bazaar into Catherine's lap.  \"Are you so delighted to go to this country bazaar, mother?\" asked the eldest daughter.  \"Delighted! No, it will be a bore.\"  \"Then why did you say Eureka! and look so pleased?\"  \"Because on that day I shall leave cards on the Northbury folk--not one of them will be at home.\"  \"Shabby,\" muttered Catherine. Her dark cheek flushed, she turned away.  Mabel put out her little foot and pressed it against her sister's. The pressure signified warning.  \"Then you are not going to the bazaar, mother?\" she questioned.  \"I don't know. I may drop in for a moment or two, quite at the close. It would not do to offend Mr. Ingram.\"  \"No,\" replied Mabel. \"He is a dear, _gentlemanly_ old man.\"  \"Don't use that expression, my love. It is my object in life that _all_ your acquaintances in the world of men should be gentlemen. It is unnecessary therefore to specify any one by a term which must apply to all.\"  Mrs. Bertram then asked Mabel to reply to Mr. Ingram's note. The reply was a warm acceptance, and Mr. Ingram cheered those of his parishioners who pined for the acquaintance of the great lady, with the information that they would certainly meet her at the bazaar.  Accordingly when the fateful day arrived the town was empty, and the Fisherman's Hall (Northbury was a seaport), in which the bazaar was held was packed to overflowing. Accordingly Mrs. Bertram in a neat little brougham, which she had hired for the occasion, dropped her cards from house to house in peace; accordingly, too, she caught the maids-of-all-work in their undress toilets, and the humble homes looking their least pretentious.  The bazaar was nearly at an end, when at last, accompanied by her two plainly-dressed, but dainty looking girls, she appeared on the scene.  The Northbury folk had all been watching for her. Those who had been fortunate enough to enter the sacred precincts of the Manor watched with interest, mingled with approval. (Her icy style was quite _comme-il-faut_, they said.) Those who had been met by the frightened handmaid's \"not at home\" watched with interest, mixed with disapproval, but all, all waited for Mrs. Bertram with interest.  \"How late these fashionable people are,\" quote Miss Peters. \"It's absolutely five o'clock. My dear Martha, do sit down and rest yourself. You look fit to drop. I'll keep an eye on the door and tell you the very moment Mrs. Bertram comes in. Mrs. Gorman Stanley has promised to introduce us. Mrs. Gorman Stanley was fortunate enough to find Mrs. Bertram in. It was she who told us about the drawing-room at the Manor. Fancy! Mrs. Bertram has only a felt carpet on her drawing-room. Not even a red felt, which looks warm and wears. But a sickly green! Mrs. Gorman Stanley told me _as a fact_ that the carpet was quite a worn-out shade between a green and a brown; and the curtains--she said the _drawing room_ curtains were only cretonne. You needn't stare at me, Martha. Mrs. Gorman Stanley never makes mistakes. All the same, though she couldn't tell why, she owned that the room had a _distingué_ effect. _En règle_, that was it; she said the room was _en règle_.\"  \"Maria, if you could stop talking for a moment and fetch me an ice, I'd be obliged,\" answered Mrs. Butler. \"Oh!\" standing up, \"there's Mrs. Gorman Stanley. How do you do, Mrs. Gorman Stanley? Our great lady hasn't chosen to put in her appearance yet. For my part I don't suppose she's any better than the rest of us, and so I say to Maria. Well, Maria, what's the matter now?\"  \"Here's your ice,\" said Miss Peters; \"take it. Don't forget that you promised to introduce us to Mrs. Bertram, Mrs. Gorman Stanley.\"  Mrs. Gorman Stanley was the wealthy widow of a retired fish-buyer. She liked to condescend; also to show off her wealth. It pleased her to assume an acquaintance with Mrs. Bertram, although she thoroughly despised that good lady's style of furnishing a house.  \"I'll introduce you with pleasure, my dear,\" she said to Mrs. Butler. \"Yes, I like Mrs. Bertram very much. Did you say she was out when you called? Oh! she was in to me. Yes, I saw the house. I don't think she had finished furnishing it. The drawing-room looked quite bare. A made-up sort of look, you understand. Lots of flowers on the tables, and that nasty, cold, cheap felt under your feet. Not that _I_ mind how a house is furnished.\" (She did very much. Her one and only object in life seemed to be to lade her own mansion with ugly and expensive upholstery.) \"Now, what's the matter, Miss Peters? Why, you are all on wires. Where _are_ you off to now?\"  \"I see the Rector,\" responded Miss Peters. \"I'll run and ask him when he expects Mrs. Bertram. I'll be back presently with the news.\"  The little lady tripped away, forcing her slim form through the ever-increasing crowd. The rector was walking about with a very favorite small parishioner seated on his shoulder.  \"Mr. Ingram,\" piped Miss Peters. \"Don't you think Mrs. Bertram might favor us with her presence by now? We have all been looking for her. It's past five o'clock, and--\"  There was a hush, a pause. At that moment Mrs. Bertram was sailing into the room. Miss Peters' exalted tones reached her ears. She shuddered, turned pale, and also turned her back on the eager little spinster.  Nobody quite knew how it was managed, but Mrs. Bertram was introduced to very few of the Northbury folk. They all wanted to know her; they talked about her, and came in her way, and stared at her whenever they could. There was an expectant hush when she and the Rector were seen approaching any"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15778"],["title","The Honorable Miss: A Story of an Old-Fashioned Town (#3)"],["body","group.  \"I do declare it's the Grays she's going to patronize,\" one jealous matron said.  But the Grays were passed over just as sedulously as the Joneses and the Smiths. Excitement, again and again on the tenter-hooks, invariably came to nothing. Even Mrs. Gorman Stanley, who had sat on Mrs. Bertram's sofa, and condemned her felt carpet was only acknowledged by the most passing and stately recognition. Little chance had the poor lady of effecting other introductions; she realized for the first time that she was only a quarter introduced to the great woman herself.  The fact was this: There was not a soul in Northbury, at least there was not an acknowledged soul who could combat Mrs. Bertram's will. She had made up her mind to talk to no one but Mr. Ingram at the bazaar. She carried out her resolve, and that though the Rector had formed such pleasant visions of making every one cheerful and happy all round, for he knew the simple weaknesses and desires of his flock, and saw not the smallest harm in gratifying them. Why should not the Manor and the town be friendly?  Mrs. Bertram saw a very good reason why they should not. Therefore the Rector's dreams came apparently to nothing.     CHAPTER III.  A GENTLEMAN, MADAM.   Only apparently. Every one knows how small the little rift within the lute is. So are most beginnings.  Mrs. Bertram felt, that in her way, she had effected quite a victory. She stepped into her brougham to return to Rosendale Manor with a pleasing sense of triumph.  \"I am thankful to say that ordeal is over,\" she remarked. \"And I think,\" she continued, with a smile, \"that when the Northbury people see my cards, awaiting them on their humble hall-tables, they will have learnt their lesson.\"  Neither of the girls made any response to this speech. Mabel was leaning back in the carriage looking bored and cross, but Catherine's expression was unusually bright.  \"Mother,\" she exclaimed suddenly, \"I met such a nice girl at the bazaar.\"  \"You made an acquaintance at the bazaar, my dear Catherine,\" answered Mrs. Bertram with alacrity. \"You made an acquaintance? The acquaintance of a girl? Who?\"  \"Her name is Beatrice Meadowsweet. She is a dear, delightful, fresh girl, and exactly my own age.\"  Catherine's dark face was all aglow. Her handsome brown eyes shone with interest and pleasure.  \"Catherine, how often, how very often have I told you that expressions of rapture such as you have just given way to are underbred.\"  \"Why are they underbred, mother?\" Catherine's tone was aggressive, and Mabel again kicked her sister's foot.  The kick was returned with vigor, and Catherine said in an earnest though deliberate voice:  \"Why are expressions of rapture underbred? Can enthusiasm, that fire of the gods, be vulgar?\"  \"Kate, you are cavilling. Expressions of rapture generally show a lack of breeding because as a rule they are exaggerated, therefore untrue. In this case they are manifestly untrue, for how is it possible for you to tell that the girl you have just been speaking to is dear, delightful, and fresh?\"  \"Her face is fresh, her manners are fresh, her expression is delightful. There is no use, mother, you can't crush me. I am in love with Beatrice Meadowsweet.\"  Mrs. Bertram's brow became clouded. It was one of the bitter defeats which she had ever and anon to acknowledge to herself that, in the midst of her otherwise victorious career, she could never get the better of her eldest daughter Catherine.  \"Who introduced you to this girl?\" she asked, after a pause.  \"The Rector. He saw me standing by one of the stalls, looking what I felt--awfully bored. He came up in his kind way and took my hand, and said: 'My dear, you don't know any one, I am afraid. You would like to make some acquaintances, would you not?' I replied: 'I am most anxious to know some of the nice people all around me.'\"  \"My dear Catherine! The _nice_ people! And when you knew my express wishes!\"  \"Yes, mother, but they weren't mine. And I had to be truthful, at any cost. Beatrice was standing not far off, and when I said this my eye met hers, and we both smiled. Then the rector introduced me to her, and we mutually voted the bazaar close and hot, and went out to watch the tennis players in the garden. We had a jolly time. I have not laughed so much since I came to this slow, poky corner of the world.\"  \"And what were you doing, Mabel?\" questioned her mother. \"Did you, too, pick up an undesirable acquaintance and march away into the gardens with her? Was your new friend also fresh, delightful and dear?\"  \"I wish she had been, mother,\" answered Mabel, her tone still very petulant. \"But I hadn't Kate's luck. I was introduced to no one, although lots of people stared at me, and whispered about me as I passed.\"  \"And you saw this paragon of Catherine's?\"  \"Yes, I saw her.\"  \"What did you think of her, May? I like to get your opinion, my love. You have a good deal of penetration. Tell me frankly what you thought of this low-born miss, whom Catherine degraded herself by talking to.\"  Mabel looked at her sister. Catherine's eyes flashed. Mabel replied demurely:  \"I thought Miss Meadowsweet quiet-looking and graceful.\"  Catherine took Mabel's hand unnoticed by their mother and squeezed it, and Mrs. Bertram, who was not wholly devoid of tact, thought it wisest to let the conversation drop.  The next day the Rector called, and Mrs. Bertram asked him, in an incidental way what kind of people the Meadowsweets were.  \"Excellent people,\" he replied, rubbing his hands softly together. \"Excellent, worthy, honorable. I have few parishioners whom I think more highly of than Beatrice and her mother.\"  Mrs. Bertram's brow began to clear.  \"A mother and daughter,\" she remarked. \"Only a mother and a daughter, Mr. Ingram?\"  \"Only a mother and a daughter, my dear madam. Poor Meadowsweet left us six years ago. He was one of my churchwardens, a capital fellow, so thoroughgoing and reliable. A sound churchman, too. In short, everything that one could desire. He died rather suddenly, and I was afraid Mrs. Meadowsweet would leave Northbury, but Bee did not wish it. Bee has a will of her own, and I fancy she's attached to us all.\"  \"I am very glad that you can give us such a pleasant account of these parishioners of yours, dear Mr. Ingram,\" responded Mrs. Bertram. \"The fact is, I am in a difficult position here. No, the girls won't overhear us; they are busy at their embroidery in that distant corner. Well, perhaps, to make sure. Kate,\" Mrs. Bertram raised her voice, \"I know the Rector is going to give us the pleasure of his company to tea. Mr. Ingram, I shall not allow you to say no. Kate, will you and Mabel go into the garden, and bring in a leaf of fresh strawberries. Now, Mr. Ingram I want you to see our strawberries, and to taste them. The gardener tells us that the Manor strawberries are celebrated. Run, dears, don't be long.\"  The girls stepped out through the open French window, interlaced their arms round one another and disappeared.  \"They are good girls,\" said the mother, \"but Kate has a will of her own. Mr. Ingram, you will allow me to take you into my confidence. I am often puzzled to know how to act towards Catherine. She is a good girl, but I can't lead her. She is only seventeen, only just seventeen. Surely that is too young an age to walk quite without leading strings.\"  Mr. Ingram was an old bachelor, but he was one of those mellow, gentle, affectionate men who make the most delightful companions, whose sympathy is always ready, and tact always to the fore. Mr. Ingram was full of both sympathy and tact, but he had also a little gentle vanity to be tickled, and when a handsome woman, still young, appealed to him with pathos in her eyes and voice, he laid himself, metaphorically, at her feet.  \"My dear madam,\" he responded, \"it is most gratifying to me to feel that I can be of the least use to you. Command me at all times, I beg. As to Miss Catherine, who can guide her better than her excellent mother? I don't know much about you, Mrs. Bertram, but I feel--forgive me, I am a man of intuition--I feel that you are one to look up to. Miss Catherine is a fortunate girl. You are right. She is far too young to walk alone. Seventeen, did you say--pooh--a mere child, a baby. An immature creature, ignorant, innocent, fresh, but undeveloped; just the age, Mrs. Bertram, when she needs the aid and counsel of a mother like you.\"  Mrs. Bertram's dark eyes glowed with pleasure.  \"I am glad you agree with me,\" she said. \"The fact is, Mr. Ingram, we have come to the Manor to retrench a little, to economize, to live in retirement. By-and-bye, I shall take Catherine and Mabel to London. As a mother, I have duties to perform to them. These, when the time comes, shall not be neglected. Mr. Ingram, I must be very frank, I _don't_ want to know the good folk of Northbury.\"  Mr. Ingram started at this very plain speaking. He had lived for thirty years with the Northbury people. They had not vulgarized him; their troubles and their pleasures alike were his. His heart and soul, his life and strength were given up to them. He did not feel himself any the less a gentleman because those whom he served were, many of them, lowly born. He started, therefore, both inwardly and outwardly at Mrs. Bertram's plain speech, and instantly, for he was a man of very nice penetration, saw that the arrival of this lady, this brilliant sun of society, in the little world of Northbury, would not add to the smoothness of his lot.  Before he could get in a word, however, Mrs. Bertram quickly continued:  \"And Catherine is determined to make a friend of Beatrice Meadowsweet.\"  \"She is quite right, Mrs. Bertram. I introduced Miss Catherine to Beatrice yesterday. They will make delightful companions; they are about the same age--I can vouch for the life and spirit possessed by my friend Bee, and if I mistake not Miss Catherine will be her worthy companion.\"  Mrs. Bertram laughed.  \"I wish I could"]]]
