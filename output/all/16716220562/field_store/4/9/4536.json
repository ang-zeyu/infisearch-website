The sound of the Mexican stampede could yet be heard, moving to the south, but they, rescuers and rescued, walked in silence save for the sound of their feet in the mud of the wind-swept plain. Ned looked curiously at the faces of those whom they had saved, but the night had not lightened, and he could discern nothing. They went thus a full quarter of an hour. The noise of the stampede sank away in the south, and then the Panther laughed.  It was a deep, hearty, unctuous laugh that came from the very depths of the man's chest. It was a laugh with no trace of merely superficial joy. He who uttered it laughed because his heart and soul were in it. It was a laugh of mirth, relief and triumph, all carried to the highest degree. It was a long laugh, rising and falling, but when it ceased and the Panther had drawn a deep breath he opened his mouth again and spoke the words that were in his mind.  \"I shorely did some rippin' an' roarin' then,\" he said. \"It was the best chance I ever had, an' I guess I used it. How things did work for us! Them sleepy sentinels, an' then the stampede of the animals, carryin' Urrea an' the rest right away with it.\"  \"Fortune certainly worked for us,\" said Ned.  \"And we can find no words in which to describe to you our gratitude,\" said the crippled man on the horse. \"We were informed very clearly by Urrea that we were rebels and, under the decree of Santa Anna, would be executed. Even our young friend here, this boy, William Allen, would not have been spared.\"  \"We ain't all the way out of the woods yet,\" said the Panther, not wishing to have their hopes rise too high and then fall. \"Of course Urrea an' his men have some arms left. They wouldn't stack 'em all under the shed, an' they can get more from other Mexicans in these parts. When they learn from their trailers how few we are they'll follow.\"  The rescued were silent, save one, evidently a veteran frontiersman, who said:  \"Let 'em come. I was took by surprise, not thinkin' any Mexicans was north of the Rio Grande. But now that I've got a rifle on one shoulder an' a musket on the other I think I could thrash an acre-lot full of 'em.\"  \"That's the talk,\" said Obed White. \"We'll say to 'em: 'Come one, come all, this rock from its firm base may fly, but we're the boys who'll never say die.'\"  They relapsed once more into silence. The rain had lightened a little, but the night was as dark as ever. The boy whom the man had called William Allen drew up by the side of Ned. They were of about the same height, and each was as tall and strong as a man.  \"Have you any friends here with you?\" asked Ned.  \"All of them are my friends, but I made them in captivity. I came to Texas to find my fortune, and I found this.\"  The boy laughed, half in pity of himself, and half with genuine humor.  \"But I ought not to complain,\" he added, \"when we've been saved in the most wonderful way. How did you ever happen to do it?\"  \"We've been following you all the way from the other side of the Rio Grande, waiting a good chance. It came to-night with the darkness, the rain, and the carelessness of the Mexicans. I heard the man call you William Allen. My name is Fulton, Edward Fulton, Ned to my friends.\"  \"And mine's Will to my friends.\"  \"And you and I are going to be friends, that's sure.\"  \"Nothing can be surer.\"  The hands of the two boys met in a strong grasp, signifying a friendship that was destined to endure.  The Panther and Obed now began to seek a place for a camp. They knew that too much haste would mean a breakdown, and they meant that the people whom they had rescued should have a rest. But it took a long time to find the trees which would furnish wood and partial shelter. It was Obed who made the happy discovery some time after midnight. Turning to their left, they entered a grove of dwarf oaks, covering a half acre or so, and with much labor and striving built a fire. They made it a big fire, too, and fed it until the flames roared and danced. Ned noticed that all the rescued prisoners crouched close to it, as if it were a giver of strength and courage as well as warmth, and now the light revealed their faces. He looked first at the crippled man, and the surprise that he had felt at his first glimpse of him increased.  The stranger was of a type uncommon on the border. His large features showed cultivation and the signs of habitual and deep thought. His thick white hair surmounted a broad brow. His clothing, although torn by thorns and briars, was of fine quality. Ned knew instinctively that it was a powerful face, one that seldom showed the emotions behind it. The rest, except the boy, were of the border, lean, sun-browned men, dressed in tanned deerskin.  The Panther and Obed also gazed at the crippled man with great curiosity. They knew the difference, and they were surprised to find such a man in such a situation. He did not seem to notice them at first, but from his seat on a log leaned over the fire warming his hands, which Ned saw were large, white and smooth. His legs lay loosely against the log, as if he were suffering from a species of paralysis. The others, soaked by the rain, which, however, now ceased, were also hovering over the fire which was giving new life to the blood in their veins. The man with the white hands turned presently and, speaking to Ned, Obed and the Panther, said:  \"My name is Roylston, John Roylston.\"  Ned started.  \"I see that you have heard of it,\" continued the stranger, but without vanity. \"Yes, I am the merchant of New Orleans. I have lands and other property in this region for which I have paid fairly. I hold the deeds and they are also guaranteed to me by Santa Anna and the Mexican Congress. I was seized by this guerilla leader, Urrea. He knew who I was, and he sought to extract from me an order for a large sum of money lying in a European bank in the City of Mexico. There are various ways of procuring such orders, and he tried one of the most primitive methods. That is why I cannot walk without help. No, I will not tell what was done. It is not pleasant to hear. Let it pass. I shall walk again as well as ever in a month.\"  \"Did he get the order?\" asked Obed curiously.  Roylston laughed deep in his throat.  \"He did not,\" he said. \"It was not because I valued it so much, but my pride would not permit me to give way to such crude methods. I must say, however, that you three came just in time, and you have done a most marvelous piece of work.\"  Ned shuddered and walked a little space out on the plain to steady his nerves. He had never deceived himself about the dangers that the Texans were facing, but it seemed that they would have to fight every kind of ferocity. When he returned, Obed and the Panther were building the fire higher.  \"We must get everybody good and dry,\" said the Panther. \"Pursuit will come, but not to-night, an' we needn't worry about the blaze. We've food enough for all of you for a day, but we haven't the horses, an' for that I'm sorry. If we had them we could git away without a doubt to the Texan army.\"  \"But not having them,\" said Obed, \"we'll even do the best we can, if the Mexicans, having run away, come back to fight another day.\"  \"So we will,\" said a stalwart Texan named Fields. \"That Urrea don't get me again, and if I ain't mistook your friend here is Mr. Palmer, better known in our parts as the Ring Tailed Panther, ain't he?\"  Ned saw the Panther's huge form swell. He still wore the great serape, which shone in the firelight with a deep blood-red tinge.  \"I am the Ring Tailed Panther,\" he said proudly.  \"Then lemme shake your hand. You an' your pards have done a job to-night that ain't had its like often, and me bein' one of them that's profited by it makes it look all the bigger to me.\"  The Panther graciously extended an enormous palm, and the great palm of Fields met it in a giant clasp. A smile lighted up the somber face of Mr. Roylston as he looked at them.  \"Often we find powerful friends when we least expect them,\" he said.  \"As you are the worst hurt of the lot,\" said the Panther, \"we're going to make you a bed right here by the fire. No, it ain't any use sayin' you won't lay down on it. If you won't we'll jest have to put you down.\"  They spread a blanket, upon which the exhausted merchant lay, and they covered him with a serape. Soon he fell asleep, and then Fields said to Ned and his comrades:  \"You fellows have done all the work, an' you've piled up such a mountain of debt against us that we can never wipe it out. Now you go to sleep and four of us will watch. And, knowin' what would happen to us if we were caught, we'll watch well. But nothing is to be expected to-night.\"  \"Suits us,\" said Obed. \"Some must watch while others sleep, so runs the world away. Bet you a dollar, Ned, that I'm off to Slumberland before you are.\"  \"I don't take the bet,\" said Ned, \"but I'll run you an even race.\"  In exactly five minutes the two, rolled in their own blankets, slept soundly. All the others soon followed, except four, who, unlike the Mexicans, kept a watch that missed nothing.     CHAPTER III  THE FIGHT WITH URREA   Morning came. Up rose the sun, pouring a brilliant light over the desolate plains. Beads of water from the rain the night before sparkled a little while and then dried up. But the day was cold, nevertheless, and a sharp wind now began to search for the weakest point of every one. Ned, Obed and the Panther were up betimes, but some of the rescued still slept.  Ned, at the suggestion of the Panther, mounted one of the horses and rode out on the plain a half mile to the south. Those keen eyes of his were becoming all the keener from life upon the vast rolling plains. But no matter how he searched the horizon he saw only a lonesome cactus or two shivering in the wind. When he returned with his report the redoubtable Panther said:  \"Then we'll just take our time. The pursuit's goin' to come, but since it ain't in sight"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15767"],["title","The Texan Scouts: A Story of the Alamo and Goliad (#6)"],["body","e'll brace up these new friends of ours with hot coffee an' vittles. I guess we've got coffee enough left for all.\"  They lighted the fire anew and soon pleasant odors arose. The rescued prisoners ate and drank hungrily, and Mr. Roylston was able to limp a little. Now that Ned saw him in the full daylight he understood more clearly than ever that this was indeed a most uncommon man. The brow and eyes belonged to one who thought, planned and organized. He spoke little and made no complaint, but when he looked at Ned he said:  \"You are young, my boy, to live among such dangers. Why do you not go north into the states where life is safe?\"  \"There are others as young as I, or younger, who have fought or will fight for Texas,\" said Ned. \"I belong here and I've got powerful friends. Two of them have saved my life more than once and are likely to do so again.\"  He nodded toward Obed and the Panther, who were too far away to hear. Roylston smiled. The two men were in singular contrast, but each was striking in his way. Obed, of great height and very thin, but exceedingly strong, was like a steel lath. The Panther, huge in every aspect, reminded one, in his size and strength, of a buffalo bull.  \"They are uncommon men, no doubt,\" said Roylston. \"And you expect to remain with them?\"  \"I'd never leave them while this war lasts! Not under any circumstances!\"  Ned spoke with great energy, and again Roylston smiled, but he said no more.  \"It's time to start,\" said the Panther.  Roylston again mounted one of the horses. Ned saw that it hurt his pride to have to ride, but he saw also that he would not complain when complaints availed nothing. He felt an increasing interest in a man who seemed to have perfect command over himself.  The boy, Will Allen, was fresh and strong again. His youthful frame had recovered completely from all hardships, and now that he was free, armed, and in the company of true friends his face glowed with pleasure and enthusiasm. He was tall and strong, and now he carried a good rifle with a pistol also in his belt. He and Ned walked side by side, and each rejoiced in the companionship of one of his own age.  \"How long have you been with them?\" asked Will, looking at Obed and the Panther.  \"I was first with Obed away down in Mexico. We were prisoners together in the submarine dungeon of San Juan de Ulua. I'd never have escaped without him. And I'd never have escaped a lot more things without him, either. Then we met the Panther. He's the greatest frontiersman in all the southwest, and we three somehow have become hooked together.\"  Will looked at Ned a little enviously.  \"What comrades you three must be!\" he said. \"I have nobody.\"  \"Are you going to fight for Texas?\"  \"I count on doing so.\"  \"Then why don't you join us, and we three will turn into four?\"  Will looked at Ned, and his eyes glistened.  \"Do you mean that?\" he asked.  \"Do I mean it? I think I do. Ho, there, Panther! You and Obed, just a minute or two!\"  The two turned back. Ned and Will were walking at the rear of the little company.  \"I've asked Will to be one of us,\" said Ned, \"to join our band and to share our fortunes, good or bad.\"  \"Can he make all the signs, an' has he rid the goat?\" asked the Panther solemnly.  \"Does he hereby swear never to tell any secret of ours to Mexican or Indian?\" asked Obed. \"Does he swear to obey all our laws and by-laws wherever he may be, and whenever he is put to the test?\"  \"He swears to everything,\" replied Ned, \"and I know that he is the kind to make a trusty comrade to the death.\"  \"Then you are declared this minute a member of our company in good standin',\" said the Panther to Will, \"an' with this grip I give you welcome.\"  He crushed the boy's hand in a mighty grasp that made him wince, and Obed followed with one that was almost equally severe. But the boy did not mind the physical pain. Instead, his soul was uplifted. He was now the chosen comrade of these three paladins, and he was no longer alone in the world. But he merely said:  \"I'll try to show myself worthy.\"  They were compelled to stop at noon for rather a long rest, as walking was tiresome. Fields, who was a good scout, went back and looked for pursuers, but announced that he saw none, and, after an hour, they started again.  \"I'm thinkin',\" said the Panther, \"that Urrea has already organized the pursuit. Mebbe he has pow'ful glasses an' kin see us when we can't see him. He may mean to attack to-night. It's a lucky thing for us that we can find timber now an' then.\"  \"It's likely that you're right about to-night,\" said Obed, \"but there's no night so dark that it doesn't have its silver lining. I guess everybody in this little crowd is a good shot, unless maybe it's Mr. Roylston, and as we have about three guns apiece we can make it mighty hot for any force that Urrea may bring against us.\"  They began now to search for timber, looking especially for some clump of trees that also inclosed water. They did not anticipate any great difficulty in regard to the water, as the winter season and the heavy rains had filled the dry creek beds, and had sent torrents down the arroyos. Before dark they found a stream about a foot deep running over sand between banks seven or eight feet high toward the Rio Grande. A mile further on a small grove of myrtle oaks and pecans grew on its left bank, and there they made their camp.  Feeling that they must rely upon their valor and watchfulness, and not upon secrecy, they built a fire, and ate a good supper. Then they put out the fire and half of them remained on guard, the other half going to sleep, except Roylston, who sat with his back to a tree, his injured legs resting upon a bed of leaves which the boys had raked up for him. He had been riding Old Jack and the horse had seemed to take to him, but after the stop Ned himself had looked after his mount.  The boy allowed Old Jack to graze a while, and then he tethered him in the thickest of the woods just behind the sleeping man. He wished the horse to be as safe as possible in case bullets should be flying, and he could find no better place for him. But before going he stroked his nose and whispered in his ear.  \"Good Old Jack! Brave fellow!\" he said. \"We are going to have troublous times, you and I, along with the others, but I think we are going to ride through them safely.\"  The horse whinnied ever so softly, and nuzzled Ned's arm. The understanding between them was complete. Then Ned left him, intending to take a position by the bank of the creek as he was on the early watch. On the way he passed Roylston, who regarded him attentively.  \"I judge that your leader, Mr. Palmer, whom you generally call the Panther, is expecting an attack,\" said the merchant.  \"He's the kind of man who tries to provide for everything,\" replied Ned.  \"Of course, then,\" said Roylston, \"he provides for the creek bed. The Mexican skirmishers can come up it and yet be protected by its banks.\"  \"That is so,\" said the Panther, who had approached as he was speaking. \"It's the one place that we've got to watch most, an' Ned an' me are goin' to sit there on the banks, always lookin'. I see that you've got the eye of a general, Mr. Roylston.\"  The merchant smiled.  \"I'm afraid I don't count for much in battle,\" he said, \"and least of all hampered as I am now. But if the worst comes to the worst I can sit here with my back to this tree and shoot. If you will kindly give me a rifle and ammunition I shall be ready for the emergency.\"  \"But it is your time to sleep, Mr. Roylston,\" said the Panther.  \"I don't think I can sleep, and as I cannot I might as well be of use.\"  The Panther brought him the rifle, powder and bullets, and Roylston, leaning against the tree, rifle across his knees, watched with bright eyes. Sentinels were placed at the edge of the grove, but the Panther and Ned, as arranged, were on the high bank overlooking the bed of the creek. Now and then they walked back and forth, meeting at intervals, but most of the time each kept to his own particular part of the ground.  Ned found an oak, blown down on the bank by some hurricane, and as there was a comfortable seat on a bough with the trunk as a rest for his back he remained there a long time. But his ease did not cause him to relax his vigilance. He was looking toward the north, and he could see two hundred yards or more up the creek bed to a point where it curved. The bed itself was about thirty feet wide, although the water did not have a width of more than ten feet.  Everything was now quite dry, as the wind had been blowing all day. But the breeze had died with the night, and the camp was so still that Ned could hear the faint trickle of the water over the sand. It was a fair night, with a cold moon and cold stars looking down. The air was full of chill, and Ned began to walk up and down again in order to keep warm. He noticed Roylston still sitting with eyes wide open and the rifle across his lap.  As Ned came near in his walk the merchant turned his bright eyes upon him.  \"I hear,\" he said, \"that you have seen Santa Anna.\"  \"More than once. Several times when I was a prisoner in Mexico, and again when I was recaptured.\"  \"What do you think of him?\"  The gaze of the bright eyes fixed upon Ned became intense and concentrated.  \"A great man! A wickedly great man!\"  Roylston turned his look away, and interlaced his fingers thoughtfully.  \"A good description, I think,\" he said. \"You have chosen your words well. A singular compound is this Mexican, a mixture of greatness, vanity and evil. I may talk to you more of him some day. But I tell you now that I am particularly desirous of not being carried a prisoner to him.\"  He lifted the rifle, put its stock to his shoulder, and drew a bead.  \"I think I could hit at forty or fifty yards in this good moonlight,\" he said.  He replaced the rifle across his knees and sighed. Ned was curious, but he would not ask questions, and he walked back to his old position by the bank. Here"]]]
