The latter, undisturbed by John's feelings, did not give a thought to him, but reflected with a touch of pain that this must be his last Latin recitation in school for a long time to come.    CHAPTER IX. THE LAST EVENING AT HOME  Three weeks passed quickly. October had already reached its middle point. The glory of the Indian summer was close at hand. Too quickly the days fled for the little family at the farm, for they knew that each brought nearer the parting of which they could not bear to think.  Jacob Carter, who had been sent for to do the heavy work on the farm, had arrived. He was a man of forty, stout and able to work, but had enjoyed few opportunities of cultivating his mind. Though a faithful laborer, he was destitute of the energy and ambition which might ere this have placed him in charge of a farm of his own. In New England few arrive at his age without achieving some position more desirable and independent than that of farm laborer. However, he looked pleasant and good-natured, and Mr. Frost accounted himself fortunate in securing his services.  The harvest had been got in, and during the winter months there would not be so much to do as before. Jacob, therefore, “hired out” for a smaller compensation, to be increased when the spring work came in.  Frank had not been idle. He had accompanied his father about the farm, and received as much practical instruction in the art of farming as the time would admit. He was naturally a quick learner, and now felt impelled by a double motive to prepare himself as well as possible to assume his new responsibilities. His first motive was, of course, to make up his father's loss to the family, as far as it was possible for him to do so, but he was also desirous of showing Mrs. Roxana Mason and other ill-boding prophets that they had underrated his abilities.  The time came when Mr. Frost felt that he must leave his family. He had enlisted from preference in an old regiment, already in Virginia, some members of which had gone from Rossville. A number of recruits were to be forwarded to the camp on a certain day, and that day was now close at hand.  Let me introduce the reader to the farmhouse on the last evening for many months when they would be able to be together. They were all assembled about the fireplace. Mr. Frost sat in an armchair, holding Charlie in his lap--the privileged place of the youngest. Alice, with the air of a young woman, sat demurely by her father's side on a cricket, while Maggie stood beside him, with one hand resting on his knee. Frank sat quietly beside his mother, as if already occupying the place which he was in future to hold as her counselor and protector.  Frank and his mother looked sober. They had not realized fully until this evening what it would be to part with the husband and father--how constantly they would miss him at the family meal and in the evening circle. Then there was the dreadful uncertainty of war. He might never return, or, if spared for that, it might be with broken constitution or the loss of a limb.  “If it hadn't been for me,” Frank could not help thinking, “father would not now be going away. He would have stayed at home, and I could still go to school. It would have made a great difference to us, and the loss of one man could not affect the general result.”  A moment after his conscience rebuked him for harboring so selfish a thought.  “The country needs him more even than we do,” he said to himself. “It will be a hard trial to have him go, but it is our duty.”  “Will my little Charlie miss me when I am gone?” asked Mr. Frost of the chubby-faced boy who sat with great, round eyes peering into the fire, as if he were deeply engaged in thought.  “Won't you take me with you, papa?” asked Charlie.  “What could you do if you were out there, my little boy?” asked the father, smiling.  “I'd shoot great big rebel with my gun,” said Charlie, waxing valiant.  “Your gun's only a wooden one,” said Maggie, with an air of superior knowledge. “You couldn't kill a rebel with that.”  “I'd kill 'em some,” persisted Charlie earnestly, evidently believing that a wooden gun differed from others not in kind, but in degree.  “But suppose the rebels should fire at you,” said Frank, amused. “What would you do then, Charlie?”  Charlie looked into the fire thoughtfully for a moment, as if this contingency had not presented itself to his mind until now. Suddenly his face brightened up, and he answered. “I'd run away just as fast as I could.”  All laughed at this, and Frank said: “But that wouldn't be acting like a brave soldier, Charlie. You ought to stay and make the enemy run.”  “I wouldn't want to stay and be shooted,” said Charlie ingenuously.  “There are many older than Charlie,” said Mr. Frost, smiling, “who would doubtless sympathize entirely with him in his objection to being shooted, though they might not be quite so ready to make confession as he has shown himself. I suppose you have heard the couplet:            “'He who fights and runs away                May live to fight another day.'”   “Pray don't speak about shooting,” said Mrs. Frost, with a shudder. “It makes me feel nervous.”  “And to-night we should only admit pleasant thoughts,” said her husband. “Who is going to write me letters when I am gone?”  “I'll write to you, father,” said Alice.  “And so will I,” said Maggie.  “I, too,” chimed in Charlie.  “Then, if you have so many correspondents already engaged, you will hardly want to hear from Frank and myself,” said his wife, smiling.  “The more the better. I suspect I shall find letters more welcome than anything else. You must also send me papers regularly. I shall have many hours that will pass heavily unless I have something to read.”  “I'll mail you Harper's Weekly regularly, shall I, father?” asked Frank.  “Yes, I shall be glad enough to see it. Then, there is one good thing about papers--after enjoying them myself, I can pass them round to others. There are many privations that I must make up my mind to, but I shall endeavor to make camp-life as pleasant as possible to myself and others.”  “I wish you were going out as an officer,” said Mrs. Frost. “You would have more indulgences.”  “Very probably I should. But I don't feel inclined to wish myself better off than others. I am: willing to serve my country in any capacity in which I can be of use. Thank Heaven, I am pretty strong and healthy, and better fitted than many to encounter the fatigues and exposures which are the lot of the private.”  “How early must you start to-morrow, father?” inquired Frank.  “By daylight. I must be in Boston by nine o'clock, and you know it is a five-mile ride to the depot. I shall want you to carry me over.”  “Will there be room for me?” asked Mrs. Frost. “I want to see the last of you.”  “I hope you won't do that for a long time to come,” said Mr. Frost, smiling.  “You know what I mean, Henry.”  “Oh, yes, there will be room. At any rate, we will make room for you. And now it seems to me it is time for these little folks to go to bed. Charlie finds it hard work to keep his eyes open.”  “Oh, papa, papa, not yet, not yet,” pleaded the children; and with the thought that it might be many a long day before he saw their sweet young faces again, the father suffered them to have their way.  After the children had gone to bed Frank and his father and mother sat up for a long time. Each felt that there was much to be said, but no one of them felt like saying much then. Thoughts of the approaching separation swallowed up all others. The thought kept recurring that to-morrow would see them many miles apart, and that many a long to-morrow must pass before they would again be gathered around the fire.  “Frank,” said his father, at length, “I have deposited in the Brandon Bank four hundred dollars, about half of which I have realized from crops sold this season. This you will draw upon as you have need, for grocery bills, to pay Jacob, etc. For present purposes I will hand you fifty dollars, which I advise you to put under your mother's care.”  As he finished speaking, Mr. Frost drew from his pocketbook a roll of bills and handed them to Frank.  Frank opened his portemonnaie and deposited the money therein.  He had never before so large a sum of money in his possession, and although he knew it was not to be spent for his own benefit--at least, no considerable part of it--he felt a sense of importance and even wealth in being the custodian of so much money. He felt that his father had confidence in him, and that he was in truth going to be his representative.  “A part of the money which I have in the bank,” continued his father, “has been saved up toward the payment of the mortgage on the farm.”  “When does it come due, father?”  “On the first of July of next year.”  “But you won't be prepared to meet it at that time?”  “No, but undoubtedly Squire Haynes will be willing to renew it. I always pay the interest promptly, and he knows it is secured by the farm, and therefore a safe investment. By the way, I had nearly forgotten to say that there will be some interest due on the first of January. Of course, you are authorized to pay it just as if you were myself.”  “How much will it be?”  “Twenty-four dollars--that is, six months' interest at six per cent. on eight hundred dollars.”  “I wish the farm were free from encumbrance,” said Frank.  “So do I; and if Providence favors me it shall be before many years are past. But in farming one can't expect to lay by money quite as fast as in some other employments.”  The old clock in the corner here struck eleven.  “We mustn't keep you up too late the last night, Henry,” said Mrs. Frost. “You will need a good night's sleep to carry you through to-morrow.”  Neither of the three closed their eyes early that night. Thoughts of the morrow were naturally in their minds. At last all was still.

CHAPTER X. LITTLE POMP  There was a hurried good-by at the depot.  “Kiss the children for me, Mary,” said her husband.  “You will write very soon?” pleaded Mrs. Frost.  “At the very first opportunity.”  “All aboard!” shouted the conductor.  With a shrill scream the locomotive started.  Frank and his mother stood on the platform watching the receding train till it was quite out of sight, and then in silence our young hero assisted his mother into the carryall and turned the horse's head homeward.  It was one of those quiet October mornings, when the air is soft and balmy as if a June day had found its way by mistake into the heart of autumn. The road wound partly through the woods. The leaves were still green and abundant. Only one or two showed signs of the coming change, which in the course of a few weeks must leave them bare and leafless.  “What a beautiful day!” said Frank, speaking the words almost unconsciously.  “Beautiful indeed!” responded his mother. “On such a day as this the world seems too lovely for war and warlike passions to be permitted to enter it. When men might be so happy, why need they stain their hands with each other's blood?”  Frank was unprepared for an answer. He knew that it was his father's departure which led his mother to speak thus. He wished to divert her mind, if possible.  Circumstances favored his design.  They had accomplished perhaps three-quarters of the distance home when, as they were passing a small one-story building by the roadside, a shriek of pain was heard, and a little black boy came running out of the house, screaming in affright: “Mammy's done killed herself. She's mos' dead!”  He ran out to the road and looked up at Mrs. Frost, as if to implore assistance.  “That's Chloe's child,” said Mrs. Frost. “Stop the horse, Frank; I'll get out and see what has happened.”  Chloe, as Frank very well knew, was a colored woman, who until a few months since had been a slave in Virginia. Finally she had seized a favorable opportunity, and taking the only child which the cruel slave system had left her, for the rest had been sold South, succeeded in making her way into Pennsylvania. Chance had directed her to Rossville, where she had been permitted to occupy, rent free, an old shanty which for some years previous had been uninhabited. Here she had supported herself by taking in washing and ironing. This had been her special work on the plantation where she had been born and brought up, and she was therefore quite proficient in it. She found no difficulty in obtaining work enough to satisfy the moderate wants of herself and little Pomp.  The latter was a bright little fellow, as black as the ace of spades, and possessing to the full the mercurial temperament of the Southern negro. Full of fun and drollery, he attracted plenty of attention when he came into the village, and earned many a penny from the boys by his plantation songs and dances.  Now, however, he appeared in a mood entirely different, and it was easy to see that he was much frightened.  “What's the matter, Pomp?” asked Frank, as he brought his horse to a standstill.  “Mammy done killed herself,” he repeated, wringing his hands in terror.  A moan from the interior of the house seemed to make it clear that something had happened.  Mrs. Frost pushed the door open and entered.  Chloe had sunk down on the floor and was rocking back and forth, holding her right foot in both hands, with an expression of acute pain on her sable face. Beside her was a small pail, bottom upward.  Mrs. Frost was at no loss to conjecture the nature of the accident which had befallen her. The pail had contained hot water, and its accidental overturn had scalded poor Chloe.  “Are you much hurt, Chloe?” asked Mrs. Frost sympathizingly.  “Oh, missus, I's most dead,” was the reply, accompanied by a groan. “'Spect I sha'n't live till mornin'. Dunno what'll become of poor Pomp when I'se gone.”  Little Pomp squeezed his knuckles into his eyes and responded with an unearthly howl.  “Don't be too much frightened, Chloe,” said Mrs. Frost soothingly. “You'll get over it sooner than you think. How did the pail happen to turn over?”  “Must have been de debbel, missus. I was kerryin' it just as keerful, when all at once it upsot.”  This explanation, though not very luminous to her visitor, appeared to excite a fierce spirit of resentment against the pail in the mind of little Pomp.  He suddenly rushed forward impetuously and kicked the pail with all the force he could muster.  But, alas for poor Pomp! His feet were unprotected by shoes, and the sudden blow hurt him much more than the pail. The consequence was a howl of the most distressing nature.  Frank had started forward to rescue Pomp from the consequences of his precipitancy, but too late. He picked up the little fellow and, carrying him out, strove to soothe him.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Frost examined Chloe's injuries. They were not so great as she had anticipated. She learned on inquiry that the water had not been scalding hot. There was little doubt that with proper care she would recover from her injuries in a week or ten days. But in the meantime it would not do to use the foot.  “What shall I do, missus?” groaned Chloe. “I ain't got nothin' baked up. 'Pears like me and Pomp must starve.”  “Not so bad as that, Chloe,” said Mrs. Frost, with a reassuring smile. “After we have you on the bed we will take Pomp home with us, and give him enough food to last you both a couple of days. At the end of that time, or sooner, if you get out, you can send him up again.”  Chloe expressed her gratitude warmly, and Mrs. Frost, calling in Frank's assistance, helped the poor woman to a comfortable position on the bed, which fortunately was in the corner of the same room. Had it been upstairs, the removal would have been attended with considerable difficulty as well as pain to Chloe.  Pomp, the acuteness of whose pain had subsided, looked on with wondering eyes while Frank and Mrs. Frost “toted” his mother onto the bed, as he expressed it.  Chloe accepted, with wondering gratitude, the personal attentions of Mrs. Frost, who bound up the injured foot with a softness of touch which brought no pain to the sufferer.  “You ain't too proud, missus, to tend to a poor black woman,” she said. “Down Souf dey used to tell us dat everybody looked down on de poor nigger and lef' 'em to starve an' die if dey grow sick.”  “They told you a great many things that were not true, Chloe,” said Mrs. Frost quietly. “The color of the skin ought to make no difference where we have it in our power to render kind offices.”  “Do you believe niggers go to de same heaven wid w'ite folks, missus?”  asked Chloe, after a pause.  “Why should they not? They were made by the same God.”  “I dunno, missus,” said Chloe. “I hopes you is right.”  “Do you think you can spare Pomp a little while to go home with us?”  “Yes, missus. Here you, Pomp,” she called, “you go home wid dis good lady, and she'll gib you something for your poor sick mudder. Do you hear?”  “I'se goin' to ride?” said Pomp inquiringly.  “Yes,” said Frank good-naturedly.  “Hi, hi, dat's prime!” ejaculated Pomp, turning a somersault in his joy.  “Scramble in, then, and we'll start.”  Pomp needed no second invitation. He jumped into the carriage, and was more leisurely followed by Frank and his mother.  It was probably the first time that Pomp had ever been in a covered carriage, and consequently the novelty of his situation put him in high spirits.  He was anxious to drive, and Frank, to gratify him, placed the reins in his hands. His eyes sparkling with delight, and his expanded mouth showing a full set of ivories, Pomp shook the reins in glee, shouting out, “Hi, go along there, you ol' debble!”  “Pomp, you mustn't use that word,” said Mrs. Frost reprovingly.  “What word, missus?” demanded Pomp innocently.  “The last word you used,” she answered.  “Don't 'member what word you mean, missus,” said Pomp. “Hi, you debble!”  “That's the word?”  “Not say 'debble'?” said Pomp wonderingly. “Why not, missus?”  “It isn't a good word.”  “Mammy says 'debble.' She calls me little debble when I run away, and don't tote in de wood.”  “I shall tell her not to use it. It isn't a good word for anybody to use.”  “Hope you'll tell her so, missus,” said Pomp, grinning and showing his teeth. “Wheneber she calls me little debble she pulls off her shoe and hits me. Hurts like de debble. Mebbe she won't hit me if you tell her not to say 'debble.'”  Mrs. Frost could hardly forbear laughing. She managed, however, to preserve a serious countenance while she said, “You must take care to behave well, and then she won't have to punish you.”  It is somewhat doubtful whether Pomp heard this last remark. He espied a pig walking by the side of the road, and was seized with a desire to run over it. Giving the reins a sudden twitch, he brought the carriage round so that it was very near upsetting in a gully.  Frank snatched the reins in time to prevent this catastrophe.  “What did you do that for, Pomp?” he said quickly.  “Wanted to scare de pig,” exclaimed Pomp, laughing. “Wanted to hear him squeal.”  “And so you nearly tipped us over.”  “Didn't mean to do dat, Mass' Frank. 'Pears like I didn't think.”  Mrs. Frost was too much alarmed by this narrow escape to consent to Pomp's driving again, and for the moment felt as if she should like to usurp his mother's privilege of spanking him. But the little imp looked so unconscious of having done anything wrong that her vexation soon passed away.  In half an hour Pomp was on his way back, laden with a basketful of provisions for his sick mother and himself.    CHAPTER XI. PUNISHING A BULLY  It was fortunate for Mrs. Frost that she was so soon called upon to think for others. It gave her less time to grieve over her husband's absence, which was naturally a severe trial to her. As for Frank,"]]]
