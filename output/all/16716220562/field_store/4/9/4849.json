The days up here were beautiful, but it was at night that this was a scene of surpassing loveliness.  Far below the lights of the city glowed like spangles in the darkness.  Above us was the star-encrusted sky.  It was like being suspended between a floor and a ceiling of glittering jewels.  On this plateau grew the biggest cherry trees I ever saw, and they bore the biggest and sweetest cherries, though I could not taste any at that time, as the season was past.  I heard the landlady complaining one day to some of her guests that the rascally birds had hardly left her a cherry to put up.  \"The saucy little thieves! they must have eaten bushels of the finest fruit,\" she said.  \"And didn't you get any?\" inquired a childish voice.  There was something familiar in the voice and I flew to the porch railing to see who it was.  And who should it be but dear little Marion.  And there too was her aunty, Miss Dorothy, and the professor, and in the parlor I caught a glimpse of Miss Katie and the colonel.  They were having a pleasant vacation together.  Marion looked inquiringly into the landlady's face.  No doubt she was thinking the mountain birds were very greedy to eat up all the cherries and not leave one for the poor woman to can.  \"Our birds always eat some of our cherries too,\" she said, \"but they always leave us plenty.\"  \"There were bushels left on our trees,\" observed the landlady's daughter.  \"We had all we wanted, mother.  We couldn't possibly have used the rest if the birds had not eaten them.  We had a cellar full of canned cherries left over from the year before, you remember, and that is the way it is nearly every year.\"  \"Yes, yes, I know,\" answered her mother impatiently; \"but for all that I don't believe in letting the birds have everything.\"  \"I never begrudge a bird what it eats,\" commented the professor.  \"Of course you can discourage the birds, drive them off, break up their nests, starve them out, and have a crop of caterpillars instead of cherries.  But, beg pardon, madam, maybe you don't object to caterpillars,\" and he bowed low to the landlady.  The laugh was against her and I was glad of it, for I didn't consider it either kind or polite to call us \"saucy little thieves.\"  We were amused one morning when, flying over a piece of pretty country, we saw a lady moving rapidly along on the red sandy path below.  She seemed to be neither exactly riding nor walking, as she was not on foot nor had she a horse.  On closer inspection it was seen that she was propelling a strange-looking vehicle.  Two of her carriage wheels were gone, and between the remaining two the lady was perched.  At sight of it I was immediately reminded of the queer thing that Johnny Morris rode which the admiral had described to us and called a \"wheel.\"  I felt sure that this was the same kind of a machine.  The lady looked neither to the right nor to the left, but her glance was fixed intently on the road before her.  Farther along another lady leaned against the fence awaiting her approach.  As she bowled along the friend asked enthusiastically: \"Is it not splendid?\"  The rider called back to her: \"It is grand!  It is almost as if I were flying.  I know now how a bird feels.\"  Think of comparing the sensation produced by moving that heavy iron machine, with the rider but three feet from the ground, to the exhilaration felt by a bird spurning the earth and soaring on delicate wing through the fields of heaven!  It was truly laughable!  Our amusement was cut short, however, when we noticed that the lady's hat was decorated with a dead dove.  \"Can we never get away from this millinery exhibition of death?\" I exclaimed in horror.  \"No,\" said my mother sorrowfully.  \"The god, Fashion, I told you of has his slaves all over the land.  We will find them wherever we go, north, south, east, and west.  No town is too small, no neighborhood too remote, but there will be found women ready to carry out his cruel laws.\"  Had we not been haunted by this vision of death which we were constantly meeting wherever women were congregated, we might have been happy in the fair land of rose blossoms and magnolias where we now sojourned.  The air was soft and balmy, and the atmosphere filled us with a serene, restful languor quite new to those who had been accustomed to the brisker habits of a colder clime.  Besides the birds there were many human visitors from the North spending the winter months here.  Some sought this warmer climate for their health, others for pleasure, and these also soon fell into the easy-going, happy-go-lucky ways induced by the sluggish climate.  Among the birds the waxwings most readily acquired this delightful Southern habit of taking life easy.  In fact the waxwings are inclined to be lazy, except when they are nesting; they are the most deliberate creatures one can find, but very foppish and neat in their dress. Never will you find a particle of dust on their silky plumage, and the pretty red dots on their wings and tails look always as bright as if kept in a bandbox.  They have, indeed, just reason to be proud of themselves, for they are very beautiful.  Hunters by scores were after them with bag and gun mercilessly killing them for the New York millinery houses.  The slaughter was terrible, and made more easy for the hunters by reason of the poor birds flocking together so closely in such large numbers when they alighted in circles as is their habit.  As they came down in dense droves to get their food, the red dots on their wing tips almost overlapping those of their fellows, dozens were slain by a single shot.  They were very fond of the berries of the cedar trees, and after the other foods were gone they hovered there in great numbers.  Here too, the hunters followed them and made awful havoc in their ranks.  One man made the cruel boast that the winter previous he had killed one thousand cedar-birds for hat trimmings.  Many of our family had located for a time near the coast, but here too, on these sunny plains, the death messengers followed us and slew us by the thousands.  We learned that one bird man handled thirty thousand bird skins that season.  Another firm shipped seventy thousand to the city, and still the market called for more and yet more.  The appetite of the god could not be appeased.  I am sure this account of the loss of bird life must have seemed appalling to my mother, for I heard her moan sadly when it was talked about.  It was during my stay in the Southern islands that I first saw the white egret, whose beautiful sweeping plumes, like the silken train of a court lady, have so long been the spoils of woman, that the bird is almost extinct.  As these magnificent feathers appear upon the bird only through the mating and nesting season, the cruelty of the act is still more dastardly.  The attachment of the parent birds for their young is very beautiful to witness, yet this devotion, which should be their safeguard, is seized upon for their destruction, for so great is the instinct of protecting love they refuse to leave their young when danger is near, and are absolutely indifferent to their own safety.  Never shall I forget one sad incident which occurred while I was there. Overhanging the water was an ancestral nest belonging to a family of egrets which had occupied it for some seasons.  Unlike the American human species, in whom local attachment is not largely developed, and who take a new house every moving day, the egret repairs and fixes over the old house year after year, putting in a new brace there, adding another stick here, to make it firm enough to bear the weight of the mother and the three young birds which always comprise the brood.  The three pale-blue eggs in this nest had been duly hatched, and the fond mother was now brooding over her darlings with every demonstration of maternal affection.  She was a beautiful creature with her graceful movement, her train of plumes, and her long neck gracefully curved.  The quick sharp boom, boom of the guns had been echoing through the swamp for some time, and the men were now coming nearer.  The efforts of the poor mother to shield her babies were piteous, but the hunters did not want them.  Their scant plumage is worthless for millinery purposes.  Possibly the mother might have escaped had she been willing to leave her dear ones; but she would not desert them, and was shot in the breast as the reward of her devotion.  The nestlings were left to starve.  Would you think the woman who wore that bunch of feathers on her bonnet could take much pleasure in it?     CHAPTER VIII  THE PRISON    Like a long-caged bird   Thou beat'st thy bars with broken wing   And flutterest, feebly echoing   The far-off music thou hast heard,           --_Arthur Eaton._   This was my last day of liberty for many, many months.  The very next evening I was stunned by a stone thrown by a small boy who accompanied a hunter.  Picking me up he ran toward his father, who was coming back from the neighboring swamp with his loaded gamebag.  \"This bird isn't dead,\" said the boy, holding me up to view, \"and I'm going to put it in a cage and train it to talk.\"  \"Crows are the kind that talk.  That's no crow nor no starling neither,\" answered the man.  \"Better give it to me to kill.  I'll pay you a penny for it.\"  \"Naw, you don't,\" and the boy drew back, at the same time closing his hand over me so tightly that I feared I would be crushed.  \"I'm going to keep him, I tell ye.  He's mine to do what I please with, and I ain't agoing to sell him for a penny, neither.\"  So saying he ran along in front of his father till we reached the mule cart.  Into this clumsy vehicle they climbed and soon we were jogging over the sandy road to their home.  As we drove along the man computed, partly to himself, partly aloud, how much money the contents of his game-bag would bring him.  The result must have been satisfactory, for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16259"],["title","The Surprising Adventures of the Magical Monarch of Mo and His People (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

FRANK BAUM  With pictures by Frank Ver Beck  1903        To the Comrade of my boyhood days Dr. Henry Clay Baum    TO THE READER  This book has been written for children. I have no shame in acknowledging that I, who wrote it, am also a child; for since I can remember my eyes have always grown big at tales of the marvelous, and my heart is still accustomed to go pit-a-pat when I read of impossible adventures. It is the nature of children to scorn realities, which crowd into their lives all too quickly with advancing years. Childhood is the time for fables, for dreams, for joy.  These stories are not true; they could no be true and be so marvelous. No one is expected to believe them; they were meant to excite laughter and to gladden the heart.  Perhaps some of those big, grown-up people will poke fun of us--at you for reading these nonsense tales of the Magical Monarch, and at me for writing them. Never mind. Many of the big folk are still children--even as you and I. We cannot measure a child by a standard of size or age. The big folk who are children will be our comrades; the others we need not consider at all, for they are self-exiled from our domain.               L. FRANK BAUM.  June, 1903.

First: Who is the Monarch of Mo? And why is he called the Magical Monarch? And where _is_ Mo, anyhow? And why have you never heard of it before? And can it be reached by a railroad or a trolley-car, or must one walk all the way?  These questions I realize should be answered before we (that \"we\" means you and the book) can settle down for a comfortable reading of all the wonders and astonishing adventures I shall endeavor faithfully to relate.  In the first place, the Monarch of Mo is a very pleasant personage holding the rank of King. He is not very tall, nor is he very short; he is midway between fat and lean; he is delightfully jolly when he is not sad, and seldom sad if he can possibly be jolly. How old he may be I have never dared to inquire; but when we realize that he is destined to live as long as the Valley of Mo exists we may reasonably suppose the Monarch of Mo is exactly as old as his native land. And no one in Mo has ever reckoned up the years to see how many they have been. So we will just say that the Monarch of Mo and the Valley of Mo are each a part of the other, and can not be separated.  He is not called the Magical Monarch because he deals in magic--for he doesn't deal in magic. But he leads such a queer life in such a queer country that his history will surely seem magical to us who inhabit the civilized places of the world and think that anything we can not find a reason for must be due to magic. The life of the Monarch of Mo seems simple enough to him, you may be sure, for he knows no other existence. And our ways of living, could he know of them, would doubtless astonish him greatly.  The land of Mo, which is ruled by the King we call the Magical Monarch, is often spoken of as the \"Beautiful Valley.\" If they would only put it on the maps of our geographies and paint it pink or light green, and print a big round dot where the King's castle stands, it would be easy enough to point out to you its exact location. But I can not find the Valley of Mo in any geography I have examined; so I suspect the men who made these instructive books really know nothing about Mo, else it would surely be on the maps.  Of one thing I am certain: that no other country included in the maps is so altogether delightful as the Beautiful Valley of Mo.  The sun shines all the time, and its rays are perfumed. The people who live in the Valley do not sleep, because there is no night. Everything they can possibly need grows on the trees, so they have no use for money at all, and that saves them a deal of worry.  There are no poor people in this quaint Valley. When a person desires a new hat he waits till one is ripe, and then picks it and wears it without asking anybody's permission. If a lady wishes a new ring, she examines carefully those upon the ring-tree, and when she finds one that fits her finger she picks it and wears it upon her hand. In this way they procure all they desire.  There are two rivers in the Land of Mo, one of which flows milk of a very rich quality. Some of the islands in Milk River are made of excellent cheese, and the people are welcome to spade up this cheese whenever they wish to eat it. In the little pools near the bank, where the current does not flow swiftly, delicious cream rises to the top of the milk, and instead of water-lilies great strawberry leaves grow upon the surface, and the ripe, red berries lie dipping their noses into the cream, as if inviting you to come and eat them. The sand that forms the river bank is pure white sugar, and all kinds of candies and bonbons grow thick on the low bushes, so that any one may pluck them easily.  These are only a few of the remarkable things that exist in the Beautiful Valley.  The people are merry, light-hearted folk, who live in beautiful houses of pure crystal, where they can rest themselves and play their games and go in when it rains. For it rains in Mo as it does everywhere else, only it rains lemonade; and the lightning in the sky resembles the most beautiful fireworks; and the thunder is usually a chorus from the opera of Tannhauser.  No one ever dies in this Valley, and the people are always young and beautiful. There is the King and a Queen, besides several princes and princesses. But it is not much use being a prince in Mo, because the King can not die; therefore a prince is a prince to the end of his days, and his days never end.  Strange things occur in this strange land, as you may imagine; and while I relate some of these you will learn more of the peculiar features of the Beautiful Valley.    _The Second Surprise_  THE STRANGE ADVENTURES OF THE KING'S HEAD   A good many years ago, the Magical Monarch of Mo became annoyed by the Purple Dragon, which came down from the mountains and ate up a patch of his best chocolate caramels just as they were getting ripe.  So the King went out to the sword-tree and picked a long, sharp sword, and tied it to his belt and went away to the mountains to fight the Purple Dragon.  The people all applauded him, saying one to another:  \"Our King is a good King. He will destroy this naughty Purple Dragon and we shall be able to eat the caramels ourselves.\"  But the Dragon was not alone naughty; it was big, and fierce, and strong, and did not want to be destroyed at all.  Therefore the King had a terrible fight with the Purple Dragon and cut it with his sword in several places, so that the raspberry juice which ran in its veins squirted all over the ground.  It is always difficult to kill Dragons. They are by nature thick-skinned and tough, as doubtless every one has heard. Besides, you must not forget that this was a Purple Dragon, and all scientists who have studied deeply the character of Dragons say those of a purple color at the most disagreeable to fight with. So all the King's cutting and slashing had no effect upon the monster other than to make him angry. Forgetful of the respect due to a crowned King, the wicked Dragon presently opening wide its jaws and bit his Majesty's head clean off his body. Then he swallowed it.  Of course the King realized it was useless to continue to fight after that, for he could not see where the Dragon was. So he turned and tried to find his way back to his people. But at every other step he would bump into a tree, which made the naughty Dragon laugh at him. Furthermore, he could not tell in which direction he was going, which is an unpleasant feeling under any circumstances.  At last some of the people came to see if the King had succeeded in destroying the Dragon, and found their monarch running around in a circle, bumping into trees and rocks, but not getting a step nearer home. SO they took his hand and led him back to the palace, where every one was filled with sorrow at the sad sight of the headless King. Indeed, his devoted subjects, for the first time in their lives, came as near to weeping as an inhabitant of the Valley of Mo can.  \"Never mind,\" said the King, cheerfully; \"I can get along very well without a head; and, as a matter of fact, the loss has its advantages. I shall not be obliged to brush my hair, or clean my teeth, or wash my ears. So do not grieve, I beg of you, but be happy and joyful as you were before.\" Which showed the King had a good heart; and, after all, a good heart is better than a head, any say.  The people, hearing him speak out of his neck (for he had no mouth), immediately began to laugh, which in a short time led to their"]]]
