I know I shall always love the Wigwam best, and when I think of it standing empty or maybe turned over to strangers, it makes me feel as if one of my best friends had died. I'm glad we took so many pictures of it, and that I kept a record of all the good times we had there. Oh, that reminds me! There's one more thing I must do before sundown--bring my diary up to date. I haven't written a line in it for six weeks.\"  The out-doors was too alluring to waste another moment in the house, however, so gathering up her diary and fountain-pen, she went down stairs and out into the garden, feeling as the gate swung to behind her that she was stepping into an old, old English garden belonging to some ducal estate. Coming as she did straight from the edge of the desert, with its burning stretches of sand, its cactus and greasewood, its bare red buttes and lank rows of cotton-wood trees, this Eden of green and bloom had a double charm for her.  For a long time she wandered up and down its winding paths, finding many a shady pleasance hidden away among its labyrinths of hedges, where one might be tempted to stop and dream away a whole long summer afternoon. But she did not pause until she came to a sort of court surrounded by rustic arbours, where a fountain splashed in the centre, and an ancient sun-dial marked the hours. With a pleased cry of recognition she ran across the closely clipped turf, to read the motto carved on the dial's face: \"I only mark the hours that shine.\"  \"The very words that Betty wrote in my Good Times Book the day she gave it to me,\" she said, opening her diary to verify the motto on the fly-leaf.  \"It was beyond my wildest dreams then that I'd ever be standing here in Warwick Hall garden, reading them for myself! I mustn't wait another minute to make a record of this good time.\"  Choosing a seat in one of the arbours where a humming bird was darting in and out through a tangle of vines, she opened the thick red book in which she had kept a faithful record of her doings and goings for the last two years, and glanced at the last entry. The date was such an old one that she read the last few pages to refresh her memory.                                     \"THE WIGWAM, Thursday, August 4th.       \"Jack came home yesterday to our joyful surprise. Mr. Sherman had      telegraphed him to come at once to Kentucky, on a flying trip to      consult with the directors of the mine. As he had to pass through      Phoenix anyhow, he managed it so that he could stay over night      with us. I am so happy over the prospect of his having a chance at      last to see our 'Promised Land' that I am fairly beside myself. I      sat up half the night making cookies and gingerbread and rolls, and      broiling chickens for his lunch. He says he's been hungry for      home-cooking so long that it will go away ahead of dining-car fare.       \"Everything turned out beautifully, and while I waited for them to      bake I wrote a list of the things he must see and questions he must      ask at The Locusts; things I've wanted to know ever since I came      back from Lloydsboro Valley, and yet you can't very well find out      just in letters. He left on this morning's early train. If he finds      he can take the time, he's going on to Annapolis for a day, just to      get a glimpse of Holland, and then to New York for a day and a half      with Joyce. Good old Jack! He's certainly earned his holiday. I can      hardly wait for him to come home and tell all about it.\"   Spreading the book out on her knees, Mary adjusted her pen and began to write rapidly, for words always crowded to her pen-point as they did to her tongue, with a rush.                                     \"WARWICK HALL, September 12.       \"Little did I think when I wrote that last line, that six whole      weeks would pass before I added another, or that my next entry      would be made in this beautiful old garden that I have dreamed of      so long. Little did I think I would be sitting here beside the old      sun-dial, or that such an hour could shine for me as the happy hour      when Jack came back.       \"I drove into Phoenix to meet him, and I knew from the way he      waved his hat and swung off the steps before the train stopped that      he had good news, and it was! Perfectly splendid! They had made      him assistant manager of the mines, with a great big salary that      would make a change in all our fortunes. I thought it was queer      that he should bring a trunk back with him, for he went away with      only a suit-case, but I was so busy asking questions about Joyce      and Holland and everybody at The Locusts, that there wasn't time or      breath to ask about the trunk. We were half way home before he got      around to that.       \"He said his first thought when they told him of his promotion      was, 'Now Mary can have her heart's desire and go away to school.'      And on the way to New York he planned it all out, how we'd give up      the Wigwam, and take a house in Lone-Rock, and he'd get some one to      help Mamma with the work, and he'd have Norman under his eye all      the time when he was out of school, and keep him out of mischief.      He's been wanting to do that ever since he went to the mines, for      there never was such a home-body. He can't bear to board.       \"Nearly all of that little scrap of a visit he and Joyce had      together, those blessed children spent in getting my clothes. Joyce      has all my measurements, and they got me three dresses and a hat      and a lot of shirt-waists and gloves and fixings, all so beautiful      and stylish and New Yorkey, _and_ the fine big trunk to put them      in. There was even a new brush and comb and mirror, for she      remembered how ratty looking my old things were. And there was a      letter portfolio and a silk umbrella and a lot of odds and ends      that all school-girls need. I don't believe they overlooked a thing      to make my outfit complete, and I know they're as nice as any the      others will have, for Joyce has such good taste and always knows      just what is fit and proper. I feel so elegant in my pretty blue      travelling suit, and I'm just aching for a chance to wear the      beautiful little evening dresses they chose, one white pongee, and      the other some new sort of goods that looks just like a soft      shimmery cloud, a regular picture dress.       \"Jack went on to the mines next day, and after that everything was      in a whirl till we were moved and settled, for there was so much to      do, packing the furniture to be shipped, and after we got to the      new house unpacking again and shifting things around till it got      all liveable and homelike. By that time it was time for me to get      my things together and go down to Phoenix to meet the people who      had offered to take me under their wing on their way back East.      Judge and Mrs. Stockton brought me. I must remember the date of      Mrs. Stockton's birthday, November the fourth, and send her one of      those bead purses. She admired the one she saw me making so much      that I know she would like it, and she certainly was an angel to me      on the trip. It seems to me it's my luck to meet nice people      everywhere I go.       \"I'm not going to wait till the last Thursday in November for my      Thanksgiving Day. I've got seven good reasons for thanksgiving this      very minute. First, we got here without a wreck. Second, the ribbon      on my hat doesn't show a single spot, after all the hard shower      that we got caught in, that I thought had ruined it. Third, I      _think_ I impressed Hawkins as I hoped to, even if I was a bit      nervous. Fourth, while my introduction to Madam Chartley was      horribly mortifying, all's well that ends well, and she didn't lay      it up against me. I think she must have taken quite a fancy to me      instead or she wouldn't have given me my fifth and greatest reason      for thankfulness, the privilege of occupying Lloyd's old room.      Maybe I oughtn't to put that as the greatest reason, for of course      it's greater just to be here at all, and seventh, I'll never get      done being thankful that I've got Jack for a brother. That really      is the best of all, and I'm going to make so much out of my      opportunities this year, that he'll feel repaid for all he's done      for me, and be glad and proud that he could do it.\"  Filling another page with an account of her journey and her impressions of the place, Mary closed her journal with a sigh of relief that the long-neglected entry had been made. Then she leaned back on the rustic bench and gave herself up to the enjoyment of her surroundings. The fountain splashed softly. A lazy breeze stirred the vines, and fanned her face. Far below, the shining Potomac took its slow way to the sea between its lines of drooping willows. The calm and repose of the stately old place seemed to steal in on her soul not only through eye and ear and sense of touch, but at every pore.  \"It's the strangest thing,\" she mused. \"I must be a sort of chameleon, the way I change with my surroundings. It doesn't seem possible that only last week I was scrambling around with my head tied up in a towel, scrubbing and cleaning and dragging furniture around at a break-neck speed. I could almost believe I've never done anything all my life but trail around this garden at my elegant leisure like some fine lady-in-waiting.\"  There was time for a stroll down to the river before the falling twilight recalled her to the house. As she went down the flight of marble steps it was with the self-conscious "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15867"],["title","The Little Colonel's Chum: Mary Ware (#4)"],["body","that she was a girl in a play, and this was one of the scenes in Act I. She had seen a setting like this on a stage one time, when a beautiful lady trailed down the steps of a Venetian palace to the gondola waiting in the lagoon below. To be sure Mary's dress did not trail, and she was not tall and willowy outwardly, but it made no difference as long as she could _feel_ that she was. For a long time she walked slowly back and forth along the river path, pausing now and then to look up at the great castle-like building above her. She had never seen one before so suggestive of old-world grandeur. Already it was giving her more than she would find inside in its text-books. Peculiarly susceptible to surroundings, she unconsciously held herself more erect, as if such a stately habitation demanded it of her. And when she climbed the steps again, with it looming up before her in the red afterglow, the dignity and repose of its lines, from its massive portal to its highest turret, awakened a response in her beauty-loving little soul that thrilled her like music.  She went softly through the great door and up the stair-case, pausing for a moment on the landing to look at the coat-of-arms in the stained glass window. It was a copy of the window in the old ancestral castle in England, that belonged to Madam Chartley's family. Mary already knew the story of its traditional founder, the first Edryn who had won his knighthood in valiant deeds for King Arthur. In the dim light the coat-of-arms gleamed like jewels in an amber setting, and the heart in the crest, the heart out of which rose a mailed hand grasping a spear, was like a great ruby.  \"I keep the tryste,\" whispered Mary, reading the motto of the scroll underneath. \"No wonder Madam Chartley grew up to be so patrician. Anybody might with a window like that in the house.\"  Some one began striking loud full chords on a piano in one of the rooms below; some one with a strong masterful touch. Mary was sure it was a man. By leaning over the banister until she almost lost her balance, she caught a glimpse of a pair of black coat-tails swinging awkwardly over a piano bench. Herr Vogelbaum, the musical director, must have arrived. Probably she would meet him at dinner. That was something to look forward to--an artist who had played before crowned heads and had been lionized all over Germany. And then the chords rolled into something so beautiful and inspiring that Mary knew that for the first time in her life she was hearing really great music, played by a master. She sat down on the steps to listen.  The self-conscious feeling that she was acting a part in a play came back afresh, and made her hastily pull down her skirts and assume a listening attitude. Thinking how effective she would look on a stage she leaned back against the carved banister, clasping her hands around her knees, and gazing up at the ruby heart in the stained glass window above her. But in a moment both self and pose were forgotten. She had never dreamed that the world held such music as the flood of melody which came rolling up from below. It seemed to lift her out of herself and into another world; a world of nameless longings and exalted ambitions, of burning desire to do great deeds. Something was calling her--calling and calling with the compelling note of a far-off yet insistent trumpet, and as she gazed at the mailed hand with the spear rising triumphantly out of the ruby heart, she began to understand. A feeling of awe crept over her, that she, little Mary Ware, should be hearing the same call that Edryn heard. Somewhere, some day, some great achievement awaited her. Now she knew that that was why she had been born into the world. That was why, too, that Providence had opened a way for her to come to Warwick Hall, that she might learn what was to be \"the North-star of her great ambition,\" and how \"to keep the compass needle of her soul\" ever true to it.  Clasping her hands together as reverently and humbly as if she were before an altar, she looked up at the ruby heart, her face all alight, whispering Edryn's answer:       \"'Tis the King's call! O list!        O heart and hand of mine keep tryst--          Keep tryst or die!\"  The music stopped as suddenly as it had begun, and all a-tingle with the exalted mood in which it left her, she ran up to her room and knelt by the window, looking out into the dusk with eager shining eyes. As yet it was all vague and shadowy, that mysterious future which awaited her. With what great duty to the universe she was to keep tryst she did not know; but whatever it was she would do it at any cost. To callow wings no flight is too high to attempt. At sixteen all things are possible.  All girls of Mary's imaginative impulsive temperament have had such moments, under the spell of some unusual inspiration, but their dreams are apt to vanish at contact with the earth again, as suddenly as a bubble breaks when some material object touches it. But with Mary the vision stayed. True, it had to retire into the background when dinner was announced, and her over-weening curiosity brought her down to the consideration of common everyday affairs, but she did not lose the sense of having been set apart in some way by that supreme moment on the stair. To the world she might be only an ordinary little Freshman, but inwardly she knew she was a sort of Joan of Arc, called and consecrated to some high destiny.  She went down to dinner in an uplifted frame of mind that made her passage down the long dining room in the wake of Madam and the few returned teachers a veritable march of triumph. The feeling that the curtain had gone up on an interesting play in which she was chief actor came back stronger than ever when she took her seat in one of the high-backed ebony chairs, with the carved griffins atop, and unfolded her napkin in the gaze of a long line of ancestral portraits.  Madam Chartley, who had been looking forward to the dinner hour with some apprehension on the new pupil's account, knowing she would be obliged to curb the lively little tongue if she talked at the table as she had done in the reception room, was amazed at the change in her. Warwick Hall had done its work. Already the little chameleon had taken on the colour of her surroundings. Hawkins, in all his years of London service, had never served a more demure, self-possessed little English maiden, or one who listened with greater deference to the conversation of her elders.  She spoke only when she was spoken to, but some of her odd, unexpected replies made Herr Vogelbaum look up with an interest he rarely took in anything outside of his music and his dinner. Miss Chilton was so amused at her accounts of Arizona life, that she invited her up to her room, and led her into a conversation that revealed her most original traits.  \"She's a bright little thing,\" Miss Chilton reported to Madam afterward, \"The kind of a girl who is bound to be popular in a school, just because she's so different and interesting.\"  \"She is more than that,\" answered Madam, smiling over the recollection of some of her quaint speeches. \"She is lovable. She has 'the divine gift of making friends,'\"     CHAPTER III  ROOM-MATES   Up in her orderly room, on opening day, Mary listened to the bustle of arrivals, and the stir of unpacking going on all over the house. The cordial greetings called back and forth from the various rooms and the laughter in the halls made her long to have a part in the general sociability. She wished that it were necessary for her to borrow a hammer or to ask information about the trunk-room and the porter, as the other new girls were doing. That would give her an excuse for going into some of the rooms and making acquaintance with their occupants. But everything was in absolute order, and she was already familiar with the place and its rules. There was nothing for her to do but take out her bead-work and occupy herself with that as best she could until the arrival of her room-mate.  She set her door invitingly open, ready to meet more than half way any advances her neighbours might choose to make. While she sorted her beads she amused herself by fitting together the scraps of conversation which floated her way, and making guesses as to the personality of the speakers. Twice her open door brought the reward of a transient visitor. Once a jolly Sophomore glanced in to say \"I just wanted to see who has the American Beauty room. That's what we called it last term when Kitty Walton and Lloyd Sherman had it.\"  Soon after, a girl across the hall whom Mary had already identified as one Dora Irene Derwent, called Dorene for short, darted in unceremoniously with an agonized plea for a bit of court-plaster.  \"I cut my finger on a piece of glass in a picture frame that got broken in my trunk,\" she explained, unwinding her handkerchief to see if the bleeding had stopped. \"I can't find my emergency case, and Cornie Dean never was known to keep anything of the sort. All the other rooms are so upset I knew it was of no use to apply to them.\"  Happy that such an opportunity had come at last and that she could supply the demand, Mary examined the injured finger and began to trim a strip of plaster the required size. At the moment of cutting herself Dorene had dropped the broken glass, but for some unaccountable reason had thrust the frame under her arm, and was holding it hugged tight to her side by her elbow. Now as she put out her hand for Mary's inspection, she sat down on the edge of the bed, and let the frame slip from her grasp to the counterpane. The photograph side lay uppermost, and Mary, glancing at it casually, gave an exclamation of surprise.  \"Why, it's _Betty_! Betty Lewis! Do _you_ know her?\"  \"Well, rather!\" was the emphatic answer. \"She was my crush all my Freshman year. I suppose you know what that means if you've ever had a case yourself. I simply adored her, and could hardly bear to come back the next year"]]]
