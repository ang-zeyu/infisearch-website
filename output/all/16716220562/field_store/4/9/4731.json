Tired with our day's journey, and feeling sleepy after our meal, we soon returned to the shelter of the cart for a night's rest; but before we went, we were careful enough to pack up all of our cooking apparatus, and also to place our rifles close at hand, although Smith told us that the precaution was useless, as the natives never waged warfare upon full stomachs.  It was long past daylight, when the hearty voice of the convict roused us from a deep sleep, where dreams of home and comforts of civilization were much pleasanter things to contemplate, than the half-naked bodies of ten natives, who were lying upon the ground, circling the cold ashes, where the night before a fire blazed. They lay like black snakes gorged with carrion--lifeless and torpid, and nothing but repeated doses of water upon their naked backs would rouse them.  \"Go and take a bath,\" cried Smith, as we sat upright and rubbed our eyes, and yawned sleepily.  He pointed to a small stream of water, ten or fifteen rods distant, and as we thought it would be likely to relax our muscles, and relieve us of a portion of the soreness which we felt, we took his advice, and upon returning from our aquatic excursion, found coffee boiling, and salt pork hissing in the spider, and potatoes roasting in the ashes.  After a hearty breakfast, we were ready to think about starting; but the cattle had strayed to a considerable distance, and the convict determined not to run after them, when he had aids so near at hand, who could be induced for a trifle to undertake the job.  \"Hullo!\" he shouted, giving the nearest native a nudge with his foot; but the fellow only grunted, and went off to sleep again.  Smith in a rage seized a pail of water that was near at hand, and dashed part of its contents over the head and shoulders of the sleeping native, who, not being accustomed to shower baths, started up with a cold shiver, and hurriedly wiped the water from his face.  \"Run and collect the cattle,\" cried Smith, who appeared to have forgotten that not a word of English was understood by the native.  But a series of telegraphic signals was carried on by the convict, that at last gave the barbarian to know what was wanted, and the sight of half a hand of tobacco sharpened his faculties wonderfully.  He picked up his spear that was lying near at hand, and with the end pricked into life half a dozen of his torpid companions; and although blood flowed where the sharp-pointed wood touched, yet they bestirred themselves very slowly, and did not appear to think that their brother had used them any ways cruelly.  A short series of guttural grunts--for no other term will apply to express the sound of their language--was carried on for a moment, and then off started three of the natives to find the cattle of the convict, which were, perhaps, half a dozen miles down the stream, attracted by the sweetness of the grass which grew on the river's banks.  \"As we shall have to wait some time, let's have a little amusement,\" cried Smith, who appeared to take the straying of his cattle in the most philosophical manner.  \"Agreed!\" we cried. \"What shall it be?\"  \"I'll make the natives show us a specimen of their skill with the spear,\" the convict said, in the true style of Englishmen, who generally think that all creation was created expressly for their service.  \"Are they expert?\" I asked.  \"You shall see;\" and forthwith Smith commenced another series of telegraphing, and an admirable imitation of throwing the spear was not forgotten, although, to tell the truth, even the natives did not disdain to grin slightly at the clumsy gestures of the stockman.  They comprehended him, however, and pinning a small piece of paper upon a huge tree, whose trunk had served many times as a fireplace for parties of emigrants, like ourselves, bound to the mines, and by that means had nearly destroyed the vitality of the noble cedar, the native who had received the shower bath motioned to one of the youngsters of the tribe to try his hand at the target.  He selected his spear, and retired from the tree about two rods; and then, for the first time, did he appear to rouse himself, and wear the air of a human being. His eyes, which were dull a few minutes before, now lighted up, and imparted an animation to his face that I had not believed possible; there was an activity and grace in his position, as he faced the target, that proved there were some traits in their character which would have made them formidable enemies.  The youngster balanced his body, throwing his right leg back as a brace, and advancing his left foot, holding his spear upon an angle with his eye, and drawing it back and forth, as though testing the strength of his little, skinny arm, until he had apparently got the right balance, when, with a quick motion, he hurled it at the mark; and as the spear sped through the air, it produced a humming sound, like the noise of a stone when thrown from a sling by the vigorous arm of a strong man.  So quick was the motion, and rapid the movement of the spear, that the eye could not follow its flight; but we could hear the dull sound that it produced within two inches of the mark, which was not larger than a man's two hands.  \"Well done,\" shouted Fred and myself in a breath; but the natives manifested no applause, and even Smith shook his head and muttered,--  \"He can do better than that; but the youngster is nervous and hardly awake. Come, old boy,\" turning to the older native, \"try your hand at the business, and let's see what you can do.\"  After the usual telegraphing, he was made to understand what was wanted; and taking a spear a trifle heavier than the one before used, retreated nearly ten paces farther from the mark, and without apparently using the same precautions for accuracy, let it fly.  It struck the piece of paper nearly in the centre, and penetrated the tree four or five inches, quivered for a moment, but before it had ceased, the native had snatched up another spear and hurled it after the first. The second struck within an inch of its companion, and the united strength of Fred and myself was necessary to draw them from the tree.  \"Now let them see what Americans can do with rifles,\" cried the convict, as he saw that the natives were rather jubilant over the feat of their companion.  Neither Fred nor myself were what was called crack shots, either with revolver or rifle; but we were fair, and had no need to feel ashamed of our shooting. Determined to let the natives witness a specimen of our skill, we pinned a piece of white rag, not larger than the palm of my hand, upon the tree, discharged our rifles and carefully reloaded them to be sure that they were not foul, and then retreated until we could just see the rag.  The natives watched our proceedings in silence, but with considerable curiosity, squatting upon the ground, and looking first at the target and then at ourselves with an expression which seemed to say, \"if you hit that rag you are smarter than we think you are.\"  Indeed, so important did they consider the occasion, that they dragged from the huts half a dozen women, and as many naked children, to witness the exhibition.  I was to fire first; and as I drew a bead upon the mark, I carefully calculated the distance, and with such accuracy that the bullet cut the end of the mark, and carried a portion of the rag far into the body of the tree.  \"Hurrah for the rifles,\" shouted Smith, waving his hat, after he had pointed out to the natives what had been done.  The crowd which had clustered around the tree stepped back as Fred took his station. He was not so long sighting as myself, but his bullet struck about an inch above my own, and nearly in the centre of the mark.  \"Better and better,\" cried Smith, in tones of surprise; and when we joined him, we saw by his actions that we had risen in his estimation, while the natives, still squatting on their haunches, looked as though we were gods, or beings of a superior order.  \"Here come the oxen,\" cried Smith, after a few words of congratulation. \"We must get over thirty miles of ground before twelve o'clock to-night.\"  \"We are willing,\" we said.  \"And the lameness and blisters?\" he asked.  \"The lameness is nearly gone, and the blisters are broken.\"  \"Good; help me yoke the cattle, and before to-night you will taste, for the first time, broiled kangaroo; and I'll tell you beforehand it's no mean dish. Ge-long, ye brutes,\" and with hard cracks of the whip the cart rumbled on, and we left the natives still squatting upon the ground, and looking after us, as though wondering why we would travel when it was so pleasant to sit still.     CHAPTER V.  THE SOLITARY STOCKMAN.--SHOOTING A KANGAROO.   About ten o'clock on the morning that we took our leave of the natives, after witnessing their extraordinary skill at spear-hurling, the sun shone out with a brilliancy and power that caused the cattle to protrude their tongues, and lift their feet as though they wore shod with fifty-sixes.  At twelve o'clock, when it seemed impossible for the oxen to go much further without drink, our eyes were gladdened by the sight of green trees and shrubs, which grew as if marked by a straight line, far off on the prairie. The convict pointed to the well known signs of water, with an encouraging smile, if, indeed, a smile could be seen when a man's face is plastered over an inch thick with dust; but at any rate we were willing to consider it as an expression of joy; although, perhaps, some people might have thought our countenances resembled those of fiends rather than human beings, for no flesh was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16052"],["title","The Brownies and Other Tales (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net      THE BROWNIES  AND OTHER TALES.  BY  JULIANA HORATIA EWING.   LONDON:  SOCIETY FOR PROMOTING CHRISTIAN KNOWLEDGE,  NORTHUMBERLAND AVENUE, W.C.  NEW YORK: E. & J.B. YOUNG & CO.   [Published under the direction of the General Literature Committee.]   DEDICATED  TO  MY VERY DEAR AND HONOURED MOTHER.  J.H.E.  1871.    CONTENTS.   THE BROWNIES  THE LAND OF LOST TOYS  THREE CHRISTMAS TREES  AN IDYLL OF THE WOOD  CHRISTMAS CRACKERS  AMELIA AND THE DWARFS     THE BROWNIES.   A little girl sat sewing and crying on a garden seat. She had fair floating hair, which the breeze blew into her eyes, and between the cloud of hair, and the mist of tears, she could not see her work very clearly. She neither tied up her locks, nor dried her eyes, however; for when one is miserable, one may as well be completely so.  \"What is the matter?\" said the Doctor, who was a friend of the Rector's, and came into the garden whenever he pleased.  The Doctor was a tall stout man, with hair as black as crow's feathers on the top, and grey underneath, and a bushy beard. When young, he had been slim and handsome, with wonderful eyes, which were wonderful still; but that was many years past. He had a great love for children, and this one was a particular friend of his.  \"What is the matter?\" said he.  \"I'm in a row,\" murmured the young lady through her veil; and the needle went in damp, and came out with a jerk, which is apt to result in what ladies called \"puckering.\"  \"You are like London in a yellow fog,\" said the Doctor, throwing himself on to the grass, \"and it is very depressing to my feelings. What is the row about, and how came you to get into it?\"  \"We're all in it,\" was the reply; and apparently the fog was thickening, for the voice grew less and less distinct--\"the boys and everybody. It's all about forgetting, and not putting away, and leaving about, and borrowing, and breaking, and that sort of thing. I've had Father's new pocket-handkerchiefs to hem, and I've been out climbing with the boys, and kept forgetting and forgetting, and Mother says I always forget; and I can't help it. I forget to tidy his newspapers for him, and I forget to feed Puss, and I forgot these; besides, they're a great bore, and Mother gave them to Nurse to do, and this one was lost, and we found it this morning tossing about in the toy-cupboard.\"  \"It looks as if it had been taking violent exercise,\" said the Doctor. \"But what have the boys to do with it?\"  \"Why, then there was a regular turn out of the toys,\" she explained, \"and they're all in a regular mess. You know, we always go on till the last minute, and then things get crammed in anyhow. Mary and I did tidy them once or twice; but the boys never put anything away, you know, so what's the good?\"  \"What, indeed!\" said the Doctor. \"And so you have complained of them?\"  \"Oh! no!\" answered she. \"We don't get them into rows, unless they are very provoking; but some of the things were theirs, so everybody was sent for, and I was sent out to finish this, and they are all tidying. I don't know when it will be done, for I have all this side to hem; and the soldiers' box is broken, and Noah is lost out of the Noah's Ark, and so is one of the elephants and a guinea-pig, and so is the rocking-horse's nose; and nobody knows what has become of Rutlandshire and the Wash, but they're so small, I don't wonder; only North America and Europe are gone too.\"  The Doctor started up in affected horror. \"Europe gone, did you say? Bless me! what will become of us!\"  \"Don't!\" said the young lady, kicking petulantly with her dangling feet, and trying not to laugh. \"You know I mean the puzzles; and if they were yours, you wouldn't like it.\"  \"I don't half like it as it is,\" said the Doctor. \"I am seriously alarmed. An earthquake is one thing; you have a good shaking, and settle down again. But Europe gone--lost--Why, here comes Deordie, I declare, looking much more cheerful than we do; let us humbly hope that Europe has been found. At present I feel like Aladdin when his palace had been transported by the magician; I don't know where I am.\"  \"You're here, Doctor; aren't you?\" asked the slow curly-wigged brother, squatting himself on the grass.  \"_Is_ Europe found?\" said the Doctor tragically.  \"Yes,\" laughed Deordie. \"I found it.\"  \"You will be a great man,\" said the Doctor. \"And--it is only common charity to ask--how about North America?\"  \"Found too,\" said Deordie. \"But the Wash is completely lost.\"  \"And my six shirts in it!\" said the Doctor. \"I sent them last Saturday as ever was. What a world we live in! Any more news? Poor Tiny here has been crying her eyes out.\"  \"I'm so sorry, Tiny,\" said the brother. \"But don't bother about it. It's all square now, and we're going to have a new shelf put up.\"  \"Have you found everything?\" asked Tiny.  \"Well, not the Wash, you know. And the elephant and the guinea-pig are gone for good; so the other elephant and the other guinea-pig must walk together as a pair now. Noah was among the soldiers, and we have put the cavalry into a night-light box. Europe and North America were behind the book-case; and, would you believe it? the rocking-horse's nose has turned up in the nursery oven.\"  \"I can't believe it,\" said the Doctor. \"The rocking-horse's nose couldn't turn up, it was the purest Grecian, modelled from the Elgin marbles. Perhaps it was the heat that did it, though. However, you seem to have got through your troubles very well, Master Deordie. I wish poor Tiny were at the end of her task.\"  \"So do I,\" said Deordie ruefully. \"But I tell you what I've been thinking, Doctor. Nurse is always nagging at us, and we're always in rows of one sort or another, for doing this, and not doing that, and leaving our things about. But, you know, it's a horrid shame, for there are plenty of servants, and I don't see why we should be always bothering to do little things, and--\"  \"Oh! come to the point, please,\" said the Doctor; \"you do go round the square so, in telling your stories, Deordie. What have you been thinking of?\"  \"Well,\" said Deordie, who was as good-tempered as he was slow, \"the other day Nurse shut me up in the back nursery for borrowing her scissors and losing them; but I'd got 'Grimm' inside one of my knickerbockers, so when she locked the door, I sat down to read. And I read the story of the Shoemaker and the little Elves who came and did his work for him before he got up; and I thought it would be so jolly if we had some little Elves to do things instead of us.\"  \"That's what Tommy Trout said,\" observed the Doctor.  \"Who's Tommy Trout?\" asked Deordie.  \"Don't you know, Deor?\" said Tiny. \"It's the good boy who pulled the cat out of the what's-his-name.       'Who pulled her out?      Little Tommy Trout.'  Is it the same Tommy Trout, Doctor? I never heard anything else about him except his pulling the cat out; and I can't think how he did that.\"  \"Let down the bucket for her, of course,\" said the Doctor. \"But listen to me. If you will get that handkerchief done, and take it to your mother with a kiss, and not keep me waiting, I'll have you all to tea, and tell you the story of Tommy Trout.\"  \"This very night?\" shouted Deordie.  \"This very night.\"  \"Every one of us?\" inquired the young gentleman with rapturous incredulity.  \"Every one of you.--Now, Tiny, how about that work?\"  \"It's just done,\" said Tiny.--\"Oh! Deordie, climb up behind, and hold back my hair, there's a darling, while I fasten off. Oh! Deor, you're pulling my hair out. Don't.\"  \"I want to make a pig-tail,\" said Deor.  \"You can't,\" said Tiny, with feminine contempt. \"You can't plait. What's the good of asking boys to do anything? There! it's done at last. Now go and ask Mother if we may go.--Will you let me come, Doctor,\" she inquired, \"if I do as you said?\"  \"To be sure I will,\" he answered. \"Let me look at you. Your eyes are swollen with crying. How can you be such a silly little goose?\"  \"Did you never cry?\" asked Tiny.  \"When I was your age? Well, perhaps so.\"  \"You've never cried since, surely,\" said Tiny.  The Doctor absolutely blushed.  \"What do you think?\" said he.  \"Oh, of course not,\" she answered. \"You've nothing to cry about. You're grown up, and you live all alone in a beautiful house, and you do as you like, and never get into rows, or have anybody but yourself to think about; and no nasty pocket-handkerchiefs to hem.\"  \"Very nice; eh, Deordie?\" said the Doctor.  \"Awfully jolly,\" said Deordie.  \"Nothing else to wish for, eh?\"  \"_I_ should keep harriers, and not a poodle, if I were a man,\" said Deordie; \"but I suppose you could, if you wanted to.\"  \"Nothing to cry about, at any rate?\"  \"I should think not!\" said Deordie.--\"There's Mother, though; let's go and ask her about the tea;\" and off they ran.  The Doctor stretched his six feet of length upon the sward, dropped his grey head on a little heap of newly-mown grass, and looked up into the sky.  \"Awfully jolly--no nasty pocket-handkerchiefs to hem,\" said he, laughing to himself. \"Nothing else to wish for; nothing to cry about.\"  Nevertheless, he lay still, staring at the sky, till the smile died away, and tears came into his eyes. Fortunately, no one was there to see.  What could this \"awfully jolly\" Doctor be thinking of to make him cry? He was thinking of a grave-stone in the churchyard close by, and of a story connected with this grave-stone which was known to everybody in the place who was old enough to remember it. This story has nothing to do with the present story, so it ought not to be told.  And yet it has to do with the Doctor, and is very short, so it shall be put in, after all.   THE STORY OF A GRAVE-STONE.  One early spring morning, about twenty years before, a man going to his work at sunrise through the churchyard, stopped by a flat stone which he had lately helped to lay down. The day before, a name had been cut on it, which he stayed to read; and below the name some one had"]]]
