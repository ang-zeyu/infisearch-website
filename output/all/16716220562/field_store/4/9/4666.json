This call was answered, not by Peaks, who no longer performed the duties of boatswain, but by one of the students, who had been appointed to this position.  \"Pipe all hands to muster, boatswain,\" said the first lieutenant, as the petty officer touched his cap to him.  \"All hands on deck, ahoy!\" shouted the boatswain, as he piped the call.  This was an unusual order for that time of day, the forenoon being appropriated to study for each watch in turn; and those who were below hastened on deck to ascertain what was to be done.  \"All hands, stations for loosing sail!\" piped the boatswain, when ordered to do so by Gordon.  The first lieutenant was in charge of the ship, under the direction of the captain. The second lieutenant stood on the forecastle, where he was attended by the boatswain. The third lieutenant was in the waist, and the fourth on the quarter deck, near the mizzenmast. These were the stations of the officers whenever all hands were called. Mr. Lowington and the instructors stood near the companion-way, watching with interest this first attempt to make sail all over the ship.  \"Lay aloft, sail-loosers!\" shouted Gordon; and his order was repeated by the officers at their several stations.  The little tars who belonged on the topsail and top-gallant yards sprang up the rigging like so many cats, excited beyond measure by the scene of activity around them.  \"Lower yardmen in the chains!\" continued Gordon and his order was passed, along by the officers. \"Aloft, lower yardmen!\"  In a moment the crew were in their places; the studding-sail booms were triced up with the usual system, so that the sails could be reached.  \"Lay out!\" continued the first lieutenant; and the boys walked out on the foot-ropes to their stations on the yards. \"Loose!\"  The ropes by which the sails were secured to the yards were removed at this order, and the topmen held the sails in their places.  \"All ready on the forecastle, sir,\" reported Foster, who was captain of that part of the ship.  \"All ready in the foretop.\"  \"All ready in the maintop.\"  \"All ready in the mizzentop,\" reported the several captains of the tops, in their proper order.  These reports were passed to the first lieutenant in charge of the deck, by his subordinates.  \"Let fall!\" shouted Gordon, highly excited; and the sails dropped from the yard. \"Overhaul your rigging aloft! Man sheets and halyards! Sheets home, and hoist away!\"  These orders were passed from mouth to mouth among the officers, and return reports made, according to the strict discipline of the navy. They were promptly executed by the crew, though of course not without some blunders; and the Young America was covered with her cloud of canvas. Mr. Lowington commended the officers and crew for the promptness and skill they had displayed in their first concerted attempt at making sail. He then directed Captain Carnes to furl. Both evolutions were then repeated, until a proficiency satisfactory for one day was attained.  \"Not going to sea, after all,\" said Shuffles, when the crew were dismissed from muster.  \"No,\" replied Wilton. \"I'm tired of lying here, and if we don't go to sea soon, I shall take myself off.\"  \"I'm with you.\"  \"I thought we were going to have some fun on board, but we don't do anything but study and shake out topsails.\"  \"Do you know how you stand on marks, Wilton?\" asked Shuffles.  \"No; not very high, though.\"  \"Don't you think you shall get into the cabin next term?\"  \"I know I shall not. I haven't tried for anything.\"  \"On the first of next month, you know, new officers will be appointed, and I suppose the crew will be messed over again.\"  \"I don't care, I'm getting tired of this thing, I had a better time at the Academy before we came on board.\"  \"There isn't much chance for any sport. Hardly a fellow has been allowed to go on shore since we joined the ship.\"  \"Well get up a mutiny, if things don't improve.\"  \"I was thinking of that very thing myself,\" said Shuffles, in a low tone.  \"A mutiny!\" exclaimed Wilton, who had used the word in jest.  \"Just for fum, you know,\" laughed Shuffles.  \"You don't mean any such thing?\"  \"Not yet, of course.\"  \"Do you at any time?\"  \"We want something more exciting than this kind of a life. Here we are, kept down and treated like common sailors. We have to touch our caps and make our manners to Dick Carnes and the rest of the flunkies in the after cabin. My father pays as much for me as Dick Carnes' father does for him, and I don't think it is fair that he should live in the cabin and I in the steerage.\"  \"If you get marks enough, you can have a berth in the cabin,\" replied Wilton.  \"Marks! Confound the marks! I'm not a baby. Do you think a fellow seventeen years old is going to be put up or put down by marks?\" said Shuffles.  \"I thought you had been working for a place in the cabin.\"  \"So I have, but I don't expect to get it. I never studied so hard in my life, and I believe I haven't had a bad mark since I came on board, Lowington thinks I have reformed,\" laughed Shuffles. \"And so I have.\"  \"What do you want to get up a mutiny for, then?\"  \"I shall not, if I get a decent position; if I don't, I'm going in for some fun.\"  \"But do you really think of getting up a mutiny?\" asked Wilton, curiously.  \"I was thinking the other day what a fine thing it would be if our fellows had the ship all to themselves.\"  \"What could we do with her?\"  \"Go on a cruise in her.\"  \"We couldn't handle her; there is hardly a fellow on board that knows anything about navigation.\"  \"Of course, I don't mean to do anything yet a while; not this year, perhaps. One of these days, if we stay on board, we shall know all about a ship. Fifteen or twenty of the fellows are studying navigation. We are going to Europe some time or other. When we do, we can take the ship, and go it on our own hook.\"  \"I don't believe you mean anything of the kind, Bob Shuffles.\"  \"I've been thinking about it, anyhow. We can lock Lowington and the rest of the old folks into their cabin while they are at dinner; and there are enough of us to handle Peaks and Bitts.\"  \"I think you are crazy, Shuffles.\"  \"We should have a high old time if we could get possession of the ship. We wont say a word about it yet.\"  \"I think you had better not.\"  \"We might go round Cape Horn into the Pacific, and have a splendid time among the beautiful islands of the South Sea.\"  \"Of course all the fellows wouldn't join you.\"  \"We could put those ashore somewhere who did not agree with us.\"  \"You know the penalty of mutiny on the high seas.\"  \"Bah!\" said Shuffles, contemptuously. \"It would be nothing but it lark. No one would think of hanging us, or even sending us to prison for it. My father is rich enough to get me out of any scrape.\"  \"So is mine; but I don't think it would be quite safe to go into a mutiny.\"  \"Not yet, my dear fellow. You can think it over.\"  \"But I'm tired of this kind of a life. I liked it first rate in the beginning. Do you think Lowington really intends to go to sea with the ship?\"  \"I know he does.\"  \"If he don't go pretty soon, I shall run away, and go to sea in earnest.\"  \"Don't say a word about the mutiny at present, Wilton. By and by, if things go right, or if they don't go right, we may want to take some stock in such an enterprise.\"  \"I don't see it yet, but of course I shall keep still.\"  It is doubtful whether even so daring a young man as Shuffles, who had the temerity to do almost anything, seriously contemplated getting up a mutiny. Very likely his untamed and vicious imagination had revelled in such an enterprise; had pictured the delights of the rover's life at sea; but a boy of ordinary common sense could hardly think of engaging in such a mad scheme.  The last week of June, with which month ended the first school term on board of the Young America, was devoted to examinations and reviews in all the studies for which extra marks were given. On the last day the instructors made up the merit lists, and on the morning of the 1st of July all hands were mustered, and the result declared. Most of the officers, all of whom had studied with unremitting diligence in order to retain their positions, were reinstated in their offices. The third lieutenant, however, fell out, having failed in his reviews, and to the astonishment of all, Robert Shuffles was found to be entitled to the place. The first and second lieutenants exchanged ranks, and Paul Kendall fell to the position of second master. Three of the tenants of the after cabin were compelled to move into the steerage, and three of the crew were transferred to the officers' quarters.  Many were disappointed, and perhaps some were disheartened, for the competition had been a severe struggle; and as much depended upon natural ability as upon energy and perseverance. But the Young America was a world by herself. She had all the elements of society within her wooden walls, and success and failure there followed the same rules as in the great world of which she was an epitome.  After the officers had been duly installed in their positions, the petty offices were given to those having the highest number of marks among the crew. It was certainly democratic for the late third lieutenant to become captain of the foretop, and for a second master to become coxswain of the professors' barge; but these young gentlemen, though disappointed, submitted with a good grace to their misfortune.  The student having the highest number of marks among the crew was allowed to have the first choice of berths in the steerage; the one having the next highest number had the second choice, and so on, until all the numbers had been appropriated. At the conclusion of the reorganization, Mr. Lowington made a speech, \"comforting the mourners,\" and reminding all the students that, on the 1st of October, there would be another distribution of the places of honor.

Seldom has a people made such rapid strides forward as the Russian Jews. From the melancholy regularity that marked their existence a little more than two generations ago, from the darkness of the Middle Ages in which they were steeped until the time of Alexander II, they emerged suddenly into the life and light of the West, and some of the most intrepid devotees of latter-day culture, both in Europe and in America, have come from among them. Destitute of everything that makes for enlightenment, and under the dominion of a Government which sought to extinguish the few rushlights that scattered the shadows around them, they nevertheless snatched victory from defeat, sloughed off medieval superstition, and, disregarding the Dejanira shirt of modern disabilities, compelled their countrymen to admit more than once that    Tho' I've belted you and flayed you,   By the livin' Gawd that made you,   You're a better man than I am!  Similar movements were started in Germany during the latter part of the eighteenth century, and in Austria, notably Galicia, at the beginning of the nineteenth, but none stirred the mind of the Jews to the same degree as the Haskalah movement in Russia during the last fifty years. In the former, the removal of restrictions soon rendered attempts toward self-emancipation unnecessary on the part of Jews, and the few Maskilim among them, satisfied with the present, devoted themselves to investigating and elucidating the past of their people's history. In Russia the past was all but forgotten on account of the immediate duties of the present. The energy and acquisitiveness that made the Jews of happier and more prosperous lands prominent in every sphere of practical life, were directed toward the realm of thought, and the merciless severity with which the Government excluded them from the enjoyment of things material only increased their ardor for things spiritual and intellectual.  In its wide sense Haskalah denotes enlightenment. Those who strove to enlighten their benighted coreligionists or disseminate European culture among them, were called Maskilim. A careful perusal of this work will reveal the exact ideals these terms embody. For Haskalah was not only progressive, it was also aggressive, militant, sometimes destructive. From the days of Mordecai Günzburg to the time of Asher Ginzberg (Ahad Ha-'Am), it changed its tendencies and motives more than once. Levinsohn, \"the father of the Maskilim,\" was satisfied with removing the ban from secular learning; Gordon wished to see his brethren \"Jews at home and men abroad\"; Smolenskin dreamed of the rehabilitation of Jews in Palestine; and Ahad Ha-'Am hopes for the spiritual regeneration of his beloved people. Others advocated the levelling of all distinctions between Jews and Gentiles, or the upliftment of mankind in general and Russia in particular. To each of them Haskalah implied different ideals, and through each it promulgated diverse doctrines. To trace these varying phases from an indistinct glimmering in the eighteenth century to the glorious effulgence of the beginning of the twentieth, is the main object of this book.  In pursuance of my end, I have paid particular attention to the causes that retarded or accelerated Russo-Jewish cultural advance. As these causes originate in the social, economic, and political status of the Russian Jew, I frequently portray political events as well as the state of knowledge, belief, art, and morals of the periods under consideration. For this reason also I have marked the boundaries of the Haskalah epochs in correspondence to the dates of the reigns of the several czars, though the correspondence is not always exact.  Essays have been published, on some of the topics treated in these pages, by writers in different languages: in Russian, by Bramson, Klausner, and Morgulis; in Hebrew, by Izgur, Katz, and Klausner; in German, by Maimon, Lilienthal, Wengeroff, and Weissberg; in English, by Lilienthal and Wiener; and in French, by Slouschz. The subject as a whole, however, has not been treated. Should this work stimulate further research, I shall feel amply rewarded. Without prejudice and without partiality, by an honest presentation of facts drawn from what I regard as reliable sources, I have tried to unfold the story of the struggle of five millions of human beings for right living and rational thinking, in the hope of throwing light on the ideals and aspirations and the real character of the largely prejudged and misunderstood Russian Jew.  In conclusion, I wish to express my gratitude and indebtedness to those who encouraged me to proceed with my work after some specimens of it had been published in several Jewish periodicals, especially to Doctor Solomon Schechter, Rabbi Max Heller, and Mr. A.S. Freidus, for their courtesy and assistance while the work was being written.  JACOB S. RAISIN.  E. Las Vegas, N. Mex.,  Thanksgiving Day, 1909.     CHAPTER I  THE PRE-HASKALAH PERIOD  ?-1648   \"There is but one key to the present,\" says Max Müller, \"and that is the past.\" To understand fully the growth and historical development of a people's mind, one must be familiar with the conditions that have shaped its present form. It would seem necessary, therefore, to introduce a description of the Haskalah movement with a rapid survey of the history of the Russo-Polish Jews from the time of their emergence from obscurity up to the middle of the seventeenth century.  Among those who laid the foundations for the study of this almost unexplored department of Jewish history, the settlement of Jews in Russia and their vicissitudes during the dark ages, the most prominent are perhaps Isaac Bär Levinsohn, Abraham Harkavy, and Simon Dubnow. There is much to be said of each of these as writers, scholars, and men. Here they concern us as Russo-Jewish historians. What Linnaeus, Agassiz, and Cuvier did in the field of natural philosophy, they accomplished in their chosen province of Jewish history.[1] Levinsohn was the first to express the opinion that the Russian Jews hailed, not from Germany, as is commonly supposed, but from the banks of the Volga. This hypothesis, corroborated by tradition, Harkavy established as a fact. Originally the vernacular of the Jews of Volhynia, Podolia, and Kiev was Russian and Polish, or, rather, the two being closely allied, Palaeo-Slavonic. The havoc wrought by the Crusades in the Jewish communities of Western Europe caused a constant stream of German-Jewish immigrants to pour, since 1090, into the comparatively free countries of the Slavonians. Russo-Poland became the America of the Old World. The Jewish settlers from abroad soon outnumbered the native Jews, and they spread a new language and new customs wherever they established themselves.[2]  Whether the Jews of Russia were originally pagans from the shores of the Black and Caspian Seas, converted to Judaism under the Khazars during the eighth century, or Palestinian exiles subjugated by their Slavonian conquerors and assimilated with them, it is indisputable that they inhabited what we know to-day as Russia long before the Varangian prince Rurik came, at the invitation of Scythian and Sarmatian savages, to lay the foundation of the Muscovite empire. In Feodosia there is a synagogue at least a thousand years old. The Greek inscription on a marble slab, dating back to 80-81 B.C.E., preserved in the Imperial Hermitage in St. Petersburg, makes it certain that they flourished in the Crimea before the"]]]
