Good Heavens! we're not all of us deaf?   CRESPEL.    All right! The devil take you!   FRANTZ.    Yes, sir, the key is in the door.   CRESPEL.    Idiot! donkey!   FRANTZ.    Its agreed then.   CRESPEL.    Morbleu!  (He exits quickly.)   FRANTZ (alone).  Well! What! angry always! Strange, peevish, exacting! One would think that one pleased him For his money... Day and night I'm on all fours, At the least sign I'm silent; It is just as if I sang! But no, if I sang, His contempt he'd have to modify. I sing alone sometimes, But singing isn't easy! Tra la, la, tra, la la! Still it isn't voice that I lack, I think, Tra la la, tra la la, No, 'tis the method. Of course one can't have everything. I sing pretty badly, But dance agreeably, And I do not flatter myself; Dancing shows off my advantages. 'Tis my one great attraction, But dancing isn't easy. Tra la la, tra la la.  (He dances and stops.)  With women the shape of my leg Would do me no harm, Tra la la, tra la la!  (He falls.)  No, 'tis the method.  (Hoffman enters followed by Nicklausse.)   HOFFMAN.  Frantz! This is it. (touches Frantz on shoulder.)  Up, my friend.   FRANTZ.  Hey, who's there? (rises, surprised.)  Monsieur Hoffman!   HOFFMAN.    Myself. Well, Antonia?   FRANTZ.    He's gone out, sir.   HOFFMAN (laughing).  Ha, ha, deafer yet Than last year...   FRANTZ.  Monsieur honors me, I am very well, thanks to heaven.   HOFFMAN.    Antonia! I must see her.   FRANTZ.  Very well! what a joy For monsieur Crespel! (He goes out.)   HOFFMAN (sitting before the clavichord).    'Tis a song of love   That flies away,   Sad or gay;   It takes its turn...   ANTONIA (entering suddenly).    Hoffman!...   HOFFMAN (receiving her in his arms).    Antonia!   NICKLAUSSE (aside).    I am one too many, good night.  (He exits.)   ANTONIA.    Ah, I well knew that you loved me still.   HOFFMAN.  My heart told me that I was regretted, But why were we separated?   ANTONIA.    I do not know.  (Ensemble.)   HOFFMAN.  I have happiness in my heart; To-morrow you'll be my wife     Happy couple. The future shall be ours! To love let's be faithful, That her eternal chains,     Keep our hearts Conquerors even against time!   ANTONIA.  I have joy in my heart! To-morrow I'll be your wife,     Happy couple, The future is ours! Each day new songs, Your genius opens its wings, My conquering song Is the echo of your heart.   HOFFMAN (smiling).  Still, oh my affianced, Shall I speak my thought? That, spite of myself, troubles me, Music inspires a little jealousy, You love it too much!   ANTONIA (smiling).  See the strange fantasy! Did I love you for it, or it for you? For you are not going to forbid me To sing, as did my father.   HOFFMAN.    What say you?   ANTONIA.  Yes, my father at present imposes the virtue Of silence.   HOFFMAN (aside).    'Tis strange... can it be?...   ANTONIA (drawing him to the clavichord).  Come here as before; Listen, and you'll see if I've lost my voice.   HOFFMAN.    How your eye lights up, your hand trembles.   ANTONIA (making him sit down).    Here, the soft song of love we sang together.  (She sings.)    'Tis a song of love   That flies off   Sad or joyful,   Turn by turn,   'Tis a song of love,   The new rose   Smiles on the Spring.   Ah! how long will it be   That it lives?   TOGETHER.    'Tis a song of love   That flies off, etc., etc.   HOFFMAN.    A ray of flame   Matches thy beauty.   Will you see the summer?   Flower of the soul.   TOGETHER.    'Tis a song of love, etc., etc.  (Antonia puts her hand to her heart.)   HOFFMAN.    Why, what is the matter?   ANTONIA (doing same again).    Nothing.   HOFFMAN (listening).    Chut.   ANTONIA.    Heavens, my father! Come, come...  (She goes out.)   HOFFMAN.    No! I must know the last word of this mystery.  (He hides. Crespel appears.)   CRESPEL (looking about him).  No, nothing. I thought Hoffman was here. May he go to the devil!   HOFFMAN (aside).    Many thanks!   FRANTZ (entering).    Sir.   CRESPEL.    What?   FRANTZ.    Doctor Miracle.   CRESPEL.  Infamous scoundrel, Quickly close the door.   FRANTZ.    Yes, sir, the doctor...   CRESPEL.  He, doctor? No, on my soul, A grave digger, an assassin! Who would kill my daughter after my wife. I hear the jingle of his golden vials, From me let him be chased.  (Miracle suddenly appears. Frantz runs away.)   MIRACLE.    Ha, ha, ha, ha!   CRESPEL.  Well, here I am! 'tis me. This good monsieur Crespel, I like him, But where is he?   CRESPEL (stopping him).    Morbleu!   MIRACLE.  Ha, ha, ha, ha! I sought for your Antonia. Well, this trouble she inherited From her mother? Still progressing, dear girl. We'll cure her. Take me to her.   CRESPEL.  To assassinate her... If you make one step I'll throw you out of the window.   MIRACLE.  There now softly, I do not wish to Displease you.  (He advances a chair.)   CRESPEL.    What do you, traitor?   MIRACLE.  To minimize the danger, One must know it. Let me question her.   CRESPEL AND HOFFMAN.    Terror penetrates me.  (Ensemble.)  (Miracle, his hand extended toward Antonia's room.)  To my conquering power, Give way with good grace. Near me without terror Come take your place.   CRESPEL AND HOFFMAN.  With fright and with horror All my being is cold; A strange terror Chains me to this place.     I'm afraid.   CRESPEL (seating himself).    Come, speak and be brief.  (Miracle continues his magnetic passes. The door of Antonia's room opens   slowly. Miracle indicates that he takes Antonia's hand and leads her   to a chair.)   MIRACLE.    Please sit there.   CRESPEL.    I am seated.   MIRACLE (paying no attention).    How old are you, please?   CRESPEL.    Who, me?   MIRACLE.    I am speaking to your child.   HOFFMAN (aside).    Antonia.   MIRACLE.    What age (he listens). Twenty!   CRESPEL.    What?   MIRACLE.    The Spring of life.  (He appears to feel the pulse.)    Let me see your hand!...   CRESPEL.    The hand.   MIRACLE (pulling out his watch).    Chut! let me count.   HOFFMAN (aside).    God! am I the plaything of a dream? Is it a ghost?   MIRACLE.    The pulse is unequal and fast, bad symptom. Sing.   CRESPEL (rising).    No, no, don't speak... don't have her sing.  (The voice of Antonia is heard.)   MIRACLE.  See her face brightens, her eyes are on fire; She carries her hand to her beating heart.  (He follows Antonia with his gestures. The door of her room closes   quickly.)   CRESPEL.    What is he saying?   MIRACLE (rising).  It would be a pity truly To leave to death so fine a prey!   CRESPEL.    Shut up!   MIRACLE.  If you will accept my help, If you would save her days, I have there certain vials I keep in reserve.  (He takes vials from pocket which he makes sound like castanets.)   CRESPEL.    Shut up!   MIRACLE.    Of which you should.   CRESPEL.  Shut up! Heaven preserve me From listening to your advice, miserable assassin.   MIRACLE.    Of which you should, each morning...  (Ensemble.)   MIRACLE.  Why, yes, I hear you. A while ago, an instant These vials, poor father, You will be then, I hope,     Satisfied.   CRESPEL.  Be off, be off, be off! Out of this house, Satan, Beware of the anger And the sorrow of a father.     Be off!   HOFFMAN (aside).  From the death that awaits thee I shall know, poor child, How tear thee away, I hope! Laugh in vain at a father,     Satan!   MIRACLE (continuing with same coolness).    Of which you should...   CRESPEL.    Be off!   MIRACLE.    Each morning...   CRESPEL.    Be off!  (He pushes Miracle out and closes the door.)    Ah, he's outside and my door is closed!   We are at last alone,   My beloved girl!   MIRACLE (walking through the wall).    Of which you should each morning...   CRESPEL.  Ah, wretch, Come, come, may the waves engulf thee!   We'll see if the devil   Will get thee out.   CRESPEL.    Be off, be off, be off!       etc., etc.   HOFFMAN (aside).    From the death that awaits thee,       etc., etc.   MIRACLE.    Of which you should...   CRESPEL.    Get out!   MIRACLE.    Each morning...   CRESPEL.    Get out!  (They disappear together.)   HOFFMAN (coming down).  To sing no more! How obtain from her Such a sacrifice?   ANTONIA (appearing).    Well? What did my father say?   HOFFMAN.  Ask me nothing; Later you'll know all; a new road Opens for us, my Antonia!... To follow my steps dismiss from your memory These dreams of future success and glory That your heart to mine confided.   ANTONIA.    But yourself!   HOFFMAN.  Love calls to both of us, All that is not you is nothing in my life.   ANTONIA.    Very well! Here is my hand!   HOFFMAN.  Ah dear Antonia, shall I appreciate What you do for me? (He kisses her hands.)  Your father will perhaps return. I leave you... until to-morrow.   ANTONIA.    Until to-morrow.  (Hoffman goes out.)   ANTONIA (opening one of the doors).  Of my father easily he has become the accomplice, But come, regrets are superfluous, I promised him. I shall sing no more.  (She falls in a chair.)   MIRACLE (appearing suddenly behind her.)  You will sing no more. Do you know what a sacrifice? He imposes on your youth, and have you measured it? Grace, beauty, talent, sacred gift; All these blessings that heaven gave for your share, Must they be hid in the shadow of a household? Have you not heard, in a proud dream, Like unto a forest by the wind moving, Like a soft shiver of the pressing crowd That murmurs your name and follows you with its eyes? There is the ardent joy and the eternal festival, That the flower of your years is about to abandon, For the middle class pleasures where they would enchain you, And the squalling children who will give you less beauty!   ANTONIA (without turning round).  Ah, what is this voice that troubles my spirit? Is it Hell that speaks or Heaven that warns me? No! happiness is not there, oh cursed voice, And against my pride my love has armed me; Glory is not worth the happy shade whence invites me The house of my beloved.   MIRACLE.  What loves can now be yours, Hoffman"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15915"],["title","New version of Les contes d'Hoffmann (The tales of Hoffman) (#4)"],["body","you to his brutality, He only loves in you your beauty, And for him as for the others. Soon will come the time of infidelity.  (He disappears.)   ANTONIA (rising).  No, do not tempt me! go away, Demon! I will no longer listen. I have sworn to be his, my beloved awaits me, I'm no longer my own and I can't take myself back; And a few moments since, on his heart adored What eternal love did he not pledge me; Who will save me from the demon, from myself? My mother, my mother, I love her.  (She falls weeping on the clavichord.)   MIRACLE (re-appears behind Antonia)  Your mother? Dare you invoke her? Your mother? But is it not she? Who speaks by my voice ingrate, and recalls to you The splendor of the name that you would abdicate?  (The portrait lights up and becomes animated.)    Listen!   THE VOICE.    Antonia!   ANTONIA.  Heavens!... my mother, my mother!   THE GHOST.  Dear child whom I call, As I used to do, 'Tis your mother, 'tis she, Listen to her voice.   ANTONIA.    Mother!   MIRACLE.    Yes, yes, 'tis her voice, do you hear? Her voice, best counselor, Who leaves you a talent the world has lost!   THE GHOST.    Antonia!   MIRACLE.  Listen! She seems to live aagin, And the distant public by its bravos fills her bliss.   ANTONIA.    Mother!   GHOST.    Antonia!   MIRACLE.    Join with her.   ANTONIA.    Yes, her soul calls me As before; 'Tis my mother, 'tis she I hear her voice.   THE GHOST.  Dear child whom I call As I used to do; 'Tis your mother, 'tis she; List to her voice.   ANTONIA.    No, enough, I cannot!   MIRACLE.    Again.   ANTONIA.    I will sing no more.   MIRACLE.    Again.   ANTONIA.    What ardor draws and devours me?   MIRACLE.    Again! Why stop?   ANTONIA (out of breath).  I give way to a transport that maddens, What flame is it dazzles my eyes A single moment to live, And my soul flies to Heaven.   THE GHOST.    Dear child whom I call,       etc., etc.   ANTONIA.    'Tis my mother, 'tis she,       etc., etc.   ANTONIA.    Ah!  (She falls dying on the sofa. Miracle sinks in the earth uttering a peal   of laughter.)   CRESPEL (running in).  My child... my daughter... Antonia!.   ANTONIA (expiring).  My father! Listen, 'tis my mother Who calls me. And he... has returned... 'Tis a song of love, Flies away, Sad or joyful...  (She dies.)   CRESPEL.  No... a single word... just one... my child... speak! Come, speak! Execrable death! No! pity, mercy... go away!   HOFFMAN (coming hurriedly).    Why these cries?   CRESPEL.  Hoffman!... ah wretch! 'Tis you who killed her!...   HOFFMAN (rushing to Antonia).    Antonia!   CRESPEL (beside himself).  Blood to color her cheek. A weapon. A knife!...  (He seizes a knife and attacks Hoffman.)   NICKLAUSSE (entering and stopping Crespel).    Unhappy man!   HOFFMAN (to Nicklausse).  Quick! give the alarm; A doctor... a doctor!...   MIRACLE (appearing).    Present!  (He feels Antonia's pulse.)    Dead!   CRESPEL (crazy).    Ah, God, my child, my daughter!   HOFFMAN (despairingly).    Antonia!     EPILOGUE.  (Same scene as First Act. The various personages are in the same   positions they were in at the end of First Act.)   HOFFMANN.  There is the story Of my loves, And the memory In my heart will always remain.   CHORUS.    Bravo, bravo, Hoffmann.   HOFFMANN.  Ah, I am mad. For us the craze divine, The spirits of alcohol, of beer and of wine, For us intoxication, Chaos where we forget.   NICKLAUSSE.    Ah, I understand, three dramas in a drama, Olympia...   HOFFMANN.    Smashed!   NICKLAUSSE.    Antonia...   HOFFMANN.    Dead!   NICKLAUSSE.    Giulietta...   HOFFMANN.  Oh, for her, the last verse of the song of Klein-Zach. When he drank too much gin or rack, You ought to have seen the two tails at his back, Like lilies in a lac, The monster made a sound of flick flack,     Flic, flac,     There's Klein-Zach.   CHORUS.      Flick flack,     There's Klein-Zach.   CHORUS.  Light up the punch, drunk we'll get; And may the weakest Roll under the table; Luther was a goodly man, Tire lan laire, tire lan la,     etc., etc.  (The students tumultuously go in the next room. Hoffmann remains as if   in a stupor.)   THE MUSE (appearing in an aureole of light).  And I? I, the faithful friend, Whose hand wiped thy tears? By whom thy latent sorrow Exhales in heavenly dreams? Am I nothing? May the tempest Of passion pass away in thee! The man is no more; the poet revives I love thee Hoffmann! be mine! Let the ashes of thy heart fire thy genius, Whose serenity smiles on thy sorrows. The Muse will soften thy blessed sufferings. One is great by love but greater by tears.  (She disappears.)   HOFFMANN (alone).  Oh God! what ecstasy embraces my soul, Like a concert divine Thy voice hath moved me, With soft and burning fire my being is devoured, Thy glances in mine have suffused their flame, Like radiant stars. And I feel, beloved Muse, Thy perfumed breath flutter On my lips and on my eyes!  (He falls face on table.)   STELLA (approaching slowly).    Hoffmann? asleep...   NICKLAUSSE.    No, dead drunk. Too late, madame.   LINDORF.    Corbleu!   NICKLAUSSE.    Oh, here is the counselor, Lindorf, who awaits you.  (Stella keeps her eyes on Hoffmann and throws a flower at his feet as   she goes out with Lindorf.)   THE END.

Et là, près de cette porte, Sur un ivrogne qui dort!   HOFFMANN.  C'est vrai!... Ce coquin-là, pardieu! m'a fait envie! A boire!... et, comme lui, couchons dans le ruisseau.   HERMANN.

Il était une fois à la cour d'Eysenach Un petit avorton qui se nommait Klein-Zach! Il était coiffé d'un colbac, Et ses jambes faisaient clic, clac!     Clic, clac! Voilà Klein-Zach!   LE CHOEUR    Clic, clac!...   Voilà Klein-Zach!   HOFFMANN.  Il avait une bosse en guise d'estomac; Ses pieds ramifiés semblaient sortir d'un sac, Son nez était noir de tabac, Et sa tête faisait cric, crac,     Cric, crac, Voilà Klein-Zach.   LE CHOEUR.
