I will watch her and find out if I agree with you. I only noticed yesterday that she is remarkably pretty. I will ask her to walk home with me to-day and have tea. I should like to introduce her to mother.\"  \"Well, I never!\" said Hannah. \"And you really mean that you would introduce that girl to Mrs. Weldon?\"  \"I think so. Yes, I am almost certain. Here she comes. I like her face. Don't let her hear you giggling, please, Kate; it is very unkind to make a new girl feel uncomfortable.\"  Kate smothered a laugh and turned away. The doors of the school were now thrown open, and the girls disappeared by their special entrances.  It was just at that moment that Ruth in her shabby dress, but with her sweet and most beautiful face, joined the group of girls who were going into the school. She was without a companion. The other girls went in by twos, each clinging to her special crony. Cassandra now changed her position, and found herself within a yard or two of Ruth Craven. She was examining Ruth with great care, but not at all from the unkind point of view; hers was a sympathetic aspect. That little old serge dress made something come up in Cassandra's throat, and she longed beyond words to give her a better dress. Ruth's hat, too, left much to be desired. It was an old black sailor-hat, which had been burnt to a dull brown. But, notwithstanding the hat and the dress, there was the face. The face was most lovely, and the back of the shabby frock was covered by hair as black as jet, and curling and rippling in the sunshine.  \"What wouldn't every other girl in the school give to have such a face as that, and such hair as that?\" thought Cassandra. \"I must speak to her.\"  She was just bending forward, meaning to touch Ruth on her shoulder, when there came a commotion near the entrance, and the excited face of Alice Tennant came into view. Alice was accompanied by a tall, showily dressed girl. The girl had a very vivid color in her cheeks, intensely bright and roguish dark-blue eyes, light chestnut hair touched with gold--hair which was a mass of waves and tendrils and fluffiness, and on which a little dark-blue velvet cap was placed.  \"I am not going to be shy,\" cried the new-comer in a hearty, clear, loud voice with a considerable amount of brogue in it. \"Leave off clutching me by the arm, Alice, my honey, for see my new companions I will. Ah, what a crowd of girls!--colleens we call them in Ireland. Oh, glory! how am I ever to get the names of half of them round my tongue? Ah, and isn't that one a beauty?\"  \"Hush, Kathleen--do hush!\" said Alice. \"They will hear you.\"  \"And what do I care if they do, darling? It doesn't matter to me. I mean to talk to that girl; she's won my heart entirely.\"  Before Alice could prevent her, the Irish girl had sprung forward, pushed a couple of Great Shirley girls out of their places, and had taken Ruth Craven by the arm.  \"It's a kiss I'm going to give you, my beauty,\" she said. \"Oh, it's right glad I am to see you! My name is Kathleen O'Hara, and I hail from the ould country. Ah, though! it's lonely I'm likely to be, isn't it, deary? You don't deny me the pleasure of your society when I tell you that in all this vast crowd I stand solitary--solitary but for her; and, bedad! I'm not certain that I take to her at all. Let me tuck my hand inside your arm, sweetest.\"  A titter was heard from the surrounding girls. Ruth turned very red, then she looked into Kathleen's eyes.  \"You mean kindly,\" she said, \"but perhaps you had better not. You, too, are a stranger.\"  \"Are you a stranger?\" asked Kathleen. \"Then that clinches the matter. Ah, yes; it's lonely I am. I have come from my dear mountain home to be civilised; but civilisation will never suit Kathleen O'Hara. She isn't meant to have it. She's meant to dance on the tops of the mountains, and to gather flowers in the bogs. She's made to dance and joke and laugh, and to have a gay time. Ah! my people at home made a fine mistake when they sent me to be civilised. But I like you, honey. I like the shape of your face, and the way you are made, and the wonderful look in your eyes when you glance round at me. It is you and me will be the finest of friends, sha'n't we?\"  Before Ruth could reply the girls had entered the great hall, which presently became quite full.  \"Don't let go of me, darling, for the life of you. It's lost I'd be in a place of this sort. Let me clutch on to you until they put me into the lowest place in the school.\"  \"But why so?\" asked Ruth, glancing at her tall companion in some astonishment. \"Don't you know anything?\"  \"I? Never a bit, darling. I don't suppose they'll keep me here. I have no learning, and I never want to have any, and what's more--\"  \"Hush, girls! No talking,\" called the indignant voice of a form-room mistress.  Kathleen's dark-blue eyes grew round with laughter. She suddenly dropped a curtsy.  \"Mum's the word, ma'am,\" she said, and then she glanced round at her numerous companions.  The girls had all been watching her. Their faces broke into smiles, the smiles became titters, and the titters roars. The mistress had again to come forward and ask what was wrong.  \"It's only me, miss,\" said Kathleen, \"so don't blame any of the other innocent lambs. I'm fresh from old Ireland. Oh, miss, it's a beautiful country! Were you never there? If you could only behold her purple mountains, and let yourself go on the bosom of her rushing streams! Were you ever in the old country, miss, if I might venture to ask a civil question?\"  \"No,\" said Miss Atherton in a very suppressing tone. \"I don't understand impertinent questions, and I expect the schoolgirls to be orderly.--Ah, Ruth Craven! Will you take this young lady under your wing?\"  \"Didn't I say we were to be mates, dear?\" said Kathleen O'Hara; and as they passed from the great hall, Kathleen's hand was still fondly linked on Ruth's arm.     CHAPTER III.  THE WILD IRISH GIRL.   Lessons went on in their usual orderly fashion. At eleven o'clock there was a break for a quarter of an hour. The girls streamed into the playground. The playground was very large, and was asphalted, and in consequence quite dry and pleasant to walk on. There was a field just beyond, and into this field the girls now strolled by twos and twos. Kathleen O'Hara clung to Ruth Craven's arm; she kept talking to her and asking her questions.  \"You needn't reply unless you like, pet,\" she said. \"All I want is just to look into your face. I adore beauty; I worship it more than anything else on earth. I was brought up in the midst of it. I never saw anything uglier than poor old Towser when he broke his leg and cut his upper jaw; but although he was ugly, he was the darling of my heart. He died, and I cried a lot. I can't quite get over it. Yes, I suppose I am uncivilised, and I never want to be anything else. Do you think I want to copy those nimby-pimby girls over there, or that lot, or that?\"  \"You had better not point, please, Miss O'Hara,\" said Ruth. \"They won't like it.\"  \"What do I care whether they like it or not?\" said Kathleen. \"I wasn't brought here to curry favor with them. What would my darling father say if I told him that I was going to curry favor with the girls of the Great Shirley School? And what would mother say? No, no; I may pick up a few smatterings, or I may not, but there is one thing certain: I mean to make a friend of you, Ruth--yes, a great big bosom friend. You will be fond of me, won't you?\"  \"I like you now,\" said Ruth. \"I know you are kind, and you are very pretty.\"  \"Why, then, darling,\" said Kathleen, \"is it the Blarney Stone you have kissed? You have a sweet little voice of your own, although it hasn't the dear touch of the brogue that I miss so in all the other girls.\"  \"But you like Miss Tennant don't you?\" said Ruth.  \"Oh, yes. Poor little Alice! She's very reserved and very, very formal, but she's a good soul, and I won't worry her. But you are the one my heart has gone out to. Ah! that is the way of Irish hearts. They go straight out to their kindred spirits. You are a kindred spirit of mine, Ruth Craven, and you can't get away from me, not even if you will.\"  The fifteen minutes for recreation came to an end, and the girls returned to the schoolroom. Ruth was in a high class for her age, and was already absorbed in her work. Kathleen drummed with her fingers on her desk and looked round her. Kathleen was in a low class; she was with girls a great deal smaller and younger than herself.  \"How old are you, Miss O'Hara?\" the English teacher, Miss Dove, had said.  \"I am fifteen, bless your heart, darling!\" replied Kathleen.  \"Don't talk exactly like that,\" said Miss Dove, who, in spite of herself, was attracted by the sweet voice and sweeter eyes. \"Say, 'I am fifteen, Miss Dove.'\"  Kathleen made a grimace. Her grimace was so comical that all the small girls in the class burst out laughing. She was silent.  \"Speak, dear,\" said Miss Dove in a persuasive tone.  \"Yes, darling, I'm trying to.\"  \"You mustn't use affectionate words in school.\"  \"Oh, my heart! How am I to bear it?\" said Kathleen, and she clasped a white hand over that organ.  Miss Dove paused for a moment, and then decided that she would let the question in dispute go by for the present. She began to question Kathleen as to her acquirements, and found that she must leave her with the younger children for the time being. She then went on to attend to other duties.  Kathleen sat bolt-upright in the centre of the class. It seemed absurd to see this tall, well-grown girl surrounded by tiny tots. One of the tiny tots looked towards her. Presently she thrust out a moist little hand, and out of the moisture produced a half-melted peppermint drop. Just for a second Kathleen's bright eyes"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15839"],["title","The Rebel of the School (#4)"],["body","upon the sweetmeat with disgust; then she took it up gingerly and popped it into her mouth.  \"It's golloptious,\" she said, turning to the child, and then she drummed her fingers once more on the edge of the desk. Presently she stooped down and whispered to this small girl:  \"I hate school; don't you?\"  \"Y--es,\" was the timid reply.  \"Let's go out.\"  \"But I--I can't.\"  \"I must, then. I have nothing to do; the lessons are deadly stupid. Forgive me, girls; you are all blameless;\" and the next moment she had left the room.  Half a moment later she was in the fresh air outside. Her cheeks were hot, her hair in disorder, and her hand, where she had touched the peppermint, was sticky.\"  \"What would father say if he could see me now?\" she thought. \"If Aunty O'Flynn was to look at her Kathleen! Oh, why did they send me across the cold sea to a place of this sort--a detestable place? Oh, the fresh air is reviving. I was born free, and Britons never, never will be slaves. I can't stay in that horrid room. Oh, how long the morning is!\"  Just then a teacher came out and beckoned to Kathleen.  \"What are you doing outside, Miss O'Hara? Come in immediately and return to your class.\"  \"I can't dear,\" replied Kathleen in a gentle tone. \"You are young, aren't you? You don't look more than twenty. Do you ever feel your heart beat wild, dear, and your spirits all in a sort of throb? And did you, when you were like that, submit to being tied up in steel chains all round every bit of you? Answer me: did you?\"  \"I can't answer you, Miss O'Hara. You are a very naughty, rebellious girl. You have come to school to be disciplined. Go back immediately.\"  For a minute Kathleen thought of rebelling, but then she said to herself, \"It isn't worth the fuss,\" and returned to her place once again in the centre of the class.  \"I have been called back,\" she said in a whisper to her little peppermint companion. \"I was naughty to go out, and I am called back. I am in disgrace. Isn't it a lark?\"  The little girl felt quite excited. Never was there such and big and fascinating inmate of the lower fifth before. It was worth coming to school now to be in the vicinity of one so handsome and so gay.  The weary morning came to an end at last. The girls seldom returned for afternoon school, generally doing their preparations at home. Alice Tennant, however, sometimes preferred the quiet school to the noisy life she lived with her brothers at home. She looked now eagerly for Kathleen, who had shunned her from the instant they had entered the school; she stood just by the gate waiting for her. Kathleen, on her part, was looking for Ruth Craven. Ruth had been monopolised by Cassandra Weldon.  \"You must come home with me,\" she said.  \"But my grandparents will be expecting me,\" said Ruth.  \"Never mind; we will go round by your cottage and ask them. I know all about you, and I want to know you better. You will, won't you?\"  \"Thank you very much,\" said Ruth.  \"We will go on at once without waiting for the others,\" said Cassandra, and they walked on quickly, while Kathleen searched in vain for her chosen friend.  \"Come, Kathleen; I am waiting,\" said Alice in a slightly cross voice. \"Mother said we were to be home early to-day.\"  \"All right,\" said Kathleen; \"but I can't find Miss Craven anywhere.  \"You can't wait for her now. Indeed, she has gone. I saw her walking down the road with Cassandra Weldon.\"  \"And who is she?\"  \"The head girl of the school; and such a splendid creature! I am glad she is taking up Ruth. It isn't possible for every one to notice her; although, for my part, I have no patience with that sort of false pride. Of course, a lot of the foundation girls are very common; but when one sees a perfect lady like Ruth one ought to recognize her.\"  \"Of course,\" said Kathleen, fidgeting a little as she walked.  \"And how did you get on?\" asked Alice, noticing the dejected tone of her voice.  \"I got on abominably,\" said Kathleen.  \"What class are you in?\"  \"I don't know. I am with a lot of babies; I suppose I am to be a sort of caretaker to them. There wasn't anything to learn. I am going to write to father. I can't stay in that horrid school.\"  \"Oh, yes, you can. You will get to like it very much after a time. You have never been at school before, and of course you find it irksome.\"  \"Is it irksome?\" cried Kathleen. \"Is it that she calls it? Oh, glory! It's purgatory, my dear, that's what it is--purgatory--and I haven't done anything to deserve it.\"  \"But you want to learn; you don't want to be always ignorant.\"  \"Bedad, then, darling, I don't want to learn at all. What do I want to know your sort of things for? I could beat you, every one of you, and the teachers, too, in some accomplishments. Put me on a horse, darling, and see what I can do; and put me in a boat, pet, and find out where I can take you. And set me swimming in the cold sea; I can turn somersaults and dive and dance on the waves, and do every mortal thing as though I were a fish, not a girl. And give me a gun and see me bring down a bird on the wing. Ah! those things ought to be counted in the education of a woman. I can do all those things, and I can mix whisky punch, and I can sing songs to the dear old dad, and I can comfort my mother when her rheumatics are bad. And I can love, love, love! Oh, no, Alice, I am not ignorant in the true sense; but I hate French, and I hate arithmetic, and I hate all your horrid school work. And I never could spell properly; and what does it matter?\"  \"Everything,\" replied Alice. \"You can't go about the world if you are stupid and ignorant.\"  \"Can't I?\" exclaimed Kathleen, and she flashed her eyes at Alice and made her feel, as she said afterwards, quite uncanny.  The Tennants were, after all, not a large family. They consisted of Mrs. Tennant, Alice, and two young brothers. These brothers were schoolboys of the unruly type. Alice considered them very badly trained. Kathleen, however, was much taken by their schoolboyish ways.  As the two girls now entered the house they heard a whistle proceeding from the attic; a cat-call at the same time came from the basement.  \"Oh, dear!\" cried Alice, \"there are those dreadful boys again. Whatever you do, Kathleen, you must not encourage them in their larks.\"  \"But why shouldn't I? I like them both. I call David a broth of a boy. I am glad you have got brothers, Alice. I haven't any; but then I have lots of boy cousins, which comes to much the same thing.\"  The girls by this time had reached the large bedroom which they shared on the first floor.  \"You are welcome to my brothers if you don't toss all your things about in my room,\" cried Alice. \"If we are to sleep together we must be orderly.\"  \"Orderly, is it?\" cried Kathleen. \"I don't know the meaning of the word. Well, all right, I'm ready.\"  She pushed her fingers through her tangled golden hair, and, without glancing at herself in the glass, marched out of the room.  \"I wish mother hadn't asked her to come,\" said Alice to herself. \"The house was bad enough before, but now she will make things past bearing.\"  Alice went downstairs to the sound of a cracked gong. The Tennants had their meals in a sitting-room on the second floor. It was barely furnished, and had kamptulicon instead of a carpet on the floor. Mrs. Tennant, looking careworn and anxious, was seated at the head of the table; her dress was somewhat faded. Alice entered and took her seat at the foot. Kathleen was nowhere to be seen.  \"I have only soup and fish for dinner to-day,\" said Mrs. Tennant. \"I do trust Kathleen will be satisfied.\"  Alice frowned at her mother in some displeasure.  \"We ought to have meat--\" she was beginning, when there came a bang and a scuffle, a girlish laugh, and Kathleen, leaning fondly on both the boys, appeared. Mrs. Tennant pointed to a seat, and she sat down. The Irish girl had a healthy appetite, and was indifferent to what she ate. She demanded two plates of soup, and when she had finished the second she looked at Mrs. Tennant and said emphatically:  \"I have fallen in love.\"  \"My dear Kathleen!\"  \"I have--with a girl, so it doesn't matter. She's the prettiest, sweetest, bonniest thing I ever saw in my life. I am going to hunt round for her immediately after dinner. I thought I'd say so, for I mean to do it.\"  \"Oh, Kathleen!\" said Alice in a distressed voice, \"you really mustn't. You must come back to the school with me. I promised Miss Dove that I'd see you through your tasks.--You know, mother,\" continued Alice, \"Kathleen is not very advanced for her age, and Miss Dove wants to get her into a proper class as quickly as possible; therefore she is to be coached a little, and I have undertaken to do it.--You will come with me, Kathleen? I must get back to the school again by half-past two. You will be sure to come, dear?\"  \"I think not, dear,\" replied Kathleen in her most aggravating tone.  \"But you must.--Mustn't she, mother?\"  \"You ought to, Kathleen,\" said Mrs. Tennant. \"You have been sent here to learn. Alice can teach you; she can help you very much. She means to be very kind to you. You certainly ought to do what she suggests.\"  \"But I am afraid,\" said Kathleen, \"that I am not going to do what I ought. I don't wish to be good at all to-day. I couldn't live if I wasn't really naughty sometimes. I mean to be terribly naughty all the afternoon. If you will let me have my fling, I do assure you, Mrs. Tennant, that I will work off the steam, and will be all right to-morrow. I must do something desperate, and if Alice opposes me I'll have to do something worse.\"  \"You are a clipper!\" said David Tennant, smiling into her face.  \"All right, my boy; I expect I am,\" said Kathleen; and then she added, springing to her feet, \"I have eaten enough, and for what we have received--Good-bye, Mrs. Tennant; I'm off.\"     CHAPTER IV.  THE HOME-SICK AND THE REBELLIOUS.   Kathleen O'Hara ran up to an untidy room. She banged-to the door, and standing by it for a moment, drew the bolt."]]]
