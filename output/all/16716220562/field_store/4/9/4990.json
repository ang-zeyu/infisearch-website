But Ferrar wrote an epitaph for him:--      \"Under this tomb the matchless Digby lies,     Digby the great, the valiant, and the wise,\" etc.  The Great Fire destroyed the tomb, and scattered their ashes.  He had died poor; and his surviving son John, with whom he had been on bad terms, declared that all the property that came to him was his father's sumptuously compiled history of the Digby family. Apparently John regained some part of the estates later, which perhaps had only been left away from him to pay off debts. A great library of Sir Kenelm's was still in Paris; and after his death it was claimed by the French king, and sold for 10,000 crowns. His kinsman, the second Earl of Bristol, bought it, and joined it to his own; and the catalogue of the combined collection, sold in London in 1683, is an interesting and too little tapped source for Digby's mental history. Of his five children, three were already dead. Kenelm, his eldest son, had fallen at St. Neot's, in 1648, fighting for the King. It was his remaining son John who sanctioned the publication of his father's receipts.         *       *       *       *       *  Sir Kenelm Digby has been recognised as the type of the great amateur, but always with a shaking of the head. Why this scorn of accomplished amateurs? Rather may their tribe increase, let us pray. Our world languisheth now for lack of them. He was fitted by nature to play the rôle superbly, to force his circumstances, never over pliant, to serve not his material interests, but his fame, his craving for universal knowledge and attainments. Says Wood: \"His person was handsome and gigantick, and nothing was wanting to make him a compleat Cavalier. He had so graceful elocution and noble address that had he been dropped out of the clouds into any part of the world, he would have made himself respected; but the Jesuits who cared not for him, spoke spitefully, and said it was true, but then he must not stay there above six weeks. He had a great faculty, which proceeded from abundance of wit and invention, of proposing and reporting matters to the Virtuosi.\"  Women adored him; and he took great pains to please them--though in spite of the importunities of Marie de Médicis, the long friendship with Henrietta Maria, his early flirtation with the lovely Spaniard, his earnest and impolitic championship of the notorious Lady Purbeck--Romish convert and adventuress--Venetia, it seems, remained his only love. He was never the mere gallant. He treated women as his intellectual equals, but as equals who had to be splendidly entertained and amused. His conversation was \"ingeniose and innocent.\" Lloyd speaks of \"the grace wherewith he could relate _magnarum rerum minutias_, the little circumstances of great matters.\" But men were at his feet as well; and on his tour among Italian courts, one of the grandees said that, \"having no children, he was very willing his wife should bring him a Prince by Sir Kenelme, whom he imagined the just measure of perfection.\"  A first-rate swordsman, yet was he \"not apt in the least to give offence.\" His strength was that of a giant. Bristol related that one day at Sherborne he took up \"a midling man,\" chair and all, with one arm. But there was nothing of the swashbuckler about him, and his endless vitality was matched by his courtesy. True, he hustled a Pope; but he addressed the Short Parliament in such reverential terms as no Roundhead could have found. One who had been courtier, exile, naval commander, student, prisoner, and diplomatist, who had associated with all sorts of persons, from kings to alchemists and cooks, had learnt resourcefulness. But he was never too hard put to it perhaps, seeing that \"if he had not fourpence, wherever he came he would find respect and credit.\" \"No man knew better how to abound, and to be abased, and either was indifferent to him.\"  He had his detractors. One who plays so many parts incites envy and ridicule; and he laid himself particularly open to both. Fantasy was in the Digby blood; and that agility of mind and nerve that turns now here, now there, to satisfy an unquenchable curiosity, that exuberance of mental spirits that forces to rapid and continuous expression, has ever been suspect of the English mind. He was \"highly caressed in France.\" To Evelyn Sir Kenelm was a \"teller of strange things,\" and again the Diarist called him \"an errant mountebank\"--though Evelyn sought his society, and was grateful for its stimulus. Lady Fanshawe, who met him at Calais, at the Governor's table, says he \"enlarged somewhat more in extraordinary stories than might be averred.... That was his infirmity, though otherwise a person of most excellent parts, and a very fine bred gentleman.\" \"A certain eccentricity and unsteadiness perhaps inseparable from a mind of such vanity,\" is Lodge's criticism. \"The Pliny of our age for lying,\" quoth Stubbes. But Digby's extraordinary stories were by no means all false. He may have talked sometimes to _épater le bourgeois;_ but his serious statements were often judged as were the wonders of evolution by country audiences in the seventies.  His offence was he must always be talking. His ideas he must share, expound, illustrate, whether or no they were ripe. It is the sign-manual of the sincere amateur. His books are probably but the lees of his conversation. He was not, in the first place, a literary person. His _Memoirs_ are good reading for those with a touch of the fantastic in themselves; but the average literary critic will dub them rhodomontade. His scientific and controversial treatises, not at all unreadable, and full of strange old lore, survive as curiosities never to be reprinted. Nevertheless, his temper was distinctly scientific, and if his exact discoveries be limited to observing the effect of oxygen on plant-life, and his actual invention to a particular kind of glass bottle, yet he was an eager student and populariser of the work of Bacon, Galileo, and Harvey; and his laboratories were the nursing grounds of the new experimental philosophy.  With a distinctly rationalistic temper, he was yet a faithful, if independent, son of the Roman Church. He speaks sometimes as if he regarded the Church as the great storehouse of necessary authority for the intellectually feeble; but he accepted the main dogmas himself, being satisfied of them by intuition and reason. Protestantism, he held, was not for the ordinary person, considering \"the natural imbecility of man's wits and understandings.\" His piety was a thing apart, a matter of heredity perhaps, and of his poetic temperament. I have heard him called by that abused name, \"mystic.\" He was nothing of the sort, and he said so in memorable words. As an act of devotion he translated the _Adhering to God_ of Albertus Magnus. In the dedication to his mother he compares himself, as the translator of this mystic treatise, to certain travellers who \"speak upon hearsay of countries they were never in.\" \"The various course in the world that I have runne myself out of breath in, hath afforded me little means for solid recollection.\" Yet was he now and then upon the threshold. With streaks of the quack and adventurer in him, he gave out deep notes. Says Lloyd: \"His soul [was] one of those few souls that understand themselves.\"  With an itch to use his pen as well as his tongue, he had none of the patience, the hankering after perfection of form, of the professional man of letters. His account of his Scanderoon exploit, a sea-log, a little written-up later, was perhaps not meant for publication. It did not see the light till 1868. His _Memoirs_ were written, he says, \"for my own recreation, and then continued and since preserved only for my own private content--to please myself in looking back upon my past and sweet errors.\" He even begs those who may come upon the MS. \"to convert these blotted sheets into a clear flame.\" His commentary on the _Faëry Queen_ stanza was thrown off in a hurry. \"The same Discourse I made upon it the first half quarter of an hour that I saw it, I send you there, without having reduced it to any better form, or added anything at all to it.\" And so for the better-known and interesting _Observations on 'Religio Medici.'_ Browne reproached him for his review of a pirated edition. Digby replied he had never authorised its publication, written as it was in twenty-four hours, which included his procuring and reading the book--a truly marvellous _tour de force_; for the thing is still worth perusal. He was always the improvisor--ready, brilliant, vivid, imperfect. He must give vent to the ideas that came upon him in gusts. \"The impressions which creatures make upon me,\" he says, \"are like boisterous winds.\" He fully recognised his own limitations. \"I pretend not to learning,\" he declares, with exaggerated modesty. Amateur and improviser of genius, let us praise him as such. The spacious, generous minds that can find room for all the ideas and culture of an epoch are never numerous enough. There is no one like such amateurs for bridging two ages; and Digby, with one hand in Lilly's and the other in Bacon's, joins the mediæval to the modern world. Nor is a universal amateur a genius who has squandered his powers; but a man exercising his many talents in the only way possible to himself, and generally with much entertainment and stimulus to others. It was Ben Jonson, too great a man to be one of his detractors on this score, who wrote of him:      \"He is built like some imperial room     For that[1] to dwell in, and be still at home.     His breast is a brave palace, a broad street,     Where all heroic ample thoughts do meet;     Where nature such a large survey hath ta'en     As other souls to his, dwelt in a lane.\"  [Footnote 1: All virtue.]  There was nothing singular in his interest in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16441"],["title","The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened (#5)"],["body","and alchemy. Lilly and Booker, both of them among his acquaintances, were ordered to attend the parliamentary army at the siege of Colchester, \"to encourage the soldiers with predictions of speedy victory.\" Still--though he believed in greater absurdities--his attitude towards such matters was that of his chosen motto, _Vacate et Videte._ \"To rely too far upon that vaine art I judge to be rather folly than impiety.\" As with regard to spirits and witches, he says, \"I only reserve my assent.\" That he was not altogether absorbed in the transmutation of metals in his laboratory practice, and yet that he dabbled in it, makes him historically interesting. In him better than in Newton do we realise the temper of the early members of the Royal Society. In this tale of his other activities I have not forgotten _The Closet Opened_. Of all Digby's many interests the most constant and permanent was medicine. How to enlarge the span of man's life was a problem much meditated on in his age. We have seen how Descartes's mind ran on it; and in Bacon's _Natural History_ there is reference to a 'book of the prolongation of life.' In spite of what is written on his Janssen hermit portrait--_Saber morir la mayor hazanza_--Digby loved life. His whole exuberant career is a pæan to life, for itself and its great chances, and because \"it giveth the leave to vent and boyle away the unquietnesses and turbulences that follow our passions.\" To prolong life, fortify it, clarify it, was a noble pursuit, and he set out on it as a youth under the tuition of the 'good parson of Lindford. His _Physick and Chirurgery_ receipts, published by Hartman, are many of them incredible absurdities, not unfrequently repulsive; but when we compare them with other like books of the time, they fit into a natural and not too fantastic place. Sir Thomas Browne was laughing at Digby, but not at Digby alone, in the passage in _Vulgar Errors_--\"when for our warts we rub our hands before the moon, or commit any maculated part unto the touch of the dead.\" Sir Kenelm gathered his receipts on all his roads through Europe, noted them down, made them up with his own hands, and administered them to his friends. In Hartman's _Family Physician_ is given \"An experienced Remedy against the Falling Sicknes, wherewith Sir K. Digby cur'd a Minister's Son at Franckfort in Germany, in the year 1659.\" It begins, \"Take the Skull of a Man that died of a Violent Death.\" (Hartman says he helped to prepare the ghastly concoction.) I have already noted how he doctored his beautiful wife's complexion; and how he was called in to cure Howell's wound. In a poetic tribute he is referred to as:      \"Hee, that all med'cines can exactly make,     And freely give them.\"  Evelyn records how Digby \"advised me to try and digest a little better, and gave me a water which he said was only raine water of the autumnal equinox exceedingly rectified, and smelt like _aqua fortis_.\"  Here, at last, we have come to the end of Sir Kenelm the amateur. If he was an empiric, so were all the doctors of his time; and he may be described as a professional unpaid physician who carried on a frequently interrupted practice. That he did not publish his receipts himself does not reflect on his own idea of their importance. They had a wide circulation among his friends. And, as I have pointed out, he never showed great eagerness to publish. Such works as appeared in his lifetime were evidently printed at the request of learned societies, or by friends to whom they were dedicated, or by White.  The distance between the healer and the cook has grown to be immense in recent times. The College of Physicians and Mary Jane in the kitchen are not on nodding terms--though one sees faint signs of an effort to bridge the wide gap. But in the seventeenth century the gap can hardly be said to have existed at all. At the back of the doctor is plainly seen the figure of the herbalist and simpler, who appear again prominently in the still-room and the kitchen, by the side of great ladies and great gentlemen, bent on making the best and the most of the pleasures of the table no doubt, but quite as much on the maintenance of health as of hospitality. Simpler, herbalist, doctor, distiller, cook--Digby was all of them, and all of them with the utmost seriousness; nor in this was he in the least singular. The great Bacon was deeply concerned with such cares, though in certain of his recommendations, such as: \"To provide always an apt break-fast,\" to take this every morning, not to forget to take that twice a month, one may read more of the valetudinarian than in Digby. _The Closet Opened_ is but one of an interesting series of books of the kind, which have been too much neglected by students of seventeenth-century manners and lore and language. Did not W.J. issue the Countess of Kent's _Choice Manual of Physic and Chirurgey_, with directions for Preserving and Candying? Patrick, Lord Ruthven's _Ladies' Cabinet Opened_ appeared in 1639 and 1655. Nor was it only the _cuisine_ of the nobles that roused interest. One of the curiosities of the time is _The Court and Kitchen of Elizabeth, commonly called Joan Cromwell, the Wife of the Late Usurper Truly Described and Represented and now made Publick for general Satisfaction,_ 1644. The preface is scurrilous beyond belief. Compiled from the gossip of servants, it is meant to cast ridicule on the housekeeping of the Protector's establishment. But the second part is a sober collection of by no means very penurious recipes from Joan's own kitchen books.  Hartman, his steward, made an excellent thing out of Digby's receipts--though the publishing of _The Closet Opened_ was not his doing, I think. His _Choice and Experimented Receipts in Physick and Chirurgery_ had already appeared in 1668, which suggested to some other hanger-on of the Digby household that John Digby's consent might be obtained for printing Sir Kenelm's culinary as well as his medical note-books. Hartman followed up this new track with persistence and profit to himself. As a mild example of the \"choice and experimented,\" I transcribe \"An Approved Remedy for Biting of a Mad Dog\": \"Take a quart of Ale, and a dram of Treacle, a handful of Rue, a spoonful of shavings or filings of Tin. Boil all these together, till half be consumed. Take of this two spoonfuls in the morning, and at night cold. It is excellent for Man or Beast.\" I need not continue. The receipts are there for curious searchers. They were applied to aristocratic patients; and they are no more absurd or loathsome than those of other books of the time and kind. Even Bacon is fantastic enough with his \"Grains of Youth\" and \"Methusalem Water.\" In 1682, George Hartman published, \"for the Publike Good,\" _The True Preserver and Restorer of Health_. It is dedicated to the Countess of Sunderland, and is described as \"the collection for the most part (which I had hitherto reserved) of your incomparable kinsman and my truly Honourable Master, Sir Kenelm Digby, whom I had the Honour to serve for many years beyond the Seas, as well as in England; and so continued with him till his dying Day, and of whose Generosity and Bounty I have sufficiently tasted, and no less of your illustrious Fathers, both before and after my Glorious Masters Decease.\" Of this book he says, \"The world hath not yet seen such another Piece.\" Commend me to the forthright methods of seventeenth century advertisement! In the second part, \"Excellent Directions for Cookery,\" _The Closet Opened_ was largely drawn on. In 1696 appeared _The Family Physician_, by George Hartman, Phylo-Chymist ... who liv'd and Travell'd with the Honourable Sir Kenelm Digby in several parts of Europe, the space of Seven Years till he died. This other choice compilation owes much to the \"incomparable\" one, and is described as \"the marrow of collections.\"  But Hartman is not the only witness to Digby's connoisseurship in the joint mysteries. Better to my mind than even Hartman's are the style and the spirit of Master May. In 1660 appeared _The Accomplisht Cook,_ or the Art and Mystery of Cookery ... approved by the fifty years experience and industry of Robert May, in his attendance on Several Persons of Honour. It is dedicated to Lord Lumley, Lord Lovelace, Sir Wm. Paston, Sir Kenelme Digby, and Sir Frederick Cornwallis, \"so well known to the Nation for their admired Hospitalities,\" and generally to                            \"the race     Of those that for the Gusto stand,     Whose tables a whole Ark command     Of Nature's plentie.\"  \"He is an Alien, a meer Stranger in England that hath not been acquainted with your generous housekeeping; for my own part, my more particular Tyes of Service to you, my Honoured Lords, have built me up to the height of this experience.\" His preface is a heartrending cry of regret for the good old times before usurping Parliaments banished splendidly extravagant gentlemen across the seas, \"those golden days of Peace and Hospitality, when you enjoy'd your own, so as to entertain and relieve others ... those golden days wherein were practised the Triumphs and Trophies of Cookery, then was Hospitality esteemed and Neighbourhood preserved, the Poor cherished and God honoured; then was Religion less talk't on and more practis't, then was Atheism and Schisme less in Fashion, and then did men strive to be good rather than to seem so.\" High-souled were the _chefs_ of the seventeenth century!  The 1669 edition of _The Closet Opened_ is evidently the first. The interleaved example mentioned in the Catalogue of the Digby Library is of the same date. Whoever prepared it for the press and wrote the egregious preface \"To the Reader\"--Hartman, or as I think, another--gave it the title; but it was a borrowed one. Some years earlier, in 1655, had appeared _The Queen's Closet Opened, Incomparable Secrets which were presented unto the Queen by the most Experienced Persons of the Times, many wherof were had in"]]]
