This     was more than sufficient to enflame the lively imagination of Mr. D.     and to decide him to visit, in person, a country already explored by a     great number of his countrymen; but he conceived that his narrative     should embody other topics than those which ordinarily appeared in the     text of his predecessors.      \"His work then is not only a description of castles, towns, churches,     public monuments of every kind:--it is not only a representation of     the general aspect of the country, as to its picturesque     appearances--but it is an extended, minute, though occasionally     inexact, account of public and private libraries; with reflections     upon certain customs of the country, and upon the character of those     who inhabit it. It is in short the personal history of the author,     throughout the whole length of his journey. Not the smallest incident,     however indifferent, but what has a place in the letters of the     Bibliographer. Thus, he mentions every Inn where he stops: recommends     or scolds the landlord--according to his civility or exaction. Has the     author passed a bad night? the reader is sure to know it on the     following morning. On the other hand, has he had a good night's rest     in a comfortable bed? [dans un lit _comfortable_?] We are as sure to     know this also, as soon as he awakes:--and thus far we are relieved     from anxiety about the health of the traveller. Cold and heat--fine     weather and bad weather--every variation of atmosphere is scrupulously     recorded.  What immediately follows, is unworthy of M. Licquet; because it not only implies a charge of a heinous description--accusing me of an insidious intrusion into domestic circles, a violation of confidence, and a systematic derision of persons and things--but because the French translator, exercising that sense and shrewdness which usually distinguish him, MUST have known that such a charge _could_ not have been founded in FACT. He must have known that any gentleman, leaving England with those letters which brought me in contact with some of the first circles on the Continent, MUST have left it without leaving his character _behind_ him; and that such a character could not, in the natural order of things--seen even through the sensitive medium of a French critic--have been guilty of the grossness and improprieties imputed to me by M. Licquet. I treat therefore this \"damnation in wholesale\" with scorn and contempt: and hasten to impress the reader with a more favourable opinion of my Norman translator. He _will_ have it that      \"the English Traveller's imagination is lively and ardent--and his     spirit, that of raillery and lightness. He examines as he runs along;     that is to say, he does not give himself time to examine; he examines     ill; he deceives himself; and he subjects his readers to be deceived     with him. He traverses, at a hard trot, one of the most ancient towns     in France; puts his head out of his carriage window--and boldly     decides that the town is of the time of Francis I.\"![9] p. xviij.  There is pleasantry, and perhaps some little truth, in this vein of observation; and it had been better, perhaps, for the credit of the good taste and gentleman-like feeling of Mons. Licquet, if he had uniformly maintained his character in these respects. I have however, in the subsequent pages,[10] occasionally grappled with my annotator in proving the fallacy, or the want of charity, of many of his animadversions: and the reader probably may not be displeased, if, by way of \"avant propos,\" I indulge him here with a specimen of them--taken from his preface. M. Licquet says, that I \"create scenes; arrange a drama; trace characters; imagine a dialogue, frequently in French--and in what French--gracious God!--in assigning to postilions a ridiculous language, and to men of the world the language of postilions.\" These be sharp words:[11] but what does the Reader imagine may be the probable \"result\" of the English Traveller's inadvertencies?... A result, (\"gracious Heaven!\") very little anticipated by the author. Let him ponder well upon the awful language which ensues. \"What (says M. Licquet) will quickly be the result, with us, of such indiscretions as those of which M. Dibdin is guilty? The necessity of SHUTTING OUR PORTS, or at least of placing a GUARD UPON OUR LIPS!\" There is some consolation however left for me, in balancing this tremendous denunciation by M. Licquet's eulogy of my good qualities--which a natural diffidence impels me to quote in the original words of their author.      \"A Dieu ne plaise, toutefois, que j'accuse ici LE COEUR de M. Dibdin.     Je n'ai jamais eu l'honneur de le voir: je ne le connais que par ses     ecrits; principalement par son _Splendid Tour_, et je ne balance pas à     déclarer que l'auteur doit être doué d'une ame honnête, et de ces     qualités fondamentales qui constituent l'homme de bien. Il préfère sa     croyance; mais il respecte la croyance des autres; son érudition     parait....[12] variée. Son amour pour les antiquités est immense; et     par antiquités j'entends ici tout ce qui est _antique_ ou seulement     _ancien_, quellesque soient d'ailleurs la nature et la forme des     objets.\" Pref. p. xv. xvij.  Once more; and to conclude with M. Licquet. After these general observations upon the _Text_ of the Tour, M. Licquet favours us with the following--upon the _Plates_. \"These plates (says he) are intended to represent some of the principal monuments; the most beautiful landscapes, and the most remarkable persons, comprehending even the servants of an inn. If _talent_ be sought in these Engravings, it will doubtless be found in them; but strangers must not seek for _fidelity_ of representation from what is before their eyes. The greater number of the Designs are, in some sort, ideal compositions, which, by resembling every thing, resemble nothing in particular: and it is worthy of remark that the Artist, in imitation of the Author, seems to have thought that he had only to shew himself _clever_, without troubling himself to be _faithful_.\" To this, I reply in the very words of M. Licquet himself: \"the decision is severe; luckily it is unjust.\" The only portions of the designs of their skilful author, which may be taxed with a tendency to extravagance, are the _groups_: which, when accompanied by views of landscapes, or of monuments, are probably too profusely indulged in; but the _individuals_, constituting those groups, belong precisely to the _country_ in which they are represented. In the first and second volumes they are _French_; in the third they are _Germans_--all over. Will M. Licquet pretend to say that the churches, monasteries, streets, and buildings, with which the previous Edition of this Tour is so elaborately embellished, have the slightest tendency to IMAGINED SCENERY? If he do, his optics must be peculiarly his own. I have, in a subsequent page, (p. 34, note) slightly alluded to the cost and risk attendant on the Plates; but I may confidently affirm, from experience, that two thirds of the expense incurred would have secured the same sale at the same price. However, the die is cast; and the voice of lamentation is fruitless.  I now come to the consideration of M. Licquet's coadjutor, M. CRAPELET. Although the line of conduct pursued by that very singular gentleman be of an infinitely more crooked description than that of his Predecessor, yet, in this place, I shall observe less respecting it; inasmuch as, in the subsequent pages, (pp. 209, 245, 253, 400, &c.) the version and annotations of M. Crapelet have been somewhat minutely discussed. Upon the SPIRIT which could give rise to such a version, and such annotations, I will here only observe, that it very much resembles that of searchers of our street-pavements; who, with long nails, scrape out the dirt from the interstices of the stones, with the hope of making a discovery of some lost treasure which may compensate the toil of perseverance. The love of lucre may, or may not, have influenced my Parisian translator; but the love of discovery of latent error, and of exposure of venial transgression, has undoubtedly, from beginning to end, excited his zeal and perseverance. That carping spirit, which shuts its eyes upon what is liberal and kind, and withholds its assent to what is honourable and just, it is the distinguished lot--and, perhaps, as the translator may imagine, the distinguished felicity--of M. Crapelet to possess. Never was greater reluctance displayed in admitting even the palpable truths of a text, than what is displayed in the notes of M. Crapelet: and whenever a concurring sentiment comes from him, it seems to exude like his heart's life-blood. Having already answered, in detail, his separate publication confined to my 30th Letter[13]--(the 8th of the second volume, in _this_ edition) and having replied to those animadversions which appear in his translation of the whole of the second volume, in this edition--it remains here only to consign the Translator to the careful and impartial consideration of the Reader, who, it is requested, may be umpire between both parties. Not to admit that the text of this Edition is in many places improved, from the suggestions of my Translators, by corrections of \"Names of Persons, Places, and Things,\" would be to betray a stubbornness or obtuseness of feeling which certainly does not enter into the composition of its author.  I now turn, not without some little anxiety, yet not wholly divested of the hope of a favourable issue, to the character and object of the Edition HERE presented to the Public. It will be evident, at first glance, that it is greatly \"shorn of its beams\" in regard to graphic decorations and typographical splendour. Yet its garb, if less costly, is not made of coarse materials: for it has been the wish and aim of the Publishers, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16224"],["title","A Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France and Germany, (#3)"],["body","this impression should rank among books worthy of the DISTINGUISHED PRESS from which it issues. Nor is it unadorned by the sister art of _Engraving_; for, although on a reduced scale, some of the repeated plates may even dispute the palm of superiority with their predecessors. Several of the GROUPS, executed on _copper_ in the preceding edition, have been executed on _wood_ in the present; and it is for the learned in these matters to decide upon their relative merits. To have attempted portraits upon wood, would have inevitably led to failure. There are however, a few NEW PLATES, which cannot fail to elicit the Purchaser's particular attention. Of these, the portraits of the _Abbé de la Rue_ (procured through the kind offices of my excellent friend Mr. Douce), and the _Comte de Brienne_, the _Gold Medal of Louis XII_. the _Stone Pulpit of Strasbourg Cathedral,_ and the _Prater near Vienna_--are particularly to be noticed.[14] This Edition has also another attraction, rather popular in the present day, which may add to its recommendation even with those possessed of its precursor. It contains fac-similes of the AUTOGRAPHS of several distinguished Literati and Artists upon the Continent;[15] who, looking at the text of the work through a less jaundiced medium than the Parisian translator, have continued a correspondence with the Author, upon the most friendly terms, since its publication. The accuracy of these fac-similes must be admitted, even by the parties themselves, to be indisputable. Among them, are several, executed by hands.. which now CEASE to guide the pen! I had long and fondly hoped to have been gratified by increasing testimonies of the warmth of heart which had directed several of the pens in question--hoped ... even against the admonition of a pagan poet ...    \"Vitae summa brevis SPEM nos vetat inchoare LONGAM.\"  But such hopes are now irretrievably cut off; and the remembrance of the past must solace the anticipations of the future.  So much respecting the _decorative_ department of this new edition of the Tour. I have now to request the Reader's attention to a few points more immediately connected with what may be considered its _intrinsic_ worth. In the first place, it may be pronounced to be an Edition both _abridged_ and _enlarged_: abridged, as regards the lengthiness of description of many of the MSS. and Printed Books--and enlarged, as respects the addition, of many notes; partly of a controversial, and partly of an obituary, description. The \"Antiquarian and Picturesque\" portions remain nearly as heretofore; and upon the whole I doubt whether the amputation of matter has extended beyond _an eighth_ of what appeared in the previous edition. It had long ago been suggested to me--from a quarter too high and respectable to doubt the wisdom of its decision--that the Contents of this Tour should be made known to the Public through a less costly medium:--that the objects described in it were, in a measure, new and interesting--but that the high price of the purchase rendered it, to the majority of Readers, an inaccessible publication. I hope that these objections are fully met, and successfully set aside, by the Work in its PRESENT FORM. To have produced it, _wholly divested_ of ornament, would have been as foreign to my habits as repugnant to my feelings. I have therefore, as I would willingly conclude, hit upon the happy medium--between sterility and excess of decoration.  After all, the greater part of the ground here trodden, yet continues to be untrodden ground to the public. I am not acquainted with any publication which embraces all the objects here described; nor can I bring myself to think that a perusal of the first and third volumes may not be unattended with gratification of a peculiar description, to the lovers of antiquities and picturesque beauties. The second volume is rather the exclusive province of the Bibliographer. In retracing the steps here marked out, I will not be hypocrite enough to dissemble a sort of triumphant feeling which accompanies a retrospection of the time, labour, and money devoted.. in doing justice, according to my means, to the attractions and worth of the Countries which these pages describe. Every such effort is, in its way, a NATIONAL effort. Every such attempt unites, in stronger bonds, the reciprocities of a generous feeling between rival Nations; and if my reward has not been in _wealth_, it has been in the hearty commendation of the enlightened and the good: \"Mea me virtute involvo.\"[16]  I cannot boast of the commendatory strains of public Journals in my own country. No intellectual steam-engine has been put in motion to manufacture a review of unqualified approbation of the Work now submitted to the public eye--at an expense, commensurate with the ordinary means of purchase. With the exception of an indirect and laudatory notice of it, in the immortal pages of the Author of Waverley, of the Sketch book, and of Reginald Dalton, this Tour has had to fight its way under the splendour of its own banners, and in the strength of its own cause. The previous Edition is now a scarce and a costly book. Its Successor has enough to recommend it, even to the most fastidious collector, from the elegance of its type and decorations, and from the reasonableness of its price; but the highest ambition of its author is, that it may be a part of the furniture of every Circulating Library in the Kingdom. If he were not conscious that GOOD would result from its perusal, he would not venture upon such an avowal. \"FELIX FAUSTUMQUE SIT!\"   [1] M. Crapelet is of course speaking of the PREVIOUS edition of the Tour.     He continues thus: \"M. Dibdin, dans son voyage en France, a visité nos     départemens de l'ouest et de l'est, toutes leurs principales villes,     presque tous les lieux remarquables par les antiquités, par les     monumens, par les beautés du site, ou par les souvenirs historiques.     Il a visité les châteaux, les églises, les chapelles; il a observé nos     moeurs, nos coutumes; nos habitudes; il a examiné nos Musées et nos     premiers Cabinets de curiosité; il s'est concentré dans nos     Bibliothéques. Il parle de notre littérature et des hommes de lettres,     des arts et de nos artistes; il critique les personnes comme les     choses; il loue quelquefois, il plaisante souvent; la vivacité de son     esprit l'égare presque toujours.\" A careful perusal of the notes in     THIS edition will shew that my veracity has not \"almost always led me     astray.\"  [2] GABRIEL PEIGNOT; _Variétés, Notices et Raretés Bibliographiques, 1822,     8vo. p. 4_.  [3] _Lettre d'un Relieur Francais à un Bibliographe Anglais; à Paris, de     l'Imprimerie de Crapelet_, 1822, 8vo. p.p. 28.  [4] It is a little curious that M. Lesné has not been singular in this     supposition. My amiable and excellent friend M. Schweighæuser of     Strasbourg had the same notion: at least, he told me that the style of     the Tour very frequently reminded him of that of Sterne. I can only     say--and say very honestly--that I as much thought of Sterne as I did     of ... William Caxton!  [5] Copious as are the above quotations, from the thoroughly original M.     Lesné, I cannot resist the risking of the readers patience and good     opinion, by the subjoining of the following passage--with which the     brochure concludes. \"D'après la multitude de choses hasardées que     contient votre Lettre, vous en aurez probablement recu quelques unes     de personnes que vous aurez choquées plus que moi, qui vous devrais     plutôt des remercimens pour avoir pris la peine de traduire quelques     pages de mon ouvrage; mais il n'en est pas de même de bien des gens,     et cela ne doit pas les engager à être autant communicatif avec vous,     si vous reveniez en France. Je souhaite, dans ce dernier cas, que tous     les typographes, les bibliothècaires, les bibliognostes, les     bibliographes, les bibliolathes, les bibliomanes, les biblophiles, les     bibliopoles, ceux qui exercent la bibliuguiancie et les bibliopégistes     même, soient pour vous autant de bibliotaphes; vous ne seriez plus à     même de critiquer ce que vous sauriez et ce que vous ne sauriez pas,     comme vous l'aviez si souvent fait inconsidérément:        Mais tous vos procédés ne nous étonnent pas,       C'est le sort des Français de faire DES INGRATS;       On les voit servir ceux qui leur furent nuisibles;       Je crois que sur ce point ils sont incorrigibles.      Je vous avouerai cependant que je suis loin d'être fâché de vous voir     en agir ainsi envers mes compatriotes: je désirerais que beaucoup     d'Anglais fissent de même; cela pourrait désangliciser ou     désanglomaniser les Français. Vous, Monsieur, qui aimez les mots     nouveaux, aidez-moi, je vous prie, à franciser, à purifier celui-ci.     Quant à moi        Je ne fus pas nourri de Grec et de Latin,       J'appris à veiller tard, à me lever matin,       La nature est le livre où je fis mes études,       Et tous ces mots nouveaux me semblent long-temps rudes;       Je trouve qu'on ne peut très bien les prononcer       Sans affectation, au moins sans grimacer;       Que tous ces mots tirés des langues étrangères,       Devraient être l'objet de critiques sévères.       Faites donc de l'esprit en depit du bon sens,       On vous critiquera; quant à moi j'y consens.      Je terminerai cette longue Lettre de deux manières: à l'anglaise, en     vous souhaitant le bon jour ou le bon soir, suivant l'heure à laquelle     vous la recevrez; à la française, en vous priant de me croire,      Monsieur,      Votre très humble serviteur,      LESNÉ.
