Perhaps it carried off too much of this dirt.\"  \"Muddy-puddil,\" replied Katie, \"full of dirt.\"  As they rode they passed houses whose chimneys were inhospitably left out of doors.  \"Why, look, auntie,\" said Dotty; \"theres a house turned wrong side out!\"  These buildings had no cellars, but were propped upon logs, leaving room for the air to pass under the floor, and for other things to pass under, such as cats, dogs, and chickens.  \"Why, where _do_ the people go to when they want to go down cellar?\" asked Dotty, in a maze.  Near one of these houses she was seized with an irresistible thirst. Mr. Parlin gave the reins to Mrs. Clifford, and stepped out of the carriage, then helped Dotty and Katie to alight.  They found a sharp-nosed woman cooking corn-dodgers for a family of nine children. Whether it was their breakfast or dinner hour, it was hard to tell. When Mr. Parlin asked for water, the woman wiped her forehead with her apron, and replied, \"O, yes, stranger,\" and one of the little girls, whose face was stained with something besides the kisses of the sun, brought some water from the spring in a gourd.  \"Well, Dotty Dimple,\" said Mrs. Clifford, when they were all on their way again, \"what did you see in the house?\"  \"O, I saw a woman with a whittled nose, and a box of flowers in the window.\"  \"And children,\" said Katie; \"four, five hunnerd chillen.\"  \"The box was labelled 'Assorted Lozenges,'\" said Mr. Parlin; \"but I observed that it contained a black imperial rose; so the occupants have an eye for beauty, after all. I presume they cannot trust their flowers out of doors on account of the pigs.\"  \"They brought me water in a squash-shell,\" cried Dotty; \"it _is_ so funny out West!\"  \"_I_ dinked in a skosh-shell, too; and I fink it's _velly_ funny out West!\" said little Echo.  They were riding behind the other carriage, and at some distance, in order to avoid the dust from its wheels.  \"Henry has stopped,\" said Mrs. Clifford. \"We have reached 'Small's Enlargement,' and cannot comfortably ride any farther. The lot next to this is ours, and it is there we are going for the pecans.\"  Dotty could hardly wait to be lifted out, so eager was she to walk on the \"Small Enlargement.\" She spoke of it afterwards as an \"ensmallment;\" and the confusion of ideas was very natural. It was the place where Grace and the \"Princess of the Ruby Seal\" had gone, some years before, to have their fortunes told. It was a wild picturesque region, overgrown with tulip trees, Judas trees, and scrub oaks.     CHAPTER IX.  IN THE WOODS.   The party walked leisurely along till they came to a log church, which Mr. Parlin paused to admire. It was in harmony, he said, with the roughness of the landscape.  \"I should like to attend service here by moonlight; I think it would be very sweet and solemn in such a lonely place. There would be no sound outside; and as you looked through the open door, you would only see a few quiet trees listening to the words of praise.\"  \"The evenings here must seem like something holy,\" said Mrs. Clifford, \"'the nun-like evenings, telling dew-beads as they go.'\"  \"O, my shole!\" cried Katie, dancing before the church door, and clapping her hands; \"that's the bear's house, the _bear's_ house! Little boy went in there, drank some of the old bear's podge, so _sour_ he couldn't drink it.\" Here she looked disgusted, but added with a honeyed smile, \"Then bimeby drank some o' _little_ bear's podge, and '_twas_ so sweet he drank it aw--all up!\"  Everybody laughed, it was so absurd to think of looking for bears and porridge in a building where people met to worship. Dotty had just been saying to herself, \"How strange that God is in this mizzable house out West, just as if it was in Portland!\" But Katie had rudely broken in upon her meditations.  \"O, what a Flyaway!\" said she; \"you don't do any good.\"  \"Yes, I does.\"  \"Well, what?\"  \"O, I tell 'tories.\"  \"Is that all?\"  \"I p'ay with little goorls; and then I p'ay some more; and I wash de dishes. I'll tell _you_ a 'tory,\" added she, balancing herself on a stump, and making wild gestures with her arms, somewhat as she had seen Horace do.       \"'Woe to de Dotties and sons 'o men,      Woe to 'em all when I yoam again!'\"  One wee forefinger pointed up to the sky; the right hand, doubled to a threatening little fist, was shaken at Dotty, while the young orator's face was so wrinkled with scowls that Dotty laughed outright.  \"Do speak that again,\" she said. \"You are the cunningest baby!\"  '\"Woe to de Dotties--!' No, I can't tell it 'thout I have sumpin to stan' on!\" sighed Miss Flyaway, falling off the stump directly against Dotty.  \"I believe you've broken me,\" cried Dotty; for, though Katie was small, her weight pressed heavily.  \"Well, Fibby's broke sumpin too,\" replied she, calmly. \"What does lamps wear?\"  \"I s'pose you mean chimneys.\"  \"Yes, Fibby has did it; she's broke a chimley.\"  \"Look up here, little Ruffleneck; you're an honor to the state,\" said brother Horace, proudly. \"You don't find such a 'cute child as this in Yankee land, Dotty Dimple.\"  \"You musn't call me a Yankee,\" said Dotty, who never liked Horace's tone when he used the word. \"I'm not a Yankee; I'm a 'Publican!\"  \"Hurrah for you!\" shouted Horace, swinging his hat; \"hurrah for Miss Parlin Number Three!\"  \"Dear, dear! what have I said now? I don't want him to hurrah for me,\" thought Dotty.  Horace returned to his manners.  \"She's such a firebrand that I like to make her eyes flash; but we must be polite to visitors; so here goes.\"  \"Cousin Dotty,\" said he aloud, dropping his mocking tones, and speaking very respectfully, \"if you are a true Republican, I honor you as such, and I'll never call you a Yankee again.\"  \"Well, I _am_ a 'Publican to the white bone!\"  What Dotty meant by the \"white bone\" was rather uncertain, it being one of those little figures of speech which will not bear criticism.  \"Then you believe in universal suffering?\"  \"O, yes,\" answered Dotty, quickly.  \"And the black walnut bureau?\"  Dotty hesitated.  \"If the 'Publicans do, and my father does.\"  \"O, yes; everybody believes in the black walnut bureau--that ever saw one.\"  Dotty glanced at Horace stealthily; but his face was so serious that she was sure he could not be making sport of her. They were walking a little in advance of the others, Horace dragging Flyaway, who was intent upon digging her little heels into the ground.  \"This place is sometimes called Goblin Valley,\" said the boy. \"A goblin means a sort of ghost; but nobody but simpletons believe in such things,\" added he, quickly, for he was too high-minded to wish to frighten his little cousin.  \"O, I'm not at all afraid of such things,\" said Dotty quietly; \"I've got all over it. I know what ghosts are now; they are pumpkins.\"  \"Excuse my smiling,\" said Horace, laughing uproariously.  \"You may laugh, cousin Horace, but I've seen them. They have a candle inside; and that's why my father brought me out West, because the doctor said it frightened me so. Why, they had to pour water over me and drown me almost to death, or I'd have died!\"  \"I wonder!\"  \"Yes, 'twas Johnny Eastman; but his mamma gave me a beautiful little tea-set, with _golder_ rims than the one that was burnt up; and Johnny and Percy both felt dreadfully.\"  \"Wanted the tea-set themselves--did they?\"  \"O, no; _they_ never play tea. That isn't why they feel dreadfully; it's because, if they ever frighten me again, the Mayor'll have them put in the _penitential_, and they know it.\"  \"They were mean fellows; that's a fact,\" said Horace, with genuine indignation. \"I used to be full of mischief when I was small; but I never frightened a little girl in my life; and no boy would do it that thinks anything of himself.\"  Dotty looked up admiringly at the youth of twelve years, liking him all the better for his chivalry, as any of you little girls would have done.  \"Boy-cousins are not always alike,\" said she, as if the idea was quite new; \"some are good, and some are naugh--\"  The word was cut in two by a scream. A large and very handsome snake was gliding gracefully across her path. The like of it for size and brilliancy, she had never seen before.  \"O, how boo-ful!\" cried Katie, darting after it. Horace held her back. Dotty trembled violently.  \"Kill it,\" she screamed; \"throw stones at it; take me away! take me away!\"  \"Poh, Dotty; nothing but an innocent snake; he's more afraid of you than you are of him.\"  \"You told him take you away two times,\" exclaimed Katie, \"and he didn't, and he didn't.\"  \"I never knew you had such awful things out West,\" said Dotty shuddering. \"And I don't think _now_ there's _any_ difference in boy-cousins! They never take you away, nor do anything you ask 'em to--so there!\"  \"Why, Dotty, he was hurrying as fast as he could to get out of our sight; there was no need of taking you away.\"  \"She needn't be 'fraid,\" observed Flyaway, soothingly; \"if I had a sidders, I could ha' cutted him in two.\"  By this time the rest of the party had arrived. Grace and Cassy walked together very confidentially under the same umbrella which had sheltered them years ago--a black one marked with white paint, \"Stolen from H.S. Clifford.\" \"Bold thieves\" Horace called them; but they deigned no notice of his remark.  \"I'll get an answer,\" murmured Horace, repeating aloud,--       \"'Hey for the apple and ho for the pear,      But give me the girl with the red hair.'\"  At this Grace turned around sharply, and shook her bare head, which gleamed in the sun like burnt gold.  \"Panoria Swan has red hair,\" said she,--\"fire-red; but mine is auburn.\"  \"O, I only wanted to make you speak, Grace; that will do.\"  \"Here we are at the woods,\" said Mr. Clifford. He had once owned a neighboring lot, and his pecan trees had been fenced around to protect them from the impertinent swine; but now the party were going into the heart of the forest.  The pecan trees were tall, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16390"],["title","Little Prudy's Dotty Dimple (#0)"],["body","PRUDY'S DOTTY DIMPLE  _By_ SOPHIE MAY  NEW YORK HURST & COMPANY PUBLISHERS  [Illustration]  DEDICATION.

Alice was the youngest of the Parlin family. When Grandma Read called the children into the kitchen, and told them about their new little sister, Susy danced for joy; and Prudy, in her delight, opened the cellar door, and fell down the whole length of the stairs. However, she rolled as softly as a pincushion, and was not seriously hurt.  \"But you can't go into mother's room,\" said Susy, \"you're crying so hard.\"  \"Poh!\" replied three-years-old Prudy, twinkling off the tears; \"yes, I can neither. I won't go _crying_ in! I didn't hurt me velly bad. I'm weller now!\"  So she had the first peep at the wee dot of a baby in the nurse's arms.  \"O, dear, dear,\" said she, \"what shall I do? I _are_ so glad! I wish I could jump clear up to the _sky_ of this room! How do you do, little sister?\"  The baby made no reply.  \"Why! don't you love me? This is _me_: my name's Prudy. I've got a red pocket dress;--Santa Claw bringed it.\"  Still the little stranger paid no heed,--only winked her small, bright eyes, and at last closed them entirely.  \"O, my stars! she don't hear the leastest thing,\" sobbed Prudy, glad of an excuse to cry again. \"She can't hear the leastest mite of a thing! Where's the holes in her ears gone to? O, dear, dear!\"  It seemed to Susy that this was the happiest day of her life. She stole up to her mother and kissed her. \"O, mamma,\" said she, \"wasn't God good to send this little sister?--Why, I'm crying,\" added Susy, greatly surprised: \"what do you suppose makes me cry, when I'm happy all over--clear to the ends of my fingers?\"  \"Yes, your eyes are sprinklin' down tears, but you're laughing all over your face; and so 'm I,\" said little Prudy, delighted to see some one else as foolish as herself.  \"Susan, I hope thee'll receive this new sister as a gift from God,\" said grandma Read, wiping her spectacles.  \"It seems so funny,\" said Susy, gently stroking the baby's face; \"so funny for me to have a new sister.\"  \"Now you've tolled a story, Susy Parlin; she was sended to me,--isn't I the littlest?\" cried bruised and battered Prudy, shaking with another tempest of tears, and kissing the baby violently.  \"O, mamma! O, grandma,\" said Susy, clasping her hands in alarm, \"don't let her kiss that soft baby so hard! She'll draw the blood right through her cheeks.\"  The nurse who was a smiling woman, with a wart on her nose, began to frown a little, and grandma Read, patting Prudy's head, whispered to her that if she did not stop crying she must leave the room, as the noise she made disturbed her mother.  \"Then I'll--I'll be--just as good as a lady, and I won't kiss her no more,\" replied little Prudy between her sobs, at the same time prying open baby's mouth with her busy fingers.  \"Why, where's her teef? When you goin' to put in her teef?\"  \"O,\" said Susy, in an ecstasy, \"isn't she such a velvet darling? What cunning little footsie-tootsies! Shaped just like a flatiron! But I haven't seen her eyes yet.\"  \"There, look now,\" said Prudy, puffing in the baby's face; \"her eyes has came! I've _blowed_ 'em open.\"  \"O, fie, Miss Prudy,\" said the nurse, biting her lips; \"now you'll certainly have to leave the room. It's not safe for you to come near this tiny bit of a baby. Nobody ever knows what you are likely to do next.\"  Little Prudy hung her head in great dismay.  \"Then, if she goes, I'll have to go too, or there'll be a fuss,\" sighed Susy, stroking the baby's hair, which was as soft as a mouse's fur.  Both children cast a lingering look at the bewitching little figure, so daintily wrapped in a fleecy blanket. Prudy felt tempted to snatch her up and give her a good hugging, but stood in mortal fear of the nurse. There was something awful about Mrs. Fling: Prudy presumed it was the wart on her nose.  When the children were outside the door, and grandma had closed it gently, they seated themselves on the upper step of the staircase, and began to talk over this strange affair.  \"Don't you know what made me cry in there?\" said Prudy. \"The baby isn't only a _girl_, and that's why I cried.\"  For the moment Prudy fancied she was telling the truth.  Susy laughed. \"Just to think of our keeping a boy in THIS house, Prudy Parlin!\"  \"O, no! _course_ not!\" returned her little sister, quickly; \"_we_ wouldn't keep a boy.\"  \"You see,\" argued Susy, \"it's boys that fires all the popguns, and whistle in your ears, and frighten you. Why, if this was a brother, we couldn't but just live! What made you cry for a brother, Prudy?\"  \"Poh, I didn't! I wouldn't have him for nothin' in my world! I'm glad God sended a girl, and that's what made me _laugh_.\"  \"It seems so queer to think of it Prudy, I don't know what to do with myself, I declare.\"  \"Well, I know what _I'm_ goin' to do. I'll give her my red pocket-dress. She's come clear down from God's house, and this is a drefful cold world.\"  Susy knew that little Prudy's heart must be overflowing with sisterly love to the baby, or she would not be willing to give her the pocket-dress.  \"She can tuck her candy in it,\" pursued Prudy; \"'tisn't a believe-make, you know; there's a hole clear through. She can tuck her candy in, and her pyunes and pfigs, and teenty apples. Oho!\"  \"'Twill be as mother says about giving her your dress, Prudy; but we shall be glad to see you kind to the new sister,\" said Susy, who was fond of giving small lectures to Prudy. \"We ought to be kind to her, for God sent her down on purpose. Of course it will be ME that will take the most care of her; but maybe they'll let you watch her sometimes when she's asleep. Don't blow open her eyes any more, Prudy; that's very naughty. If we do just as we ought to, and are kind to her, she'll be a comfort, and grow up a lady!\"  \"O, will she?\" asked Prudy, a little sadly. \"I thought when she growed up she'd be a gemplum, like papa.\"  \"What an idea! But that's just as much sense as you little bits o' children have! When you don't know about anything, Prudy, you may come and ask _me_; I'm most six.\"  The new baby was very wonderful indeed. The first thing she did was to cry; the next was to sneeze. Prudy wished \"all the people down street, and all the ladies that lived in the whole o' the houses, could see the new sister.\" Her heart swelled with pride when admiring ladies took the unconscious little creature in their arms, saying, \"Really, it is a remarkably pretty child. What starry eyes! What graceful little fingers! Isn't her mouth shaped like Prudy's?\"  Mrs. Parlin did not approve of cradles, and the nurse had a fashion of rolling the baby in a blanket and laying her down in all sorts of places. One day little Prudy flung herself into the big rocking chair, not noticing the small bundle which lay there, under a silk handkerchief.  It was feared at first that the baby was crushed to death; but when she was heard to cry, Mrs. Parlin said, \"We have great cause for thankfulness. So far as I can judge, it is only her _nose_ that is broken!\"  But the doctor pronounced the baby's bones as sound as ever.  \"It is only little Miss Prudy whose nose is out of joint,\" added he.  Prudy ran to look in the glass, but could not see anything the matter with her nose, or anything that looked like \"a joint.\" But after this she was as careful as a child of her heedless age can be, not to injure her tender sister. She never again saw a silk handkerchief without shaking it to make sure there was not a baby under it.  It was a long while before the friends could decide upon a name for this beautiful stranger.  \"For my part I have no choice,\" said Mr. Parlin, \"and only one remark to make; call the child by her right name, whatever it may be, for I am very much opposed to pet names, of all sorts.\"  After every one else had spoken, Mrs. Parlin suggested that she would like to call the baby Alice Barrow, in honor of a dear friend, now in heaven.  She grew to be a fair, fat baby; and while her teeth were pricking through, like little pointed pearls, Susy's front teeth were dropping out. Then she grew to be a toddling child; and while she was learning to walk, Prudy was beginning to sew patchwork. For time does not stand still; it passed, minute by minute, over the heads of Susy, Prudy, and Alice, as well as all the rest of the world. And soon it brought an end to Alice's babyhood.     CHAPTER II.  THE BONE MAN.   In spite of all Mr. Parlin had said against it, his little daughter was called by various pet names,--such as Midge, and Ladybird, and Forget-me-not. Very few were the people who seemed to remember that her name was Alice.  She had a pair of busy dimples, which were a constant delight to her sisters.  \"They twinkle, twinkle like little stars, only they don't shine,\" cried Prudy.  \"Why,\" said Susy, \"it's just as if her cheeks were made of water, and we were skipping pebbles in 'em.\"  And because of these tiny whirl pools, the child was usually called Dotty Dimple. From the time she could stand on her own little feet, she was a queen of a baby, and carried her small head very high. If she chanced to fall over a chair she seldom shed a tear, but thought the chair had treated her shamefully, and ought to be shut up in the closet. She never liked to have any one kiss her little bruises and pity her. It gave great offence if any one said, \"Poor Alice!\" She seemed to grow half a head taller "]]]
