To come and do the work for a pan of cold water! Who could have believed it?\"  \"You might have believed it if you'd believed me, son Thomas,\" said the old lady tossily. \"I told you so. But young people always know better than their elders!\"  \"I didn't see him,\" said the Tailor, beginning his story afresh; \"but I thought as I came in I heard a sort of laughing and rustling.\"  \"My mother said they often heard him playing and laughing about the house,\" said the old lady. \"I told you so.\"  \"Well, he sha'n't want for a bowl of bread-and-milk to-morrow, anyhow,\" said the Tailor, \"if I have to stick to Farmer Swede's waistcoat till midnight.\"  But the waistcoat was finished by bed-time, and the Tailor set the bread-and-milk-himself, and went to rest.  \"I say,\" said Tommy, when both the boys were in bed, \"the Old Owl was right, and we must stick to it. But I'll tell you what I don't like, and that is Father thinking we're idle still. I wish he knew we were the Brownies.\"  \"So do I,\" said Johnnie; and he sighed.  \"I tell you what,\" said Tommy, with the decisiveness of elder brotherhood, \"we'll keep quiet for a bit for fear we should leave off; but when we've gone on a good while, I shall tell him. It was only the Old Owl's grandmother's great-grandmother who said it was to be kept secret, and the Old Owl herself said grandmothers were not always in the right.\"  \"No more they are,\" said Johnnie; \"look at Granny about this.\"  \"I know,\" said Tommy. \"She's in a regular muddle.\"  \"So she is,\" said Johnnie. \"But that's rather fun, I think.\"  And they went to sleep.  Day after day went by, and still the Brownies \"stuck to it,\" and did their work. It is no such very hard matter after all to get up early when one is young and light-hearted, and sleeps upon heather in a loft without window-blinds, and with so many broken window-panes that the air comes freely in. In old times the boys used to play at tents among the heather, while the Tailor did the house-work; now they came down and did it for him.  Size is not everything, even in this material existence. One has heard of dwarfs who were quite as clever (not to say as powerful) as giants, and I do not fancy that Fairy Godmothers are ever very large. It is wonderful what a comfort Brownies may be in the house that is fortunate enough to hold them! The Tailor's Brownies were the joy of his life; and day after day they seemed to grow more and more ingenious in finding little things to do for his good.  Now-a-days Granny never picked a scrap for herself. One day's shearings were all neatly arranged the next morning, and laid by her knitting-pins; and the Tailor's tape and shears were no more absent without leave.  One day a message came to him to offer him two or three days' tailoring in a farm-house some miles up the valley. This was pleasant and advantageous sort of work; good food, sure pay, and a cheerful change; but he did not know how he could leave his family, unless, indeed, the Brownie might be relied upon to \"keep the house together,\" as they say. The boys were sure that he would, and they promised to set his water, and to give as little trouble as possible; so, finally, the Tailor took up his shears and went up the valley, where the green banks sloped up into purple moor, or broke into sandy rocks, crowned with nodding oak fern. On to the prosperous old farm, where he spent a very pleasant time, sitting level with the window geraniums on a table set apart for him, stitching and gossiping, gossiping and stitching, and feeling secure of honest payment when his work was done. The mistress of the house was a kind good creature, and loved a chat; and though the Tailor kept his own secret as to the Brownies, he felt rather curious to know if the Good People had any hand in the comfort of this flourishing household, and watched his opportunity to make a few careless inquiries on the subject.  \"Brownies?\" laughed the dame. \"Ay, Master, I have heard of them. When I was a girl, in service at the old hall, on Cowberry Edge, I heard a good deal of one they said had lived there in former times. He did house-work as well as a woman, and a good deal quicker, they said. One night one of the young ladies (that were then, they're all dead now) hid herself in a cupboard, to see what he was like.\"  \"And what was he like?\" inquired the Tailor, as composedly as he was able.  \"A little fellow, they said,\" answered the Farmer's wife, knitting calmly on. \"Like a dwarf, you know, with a largish head for his body. Not taller than--why, my Bill, or your eldest boy, perhaps. And he was dressed in rags, with an old cloak on, and stamping with passion at a cobweb he couldn't get at with his broom. They've very uncertain tempers, they say. Tears one minute, and laughing the next.\"  \"You never had one here, I suppose?\" said the Tailor.  \"Not we,\" she answered; \"and I think I'd rather not. They're not canny after all; and my master and me have always been used to work, and we've sons and daughters to help us, and that's better than meddling with the Fairies, to my mind. No! no!\" she added, laughing, \"if we had had one you'd have heard of it, whoever didn't, for I should have had some decent clothes made for him. I couldn't stand rags and old cloaks, messing and moth-catching, in my house.\"  \"They say it's not lucky to give them clothes, though,\" said the Tailor; \"they don't like it.\"  \"Tell me!\" said the dame, \"as if any one that liked a tidy room wouldn't like tidy clothes, if they could get them. No! no! when we have one, you shall take his measure, I promise you.\"  And this was all the Tailor got out of her on the subject. When his work was finished, the Farmer paid him at once; and the good dame added half a cheese, and a bottle-green coat.  \"That has been laid by for being too small for the master now he's so stout,\" she said; \"but except for a stain or two it's good enough, and will cut up like new for one of the lads.\"  The Tailor thanked them, and said farewell, and went home. Down the valley, where the river, wandering between the green banks and the sandy rocks, was caught by giant mosses, and bands of fairy fern, and there choked and struggled, and at last barely escaped with an existence, and ran away in a diminished stream. On up the purple hills to the old ruined house. As he came in at the gate he was struck by some idea of change, and looking again, he saw that the garden had been weeded, and was comparatively tidy. The truth is, that Tommy and Johnnie had taken advantage of the Tailor's absence to do some Brownie's work in the daytime.  \"It's that Blessed Brownie!\" said the Tailor. \"Has he been as usual?\" he asked, when he was in the house.  \"To be sure,\" said the old lady; \"all has been well, son Thomas.\"  \"I'll tell you what it is,\" said the Tailor, after a pause. \"I'm a needy man, but I hope I'm not ungrateful. I can never repay the Brownie for what he has done for me and mine; but the mistress up yonder has given me a bottle-green coat that will cut up as good as new; and as sure as there's a Brownie in this house, I'll make him a suit of it.\"  \"You'll _what_?\" shrieked the old lady. \"Son Thomas, son Thomas, you're mad! Do what you please for the Brownies, but never make them clothes.\"  \"There's nothing they want more,\" said the Tailor, \"by all accounts. They're all in rags, as well they may be, doing so much work.\"  \"If you make clothes for this Brownie, he'll go for good,\" said the Grandmother, in a voice of awful warning.  \"Well, I don't know,\" said her son. \"The mistress up at the farm is clever enough, I can tell you; and as she said to me, fancy any one that likes a tidy room not liking a tidy coat!\" For the Tailor, like most men, was apt to think well of the wisdom of womankind in other houses.  \"Well, well,\" said the old lady, \"go your own way. I'm an old woman, and my time is not long. It doesn't matter much to me. But it was new clothes that drove the Brownie out before, and Trout's luck went with him.\"  \"I know, Mother,\" said the Tailor, \"and I've been thinking of it all the way home; and I can tell you why it was. Depend upon it, _the clothes didn't fit_. But I'll tell you what I mean to do. I shall measure them by Tommy--they say the Brownies are about his size--and if ever I turned out a well-made coat and waistcoat, they shall be his.\"  \"Please yourself,\" said the old lady, and she would say no more.  \"I think you're quite right, Father,\" said Tommy, \"and if I can, I'll help you to make them.\"  Next day the father and son set to work, and Tommy contrived to make himself so useful, that the Tailor hardly knew how he got through so much work.  \"It's not like the same thing,\" he broke out at last, \"to have some one a bit helpful about you; both for the tailoring and for company's sake. I've not done such a pleasant morning's work since your poor mother died. I'll tell you what it is, Tommy,\" he added, \"if you were always like this, I shouldn't much care whether Brownie stayed or went. I'd give up his help to have yours.\"  \"I'll be back directly,\" said Tommy, who burst out of the room in search of his brother.  \"I've come away,\" he said, squatting down, \"because I can't bear it. I very nearly let it all out, and I shall soon. I wish the things weren't going to come to me,\" he added, kicking a stone in front of him. \"I wish he'd measured you, Johnnie.\"  \"I'm very glad he didn't,\" said Johnnie. \"I wish he'd kept them himself.\"  \"Bottle-green, with brass buttons,\" murmured Tommy, and therewith fell into a reverie.  The next night the suit was finished, and laid by the bread-and-milk.  \"We shall see,\" said the old lady, in a withering tone. There is not much real prophetic wisdom in this truism, but it sounds very awful, and the Tailor went to bed somewhat depressed.  Next morning the Brownies came down as usual.  \"Don't they look splendid?\" said Tommy, feeling the cloth. \"When we've tidied the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16052"],["title","The Brownies and Other Tales (#6)"],["body","I shall put them on.\"  But long before the place was tidy, he could wait no longer, and dressed up.  \"Look at me!\" he shouted; \"bottle-green and brass buttons! Oh, Johnnie, I wish you had some.\"  \"It's a good thing there are two Brownies,\" said Johnnie, laughing, \"and one of them in rags still. I shall do the work this morning.\" And he went flourishing round with a broom, while Tommy jumped madly about in his new suit. \"Hurrah!\" he shouted, \"I feel just like the Brownie. What was it Granny said he sang when he got his clothes? Oh, I know--       'What have we here? Hemten hamten!      Here will I never more tread nor stampen.'\"  And on he danced, regardless of the clouds of dust raised by Johnnie, as he drove the broom indiscriminately over the floor, to the tune of his own laughter.  It was laughter which roused the Tailor that morning, laughter coming through the floor from the kitchen below. He scrambled on his things and stole down-stairs.  \"It's the Brownie,\" he thought; \"I must look, if it's for the last time.\"  At the door he paused and listened. The laughter was mixed with singing, and he heard the words--       \"What have we here? Hemten hamten!      Here will I never more tread nor stampen.\"  He pushed in, and this was the sight that met his eyes.  The kitchen in its primeval condition of chaos, the untidy particulars of which were the less apparent, as everything was more or less obscured by the clouds of dust, where Johnnie reigned triumphant, like a witch with her broomstick; and, to crown all, Tommy capering and singing in the Brownie's bottle-green suit, brass buttons and all.  \"What's this?\" shouted the astonished Tailor, when he could find breath to speak.  \"It's the Brownies,\" sang the boys; and on they danced, for they had worked themselves up into a state of excitement from which it was not easy to settle down.  \"Where _is_ Brownie?\" shouted the father.  \"He's here,\" said Tommy; \"we are the Brownies.\"  \"Can't you stop that fooling?\" cried the Tailor, angrily. \"This is past a joke. Where is the real Brownie, I say?\"  \"We are the only Brownies, really, Father,\" said Tommy, coming to a full stop, and feeling strongly tempted to run down from laughing to crying. \"Ask the Old Owl. It's true, really.\"  The Tailor saw the boy was in earnest, and passed his hand over his forehead.  \"I suppose I'm getting old,\" he said; \"I can't see daylight through this. If you are the Brownie, who has been tidying the kitchen lately?\"  \"We have,\" said they.  \"But who found my measure?\"  \"I did,\" said Johnnie.  \"And who sorts your grandmother's scraps?\"  \"We do,\" said they.  \"And who sets breakfast, and puts my things in order?\"  \"We do,\" said they.  \"But when do you do it?\" asked the Tailor.  \"Before you come down,\" said they.  \"But I always have to call you,\" said the Tailor.  \"We get back to bed again,\" said the boys.  \"But how was it you never did it before?\" asked the Tailor doubtfully.  \"We were idle, we were idle,\" said Tommy.  The Tailor's voice rose to a pitch of desperation--  \"But if you did the work,\" he shouted, \"_where is the Brownie?_\"  \"Here!\" cried the boys, \"and we are very sorry that we were Boggarts so long.\"  With which the father and sons fell into each other's arms and fairly wept.         *       *       *       *       *  It will be believed that to explain all this to the Grandmother was not the work of a moment. She understood it all at last, however, and the Tailor could not restrain a little good-humoured triumph on the subject. Before he went to work he settled her down in the window with her knitting, and kissed her.  \"What do you think of it all, Mother?\" he inquired.  \"Bairns are a blessing,\" said the old lady tartly, \"_I told you so._\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"That's not the end, is it?\" asked one of the boys in a tone of dismay, for the Doctor had paused here.  \"Yes, it is,\" said he.  \"But couldn't you make a little more end?\" asked Deordie, \"to tell us what became of them all?\"  \"I don't see what there is to tell,\" said the Doctor.  \"Why, there's whether they ever saw the Old Owl again, and whether Tommy and Johnnie went on being Brownies,\" said the children.  The Doctor laughed.  \"Well, be quiet for five minutes,\" he said.  \"We'll be as quiet as mice,\" said the children.  And as quiet as mice they were. Very like mice, indeed. Very like mice behind a wainscot at night, when you have just thrown something to frighten them away. Death-like stillness for a few seconds, and then all the rustling and scuffling you please. So the children sat holding their breath for a moment or two, and then shuffling feet and smothered bursts of laughter testified to their impatience, and to the difficulty of understanding the process of story-making as displayed by the Doctor, who sat pulling his beard, and staring at his boots, as he made up \"a little more end.\"  \"Well,\" he said, sitting up suddenly, \"the Brownies went on with their work in spite of the bottle-green suit, and Trout's luck returned to the old house once more. Before long Tommy began to work for the farmers, and Baby grew up into a Brownie, and made (as girls are apt to make) the best house-sprite of all. For, in the Brownie's habits of self-denial, thoughtfulness, consideration, and the art of little kindnesses, boys are, I am afraid, as a general rule, somewhat behindhand with their sisters. Whether this altogether proceeds from constitutional deficiency on these points in the masculine character, or is one result among many of the code of bye-laws which obtains in men's moral education from the cradle, is a question on which everybody has their own opinion. For the present the young gentlemen may appropriate whichever theory they prefer, and we will go back to the story. The Tailor lived to see his boy-Brownies become men, with all the cares of a prosperous farm on their hands, and his girl-Brownie carry her fairy talents into another home. For these Brownies--young ladies!--are much desired as wives, whereas a man might as well marry an old witch as a young Boggartess.\"  \"And about the Owl?\" clamoured the children, rather resentful of the Doctor's pausing to take breath.  \"Of course,\" he continued, \"the Tailor heard the whole story, and being both anxious to thank the Old Owl for her friendly offices, and also rather curious to see and hear her, he went with the boys one night at moon-rise to the shed by the mere. It was earlier in the evening than when Tommy went, for before daylight had vanished, and at the first appearance of the moon, the impatient Tailor was at the place. There they found the Owl looking very solemn and stately on the beam. She was sitting among the shadows with her shoulders up, and she fixed her eyes so steadily on the Tailor, that he felt quite overpowered. He made her a civil bow, however, and said,  \"I'm much obliged to you, Ma'am, for your good advice to my Tommy.\"  The Owl blinked sharply, as if she grudged shutting her eyes for an instant, and then stared on, but not a word spoke she.  \"I don't mean to intrude, Ma'am,\" said the Tailor, \"but I was wishful to pay my respects and gratitude.\"  Still the Owl gazed in determined silence.  \"Don't you remember me?\" said Tommy pitifully. \"I did everything you told me. Won't you even say good-bye?\" and he went up towards her.  The Owl's eyes contracted, she shuddered a few tufts of fluff into the shed, shook her wings, and shouting \"Oohoo!\" at the top of her voice, flew out upon the moor. The Tailor and his sons rushed out to watch her. They could see her clearly against the green twilight sky, flapping rapidly away with her round face to the pale moon. \"Good-bye!\" they shouted as she disappeared; first the departing owl, then a shadowy body with flapping sails, then two wings beating the same measured time, then two moving lines still to the old tune, then a stroke, a fancy, and then--the green sky and the pale moon, but the Old Owl was gone.  \"Did she never come back?\" asked Tiny in subdued tones, for the Doctor had paused again.  \"No,\" said he; \"at least not to the shed by the mere. Tommy saw many owls after this in the course of his life; but as none of them would speak, and as most of them were addicted to the unconventional customs of staring and winking, he could not distinguish his friend, if she were among them. And now I think that is all.\"  \"Is that the very very end?\" asked Tiny.  \"The very very end,\" said the Doctor.  \"I suppose there might be more and more ends,\" speculated Deordie--\"about whether the Brownies had any children when they grew into farmers, and whether the children were Brownies, and whether _they_ had other Brownies, and so on and on.\" And Deordie rocked himself among the geraniums, in the luxurious imagining of an endless fairy tale.  \"You insatiable rascal!\" said the Doctor. \"Not another word. Jump up, for I am going to see you home. I have to be off early to-morrow.\"  \"Where?\" said Deordie.  \"Never mind. I shall be away all day, and I want to be at home in good time in the evening, for I mean to attack that crop of groundsel between the sweet-pea hedges. You know, no Brownies come to my homestead!\"  And the Doctor's mouth twitched a little till he fixed it into a stiff smile.  The children tried hard to extract some more ends out of him on the way to the Rectory; but he declined to pursue the history of the Trout family through indefinite generations. It was decided on all hands, however, that Tommy Trout was evidently one and the same with the Tommy Trout who pulled the cat out of the well, because \"it was just a sort of thing for a Brownie to do, you know!\" and that Johnnie Green (who, of course, was not Johnnie Trout) was some unworthy village acquaintance, and \"a thorough Boggart.\"  \"Doctor!\" said Tiny, as they stood by the garden-gate, \"how long do you think gentlemen's pocket-handkerchiefs take to wear out?\"  \"That, my dear Madam,\" said the Doctor, \"must depend, like other terrestrial matters,"]]]
