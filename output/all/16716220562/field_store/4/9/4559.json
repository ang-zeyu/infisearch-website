Catch May setting her precious little heart a-beating too fast for any fellow! Ah, here you come, lazy Mabel. Where is the mater? In the house, I suppose? I say, Kate, what a hole you have pitched upon for living in? I positively couldn't ride down upon the thing they offered me at the station. It wasn't even _clean_. Look at it, my dear girls! It holds my respectable belongings, and not me. It's the scarecrow or ghost of the ordinary station-fly. Could you have imagined the station-fly could have a ghost?\"  \"No,\" retorted Mabel, \"being so scarecrowy and ghost-like already. Please, driver, take Captain Bertram's things up to the house. He heard you speak, Loftie. These Northbury people are as touchy as if they were somebodies. Oh, Loftus, you will be disappointed. Mother has gone to Manchester.\"  \"To Manchester?\" retorted Loftus. \"My mother away from home! Did she know that I was coming?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Kate, \"I told her about your letter last night.\"  \"Did you show her my letter?\"  \"No.\"  \"Why didn't you? If she had read it she wouldn't have gone. I said I was in a scrape. I was coming down on purpose to see the mater. You might have sent me a wire to say she would not be at home, or you might have kept her at home by showing her my letter. You certainly did not act with discretion.\"  \"I said you'd begin to scold the minute you came here, Loftie,\" remarked Mabel. \"It's a way you have. I told Kitty so. See, you have made poor Kitty quite grave.\"  Loftus Bertram was a tall, slim, young fellow. He was well-made, athletic, and neat in appearance, and had that upright carriage and bearing which is most approved of in her Majesty's army. His face was thin and dark; he had a look of Kate, but his eyes were neither so large nor so full; his mouth was weak, not firm, and his expression wanted the openness which characterized Catherine's features.  He was a selfish man, but he was not unkind or ill-natured. The news which the girls gave him of their mother's absence undoubtedly worried and annoyed him a good deal, but like most people who are popular, and Loftus Bertram was undoubtedly very popular, he had the power of instantly adapting himself to the exigencies of the moment.  He laughed lightly, therefore, at Mabel's words, put his arm round his younger sister's unformed waist, and said, in a gay voice:  \"I won't scold either of you any more until I have had something to eat.\"  \"We live very quietly at the Manor,\" remarked Mabel, \"Mother wants to save, you know. She says we must keep up our refinement at any cost, but our meals are very--\" she glanced with a gay laugh at Catherine.  \"Oh, by Jove! I hope you don't stint in the matter of food,\" exclaimed the brother. \"You'll have to drop it while I'm here, I can tell you. I thought the mater would be up to some little game of this kind when she buried you alive in such an out-of-the-way corner. She makes a great mistake though, and so I shall tell her. Young girls of your age ought to be fed up. You'll develop properly then, you won't otherwise. That's the new dodge. All the doctors go upon it. Feed up the young to any extent, and they'll pay for it by-and-bye. Plenty of good English beef and mutton. What's the matter, Kate? What are you laughing in that immoderate manner for?\"  \"Oh, nothing, Loftie. I may laugh, I suppose, without saying why. I wish you would not put on that killing air, though. And you know perfectly there is no use in laying down the law in mother's house.\"  The three young people were now standing in the hall, and Clara tripped timidly forward.  \"We want dinner as quickly as possible, Clara,\" said Mabel. \"Come, Loftus, let us take you to your room.\"  That night the choicely served repast was less meagre than usual. Caller herring graced the board in abundance, and even Loftus did not despise these, when really fresh and cooked to perfection. The hash of New Zealand mutton, however, which followed, was not so much to this fastidious young officer's taste, but quantities of fine strawberries, supplemented by a jug of rich cream, put him once more into a good humor. He did not know that Kate had spent one of her very scarce sixpences on the cream, and that the girls had walked a mile-and-a-half through the hot sun that morning to fetch it.  The decanters of wine did not only do duty as ornaments that evening, and as the black coffee which followed was quite to Loftus' taste, he forgot the New Zealand mutton, or, at least, determined not to speak on the subject before the next morning.  After Mabel went to bed that night Kate asked her brother what the fresh scrape was about. He was really in an excellent humor then; the seclusion and almost romance of the old place soothed his nerves, which were somewhat jaded with the rush and tear of a life not lived too worthily. He and Kitty were strolling up and down in the moonlight, and when she asked her question and looked up at him with her fine, intelligent, sympathetic face, he pulled her little ear affectionately, and pushed back the tendrils of soft, dark hair from her brow.  \"The usual thing, Kitty,\" he responded. \"I'm in the usual sort of scrape.\"  \"Money?\" asked Catherine.  \"Confound the thing, yes. Why was money invented? It's the plague of one's life, Catherine. If there was no money there'd be no crime.\"  \"Nonsense,\" answered Catherine, with shrewdness. \"If there wasn't money there would be its equivalent in some form or other. Are you in debt again, Loftie?\"  \"How can I help it? I can't live on my pittance.\"  \"But mother gives you three hundred a year.\"  \"Yes--such a lot! You girls think that a fine sum, I suppose! That's all you know. Three hundred! It's a pittance. No fellow has a right to go into the army with such small private means.\"  \"But, Loftie, you would not accept Uncle Roderick Macleod's offer. He wrote so often, and said he could help you if you joined him in India.\"  \"Yes, I knew what that meant. Now, look here, Kate. We needn't rake up the past. My lot in life is fixed. I like my profession, but I can't be expected to care for the beggary which accompanies it. I'm in a scrape, and I want to see the mater.\"  \"Poor mother! I _wish_ you weren't going to worry her, Loftie.\"  \"It doesn't worry a mother to help her only son.\"  \"But she has helped you so often. You know it was on account of you that we came down here, because mother had given you so much, and it was the only way left to us to save. It wasn't at all a good thing for Mabel and me, for we had to leave our education unfinished. But mother thought it best. What's the matter, Loftie?\"  \"Only if you're going on in this strain I'm off to bed. It is hard on a fellow when he comes once in a while to see his sisters to be called over the coals by them. You know I'm awfully fond of you, Kitty, and somehow I thought you'd be a comfort to me. You know very little indeed of the real worries of life.\"  Loftus spoke in a tone of such feeling that Catherine's warm heart was instantly touched.  \"I won't say any more,\" she answered. \"I know it isn't right of me. I always wished and longed to be a help to you, Loftie.\"  \"So you can. You are a dear little sis when you like. You're worth twenty of May. I think you are going to be a very handsome girl, Kate, and if you are only fed up properly, and dressed properly, so that the best points of your figure can be seen--well--now what's the matter?\"  \"Only I won't have you talking of me as if I were going to be put up to auction.\"  \"So you will be when you go to London. All girls are. The mothers are the auctioneers, and the young fellows come round and bid. Good gracious, what a thunder-cloud! What flashing eyes! You'll see what a famous auctioneer mother will make! What is the matter, Kitty?\"  \"Nothing. Good-night. I'm going to bed.\"  \"Come back and kiss me first. Poor little Kit! Dear, handsome, fiery-spirited little Kit! I say though, _what_ a shabby frock you've got on!\"  \"Oh, don't worry me, Loftie! Any dress will do in the country.\"  \"Right, most prudent Catherine. By the way, when did you say mother would come back?\"  \"Perhaps on Monday.\"  \"What did she go to Manchester for?\"  \"I can't tell you.\"  \"Well, I trust she will be back on Monday evening, for I am due at the Depot on Tuesday. Lucky for me I got a week's leave, but I didn't mean to see it out. It will be uncommonly awkward if I cannot get hold of the mater between now and Tuesday, Kate.\"  \"Loftus--_are_ you going to ask her to give you much money?\"  \"My dear child, you would think the sum I want enormous, but it isn't really. Most fellows would consider it a trifle. And I don't want her really to give it, Kate, only to lend it. That's altogether a different matter, isn't it? Of course I could borrow it elsewhere, but it seems a pity to pay a lot of interest when one's mother can put one straight.\"  \"I don't know how you are to pay the money back, Loftus.\"  Loftus laughed.  \"There are ways and means,\" he said. \"Am I going to take all the bloom off that young cheek by letting its owner into the secrets of Vanity Fair? Come Kitty, go to bed, and don't fret about me, I'll manage somehow.\"  \"Loftus, how much money do you want mother to lend you?\"  \"What a persistent child you are. You positively look frightened. Well, three fifty will do for the present. That oughtn't to stump anyone, ought it?\"  \"I suppose not,\" answered Kate, in a bewildered way.  She put her hand to her forehead, bade her brother good-night, and sought her room.  \"Three hundred and fifty pounds!\" she murmured. \"And mother won't buy herrings more than eightpence a dozen! And we scarcely eat any meat, and lately we have begun even to save the bread. Three hundred and fifty pounds! Well, I won't tell Mabel.

FOR MY PART, I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THE BERTRAMS.   But notwithstanding all worries, the world in midsummer, when the days are longest and the birds sing their loudest, is a gay place for the young. Catherine Bertram stayed awake for quite an hour that night. An hour was a long time for such young and bright eyes to remain wide open, and she fancied with a wave of self-pity how wrinkled and old she would look in the morning. Not a bit of it! She arose with the complexion of a Hebe, and the buoyant and gladsome spirit of a lark.  As she dressed she sang, and when she ran downstairs she whistled a plantation melody with such precision and clearness that Loftus exclaimed, \"Oh, how shocking!\" and Mabel rolled up her eyes, and said sagely, that no one ever could turn Kate into anything but a tom-boy.  \"Girls, what are we to do after breakfast?\" asked the brother.  \"Have you any money at all in your pocket, Loftie?\" demurely asked Mabel, \"for if so, if so--\" her eyes danced, \"I can undertake to provide a pleasant day for us all.\"  \"Well, puss, I don't suppose an officer in her Majesty's Royal Artillery--is quite without some petty cash. How much do you want?\"  \"A few shillings will do. Let us pack up a picnic basket. Kate, you needn't look at me. I have taken Mrs. Masters into confidence, and there's a cold roast fowl downstairs--and--and--but I won't reveal anything further. We can have a picnic--we can go away an hour after breakfast, and saunter to that place known as the Long Quay, and hire the very best boat to be had for money, and we can float about on this lovely harbor, and land presently on the shore over there where the ruins of the old Port are; and we can eat our dinners there and be jolly. Remember that we have never but once been on the water since we came. Think how we have pined for this simple pleasure, Loftie, and fork out the tin.\"  \"My dear Mabel, I must place my interdict on slang.\"  \"Nonsense. When the cat's away. Oh, don't look shocked! Are we to go?\"  \"Go! of course we'll go. Is there no pretty girl who'll come with us? It's rather slow to have only one's sisters.\"  \"Very well, Loftus. We'll pay you out presently,\" said Kate.  \"And there is a very pretty girl,\" continued Mabel, \"At least Catherine considers her very pretty--only--\" her eyes danced with mischief.  \"Only what?\"  \"The mother doesn't like her. There's a dear old Rector here, and he introduced the girl to Kitty, and mother was wild. Mother sounded the Rector the next day and heard something which made her wilder still, but we are not in the secret. Kate fell in love with the girl.\"  \"Did you, Kate? When a woman falls in love with another woman the phenomenon is so uncommon that a certain amount of interest must be roused. Describe the object of your adoration, Kitty.\"  \"Her name,\" responded Kate, \"is Beatrice Meadowsweet. I won't say any more about her. If ever you meet her, which isn't likely, you can judge for yourself of her merits.\"  \"Kitty is rather cross about Beatrice,\" said Mabel; then she continued, \"Loftie, what do you think? Mother has cut all the Northbury folk.\"  \"Mabel, you talk very wild nonsense.\"  It was Kate who spoke. She rose from the breakfast-table with an annoyed expression.  \"Wild or not--it is true,\" replied Mabel. \"Mother has cut the Northbury people, cut them dead. They came to see us, they came in troops. Such funny folk! The first lot were let in. Mother was like a poker. She astonished her visitors, and the whole scene was so queer and uncomfortable, although mother was freezingly _polite_, that Kate and I got out of the room. The next day more people came--and more, and more every day, but Clara had her orders, and we weren't 'at home.' Kitty and I used to watch the poor Northburians from behind the summer-house. One day Kitty laughed. It was awful, and I am sure they heard.  \"Another day a dreadful little woman with rolling eyes said she would leave a tract on _Lying_ in the avenue--I wish she had. But I suppose she thought better of it.  \"Then there came a bazaar, a great bazaar, and the Rector invited us, and said all the Northburians would be there. What do you think mother did? She returned their calls on that day. She knew they'd be out, and they were. Wasn't that a dead cut, Loftie?\"  \"Rather,\" responded Loftus.  He rose slowly, looked deliberately at Kate, and then closed his lips.  \"Mother is away, so we won't discuss her,\" said Kate. \"Run and pack the picnic basket, Mabel, and then we'll be off.\"  The picturesque little town of Northbury was built on the slope of a hill. This hill gently descended to the sea. Nowhere was there to be found a more charming, landlocked harbor than at Northbury. It was a famous harbor for boating. Even at low tide people could get on the water, and in the summer time this gay sheet of dark blue sparkling waves had many small yachts, fishing smacks, and row-boats of all sizes and descriptions skimming about on its surface. In the spring a large fishing trade was done here, and then the steamers whistle? and shrieked, and disturbed the primitive harmony of the place. But by midsummer the great shoals of mackerel went away, and with them the dark picturesque hookers, and the ugly steamers, and the inhabitants were once more left to their sleepy, old-fashioned, but withal pleasant life.  Rosendale Manor was situated on high ground. It was surrounded by a wall, and the wide avenue was entered by ponderous iron gates. It was about eleven o'clock when the girls and their brother started gayly off for their day on the water. Loftus carried a couple of rugs, so that the fact of Mabel lugging a heavy picnic basket on her sturdy left arm did not look specially remarkable. They went down a steep and straggling hill, passed through an old-fashioned green, with the local club at one side, and a wall at the other which seemed to hang right over the sea.  They soon reached the Long Quay, and made their bargain for the best boat to be had. A man of the name of Driver kept many boats for hire, and he offered now to accompany the young party and show off the beauties of the place.  This, however, Mabel would not hear of. They must go alone or not at all. Loftus did not like to own to his very small nautical experience; the sea was smooth and shining, and apparently free from all danger, and the little party embarked gayly, and put out on their first cruise in high spirits.  Miss Peters and Mrs. Butler watched them with intense interest from their bay window. Miss Peters had possession of the spy-glass. With this held steadily before her eyes, she shouted observations to her sister.  \"There they go! No, Dan Driver is _not_ going with them! Any one can see by the way that young man handles the oar that he doesn't know a great deal about the water. Good gracious, Martha, they're taking a sail with them! Now I do call that tempting Providence. That young man has a very elegant figure, Martha, but mark my words he knows nothing at all about the management of a boat. The girls know still less.\"  \"Put down your spy-glass for a moment, and let me speak to you, Maria,\" exclaimed Mrs. Butler in an exasperated voice. \"I never knew such a tongue as yours for clap, clap, clapping. Did you say those two Bertram girls were going out alone with a _man_! Well, I have known what to think for some time! Alone on the water with a _young man_. Surely, Maria, you must have made a mistake.\"  \"It's just like you, Martha, you never believe in any one's eyes but your own. Here's the glass, look for yourself. If that isn't a man, and a young man, and a stylish, handsome man, my name isn't Maria Peters.\"  \"You'd be very glad if your name wasn't Peters,\" replied the irate sister. \"But I fear me there's little likelihood of your changing it now. Ah, here's Beatrice Meadowsweet. Good-morning, Bee, my dear. How's your dear mother? Is her poor precious cough any better?\"  \"Come here, Bee,\" said Miss Peters. \"Come over to the window this minute, and use your young eyes. Who are those people in Dan Driver's boat? There, you tell Martha, she wont believe me.\"  \"Those are the Bertrams,\" exclaimed Beatrice.  She put up her hand to shade her eyes, and took a long steadfast look over the shining water.  \"Those are the Bertrams, and of course, their brother.\"  \"Oh, my dear Bee, how you have relieved me!\" exclaimed Mrs. Butler.  She re-seated herself on a settee which stood near, and took her handkerchief to wipe out some wrinkles of anxiety from her stout face.  Beatrice stared in astonishment.  \"I don't quite understand,\" she said.  \"My dear! I feared something improper was going on. A young man, not a relation, out alone on the water with two girls! That's the kind of thing we don't allow, in Northbury, Bee. Now, what's the matter?\"  \"Look,\" said Beatrice, \"look! They are putting up the sail, and they are not doing it right. They oughtn't all three to stand up in the boat together. It will capsize! Oh, I must fly to them. Good-bye, Mrs. Butler. Mother would like to see you at tea, to-night. Good-bye, Miss Peters.\"  She rushed away, and the next moment was down on the quay. Three moments later she was speeding with swift long strokes across the harbor in her own beautifully appointed row-boat.  Her dress was of dark blue serge, with white collar and cuffs. Her hat was a simple sailor one. The exercise brought the color into her cheeks, and her big somewhat pathetic gray eyes were bright.  \"There she goes!\" exclaimed Miss Peters. \"Never saw such a girl. Doesn't she handle her oars with a touch? Oh, of course she is off to the rescue of those poor bunglers. And I daresay they don't think her good enough to speak to.\"  \"Good enough!\" exclaimed Mrs. Butler. \"She's twice too good for any one of them. Didn't her dress fit neat, Maria? Well, I hope she won't get let in by their fine ways."]]]
