Leaf: Like that of a leaflet of maidenhair fern, Fig. 45.  Range: A native of northern China and introduced into eastern North     America.  Soil and location: The gingko will grow in poor soils.  Enemies: Practically free from insects and disease.  [Illustration: FIG. 45.--Leaves of the Gingko Tree.]  Value for planting: It makes a valuable tree for the street where heavy     shade is not the object and forms an excellent wide-spreading     specimen tree on the lawn.  Other characters: The _fruit_ consists of a stone covered by sweet,     ill-smelling flesh. The tree is dioecious, there being separate male     and female trees. The male tree is preferable for planting in order     to avoid the disagreeable odor of the fruit which appears on the     female trees when about thirty years old. The male tree has a     narrower crown than the female tree. The buds (Fig. 46) are very odd     and are conspicuous on the tree throughout the winter. The leaves of     the gingko shed in the winter. In this respect the tree is like the     larch and the bald cypress.  [Illustration: FIG. 46.--Bud of the Gingko Tree.]      The gingko belongs to the yew family, which is akin to the pine     family. It is therefore a very old tree, the remains of the forests     of the ancient world. The gingko in its early life is tall and     slender with its few branches close to the stem. But after a time     the branches loosen up and form a wide-spreading crown. In the     Orient it attains enormous proportions and in this country it also     grows to a fairly large size when planted on the open lawn or in     groups far apart from other trees so that it can have plenty of room     to spread. It then produces a picturesque effect of unusual     interest.   WEEPING WILLOW (_Salix babylonica_)  Distinguishing characters: All the willows have a single cap-like scale     to the bud, and this species has an unusually *drooping mass of     slender branchlets* which characterizes the tree from all others,     Fig. 47.  [Illustration: FIG. 47.--Weeping Willow.]  Form and size: It grows to large size.  Range: Asia and Europe and naturalized in eastern United States.  Soil and location: Prefers moist places near streams and ponds.  Enemies: None of importance.  Value for planting: The weeping willow has a special ornamental effect     in cemeteries and along lakes and river banks in parks.  Commercial value: It is used in the United States for charcoal and for     fuel.  Comparisons: The _pussy willow_ (_Salix discolor_) may easily be told     from the other willows by its small size; it is often no higher than     a tall shrub. Its branches are _reddish green_ and the buds are dark     red, smooth and glossy. The predominating color of the twigs and     buds in the pussy willow is therefore a shade of _red_, while in the     weeping willow it is _yellowish green_.    GROUP VII. TREES TOLD BY THEIR BARK OR TRUNK: SYCAMORE, BIRCH, BEECH, BLUE BEECH, IRONWOOD, AND HACKBERRY  How to tell them from other trees: The _color of the bark or the form of     the trunk_ of each of the trees in this group is distinct from that     of any other tree.  How to tell them from each other: In the sycamore, the bark is     _mottled_; in the white birch, it is _dull white_; in the beech, it     is _smooth and gray_; in the hackberry, it is covered with numerous     _corky warts_; in the blue beech, the trunk of the tree is _fluted_,     as in Fig. 54, and in the ironwood, the bark _peels_ in thin     perpendicular strips.  [Illustration: FIG. 48.--Bark of the Sycamore Tree.]   THE SYCAMORE OR PLANE TREE (_Platanus occidentalis_)  Distinguishing characters: The peculiar *mottled appearance* of the     *bark* (Fig. 48) in the trunk and large branches is the striking     character here. The bark produces this effect by shedding in large,     thin, brittle plates. The newly exposed bark is of a yellowish green     color which often turns nearly white later on. *Round seed balls*,     about an inch in diameter, may be seen hanging on the tree all     winter. In this species, the seed balls are usually solitary, while     in the Oriental sycamore, a European tree similar to the native one,     they appear in clusters of two, or occasionally of three or four.     See Fig. 49.  [Illustration: FIG. 49.--Seed-balls of the Oriental Sycamore. Note one Seed-ball cut in half.]  [Illustration: FIG. 50.--Gray or White Birch Trees.]  Leaf: The stem of the leaf completely covers the bud. This is a     characteristic peculiar to sycamores.  Form and size: A large tree with massive trunk and branches and a broad     head.  Range: Eastern and southern United States.  Soil and location: Prefers a deep rich soil, but will adapt itself even     to the poor soil of the city street.  Enemies: The sycamore is frequently attacked by a fungus (_Gloeosporium     nervisequum_), which curls up the young leaves and kills the tips of     the branches. Late frosts also often injure its young twigs. The     Oriental sycamore, which is the European species, is more hardy in     these respects than the native one and is therefore often chosen as     a substitute.  Value for planting: The Occidental sycamore is now planted very little,     but the Oriental sycamore is used quite extensively in its place,     especially as a shade tree. The Oriental sycamore is superior to the     native species in many ways. It is more shapely, faster growing, and     hardier than the native one. Both sycamores will bear transplanting     and pruning well.  [Illustration: FIG. 51.--Bark of the Black or Sweet Birch.]  Commercial value: The wood of the sycamore is coarse-grained and hard to     work; used occasionally for inside finishing in buildings.  Other names: _Buttonball_, _buttonwood_.  Comparisons: The _Oriental sycamore_ (_Platanus orientalis_) an     introduced species, is apt to be confused with the Occidental     sycamore, but may be told from the latter by the number of seed     balls suspended from the tree. In the case of the Oriental species,     the seed balls hang in _pairs_ or (rarely) three or four together.     In the Occidental, the seed balls are generally _solitary_ and very     rarely in pairs.   GRAY OR WHITE BIRCH (_Betula populifolia_)  Distinguishing characters: The *dull-white color of the bark* on the     trunk and the _dark triangular patches below the insertion of the     branches_ distinguish this tree; see Fig. 50. The bark of the young     trunks and branches is reddish-brown in color and glossy. The bark     adheres closely to the trunk of the tree and does not peel in loose,     shaggy strips, as in the case of the yellow or golden birch. It is     marked by small raised horizontal lines which are the lenticels or     breathing pores. These lenticels are characteristic of all birch and     cherry trees. In addition to the distinction in the color of the     bark, an important character which distinguishes the gray birch from     all other species of birch, is found in the *terminal twigs*, which     are *rough* to the touch.  Form and size: A small tree. Frequently grows in clumps.  Range: Eastern United States.  Soil and location: The gray birch does best in a deep, rich soil, but     will also grow in poor soils.  Enemies: The _bronze-birch borer_, a wood-destroying insect, and     _Polyporus betulinus_, a fungus, are its chief enemies.  Value for planting: Its graceful habit and attractive bark gives the     tree an important place in ornamental planting. It may be used to     advantage with evergreens, and produces a charming effect when     planted by itself in clumps.  [Illustration: FIG. 52.--Bark of the Beech.]  [Illustration: FIG. 53.--Buds of the Beech Tree.]  Commercial value: The wood is soft and not durable. It is used in the     manufacture of small articles and for wood pulp.  Other characters: The _fruit is a catkin_.  Comparisons: The _paper birch_ (_Betula papyrifera_) is apt to be     confused with the gray birch, because both have a white bark. The     bark of the paper birch, however, is a clear white and peels off in     thin papery layers instead of being close. It very seldom shows any     dark triangular markings on the trunk. Its terminal twigs are not     rough and its trunk is usually straighter and freer from branches.      The _black_ or _sweet birch_ (_Betula lenta_) has a bark similar to     the gray birch, except that its color is dark gray. See Fig. 51. The     twigs have an aromatic taste.  [Illustration: FIG. 54.--Trunk of Blue Beech.]  [Illustration: FIG. 55.--Bark of the Ironwood.]      The _yellow birch_ (_Betula lutea_) has a yellowish or golden bark     which constantly peels in thin, ragged, horizontal films.      The _European white birch_ (_Betula alba_) has a dull-white bark     like the native white birch, but has smooth terminal twigs instead     of rough ones. It is commonly seen in the United States on lawns and     in parks.   AMERICAN BEECH (_Fagus americana_)  Distinguishing characters: The *close-fitting, smooth, gray bark* will     tell this tree from all others except the red maple and yellow-wood.     See Fig. 52. The red maple may then be easily eliminated by noting     whether the branches are alternate or opposite. They are alternate     in the beech and opposite in the maple. The yellow-wood may be     eliminated by noting the size of the bud. The *bud* in the     yellow-wood is hardly noticeable and of a golden yellow color, while     that of the beech is very *long, slender, and sharp-pointed*, and     chestnut brown in color. See Fig. 53.  Form and size: It grows tall in the woods, but on the open lawn spreads     out into a massive, round-headed tree.  Range: Eastern Canada and United States.  Soil and location:"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16116"],["title","Studies of Trees (#6)"],["body","a rich, well-drained soil, but will grow in     any good soil.  Enemies: _Aphides_ or plant lice that suck the sap from the leaves in     spring and early summer are the chief enemies of the tree.  Value for planting: The pleasing color of its bark, its fine spread of     branches, which gracefully droop down to the ground, and its     autumnal coloring, make the beech a favorite for lawn and park     planting. The several European species of beech are equally     charming.  [Illustration: FIG. 56.--Bark of the Hackberry.]  Commercial value: The wood is strong, close-grained, and tough. It is     used mainly for cooperage, tool handles, shoe lasts, chairs, etc.,     and for fuel.  Other characters: The _fruit_ is a prickly burr encasing a sharply     triangular nut which is sweet and edible.  Comparisons: The _European beech_ (_Fagus sylvatica_), and its weeping,     purple-leaved, and fern-leaved varieties, are frequently met with in     parks and may be told from the native species by its darker bark.     The weeping form may, of course, be told readily by its drooping     branches. The leaves of the European beeches are broader and less     serrated than those of the American beech.   BLUE BEECH OR HORNBEAM (_Carpinus caroliniana_)  Distinguishing characters: The *fluted* or muscular effect of its     *trunk* will distinguish the tree at a glance, Fig. 54.  Leaf: Doubly serrated; otherwise the same as that of ironwood.  Form and size: A low-spreading tree with branches arching out at various     angles, forming a flattened head with a fine, slender spray.  Range: Very common in the eastern United States.  Soil and location: Grows in low wet woods.  Enemies: None of importance.  Value for planting: Its artistic branching and curious trunk give the     tree an important place in park planting.  Commercial value: None.  Other characters: The bark is smooth and bluish gray in color.  Comparisons: The blue beech or hornbeam is often confused with the     _ironwood_ or _hop hornbeam_ (_Ostrya virginiana_). The ironwood,     however, has a characteristic bark that peels in perpendicular,     short, thin segments, often loose at the ends. See Fig. 55. This is     entirely different from the close, smooth, and fluted bark of the     blue beech. The color of the bark in the ironwood is brownish, while     that of the blue beech is bluish-gray. The buds of the ironwood are     greenish with brown tips, while the bud of the blue beech shows no     green whatever.   HACKBERRY (_Celtis occidentalis_)  Distinguishing characters: The tree may be told readily from other trees     by the *corky tubercles* on the bark of the lower portion of the     trunk. See Fig. 56.  Leaf: Has three predominating veins and is a bit more developed on one     side than on the other.  Form and size: A small or medium-sized tree with a single stem and broad     conical crown.  Range: United States and Canada.  Soil and location: Grows naturally in fertile soils, but will adapt     itself to almost sterile soils as well.  Enemies: The hackberry is usually free from disease, though often its     leaves are covered with insect galls.  Value for planting: It is extensively planted as a shade tree in the     Middle West, and is frequently seen as an ornamental tree in the     East.  Commercial value: It has little economic value except for fuel.  Other characters: The _fruit_ is berry-like, with a hard pit. The fleshy     outer part is sweet.  Other common names: _Nettle tree_; _sugarberry_.    GROUP VIII. THE OAKS AND CHESTNUT  How to tell them from other trees: The oaks are rather difficult to     identify and, in studying them it will often be necessary to look     for more than one distinguishing character. The oaks differ from     other trees in bearing _acorns_. Their _leaves_ have many lobes and     their upper lateral _buds_ cluster at the top of the twigs. The     general contour of each oak presents a characteristic branching and     sturdiness uncommon in other trees.      The chestnut differs from other trees in bearing _burs_ and its     _bark_ is also distinctly characteristic.  How to tell them from each other: There are two groups of oaks, the     _white oak_ and the _black oak_. The white oaks mature their acorns     in one year and, therefore, only acorns of the same year can be     found on trees of this group. The black oaks take two years in which     to mature their acorns and, therefore, young acorns of the present     year and mature acorns of the previous year may be found on the same     tree at one time. The _leaves_ of the white oaks have rounded     margins and rounded lobes as in Fig. 57, while those of the black     oaks have pointed margins and sharp pointed lobes as shown in Figs.     60, 62 and 64. The _bark_ of the white oaks is light colored and     breaks up in loose flakes as in Fig. 58, while that of the black     oaks is darker and deeply ridged or tight as in Figs. 59 and 61. The     white oak is the type of the white oak group and the black, red and     pin oaks are types of the other. For the characterization of the     individual species, the reader is referred to the following pages.  [Illustration: FIG. 57.--Leaf and Fruit of White Oak. (Quercus alba.)]   WHITE OAK (_Quercus alba_)  Distinguishing characters: The massive ramification of its branches is     characteristic of this species and often an easy clue to its     identification. The *bark* has a *light gray color*--lighter than     that of the other oaks--and breaks into soft, loose flakes as in     Fig. 58. The *leaves are deeply lobed* as in Fig. 57. The *buds are     small, round and congested* at the end of the year's growth. The     acorns usually have no stalks and are set in shallow, rough cups.     The kernels of the acorns are white and palatable.  Form and size: The white oak grows into a large tree with a     wide-spreading, massive crown, dissolving into long, heavy, twisted     branches. When grown in the open it possesses a short sturdy trunk;     in the forest its trunk is tall and stout.  Range: Eastern North America.  [Illustration: FIG. 58.--Bark of White Oak. (Quercus alba.)]  Soil and location: The white oak thrives in almost any well-drained,     good, deep soil except in a very cold and wet soil. It requires     plenty of light and attains great age.  Enemies: The tree is comparatively free from insects and disease except     in districts where the Gipsy moth is common, in which case the     leaves of the white oak are a favorite food of its caterpillars.  [Illustration: FIG. 59.--Bark of Black Oak. (Quercus velutina).]  Value for planting: The white oak is one of the most stately trees. Its     massive form and its longevity make the tree suitable for both lawn     and woodland planting but it is not used much because it is     difficult to transplant and grows rather slowly.  Commercial value: The wood is of great economic importance. It is heavy,     hard, strong and durable and is used in cooperage, construction     work, interior finish of buildings and for railroad ties, furniture,     agricultural implements and fuel.  Comparisons: The _swamp white oak_ (_Quercus platanoides_) is similar to     the white oak in general appearance of the bark and form and is     therefore liable to be confused with it. It differs from the white     oak, however, in possessing a more straggly habit and in the fact     that the bark on the under side of its branches shags in loose,     large scales. Its buds are smaller, lighter colored and more downy     and its acorns are more pointed and with cups more shallow than     those of the white oak. The tree also grows in moister ground,     generally bordering swamps.  [Illustration: FIG. 60.--Leaf and Fruit of Black Oak. (Quercus velutina).]   BLACK OAK (_Quercus velutina_)  Distinguishing characters: The *bark* is black, rough and cut up into     firm *ridges* especially at the base of the tree, see Fig. 59. The     _inner bark_ has a _bright yellow color_: the *leaves* have _sharp     points_ and are wider at the base than at the tip as shown in Fig.     60. The buds are _large, downy_ and _sharp pointed_. The acorns are     small and have deep, scaly cups the inner margins of which are     downy. The kernels are yellow and bitter.  Form and size: The tree grows in an irregular form to large size, with     its branches rather slender as compared with the white oak and with     a more open and narrow crown.  Range: Eastern North America.  Soil and location: It will grow in poor soils but does best where the     soil is rich and well drained.  Enemies: None of importance.  Value for planting: The black oak is the poorest of the oaks for     planting and is rarely offered by nurserymen.  Commercial value: The wood is heavy, hard and strong, but checks readily     and is coarse grained. It is of little value except for fuel. The     bark is used for tannin.  Other common names: _Yellow oak_.  Comparisons: The black oak might sometimes be confused with the _red_     and _scarlet oaks_. The yellow, bitter inner bark will distinguish     the black oak from the other two. The light-colored, smooth bark of     the red oak and the dark, ridged bark of the black oak will     distinguish the two, while the bark of the scarlet oak has an     appearance intermediate between the two. The buds of the three     species also show marked differences. The buds of the black oak are     covered with hairs, those of the scarlet oak have fewer hairs and     those of the red are practically free from hairs. The leaves of each     of the three species are distinct and the growth habits are     different.   RED OAK (_Quercus rubra_)  Distinguishing characters: The *bark* is perpendicularly fissured into     long, _smooth, light gray strips_ giving the trunk a characteristic     *pillar effect* as in Figs. 61 and 94. It has the straightest trunk     of all the oaks. The leaves possess _more lobes_ than the"]]]
