Now first done into English out of the French by Andrew Lang.   TO HENRIETTA LANG  My Dear Aunt,--To you, who read to me stories from the History of France, before I could read them for myself, this Chronicle is affectionately dedicated.  Yours ever,  ANDREW LANG.     PREFACE   Norman Leslie of Pitcullo, whose narrative the reader has in his hands, refers more than once to his unfinished Latin Chronicle.  That work, usually known as \"The Book of Pluscarden,\" has been edited by Mr. Felix Skene, in the series of \"Historians of Scotland\" (vol. vii.).  To Mr. Skene's introduction and notes the curious are referred.  Here it may suffice to say that the original MS. of the Latin Chronicle is lost; that of six known manuscript copies none is older than 1480; that two of these copies contain a Prologue; and that the Prologue tells us all that has hitherto been known about the author.  The date of the lost Latin original is 1461, as the author himself avers. He also, in his Prologue, states the purpose of his work.  At the bidding of an unnamed Abbot of Dunfermline, who must have been Richard Bothwell, he is to abbreviate \"The Great Chronicle,\" and \"bring it up to date,\" as we now say.  He is to recount the events of his own time, \"with certain other miraculous deeds, which I who write have had cognisance of, seen, and heard, beyond the bounds of this realm.  Also, lastly, concerning a certain marvellous Maiden, who recovered the kingdom of France out of the hands of the tyrant, Henry, King of England.  The aforesaid Maiden I saw, was conversant with, and was in her company in her said recovery of France, and till her life's end I was ever present.\"  After \"I was ever present\" the copies add \"etc.,\" perhaps a sign of omission.  The monkish author probably said more about the heroine of his youth, and this the copyists have chosen to leave out.  The author never fulfilled this promise of telling, in Latin, the history of the Maid as her career was seen by a Scottish ally and friend.  Nor did he ever explain how a Scot, and a foe of England, succeeded in being present at the Maiden's martyrdom in Rouen.  At least he never fulfilled his promise, as far as any of the six Latin MSS. of his Chronicle are concerned.  Every one of these MSS.--doubtless following their incomplete original--breaks off short in the middle of the second sentence of Chapter xxxii. Book xii.  Here is the brief fragment which that chapter contains:--  \"In those days the Lord stirred up the spirit of a certain marvellous Maiden, born on the borders of France, in the duchy of Lorraine, and the see of Toul, towards the Imperial territories.  This Maiden her father and mother employed in tending sheep; daily, too, did she handle the distaff; man's love she knew not; no sin, as it is said, was found in her, to her innocence the neighbours bore witness . . . \"  Here the Latin narrative of the one man who followed Jeanne d'Arc through good and evil to her life's end breaks off abruptly.  The author does not give his name; even the name of the Abbot at whose command he wrote \"is left blank, as if it had been erased in the original\" (Mr. Felix Skene, \"Liber Pluscardensis,\" in the \"Historians of Scotland,\" vii. p. 18).  It might be guessed that the original fell into English hands between 1461 and 1489, and that they blotted out the name of the author, and destroyed a most valuable record of their conqueror and their victim, Jeanne d'Arc.  Against this theory we have to set the explanation here offered by Norman Leslie, our author, in the Ratisbon Scots College's French MS., of which this work is a translation.  Leslie never finished his Latin Chronicle, but he wrote, in French, the narrative which follows, decorating it with the designs which Mr. Selwyn Image has carefully copied in black and white.  Possessing this information, we need not examine Mr. W. F. Skene's learned but unconvincing theory that the author of the fragmentary Latin work was one Maurice Drummond, out of the Lennox.  The hypothesis is that of Mr. W. F. Skene, and Mr. Felix Skene points out the difficulties which beset the opinion of his distinguished kinsman.  Our Monk is a man of Fife.  As to the veracity of the following narrative, the translator finds it minutely corroborated, wherever corroboration could be expected, in the large mass of documents which fill the five volumes of M. Quicherat's \"Proces de Jeanne d'Arc,\" in contemporary chronicles, and in MSS. more recently discovered in French local or national archives.  Thus Charlotte Boucher, Barthelemy Barrette, Noiroufle, the Scottish painter, and his daughter Elliot, Capdorat, ay, even Thomas Scott, the King's Messenger, were all real living people, traces of whose existence, with some of their adventures, survive faintly in brown old manuscripts.  Louis de Coutes, the pretty page of the Maid, a boy of fourteen, may have been hardly judged by Norman Leslie, but he certainly abandoned Jeanne d'Arc at her first failure.  So, after explaining the true position and character of our monkish author and artist, we leave his book to the judgment which it has tarried for so long.     CHAPTER I--HOW THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN, AND HOW NORMAN LESLIE FLED OUT OF FIFE   It is not of my own will, nor for my own glory, that I, Norman Leslie, sometime of Pitcullo, and in religion called Brother Norman, of the Order of Benedictines, of Dunfermline, indite this book.  But on my coming out of France, in the year of our Lord One thousand four hundred and fifty- nine, it was laid on me by my Superior, Richard, Abbot in Dunfermline, that I should abbreviate the Great Chronicle of Scotland, and continue the same down to our own time. {1}  He bade me tell, moreover, all that I knew of the glorious Maid of France, called Jeanne la Pucelle, in whose company I was, from her beginning even till her end.  Obedient, therefore, to my Superior, I wrote, in this our cell of Pluscarden, a Latin book containing the histories of times past, but when I came to tell of matters wherein, as Maro says, \"pars magna fui,\" I grew weary of such rude, barbarous Latin as alone I am skilled to indite, for of the manner Ciceronian, as it is now practised by clerks of Italy, I am not master: my book, therefore, I left unfinished, breaking off in the middle of a sentence.  Yet, considering the command laid on me, in the end I am come to this resolve, namely, to write the history of the wars in France, and the history of the blessed Maid (so far at least as I was an eyewitness and partaker thereof), in the French language, being the most commonly understood of all men, and the most delectable.  It is not my intent to tell all the story of the Maid, and all her deeds and sayings, for the world would scarcely contain the books that should be written.  But what I myself beheld, that I shall relate, especially concerning certain accidents not known to the general, by reason of which ignorance the whole truth can scarce be understood.  For, if Heaven visibly sided with France and the Maid, no less did Hell most manifestly take part with our old enemy of England.  And often in this life, if we look not the more closely, and with the eyes of faith, Sathanas shall seem to have the upper hand in the battle, with whose very imp and minion I myself was conversant, to my sorrow, as shall be shown.  First, concerning myself I must say some few words, to the end that what follows may be the more readily understood.  I was born in the kingdom of Fife, being, by some five years, the younger of two sons of Archibald Leslie, of Pitcullo, near St. Andrews, a cadet of the great House of Rothes.  My mother was an Englishwoman of the Debatable Land, a Storey of Netherby, and of me, in our country speech, it used to be said that I was \"a mother's bairn.\"  For I had ever my greatest joy in her, whom I lost ere I was sixteen years of age, and she in me: not that she favoured me unduly, for she was very just, but that, within ourselves, we each knew who was nearest to her heart.  She was, indeed, a saintly woman, yet of a merry wit, and she had great pleasure in reading of books, and in romances.  Being always, when I might, in her company, I became a clerk insensibly, and without labour I could early read and write, wherefore my father was minded to bring me up for a churchman.  For this cause, I was some deal despised by others of my age, and, yet more, because from my mother I had caught the Southron trick of the tongue.  They called me \"English Norman,\" and many a battle I have fought on that quarrel, for I am as true a Scot as any, and I hated the English (my own mother's people though they were) for taking and holding captive our King, James I. of worthy memory.  My fancy, like that of most boys, was all for the wars, and full of dreams concerning knights and ladies, dragons and enchanters, about which the other lads were fain enough to hear me tell what I had read in romances, though they mocked at me for reading.  Yet they oft came ill speed with their jests, for my brother had taught me to use my hands: and to hold a sword I was instructed by our smith, who had been prentice to Harry Gow, the Burn-the- Wind of Perth, and the best man at his weapon in broad Scotland.  From him I got many a trick of fence that served my turn later.  But now the evil time came when my dear mother sickened and died, leaving to me her memory and her great chain of gold.  A bitter sorrow is her death to me still; but anon my father took to him another wife of the Bethunes of Blebo.  I blame myself, rather than this lady, that we dwelt not happily in the same house.  My father therefore, still minded to make me a churchman, sent me to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1631"],["title","A Monk of Fife (#1)"],["body","of Montrose's new college that stands in the South Street of St. Andrews, a city not far from our house of Pitcullo.  But there, like a wayward boy, I took more pleasure in the battles of the \"nations\"--as of Fife against Galloway and the Lennox; or in games of catch-pull, football, wrestling, hurling the bar, archery, and golf--than in divine learning--as of logic, and Aristotle his analytics.  Yet I loved to be in the scriptorium of the Abbey, and to see the good Father Peter limning the blessed saints in blue, and red, and gold, of which art he taught me a little.  Often I would help him to grind his colours, and he instructed me in the laying of them on paper or vellum, with white of egg, and in fixing and burnishing the gold, and in drawing flowers, and figures, and strange beasts and devils, such as we see grinning from the walls of the cathedral.  In the French language, too, he learned me, for he had been taught at the great University of Paris; and in Avignon had seen the Pope himself, Benedict XIII., of uncertain memory.  Much I loved to be with Father Peter, whose lessons did not irk me, but jumped with my own desire to read romances in the French tongue, whereof there are many.  But never could I have dreamed that, in days to come, this art of painting would win me my bread for a while, and that a Leslie of Pitcullo should be driven by hunger to so base and contemned a handiwork, unworthy, when practised for gain, of my blood.  Yet it would have been well for me to follow even this craft more, and my sports and pastimes less: Dickon Melville had then escaped a broken head, and I, perchance, a broken heart.  But youth is given over to vanities that war against the soul, and, among others, to that wicked game of the Golf, now justly cried down by our laws, {2} as the mother of cursing and idleness, mischief and wastery, of which game, as I verily believe, the devil himself is the father.  It chanced, on an October day of the year of grace Fourteen hundred and twenty-eight, that I was playing myself at this accursed sport with one Richard Melville, a student of like age with myself.  We were evenly matched, though Dickon was tall and weighty, being great of growth for his age, whereas I was of but scant inches, slim, and, as men said, of a girlish countenance.  Yet I was well skilled in the game of the Golf, and have driven a Holland ball the length of an arrow-flight, there or thereby.  But wherefore should my sinful soul be now in mind of these old vanities, repented of, I trust, long ago?  As we twain, Dickon and I, were known for fell champions at this unholy sport, many of the other scholars followed us, laying wagers on our heads.  They were but a wild set of lads, for, as then, there was not, as now there is, a house appointed for scholars to dwell in together under authority.  We wore coloured clothes, and our hair long; gold chains, and whingers {3} in our belts, all of which things are now most righteously forbidden.  But I carried no whinger on the links, as considering that it hampered a man in his play.  So the game went on, now Dickon leading \"by a hole,\" as they say, and now myself, and great wagers were laid on us.  Now, at the hole that is set high above the Eden, whence you see far over the country, and the river-mouth, and the shipping, it chanced that my ball lay between Dickon's and the hole, so that he could in no manner win past it.  \"You laid me that stimy of set purpose,\" cried Dickon, throwing down his club in a rage; \"and this is the third time you have done it in this game.\"  \"It is clean against common luck,\" quoth one of his party, \"and the game and the money laid on it should be ours.\"  \"By the blessed bones of the Apostle,\" I said, \"no luck is more common. To-day to me, to-morrow to thee!  Lay it of purpose, I could not if I would.\"  \"You lie!\" he shouted in a rage, and gripped to his whinger.  It was ever my father's counsel that I must take the lie from none. Therefore, as his steel was out, and I carried none, I made no more ado, and the word of shame had scarce left his lips when I felled him with the iron club that we use in sand.  \"He is dead!\" cried they of his party, while the lads of my own looked askance on me, and had manifestly no mind to be partakers in my deed.  Now, Melville came of a great house, and, partly in fear of their feud, partly like one amazed and without any counsel, I ran and leaped into a boat that chanced to lie convenient on the sand, and pulled out into the Eden.  Thence I saw them raise up Melville, and bear him towards the town, his friends lifting their hands against me, with threats and malisons.  His legs trailed and his head wagged like the legs and the head of a dead man, and I was without hope in the world.  At first it was my thought to row up the river-mouth, land, and make across the marshes and fields to our house at Pitcullo.  But I bethought me that my father was an austere man, whom I had vexed beyond bearing with my late wicked follies, into which, since the death of my mother, I had fallen.  And now I was bringing him no college prize, but a blood- feud, which he was like to find an ill heritage enough, even without an evil and thankless son.  My stepmother, too, who loved me little, would inflame his anger against me.  Many daughters he had, and of gear and goods no more than enough.  Robin, my elder brother, he had let pass to France, where he served among the men of John Kirkmichael, Bishop of Orleans--he that smote the Duke of Clarence in fair fight at Bauge.  Thinking of my father, and of my stepmother's ill welcome, and of Robin, abroad in the wars against our old enemy of England, it may be that I fell into a kind of half dream, the boat lulling me by its movement on the waters.  Suddenly I felt a crashing blow on my head.  It was as if the powder used for artillery had exploded in my mouth, with flash of light and fiery taste, and I knew nothing.  Then, how long after I could not tell, there was water on my face, the blue sky and the blue tide were spinning round--they spun swiftly, then slowly, then stood still.  There was a fierce pain stounding in my head, and a voice said--  \"That good oar-stroke will learn you to steal boats!\"  I knew the voice; it was that of a merchant sailor-man with whom, on the day before, I had quarrelled in the market-place.  Now I was lying at the bottom of a boat which four seamen, who had rowed up to me and had broken my head as I meditated, were pulling towards a merchant-vessel, or carrick, in the Eden-mouth.  Her sails were being set; the boat wherein I lay was towing that into which I had leaped after striking down Melville. For two of the ship's men, being on shore, had hailed their fellows in the carrick, and they had taken vengeance upon me.  \"You scholar lads must be taught better than your masters learn you,\" said my enemy.  And therewith they carried me on board the vessel, the \"St. Margaret,\" of Berwick, laden with a cargo of dried salmon from Eden-mouth.  They meant me no kindness, for there was an old feud between the scholars and the sailors; but it seemed to me, in my foolishness, that now I was in luck's way.  I need not go back, with blood on my hands, to Pitcullo and my father.  I had money in my pouch, my mother's gold chain about my neck, a ship's deck under my foot, and the seas before me.  It was not hard for me to bargain with the shipmaster for a passage to Berwick, whence I might put myself aboard a vessel that traded to Bordeaux for wine from that country.  The sailors I made my friends at no great cost, for indeed they were the conquerors, and could afford to show clemency, and hold me to slight ransom as a prisoner of war.  So we lifted anchor, and sailed out of Eden-mouth, none of those on shore knowing how I was aboard the carrick that slipped by the bishop's castle, and so under the great towers of the minster and St. Rule's, forth to the Northern Sea.  Despite my broken head--which put it comfortably into my mind that maybe Dickon's was no worse--I could have laughed to think how clean I had vanished away from St. Andrews, as if the fairies had taken me.  Now having time to reason of it quietly, I picked up hope for Dickon's life, remembering his head to be of the thickest.  Then came into my mind the many romances of chivalry which I had read, wherein the young squire has to flee his country for a chance blow, as did Messire Patroclus, in the Romance of Troy, who slew a man in anger over the game of the chess, and many another knight, in the tales of Charlemagne and his paladins.  For ever it is thus the story opens, and my story, methought, was beginning to-day like the rest.  Now, not to prove more wearisome than need be, and so vex those who read this chronicle with much talk about myself, and such accidents of travel as beset all voyagers, and chiefly in time of war, I found a trading ship at Berwick, and reached Bordeaux safe, after much sickness on the sea. And in Bordeaux, with a very sore heart, I changed the links of my mother's chain that were left to me--all but four, that still I keep--for money of that country; and so, with a lighter pack than spirit, I set forth towards Orleans and to my brother Robin.  On this journey I had good cause to bless Father Peter of the Abbey for his teaching me the French tongue, that was of more service to me than all my Latin.  Yet my Latin, too, the little I knew, stood me in good stead at the monasteries, where often I found bed and board, and no small kindness; I little deeming that, in time to come, I also should be in religion, an old man and weary, glad to speak with travellers concerning the news of the world, from which I am now these ten years retired.  Yet I love even better to call back memories of these days, when I took my part in the fray.  If this be a sin, may God and the Saints forgive me, for if I have fought, it was in a rightful cause, which Heaven at last has prospered, and in "]]]
