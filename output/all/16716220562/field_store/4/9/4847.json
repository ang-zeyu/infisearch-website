Having decided to dispose of the admiral, the grocer, who had an errand in the city the next day, carried the bird with him.  He knew of a probable customer for it in a gentleman named Morris, who had been advertising in the papers for a redbird.  He soon found the street and number where was located the gentleman's office, at which the advertisement was to be answered, and displayed the admiral.  \"Your bird looks kind of ragged, as though he hadn't been treated well,\" said Mr. Morris, as he examined the scarlet plumage.  \"My boy wants a redbird, and I promised him one if he would get the highest grade in arithmetic in his class this term and he did it, so of course I must keep my word.  What d'ye ask for this bird?\"  \"He'd be cheap at five dollars,\" answered the groceryman.  \"A nice redbird is hard to get, and they're powerful nice singers, but bein' as it's for your boy that has earned it by studying his lessons so good--I always like a boy that is fond of his books--you can have it for two dollars and a quarter.\"  As he had paid but five cents for it this advance in price would be a fine business speculation.  After a little further talk, Mr. Morris counted out the money, and the man went back to his home doubtless wishing he had a hundred more redbirds to sell at the same handsome profit.  After he had gone, Mr. Morris went to a box hanging against the wall, and turning a handle began talking to the box as if it were a human being.  Though it was just a plain wooden box, the admiral said there was something mysterious about it, for Mr. Morris actually seemed to be carrying on a conversation with it, though the bird could not hear what the box answered, but he felt sure it talked back.  Mr. Morris' residence was a fine stone house with wide porches and sunny bay windows, over which were trained graceful creeping vines.  A boy of about eleven years of age and a very pretty lady stood arm in arm on the broad steps leading up to the front entrance that evening when Mr. Morris and the admiral arrived.  They were Johnny Morris and his mother, who had already learned that Mr. Morris had bought the bird and would bring it when he came to dinner.  The admiral discovered the next day that Mrs. Morris owned a box like the one at the office, into which she talked, and that it was called a telephone.  He often mentioned this mysterious box as one of the most remarkable things he saw during his stay among men.  Johnny Morris capered and danced and jumped so hard in the exuberance of his joy at receiving the redbird that all the way to the sitting room his mother was coaxing him to be quiet.  \"Don't act so foolishly,\" she begged; but he only capered and kicked up his heels still harder.  When the cage was placed on a stand in the bay window he pranced around it, whistled and chirped, threw the bottom of the cage floor full of seed and splashed the water about so recklessly in his attempts to be friendly as nearly to frighten the poor admiral to pieces.  \"Now, Johnny, don't,\" pleaded his mother.  \"Johnny, don't do that,\" commanded his father every few minutes.  It was a constant \"Don't, Johnny, do this\" and \"Don't, Johnny, do that,\" until, the admiral said, the conversation was so mixed up with \"Don't-Johnny's\" as made it almost unintelligible.  Of course these expostulations made not a bit of impression on Johnny Morris.  To be sure, he might stop for the moment, but the next second he was doing something else which brought a fresh round of \"Don't-Johnny's\" from each parent.  He was such a generous, affectionate, pretty boy, with his rosy cheeks and wavy yellow hair, it was a great pity that he should keep a whole household in a state of constant commotion by his habit of not promptly minding when he was spoken to.  His father and mother were very indulgent to him, and the admiral believed he had every kind of a toy known to the boy world.  He also had a machine to ride on, which they called a \"wheel.\"  On this he went out occasionally, although Mrs. Morris declared she never felt at ease a minute while he was gone, because he never came back at the hour he promised he would.  Besides this, he had a dear little pony, named Jock, on whose back he often cantered about the big park.  Frequently from the bay window the admiral watched him as he mounted Jock and rode away, while his mother stood on the house step and called after him as long as he was in sight: \"Don't ride in that reckless way, Johnny; you'll tumble off,\" or \"Don't, Johnny; the pony will throw you,\" at which Johnny would laugh and make the pony go faster.  Among the boy's other possessions was a parrot, which the admiral asserted was the smartest bird in the world.  She was a highly educated parrot, and much time had been spent on her training, and she was usually very willing to show off to company all her various accomplishments.  Occasionally she assumed an air of offended dignity when asked to display her talents, and no amount of threats or coaxing could change her purpose.  At such times she impatiently flapped her wings and croaked \"No, no\" in her harshest tones.  Her favorite retreat when her temper was ruffled was on the back of an armchair, where she would sit with her bill in the air and her head cocked disdainfully on one side, pretending not to hear or see any one. In her affable moods, however, no one could be more complaisant and entertaining than Bessie.  Her name was an uncommon one for a parrot.  Strangers usually accosted her as Polly, at which mistake she was greatly displeased.  \"No, no--not Polly; call me Bessie,\" she would scream, so angrily that it always made people laugh, which angered her still more.  Bessie could sing a verse of an old-time song, at least she thought she could.  The admiral said nothing could have induced him to sing for company if his voice had been as harsh and cracked as hers, but he said it was a fact that everybody seemed to enjoy her noise more than his music; that when she took up her position on top of the piano to sing, they crowded around and called her \"nice Bessie,\" \"nice lady,\" and praised her, and gave her bits of sugar, as if she were the finest singer in the world.  The admiral thought they showed very poor taste, for her music was simply horrid and couldn't compare with the warblings of the woods birds.  It is well, however, to make allowance for the admiral's opinion, for musicians are proverbially jealous of each other.  The song the parrot sang was \"Listen to the Mocking Bird,\" to which Mrs. Morris played a little gliding accompaniment on the piano.  Great hand-clappings always followed the performance.  These Bessie accepted with an air of studied indifference.  But if for the purpose of teasing her they did not applaud her performance, she shrilly screamed: \"Bessie's a good bird, a good bird I tell you,\" raising her voice higher and higher at each repetition.  Then she would wait a moment for some one to assure her that she was indeed a very good bird, quite the smartest bird that ever breathed. But if these soothing assurances were not quickly forthcoming, she would retire to the back of her favorite chair and, elevating her bill to show her disdain, sulk in silence.  \"Did she like you?\" I asked the admiral one day when he was telling us about her funny tricks.  \"No, she was a little bit jealous of me; yet she was not unfriendly, except when Johnny or some other member of the family paid me attention.  She always wanted to be the center of attraction herself, which showed she was a vain creature.  No matter how silent she had been or how firmly she might have refused to talk only the minute before, if Johnny came to my cage and called, 'Hello, Admiral! you're a daisy,' Bessie immediately struck up such a chattering as would almost deafen one.  \"'Johnny dear, open my cage.  I want to take a walk,' she would say in her most coaxing manner.  If she happened to be already out of her cage and walking about the room, she endeavored to get him to leave me by saying: 'Here, Johnny, boy, put me on your finger.  Kiss poor Bessie--p-o-o-r Bessie.'  \"Mrs. Morris used to laugh at these schemes of the parrot to attract notice, and said Bessie reminded her of some people she had met who always wanted to monopolize the conversation.\"  \"Monopolize?\" said I.  \"That's a large word.  I don't know the meaning of it.\"  \"Well, I think it means getting the most of anything and crowding other people out,\" replied the admiral; \"and it was true in Bessie's case, for she always wanted the most attention.  A gentleman friend of the Morrises had this habit too.  He had been a general in a war that took place in the South a good many years ago, and was often entertained at dinner at the Morrises'.  Though he was a well-informed, genial man, he was almost rude in making himself heard, so determined was he that people should listen to his jokes and stories, which were generally something about himself.  At a large tableful of guests, General Peterson's voice was always heard above that of every one else.  He seemed to compel the rest of the company to listen.  His big voice drowned the others out.  Though Mr. and Mrs. Morris liked him very much, when they were alone they often ridiculed this disagreeable habit.  \"'Bessie and General Peterson are just alike,' Mrs. Morris used to say jokingly, when the parrot pushed herself into notice by her loud jabbering.  'Neither of them can endure to have any one else receive attention when they are present.'  \"Although Bessie had not a pony to ride on as Johnny had, she took a great many jaunts around the parlors on the cat's back.  This cat was a great pet in the house.  A very striking-looking cat he was too.  He was jet black with a flat face and long white whiskers.  Johnny always said he resembled an old colored man who used to be their coachman, and he wondered if they were any relation to each other.  \"When Bessie was out of her cage the cat"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16255"],["title","Dickey Downy: The Autobiography of a Bird (#5)"],["body"," not often visit the parlor, because he was afraid of her.  He always appeared to be much relieved when she did not notice him.  If she had decided to take a ride, however, he never was quick enough to get away from her.  With a shrill laugh of triumph she would fly upon his back, and holding on by digging her claws into his fur, around and around the room they would go, the poor cat feeling so completely disgraced that he dragged his body lower and lower at every step, until his legs could scarcely be seen at all.  \"Bessie enjoyed it greatly.  She seemed to take a wicked satisfaction in making poor Jett ridiculous, and laughed and chuckled and scolded till the cat looked as if he were ready to drop from very shame. Urging him on with, 'Get up, get up, you lazy thing,' she refused to be shaken off till his body was actually dragging on the floor, a sign of his complete humiliation.  As soon as he threw off his unwelcome burden, Jett always ran away to hide.  With his tail slinking, his ears drooping, and crawling rather than walking, he was the most abject-looking, miserable cat in existence.  Bessie meanwhile flirted herself saucily and chuckled with the conscious air of having done a very smart thing.\"     CHAPTER VI  THE PARROT AT A PARTY    A parrot there I saw, with gaudy pride   Of painted plumes, that hopped from side to side.   \"How did you happen to get away from the Morrises?\" asked my brother.  The red-bird laughed heartily, as if the recollection were exceedingly amusing.  \"Well,\" said he, \"it all came about through Johnny's having a tea party.  For months he had been coaxing and begging his mother to invite his schoolfellows to the house and entertain them with games and plays and music, ending with a fine supper.  Early in the spring when he began talking of it, it was too cold, his mother said.  Then after a while it was too rainy, or too warm, or they were house-cleaning, or something, and so she kept putting him off from one time to another, hoping by deferring it to make him forget it.  The Morrises always spent the month of August at their seaside cottage, and the night before they left home, Johnny tried to get Mrs. Morris to promise that he might have the party the very first thing on their return.  \"'I'll think about it, my dear,' she answered.  \"'Whenever you say you'll think about it then I'm pretty sure not to get what I want,' sighed Johnny.\"  [Illustration:  The Summer Tanager.]  \"His mother seemed to be much amused at this statement.  'Oh, no, my son, it doesn't always turn out that way; but you know it wouldn't do for me to promise to have it just as soon as we get back,' she objected.  'I am always very busy just at our return.  It might be very inconvenient for me to prepare for a children's evening at that time; but when I am ready I shall take pleasure in getting up a nice party for you sometime in the autumn.'  \"This sounded well, but it was not definite enough to suit Johnny. However he said no more at that time.  While the family were gone Bessie and I had the back porch to ourselves, and no one being there except the housemaid to whom she could display her superiority over me, she grew to be quite agreeable.  For some time before the Morrises had bought her, which was years and years before, long before Johnny was born, she had lived in a taxidermist's shop.  The owner of the shop was also a bird dealer in a small way.  On account of her accomplishments he had held her at a price that few were willing or able to pay, and so she had been forced to stay with him a long time.  She much preferred being owned by a refined family to living in a dingy store, for she was a bird of luxurious tastes, she said.  \"I too had never ceased being glad that the grocer had sold me to the Morrises, for I was sure that life would not have been so comfortable for me in the back part of a country store, inhaling the odors from fish barrels and molasses kegs, and with the dreary outlook afforded by shelves full of canned vegetables and cracker boxes.  The only point in favor of a life at the grocery was that I would have been nearer to the woods; but if I could not be in the woods, of what avail was that?  The Morrises were people of elegance and refinement, and their home expressed their culture.  I had made a pleasant exchange, and I felt it was wise to be as contented as possible.  \"August slowly passed, and Johnny came back.  The big house that had been so quiet for four weeks was suddenly wakened as from a sleep.  His noisy, joyous voice rang through the halls, and from cellar to garret.  \"'Bless the b'y! he's that plazed to git back, it does one's sowl good to hear him,' said the housemaid.  \"Mrs. Morris was so busy for the first day or two that she saw little of Johnny.  He was sent on several errands, and took his own time in returning, but every one had too much to do to inquire what kept him so long.  \"'Can't I shine up Bessie's and the admiral's cages?' he asked his mother after dinner the second day.  \"Mrs. Morris was delighted with her son's thoughtfulness.  'Why, Johnny,' she said, 'I'll be so glad to have you do it.'  \"So master Johnny wiped and dusted our cages till we felt very clean, although I own I did not enjoy having him work about me with his brush and dust cloth.  Just as he had finished and put us back in our places the doorbell sounded, and presently we heard children's voices in the hall asking the maid if Johnny Morris was at home.  \"'It is some one to see you,' said Mrs. Morris.  But Johnny did not reply.  He was nowhere to be seen.  At the first sound he had quietly slipped out of the room and I could now see him hiding behind the curtains in the library.  Soon Sarah came ushering three or four little barefooted children into the parlor.  \"'They've come to Johnny's party, ma'am,' she explained to Mrs. Morris, who looked up from her work as the children entered.  \"'How do you do, my dears?' said Mrs. Morris sweetly, though I could see she was greatly surprised.  'I believe I don't know your names, so you will have to introduce yourselves.'  \"The children looked bashful, and made no reply.  \"'You are not Johnny Morris' schoolmates, are you?' she questioned.  \"'No, ma'am,' answered the tallest girl, as she gazed about the handsome room with wide-open eyes, I could see that she was not accustomed to such beautiful things.  \"Where did you get acquainted with him, then?' went on Mrs. Morris kindly.  \"'We hain't acquainted at all, ma'am; but he seed us on the street this morning, and said for us to come to his party to-day.  He thought as how maybe they'd be ice-cream to eat, and he told us where he lived, and so we are here.'  \"'Well, we must try to make you have a pleasant time,' she replied. 'Sarah, please call Johnny and tell him his guests have arrived.'  \"But Sarah had been answering a second peal of the bell, and now appeared with a very queer smile on her face at the head of a line of three girls and a small boy, whom she introduced by saying:  \"'A few more children, ma'am, who have come to take tea with master Johnny.'  \"'Why, really,' exclaimed Mrs. Morris, in a sort of flutter, as she helped Sarah to seat the new arrivals.  'The house is hardly in order for company.'  \"The children appeared quite embarrassed, and ranged themselves silently and sedately on the chairs to which they had been directed.  \"'Dear me, Sarah, what a predicament to be in!  Where do you suppose Johnny scraped up all these youngsters?  I don't know what I ought to do to him for playing me this trick.'  Mrs. Morris said this to the maid as they came to my side of the room.  'Think of all the work to be done, and which will have to be stopped for the day--the house all upside down--no chance for preparations for an extra supper for his company.  And that big girl bespoke ice-cream as soon as she entered.' And then Mrs. Morris and Sarah turned into the recess of the bay window and laughed softly.  Her vexation seemed to pass away in a few minutes, for she added, 'We must make the best of it, since they are here, and let everything else go.  But there's the bell; I expect it's another batch of Johnny's friends.'  \"And so it proved, for these were old acquaintances, eight or ten of his schoolmates.  Little misses dressed in fine style, in dainty ruffled frocks and necklaces and bright hair-ribbons, tripped gracefully in and advanced to meet Mrs. Morris, quite like grown ladies in their manners.  Behind them came several boys, spick and span in fresh white linen waists and silk neckties and well-fitting shoes.  \"'Ah! here are Frances and Naomi and Justice and Karl and Mary Ethel and Philip and Jessica and all the rest,' said Mrs. Morris, giving them each a hand of welcome as they gathered about her in a pretty group. 'Will you make yourselves quite at home and help me to entertain these other visitors till Johnny comes in?  I don't know what keeps him so long.  If you'll excuse me I'll go and look for him.  There are the pictures in the portfolio that you might like to show to these little girls.  And there's the admiral, our redbird, and Bessie, the parrot. Maybe they would like to look at them.'  \"The two girls whom she had designated as Jessica and Frances looked at the strange children a minute but made no movement to carry out Mrs. Morris' wishes.  Instead they drew a little apart and began to talk to each other.  Mary Ethel, a round-faced girl who giggled a great deal behind her fan, crossed over to where sat the large girl who had mentioned the ice-cream, and started a conversation by remarking that it was a warm day.  The girl made no audible answer, only nodded.  \"'Do you like to go to school?' inquired Mary Ethel.  \"The girl again nodded.  There was a little pause.  Mary Ethel, who was bent on carrying out Mrs. Morris' suggestion to help her entertain them, began again on the weather.  I suppose she couldn't think of anything new to say, so she observed:  \"'It's a nice warm day for the "]]]
