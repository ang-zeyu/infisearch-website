Which of you thanes is Eadmund the Atheling?\"  Then Eadmund rose up from his place, and went towards the king. His seat had been in shadow, else there had been no need to ask which was he.  \"I have heard of you, King Olaf,\" he said, \"for your deeds are sung in our land already. And you are most welcome. Have you news from England?\"  So those two grasped each other's hands, and I think there were no two other such men living at that time. It was good to see them together.  \"Aye,\" said the king, \"I have been in England, and therefore I have come to find you. Swein is dead, and your chance has come. Let me help you to win your land again.\"  That was plain speaking, and for the moment Eadmund held his breath, and could not speak for sheer surprise and gladness. But I could not forbear leaping up and shouting, tossing my helm in the air as I did so, so wondrous was all this to me, and so full of hope.  At that Olaf laughed, and leaving Eadmund to his thoughts, turned to me.  \"Which of the athelings are you?\" he asked. \"I have heard of Eadmund's brothers,\" and he held out his strong hand to take mine.  \"I am but the atheling's comrade--his servant, rather,\" I said, growing red as I did so, for I had surely forgotten myself in my gladness.  \"Redwald is no servant, King Olaf,\" said Eadmund quickly. \"He is my closest comrade here, and has fought well at my side. Thane of Bures in East Anglia he is--but now the Danes hold his place.\"  \"Why then,\" said Olaf, \"Thoralf's grandson surely?\"  \"Aye, king,\" I answered, wondering; \"my grandfather was named Thoralf. He was one of Olaf Tryggvesson's chiefs.\"  \"Then have I found a cousin,\" laughed the king. \"Give me your hand, kinsman,\" and he looked me over from head to foot, but very kindly.  I took the king's hand gladly, but somewhat dazed in my mind at being thus owned. And Olaf saw that I was so, and told me more.  \"Asta, my good mother, was this Thoralf's cousin, and we Norsemen do not lose count of our kin. So I knew well that Thoralf found an English home and wife when Olaf Tryggvesson was first in England, and that he was Thane of Bures by some right of his lady. So I knew, when I heard your name and place, that I had found a kinsman. And I have so few that I am glad.\"  Now I knew that this was true, but we had never thought much of Thoralf, rather priding ourselves on his wife's long descent from King Redwald. I wished for the first time now that I knew more of this Norse grandfather of mine.  \"Presently we will find Rani, my foster father, who is with the ships,\" said Olaf; \"he knew Thoralf well. You and I must see much of one another, cousin.\"  Then he turned to Eadmund, who was, as it seemed, well pleased that I had found so good a friend. And he said:  \"Forgive me if I have forgotten greater matters for a moment. But I cannot greet a kinsman coldly, and it is in my mind that Redwald is a cousin worth finding, if I may judge by the way in which he hailed my news.\"  \"Truly,\" said Eadmund, \"I am minded to do as he did, now that I have taken all the wonder of it in. But it seems over good to be true--Swein dead--and your offered help!\"  Then they both laughed, well content, and so Eadmund called the steward, and wine and meat were set for the king, and they sat down and talked, as he ate with a sailor's hunger. But I listened not to their talk, my mind being over full of this good fortune of my own. I had none left of my own kin, and till today I had been as it were alone.  Presently, however, I heard an East Anglian name that was dear to me. Eadmund asked how it was that Swein Forkbeard had died, for none thought that his end was yet to be thought of as near. Now it would seem that he had gone suddenly.  \"He was at Gainsborough,\" said Olaf, \"and he was about to make his way south to Eadmund's burg. Whereon men say that to save his town and shrine the holy martyr, King Eadmund, whom Ingvar slew, thrust Swein through with an iron lance. Some say that he slew him otherwise, but all agree as to his slayer. And now I think that England will rise.\"  \"What of Cnut, Swein's son?\" asked Eadmund.  \"He is but a boy. What he may be in a few years' time I know not. With him it will be as with myself. I was given a ship when I was twelve years old, and thereafter all that my men did goes to my credit in the mouths of the scalds. Yet my men and I know well that Rani, my foster father, whom you will soon know, was the real captain and leader for the first three or four years.\"  Then said Eadmund:  \"Cnut is of no account.\"  Olaf laughed a little, and answered:  \"Cnut's own arm may be of little strength, but his name is on the lips of every Dane. There are three chiefs who will hold the kingdom in his name, and they are the men whom you must meet: Thorkel the High, his foster father; Ulf Sprakalegsson the jarl, his brother-in-law; and Eirik the jarl, whose brother Homing holds London even now. Good men and loyal they are, and what they do Cnut does.\"  \"I have three chiefs in my mind who can match these,\" said our atheling. \"Olaf the king, and Ulfkytel of East Anglia, and Edric Streone, my foster father.\"  Then Olaf looked in the face of Eadmund, as it seemed to me in surprise, and made no answer.  \"Are we not equal then?\" asked the atheling.  \"I have heard that Edric Streone is on the Danish side,\" said Olaf. \"Cannot Utred of Northumbria be trusted?\"  \"Edric has but sought rest, from need,\" answered Eadmund. \"I know not what else he could do at last. He will join us again as soon as we land. So also will Utred.\"  \"Then we are equal,\" said the king, while a cloud seemed to pass from his face, for Streone led all Mercia, and were he in truth on our side things would go well. It was no very secret talk among some of us that Edric the earl had made peace sooner than might have been, but that angered Eadmund and the king sorely if so much were even hinted.  \"Then you will indeed help us?\" said Eadmund, for Olaf had accepted the place he had named for him as it were.  \"I have a debt to England that I can never repay,\" answered the king gravely. \"She gave us our first teachers in the Christian faith. And Swein has held Norway, my own land, with the help of the heathen jarls who are yet there. I fight the fight of the Cross, therefore, and when I go back to my own land, it will be to sweep away the last worship of Odin and Thor. But the time has not come yet,\" and his eyes shone strangely.  \"When it comes I will help you,\" said Eadmund, \"if it may be that I can do so.\"  \"I know it, and I thank you; but it is my thought that I shall need no help,\" said the king, while the look on his face was very wondrous, so that I had never seen the like. It minded me of the pictures of St. Stephen that I saw in a great church here with Abbot Elfric and Eadward. Then he spoke of the spread of the Faith in Norway, and how that he would be the one who should finish what Olaf Tryggvesson, his cousin, had begun; and one might see that he longed for power and kingship only for that work.  Long did those two warriors talk before they turned to lighter matters, and in the end they planned to ride to Rouen to see the king himself on the next day. But before night fell there came more news with another ship that came alone into the haven. And she was English, bearing messengers from the great witan itself.  These thanes told Eadmund their news, and it was this:  That Cnut had been hailed as king by the Danish host at Gainsborough, but that the English people begged Ethelred to return to them, promising that a good force should be ready to meet him on his landing. Already the London folk had planned a rising there and in the great towns against the Thingmen, as the Danish paid garrisons were called, and it was likely that this had by this time come about.  So at once Eadmund went with these thanes to Rouen, and Olaf would have me bide with him till word came from the king as to the next doings.  That was a pleasant time to me, for I grew to love Olaf, and he was never willing that I should be far from him. Then, too, I heard many tales of my grandfather Thoralf from Rani, the old viking who had fought beside him, and had been with Tryggvesson when he was christened in England. And of all Olaf's men I liked best Ottar the Black, the scald, who was but five years older than myself, but who had yet seen much fighting with the king both by land and sea. We sang much together, for I was willing to learn from him, and he to teach me.  Now of this singing there is one thing that I will set down, for the matter comes into my story again.  One day Ottar sang the saga of the sword of Hiorvard; how the maiden warrior won it from the grave mound of her father, Angantyr, in spite of terror of the dead hero, and of the unearthly fires. That was a good saga, and when it was ended old Rani said:  \"Thoralf had a sword that was won by his father from a chief's grave mound in Vendland, It was the most wondrous sword, save only Olaf's 'Hneitir' yonder, that I have ever seen. Silver and gold was its hilt, and the blade was wrought in patterns on the steel, and there were runes in gold close to the hilt. He would call it 'Foe's Bane', and that in truth was what the sword was.\"  I knew only too well that that sword became my father's in his turn, and now it was lost to me.  \"My father fell with sword 'Foe's Bane' in his hand,\" I said sadly. \"Yet I know that the name was not belied ere he did so.\"  \"Then the Danes have it,\" said Rani, \"and it will come back to you.\"  I remembered that Ethelred himself had spoken of the sword, and how I had made his face fall when he heard that it was lost. Nor had I been long at court before I heard words from one thane or another that seemed to say that Edric"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16196"],["title","King Olaf's Kinsman (#5)"],["body","had made light of our defeat, for some reasons of his own.  \"I must win it back,\" I said.  \"If there is aught in old sayings,\" answered Ottar, \"the sword will draw its holder to face you, unless he won it in fair fight hand to hand.\"  Thereat Olaf laughed, and no more was said. But in years to come there were told strange tales of the longing, as it were, of his own sword 'Hneitir' to be back at its master's side.  So the time went quickly for me, but to Olaf the waiting seemed long before Eadmund rode back from Rouen. And with him came those thanes and his half-brother Eadward, but Ethelred himself was not with them. He would not go to England, fearing treachery as it seemed; but Eadward was to go over and meet the witan and speak with them. Yet the thanes said that without the king no force would move.  \"Why does he not go?\" said Olaf impatiently. \"Here is time lost when a sudden blow would win all.\"  \"Because he is Ethelred the Unredy,\" answered Eadmund shortly, for he was very angry at the delay.  Then was another waiting, but Eadward was very wise though he was so young, being but twelve years old at this time, and he had Elfric the abbot with him, and at last word came from him that all was going well. Then Ethelred made up his mind and listened to Olaf's counsel.  \"Strike at London,\" he said. \"We know that the citizens are ever loyal.\"  They had risen, as it seemed, and had slain many of the thingmen, and Heming, Thorkel's brother, himself. That had but brought on them hardships and a stronger garrison, while Ethelred wavered and would not come.  At last Ethelred gathered what few men would follow him from Normandy and sailed to go to Southampton, and so to Winchester. Richard the Duke gave him a few ships and men enough to man them. Then Olaf, as it was planned, would sail up the Thames in such time as to meet the king's land force at London on a certain day, and thus take the city by a double attack. And Olaf asked that I might sail with him.  That Eadmund gladly agreed to, saying that we should meet on London Bridge shortly, and so I saw him set out full of hope, and then waited with Olaf for the short time that he would yet stay before sailing. He would not reach the Thames too early lest London should be held in too great force for us, and it was his plan that we should sail up the great river too suddenly for any new Danish force to be gathered.  Now on the evening before we sailed Olaf the king was restless, and silent beyond his wont at the feasting before departure, and he seemed to take little pleasure even in the songs of Ottar the scald, though the men praised them loudly. I thought it likely that some foreboding was on him, and that is no good sign before a fight.  So presently I spoke to Rani, asking him if aught ailed the king. Whereat he answered, smiling:  \"Nought ails him but longing to be sword to sword with these old foes of ours. This is his way, ever. If he were gay as Biorn the marshal yonder I might wonder at him maybe.\"  But presently Olaf rose up and bade Rani take his place, saying that he would go down to the ships to see that all was well. And then he beckoned me to follow him, and we went down the long hall together. It would seem that this was no new thing that he should leave the feast there, for the little hush that fell as we passed the long tables lasted no long time, and the men seemed not surprised. Indeed King Olaf had little love for sitting over the ale cup, and no man was more careful to see to all things about his ships and men than he.  The great doors closed after us, and we stood in the white moonlight for a moment. The air was cold and sharp after the warmth of the crowded hall. Down in the harbour the water was quiet enough, but outside a fair breeze was blowing from the southwest.  \"The wind will hold, and will serve us well,\" said Olaf. \"Who of all the Danish hosts will deem that such a wind is bringing fire and sword on them from across the sea?\"  Then he folded his cloak round him and we went down to the harbour, where the long line of ships lay side by side along the wharf with their bows shoreward. The great dragon stem heads towered over us, shining strangely in the moonlight, and the gentle send of the waves into the harbour made them sway and creak as though they were coming to life.  \"The dragons are restless as I,\" he said looking up at them.  \"Tomorrow, hungry ones--tomorrow--then shall you and I be set free to meet wind and wave and foe again.\"  Then one of the men on watch began to sing, and his song was an old sea stave that had a swing and roll in its rough tune that was like the broken surge of sea water, even while it was timed to the fall of oar blades into the surf. One may not say how old those songs are that the seamen sing.  \"That is the dragon's answer,\" said the king to me. \"Sing, Redwald, and take your part.\"  So when the man came to the part where all should join, I took up the song with him, and then many others of the men joined in--some five or six in each ship.  \"That is good,\" said Olaf, laughing softly. \"Here are men whose hearts are light.\"  The man who sang first came now and looked over the high bows of the ship, and his figure was black against the moonlight.  \"Ho, master scald!\" he cried in his great voice, \"now shall you sing the rest. You have put me out of conceit with my own singing. Why are you not at the feast, where I would be if I were not tied here!\"  \"He is keeping the dragons awake,\" laughed the king. \"Nor do I think that even a feast would take you from the ship just as the tide is on the turn.\"  \"Maybe not, lord king,\" answered the man, lifting his hand in salute. \"But the dragons will be wakeful enough--never fear for them.\"  So the king answered back cheerily, and other men came and listened, and so at last he turned away, leaving the men who loved him pleased and the happier for his coming thus.  Now I thought that we should have gone back to the hall; but Olaf walked away from the town, going along the shore. The tide was just out, and the flow would soon begin. Soon we lost sight of the last lights from the houses, and still he went on, and I followed him, not speaking, for I knew not what plans he was making.  At last we came to a place to which I had not been before, and it was lonely enough. The forest came down to the beach, and the land was low and sheltered between the hills. There the king stayed, sitting down on a fallen tree and resting his chin on his hand, as he looked out over the water with grave eyes that seemed to see far beyond the tossing waves.  I rested beside him, and there we bided silent for an hour or more. There was only the sound of the wind in the storm-twisted trees behind us, and of the waves as they broke along the edge of the bare sands, where a few waking sea birds ran and piped unseen by us. Almost had I slept with those well-known sounds in my ears.  Then suddenly the king lifted his head, and spoke one word to me:  \"Listen,\" he said.  I roused, but all that I could hear at first were the sounds that I had forgotten--the song of the wind in the trees, the rush of the breakers, and the cry of the sea birds across the sands.  Then my heart began to beat wildly, for out of these sounds, or among them, began to come clearly, and yet more clearly the sound of the tread of many armed feet--the passing of a mighty host--and with that the thunder of the war song, and the cry of those who bade farewell. And these sounds passed over us and around us, going seawards; then they died away out towards the north, and were gone.  Yet still the king listened, and again came the tramp of the armed thousands, and the war song, and the voices of parting, and they passed, and came, and passed yet once more.  Then after the third time there was nought but the sound of wind and wave and sea fowl, and I drew closer to Olaf and asked him:  \"What is this that we hear?\"  \"Wait,\" he said, and pointed seaward.  Then I looked, and I saw all the northern sky glow red as glows the light of a burning town on the low clouds when the host that has fired it looks back on its work. And plain and clear in the silver moonlight against the crimson sky sat the wraith of a king, throned on the sand at the very water's edge, and round him stood shadowy nobles, looking seaward.  And even as I saw it the first wave of the rising tide sent its edge of foam shorewards, and it surged around the kingly feet and sapped the base of the throne, and the stately wraith turned and looked upon the nobles, and was gone.  Then faded the red light from the sky, and the waves washed over the place where the throne and court had been, and Olaf rose up and looked in my face. Nor was there fear of what he had seen and heard written in his quiet look.  \"What is this, my king?\" I said, trembling with the fear that comes of things beyond our ken.  \"It is the fate of England that is falling on her,\" he said quietly.  \"Read it me, for I fear what I have heard and seen,\" I said.  \"We have heard the going of mighty hosts to England, and we have heard the sound of farewell. But we have heard no shout of victory, or wailing for defeat. Little therefore will be gained or lost by this sailing of ours. Yet all is surely lost if we sail not.\"  Then he ceased, but he had not yet spoken of what we saw, and I waited for his words. Yet still he stood silent, and looked out over the sea, until I was fain to ask him what the vision meant.  \"Surely it was the wraith of a son of Swein that we saw,\" he said; \"but it will be long years ere Cnut bears that likeness, for that was of a man full grown and mighty.\"  Now the reading of this was beyond me, for I have no skill in these matters, as had Olaf. And he said nought for a little while, but seemed to ponder over it.  \"Now I know,\" said he at last. \"What we have seen is the outcome of the going of the hosts to England. There shall be a Danish kingdom built upon sand. Cnut shall reign, but his"]]]
