No English chronicler mentions the presence of King Olaf the Saint in England; but the two churches dedicated to him at either end of London Bridge, where his greatest deed was wrought, testify to the gratitude of the London citizens towards the viking chief who rescued their city from the Danes, and brought back the king of their own race towards whom their loyalty was so unswerving.  The deeds of King Olaf recorded in this story of his kinsman are therefore from the Norse \"Saga of King Olaf the Holy,\" and the various incidents are assigned as nearly as may be to their place in the sequence of events given from the death of Swein to the accession of Cnut, in the contemporary Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which is our most reliable authority for the period.  The place where King Olaf fought his seventh battle, \"Ringmereheath in Ulfkyl's land,\" is doubtful. To have localized it, therefore, on a traditional battlefield in Suffolk, where a mound and field names point to a severe forgotten fight in the line which a southern invader would take between Colchester and Sudbury, may be pardonable for the purposes of Redwald's story.  With regard to other historic incidents in the tale, some are from the Danish \"Knytlinga\" and \"Jomsvikinga\" Sagas, which alone give us the age of Cnut on his accession to the throne, and recount the interception of Queen Emma by Thorkel's men on her projected flight. In the ordinary course of history the age of the wise king is disregarded, and the doings of the three great jarls are naturally enough credited to him, for after the first few years of confusion have been passed over, he takes his place as the greatest of our rulers since Alfred, and his age is forgotten in his wonderful policy.  The doings of Edric Streone are partly from the hints give by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and partly from the accounts of later English writers. But there is no chronicle of either English, Danish, or Norse origin which does not hold him and his treachery in the utmost scorn.  The account of the battle of Ashingdon follows the definite local traditions of the place. The line of the river banks have changed but little, and Cnut's earthworks still remain at Canewdon. The first battlefield is yet known, and they still tell how Eadmund was forced to fight on Ashingdon hill because his way across the ford was barred by the Danish ships, and how the pursuit of the routed English ended at Hockley.  Wulfnoth and his famous son Godwine are of course historic. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle tells us how the earl was driven into sullen enmity with Ethelred by Streone's brother, and the Danish Sagas record Godwine's first introduction by Jarl Ulf to Cnut after the battle of Sherston.  As for the places mentioned in Redwald's story, the well on Caldbec hill still has its terrors for the village folk, and the destruction of the ancient mining village at Penhurst by the Danes is remembered yet with strange tales of treasure found among its stone buildings. The Bures folk still speak of the White Lady of the Mere, and their belief that Boadicea lies under the great mound is by no means unlikely to be a tradition of her true resting place.  C. W. WHISTLER  STOCKLAND, Nov. 1896.    Chapter 1: The Coming Of The Vikings.   All along our East Anglian shores men had watched for long, and now word had come from Ulfkytel, our earl, that the great fleet of Swein, the Danish king, had been sighted off the Dunwich cliffs, and once again the fear of the Danes was on our land.  And so it came to pass that I, Redwald, son of Siric, the Thane of Bures, stood at the gate of our courtyard and watched my father and our sturdy housecarles and freemen ride away down the hill and across the winding Stour river to join the great levy at Colchester. And when I had seen the last flash of arms sparkle from among the copses beyond the bridge, I had looked on Siric, my father, for the last time in this world, but no thought rose up in my mind that this might be so.  Yet if I stand now where I stood on that day, and see by chance the glimmer of bright arms through green boughs across the river, there comes to me a rush of sadness that dulls the bright May sunshine and the sparkle of the rippling water, and fills the soft May-time wind with sounds of mourning. Now to me it seems that I was thus sad at the time that is brought back to me. But I was not so. It is only the weight of long years of remembrance of what should have been had I known. At that parting I turned back into the hall downcast, only because my father had thought me not yet strong enough to ride beside him, and a little angry and hurt moreover, for I was broad and strong for my sixteen years.  Little thought I that in years to come I should remember all of that leave taking, even to the least thing that happened; but so it is. No man may rightly be said to forget aught. All that he has known and learnt is there, hidden up in his mind to come forth if there is anything that shall call it again to light.  Now my father lies resting among nameless heroes who died for England on Nacton Heath--I know not even which of the great mounds it may be that holds his bones--but he fell before the flight began when Thurketyl Mirehead played the craven. Neither victor nor vanquished was he when his end came, but maybe that is the best end for a warrior after all. Some must fall, and some may live to boast, and some remain to mourn, but to give life for fatherland in hottest strife is good. That is what my father would have wished for himself, and I at least sorrow but for myself and not for him.  Now I have spoken of remembrance, and I will add this word--that some things in a man's life can never be set aside from his memory. Waking or sleeping they come back to him. Eight days after that going of my father came such a time to me, so that every least thing is clear to me today as then.  I sat plaiting a leash for my hounds on the settle before the fire in our great hall at Bures, and I remember how the strands of leather thong fell in my hand; I remember how my mother's spinning wheel stopped short with a snapping of broken threads; how the thrall who was feeding the fire stayed with the log in his hands; how the sleepy men at the lower end of the hall sprang up with heavy words checked on their lips before the lady's presence; how the maidens screamed--aye, and how the draught swayed the wall hangings, and sent a long train of sparks flying from a half-dead torch, as the great door was thrown open and a man flung himself into our midst, mud splashed and white faced, with hands that quivered towards us as he cried hoarsely:  \"In haste, mistress--you must fly--the Danes--\" and fell like a log at my mother's feet where she sat on the dais, neither moving nor speaking more.  It was Grinkel, the leader of our housecarles {1}. His armour was rent and gashed, and no sword was in the scabbard at his side, and his helm was gone, and now as he fell a bandage slipped from his arm, and slowly the red stream from a great wound ran among the sweet sedges wherewith the floor was strewn.  There came a mist before my eyes, and my heart beat thick and fast as I saw him; but my mother rose up neither screaming nor growing faint, though through her mind, as through mine, must have glanced the knowledge of all that this homecoming of brave Grinkel meant. She stepped from the high place to the warrior's side and hastily rebound the wound, telling the maidens meanwhile to bring wine that she might revive him if he were not already sped.  Then she rose up while the old steward took the wine and tried to force it between the close-set teeth, and she called the farm servants to her.  \"Make ready all the horses and yoke the oxen to the wains,\" she said in a clear voice that would not tremble. \"Send the lads to warn the village folk to fly beyond the river. For Grinkel comes not in this wise for nought. The Danes are on us.\"  Now I remember the grim faces of the men as they went, and I remember the look on the faces of the women as they heard, and in the midst of us seemed to lie terror itself glaring from the set eyes of the dead warrior. And of those memories I will say nought--I would not have them live in the minds of any by day and night as they lived in mine for many a long year thereafter. Many were the tales I had heard of the coming of Ingvar's host in the days of Eadmund our martyred king, who was crowned here at Bures in our own church, and those tales were terrible. Now the like was on us, and I saw that what I had heard was not the half.  The old steward rose up now, shaking his head in sorrow. I think he was too old for fear.  \"Grinkel is dead, lady,\" he said gently, closing the wild eyes as he spoke, and then throwing a cloak from the wall over him. But my mother only said, \"May he rest in peace. What of the Thane?\"  Thereat the steward looked forthright into his lady's face, and spoke bravely for all around to hear:  \"Doubtless the levy is broken for this once, and he bides with Earl Ulfkytel to gather a new and stronger force. The Thane has sent Grinkel on, and he has ridden in over-much haste for a wounded man. He was ever eager.\"  My mother gave"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16196"],["title","King Olaf's Kinsman (#1)"],["body","her old servant's look in silence, and seemed to assent. Yet I, though I was but a lad of sixteen, could see what passed in that look of theirs. I knew that surely my father had fallen, and that need was great for haste.  Then was hurry and hustle in the house as all that was most valuable was gathered, and I myself could but take my arms from the wall, and don mail-shirt and helm and sword and seax {2} and then look on, useless enough, with my thoughts in a whirl all the time.  Presently out of their tangle came one thing clearly to me, and that was that there were others whom I loved to be warned, besides the villagers.  My mother came into the hall again, and stood for a moment like a carven statue looking at the maidens who wrought at packing what they might. She had not wept, but in her face was written sorrow beyond weeping. Yet almost did she weep, when I stood beside her and spoke, putting my hand on her arm.  \"Mother,\" I said, \"I must go to Wormingford and warn them also. My horse will be ready, and I will return to you.\"  Then she looked at me, for as I go over these things I know that this was the first time that I had ever said to her \"I must,\" without asking her leave, in aught that I would do. And she answered me calmly.  \"Aye, that is a good thought. They will need help. Bide with them if need is, and so join us presently on the road. We will fly to London.\"  \"So far, mother?\" I said. \"Surely Colchester will be safe.\"  \"I will go to Ethelred the king,\" she answered. \"He has ever been your father's friend, and will be yours. And I was the queen's maiden in the old days, and she will welcome me. Now go and bring Hertha to me.\"  She turned to her work, and I went out across the courtyard. Already the wains stood there, the teams of sleepy oxen tossing their long horns in the glare of torches. The church bell was clanging the alarm of fire to bring home the men from field or forest if any were abroad so late, for it was an hour after sunset, and there was no moon yet.  The gray horse that my father gave me a year agone stood ready saddled in the stall when I came to the stables. I went and loosed him, while a groom saw me and ran to help, and as I swung into the saddle I saw his face marked with new lines across his forehead.  \"Do you fly first, master?\" he said, with strange meaning in his voice.  \"I go to Wormingford,\" I answered. \"Likely enough, therefore, that I fly last,\" and I laughed.  \"Aye, let me go, master, let me go,\" he said. \"It is like that the Danes are on the road.\"  \"Not yet,\" I said, touched by question and offer alike. \"There is many a mile between here and Ipswich, and I think that to go to Wormingford is my work, surely.\"  So I rode away fast, seeing in the valley below me the lights of the house that I sought. As I had said, the errand was indeed mine.  For at the great house just across the river below the hills lived the one who should be my wife in the days to come--Hertha, daughter of Osgod, the Thane of Wormingford. It was now three years since we had been betrothed with all solemnity in our church, and that had seemed but fit and right, for we were two children who had played together since we could run hand in hand. And my mother had been as a mother also to little Hertha since she was left with only her father to tend her.  Our house and Osgod's were akin, though not near, for we both traced our line from Redwald the first Christian king of East Anglia, whose name I bore. Hertha was two years younger than I.  Now Osgod the Thane had ridden away to the war with my father, and unless he had returned with Grinkel, Hertha was alone in the house with her old nurse and the farm servants. Most surely she would have been at Bures with us but for some spring-time sickness which was among the village children, and from which my mother sought to keep her free. It might be that the thane had returned, but it was in my mind that the manner of Grinkel's coming boded ill to all of us.  So I rode on quickly down the hill towards the river. I knew not how near the Danes might be, but I thought little of them, until suddenly through the dusk I saw a red point of fire flicker and broaden out into flame on a hilltop eastward, where I knew a beacon fire was piled against need. And then from every point along the Stour valley beacon after beacon flashed out in answer, until all the countryside was full of them; and I hurried on more swiftly than before.  Our hall stood on the hill crest above church and village, beyond the reach of creeping river mist and sudden floods, and I rode down the track that crosses the lower road and so comes to the ford below Osgod's place on the Essex side of the river. And when I came to the crossing my horse pricked his ears and snorted, so that I knew there were horsemen about, and I reined up and waited in the lane.  I could hear the quick hoofbeats of two steeds, and all the air was full of the sound of alarm bells, for the evening was very still.  Then up the road from eastward rode two men at an easy gallop, and my horse's manner told me that a stable mate of his was coming, so I feared no longer but went into the main road to meet them.  \"What news?\" I cried, and they halted.  \"It is the young master,\" said one, and I knew the voice of Edred, our housecarle. And when he was close to me I could see that he was in almost as evil plight as had been Grinkel his comrade. The other man I knew not, but he bore a headless spear shaft in his hand, and Edred's shield had a great gash across it.  \"Master, has Grinkel come?\" Edred asked me.  \"Aye, and is dead. He bade us fly, and could say no more. What of my father?\"  The men looked at one another for a moment, and then Edred said very sadly:  \"Woe is me that I must be the bearer of heavy tidings to you and the lady your mother. But what is true is true and must be told. Never has such a battle been fought in East Anglia, and the fortune of war has gone against us.\"  The fear that I had read in my mother's eyes fell cold on me at those words-and I asked again, longing and fearing to know the worst:  \"What of the thane, my father?\"  \"Master, he fell with the first,\" Edred answered with a breaking of his voice. \"Nor might we bring him from the place where he fell. For the Danes swept us from the field at the last like dead leaves in the wind, and there was nought left us but to fly. Two long hours we fought first, and then came flight. They say one man began it. I know not; but it was no man of ours. Now the Danes are marching hitherwards to Colchester.\"  \"What of Osgod of Wormingford?\" I asked.  \"He lies beside our lord. There is a ring of slain round them. I would I were there also,\" the warrior answered.  \"Then were there one less to care for our helpless ones,\" I said. \"All are preparing for flight at Bures. Come with me to Wormingford, and we will warn them. There is work to do for us who are left.\"  \"Aye, master, that is right,\" he said; \"we may fight again and wipe out this business.\"  Then the other man, who belonged to Sudbury, five miles beyond us, bade us farewell, and so rode on with his tale of terror, and Edred followed me across the ford to Osgod's house, which was but a mile from where we met. He told me that Grinkel had found a fresh horse in Stoke village, and so had outstripped him.  Many thralls stood at the gate of Osgod's courtyard as we came there, and they were staring at the beacon fires around us, and listening to the wild bells that rang so strangely. There was a fire blazing now on the green before our own house, and one on the hill above the Wormingford mere, which men say is haunted.  \"I would see your mistress,\" I said as they came and held my horse. I had not been to the house for two days, as it chanced.  Then one ran and brought the house steward, and told him.  \"I know not if that may be, master,\" he said; \"but I will ask Dame Gunnhild.\"  \"Has the lady gone to rest?\" I said, being surprised at this delay.  \"She is not well\" the man said; \"and the dame has not suffered her to rise today.\"  \"Then let me have speech with the dame without delay,\" I said, for this made me uneasy, seeing what need there was for speedy flight.  The steward went in, and I bade the thralls do all that Edred ordered them, telling him to see to what was needed for flight and so I went into the house, and stood by the hall fire waiting for Gunnhild the nurse.  There is nothing in all that wide hall that I cannot remember clearly, even to a place where the rushes were ill strewn on the floor. And the short waiting seemed very long to me.  Then came Gunnhild. She was old, and I feared her, for men said that she was a witch. But she had been in the house of Osgod the Thane since he himself was a child, and Hertha loved her, and that was enough for me. Nor had I any reason to think that the dame had any but friendly feelings towards myself, though her bright eyes and tall figure, and most of all what was said of her, feared me, as I say. Now she came towards me swiftly, and did not wait for me to speak first.  \"What will you at this hour, Redwald?\" she said.  \"Nought but pressing need bade me come thus,\" I answered. \"The levy is broken, and the Danes are on the way to Colchester. My mother flies to London, and you and Hertha must do likewise.\"  \"So your father and hers are slain,\" she said, looking fixedly at me, and standing very still.  \"How know you that?\" I asked sharply, for I had told the steward nothing.  \"By your face, Redwald,\" she said; \"you were but a boy two days agone, now you have a man's work on your hands, and you will do it. Who bade you ride here?\"  \"No one,\" I said, wondering, \"needs must that I should come.\"  \"That is as I thought,\" she said; \"but we cannot fly.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because the sickness that your mother feared is on Hertha, and she cannot go.\"  Now I was ready to weep, but that would be of no use.  \"Is there danger to her?\" I said, and I could not keep my voice from shaking, for"]]]
