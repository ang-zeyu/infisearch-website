Often one of the denizens came to door or window to stare at Nellie and him; sometimes they were accosted with impudent chaff, once or twice with pitiful obscenity.  The first thing that impressed him was the abandonment that thrust itself upon him in the more crowded of these courts and alley-ways and back-streets, the despairing abandonment there of the decencies of living. The thin dwarfed children kicked and tumbled with naked limbs on the ground; many women leaned half-dressed and much unbuttoned from ground floor windows, or came out into the passage-ways slatternly. In one court two unkempt vile-tongued women of the town wrangled and abused each other to the amusement of the neighborhood, where the working poor were huddled together with those who live by shame. The children played close by as heedlessly as if such quarrels were common events, cursing themselves at each other with nimble filthy tongues.  \"There's a friend of mine lives here,\" said Nellie, turning into one of these narrow alleys that led, as they could see, into a busier and bustling street. \"If you don't mind we'll go up and I can help her a bit, and you can see how one sort of sweating is done. I worked at it for a spell once, when dressmaking was slack. In the same house, too.\"  She stopped at the doorway of one of a row of three-storied houses. On the doorstep were a group of little children, all barefooted and more or less ragged in spite of evident attempts to keep some of them patched into neatness. They looked familiarly at Nellie and curiously at Ned.  \"How's mother, Johnny?\" asked Nellie of one of them, a small pinched little fellow of six or seven, who nursed a baby of a year or so old, an ill-nourished baby that seemed wilting in the heat.  \"She's working,\" answered the little fellow, looking anxiously at Nellie as she felt in her pocket.  \"There's a penny for you,\" said Nellie, \"and here's a penny for Dicky,\" patting a little five-year-old on the head, \"and here's one to buy some milk for the baby.\"  Johnny rose with glad eagerness, the baby in his arms and the pennies in his hand.  \"I shall buy 'specks' with mine,\" he cried joyfully.  \"What's 'specks?'\" asked Ned, puzzled, as the children went off, the elder staggering under his burden.  \"'Specks!' Damaged fruit, half rotten. The garbage of the rich sold as a feast to these poor little ones?\" cried Nellie, a hot anger in her face and voice that made Ned dumb.  She entered the doorway. Ned followed her through a room where a man and a couple of boys were hammering away at some boots, reaching thereby a narrow, creaking stairway, hot as a chimney, almost pitch dark, being lighted only by an occasional half-opened door, up which he stumbled clumsily. Through one of these open doors he caught a glimpse of a couple of girls sewing; through another of a woman with a baby in arms tidying-up a bare floored room, which seemed to be bedroom, kitchen and dining room in one; from behind a closed door came the sound of voices, one shrilly laughing. Unused to stairways his knees ached before they reached the top. He was glad enough when Nellie knocked loudly at a door through which came the whirring of a sewing machine. The noise stopped for a moment while a sharp voice called them to \"come in,\" then started again. Nellie opened the door.  At the open window of a small room, barely furnished with a broken iron bedstead, some case boards knocked together for a table and fixed against the wall, a couple of shaky chairs and a box, a sharp featured woman sat working a machine, as if for dear life. The heat of the room was made hotter by the little grate in which a fire had recently been burning and on which still stood the teapot. Some cups and a plate or two, with a cut loaf of bread and a jam tin of sugar, littered the table. The scanty bed was unmade. The woman wore a limp cotton dress of uncertain colour, rolled up at the sleeves and opened at the neck for greater coolness. She was thin and sharp; she was so busy you understood that she had no time to be clean and tidy. She seemed pleased to see Nellie and totally indifferent at seeing Ned, but kept on working after nodding to them.  Nellie motioned Ned to sit down, which he did on the edge of the bed, not caring to trust the shaky chairs. She went to the side of the sharp-featured woman, and sitting down on the foot of the bed by the machine watched her working without a word. Ned could see on the ground, in a paper parcel, a heap of cloth of various colours, and on the bed some new coats folded and piled up. On the machine was another coat, being sewn.  It was ten minutes before the machine stopped, ten minutes for Ned to look about and think in. He knew without being told that this miserable room was the home of the three children to whom Nellie had given the pennies, and that here their mother worked to feed them. Their feeding he could see on the table. Their home he could see. The work that gave it to them he could see. For the first time in his life he felt ashamed of being an Australian.  Finally the machine stopped. The sharp-faced woman took the coat up, bit a thread with her teeth, and laying it on her knee began to unpick the tackings.  \"Let me!\" said Nellie, pulling off her gloves and taking off her hat. \"We came to see you, Ned and I,\" she went on with honest truthfulness, \"because he's just down from the bush, and I wanted him to see what Sydney was like. Ned, this is Mrs. Somerville.\"  Mrs. Somerville nodded at Ned. \"You're right to come here,\" she remarked, grimly, getting up while Nellie took her place as if she often did it. \"You know just what it is, Nellie, and I do, too, worse luck. Perhaps it's good for us. When we're better off we don't care for those who're down. We've got to get down ourselves to get properly disgusted with it.\"  She spoke with the accent of an educated woman, moving to the make-shift table and beginning to \"tidy-up.\" As she passed between him and the light Ned could see that the cotton dress was her only covering.  \"How are the children?\" asked Nellie.  \"How can you expect them to be?\" retorted the other.  \"You ought to wean the baby,\" insisted Nellie, as though it was one of their habitual topics.  \"Wean the baby! That's all very well for those who can buy plenty of milk. It's a pity it's ever got to be weaned.\"  \"Plenty of work this week?\" asked Nellie, changing the subject.  \"Yes; plenty of work this week. You know what that means. No work at all when they get a stock ahead, so as to prevent us feeling too independent I suppose.\" She paused, then added: \"That girl downstairs says she isn't going to work any more. I talked to her a little but she says one might just as well die one way as another, and that she'll have some pleasure first. I couldn't blame her much. She's got a good heart. She's been very kind to the children.\"  Nellie did not answer; she did not even look up.  \"They're going to reduce prices at the shop,\" went on Mrs. Somerville. \"They told me last time I went that after this lot they shouldn't pay as much because they could easily get the things done for less. I asked what they'd pay, and they said they didn't know but they'd give me as good a show for work as ever if I cared to take the new prices, because they felt sorry for the children. I suppose I ought to feel thankful to them.\"  Nellie looked up now--her face flushed. \"Reduce, prices again!\" she cried. \"How can they?\"  \"I don't know how they can, but they can,\" answered Mrs. Somerville. \"I suppose we can be thankful so long as they don't want to be paid for letting us work for them. Old Church's daughter got married to some officer of the fleet last week, I'm told, and I suppose we've got to help give her a send-off.\"  \"It's shameful,\" exclaimed Nellie. \"What they paid two years ago hardly kept one alive, and they've reduced twice since then. Oh! They'll all pay for it some day.\"  \"Let's hope so,\" said Mrs. Somerville. \"Only we'll have to pay them for it pretty soon, Nellie, or there won't be enough strength left in us to pay them with. I've got beyond minding anything much, but I would like to get even with old Church.\"  They had talked away, the two women, ignoring Ned. He listened. He understood that from the misery of this woman was drawn the pomp and pride, the silks and gold and glitter of the society belle, and he thought with a cruel satisfaction of what might happen to that society belle if this half-starved woman got hold of her. Measure for measure, pang for pang, what torture, what insults, what degradation, could atone for the life that was suffered in this miserable room? And for the life of \"that girl downstairs\" who had given up in despair?  \"How about a union now?\" asked Nellie, turning with the first pieces of another coat to the machine.  \"Work's too dull,\" was the answer. \"Wait for a few months till the busy season comes and then I wouldn't wonder if you could get one. The women were all feeling hurt about the reduction, and one girl did start talking strike, but what's the use now? I couldn't say anything, you know, but I'll find out where the others live and you can go round and talk to them after a while. If there was a paper that would show old Church up it might do good, but there isn't.\"  Then the rattle of the machine began again, Nellie working with an adeptness that showed her to be an old hand. Ned could see now that the coats were of cheap coarse stuff and that the sewing in them was not fine tailoring. The cut material in Nellie's hands fairly flew into shape as she rapidly moved it to and fro under the hurrying needle with her slim fingers. Her foot moved unceasingly on the treadle. Ned watching her, saw the great beads of perspiration slowly gather on her forehead and then trickle down her nose and cheeks to fall upon the work before her.  \"My word! But it's hot!\" exclaimed Nellie at last, as the noise stopped for a moment while she changed the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16366"],["title","The Workingman's Paradise: An Australian Labour Novel (#5)"],["body","of her work. \"Why don't you open the door?\"  \"I don't care to before the place is tidy,\" answered Mrs. Somerville, who had washed her cups and plates in a pan and had just put Ned on one of the shaky chairs while she shook and arranged the meagre coverings of the bed.  \"Is he still carrying on?\" enquired Nellie, nodding her head at the partition and evidently alluding to someone on the other side.  \"Of course, drink, drink, drink, whenever he gets a chance, and that seems pretty well always. She helps him sometimes, and sometimes she keeps sober and abuses him. He kicked her down stairs the other night, and the children all screaming, and her shrieking, and him swearing. It was a nice time.\"  Once more the machining interrupted the conversation, which thus was renewed from time to time in the pauses of the noise. The room being \"tidied,\" Mrs. Somerville sat down on the bed and taking up some pieces of cloth began to tack them together with needle and thread, ready for the machine. It never seemed to occur to her to rest even for a moment.  \"Nellie's a quick one,\" she remarked to Ned. \"At the shop they always tell those who grumble what she earned one week. Twenty-four and six, wasn't it, Nellie? But they don't say she worked eighteen hours a day for it.\"  Nellie flushed uneasily and Ned felt uncomfortable. Both thought of the repayment of the latter's friendly loan. The girl made her machine rattle still more hurriedly to prevent any further remarks trending in that direction. At last Mrs. Somerville, her tacking finished, got up and took the work from Nellie's hands.  \"I'm not going to take your whole morning,\" she said. \"You don't get many friends from the bush to see you, so just go away and I'll get on. I'm much obliged to you as it is, Nellie.\"  Nellie did not object. After wiping her hands, face and neck with her handkerchief she put on her gloves and hat. The sharp-faced woman was already at the machine and amid the din, which drowned their good-byes, they departed as they came. Ned felt more at ease when his feet felt the first step of the narrow creaking stairway. It is hardly a pleasant sensation for a man to be in the room of a stranger who, without any unfriendliness, does not seem particularly aware that he is there. They left the door open. Far down the stifling stairs Ned could hear the ceaseless whirring of the machine driven by the woman who slaved ceaselessly for her children's bread in this Sydney sink. He looked around for the children when they got to the alley again but could not see them among the urchins who lolled about half-suffocated now. The sun was almost overhead for they had been upstairs for an hour. The heat in this mere canyon path between cliffs of houses was terrible. Ned himself began to feel queerly.  \"Let's get out of this, Nellie,\" he said.  \"How would you like never to be able to get out of it?\" she answered, as they turned towards the bustling street, opposite to the way they had previously come.  \"Who's that Mrs. Somerville?\" he asked, not answering.  \"I got to know her when I lived there,\" replied Nellie. \"Her husband used to be well off, I fancy, but had bad luck and got down pretty low. There was a strike on at some building and he went on as a laborer, blacklegging. The pickets followed him to the house, abusing him, and made him stubborn, but I got her alone that night and talked to her and explained things a bit and she talked to him and next day he joined the union. Then he got working about as a labourer, and one day some rotten scaffolding broke, and he came down with it. The union got a few pounds for her, but the boss was a regular swindler who was always beating men out of their wages and doing anything to get contracts and running everything cheap, so there was nothing to be got out of him.\"  \"Did her husband die?\"  \"Yes, next day. She had three children and another came seven months after. One died last summer just before the baby was born. She's had a pretty hard time of it, but she works all the time and she generally has work.\"  \"It seems quite a favour to get work here,\" observed Ned.  \"If you were a girl you'd soon find out what a favour it is sometimes,\" answered Nellie quietly, as they came out into the street.    CHAPTER III.   SHORN LIKE SHEEP.  \"How many hours do you work?\" asked Nellie of the waitress.  \"About thirteen,\" answered the girl, glancing round to see if the manager was watching her talking. \"But it's not the hours so much. It's the standing.\"  \"You're not doing any good standing now,\" put in Ned. \"Why don't you sit down and have a rest?\"  \"They don't let us,\" answered the waitress, cautiously.  \"What do they pay?\" asked Nellie, sipping her tea and joining in the waitress' look-out for the manager.  \"Fifteen! But they're taking girls on at twelve. Of course there's meals. But you've got to room yourself, and then there's washing, clean aprons and caps and cuffs and collars. You've got to dress, too. There's nothing left. We ought to get a pound.\"  \"What----\"  \"S-s-s!\" warned the waitress, straightening herself up as the manager appeared.  * * * * *  They were in a fashionable Sydney restaurant, on George-street, a large, painted, gilded, veneered, electro-plated place, full of mirrors and gas-fittings and white-clothed tables. It was not busy, the hour being somewhat late and the day Saturday, and so against the walls, on either side the long halls, were ranged sentinel rows of white-aproned, white-capped, black-dressed waitresses.  They were dawdling over their tea--Ned and Nellie were, not the waitresses--having dined exceedingly well on soup and fish and flesh and pudding. For Ned, crushed by more sight-seeing and revived by a stroll to the Domain and a rest by a fountain under shady trees, further revived by a thunderstorm that suddenly rolled up and burst upon them almost before they could reach the shelter of an awning, had insisted on treating Nellie to \"a good dinner,\" telling her that afterwards she could take him anywhere she liked but that meanwhile they would have something to cheer them up. And Nellie agreed, nothing loth, for she too longed for the momentary jollity of a mild dissipation, not to mention that this would be a favorable opportunity to see if the restaurant girls could not be organised. So they had \"a good dinner.\"  \"This reminds me,\" said Nellie, as she ate her fish, \"of a friend of mine, a young fellow who is always getting hard up and always raising a cheque, as he calls it. He was very hard up a while ago, and met a friend whom he told about it. Then he invited his friend to go and have some lunch. They came here and he ordered chicken and that, and a bottle of good wine. It took his last half-sovereign. When he got the ticket the other man looked at him. 'Well,' he said, 'if you live like this when you're hard up, how on earth do you live when you've got money?'\"  \"What did he say?\" asked Ned, laughing, wondering at the same time how Nellie came to know people who drank wine and spent half-sovereigns on chicken lunches.  \"Oh! He didn't say anything much, he told me. He couldn't manage to explain, he thought, that when he was at work and easy in his mind he didn't care what he had to eat but that when he didn't know what he'd do by the end of the week he felt like having a good meal if he never had another. He thought that made the half-sovereign go furthest. He's funny in some things.\"  \"I should think he was, a little. How did you know him?\"  \"I met him where we're going tonight. He's working on some newspaper in Melbourne now. I haven't seen him or heard of for months.\"  She chatted on, rather feverishly.  \"Did you ever read 'David Copperfield?'\"  Ned nodded, his mouth being full.  \"Do you recollect how he used to stand outside the cookshops? It's quite natural. I used to. It's pretty bad to be hungry and it's just about as bad not to have enough. I know a woman who has a couple of children, a boy and a girl. They were starving once. She said she'd sooner starve than beg or ask anybody to help them, and the little girl said she would too. But the boy said he wasn't going to starve for anybody, and he wasn't going to beg either; he'd steal. And sure enough he slipped out and came back with two loaves that he'd taken from a shop. They lived on that for nearly a week.\" Nellie laughed forcedly.  \"What did they do then?\" asked Ned seriously.  \"Oh! She had been doing work but couldn't get paid. She got paid.\"  \"Where was her husband?\"  \"Don't husbands die like other people?\" she answered, pointedly. \"Not that all husbands are much good when they can't get work or will always work when they can get it,\" she added.  \"Are many people as hard up as that in Sydney, Nellie?\" enquired Ned, putting down his knife and fork.  \"Some,\" she answered. \"You don't suppose a lot of the people we saw this morning get over well fed, do you? Oh, you can go on eating, Ned! it's not being sentimental that will help them. They want fair play and a chance to work, and your going hungry won't get that for them. There's lots for them and for us if they only knew enough to stop people like that getting too much.\"  By lifting her eyebrows she drew his attention to a stout coarse loudly jewelled man, wearing a tall silk hat and white waistcoat, who had stopped near them on his way to the door. He was speaking in a loud dictatorial wheezy voice. His hands were thrust into his trouser pockets, wherein he jingled coins by taking them up and letting them fall again. The chink of sovereigns seemed sweet music to him. He stared contemptuously at Ned's clothes as that young man looked round; then stared with insolent admiration at Nellie. Ned became crimson with suppressed rage, but said nothing until the man had passed them.  \"Who is that brute?\" he asked then.  \"That brute! Why, he's a famous man. He owns hundreds of houses, and has been mayor and goodness knows what. He'll be knighted and made a duke or something. He owns the"]]]
