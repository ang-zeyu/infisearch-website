He _had_ heard it among other things.  My dear Mr Robert Browning, I little thought, when I suggested to the artist your poem of the piper, that I should ever retail the story in Rommany to a tinker.  But who knows with whom he may associate in this life, or whither he may drift on the great white rolling sea of humanity? Did not Lord Lytton, unless the preface to Pelham err, himself once tarry in the tents of the Egyptians? and did not Christopher North also wander with them, and sing--     \"Oh, little did my mother think,       The day she cradled me,    The lands that I should travel in,       Or the death that I should dee;    Or gae rovin' about wi' tinkler loons,       And sic-like companie\"?  \"You know, sir,\" said the Gipsy, \"that we have two languages.  For besides the Rummany, there's the reg'lar cant, which all tinkers talk.\"  \"_Kennick_ you mean?\"  \"Yes, sir; that's the Rummany for it.  A 'dolly mort' is Kennick, but it's _juva_ or _rakli_ in Rummanis.  It's a girl, or a rom's _chi_.\"  \"You say _rom_ sometimes, and then _rum_.\"  \"There's _rums_ and _roms_, sir.  The _rum_ is a Gipsy, and a _rom_ is a husband.\"  \"That's your English way of calling it.  All the rest of the world over there is only one word among Gipsies, and that is _rom_.\"  Now, the allusion to _Kennick_ or cant by a tinker, recalls an incident which, though not strictly Gipsy in its nature, I will nevertheless narrate.  In the summer of 1870 I spent several weeks at Spa, in the Ardennes.  One day while walking I saw by the roadside a picturesque old tinker, looking neither better nor worse than the grinder made immortal by Teniers.  I was anxious to know if all of his craft in Belgium could speak Gipsy, and addressed him in that language, giving him at the same time my knife to grind.  He replied politely in French that he did not speak Rommany, and only understood French and Walloon.  Yet he seemed to understand perfectly the drift of my question, and to know what Gipsy was, and its nature, since after a pause he added, with a significant smile--  \"But to tell the truth, monsieur, though I cannot talk Rommany, I know another secret language.  I can speak _Argot_ fluently.\"  Now, I retain in my memory, from reading the Memoirs of Vidocq thirty years ago, one or two phrases of this French thieves' slang, and I at once replied that I knew a few words of it myself, adding--  \"_Tu sais jaspiner en bigorne_?\"--you can talk argot?  \"_Oui, monsieur_.\"  \"_Et tu vas roulant de vergne en vergne_?\"--and you go about from town to town?  Grave and keen, and with a queer smile, the tinker replied, very slowly--  \"Monsieur knows the Gipsies\" (here he shook his head), \"and monsieur speaks _argot_ very well.\"  (A shrug.)  \"Perhaps he knows more than he credits himself with.  Perhaps\" (and here his wink was diabolical)-- \"_perhaps monsieur knows the entire tongue_!\"  Spa is full not only of gamblers, but of numbers of well-dressed Parisian sharpers who certainly know \"the entire tongue.\"  I hastened to pay my tinker, and went my way homewards.  Ross Browne was accused in Syria of having \"burgled\" onions, and the pursuit of philology has twice subjected me to be suspected by tinkers as a flourishing member of the \"dangerous classes.\"  But to return to my rat-catcher.  As I quoted a verse of German Gipsy song, he manifested an interest in it, and put me several questions with regard to the race in other lands.  \"I wish I was a rich gentleman.  I would like to travel like you, sir, and have nothing to do but go about from land to land, looking after our Rummany people as you do, and learnin' everything Rummany.  Is it true, sir, we come from Egypt?\"  \"No.  I think not.  There are Gipsies in Egypt, but there is less Rommany in their _jib_ (language) than in any other Gipsy tribe in the world.  The Gipsies came from India.\"  \"And don't you think, sir, that we're of the children of the lost Ten Tribes?\"  \"I am quite sure that you never had a drop of blood in common with them. Tell me, do you know any Gipsy _gilis_--any songs?\"  \"Only a bit of a one, sir; most of it isn't fit to sing, but it begins--\"  And here he sang:     \"Jal 'dree the ker my honey,    And you shall be my rom.\"  And chanting this, after thanking me, he departed, gratified with his gratuity, rejoiced at his reception, and most undoubtedly benefited by the beer with which I had encouraged his palaver--a word, by the way, which is not inappropriate, since it contains in itself the very word of words, the _lav_, which means a word, and is most antiquely and excellently Gipsy.  Pehlevi is old Persian, and to _pen lavi_ is Rommany all the world over \"to speak words.\"     CHAPTER IV.  GIPSY RESPECT FOR THE DEAD.   Gipsies and Comteists identical as to \"Religion\"--Singular Manner of Mourning for the Dead, as practised by Gipsies--Illustrations from Life--Gipsy Job and the Cigars--Oaths by the Dead--Universal Gipsy Custom of never Mentioning the Names of the Dead--Burying valuable Objects with the Dead--Gipsies, Comteists, Hegelians, and Jews--The Rev. James Crabbe.  Comte, the author of the Positivist philosophy, never felt the need of a religion until he had fallen in love; and at the present day his \"faith\" appears to consist in a worship of the great and wise and good among the dead.  I have already spoken of many Gipsies reminding me, by their entirely unconscious ungodliness, of thorough Hegelians.  I may now add, that, like the Positivists, they seem to correct their irreligion through the influence of love; and by a strange custom, which is, in spirit and fact, nothing less than adoring the departed and offering to the dead a singular sacrifice.  He who has no house finds a home in family and friends, whence it results that the Gipsy, despite his ferocious quarrels in the clan, and his sharp practice even with near relations, is--all things considered--perhaps the most devoted to kith and kin of any one in the world.  His very name--rom, a husband--indicates it.  His children, as almost every writer on him, from Grellmann down to the present day, has observed, are more thoroughly indulged and spoiled than any non-gipsy can conceive; and despite all the apparent contradictions caused by the selfishness born of poverty, irritable Eastern blood, and the eccentricity of semi-civilisation, I doubt if any man, on the whole, in the world, is more attached to his own.  It was only three or four hours ago, as I write, on the fifth day of February 1872, that a Gipsy said to me, \"It is nine years since my wife died, and I would give all Anglaterra to have her again.\"  That the real religion of the Gipsies, as I have already observed, consists like that of the Comteists, in devotion to the dead, is indicated by a very extraordinary custom, which, notwithstanding the very general decay, of late years, of all their old habits, still prevails universally.  This is the refraining from some usage or indulgence in honour of the departed--a sacrifice, as it were, to their _manes_--and I believe that, by inquiring, it will be found to exist among all Gipsies in all parts of the world.  In England it is shown by observances which are maintained at great personal inconvenience, sometime for years, or during life.  Thus, there are many Gipsies who, because a deceased brother was fond of spirits, have refrained, after his departure, from tasting them, or who have given up their favourite pursuits, for the reason that they were last indulged in, in company with the lost and loved one.  As a further illustration, I will give in the original Gipsy-language, as I myself took it down rapidly, but literally, the comments of a full-blooded Gipsy on this custom--the translation being annexed.  I should state that the narrative which precedes his comments was a reply to my question, Why he invariably declined my offer of cigars?  \"No; I never toovs cigaras, kek.  I never toovs 'em kenna since my pal's chavo Job mullered.  And I'll pooker tute how it welled.\"  \"It was at the boro wellgooro where the graias prasters.  I was kairin the paiass of the koshters, and mandy dicked a rye an' pookered him for a droppi levinor.  '_Avali_,' he penned, 'I'll del you levinor and a kushto tuvalo too.'  'Parraco,' says I, 'rya.'  So he del mandy the levinor and a dozen cigaras.  I pet em adree my poachy an' jailed apre the purge and latched odoi my pal's chavo, an' he pook'd mandy, 'Where you jallin to, kako?'  And I penned: 'Job, I've lelled some covvas for tute.'

'A droppi levinor.'  So he penned, 'Pauli the grais prasters, I'll jal atut the puvius and dick tute.'  \"Eight or nine divvuses pauli, at the K'allis's Gav, his pal welled to mandy and pookered mi Job sus naflo.

No; I never smoke them now since my brother's son Job died.  And I'll tell you how it came.  \"It was at the great fair where the horses run (_i.e_., the races), I was keeping a cock-shy, and I saw a gentleman, and asked him for a drop of ale.  'Yes,' he said, 'I'll give you ale, and a good smoke too.'  'Thank you,' says I, 'Sir.'  So he gave me the ale, and a dozen cigars.  I put them in my pocket, and went on the road and found there my brother's son, and he asked me, 'Where (are) you going, uncle?'  And I said: 'Job, I have something for you.'  'Good,' says he--so I gave him the cigars.  He said: 'Where did you find them?'  'A gentleman gave them to me.'  So he put them in his pocket, and asked me, 'What'll you take to drink?'  'A drop of ale.'  So he said, 'After the horses (have) run I'll go across the field and see you.'  \"Eight or nine days after, at Hampton Court, {53} his 'pal' came to me and told me that Job was ill.  And I said, 'Anything wrong?' 'Worse nor that.'  'What _is_ the affair?'  Said he, 'I want you to go to my pal,--don't spare the horse--let her go!'  So he gave me a fine horse, and I rode eight miles so fast that I thought I'd killed her.  And I put her in the stable, and I went down into the field, and there I saw Job. 'Thank God!' said he; 'Uncle, you've come here; and if I get over this small-pox (for 'twas the smallpox he'd caught), I'll give you the best horse that you'll beat all the Gipsies.'  But he died.  \"And he says as he was dying, 'Uncle, you know the cigars you gave me?' 'Yes.'  Says he, 'I've got 'em here in my pocket.'  I and my sisters were by him, but his wife was outside in the great tent, selling things, for she never had the smallpox, nor his children, so they couldn't come to see, for we wouldn't let them.  And so he died.  \"And when he was dead, I put my hand in his pocket, and there I found the cigars.  And from that time, Sir, I never smoked a cigar.  \"Yes! there are plenty of Gipsies who do that.  And when my wife died, I never took snuff again.  Sometimes in her life she'd take a bit of snuff out (from) my box; and when I'd say, 'Dear wife, what do you do that for?' she'd tell me, 'It's good for my head.'  And so when she died I never took any (none) since.  \"Some men won't eat meat because the brother or sister that died was fond of (to) it; some won't drink ale for five or ten years; some won't eat the favourite fish that the child ate.  Some won't eat potatoes, or drink milk, or eat apples; and all for the dead.  \"Some won't play cards or the fiddle--'that's my poor boy's tune'--and some won't dance--'No, I can't dance, the last time I danced was with my poor wife (or girl) that's been dead this four years.'  \"'Come, brother, let's go and have a drop of ale; the fiddler is there.' 'No, brother, I never drank a drop of ale since my aunt went (died).' 'Well, take some tobacco, brother?'  'No, no, I have not smoked since my wife fell in the water and never came out again alive.'  'Well, let's go and play at cock-shy, we two'll play you two for a pint o' ale.'  'No, I never played at cock-shy since my father died; the last time I played was with him.'  \"And Lena, the wife of my nephew Job, never ate plums after her husband died.\"  This is a strange manner of mourning, but it is more effective than the mere wearing of black, since it is often a long-sustained and trying tribute to the dead.  Its Oriental-Indian origin is apparent enough.  But among the German Gipsies, who, I am firmly convinced, represent in language and customs their English brethren as the latter were three centuries ago, this reverence for the departed assumes an even deeper and more serious character.  Mr Richard Liebich (_Die Zigeuner_, _Leipzig_, 1863), tells us that in his country their most sacred oath is _Ap i mulende_!--by the dead!--and with it may be classed the equally patriarchal imprecation, \"By my father's hand!\"  Since writing the foregoing sentence a very remarkable confirmation of the existence of this oath among English Gipsies, and the sacredness with which it is observed, came under my own observation.  An elderly Gipsy, during the course of a family difficulty, declared to his sister that he would leave the house.  She did not believe he would until he swore by his dead wife--by his \"_mullo juvo_.\"  And when he had said this, his sister promptly remarked: \"Now you have sworn by her, I know you will do it.\"  He narrated this to me the next day, adding that he was going to put a tent up, about a mile away, and live there.  I asked him if he ever swore by his dead father, to which he said: \"Always, until my wife died.\" This poor man was almost entirely ignorant of what was in the Bible, as I found by questioning him; but I doubt whether I know any Christian on whom a Bible oath would be more binding than was to him his own by the dead.  To me there was something deeply moving in the simple earnestness and strangeness of this adjuration.  The German, like the older English Gipsies, carefully burn the clothes and bed of the deceased, and, indeed, most objects closely connected with them, and what is more extraordinary, evince their respect by carefully avoiding mentioning their names, even when they are borne by other persons or are characteristic of certain things.  So that when a Gipsy maiden named Forella once died, her entire nation, among whom the trout had always been known only by its German designation, Forelle, at once changed the name, and, to this day it is called by them _mulo madscho_--the dead fish,--or at times _lolo madscho_--the red fish.  This is also the case among the English Gipsies.  Wishing to have the exact words and views of a real Rommany on this subject, I made inquiry, and noted down his reply, which was literally as follows:--  \"Avali; when Rommany chals or juvos are mullos, their pals don't kaum to shoon their navs pauli--it kairs 'em too bongo--so they're purabend to waver navs.  Saw don't kair it--kek--but posh do, kenna.  My chavo's nav was Horfer or Horferus, but the bitti chavis penned him Wacker.  Well, yeck divvus pre the wellgooro o' the graias prasters, my juvo dicked a boro _doll_ adree some hev of a buttika and penned, 'Dovo odoi dicks just like moro Wacker!'  So we penned him _Wackerdoll_, but a'ter my juvo mullered I rakkered him Wacker again, because Wackerdoll pet mandy in cammoben o' my poor juvo.\"  In English: \"Yes.  When Gipsy men or women die, their friends don't care to hear their names again--it makes them too sad, so they are changed to other names.  All don't do it--no--but half of them do so still.  My boy's name was Horfer or Horferus (Orpheus), but the children called him Wacker.  Well, one day at the great fair of the races, my wife saw a large doll in some window of a shop, and said, 'That looks just like our Wacker!'  So we called him Wackerdoll, but after my wife died I called him Wacker again, because Wacker_doll_ put me in mind of my poor wife.\"  When further interrogated on the same subject, he said:  \"A'ter my juva mullered, if I dicked a waver rakli with lakis'nav, an' mandy was a rakkerin laki, mandy'd pen ajaw a waver geeri's nav, an rakker her by a waver nav:--dovo's to pen I'd lel some bongonav sar's Polly or Sukey.  An' it was the sar covva with my dades nav--if I dicked a mush with a nav that simmed leskers, mandy'd rakker him by a waver nav. For 'twould kair any mush wafro to shoon the navyas of the mullas a't 'were cammoben to him.\"  Or in English, \"After my wife died, if I saw another girl with her name, and I was talking to her, I'd _speak_ another woman's name, and call her by another name; that's to say, I'd take some nick-name, such as Polly or Sukey.  And it was the same thing with my father's name--if I saw a man with a name that was the same as his (literally, 'that _samed_ his'), I'd call him by another name.  For 'twould make any man grieve (lit. 'bad') to hear the names of the dead that were dear to him.\"  I suppose that there are very few persons, not of Gipsy blood, in England, to whom the information will not be new, that there are to be found everywhere among us, people who mourn for their lost friends in this strange and touching manner.  Another form of respect for the departed among Gipsies, is shown by their frequently burying some object of"]]]
