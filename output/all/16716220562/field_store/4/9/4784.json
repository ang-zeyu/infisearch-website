Sometimes after a heavy wind you find on the ground under the nest poor little broken eggs which rolled out and lost their chance of turning into birds with safe, safe wings of their own. Now such sad things as this happen because in their youth the lazy father and mother birds did not learn their lesson when Mother Magpie had her class in nest-making. The clumsiest nest of all is that which the Wood-Pigeon tries to build. Indeed, it is not a nest at all, only the beginning of one. And there is an old story about this, which I shall tell you.  In the early springtime of the world, when birds were first made, none of them--except Mother Magpie--knew how to build a nest. In that lovely garden where they lived the birds went fluttering about trying their new wings, so interested in this wonderful game of flying that they forgot all about preparing a home for the baby birds who were to come. When the time came to lay their eggs the parents knew not what to do. There was no place safe from the four-legged creatures who cannot fly, and they began to twitter helplessly: \"Oh, how I wish I had a nice warm nest for my eggs!\" \"Oh, what shall we do for a home?\" \"Dear me! I don't know anything about housekeeping.\" And the poor silly things ruffled up their feathers and looked miserable as only a little bird can look when it is unhappy.  All except Mother Magpie! She was not the best--oh, no!--but she was the cleverest and wisest of all the birds; it seemed as if she knew everything that a bird could know. Already she had found out a way, and was busily building a famous nest for herself. She was indeed a clever bird! She gathered turf and sticks, and with clay bound them firmly together in a stout elm tree. About her house she built a fence of thorns to keep away the burglar birds who had already begun mischief among their peaceful neighbors. Thus she had a snug and cosy dwelling finished before the others even suspected what she was doing. She popped into her new house and sat there comfortably, peering out through the window-slits with her sharp little eyes. And she saw the other birds hopping about and twittering helplessly.  \"What silly birds they are!\" she croaked. \"Ha, ha! What would they not give for a nest like mine!\"  But presently a sharp-eyed Sparrow spied Mother Magpie sitting in her nest.  \"Oho! Look there!\" he cried. \"Mother Magpie has found a way. Let us ask her to teach us.\"  Then all the other birds chirped eagerly, \"Yes, yes! Let us ask her to teach us!\"  So, in a great company, they came fluttering, hopping, twittering up to the elm tree where Mother Magpie nestled comfortably in her new house.  \"O wise Mother Magpie, dear Mother Magpie,\" they cried, \"teach us how to build our nests like yours, for it is growing night, and we are tired and sleepy.\"  The Magpie said she would teach them if they would be a patient, diligent, obedient class of little birds. And they all promised that they would.  She made them perch about her in a great circle, some on the lower branches of the trees, some on the bushes, and some on the ground among the grass and flowers. And where each bird perched, there it was to build its nest. Then Mother Magpie found clay and bits of twigs and moss and grass--everything a bird could need to build a nest; and there is scarcely anything you can think of which some bird would not find very useful. When these things were all piled up before her she told every bird to do just as she did. It was like a great big kindergarten of birds playing at a new building game, with Mother Magpie for the teacher.  She began to show them how to weave the bits of things together into nests, as they should be made. And some of the birds, who were attentive and careful, soon saw how it was done, and started nice homes for themselves. You have seen what wonderful swinging baskets the Oriole makes for his baby-cradle? Well, it was the Magpie who taught him how, and he was the prize pupil, to be sure. But some of the birds were not like him, nor like the patient little Wren. Some of them were lazy and stupid and envious of Mother Magpie's cosy nest, which was already finished, while theirs was yet to do.  As Mother Magpie worked, showing them how, it seemed so very simple that they were ashamed not to have discovered it for themselves. So, as she went on bit by bit, the silly things pretended that they had known all about it from the first--which was very unpleasant for their teacher.  Mother Magpie took two sticks in her beak and began like this: \"First of all, my friends, you must lay two sticks crosswise for a foundation, thus,\" and she placed them carefully on the branch before her.  \"Oh yes, oh yes!\" croaked old Daddy Crow, interrupting her rudely. \"I thought that was the way to begin.\"  Mother Magpie snapped her eyes at him and went on, \"Next you must lay a feather on a bit of moss, to start the walls.\"  \"Certainly, of course,\" screamed the Jackdaw. \"I knew that came next. That is what I told the Parrot but a moment since.\"  Mother Magpie looked at him impatiently, but she did not say anything. \"Then, my friends, you must place on your foundation moss, hair, feathers, sticks, and grass--whatever you choose for your house. You must place them like _this_.\"  \"Yes, yes,\" cried the Starling, \"sticks and grass, every one knows how to do that! Of course, of course! Tell us something new.\"  [Illustration: _\"Next you must lay a feather\"_]  Now Mother Magpie was very angry, but she kept on with her lesson in spite of these rude and silly interruptions. She turned toward the Wood-Pigeon, who was a rattle-pated young thing, and who was not having any success with the sticks which she was trying to place.  \"Here, Wood-Pigeon,\" said Mother Magpie, \"you must place those sticks through and across, criss-cross, criss-cross, _so_.\"  \"Criss-cross, criss-cross, so,\" interrupted the Wood-Pigeon. \"I know. That will do-o-o, that will do-o-o!\"  Mother Magpie hopped up and down on one leg, so angry she could hardly croak.  \"You silly Pigeon,\" she sputtered, \"not _so_. You are spoiling your nest. Place the sticks _so_!\"  \"I know, I know! That will do-o-o, that will do-o-o!\" cooed the Wood-Pigeon obstinately in her soft, foolish little voice, without paying the least attention to Mother Magpie's directions.  \"We all know that--anything more?\" chirped the chorus of birds, trying to conceal how anxious they were to know what came next, for the nests were only half finished.  But Mother Magpie was thoroughly disgusted, and refused to go on with the lesson which had been so rudely interrupted by her pupils.  \"You are all so wise, friends,\" she said, \"that surely you do not need any help from me. You say you know all about it,--then go on and finish your nests by yourselves. Much luck may you have!\" And away she flew to her own cosy nest in the elm tree, where she was soon fast asleep, forgetting all about the matter.  But oh! What a pickle the other birds were in! The lesson was but half finished, and most of them had not the slightest idea what to do next. That is why to this day many of the birds have never learned to build a perfect nest. Some do better than others, but none build like Mother Magpie.  But the Wood-Pigeon was in the worst case of them all. For she had only the foundation laid criss-cross as the Magpie had shown her. And so, if you find in the woods the most shiftless, silly kind of nest that you can imagine--just a platform of sticks laid flat across a branch, with no railing to keep the eggs from rolling out, no roof to keep the rain from soaking in--when you see that foolishness, you will know that it is the nest of little Mistress Wood-Pigeon, who was too stupid to learn the lesson which Mother Magpie was ready to teach.  And the queerest part of all is that the birds blamed the Magpie for the whole matter, and have never liked her since. But, as you may have found out for yourselves, that is often the fate of wise folk who make discoveries or who do things better than others.     THE GORGEOUS GOLDFINCH   The Goldfinch who lives in Europe is one of the gaudiest of the little feathered brothers. He is a very Joseph of birds in his coat of many colors, and folk often wonder how he came to have feathers so much more gorgeous than his kindred. But after you have read this tale you will wonder no longer.  You must know that when the Father first made all the birds they were dressed alike in plumage of sober gray. But this dull uniform pleased Him no more than it did the birds themselves, who begged that they might wear each the particular style which was most becoming, and by which they could be recognized afar.  So the Father called the birds to Him, one by one, as they stood in line, and dipping His brush in the rainbow color-box painted each appropriately in the colors which it wears to-day. (Except, indeed, that some had later adventures which altered their original hues, as you shall hear in due season.)  But the Goldfinch did not come with the other birds. That tardy little fellow was busy elsewhere on his own affairs and heeded not the Father's command to fall in line and wait his turn for being made beautiful.  So it happened that not until the painting was finished and all the birds had flown away to admire themselves in the water-mirrors of the earth, did the Goldfinch present himself at the Father's feet out of breath.  \"O Father!\" he panted, \"I am late. But I was so busy! Pray forgive me and permit me to have a pretty coat like the others.\"  \"You are late indeed,\" said the Father reproachfully, \"and all the coloring has been done. You should have come when I bade you. Do you not know that it is the prompt bird who fares best? My rainbow color-box has been generously used, and I have but little of each tint left. Yet I will paint you with the colors that I have, and if the result be ill you have only yourself to blame.\"  The Father smiled gently as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16140"],["title","The Curious Book of Birds (#2)"],["body","took up the brush which He had laid down, and dipped it in the first color which came to hand. This He used until there was no more, when He began with another shade, and so continued until the Goldfinch was completely colored from head to foot. Such a gorgeous coat! His forehead and throat were of the most brilliant crimson. His cap and sailor collar were black. His back was brown and yellow, his breast white, his wings golden set off with velvet black, and his tail was black with white-tipped feathers. Certainly there was no danger of his being mistaken for any other bird.  When the Goldfinch looked down into a pool and saw the reflection of his gorgeous coat, he burst out into a song of joy. \"I like it, oh, I like it!\" he warbled, and his song was very sweet. \"Oh, I am glad that I was late, indeed I am, dear Father!\"  But the kind Father sighed and shook His head as He put away the brush, exclaiming, \"Poor little Goldfinch! You are indeed a beautiful bird. But I fear that the gorgeous coat which you wear, and which is the best that I could give you, because you came so late, will cause you more sorrow than joy. Because of it you will be chased and captured and kept in captivity; and your life will be spent in mourning for the days when you were a plain gray bird.\"  And so it happened. For to this day the Goldfinch is persecuted by human folk who admire his wonderful plumage and his beautiful song. He is kept captive in a cage, while his less gorgeous brothers fly freely in the beautiful world out of doors.  [Illustration: _Such a gorgeous coat!_]     KING OF THE BIRDS   Once upon a time, when the world was very new and when the birds had just learned from Mother Magpie how to build their nests, some one said, \"We ought to have a king. Oh, we need a king of the birds very much!\"  For you see, already in the Garden of Birds trouble had begun. There were disputes every morning as to which was the earliest bird who was entitled to the worm. There were quarrels over the best places for nest-building and over the fattest bug or beetle; and there was no one to settle these difficulties. Moreover, the robber birds were growing too bold, and there was no one to rule and punish them. There was no doubt about it; the birds needed a king to keep them in order and peace.  So the whisper went about, \"We must have a king. Whom shall we choose for our king?\"  They decided to hold a great meeting for the election. And because the especial talent of a bird is for flying, they agreed that the bird who could fly highest up into the blue sky, straight toward the sun, should be their king, king of all the feathered tribes of the air.  Therefore, after breakfast one beautiful morning, the birds met in the garden to choose their king. All the birds were there, from the largest to the smallest, chirping, twittering, singing on every bush and tree and bit of dry grass, till the noise was almost as great as nowadays at an election of two-legged folk without feathers. They swooped down in great clouds, till the sky was black with them, and they were dotted on the grass like punctuation marks on a green page. There were so many that not even wise Mother Magpie or old Master Owl could count them, and they all talked at the same time, like ladies at an afternoon tea, which was very confusing.  Little Robin Redbreast was there, hopping about and saying pleasant things to every one, for he was a great favorite. Gorgeous Goldfinch was there, in fine feather; and little Blackbird, who was then as white as snow. There were the proud Peacock and the silly Ostrich, the awkward Penguin and the Dodo, whom no man living has ever seen. Likewise there were the Jubjub Bird and the Dinky Bird, and many other curious varieties that one never finds described in the wise Bird Books,--which is very strange, and sad, too, I think. Yes, all the birds were there for the choosing of their king, both the birds who could fly, and those who could not. (But for what were they given wings, if not to fly? How silly an Ostrich must feel!)  Now the Eagle expected to be king. He felt sure that he could fly higher than any one else. He sat apart on a tall pine tree, looking very dignified and noble, as a future king should look. And the birds glanced at one another, nodded their heads, and whispered, \"He is sure to be elected king. He can fly straight up toward the sun without winking, and his great wings are so strong, so strong! He never grows tired. He is sure to be king.\"  Thus they whispered among themselves, and the Eagle heard them, and was pleased. But the little brown Wren heard also, and he was not pleased. The absurd little bird! He wanted to be king himself, although he was one of the tiniest birds there, who could never be a protector to the others, nor stop trouble when it began. No, indeed! Fancy him stepping as a peacemaker between a robber Hawk and a bloody Falcon. It was they who would make pieces of him. But he was a conceited little creature, and saw no reason why he should not make a noble sovereign.  \"I am cleverer than the Eagle,\" he said to himself, \"though he is so much bigger. I will be king in spite of him. Ha-ha! We shall see what we shall see!\" For the Wren had a great idea in his wee little head--an idea bigger than the head itself, if you can explain how that could be. He ruffled up his feathers to make himself as huge as possible, and hopped over to the branch where the Eagle was sitting.  \"Well, Eagle,\" said the Wren pompously, \"I suppose you expect to be king, eh?\"  The Eagle stared hard at him with his great bright eyes. \"Well, if I do, what of that?\" he said. \"Who will dispute me?\"  \"I shall,\" said the Wren, bobbing his little brown head and wriggling his tail saucily.  \"You!\" said the Eagle. \"Do _you_ expect to fly higher than I?\"  \"Yes,\" chirped the Wren, \"I do. Yes, I do, do, do!\"  \"Ho!\" said the Eagle scornfully. \"I am big and strong and brave. I can fly higher than the clouds. You, poor little thing, are no bigger than a bean. You will be out of breath before we have gone twice this tree's height.\"  \"Little as I am, I can mount higher than you,\" said the Wren.  \"What will you wager, Wren?\" asked the Eagle. \"What will you give me if I win?\"  \"If you win you will be king,\" said the Wren. \"But beside that, if you win I will give you my fat little body to eat for your breakfast. But if I win, Sir, I shall be king, and you must promise never, never, never, to hurt me or any of my people.\"  \"Very well. I promise,\" said the Eagle haughtily. \"Come now, it is time for the trial, you poor little foolish creature.\"  The birds were flapping their wings and singing eagerly, \"Let us begin--begin. We want to see who is to be king. Come, birds, to the trial. Who can fly the highest? Come!\"  Then the Eagle spread his great wings and mounted leisurely into the air, straight toward the noonday sun. And after him rose a number of other birds who wanted to be king,--the wicked Hawk, the bold Albatross, and the Skylark singing his wonderful song. The long-legged Stork started also, but that was only for a joke. \"Fancy me for a king!\" he cried, and he laughed so that he had to come down again in a minute. But the Wren was nowhere to be seen. The truth was, he had hopped ever so lightly upon the Eagle's head, where he sat like a tiny crest. But the Eagle did not know he was there.  Soon the Hawk and the Albatross and even the brave little Skylark fell behind, and the Eagle began to chuckle to himself at his easy victory. \"Where are you, poor little Wren?\" he cried very loudly, for he fancied that the tiny bird must be left far, far below.  \"Here I am, here I am, away up above you, Master Eagle!\" piped the Wren in a weak little voice. And the Eagle fancied the Wren was so far up in the air that even his sharp eyes could not spy the tiny creature. \"Dear me!\" said he to himself. \"How extraordinary that he has passed me.\" So he redoubled his speed and flew on, higher, higher.  Presently he called out again in a tremendous voice, \"Well, where are you now? Where are you now, poor little Wren?\"  Once more he heard the tiny shrill voice from somewhere above piping, \"Here I am, here I am, nearer the sun than you, Master Eagle. Will you give up now?\"  Of course the Eagle would not give up yet. He flew on, higher and higher, till the garden and its flock of patient birds waiting for their king grew dim and blurry below. And at last even the mighty wings of the Eagle were weary, for he was far above the clouds. \"Surely,\" he thought, \"now the Wren is left miles behind.\" He gave a scream of triumph and cried, \"Where are you now, poor little Wren? Can you hear me at all, down below there?\"  But what was his amazement to hear the same little voice above his head shrilling, \"Here I am, here I am, Sir Eagle. Look up and see me, look!\" And there, sure enough, he was fluttering above the Eagle's head. \"And now, since I have mounted so much higher than you, will you agree that I have won?\"  \"Yes, you have won, little Wren. Let us descend together, for I am weary enough,\" cried the Eagle, much mortified; and down he swooped, on heavy, discouraged wings.  \"Yes, let us descend together,\" murmured the Wren, once more perching comfortably on the Eagle's head. And so down he rode on this convenient elevator, which was the first one invented in this world.  When the Eagle nearly reached the ground, the other birds set up a cry of greeting.  \"Hail, King Eagle!\" they sang. \"How high you flew! How near the sun! Did he not scorch your Majesty's feathers? Hail, mighty king!\" and they made a deafening chorus. But the Eagle stopped them.  \"The Wren is your king, not I,\" he said. \"He mounted higher than I did.\"  \"The Wren? Ha-ha! The _Wren_! We can't believe that The Wren flew higher than you? No, no!\" they all shouted. But just then the Eagle lighted on a tree, and from the top of his head hopped the little Wren, cocking his head and ruffling himself proudly.  \"Yes, I mounted higher "]]]
