Even now I do not recall a single statement which ever gave me the impression that the President sided with one group of belligerents.  The President's sincerity and firm desire for neutrality was emphasised in his appeal to \"My Countrymen.\"  \"The people of the United States,\" he said, \"are drawn from many nations, and chiefly from the nations now at war.  It is natural and inevitable that there should be the utmost variety of sympathy and desire among them with regard to the issues and circumstances of the conflict.  Some will wish one nation, others another, to succeed in the momentous struggle.  It will be easy to excite passion and difficult to allay it.  Those responsible for exciting it will assume a heavy responsibility, responsibility for no less a thing than that the people of the United States, whose love of their country and whose loyalty to the government should unite them as Americans all, bound in honour and affection to think first of her and her interests, may be divided in camps of hostile opinion, hot against each other, involved in the war itself in impulse and opinion, if not in action.  \"My thought is of America.  I am speaking, I feel sure, the earnest wish and purpose of every thoughtful American that this great country of ours, which is of course the first in our thoughts and in our hearts, should show herself in this time of peculiar trial a nation fit beyond others to exhibit the fine poise of undisturbed judgment, the dignity of self-control, the efficiency of dispassionate action; a nation that neither sits in judgment upon others nor is disturbed in her own counsels and which keeps herself fit and free to do what is honest and disinterested and truly serviceable for the peace of the world.\"  Many Americans believed even early in the war that the United States should have protested against the invasion of Belgium.  Others thought the government should prohibit the shipments of war supplies to the belligerents.  America _was_ divided by the great issues in Europe, but the great majority of Americans believed with the President, that the best service Uncle Sam could render would be to help bring about peace.  Until February, 1915, when the von Tirpitz submarine blockade of England was proclaimed, only American interests, not American lives, had been drawn into the war.  But when the German Admiralty announced that neutral as well as belligerent ships in British waters would be sunk without warning, there was a new and unexpected obstacle to neutrality.  The high seas were as much American as British.  The oceans were no nation's property and they could not justly be used as battlegrounds for ruthless warfare by either belligerent.  Germany, therefore, was the first to challenge American neutrality. Germany was the first to threaten American lives.  Germany, which was the first to show contempt for Wilson, forced the President, as well as the people, to alter policies and adapt American neutrality to a new and grave danger.     CHAPTER II  \"PIRATES SINK ANOTHER NEUTRAL SHIP\"  On February 4th, 1915, the _Reichsanzeiger_, the official newspaper of Germany, published an announcement declaring that from the 18th of February \"all the waters surrounding Great Britain and Ireland as well as the entire English channel are hereby declared to be a war area. All ships of the enemy mercantile marine found in these waters will be destroyed and it will not always be possible to avoid danger to the crews and passengers thereon.  \"_Neutral shipping is also in danger in the war area_, as owing to the secret order issued by the British Admiralty January 31st, 1915, regarding the misuse of neutral flags, and the chances of naval warfare, it can happen that attacks directed against enemy ships may damage neutral vessels.  \"The shipping route around the north of The Shetlands in the east of the North Sea and over a distance of thirty miles along the coast of The Netherlands will not be dangerous.\"  Although the announcement was signed by Admiral von Pohl, Chief of the Admiralty Staff, the real author of the blockade was Grand Admiral von Tirpitz.  In explanation of the announcement the Teutonic-Allied, neutral and hostile powers were sent a memorandum which contained the following paragraph:   \"The German Government announces its intention in good time so that hostile _as well as neutral_ ships can take necessary precautions accordingly.  Germany expects that the neutral powers will show the same consideration for Germany's vital interests as for those of England, and will aid in keeping their citizens and property from this area.  This is the more to be expected, as it must be to the interests of the neutral powers to see this destructive war end as soon as possible.\"   On February 12th the American Ambassador, James W. Gerard, handed Secretary of State von Jagow a note in which the United States said:   \"This Government views these possibilities with such grave concern that it feels it to be its privilege, and indeed its duty in the circumstances, to request the Imperial German Government to consider before action is taken the critical situation in respect of the relations between this country and Germany which might arise were the German naval officers, in carrying out the policy foreshadowed in the Admiralty's proclamation, to destroy any merchant vessel of the United States or cause the death of American citizens.  \"It is of course unnecessary to remind the German Government that the sole right of a belligerent in dealing with neutral vessels on the high seas is limited to visit and search, unless a blockade is proclaimed and effectively maintained, which the Government of the United States does not understand to be proposed in this case.  To declare and exercise the right to attack and destroy any vessel entering a prescribed area of the high seas without first accurately determining its belligerent nationality and the contraband character of its cargo, would be an act so unprecedented in naval warfare that this Government is reluctant to believe that the Imperial German Government in this case contemplates it as possible.\"   I sailed from New York February 13th, 1915, on the first American passenger liner to run the von Tirpitz blockade.  On February 20th we passed Queenstown and entered the Irish Sea at night.  Although it was moonlight and we could see for miles about us, every light on the ship, except the green and red port and starboard lanterns, was extinguished. As we sailed across the Irish Sea, silently and cautiously as a muskrat swims on a moonlight night, we received a wireless message that a submarine, operating off the mouth of the Mersey River, had sunk an English freighter.  The captain was asked by the British Admiralty to stop the engines and await orders.  Within an hour a patrol boat approached and escorted us until the pilot came aboard early the next morning.  No one aboard ship slept.  Few expected to reach Liverpool alive, but the next afternoon we were safe in one of the numerous snug wharves of that great port.  A few days later I arrived in London.  As I walked through Fleet street newsboys were hurrying from the press rooms carrying orange-coloured placards with the words in big black type: \"Pirates Sink Another Neutral Ship.\"  Until the middle of March I remained in London, where the wildest rumours were afloat about the dangers off the coast of England, and where every one was excited and expectant over the reports that Germany was starving.  I was urged by friends and physicians not to go to Germany because it was universally believed in Great Britain that the war would be over in a very short time.  On the 15th of March I crossed from Tilbury to Rotterdam.  At Tilbury I saw pontoon bridges across the Thames, patrol boats and submarine chasers rushing back and forth watching for U-boats, which might attempt to come up the river.  I boarded the _Batavia IV_ late at night and left Gravesend at daylight the next morning for Holland.  Every one was on deck looking for submarines and mines.  The channel that day was as smooth as a small lake, but the terrible expectation that submarines might sight the Dutch ship made every passenger feel that the submarine war was as real as it was horrible.  On the 17th of March, arriving at the little German border town of Bentheim, I met for the first time the people who were already branded as \"Huns and Barbarians\" by the British and French.  Officers and people, however, were not what they had been pictured to be.  Neither was Germany starving.  The officials and inspectors were courteous and patient and permitted me to take into Germany not only British newspapers, but placards which pictured the Germans as pirates.  Two days later, while walking down Unter den Linden, poor old women, who were already taking the places of newsboys, sold German extras with streaming headlines: \"British Ships Sunk.  Submarine War Successful.\" In front of the _Lokal Anzeiger_ building stood a large crowd reading the bulletins about the progress of the von Tirpitz blockade.  For luncheon that day I had the choice of as many foods as I had had in London.  The only thing missing was white bread, for Germany, at the beginning of the war, permitted only Kriegsbrot (war bread) to be baked.  All Berlin streets were crowded and busy.  Military automobiles, auto-trucks, big moving vans, private automobiles, taxi-cabs and carriages hurried hither and thither.  Soldiers and officers, seemingly by the thousands, were parading up and down.  Stores were busy.  Berlin appeared to be as normal as any other capital.  Even the confidence of Germany in victory impressed me so that in one of my first despatches I said:   \"Germany to-day is more confident than ever that all efforts of her enemies to crush her must prove in vain.  With a threefold offensive, in Flanders, in Galicia and in northwest Russia, being successfully prosecuted,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15770"],["title","Germany, The Next Republic? (#4)"],["body"," there was a spirit of enthusiasm displayed here in both military and civilian circles that exceeded even the stirring days immediately following the outbreak of the war.  \"Flags are flying everywhere to-day; the Imperial standards of Germany and Austria predominate, although there is a goodly showing of the Turkish Crescent.  Bands are playing as regiment after regiment passes through the city to entrain for the front.  Through Wilhelmstrasse the soldiers moved, their hats and guns decorated with fragrant flowers and with mothers, sisters and sweethearts clinging to and encouraging them.\"   A few weeks before I arrived the Germans were excited over the shipment of arms and ammunitions from the United States to the Allies, but by the time I was in Berlin the situation seemed to have changed.  On April 4th I telegraphed the following despatch which appeared in the _Evening Sun_, New York:   \"The spirit of animosity towards Americans which swept Germany a few weeks ago seems to have disappeared.  The 1,400 Americans in Berlin and those in the smaller cities of Germany have little cause to complain of discourteous treatment.  Americans just arriving in Berlin in particular comment upon the friendliness of their reception.  The Germans have been especially courteous, they declare, on learning of their nationality.  Feeling against the United States for permitting arms to be shipped to the Allies still exists, but I have not found this feeling extensive among the Germans.  Two American doctors studying in German clinics declare that the wounded soldiers always talk about 'Amerikanische keugel' (American bullets), but it is my observation that the persons most outspoken against the sale of ammunition to the Allies by American manufacturers are the American residents of Berlin.\"   Two weeks later the situation had changed considerably.  On the 24th I telegraphed: \"Despite the bitter criticism of the United States by German newspapers for refusing to end the traffic in munitions, it is semi-officially explained that this does not represent the real views of the German Government.  The censor has been instructed to permit the newspapers to express themselves frankly on this subject and on Secretary Bryan's reply to the von Bernstorff note, but it has been emphasised that their views reflect popular opinion and the editorial side of the matter and not the Government.  \"The _Lokal Anzeiger_, following up its attack of yesterday, to-day says:  \"'The answer of the United States is no surprise to Germany and naturally it fails to convince Germany that a flourishing trade in munitions of war is in accord with strict neutrality.  The German argument was based upon the practice of international law, but the American reply was based upon the commercial advantages enjoyed by the ammunition shippers.'\"  April 24th was von Tirpitz day.  It was the anniversary of the entrance of the Grand Admiral in the German Navy fifty years before, and the eighteenth anniversary of his debut in the cabinet, a record for a German Minister of Marine.  There was tremendous rejoicing throughout the country, and the Admiral, who spent his Prussian birthday at the Navy Department, was overwhelmed with congratulations.  Headed by the Kaiser, telegrams came from every official in Germany.  The press paid high tribute to his blockade, declaring that it was due to him alone that England was so terror-stricken by submarines.  I was not in Germany very long until I was impressed by the remarkable control the Government had on public opinion by censorship of the press.  People believe, without exception, everything they read in the newspapers.  And I soon discovered that the censor was so accustomed to dealing with German editors that he applied the same standards to the foreign correspondents.  A reporter could telegraph not what he observed and heard, but what the censors desired American readers to hear and know about Germany.  [Illustration: A Berlin \"Extra\"]  I was in St. Quentin, France (which the Germans on their 1917 withdrawal set on fire) at the headquarters of General von Below, when news came May 8th that the _Lusitania_ was torpedoed.  I read the bulletins as they arrived.  I heard the comments of the Germans who were waging war in an enemy country.  I listened as they spoke of the loss of American and other women and children.  I was amazed when I heard them say that a woman had no more right on the _Lusitania_ than she would have on an ammunition wagon on the Somme.  The day before I was in the first line trenches on the German front which crossed the road running from Peronne to Albert.  At that time this battlefield, which a year and a half later was destined to be the scene of the greatest slaughter in history, was as quiet and beautiful as this picturesque country of northern France was in peace times.  Only a few trenches and barbed wire entanglements marred the scene.  On May 9th I left St. Quentin for Brussels.  Here I was permitted by the General Government to send a despatch reflecting the views of the German army in France about the sinking of the _Lusitania_.  I wrote what I thought was a fair article.  I told how the bulletin was posted in front of the Hotel de Ville; how the officers and soldiers marching to and away from the front stopped, read, smiled and congratulated each other because the Navy was at last helping the Army \"win the war.\" There were no expressions of regret over the loss of life.  These officers and soldiers had seen so many dead, soldiers and civilians, men and women, in Belgium and France that neither death nor murder shocked them.  The telegram was approved by the military censor and forwarded to Berlin.  I stayed in Belgium two days longer, went to Louvain and Liége and reached Berlin May 12th.  The next day I learned at the Foreign Office that my despatch was stopped because it conflicted with the opinions which the German Government was sending officially by wireless to Washington and to the American newspapers.  I felt that this was unfair, but I was subject to the censorship and had no appeal.  I did not forget this incident because it showed a striking difference of opinion between the army, which was fighting for Germany, and the Foreign Office, which was explaining and excusing what the Army and Navy did.  The Army always justified the events in Belgium, but the Foreign Office did not.  And this was the first incident which made me feel that even in Germany, which was supposed to be united, there were differences of opinion.  In September, 1915, while the German army was moving against Russia like a surging sea, I was invited to go to the front near Vilna. During the intervening months I had observed and recorded as much as possible the growing indignation in Germany because the United States permitted the shipment of arms and ammunition to the Allies.  In June I had had an interview with Secretary of State von Jagow, in which he protested against the attitude of the United States Government and said that America was not acting as neutral as Germany did during the Spanish-American war.  He cited page 168 of Andrew D. White's book in which Ambassador White said he persuaded Germany not to permit a German ship laden with ammunition and consigned for Spain to sail.  I thought that if Germany had adopted such an attitude toward America, that in justice to Germany Washington should adopt the same position.  After von Jagow gave me the facts in possession of the Foreign Office and after he had loaned me Mr. White's book, I looked up the data.  I found to my astonishment that Mr. White reported to the State Department that a ship of ammunition sailed from Hamburg, and that he had not protested, although the Naval Attaché had requested him to do so.  The statements of von Jagow and Mr. White's in his autobiography did not agree with the facts.  Germany did send ammunition to Spain, but Wilhelmstrasse was using Mr. White's book as proof that the Krupp interests did not supply our enemy in 1898.  The latter part of September I entered Kovno, the important Russian fortress, eight days after the army captured it.  I was escorted, together with other foreign correspondents, from one fort to another and shown what the 42 cm. guns had destroyed.  I saw 400 machine guns which were captured and 1,300 pieces of heavy artillery.  The night before, at a dinner party, the officers had argued against the United States because of the shipment of supplies to Russia.  They said that if the United States had not aided Russia, that country would not have been able to resist the invaders.  I did not know the facts, but I accepted their statements.  When I was shown the machine guns, I examined them and discovered that every one of the 400 was made at Essen or Magdeburg, Germany.  Of the 1,300 pieces of artillery every cannon was made in Germany except a few English ship guns.  Kovno was fortified by _German_ artillery, not American.  A few days later I entered Vilna; this time I was moving with the advance column.  At dinner that night with General von Weber, the commander of the city, the subject of American arms and ammunition was again brought up.  The General said they had captured from the Russians an American machine gun.  He added that they were bringing it in from Smorgon to show the Americans.  When it reached us the stamp, written in English, showed that it was manufactured by Vickers Limited, England.  Being unable to read English, the officer who reported the capture thought the gun was made in the United States.  In Roumania last December I followed General von Falkenhayn's armies to the forts of Bucharest.  On Thanksgiving Day I crossed by automobile the Schurduck Pass.  The Roumanians had defended, or attempted to defend, this road by mounting armoured guns on the crest of one of the mountain ranges in the Transylvanian Alps.  I examined a whole position here and found all turrets were made in Germany.  I did"]]]
