CHAPTER I  THE TEACHER HIMSELF   It is easy enough to secure buildings and classrooms for our schools. The expenditure of so many dollars will bring us the equipment we require. Books and materials may be had almost for the asking. The great problem is to secure _teachers_--real teachers, teachers of power and devotion who are able to leave their impress on young lives. Without such teachers all the rest is but as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. And to be a real teacher is a very high achievement.  Bishop Vincent was giving a lecture on \"That Boy.\" He himself was \"that boy,\" and in the course of describing his school days he fell into meditation as follows: \"That old school master of mine!--He is dead now--_and I have forgiven him!_--And I am afraid that was the chronology of the matter; for I never was able to forgive him while he lived.\" I, as one of the listeners, smiled at the bitter wit of the speaker, but was oppressed.  This somber view of the impression sometimes left by teachers on their pupils received an antidote the following day, however, when a venerable old man approached my desk bearing in his hands an ancient and dog-eared copy of a text in grammar. He opened the book and proudly showed me written across the fly leaf \"Grover Cleveland, President.\" Then he told me this story:  \"I have been a teacher. In one of my first schools I had Grover Cleveland as a pupil. He came without a textbook in grammar, and I loaned him mine. Years passed, and Grover Cleveland was President of the United States. One day I was one of many hundreds passing in line at a public reception to grasp the President's hand. I carried this book with me, and when it came my turn to meet the President, I presented the volume and said, 'Mr. President, do you recognize this book, and do you remember me?' In an instant the light of recognition had flashed in Mr. Cleveland's eyes. Calling me by name, he grasped my hand and held it while the crowd waited and while he recalled old times and thanked me for what I had meant to him when I was his teacher. Then he took the old book and autographed it for me.\"  Three types of teachers.--Two types of teachers are remembered: one to be forgiven after years have softened the antagonisms and resentments; the other to be thought of with honor and gratitude as long as memory lasts. Between these two is a third and a larger group: those who are _forgotten_, because they failed to stamp a lasting impression on their pupils. This group represents the _mediocrity_ of the profession, not bad enough to be actively forgiven, not good enough to claim a place in gratitude and remembrance.  To which type would we belong? To which type _can_ we belong? Can we choose? What are the factors that go to determine the place we shall occupy in the scale of teachers?   THE PERSONAL FACTOR  When we revert to our own pupil days we find that the impressions which cling to our memories are not chiefly impressions of facts taught and of lessons learned, but of the _personality_ of the teacher. We may have forgotten many of the truths presented and most of the conclusions drawn, but the warmth and glow of the human touch still remains.  To be a teacher of religion requires a particularly exalted personality. The teacher and the truth taught should always leave the impression of being of the same pattern. \"For their sakes I sanctify myself,\" said the Great Teacher; shall the teachers of his Word dare do less!  The teacher as an interpreter of truth.--This is not to say that the subject matter taught is unimportant, nor that the lessons presented are immaterial. It is only to say that life responds first of all to _life_. Truth never comes to the child disembodied and detached, but always with the slant and quality of the teacher's interpretation of it. It is as if the teacher's mind and spirit were the stained glass through which the sunlight must fall; all that passes through the medium of a living personality takes its tone and quality from this contact. The pupils may or may not grasp the lessons of their books, but their teachers are living epistles, known and read by them all.  For it is the concrete that grips and molds. Our greatest interest and best attention center in persons. The world is neither formed nor reformed by abstract truths nor by general theories. Whatever ideals we would impress upon others we must first have realized in ourselves. What we _are_ often drowns out what we say. Words and maxims may be misunderstood; character seldom is. Precepts may fail to impress; personality never does. God tried through the ages to reveal his purposes to man by means of the law and the prophets, but man refused to heed or understand. It was only when God had made his thought and plan for man concrete in the person of Jesus of Nazareth that man began to understand.  The first and most difficult requirement of the teacher, therefore, is--_himself_, his personality. He must combine in himself the qualities of life and character he seeks to develop in his pupils. He must look to his personality as the source of his influence and the measure of his power. He must be the living embodiment of what he would lead his pupils to become. He must live the religion he would teach them. He must possess the vital religious experience he would have them attain.  The building of personality.--Personality is not born, it is made. A strong, inspiring personality is not a gift of the gods, nor is a weak and ineffective personality a visitation of Providence. Things do not _happen_ in the realm of the spiritual any more than in the realm of nature. Everything is _caused_. Personality grows. It takes its form in the thick of the day's work and its play. It is shaped in the crush and stress of life's problems and its duties. It gains its quality from the character of the thoughts and acts that make up the common round of experience. It bears the marks of whatever spiritual fellowship and communion we keep with the Divine.  Professor Dewey tells us that character is largely dependent on the mode of assembling its parts. A teacher may have a splendid native inheritance, a fine education, and may move in the best social circles, and yet not come to his best in personality. It requires some high and exalted task in order to assemble the powers and organize them to their full efficiency. The urge of a great work is needed to make potential ability actual. Paul did not become the giant of his latter years until he took upon himself the great task of carrying the gospel to the Gentiles.  Our own responsibility.--It follows then that the building of our personalities is largely in our own hands. True, the influence of heredity is not to be overlooked. It is easier for some to develop attractive, compelling qualities than for others. The raw material of our nature comes with us; is what heredity decrees. But the finished product bears the stamp of our training and development. Fate or destiny never takes the reins from our hands. We are free to shape ourselves largely as we will.  Our inner life will daily grow by what it feeds upon. This is the great secret of personality-building. What to-day we build into thought and action to-morrow becomes character and personality. Let us cultivate our interests, think high thoughts, and give ourselves to worthy deeds, and these have soon become a life habit. Let our hearts go out in helpfulness to those about us, and sympathy for human kind becomes a compelling motive in our lives before we are aware. Let us consciously listen to the still small voice speaking to the soul, and we will find our souls expanding to meet the Infinite.  The secret.--He who would develop his personality into the full measure of its strength and power must, then, set his goal at _living constantly in the presence of the_ BEST. This will include the best in thought and memory and anticipation. It will permit none but cheerful moods, nor allow us to dwell with bitterness upon petty wrongs and grievances. It will control the tongue, and check the unkind word or needless criticism. It will cause us to seek for the strong and beautiful qualities in our friends and associates, and not allow us to point out their faults nor magnify their failings. It will cure us of small jealousies and suppress all spirit of revenge. It will save us from idle worry and fruitless rebellion against such ills as cannot be cured. In short, it will free our lives from the crippling influence of negative moods and critical attitudes. It will teach us to _be ruled by our admirations rather than by our aversions_.  Above all, he who would build a personality fitted to serve as the teacher of the child in his religion must constantly live in the presence of _the best he can attain in God_. There is no substitute for this. No fullness of intellectual power and grasp, no richness of knowledge gleaned, and no degree of skill in instruction can take the place of a vibrant, immediate, Spirit-filled consciousness of God in the heart. For religion is _life_, and the best definition of religion we can present to the child is the example and warmth of a life inspired and vivified by contact with the Source of all spiritual being.

A character chart.--There is no possibility, of course, of making a list of all the qualities that enter into our personalities. Nor would it be possible to trace all the multiform ways in which these qualities may combine in our characters. It is worth while, however, to consider a few of the outstanding traits which take first place in determining our strength or weakness, and especially such as will respond most readily to conscious training and cultivation. Such a list follows. Each quality may serve as a goal both for our own development and for the training of our pupils.    POSITIVE QUALITIES          NEGATIVE QUALITIES  1 Open-minded, inquiring, broad          Narrow, dogmatic, not hungry for truth  2 Accurate, thorough, discerning          Indefinite, superficial, lazy  3 Judicious, balanced, fair          Prejudiced, led by likes and dislikes  4 Original, independent, resourceful          Dependent, imitative, subservient  5 Decisive, possessing convictions          Uncertain, wavering, undecided  6 Cheerful, joyous, optimistic          Gloomy, morose, pessimistic, bitter  7 Amiable, friendly, agreeable          Repellent, unsociable, disagreeable  8 Democratic, broadly sympathetic          Snobbish, self-centered, exclusive  9 Tolerant, sense of humor, generous          Opinionated, dogmatic, intolerant  10 Kind, courteous, tactful          Cruel, rude, untactful  11 Tractable, cooperative, teachable          Stubborn, not able to work with others  12 Loyal, honorable, dependable          Disloyal, uncertain dependability  13 Executive, forceful, vigorous          Uncertain, weak, not capable  14 High ideals, worthy, exalted          Low standards, base, contemptible  15 Modest, self-effacing          Egotistical, vain, autocratic  16 Courageous, daring, firm          Overcautious, weak, vacillating  17 Honest, truthful, frank, sincere          Low standards of honor and truth  18 Patient, calm, equable          Irritable, excitable, moody  19 Generous, open-hearted, forgiving          Stingy, selfish, resentful  20 Responsive, congenial          Cold, repulsive, uninviting  21 Punctual, on schedule, capable          Tardy, usually behindhand, incapable  22 Methodical, consistent, logical          Haphazard, desultory, inconsistent  23 Altruistic, given to service          Indifferent, not socially-minded  24 Refined, alive to beauty, artistic          Coarse, lacking æsthetic quality  25 Self-controlled, decision, purpose          Suggestible, easily led, uncertain  26 Good physical carriage, dignity          Lack of poise, ill posture, no grace  27 Taste in attire, cleanliness, pride          Careless in dress, frumpy, no pride  28 Face smiling, voice pleasing          Somber expression, voice unpleasant  29 Physical endurance, vigor, strength          Quickly tired, weak, sluggish  30 Spiritual responsiveness strong          Spiritually weak, inconstant, uncertain  31 Prayer life warm, satisfying          Prayer cold, formal, little comfort  32 Religious certainty, peace, quiet          Conflict, strain, uncertainty  33 Religious experience expanding          Spiritual life static or losing force  34 God a near, inspiring reality          God distant, unreal, hard of approach  35 Power to win others to religion          Influence little or negative  36 Interest in Bible and religion          Little concern for religion and Bible  37 Religion makes life fuller and richer          Religion felt as a limitation  38 Deeply believe great fundamentals          Lacking in foundations for faith  39 Increasing triumph over sin          Too frequent falling before temptation  40 Religious future hopeful          Religious growth uncertain   It is highly instructive for one to grade himself on this list of qualities; or he may have his friends and associates grade him, thus getting an estimate of the impression he is making on others. Teachers will find it well worth while to attempt to grade each of their pupils; for this will give a clearer insight into their strengths and weaknesses, and so indicate where to direct our teaching. Mark each separate set of qualities on the scale of 10 for the highest possible attainment. If the strength of the _positive_ qualities of a certain set (as in No. 10) can be marked but 6, then the negative qualities of this set must carry a mark of 4.   THE TEACHER'S BACKGROUND OF PREPARATION  One can never teach all he knows. Dr. John Dewey tells us that the subject matter of our instruction should be so well mastered that it has become second nature to us; then when we come to the recitation we can give our best powers of thought and insight to the _human element_--seeking to understand the boys and girls as we teach them.  Our knowledge and mastery must always be much broader than the material we actually present. It must be deeper and our grasp more complete than can be reached by our pupils. For only this will give us the mental perspective demanded of the teacher. Only this will enable our thought to move with certainty and assurance in the field of our instruction. And only this will win the confidence and respect of our pupils who, though their minds are yet unformed, have nevertheless a quick sense for mastery or weakness as revealed in their teacher.  A danger confronted by teachers in church schools.--Teachers in our church schools are at a disadvantage at this point. They constitute a larger body than those who teach in the day schools, yet the vast army who teach our children religion receive no salaries. They are engaged in other occupations, and freely give their services as teachers of religion with no thought of compensation or reward. The time and enthusiasm they give to the Sunday school is a free-will offering to a cause in which they believe. All this is inspiring and admirable, but it also contains an element of danger.  For it is impossible to set up scholastic and professional standards for our teachers of religion as we do for the teachers in our day schools. The day-school teacher, employed by the state and receiving public funds, must go through a certain period of training for his position. He must pass examinations in the subject matter he is to teach, and in his professional fitness for the work of the teacher. He must have a certificate granted by responsible authorities before he can enter the schoolroom. He must show professional growth while in service if he is to receive promotion or continue in the vocation.  Greater personal responsibility on church school teacher.--Naturally, all this is impossible with volunteer teachers who receive no pay for their services and are not employed under legal authority. No compulsion can be brought to bear; all must rest on the sense of duty and of opportunity of the individual teacher. Yet the Sunday school teacher needs even a more thorough background of preparation than the day-school teacher, for the work of instruction in the Sunday school is almost infinitely harder than in the day school. Religion and morals are more difficult to teach than arithmetic and geography. The church building usually lacks adequate classroom facilities. The lesson material is not as well graded and adapted to the children as the day-school texts. The lessons come but once a week, and the time for instruction is insufficient. The children do not prepare their lessons, and so come to the Sunday school lacking the mental readiness essential to receiving instruction.  This all means that the Sunday school teacher must rise to a sense of his responsibilities. He must realize that he holds a position of influence second to none in the spiritual development of his pupils. He must remember that he is dealing with a seed-time whose harvest involves the fruits of character and destiny. With these facts in mind he must ask himself whether he is justified in standing before his class as teacher without having given the time and effort necessary for complete preparation.  The teacher and his Bible.--The teacher should know his Bible. This means far more than to know its text and characters. The Bible is history, it is literature, it is a treatise on morals, it is philosophy, it is a repository of spiritual wisdom, it is a handbook of inspiration and guidance to the highest life man has in any age conceived.  To master the Bible one must have a background of knowledge of the life and history of its times. He must enter into the spirit and genius of the Hebrew nation, know their aspirations, their political and economic problems, and understand their tragedies and sufferings. He must know the historical and social setting of the Jewish people, the nations and civilizations that surrounded them, and the customs, mode of life, and trend of thought of contemporaneous peoples.  Not all of these things can be learned from the Bible itself. One must make use of the various helps and commentaries now available to Bible students. The religions of ancient Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, Greece, and Rome should be studied. Ancient literatures should be placed under tribute, and every means employed to gain a working knowledge of the social medium out of which the Christian religion developed.  The teacher's knowledge of children.--Time was when we thought of the child as a miniature man, differing from adults on the physical side only in size and strength, and on the mental side only in power and grasp of thought. Now we know better. We know that the child differs from the adult not only in the _quantity_ but also in the _quality_ of his being.  It is the business of the teacher to understand how the child _thinks_. What is the child's concept of God? What is the character of the child's prayer? How does the child _feel_ when he takes part in the acts of worship? We talk to the child about serving God; what is the child's understanding of service to God? We seek to train the child to loyalty to the church; what does the church stand "]]]
