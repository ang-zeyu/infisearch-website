It is nice to drink, To the telling of a crazy tale, While following the fragrant cloud, That a pipe throws in the air.   HOFFMANN (sitting on corner of table).    I begin.   CHORUS.    Silence.   HOFFMANN.    The name of the first was Olympia...  (The curtain falls as Hoffmann is speaking.)     ACT II.   (A physicians room, richly furnished.)   HOFFMAN (alone).  Come! Courage and confidence; I become a well of science. I must turn with the wind that blows, To deserve the one I love. I shall know how to find in myself The stuff of a learned man. She is there... if I dared.  (He softly lifts the portiere.)   'Tis she! She sleeps... how beautiful! Ah! together live... both in the same hope, The same remembrance Divide our happiness and our sorrow, And share the future. Let, let my flame Pour in thee the light, Let your soul but open To the rays of Love. Divine hearth! Sun whose ardor penetrates And comes to kiss us. Ineffable desire where one's whole being Melts in a single kiss. Let, let my flame,   etc., etc.   (Nicklausse appears.)   NICKLAUSSE.    By Jove, I felt sure you'd be here.   HOFFMAN (letting portiere fall).    Chut.   NICKLAUSSE.  Why? 'tis there that breathes The dove who's now your amorous care, The beautiful Olympia? Go, my child, admire!   HOFFMAN.    Yes, I adore her!   NICKLAUSSE.    Want to know her better.   HOFFMAN.    The soul one loves is easy to know.   NICKLAUSSE.    What? by a look... through a window?   HOFFMAN.    A look is enough to embrace the heavens.   NICKLAUSSE.    What warmth!... At least she knows that you love her.   HOFFMAN.    No.   NICKLAUSSE.    Write her.   HOFFMAN.    I don't dare.   NICKLAUSSE.    Poor lamb! Speak to her.   HOFFMAN.    The dangers are the same.   NICKLAUSSE.    Then sing, to get out of the scrape.   HOFFMAN.    Monsieur Spalanzani doesn't like music.   NICKLAUSSE (laughing).    Yes, I know, all for physics! A doll with china eyes Played cleverly with a fan, Nearby a little cock in brass; Both sang in unison In a marvelous way, Danced, gossiped, seemed to live.   HOFFMAN.    Beg your pardon. Why this song?   NICKLAUSSE.  The little cock shining and smart, With a very knowing air, Three times on himself turned; By some ingenious wheels, The doll in rolling its eyes Sighed and said: \"I love you.\"   CHORUS OF THE INVITED GUESTS.  No, no host, really, Receives more richly Through good taste his house shines; Everything here matches. No, no host really Receives more richly.   SPALANZANI.    You will be satisfied, gentlemen, in a moment.  (He makes sign to Cochenille to follow him and exits with him.)   NICKLAUSSE (to Hoffman).    At last we shall more nearly see this marvel Without equal!   HOFFMAN.    Silence... she is here!  (Enter Spalanzani conducting Olympia.)   SPALANZANI.  Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you My daughter Olympia.   THE CHORUS.      Charming. She has beautiful eyes! Her shape is very good! See how well apparelled! Nothing is wanting! She does very well!   HOFFMAN.    Ah, how adorable she is!   NICKLAUSSE.    Charming, incomparable!   SPALANZANI (to Olympia).    What a success is thine!   NICKLAUSSE (taking her all in).    Really she does very well.   THE CHORUS.  She has beautiful eyes, Her shape is very good, See how well apparelled, Nothing is really wanting; She does very well.   SPALANZANI.  Ladies and gentlemen, proud of your applause, And above all anxious To conquer more, My daughter obedient to your least caprice Will, if you please...   NICKLAUSSE (aside).    Pass to other exercises.   SPALANZANI.  Sing to a grand air, following with the voice,       Rare talent The clavichord, the guitar, Or the harp, at your choice!   COCHENILLE (at the rear).  The harp!   BASS VOICE (in the wings).  The harp!   SPALANZANI.  Very good, Cochenille! Go quickly and bring my daughter's harp!  (Cochenille exits).   HOFFMAN (aside).    I shall hear her... oh joy!   NICKLAUSSE (aside).    Oh, crazy passion!   SPALANZANI (to Olympia).    Master your emotion, my child!   OLYMPIA.    Yes.   COCHENILLE (bringing the harp).    There!   SPALANZANI (sitting beside Olympia).    Gentlemen, attention!   COCHENILLE.    Attention!   THE CHORUS.    Attention!   OLYMPIA (accompanied by Spalanzani).    The birds in the bushes. In the heavens the orb of day, All speaks to the young girl Of love, of love!   There! The pretty song,   There! The song of Olympia,   Ha!   THE CHORUS.    'Tis the song of Olympia!   OLYMPIA.  All that sings and resounds Has its sighs in turn, Moves its heart that trembles   With love.   There. The little song,   There, there,   The song of Olympia,     Ha!   CHORUS.    'Tis the song of Olympia.   HOFFMAN (to Nicklausse).    Ah, my friend, what an accent.   NICKLAUSSE.    What runs!  (Cochenille has taken the harp and all surround Olympia. A servant   speaks to Spalanzani).  Come gentlemen! your arm to the ladies. Supper awaits you!   THE CHORUS.    Supper! That's good...   SPALANZANI.  Unless you would prefer To dance first.   THE CHORUS (with energy).  No! no! the supper... good thing... After we'll dance.   SPALANZANI.    As you please...   HOFFMAN (approaching Olympia).    Might I dare...   SPALANZANI (interrupting).  She is a bit tired, Wait for the ball.  (He touches Olympia's shoulder.)   OLYMPIA.    Yes.   SPALANZANI.  You see. Until then Will you do me the favor To keep company with my Olympia?   HOFFMAN.    Oh happiness!   SPALANZANI (aside, laughing).    We'll see what kind a story he'll give her.   NICKLAUSSE (to Spalanzani).    Won't she take supper?   SPALANZANI.    No.   NICKLAUSSE (aside).    Poetic soul!  (Spalanzani goes behind Olympia. Noise of a spring is heard. Nicklausse   turns around.)    What did you say?   SPALANZANI.    Nothing, physics! ah, monsieur, physics!  (He conducts Olympia to a chair. Goes out with guests).   COCHENILLE.    The supper awaits you.   THE CHORUS.  Supper, supper, supper awaits us! No, really, no host Receives more richly!  (They go out.)   HOFFMAN.  They are at last gone. Ah, I breathe! Alone, alone, the two of us (approaching Olympia); I have so many things to say, Oh my Olympia! Let me admire you! With your charming looks let me intoxicate myself.  (He touches her shoulder).   OLYMPIA.    Yes.   HOFFMAN.  Is it not a dream born of fever? I thought I heard a sigh escape your lips!  (He again touches her shoulder).   OLYMPIA.    Yes.   HOFFMAN.  Sweet avowal, pledge of our love, You are mine, our hearts are united forever! Ah! understand you, tell me, this eternal joy Of silent hearts. Living, with but one soul and with same stroke of wing, Rush up to heaven! Let, let, my flame Show you the light of day! Let your soul open To the rays of love.  (He presses Olympia's hand. She rises and walks up and down, then   exits.)  You escape me?... What have I done.   You do not answer?... Speak! Have I wounded you? Ah!   I'll follow your steps!  (As Hoffmann is about to rush out Nicklausse appears.)   NICKLAUSSE.  Here, by Jove, moderate your zeal! Do you want us to drink without you?...   HOFFMAN (half crazy).    Nicklausse, I am beloved by her.   Loved! By all the gods.   NICKLAUSSE.  By my faith If you knew what they are saying of your beauty!   HOFFMAN.    What can they say? What?   NICKLAUSSE.    That she is dead.   HOFFMAN.    Great Heavens!   NICKLAUSSE.    Or is not of this life.   HOFFMAN (exalted).    Nicklausse! I am beloved by her!   Loved! By all the gods.   COPPÉLIUS (entering, furious).  Thief! brigand! what a tumble! Elias is bankrupt! But I shall find the opportunity To revenge myself... Robbed!... Me!   I'll kill somebody.  (Coppelius slips into Olympia's room.)  (Everybody enters.)   SPALANZANI.    Here come the waltzers.   COCHENILLE.    Here comes the round dance.   HOFFMAN.    'Tis the waltz that calls us.   SPALANZANI (to Olympia).    Take the hand of the gentleman, my child.  (Touching her shoulder.)    Come.   OLYMPIA.    Yes.  (Hoffman takes Olympia and they waltz. They disappear on left.)   CHORUS.    She dances!   In cadence.   'Tis marvelous,   Prodigious,   Room, room,   She passes   Through the air   Like lightning.   THE VOICE OF HOFFMAN (outside).    Olympia!   SPALANZANI.    Stop them!   THE CHORUS.    Who of us will do it?   NICKLAUSSE.    She will break his head.  (Hoffman and Olympia re-appear. Nicklausse rushes to stop them.)    A thousand devils!  (He is violently struck and falls in an arm chair.)   THE CHORUS.    Patatra!...   SPALANZANI (jumping in).    Halt!  (He touches Olympia on the shoulder. She stops suddenly. Hoffman,   exhausted, falls on a sofa).    There!    (To Olympia) Enough, enough, my child.   OLYMPIA.    Yes.   SPALANZANI.    No more waltzing.   OLYMPIA.    Yes.   SPALANZANI (to Cochenille).  You, Cochenille, Take her back.  (He touches Olympia.)   COCHENILLE (pushing Olympia).    Go on, Go!   OLYMPIA.    Yes.    (Going out, slowly, pushed by Cochenille.)    Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!   THE CHORUS.  What can we possibly say? 'Tis an exquisite girl, She wants in nothing, She does very well!   NICKLAUSSE (dolorous voice, pointing to Hoffman).    Is he dead?   SPALANZANI (examining Hoffman).  No! in fact His eye glass is broken. He is reviving.   THE CHORUS.    Poor young man!   COCHENILLE (outside).    Ah!  (He enters, very agitated.)   SPALANZANI.    What?   COCHENILLE.    The man with the glasses... there!   SPALANZANI.    Mercy! Olympia!...   HOFFMAN.    Olympia!...  (Sound of breaking springs with much noise).   SPALANZANI.    Ah, heaven and earth, she is broken!   HOFFMAN.    Broken!   COPPÉLIUS (entering).    Ha, ha, ha, ha, yes. Smashed!  (Hoffman rushes out. Spalanzani and Coppélius go at each other,   fighting.)   SPALANZANI.    Rascal!   COPPÉLIUS.    Robber!   SPALANZANI.    Brigand!   COPPÉLIUS.    Pagan!   SPALANZANI.    Bandit!   COPPÉLIUS.    Pirate!   HOFFMAN (pale and terror stricken).    An automaton, an automaton.  (He falls into an armchair. General laughter.)

Ha, ha, ha, the bomb has burst, He loved an automaton.   SPALANZANI (despairingly).    My automaton.   ALL.    An automaton,   Ha, ha, ha, ha!     ACT III.   (In Venice. A gallery, in festival attire, in a palace on the Grand   Canal.)  (The guests of GIULIETTA are grouped about on cushions.)   Barcarole.   GIULIETTA AND NICKLAUSSE (in the wings).  Oh soft night, oh night of love, Smile on our bliss serene, All the stars that shine above Surround the heaven's queen! Time it flies without return, Forgetting our tenderness! Far from thee I'll ever burn, In lonely strait and stress. Passioned zephyrs Waft your caresses, Passioned zephyrs Soft are your kisses. O soft night, oh night of love, Smile on our bliss serene; All the stars that shine above Surround the heaven's queen.  (Giulietta and Nicklausse enter.)   HOFFMAN.  For me, by Jove, that is not what's enchanting! At the feet of the beauty who gives us joy Does pleasure sigh? No, with laughing mouth no sorrows 'ere descanting.   BACCHIC SONG.  Friends... love tender with terror,     Error! Love in noise and wine!     Divine That a burning desire Your heart enflames In the fevers of pleasure Consume your soul! Transports of love, Last a day To the devil he who weeps For two soft eyes, To us the better bliss Of joyous cries! Let's live a day In heaven.   THE CHORUS.  To the devil whoever weeps For two soft eyes! To us the better bliss Of joyous song We'll live a day In Heaven!   HOFFMAN.  The sky lends you its brightness,     Beauty, But you hide in hearts of steel,     Hell! Bliss of paradise Where love meets, Oaths, cursed spirits,     Dreams of life!     Oh chastity,     Oh purity,       Lies!   THE CHORUS.  To the devil those who weep,     etc., etc.   SCHLEMIL (entering).    I see all is joy. Congratulations, madame.   GUILIETTA.    What! Why, I've wept for you three whole days.   PITICHINACCIO.    Good.   SCHLEMIL (to Pitichinaccio).    Microbe!   PITICHINACCIO.    Hola!   GIULIETTA.  Calm yourselves! We have a strange poet among us.  (Presenting) Hoffman!   SCHLEMIL (with bad grace).    Monsieur!   HOFFMAN.    Monsieur!   GIULIETTA (to Schlemil).    Smile on us, I beg, And come take your place At pharaoh!   THE CHORUS.    Bravo! To pharaoh!  (Giulietta after having invited all to follow her, goes toward door.   Hoffman offers his hand to Giulietta. Schlemil comes between.)   SCHLEMIL (taking Giulietta's hand).    By heavens!   GIULETTA.    To the game, gentlemen, to the game!   THE CHORUS.    To the game, the game!  (All go out except Hoffman and Nicklausse.)   NICKLAUSSE.  One word! I have two horses saddled. At the first dream That Hoffman permits himself, I carry him off.   HOFFMAN.  And what dream ever could be born By such realities? Does one love a courtezan?   NICKLAUSSE.    Yet this Schlemil...   HOFFMAN.   I am not Schlemil.   NICKLAUSSE.    Take care, the devil is clever.  DAPERTUTTO (appears at back).   HOFFMAN.  Were it so, If he makes me love her, may he damn me, Come!   NICKLAUSSE.    Let us go.  (They go out.)   DAPERTUTTO (alone).  Yes!... to fight you. The eyes of Giulietta are a sure weapon, It needed that Schlemil fail, Faith of captain and soldier, You'll do like him. I will that Giulietta shall use sorcery on you.  (Drawing from his finger a ring with a big sparkling diamond.)  Turn, turn, mirror, where the lark is caught, Sparkle diamond, fascinate, draw her...   The lark or the woman   To this conquering bait   Comes with wing or with heart; One leaves her life, the other her soul. Turn, turn, mirror where the lark is caught. Sparkle, diamond, fascinate, attract her.  (Giulietta appears and advances fascinated toward the diamond that   Dapertutto holds towards her.)    DAPERTUTTO (placing the ring on Giuliettas finger).   GIULIETTA.    What do you await from your servant?   DAPERTUTTO.  Good, you have divined At seducing hearts above all others wise, You have given me The shade of Schlemil! I vary My pleasures and I pray you To get for me to-day The reflection of Hoffman!   GIULIETTA.    What! his reflection.   DAPERTUTTO.    Yes. His reflection! You doubt The power of your eyes?   GIULIETTA.    No.   DAPERTUTTO.  Who knows. Your Hoffman dreams, perhaps better. (Severely) Yes, I was there, a while back, listening. (With irony) He defies you...   GIULIETTA.  Hoffman? 'tis well!... From this day I'll make him my plaything.  (Hoffman enters.)   DAPERTUTTO.    'Tis he!  (Dapertutto goes out. Hoffman intends to do the same.)   GIULIETTA (to Hoffman).    You leave me.   HOFFMAN (mockingly).    I have lost everything.   GIULIETTA.  What? you too... Ah, you do me wrong. Without pity, without mercy, Go!... Go!...   HOFFMAN.  Your tears betrayed you. Ah! I love you... even at the price of my life.   GIULIETTA.  Ah, unfortunate, but you do not know That an hour, a moment, may prove fatal? That my love will cost your life if you remain? That Schlemil, this night, may strike you in my arms?   Listen to my prayer;   My life is wholly yours. Everywhere I promise to accompany your steps.   HOFFMAN.  Ye gods with what bliss ye fire my heart? Like a concert divine your voice does move me; With a fire soft yet burning my being is devoured; Your glances in mine have spent their flame, Like radiant stars And I feel, my well beloved, Pass your perfumed breath On my lips and on my eyes.   GIULIETTA.  Yet, to-day, strengthen my courage By leaving me something of you!   HOFFMAN.    What do you mean?   GIULIETTA.   Listen and don't laugh at me.  (She takes Hoffman in her arms and finds a mirror.)  What I want is your faithful image, To reproduce your features, your look, your visage, The reflection that I see above me bend.   HOFFMAN.   My reflection? What folly!   GIULIETTA.    No! for it can detach itself From the polished glass And come quite whole in my heart to hide.   HOFFMAN.    In your heart?   GIULIETTA.  In my heart. 'Tis I who beg thee, Hoffman, give me my wish.   HOFFMAN.    My reflection?   GIULIETTA.  Your reflection. Yes, wisdom or folly, I await, I demand.  (Ensemble.)   HOFFMAN.  Ecstasy, unappeased bliss, Strange and soft terror, My reflection, my soul, my life To you, always to you!   GIULIETTA.  If your presence I lose, I would keep of you Your reflection, your soul, your life; Dear one, give them me.   GIULIETTA (suddenly).    Schlemil!  (Schlemil enters followed by Nicklausse, Dapertutto, Pittichinaccio and   others.)   SCHLEMIL.  I was sure of it! Together! Come, gentlemen, come, 'Tis for Hoffman, it seems to me That we are abandoned.  (Ironic laughter.)   HOFFMAN.    Monsieur!   GIULIETTA (to Hoffman).    Silence!    (Aside) I love you, he has my key.   PITICHINACCIO (to Schlemil).    Let us kill him.   SCHLEMIL.    Patience!   DAPERTUTTO (to Hoffman).    How pale you are!   HOFFMAN.    Me!   DAPERTUTTO (showing him a mirror).    See rather.   HOFFMAN (amazed).    Heavens!   GIULIETTA.  Listen, gentlemen, Here come the gondolas, The hour of barcaroles And of farewells!  (Schlemil conducts the guests out. Giulietta goes away throwing a look   at Hoffman. Dapertutto remains. Nicklausse goes toward Hoffman.)   NICKLAUSSE.    Are you coming?   HOFFMAN.    Not yet.   NICKLAUSSE.    Why? Very well. I understand, Good-by.    (Aside). But I'll watch over him.  (He goes out.)   SCHLEMIL.    What do you wait for?    HOFFMAN.    That you give me a certain key I've sworn to have.   SCHLEMIL.    You shall have this key, sir, only with my life.   HOFFMAN.    Then I shall have one and the other.   SCHLEMIL.    That remains to be seen. On guard!   DAPERTUTTO.    You have no sword (presenting his own). Take mine!   HOFFMAN.    Thank you.   CHORUS (in the wings).  Sweet night, oh night of love, Smile on our bliss serene When the stars that shine above Greet the heaven'ly Queen.  (Hoffman and Schlemil fight. Schlemil falls mortally wounded. Hoffman   bends and takes the key from around his neck. He rushes to Giulietta's   room. Giulietta appears in a gondola.)   HOFFMAN (coming back).    No one.   GIULIETTA (laughing).    Ha, ha, ha!  (Hoffmann is in a stupor looking at Giulietta.)   DAPERTUTTO (to Giulietta).    What will you do with him now?   GIULIETTA.    I'll turn him over to you.   PITICHINACCIO (entering the gondola)    Dear angel.  (Giulietta takes him in her arms.)   HOFFMAN (comprehending the infamy of Giulietta).    Vile wretch!   NICKLAUSSE.    Hoffman! Hoffman--the police!  (Nicklausse drags Hoffmann away. Giulietta and Pitichinaccia laugh.)     ACT IV.   (At Munich at CRESPEL'S. A room furnished in a bizarre fashion.)   ANTONIA (alone. She is seated at the clavichord).  She has fled, the dove She has fled far from thee!  (She stops and rises.)  Ah memory too sweet, image too cruel! Alas at my knees I hear, I see him! She has fled, the dove. She has fled far from thee; She is faithful ever, And she keeps her troth. Beloved, my voice calls thee, All my heart is thine.  (She approaches the clavichord again.)  Dear flower but now open, In pity answer me, Thou that knowest if still he loves me, If he keeps his troth. Beloved my voice implores thee. May thy heart come to me.  (She falls in a chair.)   CRESPEL (entering suddenly).  Unhappy child, beloved daughter, You promised to no longer sing.   ANTONIA.  My mother in me lived again; My heart while singing thought it heard her.   CRESPEL.  There is my torment. Thy loved mother Left thee her voice. Vain regrets! Through thee I hear her. No, no, I beg...   ANTONIA (sadly).    Your Antonia will sing no more!  (She goes out slowly.)   CRESPEL (alone).  Despair! A little while again I saw those spots of fire Mark her face. God! Must I lose her I adore? Ah, that Hoffman... 'tis he Who put in her heart this craze. I fled Far as Munich...  (Enter Frantz.)   CRESPEL.    You, Frantz, open to nobody.   FRANTZ (false exit).    You think so...   CRESPEL.    Where are you going?   FRANTZ.  I'm going to see if anybody rang. As you said...   CRESPEL.  I said, Open to nobody. (Shouting) To"]]]
