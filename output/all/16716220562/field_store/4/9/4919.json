We had spoken _of patteran_, or of crosses by the way-side, and this led naturally enough to speaking of Him who died on the Cross, and of wandering.  And I must confess that it was with great interest I learned that the Gipsies, from a very singular and Rommany point of view, respect, and even pay him, in common with the peasantry in some parts of England, a peculiar honour.  For this reason I bade the Gipsy carefully repeat his words, and wrote them down accurately.  I give them in the original, with a translation.  Let me first state that my informant was not quite clear in his mind as to whether the Boro Divvus, or Great Day, was Christmas or New Year's, nor was he by any means certain on which Christ was born.  But he knew very well that when it came, the Gipsies took great pains to burn an ash-wood fire.  \"Avali--adusta cheirus I've had to jal dui or trin mees of a Boro Divvus sig' in the sala, to lel ash-wood for the yag.  That was when I was a bitti chavo, for my dadas always would keravit.  \"An' we kairs it because foki pens our Saviour, the tikno Duvel was born apre the Boro Divvus, 'pre the puv, avree in the temm, like we Rommanis, and he was brought 'pre pash an ash yag--(_Why you can dick dovo adree the Scriptures_!).  \"The ivy and holly an' pine rukks never pookered a lav when our Saviour was gaverin' of his kokero, an' so they tools their jivaben saw (sar) the wen, and dicks selno saw the besh; but the ash, like the surrelo rukk, pukkered atut him, where he was gaverin, so they have to hatch mullo adree the wen.  And so we Rommany chals always hatchers an ash yag saw the Boro Divvuses.  For the tickno duvel was chivved a wadras 'pre the puvius like a Rommany chal, and kistered apre a myla like a Rommany, an' jalled pale the tem a mangin his moro like a Rom.  An' he was always a pauveri choro mush, like we, till he was nashered by the Gorgios.  \"An' he kistered apre a myla?  Avali.  Yeckorus he putchered the pash- grai if he might kister her, but she pookered him _kek_.  So because the pash-grai wouldn't rikker him, she was sovahalled againsus never to be a dye or lel tiknos.  So she never lelled kek, nor any cross either.  \"Then he putchered the myla to rikker him, and she penned: 'Avali!' so he pet a cross apre laki's dumo.  And to the divvus the myla has a trin bongo drum and latchers tiknos, but the pash-grai has kek.  So the mylas 'longs of the Rommanis.\"  (TRANSLATION.)--\"Yes--many a time I've had to go two or three miles of a Great Day (Christmas), early in the morning, to get ash-wood for the fire.  That was when I was a small boy, for my father always would do it.  \"And we do it because people say our Saviour, the small God, was born on the Great Day, in the field, out in the country, like we Rommanis, and he was brought up by an ash-fire.\"  Here a sudden sensation of doubt or astonishment at my ignorance seemed to occur to my informant, for he said,--  \"Why, you can see that in the Scriptures!\"  To which I answered, \"But the Gipsies have Scripture stories different from those of the Gorgios, and different ideas about religion.  Go on with your story.  Why do you burn ash-wood?\"  \"The ivy, and holly, and pine trees, never told a word where our Saviour was hiding himself, and so they keep alive all the winter, and look green all the year.  But the ash, like the oak (_lit_. strong tree), told of him (_lit_. across, against him), where he was hiding, so they have to remain dead through the winter.  And so we Gipsies always burn an ash- fire every Great Day.  For the Saviour was born in the open field like a Gipsy, and rode on an ass like one, and went round the land a begging his bread like a Rom.  And he was always a poor wretched man like us, till he was destroyed by the Gentiles.  \"And He rode on an ass?  Yes.  Once he asked the mule if he might ride her, but she told him no.  So because the mule would not carry him, she was cursed never to be a mother or have children.  So she never had any, nor any cross either.  \"Then he asked the ass to carry him, and she said 'Yes;' so he put a cross upon her back.  And to this day the ass has a cross and bears young, but the mule has none.  So the asses belong to (are peculiar to) the Gipsies.\"  There was a pause, when I remarked--  \"That is a _fino gudlo_--a fine story; and all of it about an ash tree. Can you tell me anything about the _surrelo rukk_--the strong tree--the oak?\"  \"Only what I've often heard our people say about its life.\"  \"And what is that?\"  \"Dui hundred besh a hatchin, dui hundred besh nasherin his chuckko, dui hundred besh 'pre he mullers, and then he nashers sar his ratt and he's kekoomi kushto.\" {30}  \"That is good, too.  There are a great many men who would like to live as long.\"  \"_Tacho_, true.  But an old coat can hold out better than a man.  If a man gets a hole in him he dies, but his _chukko_ (coat) can be _toofered_ and _sivved apre_ (mended and sewed up) for ever.  So, unless a man could get a new life every year, as they say the _hepputs_, the little lizards do, he needn't hope to live like an oak.\"  \"Do the lizards get a new life every year?\"  \"_Avali_.  A _hepput_ only lives one year, and then he begins life over again.\"  \"Do snails live as long as lizards?\"  \"Not when I find 'em rya--if I am hungry.  Snails are good eating. {32} You can find plenty on the hedges.  When they're going about in the fields or (are found) under wood, they are not good eating.  The best are those which are kept, or live through (literally _sleep_) the winter. Take 'em and wash 'em and throw 'em into the kettle, with water and a little salt.  The broth's good for the yellow jaundice.\"  \"So you call a snail\"--  \"A bawris,\" said the old fortune-teller.  \"Bawris!  The Hungarian Gipsies call it a _bouro_.  But in Germany the Rommanis say stargoli.  I wonder why a snail should be a stargoli.\"  \"I know,\" cried the brother, eagerly.  \"When you put a snail on the fire it cries out and squeaks just like a little child.  Stargoli means 'four cries.'\"  I had my doubts as to the accuracy of this startling derivation, but said nothing.  The same Gipsy on a subsequent occasion, being asked what he would call a _roan_ horse in Rommany, replied promptly--  \"A matchno grai\"--a fish-horse.  \"Why a matchno grai?\"  \"Because a fish has a roan (_i.e_., roe), hasn't it?  Leastways I can't come no nearer to it, if it ain't that.\"  But he did better when I was puzzling my brain, as the learned Pott and Zippel had done before me, over the possible origin of churro or tchurro, \"a ball, or anything round,\" when he suggested--  \"Rya--I should say that as a _churro_ is round, and a _curro_ or cup is round, and they both sound alike and look alike, it must be all werry much the same thing.\" {33}  \"Can you tell me anything more about snails?\" I asked, reverting to a topic which, by the way, I have observed is like that of the hedgehog, a favourite one with Gipsies.  \"Yes; you can cure warts with the big black kind that have no shells.\"  \"You mean slugs.  I never knew they were fit to cure anything.\"  \"Why, that's one of the things that everybody knows.  When you get a wart on your hands, you go on to the road or into the field till you find a slug, one of the large kind with no shell (literally, with no house upon him), and stick it on the thorn of a blackthorn in a hedge, and as the snail dies, one day after the other, for four or five days, the wart will die away.  Many a time I've told that to Gorgios, and Gorgios have done it, and the warts have gone away (literally, cleaned away) from their hands.\" {34}  Here the Gipsy began to inquire very politely if smoking were offensive to me; and as I assured him that it was not, he took out his pipe.  And knowing by experience that nothing is more conducive to sociability, be it among Chippeways or Gipsies, than that smoking which is among our Indians, literally a burnt-offering, {35} I produced a small clay pipe of the time of Charles the Second, given to me by a gentleman who has the amiable taste to collect such curiosities, and give them to his friends under the express condition that they shall be smoked, and not laid away as relics of the past.  If you move in _etching_ circles, dear readers, you will at once know to whom I refer.  The quick eye of the Gipsy at once observed my pipe.  \"That is a _crow-swagler_--a crow-pipe,\" he remarked.  \"Why a crow-pipe?\"  \"I don't know.  Some Gipsies call 'em _mullos' swaglers_, or dead men's pipes, because those who made 'em were dead long ago.  There are places in England where you can find 'em by dozens in the fields.  I never dicked (saw) one with so long a stem to it as yours.  And they're old, very old.  What is it you call it before everything\" (here he seemed puzzled for a word) \"when the world was a-making?\"  \"The Creation.\"  \"Avali--that's it, the Creation.  Well, them crow-swaglers was kaired at the same time; they're hundreds--avali--thousands of beshes (years) old. And sometimes we call the beng (devil) a swagler, or we calls a swagler the beng.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Because the devil lives in smoke.\"     CHAPTER III.  THE GIPSY TINKER.   Difficulty of coming to an Understanding with Gipsies.--The Cabman.--Rommany for French.--\"Wanderlust.\"--Gipsy Politeness.--The Tinker and the Painting.--Secrets of Bat-catching.--The Piper of Hamelin, and the Tinker's Opinion of the Story.--The Walloon Tinker of Spa.--Argot.  One summer day in London, in 1871, I was seated alone in an artist's studio.  Suddenly I heard without, beneath the window, the murmur of two voices, and the sleepy, hissing, grating sound of a scissors-grinder's wheel.  By me lay a few tools, one of which, a chisel, was broken.  I took it, went softly to the window, and looked down.  There was the wheel, including all the apparatus of a travelling tinker. I looked to see if I could discover in the two men who stood by it any trace of the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16358"],["title","The English Gipsies and Their Language (#6)"],["body","Rommany.  One, a fat, short, mind-his-own-business, ragged son of the roads, who looked, however, as if a sturdy drinker might be hidden in his shell, was evidently not my \"affair.\"  He seemed to be the \"Co.\" of the firm.  But by him, and officiating at the wheeling smithy, stood a taller figure--the face to me invisible--which I scrutinised more nearly.  And the instant I observed his _hat_ I said to myself, \"This looks like it.\"  For dilapidated, worn, wretched as that hat was, there was in it an attempt, though indescribably humble, to be something melo-dramatic, foreign, Bohemian, and poetic.  It was the mere blind, dull, dead germ of an effort--not even _life_--only the ciliary movement of an antecedent embryo--and yet it _had_ got beyond Anglo-Saxondom.  No costermonger, or common cad, or true Englishman, ever yet had that indefinable touch of the opera-supernumerary in the streets.  It _was_ a sombrero.  \"That's the man for me,\" I said.  So I called him, and gave him the chisel, and after a while went down.  He was grinding away, and touched his hat respectfully as I approached.  Now the reader is possibly aware that of all difficult tasks one of the most difficult is to induce a disguised Gipsy, or even a professed one, to utter a word of Rommany to a man not of the blood.  Of this all writers on the subject have much to say.  For it is so black-swanish, I may say so centenarian in unfrequency, for a gentleman to speak Gipsy, that the Zingaro thus addressed is at once subjected to morbid astonishment and nervous fears, which under his calm countenance and infinite \"cheek\" are indeed concealed, but which speedily reduce themselves to two categories.  1.  That Rommany is the language of men at war with the law; therefore you are either a detective who has acquired it for no healthy purpose, or else you yourself are a scamp so high up in the profession that it behooves all the little fish of outlawdom to beware of you.  2.  Or else--what is quite as much to be dreaded--you are indeed a gentleman, but one seeking to make fun of him, and possibly able to do so.  At any rate, your knowledge of Rommany is a most alarming coin of vantage.  Certainly, reader, you know that a regular London streeter, say a cabman, would rather go to jail than be beaten in a chaffing match.  I nearly drove a hansom into sheer convulsions one night, about the time this chapter happened, by a very light puzzler indeed.  I had hesitated between him and another.  \"You don't know _your own mind_,\" said the disappointed candidate to me.  \"_Mind your own_ business,\" I replied.  It was a poor palindrome, {38} reader--hardly worth telling--yet it settled him.  But he swore--oh, of course he did--he swore beautifully.  Therefore, being moved to caution, I approached calmly and gazed earnestly on the revolving wheel.  \"Do you know,\" I said, \"I think a great deal of your business, and take a great interest in it.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I can tell you all the names of your tools in French.  You'd like to hear them, wouldn't you?\"  \"Wery much indeed, sir.\"  So I took up the chisel.  \"This,\" I said, \"is a _churi_, sometimes called a _chinomescro_.\"  \"That's the French for it, is it, sir?\" replied the tinker, gravely.  Not a muscle of his face moved.  \"The _coals_,\" I added, \"are _hangars_ or _wongurs_, sometimes called _kaulos_.\"  \"Never heerd the words before in my life,\" quoth the sedate tinker.  \"The bellows is a _pudemengro_.  Some call it a _pishota_.\"  \"Wery fine language, sir, is French,\" rejoined the tinker.  In every instance he repeated the words after me, and pronounced them correctly, which I had not invariably done.  \"Wery fine language.  But it's quite new to me.\"  \"You wouldn't think now,\" I said, affably, \"that _I_ had ever been on the roads!\"  The tinker looked at me from my hat to my boots, and solemnly replied--  \"I should say it was wery likely.  From your language, sir, wery likely indeed.\"  I gazed as gravely back as if I had not been at that instant the worst sold man in London, and asked--  \"Can you _rakher Rommanis_?\" (_i.e_., speak Gipsy.)  And _he_ said he _could_.  Then we conversed.  He spoke English intermingled with Gipsy, stopping from time to time to explain to his assistant, or to teach him a word. This portly person appeared to be about as well up in the English Gipsy as myself--that is, he knew it quite as imperfectly.  I learned that the master had been in America, and made New York and Brooklyn glad by his presence, while Philadelphia, my native city had been benefited as to its scissors and morals by him.  \"And as I suppose you made money there, why didn't you remain?\" I inquired.  The Gipsy--for he was really a Gipsy, and not a half-scrag--looked at me wistfully, and apparently a little surprised that I should ask him such a question.  \"Why, sir, _you_ know that _we_ can't keep still.  Somethin' kept telling me to move on, and keep a movin'.  Some day I'll go back again.\"  Suddenly--I suppose because a doubt of my perfect Freemasonry had been aroused by my absurd question--he said, holding up a kettle--  \"What do you call this here in Rommanis?\"  \"I call it a _kekavi_ or a _kavi_,\" I said.  \"But it isn't _right_ Rommany.  It's Greek, which the Rommanichals picked up on their way here.\"  And here I would remark, by the way, that I have seldom spoken to a Gipsy in England who did not try me on the word for kettle.  \"And what do you call a face?\" he added.  \"I call a face a _mui_,\" I said, \"and a nose a _nak_; and as for _mui_, I call _rikker tiro mui_, 'hold your jaw.'  That is German Rommany.\"  The tinker gazed at me admiringly, and then said, \"You're 'deep' Gipsy, I see, sir--that's what _you_ are.\"  \"_Mo rov a jaw_; _mo rakker so drovan_?\" I answered.  \"Don't talk so loud; do you think I want all the Gorgios around here to know I talk Gipsy?  Come in; _jal adree the ker and pi a curro levinor_.\"  The tinker entered.  As with most Gipsies there was really, despite the want of \"education,\" a real politeness--a singular intuitive refinement pervading all his actions, which indicated, through many centuries of brutalisation, that fountain-source of all politeness--the Oriental.  Many a time I have found among Gipsies whose life, and food, and dress, and abject ignorance, and dreadful poverty were far below that of most paupers and prisoners, a delicacy in speaking to and acting before ladies, and a tact in little things, utterly foreign to the great majority of poor Anglo-Saxons, and not by any means too common in even higher classes.  For example, there was a basket of cakes on the table, which cakes were made like soldiers in platoons.  Now Mr Katzimengro, or Scissorman, as I call him, not being familiar with the anatomy of such delicate and winsome maro, or bread, was startled to find, when he picked up one biscuit de Rheims, that he had taken a row.  Instantly he darted at me an astonished and piteous glance, which said--  \"I cannot, with my black tinker fingers, break off and put the cakes back again; I do not want to take all--it looks greedy.\"  So I said, \"Put them in your pocket.\"  And he did so, quietly.  I have never seen anything done with a better grace.  On the easel hung an unfinished picture, representing the Piper of Hamelin surrounded by rats without number.  The Gipsy appeared to be much interested in it.  \"I used to be a rat-catcher myself,\" he said.  \"I learned the business under old Lee, who was the greatest rat-catcher in England.  I suppose you know, of course, sir, how to _draw_ rats?\"  \"Certainly,\" I replied.  \"Oil of rhodium.  I have known a house to be entirely cleared by it.  There were just thirty-six rats in the house, and they had a trap which held exactly twelve.  For three nights they caught a dozen, and that finished the congregation.\"  \"Aniseed is better,\" replied the Gipsy, solemnly.  (By the way, another and an older Gipsy afterwards told me that he used caraway-oil and the heads of dried herrings.)  \"And if you've got a rat, sir, anywhere in this here house, I'll bring it to you in five minutes.\"  He did, in fact, subsequently bring the artist as models for the picture two very pretty rats, which he had quite tamed while catching them.  \"But what does the picture mean, sir?\" he inquired, with curiosity.  \"Once upon a time,\" I replied, \"there was a city in Germany which was overrun with rats.  They teased the dogs and worried the cats, and bit the babies in the cradle, and licked the soup from the cook's own ladle.\"  \"There must have been an uncommon lot of them, sir,\" replied the tinker, gravely.  \"There was.  Millions of them.  Now in those days there were no Rommanichals, and consequently no rat-catchers.\"  \"'Taint so now-a-days,\" replied the Gipsy, gloomily.  \"The business is quite spiled, and not to get a livin' by.\"  \"Avo.  And by the time the people had almost gone crazy, one day there came a man--a Gipsy--the first Gipsy who had ever been seen in _dovo tem_ (or that country).  And he agreed for a thousand crowns to clear all the rats away.  So he blew on a pipe, and the rats all followed him out of town.\"  \"What did he blow on a pipe for?\"  \"Just for _hokkerben_, to humbug them.  I suppose he had oils rubbed on his heels.  But when he had drawn the rats away and asked for his money, they would not give it to him.  So then, what do you think he did?\"  \"I suppose--ah, I see,\" said the Gipsy, with a shrewd look.  \"He went and drew 'em all back again.\"  \"No; he went, and this time piped all the children away.  They all went after him--all except one little lame boy--and that was the last of it.\"  The Gipsy looked earnestly at me, and then, as if I puzzled, but with an expression of perfect faith, he asked--  \"And is that all _tacho_--all a fact--or is it made up, you know?\"  \"Well, I think it is partly one and partly the other.  You see, that in those days Gipsies were very scarce, and people were very much astonished at rat-drawing, and so they made a queer story of it.\"  "]]]
