We consented; turned to the right; and, gradually rising, gained a considerable eminence. Again we turned to the right, walking upon a raised promenade; while the blossoms of the pear and apple trees, within a hundred walled gardens, perfumed the air with a delicious fragrance. As we continued our route along the _Boulevard Beauvoisine_, we gained one of the most interesting and commanding views imaginable of the city of Rouen--just at that moment lighted up by the golden rays of a glorious sun-set--which gave a breadth and a mellower tone to the shadows upon the Cathedral and the Abbey of St. Ouen. The situation of Rouen renders it necessarily picturesque, view it from what spot you will.  The population of Rouen is supposed to be full one hundred thousand souls. In truth, there is no end to the succession of human beings. They swarm like bees, and like bees are busy in bringing home the produce of their industry. You have all the bustle and agitation of Cheapside and Cornhill; only that the ever-moving scene is carried on within limits one-half as broad. Conceive Bucklersbury, Cannon-street, and Thames-street,--and yet you cannot conceive the narrow streets of Rouen: filled with the flaunting cauchoise, and echoing to the eternal tramp of the sabot. There they are; men, women, and children--all abroad in the very centre of the streets: alternately encountering the splashing of the gutter, and the jostling of their townsmen--while the swift cabriolet, or the slow-paced cart, or the thundering _Diligence_, severs them, and scatters them abroad, only that they may seem to be yet more condensely united. For myself, it is with difficulty I believe that I am not living in the times of our Henry VIII. and of their Francis I.; and am half disposed to inquire after the residence of _Guillaume Tailleur_ the printer--the associate, or foreign agent of your favourite _Pynson_.[35]   [34] [Mons. Licquet here observes, \"This is the first time I have heard it     said that our Postilions put on rouge.\" What he adds, shall be given     in his own pithy expression.--\"Où la coquetterie va-t-elle se nicher?\"     What, however is above stated, was stated from a _conviction_ of     its being TRUE]  [35] [The third English Printer.] See the _Bibliographical Decameron_,     vol. ii. p. 137, 8.     LETTER V.  ECCLESIASTICAL ARCHITECTURE. CATHEDRAL. MONUMENTS. RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES. THE ABBEY OF ST. OUEN. THE CHURCHES OF ST. MACLOU, ST. VINCENT, ST. VIVIEN, ST. GERVAIS, AND ST. PAUL.   I have now made myself pretty well acquainted with the geography of Rouen. How shall I convey to you a summary, and yet a satisfactory, description of it? It cannot be done. You love old churches, old books, and relics of ancient art. These be my themes, therefore: so fancy yourself either strolling leisurely with me, arm in arm, in the streets--or sitting at my elbow. First for THE CATHEDRAL:--for what traveller of taste does not doff his bonnet to the _Mother Church_ of the town through which he happens to be travelling--or in which he takes up a temporary abode? The west-front,[36] always the _forte_ of the architect's skill, strikes you as you go down, or come up, the principal street--_La Rue des Carmes_,--which seems to bisect the town into equal parts. A small open space, (which however has been miserably encroached upon by petty shops) called the _Flower-garden_, is before this western front; so that it has some little breathing room in which to expand its beauties to the wondering eyes of the beholder. In my poor judgment, this western front has very few elevations comparable with it[37]--including even those of _Lincoln_ and _York_. The ornaments, especially upon the three porches, between the two towers, are numerous, rich, and for the greater part entire:--in spite of the Calvinists,[38] the French revolution, and time. Among the lower and smaller basso-relievos upon these porches, is the subject of the daughter of Herodias dancing before Herod. She is manoeuvering on her hands, her feet being upwards. To the right, the decapitation of St. John is taking place.  The southern transept makes amends for the defects of the northern. The space before it is devoted to a sort of vegetable market: curious old houses encircle this space: and the ascent to the door, but more especially the curiously sculptured porch itself, with the open spaces in the upper part--light, fanciful and striking to a degree--produce an effect as pleasing as it is extraordinary. Add to this, the ever-restless feet of devotees, going in and coming out--the worn pavement, and the frittered ornaments, in consequence--seem to convince you that the ardour and activity of devotion is almost equal to that of business.[39]  As you enter the cathedral, at the centre door, by descending two steps, you are struck with the length and loftiness of the nave, and with the lightness of the gallery which runs along the upper part of it. Perhaps the nave is too narrow for its length. The lantern of the central large tower is beautifully light and striking. It is supported by four massive clustered pillars, about forty feet in circumference;[40] but on casting your eye downwards, you are shocked at the tasteless division of the choir from the nave by what is called a _Grecian screen_: and the interior of the transepts has undergone a like preposterous restoration. The rose windows of the transepts, and that at the west end of the nave, merit your attention and commendation. I could not avoid noticing, to the right, upon entrance, perhaps the oldest side chapel in the cathedral: of a date, little less ancient than that of the northern tower; and perhaps of the end of the twelfth century. It contains by much the finest specimens of stained glass--of the early part of the XVIth century. There is also some beautiful stained glass on each side of the Chapel of the Virgin,[41] behind the choir; but although very ancient, it is the less interesting, as not being composed of groups, or of historical subjects. Yet, in this, as in almost all the churches which I have seen, frightful devastations have been made among the stained-glass windows by the fury of the Revolutionists.[42]  Respecting the MONUMENTS, you ought to know that the famous ROLLO lies in one of the side-chapels, farther down to the right, upon entering; although his monument cannot be older than the thirteenth century. My attachment to the bibliomanical celebrity of JOHN, DUKE OF BEDFORD, will naturally lead me to the notice of his interment and monumental inscription. The latter is thus;      _Ad dextrum Altaris Latus_      _Jacet_      IOANNES DUX BETFORDI      _Normanniæ pro Rex_      _Obiit Anno_      MCCCCXXXV.  The Duke's tomb will be seen engraved in Sandford's Genealogical History,[43] p. 314; which plate, in fact, is the identical one used by Ducarel; who had the singularly good fortune to decorate his Anglo-Norman Antiquities without any expense to himself![44]  There is a curious chapter in Pommeraye's _Histoire de l'Eglise Cathedrale de Rouen_, p. 203, respecting the Duke's taking the habit of a canon of the cathedral. He attended, with his first wife, ANNE OF BURGUNDY, and threw himself upon the liberality and kindness of the monks, to be received by them as one of their order: \"il les prioit d'être receu parmy eux comme un de leurs frères, et d'avoir tous les jours distribution de pain et de vin, et pour marque de fraternité d'être vétu du surplis et de l'aumusse: comme aussi d'être associé, luy et sa très généreuse et très illustre épouse, aux suffrages de leur compagnie, et à la participation de tous les biens qu'il plaira à Dieu leur donner la grace d'opérer,\" p. 204. A grand procession marked the day of the Duke's admission into the monkish fraternity. The whole of this, with an account of the Duke's superb presents to the sacristy, his dining with his Duchess, and receiving their portion of \"eight loaves and four gallons of wine,\" are distinctly narrated by the minute Pommeraye.  As you approach the _Chapel of the Virgin_, you pass by an ancient monument, to the left, of a recumbent Bishop, reposing behind a thin pillar, within a pretty ornamented Gothic arch.[45] To the eye of a tasteful antiquary this cannot fail to have its due attraction. While however we are treading upon hallowed ground, rendered if possible more sacred by the ashes of the illustrious dead, let us move gently onwards towards the _Chapel of the Virgin_, behind the choir. See, what bold and brilliant monumental figures are yonder, to the right of the altar! How gracefully they kneel and how devoutly they pray! They are the figures of the CARDINALS D'AMBOISE--uncle and nephew:--the former, minister of Louis XII.[46] and (what does not necessarily follow, but what gives him as high a claim upon the gratitude of posterity) the restorer and beautifier of the glorious building in which you are contemplating his figure. This splendid monument is entirely of black and white marble, of the early part of the sixteenth century. The figures just mentioned are of white marble, kneeling upon cushions, beneath a rich canopy of Gothic fretwork. They are in their professional robes; their heads are bare, exhibiting the tonsure, with the hair in one large curl behind. A small whole-length figure of _St. George_, their tutelary saint, is below them, in gilded marble: and the whole base, or lower frieze, of the monument, is surrounded by six delicately sculptured females, about three feet high, emblematic of the virtues for which these cardinals were so eminently distinguished. These figures, representing Faith, Charity, Prudence, Force, Justice, and Temperance, are flanked by eight smaller ones, placed in carved niches; while, above them, are the twelve Apostles, not less beautifully executed.[47]  On gazing at this splendid monument of ancient piety and liberality--and with one's mind deeply intent upon the characters of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16227"],["title","The Uses of Astronomy (#0)"],["body","USES OF ASTRONOMY.                                  AN ORATION                Delivered at Albany, on the 28th of August, 1856                                     BY                               EDWARD EVERETT,                                    ON THE                 OCCASION OF THE INAUGURATION OF THE DUDLEY                         ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORY,                                    WITH A                     CONDENSED REPORT OF THE PROCEEDINGS,                            AND AN ACCOUNT OF THE                DEDICATION OF NEW YORK STATE GEOLOGICAL HALL.                                  NEW YORK:                       PUBLISHED BY ROSS & TOUSEY,                            103 NASSAU STREET.                                  1856.                               A NOTE EXPLANATORY.       The undersigned ventures to put forth this report of Mr.      EVERETT'S Oration, in connection with a condensed account of the      Inauguration of the Dudley Observatory, and the Dedication of      the New State Geological Hall, at Albany,--in the hope that the      demand which has exhausted the newspaper editions, may exhaust      this as speedily as possible; not that he is particularly      tenacious of a reward for his own slight labors, but because he      believes that the extensive circulation of the record of the two      events so interesting and important to the cause of Science will      exercise a beneficial influence upon the public mind. The effort      of the distinguished Statesman who has invested Astronomy with      new beauties, is the latest and one of the most brilliant of      his compositions, and is already wholly out of print, though      scarcely a month has elapsed since the date of its delivery.      The account of the proceedings at Albany during the Ceremonies      of Inauguration is necessarily brief, but accurate, and is      respectfully submitted to the consideration of the reader.                                                      A. MAVERICK.      NEW YORK, _October 1, 1856._                         TWO NEW INSTITUTIONS OF SCIENCE;                                    AND                THE SCENES WHICH ATTENDED THEIR CHRISTENING.   In the month of August last, two events took place in the city of Albany, which have more than an ephemeral interest. They occurred in close connection with the proceedings of a Scientific Convention, and the memory of them deserves to be cherished as a recollection of the easy way in which Science may be popularized and be rendered so generally acceptable that the people will cry, like Oliver Twist, for more. It is the purpose of this small publication to embody, in a form more durable than that of the daily newspaper, the record of proceedings which have so near a relation to the progress of scientific research. A marked feature in the ceremonies was the magnificent Oration of the Hon. EDWARD EVERETT, inaugurating the Dudley Observatory of Albany; and it is believed that the reissue of that speech in its present form will be acceptable to the admirers of that distinguished gentleman, not less than to the lovers of Science, who hung with delight upon his words.                    THE DEDICATION OF THE GEOLOGICAL HALL.  On Wednesday, August 27, 1856, the State Geological Hall of New York was dedicated with appropriate ceremonies. For the purpose of affording accommodation to the immense crowds of people who, it was confidently anticipated, would throng to this demonstration and that of the succeeding day, at which Mr. EVERETT spoke, a capacious Tent was arranged with care in the center of Academy Park, on Capitol Hill; and under its shelter the ceremonies of the inauguration of both institutions were conducted without accident or confusion; attended on the first day by fully three thousand persons, and on the second by a number which may be safely computed at from five to seven thousand.  The announcement that Hon. WM. H. SEWARD would be present at the dedication of the Geological Hall, excited great interest among the citizens; but the hope of his appearance proved fallacious. His place was occupied by seven picked men of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, one of whom (Prof. HENRY) declared his inability to compute the problem why seven men of science were to be considered equal to one statesman. The result justified the selections of the committee, and although the Senator was not present, the seven Commoners of Science made the occasion a most notable one by the flow of wit, elegance of phrase, solidity and cogency of argument, and rare discernment of natural truths, with which their discourse was garnished.  The members of the American Association marched in procession to the Tent, from their place of meeting in the State Capitol. On the stage were assembled many distinguished gentlemen, and in the audience were hundreds of ladies. GOV. CLARK and Ex-Governors HUNT and SEYMOUR, of New York, Sir WM. LOGAN, of Canada, Hon. GEORGE BANCROFT, and others as well known as these, were among the number present. The tent was profusely decorated. Small banners in tri-color were distributed over the entire area covered by the stage, and adorned the wings. The following inscriptions were placed over the front of the rostrum,--that in honor of \"_The Press_\" occupying a central position:                  GEOLOGY.                  THE PRESS.                 METEOROLOGY.              MINERALOGY.                 METALLURGY.               ETHNOLOGY.                               ASTRONOMY.  The following were arranged in various positions on the right and left:                  CHEMISTRY.                TELEGRAPH.                 PHYSIOLOGY.               LETTERS.                 CONCHOLOGY.               HYDROLOGY.                 PALÆONTOLOGY.             ZOOLOGY.                 MICROSCOPY.               ICHTHYOLOGY.                 ART.                      MANUFACTURES.                 STEAM.                    AGRICULTURE.                 COMMERCE.                 PHYSICS.                 SCIENCE.                  ANATOMY.                 NAVIGATION.               BOTANY.  The proceedings of the day were opened with prayer by Rev. GEO. W. BETHUNE, D.D., of Brooklyn.  Hon. GARRIT Y. LANSING, of Albany, then introduced Professor LOUIS AGASSIZ, of Cambridge, Mass., who was the first of the \"seven men of science\" to entertain his audience, always with the aid of the inevitable black-board, without which the excellent Professor would be as much at a loss as a chemist without a laboratory. Professor AGASSIZ spoke for an hour, giving his views of a new theory of animal development. He began by saying:--       We are here to inaugurate the Geological Hall, which has grown      out of the geological survey of the State. To make the occasion      memorable, a distinguished statesman of your own State, and Mr.      FRANK C. GRAY, were expected to be present and address you. The      pressure of public duties has detained Mr. SEWARD, and severe      sickness has detained Mr. GRAY. I deeply lament that the occasion      is lost to you to hear my friend Mr. GRAY, who is a devotee to      science, and as warm-hearted a friend as ever I knew. Night      before last I was requested to assist in taking their place--I,      who am the most unfit of men for the post. I never made a speech.      I have addressed learned bodies, but I lack that liberty of      speech--the ability to present in finished style, and with that      rich imagery which characterize the words of the orator, the      thoughts fitting to such an occasion as this. He would limit      himself, he continued, to presenting some motives why the      community should patronize science, and foster such institutions      as this. We scientific men regard this as an occasion of the      highest interest, and thus do not hesitate to give the sanction      of the highest learned body of the country as an indorsement of      the liberality of this State. The geological survey of New York      has given to the world a new nomenclature. No geologist can,      hereafter, describe the several strata of the earth without      referring to it. Its results, as recorded in your published      volumes, are treasured in the most valuable libraries of the      world. They have made this city famous; and now, when the      scientific geologist lands on your shore, his first question is,      \"Which is the way to Albany? I want to see your fossils.\" But      Paleontology is only one branch of the subject, and many others      your survey has equally fostered.       He next proceeded to show that organized beings were organized      with reference to a plan, which the relations between different      animals, and between different plants, and between animals and      plants, everywhere exhibit;--drew sections of the body of a      fish, and of the bird, and of man, and pointed out that in each      there was the same central back-bone, the cavity above and      the ribbed cavity below the flesh on each side, and the skin      over all--showing that the maker of each possessed the same      thought--followed the same plan of structure. And upon that plan      He had made all the kinds of quadrupeds, 2,000 in number, all the      kinds of birds, 7,000 in number, all of the reptiles, 2,000 to      3,000 in number, all the fish, 10,000 to 12,000 in number. All      their forms may be derived as different expressions of the same      formula. There are only four of these great types; or, said he,      may I not call them the four tunes on which Divinity has played      the harmonies that have peopled, in living and beautiful reality,      the whole world?                    PROFESSOR HITCHCOCK ON REMINISCENCES.  ERASTUS C. BENEDICT, Esq. of New York, introduced Prof. HITCHCOCK, of Amherst, as a gentleman whose name was very familiar, who had laid aside, voluntarily, the charge of one of the largest colleges in New "]]]
