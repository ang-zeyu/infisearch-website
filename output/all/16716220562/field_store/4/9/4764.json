And there, lying on a bit of very stony ground, half on the stones and half on the grass, was a dead robin-redbreast. I love robins very much, and it was not because I wanted one to die, but because I thought that if one did die, I should so like to bury him, that I had wished to find a dead robin ever since I became a Brother of Pity. It was rather late, but it wanted nearly an hour to my usual bedtime, so I thought I would go home at once for my dress and spade and bier, and for some roses. For I had resolved to bury this (my first robin-redbreast) in a grave lined with rose-leaves, and to give him a wreath of forget-me-nots.  Just as I was going I heard a loud buzz above my head, and something hit me in the face. It was a beetle, whirring about in the air, and as I turned to leave poor Robin the beetle sat down on him, on the middle of his red breast, and by still hearing the buzzing, I found that another beetle was whirling and whirring just above my head in the air. I like beetles (especially the flying watchmen), and these ones were black too; so I said, for fun, \"You've got on your black things, and if you'll take care of the body till I get my spade you shall be Brothers of Pity.\"  I ran home, and I need not have gone indoors at all, for I keep my cloak and my spade and the bier in the summer-house, but the bits of wood were in the nursery cupboard, so, after I had got some good roses, and was quite ready, I ran up-stairs, and there, to my great vexation, Nurse met me, and said I was to go to bed.  I thought it was very hard, because it had been a very hot day, and I had had to go a walk in the heat of the sun along the old coaching-road with Nurse, and it seemed so provoking, now it was cool and the moon was rising, that I should have to go to bed, especially as Nurse was sending me there earlier than usual because she wanted to go out herself, and I knew it.  I tried to go to sleep, but I couldn't. Every time I opened my eyes the moonlight was more and more like daylight through the white blind. At last I almost thought I must have really been to sleep without knowing it, and that it must be morning. So I got out of bed, and went to the window and peeped; but it was still moonlight--only moonlight as bright as day--and I saw Nurse and two of the maids just going through the upper gate into the park.  In one moment I made up my mind. Nurse had only put me to bed to get me out of the way. I did not mean to trouble her, but I was determined not to lose the chance of being Brother of Pity to a robin-redbreast.  I dressed myself as well as I could, got out unobserved, and made my way to the summer-house. Things look a little paler by moonlight, otherwise I could see quite well. I put on my cloak, took my spade and the handle of the bier in my right hand, and holding the mask over my face with my left, I made my way to the quarry field.  It was a lovely night, and as I strolled along I thought with myself that the ground where Robin lay was too stony for my spade, and that I must move him a little lower, where some soft earth bordered one side of the quarry.  I was as certain as I had ever been of anything that I did not think about this till then, but when I got to the quarry the body was gone from the place where I had found it; and when I looked lower, on the bit of soft earth there lay Robin, just in the place where I was settling in my mind that I would bury him.  I could not believe my eyes through the holes in my mask, so I pulled it off, but there was no doubt about the fact. There he lay; and round him, when I looked closer, I saw a ridge like a rampart of earth, which framed him neatly and evenly, as if he were already halfway into his grave.  The moonlight was as clear as day, there was no mistake as to what I saw, and whilst I was looking the body of the bird began to sink by little jerks, as if some one were pulling it from below. When first it moved I thought that poor Robin could not be dead after all, and that he was coming to life again like the flying watchman, but I soon saw that he was not, and that some one was pulling him down into a grave.  When I felt quite sure of this, when I had rubbed my eyes to clear them, and pulled up the lashes to see if I was awake, I was so horribly frightened that, with my mask in one hand and the spade and the handle of my bier in the other, I ran home as fast as my legs would carry me, leaving the roses and the cross and the blue-velvet pall behind me in the quarry.  Nurse was still out; and I crept back to bed without detection, where I dreamed disturbedly of invisible gravediggers all through the night.  I did not feel quite so much afraid by daylight, but I was not a bit less puzzled as to how Cock Robin had been moved from the stony place to the soft earth, and who dug his grave. I could not ask Nurse about it, for I should have had to tell her I had been out, and I could not have trusted Mrs. Jones either; but Godfather Gilpin never tells tales of me, and he knows everything, so I went to him.  The more I thought of it the more I saw that the only way was to tell him everything; for if you only tell parts of things you sometimes find yourself telling lies before you know where you are. So I put on my cloak and my mask, and took the shovel and bier into the study, and sat down on the little foot-stool I always wait on when Godfather Gilpin is in the middle of reading, and keeps his head down to show that he does not want to be disturbed.  When he shut up his book and looked at me he burst out laughing. I meant to have asked him why, but I was so busy afterwards I forgot. I suppose it was the nose, for it had got rather broken when I fell down as I was burying the old drake that Neptune killed.  But he was very kind to me, and I told him all about my being a Brother of Pity, and how I had wanted to bury a robin, and how I had found one, and how he had frightened me by burying himself.  \"Some other Brother of Pity must have found him,\" said my godfather, still laughing. \"And he must have got Jack the Giant-killer's cloak of darkness for _his_ dress, so that you did not see him.\"  \"There was nobody there,\" I earnestly answered, shaking my mask as I thought of the still, lonely moonlight. \"Nothing but two beetles, and I said if they would take care of him they might be Brothers of Pity.\"  \"They took you at your word, _mio fratello_. Take off your mask, which a little distracts me, and I will tell you who buried Cock Robin.\"  I knew when Godfather Gilpin was really telling me things--without thinking of something else, I mean,--and I listened with all my ears.  \"The beetles whom you very properly admitted into your brotherhood,\" said my godfather, \"were burying beetles, or sexton beetles,[A] as they are sometimes called. They bury animals of all sizes in a surprisingly short space of time. If two of them cannot conduct the funeral, they summon others. They carry the bodies, if necessary, to suitable ground. With their flat heads (for the sexton beetle does not carry a shovel as you do) they dig trench below trench all round the body they are committing to the earth, after which they creep under it and pull it down, and then shovel away once more, and so on till it is deep enough in, and then they push the earth over it and tread it and pat it neatly down.\"  \"Then was it the beetles who were burying the robin-redbreast?\" I gasped.  \"I suspect so,\" said Godfather Gilpin. \"But we will go and see.\"  He actually knocked a book down in his hurry to get his hat, and when I helped him to pick it up, and said, \"Why, godfather, you're as bad as I was about Taylor's _Sermons_,\" he said, \"I am an old fool, my dear. I used to be very fond of insects before I settled down to the work I'm at now, and it quite excites me to go out into the fields again.\"  I never had a nicer walk, for he showed me lots of things I had never noticed, before we got to the quarry field; and then I took him straight to the place where the bit of soft earth was, and there was nothing to be seen, and the earth was quite smooth and tidy. But when he poked with his stick the ground was very soft, and after he had poked a little we saw some nut-brown feathers, and we knew it was Robin's grave.  And I said, \"Don't poke any more, please. I wanted to bury him with rose-leaves, but the beetles were dressed in black, and I gave them leave, and I think I'll put a cross over him, because I don't think it's untrue to show that he was buried by the Brothers of Pity.\"  Godfather Gilpin quite agreed with me, and we made a nice mound (for I had brought my spade), and put the best kind of cross, and afterwards I made a wreath of forget-me-nots to hang on it.  He was the only robin-redbreast I have found since I became a Brother of Pity, and that was how it was that it was not I who buried him after all.  Many of the walks that Nurse likes to take I do not care about, but one place she likes to go to, especially on Sunday, I like too, and that is the churchyard.  I was always fond of it. It is so very nice to read the tombstones, and fancy what the people were like, particularly the ones who lived long ago, in 1600 and something, with beautifully-shaped sixes and capital letters on their graves. For they must have dressed quite differently from us, and perhaps they knew Charles the First and Oliver Cromwell.  Diggory the gravedigger never talks much, but I like to watch him. I think he is rather deaf, for when I asked him if he thought, if he went on long enough, he could dig himself through to the other side of the world, he only said \"Hey?\" and chucked up a great shovelful of earth. But perhaps it was because he was so deep down that he could not hear.  Now, when he is quite out of sight, and chucks the earth up like that, it makes me think of the sexton beetles; for Godfather Gilpin says they drive their flat heads"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16121"],["title","Brothers of Pity and Other Tales of Beasts and Men (#3)"],["body","down, and then lift them with a sharp jerk, and throw the earth up so.  I said to Diggory one day, \"Don't you wish your head was flat, instead of being as it is, so that you could shovel with it instead of having to have a spade?\"  He wasn't so deep down that time, and he heard me, and put his head up out of the grave and rested on his spade. But he only scratched his head and stared, and said, \"You be an uncommon queer young gentleman, to be sure,\" and then went on digging again. And I was afraid he was angry, so I daren't ask him any more.  I daren't of course ask him if he is a Brother of Pity, but I think he deserves to be, for workhouse burials at any rate; for if you have only the Porter and Silly Billy at your funeral, I don't think you can call that having friends.  I have taken the beetles for my brothers, of course. Godfather Gilpin says I should find far more bodies than I do if they were not burying all along. I often wish I could understand them when they hum, and that they knew me.  I wonder if either they or Diggory know that they belong to the order of _Fratelli della Misericordia_, and that I belong to it too?  But of course it would not be right to ask them, even if either of them would answer me, for if we were \"known, even to each other,\" we should not really and truly be Brothers of Pity.       NOTE--Burying beetles are to the full as skilful as they      are described in this tale. With a due respect for the graces of      art, I have not embodied the fact that they feed on the carcases      which they bury. The last thing that the burying beetle does, after      tidying the grave, is to make a small hole and go down himself,      having previously buried his partner with their prey. Here the eggs      are laid, and the larvæ hatched and fed.  FOOTNOTES:  [Footnote A: _Necrophorus humator_, &c.]    FATHER HEDGEHOG AND HIS NEIGHBOURS.          *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER I.   The care of a large family is no light matter, as everybody knows. And that year I had an unusually large family. No less than seven young urchins for Mrs. Hedgehog and myself to take care of and start in life; and there was not a prickly parent on this side of the brook, or within three fields beyond, who had more than four.  My father's brother had six one year, I know. It was the summer that I myself was born. I can remember hearing my father and mother talk about it before I could see. As these six cousins were discussed in a tone of interest and respect which seemed to bear somewhat disparagingly on me and my brother and sisters (there were only four of _us_), I was rather glad to learn that they also had been born blind. My father used to go and see them, and report their progress to my mother on his return.  \"They can see to-day.\"  \"They have curled themselves up. Every one of them. Six beautiful little balls; as round as crab-apples and as safe as burrs!\"  I tried to curl myself up, but I could only get my coat a little way over my nose. I cried with vexation. But one should not lose heart too easily. With patience and perseverance most things can be brought about, and I could soon both see and curl myself into a ball. It was about this time that my father hurried home one day, tossing the leaves at least three inches over his head as he bustled along.  \"What in the hedge do you think has happened to the six?\" said he.  \"Oh, don't tell me!\" cried my mother; \"I am so nervous.\" (Which she was, and rather foolish as well, which used to irritate my father, who was hasty tempered, as I am myself.)  \"They've been taken by gipsies and flitted,\" said he.  \"What do you mean by _flitted_?\" inquired my mother.  \"A string is tied round a hind-leg of each, and they are tethered in the grass behind the tent, just as the donkey is tethered. So they will remain till they grow fat, and then they will be cooked.\"  \"Will the donkey be cooked when he is fat?\" asked my mother.  \"I smell valerian,\" said my father; on which she put out her nose, and he ran at it with his prickles. He always did this when he was annoyed with any member of his family; and though we knew what was coming, we are all so fond of valerian, we could never resist the temptation to sniff, just on the chance of there being some about.  I had long wanted to see my cousins, and I now begged my father to let me go with him the next time he went to visit them. But he was rather cross that morning, and he ran at me with his back up.  \"So you want to gad about and be kidnapped and flitted too, do you? Just let me--\"  But when I saw him coming, I rolled myself up as tight as a wood-louse, and as my ears were inside I really did not hear what else he said. But I was not a whit the less resolved to see my cousins.  One day my father bustled home.  \"Upon my whine,\" said he, \"they live on the fat of the land. Scraps of all kinds, apples, and a dish of bread and milk under their very noses. I sat inside a gorse bush on the bank, and watched them till my mouth watered.\"  The next day he reported--  \"They've cooked one--in clay. There are only five now.\"  And the next day--  \"They've cooked another. Now there are only four.\"  \"There won't be a cousin left if I wait much longer,\" thought I.  On the morrow there were only three.  My mother began to cry. \"My poor dear nephews and nieces!\" said she (though she had never seen them). \"What a world this is!\"  \"We must take it as we eat eggs,\" said my father, with that air of wisdom which naturally belongs to the sayings of the head of the family, \"the shell with the yolk. And they have certainly had excellent victuals.\"  Next morning he went off as usual, and I crept stealthily after him. With his spines laid flat to his sides, and his legs well under him, he ran at a good round pace, and as he did not look back I followed him with impunity. By and by he climbed a bank and then crept into a furze bush, whose prickles were no match for his own. I dared not go right into the bush for fear he should see me, but I settled myself as well as I could under shelter of a furze branch, and looked down on to the other side of the bank, where my father's nose was also directed. And there I saw my three cousins, tethered as he had said, and apparently very busy over-eating themselves on food which they had not had the trouble of procuring.  If I had heard less about the cooking, I might have envied them; as it was, that somewhat voracious appetite characteristic of my family disturbed my judgment sufficiently to make me almost long to be flitted myself. I fancy it must have been when I pushed out my nose and sniffed involuntarily towards the victuals, that the gipsy man heard me.  He had been lying on the grass, looking much lazier than my cousins--which is saying a good deal--and only turning his swarthy face when the gipsy girl, as she moved about and tended the fire, got out of the sight of his eyes. Then he moved so that he could see her again; not, as it seemed, to see what she was doing or to help her to do it, but as leaves move with the wind, or as we unpacked our noses against our wills when my father said he smelt valerian.  She was very beautiful. Her skin was like a trout pool--clear and yet brown. I never saw any eyes like her eyes, though our neighbour's--the Water Rat--at times recalls them. Her hair was the colour of ripe blackberries in a hot hedge--very ripe ones, with the bloom on. She moved like a snake. I have seen my father chase a snake more than once, and I have seen a good many men and women in my time. Some of them walk like my father, they bustle along and kick up the leaves as he does; and some of them move quickly and yet softly, as snakes go. The gipsy girl moved so, and wherever she went the gipsy man's eyes went after her.  Suddenly he turned them on me. For an instant I was paralyzed and stood still. I could hear my father bustling down the bank; in a few minutes he would be at home, where my brother and sisters were safe and sound, whilst I was alone and about to reap the reward of my disobedience, in the fate of which he had warned me--to be taken by gipsies and flitted.  Nothing, my dear children--my seven dear children--is more fatal in an emergency than indecision. I was half disposed to hurry after my father, and half resolved to curl myself into a ball. I had one foot out and half my back rounded, when the gipsy man pinned me to the ground with a stick, and the gipsy girl strode up. I could not writhe myself away from the stick, but I gazed beseechingly at the gipsy girl and squealed for my life.  \"Let the poor little brute go, Basil,\" she said, laughing. \"We've three flitted still.\"  \"Let it go?\" cried the young man scornfully, and with another poke, which I thought had crushed me to bits, though I was still able to cry aloud.  The gipsy girl turned her back and went away with one movement and without speaking.  \"Sybil!\" cried the man; but she did not look round.  \"Sybil, I say!\"  She was breaking sticks for the fire slowly across her knee, but she made no answer. He took his stick out of my back, and went after her.  \"I've let it go,\" he said, throwing himself down again, \"and a good dinner has gone with it. But you can do what you like with me--and small thanks I get for it.\"  \"I can do anything with you but keep you out of mischief,\" she answered, fixing her eyes steadily on him. He sat up and began to throw stones, aiming them at my three cousins.  \"Take me for good and all, instead of tormenting me, and you will,\" he said.  \"Will you give up Jemmy and his gang?\" she asked; but as he hesitated for an instant, she tossed the curls back from her face and moved away, saying, \"Not you; for all your talk! And yet for your sake, _I_ would give up--\"  He bounded to his feet, but she had put the bonfire between them, and before he could get round it, she was on the other side of a tilted cart, where another woman, in a crimson cloak, sat doing something to a dirty pack of cards.
