[Fig. 118.]  [Illustration: Fig. 118.]  The seventh or ninth of a chord, except the major seventh, may be used as preparation of a suspension when approached by a skip in an upward direction, as in Fig. 119.  [Illustration: Fig. 119.]  This species may also be written in triple rhythm. [Fig. 120.]  [Illustration: Fig. 120.]  The cadences in Fig. 121 are good, as well as those of the second species.  [Illustration: Fig. 121.]   EXERCISES  To cantus firmus _a_ write fourth species in one part. Write three settings, as usual.  To cantus firmus _b_ write fourth species in one part in triple rhythm. Write three settings, as above.  To cantus firmus _b_ write second species in one part and third in the other. [Fig. 122.]  [Illustration: Fig. 122.]   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 123.]     LESSON XVIII  FOURTH SPECIES (Continued)  EXERCISES   Write two eight-measure phrases, using the fourth species mixed in all parts. [Fig. 124_a_.]  To cantus firmus _a_ write second species in one part and fourth in the other. [Fig. 124_b_.]  To cantus firmus _b_ write third species in one part and fourth in the other.

EXERCISES  To canti firmi _a_ and _b_ write fifth species in one part. Write each three times, as usual.   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 127.]     LESSON XX  FIFTH SPECIES (Continued)  EXERCISES   To cantus firmus _a_ write second species in one part and fifth in the other. [Fig. 128_a_.]  To cantus firmus _b_ write third species in one part and fifth in the other. [_b_.]  To cantus firmus _c_ write fourth species in one part and fifth in the other. [_c_.]  To cantus firmus _d_ write fifth species in two parts. [_d_.]  [Illustration: Fig. 128.]   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 129.]     LESSON XXI  COMBINING THE VARIOUS SPECIES  EXERCISES   Write one eight-measure phrase each, of the following combinations: (1) 2nd, 3rd and 4th species (Fig. 130a); (2) 2nd, 3rd and fifth species (_b_) (3) 3rd, 5th and 5th species (_c_); (4) 2nd, 4th and 5th species (_d_); (5) 4th, 5th and 5th species (_e_).  [Illustration: Fig. 130.]     LESSON XXII  FIFTH SPECIES IN ALL PARTS  EXERCISES   Write five eight-measure phrases with fifth species in all parts, making use of imitation at the beginning as in Fig. 131. The imitation need only be relative and continue for three or four notes. It is also well, when a part uses a striking melodic figure, to have some other part imitate it immediately after.  [Illustration: Fig. 131.]     SIMPLE COUNTERPOINT IN FOUR PARTS  LESSON XXIII   [Illustration: Fig. 132.]  No new suggestions are needed, except as follows: All covered fifths and octaves permitted in harmony are allowed here. When the cantus firmus is in the lowest part and the choice of the last chord but one is V4/3 or vii_6°, use the latter, as in Fig. 133.  [Illustration: Fig. 133.]   EXERCISES  To canti firmi _a_ and _b_ write the first species in the other parts. Write each four times, setting the cantus firmus in each part in turn.   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 134.]     LESSON XXIV   [Illustration: Fig. 135.]   EXERCISES  To cantus firmus _a_ write the first species in all parts, as in the previous lesson.  To cantus firmus _b_ write the second species in one part. Write four times, and change with each solution, so that both the cantus firmus and the second species will appear in each part. [Fig. 135.]   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 136.]     LESSON XXV   [Illustration: Fig. 137.]   EXERCISES  To cantus firmus _a_ write second species in one part as previously directed.  To cantus firmus _b_ write the first and second species mixed in the other three parts. [Fig. 137_a_.]  To cantus firmus _c_ write third species in one part, as directed for the second species (_b_).   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 138.]     LESSON XXVI   [Illustration: Fig. 139.]   EXERCISES  To cantus firmus _a_ write the second species in two parts and the first in the others. Write twice, changing the parts about. [Fig. 139_a_.]  To cantus firmus _b_ write third species in one part as previously directed.  To cantus firmus _c_ write third species mixed in the other three parts, as at Fig. 139_b_.   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 140.]     LESSON XXVII   [Illustration: Fig. 141.]   EXERCISES  To cantus firmus _a_ write the first, second and third species in the other three parts. Write twice, changing the parts about [Fig. 141_a_.]  To cantus firmus _b_ write fourth species in one part, as directed in previous lessons.

[Fig. 143_b_.]  To cantus firmus _c_ write fourth species mixed in the other parts. [Fig. 143_c_.]   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 144.]     LESSON XXIX   [Illustration: Fig. 145.]   EXERCISES  To canti firmi _a_ and _b_ write fifth species in one part, as before.   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 146.]     LESSON XXX   [Illustration: Fig. 147.]   EXERCISES  To the cantus firmus write the fifth species in two parts. Write four times, changing the cantus firmus into every part. [Fig. 147_a_.]  Write one eight-measure phrase mixing the second, third and fourth species (_b_). Also write one exercise combining the first, second, third and fourth species (_c_).   CANTUS FIRMUS  [Illustration: Fig. 148.]     LESSON XXXI   [Illustration: Fig. 149.]   EXERCISES  To the cantus firmus write the fifth species in all of the other parts. [Fig. 149_a_.]  Write four eight-measure phrases with the fifth species in all parts. [Fig. 149_b_.]   CANTUS FIRMUS  [Illustration: Fig. 150.]   LESSON XXXII  [Illustration: Fig. 151.]   EXERCISES  Write six eight-measure phrases, using the fifth species in all the parts. Let the parts begin one after the other in imitation. [Fig. 151.]     LESSON XXXIII  FLORID MELODIES AS CANTI FIRMI FREE HARMONIZATION IN TWO-PART COUNTERPOINT   [Illustration: Fig. 152.]  Thus far, all notes in the measure foreign to the harmony on the first beat were treated as dissonances. Now, the cantus firmus may be harmonized at pleasure, the only restriction being that any tone foreign to the chord with which it enters must be treated as a dissonance. [Fig. 152.]  It is not necessary that each part be strictly florid, but that the effect of the parts as a whole should be so. This applies from this point to the end of these lessons.  The suspension may now be a quarter-note, or its rhythmic equivalent. It then comes on the first (_a_) or third (_b_) quarter of the measure, and the resolution on the quarter following. The preparation should be as long as, or longer than, the suspension. [Fig. 153.]  [Illustration: Fig. 153.]  The eighth-note as in Fig. 154_a_ is good. It should be used only on the second half of a weak beat, and be preceded by a dotted quarter-note. Sixteenth-notes may be used in place of the eighth-note, but should be approached and left step-wise. [Fig. 154_b_.]  [Illustration: Fig. 154.]  The first species may be employed occasionally in the course of an exercise.  Make plentiful use of imitation.  When more than one line of a choral is used, it may be treated by having the other parts continue through the holds, as at _a_, or letting them rest, as at _b_. [Fig. 155.]  When, in place of the hold, the movement continues, it is necessary to interpolate a full measure in place of the hold. [Fig. 155 and Fig. 159.]  [Illustration: Fig. 155.]  The note under the hold may be continued the extra measure, or the part may rest and then reënter. All that is required is that it begin after the lapse of one measure, i.e., when the line ends on the accent the next line begins on the weak beat of the measure following, and if it ends on the weak beat then on the accent of the next measure.  The interval at any hold except the last of a choral may be either a perfect (_a_) or imperfect consonance (_b_). [Fig. 156.]  [Illustration: Fig. 156.]  Modulation often occurs at the holds. If so, make it clear.  In this and in succeeding lessons set the cantus firmus in any part, and transpose if necessary.   EXERCISES  To cantus firmus _b_ write two counterpoints above and two below.  To cantus firmus _a_ write one above and one below, with both parts resting at the hold. Also do the same _with the counterpoint continuing at the hold_. [Fig. 155_a, b._]   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 157.]     LESSON XXXIV  FREE HARMONIZATION IN THREE-PART COUNTERPOINT   When writing in three or more parts, it is well to let a part rest occasionally, and, when it reënters, have it imitate one of the other parts. [Fig. 158.]  [Illustration: Fig. 158.]   EXERCISES  To cantus firmus _a_ write two counterpoints above and two below in two-part counterpoint.  Write two original eight-measure phrases in two-part counterpoint.  To cantus firmus _b_ write one example in three-part counterpoint with continuous movement at the hold. [Fig. 159.]  [Illustration: Fig. 159.]   CANTI FIRMI  [Illustration: Fig. 160.]     LESSON XXXV   To canti firmi _a_ and _b_ write two parts.
