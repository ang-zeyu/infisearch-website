Enemies: Sucking insects forming white downy patches on the bark and     twigs, the _white pine weevil_, a boring insect, and the _white pine     blister rust_, a fungus, are among its principal enemies.  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--The White Pine.]  Value for planting: Aside from its value as an ornamental tree, the     white pine is an excellent tree to plant on abandoned farms and for     woodlands and windbreaks throughout the New England States, New     York, Pennsylvania, and the Lake States.  Commercial value: The wood is easily worked, light, durable, and will     not warp. It is used for naval construction, lumber, shingles,     laths, interior finish, wooden ware, etc.  Other characters: The _fruit_ is a cone, four to six inches long.  Comparisons: The tree is apt to be confused with the _Bhotan pine_     (_Pinus excelsa_), which is commonly grown as an ornamental tree.     The Bhotan pine, however, has needles much longer and more drooping     in appearance.   THE PITCH PINE (_Pinus rigida_)  Distinguishing characters: Here there are *three* needles to each     cluster, Fig. 4. They are dark, yellowish-green needles about four     inches long. The rough-looking _branches_ of the tree may be seen     _studded with cones_ throughout the year, and _clusters of leaves_     may be seen _sprouting directly from the trunk_ of the tree; see     Fig. 5. The last two are very characteristic and will distinguish     the tree at a glance.   Form and size: It is a low tree of uncertain habit and extremely rough     looking at every stage of its life. It is constantly full of dead     branches and old cones which persist on the tree throughout the     year.  Range: Eastern United States.  Soil and location: Grows in the poorest and sandiest soils where few     other trees will grow. In New Jersey and on Long Island where it is     native, it proves so hardy and persistent that it often forms pure     stands excluding other trees.  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Twig of the Pitch Pine.]  Enemies: None of importance.  Value for planting: Well adapted for the sea coast and other exposed     places. It is of extremely uncertain habit and is subject to the     loss of the lower limbs. It frequently presents a certain     picturesqueness of outline, but it could not be used as a specimen     tree on the lawn.  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--The Pitch Pine.]  Commercial value: The wood is coarse grained and is used for rough     lumber, fuel, and charcoal.  Other characters: The _fruit_ is a cone one to three inches long, persistent on the tree for several years.   THE SCOTCH PINE (_Pinus sylvestris_)  Distinguishing characters: There are *two* needles to each cluster, and     these are _short_ compared with those of the white pine, and     _slightly twisted_; see Fig. 6. The _bark_, especially along the     upper portion of the trunk, _is reddish_ in color.  Form and size: A medium-sized tree with a short crown.  Range: Europe, Asia, and eastern United States.  Soil and location: Will do best on a deep, rich, sandy soil, but will     also grow on a dry, porous soil.  Enemies: In Europe the Scotch pine has several insect enemies, but in     America it appears to be free from injury.  Value for planting: Suitable for windbreaks and woodland planting. Many     excellent specimens may also be found in our parks.  Commercial value: In the United States, the wood is chiefly used for     fuel, though slightly used for barrels, boxes, and carpentry. In     Europe, the Scotch pine is an important timber tree.  Comparisons: The Scotch pine is apt to be confused with the _Austrian     pine_ (_Pinus austriaca_), because they both have two needles to     each cluster. The needles of the Austrian pine, however, are much     longer, coarser, straighter, and darker than those of the Scotch     pine; Fig. 1. The form of the Austrian pine, too, is more     symmetrical and compact.  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Twig of the Scotch Pine.]      The _red pine_ (_Pinus resinosa_) is another tree that has two     needles to each cluster, but these are much longer than those of the     Scotch pine (five to six inches) and are straighter. The bark, which     is reddish in color, also differentiates the red pine from the     Austrian pine. The position of the cones on the red pine, which     point outward and downward at maturity, will also help to     distinguish this tree from the Scotch and the Austrian varieties.    GROUP II. THE SPRUCE AND HEMLOCK  How to tell them from other trees: The spruce and hemlock belong to the     evergreen class and may be told from the other trees by their     _leaves_. The characteristic leaves of the spruce are shown in Fig.     9; those of the hemlock in Fig. 10. These are much shorter than the     needles of the pines but are longer than the leaves of the red cedar     or arbor vitae. They are neither arranged in clusters like those of     the larch, nor in feathery layers like those of the cypress. They     adhere to the tree throughout the year, while the leaves of the     larch and cypress shed in the fall.      The spruces are pyramidal-shaped trees, with tall and tapering     trunks, thickly covered with branches, forming a compact crown. They     are widely distributed throughout the cold and temperate regions of     the northern hemisphere, where they often form thick forests over     extended areas.      There are eighteen recognized species of spruce. The Norway spruce     has been chosen as a type for this group because it is so commonly     planted in the northeastern part of the United States.      The hemlock is represented by seven species, confined to temperate     North America, Japan, and Central and Western China.  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--The Norway Spruce.]  How to tell them from each other: The needles and branches of the spruce     are _coarse_; those of the hemlock are _flat and graceful_. The     individual leaves of the spruce, Fig. 9, are four-sided and green or     blue on the under side, while those of the hemlock, Fig. 10, are     flat and are _marked by two white lines_ on the under side.   THE NORWAY SPRUCE (_Picea excelsa_)  Distinguishing characters: The characteristic appearance of the     full-grown tree is due to the *drooping branchlets* carried on *main     branches which bend upward* (Fig. 7).  Leaf: The leaves are dark green in color and are _arranged spirally_,     thus making the twigs coarser to the touch than the twigs of the     hemlock or fir. In cross-section, the individual leaflet is     quadrilateral, while that of the pine is triangular.  Form and size: A large tree with a straight, undivided trunk and a     well-shaped, conical crown (Fig. 7).  Range: Northern Europe, Asia, northern North America.  Soil and location: Grows in cool, moist situations.  Enemies: The foliage of the spruce is sometimes affected by _red     spider_, but is apt to be more seriously injured by drought, wind,     and late frosts.  Value for planting: Commonly planted as an ornamental tree and for     hedges. It does well for this purpose in a cool northern climate,     but in the vicinity of New York City and further south it does not     do as well, losing its lower branches at an early age, and becoming     generally scraggly in appearance.  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--A Group of Hemlock.]  Commercial value: The wood is light and soft and is used for     construction timber, paper pulp, and fuel.  Other characters: The _fruit_ is a large slender cone, four to seven     inches long.  Comparisons: The _white spruce_ (_Picea canadensis_) may be told from     the Norway spruce by the whitish color on the under side of its     leaves and the unpleasant, pungent odor emitted from the needles     when bruised. The cones of the white spruce, about two inches long,     are shorter than these of the Norway spruce, but are longer than     those of the black spruce.      It is essentially a northern tree growing in all sorts of locations     along the streams and on rocky mountain slopes as far north as the     Arctic Sea and Alaska. It often appears as an ornamental tree as far     south as New York and Pennsylvania.      The _black spruce_ (_Picea mariana_) may be told from the other     spruces by its small cone, which is usually only about one inch in     length. In New England it seldom grows to as large a size as the     other spruce trees.      It covers large areas in various parts of northern North America and     grows to its largest size in Manitoba. The black spruce has little     value as an ornamental tree.      The _Colorado blue spruce_ (_Picea parryana_ or _Picea pungens_)     which is commonly used as an ornamental tree on lawns and in parks,     can be told from the other spruces by its pale-blue or sage-green     color and its sharp-pointed, coarse-feeling twigs. Its small size     and sharp-pointed conical form are also characteristic.      It grows to a large size in Colorado and the Middle West. In the     Eastern States and in northern Europe where it is planted as an     ornamental tree, it is usually much smaller.  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--Twig of the Norway Spruce.]   HEMLOCK (_Tsuga canadensis_)  Distinguishing characters: Its leaves are arranged in *flat layers*,     giving a flat, horizontal and graceful appearance to the whole     branch (Fig. 8). The individual leaves are dark green above, lighter     colored below, and are *marked by two white lines on the under side*     (Fig. 10).      The leaves are arranged on little stalks, a characteristic that does     not appear in the other evergreen trees.  Form and size: A large tree with a broad-based pyramidal head, and a     trunk conspicuously tapering toward the apex. The branches extend     almost to the ground.  Range: The hemlock is a northern tree, growing in Canada and the United     States.  Soil and location: Grows on all sorts of soils, in the deepest woods as     well as on high mountain "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16116"],["title","Studies of Trees (#2)"],["body","slopes.  Enemies: None of importance.  Value for planting: The hemlock makes an excellent hedge because it     retains its lowest branches and will stand shearing. In this respect     it is preferable to the spruce. It makes a fair tree for the lawn     and is especially desirable for underplanting in woodlands, where     the shade from the surrounding trees is heavy. In this respect it is     like the beech.  Commercial value: The wood is soft, brittle, and coarse-grained, and is     therefore used mainly for coarse lumber. Its bark is so rich in     tannin that it forms one of the chief commercial products of the     tree.  Other characters: The _fruit_ is a small cone about ¾ of an inch long,     which generally hangs on the tree all winter.  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--Twig of the Hemlock.]    GROUP III. THE RED CEDAR AND ARBOR-VITAE  How to tell them from other trees: The red cedar (juniper) and     arbor-vitae may be told from other trees by their _leaves_, which     remain on the tree and keep green throughout the entire year. These     leaves differ from those of the other evergreens in being much     shorter and of a distinctive shape as shown in Figs. 12 and 13. The     trees themselves are much smaller than the other evergreens     enumerated in this book. Altogether, there are thirty-five species     of juniper recognized and four of arbor-vitae. The junipers are     widely distributed over the northern hemisphere, from the Arctic     region down to Mexico in the New World, and in northern Africa,     China, and Japan in the Old World. The arbor-vitae is found in     northeastern and northwestern America, China, and Japan. The species     mentioned here are those commonly found in America.  How to tell them from each other: The _twigs_ of the arbor-vitae are     _flat and fan-like_ as in Fig. 13; the twigs of the red cedar are     _needle-shaped or scale-like_ as in Fig. 12. The foliage of the     arbor-vitae is of a lighter color than that of the red cedar, which     is sombre green. The arbor-vitae will generally be found growing in     moist locations, while the red cedar will grow in dry places as     well. The arbor-vitae generally retains its lower branches in open     places, while the branches of the red cedar start at some distance     from the ground.   RED CEDAR (_Juniperus virginiana_)  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--The Red Cedar.]  Distinguishing characters: The tree can best be told at a glance by its     general form, size and leaves. It is a medium-sized tree with a     _symmetrical, cone-like form_, Fig. 11, which, however, broadens     out somewhat when the tree grows old. Its color throughout the year     is dull green with a tinge of brownish red, and its bark peels in     thin strips.  [Illustration: FIG. 12(a).--Twig of Young Cedar. FIG. 12(b).--Twig of Cedar (Older Tree).]  Leaf: In young trees the leaf is needle-shaped, pointed, and marked by a     white line on its under side, Fig. 12(a). In older trees it is     scale-like, Fig. 12(b), and the white line on its under side is     indistinct.  Range: Widely distributed over nearly all of eastern and central North     America.  Soil and location: Grows on poor, gravelly soils as well as in rich     bottom lands.  Enemies: The \"_cedar apple_,\" commonly found on this tree, represents a     stage of the apple rust, and for that reason it is not desirable to     plant such trees near orchards. Its wood is also sometimes attacked     by small _boring insects_.  Value for planting: Its characteristic slender form gives the red cedar     an important place as an ornamental tree, but its chief value lies     in its commercial use.  Commercial value: The wood is durable, light, smooth and fragrant, and     is therefore used for making lead-pencils, cabinets, boxes,     moth-proof chests, shingles, posts, and telegraph poles.  Other characters: The _fruit_ is small, round and berry-like, about the     size of a pea, of dark blue color, and carries from one to four bony     seeds.  Other common names: The red cedar is also often called _juniper_ and     _red juniper_.  Comparisons: The red cedar is apt to be confused with the _low juniper_     (_Juniperus communis_) which grows in open fields all over the     world. The latter, however, is generally of a low form with a flat     top. Its leaves are pointed and prickly, never scale-like, and they     are whitish above and green below. Its bark shreds and its fruit is     a small round berry of agreeable aromatic odor.   ARBOR-VITAE; NORTHERN WHITE CEDAR (_Thuja occidentalis_)  Distinguishing characters: The *branchlets* are extremely *flat and     fan-like*, Fig. 13, and have an agreeable _aromatic odor_ when     bruised. The tree is an evergreen with a _narrow conical form_.  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Twig of the Arbor-vitae.]  Leaf: Leaves of two kinds, one scale-like and flat, the other keeled,     all tightly pressed to the twig (see Fig. 13).  Form and size: A close, conical head with dense foliage near the base.     Usually a small tree, but in some parts of the northeastern States     it grows to medium size with a diameter of two feet.  Range: Northern part of North America.  Soil and location: Inhabits low, swampy lands; in the State of Maine     often forming thick forests.  Enemies: Very seldom affected by insects.  Value for planting: Is hardy in New England, where it is especially used     for hedges. It is also frequently used as a specimen tree on the     lawn.  Commercial value: The wood is durable for posts, ties, and shingles. The     bark contains considerable tannin and the juices from the tree have     a medicinal value.  Other characters: The _fruit_ is a cone about ½ inch long.  Other common names: Arbor-vitae is sometimes called _white cedar_ and     _cedar_.  Comparisons: The arbor-vitae is apt to be confused with the true _white     cedar_ (_Chamaecyparis thyoides_) but the leaves of the latter are     sharp-pointed and not flattened or fan-shaped.     CHAPTER II  HOW TO IDENTIFY TREES--(Continued)    GROUP IV. THE LARCH AND CYPRESS  How to tell them from other trees: In summer the larch and cypress may     easily be told from other trees by their _leaves_. These are     needle-shaped and arranged in clusters with numerous leaves to each     cluster in the case of the larch, and feathery and flat in the case     of the cypress. In winter, when their leaves have dropped off, the     trees can be told by their cones, which adhere to the branches.      There are nine recognized species of larch and two of bald cypress.     The larch is characteristically a northern tree, growing in the     northern and mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere from the     Arctic circle to Pennsylvania in the New World, and in Central     Europe, Asia, and Japan in the Old World. It forms large forests in     the Alps of Switzerland and France.      The European larch and not the American is the principal species     considered here, because it is being planted extensively in this     country and in most respects is preferable to the American species.      The bald cypress is a southern tree of ancient origin, the     well-known cypress of Montezuma in the gardens of Chepultepec having     been a species of Taxodium. The tree is now confined to the swamps     and river banks of the South Atlantic and Gulf States, where it     often forms extensive forests to the exclusion of all other trees.     In those regions along the river swamps, the trees are often     submerged for several months of the year.  How to tell them from each other: In summer the larch may be told from     the cypress by its leaves (compare Figs. 14 and 16). In winter the     two can be distinguished by their characteristic forms. The larch is     a broader tree as compared with the cypress and its form is more     conical. The cypress is more slender and it is taller. The two have     been grouped together in this study because they are both coniferous     trees and, unlike the other Conifers, are both deciduous, their     leaves falling in October.  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Twig of the Larch in Summer.]   THE EUROPEAN LARCH (_Larix europaea_)  Distinguishing characters: Its leaves, which are needle-shaped and about     an inch long, are borne in *clusters* close to the twig, Fig. 14.     There are many leaves to each cluster. This characteristic together     with the *spire-like* form of the crown will distinguish the tree at     a glance.  Leaf: The leaves are of a light-green color but become darker in the     spring and in October turn yellow and drop off. The cypress, which     is described below, is another cone-bearing tree which sheds its     leaves in winter.  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Twig of the Larch in Winter.]  Form and size: A medium-sized tree with a conical head and a straight     and tapering trunk. (See Fig. 90.)  Range: Central Europe and eastern and central United States.  Soil and location: Requires a deep, fresh, well-drained soil and needs     plenty of light. It flourishes in places where our native species     would die. Grows very rapidly.  Enemies: The larch is subject to the attacks of a _sawfly_, which has     killed many trees of the American species. A _fungus_ (_Trametes     pini_) which causes the tree to break down with ease is another of     its enemies.  Value for planting: A well-formed tree for the lawn. It is also useful     for group planting in the forest.  Commercial value: Because its wood is strong and durable the larch is     valuable for poles, posts, railroad ties, and in shipbuilding.  [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Twig of the Cypress.]  Other characters: The _fruit_ is a small cone about one inch long,     adhering to the tree throughout the winter.  [Illustration: FIG. 17.--The Bald Cypress.]  Comparisons: The tree is apt to be confused with the _American larch_,     also known as _tamarack_ and _hackmatack_, but differs from it in     having longer leaves, cones twice"]]]
