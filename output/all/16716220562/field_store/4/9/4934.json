By universal consent, the physical faculties of man have been divided into five senses,--seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, and smelling. It is of matter pertaining to the faculty of Smelling that this book mainly treats. Of the five senses, that of smelling is the least valued, and, as a consequence, is the least tutored; but we must not conclude from this, our own act, that it is of insignificant importance to our welfare and happiness.  By neglecting to tutor the olfactory nerve, we are constantly led to breathe impure air, and thus poison the body by neglecting the warning given at the gate of the lungs. Persons who use perfumes are more sensitive to the presence of a vitiated atmosphere than those who consider the faculty of smelling as an almost useless gift.  In the early ages of the world the use of perfumes was in constant practice, and it had the high sanction of Scriptural authority.  The patrons of perfumery have always been considered the most civilized and refined people of the earth. If refinement consists in knowing how to enjoy the faculties which we possess, then must we learn not only how to distinguish the harmony of color and form, in order to please the sight, the melody of sweet sounds to delight the ear; the comfort of appropriate fabrics to cover the body, and to please the touch, but the smelling faculty must be shown how to gratify itself with the odoriferous products of the garden and the forest.  Pathologically considered, the use of perfumes is in the highest degree prophylactic; the refreshing qualities of the citrine odors to an invalid is well known. Health has often been restored when life and death trembled in the balance, by the mere sprinkling of essence of cedrat in a sick chamber.  The commercial value of flowers is of no mean importance to the wealth of nations. But, vast as is the consumption of perfumes by the people under the rule of the British Empire, little has been done in England towards the establishment of flower-farms, or the production of the raw odorous substances in demand by the manufacturing perfumers of Britain; consequently nearly the whole are the produce of foreign countries. However, I have every hope that ere long the subject will attract the attention of the Society of Arts, and favorable results will doubtless follow. Much of the waste land in England, and especially in Ireland, could be very profitably employed if cultivated with odor-bearing plants.  The climate of some of the British colonies especially fits them for the production of odors from flowers that require elevated temperature to bring them to perfection.  But for the lamented death of Mr. Charles Piesse,[A] Colonial Secretary for Western Australia, I have every reason to believe that flower-farms would have been established in that colony long ere the publication of this work. Though thus personally frustrated in adapting a new and useful description of labor to British enterprise, I am no less sanguine of the final result in other hands.  Mr. Kemble, of Jamaica, has recently sent to England some fine samples of Oil of Behn. The Moringa, from which it is produced, has been successfully cultivated by him. The Oil of Behn, being a perfectly inodorous fat oil, is a valuable agent for extracting the odors of flowers by the maceration process.  At no distant period I hope to see, either at the Crystal Palace, Sydenham, at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, or elsewhere, a place to illustrate the commercial use of flowers--eye-lectures on the methods of obtaining the odors of plants and their various uses. The horticulturists of England, being generally unacquainted with the methods of economizing the scents from the flowers they cultivate, entirely lose what would be a very profitable source of income. For many ages copper ore was thrown over the cliffs into the sea by the Cornish miners working the tin streams; how much wealth was thus cast away by ignorance we know not, but there is a perfect parallel between the old miners and the modern gardeners.  Many readers of the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" and of the \"Annals of Pharmacy and Chemistry\" will recognize in the following pages much matter that has already passed under their eyes.  To be of the service intended, such matter must however have a book form; I have therefore collected from the above-mentioned periodicals all that I considered might be useful to the reader.  To Sir Wm. Hooker, Dr. Lindley, Mr. W. Dickinson, and Mr. W. Bastick, I respectfully tender my thanks for the assistance they have so freely given whenever I have had occasion to seek their advice.     Contents.   PREFACE   SECTION I.

INTRODUCTION AND HISTORY.  SECTION I.      \"By Nature's swift and secret working hand     The garden glows, and fills the liberal air     With lavish odors.                        There let me draw     Ethereal soul, there drink reviving gales,     Profusely breathing from the spicy groves     And vales of fragrance.\"--THOMSON.   Among the numerous gratifications derived from the cultivation of flowers, that of rearing them for the sake of their perfumes stands pre-eminent. It is proved from the oldest records, that perfumes have been in use from the earliest periods. The origin of this, like that of many other arts, is lost in the depth of its antiquity; though it had its rise, no doubt, in religious observances. Among the nations of antiquity, an offering of perfumes was regarded as a token of the most profound respect and homage. Incense, or Frankincense, which exudes by incision and dries as a gum, from _Arbor-thurifera_, was formerly burnt in the temples of all religions, in honor of the divinities that were there adored. Many of the primitive Christians were put to death because they would not offer incense to idols.      \"Of the use of these luxuries by the Greeks, and afterwards by the     Romans, Pliny and Seneca gives much information respecting perfume     drugs, the method of collecting them, and the prices at which they     sold. Oils and powder perfumery were most lavishly used, for even     three times a day did some of the luxurious people anoint and     scent themselves, carrying their precious perfumes with them to     the baths in costly and elegant boxes called NARTHECIA.\"  In the Romish Church incense is used in many ceremonies, and particularly at the solemn funerals of the hierarchy, and other personages of exalted rank.  Pliny makes a note of the tree from which frankincense is procured, and certain passages in his works indicate that dried flowers were used in his time by way of perfume, and that they were, as now, mixed with spices, a compound which the modern perfumer calls _pot-pourri_, used for scenting apartments, and generally placed in some ornamental Vase.  It was not uncommon among the Egyptian ladies to carry about the person a little pouch of odoriferous gums, as is the case to the present day among the Chinese, and to wear beads made of scented wood. The \"bdellium\" mentioned by Moses in Genesis is a perfuming gum, resembling frankincense, if not identical with it.  Several passages in Exodus prove the use of perfumes at a very early period among the Hebrews. In the thirtieth chapter of Exodus the Lord said unto Moses: \"1. And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon; of Shittim wood shalt thou make it.\" \"7. And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning; when he dresseth the lamps he shall burn incense upon it.\" \"34. Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight.\" \"35. And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together pure and holy.\" \"36. And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee; it shall be unto you most holy.\" \"37. And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof; it shall be unto thee holy for the Lord.\" \"38. Whosoever shall make like unto that to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.\"      \"It was from this religious custom, of employing incense in the     ancient temples, that the royal prophet drew that beautiful simile     of his, when he petitioned that his prayers might ascend before     the Lord like incense, Luke 1:10. It was while all the multitude     was praying without, at the hour of incense, that there appeared     to Zachary an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the     altar of incense. That the nations attached a meaning not only of     personal reverence, but also of religious homage, to an offering     of incense, is demonstrable from the instance of the Magi, who,     having fallen down to adore the new-born Jesus, and recognized his     Divinity, presented Him with gold, myrrh and frankincense. The     primitive Christians imitated the example of the Jews, and adopted     the use of incense at the celebration of the Liturgy. St. Ephræm,     "]]]
