The Queen, of course, is Henrietta Maria, and chief among the \"Experienced Persons\" referred to was certainly her Chancellor, Digby. Possibly he may even have suggested the printing of the collection. Like titles are met with again and again. _Nature's Cabinet Opened_, a medical work, was attributed to Browne, though he repudiated it. Ruthven's book I have already alluded to. _The Queen-like Closet_, a Rich Cabinet, by Hannah Wolly, came out in 1670.  Of the two books, the Queen's and her Chancellor's, Digby's has afforded me by far the most delight. Though many of the receipts are evidently given as sent in, the stamp of his personality is on the whole; and he is the poet of all these culinary artists. But on the score of usefulness to the housewife I forbear all judgment. The recipes may be thought extravagant in these late hard times--though epicurism has changed rather than vanished. Lord Bacon's receipt for making \"Manus Christi for the Stomach\" begins, \"Take of the best pearls very finely pulverised one drachm\"; and a health resolution runs, \"To take once during supper wine in which gold is quenched.\" Costly ingredients such as pearls and leaf gold appear only once among Digby's receipts. The modern housewife may be aghast at the thought of more than a hundred ways of making mead and metheglin. Mead recalls to her perhaps her first history-book, wherein she learnt of it as a drink of the primitive Anglo-Saxons. If she doubt the usefulness of the collection in her own kitchen, let her take the little volume to her boudoir, and read it there as gossiping notes of the _beau monde_ in the days when James I and the Charleses ruled the land. She will find herself in lofty company, and on intimate terms with them. They come down to our level, without any show of condescension. Lords and ladies who were personages of a solemn state pageant, are now human neighbourly creatures, owning to likes and dislikes, and letting us into the secrets of their daily habits.  It pleases me to think of Henrietta Maria, in her exile, busying herself in her still-room, and forgetting her dangers and sorrows in simpling and stilling and kitchen messes; and of her devoted Sir Kenelm, in the moments when he is neither abeting her Royalist plots, nor diverting her mind to matters of high science, or the mysteries of the Faith, but bringing to her such lowlier consolations as are hinted in \"Hydromel as I made it weak for the Queen Mother.\" We are not waiting in a chill ante-chamber when we read, \"The Queen's ordinary Bouillon de Santé in a morning was thus,\" or of the Pressis which she \"used to take at nights--of great yet temperate nourishment--instead of a Supper.\" And who can hint at Court scandals in the face of such evidence of domesticity as \"The Queen useth to baste meat with yolks of fresh eggs, &c.\" or \"The way that the Countess de Penalva makes the Portuguese eggs for the Queen is this\"? We cannot help being interested in the habits of Lady Hungerford, who \"useth to make her mead at the end of summer, when she takes up her Honey, and begins to drink it in Lent.\" My Lady Gower and her husband were of independent tastes. Each had their own receipts. It must be remembered that Dr. Johnson said no woman could write a cookery-book; and he threatened to write one himself. And Sir Kenelm had many serious rivals among his own sex.  In such an _embarras de choix_ as given by all these drink receipts, we may be in doubt whether to try \"My Lord Gorge's Meath,\" or \"The Countess of Newport's\" cherry wine, or \"The sweet drink of my Lady Stuart,\" or of Lady Windebanke, or \"Sir Paul Neile's way of making cider,\" or \"my Lord Carlisle's Sack posset\"; but one is strongly influenced by such a note as \"Sir Edward Bainton's Receipt which my Lord of Portland (who gave it me) saith, was the best he ever drank.\" I had thought of Saint-Evremond as warrior and wit, delightful satirist and letter-writer. But here is a streak of new light upon him: \"Monsieur St. Euvremont makes thus his potage de santé of boiled meat for dinner being very valetudinary.... When he is in pretty good health, that he may venture upon more savoury hotter things, &c.\" The most rigorous Protestants will relax to hear how \"To make a Pan Cotto as the Cardinals use in Rome.\" And if \"My Lord Lumley's Pease Pottage\" sounds homely, be it known, on the word of the eloquent Robert May, that his lordship \"wanted no knowledge in the discerning this mystery.\" What fastidious simplicity in the taste of the great is suggested by \"My Lord d'Aubigny eats Red-herrings thus boiled\"!  But if Sir Kenelm consorted only with the great, it was with the great of all social ranks. It was not merely on high questions of science he discoursed with the discoverer of the circulation of the blood--witness \"Dr. Harvey's pleasant water cider.\" Then there was that \"Chief Burgomaster of Antwerpe,\" with whom he must have been on pretty intimate terms, to learn that he \"used for many years to drink no other drink but this [mead]; at Meals and all times, even for pledging of healths. And though He was an old man, he was of an extraordinary vigor every way, and had every year a Child, had always a great appetite, and good digestion; and yet was not fat.\" Digby was too great a gentleman to be above exchanging receipts with the professors of the \"mystery,\" such as the Muscovian Ambassador's steward; and when \"Master Webbe who maketh the King's meath,\" on the 1st of September, 1663, came to his house to make some for him, Sir Kenelm stood by, a little suspicious lest the other great artist was bamboozling him. He had an eye for all--though it may have been one of his correspondents who says of the remnants of a dish that it \"will make good Water-gruel for the Servants.\"  The seriousness of the business is tremendous; and to ignore the fine shades in the 106 receipts for mead and metheglin would have been a frivolity unknown in Digby's circle. There is care; there is conscience; there is rivalry. The ingredients are mingled with a nice discrimination between the rights of the palate and the maintenance of health. \"Use only Morello cherries (I think) for pleasure, and black ones for health.\" You may not wait your own convenience in such serious business. \"It is best made by taking all the Canicular days into your fermentation.\" Now and again other methods of calculating than ours are used; but \"whiles you can say the Miserere Psalm very leisurely\" is as easily computed as \"while your Pulse beateth 200 stroaks.\" Quantities are a more difficult affair. How is one to know how much smallage was got for a penny in mid-seventeenth century? The great connoisseur Lord Lumley is very lax, and owns that his are \"set down by guess.\"  It is a curious old world we get glimpses of, at once barbarous, simple, and extravagant, when great ladies were expected to see to the milking of their cows, as closely as Joan Cromwell supervised her milch-kine in St. James's Park, and to the cleanliness of their servants' arms and hands, and when huntsmen rode at the bidding of the cook; for in order that venison be in good condition, \"before the deer be killed he ought to be hunted and chased as much as possible.\" The perusal of the section, \"To Feed Chickens,\" will shock our poultry-breeders. \"To make them prodigiously fat in about twelve days,\" \"My Lady Fanshawe gives them strong ale. They will be very drunk and sleep; then eat again. Let a candle stand all night over the coop, and then they will eat much all the night.\"  \"Lord Denbigh's Almond Marchpane,\" and the 'current wine' of which it is said \"You may drink safely long draughts of it,\" will appeal perhaps only to the schoolboy of our weaker generation. Yet there are receipts, doubtless gathered in Sir Kenelm's later years, that have the cautious invalid in view. Of these are the \"Pleasant Cordial Tablets, which are very comforting and strengthen nature much,\" and the liquor which is called \"smoothing.\" \"In health you may dash the Potage with a little juyce of Orange\" is in the same low key. The gruels are so many that we must wish Mr. Woodhouse had known of the book. If the admixture of \"wood-sorrel and currens\" had seemed to him fraught with peril, he could have fallen back on the \"Oatmeal Pap of Sir John Colladon.\"  Where are all the old dishes vanished to? Who has ever known \"A smoothening Quiddany of Quinces?\" Who can tell the composition of a Tansy? These are tame days when we have forgotten how to make Cock-Ale. They drank 'Sack with Clove-gilly-flowers' at the \"Mermaid,\" I am sure. What is Bragot? What is Stepony? And what Slipp-coat Cheese? Ask the baker for a Manchet. The old names call for a _Ballade. Où sont les mets d'antan?_ And, cooks, with all your exactness about pounds and ounces and minutes of the clock, can you better directions like these? Watch for \"a pale colour with an eye of green.\" \"Let it stand till you may see your shadow in it\"; or \"till it begin to blink.\" Your liquid may boil \"simpringly,\" or \"in a great ebullition, in great galloping waves.\" \"Make a liaison a moment, about an Ave Maria while.\" And all the significance of the times and seasons we have lost in our neglect to kill male hogs \"in the wane of the moon!\" For there is a lingering of astrology in all this kitchen lore. The irascible Culpeper, Digby's contemporary, poured scorn on such doctors as knew not the high science, \"Physick without astronomy being like a lamp without Oil.\"  As for the poetry I promised--well, I have been quoting it, have I not? But there is more, and better. Surely it was a romantic folk that kept in its store-rooms the \"best Blew raisins of the sun,\" or \"plumpsome raisins of the sun,\" and made its mead with dew, and eagerly exchanged with each other recipes for \"Conserve of Red Roses.\" And now we come to an essential feature of the whole. It is a _cuisine_ that does not reek of shops and co-operative stores, but of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16441"],["title","The Closet of Sir Kenelm Digby Knight Opened (#7)"],["body","wood, the garden, the field and meadow. Like Culpeper's pharmacopeia, it is made for the most part of \"Such Things only as grow in England, they being most fit for English Bodies.\" Is it any wonder that the metheglin should be called the \"Liquor of Life,\" which has these among its ingredients: Bugloss, borage, hyssop, organ, sweet-marjoram, rosemary, French cowslip, coltsfoot, thyme, burnet, self-heal, sanicle, betony, blew-button, harts-tongue, meadowsweet, liverwort, bistort, St. John's wort, yellow saunders, balm, bugle, agrimony, tormentilla, comfrey, fennel, clown's allheal, maidenhair, wall-rue, spleen-wort, sweet oak, Paul's betony, and mouse-ear?  The housewife of to-day buys unrecognisable dried herbs in packets or bottles. In those days she gathered them in their season out of doors. The companions to _The Closet Opened_ should be the hasty and entertaining Culpeper, the genial Gerard, and Coles of the delightful _Adam in Eden_, all the old herbals that were on Digby's bookshelves, so full of absurdities, so full of pretty wisdom. They will tell you how to mix in your liquor eglantine for coolness, borage, rosemary, and sweet-marjoram for vigour, and by which planet each herb or flower is governed. Has our sentiment for the flowers of the field increased now we no longer drink their essence, or use them in our dishes? I doubt it. It is surely a pardonable grossness that we should desire the sweet fresh things to become part of us--like children, who do indeed love flowers, and eat them. In the Appendix I have transcribed a list of the plants referred to. Most cooks would be unable to tell one from another; and even modern herbalists have let many fall out of use, while only a few are on the lists of the English pharmacopeia. To go simpling once more by field and wood and hedgerow would be a pleasant duty for country housewives to impose upon themselves; and as to the herbalists' observations on their virtues, we may say with old Coles, \"Most of them I am confident are true, and if there be any that are not so, yet they are pleasant.\"  There is an air of flippancy about that reflexion of Coles you will never find in Sir Kenelm. Of the virtues of each plant and flower he used he was fully convinced; and when he tells of their powers, as in his \"Aqua Mirabilis,\" the tale is like a solemn litany, and we are reminded of Clarendon's testimony to \"the gravity of his motion.\" And so, his Closet once more open, he stands at the door, his majesty not greatly lessened; for the book contains a reminiscence of his rolling eloquence, something of his romance, and not a little of his poetry.

[_Facsimile of the original title-page._]        TO THE READER   This Collection full of pleasing variety, and of such usefulness in the Generality of it, to the Publique, coming to my hands, I should, had I forborn the Publication thereof, have trespassed in a very considerable concern upon my Countrey-men, The like having not in every particular appeared in Print in the English tongue. There needs no Rhetoricating Floscules to set it off. The Authour, as is well known, having been a Person of Eminency for his Learning, and of Exquisite Curiosity in his Researches, Even that Incomparable Sir Kenelme Digbie Knight, Fellow of the Royal Society and Chancellour to the Queen Mother, (Et omen in Nomine) His name does sufficiently Auspicate the Work. I shall only therefore add, That there is herein (as by the Table hereunto affix'd will evidently to thee appear) a sufficiency of Solids as well as Liquids for the sating the Curiosities of each or the nicest Palate; and according to that old Saw in the Regiment of Health, Incipe cum Liquido, &c. The Liquids premitted to the Solids. These being so Excellent in their kinde, so beneficial and so well ordered, I think it unhandsome, if not injurious, by the trouble of any further Discourse, to detain thee any longer from falling to; Fall to therefore, and much good may it do thee,  FARE-WELL.   A RECEIPT TO MAKE METHEGLIN AS IT IS MADE AT LIEGE, COMMUNICATED BY MR. MASILLON  Take one Measure of Honey, and three Measures of Water, and let it boil till one measure be boiled away, so that there be left three measures in all; as for Example, take to one Pot of Honey, three Pots of Water, and let it boil so long, till it come to three Pots. During which time you must Skim it very well as soon as any scum riseth; which you are to continue till there rise no scum more. You may, if you please, put to it some spice, to wit, Cloves and Ginger; the quantity of which is to be proportioned according as you will have your Meath, strong or weak. But this you do before it begin to boil. There are some that put either Yeast of Beer, or Leaven of bread into it, to make it work. But this is not necessary at all; and much less to set it into the Sun. Mr. Masillon doth neither the one nor the other. Afterwards for to Tun it, you must let it grow Luke-warm, for to advance it. And if you do intend to keep your Meathe a long time, you may put into it some hopps on this fashion. Take to every Barrel of Meathe a Pound of Hops without leaves, that is, of Ordinary Hops used for Beer, but well cleansed, taking only the Flowers, without the Green-leaves and stalks. Boil this pound of Hops in a Pot and half of fair water, till it come to one Pot, and this quantity is sufficient for a Barrel of Meathe. A Barrel at Liege holdeth ninety Pots, and a Pot is as much as a Wine quart in England. (I have since been informed from Liege, that a Pot of that Countrey holdeth 48 Ounces of Apothecary's measure; which I judge to be a Pottle according to London measure, or two Wine-quarts.) When you Tun your Meath, you must not fill your Barrel by half a foot, that so it may have room to work. Then let it stand six weeks slightly stopped; which being expired, if the Meath do not work, stop it up very close. Yet must you not fill up the Barrel to the very brim. After six Months you draw off the clear into another Barrel, or strong Bottles, leaving the dregs, and filling up your new Barrel, or Bottels, and stopping it or them very close.  The Meath that is made this way, (_Viz._ In the Spring, in the Month of April or May, which is the proper time for making of it,) will keep many a year.   WHITE METHEGLIN OF MY LADY HUNGERFORD: WHICH IS EXCEEDINGLY PRAISED  Take your Honey, and mix it with fair water, until the Honey be quite dissolved. If it will bear an Egge to be above the liquor, the breadth of a groat, it is strong enough; if not, put more Honey to it, till it be so strong; Then boil it, till it be clearly and well skimmed; Then put in one good handful of Strawberry-leaves, and half a handful of Violet leaves; and half as much Sorrel: a Douzen tops of Rosemary; four or five tops of Baulme-leaves: a handful of Harts-tongue, and a handful of Liver-worth; a little Thyme, and a little Red-sage; Let it boil about an hour; then put it into a Woodden Vessel, where let it stand, till it be quite cold; Then put it into the Barrel; Then take half an Ounce of Cloves, as much Nutmeg; four or five Races of Ginger; bruise it, and put it into a fine bag, with a stone to make it sink, that it may hang below the middle: Then stop it very close.  The Herbs and Spices are in proportion for six Gallons.  Since my Lady Hungerford sent me this Receipt, she sent me word, that she now useth (and liketh better) to make the Decoction of Herbs before you put the Honey to it, This Proportion of Herbs is to make six Gallons of Decoction, so that you may take eight or nine Gallons of water. When you have drawn out into your water, all the vertue of the Herbs, throw them away, and take the clear Decoction (leaving the settlings) and when it is Lukewarm, Dissolve your proportion of Honey in it. After it is well dissolved and laved with strong Arms or woodden Instruments, like Battle-doors or Scoops, boil it gently; till you have taken away all the scum; then make an end of well boyling it, about an hour in all. Then pour it into a wooden vessel, and let it stand till it be cold. Then pour the clear through a Sieve of hair, ceasing pouring when you come to the foul thick settling. Tun the clear into your vessel (without Barm) and stop it up close, with the Spices in it, till you perceive by the hissing that it begins to work. Then give it some little vent, else the Barrel would break. When it is at the end of the working, stop it up close. She useth to make it at the end of Summer, when she takes up her Honey, and begins to drink it in Lent. But it will be better if you defer piercing it till next Winter. When part of the Barrel is drunk, she botteleth the rest, which maketh it quicker and better. You clear the Decoction from the Herbs by a Hair-sieve.   SOME NOTES ABOUT HONEY  The Honey of dry open Countries, where there is much Wild-thyme, Rosemary, and Flowers, is best. It is of three sorts, Virgin-honey, Life-honey, and Stock-honey. The first is the best. The Life-honey next. The Virgin-honey is of Bees, that swarmed the Spring before, and are taken up in Autumn; and is made best by chusing the Whitest combs of the Hive, and then letting the Honey run out of them lying upon a Sieve without pressing it, or breaking of the Combs. The Life-honey is of the same Combs broken after the Virgin-honey is run from it; The Merchants of Honey do use to mingle all the sorts together. The first of a swarm is called Virgin-honey.
