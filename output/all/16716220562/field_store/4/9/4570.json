One train had taken the girls southward to Santa Barbara, and another had taken the boys eastward to Denver and to Chicago. At the latter city the lads had made a quick change, and twenty-six hours later found them at Oak Run, and in the carriage for the farm.     CHAPTER II  NEWS OF INTEREST   \"My boys! my boys!\"  Such was the cry given by Anderson Rover, when he caught sight of the occupants of the carriage, as the turnout swept up to the piazza of the comfortable farm home.     \"Home again! Home again    Safe from a foreign shore!\"  sang out Tom, and leaping to the ground, he caught his father around the shoulders. \"Aren't you glad to see us, father?\" he went on.  \"Glad doesn't express it, Tom,\" replied the fond parent, as he embraced first one and then another. \"My heart is overflowing with joy, and I thank God that you have returned unharmed, after having passed through so many grave perils. How brown all of you look!\"  \"Tanned by the tropical sun,\" answered Sam. \"Oh, here is Aunt Martha, and Uncle Randolph!\"  \"Sam!\" burst out the motherly aunt, as she kissed him. \"Oh, how you must have suffered on that lonely island!\" And then she kissed the others.  \"We've certainly had our fill of adventures,\" came from Dick, who was shaking hands with his Uncle Randolph. \"And more than once we thought we should never see Valley Brook farm again.\"  \"We were real Robinson Crusoes,\" went on Sam. \"And the girls were Robinson Crusoes, too.\"  \"Are the girls well?\" questioned Mrs. Rover.  \"Very well, auntie. If they hadn't been we shouldn't have parted with them in San Francisco. They went back to Santa Barbara to finish their vacation.\"  \"I see. Well, it certainly was a wonderful trip. You'll have to tell us all the particulars this evening. I suppose you are as hungry as bears just now. Tom is, I'm sure.\"  \"Oh, Aunt Martha, I see you haven't forgotten my failing,\" piped in the youth mentioned, with a twinkle in his eye. \"And do I get pie for dinner?\"  \"Yes, Tom, and all you care to eat, too. We are going to make your home-coming a holiday.\"  \"Good!\"  They were soon in the house, every nook and corner of which was so familiar to them. They rushed up to their rooms, and, after a brushing and a washing up, came down to the big dining room, where the table fairly groaned with good things.  \"Gosh! this is a regular Christmas spread!\" observed Tom, as he looked the table over. \"Tell you what, Aunt Martha, I'm going to be cast away every week after this.\"  \"Oh, Tom, don't speak of it! After this you must stay right here. Neither your father nor your uncle nor myself will want to leave you out of sight.\"  \"Pooh! We can't stay home. But we'll be careful of our trips in the future, you can be sure of that.\"  \"Have you heard anything about Putnam Hall since we went away?\" asked Dick, during the meal.  \"The academy opened again last week, Dick,\" answered his father. \"We received a circular letter from Captain Putnam. The scarlet fever scare did not amount to much, for which the captain is very thankful.\"  \"I sent him a telegram, stating we were safe,\" said Sam. \"I knew he would like to hear from us. The captain is a brick.\"  \"The best ever,\" said Tom, with his mouth full of chicken.  \"And ditto, Mr. Strong,\" put in Dick, referring to the head assistant at the Hall.  \"Exactly, Dick. But no more Jasper Grinders in mine,\" went on Tom, referring to a tyrannical teacher who had caused them much trouble, and who had been discharged from the academy, as already mentioned in \"The Rover Boys in the Mountains.\"  \"Or Josiah Crabtrees,\" said Dick, referring to another teacher, who had been made to leave Putnam Hall, and who had wanted to marry the widow Stanhope, in an endeavor to get control of the money that was coming to Dora. Crabtree's misdeeds had landed him in prison, where he was likely to stay for some time to come.  While the meal was still in progress the boys began the recital of their many adventures, and this recital was kept up until a late hour. It was astonishing how much they had to tell, and how interesting it proved to the listeners.  \"You might make a book of it,\" said Anderson Rover. \"It equals our adventures in the jungles of Africa.\"  \"I am going to write it out some day,\" answered Dick. \"And, maybe, I'll get the story printed. The trouble is, I can't end the tale properly.\"  \"How is that, Dick?\" asked his Uncle Randolph. \"You were all saved. Isn't that a proper ending for any book?\"  \"Yes, but what of the villain? Baxter didn't show himself, and that is no ending at all. He should have fallen over a cliff, or been shot, or something like that.\"  \"And we should have married the three girls,\" put in fun-loving Tom. \"That would make the story even more complete.\"  \"Well, things do not happen in real life as they do in story books,\" said the parent. \"It is likely you will never hear of Dan Baxter again. But we may hear from his father.\"  \"His father!\" exclaimed the three youths in concert.  \"Why, Arnold Baxter is in prison,\" added Sam.  \"He was, up to five days ago, when they took him to the hospital to undergo some sort of an operation. At the hospital the operation was postponed for a day, and during the night he slipped away from the institution and disappeared.\"  \"Well, I never!\" burst out Dick. \"Isn't he the slick one, though! Just when you think you've got him hard and fast, you haven't at all.\"  \"Haven't they any trace of him?\" asked Sam.  \"None, so far as I have heard. There was a report that he had gone to New York and taken passage on a ship bound for Liverpool, but at present the ship is on the Atlantic, so the authorities can do nothing.\"  \"I hope they catch him.\"  \"We all hope that, Sam.\"  For a few days the three boys did nothing but take it easy. It was pleasant weather, and they roamed around the farm in company with their father and their uncle, or with Alexander Pop, the colored man of work. As my old readers know, Pop had been in former days a waiter at Putnam Hall, and Dick, Tom, and Sam had befriended him on more than one occasion, for which he was extremely grateful.  \"Yo' boys is jes' naturally fust-class heroes,\" said Aleck one day. \"Even if dem cannonballs had cum after yo', I don't t'ink da could have cotched yo', no, sirree!\"  \"It's a pity you weren't along, Aleck,\" answered Tom.  \"I can't say as to dat, Master Tom. I got 'bout all de hair-raisin' times I wanted when we was in de jungles ob Africy. I'se only sorry ob one t'ing.\"  \"And what is that?\"  \"Dat you didn't jes' go an' frow dat Dan Baxter overboard from dat ship de fust time yo' sot eyes on him. Suah as yo' am born he'll turn up some day to make moah trouble.\"  \"Well, if he turns up we'll be ready for him,\" returned Tom grimly.  \"How can yo' be ready fo' a pusson wot acts like a snake in de grass? He'll sting befo' yo' hab de chance to spot him.\"  \"We'll have to keep our eyes open, Aleck,\" answered the youth; and then the subject was changed.  During those days the boys went fishing and bathing in the river, and also visited Humpback Falls, that spot where Sam had had such a thrilling adventure, as related in \"The Rover Boys at School.\"  \"What a lot has happened since those days,\" said Sam, taking a deep breath. \"Tom, do you remember how you got into trouble with old Crabtree the very first day we landed at Putnam Hall?\"  \"I do, Sam; and do you remember our first meeting, on the boat, with Dan Baxter, and how we sent him about his business when he tried to annoy Nellie, and Grace, and Dora?\"  \"Yes, indeed. Say, I am getting anxious to get back to the Hall. It seems almost like a second home.\"  \"So am I,\" put in Dick. \"Besides, we have lost time enough from our studies. We'll have to pitch in, or we'll drop behind our classes.\"  \"Father says we can return to the Hall next Monday, if we wish.\"  \"I vote we do so.\"  \"So do I.\"  And thus it was decided that they should return to the academy four days later.  But during those four days something was to happen which would have an important bearing upon their future actions.     CHAPTER III  A MIDNIGHT VISITOR   The next day, shortly after noon, it began to rain, and the storm increased in violence until the wind blew almost a gale.  The rain kept the boys indoors, at which Tom was inclined to grumble.  \"No use of grumbling, Tom,\" said Dick cheerfully. \"Let us improve the time by looking over our school books. That will make it easier to slip into the grind again when we get back to the Hall.\"  \"That is excellent advice, Richard,\" said Randolph Rover. \"Whatever you do, do not neglect your studies.\"  \"By the way, Uncle Randolph, how is scientific farming progressing?\" said Tom, referring to something that had been his uncle's hobby for years--a hobby that had cost the gentleman considerable money.  \"Well--ah--to tell the truth, Thomas, not as well as I had hoped for.\"  \"Hope you didn't drop a thousand or two this year, uncle?\"  \"Oh, no--not over fifty dollars.\"  \"Then you got off easy.\"  \"I shall do better next year. The potatoes already show signs of improvement.\"  \"Good! I suppose you'll be growing 'em on top of the ground soon. Then you won't have the bother of digging 'em, you know,\" went on the fun-loving boy innocently.  \"Absurd, Thomas! But I shall have some very large varieties, I feel certain.\"  \"Big as a watermelon?\"  \"Hardly, but--\"  \"Big as a muskmelon, then?\"  \"Not exactly, but--\"  \"About the size of a cocoanut, eh?\"  \"No! no! They will be as large as--\"  \"I mean a little cocoanut,\" pleaded Tom, while Sam felt like laughing outright.  \"Well, yes, a little cocoanut. You see--\"  \"We saw some big potatoes in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15795"],["title","The Rover Boys in Camp; or, The Rivals of Pine Island (#2)"],["body","rnia, Uncle Randolph.\"  \"Ah! Of what variety?\"  \"_Cornus bustabus_, or something like that. Sam, what was the name, do you know?\"  \"That must be something like it, Tom,\" grinned the youngest Rover.  \"Took two men to lift some of those potatoes,\" went on Tom calmly.  \"Two men? Thomas, surely you are joking.\"  \"No, uncle, I am telling nothing but the strict truth.\"  \"But two men! The potatoes must have been of monstrous size!\"  \"Oh, not so very big. But they did weigh a good deal, no question of it.\"  \"Think of two men lifting one potato!\"  \"I didn't say one potato, Uncle Randolph. I said some of those potatoes.\"  \"Eh?\"  \"The men had a barrel full of 'em.\"  \"Thomas!\" The uncle shook his finger threateningly. \"At your old tricks, I see. I might have known it.\" And then he stalked off to hide his chagrin.  \"Tom, that was rather rough on Uncle Randolph,\" said Sam, after a laugh.  \"So it was, Sam. But I've got to do something. This being boxed up, when one might be fishing or swimming, or playing baseball, is simply dreadful,\" answered the other.  Just before the evening meal was announced Jack Ness came up from the barn, and sought out Randolph Rover.  \"Found a man slinking around the cow-shed a while ago,\" he said. \"He looked like a tramp. I wanted to talk to him, but he scooted in double-quick order.\"  \"Humph! We haven't had any tramps here in a long time,\" came from Randolph Rover. \"Where did he go to?\"  \"Down toward the berry patch.\"  \"Did you follow him up?\"  \"I did, sir, but he got away from me.\"  \"You must keep a close watch for those fellows,\" said Randolph Rover bluntly. \"I don't want any of them getting in our barn and burning it down to the ground.\"  \"You are right, Randolph,\" said Anderson Rover. \"Make them keep away from the place by all means, Jack.\"  \"I'll keep my eye peeled for 'em,\" answered the hired man.  The wind was now blowing a gale, causing the trees near the farmhouse to creak and groan, and banging more than one shutter. But the boys did not mind this, and went to bed promptly at the usual hour.  \"A storm like this on land is nothing to one on the sea,\" was the way Tom expressed himself. \"I don't like anything better than to listen to the whistling of the wind when I am snug in bed.\"  For the time being Sam and Tom were occupying a room in the L of the farmhouse, and Dick had a small bedchamber adjoining. The boys were soon undressed, and, having said their prayers, hopped into bed, and were soon sound asleep.  It was not until half an hour later that the older folks retired. Anderson Rover was the last to leave the sitting room, where he had been busy writing some letters at the desk that stood there.  As he was about to retire he fancied he heard a noise outside of one of the windows. He drew up the curtain and looked through the glass, but could see nothing.  \"It must have been the wind,\" he murmured. \"But, somehow, it didn't sound like it.\"  As he stepped into the dark hallway an uneasy feeling took possession of him--a feeling hard to define, and one for which he could not account.  \"I think I had better go around and see that all the doors and windows are properly locked,\" he told himself. \"Brother Randolph may have overlooked one of them.\"  He walked the length of the hallway, and stepped into the kitchen and over to a side window.  As he had his hand on the window-latch he heard a quick step directly behind him.  He started to turn, but before he could do so he received a blow on the head from a club that staggered him. Then he was jerked backward to the floor.  \"Silence!\" muttered a voice close to his ear. \"Don't you dare to make a sound!\"  \"What does this mean--\" he managed to gasp.  \"Silence, I tell you!\" was the short answer. \"If you say another word, I will hit you again!\"  Having no desire to receive a blow that might render him totally unconscious, or, perhaps, take his life, Anderson Rover said no more. He heard a match struck, and then a bit of a tallow candle was lit and placed on the edge of the kitchen table.  By this dim light the father of the Rover boys saw standing over him a tall man, beardless, and with his head closely cropped. One glance into that hardened face sufficed to tell him who the unwelcome visitor was.  \"Arnold Baxter!\"  \"I see you recognize me,\" was the harsh reply. \"Not so loud, please, unless you want that crack I promised you.\"  \"What brings you here, and at such an hour as this?\"  \"I find it more convenient to travel during the night than in the daytime.\"  \"The police are on your track.\"  \"I know that as well you, Rover.\"  \"What do you want here?\"  \"What does any man want when he has been stripped of all his belongings? I want money.\"  \"I have none for you.\"  \"Bosh! Do you think I have forgotten how you and your boys swindled me out of my rights to that mine in the far West?\"  \"We did not swindle you, Baxter. The claim was lawfully mine.\"  \"I can't stop to argue the question, and I don't want you to talk so loud, remember that. No, don't try to get up,\" went on the midnight visitor, as Anderson Rover attempted to rise. \"Stay just where you are.\"  He was feeling in his pocket, and now he brought forth a strip of cloth, with a knot tied in the middle.  It was a gag, and he started to place it in Anderson Rover's mouth, when the latter leaped up and began to struggle with all the force he could command.  \"Stop, I tell you!\" cried Arnold Baxter softly.  \"Stop!\" And then, catching up his club once more, he dealt Anderson Rover another blow, this time directly across the temple. The gentleman wavered for an instant, gave a deep groan, and fell like a log to the floor.     CHAPTER IV  A USELESS PURSUIT   Half an hour later Tom awoke with a start. For the moment he could not tell what had aroused him. Then he remembered hearing the slam of a door or a window sash.  \"Must have been the storm,\" he told himself, and was about to turn over and go to sleep when he heard a gun-shot from the direction of the barn.  \"Something is wrong, that's certain!\" he cried. \"Sam, wake up!\"  \"What's the row, Tom?\" questioned the youngest brother sleepily.  Before Tom could reply they heard Dick getting up, and also their Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha.  \"What did that shot mean?\" demanded Randolph Rover, coming toward the boys' rooms. \"Did any of you fire it?\"  \"No, it came from outside,\" returned Torn. \"Hark!\"  \"Hullo, in the house!\" came in the voice of Jack Ness. \"Wake up, everybody! Something is wrong!\"  After this it did not take long for those upstairs to slip into some clothing, and go below. Randolph Rover ran to the side door, to find it wide open. Dick lit the hall lamp.  \"Saw a man running across the garden,\" said Jack Ness, who had his shot-gun with him. \"I yelled to him to stop, and then fired the gun. I think he came from the house.\"  \"How did you happen to be up?\" asked Sam.  \"One of the horses is sick, and I was attending to him.\"  By this time some of the others were looking into the various rooms.  \"The desk has been broken open!\" cried Dick. \"And the pantry in the corner, too!\"  \"Mercy, save us!\" shrieked Mrs. Rover, from the kitchen. \"Come here at once. Poor Anderson has been killed!\"  \"Killed!\" gasped Tom; and then all ran to the kitchen as quickly as they could.  They found Anderson Rover lying where he had fallen, and still unconscious. There was a lump on his forehead, and a thin stream of blood trickled down one side of his face.  \"Thank heaven, he is not dead!\" murmured Dick, as he knelt beside his father. \"But he has been struck some cruel blows. Somebody fetch water and a bandage.\"  The water was procured, and also a bandage, and under skillful treatment, Anderson Rover was presently restored to consciousness.  \"Where--where is he?\" he questioned, when he could speak.  \"Do you mean the person who struck you down?\" asked Dick.  \"Ye--yes.\"  \"I don't know. Got away, I guess.\"  \"The villain! He attacked me most foully!\"  \"I saw him running across the garden,\" put in the hired man. \"Did he steal anything?\"  \"To be sure he stole something,\" said Sam. \"He ransacked the whole lower floor, by the looks of things.\"  \"Wonder who it was?\" put in Tom.  \"It was Arnold Baxter,\" answered his father.  \"Arnold Baxter!\" cried the others in chorus.  \"Are you certain?\" asked Dick.  \"Yes. He struck me down, and then lit the bit of tallow candle you see lying there. Then we struggled, and he hit me again, and that is all I know. But I am sure it was Baxter, for I spoke to him. He accused us of having robbed him of that mine out West.\"  \"Was he alone?\" asked Randolph Rover.  \"I saw no one else.\"  \"We ought to follow him up,\" declared Tom, now that he realized his father was not so badly hurt as at first feared.  \"That's the talk!\" ejaculated Dick. \"Wait till I get my pistol.\"  \"Boys, do keep out of harm,\" pleaded Mrs. Rover. \"Remember that this Arnold Baxter is a desperate criminal.\"  \"We are not afraid of him,\" answered Tom.  \"We'll show him that he can't come here and attack father,\" added Sam.  Leaving their father in the care of their Aunt Martha, the three Rover boys armed themselves and sallied forth, accompanied by their uncle and Alexander Pop, the latter carrying a horse-pistol of the old-fashioned variety.  \"Dat dar Baxter am a rascal of de fust water,\" was Aleck's comment. \"He deserbes to be shot full ob holes, an' I am de boy to do dat same, if only I gets de chance.\"  Jack Ness was closely questioned, and he described the spot where he had last seen the unwelcome midnight visitor.  \"He had a bag of something over his shoulder,\" he declared.  \"Most likely the stuff taken from the house,\" declared Dick.  The party crossed the garden patch and then took to the path which ran down toward the river.  Here all was intensely dark, although it had stopped raining, and the wind was trying its best to scatter the heavy clouds that obscured the stars.  \"Not a thing to see,\" observed Randolph Rover. \"We may as well go back.\"  \"Let us scatter and make a search,\" came"]]]
