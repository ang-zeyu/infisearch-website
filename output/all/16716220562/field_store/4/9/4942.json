Nor a white child!  POWHATAN. I think with you, my children. Your words are my words.  MEDICINE MAN. This night we should creep upon them!  BRAVES. Yes! Yes! Yes!  POWHATAN. This night it shall be done! Lie here and sleep, my braves, till midnight. Then we will rise and creep upon them. Women, take the children to the wigwams. Pocahontas, fill my quiver full of arrows.

Powhatan is coming! He is coming with his braves! They come creeping while you sleep!  SMITH. What is this?  POCAHONTAS. They come to kill you and the women and the children!  SMITH. Rolfe, Rolfe, do you hear that?  [ROLFE _comes from the cabin._]  ROLFE. I heard! I'll go and warn the people!  SMITH. Tell them to run quickly to the fort!  ROLFE. I'll tell them!  [_He goes, running._]  SMITH. It is brave of you to warn us, Pocahontas.  POCAHONTAS. I could not bear to have the little children killed.  SMITH. You have saved them and their mothers and their fathers. Me, you have saved twice.  [_Pocahontas starts to go._]  POCAHONTAS. Good-by, white chief. I go now to my wigwam.  SMITH. Girl! Girl! You must not go! The braves will know you warned us!  POCAHONTAS. They will not know, white chief. At midnight they were to leave the camp. I will get back by that time.  SMITH. It is midnight now. They have missed you by this time, Pocahontas.  POCAHONTAS. What shall I do? What shall I do?  SMITH. You must stay with us.  POCAHONTAS. I cannot leave my father, white chief.  [_She starts to go._]  SMITH. You must not go! The braves will not let you live! I fear your father could not save you from them!  [_Enter_ ROLFE, _running._]  ROLFE. To the fort! To the fort! The Indians are upon us! To the fort!  SMITH. Come, Pocahontas! There is our fort across the road. You will be safe in there.  POCAHONTAS. How can I leave my father!  [_Enter_ MEN, WOMEN, _and_ CHILDREN, _running. They enter the fort._]  SMITH. Come, Pocahontas! Come!  [_He leads her into the fort just as the_ INDIANS _creep in from the forest. They see Pocahontas and rush at her, but Rolfe shuts the gates._]  BRAVES. Pocahontas! Pocahontas!  MEDICINE MAN. 'Tis Pocahontas who has warned them!  BRAVES. Yes, yes! 'Tis Pocahontas!  MEDICINE MAN. Do you hear that, Chief Powhatan?  POWHATAN. I hear.  A BRAVE. She has betrayed her own people!  SECOND BRAVE. We should never take her back to us!  THIRD BRAVE. We should not let her live!  MEDICINE MAN. Aye, braves, aye! We should not let her live! We will demand her from the white men!  BRAVES. Yes, yes!  MEDICINE MAN. Shall we offer them peace in return for Pocahontas?  BRAVES. Yes, yes, yes!  MEDICINE MAN. Do you hear that, Chief Powhatan?  [_There is a long pause._]  POWHATAN. Go, take the peace flag to them, and ask for Pocahontas.  [_The_ MEDICINE MAN _raises a white flag and goes to the fort. Captain Smith and many men come out._]  SMITH. Do you come to offer peace?  MEDICINE MAN. We offer peace, great chief, if you will give up Pocahontas.  SMITH. And what if we will not give her up?  MEDICINE MAN. We will make war upon you.  SMITH. We will not give her up.  MEDICINE MAN. Then not a man of you shall live! Nor a woman! Nor a child!  SMITH. Pocahontas is our friend. We will not give her up to you.  MEDICINE MAN. Shoot them, braves! Shoot them, as they stand there!  POWHATAN. Do not dare to shoot one arrow! I, Powhatan, speak.  (_To Smith._)  I see you are my daughter's friend, white chief.  SMITH. I am, and would be yours, if you would let me.  POWHATAN. Your white braves take our land from us.  SMITH. They shall pay you. As I am chief here, they shall pay you.  POWHATAN. Your white braves take our corn from us. They will not let us fish in our own rivers.  SMITH. I did not know such wrongs were done you. My braves shall pay for everything in full.  POWHATAN. Then there shall be peace between us. Bring the peace pipe, braves. We will smoke in friendship with our brothers.  SMITH. And Pocahontas will be pardoned? You will take her back as your own daughter?  POWHATAN. Pocahontas will be pardoned, white chief. She shall come and go, as she may please, between our wigwams and yours, my brother.  _[A brave comes with the peace pipe, which he gives to Powhatan, who hands it to Captain Smith._]  SMITH (_taking pipe_). 'Tis for eternal peace between us!     KING ALFRED AND THE CAKES  [Footnote: The teacher should explain that King Alfred was one of the most famous and best beloved kings of England, and that while he was king the Danes were trying to conquer England. At the time of the story, he had been defeated by the Danes, and was compelled to hide with a few followers in the forest to avoid falling into the hands of the enemy.]   TIME: _More than a thousand years ago._ PLACE: _a forest in England._         *       *       *       *       *  KING ALFRED. DANISH CHIEF. GOODWIFE. ENGLISH SOLDIERS. PRINCE. DANES.         *       *       *       *       *  [_A hut is at one side. Near by is a pile of burning fagots. The_ PRINCE _enters from the forest. He carries a great spear. He looks about; creeps to the hut and looks in the window; shows satisfaction; returns to the forest._]  PRINCE (_softly_). All is well. Enter!  (_Enter_ Two ENGLISH SOLDIERS _from forest. They carry large bows and wear quivers holding arrows._)  We are safe here, my men. Tell King Alfred that.  [_The first Soldier salutes and enters forest._]  SECOND SOLDIER. Danes may hide in the hut, Prince--  PRINCE (_shaking head_). There's only an old woman within.  [_Enter_ FIRST SOLDIER. _He holds the bushes and vines aside._]  FIRST SOLDIER. The king!  [_Enter_ KING ALFRED. _He is disguised as a beggar. He is young, manly, and courageous._]  PRINCE (_bowing)._ You can rest safely here, King Alfred.  KING. Do you think the Danes are still in pursuit?  PRINCE. No, your Majesty, I am sure we have escaped them this time.  SECOND SOLDIER. Besides, they would not know your Majesty dressed so.  KING (_anxiously_). Gentlemen, disguise yourselves as you have me.  PRINCE. That will not do, Sire. The Danes must not see you dressed as we are. 'Twill make you safer.  KING. Aye, but there's more danger for you dressed so. Come, be beggars now with me!  FIRST SOLDIER (_shaking head_). Our first thought is for you, Sire.  SECOND SOLDIER. Should you fall into the Danes' hands now, what will become of England?  KING. Why, she must fight again!  PRINCE, (_shaking head_). Our soldiers ran from the Danes to-day, and lost the battle to them!  KING. 'Tis because they fear these Danes as they do monsters,--monsters come to rob them,--to burn their homes,--to make them slaves!  SOLDIERS. Aye! Aye!  KING. If only I could turn their fear to rage and fierce, hot anger! Then England would not flee! She'd fight her foes and conquer!  SOLDIERS. Aye! Aye!  PRINCE. 'Tis for that great work you should save yourself, Sire! For that, you should wear the beggar's rags now!  [_Enter_ ENGLISH SOLDIERS _in great haste._]  THIRD SOLDIER. Sire, save yourself! The Danes still follow us!  FOURTH SOLDIER. They have crossed the river!  THIRD SOLDIER. They pursue your Majesty!  PRINCE. Go to the hut there, Sire. Let the Danes find you begging from the goodwife.  KING. But you, my men, where will you hide?  FIRST SOLDIER. We'll scatter, Sire.  KING. Then go, go at once! I'll await you here, if the Danes go on.  PRINCE (_saluting_). Farewell, my King!  SOLDIERS (_saluting_). Farewell, King Alfred, farewell!  [_They go. The King crosses to hut, and knocks at door, which is opened by the_ GOODWIFE. _She holds a wooden bowl and a large flat stone in her hands._]  GOODWIFE (_aside_). Another beggar, as I live!  (_Aloud, sharply_). Well, what do you want?  KING. A bite to eat, goodwife.  GOODWIFE. My cakes are not yet baked.  KING. I will wait, then.  GOODWIFE (_indignantly_). Well, and you will not, sir!  KING (_alarmed_). You will not drive me off, good woman!  GOODWIFE. And who are you, that you should sit by and wait, whilst I do all the work! And do you think you are the king, sir?  KING. No, no! I--  GOOD WIFE (_interrupting_). You'll fry the cakes yourself, sir! And that you will at once, sir! Go now and mend the fire, and lay this stone upon it.  [_The King takes the stone; crosses to the fire, and stirs it; places the stone on the burning wood. When the stone is hot, the Goodwife pours the batter from the bowl on the stone._]  GOODWIFE. Now watch these cakes while I'm within. And watch them well: rye cakes do burn while one is winking.  KING. I'll watch them carefully, goodwife.  (_The Goodwife enters hut. The King turns the cakes carefully, then sits on a log; he shows that his thoughts are far"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16379"],["title","Children's Classics in Dramatic Form, Book Two (#8)"],["body","y._)  I _will_ drive them out! I _will!_  (_Pause._)  To-night I'll get my men together.  (_Pause._)  We will take them by surprise--at daybreak.  [_Enter the_ GOODWIFE; _she rushes to the fire._]  GOOD WIFE (_looking at cakes_). Burnt to cinders! Not one of them fit to eat!  KING. I am sorry--I--  GOOD WIFE (_interrupting)._ Oh, you good-for-nothing! I would like to beat you!  KING. What can I do to make it right?  GOODWIFE (_taking up a stick_). You'll mix more dough! More dough! Do you hear?  KING. I'll be glad to do it, Madam!  GOODWIFE (_flourishing stick_). In with you! Now in with you, and get to work!  [_The King enters the hut. Enter_ DANISH CHIEF _and_ DANES _from the forest. They carry spears and shields._]  GOODWIFE (_with fear; dropping stick_). The Danes!  CHIEF (_haughtily)._ Aye, Danes!  GOODWIFE. I have no silver! Not a piece, sir!  CHIEF. Burn the hut, men!  DANES. Aye! Aye!  [_They start toward the hut. The Goodwife falls on her knees before them._]  GOODWIFE. I pray you, spare my home!  [Illustration: \"NOT ONE OF THEM FIT TO EAT!\"]  CHIEF. We spare no home to any English. Do you not know that?  GOODWIFE. I've heard so--  FIRST DANE. We'll burn every home on English land before we go!  SECOND DANE. And drive every Englishman into the seas!  DANES. Aye! Aye!  GOODWIFE (_sobbing)._ I pray you--  CHIEF (_roughly)._ Come, get up! Get up and cease your weeping! I like it not. Get up, I say!  [_Goodwife rises, trembling with fear._]  CHIEF. Now listen; we will not burn your hut, if you will tell us what we wish to know.  GOODWIFE. I will tell you what I can--  CHIEF. Did King Alfred pass this way in flight?  GOODWIFE (_starting_). What? Our king in flight?  CHIEF (_angrily_). Come, no tears for him! Did he pass this way, I say?  GOODWIFE. No, my lord.  FIRST DANE. Do not believe her, chief! There's not an Englishman that would not hide him from us!  GOODWIFE (_forgetting her fear_). Aye, and die for him!  CHIEF (_angrily)._ Say not such words to me! I am your king that is to be!  DANES. Aye! Aye!  CHIEF. Go search within the hut, Danes!  [_Danes enter hut. They come out immediately bringing King Alfred._]  FIRST DANE. We found this man within, chief.  SECOND DANE. 'Tis only her husband, I think.  GOODWIFE (_indignantly_). _Husband_, say you?--that beggar!  CHIEF (_showing suspicion_). Ah, a beggar--!  GOODWIFE. Yes, my lord, he came but just before you.  FIRST DANE (_whispering_). Hear that, my lord,--just before us!  SECOND DANE (_whispering_). It may be King Alfred!  THIRD DANE (_whispering_). Disguised as a beggar, sir!  FOURTH DANE (_whispering_). 'Twould be safest to take him prisoner, my lord!  CHIEF (_nodding_). We'll take him with us to be certain.  GOODWIFE (_hearing this_). Yes, take him! 'Twould serve him right! He burnt my cakes just now!  CHIEF. What! Burnt your cakes?  GOODWIFE. Yes, my lord! And I'd have beaten him had not your lordship come.  CHIEF (_aside to Danes_). This cannot be the king.  FIRST DANE (_shaking head_). No king would fry cakes!  SECOND DANE (_shaking head_). He could not be made to fry them!  THIRD DANE (_shaking head_). Nor take a beating from a woman!  [_The Goodwife has crept up to listen; and so overhears this last remark._]  GOODWIFE. He wouldn't, eh? Ha, ha! Well, I sent him within to mix fresh dough! And I sent him with my stick, I did!  [_Flourishing stick._]  FOURTH DANE. Would you let a woman threaten you with a stick, my lord?  CHIEF (_proudly)._ Never! Besides, King Alfred would be dressed as are his princes and his soldiers. I have thought that from the first. Release the beggar!  [_Danes release King Alfred._]  CHIEF. Now listen, Danes! A hundred silver pieces will I give the man who makes King Alfred prisoner! Hear--all of you!--One hundred silver pieces!  DANES. Aye! Aye!  CHIEF (_to Goodwife and Alfred_). And when this Alfred's taken, to me you'll bend your English knees! To me, you English beggar! Now come, my men! To hunt King Alfred!  DANES (_going_). To hunt King Alfred! To hunt King Alfred!  [_They go. King Alfred smiles. The Goodwife looks after them, listening for a moment._]  GOODWIFE. May they never see a hair of his head!  (_Lifting up arms._)  May Heaven protect and save King Alfred!  KING (_growling_). You seem to love King Alfred--  GOODWIFE. I love the ground he treads on!  KING (_as before_). Of course,--'tis English ground!  GOODWIFE (_shaking head_). Not that--I love the air he breathes!  KING. Well--'tis English air.  GOODWIFE (_sharply)._ No, no! I love the king!--the king himself!  KING (_growling)._ Out upon King Alfred! Out upon him, I say!  GOODWIFE (_angrily)._ You are a traitor, sir!  KING. What has he done for England? He has lost every battle to the Danes! He is running from them now!  GOODWIFE. 'Tis no fault of his! If the king's men were as brave as he, there would not be a Dane on English land to-day!  KING (_still growling_). Well, I'm glad there's one that thinks so well of him!  GOODWIFE. You are a traitor and should be punished!  (_Taking up stick._)  I myself will do it!  [_Lifting stick. Enter the_ PRINCE _and_ ENGLISH SOLDIERS.]  PRINCE (_kneeling_). Your Majesty is safe!  GOOD WIFE (_aside_). What!--Your Majesty, they say!  SOLDIERS (_kneeling, joyfully_). King Alfred! King Alfred!  GOODWIFE (_aside)._ What!--King Alfred!--  KING. Rise, my Prince! Rise, my soldiers! Ah, I'm glad they did not find you!  [_He grasps their hands._]  GOODWIFE (_aside; showing fear_). It is--it is--the king!  KING. We'll fight again, my men! At daybreak we'll surprise them.  SOLDIERS. Aye! Aye!  KING. Goodwife, your king now thanks you.  GOODWIFE (_kneeling_). Oh, your Majesty, forgive me! forgive me!  KING (_gently_). Arise, goodwife.  GOODWIFE (_rising_). Alas the day I made you fry the cakes! Alas the day I would have beaten you!  KING. Nay, goodwife, 'twas that saved my life. I bless the day you made me fry the cakes! I bless the day you would have beaten me! (_Lifting his hand over her head._)  And you I bless, goodwife, for your loyalty to England and her king! Soldiers, salute this brave goodwife!  [_Soldiers form in a double line from door of hut, and hold their bows aloft to make an arch. The Goodwife passes up this lane, under the bows, and stands in door of hut. The King and the Prince salute her._]"]]]
