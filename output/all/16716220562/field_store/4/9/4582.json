If we would awaken religious feeling and link the emotions to God, we must not teach empty lessons, meaningless dates, and musty facts that fail to reach the heart because they have no inner meaning.  Small use to set high aims and then miss them for want of material suited for their attainment. Small use to catalogue the fine qualities of heart and mind we would train in our children and then fail of our aim because we choose wrong tools with which to work. Not all facts found in the Bible are of equal worth to children, nor are all religious truths of equal value. Nothing should be taught _just because it is true_, nor even because it is found in the Bible. The final question is whether this lesson material is the best we can choose for the child himself; whether it will give him the knowledge he can use, train the attitudes he requires, and lead to the acts and conduct that should rule his life.  The material must fit the child.--The subject matter we teach _must also be fitted to the child_. It must be within his grasp and understanding. We do not feed strong meat to babes. What may be the grown person's meat may be to the child poison. It does no good to load the mind with facts it cannot comprehend. There is no virtue in truths, however significant and profound, if they are beyond the reach of the child's experience. Matter which is not assimilated to the understanding is soon forgotten; or if retained, but weighs upon the intellect and dulls its edge for further learning.  There can be little doubt that we have quite constantly in most of our Sunday schools forced upon the child no small amount of matter that is beyond his mental grasp, and so far outside his daily experience that it conveys little or no meaning. We have over-intellectualized the child's religion. Jesus was \"to the Greeks foolishness\" because they had no basis of experience upon which to understand his pure and unselfish life. May not many of the facts, figures, dates, and events from an ancient religion which we give young children likewise be to them but foolishness! May not the lessons upon some of the deepest, finest and most precious concepts in our religion, such as faith, atonement, regeneration, repentance, the Trinity, be lost or worse than lost upon our children because we force them upon unripe minds and hearts at an age when they are not ready for them?  Let us then, _not forget the child_ when we teach religion! Let us not assume that truths and lessons are an end in themselves. Let us constantly ask, as we prepare our lessons, Will this material work as a true leaven in the life? Will it take root and blossom into character, fine thought, and worthy conduct? While our children dumbly ask for living bread let us not give them dead stones and dry husks, which cannot feed their souls! Let us adapt our subject matter to the child.  The use of stress and neglect.--That the lesson material printed in the Sunday school booklets is not always well adapted to the children every teacher knows. But there it is, and what can we do but teach it, though it may sometimes miss the mark?  There is one remedy the wise and skillful teacher always has at his command. By the use of _stress_ and _neglect_ the matter of the lesson may be made to take quite different forms. The points that are too difficult may be omitted or but little emphasized. The matter that best fits the child may be stressed and its application made. Illustrations, stories, and lessons from outside sources may be introduced to suit the aim. Great truths may be restated in terms within childhood's comprehension. The true teacher, like the craftsman, will select now this tool, now that to meet his purpose. Regardless of what the printed lesson offers, he will reject or use, supplement or replace with new material as the needs of his class may demand. The true teacher will be the master, and not the servant, of the subject matter he uses.   HOW SHALL WE ORGANIZE AND PLAN THE LESSONS?  When the _content_ of the subject matter has been decided upon then comes its _organization_. How shall we arrange and plan the material we teach so as to give the children the easiest and most natural mode of approach to its learning?  The great law here is that _the arrangement of subject matter must be psychological_. This only means that we must always ask ourselves how will the child most easily and naturally enter upon the learning of this material? How can I organize it for the recitation so that it will most strongly appeal to his interest? How can I arrange it so that it will be most easily grasped and understood? How can I plan the lesson so that its relation to immediate life and conduct will be most clear and its application most surely made?  The psychological mode of approach.--I recently happened into a junior Sunday school class where the lesson was on faith. The teacher evidently did not know how to plan for a psychological mode of approach to this difficult concept. He began by defining faith in Paul's phrase as \"the substance of things hoped for; the evidence of things not seen.\" He then went to the dictionary definition, which shows the relation of faith to belief. He discussed the relation of faith to works, as presented in the writings of James. But all to no avail. The class was uninterested and inattentive. The lesson did not take hold. The time was wasted and the opportunity lost. I excused myself and went to another classroom.  Here they had the same topic. But the teacher had sought for and found a starting point from which to explain the meaning of faith in terms that the children could understand. The teacher's eye rested for a moment on John; then: \"John, when does your next birthday come?\"  \"The sixteenth of next month,\" replied John promptly.  \"Going to get any presents, do you think?\" asked the teacher.  \"Yes, sir,\" answered John with conviction.  \"What makes you think so?\" inquired the teacher. \"Not everybody does receive birthday presents, you know.\"  \"But I am sure I will,\" persisted John. \"You see, I know my father and mother. They have never yet let one of my birthdays pass without remembering me, and I am sure they are not going to begin to forget me now. They think too much of me.\"  \"You seem to have a good deal of _faith_ in your father and mother,\" remarked the teacher.  \"Well I guess I _have!_\" was John's enthusiastic response.  And right at this point the way was wide open to show John and the class the meaning of faith in a heavenly Father. The wise teacher had found a _point of contact_ in John's faith in the love and care of his parents, and it was but a step from this to the broader and deeper faith in God.  It is a law of human nature that we are all interested first of all in what affects our own lives. Our attention turns most easily to what relates to or grows out of our own experience. The _immediate and the concrete_ are the natural and most effective starting points for our thought. The distant and remote exert little appeal to our interest; it is the near that counts. Especially do these rules hold for children.  Making sure of a point of contact.--All these facts point the way for the teacher in the planning and organization of material for his class. The point of departure must always be sought in some _immediate interest or activity in the life of the child_, and not in some abstract truth or far-away lesson, however precious these may be to the adult Christian. And no lesson is ready for presentation until the way into the child's interest and comprehension has been found. Many a lesson that might have been full of rich spiritual meaning for the child has been lost to our pupils because it was presented out of season, or because the vital connection between the truth and the child's experience was not discovered by the teacher.  This principle suggests that in the main children should not be taught religious truths in terms which they cannot grasp, nor in such a way that the application to their own lives is not clear. For example, the vital truths contained in the church catechisms are not for children; the statement of them is too abstract and difficult, and the meaning too remote from the child's experience. Many of the same truths can be presented to children in the form of stories or illustrations; other of the truths may rest until the child becomes older before claiming his attention. Bible verses and sentiments completely outside the child's comprehension are not good material for memorizing. Lessons upon the more difficult concepts and deeper problems of religion belong to the adult age, and should not be forced upon children.  Our guiding principle, therefore, is to _keep close to the mind, heart, and daily life of childhood._ Then _adapt the subject matter we teach to the mind, interests, and needs of those we teach._ Definitions, rules, abstract statements, general truths have little or no value with children. It is the story, the concrete incident, the direct application growing out of their own experiences that takes hold.   PRESENTING THE LESSON--INSTRUCTION  After the aim has been clearly conceived, and after the lesson material has been wisely chosen and properly organized, there still remains the most important part--that of \"getting the lesson across\" to the class. Many a valuable lesson, full of helpfulness, has been lost to the pupils because the teacher lacked the power to bring his class to the right pitch for receiving and retaining impressions. Many a class period has been wasted because the teacher failed to present the material of the lesson so that it gripped interest and compelled attention.  Response a test of instruction.--The _first_ test of good instruction is the _response of the class_. Are the children alert? Are they keen for discussion, or for listening to stories told or applications made? Do they think? Do they enjoy the lesson hour, and give themselves happily and whole-h"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15800"],["title","How to Teach Religion (#8)"],["body","to it? Is their conduct good, and their attitude serious, reverent, and attentive? Are they all \"in the game,\" or are there laggards, inattentive ones, and mischief-makers?  These questions are all crucial. For the first law of all learning is _self-activity_. There is no possibility of teaching a child who is not mentally awake. Only the active mind grasps, assimilates, remembers, applies. The birth of new ideas, the reaching of convictions, the arriving at decisions all come in moments of mental stress and tension. Lethargy of thought and feeling is fatal to all classroom achievement. Therefore, no matter how keenly alert the teacher's mind may be, no matter how skillful his analysis of an important truth may be if his class sit with flagging interest and lax attention.  Results a test of instruction.--The _second_ test of good instruction is our skill in handling the material of the lesson, and _shaping the trend of thought and discussion_. Are the children interested in the right things? Are the central truths of the lesson being brought out and applied? Is the discussion centered on topics set for our consideration, or does it degenerate into aimless talk on matters of personal or local interest which have no relation to the lesson? In short, does the recitation period yield the _fruitful knowledge_ we had set as a goal for this lesson? Does it stimulate the _attitudes_ and motives we had meant to reach? Does it lead to the _applications_ in life and conduct which were intended? _Does it get results?_  The four points of this lesson are of supreme importance in teaching religion. The _aim_ must be clear, definite, and possible of attainment. The _subject matter_ of instruction must be wisely selected as an instrument for reaching the aim set forth. The _organization_ of this material must adapt it to the mind and needs of the child. The _presentation_ of the lesson material in the recitation must be such that its full effect is brought to bear upon the mind and heart of those we teach.  Each of these four points will be further elaborated in the chapters which follow. In fact, the remainder of the text is chiefly a working out and applying of these fundamental principles to the teaching of religion.       1. To what extent would you say you have been directing your      teaching toward a definite aim? Just how does the problem of this      chapter relate itself to the preceding chapter on the \"Great      Objective\"?       2. Do you think the majority of those who have come up through the      church school possess as full and definite a knowledge of the Bible      and the fundamentals of religion as we have a right to expect? If      not, where is the trouble and what the remedy?       3. Have you been consciously emphasizing the creation of right      attitudes as one of the chief outcomes of your teaching? Do you      judge that you are as successful in the developing of religious      attitudes as in imparting information? If not, can you find a      remedy?       4. To what extent do you think your instruction is actually      carrying over into the immediate life and conduct of your class in      their home, school, etc.? If not to so great an extent as you could      wish, are you willing to make this one of the great aims of your      teaching from this time on, seeking earnestly throughout this text      and in other ways to learn how this may be done?       5. Do you on the whole feel that the subject matter you are      teaching your pupils is adapted to the aims you seek to reach in      their lives? If not, how can you supplement and change to make it      more effective? Have you a broad enough knowledge of such material      yourself so that you can select material from other sources for      them?       6. To what extent do you definitely plan each lesson for the      particular children you teach so as to make it most accessible to      their interest and grasp? Do you plan each lesson to secure a      psychological mode of approach? How do you know when you have a      psychological approach?

CHAPTER IV  RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF MOST WORTH   The child comes into the world devoid of all knowledge and understanding. His mind, though at the beginning a blank, is a potential seedbed in which we may plant what teachings we will. The babe born into our home to-day can with equal ease be made into a Christian, a Buddhist, or a Mohammedan. He brings with him the instinct to respond to the appeal religion makes to his life, but the kind and quality of his religion will depend largely on the religious atmosphere he breathes and the religious ideas and concepts placed in his mind through instruction and training.  What, then, shall we teach our children, in religion? If fruitful knowledge is to be one of the chief aims of our teaching, _what_ knowledge shall we call fruitful? What are the great foundations on which a Christian life must rest? Years ago Spencer wrote a brilliant essay on _knowledge of most worth_ in the field of general education. What knowledge is of most worth in the field of religious education? For not all knowledge, as we have seen, is of equal value. Some religious knowledge is fruitful because it _can be set at work_ to shape our attitudes and guide our acts; other religious knowledge is relatively fruitless because it _finds no point of contact_ with experience.  To answer our question we must therefore ask: \"What knowledge will serve to guide the child's foot-steps aright from day to day as he passes through his childhood? What truths will even now, while he is still a child, awaken his spiritual appreciation and touch the springs of his emotional response to the heavenly Father? What religious concepts, once developed, will lead the youth into a rich fullness of personal experience and develop in him the will and capacity to serve others? What religious knowledge will finally make most certain a life of loyalty to the church and the great cause for which it stands?\" When we can answer these questions we shall then be able to say what knowledge is of most worth in the religious training of our children.   THE CHILD'S CONCEPT OF GOD  The child must come to know about God, even as a little child. Long before he can understand about _religion_, he can learn about a heavenly Father. This does not imply that the child (or that we ourselves!) can know God in any full or complete way. Indeed, a God who could be known in his entirety by even the deepest and wisest finite mind would be no God at all. Yet everyone must give some meaning to God. Everyone does have some more or less definite idea, image, or mental picture of the God he thinks about, prays to, and worships.  The child's idea of God develops gradually.--We need not be concerned that God does not mean the same to the child with his mental limitations that he means to us. Meaning comes only out of experience, and this will grow. The great thing is that the child's fundamental concept of God shall start right, that in so far as it goes it shall be essentially true, and that it shall be clear and definite enough to guide his actions. More than this we cannot ask for; less than this does not give the child a God real enough to be a vital factor and an active force in his life.  It is to be expected, then, that the child's earliest concepts of God will be faulty and incomplete, and that in many points they will later need correction. Probably most children first think of God as having human form and attributes; the idea of spirit is beyond their grasp. God is to them a kind of magnified and glorified Father after the type of their earthly father. This need not concern us if we make sure that the crude beginnings of the God-idea have no disturbing elements in them, and that as the concept grows it moves in the right direction.  The harm from false concepts.--Mr. H.G. Wells[2] bitterly complains against the wrong concept of God that was allowed to grow in his mind as a child. These are his words: \"He and his hell were the nightmare of my childhood.... I thought of him as a fantastic monster perpetually waiting to condemn and to strike me dead!... He was over me and about my silliness and forgetfulness as the sky and sea would be about a child drowning in mid-Atlantic.\" It was only as the child grew into youth, and was able to discard this false idea of God that he came to feel right toward him.  [2] God the Invisible King, p. 44.  The harm done a child by false and disturbing concepts of God is hard to estimate. A small boy recently came home from Sunday school and confided to his mother that he \"didn't think it was fair for God to spy on a fellow!\" A sympathetic inquiry by the mother revealed the fact that the impression brought from the lesson hour was of God keeping a lookout for our wrongdoings and sins, and constantly making a record of them against us, as an unsympathetic teacher might in school. The beneficent and watchful oversight and care of God had not entered into the concept.  It is clear that with this wrong understanding of God's relation to him the child's attitude and the response of his heart toward God could not be right. The lesson hour which left so false an impression of God in the child's mind did him lasting injury instead of good.  How wrong concepts may arise.--Pierre Loti tells in his reminiscences of his own child-life how he went out into the back yard and threw stones at God because it had rained and spoiled the picnic day. In his teaching, God had been made responsible for the weather, and the boy had come to look upon prayer as a means of getting what he wanted from God. It took many years of experience to rid the child's mind of the last vestiges of these false ideas. The writer recalls a troublesome idea of God that"]]]
