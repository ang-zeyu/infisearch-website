For the present you must be satisfied so, and there is nothing more to be said.\"  \"I shall see you again, I trust,\" I pleaded, as she rose to leave me.  \"If you wish, by all means. Why should we not dine together in the dining-car by and by?\" she proposed with charming frankness, in the lighter mood that sat so well upon her. \"The waiters will be there to play propriety, and no Mrs. Grundy within miles.\"  \"Or your maid might be chaperon at an adjoining table.\"  \"Philpotts? Impossible! She cannot leave--she must remain on duty; one of us must be in charge always. Who knows what might happen when our backs were turned? We might lose it--it might be abstracted. Horrible thought after all it has cost us.\"  \"'It' has evidently an extraordinary value in your eyes. If only I might be allowed to--\" know more, I would have said, but she chose to put other words into my mouth.  \"To join us in the watching? Take your turn of 'sentry go'--isn't that your military term? Become one of us, belong to a gang of thieves, liable like the rest of us to the law? Ah, that would be trying you too far. I see your face fall.\"  \"I am ready to do much to serve you. I would gladly help you, see you through any difficulty by the way, but I'm afraid I must draw the line at active partnership,\" I answered a little lamely under her mocking eyes. Once more, as suddenly as before, she veered round.  \"There is a limit, then, to your devotion?\" She was coldly sarcastic now, and I realized painfully that I had receded in her favour. \"I must not expect unhesitating self-sacrifice? So be it; it is well to know how far I may go. I sincerely hope I may have no need of you at all. How thankful I am that I never let you into my secrets! Good afternoon,\" and with a contemptuous whisk of her skirts and a laugh, she was gone.  \"I'll have nothing more to say to her,\" I cried in great heat, vexed and irritated beyond measure at her capricious temper. I should only be dragged into some pitfall, some snare, some dire unpleasantness. But what did I know of her real character? What of my first doubts and suspicions? She had by no means dispelled them. She had only bamboozled me by her insinuating ways, had drawn me on by her guileful cleverness to pity and promises to befriend her. I had accorded her an active sympathy which in my more sober moments I felt she did not, could not, deserve; if I were not careful she would yet involve me in some inextricable mess.  So for half an hour I abused her fiercely; I swore at myself hotly as an ass, a hopeless and unmitigated ass, ever ready to be betrayed and beguiled by woman's wiles, the too easy victim of the first pretty face I saw. The fit lasted for quite half an hour, and then came the reaction. I heard her rich deep voice singing in my ears, I felt the haunting glamour of her eyes, remembered her gracious presence, and my heart went out to her. I was so sorry for her: how could I cast her off? How could I withhold my countenance if she were in real distress? She was a woman--a weak, helpless woman; I could not desert and abandon her. However reprehensible her conduct might have been, she had a claim to my protection from ill-usage, and I knew in my heart that she might count upon a good deal more. I knew, of course, that I ought not to stand between her and the inevitable Nemesis that awaits upon misdeeds, but what if I helped her to avoid or escape it?  The opportunity was nearer at hand than I thought. My kindly intentions, bred of my latest sentiments towards Mrs. Blair, were soon to be put to the test.     CHAPTER V.   The train reached Amiens punctually at 5 P.M., and a stoppage of five minutes was announced. I got out to stretch my legs on the platform. No one took much notice of us; it must have been known that the train was empty, for there were no waiters from the buffet with _caf√© au lait_ or fruit, or _brioches_--no porters about, or other officials.  I had not expected to see any passengers come on board the train, a through express, made up of sleeping-cars and a supplementary charge on the tickets. But on running into the station (ours was the first carriage) I had noticed a man standing with a valise in his hand, and I saw him following the train down the platform when we stopped. He addressed himself to a little group of conductors who had already alighted, and were gossiping idly among themselves, having nothing else to do. One of them indicated our particular attendant, to whom he spoke, and who brought him directly to our carriage.  Evidently the newcomer was bound for Lucerne _via_ Basle. Here was one more occupant of our neglected train, another companion and fellow traveller in our nearly empty sleeping-car. Curiosity and something more led me to examine this man closely; it was a strange, undefined, inexplicable sense of foreboding, of fateful forecast, that he and I were destined to be thrown together unpleasantly, to be much mixed up with one another, and to the comfort and satisfaction of neither.  Who and what was he? His position in life, his business, trade or calling were not to be easily fixed; a commercial man, an agent or \"traveller\" on his own account, well-to-do and prosperous, was the notion borne out by his dress, his white waistcoat and coloured shirt of amazing pattern (a hint of his Italian origin), his rings and the showy diamond pin in his smart necktie.  I added to this, my first impression, by further observation, for which I soon had abundant opportunity. When the train moved on, he came and took his seat on the flap seat (or _strapontin_) just opposite my compartment. I could not tell why, until presently he made overtures of sociability and began a desultory talk across the corridor. My cabin or compartment, it will be remembered, was the last but one; the newcomer had been given the one behind mine, and here from his seat he commanded the whole length of the carriage forward, which included the compartment occupied by Mrs. Blair and her party.  I cannot say that I liked his looks or was greatly attracted by him. He was not prepossessing. Fair, with a flaccid unwholesome complexion, foxy haired, his beard cut to a point, small moustaches curled upward showing thin pale lips, and giving his mouth a disagreeable curve also upwards, a sort of set smile that was really a sardonic sneer, conveying distrust and disbelief in all around. His eyes were so deep set as to be almost lost in their recesses behind his sandy eyelashes, and he kept them screwed up close, with the intent watchful gaze of an animal about to make a spring. His whole aspect, his shifty, restless manner, his furtive looks, all were antipathetic and to his great advantage. I did not take to him at all, and plainly showed him that I had no desire for his talk or his company.  It was not easy to shake him off, however. He would take no offence; I was cold to positive rudeness, I snubbed him unmercifully; I did not answer his remarks or his questions, which were incessant and shamelessly inquisitorial. Nothing disconcerted him. I had all but shut the door of my compartment in his face, but it suddenly occurred to me that he was capable of wandering on, and when he found the ladies inflicting his greasy attentions upon them.  I felt that I had better submit to his unpalatable society than let him bore Mrs. Blair with his colossal impudence.  How right I was in this became at once apparent. He had taken out a cigar-case and pressed one upon me with such pertinacious, offensive familiarity that I could see no way out of it than by saying peremptorily:  \"You cannot smoke here. There are ladies in that compartment yonder.\"  \"Ladies indeed! You surprise me,\" but I saw a look on his face that convinced me he perfectly well knew they were there. \"Ladies, aha! How many, may I ask?\"  \"One at least, with her maid and a child,\" I replied gruffly.  \"And a child,\" he repeated, as if by rote. \"Does monsieur, tell me quickly, I--I--beg--know them! Can he describe them to me?\"  \"I shall tell you nothing about them. What the mischief do you mean by asking me questions? Find out what you want for yourself.\" I was hot and indignant with the brute.  \"By George, you're right. I'll go and ask for leave to smoke. I shall find out then,\" and he jumped up, the spring seat closing with a bang from under him.  The noise concealed the sound of the electric bell which I had pressed to summon the attendant, as I rushed out and caught the other man by the arm.  \"You'll do nothing of the kind,\" I cried with very vigorous emphasis, backed by all my strength. \"I'll shake you to a jelly if you dare to move another inch.\"  \"Here, I say, drop it. Who the deuce are you? None of your bally nonsense. Hands off, or I'll make you.\"  But he was too soft and flabby to avail much, and I dragged him back helplessly with tightened grip, only too delighted to try conclusions with him.  At this moment the conductor appeared upon the scene, and began to expostulate loudly.  \"Here, I say, what's all this? It can't be allowed. No fighting and quarrelling are permitted.\"  \"Well, then, people must behave themselves,\" I retorted. \"Don't let this chap annoy your passengers.\"  \"I have done nothing to annoy them,\" stammered the other. \"You shall answer for this. I've done no harm.\"  \"I'll see you don't. Get in there and stay there;\" and with that I forced him, almost flung him, into his compartment, where he fell panting upon the velvet sofa.  \"You'd better keep an eye on him,\" I said to the conductor, who was inclined to be disagreeable, and was barely pacified by a couple of five-franc pieces. \"Fellows of this sort are apt to be a nuisance, and we must take care of the ladies.\"  As I said this I saw Mrs. Blair's face peering out beyond her door a little nervously, but she ventured to come right out and along the passage towards me.  \"What has happened? I heard some noise, high words, a scuffle.\"  \"Some ruffian who got in at Amiens, and who has had to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16339"],["title","The Passenger from Calais (#4)"],["body","taught manners. I told him not to smoke here, and he wanted to intrude himself upon you, which I prevented, a little forcibly.\"  \"Where is he? In here?\" and she followed the indication of my thumb as I jerked it back, and looked over my shoulder into the compartment.  \"Ah!\" The ejaculation was involuntary, and one of acute painful surprise, the gesture that accompanied it spontaneous and full of terror.  \"That man! that man!\" she gasped. \"He must not see me; let me go, let me go!\"  But her strength failed her, and but for my supporting arm she would have fallen to the ground. Half-fainting, I led her back to her own compartment, where her maid received her tenderly and with comforting words. There was clearly a strong bond of affection between these two, possibly companions and confederates in wrong-doing; the delicate and refined woman, tormented by the inner qualms of outraged conscience, relied and leant upon the stronger and more resolute nature.  \"What's come to you, ma'am? There, there, don't give way,\" said the maid, softly coaxing her and stroking her hands.  \"Oh, Philpotts, fancy! He is there! Falfani, the--the--you know--\"  Of course I saw it all now. Stupid ass! I might have guessed it all along. I had puzzled my brains vainly trying to place him, to fix his quality and condition in life, neglecting the one simple obvious solution to which so many plain indications pointed. The man, of course, was a detective, an officer or private agent, and his dirty business--you see, I was already shaken in my honesty, and now with increasing demoralization under seductive influences I was already inclined to cross over to the other side of the frontier of crime--his dirty business was the persecution of my sweet friend.  \"What are we to do now?\" asked Mrs. Blair, her nervous trepidation increasing. \"I begin to think we shall fail, we cannot carry it through, we shall lose our treasure. It will be taken from us.\"  \"You cannot, you must not, shall not turn back now,\" said the maid with great determination. \"We must devise something, some way, of outwitting this Falfani. We did it before, we must do it again. After all he has no power over us; we are in France and shall be in Switzerland by daylight.\"  \"We ought to go on, you think? Wouldn't it be better to slip out of the train at the first station and run away?\"  \"He would do the same. He does not intend to let us out of his sight. And how much the better should we be? It would be far worse; we should be much more at his mercy if we left the train. The journey would still have to be made; we must get to the end, the very end, or we'd better not have started.\"  \"He will know then, if he sticks to us. We cannot hide it from him, nor where we have taken it; we shall never be able to keep it, they will come and claim it and recover it;\" and she cried hysterically: \"I cannot see my way; it's all dark, black as night. I wish--I wish--\"  \"That you had never done it?\" quickly asked the maid; and I noticed a slight sarcasm in her tone that was not without its effect in bracing up and strengthening her companion's shattered nerves.  \"No, no, no; I do not regret it, and I never shall. I did it deliberately, counting the cost fully, and it shall be paid, however heavy it may be. It is not regret that tortures me, but the fear of failure when so near success.\"  \"We will succeed yet. Do not be cast down, my sweet dear.\" The maid patted her on the cheek with great affection. \"We shall find a way. This gentleman, the colonel here, will help us, perhaps.\"  \"Will you?\" Who could resist her pleading voice and shining eyes? If I had had any scruples left I would have thrown them to the winds.  \"Whatever lies in my power to do shall be done without stint or hesitation,\" I said solemnly, careless of all consequences, content to hold her hand and earn her heartfelt thanks. What though I were pawning my honour?     CHAPTER VI.  [_The Statement of Domenico Falfani, confidential agent, made to his employers, Messrs. Becke and Co., of the Private Inquiry Offices, 279 St. Martin's Lane, W.C._]   I propose, gentlemen, to set down here at length the story of my mission, and the events which befell me from the time I first received my instructions. You desired me to pursue and call to strict account a certain lady of title, who had fallen away from her high estate and committed an act of rank felony. The circumstances which led up to her disappearance and the partners of her flight are already well known to you.  The only indication given me, as you are aware, was that I might take it for granted that she would go abroad and probably by the most direct route to the South, to Switzerland and across the Alps into Italy. My orders having only reached me in the early morning, the theft having presumably been committed during the night previous to Sunday, September 21, I was unable to ascertain through the tourist agencies whether any and what tickets had been booked in the directions indicated.  My most urgent duty then was to watch the outgoing Continental trains, the first of which left Charing Cross for Dover and Calais at 9 A.M. I closely watched it therefore, and its passengers, and travelled with it to Cannon Street, where I continued my search, but without result. I was greatly helped in my quest by the not unusual fact noticeable on Sundays, that travellers abroad are few in number.  I had no difficulty in satisfying myself that the lady and her party were not in this train, and I returned at once to Charing Cross in time for the second Continental train, the 10 A.M.  I had resolved to book myself by that as far as Amiens, for I knew that, once there, I should have reached a central point or junction, a sort of throat through which every train moving southward to Paris or Switzerland must pass.  There remained, of course, the route via Dover by Ostend and through Brussels; but I had been informed by you that Ludovic Tiler, my colleague and coworker, was to undertake the inquiry on that line.  It is part of my business to be thoroughly familiar with the Continental Bradshaw, and I soon ticked off the different trains that interested me.  There was first the 11 A.M. from Victoria by Dover and Calais, where it connected with the Paris express and the sleeping-car Engadine express, both of which run through Amiens, where, however, the latter branches off to Basle and beyond, with special cars for Lucerne, Zurich and Coire.  Then came the 2.20 P.M. from Charing Cross to Folkestone, and so to Boulogne, Amiens and the rest, travelling the same road as the Engadine express. This was the last of the day service, as it gave most time, allowing people to start at the very latest moment, and I felt it quite probable that my lady would prefer to take it.  I reached Amiens a little before 5 P.M., and I had a wait of half an hour for the first express from Calais. I was greatly disappointed when at last it appeared issuing from the tunnel, and passed me where I stood at the commencement of the platform, taking stock of each carriage as it passed. The train seemed to be quite empty; there were no passengers, so the officials, the conductors, informed me when I talked to them, sad and unhappy at the certain loss of tips. Only one of them had any luck, Jules l'Echelle, of the Lucerne sleeping-car, who had one or two people on board.  I questioned him not very hopefully, but was agreeably surprised when he told me that his clients consisted of two ladies with a child, and one gentleman. English? Yes, all English. The lady, quite a lady, a _grande dame belle personne_, tall, fine figure, well dressed; her companion no doubt her servant; the child, well, an ordinary child, an infant in arms. What would you?  I had them, I felt sure. There could be no mistaking this description. I held them in the hollow of my hand. Here they were in this car, and it would be all my own fault if they escaped me. It would be necessary only to verify my conclusions, to identify the lady according to the description and photograph given me. For the rest I knew what to do.  But now a quite unexpected difficulty turned up.  As I have said, there was one other passenger, a gentleman, in the car, and I felt it would be prudent to make his acquaintance. No doubt I could tell at the first glance whether or not he was an ordinary traveller, or whether he was a friend and accomplice of the lady under observation.  I regret to say that he met me in a very hostile spirit. I was at great pains to be affable, to treat him with all the courtly consideration I have at command, and I flatter myself that in the matter of tact and good-breeding I do not yield to princes of the blood royal. But my civility was quite thrown away. The man was an absolute brute, abrupt, overbearing, rude. Nothing would conciliate him. I offered him a cigar (a Borneo of the best brand, at 10s. the hundred), and he not only refused it, but positively forbade me to smoke. There were ladies in the carriage, he said (this was the first reference made to them), and, when declining to be ordered about, I proposed to refer the question to themselves, he threw himself violently upon me and assaulted me brutally.  Fortunately the attendant came to my rescue or I should have been seriously injured. He lifted me into my compartment very kindly, and acted like an old friend, as indeed he was, for I remembered him as the Jules l'Echelle with whom I served some time back as an assistant at the Baths of Bormio.  It was, of course, clear to my mind that my assailant was associated in some way with the lady, and probably a confederate. I saw that I must know more about him, with the least possible delay, and as soon as Jules had left me, promising to return later and talk of old times, and the changes that had come over us since then, I ventured to look out and get a glimpse of the other man, I will not call him gentleman after his conduct.  He was nowhere in sight, but I could"]]]
