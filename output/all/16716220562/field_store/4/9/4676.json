When you have crouched like that for months, to stand Straight up and look right out toward No-Man's-Land And feel the way you never thought you could.  We saw the trenches on the other side And Jerry, too, not making any fuss, But prob'ly stupid-happy, just like us. Nobody shot and no one tried to hide.  If you had listened then I guess you'd heard A sort of sigh from everybody there, But all we did was stand and stare and stare, Just stare and stand and never say a word."]]]
