It was worth the fun. We 'ad some picnic stoushin' Brother 'Un--   The only fight I've 'ad that some John 'Op                         Don't come an' stop. They pulled me leg a treat, but, all the same, There's nothin' over 'ere to beat the game.  \"An' now,\" 'e sez, \"I'm 'ere to do a job I promised, if it was me luck to lob   Back 'ome before me mate,\" 'e sez, an' then,                               'E grins again. \"As clear as mud,\" I sez. \"But I can't work Me brains to 'old yer pace.  Say, wot's the lurk?\"  So then 'e puts me wise. It seems that 'im An' this 'ere Flood--I tips it must be Jim--   Was cobbers up in France, an' things occurred.                                (I got 'is word Things did occur up there). But, anyway, Seems Flood done somethin' good for 'im one day.  Then Smith 'e promised if 'e came back 'ome Before 'is cobber o'er the flamin' foam,  'E'd see the ole folks 'ere, an' 'e agreed,                           If there was need, 'E'd stay an' do a bit around the farm So long as 'e 'ad one sound, dinkum arm.  \"So, 'ere I am,\" 'e sez, an' grins again. \"A promise is a promise 'mong us men.\"   Sez I, \"You come along up to the 'ouse.                     Ole Dad won't rouse When once 'e's got yer strength, an' as for Mar, She'll kiss yeh when she finds out 'oo yeh are.\"  So we goes up, an' finds 'em both fair dazed About this little Smith; they think 'e's crazed.  I tells the tale in words they understand;                         Then it was grand To see Dad grab Smith's 'and an' pump it good, An' Mar, she kissed 'im, like I said she would.  Mar sez 'e must be starved, an' right away The kettle's on, she's busy with a tray.  An', when I left, this Digger Smith 'e looked                            Like 'e was booked For keeps, with tea an' bread an' beef inside. \"Our little Willie's 'ome,\" 'e grins, \"an' dried.\"     V. WEST   West  \"I'VE seen so much uv dirt an' grime   I'm mad to 'ave things clean. I've seen so much uv death,\" 'e said-- \"So many cobbers lyin' dead--   You won't know wot I mean; But, lad, I've 'ad so much uv strife I want things straightened in my life.  \"I've seen so much uv 'ate,\" 'e said--  \"Mad 'ate an' silly rage-- I'm yearnin' for clear thoughts,\" said 'e. \"Kindness an' love seem good to me.   I want a new, white page To start all over, clean an' good, An' live me life as reel men should.\"  We're sittin' talkin' by the fence,   The sun's jist goin' down, Paintin' the sky all gold an' pink. Said 'e, \"When it's like that, I think--\"   An' then 'e stops to frown. Said 'e, \"I think, when it's jist so, Uv . . . . God or somethin': I dunno.  \"I ain't seen much uv God,\" said 'e;  \"Not 'ere nor Over There; But, partly wot I've seen an' read, An' partly wot the padre said,   It gits me when I stare Out West when it's like that is now. There must be somethin' else--some'ow.  \"I've thought a lot,\" said Digger Smith--   \"Out There I thought a lot. I thought uv death, an' all the rest, An' uv me mates, good mates gone West;   An' it ain't much I've got; But things get movin' in me 'ead When I look over there,\" 'e said.  'E's got me beat, 'as little Smith.   I knoo 'im years ago I knoo 'im as a reel tough boy 'Oo roughed it up with 'oly joy;   But now, well, I dunno. An' when I ask Mar Flood she sighs-- An' sez 'e's got the Anzac eyes.  She sez 'e's got them soldier's eyes   That makes 'er own eyes wet. An' we must give 'im wholesome food An' lead 'is thoughts to somethin' good   An' never let 'im fret. But 'e ain't frettin', seems to me; More--puzzled, fur as I can see.  The clouds above the hills was tore   Apart, until, some'ow, It seemed like some big, shinin' gate. Said 'e, \"Why, lad, I tell yeh straight,   I feel like startin' now, An' walkin' on, an' on, an' thro', Dead game an'--Ain't it so to you?  \"I've seen enough uv pain,\" 'e said,  \"An' cursin', killin' 'ordes. I ain't the man to smooge with God To get to 'Eaven on the nod,   Or 'owl 'ymns for rewards. But this believin'?  Why--Oh, 'Struth This never 'it me in me youth.  \"They talk uv love 'twixt men,\" said 'e.   \"That sounds dead crook to you. But lately I 'ave come to see.\" . . . \"'Old on,\" I said; \"it seems to me   There's love uv women too. An you?\" 'E turns away 'is 'ead. \"I'm only 'arf a man,\" 'e said.  \"I've seen so much uv death,\" said 'e,   \"Me mind is in a whirl. I've 'ad so many thoughts uv late.\" . . . Said I, \"Now, tell me, tell me straight;   Own up; ain't there a girl?\" Said 'e, \"I've done the best I can. Wot does she want with 'arf a man?\"  It weren't no use. 'E wouldn't talk   Uv nothin' but that sky. Said 'e, \"Now, dinkum, talkin' square, When you git gazin' over there   Don't you 'arf want to cry? I wouldn't be su'prised to see An angel comin' out,\" said 'e.  \"Gone West!\" said Digger Smith. \"Ah, lad,   I've seen 'em goin' West, An' often wonder, when I look, If they 'ave 'ad it dealt 'em crook,   Or if they've got the rest They earned twice over by the spell They spent down in that dinkum 'Ell.\"  The gold was creepin' up, the sun   Was 'arf be'ind the range. It don't seem strange a man should cry To see that glory in the sky   To me it don't seem strange. \"Digger!\" said 'e. \"Look at it now! There must be somethin' else--some'ow.\"     VI. OVER THE FENCE   Over the Fence  'TAINT my idea uv argument to call a man a fool, An' I ain't lookin' round for bricks to 'eave at ole man Poole;   But when 'e gets disputin' 'e's inclined to lose 'is 'ead.   It ain't so much 'is choice uv words as 'ow the words is said.  'E's sich a coot for takin' sides, as I sez to Doreen. Sez she, \"'Ow can 'e, by 'imself ?\"  Wotever that may mean.   My wife sez little things sometimes that nearly git me riled.   I knoo she meant more than she said be that soft way she smiled.  To-day, when I was 'arrowin', Poole comes down to the fence To get the loan uv my long spade; an' uses that pretence   To 'ave a bit uv friendly talk, an' one word leads to more,   As is the way with ole man Poole, as I've remarked before.  The spade reminds 'im 'ow 'e done some diggin' in 'is day, An' diggin' brings the talk to earth, an' earth leads on to clay,   Then clay quite natural reminds a thinkin' bloke uv bricks,   An' mortar brings up mud, an' then, uv course, it's politics.  Now, Poole sticks be 'is Party, an' I don't deny 'is right; But when 'e starts abusin' mine 'e's lookin' for a fight.   So I delivers good 'ome truths about 'is crowd; then Poole   Wags 'is ole beard across the fence an' tells me I'm a fool.  Now, that's the dizzy limit; so I lays aside the reins, An' starts to prove 'e's storin' mud where most blokes keeps        their brains.  'E decorates 'is answers, an' we're goin' it ding-dong,   When this returned bloke, Digger Smith, comes sauntering along.  Poole's gripped the fence as though 'e means to tear the rails      in two, An' eyes my waggin' finger like 'e wants to 'ave a chew.   Then Digger Smith 'e grins at Poole, an' then 'e looks at me,   An' sez, quite soft an' friendly-like, \"Winnin' the war?\" sez 'e.  Now, Poole deserves it, an' I'm pleased the lad give 'im that jolt. 'E goes fair mad in argument when once 'e gets a holt.  \"Yeh make me sad,\" sez Digger Smith; \"the both uv you,\" sez 'e.  \"The both uv us!  Gawstruth!\" sez I.  \"You ain't includin' me?\"  \"Well, it takes two to make a row,\" sez little Digger Smith. \"A bloke can't argue 'less 'e 'as a bloke to argue with.   I've come 'ome from a dinkum scrap to find this land uv light   Is chasin' its own tail around an' callin' it a fight.  \"We've seen a thing or two, us blokes 'oo've fought on many fronts; An' we've 'ad time to think a bit between the fightin' stunts.   We've seen big things, an' thought big things, an' all the        silly fuss,   That used to get us rattled once, seems very small to us.  \"An' when a bloke's fought for a land an' gets laid on the shelf It pains 'im to come 'ome an' find it scrappin' with itself;   An' scrappin' all for nothin', or for things that look so       small--   To us, 'oo've been in bigger things, they don't seem reel at all.  \"P'r'aps we 'ave 'ad some skite knocked out, an' p'r'aps we see      more clear, But seems to us there's plenty cleanin'-up to do round 'ere.   We've learnt a little thing or two, an' we 'ave unlearnt 'eaps,   An' silly partisans, with us, is counted out for keeps.  \"This takin' sides jist for the sake uv takin' sides--Aw, 'Struth! I used to do them things one time, back in me foolish youth.   Out There, when I remembered things, I've kicked meself reel good.   In football days I barracked once red 'ot for Collin'wood.  \"I didn't want to see a game, nor see no justice done. It never mattered wot occurred as long as my side won.   The other side was narks an' cows an' rotters to a man;   But mine was all reel bonzer chaps.  I was a partisan.  \"It might sound like swelled-'ead,\" sez Smith.  \"But show me, if yeh can....\" \"'Old 'ard,\" sez Poole. \"Jist tell me this: wot is a partisan?\"   Then Digger Smith starts to ixplain; Poole interrupts straight out;   An' I wades in to give my views, an' 'as to nearly shout.  We battles on for one good hour. My team sleeps where it stands; An' Poole 'as tossed the spade away to talk with both 'is 'ands;   An' Smith 'as dropped the maul 'e 'ad. Then I looks round to see   Doreen quite close. She smiles at us. \"Winnin' the war?\" sez she.     VII. A DIGGER'S TALE   A Digger's Tale  MY oath!' the Duchess sez. 'You'd not ixpect   Sich things as that. Yeh don't mean kangaroos? Go hon!' she sez, or words to that effect--   (It's 'ard to imitate the speech they use) I tells 'er, 'Straight; I drives 'em four-in-'and                                   'Ome in my land.'  \"You 'ear a lot,\" sez little Digger Smith,   \"About 'ow English swells is so stand-off. Don't yeh believe it; it's a silly myth.

I tells 'er, out at Richmond, on me Run-- A little place uv ten square mile or so--   I'm breedin' boomerangs; which is reel fun, When I ain't troubled by the wild Jonops                       That eats me crops.  \"I talks about the wondrous Boshter Bird   That builds 'er nest up in the Cobber Tree, An' 'atches out 'er young on May the third,   Stric' to the minute, jist at 'arf pas' three.

JIM'S GIRL    Jim's Girl   \"'Oo is that girl,\" sez Digger Smith, \"That never seems to bother with   No blokes: the bint with curly 'air?   I've often seen 'er over there Talkin' to Missus Flood, an' she Seems like a reel ripe peach to me.  \"Not that I'm askin'\" . . . 'Ere 'is eyes Goes sort uv swiv'ly, an' 'e sighs.   \"Not that I'm askin' with idears   Uv love an' marridge; 'ave no fears. I've chucked the matrimony plan,\" 'E sez. \"I'm only 'arf a man.\"  This Digger Smith 'as fairly got Me rampin' with 'is \"'arf man\" rot.  'E 'as a timber leg, it's true;   But 'e can do the work uv two. Besides, the things 'e's done Out There Makes 'im one man an' some to spare.  I knoo 'is question was jist kid. 'E'd met this girl; I know 'e did.   'E knoo Jim Flood an' 'er was booked   For double when the 'Un was cooked. But, seein' 'er, it used to start 'Im thinkin' uv another tart.  \"Oh, 'er?\" sez I.  \"She is a pearl. I've 'eard she used to be Jim's girl;   But she was jist a child when Jim   Got out. She 'as forgotten 'im.\" I knows jist wot was in 'is mind, An' sez, \"Wade in, if you're inclined.\"  'E give me sich a narsty look I thought 'e meant to answer crook;   But, \"I ain't out for jokes,\" sez 'e   \"Yeh needn't sling that stuff to me. I only was jist thinkin'--p'r'aps . . . . . There's some,\" 'e sez, \"that sticks to chaps.  \"Some girls,\" sez 'e, \"keeps true to chaps, An' wed 'em when they've done with scraps,   An' come 'ome whole. Yeh don't ixpec'   No tart to tie up to a wreck? Besides,\" 'e sez. . . .  \"Well, any'ow, That girl's all right; I know it now.  \"I know,\" sez Smith. \"I got it right. Jim used to talk to me at night   About a little girl 'e tracked.   'Er name is Flo.  Ain't that a fact? That's 'er. I know she writes to 'im Each mail.  She ain't forgotten Jim.  \"I'd like to swap my luck for Jim's If 'e comes 'ome with all 'is limbs.   An', if 'e don't--well, I dunno.   I've taken notice uv this Flo, An' wonder if\"--'e stares at me-- \"If there is more like 'er\" sez 'e.  Now, Digger Smith 'as learned a lot Out fightin' there, but 'e ain't got   The cunnin' for to 'ide 'is 'eart.   'E's too dam honest, for a start; 'Is mind's dead simple to a friend. I've read 'im through from end to end.  I've learned from things 'e 'asn't said Jist wot's been runnin in 'is 'ead.   I know there is a girl, somewhere;   Some one 'oo 'ad the 'eart to care For 'im when 'e went to the war. I know all that, an' somethin' more.  I know that since 'e came back 'ere 'E 'asn't seen that girl for fear   She'd turn 'im down--give 'im the bird,   An' 'and 'im out the frozen word, Because 'e's left a leg in France; An' 'e's afraid to take a chance.  Well, not afraid, per'aps, but--shook. It's jist the form 'is nerves 'ave took.   Now 'e's been watchin' Flo an' seen  'Er style, an' 'ow she's always keen For news uv Jim.  Then 'e starts out To 'ope, an' 'esitate, an' doubt.  'E wonders if 'is own girl spoke Jist this same way about 'er bloke.  'E wonders if in 'is girl's eyes   That same look came; an' then 'e sighs, An' dulls 'is senses with the dope That 'arf a man ain't got no 'ope.  'E makes me tired.  But, all the same, I tries to work a little game.  \"Look 'ere,\" I sez.  \"About this Flo.   Jim mightn't come back 'ome, yeh know. You 'ave a fly; yeh're sure to score; Besides, all's fair in love an' war.\"  \"Sling that!\" 'e sez; but I goes on \"Ole Jim won't blame yeh when she's gone.  'E knows, the same as me an' you,   These silly tarts, they can't keep true.\" I piles it on until I've got 'Im where I want 'im--jumpin' 'ot.  An' then 'e sez, \"'Ere, sling that talk! I might be groggy in me walk;   But if yeh say them things to me   I'm man enough to crack yeh; see?\" \"Righto,\" sez I.  \"That was me plan. Now wot about this 'arf a man?\"  'E stares at me, an' then sez, slow, \"Wot is yer game? Wot do yeh know?\"  \"Nothin',\" I tells 'im, \"only this   When there's a waitin' tart to kiss Yeh're only 'arf a man; but when There's blokes to fight, yeh're twenty men.\"  \"Wot tart?\" 'e asks. \"Yeh mean this Flo?\" \"P'r'aps not,\" I sez.  \"You ought to know.\"   I waits to let me words sink in.   An' then--'e beats me with that grin. \"Match-makin', Bill?\" 'e laughs.  \"Oh, 'Ell! You take up knittin' for a spell.\"     IX. THE BOYS OUT THERE   The Boys Out There  \"WHY do they do it? I dunno,\"   Sez Digger Smith. \"Yeh got me beat. Some uv the yarns yeh 'ear is true, An' some is rather umptydoo,   An' some is--indiscreet. But them that don't get to the crowd, Them is the ones would make yeh proud.\"  With Digger Smith an' other blokes   'Oo 'ave returned it's much the same They'll talk uv wot they've seen an' done When they've been out to 'ave their fun;   But no word uv the game. On fights an' all the tale uv blood Their talk, as they remark, is dud.  It's so with soldiers, I 'ave 'eard,   All times.  The things that they 'ave done, War-mad, with blood before their eyes, An' in their ears wild fightin' cries,   They ever after shun. P'r'aps they forget; or find it well Not to recall too much uv 'Ell.  An' when they won't loose up their talk   It's 'ard for us to understand 'Ow all those boys we used to know, Ole Billo, Jim an' Tom an' Joe,   Done things to beat the band. We knoo they'd fight; but they've became 'Ead ringers at the fightin' game.  Well, wot I've 'eard from Digger Smith   An' other soldier blokes like 'im I've put together bit by bit, An' chewed a long time over it;   An' now I've got a dim An' 'azy notion in me 'ead Why they is battlers, born an' bred.  Wot did they know uv war first off,   When they joined up? Wot did I know When I was tossed out on me neck As if I was a shattered wreck   The time I tried to go? Flat feet! Me feet 'as len'th an' brea'th Enough to kick a 'Un to death!  They don't know nothin', bein' reared   Out 'ere where war 'as never spread-- \"A land by bloodless conquest won,\" As some son uv a writin' gun   Sez in a book I read They don't know nix but wot they're told At school; an' that sticks till they're old.
