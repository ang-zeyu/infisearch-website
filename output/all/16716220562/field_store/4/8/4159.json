Infected be the air whereon they ride; And damn’d all those that trust them!—I did hear The galloping of horse: who was’t came by?  LENNOX. ’Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word Macduff is fled to England.  MACBETH. Fled to England!  LENNOX. Ay, my good lord.  MACBETH. Time, thou anticipat’st my dread exploits: The flighty purpose never is o’ertook Unless the deed go with it. From this moment The very firstlings of my heart shall be The firstlings of my hand. And even now, To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done: The castle of Macduff I will surprise; Seize upon Fife; give to th’ edge o’ th’ sword His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool; This deed I’ll do before this purpose cool: But no more sights!—Where are these gentlemen? Come, bring me where they are.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. Fife. A Room in Macduff’s Castle.   Enter Lady Macduff her Son and Ross.  LADY MACDUFF. What had he done, to make him fly the land?  ROSS. You must have patience, madam.  LADY MACDUFF. He had none: His flight was madness: when our actions do not, Our fears do make us traitors.  ROSS. You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.  LADY MACDUFF. Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes, His mansion, and his titles, in a place From whence himself does fly? He loves us not: He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren, The most diminutive of birds, will fight, Her young ones in her nest, against the owl. All is the fear, and nothing is the love; As little is the wisdom, where the flight So runs against all reason.  ROSS. My dearest coz, I pray you, school yourself: but, for your husband, He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows The fits o’ th’ season. I dare not speak much further: But cruel are the times, when we are traitors, And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumour From what we fear, yet know not what we fear, But float upon a wild and violent sea Each way and move—I take my leave of you: Shall not be long but I’ll be here again. Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward To what they were before.—My pretty cousin, Blessing upon you!  LADY MACDUFF. Father’d he is, and yet he’s fatherless.  ROSS. I am so much a fool, should I stay longer, It would be my disgrace and your discomfort: I take my leave at once.   [_Exit._]  LADY MACDUFF. Sirrah, your father’s dead. And what will you do now? How will you live?  SON. As birds do, mother.  LADY MACDUFF. What, with worms and flies?  SON. With what I get, I mean; and so do they.  LADY MACDUFF. Poor bird! thou’dst never fear the net nor lime, The pit-fall nor the gin.  SON. Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for. My father is not dead, for all your saying.  LADY MACDUFF. Yes, he is dead: how wilt thou do for a father?  SON. Nay, how will you do for a husband?  LADY MACDUFF. Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.  SON. Then you’ll buy ’em to sell again.  LADY MACDUFF. Thou speak’st with all thy wit; And yet, i’ faith, with wit enough for thee.  SON. Was my father a traitor, mother?  LADY MACDUFF. Ay, that he was.  SON. What is a traitor?  LADY MACDUFF. Why, one that swears and lies.  SON. And be all traitors that do so?  LADY MACDUFF. Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.  SON. And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?  LADY MACDUFF. Every one.  SON. Who must hang them?  LADY MACDUFF. Why, the honest men.  SON. Then the liars and swearers are fools: for there are liars and swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them.  LADY MACDUFF. Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do for a father?  SON. If he were dead, you’ld weep for him: if you would not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father.  LADY MACDUFF. Poor prattler, how thou talk’st!   Enter a Messenger.  MESSENGER. Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known, Though in your state of honour I am perfect. I doubt some danger does approach you nearly: If you will take a homely man’s advice, Be not found here; hence, with your little ones. To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage; To do worse to you were fell cruelty, Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you! I dare abide no longer.   [_Exit._]  LADY MACDUFF. Whither should I fly? I have done no harm. But I remember now I am in this earthly world, where to do harm Is often laudable; to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly:  why then, alas, Do I put up that womanly defence, To say I have done no harm? What are these faces?   Enter Murderers.  FIRST MURDERER. Where is your husband?  LADY MACDUFF. I hope, in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou mayst find him.  FIRST MURDERER. He’s a traitor.  SON. Thou liest, thou shag-ear’d villain!  FIRST MURDERER. What, you egg!   [_Stabbing him._]  Young fry of treachery!  SON. He has kill’d me, mother: Run away, I pray you!   [_Dies. Exit Lady Macduff, crying “Murder!” and pursued by the  Murderers._]  SCENE III. England. Before the King’s Palace.   Enter Malcolm and Macduff.  MALCOLM. Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty.  MACDUFF. Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword, and, like good men, Bestride our down-fall’n birthdom. Each new morn New widows howl, new orphans cry; new sorrows Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland, and yell’d out Like syllable of dolour.  MALCOLM. What I believe, I’ll wail; What know, believe; and what I can redress, As I shall find the time to friend, I will. What you have spoke, it may be so, perchance. This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues, Was once thought honest: you have loved him well; He hath not touch’d you yet. I am young; but something You may deserve of him through me; and wisdom To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb To appease an angry god.  MACDUFF. I am not treacherous.  MALCOLM. But Macbeth is. A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon. That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose. Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell: Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace, Yet grace must still look so.  MACDUFF. I have lost my hopes.  MALCOLM. Perchance even there where I did find my doubts. Why in that rawness left you wife and child, Those precious motives, those strong knots of love, Without leave-taking?—I pray you, Let not my jealousies be your dishonours, But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just, Whatever I shall think.  MACDUFF. Bleed, bleed, poor country! Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure, For goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs; The title is affeer’d.—Fare thee well, lord: I would not be the villain that thou think’st For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp And the rich East to boot.  MALCOLM. Be not offended: I speak not as in absolute fear of you. I think our country sinks beneath the yoke; It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds. I think, withal, There would be hands uplifted in my right; And here, from gracious England, have I offer Of goodly thousands: but, for all this, When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head, Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country Shall have more vices than it had before, More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever, By him that shall succeed.  MACDUFF. What should he be?  MALCOLM. It is myself I mean; in whom I know All the particulars of vice so grafted That, when they shall be open’d, black Macbeth Will seem as pure as snow; and the poor state Esteem him as a lamb, being compar’d With my confineless harms.  MACDUFF. Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn’d In evils to top Macbeth.  MALCOLM. I grant him bloody, Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin That has a name: but there’s no bottom, none, In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters, Your matrons, and your maids, could not fill up The cistern of my lust; and my desire All continent impediments would o’erbear, That did oppose my will: better Macbeth Than such an one to reign.  MACDUFF. Boundless intemperance In nature is a tyranny; it hath been Th’ untimely emptying of the happy throne, And fall of many kings. But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours: you may Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty, And yet seem cold—the time you may so hoodwink. We have willing dames enough; there cannot be That vulture in you, to devour so many As will to greatness dedicate themselves, Finding it so inclin’d.  MALCOLM. With this there grows In my most ill-compos’d affection such A staunchless avarice, that, were I king, I should cut off the nobles for their lands; Desire his jewels, and this other’s house: And my more-having would be as a sauce To make me hunger more; that I should forge Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal, Destroying them for wealth.  MACDUFF. This avarice Sticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root Than summer-seeming lust; and it hath been The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear; Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will, Of your mere own. All these are portable, With other graces weigh’d.  MALCOLM. But I have none: the king-becoming graces, As justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness, Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness, Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude, I have no relish of them; but abound In the division of each several crime, Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell, Uproar the universal peace, confound All unity on earth.  MACDUFF. O Scotland, Scotland!  MALCOLM. If such a one be fit to govern, speak: I am as I have spoken.  MACDUFF. Fit to govern? No, not to live.—O nation miserable, With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter’d, When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again, Since that the truest issue of thy throne By his own interdiction stands accus’d, And"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1533"],["title","Macbeth (#8)"],["body","blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee, Oft’ner upon her knees than on her feet, Died every day she lived. Fare thee well! These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself Have banish’d me from Scotland.—O my breast, Thy hope ends here!  MALCOLM. Macduff, this noble passion, Child of integrity, hath from my soul Wiped the black scruples, reconcil’d my thoughts To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth By many of these trains hath sought to win me Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me From over-credulous haste: but God above Deal between thee and me! for even now I put myself to thy direction, and Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure The taints and blames I laid upon myself, For strangers to my nature. I am yet Unknown to woman; never was forsworn; Scarcely have coveted what was mine own; At no time broke my faith; would not betray The devil to his fellow; and delight No less in truth than life: my first false speaking Was this upon myself. What I am truly, Is thine and my poor country’s to command: Whither, indeed, before thy here-approach, Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men, Already at a point, was setting forth. Now we’ll together, and the chance of goodness Be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?  MACDUFF. Such welcome and unwelcome things at once ’Tis hard to reconcile.   Enter a Doctor.  MALCOLM. Well; more anon.—Comes the King forth, I pray you?  DOCTOR. Ay, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls That stay his cure: their malady convinces The great assay of art; but at his touch, Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand, They presently amend.  MALCOLM. I thank you, doctor.   [_Exit Doctor._]  MACDUFF. What’s the disease he means?  MALCOLM. ’Tis call’d the evil: A most miraculous work in this good king; Which often, since my here-remain in England, I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven, Himself best knows, but strangely-visited people, All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye, The mere despair of surgery, he cures; Hanging a golden stamp about their necks, Put on with holy prayers: and ’tis spoken, To the succeeding royalty he leaves The healing benediction. With this strange virtue, He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy; And sundry blessings hang about his throne, That speak him full of grace.   Enter Ross.  MACDUFF. See, who comes here?  MALCOLM. My countryman; but yet I know him not.  MACDUFF. My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.  MALCOLM. I know him now. Good God, betimes remove The means that makes us strangers!  ROSS. Sir, amen.  MACDUFF. Stands Scotland where it did?  ROSS. Alas, poor country, Almost afraid to know itself! It cannot Be call’d our mother, but our grave, where nothing, But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile; Where sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that rent the air, Are made, not mark’d; where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell Is there scarce ask’d for who; and good men’s lives Expire before the flowers in their caps, Dying or ere they sicken.  MACDUFF. O, relation Too nice, and yet too true!  MALCOLM. What’s the newest grief?  ROSS. That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker; Each minute teems a new one.  MACDUFF. How does my wife?  ROSS. Why, well.  MACDUFF. And all my children?  ROSS. Well too.  MACDUFF. The tyrant has not batter’d at their peace?  ROSS. No; they were well at peace when I did leave ’em.  MACDUFF. Be not a niggard of your speech: how goes’t?  ROSS. When I came hither to transport the tidings, Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour Of many worthy fellows that were out; Which was to my belief witness’d the rather, For that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot. Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland Would create soldiers, make our women fight, To doff their dire distresses.  MALCOLM. Be’t their comfort We are coming thither. Gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men; An older and a better soldier none That Christendom gives out.  ROSS. Would I could answer This comfort with the like! But I have words That would be howl’d out in the desert air, Where hearing should not latch them.  MACDUFF. What concern they? The general cause? or is it a fee-grief Due to some single breast?  ROSS. No mind that’s honest But in it shares some woe, though the main part Pertains to you alone.  MACDUFF. If it be mine, Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.  ROSS. Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever, Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound That ever yet they heard.  MACDUFF. Humh! I guess at it.  ROSS. Your castle is surpris’d; your wife and babes Savagely slaughter’d. To relate the manner Were, on the quarry of these murder’d deer, To add the death of you.  MALCOLM. Merciful heaven!— What, man! ne’er pull your hat upon your brows. Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak Whispers the o’er-fraught heart, and bids it break.  MACDUFF. My children too?  ROSS. Wife, children, servants, all That could be found.  MACDUFF. And I must be from thence! My wife kill’d too?  ROSS. I have said.  MALCOLM. Be comforted: Let’s make us med’cines of our great revenge, To cure this deadly grief.  MACDUFF. He has no children.—All my pretty ones? Did you say all?—O hell-kite!—All? What, all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop?  MALCOLM. Dispute it like a man.  MACDUFF. I shall do so; But I must also feel it as a man: I cannot but remember such things were, That were most precious to me.—Did heaven look on, And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff, They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am, Not for their own demerits, but for mine, Fell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now!  MALCOLM. Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.  MACDUFF. O, I could play the woman with mine eyes, And braggart with my tongue!—But, gentle heavens, Cut short all intermission; front to front, Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself; Within my sword’s length set him; if he ’scape, Heaven forgive him too!  MALCOLM. This tune goes manly. Come, go we to the King. Our power is ready; Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may; The night is long that never finds the day.   [_Exeunt._]   ACT V  SCENE I. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle.   Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.  DOCTOR. I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?  GENTLEWOMAN. Since his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.  DOCTOR. A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching. In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?  GENTLEWOMAN. That, sir, which I will not report after her.  DOCTOR. You may to me; and ’tis most meet you should.  GENTLEWOMAN. Neither to you nor anyone; having no witness to confirm my speech.   Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.  Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.  DOCTOR. How came she by that light?  GENTLEWOMAN. Why, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; ’tis her command.  DOCTOR. You see, her eyes are open.  GENTLEWOMAN. Ay, but their sense are shut.  DOCTOR. What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.  GENTLEWOMAN. It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.  LADY MACBETH. Yet here’s a spot.  DOCTOR. Hark, she speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.  LADY MACBETH. Out, damned spot! out, I say! One; two. Why, then ’tis time to do’t. Hell is murky! Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?  DOCTOR. Do you mark that?  LADY MACBETH. The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?—What, will these hands ne’er be clean? No more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that: you mar all with this starting.  DOCTOR. Go to, go to. You have known what you should not.  GENTLEWOMAN. She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that: heaven knows what she has known.  LADY MACBETH. Here’s the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!  DOCTOR. What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.  GENTLEWOMAN. I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.  DOCTOR. Well, well, well.  GENTLEWOMAN. Pray God it be, sir.  DOCTOR. This disease is beyond my practice: yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep, who have died holily in their beds.  LADY MACBETH. Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo’s buried; he cannot come out on’s grave.  DOCTOR. Even so?  LADY MACBETH. To bed, to bed. There’s knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What’s done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed.   [_Exit._]  DOCTOR. Will she go now to bed?  GENTLEWOMAN. Directly.  DOCTOR. Foul whisp’rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets. More needs she the divine than the physician.— God, God, forgive us all! Look after her; Remove from her the means of all annoyance, And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night: My mind she has mated, and amaz’d my sight. I think, but dare not speak.  GENTLEWOMAN. Good night, good doctor.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE II. The Country near Dunsinane.   Enter, with drum and colours"]]]
