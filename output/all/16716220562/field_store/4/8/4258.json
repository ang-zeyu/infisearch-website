From hence the World may be assisted with _variety_ of Inventions, _new_ matter for Sciences may be _collected_, the _old improv’d_, and their _rust_ rubb’d away; and as it is by the benefit of Senses that we receive all our Skill in the works of Nature, so they also may be wonderfully benefited by it, and may be guided to an easier and more exact performance of their Offices; ’tis not unlikely, but that we may find out wherein our Senses are deficient, and as easily find wayes of repairing them.  The Indeavours of Skilful men have been most conversant about the assistance of the Eye, and many noble Productions have followed upon it; and from hence we may conclude, that there is a way open’d for advancing the operations, not only of all the other Senses, but even of the Eye it self; that which has been already done ought not to content us, but rather to incourage us to proceed further, and to attempt greater things in the same and different wayes.  ’Tis not unlikely, but that there may be yet invented several other helps for the eye, at much exceeding those already found, as those do the bare eye, such as by which we may perhaps be able to discover _living Creatures_ in the Moon, or other Planets, the _figures_ of the compounding Particles of matter, and the particular _Schematisms_ and _Textures_ of Bodies.  And as _Glasses_ have highly promoted our _seeing_, so ’tis not improbable, but that there may be found many _Mechanical Inventions_ to improve our other Senses, of _hearing_, _smelling_, _tasting_, _touching._ ’Tis not impossible to hear a _whisper_ a _furlongs_ distance, it having been already done; and perhaps the nature of the thing would not make it more impossible, though that furlong should be ten times multiply’d. And though some famous Authors have affirm’d it impossible to hear through the _thinnest plate_ of _Muscovy-glass_; yet I know a way, by which ’tis easie enough to hear one speak through a _wall a yard thick_. It has not been yet thoroughly examin’d, how far _Otocousticons_ may be improv’d, nor what other wayes there may be of _quickning_ our hearing, or _conveying_ sound through _other bodies_ then the _Air_: for that that is not the only _medium_, I can assure the Reader, that I have, by the help of a _distended wire_, propagated the sound to a very considerable distance in an _instant_, or with as seemingly quick a motion as that of light, at least, incomparably swifter then that, which at the same time was propagated through the Air; and this not only in a straight line, or direct, but in one bended in many angles.  Nor are the other three so perfect, but that _diligence_, _attention_, and many _mechanical contrivances_, may also highly improve them. For since the sense of _smelling_ seems to be made by the _swift passage_ of the _Air_ (_impregnated_ with the steams and _effluvia_ of several odorous Bodies) through the grisly _meanders_ of the Nose whose surfaces are _cover’d_ with a very sensible _nerve_, and _moistned_ by a _transudation_ from the _processus mamillares_ of the Brain, and some adjoyning _glandules_, and by the moist _steam_ of the _Lungs_, with a Liquor convenient for the reception of those _effluvia_ and by the adhesion and mixing of those steams with that liquor, and thereby affecting the nerve, or perhaps by insinuating themselves into the juices of the brain, after the same manner, as I have in the following Observations intimated, the parts of Salt to pass through the skins of Effs, and Frogs. Since, I say, smelling seems to be made by some such way, ’tis not improbable, but that some contrivance, for making a great quantity of Air pass quick through the Nose, might as much promote the sense of smelling, as the any wayes hindring that passage does dull and destroy it. Several tryals I have made, both of hindring and promoting this sense, and have succeeded in some according to expectation; and indeed to me it seems capable of being improv’d, for the judging of the constitutions of many Bodies. Perhaps we may thereby also judge (as other Creatures seem to do) what is wholsome, what poyson; and in a word, what are the specifick properties of Bodies.  There may be also some other mechanical wayes found out, of sensibly perceiving the _effluvia_ of Bodies; several Instances of which, were it here proper, I could give of Mineral steams and exhalations; and it seems not impossible, but that by some such wayes improved, may be discovered, what Minerals lye buried under the Earth, without the trouble to dig for them; some things to confirm this Conjecture may be found in _Agricola_, and other Writers of Minerals, speaking of the Vegetables that are apt to thrive, or pine, in those steams.  Whether also those steams, which seem to issue out of the Earth, and mix with the Air (and so to precipitate some _aqueous_ Exhalations, wherewith ’tis impregnated) may not be by some way detected before they produce the effect, seems hard to determine; yet something of this kind I am able to discover, by an Instrument I contriv’d to shew all the minute variations in the pressure of the Air; by which I constantly find, that before, and during the time of rainy weather, the pressure of the Air is less, and in _dry weather_, but especially when an _Eastern Wind_ (which having past over vast tracts of Land is heavy with Earthy Particles) blows, it is much more, though these changes are varied according to very odd Laws.      The Instrument is this. I prepare a pretty capacious Bolt-head AB, with     a small stem about two foot and a half long DC; upon the end of this D     I put on a small bended Glass, or brazen _syphon_ DEF (open at D, E and     F, but to be closed with cement at F and E, as occasion serves) whose     stem F should be about six or eight inches long, but the bore of it not     above half an inch diameter, and very even; these I fix very strongly     together by the help of very hard Cement, and then fit the whole Glass     ABCDEF into a long Board, or Frame, in such manner, that almost half     the head AB may lye buried in a concave Hemisphere cut into the Board     RS; then I place it so on the Board RS, as is exprest in the first     figure of the first Scheme; and fix it very firm and steady in that     posture, so as that the weight of the _Mercury_ that is afterwards to     be put into it, may not in the least shake or stir it; then drawing a     line XY on the Frame RT, so that it may divide the ball into two equal     parts, or that it may pass, as ’twere, through the center of the ball.     I begin from that, and divide all the rest of the Board towards UT into     inches, and the inches between the 25 and the end E (which need not be     above two or three and thirty inches distant from the line XY) I     subdivide into Decimals; then stopping the end F with soft Cement, or     soft Wax, I invert the Frame, placing the head downwards, and the     Orifice E upwards; and by it, with a small Funnel, I fill the whole     Glass with Quicksilver; then by stopping the small Orifice E with my     finger, I oftentimes erect and invert the whole Glass and Frame, and     thereby free the Quicksilver and Glass from all the bubbles or parcels     of lurking Air; then inverting it as before, I fill it top full with     clear and well strain’d Quicksilver, and having made ready a small ball     of pretty hard Cement, by heat made very soft, I press it into the hole     E, and thereby stop it very fast; and to secure this Cement from flying     out afterward, I bind over it a piece of Leather, that is spread over     in the inside with Cement, and wound about it while the Cement is hot:     Having thus fastned it, I gently erect again the Glass after this     manner: I first let the Frame down edge-wayes, till the edge RV touch     the Floor, or ly horizontal; and then in that edging posture raise the     end RS; this I do, that if there chance to be any Air hidden in the     small Pipe E, it may ascend into the Pipe F, and not into the Pipe DC:     Having thus erected it, and hung it by the hole Q, or fixt it     perpendicularly by any other means, I open the end F, and by a small     _Syphon_ I draw out the _Mercury_ so long, till I find the surface of     it AB in the head to touch exactly the line XY; at which time I     immediately take away the _Syphon_, and if by chance it be run somewhat     below the line XY, by pouring in gently a little _Mercury_ at F, I     raise it again to its desired height, by this contrivance I make all     the sensible rising and falling of the _Mercury_ to be visible in the     surface of the _Mercury_ in the Pipe F, and scarce any in the head AB.     But because there really is some small change of the upper surface     also, I find by several Observations how much it rises in the Ball, and     falls in the Pipe F, to make the distance between the two surfaces an     inch greater then it was before; and the measure that it falls in the     Pipe is the length of the inch by which I am to mark the parts of the     Tube F, or the Board on which it lyes, into inches and Decimals: Having     thus justned and divided it, I have a large Wheel MNOP, whose outmost     limb is divided into two hundred equal parts; this by"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15491"],["title","Micrographia (#3)"],["body"," small     Pillars is fixt on the Frame RT, in the manner exprest in the Figure.     In the middle of this, on the back side, in a convenient frame, is     placed a small Cylinder, whose circumference is equal to twice the     length of one of those divisions, which I find answer to an inch of     ascent, or descent, of _Mercury_: This Cylinder I, is movable on a very     small Needle, on the end of which is fixt a very light Index KL, all     which are so pois’d on the Axis, or Needle, that no part is heavier     then another: Then about this Cylinder is wound a small Clew of Silk,     with two small steel Bullets at each end of it GH; one of these, which     is somewhat the heavier, ought to be so big, as freely to move to and     fro in the Pipe F; by means of which contrivance, every the least     variation of the height of the _Mercury_ will be made exceeding visible     by the motion to and fro of the small Index KL.  But this is but one way of discovering the _effluvia_ of the Earth mixt with the Air; there may be perhaps many others, witness the _Hygroscope_, an Instrument whereby the watery steams volatile in the Air are discerned, which the Nose it self is not able to find. This I have describ’d in the following Tract in the Description of the Beard of a wild Oat. Others there are, may be discovered both by the Nose, and by other wayes also. Thus the _smoak_ of burning _Wood_ is _smelt_, _seen_, and sufficiently _felt_ by the eyes: The _fumes_ of burning _Brimstone_ are _smelt_ and discovered also by the destroying the Colours of Bodies, as by the _whitening of a red Rose_: And who knows, but that the Industry of man, following this method, may find out wayes of improving this sense to as great a degree of perfection at it is in any Animal, and perhaps yet higher.  ’Tis not improbable also, but that our _taste_ may be very much improv’d, either by _preparing_ our taste for the Body, as, after eating _bitter_ things, _Wine_, or other _Vinous liquors_, are more sensibly tasted; or else by _preparing_ Bodies for our tast; as the dissolving of Metals with acid Liquors, make them tastable, which were before altogether insipid; thus _Lead_ becomes _sweeter_ then Sugar, and _Silver_ more _bitter_ then Gall, _Copper_ and _Iron_ of most _loathsome_ tasts. And indeed the business of this sense being to discover the presence of dissolved Bodies in Liquors put on the Tongue, or in general to discover that a fluid body has some solid body dissolv’d in it, and what they are; whatever contrivance makes this discovery improves this sense. In this kind the mixtures of Chymical Liquors afford many Instances; as the sweet Vinegar that is impregnated with Lead may be discovered to be so by the affusion of a little of an _Alcalizate solution_: The bitter liquor of _Aqua fortis_ and _Silver_ may be discover’d to be charg’d with that Metal, by laying in it some plates of Copper: ’Tis not improbable also, but there may be multitudes of other wayes of discovering the parts dissolv’d, or dissoluble in liquors; and what is this discovery but a kind of _secundary tasting_.  ’Tis not improbable also, but that the sense of _feeling_ may be highly improv’d, for that being a sense that judges of the more _gross_ and _robust motions_ of the _Particles_ of _Bodies_, seems capable of being improv’d and assisted very many wayes. Thus for the distinguishing of _Heat_ and _Cold_, the _Weather-glass_ and _Thermometer_, which I have describ’d in this following Treatise, do exceedingly perfect it; by each of which the least variations of heat or cold, which the most Acute sense is not able to distinguish, are manifested. This is oftentimes further promoted also by the help of _Burning-glasses_, and the like, which collect and unite the radiating heat. Thus the _roughness_ and _smoothness_ of a Body is made much more sensible by the help of a _Microscope_, then by the most _tender_ and _delicate Hand_. Perhaps, a Physitian might, by several other _tangible_ proprieties, discover the constitution of a Body as well as by the _Pulse_. I do but instance in these, to shew what possibility there may be of many others, and what probability and hopes there were of finding them, if this method were followed; for the Offices of the five Senses being to detect either the _subtil_ and _curious Motions_ propagated through all _pellucid_ or perfectly _homogeneous_ Bodies; Or the more _gross_ and _vibrative Pulse_ communicated through the _Air_ and all other convenient _mediums_, whether fluid or solid: Or the _effluvia_ of Bodies _dissolv’d_ in the _Air_; Or the _particles_ of bodies _dissolv’d_ or _dissoluble_ in _Liquors_, or the more _quick_ and _violent shaking motion_ of _heat_ in all or any of these: whatsoever does any wayes promote any of these kinds of _criteria_, does afford a way of improving some one sense. And what a multitude of these would a diligent Man meet with in his inquiries? And this for the helping and promoting the _sensitive faculty_ only.  Next, as for the _Memory_, or _retentive faculty_, we may be sufficiently instructed from the _written Histories_ of _civil actions_, what great assistance may be afforded the Memory, in the committing to writing things observable in _natural operations_. If a Physitian be therefore accounted the more able in his Faculty, because he has had long experience and practice, the remembrance of which, though perhaps very imperfect, does regulate all his after actions: What ought to be thought of that man, that has not only a perfect _register_ of his own experience, but is grown _old_ with the experience of many hundreds of years, and many thousands of men.  And though of late, men, beginning to be sensible of this convenience, have here and there registred and printed some few _Centuries_, yet for the most part they are set down very lamely and imperfectly, and, I fear, many times not so truly, they seeming, several of them, to be design’d more for _Ostentation_ then _publique use_: For, not to instance, that they do, for the most part, omit those Experiences they have made, wherein their Patients have miscarried, it is very easie to be perceiv’d, that they do all along _hyperbolically extol_ their own Prescriptions, and vilifie those of others. Notwithstanding all which, these kinds of Histories are generally esteem’d useful, even to the ablest Physitian.  What may not be expected from the _rational_ or _deductive Faculty_ that is furnisht with such _Materials_, and those so readily _adapted_, and rang’d for use, that in a moment, as ’twere, thousands of Instances, serving for the _illustration_, _determination_, or _invention_, of almost any inquiry, may be _represented_ even to the sight? How neer the nature of _Axioms_ must all those _Propositions_ be which are examin’d before so many _Witnesses_? And how difficult will it be for any, though never so subtil an error in Philosophy, to _scape_ from being discover’d, after it has indur’d the _touch_, and so many other _tryals_?  What kind of mechanical way, and physical invention also is there requir’d that might not this way be found out? The _Invention_ of a way to find the _Longitude_ of places is easily perform’d, and that to as great _perfection_ as is desir’d, or to at great an _accurateness_ as the _Latitude_ of places can be found at Sea; and perhaps yet also to a greater certainty then that has been hitherto found, as I shall very speedily freely manifest to the world. The way of _flying_ in the Air seems principally unpracticable, by reason of the _want of strength_ in _humane muscles_; if therefore that could be suppli’d, it were, I think, easie to make twenty contrivances to perform the office of _Wings_: What Attempts also I have made for the supplying that Defect, and my successes therein, which, I think, are wholly new, and not inconsiderable, I shall in another place relate.  ’Tis not unlikely also, but that _Chymists_, if they followed this method, might find out their so much sought for _Alkahest_. What an _universal Menstruum_, which dissolves all sorts of _Sulphureous Bodies_, I have discover’d (which has not been before taken notice of as such) I have shewn in the sixteenth Observation.  What a prodigious variety of Inventions in _Anatomy_ has this latter Age afforded, even in our own Bodies in the very _Heart_, by which we live, and the Brain, which is the seat of our knowledge of other things? witness all the excellent Works of _Pecquet_, _Bartholinus_, _Billius_, and many others; and at home, of Doctor _Harvy_, Doctor _Ent_, Doctor _Willis_, Doctor _Glisson_. In _Celestial Observations_ we have far exceeded all the Antients, even the _Chaldeans_ and _Egyptians_ themselves, whose _vast Plains_, _high Towers_, and _clear Air_, did not give them so great advantages over us, as have over them by our _Glasses_. By the help of which, they have been very much outdone by the famous _Galileo_, _Hevelius_, _Zulichem_; and our own Countrymen, Mr. _Rook_, Doctor _Wren_, and the great Ornament of our Church and Nation, the _Lord Bishop of Exeter_. And to say no more in _Aerial Discoveries_, there has been a wonderful progress made by the _Noble Engine_ of _the most Illustrious Mr. Boyle_, whom it becomes me to mention with all honour, not only as my particular Patron, but as the _Patron_ of _Philosophy_ it self; which he every day _increases_ by his _Labours_, and _adorns_ by his _Example_.  The good success of all these _great Men_, and many others, and the now seemingly great _obviousness_ of most of their and divers other Inventions, which from the beginning of the world have been, as ’twere, trod on, and yet not minded till these last _inquisitive_ Ages (an Argument that there may be yet behind multitudes of the like) puts me in mind to recommend such Studies, and the prosecution of them by such methods, to the _Gentlemen_ of our Nation, whose _leisure_ makes them fit to _undertake_, and the _plenty_ of their fortunes _to"]]]
