Go away; you are the wolf.\"  [Illustration]  Then the wolf went to the miller's, and said to him, \"Mr. Miller, put some flour on my foot, for I have hurt it.\"  The miller was so afraid of the wolf that he did as he was told.  Then the wicked wolf went to the goat's house again and said, \"Open the door, dear children, for I am your mother.\"  \"Show us your foot,\" said the little kids.  So the wolf put his one white foot on the window sill.  When the little kids saw that it was white, they thought this was really their mother, and they opened the door.  In jumped the ugly old wolf, and all the little kids ran to hide themselves.  The first hid under the table, the second in the bed, the third in the oven, the fourth in the kitchen, the fifth in the cupboard, the sixth under the washtub, and the seventh, who was the smallest of all, in the tall clock.  The wolf quickly found and gobbled up all but the youngest, who was in the clock.  Then the wolf, who felt sleepy, went out and lay down on the green grass.  Soon he was fast asleep.   THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN YOUNG KIDS--II  Not long after this the old goat came home from the woods.  Ah, what did she see! The house door was wide open; the tables and chairs were upset.  The washtub was broken in pieces, and the bed was tipped over.  \"Where are my dear children?\" cried the poor goat.  At last she heard a little voice crying, \"Dear mother, here I am in the tall clock.\"  The old goat helped the little goat out.  Soon she learned how the wolf had eaten her dear children.  Then she went out of the hut, and there on the grass lay the wolf sound asleep.  As the goat looked at the wicked old wolf, she thought she saw something jumping about inside him.  \"Ah,\" she said, \"it may be that my poor children are still alive.\"  So she sent the little kid into the house for a pair of scissors and a needle and some thread.  She quickly cut a hole in the side of the wicked old wolf.  At the first snip of the scissors, one of the kids stuck out his head.  As the old goat cut, more and more heads popped out.  At last all six of the kids jumped out upon the grass.  They went hopping and skipping about their mother.  Then the old goat said to them, \"Go and bring me some large stones from the brook.\"  The seven little kids ran off to the brook and soon came back with seven large stones.  They put these stones inside the wicked old wolf.  [Illustration]  The old goat sewed up the wolf's side so gently and quietly that he did not wake up nor move.  When at last the wicked wolf did wake up, the great stones inside him made him feel very heavy.  He was thirsty, too, so he walked down to the brook to drink.  The stones were so heavy that they tipped him over the edge of the bank into the deep water, and he was drowned.  WILLIAM AND JACOB GRIMM         THEY DIDN'T THINK      danger  folks  seized       Once a trap was baited       With a piece of cheese;     It tickled so a little mouse,       It almost made him sneeze.     An old rat said, \"There's danger,       Be careful where you go!\"     \"Nonsense!\" said the other,       \"I don't think you know!\"     So he walked in boldly--       Nobody in sight--     First he took a nibble,       Then he took a bite;     Close the trap together       Snapped as quick as wink,     Catching mousey fast there,       'Cause he didn't think.      Once there was a robin,       Lived outside the door,     Who wanted to go inside       And hop upon the floor.     \"No, no,\" said the mother,       \"You must stay with me;     Little birds are safest       Sitting in a tree.\"     \"I don't care,\" said Robin,       And gave his tail a fling,     \"I don't think the old folks       Know quite everything.\"     Down he flew, and kitty seized him       Before he'd time to blink;     \"Oh,\" he cried, \"I'm sorry,       But I didn't think.\"      PHOEBE CARY  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  TOM THUMB--I  thumb  people  suit  reins  fought frightened  brought  thistledown   In the days of King Arthur, there lived a wise man named Merlin.  He knew all the fairies and where they lived.  Even the fairy queen was a friend of his.  Once, while he was traveling, night overtook him in a deep forest.  He rapped at the door of a small cottage and asked for some food.  Merlin looked so hungry and poor that the farmer and his wife took pity on him.  They not only gave him a bowl of milk with some brown bread, but they said he might stay through the night.  Merlin saw that, in spite of their pleasant cottage, both the farmer and his wife were very sad.  \"Why are you sad?\" asked Merlin.  \"You seem to have a good farm, a pleasant cottage, and many things to make you happy.\"  \"Ah!\" said the woman, \"we are unhappy because we have no child.  I should be the happiest woman in the world if I had a son.  Why, even if he were no bigger than my husband's thumb, we should love him dearly.\"  \"That would be indeed a very strange kind of child,\" said Merlin, \"but I hope you may have your wish.\"  Now Merlin was on his way to call on the queen of the fairies.  When he came to her castle the next day, he told the fairy queen the wish of the farmer's wife.  The queen of the fairies said, \"The good woman shall have her wish. I will give her a son no larger than her husband's thumb.\"   TOM THUMB--II  Soon after this the good farmer's wife had a son. He was, indeed, just the size of his father's thumb.  People came from far and wide to see the tiny boy.  One day the fairy queen and some other fairies came to see him.  The queen kissed the little boy and named him Tom Thumb.  [Illustration]  Each of the other fairies made Tom a gift.  He had a shirt made of silk from a spider's web, a coat of thistledown, a hat made from the leaf of an oak, tiny shoes made from a mouse's skin, and many other gifts besides.  Tom never grew any larger than a man's thumb, but he could do many clever tricks.  One day his mother was mixing a pudding.  Tom leaned over the edge of the bowl to see how it was made.  He slipped, and in he went, head first.  His mother did not see him fall, and kept stirring and stirring the pudding.  Tom could not see nor hear, but he kicked and kicked inside the pudding.  The pudding moved and tossed about.  His mother was afraid.  She did not know what to think.  \"There must be witches in it,\" she said.  She went to the window to throw the pudding out.  Just then a poor beggar was passing by the house.  \"Here is a pudding you may have, if you like,\" said Tom's mother.  The beggar thanked her and put it into his basket.  He had not gone very far, when Tom got his head out of the pudding and shouted in a shrill voice:  \"Take me out! take me out!\"  The poor beggar was so frightened that he dropped his basket, pudding and all, and ran off as fast as he could.  Tom crawled out of the pudding, climbed out of the basket, and ran home.  His mother washed him and put him to bed.   TOM THUMB--III  Not long after this Tom's mother took him with her when she went to milk the cow.  That he might not get lost, she tied him to a wisp of hay.  When Tom's mother was not looking, the cow took the wisp of hay into her mouth.  She began to chew and chew.  Tom began to jump about and shout.  He frightened the cow so that she opened her great mouth and out Tom jumped.  Then Tom's mother took him in her apron and ran with him to the house, but he was not hurt in the least.  [Illustration]  One day Tom was in the field helping his father.  \"Let me drive the horse home,\" said Tom \"You drive the horse!\" said his father.  \"How could you hold the reins?\"  \"I could stand in the horse's ear and tell him which way to go,\" said Tom.  So his father put him in the horse's ear, and he drove safely home.  \"Mother! mother!\" cried Tom.  But when Tom's mother came out, she could see no one.  She began to be afraid.  \"Where are you, Tom?\" she cried.  \"Here I am in the horse's ear. Please take me down,\" said Tom.  His mother lifted him gently down, kissed him, and gave him a blackberry for his supper.  Tom's father made him a whip out of a straw.  Tom tried to drive the cows, but he fell into a deep ditch.  There a great bird saw him and thought he was a mouse.  The bird seized Tom in her claws and carried him toward her nest.  As they were passing over the sea, Tom got away and fell into the water, where a great fish swallowed him at one mouthful.  Soon after this the fish was caught, and it was such a big one that it was sent at once to King Arthur.  When the cook cut open the fish, out jumped Tom Thumb. Tom was brought before the king, and his story was told.   TOM THUMB--IV  The king grew very fond of Tom and his wise sayings. He took Tom with him wherever he went.  If it began to rain, Tom would creep into the king's pocket and sleep until the rain was over.  The king had a new suit made for Tom, and gave him a needle for a sword.  A mouse was trained for Tom to ride.  The king and queen never tired of seeing him ride his queer little horse and bravely wave his sword.  One day, as they were going hunting, a cat jumped out and caught Tom's mouse.  [Illustration]  Tom drew his sword and tried to drive the cat away.  The king ran to help poor Tom, but the little mouse was dead, and Tom was scratched and bitten.  Tom was put to bed, but he did not die.  No indeed! he was soon well again, and fought many brave battles and did many brave deeds to please the king.  _English Fairy Tale_     [Illustration]      SUPPOSE      wouldn't  pouring  earnest  lady       Suppose, my little lady,       Your doll should break her head,     Could you make it whole by crying       Till your eyes and nose are red?

ALICE CARY     [Illustration]  CINDERELLA--I   Once upon a time there lived a maiden named Cinderella.  Her mother was dead, and she had to work very, very hard in the kitchen.  She had two older sisters, but they were cross to little Cinderella.  They made her stay among the pots and the kettles and do all the hard work about the house.  Sometimes, to keep warm, she crept in among the cinders.  That is why she was called Cinderella.  One day the sisters came dancing into the house. \"We have been invited to the king's ball,\" they cried.  At length the day of the great ball came, and the two sisters rode away in their fine silk dresses.  Poor Cinderella, who had to stay behind, looked at her old ragged clothes, and burst into tears.  \"Alas,\" she cried, \"why should I always have to stay in the kitchen while my sisters dress in silks and satins?\"  Hardly had she spoken when there stood before her a dear little old lady with a golden wand in her hand.  \"My child,\" she cried, \"I am your fairy godmother, and you shall go to the ball, too.  First go into the garden, Cinderella, and bring to me the largest pumpkin you can find.\"  When Cinderella had done this, the fairy waved her golden wand over the yellow pumpkin.  In a flash, it was not a pumpkin at all, but a beautiful yellow coach.  \"Now bring me four white mice, two large ones and two small ones.\"  In a moment Cinderella brought a trap full of mice into the room.  The fairy waved her golden wand, and the two largest mice were turned into two snow-white horses.  Two small mice became two men, one a coachman, the other a footman.  \"But how am I to go in these clothes?\" said Cinderella.  \"Ah, let me see,\" said the fairy, and she slowly waved her wand over the maiden's head.  [Illustration]  Oh, what a change!  The rags tumbled to the floor.  And, what do you think! in their place was a beautiful pink silk dress.  The ugly shoes fell off.  And, lo! a tiny pair of glass slippers were on Cinderella's little feet.  \"Now listen to what I say,\" said the fairy godmother. \"You must not stay after the clock strikes twelve.  At that time your coach will again be a pumpkin, the men will be mice, and you will have on your old ragged dress.\"  Cinderella said she would not forget.  Then she jumped into the coach, and away she drove to the king's ball.   CINDERELLA--II  The king's son was charmed with Cinderella.  She was so very beautiful that he would dance with her and with no one else.  Cinderella had such a good time that she forgot about the clock.  It began to strike twelve--one, two, three.  Cinderella ran from the room.  Down the steps of the palace she flew.  She ran so fast that she lost one of her little glass slippers.  The clock finished striking.  Lo! the coach turned into a pumpkin.  The horses and men turned into mice.  Poor Cinderella had to walk home in her ragged clothes.  The next morning the prince found Cinderella's little glass slipper on the stairs.  \"There is only one maiden in all the world who can wear so tiny a slipper,\" said the prince. \"I will marry her and no other.\"  The prince hunted far and wide for a maiden who could put it on. Many tried, but none could do it.  At last he came to the house where Cinderella lived. The two older sisters tried and tried to put the slipper on their large feet.  While the prince was waiting, Cinderella came into the room.  \"Let me try it,\" she said.  \"You!\" cried the older sisters. \"You could never put it on.\"  \"Let her try it,\" said the prince.  At once the little glass slipper was fitted to the tiny foot.  [Illustration]  Then Cinderella stood up; her ragged clothes turned into a beautiful silk dress, and there were two little slippers on her two little feet.  Then the prince knew that Cinderella was the one he had danced with at the ball, and taking her hand, he led her out to his coach.  Soon they were married and lived happily ever after.  _English Fairy Tale_         RAINDROPS      Oh, where do you come from,       You little drops of rain,     Pitter-patter, pitter-patter,       Down the windowpane?      Tell me, little raindrops,       Is that the way you play?     Pitter-patter, pitter-patter,       All the rainy day?      I sit here at the window;       I've nothing else to do;     Oh, I wish that I could play,       This rainy day, with you!      The little raindrops cannot speak,       But \"pitter-patter-pat\"     Means, \"We can play on this side,       Why can't you play on that?\"      ANN HAWKSHAWE     [Illustration]  THE FOUR FRIENDS--I  comb  music  giants  chief   Once upon a time a man had a donkey.  His donkey had worked for him many years.  At last the donkey grew so old that he was no longer of any use for work, and his master wished to get rid of him.  The donkey, fearing he might be killed, ran away.  He took the road to Bremen, where he had often heard the street band playing.  He liked music, so he thought he might join the band.  He had not gone far when he came upon an old dog.  The dog was panting, as if he had been running a long way.  \"Why are you panting, my friend?\" asked the donkey.  \"Ah,\" said the dog, \"I am too old for the hunt. My master wished to have me killed. So I ran away. But how I am to find bread and meat, I do not know.\"  \"Well,\" said the donkey, \"come with me. I am going to play in the band at Bremen. I think you and I can easily earn a living by music. I can play the lute, and you can play the kettledrum.\"  The dog was quite willing, and so they be walked on.  They had not gone far when they saw a cat sitting in a yard.  He looked as sad as three days of rainy weather.  \"What's the matter with you, old Tom?\" asked the donkey.  \"You would be sad, too,\" said the cat, \"if you were in my place; for now that I am getting old and cannot catch mice, they wish to drown me. I have run away, but how I am going to live, I do not know.\"  \"Come with us to Bremen,\" said the donkey. \"We are going to play in the band.  I know you love music, as you sing so well at night. You too can join the band.\"  \"That is just what I should like to do,\" said the cat.  So the donkey, the dog, and the cat all walked on together.  [Illustration]  After a time the three came to a farmyard.  There on the gate sat a cock, crying \"Cock-a-doodle-doo\" with all his might.  \"Why are you making so much noise?\" asked the donkey.  \"Ah,\" said the cock, \"I find I must have my head cut off so that I may serve as a dinner for Monday. I'm crowing as hard as I can while my head is still on.\"  \"Come with us, old Red Comb,\" said the donkey. \"We are going to Bremen to join the band. You have a fine voice. You can join, too.\"  \"Ah,\" said the cock, \"that is just what I should like to do.\"  And they all went on their way to Bremen.   THE FOUR FRIENDS--II  At evening the four friends came to a wood, where they stopped for the night.  The donkey and the dog lay down under a large tree.  The cat climbed up on one of the branches.  The cock flew to the very top of the tree, where he felt quite safe.  From his perch on the top of the tree the cock saw a light.  Calling to his friends, he said, \"We are not far from a house. I can see a light.\"  \"Let us go on,\" said the donkey, \"for it may be just the house for us.\"  As they drew near, the light grew larger and brighter.  At last they could see that it came from the window of a robber's house.  The donkey, who was the tallest, went up and looked in.  \"What do you see, old Long Ears?\" asked the cock.  \"What do I see?\" answered the donkey. \"Why, a table spread with plenty to eat and drink, and the robbers having their supper.\"  \"We should be there, too, if we had our rights,\" said the cock.  \"Ah, yes,\" said the donkey; \"if we could only get inside.\"  Then the four friends talked over what they had better do in order to drive the robbers out of the house.  At last they hit upon a plan.  The donkey stood upon his hind legs and placed his front feet on the window sill.  [Illustration]  The dog then stood on the donkey's back  The cat climbed upon the dog, while the cock perched upon the cat's head.  The donkey gave a signal, and they began all at the same time, to make their loudest music.  The donkey brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock crowed, all with such force that the windowpane shook and was almost broken.  The robbers had never heard such a noise.  They thought it must come from witches, or giants, or goblins, and they all ran as fast as they could to the wood behind the house.  Then our four friends rushed in and ate what the robbers had left upon the table.  It did not take long, for they acted as if they had been hungry for a month.  When the four had eaten, they put out the light, and each went to sleep in the spot which he liked the best.  The donkey lay down in the yard.  The dog lay behind the door.  The cat curled himself in front of the fire, while the cock flew up on a high beam.  They soon fell fast asleep.   THE FOUR FRIENDS--III  When all was still and the light was out, the robber chief sent one of his bravest men back to the house.  The man found the house quiet, so he went into the kitchen to strike a light.  Seeing the great fiery eyes of the cat, he thought they were live coals and held a match to them.  Puss was so angry that he flew up and scratched the man's face. This gave the robber a great fright, and he ran for the door.  As he went by, the dog sprang up and bit him in the leg.  In the yard the robber ran into the donkey, who gave him a great kick.  The cock on the beam was waked by the! noise, and cried, \"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\"  The man ran as fast as his"]]]
