The procedure to be followed by the Committee was to consider the project in the order indicated in the memorandum: first \"enlightenment,\" then abolition of autonomy, and finally disabilities.  [Footnote 1: See above, p. 16, n. 1.]   2. UVAROV AND LILIENTHAL  An elaborate _expos√©_ on the question of enlightenment was composed and laid before the Committee by the Minister of Public Instruction, Sergius Uvarov. Having acquired the _bon ton_ of Western Europe, Uvarov prefaces his statement by the remark that the European governments have abandoned the method of \"persecution and compulsion\" in solving the Jewish question and that \"this period has also arrived for us.\" \"Nations,\" observes Uvarov, \"are not exterminated, least of all the nation which stood at the foot of Calvary.\" From what follows, it seems evident that the Minister is still in hopes that the gentle measures of enlightenment may attract the Jews towards the religion which derives its origin from Calvary.    The best among the Jews--he states--are conscious of the fact that   one of the principal causes of their humiliation lies in the   perverted interpretation of their religious traditions, that ... the   Talmud demoralized and continues to demoralize their   co-religionists. But nowhere is the influence of the Talmud so   potent as among us (in Russia) and in the Kingdom of Poland. [1]   This influence can be counteracted only by enlightenment, and the   Government can do no better than to act in the spirit that animates   the handful of the best among them.... The re-education of the   learned section among the Jews involves at the same time the   purification of their religious conceptions.  [Footnote 1: See on the meaning of the latter term Vol. I, p. 390, n. 1.]  What \"purification\" the author of the memorandum has in mind may be gathered from his casual remark that the Jews, who maintain their separatism, are rightly afraid of reforms: \"for is not the religion of the Cross the purest symbol of universal citizenship?\" This, however, Uvarov cautiously adds, should not be made public, for \"it would have no other effect except that of arousing from the very beginning the opposition of the majority of the Jews against the (projected) schools.\"  Officially the reform must confine itself to the opening in all the cities of the Jewish Pale of elementary and secondary schools in which Jewish children should be taught the Russian language, secular sciences, Hebrew, and \"religion, according to the Holy Writ.\" The instruction should be given in Russian, though, owing to the shortage in teachers familiar with this language, the use of German is to be admitted temporarily. The teachers in the low-grade schools shall provisionally be recruited from among melammeds who \"can be depended upon\"; those in the higher-grade schools shall be chosen from among the modernized Jews of Russia and Germany.  The Committee endorsed Uvarov's scheme in its principal features, and urgently recommended that, in order to prepare the Jewish masses for the impending reform, a special propagandist be sent into the Pale of Settlement for the purpose of acquainting this obstreperous nation with \"the benevolent intentions of the Government.\" Such a propagandist was soon found in the person of a young German Jew, Dr. Max Lilienthal, a resident of Riga.  Lilienthal; who was a native of Bavaria (he was born in Munich in 1815) and a German university graduate, was a typical representative of the German Jewish intellectuals of that period, a champion of assimilation and of moderate religious reform. Lilienthal had scarcely completed his university course, when he was offered by a group of educated Jews in Riga the post of preacher and director of the new local Jewish school, one of the three modern Jewish schools then in existence in Russia.[1] In a short time Lilienthal managed to raise the instruction in secular and Jewish subjects to such a high standard of modernity that he elicited a glowing tribute from Uvarov. The Minister was struck by the idea that the Riga school might serve as a model for the net of schools with which he was about to cover the whole Pale of Settlement, and Lilienthal seemed the logical man for carrying out the planned reforms.  [Footnote 1: The other two schools were located in Odessa and in Kishinev.]  In February, 1841, Lilienthal was summoned to St. Petersburg, where he had a prolonged conversation with Uvarov. According to the testimony of the official Russian sources, he tried to persuade the Minister to abolish all \"private schools,\" the heders, and to forbid all private teachers, the melammeds, to teach even temporarily in the projected new schools, and to import, instead, the whole teaching staff from Germany. Lilienthal himself tells us in his Memoirs that he made bold to remind the Minister that all obstacles in the path of the desired re-education of the Russian Jews would disappear, were the Tzar to grant them complete emancipation. To this the Minister retorted that the initiative must come from the Jews themselves who first must try to \"deserve the favor of the Sovereign.\" At any rate, Lilienthal accepted the proffered task. He was commissioned to tour the Pale of Settlement, to organize there the few isolated progressive Jews, \"the lovers of enlightenment,\" or Maskilim, as they styled themselves, and to propagate the idea of a school-reform among the orthodox Jewish masses.  While setting out on his journey, Lilienthal himself did not fully realize the difficulties of the task he had undertaken. He was to instill confidence in the \"benevolent intentions of the Government\" into the hearts of a people which by an uninterrupted series of persecutions and cruel restrictions had been reduced to the level of pariahs. He was to make them believe that the Government was a well-wisher of Jewish children, those same children, who at that very time were hunted like wild beasts by the \"captors\" in the streets of the Pale, who were turned by the thousands into soldiers, deported into outlying provinces, and belabored in such a manner that scarcely half of them remained alive and barely a tenth remained within the Jewish fold. Guided by an infallible instinct, the plain Jewish people formulated their own simplified theory to account for the step taken by the Government: up to the present their children had been baptized through the barracks, in the future they would be baptized through the additional medium of the school.  Lilienthal arrived in Vilna in the beginning of 1842, and, calling a meeting of the Jewish Community, explained the plan conceived by the Government and by Uvarov, \"the friend of the Jews.\" He was listened to with unveiled distrust.    The elders--Lilienthal tells us in his Memoirs [1]--sat there   absorbed in deep contemplation. Some of them, leaning on their   silver-adorned staffs or smoothing their long beards, seemed as if   agitated by earnest thoughts and justifiable suspicions; others were   engaging in a lively but quiet discussion on the principles   involved; such put to me the ominous question: \"Doctor, are you   fully acquainted with the leading principles of our government? You   are a stranger; do you know what you are undertaking? The course   pursued against all denominations but the Greek proves clearly that   the Government intends to have but one Church in the whole Empire;   that it has in view only its own future strength and greatness and   not our own future prosperity. We are sorry to state that we put no   confidence in the new measures proposed by the ministerial council,   and that we look with gloomy foreboding into the future.\"  [Footnote 1: I quote from _Max Lilienthal, American Rabbi, Life and Writings_, by David Philipson, New York, 1915, p, 264.]  In his reply Lilienthal advanced an impressive array of arguments:    What will you gain by your resistance to the new measures? It will   only irritate the Government, and will determine it to pursue its   system of repression, while at present you are offered an   opportunity to prove that the Jews are not enemies of culture and   deserve a better lot.  When questioned as to whether the Jewish community had any guarantee that the Government plan was not a veiled attempt to undermine the Jewish religion, Lilienthal, by way of reply, solemnly pledged himself to throw up his mission the moment he would find that the Government associated with it secret intentions against Judaism. [1] The circle of \"enlightened\" Jews in Vilna pledged its support to Lilienthal, and he left full of faith in the success of his enterprise.  [Footnote 1: Op. Cit. p. 266.]  A cruel disappointment awaited him in Minsk. Here the arguments which the opponents advanced in a passionate debate at a public meeting were of a utilitarian rather than of an idealistic nature.    So long as the Government does not accord equal rights to the Jew,   general culture will only he his misfortune. The plain uneducated   Jew does not balk at the low occupation of factor [1] or peddler,   for, drawing comfort and joy from his religion, he is reconciled to   his miserable lot. But the Jew who is educated and enlightened, and   yet has no means of occupying an honorable position in the country,   will be moved by a feeling of discontent to renounce his religion,   and no honest father will think of giving an education to his   children which may lead to such an issue.

THE WAR MEETING  The Town Hall in Rossville stands on a moderate elevation overlooking the principal street. It is generally open only when a meeting has been called by the Selectmen to transact town business, or occasionally in the evening when a lecture on temperance or a political address is to be delivered. Rossville is not large enough to sustain a course of lyceum lectures, and the townspeople are obliged to depend for intellectual nutriment upon such chance occasions as these. The majority of the inhabitants being engaged in agricultural pursuits, the population is somewhat scattered, and the houses, with the exception of a few grouped around the stores, stand at respectable distances, each encamped on a farm of its own.  One Wednesday afternoon, toward the close of September, 1862, a group of men and boys might have been seen standing on the steps and in the entry of the Town House. Why they had met will best appear from a large placard, which had been posted up on barns and fences and inside the village store and postoffice.  It ran as follows:       WAR MEETING!  The citizens of Rossville are invited to meet at the Town Hall, on Wednesday, September 24, at 3 P. M. to decide what measures shall be taken toward raising the town's quota of twenty-five men, under the recent call of the President of the United States. All patriotic citizens, who are in favor of sustaining the free institutions transmitted to us by our fathers, are urgently invited to be present.  The Hon. Solomon Stoddard is expected to address the meeting.  Come one, come all.   At the appointed hour one hundred and fifty men had assembled in the hall. They stood in groups, discussing the recent call and the general management of the war with that spirit of independent criticism which so eminently characterizes the little democracies which make up our New England States.  ‚ÄúThe whole thing has been mismanaged from the first,‚Äù remarked a sapient-looking man with a gaunt, cadaverous face, addressing two listeners. ‚ÄúThe Administration is corrupt; our generals are either incompetent or purposely inefficient. We haven't got an officer that can hold a candle to General Lee. Abraham Lincoln has called for six hundred thousand men. What'll he do with 'em when he gets 'em? Just nothing at all. They'll melt away like snow, and then he'll call for more men. Give me a third of six hundred thousand, and I'll walk into Richmond in less'n thirty days.‚Äù  A quiet smile played over the face of one of the listeners. With a slight shade of irony in his voice he said, ‚ÄúIf such are your convictions, Mr. Holman, I think it a great pity that you are not in the service. We need those who have clear views of what is required in the present emergency. Don't you intend to volunteer?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI!‚Äù exclaimed the other with lofty scorn. ‚ÄúNo, sir; I wash my hands of the whole matter. I ain't clear about the justice of warring upon our erring brethren at all. I have no doubt they would be inclined to accept overtures of peace if accompanied with suitable concessions. Still, if war must be waged, I believe I could manage matters infinitely better than Lincoln and his cabinet have done.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWouldn't it be well to give them the benefit of your ideas on the subject?‚Äù suggested the other quietly.  ‚ÄúAhem!‚Äù said Mr. Holman, a little suspiciously.  ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, Mr. Frost?‚Äù  ‚ÄúOnly this, that if, like you, I had a definite scheme, which I thought likely to terminate the war, I should feel it my duty to communicate it to the proper authorities, that they might take it into consideration.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt wouldn't do any good,‚Äù returned Holman, still a little suspicious that he was quietly laughed at. ‚ÄúThey're too set in their own ways to be changed.‚Äù  At this moment there was a sharp rap on the table, and a voice was heard, saying, ‚ÄúThe meeting will please come to order.‚Äù  The buzz of voices died away; and all eyes were turned toward the speaker's stand.  ‚ÄúIt will be necessary to select a chairman to preside over your deliberations,‚Äù was next heard. ‚ÄúWill any one nominate?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI nominate Doctor Plunkett,‚Äù came from a man in the corner.  The motion was seconded, and a show of hands resulted in favor of the nominee.  A gentlemanly-looking man with a pleasant face advanced to the speaker's stand, and with a bow made a few remarks to this effect:  ‚ÄúFellow citizens: This is new business to me, as you are doubtless aware. My professional engagements have not often allowed me to take part in the meetings which from time to time you have held in this hall. On the present occasion, however, I felt it to be my duty, and the duty of every loyal citizen, to show by his presence how heartily he approves the object which has called us together. The same consideration will not suffer me to decline the unexpected responsibility which you have devolved upon me. Before proceeding farther, I would suggest that a clerk will be needed to complete the organization.‚Äù  A young man was nominated and elected without opposition.  Doctor Plunkett again addressed the meeting: ‚ÄúIt is hardly necessary,‚Äù  he said, ‚Äúto remind you of the object which has brought us together. Our forces in the field need replenishing. The Rebellion has assumed more formidable proportions than we anticipated. It is quite clear that we cannot put it down with one hand. We shall need both. Impressed with this conviction, President Lincoln has made an extraordinary levy upon the country. He feels that it is desirable to put down the Rebellion as speedily as possible, and not suffer it to drag through a series of years. But he cannot work single-handed. The loyal States must give their hearty cooperation. Our State, though inferior in extent and population to some others, has not fallen behind in loyal devotion. Nor, I believe, will Rossville be found wanting in this emergency. Twenty-five men have been called for. How shall we get them? This is the question which we are called upon to consider. I had hoped the Honorable Solomon Stoddard would be here to address you; but I regret to learn that a temporary illness will prevent his doing so. I trust that those present will not be backward in expressing their opinions.‚Äù  Mr. Holman was already on his feet. His speech consisted of disconnected remarks on the general conduct of the war, mingled with severe denunciation of the Administration.  He had spoken for fifteen minutes in this strain, when the chairman interfered----  ‚ÄúYour remarks are out of order, Mr. Holman. They are entirely irrelevant to the question.‚Äù  Holman wiped his cadaverous features with a red silk pocket-handkerchief, and inquired, sarcastically, ‚ÄúAm I to understand that freedom of speech is interdicted in this hall?‚Äù  ‚ÄúFreedom of speech is in order,‚Äù said the chairman calmly, ‚Äúprovided the speaker confines himself to the question under discussion. You have spoken fifteen minutes without once touching it.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI suppose you want me to praise the Administration,‚Äù said Holman, evidently thinking that he had demolished the chairman. He looked around to observe what effect his shot had produced.  ‚ÄúThat would be equally out of order,‚Äù ruled the presiding officer. ‚ÄúWe have not assembled to praise or to censure the Administration, but to consider in what manner we shall go to work to raise our quota.‚Äù  Holman sat down with the air of a martyr.  Mr. Frost rose next. It is unnecessary to report his speech. It was plain, practical, and to the point. He recommended that the town appropriate a certain sum as bounty money to volunteers. Other towns had done so, and he thought with good reason. It would undoubtedly draw in recruits more rapidly.  A short, stout, red-faced man, wearing gold spectacles, rose hastily.  ‚ÄúMr. Chairman,‚Äù he commenced, ‚ÄúI oppose that suggestion. I think it calculated to work serious mischief. Do our young men need to be hired to fight for their country? I suppose that is what you call patriotism. For my part, I trust the town will have too much good sense to agree to any such proposition. The consequence of it would be to plunge us into debt, and increase our taxes to a formidable amount.‚Äù  It may be remarked that Squire Haynes, the speaker, was the wealthiest man in town, and, of course, would be considerably affected by increased taxation. Even now he never paid his annual tax-bill without an inward groan, feeling that it was so much deducted from the sum total of his property.  Mr. Frost remained standing while Squire Haynes was speaking, and at the close continued his speech:  ‚ÄúSquire Haynes objects that my proposition, if adopted, will make our taxes heavier. I grant it: but how can we expect to carry on this gigantic war without personal sacrifices? If they only come in the form of money, we may account ourselves fortunate. I take it for granted that there is not a man here present who does not approve the present war--who does not feel that we are waging it for good and sufficient reasons.‚Äù  Here Mr. Holman moved uneasily in his seat, and seemed on the point of interrupting the speaker, but for some reason forbore.  ‚ÄúSuch being the case, we cannot but feel that the burden ought to fall upon the entire community, and not wholly upon any particular portion. The heaviest sacrifices must undoubtedly be made by those who leave their homes and peril life and limb on the battlefield. When I propose that you should lighten that sacrifice so far as it lies in your power, by voting them a bounty, it is because I consider that money will compensate them for the privations they must encounter and the perils they will incur. For that, they must look to the satisfaction that will arise from the feeling that they have responded to their country's call, and done something to save from ruin the institutions which our fathers transmitted as a sacred trust to their descendants. Money cannot pay for loss of life or limb. But some of"]]]
