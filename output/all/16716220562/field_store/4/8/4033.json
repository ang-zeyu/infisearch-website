Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!       Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,       Hither, hither, haste away!       One and all, come help me quick,       Haste ye, haste ye--pick, pick, pick!\"  Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; and next came the turtle-doves; and after them all the little birds under heaven came chirping and hopping about, and flew down about the ashes; and the little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain into the dishes, and left all the ashes, Before half-an-hour's time all was done, and out they flew again. And then Cinderella took the dishes to her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball. But her mother said, \"It is all of no use, you cannot go, you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame:\" and off she went with her two daughters to the feast.  Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Cinderella went sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out--        \"Shake, shake, hazel tree,       Gold and silver over me!\"  Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree and brought a gold and silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them on, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her, and thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and beautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Cinderella, but took for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.  [Illustration: _Painted by Jennie Harbour_ CINDERELLA]   [Illustration]  The king's son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced with her and no one else; and he never left her hand; but when any one else came to ask her to dance, he said, \"This lady is dancing with me.\" Thus they danced till a late hour of the night, and then she wanted to go home: and the king's son said, \"I shall go and take care of you to your home;\" for he wanted to see where the beautiful maid lived. But she slipped away from him unawares, and ran off towards home, and the prince followed her; but she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut the door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that the unknown maiden who had been at the feast had hidden herself in the pigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one within; and as they came back into the house, Cinderella lay as she always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little lamp burnt in the chimney; for she had run as quickly as she could through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken off her beautiful clothes, and laid them beneath the tree, that the bird might carry them away, and had seated herself amid the ashes again in her little old frock.  The next day, when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and sisters were gone, Cinderella went to the hazel tree, and said--        \"Shake, shake, hazel tree,       Gold and silver over me!\"  And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she had worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, every one wondered at her beauty; but the king's son, who was waiting for her, took her by the hand, and danced with her; and when any one asked her to dance, he said as before, \"This lady is dancing with me.\" When night came she wanted to go home; and the king's son followed her as before, that he might see into what house she went; but she sprang away from him, all at once, into the garden behind her father's house. In this garden stood a fine large pear tree full of ripe fruit; and Cinderella, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without being seen. Then the king's son could not find out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said to him, \"The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I think she must have sprung into the pear tree.\" The father thought to himself, \"Can it be Cinderella?\" So he ordered an axe to be brought; and they cut down the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into the kitchen, there lay Cinderella in the ashes as usual; for she had slipped down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes back to the bird at the hazel tree, and then put on her little old frock.  The third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone she went again into the garden, and said---        \"Shake, shake, hazel tree,       Gold and silver over me!\"  Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the former ones, and slippers which were all of gold; so that when she came to the feast no one knew what to say for wonder at her beauty; and the king's son danced with her alone; and when any one else asked her to dance he said, \"This lady is my partner.\" Now when night came she wanted to go home; and the king's son would go with her, and said to himself, \"I will not lose her this time;\" but, however, she managed to slip away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped her left golden slipper upon the stairs.  [Illustration: \"SHE SPRANG AWAY FROM HIM, ALL AT ONCE, INTO THE GARDEN BEHIND HER FATHER'S HOUSE.\"]  So the prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father, and said, \"I will take for my wife the lady that this golden shoe fits.\" Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear this; for they had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden slipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then the mother gave her a knife, and said, \"Never mind, cut it off; when you are queen you will not care about toes, you will not want to go on foot.\" So the silly girl cut her great toe off, and squeezed the shoe on, and went to the king's son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her beside him on his horse and rode away with her. But on their way home they had to pass by the hazel tree that Cinderella had planted and there sat a little dove on the branch singing---        \"Back again! back again! look to the shoe!       The shoe is too small, and not made for you!       Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,       For she's not the true one that sits by thy side.\"  Then the prince got down and looked at her foot, and saw by the blood that streamed from it what a trick she had played him. So he turned his horse round and brought the false bride back to her home, and said, \"This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put on the slipper.\" Then she went into the room and got her foot into the shoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it in till the blood came, and took her to the king's son; and he set her as his bride beside him on his horse, and rode away with her. But when they came to the hazel tree the little dove sat there still, and sang--        \"Back again! back again! look to the shoe!       The shoe is too small, and not made for you!       Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,       For she's not the true one that sits by thy side.\"  [Illustration]  Then he looked down and saw that the blood streamed so from the shoe that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse and brought her back again also. \"This is not the true bride,\" said he to the father; \"have you no other daughters?\" \"No,\" said he; \"there is only a little dirty Cinderella here, the child of my first wife; I am sure she cannot be the bride.\" However, the prince told him to send her. But the mother said, \"No, no, she is much too dirty, she will not dare to show herself;\" still the prince would have her come. And she first washed her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he handed to her the golden slipper.  Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot and put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made for her. And when the Prince drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and said, \"This is the right bride.\"  But the mother and both the sisters were frightened and turned pale with anger as he took Cinderella on his horse, and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel tree, the white dove sang--        \"Home! home! look at the shoe!       Princess! the shoe was made for you!       Prince! prince! take home thy bride.       For she is the true one that sits by thy side!\"  And when the dove had done its song, it came flying and perched upon her shoulder, and so went home with her.     PRINCESS GOLDENHAIR   There was once a King's daughter who was the most beautiful thing in the world, and as her hair was fair and reached to her feet she was called the Princess Goldenhair.  A handsome young King in the neighbourhood, although he had never seen this Princess, fell so deeply in love with her from what he had heard, that he could neither eat nor sleep.  So an ambassador was sent with a magnificent chariot, more than a hundred horses, and fifty pages, to bring the Princess to the King, and great preparations were made for her reception.  [Illustration: \"AN AMBASSADOR WAS SENT WITH MORE THAN A HUNDRED HORSES, AND FIFTY PAGES TO BRING THE PRINCESS TO THE KING.\"]  But whether the Princess Goldenhair was in an ill humour when the ambassador arrived at her Court, or whatever was the reason, certain it is that she sent a message to the young King thanking him but saying that she did not wish to marry.  When the King heard of her refusal he wept like a child.  Now at his Court there was a young man called Avenant. He was as beautiful as the sun, and a more finely made fellow than any in the kingdom; everybody loved him except a few envious"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15145"],["title","My Book of Favourite Fairy Tales (#4)"],["body","le, who were angry because the King favoured and confided in him, and in the presence of these, one day, Avenant incautiously remarked,  \"If the King had sent me to fetch the Princess Goldenhair, I am certain she would have come,\" and these words were repeated to the King in such a manner that they made him very angry, and he ordered Avenant to be shut up in a high tower, to die of hunger.  In this sad plight, Avenant exclaimed one day, \"How have I offended his Majesty? He has no more faithful subject than I.\"  The King who happened to be passing by the tower, heard this; he called for Avenant to be brought forth who, throwing himself on his knees, begged to know in what way he had offended his royal master.  \"You mocked me,\" said the King, \"you said that you would have succeeded with the Princess Goldenhair where I have failed.\"  \"It is true, sir,\" replied Avenant, \"I did say so, for I would have represented your noble qualities in such a way, that she could not help being persuaded.\"  The King was convinced of the young man's sincerity, and with a letter of introduction, Avenant set out for the Court of the goldenhaired beauty, riding alone, according to his wish, and thinking as he went how he best could woo the Princess for his beloved master.  One day, alighting from his horse to write down some suitable words that had come into his mind, he saw a golden carp who, leaping from the water to catch flies, had thrown herself upon the river bank, and was now nearly dead.  Avenant pitied the poor thing, and put her carefully back into the water. Recovering directly, the carp dived to the bottom, but returning to the edge of the river, said,  \"Avenant, I thank you; you have saved my life, I will repay you;\" then she swam off leaving the young man in great astonishment.  Another day as Avenant journeyed he noticed a raven who was pursued by an eagle. \"What right has that eagle to persecute the raven? thought Avenant, and he drew his bow and shot the fierce bird. The raven perched on a bough and cried.  \"Avenant you have saved my life, I will not be ungrateful, I will repay you.\"  [Illustration]  Not long after this, Avenant found an owl caught in a snare, he cut the strings, and freed the trembling captive. \"Avenant,\" said the owl, \"you have saved my life, I will repay you.\"  These three adventures were the most important that befell Avenant, and he went on his way, shortly before he arrived at his destination purchasing a beautiful little dog named Cabriole.  When Avenant reached the Palace of the Princess Goldenhair, and saw the Princess seated upon her throne, she looked so lovely that at first all his fine speeches forsook him, and he could not utter a word; however, taking courage, he addressed her in exquisitely chosen language, begging her to become the King's bride.  To this the Princess replied most graciously, saying that his petition moved her more than any other could do, \"but know,\" she added, \"as I was walking by the river a month ago, as I took off my glove, a ring, that I greatly value, fell into the water, and I have vowed that I will not heed any proposal of marriage, except from the ambassador who brings me back my ring.\"  Sad at heart Avenant left the Palace, but his little dog, Cabriole, said, \"My dear master, do not despair, you are too good to be unhappy. Early to-morrow morning let us go to the river-side.\" Avenant patted him, but did not answer, and, still sad, fell asleep.  As soon as it was day, Cabriole awoke him saying, \"Dress yourself, my master, and come out.\"  They wandered down to the river, and there Avenant heard a voice calling him, and what should he see but the golden carp, with the Princess's ring in her mouth. \"Take it, dear Avenant,\" said she, \"I promised to repay you for saving my life, and now I can fulfil my promise.\"  Thanking her a thousand times, Avenant, going at once to the Palace, said, \"Princess, your command is fulfilled; may it please you to receive the King, my master, as your husband.\"  The Princess thought she must be dreaming when she saw the ring, but she set Avenant another task.  \"Not far from here there is a prince named Galifron,\" said she; \"he wishes to marry me, and threatens to ravish my kingdom if I refuse; but how can I accept him? He is a giant, taller than my highest tower, he eats a man as a monkey would eat a chestnut, and when he speaks, his voice is so loud that it deafens those who hear him. He will not take my refusal, but kills my subjects. You must fight and bring me his head.\"  [Illustration]  \"Well, madam,\" replied Avenant, \"I will fight Galifron; I expect I shall be killed, but I shall die a brave man.\" And, taking Cabriole, Avenant set out for Galifron's country, asking news of the giant as he went along, and the more he heard the more he feared him, but Cabriole reassured him. \"My dear master,\" said the little dog, \"while you are fighting him I will bite his legs, then he will stoop to chase me, and you will kill him.\" Avenant admired the bravery of the little dog, but he knew his help would not be sufficient.  Presently they perceived how the roads were covered with the bones of the men that Galifron had eaten, and soon they saw the giant coming towards them through a wood. His head was higher than the highest trees, and he sang in a terrific voice:        \"Where are the children small, so small,       With my teeth I will crush them all,       On so many would I feed, feed, feed.       The whole world can't supply my need.\"  Using the same tune, Avenant began to sing:        \"Look down, here is Avenant beneath, beneath       He will draw from your head, the teeth, the teeth       Although he is not very big, 'tis true,       He is able to fight with such as you.\"  The giant put himself into a terrible passion, and would have killed Avenant with one blow, only a raven from above flew at his head, and pecked him straight in the eyes, so violently that he was blinded. He began striking out on all sides, but Avenant avoided his blows, and with his sword pierced him so many times that at last he fell to the ground. Then Avenant cut off his head, and the raven, who had perched on a tree, said,  \"I have not forgotten how you rescued me from the eagle; I promised to repay you, I think I have done so to-day.\"  \"I owe everything to you, Mr. Raven,\" responded Avenant, as, holding Galifron's head, he rode off.  When he entered the town, crowds followed him crying, \"Here is the brave Avenant who has slain the monster.\"  Avenant advanced to the Princess, and said, \"Madam, your enemy is dead. I hope you will no more refuse the King, my master.\"  \"Although it is so,\" answered the Princess, \"I shall refuse him unless you will bring me some water from the Grotto of Darkness. At the entrance there are two dragons, with fire in their eyes and mouths; inside the grotto there is a deep pit into which you must descend, it is full of toads, scorpions, and serpents. At the bottom of this pit there is a little cave where flows the fountain of beauty and health. Positively I must possess the water; all who wash in it, if they are beautiful, continue so always, if they are ugly they become beautiful; if they are young they remain young, if they are old they regain their youth. You cannot wonder, Avenant, that I will not leave my kingdom without taking it with me.\"  So once more Avenant and Cabriole set out; they journeyed on until they came to a rock, black as ink, from which smoke was issuing, and a moment later there appeared one of the dragons belching forth fire from his eyes and mouth. He was a frightful looking creature with a green and yellow body, and his tail was so long that it went into a hundred curves. Avenant saw all this, but resolved to die, he drew his sword, and, carrying the flask the Princess had given to him to hold the water, he said to Cabriole:  \"My days are ended, I can never obtain that water the dragons are guarding; when I am dead, fill this flask with my blood and carry it to the Princess, that she may know what it has cost me, then go to the King, my master, and tell him of my misfortune.\"  As he was speaking, a voice called, \"Avenant, Avenant,\" and looking around he saw an owl. \"You saved my life from the fowlers,\" said the owl. \"I promised to repay you, the time has now come. Give me your flask. I will bring you the water of beauty.\"  And carrying the flask, the owl entered the grotto, unhindered, returning in less than a quarter of an hour with it full to the brim. Avenant thanked the owl heartily, and joyously started for the town, where he presented the flask to the Princess, who immediately gave orders to prepare for her departure.  But as she considered Avenant altogether charming, before she set out, she several times said to him: \"If you wish, we need not go, for I will make you king of my country.\" But Avenant made reply:  \"I would not displease my master for all the kingdoms of earth, although your beauty I consider greater than that of the sun.\"  Thus they arrived at the King's capital, and the wedding took place amidst great rejoicings; but Princess Goldenhair, who loved Avenant from the depths of her heart, was not happy unless she could see him, and was for ever singing his praises. \"I should not have come, had it not been for Avenant,\" she told the King, \"you ought to be very much obliged to him.\" Then the envious courtiers counselled the King, and Avenant was cast once more into the tower, chained hand and foot. When Princess Goldenhair heard of this imprisonment, she fell on her knees before the King, and begged for Avenant's release; but he would not heed her, so that she became saddened and would speak no more.  Then the King thought: \"Maybe I am not handsome enough to please her!\" so he determined to wash his face in the water of beauty.  Now it had happened that a chamber-maid had broken the flask containing this wonderful water, so that it was all spilled; then, without saying anything to anyone, she had "]]]
