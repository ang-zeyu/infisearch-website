It was a     strange dispensation of Providence.      On Saturday the sad news of their capture came to my ears. We     had resolved to go to their aid on Monday, as the trial was set     for Thursday. On Sabbath, I spoke from Psalm xii. 5. \"For the     oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I     arise,\" saith the Lord: \"I will set him in safety from him that     puffeth at (from them that would enslave) him.\" When on Monday     morning I learned that the fugitives had passed through the     place on Sabbath, and Concklin in chains, probably at the very     time I was speaking on the subject referred to, my heart sank     within me. And even yet, I cannot but exclaim, when I think of     it--O, Father! how long ere Thou wilt arise to avenge the wrongs     of the poor slave! Indeed, my dear brother, His ways are very     mysterious. We have the consolation, however, to know that all     is for the best. Our Redeemer does all things well. When He hung     upon the cross, His poor broken hearted disciples could not     understand the providence; it was a dark time to them; and yet     that was an event that was fraught with more joy to the world     than any that has occurred or could occur. Let us stand at our     post and wait God's time. Let us have on the whole armor of God,     and fight for the right, knowing, that though we may fall in     battle, the victory will be ours, sooner or later.              *       *       *       *       *       May God lead you into all truth, and sustain you in your labors,     and fulfill your prayers and hopes. Adieu.      N.R. JOHNSTON.     LETTERS FROM LEVI COFFIN.   The following letters on the subject were received from the untiring and devoted friend of the slave, Levi Coffin, who for many years had occupied in Cincinnati a similar position to that of Thomas Garrett in Delaware, a sentinel and watchman commissioned of God to succor the fleeing bondman--       CINCINNATI, 4TH MO., 10TH, 1851.      FRIEND WM. STILL:--We have sorrowful news from our friend     Concklin, through the papers and otherwise. I received a letter     a few days ago from a friend near Princeton, Ind., stating that     Concklin and the four slaves are in prison in Vincennes, and     that their trial would come on in a few days. He states that     they rowed seven days and nights in the skiff, and got safe to     Harmony, Ind., on the Wabash river, thence to Princeton, and     were conveyed to Vincennes by friends, where they were taken.     The papers state, that they were all given up to the Marshal of     Evansville, Indiana.      We have telegraphed to different points, to try to get some     information concerning them, but failed. The last information is     published in the _Times_ of yesterday, though quite incorrect in     the particulars of the case. Inclosed is the slip containing it.     I fear all is over in regard to the freedom of the slaves. If     the last account be true, we have some hope that Concklin will     escape from those bloody tyrants. I cannot describe my feelings     on hearing this sad intelligence. I feel ashamed to own my     country. Oh! what shall I say. Surely a God of justice will     avenge the wrongs of the oppressed.      Thine for the poor slave,      LEVI COFFIN.      N.B.--If thou hast any information, please write me forthwith.          CINCINNATI, 5TH MO., 11TH, 1851.      WM. STILL:--_Dear Friend_--Thy letter of 1st inst., came duly to     hand, but not being able to give any further information     concerning our friend, Concklin, I thought best to wait a little     before I wrote, still hoping to learn something more definite     concerning him.      We that became acquainted with Seth Concklin and his hazardous     enterprises (here at Cincinnati), who were very few, have felt     intense and inexpressible anxiety about them. And particularly     about poor Seth, since we heard of his falling into the hands of     the tyrants. I fear that he has fallen a victim to their inhuman     thirst for blood.      I seriously doubt the rumor, that he had made his escape. I fear     that he was sacrificed.      Language would fail to express my feelings; the intense and deep     anxiety I felt about them for weeks before I heard of their     capture in Indiana, and then it seemed too much to bear. O! my     heart almost bleeds when I think of it. The hopes of the dear     family all blasted by the wretched blood-hounds in human shape.     And poor Seth, after all his toil, and dangerous, shrewd and     wise management, and almost unheard of adventures, the many     narrow and almost miraculous escapes. Then to be given up to     Indianians, to these fiendish tyrants, to be sacrificed. O!     Shame, Shame!!      My heart aches, my eyes fill with tears, I cannot write more. I     cannot dwell longer on this painful subject now. If you get any     intelligence, please inform me. Friend N.R. Johnston, who took     so much interest in them, and saw them just before they were     taken, has just returned to the city. He is a minister of the     Covenanter order. He is truly a lovely man, and his heart is     full of the milk of humanity; one of our best Anti-Slavery     spirits. I spent last evening with him. He related the whole     story to me as he had it from friend Concklin and the mother and     children, and then the story of their capture. We wept together.     He found thy letter when he got here.      He said he would write the whole history to thee in a few days,     as far as he could. He can tell it much better than I can.      Concklin left his carpet sack and clothes here with me, except a     shirt or two he took with him. What shall I do with them? For if     we do not hear from him soon, we must conclude that he is lost,     and the report of his escape all a hoax.      Truly thy friend,      LEVI COFFIN.   Stunning and discouraging as this horrible ending was to all concerned, and serious as the matter looked in the eyes of Peter's friends with regard to Peter's family, he could not for a moment abandon the idea of rescuing them from the jaws of the destroyer. But most formidable difficulties stood in the way of opening correspondence with reliable persons in Alabama. Indeed it seemed impossible to find a merchant, lawyer, doctor, planter or minister, who was not too completely interlinked with slavery to be relied upon to manage a negotiation of this nature. Whilst waiting and hoping for something favorable to turn up, the subjoined letter from the owner of Peter's family was received and is here inserted precisely as it was written, spelled and punctuated--    McKIERNON'S LETTER.

To say that it     took me by surprise, as well as afforded me pleasure, for which     I feel to be very much indebted to you, is no more than true. In     regard to your informants of myself--Mr. Thornton, of Ala., and     Mr. Samuel Lewis, of Cincinnati--to them both I am a stranger.     However, I am the brother of Peter, referred to, and with the     fact of his having a wife and three children in your"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15263"],["title","The Underground Railroad (#7)"],["body","I     am also familiar. This brother, Peter, I have only had the     pleasure of knowing for the brief space of one year and thirteen     days, although he is now past forty and I twenty-nine years of     age. Time will not allow me at present, or I should give you a     detailed account of how Peter became a slave, the forty long     years which intervened between the time he was kidnapped, when a     boy, being only six years of age, and his arrival in this city,     from Alabama, one year and fourteen days ago, when he was     re-united to his mother, five brothers and three sisters.      None but a father's heart can fathom the anguish and sorrows     felt by Peter during the many vicissitudes through which he has     passed. He looked back to his boyhood and saw himself snatched     from the tender embraces of his parents and home to be made a     slave for life.      During all his prime days he was in the faithful and constant     service of those who had no just claim upon him. In the     meanwhile he married a wife, who bore him eleven children, the     greater part of whom were emancipated from the troubles of life     by death, and three only survived. To them and his wife he was     devoted. Indeed I have never seen attachment between parents and     children, or husband and wife, more entire than was manifested     in the case of Peter.      Through these many years of servitude, Peter was sold and     resold, from one State to another, from one owner to another,     till he reached the forty-ninth year of his age, when, in a good     Providence, through the kindness of a friend and the sweat of     his brow, he regained the God-given blessings of liberty. He     eagerly sought his parents and home with all possible speed and     pains, when, to his heart's joy, he found his relatives.      Your present humble correspondent is the youngest of Peter's     brothers, and the first one of the family he saw after arriving     in this part of the country. I think you could not fail to be     interested in hearing how we became known to each other, and the     proof of our being brothers, etc., all of which I should be most     glad to relate, but time will not permit me to do so. The news     of this wonderful occurrence, of Peter finding his kindred, was     published quite extensively, shortly afterwards, in various     newspapers, in this quarter, which may account for the fact of     \"Miller's\" knowledge of the whereabouts of the \"fugitives.\" Let     me say, it is my firm conviction that no one had any hand in     persuading \"Miller\" to go down from Cincinnati, or any other     place, after the family. As glad as I should be, and as much as     I would do for the liberation of Peter's family (now no longer     young), and his three \"likely\" children, in whom he prides     himself--how much, if you are a father, you can imagine; yet I     would not, and could not, think of persuading any friend to     peril his life, as would be the case, in an errand of that kind.      As regards the price fixed upon by you for the family, I must     say I do not think it possible to raise half that amount, though     Peter authorized me to say he would give you twenty-five hundred     for them. Probably he is not as well aware as I am, how     difficult it is to raise so large a sum of money from the     public. The applications for such objects are so frequent among     us in the North, and have always been so liberally met, that it     is no wonder if many get tired of being called upon. To be sure     some of us brothers own some property, but no great amount;     certainly not enough to enable us to bear so great a burden.     Mother owns a small farm in New Jersey, on which she has lived     for nearly forty years, from which she derives her support in     her old age. This small farm contains between forty and fifty     acres, and is the fruit of my father's toil. Two of my brothers     own small places also, but they have young families, and     consequently consume nearly as much as they make, with the     exception of adding some improvements to their places.      For my own part, I am employed as a clerk for a living, but my     salary is quite too limited to enable me to contribute any great     amount towards so large a sum as is demanded. Thus you see how     we are situated financially. We have plenty of friends, but     little money. Now, sir, allow me to make an appeal to your     humanity, although we are aware of your power to hold as     property those poor slaves, mother, daughter and two sons,--that     in no part of the United States could they escape and be secure     from your claim--nevertheless, would your understanding, your     heart, or your conscience reprove you, should you restore to     them, without price, that dear freedom, which is theirs by right     of nature, or would you not feel a satisfaction in so doing     which all the wealth of the world could not equal? At all     events, could you not so reduce the price as to place it in the     power of Peter's relatives and friends to raise the means for     their purchase? At first, I doubt not, but that you will think     my appeal very unreasonable; but, sir, serious reflection will     decide, whether the money demanded by you, after all, will be of     as great a benefit to you, as the satisfaction you would find in     bestowing so great a favor upon those whose entire happiness in     this life depends mainly upon your decision in the matter. If     the entire family cannot be purchased or freed, what can Vina     and her daughter be purchased for? Hoping, sir, to hear from     you, at your earliest convenience, I subscribe myself,      Your obedient servant, WM. STILL.      To B. McKiernon, Esq.   No reply to this letter was ever received from McKiernon. The cause of his reticence can be as well conjectured by the reader as the writer.  Time will not admit of further details kindred to this narrative. The life, struggles, and success of Peter and his family were ably brought before the public in the \"Kidnapped and the Ransomed,\" being the personal recollections of Peter Still and his wife \"Vina,\" after forty years of slavery, by Mrs. Kate E.R. Pickard; with an introduction by Rev. Samuel J. May, and an appendix by William H. Furness, D.D., in 1856. But, of course it was not prudent or safe, in the days of Slavery, to publish such facts as are now brought to light; all such had to be kept concealed in the breasts of the fugitives and their friends.  [Illustration: PETER STILL ]   [Illustration: CHARITY STILL ]  The following brief sketch, touching the separation of Peter and his mother, will fitly illustrate this point, and at the same time explain certain mysteries which have been hitherto kept hidden--    THE SEPARATION.   With regard to Peter's separation from his mother, when a little boy, in few words, the facts were these: His parents, Levin and Sidney, were both slaves on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. \"I will die before I submit to the yoke,\" was the declaration of his father to his young master before either was twenty-one years of age. Consequently he was allowed to buy himself at a very low figure, and he paid the required sum and obtained his \"free papers\" when quite a young man--the young wife and mother remaining in slavery under Saunders Griffin, as also her children, the latter having increased to the number of four, two little boys and two little girls. But to escape from chains, stripes, and bondage, she took her four little children and fled to a place near Greenwich, New Jersey. Not a great while, however, did she remain there in a state of freedom before the slave-hunters pursued her, and one night they pounced upon the whole family, and, without judge or jury, hurried them all back to slavery. Whether this was kidnapping or not is for the reader to decide for himself.  Safe back in the hands of her owner, to prevent her from escaping a second time, every night for about three months she was cautiously \"kept locked up in the garret,\" until, as they supposed, she was fully \"cured of the desire to do so again.\" But she was incurable. She had been a witness to the fact that her own father's brains had been blown out by the discharge of a heavily loaded gun, deliberately aimed at his head by his drunken master. She only needed half a chance to make still greater struggles than ever for freedom.  She had great faith in God, and found much solace in singing some of the good old Methodist tunes, by day and night. Her owner, observing this apparently tranquil state of mind, indicating that she \"seemed better contented than ever,\" concluded that it was safe to let the garret door remain unlocked at night. Not many weeks were allowed to pass before she resolved to again make a bold strike for freedom. This time she had to leave the two little boys, Levin and Peter, behind.  On the night she started she went to the bed where they were sleeping, kissed them, and, consigning them into the hands of God, bade her mother good-bye, and with her two little girls wended her way again to Burlington County, New Jersey, but to a different neighborhood from that where she had been seized. She changed her name to Charity, and succeeded in again joining her husband, but, alas, with the heart-breaking thought that she had been compelled to leave her two little boys in slavery and one of the little girls on the road for the father to go back after. Thus she began life in freedom anew.  Levin and Peter, eight and six years of age respectively, were now left at the mercy of the enraged owner, and were soon hurried off to a Southern market and sold, while their mother, for whom they were daily weeping, was they knew not where. They were too young to know that they were slaves, or to understand the nature of the afflicting separation. Sixteen years before Peter's return, his older brother (Levin) died a slave in the State of"]]]
