I used to work for a man who had a hand organ, and he used to take me around with him to climb up on the porches, and in the second-story windows to get the pennies from the children. Well, I always loved music, and I wanted the man to let me play his organ, but he never would. So I made up my mind I would save up all my pennies and some day buy an organ for myself.  \"Well, I did that, for you know often when I used to go around to collect pennies for the man, some children would give me a few for myself. Finally I got rich and I didn't work for the man any longer, and I had enough to buy five hand organs, for I can play five at once. Then I came here, and built this shingle house and every day I amuse myself by playing tunes, and I never have to climb up the rainwater pipe to get money. Oh, it is a happy life,\" and the monkey felt so funny that he hung by his tail from a tree branch, and made faces at Uncle Wiggily--just in fun, you understand.  Uncle Wiggily was very glad he had met the monkey, and he listened to the music, and the monkey even let the rabbit play one tune for himself, and it was called, \"When You Wiggle Your Wiggily Ears Wiggle Them Good and Hard.\"  And then, all of a sudden, just as that tune was finished, there was a terrible noise in the bushes.  \"My goodness! What's that?\" cried the monkey as he hopped up on top of one of his hand organs and curled his tail around the handle.  \"It sounds like a bear!\" said the rabbit. \"But don't worry. I'll do just as the cricket did to the alligator and make him laugh so that he won't hurt us.\"  \"Good!\" cried the monkey. And then the noise became louder and out from the bushes popped a big animal. But it was an elephant instead of a bear, and as soon as he saw the monkey and Uncle Wiggily he ran up to them and shook his trunk at them and cried:  \"Oh, I'm so glad to see you! I just got away from the circus, and I want to have some fun!\" and he was as kind and gentle as he could be and he and Uncle Wiggily had quite an adventure the next day.  I'll tell you about it on the next page, when, in case the little boy across the street doesn't tickle my pussy cat and make him sneeze the rubbers off the umbrella plant, the story will be about Uncle Wiggily and the big dog.     STORY XIII  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BIG DOG   Let's see, I left off in the last story just where the elephant came out of the woods and shook his tail--I mean his trunk--at Uncle Wiggily and the funny monkey, didn't I? Well, now, I'm going to tell you what happened after that.  \"Why did you run away from the circus?\" asked the old gentleman rabbit of the elephant. \"I should think you would like it there. I know Sammie and Susie Littletail would love a circus.\"  \"Yes, some folks like it,\" spoke the elephant slow and thoughtful-like, as he sat down on his trunk, \"but I do not care for it. You see of late the children ate all the peanuts, instead of giving me my share, and I just couldn't stand it any longer. Why, it got so, finally, that when a man would give his little boy five cents to buy a bag of peanuts for me the little boy would eat all but two or three of the nuts, and those were all he gave to me. It wasn't enough, so I ran away.\"  \"I don't in the least blame you,\" said the monkey, \"and I'm going to let you play some of my hand organs.\"  Well, the elephant was delighted at that, and he played one organ with his trunk and another one with his tail, making some very nice music.  Uncle Wiggily stayed in the monkey's house that night, and the elephant wanted to come in also, but of course he was far too big, so he had to sleep outside under a tree. It was an apple tree, and in the middle of the night the elephant snored so hard and heavily through his trunk that he shook the tree and all the apples fell off, and in the morning the monkey made an apple pie from some of them.  \"I think I had better start off on my travels again,\" said the old gentleman rabbit after breakfast. \"There must be a fortune for me somewhere if I can only find it. So I'll trot along.\"  \"I'll go with you,\" said the kind elephant. \"Perhaps you might see your fortune in the top of a tall tree, and then you couldn't get it. But I would pull the tree down for you.\"  \"That would be fine!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. \"I'll be glad to have you travel with me.\"  So they said good-by to the monkey, and off they started together, the rabbit and the elephant. They talked of many things, about how hot it was, and whether there would be rain soon, and about how much ice cream cones cost, and sometimes what a little bit of ice cream the man puts in the cones when he is in a hurry.  \"Speaking of ice cream cones,\" said the elephant, \"makes me hungry for some. I wish I had one.\"  \"I wish I had one also,\" spoke Uncle Wiggily. \"You would have to have a very large one, though, Mr. Elephant, but a small one would do for me.\"  \"Don't say another word,\" cried the elephant as he waved his trunk in the air. \"I'm going right off and get us some ice cream cones. I know where there's a store. You hop along slowly and I'll catch up to you.\"  So the elephant went off to the ice cream cone store, and Uncle Wiggily, with his valise and the barber pole crutch, hopped on through the woods, looking about to see if his fortune was up in any of the trees, but it wasn't there yet.  Well, pretty soon, in a little while, not so very long, all of a sudden the old gentleman rabbit heard a sniffing-sniffing noise in the woods. And then there was a rustling in the bushes.  \"Ha, hum!\" exclaimed the rabbit. \"Perhaps that may be a bear. I had better look out for myself.\"  He started to hop softly away, so the bear, or whatever it was, wouldn't hear him, but he was too late. In an instant out of the bushes popped something big and black and shaggy, and the rabbit, taking one look at it, saw that it was a big dog.  \"New is the time for me to run!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. \"That dog will eat me up, sure pop!\"  Away hopped the old gentleman rabbit, his heart going \"pitter-patter-pat,\" he was so frightened. On and on he ran down a path in the woods.  \"Here, come back here! Come back!\" cried the dog.  \"Indeed, I will not,\" answered Uncle Wiggily. \"I know what you want to do. You want to eat me.\"  \"No, I don't, honestly!\" cried the dog. \"But come back, for if you run any farther on that road you'll fall into a lake and be drowned.\"  \"Humph! I don't believe that!\" cried the rabbit. \"You are saying that to scare me,\" and on he hopped faster than ever.  \"Come back! Come back!\" cried the dog again, but Uncle Wiggily wouldn't. My! how fast he did hop, until, all of a sudden, as he returned around the corner of a stump, he saw a lake of water right in front of him. And before he could stop himself he had fallen plump into it; crutch, satchel and all, and of course he couldn't swim. And he could hear the dog coming barking down the path after him.  \"Oh, this is the end of me, sure pop!\" thought poor Uncle Wiggily. \"I'll never get any fortune now.\"  \"Oh, dear!\" cried the dog. \"I told you how it would be. I tried to save you from getting in the water,\" and then the rabbit knew the big dog had been telling the truth. But it was too late now. Uncle Wiggily was going down under the deep, dark, cold water when, all of a sudden, along came the elephant with a great big ice cream cone for himself, and a little one for Uncle Wiggily. He saw the rabbit in the water and he also saw the big shaggy dog.  \"Did you push Uncle Wiggily in the water?\" asked the elephant, \"because if you did I'm going to throw you in.\"  \"No, indeed, I didn't,\" answered the dog. \"It was an accident,\" and he told the elephant how it happened. \"But I'll jump in, grab him and swim out with him,\" said the dog.  \"No, don't do that, you might accidentally bite him,\" spoke the elephant. \"I have a better plan.\" So he laid down the ice cream cones and then he put the end of his hollow trunk in the lake, and he began to suck up and drink the water, just as you suck lemonade up through a straw.  And presto chango! in a few seconds all the water was sucked out of the lake by the elephant, and it was dry land and the rabbit could walk safely to shore, and so he wasn't drowned after all. And how he did thank the elephant! Uncle Wiggily ate his ice cream cone, and the elephant gave some of his to the dog, and they were all happy.  Now, if the elephant doesn't get a sliver in his foot so he can't dance at the hoptoads' picnic, I'll tell you in the next story about Uncle Wiggily and the peanut man.     STORY XIV  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE PEANUT MAN   After Uncle Wiggily and the elephant and the big dog had eaten up the ice cream cones, they sat in the woods a while and looked at the place where the watery lake had been before the elephant drank it up to save the rabbit from drowning.  \"My, but you must be strong to take up all that water,\" said the dog.  \"Yes, I guess I am pretty strong,\" said the elephant, though he was not at all proud-like. \"I will show you how I can pull up a tree,\" he said. So he wound his trunk around a big tree and he gave one great, heaving pull and up that tree came by the roots. Then, all of a sudden a voice cried:  \"Oh, you're upsetting all my eggs!\" and a robin, who had her nest in the tree, fluttered around feeling very sad.  \"Oh, excuse me, Mrs. Robin,\" said the elephant. \"I would not have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15284"],["title","The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original lovely illustrations.

Frederick Warne & Co., Inc. New York  1918     TO AESOP IN THE SHADOWS     Johnny Town-mouse was born in a cupboard. Timmy Willie was born in a garden. Timmy Willie was a little country mouse who went to town by mistake in a hamper. The gardener sent vegetables to town once a week by carrier; he packed them in a big hamper.  The gardener left the hamper by the garden gate, so that the carrier could pick it up when he passed. Timmy Willie crept in through a hole in the wicker-work, and after eating some peas--Timmy Willie fell fast asleep.  He awoke in a fright, while the hamper was being lifted into the carrier's cart. Then there was a jolting, and a clattering of horse's feet; other packages were thrown in; for miles and miles--jolt--jolt--jolt! and Timmy Willie trembled amongst the jumbled up vegetables.  At last the cart stopped at a house, where the hamper was taken out, carried in, and set down. The cook gave the carrier sixpence; the back door banged, and the cart rumbled away. But there was no quiet; there seemed to be hundreds of carts passing. Dogs barked; boys whistled in the street; the cook laughed, the parlour maid ran up and down-stairs; and a canary sang like a steam engine.  Timmy Willie, who had lived all his life in a garden, was almost frightened to death. Presently the cook opened the hamper and began to unpack the vegetables. Out sprang the terrified Timmy Willie.  Up jumped the cook on a chair, exclaiming \"A mouse! a mouse! Call the cat! Fetch me the poker, Sarah!\" Timmy Willie did not wait for Sarah with the poker; he rushed along the skirting board till he came to a little hole, and in he popped.  He dropped half a foot, and crashed into the middle of a mouse dinner party, breaking three glasses.--\"Who in the world is this?\" inquired Johnny Town-mouse. But after the first exclamation of surprise he instantly recovered his manners.  With the utmost politeness he introduced Timmy Willie to nine other mice, all with long tails and white neckties. Timmy Willie's own tail was insignificant. Johnny Town-mouse and his friends noticed it; but they were too well bred to make personal remarks; only one of them asked Timmy Willie if he had ever been in a trap?  The dinner was of eight courses; not much of anything, but truly elegant. All the dishes were unknown to Timmy Willie, who would have been a little afraid of tasting them; only he was very hungry, and very anxious to behave with company manners. The continual noise upstairs made him so nervous, that he dropped a plate. \"Never mind, they don't belong to us,\" said Johnny.  \"Why don't those youngsters come back with the dessert?\" It should be explained that two young mice, who were waiting on the others, went skirmishing upstairs to the kitchen between courses. Several times they had come tumbling in, squeaking and laughing; Timmy Willie learnt with horror that they were being chased by the cat. His appetite failed, he felt faint. \"Try some jelly?\" said Johnny Town-mouse.  \"No? Would you rather go to bed? I will show you a most comfortable sofa pillow.\"  The sofa pillow had a hole in it. Johnny Town-mouse quite honestly recommended it as the best bed, kept exclusively for visitors. But the sofa smelt of cat. Timmy Willie preferred to spend a miserable night under the fender.  It was just the same next day. An excellent breakfast was provided--for mice accustomed to eat bacon; but Timmy Willie had been reared on roots and salad. Johnny Town-mouse and his friends racketted about under the floors, and came boldly out all over the house in the evening. One particularly loud crash had been caused by Sarah tumbling downstairs with the tea-tray; there were crumbs and sugar and smears of jam to be collected, in spite of the cat.  Timmy Willie longed to be at home in his peaceful nest in a sunny bank. The food disagreed with him; the noise prevented him from sleeping. In a few days he grew so thin that Johnny Town-mouse noticed it, and questioned him. He listened to Timmy Willie's story and inquired about the garden. \"It sounds rather a dull place? What do you do when it rains?\"  \"When it rains, I sit in my little sandy burrow and shell corn and seeds from my Autumn store. I peep out at the throstles and blackbirds on the lawn, and my friend Cock Robin. And when the sun comes out again, you should see my garden and the flowers--roses and pinks and pansies--no noise except the birds and bees, and the lambs in the meadows.\"  \"There goes that cat again!\" exclaimed Johnny Town-mouse. When they had taken refuge in the coal-cellar he resumed the conversation; \"I confess I am a little disappointed; we have endeavoured to entertain you, Timothy William.\"  \"Oh yes, yes, you have been most kind; but I do feel so ill,\" said Timmy Willie.  \"It may be that your teeth and digestion are unaccustomed to our food; perhaps it might be wiser for you to return in the hamper.\"  \"Oh? Oh!\" cried Timmy Willie.  \"Why of course for the matter of that we could have sent you back last week,\" said Johnny rather huffily--\"did you not know that the hamper goes back empty on Saturdays?\"  So Timmy Willie said good-bye to his new friends, and hid in the hamper with a crumb of cake and a withered cabbage leaf; and after much jolting, he was set down safely in his own garden.  Sometimes on Saturdays he went to look at the hamper lying by the gate, but he knew better than to get in again. And nobody got out, though Johnny Town-mouse had half promised a visit.  The winter passed; the sun came out again; Timmy Willie sat by his burrow warming his little fur coat and sniffing the smell of violets and spring grass. He had nearly forgotten his visit to town. When up the sandy path all spick and span with a brown leather bag came Johnny Town-mouse!  Timmy Willie received him with open arms. \"You have come at the best of all the year, we will have herb pudding and sit in the sun.\"  \"H'm'm! it is a little damp,\" said Johnny Town-mouse, who was carrying his tail under his arm, out of the mud.  \"What is that fearful noise?\" he started violently.  \"That?\" said Timmy Willie, \"that is only a cow; I will beg a little milk, they are quite harmless, unless they happen to lie down upon you. How are all our friends?\"  Johnny's account was rather middling. He explained why he was paying his visit so early in the season; the family had gone to the sea-side for Easter; the cook was doing spring cleaning, on board wages, with particular instructions to clear out the mice. There were four kittens, and the cat had killed the canary.  \"They say we did it; but I know better,\" said Johnny Town-mouse. \"Whatever is that fearful racket?\"  \"That is only the lawn-mower; I will fetch some of the grass clippings presently to make your bed. I am sure you had better settle in the country, Johnny.\"  \"H'm'm--we shall see by Tuesday week; the hamper is stopped while they are at the sea-side.\"  \"I am sure you will never want to live in town again,\" said Timmy Willie.  But he did. He went back in the very next hamper of vegetables; he said it was too quiet!!  One place suits one person, another place suits another person. For my part I prefer to live in the country, like Timmy Willie."]]]
