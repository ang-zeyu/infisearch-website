And though it comes accompany’d with two _disadvantages_, the _meanness_ of the _Author_, and of the _Subject_; yet in both I am _incouraged_ by the _greatness_ of your _Mercy_ and your _Knowledge_. By the _one_ I am taught, that you can _forgive_ the most _presumptuous Offendors_: And by the _other_, that you will not _esteem_ the least work of _Nature_, or _Art_, unworthy your _Observation_. Amidst the many _felicities_ that have accompani’d _your Majesties_ happy _Restauration_ and _Government_, it is none of the least considerable that _Philosophy_ and _Experimental Learning_ have _prosper’d_ under your _Royal Patronage_. And as the calm prosperity of your Reign has given us the _leisure_ to follow these _Studies_ of _quiet_ and _retirement_, so it is just, that the _Fruits_ of them should, by way of _acknowledgement_, be return’d to _your Majesty_. There are, Sir, several other of your Subjects, of your _Royal Society_, now busie about _Nobler_ matters: The _Improvement_ of _Manufactures_ and _Agriculture_, the _Increase_ of _Commerce_, the _Advantage_ of _Navigation_: In all which they are _assisted_ by _your Majesties Incouragement_ and _Example_. Amidst all those _greater_ Designs, I here presume to bring in that which is more _proportionable_ to the _smalness_ of my Abilities, and to offer some of the _least_ of all _visible things_, to that _Mighty King_, that has _establisht an Empire_ over the best of all _Invisible things_ of this World, the _Minds_ of Men.  Your Majesties most humble and most obedient Subject and Servant,  ROBERT HOOKE.         *       *       *       *       *  TO THE  ROYAL SOCIETY.  After my _Address_ to our _Great Founder_ and _Patron_, I could not but think my self oblig’d, in consideration of those _many Ingagements_ you have laid upon me, to offer these my _poor Labours_ to this MOST ILLUSTRIOUS ASSEMBLY. YOU have been pleas’d formerly to accept of these rude _Draughts_. I have since added to them some _Descriptions_, and some _Conjectures_ of my own. And therefore, together with YOUR _Acceptance_, I must also beg YOUR _pardon_. The Rules YOU have prescrib’d YOUR selves in YOUR Philosophical Progress do seem the best that have ever yet been practis’d. And particularly that of avoiding _Dogmatizing_, and the _espousal_ of any _Hypothesis_ not sufficiently grounded and confirm’d by _Experiments_. This way seems the most excellent, and may preserve both _Philosophy_ and _Natural History_ from its former _Corruptions_. In saying which, I may seem to condemn my own Course in this Treatise; in which there may perhaps be some _Expressions_, which may seem more _positive_ then YOUR Prescriptions will permit: And though I desire to have them understood only as _Conjectures_ and _Quæries_ (which YOUR Method does not altogether disallow) yet if even in those I have exceeded, ’tis fit that I should declare, that it was not done by YOUR Directions. For it is most unreasonable, that YOU should undergo the _imputation_ of the _faults_ of my _Conjectures_, seeing YOU can receive so _small advantage_ of reputation by the _sleight Observations_ of  YOUR most humble and most faithful Servant  ROBERT HOOKE.         *       *       *       *       *   THE  PREFACE.  It is the great prerogative of Mankind above other Creatures, that we are not only able to _behold_ the works of Nature, or barely to _sustein_ our lives by them, but we have also the power of _considering_, _comparing_, _altering_, _assisting_, and _improving_ them to various uses. And as this is the peculiar priviledge of humane Nature in general, so is it capable of being so far advanced by the helps of Art, and Experience, as to make some Men excel others in their Observations, and Deductions, almost as much as they do Beasts. By the addition of such _artificial Instruments_ and _methods_, there may be, in some manner, a reparation made for the mischiefs, and imperfection, mankind has drawn upon it self, by negligence, and intemperance, and a wilful and superstitious deserting the Prescripts and Rules of Nature, whereby every man, both from a deriv’d corruption, innate and born with him, and from his breeding and converse with men, is very subject to slip into all sorts of errors.  The only way which now remains for us to recover some degree of those former perfections, seems to be, by rectifying the operations of the _Sense_, the _Memory_, and _Reason_, since upon the evidence, the _strength_, the _integrity_, and the _right correspondence_ of all these, all the light, by which our actions are to be guided is to be renewed, and all our command over things is to be establisht.  It is therefore most worthy of our consideration, to recollect their several defects, that so we may the better understand how to supply them, and by what assistances we may _inlarge_ their power, and _secure_ them in performing their particular duties.  As for the actions of our _Senses_, we cannot but observe them to be in many particulars much outdone by those of other Creatures, and when at best, to be far short of the perfection they seem capable of: And these infirmities of the Senses arise from a double cause, either from the _disproportion of the Object to the Organ_, whereby an infinite number of things can never enter into them, or else from _error in the Perception_, that many things, which come within their reach, are not received in a right manner.  The like frailties are to be found in the _Memory;_ we often let many things _slip away_ from us, which deserve to be retain’d, and of those which we treasure up, a great part is either _frivolous_ or _false_; and if good, and substantial, either in tract of time _obliterated_, or at best so _overwhelmed_ and buried under more frothy notions, that when there is need of them, they are in vain sought for.  The two main foundations being so deceivable, it is no wonder, that all the succeeding works which we build upon them, of arguing, concluding, defining, judging, and all the other degrees of Reason, are lyable to the same imperfection, being, at best, either vain, or uncertain: So that the errors of the _understanding_ are answerable to the two other, being defective both in the quantity and goodness of its knowledge; for the limits, to which our thoughts are confin’d, are small in respect of the vast extent of Nature it self; some parts of it are _too large_ to be comprehended, and some _too little_ to be perceived. And from thence it must follow, that not having a full sensation of the Object, we must be very lame and imperfect in our conceptions about it, and in all the proportions which we build upon it; hence, we often take the _shadow_ of things for the _substance_, small _appearances_ for good _similitudes_, _similitudes_ for _definitions;_ and even many of those, which we think, to be the most solid definitions, are rather expressions of our own misguided apprehensions then of the true nature of the things themselves.  The effects of these imperfections are manifested in different ways, according to the temper and disposition of the several minds of men, some they incline to _gross ignorance_ and stupidity, and others to a _presumptuous imposing_ on other mens Opinions, and a _confident dogmatizing_ on matters, whereof there is no assurance to be given.  Thus all the uncertainty, and mistakes of humane actions, proceed either from the narrowness and wandring of our _Senses_, from the slipperiness or delusion of our _Memory_, from the confinement or rashness of our _Understanding_, so that ’tis no wonder, that our power over natural causes and effects is so slowly improv’d, seeing we are not only to contend with the obscurity and _difficulty of the things_ whereon we work and think, but even the _forces of our own minds_ conspire to betray us.  These being the dangers in the process of humane Reason, the remedies of them all can only proceed from the _real_, the _mechanical_, the _experimental_ Philosophy, which has this advantage over the Philosophy of _discourse_ and _disputation_, that whereas that chiefly aims at the subtilty of its Deductions and Conclusions, without much regard to the first ground-work, which ought to be well laid on the Sense and Memory; so this intends the right"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15491"],["title","Micrographia (#1)"],["body","of them all, and the making them serviceable to each other.  The first thing to be undertaken in this weighty work, is a _watchfulness over the failings_ and an _inlargement of the dominion_, of the Senses.  To which end it is requisite, first, That there should be a _scrupulous_ choice, and a _strict examination_, of the reality, constancy, and certainty of the Particulars that we admit: This is the first rise whereon truth is to begin, and here the most severe, and most impartial diligence, must be imployed; the storing up of all, without any regard to evidence or use, will only tend to darkness and confusion. We must not therefore esteem the riches of our Philosophical treasure by the _number_ only, but chiefly by the _weight_; the most _vulgar_ Instances are not to be neglected, but above all, the most _instructive_ are to be entertain’d; the footsteps of Nature are to be trac’d, not only in her _ordinary course_, but when she seems to be put to her shifts, to make many _doublings_ and _turnings_, and to use some kind of art in indeavouring to avoid our discovery.  The next care to be taken, in respect of the Senses, is a supplying of their infirmities with _Instruments_, and, as it were, the adding of _artificial Organs_ to the _natural_; this in one of them has been of late years accomplisht with prodigious benefit to all sorts of useful knowledge, by the invention of Optical Glasses. By the means of _Telescopes_, there is nothing so _far distant_ but may be represented to our view; and by the help of _Microscopes_, there is nothing so _small_, as to escape our inquiry; hence there is a new visible World discovered to the understanding. By this means the Heavens are open’d, and a vast number of new Stars, and new Motions, and new Productions appear in them, to which all the antient Astronomers were utterly Strangers. By this the Earth it self, which lyes so neer us, under our feet, shews quite a new thing to us, and in every _little particle_ of its matter; we now behold almost as great a variety of Creatures, as we were able before to reckon up in the whole _Universe_ it self.  It seems not improbable, but that by these helps the subtilty of the composition of Bodies, the structure of their parts, the various texture of their matter, the instruments and manner of their inward motions, and all the other possible appearances of things, may come to be more fully discovered; all which the antient _Peripateticks_ were content to comprehend in two general and (unless further explain’d) useless words of _Matter_ and _Form_. From whence there may arise many admirable advantages, towards the increase of the _Operative_, and the _Mechanick_ Knowledge, to which this Age seems so much inclined, because we may perhaps be inabled to discern all the secret workings of Nature, almost in the same manner as we do those that are the productions of Art, and are manag’d by Wheels, and Engines, and Springs, that were devised by humane Wit.  In this kind I here present to the World my imperfect Indeavours; which though they shall prove no other way considerable, yet, I hope, they may be in some measure useful to the main Design of a _reformation_ in Philosophy, if it be only by shewing, that there it not so much requir’d towards it, any strength of _Imagination_, or exactness of _Method_, or depth of _Contemplation_ (though the addition of these, where they can be had, must needs produce a much more perfect composure) as a sincere _Hand_, and a _faithful_ Eye, to examine, and to record, the things themselves as they appear.  And I beg my Reader, to let me take the boldness to assure him, that in this present condition of knowledge, a man so qualified, as I have indeavoured to be, only with resolution, and integrity, and plain intentions of imploying his _Senses_ aright, may venture to compare the reality and the usefulness of his services, towards the true Philosophy, with those of other men, that are of much stronger, and more acute _speculations_, that shall not make use of the same method by the Senses.  The truth is, the Science of Nature has been already too long made only a work of the _Brain_ and the _Fancy_: It is now high time that it should return to the plainness and soundness of _Observations_ on _material_ and _obvious_ things. It is said of great Empires, That _the best way to preserve them from decay, is to bring them back to the first Principles, and Arts, on which they did begin_. The same is undoubtedly true in Philosophy, that by wandring far away into _invisible Notions_, has almost quite destroy’d it self, and it can never be recovered, or continued, but by returning into the same _sensible paths_, in which it did at first proceed.  If therefore the Reader expects from me any infallible Deductions, or certainty of _Axioms_, I am to say for my self, that those stronger Works of Wit and Imagination are above my weak Abilities; or if they had not been so, I would not have made use of them in this present Subject before me: Whenever he finds that I have ventur’d at any small Conjectures, at the causes of the things that I have observed, I beseech him to look upon them only as _doubtful Problems_, and _uncertain ghesses_, and not as unquestionable Conclusions, or matters of unconfutable Science; I have produced nothing here, with intent to bind his understanding to an _implicit_ consent; I am so far from that, that I desire him, not absolutely to rely upon these Observations of my eyes, if he finds them contradicted by the future Ocular Experiments of sober and impartial Discoverers.  As for my part, I have obtained my end, if these my small Labours shall be thought fit to take up some place in the large stock of _natural Observations_, which so many hands are busie in providing. If I have contributed the _meanest foundations_ whereon others may raise nobler _Superstructures_, I am abundantly satisfied; and all my ambition is, that I may serve to the great Philosophers of this Age, as the makers and the grinders of my Glasses did to me; that I may prepare and furnish them with some _Materials_, which they may afterwards _order_ and _manage_ with better skill, and to far greater advantage.  The next remedies in this universal cure of the Mind are to be applied to the _Memory_, and they are to consist of such Directions as may inform us, what things are best to be _stor’d up_ for our purpose, and which is the best way of so _disposing_ them, that they may not only be _kept in safety_, but ready and convenient, to be at any time _produc’d_ for use, as occasion shall require. But I will not here prevent my self in what I may say in another Discourse, wherein I shall make an attempt to propose some Considerations of the manner of compiling a Natural and Artificial History, and of so ranging and registring its Particulars into Philosophical Tables, as may make them most useful for the raising of _Axioms_ and _Theories_.  The last indeed is the most _hazardous_ Enterprize, and yet the most _necessary_; and that is, to take such care that the _Judgment_ and the _Reason_ of Man (which is the third Faculty to be repair’d and improv’d) should receive such assistance, as to avoid the dangers to which it is by nature most subject. The Imperfections, which I have already mention’d, to which it is lyable, do either belong to the _extent_, or the _goodness_ of its knowledge; and here the difficulty is the greater, least that which may be thought a _remedy_ for the one should prove _destructive_ to the other, least by seeking to inlarge our Knowledge, we should render it weak and uncertain; and least by being too scrupulous and exact about every Circumstance of it, we should confine and streighten it too much.  In both these the middle wayes are to be taken, nothing is to be_ omitted_, and yet every thing to pass a _mature deliberation_: No _Intelligence_ from Men of all Professions, and quarters of the World, to be _slighted_, and yet all to be so _severely examin’d_, that there remain no room for doubt or instability; much _rigour_ in admitting, much _strictness_ in comparing, and above all, much _slowness_ in debating, and _shyness_ in determining, is to be practised. The _Understanding_ is to _order_ all the inferiour services of the lower Faculties; but yet it is to do this only as a _lawful Master_, and not as a _Tyrant._ It must not _incroach_ upon their Offices, nor take upon it self the employments which belong to either of them. It must _watch_ the irregularities of the Senses, but it must not go before them, or _prevent_ their information. It must _examine_, _range_, and _dispose_ of the bank which is laid up in the Memory: but it must be sure to make _distinction_ between the _sober_ and _well collected heap_, and the _extravagant Ideas_, and _mistaken Images_, which there it may sometimes light upon. So many are the _links_, upon which the true Philosophy depends, of which, if any one be _loose_, or _weak_, the whole _chain_ is in danger of being dissolv’d; it is to _begin_ with the Hands and Eyes, and to _proceed_ on through the Memory, to be _continued_ by the Reason; nor is it to stop there, but to _come about_ to the Hands and Eyes again, and so, by a _continual passage round_ from one Faculty to another, it is to be maintained in life and strength, as much as the body of man is by the _circulation_ of the blood through the several parts of the body, the Arms, the Feet, the Lungs, the Heart, and the Head.  If once this method were followed with diligence and attention, there is nothing that lyes within the power of human Wit (or which is far more effectual) of human Industry, which we might not compass; we might not only hope for Inventions to equalize those of _Copernicus_, _Galileo_, _Gilbert_, _Harvy_, and of others, whose Names are almost lost, that were the Inventors of _Gun-powder_, the _Seamans Compass_, _Printing_, _Etching_, _Graving_, _Microscopes_, &c. but multitudes that may far exceed them:"]]]
