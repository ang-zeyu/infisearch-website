Besides, there are a thousand opportunities that can be turned to account and influence. By wits and work, and with Good Luck to help him, many a poorer man than you has risen to greatness.\"  \"Wits and work!\" cried the indignant godson. \"You speak well--truly! A hillman would have made a better godfather. Give me as much gold as will fill three meal-bins, and you may keep the rest of your help for those who want it.\"  Now at this moment by Good Luck stood Dame Fortune. She likes handsome young men, and there was some little jealousy between her and the godfather so she smiled at the quarrel.  \"You would rather have had me for your gossip?\" said she.  \"If you would give me three wishes, I would,\" replied the farmer boldly, \"and I would trouble you no more.\"  \"Will you make him over to me?\" said Dame Fortune to the godfather.  \"If he wishes it,\" replied Good Luck. \"But if he accepts your gifts he has no further claim on me.\"  \"Nor on me either,\" said the Dame. \"Hark ye, young man, you mortals are apt to make a hobble of your three wishes, and you may end with a sausage at your nose, like your betters.\"  \"I have thought of it too often,\" replied the farmer, \"and I know what I want. For my first wish I desire imperishable beauty.\"  \"It is yours,\" said Dame Fortune, smiling as she looked at him.  \"The face of a prince and the manners of a clown are poor partners,\" said the farmer. \"My second wish is for suitable learning and courtly manners, which cannot be gained at the plough-tail.\"  \"You have them in perfection,\" said the Dame, as the young man thanked her by a graceful bow.  \"Thirdly,\" said he, \"I demand a store of gold that I can never exhaust.\"  \"I will lead you to it,\" said Dame Fortune; and the young man was so eager to follow her that he did not even look back to bid farewell to his godfather.  He was soon at court. He lived in the utmost pomp. He had a suit of armour made for himself out of beaten gold. No metal less precious might come near his person, except for the blade of his sword. This was obliged to be made of steel, for gold is not always strong enough to defend one's life or his honour. But the Princess still loved the Prince of Moonshine.  \"Stuff and nonsense!\" said the King. \"I shall give you to the Prince of Gold.\"  \"I wish I had the good luck to please her,\" muttered the young Prince. But he had not, for all his beauty and his wealth. However, she was to marry him, and that was something.  The preparations for the wedding were magnificent.  \"It is a great expense,\" sighed the King, \"but then I get the Prince of Gold for a son-in-law.\"  The Prince and his bride drove round the city in a triumphal procession. Her hair fell over her like sunshine, but the starlight of her eyes was cold.  In the train rode the Prince of Moonshine, dressed in silver, and with no colour in his face.  As the bridal chariot approached one of the city gates, two black ravens hovered over it, and then flew away, and settled on a tree.  Good Luck was sitting under the tree to see his godson's triumph, and he heard the birds talking above him.  \"Has the Prince of Gold no friend who can tell him that there is a loose stone above the archway that is tottering to fall?\" said they. And Good Luck covered his face with his mantle as the Prince drove through.  Just as they were passing out of the gateway the stone fell on to the Prince's head. He wore a casque of pure gold, but his neck was broken.       \"We can't have all this expense for nothing,\" said the King:     so he married his daughter to the Prince of Moonshine. If one     can't get gold one must be content with silver.   \"Will you come to the funeral?\" asked Dame Fortune of the godfather.  \"Not I,\" replied Good Luck. \"I had no hand in _this_ matter.\"  The rain came down in torrents. The black feathers on the ravens' backs looked as if they had been oiled.  \"Caw! caw!\" said they. \"It was an unlucky end.\"  However, the funeral was a very magnificent one, for there was no stint of gold.     THE HILLMAN AND THE HOUSEWIFE.   It is well known that the Good People cannot abide meanness. They like to be liberally dealt with when they beg or borrow of the human race; and, on the other hand, to those who come to them in need, they are invariably generous.  Now there once lived a certain Housewife who had a sharp eye to her own interests in temporal matters, and gave alms of what she had no use for, for the good of her soul. One day a Hillman knocked at her door.  \"Can you lend us a saucepan, good Mother?\" said he. \"There's a wedding in the hill, and all the pots are in use.\"  \"Is he to have one?\" asked the servant lass who had opened the door.  \"Aye, to be sure,\" answered the Housewife. \"One must be neighbourly.\"  But when the maid was taking a saucepan from the shelf, she pinched her arm, and whispered sharply--\"Not that, you slut! Get the old one out of the cupboard. It leaks, and the Hillmen are so neat, and such nimble workers, that they are sure to mend it before they send it home. So one obliges the Good People, and saves sixpence in tinkering. But you'll never learn to be notable whilst your head is on your shoulders.\"  Thus reproached, the maid fetched the saucepan, which had been laid by till the tinker's next visit, and gave it to the dwarf, who thanked her, and went away.  In due time the saucepan was returned, and, as the Housewife had foreseen, it was neatly mended and ready for use.  At supper-time the maid filled the pan with milk, and set it on the fire for the children's supper. But in a few minutes the milk was so burnt and smoked that no one could touch it, and even the pigs refused the wash into which it was thrown.  \"Ah, good-for-nothing hussy!\" cried the Housewife, as she refilled the pan herself, \"you would ruin the richest with your carelessness. There's a whole quart of good milk wasted at once!\"  \"_And that's twopence_,\" cried a voice which seemed to come from the chimney, in a whining tone, like some nattering, discontented old body going over her grievances.  The Housewife had not left the saucepan for two minutes, when the milk boiled over, and it was all burnt and smoked as before.  \"The pan must be dirty,\" muttered the good woman, in great vexation; \"and there are two full quarts of milk as good as thrown to the dogs.\"  \"_And that's fourpence_,\" added the voice in the chimney.  After a thorough cleaning, the saucepan was once more filled and set on the fire, but with no better success. The milk was hopelessly spoilt, and the housewife shed tears of vexation at the waste, crying, \"Never before did such a thing befall me since I kept house! Three quarts of new milk burnt for one meal!\"  \"_And that's sixpence_,\" cried the voice from the chimney. \"_You didn't save the tinkering after all Mother_!\"  With which the Hillman himself came tumbling down the chimney, and went off laughing through the door.  But thenceforward the saucepan was as good as any other.     THE NECK.  A Legend of a Lake.   On a certain lake there once lived a Neck, or Water Sprite, who desired, above all things, to obtain a human soul. Now when the sun shone this Neck rose up and sat upon the waves and played upon his harp. And he played so sweetly that the winds stayed to listen to him, and the sun lingered in his setting, and the moon rose before her time. And the strain was in praise of immortality.  Furthermore, out of the lake there rose a great rock, whereon dwelt an aged hermit, who by reason of his loneliness was afflicted with a spirit of melancholy; so that when the fit was on him, he was constantly tempted to throw himself into the water, for his life was burdensome to him. But one day, when this gloomy madness had driven him to the edge of the rock to cast himself down, the Neck rose at the same moment, and sitting upon a wave, began to play. And the strain was in praise of immortality. And the melody went straight to the heart of the hermit as a sunbeam goes into a dark cave, and it dispelled his gloom, and he thought all to be as well with him as before it had seemed ill. And he called to the Neck and said, \"What is that which thou dost play, my son?\"  And the Neck answered, \"It is in praise of immortality.\"  Then said the hermit, \"I beg that thou wilt play frequently beneath this rock; for I am an aged and solitary man, and by reason of my loneliness, life becomes a burden to me, and I am tempted to throw it away. But by this gracious strain the evil has been dispelled. Wherefore I beg thee to come often and to play as long as is convenient. And yet I cannot offer thee any reward, for I am poor and without possessions.\"  Then the Neck replied, \"There are treasures below the water as above, and I desire no earthly riches. But if thou canst tell me how I may gain a human soul, I will play on till thou shalt bid me cease.\"  And the hermit said, \"I must consider the matter. But I will return to-morrow at this time and answer thee.\"  Then the next day he returned as he had said, and the Neck was waiting impatiently on the lake, and he cried, \"What news, my father?\"  And the hermit said, \"If that at any time some human being will freely give his life for thee, thou wilt gain a human soul. But thou also must die the selfsame day.\"  \"The short life for the long one!\" cried the Neck; and he played a melody so full of happiness that the blood danced through the hermit's veins as if he were a boy again. But the next day when he came as usual the Neck called to him and said, \"My father, I have been thinking. Thou art aged and feeble, and at the most there are but few days of life remaining to thee. Moreover, by reason of thy loneliness even these are a burden. Surely there is none more fit than thou to be the means of procuring me a human soul. Wherefore I beg of thee, let us die to-day.\"  But the hermit cried out angrily, \"Wretch! Is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15592"],["title","Old-Fashioned Fairy Tales (#2)"],["body","thy gratitude? Wouldst thou murder me?\"  \"Nay, old man,\" replied the Neck, \"thou shalt part easily with thy little fag-end of life. I can play upon my harp a strain of such surpassing sadness that no human heart that hears it but must break. And yet the pain of that heartbreak shall be such that thou wilt not know it from rapture. Moreover, when the sun sets below the water, my spirit also will depart without suffering. Wherefore I beg of thee, let us die to-day.\"  \"Truly,\" said the hermit, \"it is because thou art only a Neck, and nothing better, that thou dost not know the value of human life.\"  \"And art thou a man, possessed already of a soul, and destined for immortality,\" cried the Neck, \"and dost haggle and grudge to benefit me by the sacrifice of a few uncertain days, when it is but to exchange them for the life that knows no end?\"  \"Our days are always uncertain,\" replied the hermit; \"but existence is very sweet, even to the most wretched. Moreover, I see not that thou hast any claim upon mine.\" Saying which he returned to his cell, but the Neck, flinging aside his harp, sat upon the water, and wept bitterly.  Days passed, and the hermit did not show himself, and at last the Neck resolved to go and visit him. So he took his harp, and taking also the form of a boy with long fair hair and a crimson cap, he appeared in the hermit's cell. There he found the old man stretched upon his pallet, for lie was dying. When he saw the Neck he was glad, and said, \"I have desired to see thee, for I repent myself that I did not according to thy wishes. Yet is the desire of life stronger in the human breast than thou canst understand. Nevertheless I am sorry, and I am sorry also that, as I am sick unto death, my life will no longer avail thee. But when I am dead, do thou take all that belongs to me, and dress thyself in my robe, and go out into the world, and do works of mercy, and perchance some one whom thou hast benefited will be found willing to die with thee, that thou mayst obtain a soul.\"  \"Now indeed I thank thee!\" cried the Neck. \"But yet one word more--what are these works of which thou speakest?\"  \"The corporal works of mercy are seven,\" gasped the hermit, raising himself on his arm. \"To feed the hungry and give the thirsty drink, to visit the sick, to redeem captives, to clothe the naked, to shelter the stranger and the houseless, to visit the widow and fatherless, and to bury the dead.\" Then even as he spoke the last words the hermit died. And the Neck clothed himself in his robe, and, not to delay in following the directions given to him, he buried the hermit with pious care, and planted flowers upon his grave. After which he went forth into the world.  Now for three hundred years did the Neck go about doing acts of mercy and charity towards men. And amongst the hungry, and the naked, and the sick, and the poor, and the captives, there were not a few who seemed to be weary of this life of many sorrows. But when he had fed the hungry, and clothed the naked, and relieved the sick, and made the poor rich, and set the captive free, life was too dear to all of them to be given up. Therefore he betook himself to the most miserable amongst men, and offering nothing but an easy death in a good cause, he hoped to find some aged and want-worn creature who would do him the kindness he desired. But of those who must look forward to the fewest days and to the most misery there was not one but, like the fabled woodcutter, chose to trudge out to the end his miserable span.  So when three hundred years were past, the Neck's heart failed him, and he said, \"All this avails nothing. Wherefore I will return to the lake, and there abide what shall befall.\" And this he accordingly did.  Now one evening there came a tempest down from the hills, and there was a sudden squall on the lake. And a certain young man in a boat upon the lake was overtaken by the storm. And as he struggled hard, and it seemed as if every moment must be his last, a young maid who was his sweetheart came down to the shore, and cried aloud in her agony, \"Alas, that his young life should be cut short thus!\"  \"Trouble not thyself,\" said the Neck; \"this life is so short and so uncertain, that if he were rescued to-day he might be taken from thee to-morrow. Only in eternity is love secure. Wherefore be patient, and thou shalt soon follow him.\"  \"And who art thou that mockest my sorrow?\" cried the maiden.  \"One who has watched the passing misfortunes of many generations before thine,\" replied the Neck.  And when the maiden looked, and saw one like a little old man wringing out his beard into the lake, she knew it was a Neck, and cried, \"Now surely thou art a Neck, and they say, 'When Necks play, the winds wisht;' wherefore I beg of thee to play upon thy harp, and it may be that the storm will lull, and my beloved will be saved.\"  But the Neck answered, \"It is not worth while.\"  And when the maiden could not persuade him, she fell upon her face in bitter grief, and cried, \"Oh, my Beloved! Would GOD I could die for thee!\"  \"And yet thou wouldst not if thou couldst,\" said the Neck.  \"If it be in thy power to prove me--prove me!\" cried the maiden; \"for indeed he is the only stay of aged parents, and he is young and unprepared for death. Moreover his life is dearer to me than my own.\"  Then the Neck related his own story, and said, \"If thou wilt do this for me, which none yet has done whom I have benefited, I will play upon my harp, and if the winds wisht, thou must die this easy death; but if I fail in my part, I shall not expect thine to be fulfilled. And we must both abide what shall befall, even as others.\" And to this the maiden consented most willingly. Only she said, \"Do this for me, I beg of thee. Let him come so near that I may just see his face before I die.\" And it was so agreed.  Then the aged Neck drew forth his harp and began to play. And as he played the wind stayed, as one who pauses to hearken with cleft lips, and the lake rose and fell gently, like the bosom of a girl moved by some plaintive song, and the sun burst forth as if to see who made such sweet music. And so through this happy change the young man got safe to land. Then the Neck turned to the maiden and said, \"Dost thou hold to thy promise?\" And she bowed her head.  \"In the long life be thy recompense!\" cried the Neck, fervently, and taking his harp again, he poured his whole spirit into the strain. And as he played, it seemed as if the night wind moaned among pine-trees, but it was more mournful. And it was as the wail of a mother for her only son, and yet fuller of grief. Or like a Dead March wrung from the heart of a great musician--loading the air with sorrow--and yet all these were as nothing to it for sadness. And when the maiden heard it, it was more than she could bear, and her heart broke, as the Neck had said. Then the young man sprang to shore, and when she could see his face clearly, her soul passed, and her body fell like a snapped flower to the earth.  Now when the young man knew what was befallen, he fell upon the Neck to kill him, who said, \"Thou mayest spare thyself this trouble, for in a few moments I shall be dead. But do thou take my robe and my harp, and thou shalt be a famous musician.\"  Now even as the Neck spoke the sun sank, and he fell upon his face. And when the young man lifted the robe, behold there was nothing under it but the harp, across which there swept such a wild and piteous chord that all the strings burst as if with unutterable grief.  Then the young man lifted the body of his sweetheart in his arms, and carried her home, and she was buried with many tears.  And in due time he put fresh strings to the harp, which, though it was not as when it was in the hands of the Neck, yet it made most exquisite music. And the young man became a famous musician. For out of suffering comes song.  Furthermore, he occupied himself in good works until that his time also came.         *       *       *       *       *  And in Eternity Love was made secure.     THE NIX IN MISCHIEF.   A certain lake in Germany was once the home of a Nix, who became tired of the monotony of life under water, and wished to go into the upper world and amuse himself.  His friends and relations all tried to dissuade him. \"Be wise,\" said they, \"and remain where you are safe, seeing that no business summons you from the lake. Few of our kindred have had dealings with the human race without suffering from their curiosity or clumsiness; and, do them what good you may, in the long run you will reap nothing but ingratitude. From how many waters have they not already banished us? Wherefore let well alone, and stay where you are.\"  But this counsel did not please the Nix--(as, indeed, there is no reason to suppose that advice is more palatable under water than on dry land)--and he only said, \"I shall not expect gratitude, for I have no intention of conferring benefits; but I wish to amuse myself. The Dwarfs and Kobolds play what pranks they please on men and women, and they do not always have the worst of it. When I hear of their adventures, the soles of my feet tingle. This is a sign of travelling, and am I to be debarred from fun because I live in a lake instead of a hill?\"  His friends repeated their warnings, but to no purpose. The Nix remained unconvinced, and spent his time in dreaming of the clever tricks by which he should outwit the human race, and the fame he would thereby acquire on his return to the lake.  Mischief seldom lacks opportunity, and shortly after this it happened that a young girl came down to the lake for water to wash with; and dipping her pail just above the Nix's head, in a moment he jumped in, and was brought safe to land. The maid was Bess, the washerwoman's daughter; and as she had had one good scolding that morning for oversleeping herself, and another about noon for dawdling with her work, she took up the pail and set off home without delay.  But though she held it "]]]
