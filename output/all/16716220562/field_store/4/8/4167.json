So Henry thought nothing       of it when the car came to a gentle stop.        The all-day storm blew from the west and the front windows of the       car were covered with snow so he could not see ahead. Some time       before the conductor and rear brakeman had gone forward to help       dig the engine out of the drift and they had not come back.        Henry sat in silence for some time watching the whirling snow. He       was sad; even the thought of the gifts of his father and friends       in his trunk which stood in the baggage compartment of the car       did not cheer him. More than all the Christmas gifts in the       world, he wanted at that time his mother and father and friends.        “It doesn’t look as though it was going to be a very merry       Christmas for me,” he said aloud at last, and then feeling a       little stiff from having sat still so long he got up and walked       to the front of the car.        It was warm and pleasant in the coach. The Baker heater was going       at full blast and Henry noticed that there was plenty of coal. He       tried to see out from the front door; but as he was too prudent       to open it and let in the snow and cold he could make out       nothing. The silence rather alarmed him. The train had never       waited so long before.        Then, suddenly, came the thought that something very unusual was       wrong. He must get a look at the train ahead. He ran back to the       rear door, opened it and standing on the leeward side, peered       forward. The engine and freight cars were not there! All he saw       was the deep cut filled nearly to the height of the car with       snow.        Henry was of a mechanical turn of mind and he realized that       doubtless the coupling had broken. That was what had happened.       The trainmen had not noticed it and the train had gone on and       left the coach. The break had occurred at the crest of the divide       and the train had gone rapidly down hill on the other side. The       amount of snow told the boy that it would not be possible for the       train to back up and pick up the car. He was alone in the       wilderness of rolling hills in far western Nebraska. And this was       Christmas Eve!        It was enough to bring despair to any boy’s heart. But Henry Ives       was made of good stuff, he was a first-class Boy Scout and on his       scout coat in the trunk were four Merit Badges. He had the spirit       of his father, who had often bucked the November storms on Lake       Superior in his great six-hundred-foot freighter, and danger       inspired him.        He went back into the car, closed the door, and sat down to think       it over. He had very vague ideas as to how long such a storm       would last and how long he might be kept prisoner. He did not       even know just where he was or how far it was to the end of the       road and the town where his uncle’s ranch lay.        It was growing dark so he lighted one of the lamps close to the       heater and had plenty of light. In doing so he noticed in the       baggage rack a dinner pail. He remembered that the conductor had       told him that his wife had packed that dinner pail and although       it did not belong to the boy he felt justified in appropriating       it in such circumstances. It was full of food—eggs, sandwiches,       and a bottle of coffee. He was not very hungry but he ate a       sandwich. He was even getting cheerful about the situation       because he had something to do. It was an adventure.        While he had been eating, the storm had died away. Now he       discovered that it had stopped snowing. All around him the       country was a hilly, rolling prairie. The cut ran through a hill       which seemed to be higher than others in the neighbourhood. If he       could get on top of it he might see where he was. Although day       was ending it was not yet dark and Henry decided upon an       exploration.        Now he could not walk on foot in that deep and drifted snow       without sinking over his head under ordinary conditions, but his       troop had done a great deal of winter work, and strapped       alongside of his big, telescope grip were a pair of snow-shoes       which he himself had made, and with the use of which he was       thoroughly familiar.        “I mustn’t spoil this new suit,” he told himself, so he ran to       the baggage-room of the car, opened his trunk, got out his Scout       uniform and slipped into it in a jiffy. “Glad I ran in that       ‘antelope dressing race,’” he muttered, “but I’ll beat my former       record now.” Over his khaki coat he put on his heavy sweater,       then donned his wool cap and gloves, and with his snow-shoes       under his arm hurried back to the rear platform. The snow was on       a level with the platform. It rose higher as the coach reached       into the cut. He saw that he would have to go down some distance       before he could turn and attempt the hill.        He had used his snow-shoes many times in play but this was the       first time they had ever been of real service to him. Thrusting       his toes into the straps he struck out boldly.  [Illustration: “Thrusting his toes into the straps he struck out boldly.”]        To his delight he got along without the slightest difficulty       although he strode with great care. He gained the level and in       ten minutes found himself on the top of the hill, where he could       see miles and miles of rolling prairie. He turned himself slowly       about, to get a view of the country.        As his glance swept the horizon, at first it did not fall upon a       single, solitary thing except a vast expanse of snow. There was       not a tree even. The awful loneliness filled him with dismay. He       had about given up when, in the last quarter of the horizon he       saw, perhaps a quarter of a mile away, what looked like a fine       trickle of blackish smoke that appeared to rise from a shapeless       mound that bulged above the monotonous level.        “Smoke means fire, and fire means man,” he said, excitedly.        The sky was rapidly clearing. A few stars had already appeared.       Remembering what he had learned on camp and trail, he took his       bearing by the stars; he did not mean to get lost if he left that       hill. Looking back, he could see the car, the lamp of which sent       broad beams of light through the windows across the snow.        Then he plunged down the hill, thanking God in his boyish heart       for the snow-shoes and his knowledge of them.        It did not take him long to reach the mound whence the smoke       rose. It was a sod house, he found, built against a sharp knoll,       which no doubt formed its rear wall. The wind had drifted the       snow, leaving a half-open way to the door. Noiselessly the boy       slipped down to it, drew his feet from the snow-shoes and       knocked. There was a burst of sound inside. It made his heart       jump, but he was reassured by the fact that the voices were those       of children. What they said he could not make out; but, without       further ado, he opened the door and entered.        It was a fairly large room. There were two beds in it, a stove, a       table, a chest of drawers and a few chairs. From one of the beds       three heads stared at him. As each head was covered with a wool       cap, drawn down over the ears, like his own, he could not make       out who they were. There were dishes on the table, but they were       empty. The room was cold, although it was evident that there was       still a little fire in the stove.        “Oh!” came from one of the heads in the bed. “I thought you were       my father. What is your name?”        “My name,” answered the boy, “is Henry Ives. I was left behind       alone in the railroad car about a mile back, and saw the smoke       from your house and here I am.”        “Have you brought us anything to burn?” asked the second head.        “Or anything to eat?” questioned the third.        “My name is Mary Wright,” said the first speaker, “and these are       my brothers George and Philip. Father went away yesterday morning       with the team, to get some coal and some food. He went to Kiowa.”        “That’s where I am going,” interrupted Henry.        “Yes,” continued Mary, “I suppose he can’t get back because of       the snow. It’s an awful storm.”        “We haven’t anything to eat, and I don’t know when father will be       back,” said George.        “And it’s Christmas Eve,” wailed Philip, who appeared to be about       seven.        He set up a howl about this which his brother George, who was       about nine, had great difficulty in quieting.        “We put the last shovelful of coal in the stove,” said Mary       Wright, “and got into bed to keep warm.”        “I’ll go outside while you get up and dress,” said Henry       considerately, “and then we will try and get to the car. It is       warm there, and there is something to eat.”        “You needn’t go,” said the girl; “we are all dressed.” She threw       back the covers and sprang out of bed. She was very pretty and       about Henry’s own age, he discovered, although she was pale and       haggard with cold and hunger.        “Goody, goody!” exclaimed little Philip, as his feet landed on       the floor. “Maybe we’ll have some Christmas, too.”        “Maybe we will,” said Henry, smiling at him. “At least we will       have something to eat.”        “Well, let’s start right away then,” urged George.        This brought Henry face to face with a dilemma. “I have only one       pair of snow-shoes,” he said at last, “and you probably don’t       know how to use them anyway, and you can’t walk on the snow.”        “I have a sled,” suggested George.        “That won’t do,” said Henry. “I’ve got to have something that       won’t"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15343"],["title","A Little Book for Christmas (#8)"],["body"," in the snow—that will lie flat, so I can draw you       along.”        “How about that table?” said the girl.        “Good suggestion,” cried Henry.        It was nothing but a common kitchen table. He turned it upside       down, took his Scout axe from its sheath, knocked the legs off,       fastened a piece of clothesline to the butts of two of them.        “Now if I could have something to turn up along the front, so as       not to dig into the snow,” he said, “it would be fine.” He       thought a moment. “Where is that sled of yours, George?”        “Here,” said George, dragging it forth. The runners curved       upwards. Henry cut them off, in spite of Philip’s protests. He       nailed these runners to the front of the table and stretched rope       tightly across them so that he had four up-curves in front of the       table.        “Now I want something to stretch on these things, so as to let       the sled ride over the snow, instead of digging into it,” he said       to the girl.        She brought him her father’s old “slicker.” Henry cut it into       suitable shape and nailed and lashed it securely to the runners       and to the table top. Now he had a flat-bottomed sled with a       rising front to it that would serve. He smiled as he looked at       the queer contrivance and said aloud: “I wish Mr. Lesher could       see that!”        “Who is Mr. Lesher?” asked George.        “Oh, he’s my Scoutmaster back in Ohio. Now come on!”        He opened the door, drew the sled outside, pushed it up on the       snow and stepped on it. It bore his weight perfectly.        “It’s all right,” he cried. “But it won’t take all three of you       at once.”        “I’ll wait,” said Mary, “you take the two boys.”        “Very well,” said Henry.        “You’ll surely come back for me?”        “Surely, and I think it’s mighty brave of you to stay behind. Now       come on, boys,” he said.        Leaving Mary filled with pleasure at such praise, he put the two       boys carefully into the sled, stepped into his snow-shoes and       dragged them rapidly across the prairie. It was quite dark now,       but the sky was clear and the stars were bright. The storm had       completely stopped. He remembered the bearings he had taken by       the stars, and reached the high hill without difficulty. Below       him lay the car.        Presently he drew up before the platform. He put the boys in the       car, told them to go up to the fire and warm themselves and not       to touch anything. Then he went back for the girl.        “Did you think I was not coming?” he asked as he re-entered the       cabin.        “I knew you would come back,” said the girl and it was Henry’s       turn to tingle with pride.        He wrapped her up carefully, and fairly ran back to the car. They       found the boys warm and comfortable and greatly excited.        “If we just had a Christmas tree and Santa Claus and something to       eat and a drink of water and a place to sleep,” said the youngest       boy, “it would be great fun.”        “I am afraid we can’t manage the Christmas tree,” said Henry,       “but we can have everything else.”        “Do you mean Santy?”        “Santy too,” answered the boy. “First of all, we will get       something to eat.”        “We haven’t had anything since morning,” said the girl. Henry       divided the sandwiches into three portions. As it happened, there       were three hard-boiled eggs. He gave one portion to each of his       guests.        “You haven’t left any for yourself,” said Mary.        “I ate before I looked for you,” answered Henry, although the one       sandwich had by no means satisfied his hunger.        “My, but this is good!” said George.        “Our mother is dead,” said Mary Wright after a pause, “and our       father is awful poor. He has taken out a homestead and we are       trying to live on it until he gets it proved up. We have had a       very hard time since mother died.”        “Yes, I know,” said Henry, gravely; “my mother died, too.”        “I wonder what time it is?” asked the girl at last.        Henry pulled out his watch. “It is after six o’clock,” he said.        “Say,” broke in George, “that’s a funny kind of a uniform you’ve       got on.”        “It is a Boy Scout uniform.”        “Oh, is it?” exclaimed George. “I never saw one before. I wish I       could be a Scout!”        “Maybe you can,” answered Henry. “I am going to organize a troop       when I get to Kiowa. But now I’m going to fix beds for you. Of       course we are all sleepy after such a hard day.”        He had seen the trainmen lift up the bottoms of the seats and lay       them lengthwise of the car. He did this, and soon made four       fairly comfortable beds. The two nearest the stove he gave to the       boys. He indicated the next one was for Mary, and the one further       down toward the middle of the car was for himself.        “You can all go to bed right away,” he said when he had made his       preparations. The two boys decided to accept this advice. Mary       said she would stay up a little longer and talk with Henry.        “You can’t undress,” she said to the two boys. “You’ll have to       sleep as you are.” She sat down in one of the car seats; Philip       knelt down at one knee and George at the other. The girl, who was       barely fifteen had already taken her mother’s place. She laid her       hand on each bent head and listened while one after the other the       boys said their prayers. She kissed them good-night, saw them       comfortably laid out on the big cushions with their overcoats for       pillows and turned away.        “Say,” began Philip, “you forgot something, Mary.”        “What have I forgotten, dear?”        “Why, it’s Christmas Eve and we must hang up our stockings.”        Mary threw up her hands. “I am afraid this is too far away for       Santa Claus. He won’t know that we are out here,” she said.        “Oh, I don’t know,” said Henry, thinking rapidly, “let them hang       them up.”        Mary looked at him in surprise. “They haven’t any to hang up,”       she said. “We can’t take those they’re wearing.”        “You should have thought of that,” wailed Philip, “before you       brought us here.”        “I have some extra ones in my bag,” said Henry. “We will hang       them up.”        He opened the bag and brought out three stockings, one for each       of his guests. He fastened them to the baggage racks above the       seats and watched the two boys contentedly close their eyes and       go to sleep.        “They will be awfully disappointed when they wake up in the       morning and do not find anything in them,” said Mary.        “They’re going to find something in them,” said Henry       confidently.        He went to the end of the car, opened his trunk and lifted out       various packages which had been designed for him. Of course he       was going on sixteen, but there were some things that would do       for Philip and plenty of things for George and some good books       that he had selected himself that would do for Mary. Then there       were candy and nuts and cakes and oranges galore. Mary was even       more excited than he was as they filled the boys’ stockings and       arranged things that were too big to go in them.        “These are your own Christmas gifts, I know,” said the girl, “and       you haven’t hung up your stocking.”        “I don’t need to. I have had my Christmas present.”        “And what is that?”        “A chance to make a merry Christmas for you and your little       brothers,” answered Henry, and his heart was light.        “How long do you suppose we will have to stay here?” asked the       girl.        “I don’t know. I suppose they will try to dig us out to-morrow.       Meanwhile we have nuts, oranges, crackers, and little cakes, to       say nothing of the candy, to live on. Now you go to bed and have       a good sleep.”        “And what will you do?”        “I’ll stay up for a while and read one of these books and keep       the fire going.”        “You are awfully good to us,” said Mary, turning away. “You are       just like a real Santa Claus.”        “We have to help other people—especially people in trouble,”       answered the boy. “It is one of the first Scout rules. I am       really glad I got left behind and found you. Good-night.”        The girl, whose experience that day had been hard, soon fell       asleep with her brothers. Henry did not feel sleepy at all; he       was bright and happy and rejoiced. This certainly _was_ an       adventure. He wondered what Dick and Joe and Spike and the other       fellows of his troop would think when he wrote them about it. He       did not realize that he had saved the lives of the children, who       would assuredly have frozen to death in the cabin.        When he was satisfied that Mary was sound asleep, he put some       things in her stocking and then piled in the rack over her head       two books he thought the girl would like. It was late when he       went to sleep himself, happier than he had dreamed he could be.        He awoke once in the night to replenish the fire, but he was       sleeping soundly at seven o’clock in the morning when the door of       the car opened and half a dozen men filed in. They had not made       any noise. Even the big snow-plough tearing open the way from       Kiowa had not disturbed the four sleepers.        The first man in was the conductor. After the trainmen had       discovered that the coach had been left behind they had managed       to get into Kiowa and had started back at once with the rotary       plough to open the road and to rescue the boy. Henry’s uncle had       been in town to meet Henry, and of course the trainmen let him go       back with them on the plough. The third man was Mr. Wright. He       had been caught by the storm and, as he said, the abandoned coach       must be"]]]
