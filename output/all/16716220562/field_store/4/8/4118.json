Then he pounded the drum, not so hard as to hurt it, but hard enough to make a noise, and he played the fiddle and blew on the horn, and then he ran inside the tent and jumped over a bench, making believe it was an elephant, and he did all sorts of funny tricks like that. He even stood on his head, and made a funny face.  \"That will make a very nice show,\" said Uncle Wiggily after he had watched the monkey. \"Now I'll stay outside, and keep the boys from coming in unless they pay their money. And you can be inside, doing the tricks.\"  \"And I'll give you money for working for me,\" said the monkey. \"Then perhaps you can make your fortune, and, besides that, I'll give you a cocoanut, and you can make a cocoanut pie with it.\"  \"That will be fine!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. So he and the monkey practiced to get ready for their show. It was a nice little tent in which it was to be given, and there were seats for the people, who would come, and a platform, and flying rings and trapeze bars and paper hoops, and all things like that, just the same as in a real circus. Well, finally the time came for the show. It was the day after Uncle Wiggily got to the place where the tent was, and he had slept that night in a hammock, put up between two trees.  \"Now we're almost ready for the show,\" said the monkey to the old gentleman rabbit, after a bit, \"so I hope you will be sure to keep out the troublesome boys. They always creep under the tent, and see the show for nothing. I can't have that going on if I'm to make any money.\"  \"Oh, I'll stop 'em!\" declared Uncle Wiggily.  \"And here's the club to do it with,\" said the monkey, handing Uncle Wiggily a stick.  \"Oh, I don't know about that,\" answered the rabbit. \"I never hurt boys if I can help it. Perhaps I shan't need the club. I'll leave it here.\"  So Uncle Wiggily hid the club under an apple tree, but the monkey said it would be needed, and he wanted Uncle Wiggily to keep it, and take a whip, too. But the old rabbit shook his head.  \"I'll try being kind to the boys,\" he said. \"You let me have my way, Mr. Monkey.\"  Well, pretty soon, not so very long, the show began. The monkey went inside the tent, and he blew on the horn, and he made music on the fiddle, and sang a funny song about a little great big pussy, who had a red balloon. She stuck a pin inside it, and it played a go-bang! tune.  Of course, as soon as the show started the people came crowding up to the tent, just as they do at the circus. There were men and women, and little boys and girls, and big boys and girls, and they all wanted to get inside to see what the monkey was doing. But, do you know, I believe all that he was doing was playing monkey-doodle tricks--but, of course, I might be mistaken.  Well, as it always happens, some boys didn't have any money with which to pay their way inside the tent. And, of course, as it will sometimes happen, one boy said to another:  \"Hey! I know a way we can crawl in under the tent, and see the show, and not have anything to pay.\"  \"But that wouldn't be fair,\" spoke the other boy. \"It would be cheating, and there's nothing meaner in this world than to cheat, whether it's playing a baseball game or going to a circus.\"  \"I guess you're right,\" said the first boy. \"What shall we do, though? I want to see the show.\"  \"Well, we must be fair, anyhow,\" spoke the second boy. \"We can't crawl in under the tent, but perhaps if we ask the monkey to let us in for nothing he'll do it.\"  \"Very well, we will,\" said the first boy. So they went up to the monkey and asked if they could go in for nothing, but, of course, he wouldn't let them.  \"May we crawl in under the tent, then?\" asked the second boy.  \"If Uncle Wiggily will let you,\" answered the monkey, blinking his two eyes and wrapping his tail around his neck.  So those boys tried to crawl in under the tent, and as soon as Uncle Wiggily saw them he rushed up and cried out:  \"Hey! Hold on there! Nobody must go under the tent. You must buy a ticket,\" and he shook a feather at the boys and, instead of hitting them, he only tickled them, and didn't hurt them a bit, for they sneezed.  Well, those boys were very troublesome. They kept on trying to crawl under the tent, and Uncle Wiggily rushed here, there and around the corner trying to stop them, and he cracked the lash on his whip, just like the man in the circus ring. But those boys kept on trying to crawl under the tent, for the monkey had given them permission, you see.  So finally Uncle Wiggily said:  \"I'll give those boys a little show myself, outside the tent, for nothing. Then maybe they'll stop bothering me.\"  So he stood on his left ear, and then on his right ear, and then he jumped through a hoop, and rolled over, and barked liked a dog, and all the boys that had tried to crawl under the tent to see the monkey-show for nothing, ran out to see Uncle Wiggily's show.  And he did lots of tricks and kept them all from crawling in under the tent, and he even ate a popcorn ball, standing on his hind legs, and wiggling his left ear with a pin-wheel on it. Then, after a while, the monkey-show was all over, and the monkey said:  \"Uncle Wiggily, you did very well. You treated those troublesome boys just fine! So I'll give you ten pennies, and perhaps they will make you have a good fortune.\"  Then the monkey gave Uncle Wiggily ten pennies, and he went to sleep in a feather bed, while the old gentleman rabbit went down to the drug store to get an ice cream soda.  And what happened after the show was over, and what Uncle Wiggily did after he had his ice cream, I'll tell you in the next story which will be about Uncle Wiggily in a balloon. That is, if our pussy cat doesn't get all covered with red paint, and look like a tomato growing on a strawberry vine. So watch out, and don't let that happen.     STORY XII  UNCLE WIGGILY IN A BALLOON   Well, just as I expected, something happened to my pussy-cat named Peter. He didn't fall into the pot of red paint, but he either ran away, or else some one took him. So now I have no pussy-cat. But I'll tell you a story about Uncle Wiggily just the same.  The old gentleman rabbit stayed with the monkey for several days, and he was so kind and good to the troublesome boys--Uncle Wiggily was, I mean--and he did such funny tricks for them, that they didn't crawl under the tent any more, and the monkey could do his tricks in peace and quietness.  \"Oh, you have been a great help to me,\" said the monkey to the rabbit, \"and I would like you to work for me all Summer. I am now going to travel on to the next town, and if you like you may go with me and keep the boys there from crawling under the tent.\"  \"No, I thank you,\" replied Uncle Wiggily slowly, as he put some bread and butter, and a piece of pie, into his satchel. \"I think I will travel farther on by myself, and seek my fortune.\"  \"Well, I'm sorry to see you go,\" said the monkey. \"And here is fifty cents for your work. I hope you have good luck.\"  And then Uncle Wiggily started off again, over the fields and through the woods, seeking his fortune, while the monkey got ready to move his show to the next town.  Well, for some time nothing happened to the old gentleman rabbit. He walked on and on, and once he saw a little red ant, trying to drag a piece of cake home for dinner. The cake was so big that the ant was having a dreadful time with it, but Uncle Wiggily took his left ear, and just brushed that cake into the ant's house as easily as anything.  \"My, how strong and brave you are,\" cried the little red ant. \"Won't you let me get you a glass of water?\"  \"I would like it,\" said the rabbit, \"for it is quite warm to-day.\"  Well, that ant got Uncle Wiggily a glass of water, but you know how it is--an ant's glass is so very small that it only holds as much water as you could put on the point of a pin, and really, I'm not exaggerating a bit, when I say that Uncle Wiggily drank seventeen thousand four hundred and twenty-six and a half ant-glasses of water before he had enough. It took all the ants for a mile around to bring the water to him, but they didn't mind, because they liked him.  Then the old gentleman rabbit traveled on again, and when it came night he slept under a haystack.  \"I am sure I'll find my fortune to-day,\" thought Uncle Wiggily as he got up and brushed the hay seed out of his ears the next morning.  It was a bright, beautiful day, and he hadn't gone very far before he heard some fine music.  \"My, there must be a hand-organ around here,\" he said to himself. \"And perhaps there is another monkey. I'll watch out.\"  So he stood on his hind legs, Uncle Wiggily did, and the music played louder, and all of a sudden the rabbit looked down the road, and there was a nice circus, with the white tents, all covered with flags, and bands playing, and elephants squirting water through their long noses over their backs to wash the dust off. And lions and tigers were roaring, and the horses were running, and the fat lady was drinking pink lemonade, and Oh! it was fine!  \"I've got fifty cents, and I guess I'll go to the circus,\" thought Uncle Wiggily, and he was just entering the big tent when he happened to see a man with a lot of red and green and yellow and pink balloons. Now, you would have thought that man would have been happy, having so many balloons, but he wasn't. He looked very sad, that man did, and he was almost crying.  \"Poor man!\" thought Uncle Wiggily. \"Perhaps he has no money to go in the circus. I'll give him mine. Here is fifty cents, Mr. Man,\" said the old gentleman rabbit, kindly. \"Take it and go see the elephant eat peanuts.\"  \"Oh, that is very good of you,\" spoke the balloon man, \"but I don't want to go to the circus. I want to sell my balloons, but no one will buy them.\"  \"Why not?\" asked the rabbit.  \"Oh, because there are so many other things to buy,\" said the man, \"red peanuts and lemonade in shells--oh, I'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15281"],["title","Uncle Wiggily's Adventures (#8)"],["body","got that wrong, it is red lemonade, isn't it? And peanuts in shells. But no matter. What I need,\" said the man, \"is to get the people to listen to me--I need to make them look at me, and when they see what fine balloons I have they'll buy some. But there are so many other things to look at that they never look toward me at all.\"  \"Ha! I know the very thing!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. \"You ought to have some one go up in a balloon. That would surprise the people like anything. They'd be sure to look at that, and they'd all run over here and buy all your balloons.\"  \"Yes, but who can I get to go up in a balloon?\" asked the man.  \"I will!\" cried Uncle Wiggily bravely. \"Perhaps I may find my fortune up in the sky, so I'll go in a balloon.\"  Well, the man thought that was fine. So he made a little basket for the rabbit to sit in, and he fastened the basket to a big red balloon, and then he took care of the rabbit's valise for him, while Uncle Wiggily got ready to go toward the clouds, taking only his crutch with him.  When the man had everything fixed and when the rabbit was sitting in the basket as easily as in a soft chair at home, the man cried:  \"Over here! Over here, everybody! Over here, people! A rabbit is going up in a balloon! A most wonderful sight! Over here!\"  And then the man let go of the balloon, and Uncle Wiggily shot right up toward the sky, only, of course, the man had a string fast to the balloon to pull it down again. Up and up went the balloon carrying Uncle Wiggily. Up and up!  And my! how surprised the people were. They rushed over and bought so many balloons that the man couldn't take in the money fast enough. And Uncle Wiggily stayed up there, high in the air, looking for his fortune.  And then, all of a sudden, a bad boy, with a bean shooter, shot at the balloon, and \"bang!\" it burst, with a big hole in it. Down came Uncle Wiggily, head over heels, bursted balloon, basket, crutch and all.  \"Oh, he'll be killed! He'll be killed!\" cried all the people.  \"No, he'll not! We'll save him!\" cried Dickie and Nellie Chip-Chip, the boy and girl sparrow, who happened to be at the circus. \"We'll save Uncle Wiggily!\"  So up into the air they flew, and before Uncle Wiggily could fall to the ground Dickie and Nellie grabbed the basket in their bills, and, by fluttering their wings, they let it come very gently to earth just like a feather falling, and the rabbit wasn't hurt a bit. But, of course, the balloon was broken.  So that's how Uncle Wiggily went up in a balloon and came down again, but he hadn't yet found his fortune. And now in the next story, if our fire shovel doesn't go out to play in the sand pile, and get its ears full of dirt, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily in an automobile.     STORY XIII  UNCLE WIGGILY IN AN AUTO   Well, after Uncle Wiggily had been saved from the falling balloon by Dickie and Nellie Chip-Chip, the sparrow children, the people were so excited that they wanted the bad boy arrested for making a hole in the balloon with his bean-shooter.  \"No, let him go,\" said the rabbit gentleman, kindly. \"I'm sure he won't do it again.\" And do you know, that boy never did. It was a good lesson to him.  Then the people bought all the balloons, until the man had none left, and I guess if he could have sent for forty-'leven more he would have sold them also.  \"I will pay you good wages to stay with me, and go up in a balloon every day,\" said the man to the rabbit. \"You would help me do lots of business.\"  \"No,\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"I must travel on and seek my fortune. I didn't find it up in the air.\"  But before the old gentleman rabbit traveled on, he went into the circus with Dickie and Nellie. For they had an extra ticket that Bully the frog was going to use, only Bully went in swimming and caught cold, and had to stay home. So Uncle Wiggily enjoyed the show very much in his place.  \"Give my love to Sammie and Susie Littletail and to all my friends,\" said the rabbit, as he took his crutch and valise, after the circus was over, and started to travel on, looking for his fortune.  Well, the first place he came to that day was an old hollow stump, and on the door was a card which read:  COME IN.  \"Ha! Come in; eh?\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"I guess not much! You can't fool me again. There is a bad bear, or a savage owl inside that stump, and they want to eat me. I'll just stay outside.\"  He was just hurrying past, when the door of the stump-house opened, and an old grandfather fox stuck out his head. This fox was almost blind, and he had no teeth, and he had no claws, and his tail was just like a last year's dusting brush, that the moths have eaten most up, and altogether that fox was so old and feeble that he couldn't have hurt a mosquito. So Uncle Wiggily wasn't a bit afraid of him.  \"I say, is there anything good to eat out there?\" asked the fox, looking over the tops of his spectacles at the rabbit. \"Anything nice and juicy to eat?\"  \"Yes, I am good to eat,\" said Uncle Wiggily, \"but you are not going to eat me. Good-by!\"  \"Hold on!\" cried the old fox, \"don't be afraid. I can only eat soup, for I have no teeth to chew with, so unless you are soup you are of no use to me.\"  \"Well, I'm not soup, but I know how to make some,\" replied the rabbit, for he felt sorry for the grandfather fox.  So what do you think our Uncle Wiggily did? Why, he went into the fox's stump-house and made a big pot full of the finest kind of soup, and the rabbit and the fox ate it all up, and, because the fox had no teeth or claws, he couldn't hurt his visitor.  \"I wish you would stay with me forever,\" said the old fox, as he blinked his eyes at Uncle Wiggily. \"I have a young and strong grandson coming home soon, and you might show him how to make soup.\"  \"No, thank you,\" replied the rabbit. \"I'm afraid that young and strong grandson of yours would want to eat me instead of the soup, I guess I'll travel on.\" So the old gentleman rabbit took his crutch and valise and traveled on.  Well, pretty soon, it began to get dark, and Uncle Wiggily knew night was coming on. And he wondered where he could stay, for he didn't see any haystacks to sleep under. He was thinking that he'd have to dig a burrow in the ground for himself, and he was looking for a soft place to begin, when, all at once, he heard a loud \"Honk-Honk!\" back of him in the road.  \"Ha, an automobile is coming!\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"I must get out of the way!\" So he hopped on ahead, going down the road quite fast, until he got to a place where there were prickly briar bushes on both sides of the highway.  \"My! I'll have to keep in the middle of the road if I don't want to get scratched,\" said the rabbit. And then the automobile horn behind him honked louder than ever.  \"They are certainly coming along fast,\" thought Uncle Wiggily. \"If I don't look out I'll be run over.\" So he hopped along quicker than before, until, all of a sudden, as he looked down the road, he saw a savage dog standing there.  \"Well, now! Isn't that just my bad luck!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. \"If I go on the dog will catch me, and if I stand here the auto will run on top of me. I just guess I'll run back and see if there is a hole where I can crawl through the bushes.\"  So he started to run back, but, no sooner had he done so, than the dog saw him, and came rushing at him with a loud, \"Bow-wow-wow! Bow-wow-wow!\"  \"My, but he's savage!\" thought the rabbit. \"I wonder if I can get away in time?\"  And then the auto honked louder than before, and all of a sudden it came whizzing down the road, right toward the rabbit.  \"Oh, dear; I'm going to be caught, sure!\" cried Uncle Wiggily, and indeed it did look so, for there was the dog running from one direction, and the auto coming in the other, and prickly briar bushes were on both sides of the road, and Uncle Wiggily couldn't crawl through them without pulling all the fur off his back, and his ears, too.  \"Honk-Honk!\" went the auto.  \"Bow-wow!\" went the dog.  \"Oh, dear!\" cried Uncle Wiggily. Then he thought of a plan. \"I'll give a big run and a long jump and maybe I can jump over the auto, and then the auto will bump into the dog, and I will be safe!\" he cried.  So he took a long run, and just as the auto was going to hit him, Uncle Wiggily gave a big jump, right up into the air. He didn't jump quite quickly enough, however, for one of the big rubber tires ran over his toe, but he wasn't much hurt. And what do you think he did? Why, he landed right in the auto, on the seat beside a little boy.  And that dog was so frightened of the automobile that he howled and yowled, and his teeth chattered, and he tucked his tail between his legs, and ran home.  \"Oh, the bunny! The bunny!\" cried the little boy, as he saw Uncle Wiggly. \"May we keep him, papa?\"  \"I guess so,\" said the boy's papa. \"Anyhow his foot is hurt, and we'll take care of him until it gets well. My, but he is a good jumper, though!\"  So the man stopped the auto, and picked up Uncle Wiggily's crutch and valise, which the old gentleman rabbit had dropped when he jumped upon the seat beside the boy, and then the car went on. And Uncle Wiggily wasn't a bit frightened at being in an auto, for he knew the boy and man would be kind to him.  \"Perhaps I shall find my fortune now,\" the rabbit gentleman said. And the little boy patted him on the back, and stroked his long ears.  Now, in the story after this I'll tell you what happened to Uncle Wiggily at the little boy's house, and in case our door key doesn't get locked out, and have to sleep in the park, you are going to hear about Uncle Wiggily in a boat.     STORY XIV  UNCLE WIGGILY IN A BOAT   \"Poor rabbit!\" exclaimed the little boy in the automobile, as he rubbed Uncle Wiggily's ears. \"I wonder if his foot is much hurt, papa?\"  \"I don't know,\" answered the man, as he steered the machine down the road. \"I'll have the doctor look at it.\"  \"Oh, indeed, it isn't hurt much,\" spoke up Uncle Wiggily. \"The rubber tire was soft, you see. But my rheumatism is much "]]]
