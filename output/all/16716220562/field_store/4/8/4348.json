When the first stone fell, the Man of Peace looked sharply round, saying:  \"What's yon?\"  \"It'll be me striking my rung upon the ground,\" said the Laird.  \"You're mad,\" said the Man of Peace, and Brockburn felt sure that he knew the truth, and was displeased. But as they went on, the stones were so heavy, and bumped the Laird's side so hard, that he threw away a second, dropping it as gently as he could. But the sound of its fall did not escape the ears of the Man of Peace, who cried as before:  \"What's yon?\"  \"It's jest a nasty hoast[5] that I have,\" said the Laird.  [Footnote 5: \"Hoast\" = cough.]  \"Man, you're daft,\" said the Dwarf, contemptuously; \"that's what ails ye.\"  The Laird now resolved to be prudent, but the inconvenience of his burden was so great that after a while he resolved to risk the displeasure of the Man of Peace once more, and gently slipped a third stone to the ground.  \"Third time's lucky,\" he thought. But the proverb failed him, for the Dwarf turned as before, shouting: \"What's yon?\"  \"It'll be my new brogues[6] that ye hear bumpin' Upon the muckle stanes,\" said the Laird.  [Footnote 6: \"Brogues\" = shoes.]  \"Ye're fou, Brockburn, I tellt ye so. Ye're fou!\" growled the Man of Peace, angrily, and the Laird dared not drop any more of the Dwarfs gifts. After a while his companion's good-humour seemed to return, and he became talkative and generous.  \"I mind your great-grandfather weel, Brockburn. He was a hamely man, I found his sheep for him one nicht on this verra hill-side. Mair by token, ye'll find your beasties at hame, and the men and the dogs forebye.\"  The Laird thanked him heartily, and after a while the Dwarf became more liberal-spirited still.  \"Yese no have to say that ye've been with the _Daoiné Shi_ and are no the better for it,\" he said. \"I'm thinking I'll grant ye three wushes. But choose wisely, man, and dinna throw _them_ away. I hae my fears that ye're no without a bee in your bonnet, Brockburn.\"  Incensed by this insinuation, the Laird defended his own sagacity at some length, and retorted on his companion with doubts of the power of the _Daoiné Shi_ to grant wishes.  \"The proof of the pudding's in the eating o't,\" said the Man of Peace. \"Wush away, Brockburn, and mak the nut as hard to crack as ye will.\"  The Laird at once began to cast about in his mind for three wishes sufficiently comprehensive to secure his lifelong prosperity; but the more he beat his brains the less could he satisfy himself.  How many miles he wandered thus, the Dwarf keeping silently beside him, he never knew, before he sank exhausted on the ground, saying:  \"I'm thinking, man, that if ye could bring hame to me, in place of bringing me hame, I'd misdoubt your powers nae mair. It's a far cry to Loch Awe,[7] ye ken, and it's a weary long road to Brockburn.\"  [Footnote 7: \"It's a far cry to Loch Awe.\"--_Scotch Proverb_.]  \"Is this your wush?\" asked the Man of Peace.  \"This is my wush,\" said the Laird, striking his rung upon the ground.  The words had scarcely passed his lips when the whole homestead of Brockburn, house and farm buildings, was planted upon the bleak hill-side.  The astonished Laird now began to bewail the rash wish which had removed his home from the sheltered and fertile valley where it originally stood to the barren side of a bleak mountain.  The Man of Peace, however, would not take any hints as to undoing his work of his own accord. All he said was:  \"If ye wush it away, so it'll be. But then ye'll only have one wush left. Ye've small discretion the nicht, Brockburn, I'm feared.\"  \"To leave the steading in sic a spot is no to be thought on,\" sighed the Laird, as he spent his second wish in undoing his first. But he cannily added the provision:  \"And ye may tak me wi' it.\"  The words were no sooner spoken than the homestead was back in its place, and Brockburn himself was lying in his own bed, Jock, his favourite collie, barking and licking his face by turns for joy.  \"Whisht, whisht, Jock!\" said the Laird. \"Ye wouldna bark when I begged of ye, so ye may hand your peace noo.\"  And pushing the collie from him, he sat up in bed and looked anxiously but vainly round the chamber for the Man of Peace.  \"Lie doun, lie doun,\" cried the gudewife from beside him. \"Ye're surely out o' your wuts, Brockburn. Would ye gang stravaging about the country again the nicht?\"  \"Where is he?\" cried the Laird.  \"There's not a soul here but your lawful wife and your ain dear doggie. Was there ae body that ye expected?\" asked his wife.  \"The Man o' Peace, woman!\" cried Brockburn. \"I've ane o' my wushes to get, and I maun hae't.\"  \"The man's mad!\" was the gudewife's comment. \"Ye've surely forgotten yoursel, Brockburn. Ye never believed in the _Daoiné Shi_ before.\"  \"Seein's believin',\" said the Laird. \"I forgathered with a Man o' Peace the nicht on the hill, and I wush I just saw him again.\"  As the Laird spoke the window of the chamber was lit up from without, and the Man of Peace appeared sitting on the window-ledge in his daisy-lined cloak, his feet hanging down into the room, the silver shoes glittering as they dangled.  \"I'm here, Brockburn!\" he cried. \"But eh, man! ye've had your last wush.\"  And even as the stupefied Laird gazed, the light slowly died away, and the Man of Peace vanished also.  On the following morning the Laird was roused from sleep by loud cries of surprise and admiration.  The good wife had been stirring for some hours, and in emptying the pockets of her good man's coat she had found three huge cairngorms of exquisite tint and lustre. Brockburn thus discovered the value of the gifts, half of which he had thrown away.  But no subsequent visits to the hill-side led to their recovery. Many a time did the Laird bring home a heavy pocketful of stones, at the thrifty gudewife's bidding, but they only proved to be the common stones of the mountain-side. The _Shian_ could never be distinguished from any other crag, and the _Daoiné Shi_ were visible no more.  Yet it is said that the Laird of Brockburn prospered and throve thereafter, in acre, stall, and steading, as those seldom prosper who have not the good word of the People of Peace.     THE OGRE COURTING.   In days when ogres were still the terror of certain districts, there was one who had long kept a whole neighbourhood in fear without any one daring to dispute his tyranny.  By thefts and exactions, by heavy ransoms from merchants too old and tough to be eaten, in one way and another, the Ogre had become very rich; and although those who knew could tell of huge cellars full of gold and jewels, and yards and barns groaning with the weight of stolen goods, the richer he grew the more anxious and covetous he became. Moreover, day by day, he added to his stores; for though (like most ogres) he was as stupid as he was strong, no one had ever been found, by force or fraud, to get the better of him.  What he took from the people was not their heaviest grievance. Even to be killed and eaten by him was not the chance they thought of most. A man can die but once; and if he is a sailor, a shark may eat him, which is not so much better than being devoured by an ogre. No, that was not the worst. The worst was this--he would keep getting married. And as he liked little wives, all the short women lived in fear and dread. And as his wives always died very soon, he was constantly courting fresh ones.  Some said he ate his wives; some said he tormented, and others, that he only worked them to death. Everybody knew it was not a desirable match, and yet there was not a father who dare refuse his daughter if she were asked for. The Ogre only cared for two things in a woman--he liked her to be little, and a good housewife.  Now it was when the Ogre had just lost his twenty-fourth wife (within the memory of man) that these two qualities were eminently united in the person of the smallest and most notable woman of the district, the daughter of a certain poor farmer. He was so poor that he could not afford properly to dower his daughter, who had in consequence remained single beyond her first youth. Everybody felt sure that Managing Molly must now be married to the Ogre. The tall girls stretched themselves till they looked like maypoles, and said, \"Poor thing!\" The slatterns gossiped from house to house, the heels of their shoes clacking as they went, and cried that this was what came of being too thrifty.  And sure enough, in due time, the giant widower came to the farmer as he was in the field looking over his crops, and proposed for Molly there and then. The farmer was so much put out that he did not know what he said in reply, either when he was saying it, or afterwards, when his friends asked about it. But he remembered that the Ogre had invited himself to sup at the farm that day week.  Managing Molly did not distress herself at the news.  \"Do what I bid you, and say as I say,\" said she to her father, \"and if the Ogre does not change his mind, at any rate you shall not come empty-handed out of the business.\"  By his daughter's desire the farmer now procured a large number of hares, and a barrel of white wine, which expenses completely emptied his slender stocking, and on the day of the Ogre's visit, she made a delicious and savoury stew with the hares in the biggest pickling tub, and the wine-barrel was set on a bench near the table.  When the Ogre came, Molly served up the stew, and the Ogre sat down to sup, his head just touching the kitchen rafters. The stew was perfect, and there was plenty of it. For what Molly and her father ate was hardly to be counted in the tubful. The Ogre was very much pleased, and said politely:  \"I'm afraid, my dear, that you have been put to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15592"],["title","Old-Fashioned Fairy Tales (#6)"],["body","trouble and expense on my account, I have a large appetite, and like to sup well.\"  \"Don't mention it, sir,\" said Molly. \"The fewer rats the more corn. How do _you_ cook them?\"  \"Not one of all the extravagant hussies I have had as wives ever cooked them at all,\" said the Ogre; and he thought to himself, \"Such a stew out of rats! What frugality! What a housewife!\"  When he broached the wine, he was no less pleased, for it was of the best.  \"This, at any rate, must have cost you a great deal, neighbour,\" said he, drinking the farmer's health as Molly left the room.  \"I don't know that rotten apples could be better used,\" said the farmer; \"but I leave all that to Molly. Do you brew at home?\"  \"We give _our_ rotten apples to the pigs,\" growled the Ogre. \"But things will be better ordered when she is my wife.\"  The Ogre was now in great haste to conclude the match, and asked what dowry the farmer would give his daughter.  \"I should never dream of giving a dowry with Molly,\" said the farmer, boldly. \"Whoever gets her, gets dowry enough. On the contrary, I shall expect a good round sum from the man who deprives me of her. Our wealthiest farmer is just widowed, and therefore sure to be in a hurry for marriage. He has an eye to the main chance, and would not grudge to pay well for such a wife, I'll warrant.\"  \"I'm no churl myself,\" said the Ogre, who was anxious to secure his thrifty bride at any price; and he named a large sum of money, thinking, \"We shall live on rats henceforward, and the beef and mutton will soon cover the dowry.\"  \"Double that, and we'll see,\" said the farmer, stoutly.  But the Ogre became angry, and cried; \"What are you thinking of, man? Who is to hinder my carrying your lass off, without 'with your leave' or 'by your leave,' dowry or none?\"  \"How little you know her!\" said the farmer. \"She is so firm that she would be cut to pieces sooner than give you any benefit of her thrift, unless you dealt fairly in the matter.\"  \"Well, well,\" said the Ogre, \"let us meet each other.\" And he named a sum larger than he at first proposed, and less than the farmer had asked. This the farmer agreed to, as it was enough to make him prosperous for life.  \"Bring it in a sack to-morrow morning,\" said he to the Ogre, \"and then you can speak to Molly; she's gone to bed now.\"  The next morning, accordingly, the Ogre appeared, carrying the dowry in a sack, and Molly came to meet him.  \"There are two things,\" said she, \"I would ask of any lover of mine: a new farmhouse, built as I should direct, with a view to economy; and a feather-bed of fresh goose feathers, filled when the old woman plucks her geese. If I don't sleep well, I cannot work well.\"  \"That is better than asking for finery,\" thought the Ogre; \"and after all the house will be my own.\" So, to save the expense of labour, he built it himself, and worked hard, day after day, under Molly's orders, till winter came. Then it was finished.  \"Now for the feather-bed,\" said Molly. \"I'll sew up the ticking, and when the old woman plucks her geese, I'll let you know.\"  When it snows, they say the old woman up yonder is plucking her geese, and so at the first snowstorm Molly sent for the Ogre.  \"Now you see the feathers falling,\" said she, \"so fill the bed.\"  \"How am I to catch them?\" cried the Ogre.  \"Stupid! don't you see them lying there in a heap?\" cried Molly; \"get a shovel, and set to work.\"  The Ogre accordingly carried in shovelfuls of snow to the bed, but as it melted as fast as he put it in, his labour never seemed done. Towards night the room got so cold that the snow would not melt, and now the bed was soon filled.  Molly hastily covered it with sheets and blankets, and said: \"Pray rest here to-night, and tell me if the bed is not comfort itself. To-morrow we will be married.\"  So the tired Ogre lay down on the bed he had filled, but, do what he would, he could not get warm.  \"The sheets must be damp,\" said he, and in the morning he woke with such horrible pains in his bones that he could hardly move, and half the bed had melted away. \"It's no use,\" he groaned, \"she's a very managing woman, but to sleep on such a bed would be the death of me.\" And he went off home as quickly as he could, before Managing Molly could call upon him to be married; for she was so managing that he was more than half afraid of her already.  When Molly found that he had gone, she sent the farmer after him.  \"What does he want?\" cried the Ogre, when they told him the farmer was at the door.  \"He says the bride is waiting for you,\" was the reply.  \"Tell him I'm too ill to be married,\" said the Ogre.  But the messenger soon returned:  \"He says she wants to know what you will give her to make up for the disappointment.\"  \"She's got the dowry, and the farm, and the feather-bed,\" groaned the Ogre; \"what more does she want?\"  But again the messenger returned:  \"She says you've pressed the feather-bed flat, and she wants some more goose feathers.\"  \"There are geese enough in the yard,\" yelled the Ogre, \"Let him drive them home; and if he has another word to say, put him down to roast.\"  The farmer, who overheard this order, lost no time in taking his leave, and as he passed through the yard he drove home as fine a flock of geese as you will see on a common.  It is said that the Ogre never recovered from the effects of sleeping on the old woman's goose feathers, and was less powerful than before.  As for Managing Molly, being now well dowered, she had no lack of offers of marriage, and was soon mated to her mind.     THE MAGICIANS' GIFTS.   There was once a king in whose dominions lived no less than three magicians.  When the king's eldest son was christened, the king invited the three magicians to the christening feast, and to make the compliment the greater, he asked one of them to stand godfather. But the other two, who were not asked to be godfathers, were so angry at what they held to be a slight, that they only waited to see how they might best revenge themselves upon the infant prince.  When the moment came for presenting the christening gifts, the godfather magician advanced to the cradle and said, \"My gift is this: Whatever he wishes for he shall have. And only I who give shall be able to recall this gift.\" For he perceived the jealousy of the other magicians, and knew that, if possible, they would undo what he did. But the second magician muttered in his beard, \"And yet I will change it to a curse.\" And coming up to the cradle, he said, \"The wishes that he has thus obtained he shall not be able to revoke or change.\"  Then the third magician grumbled beneath his black robe, \"If he were very wise and prudent he might yet be happy. But I will secure his punishment.\" So he also drew near to the cradle, and said, \"For my part, I give him a hasty temper.\"  After which, the two dissatisfied magicians withdrew together, saying, \"Should we permit ourselves to be slighted for nothing?\"  But the king and his courtiers were not at all disturbed.  \"My son has only to be sure of what he wants,\" said the king, \"and then, I suppose, he will not desire to recall his wishes.\"  And the courtiers added, \"If a prince may not have a hasty temper, who may, we should like to know?\"  And everybody laughed, except the godfather magician, who went out sighing and shaking his head, and was seen no more.  Whilst the king's son was yet a child, the gift of the godfather magician began to take effect. There was nothing so rare and precious that he could not obtain it, or so difficult that it could not be accomplished by his mere wish. But, on the other hand, no matter how inconsiderately he spoke, or how often he changed his mind, what he had once wished must remain as he had wished it, in spite of himself; and as he often wished for things that were bad for him, and oftener still wished for a thing one day and regretted it the next, his power was the source of quite as much pain as pleasure to him. Then his temper was so hot, that he was apt hastily to wish ill to those who offended him, and afterwards bitterly to regret the mischief that he could not undo. Thus, one after another, the king appointed his trustiest counsellors to the charge of his son, who, sooner or later, in the discharge of their duty, were sure to be obliged to thwart him; on which the impatient prince would cry, \"I wish you were at the bottom of the sea with your rules and regulations;\" and the counsellors disappeared accordingly, and returned no more.  When there was not a wise man left at court, and the king himself lived in daily dread of being the next victim, he said, \"Only one thing remains to be done: to find the godfather magician, and persuade him to withdraw his gift.\"  So the king offered rewards, and sent out messengers in every direction, but the magician was not to be found. At last, one day he met a blind beggar, who said to him, \"Three nights ago I dreamed that I went by the narrowest of seven roads to seek what you are looking for, and was successful.\"  When the king returned home, he asked his courtiers, \"Where are there seven roads lying near to each other, some broad, and some narrow?\" And one of them replied, \"Twenty-one miles to the west of the palace is a four-cross road, where three field-paths also diverge.\"  To this place the king made his way, and taking the narrowest of the field-paths, went on and on till it led him straight into a cave, where an old woman sat over a fire.  \"Does a magician live here?\" asked the king.  \"No one lives here but myself,\" said the old woman. \"But as I am a wise woman I may be able to help you if you need it.\"  The king then told her of his perplexities, and how he was desirous of finding the magician, to persuade him to recall his gift.  \"He could not recall the other gifts,\" said the wise woman. \"Therefore it is better that the prince should be taught to use his power prudently and to control his temper. And since all the persons capable of guiding him have disappeared, I will "]]]
