And Cuffy went right down out of sight.  Of course, the bees wouldn't go down into the water too. They knew they'd be drowned if they did. So they lingered in a swarm above the water. They hovered there in the air and waited. And when, after a moment, Cuffy's head came up out of the pool, they swooped down and began to sting him again.  Cuffy promptly ducked his head. And he swam under water to the further side of the pool and came up once more. To his surprise the bees were right there waiting for him. And he ducked under again, and swam to the opposite side, near the big boulder. And once more, when he came up to breathe, he found the buzzing bees all ready to pounce upon his nose.  So poor Cuffy had to keep pulling his head down into the pool. He would keep it there just as long as he could hold his breath; and then he would simply _have_ to stick his nose out of the water in order to draw some fresh air into his lungs.  It was not long before Cuffy became very tired from so much swimming. So he found a shallow place where he could stand on the bottom of the brook, with just enough water to cover him, and where he could poke his nose out whenever he had to. And just as often as his little black nose came up above the surface of the pool the bees lighted on it and stung Cuffy again.  All the rest of the afternoon poor Cuffy had to stay there in the water. For the bees did not leave him until sundown. And then, when the last one had gone, Cuffy crawled out of the brook and started toward home. His little round body and his sturdy little legs were not warm now, as they had been when he sat down beneath the tree to get cool. For the mountain brook was ice-cold; and Cuffy felt quite numb from standing in it so long. But cold as he was, his face felt like fire. And for some reason, which Cuffy couldn't understand, he could hardly see to pick his way through the shadows of the forest.     XVIII  CUFFY FRIGHTENS HIS MOTHER   When Cuffy Bear reached home, after his adventure with the bees, he found that his father and mother and his sister Silkie were just sitting down to their evening meal. Cuffy didn't speak to them as he came into the room where they were. He felt too miserable to say a word, with his face aching and burning, and a terrible smarting in his eyes. So he just stumbled inside the room and tried to make himself as small as he could, so he wouldn't be noticed.  Cuffy's parents and his little sister all looked at the little bear who had come into their house without even a knock. And his father said, in a cross voice--  \"Go away, little bear. Where are your manners?\"  Cuffy didn't know what to make of that. He didn't know what his father meant. So he just stood there and stared.  \"What do you want?\" his father asked him. \"Whose little bear are you? And whatever is the matter with your face?\"  Actually, Cuffy's own father didn't know him. And neither did his mother or his sister. You see, Cuffy's face was so swollen from the bees' stings that his face did not look like a little bear's face at all. His nose, instead of being smooth and pointed, was one great lump. And he hadn't a sign of an eye--just two slits.  \"What's the matter with you?\" Mr. Bear asked again. \"Are you ill? Have you the black measles?\"  At that, Mrs. Bear rose hastily from the table and snatched Silkie up from her high-chair and took her right out of the room. The thought of black measles frightened Mrs. Bear. You know, they are ever so much worse than _plain_ measles. And she was afraid Silkie would catch them.  Well, poor Cuffy felt more miserable than ever. He saw that his own family didn't know him. And he wondered what was going to become of him. Then, when his father told him very sternly to leave his house at once, Cuffy began to cry.  \"Oh! oh! oh!\" he sobbed. \"It's me--it's only me!\" he cried. That very morning, at breakfast, his father had told him to say \"It is I,\" instead of \"It is _me_.\" But Cuffy forgot all about that, now.  \"What! Are you my Cuffy?\" his father exclaimed. For he knew Cuffy at last. You see, the bees hadn't stung Cuffy's _voice_. And in no time at all Cuffy was tucked into his little bed and his mother was gently licking his poor, aching face with her tongue. Among bears that is thought to be the very best thing to do for bee-stings.  After a while Cuffy stopped crying. And it was not long before he had fallen asleep.  But it was two days before Cuffy Bear felt really himself again. And then his father went off into the forest with him and Cuffy led the way to the bee-tree; for Mr. Bear knew enough about bees so that he could take their honey away from them without getting stung badly. He didn't mind just a _few_ stings, you know.  Well--what do you think happened? When they came to the old tree Mr. Bear took just one look at the nest into which Cuffy had thrust his paw. And then he began to laugh, though he was somewhat disappointed, as you will see.  \"Those aren't bees!\" he told Cuffy. \"That's a hornets' nest!... We'd get no honey there.\"     XIX  THE LITTLE BEAR PETER   One day late in the summer Cuffy Bear went blackberrying. And on his way home he stopped at the deep pool where the hornets had chased him. He stayed there for a little while to watch the speckled trout as their bright sides flashed out of the depths of the clear water. As Cuffy stood on the big boulder and looked down, he could see himself quite plainly, reflected in the still surface of the water. He waved a paw. And the little bear in the brook waved _his_ paw too. Of course Cuffy knew that it was himself he saw. But he pretended for a time that it was some other little bear who was playing with him. And he was having lots of fun.  [Illustration: Cuffy Received a Slap on His Nose]  You see, Mr. Bear's family was the only bear family for miles and miles around. And Cuffy often wished he had other little boy-bears to play with. To be sure, he had his sister, Silkie. But she was a girl, and younger than he was, besides.  Well! Cuffy danced a jig on the top of the big boulder. And the little bear down below danced a jig, too. And Cuffy waved his paw again at the little bear in the water. And once more the little bear in the water waved a paw at _him_. It was great sport. And then Cuffy happened to look up.  To his great surprise, there stood a little bear on the other bank of the brook, right opposite. Cuffy was astonished. The other little bear and the little bear in the brook looked as much alike as two peas. Cuffy had never known that he could see a picture of himself by looking anywhere except into water. It was very strange, he thought. He waved a paw. And the little bear on the other bank waved _his_ paw. Cuffy kicked up one of his hind legs. And the other little bear kicked up, too.  Cuffy was puzzled. Was it really himself he was looking at? He nodded his head. And the other little bear nodded _his_ head.  Then Cuffy tried something else. He stared very hard at the little bear opposite him, and called \"Hello!\"  \"Hello, yerself!\" the other little bear said. And then Cuffy knew that it was a real, live boy-bear over there, and not just a reflection of himself. Cuffy was so delighted that he jumped down off the boulder and splashed through the brook, he was in such a hurry to get over there where the strange bear stood.  \"What's yer name?\" the strange bear asked.  Cuffy told him. And he learned that the strange bear's name was Peter, and that he lived around on the other side of Blue Mountain, as many as ten miles away.  \"Aw--call me _Pete_,\" the new bear said, as Cuffy began to talk to him. \"They all calls me Pete.\" He stuffed his front paws into the pockets of his ragged trousers. \"Say, Cuff--what was yer doin' up on that rock?\"  \"Playing!\" Cuffy told him.  Pete gave a grunt. \"That's no way ter play,\" he said. \"I'll show yer how ter have fun. Watch me!\" He led the way to the bank. And sitting down, he slid and rolled all the way down the steep slope and landed _plump!_ in the deep pool.  Now, Cuffy was not going to have Pete think that he couldn't do that, too. Although he was wearing his best trousers that day (for his mother was mending his every-day pair), Cuffy sat down on the top of the bank. And in another moment he had slid and slipped down the bank and landed _ker-splash!_ in the water.     XX  LEARNING TO BOX   For some time Cuffy Bear and his new friend Pete, as he preferred to be called, continued to slide down the bank of the brook into the water. They became plastered with mud from head to foot. And Cuffy's best trousers had two big holes in them. But Cuffy was having a splendid time.  \"Let's box, Cuff!\" Pete exclaimed, after a while.  \"What's that?\" Cuffy asked. He liked to be called \"Cuff.\" Nobody had ever called him by that name before. He felt quite grown up.  \"I'll show yer,\" Pete said. \"Stand up in front of me.\"  Cuffy stood up on his hind legs.  \"Now, hold up yer paws--so.\"  And Cuffy did as he was told.  \"Now hit me!\" Pete ordered.  And Cuffy struck out at his new friend. But to his surprise he didn't succeed in touching Pete at all. Instead, he received a stinging slap right on the end of his nose.  Cuffy didn't like that. In fact, it made him somewhat angry. And he struck out at Pete once more. But Pete dodged; and he gave Cuffy a good, hard blow in the eye. And while Cuffy was holding onto his poor eye, Pete hit his other eye. And then Cuffy couldn't see a thing, except bright spots that made him think of stars. He tried not to cry. But a few tears _would_ go rolling down his cheeks. And he did not like it at all when Pete began to laugh.  \"Huh! Don't be a cry-baby!\" Pete said. \"Yer want ter learn ter box, don't yer?\"  \"Y-es!\" Cuffy answered.  \"Well--quit yer cryin' and stand up here, then,\" Pete commanded.  So once more Cuffy straightened up and held his paws in front of him. And when he thought Pete wasn't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15528"],["title","The Tale of Cuffy Bear (#6)"],["body","hing, Cuffy tried again to hit him. Again Cuffy missed. His paw didn't reach Pete at all. But Pete gave him a terrible poke right in the stomach, and Cuffy sat down quickly on the ground and began to groan.  Pete sat down on the ground too and he looked at Cuffy and grinned.  \"Want any more?\" he asked.  Cuffy shook his head.  \"I'll have to go home now,\" he said. \"Of course, I'd like to box some more; but I haven't time to-day.\"  \"First lesson's over, then,\" Pete announced. \"Come back termorrer and I'll give yer another.\"  \"How long will it be before I learn to box well?\" Cuffy inquired.  \"You might learn next time,\" Pete said, \"Better try it, anyhow,\" he advised.  \"All right!\" Cuffy said. He hoped that another time he would be able to show Pete how it felt to be pounded. \"All right--I'll be here at the same time to-morrow.\"  So Pete trotted off spryly in one direction; and Cuffy trotted off in another, but not quite so spryly, for his head ached and one of his eyes was closed tight.  \"Mercy sakes!\" Mrs. Bear said, when Cuffy came into the house. \"Look at those trousers!\"  Cuffy looked at them as well as he could with his one good eye.  \"And you're _covered_ with mud!\" his mother added severely. \"What's the matter with your eye?\" she demanded.  \"I've been having fun--\" Cuffy began. \"I've been boxing--\"  \"Fun! Boxing! You've _ruined_ your best trousers,\" she said. \"You're a naughty little bear and you're going straight to bed. Who has been playing with you?\" she asked.  Mrs. Bear was very much displeased when she learned about Cuffy's new friend. \"I know who he is,\" she said. \"His people are very rough. They're not nice bears at all. And I forbid you aver to play with that Peter again.\"  So Cuffy had to go to bed. And the next day when Pete arrived at the pool he found no Cuffy there. For some time he waited. But still there was no Cuffy.  \"Huh!\" Pete grunted, as he went away at last. \"He's afraid, he is. And it's a good thing for him he didn't come back. If he had, I'd 'a' fixed him. Yes, sir! I'd--\" Whatever it was that Peter would have done to Cuffy, I am sure it wouldn't have been at all pleasant, because the rough little bear Peter scowled frightfully as he trotted off.     XXI  THE FOREST FIRE   It was quite late in the fall. And Blue Mountain looked very different from the way it had looked all summer. The leaves had turned to brown and yellow and scarlet, except where there were clumps of fir-trees, as there were around Mr. Bear's house. Indeed, Blue Mountain looked almost as if it were all aflame, so bright were the autumn colors. Mr. Bear remarked as much to Mrs. Bear one day.  \"For goodness' sake, don't say that!\" she exclaimed. \"Don't mention fire to me. The very thought of it makes me nervous. Everything's _so_ dry! I shall be glad when it rains again.\"  \"It _is_ dry,\" Mr. Bear agreed. \"But don't worry. It's like this every fall.\" And he went slowly down the mountain.  Cuffy and Silkie were playing together that morning. Cuffy was teaching Silkie to box, though, to be sure, he knew very little about boxing. But he found it easy to tap Silkie on the nose. And he had tapped her so hard that Mrs. Bear heard a sound very much like quarreling; and she came to the door to see what was the trouble.  Mrs. Bear was just going to call to her children, when she noticed a peculiar odor in the air. And she stood quite still, and sniffed, just as Cuffy had when he smelled the haymakers' lunch. You remember that the more Cuffy sniffed, the less alarmed he had been. But it was different with Mrs. Bear. The longer she stood there, with her nose twitching, and snuffing up the air, the more uneasy she became. And pretty soon she saw something that gave her a great start.  It was something white that Mrs. Bear saw, and it hung over the tree-tops; and where the wind had caught it it was spun out thin, like a veil.  It was exactly what Mrs. Bear had feared--it was smoke! The forest was afire! And Mrs. Bear was very much alarmed. She sent Cuffy and Silkie into the house, because she wanted to be sure that they wouldn't wander off into the woods. And then their mother stood in the doorway and watched. She was looking for Mr. Bear. While she waited there the smoke kept rising more and more until there were great clouds of it; and at last Mrs. Bear could see red flames licking up to the tops of the trees.  Several deer came bounding past, and a great number of rabbits and squirrels. And then followed other animals that couldn't run so fast--such as raccoons, and skunks, and woodchucks. Not for years had Mrs. Bear seen so many of the forest-people--and they were all so frightened, and in such a hurry to get away from the fire, that not one of them noticed Mrs. Bear as she stood in her doorway.  \"Where are they going, Mother?\" It was Cuffy who asked the question. He had crept up behind his mother and had been looking at the strange sight for some time.  \"They're going over to the lake, on the other side of the mountain,\" Mrs. Bear said.  \"Are they going fishing?\" Cuffy inquired.  Mrs. Bear shook her head. And then Cuffy squeezed past her and saw what was happening.  \"Oh-h, hurrah! hurrah!\" he shouted.  His mother looked at him in astonishment.  \"It's father's birthday!\" he cried. You remember that Cuffy's mother had told him that Mr. Bear was born on the day of a great forest fire, and that he never had a birthday except when the woods caught fire again. \"Now maybe father will bring home another little pig for a feast!\" Cuffy said hopefully.     XXII  THE RAIN COMES   Cuffy Bear was disappointed. For when at last his father came galloping up to his house he brought no pig with him. Indeed he seemed to have forgotten that it was his birthday.  \"Get the children!\" he shouted to Mrs. Bear, as soon as he came in sight. And pretty soon Cuffy and Silkie and their father and mother were hurrying along on their way to the lake that lay on the other side of the mountain.  Cuffy was delighted. He thought that perhaps he would see the naughty little bear Peter again; for he remembered that Peter lived around the mountain, right where they were going.  They had travelled several miles when Mr. Bear stopped suddenly. And he said, \"Hah!\" And he looked up at the sky. Something had hit him right in the eye. You might think that Mr. Bear was angry. But no! He was very glad. For it was a drop of rain that had fallen upon him. And in a few minutes there were countless drops pattering down. Yes, soon it was raining hard. And to Cuffy's great disappointment they all started homewards again, for Mr. Bear knew that the rain would soon put the fire out.  Mr. Bear had known all the time that his house wouldn't burn; for it was made of rock, and went straight into the side of the mountain. But he knew that if the woods all around caught fire it would be several days before they could go out and get anything to eat, or even a drink of water. And that was why he had started to lead his family away.  When they were back in their house once more Cuffy could think of only one thing that would make up for his not having seen the small bear Peter again. And he climbed up on his father's knees and said--  \"Will you go and get a little pig, Father?\"  \"A _pig_?\" Mr. Bear exclaimed. \"Well, now--why on earth do you want a pig? What would you do with a pig?\"  \"I'd eat it,\" Cuffy answered promptly. \"It's your birthday, you know. And we ought to have a pig so we can have a real feast.\"  Mr. Bear smiled. And pretty soon he went out of the house. He was gone a long time. But at last he came back again, fairly staggering beneath the load that he carried.  When Cuffy saw what his father dropped down onto the floor he hopped up and down in his delight. There was no pig there, but Cuffy didn't mind that. For Mr. Bear had brought home four rabbits, and four squirrels, and four porcupines, and four raccoons. And Cuffy ate and ate until his skin grew so tight that he was afraid it would burst. He ate all of one rabbit, and one squirrel, and one raccoon. But he never touched his porcupine at all. It made him think of the time he had tried to kill a porcupine himself, and had got his paws stuck full of quills. But he had a real feast, just the same.     XXIII  CUFFY BEAR GROWS SLEEPY   Far up Blue Mountain, and down in the valley too, the leaves had long ago fallen off the trees. And for some time the ground had been white with snow; for winter had come again. And Cuffy Bear's sister Silkie had had a birthday-party the very first day it snowed. Cuffy and Silkie shouted with glee each morning now, when they went out of doors, where the earth was covered with a snow-blanket. And they played and played and had just as good a time as little boys and girls have when winter comes. As they scampered about in the door-yard their feet left tracks that looked exactly like the foot-prints of barefooted girls and boys. They played tag, and hide-and-seek, and turned somersaults. And one day, when Mrs. Bear called them into the house, they ate, each of them, several quarts of chestnuts which Mr. Bear had gathered and brought home. In fact, before Mrs. Bear knew it they had eaten a great many more chestnuts than were good for them. And Cuffy, who had eaten the most, soon began to have a pain in his stomach.  \"That's what you get for being greedy,\" his mother told him.  \"I didn't eat many chestnuts,\" Cuffy said.  Mrs. Bear pointed to the floor.  \"What do you call those?\" she asked.  \"Chestnut-shells,\" Cuffy replied, hanging his head. There was a great heap of shells on the floor where Cuffy had sat.  \"Pick them all up--every one of them,\" his mother ordered. \"And when you have finished you may take a nap--both of you.\"  Cuffy yawned.  \"What do you say?\" Mrs. Bear asked severely.  \"Excuse me!\" Cuffy said hastily.  \"That's better!\" said Mrs. Bear. \"Now do as I say. You'll be asleep before you know it. And I don't intend to have those chestnut shells lying on the floor all winter.\"  You may"]]]
