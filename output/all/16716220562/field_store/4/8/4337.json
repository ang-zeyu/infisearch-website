It was scarcely a time for me to be required, or even noticed at all, and I took advantage of it and turned toward the town.  Ten minutes of leisurely walking brought me to the shady outskirts of Linrock and I entered the town with mingled feelings of curiosity, eagerness, and expectation.  The street I walked down was not a main one. There were small, red houses among oaks and cottonwoods.  I went clear through to the other side, probably more than half a mile. I crossed a number of intersecting streets, met children, nice-looking women, and more than one dusty-booted man.  Half-way back this street I turned at right angles and walked up several blocks till I came to a tree-bordered plaza. On the far side opened a broad street which for all its horses and people had a sleepy look.  I walked on, alert, trying to take in everything, wondering if I would meet Steele, wondering how I would know him if we did meet. But I believed I could have picked that Ranger out of a thousand strangers, though I had never seen him.  Presently the residences gave place to buildings fronting right upon the stone sidewalk. I passed a grain store, a hardware store, a grocery store, then several unoccupied buildings and a vacant corner.  The next block, aside from the rough fronts of the crude structures, would have done credit to a small town even in eastern Texas. Here was evidence of business consistent with any prosperous community of two thousand inhabitants.  The next block, on both sides of the street, was a solid row of saloons, resorts, hotels. Saddled horses stood hitched all along the sidewalk in two long lines, with a buckboard and team here and there breaking the continuity. This block was busy and noisy.  From all outside appearances, Linrock was no different from other frontier towns, and my expectations were scarcely realized.  As the afternoon was waning I retraced my steps and returned to the ranch. The driver boy, whom I had heard called Dick, was looking for me, evidently at Miss Sampson's order, and he led me up to the house.  It was even bigger than I had conceived from a distance, and so old that the adobe bricks were worn smooth by rain and wind. I had a glimpse in at several doors as we passed by.  There was comfort here that spoke eloquently of many a freighter's trip from Del Rio. For the sake of the young ladies, I was glad to see things little short of luxurious for that part of the country.  At the far end of the house Dick conducted me to a little room, very satisfactory indeed to me. I asked about bunk-houses for the cowboys, and he said they were full to overflowing.  \"Colonel Sampson has a big outfit, eh?\"  \"Reckon he has,\" replied Dick. \"Don' know how many cowboys. They're always comin' an' goin'. I ain't acquainted with half of them.\"  \"Much movement of stock these days?\"  \"Stock's always movin',\" he replied with a queer look.  \"Rustlers?\"  But he did not follow up that look with the affirmative I expected.  \"Lively place, I hear--Linrock is?\"  \"Ain't so lively as Sanderson, but it's bigger.\"  \"Yes, I heard it was. Fellow down there was talking about two cowboys who were arrested.\"  \"Sure. I heerd all about thet. Joe Bean an' Brick Higgins--they belong heah, but they ain't heah much.\"  I did not want Dick to think me overinquisitive, so I turned the talk into other channels. It appeared that Miss Sampson had not left any instructions for me, so I was glad to go with Dick to supper, which we had in the kitchen.  Dick informed me that the cowboys prepared their own meals down at the bunks; and as I had been given a room at the ranch-house he supposed I would get my meals there, too.  After supper I walked all over the grounds, had a look at the horses in the corrals, and came to the conclusion that it would be strange if Miss Sampson did not love her new home, and if her cousin did not enjoy her sojourn there. From a distance I saw the girls approaching with Wright, and not wishing to meet them I sheered off.  When the sun had set I went down to the town with the intention of finding Steele.  This task, considering I dared not make inquiries and must approach him secretly, might turn out to be anything but easy.  While it was still light, I strolled up and down the main street. When darkness set in I went into a hotel, bought cigars, sat around and watched, without any clue.  Then I went into the next place. This was of a rough crude exterior, but the inside was comparatively pretentious, and ablaze with lights.  It was full of men, coming and going--a dusty-booted crowd that smelled of horses and smoke.  I sat down for a while, with wide eyes and open ears. Then I hunted up a saloon, where most of the guests had been or were going. I found a great square room lighted by six huge lamps, a bar at one side, and all the floor space taken up by tables and chairs.  This must have been the gambling resort mentioned in the Ranger's letter to Captain Neal and the one rumored to be owned by the mayor of Linrock. This was the only gambling place of any size in southern Texas in which I had noted the absence of Mexicans. There was some card playing going on at this moment.  I stayed in there for a while, and knew that strangers were too common in Linrock to be conspicuous. But I saw no man whom I could have taken for Steele.  Then I went out.  It had often been a boast of mine that I could not spend an hour in a strange town, or walk a block along a dark street, without having something happen out of the ordinary.  Mine was an experiencing nature. Some people called this luck. But it was my private opinion that things gravitated my way because I looked and listened for them.  However, upon the occasion of my first day and evening in Linrock it appeared, despite my vigilance and inquisitiveness, that here was to be an exception.  This thought came to me just before I reached the last lighted place in the block, a little dingy restaurant, out of which at the moment, a tall, dark form passed. It disappeared in the gloom. I saw a man sitting on the low steps, and another standing in the door.  \"That was the fellow the whole town's talkin' about--the Ranger,\" said one man.  Like a shot I halted in the shadow, where I had not been seen.  \"Sho! Ain't boardin' heah, is he?\" said the other.  \"Yes.\"  \"Reckon he'll hurt your business, Jim.\"  The fellow called Jim emitted a mirthless laugh. \"Wal, he's been _all_ my business these days. An' he's offered to rent that old 'dobe of mine just out of town. You know, where I lived before movin' in heah. He's goin' to look at it to-morrow.\"  \"Lord! does he expect to _stay_?\"  \"Say so. An' if he ain't a stayer I never seen none. Nice, quiet, easy chap, but he just looks deep.\"  \"Aw, Jim, he can't hang out heah. He's after some feller, that's all.\"  \"I don't know his game. But he says he was heah for a while. An' he impressed me some. Just now he says: 'Where does Sampson live?' I asked him if he was goin' to make a call on our mayor, an' he says yes. Then I told him how to go out to the ranch. He went out, headed that way.\"  \"The hell he did!\"  I gathered from this fellow's exclamation that he was divided between amaze and mirth. Then he got up from the steps and went into the restaurant and was followed by the man called Jim. Before the door was closed he made another remark, but it was unintelligible to me.  As I passed on I decided I would scrape acquaintance with this restaurant keeper.  The thing of most moment was that I had gotten track of Steele. I hurried ahead. While I had been listening back there moments had elapsed and evidently he had walked swiftly.  I came to the plaza, crossed it, and then did not know which direction to take. Concluding that it did not matter I hurried on in an endeavor to reach the ranch before Steele. Although I was not sure, I believed I had succeeded.  The moon shone brightly. I heard a banjo in the distance and a cowboy sing. There was not a person in sight in the wide courts or on the porch. I did not have a well-defined idea about the inside of the house.  Peeping in at the first lighted window I saw a large room. Miss Sampson and Sally were there alone. Evidently this was a parlor or a sitting room, and it had clean white walls, a blanketed floor, an open fireplace with a cheery blazing log, and a large table upon which were lamp, books, papers. Backing away I saw that this corner room had a door opening on the porch and two other windows.  I listened, hoping to hear Steele's footsteps coming up the road. But I heard only Sally's laugh and her cousin's mellow voice.  Then I saw lighted windows down at the other end of the front part of the house. I walked down. A door stood open and through it I saw a room identical with that at the other corner; and here were Colonel Sampson, Wright, and several other men, all smoking and talking.  It might have been interesting to tarry there within ear-shot, but I wanted to get back to the road to intercept Steele. Scarcely had I retraced my steps and seated myself on the porch steps when a very tall dark figure loomed up in the moonlit road.  Steele! I wanted to yell like a boy. He came on slowly, looking all around, halted some twenty paces distant, surveyed the house, then evidently espying me, came on again.  My first feeling was, What a giant! But his face was hidden in the shadow of a sombrero.  I had intended, of course, upon first sight to blurt out my identity. Yet I did not. He affected me strangely, or perhaps it was my emotion at the thought that we Rangers, with so much in common and at stake, had come together.  \"Is Sampson at home?\" he asked abruptly.  I said, \"Yes.\"  \"Ask him if he'll see Vaughn Steele, Ranger.\"  \"Wait here,\" I replied. I did not want to take up any time then explaining my presence there.  Deliberately and noisily I strode down the porch and entered the room with the smoking men.  I went in farther than was necessary for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15580"],["title","The Rustlers of Pecos County (#2)"],["body","to state my errand. But I wanted to see Sampson's face, to see into his eyes.  As I entered, the talking ceased. I saw no face except his and that seemed blank.  \"Vaughn Steele, Ranger--come to see you, sir.\" I announced.  Did Sampson start--did his eyes show a fleeting glint--did his face almost imperceptibly blanch? I could not have sworn to either. But there was a change, maybe from surprise.  The first sure effect of my announcement came in a quick exclamation from Wright, a sibilant intake of breath, that did not seem to denote surprise so much as certainty. Wright might have emitted a curse with less force.  Sampson moved his hand significantly and the action was a voiceless command for silence as well as an assertion that he would attend to this matter. I read him clearly so far. He had authority, and again I felt his power.  \"Steele to see me. Did he state his business?\"  \"No, sir.\" I replied.  \"Russ, say I'm not at home,\" said Sampson presently, bending over to relight his pipe.  I went out. Someone slammed the door behind me.  As I strode back across the porch my mind worked swiftly; the machinery had been idle for a while and was now started.  \"Mr. Steele,\" I said, \"Colonel Sampson says he's not at home. Tell your business to his daughter.\"  Without waiting to see the effect of my taking so much upon myself, I knocked upon the parlor door. Miss Sampson opened it. She wore white. Looking at her, I thought it would be strange if Steele's well-known indifference to women did not suffer an eclipse.  \"Miss Sampson, here is Vaughn Steele to see you,\" I said.  \"Won't you come in?\" she said graciously.  Steele had to bend his head to enter the door. I went in with him, an intrusion, perhaps, that in the interest of the moment she appeared not to notice.  Steele seemed to fill the room with his giant form. His face was fine, stern, clear cut, with blue or gray eyes, strangely penetrating. He was coatless, vestless. He wore a gray flannel shirt, corduroys, a big gun swinging low, and top boots reaching to his knees.  He was the most stalwart son of Texas I had seen in many a day, but neither his great stature nor his striking face accounted for something I felt--a something spiritual, vital, compelling, that drew me.  \"Mr. Steele, I'm pleased to meet you,\" said Miss Sampson. \"This is my cousin, Sally Langdon. We just arrived--I to make this my home, she to visit me.\"  Steele smiled as he bowed to Sally. He was easy, with a kind of rude grace, and showed no sign of embarrassment or that beautiful girls were unusual to him.  \"Mr. Steele, we've heard of you in Austin,\" said Sally with her eyes misbehaving.  I hoped I would not have to be jealous of Steele. But this girl was a little minx if not altogether a flirt.  \"I did not expect to be received by ladies,\" replied Steele. \"I called upon Mr. Sampson. He would not see me. I was to tell my business to his daughter. I'm glad to know you, Miss Sampson and your cousin, but sorry you've come to Linrock now.\"  \"Why?\" queried both girls in unison.  \"Because it's--oh, pretty rough--no place for girls to walk and ride.\"  \"Ah! I see. And your business has to do with rough places,\" said Miss Sampson. \"Strange that papa would not see you. Stranger that he should want me to hear your business. Either he's joking or wants to impress me.  \"Papa tried to persuade me not to come. He tried to frighten me with tales of this--this roughness out here. He knows I'm in earnest, how I'd like to help somehow, do some little good. Pray tell me this business.\"  \"I wished to get your father's cooperation in my work.\"  \"Your work? You mean your Ranger duty--the arresting of rough characters?\"  \"That, yes. But that's only a detail. Linrock is bad internally. My job is to make it good.\"  \"A splendid and worthy task,\" replied Miss Sampson warmly. \"I wish you success. But, Mr. Steele, aren't you exaggerating Linrock's wickedness?\"  \"No,\" he answered forcibly.  \"Indeed! And papa refused to see you--presumably refused to cooperate with you?\" she asked thoughtfully.  \"I take it that way.\"  \"Mr. Steele, pray tell me what is the matter with Linrock and just what the work is you're called upon to do?\" she asked seriously. \"I heard papa say that he was the law in Linrock. Perhaps he resents interference. I know he'll not tolerate any opposition to his will. Please tell me. I may be able to influence him.\"  I listened to Steele's deep voice as he talked about Linrock. What he said was old to me, and I gave heed only to its effect.  Miss Sampson's expression, which at first had been earnest and grave, turned into one of incredulous amaze. She, and Sally too, watched Steele's face in fascinated attention.  When it came to telling what he wanted to do, the Ranger warmed to his subject; he talked beautifully, convincingly, with a certain strange, persuasive power that betrayed how he worked his way; and his fine face, losing its stern, hard lines, seemed to glow and give forth a spirit austere, yet noble, almost gentle, assuredly something vastly different from what might have been expected in the expression of a gun-fighting Ranger. I sensed that Miss Sampson felt this just as I did.  \"Papa said you were a hounder of outlaws--a man who'd rather kill than save!\" she exclaimed.  The old stern cast returned to Steele's face. It was as if he had suddenly remembered himself.  \"My name is infamous, I am sorry to say,\" he replied.  \"You have killed men?\" she asked, her dark eyes dilating.  Had any one ever dared ask Steele that before? His face became a mask. It told truth to me, but she could not see, and he did not answer.  \"Oh, you are above that. Don't--don't kill any one here!\"  \"Miss Sampson, I hope I won't.\" His voice seemed to check her. I had been right in my estimate of her character--young, untried, but all pride, fire, passion. She was white then, and certainly beautiful.  Steele watched her, could scarcely have failed to see the white gleam of her beauty, and all that evidence of a quick and noble heart.  \"Pardon me, please, Mr. Steele,\" she said, recovering her composure. \"I am--just a little overexcited. I didn't mean to be inquisitive. Thank you for your confidence. I've enjoyed your call, though your news did distress me. You may rely upon me to talk to papa.\"  That appeared to be a dismissal, and, bowing to her and Sally, the Ranger went out. I followed, not having spoken.  At the end of the porch I caught up with Steele and walked out into the moonlight beside him.  Just why I did not now reveal my identity I could not say, for certainly I was bursting with the desire to surprise him, to earn his approval. He loomed dark above me, appearing not to be aware of my presence. What a cold, strange proposition this Ranger was!  Still, remembering the earnestness of his talk to Miss Sampson, I could not think him cold. But I must have thought him so to any attraction of those charming girls.  Suddenly, as we passed under the shade of cottonwoods, he clamped a big hand down on my shoulder.  \"My God, Russ, isn't she lovely!\" he ejaculated.  In spite of my being dumbfounded I had to hug him. He knew me!  \"Thought you didn't swear!\" I gasped.  Ridiculously those were my first words to Vaughn Steele.  \"My boy, I saw you parading up and down the street looking for me,\" he said. \"I intended to help you find me to-morrow.\"  We gripped hands, and that strong feel and clasp meant much.  \"Yes, she's lovely, Steele,\" I said. \"But did you look at the cousin, the little girl with the eyes?\"  Then we laughed and loosed hands.  \"Come on, let's get out somewhere. I've a million things to tell you.\"  We went away out into the open where some stones gleamed white in the moonlight, and there, sitting in the sand, our backs against a rest, and with all quiet about us, we settled down for a long conference.  I began with Neal's urgent message to me, then told of my going to the capitol--what I had overheard when Governor Smith was in the adjutant's office; of my interview with them; of the spying on Colonel Sampson; Neal's directions, advice, and command; the ride toward San Antonio; my being engaged as cowboy by Miss Sampson; of the further ride on to Sanderson and the incident there; and finally how I had approached Sampson and then had thought it well to get his daughter into the scheme of things.  It was a long talk, even for me, and my voice sounded husky.  \"I told Neal I'd be lucky to get you,\" said Steele, after a silence.  That was the only comment on my actions, the only praise, but the quiet way he spoke it made me feel like a boy undeserving of so much.  \"Here, I forgot the money Neal sent,\" I went on, glad to be rid of the huge roll of bills.  The Ranger showed surprise. Besides, he was very glad.  \"The Captain loves the service,\" said Steele. \"He alone knows the worth of the Rangers. And the work he's given his life to--the _good_ that _service_ really does--all depends on you and me, Russ!\"  I assented, gloomily enough. Then I waited while he pondered.  The moon soared clear; there was a cool wind rustling the greasewood; a dog bayed a barking coyote; lights twinkled down in the town.  I looked back up at the dark hill and thought of Sally Langdon. Getting here to Linrock, meeting Steele had not changed my feelings toward her, only somehow they had removed me far off in thought, out of possible touch, it seemed.  \"Well, son, listen,\" began Steele. His calling me that was a joke, yet I did not feel it. \"You've made a better start than I could have figured. Neal said you were lucky. Perhaps. But you've got brains.  \"Now, here's your cue for the present. Work for Miss Sampson. Do your best for her as long as you last. I don't suppose you'll last long. You have got to get in with this gang in town. Be a flash cowboy. You don't need to get drunk, but you're to pretend it.  \"Gamble. Be a good fellow. Hang round the barrooms. I don't care how you play the part, so long as you make friends, learn the ropes. We"]]]
