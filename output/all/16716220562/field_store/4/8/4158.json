LADY MACBETH. You must leave this.  MACBETH. O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife! Thou know’st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.  LADY MACBETH. But in them nature’s copy’s not eterne.  MACBETH. There’s comfort yet; they are assailable. Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown His cloister’d flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons The shard-born beetle, with his drowsy hums, Hath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done A deed of dreadful note.  LADY MACBETH. What’s to be done?  MACBETH. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night, Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day, And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale!—Light thickens; and the crow Makes wing to th’ rooky wood. Good things of day begin to droop and drowse, Whiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse. Thou marvell’st at my words: but hold thee still; Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill. So, pr’ythee, go with me.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same. A Park or Lawn, with a gate leading to the Palace.   Enter three Murderers.  FIRST MURDERER. But who did bid thee join with us?  THIRD MURDERER. Macbeth.  SECOND MURDERER. He needs not our mistrust; since he delivers Our offices and what we have to do To the direction just.  FIRST MURDERER. Then stand with us. The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day. Now spurs the lated traveller apace, To gain the timely inn; and near approaches The subject of our watch.  THIRD MURDERER. Hark! I hear horses.  BANQUO. [_Within._] Give us a light there, ho!  SECOND MURDERER. Then ’tis he; the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i’ th’ court.  FIRST MURDERER. His horses go about.  THIRD MURDERER. Almost a mile; but he does usually, So all men do, from hence to the palace gate Make it their walk.   Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch.  SECOND MURDERER. A light, a light!  THIRD MURDERER. ’Tis he.  FIRST MURDERER. Stand to’t.  BANQUO. It will be rain tonight.  FIRST MURDERER. Let it come down.   [_Assaults Banquo._]  BANQUO. O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly! Thou mayst revenge—O slave!   [_Dies. Fleance escapes._]  THIRD MURDERER. Who did strike out the light?  FIRST MURDERER. Was’t not the way?  THIRD MURDERER. There’s but one down: the son is fled.  SECOND MURDERER. We have lost best half of our affair.  FIRST MURDERER. Well, let’s away, and say how much is done.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. The same. A Room of state in the Palace.   A banquet prepared. Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Ross, Lennox, Lords  and Attendants.  MACBETH. You know your own degrees, sit down. At first And last the hearty welcome.  LORDS. Thanks to your Majesty.  MACBETH. Ourself will mingle with society, And play the humble host. Our hostess keeps her state; but, in best time, We will require her welcome.  LADY MACBETH. Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends; For my heart speaks they are welcome.   Enter first Murderer to the door.  MACBETH. See, they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks. Both sides are even: here I’ll sit i’ th’ midst.  Be large in mirth; anon we’ll drink a measure The table round. There’s blood upon thy face.  MURDERER. ’Tis Banquo’s then.  MACBETH. ’Tis better thee without than he within. Is he dispatch’d?  MURDERER. My lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him.  MACBETH. Thou art the best o’ th’ cut-throats; Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance: If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.  MURDERER. Most royal sir, Fleance is ’scap’d.  MACBETH. Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect; Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, As broad and general as the casing air: But now I am cabin’d, cribb’d, confin’d, bound in To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo’s safe?  MURDERER. Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides, With twenty trenched gashes on his head; The least a death to nature.  MACBETH. Thanks for that. There the grown serpent lies; the worm that’s fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed, No teeth for th’ present.—Get thee gone; tomorrow We’ll hear, ourselves, again.   [_Exit Murderer._]  LADY MACBETH. My royal lord, You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold That is not often vouch’d, while ’tis a-making, ’Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home; From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony; Meeting were bare without it.   The Ghost of Banquo rises, and sits in Macbeth’s place.  MACBETH. Sweet remembrancer!— Now, good digestion wait on appetite, And health on both!  LENNOX. May’t please your Highness sit.  MACBETH. Here had we now our country’s honour roof’d, Were the grac’d person of our Banquo present; Who may I rather challenge for unkindness Than pity for mischance!  ROSS. His absence, sir, Lays blame upon his promise. Please’t your Highness To grace us with your royal company?  MACBETH. The table’s full.  LENNOX. Here is a place reserv’d, sir.  MACBETH. Where?  LENNOX. Here, my good lord. What is’t that moves your Highness?  MACBETH. Which of you have done this?  LORDS. What, my good lord?  MACBETH. Thou canst not say I did it. Never shake Thy gory locks at me.  ROSS. Gentlemen, rise; his Highness is not well.  LADY MACBETH. Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus, And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat; The fit is momentary; upon a thought He will again be well. If much you note him, You shall offend him, and extend his passion. Feed, and regard him not.—Are you a man?  MACBETH. Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that Which might appal the devil.  LADY MACBETH. O proper stuff! This is the very painting of your fear: This is the air-drawn dagger which you said, Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws, and starts (Impostors to true fear), would well become A woman’s story at a winter’s fire, Authoris’d by her grandam. Shame itself! Why do you make such faces? When all’s done, You look but on a stool.  MACBETH. Pr’ythee, see there! Behold! look! lo! how say you? Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.— If charnel houses and our graves must send Those that we bury back, our monuments Shall be the maws of kites.   [_Ghost disappears._]  LADY MACBETH. What, quite unmann’d in folly?  MACBETH. If I stand here, I saw him.  LADY MACBETH. Fie, for shame!  MACBETH. Blood hath been shed ere now, i’ th’ olden time, Ere humane statute purg’d the gentle weal; Ay, and since too, murders have been perform’d Too terrible for the ear: the time has been, That, when the brains were out, the man would die, And there an end; but now they rise again, With twenty mortal murders on their crowns, And push us from our stools. This is more strange Than such a murder is.  LADY MACBETH. My worthy lord, Your noble friends do lack you.  MACBETH. I do forget.— Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends. I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing To those that know me. Come, love and health to all; Then I’ll sit down.—Give me some wine, fill full.— I drink to the general joy o’ th’ whole table, And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss: Would he were here.   Ghost rises again.  To all, and him, we thirst, And all to all.  LORDS. Our duties, and the pledge.  MACBETH. Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee! Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold; Thou hast no speculation in those eyes Which thou dost glare with!  LADY MACBETH. Think of this, good peers, But as a thing of custom: ’tis no other, Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.  MACBETH. What man dare, I dare: Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear, The arm’d rhinoceros, or th’ Hyrcan tiger; Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves Shall never tremble: or be alive again, And dare me to the desert with thy sword; If trembling I inhabit then, protest me The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow! Unreal mock’ry, hence!   [_Ghost disappears._]  Why, so;—being gone, I am a man again.—Pray you, sit still.  LADY MACBETH. You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting With most admir’d disorder.  MACBETH. Can such things be, And overcome us like a summer’s cloud, Without our special wonder? You make me strange Even to the disposition that I owe, When now I think you can behold such sights, And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks, When mine are blanch’d with fear.  ROSS. What sights, my lord?  LADY MACBETH. I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse; Question enrages him. At once, good night:— Stand not upon the order of your going, But go at once.  LENNOX. Good night; and better health Attend his Majesty!  LADY MACBETH. A kind good night to all!   [_Exeunt all Lords and Atendants._]  MACBETH. It will have blood, they say, blood will have blood. Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak; Augurs, and understood relations, have By magot-pies, and choughs, and rooks, brought forth The secret’st man of blood.—What is the night?  LADY MACBETH. Almost at odds with morning, which is which.  MACBETH. How say’st thou, that Macduff denies his person At our great bidding?  LADY MACBETH. Did you send to him, sir?  MACBETH. I hear it by the way; but I will send. There’s not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee’d. I will tomorrow (And betimes I will) to the Weird Sisters: More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know, By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good, All causes shall give way: I am in blood Stepp’d in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o’er. Strange things I have in head, that will to hand, Which must be acted ere they may be scann’d.  LADY MACBETH. You lack the season of all natures, sleep.  MACBETH. Come, we’ll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use. We are yet but young in deed.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE V. The heath.   Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting Hecate.  FIRST WITCH. Why, how now, Hecate? you look"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1533"],["title","Macbeth (#6)"],["body","rly.  HECATE. Have I not reason, beldams as you are, Saucy and overbold? How did you dare To trade and traffic with Macbeth In riddles and affairs of death; And I, the mistress of your charms, The close contriver of all harms, Was never call’d to bear my part, Or show the glory of our art? And, which is worse, all you have done Hath been but for a wayward son, Spiteful and wrathful; who, as others do, Loves for his own ends, not for you. But make amends now: get you gone, And at the pit of Acheron Meet me i’ th’ morning: thither he Will come to know his destiny. Your vessels and your spells provide, Your charms, and everything beside. I am for th’ air; this night I’ll spend Unto a dismal and a fatal end. Great business must be wrought ere noon. Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vap’rous drop profound; I’ll catch it ere it come to ground: And that, distill’d by magic sleights, Shall raise such artificial sprites, As, by the strength of their illusion, Shall draw him on to his confusion. He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear His hopes ’bove wisdom, grace, and fear. And you all know, security Is mortals’ chiefest enemy.   [_Music and song within, “Come away, come away” &c._]  Hark! I am call’d; my little spirit, see, Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.   [_Exit._]  FIRST WITCH. Come, let’s make haste; she’ll soon be back again.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE VI. Forres. A Room in the Palace.   Enter Lennox and another Lord.  LENNOX. My former speeches have but hit your thoughts, Which can interpret farther: only, I say, Thing’s have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan Was pitied of Macbeth:—marry, he was dead:— And the right valiant Banquo walk’d too late; Whom, you may say, if’t please you, Fleance kill’d, For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late. Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father? damned fact! How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight, In pious rage, the two delinquents tear That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep? Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too; For ’twould have anger’d any heart alive, To hear the men deny’t. So that, I say, He has borne all things well: and I do think, That had he Duncan’s sons under his key (As, and’t please heaven, he shall not) they should find What ’twere to kill a father; so should Fleance. But, peace!—for from broad words, and ’cause he fail’d His presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear, Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell Where he bestows himself?  LORD. The son of Duncan, From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth, Lives in the English court and is receiv’d Of the most pious Edward with such grace That the malevolence of fortune nothing Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid To wake Northumberland, and warlike Siward That, by the help of these (with Him above To ratify the work), we may again Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights; Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives, Do faithful homage, and receive free honours, All which we pine for now. And this report Hath so exasperate the King that he Prepares for some attempt of war.  LENNOX. Sent he to Macduff?  LORD. He did: and with an absolute “Sir, not I,” The cloudy messenger turns me his back, And hums, as who should say, “You’ll rue the time That clogs me with this answer.”  LENNOX. And that well might Advise him to a caution, t’ hold what distance His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel Fly to the court of England, and unfold His message ere he come, that a swift blessing May soon return to this our suffering country Under a hand accurs’d!  LORD. I’ll send my prayers with him.   [_Exeunt._]   ACT IV  SCENE I. A dark Cave. In the middle, a Cauldron Boiling.   Thunder. Enter the three Witches.  FIRST WITCH. Thrice the brinded cat hath mew’d.  SECOND WITCH. Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whin’d.  THIRD WITCH. Harpier cries:—’Tis time, ’tis time.  FIRST WITCH. Round about the cauldron go; In the poison’d entrails throw.— Toad, that under cold stone Days and nights has thirty-one Swelter’d venom sleeping got, Boil thou first i’ th’ charmed pot!  ALL. Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble.  SECOND WITCH. Fillet of a fenny snake, In the cauldron boil and bake; Eye of newt, and toe of frog, Wool of bat, and tongue of dog, Adder’s fork, and blind-worm’s sting, Lizard’s leg, and howlet’s wing, For a charm of powerful trouble, Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.  ALL. Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble.  THIRD WITCH. Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf, Witch’s mummy, maw and gulf Of the ravin’d salt-sea shark, Root of hemlock digg’d i’ th’ dark, Liver of blaspheming Jew, Gall of goat, and slips of yew Sliver’d in the moon’s eclipse, Nose of Turk, and Tartar’s lips, Finger of birth-strangled babe Ditch-deliver’d by a drab, Make the gruel thick and slab: Add thereto a tiger’s chaudron, For th’ ingredients of our cauldron.  ALL. Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble.  SECOND WITCH. Cool it with a baboon’s blood. Then the charm is firm and good.   Enter Hecate.  HECATE. O, well done! I commend your pains, And everyone shall share i’ th’ gains. And now about the cauldron sing, Like elves and fairies in a ring, Enchanting all that you put in.   [_Music and a song: “Black Spirits,” &c._]   [_Exit Hecate._]  SECOND WITCH. By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes. Open, locks, Whoever knocks!   Enter Macbeth.  MACBETH. How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags! What is’t you do?  ALL. A deed without a name.  MACBETH. I conjure you, by that which you profess, (Howe’er you come to know it) answer me: Though you untie the winds, and let them fight Against the churches; though the yesty waves Confound and swallow navigation up; Though bladed corn be lodg’d, and trees blown down; Though castles topple on their warders’ heads; Though palaces and pyramids do slope Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure Of nature’s germens tumble all together, Even till destruction sicken, answer me To what I ask you.  FIRST WITCH. Speak.  SECOND WITCH. Demand.  THIRD WITCH. We’ll answer.  FIRST WITCH. Say, if thou’dst rather hear it from our mouths, Or from our masters?  MACBETH. Call ’em, let me see ’em.  FIRST WITCH. Pour in sow’s blood, that hath eaten Her nine farrow; grease that’s sweaten From the murderer’s gibbet throw Into the flame.  ALL. Come, high or low; Thyself and office deftly show!   [_Thunder. An Apparition of an armed Head rises._]  MACBETH. Tell me, thou unknown power,—  FIRST WITCH. He knows thy thought: Hear his speech, but say thou naught.  APPARITION. Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff; Beware the Thane of Fife.—Dismiss me.—Enough.   [_Descends._]  MACBETH. Whate’er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks; Thou hast harp’d my fear aright.—But one word more.  FIRST WITCH. He will not be commanded. Here’s another, More potent than the first.   [_Thunder. An Apparition of a bloody Child rises._]  APPARITION. Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!  MACBETH. Had I three ears, I’d hear thee.  APPARITION. Be bloody, bold, and resolute. Laugh to scorn The power of man, for none of woman born Shall harm Macbeth.   [_Descends._]  MACBETH. Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee? But yet I’ll make assurance double sure, And take a bond of fate. Thou shalt not live; That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies, And sleep in spite of thunder.   [_Thunder. An Apparition of a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand,  rises._]  What is this, That rises like the issue of a king, And wears upon his baby brow the round And top of sovereignty?  ALL. Listen, but speak not to’t.  APPARITION. Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are: Macbeth shall never vanquish’d be, until Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill Shall come against him.   [_Descends._]  MACBETH. That will never be: Who can impress the forest; bid the tree Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements, good! Rebellious head, rise never till the wood Of Birnam rise, and our high-plac’d Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath To time and mortal custom.—Yet my heart Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art Can tell so much, shall Banquo’s issue ever Reign in this kingdom?  ALL. Seek to know no more.  MACBETH. I will be satisfied: deny me this, And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know. Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?   [_Hautboys._]  FIRST WITCH. Show!  SECOND WITCH. Show!  THIRD WITCH. Show!  ALL. Show his eyes, and grieve his heart; Come like shadows, so depart!   [_A show of eight kings appear, and pass over in order, the last with  a glass in his hand; Banquo following._]  MACBETH. Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo. Down! Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs:—and thy hair, Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first. A third is like the former.—Filthy hags! Why do you show me this?—A fourth!—Start, eyes! What, will the line stretch out to th’ crack of doom? Another yet!—A seventh!—I’ll see no more:— And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass Which shows me many more; and some I see That twofold balls and treble sceptres carry. Horrible sight!—Now I see ’tis true; For the blood-bolter’d Banquo smiles upon me, And points at them for his.—What! is this so?  FIRST WITCH. Ay, sir, all this is so:—but why Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?— Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites, And show the best of our delights. I’ll charm the air to give a sound, While you perform your antic round; That this great king may kindly say, Our duties did his welcome pay.   [_Music. The Witches dance, and vanish._]  MACBETH. Where are they? Gone?—Let this pernicious hour Stand aye accursed in the calendar!— Come in, without there!   Enter Lennox.  LENNOX. What’s your Grace’s will?  MACBETH. Saw you the Weird Sisters?  LENNOX. No, my "]]]
