In another moment they had landed and secured the boat to a projecting rock.  Few words of conversation passed between these practical men. They had gone there on particular business. Time and tide proverbially wait for no man, but at the Bell Rock they wait a much briefer period than elsewhere. Between low water and the time when it would be impossible to quit the rock without being capsized', there was only a space of two or three hours--sometimes more, frequently less--so it behoved the men to economize time.  Rocks covered with wet seaweed and rugged in form are not easy to walk over; a fact which was soon proved by Swankie staggering violently once or twice, and by Spink falling flat on his back. Neither paid attention to his comrade's misfortunes in this way. Each scrambled about actively, searching with care among the crevices of the rocks, and from time to time picking up articles which they thrust into their pockets or laid on their shoulders, according as weight and dimensions required.  In a short time they returned to their boat pretty well laden.  \"Weel, lad, what luck?\" enquired Spink, as Swankie and he met--the former with a grappling iron on his shoulder, the latter staggering under the weight of a mass of metal.  \"Not much,\" replied Swankie; \"nothin' but heavy metal this mornin', only a bit of a cookin' stove an' a cannon shot--that's all.\"  \"Never mind, try again. There must ha' bin two or three wrecks on the rock this gale,\" said Davy, as he and his friend threw their burdens into the boat, and hastened to resume the search.  At first Spink was the more successful of the two. He returned to the boat with various articles more than once, while his comrade continued his rambles unsuccessfully. At last, however, Big Swankie came to a gully or inlet where a large mass of the _d√©bris_ of a wreck was piled up in indescribable confusion, in the midst of which lay the dead body of an old man. Swankie's first impulse was to shout to his companion, but he checked himself, and proceeded to examine the pockets of the dead man.  Raising the corpse with some difficulty he placed it on the ledge of rock. Observing a ring on the little finger of the right hand, he removed it and put it hastily in his pocket. Then he drew a red morocco case from an inner breast pocket in the dead man's coat. To his surprise and delight he found that it contained a gold watch and several gold rings and brooches, in some of which were beautiful stones. Swankie was no judge of jewellery, but he could not avoid the conviction that these things must needs be valuable. He laid the case down on the rock beside him, and eagerly searched the other pockets. In one he found a large clasp-knife and a pencil-case; in another a leather purse, which felt heavy as he drew it out. His eyes sparkled at the first glance he got of the contents, for they were sovereigns! Just as he made this discovery, Davy Spink climbed over the ledge at his back, and Swankie hastily thrust the purse underneath the body of the dead man.  \"Hallo! lad, what have ye there? Hey! watches and rings--come, we're in luck this mornin'.\"  \"_We!_\" exclaimed Swankie, somewhat sternly, \"_you_ didn't find that case.\"  \"Na, lad, but we've aye divided, an' I dinna see what for we should change our plan noo.\"  \"We've nae paction to that effec'--the case o' kickshaws is mine,\" retorted Swankie.  \"Half o't,\" suggested Spink.  \"Weel, weel,\" cried the other with affected carelessness, \"I'd scorn to be sae graspin'. For the matter o' that ye may hae it all to yersel', but I'll hae the next thing we git that's worth muckle a' to _mysel_'.\"  So saying Swankie stooped to continue his search of the body, and in a moment or two drew out the purse with an exclamation of surprise.  \"See, I'm in luck, Davy! Virtue's aye rewarded, they say. This is mine, and I doot not there'll be some siller intilt.\"  \"Goold!\" cried Davy, with dilated eyes, as his comrade emptied the contents into his large hand, and counted over thirty sovereigns.  \"Ay, lad, ye can keep the what-d'ye-ca'-ums, and I'll keep the siller.\"  \"I've seen that face before,\" observed Spink, looking intently at the body.  \"Like enough,\" said Swankie, with an air of indifference, as he put the gold into his pocket. \"I think I've seed it mysel'. It looks like auld Jamie Brand, but I didna ken him weel.\"  \"It's just him,\" said Spink, with a touch of sadness. \"Ay, ay, that'll fa' heavy on the auld woman. But, come, it'll no' do to stand haverin' this way. Let's see what else is on him.\"  They found nothing more of any value; but a piece of paper was discovered, wrapped up in oilskin, and carefully fastened with red tape, in the vest pocket of the dead man. It contained writing, and had been so securely wrapped up, that it was only a little damped. Davy Spink, who found it, tried in vain to read the writing; Davy's education had been neglected, so he was fain to confess that he could not make it out.  \"Let _me_ see't,\" said Swankie. \"What hae we here? 'The sloop is hard an--an--'\" (\"'fast,' maybe,\" suggested Spink). \"Ay, so 'tis. I canna make out the next word, but here's something about the jewel-case.\"  The man paused and gazed earnestly at the paper for a few minutes, with a look of perplexity on his rugged visage.  \"Weel, man, what is't?\" enquired Davy.  \"Hoot! I canna mak' it oot,\" said the other, testily, as if annoyed at being unable to read it. He refolded the paper, and thrust it into his bosom, saying, \"Come, we're wastin' time. Let's get on wi' our wark.\"  \"Toss for the jewels and the siller,\" said Spink, suggestively.  \"Very weel,\" replied the other, producing a copper. \"Heeds, you win the siller; tails, I win the box;--heeds it is, so the kickshaws is mine. Weel, I'm content,\" he added, as he handed the bag of gold to his comrade, and received the jewel-case in exchange.  In another hour the sea began to encroach on the rock, and the fishermen, having collected as much as time would permit of the wrecked materials, returned to their boat.  They had secured altogether above two hundredweight of old metal,--namely, a large piece of a ship's caboose, a hinge, a lock of a door, a ship's marking-iron, a soldier's bayonet, a cannon ball, a shoebuckle, and a small anchor, besides part of the cordage of the wreck, and the money and jewels before mentioned. Placing the heavier of these things in the bottom of the boat, they pushed off.  \"We better take the corp ashore,\" said Spink, suddenly.  \"What for? They may ask what was in the pockets,\" objected Swankie.  \"Let them ask,\" rejoined the other, with a grin.  Swankie made no reply, but gave a stroke with his oar which sent the boat close up to the rocks. They both re-landed in silence, and, lifting the dead body of the old man, laid it in the stern sheets of the boat. Once more they pushed off.  Too much delay had been already made. The surf was breaking over the ledges in all directions, and it was with the utmost difficulty that they succeeded in getting clear out into deep water. A breeze which had sprung up from the east, tended to raise the sea a little, but when they finally got away from the dangerous reef, the breeze befriended them. Hoisting the foresail, they quickly left the Bell Rock far behind them, and, in the course of a couple of hours, sailed into the harbour of Arbroath.    CHAPTER II  THE LOVERS AND THE PRESS-GANG  About a mile to the eastward of the ancient town of Arbroath the shore abruptly changes its character, from a flat beach to a range of, perhaps, the wildest and most picturesque cliffs on the east coast of Scotland. Inland the country is rather flat, but elevated several hundred feet above the level of the sea, towards which it slopes gently until it reaches the shore, where it terminates in abrupt, perpendicular precipices, varying from a hundred to two hundred feet in height. In many places the cliffs overhang the water, and all along the coast they have been perforated and torn up by the waves, so as to present singularly bold and picturesque outlines, with caverns, inlets, and sequestered \"coves\" of every form and size.  To the top of these cliffs, in the afternoon of the day on which our tale opens, a young girl wended her way,--slowly, as if she had no other object in view than a stroll, and sadly, as if her mind were more engaged with the thoughts within than with the magnificent prospect of land and sea without.  The girl was                   \"Fair, fair, with golden hair,\"  and apparently about twenty years of age. She sought out a quiet nook among the rocks at the top of the cliffs, near to a circular chasm, with the name of which (at that time) we are not acquainted, but which was destined ere long to acquire a new name and celebrity from an incident which shall be related in another part of this story.  Curiously enough, just about the same hour, a young man was seen to wend his way to the same cliffs, and, from no reason whatever with which we happened to be acquainted, sought out the same nook! We say \"he was seen\", advisedly, for the maid with the golden hair saw him. Any ordinary observer would have said that she had scarcely raised her eyes from the ground since sitting down on a piece of flower-studded turf near the edge of the cliff, and that she certainly had not turned her head in the direction of the town. Yet she saw him,--however absurd the statement may appear, we affirm it confidently,--and knew that he was coming. Other eyes there were that also saw the youth--eyes that would have caused him some degree of annoyance had he known they were upon him--eyes that he would have rejoiced to tinge with the colours black and blue! There were thirteen pair of them, belonging to twelve men and a lieutenant of the navy.  In those days the barbarous custom of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15124"],["title","The Lighthouse (#2)"],["body","into the Royal Navy was in full operation. England was at war with France. Men were wanted to fight our battles, and when there was any difficulty in getting men, press-gangs were sent out to force them into the service. The youth whom we now introduce to the reader was a sailor, a strapping, handsome one, too; not, indeed, remarkable for height, being only a little above the average--five feet, ten inches, or thereabouts--but noted for great depth of chest, breadth of shoulder, and development of muscle; conspicuous also for the quantity of close, clustering, light-brown curls round his head, and for the laughing glance of his dark blue eyes. Not a hero of romance, by any means. No, he was very matter of fact, and rather given to meditation than to mischief.  The officer in charge of the press-gang had set his heart on this youth (so had another individual, of whom more anon!) but the youth, whose name was Ruby Brand, happened to have an old mother who was at that time in very bad health, and she had also set her heart, poor body, on the youth, and entreated him to stay at home just for one half-year. Ruby willingly consented, and from that time forward led the life of a dog in consequence of the press-gang.  Now, as we have said, he had been seen leaving the town by the lieutenant, who summoned his men and went after him--cautiously, however, in order to take him by surprise, for Ruby, besides being strong and active as a lion, was slippery as an eel.  Going straight as an arrow to the spot where she of the golden hair was seated, the youth presented himself suddenly to her, sat down beside her, and exclaiming \"Minnie\", put his arm round her waist.  \"Oh, Ruby, don't,\" said Minnie, blushing.  Now, reader, the \"don't\" and the blush had no reference to the arm round the waist, but to the relative position of their noses, mouths, and chins, a position which would have been highly improper and altogether unjustifiable but for the fact that Ruby was Minnie's accepted lover.  \"Don't, darling, why not?\" said Ruby in surprise.  \"You're so rough,\" said Minnie, turning her head away.  \"True, dear, I forgot to shave this morning----\"  \"I don't mean that,\" interrupted the girl quickly, \"I mean rude and--and--is that a sea-gull?\"  \"No, sweetest of your sex, it's a butterfly; but it's all the same, as my metaphysical Uncle Ogilvy would undertake to prove to you, thus, a butterfly is white and a gull is white,--therefore, a gull is a butterfly.\"  \"Don't talk nonsense, Ruby.\"  \"No more I will, darling, if you will listen to me while I talk sense.\"  \"What is it?\" said the girl, looking earnestly and somewhat anxiously into her lover's face, for she knew at once by his expression that he had some unpleasant communication to make. \"You're not going away?\"  \"Well, no--not exactly; you know I promised to stay with mother; but the fact is that I'm so pestered and hunted down by that rascally press-gang, that I don't know what to do. They're sure to nab me at last, too, and then I shall have to go away whether I will or no, so I've made up my mind as a last resource, to----\" Ruby paused.  \"Well?\" said Minnie.  \"Well, in fact to do what will take me away for a short time, but----\" Ruby stopped short, and, turning his head on one side, while a look of fierce anger overspread his face, seemed to listen intently.  Minnie did not observe this action for a few seconds, but, wondering why he paused, she looked up, and in surprise exclaimed--  \"Ruby! what do you----\"  \"Hush! Minnie, and don't look round,\" said he in a low tone of intense anxiety, yet remaining immovably in the position which he had assumed on first sitting down by the girl's side, although the swelled veins of his neck and his flushed forehead told of a fierce conflict of feeling within.  \"It's the press-gang after me again. I got a glance of one o' them out of the tail of my eye, creeping round the rocks. They think I haven't seen them. Darling Minnie--one kiss. Take care of mother if I don't turn up soon.\"  \"But how will you escape----\"  \"Hush, dearest girl! I want to have as much of you as I can before I go. Don't be afraid. They're honest British tars after all, and won't hurt _you_, Minnie.\"  Still seated at the girl's side, as if perfectly at his ease, yet speaking in quick earnest tones, and drawing her closely to him, Ruby waited until he heard a stealthy tread behind him. Then he sprang up with the speed of thought, uttered a laugh of defiance as the sailors rushed towards him, and leaping wildly off the cliff, fell a height of about fifty feet into the sea.  Minnie uttered a scream of horror, and fell fainting into the arms of the bewildered lieutenant.  \"Down the cliffs--quick! he can't escape if you look alive. Stay, one of you, and look after this girl. She'll roll over the edge on recovering, perhaps.\"  It was easy to order the men down the cliffs, but not so easy for them to obey, for the rocks were almost perpendicular at the place, and descended sheer into the water.  \"Surround the spot,\" shouted the lieutenant. \"Scatter yourselves--away! there's no beach here.\"  The lieutenant was right. The men extended themselves along the top of the cliffs so as to prevent Ruby's escape, in the event of his trying to ascend them, and two sailors stationed themselves in ambush in the narrow pass at the spot where the cliffs terminate in the direction of the town.  The leap taken by Ruby was a bold one. Few men could have ventured it; indeed, the youth himself would have hesitated had he not been driven almost to desperation. But he was a practised swimmer and diver, and knew well the risk he ran. He struck the water with tremendous force and sent up a great mass of foam, but he had entered it perpendicularly, feet foremost, and in a few seconds returned to the surface so close to the cliffs that they overhung him, and thus effectually concealed him from his pursuers.  Swimming cautiously along for a short distance close to the rocks, he came to the entrance of a cavern which was filled by the sea. The inner end of this cave opened into a small hollow or hole among the cliffs, up the sides of which Ruby knew that he could climb, and thus reach the top unperceived, but, after gaining the summit, there still lay before him the difficulty of eluding those who watched there. He felt, however, that nothing could be gained by delay, so he struck at once into the cave, swam to the inner end, and landed. Wringing the water out of his clothes, he threw off his jacket and vest in order to be as unencumbered as possible, and then began to climb cautiously.  Just above the spot where Ruby ascended there chanced to be stationed a seaman named Dalls. This man had lain down flat on his breast, with his head close to the edge of the cliff, so as to observe narrowly all that went on below, but, being a stout, lethargic man, he soon fell fast asleep! It was just at the spot where this man lay that Ruby reached the summit. The ascent was very difficult. At each step the hunted youth had to reach his hand as high above his head as possible, and grasp the edge of a rock or a mass of turf with great care before venturing on another step. Had one of these points of rock, or one of these tufts of grass, given way, he would infallibly have fallen down the precipice and been killed. Accustomed to this style of climbing from infancy, however, he advanced without a sensation of fear.  On reaching the top he peeped over, and, seeing that no one was near, prepared for a rush. There was a mass of brown turf on the bank above him. He grasped it with all his force, and swung himself over the edge of the cliff. In doing so he nearly scalped poor Dalls, whose hair was the \"turf\" which he had seized, and who, uttering a hideous yell, leaped upon Ruby and tried to overthrow him. But Dalls had met his match. He received a blow on the nose that all but felled him, and instantly after a blow on each eye, that raised a very constellation of stars in his brain, and laid him prone upon the grass.  His yell, however, and the noise of the scuffle, were heard by those of the press-gang who were nearest to the scene of conflict. They rushed to the rescue, and reached the spot just as Ruby leaped over his prostrate foe and fled towards Arbroath. They followed with a cheer, which warned the two men in ambush to be ready. Ruby was lithe as a greyhound. He left his pursuers far behind him, and dashed down the gorge leading from the cliffs to the low ground beyond.  Here he was met by the two sailors, and by the lieutenant, who had joined them. Minnie was also there, having been conducted thither by the said lieutenant, who gallantly undertook to see her safe into the town, in order to prevent any risk of her being insulted by his men. On hearing the shout of those who pursued Ruby, Winnie hurried away, intending to get free from the gang, not feeling that the lieutenant's protection was either desirable or necessary.  When Ruby reached the middle of the gorge, which we have dignified with the name of \"pass\", and saw three men ready to dispute his passage, he increased his speed. When he was almost up to them he turned aside and sprang nimbly up the almost perpendicular wall of earth on his right. This act disconcerted the men, who had prepared to receive his charge and seize him, but Ruby jumped down on the shoulders of the one nearest, and crushed him to the ground with his weight. His clenched fist caught the lieutenant between the eyes and stretched him on his back--the third man wisely drew aside to let this human thunderbolt pass by!  He did pass, and, as the impetuous and quite irresistible locomotive is brought to a sudden pause when the appropriate breaks are applied, so was he brought to a sudden halt by Minnie a hundred yards or so farther on.  \"Oh! don't stop,\" she cried eagerly, and hastily thrusting him away. \"They'll catch you!\"  Panting though he was, vehemently, Ruby could not restrain a laugh.  \"C"]]]
