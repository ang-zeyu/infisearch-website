'It is barely possible to pass,' replied the engineer. 'Let us set forward, then,' said Napoleon.\" The rearing steed facing a precipitous slope in the picture gave emphasis to the words. There were also in this reader several pieces about Indians and bears, which indicate that Dr. McGuffey never forgot the stories told at the fireside by his father of his adventures as an Indian scout and hunter.  In the Fourth Reader there were seventeen selections from the Bible; William Wirt's \"Description of the Blind Preacher;\" Phillip's \"Character of Napoleon Bonaparte;\" Bacon's \"Essay on Studies;\" Nott's \"Speech on the Death of Alexander Hamilton;\" Addison's \"Westminster Abbey;\" Irving's \"Alhambra;\" Rogers's \"Genevra;\" Willis's \"Parrhasius;\" Montgomery's \"Make Way for Liberty;\" two extracts from Milton and two from Shakespeare, and no less than fourteen selections from the writings of the men and women who lectured before the College of Teachers in Cincinnati. The story of the widow of the Pine Cottage sharing her last smoked herring with a strange traveler who revealed himself as her long-lost son, returning rich from the Indies, was anonymous, but it will be remembered by those who read it.  These selections were the most noteworthy ones in the first editions of these readers.  The First and Second Readers of the McGuffey Series were substantially made new at each revision. A comparison of the original Third Reader with an edition copyrighted in 1847, shows that the latter book was increased about one-third in size. Of the sixty-six selections in the early edition only forty-seven were retained, while thirty new ones were inserted. Among the latter were \"Harry and his Dog Frisk\" that brought to him, punished by being sent to bed, a Windsor pear; \"Perseverance,\" a tale of kite-flying followed by the poem, \"Try, try again;\" the \"Little Philosopher,\" named Peter Hurdle, who caught Mr. Lenox's runaway horse and on examination seemed to lack nothing but an Eclectic spelling book, a reader and a Testament--which were promised him; \"The Colonists,\" in which men of various callings offered their services, and while even the dancing master was accepted as of some possible use, the gentleman was scornfully rejected; \"Things by Their Right Names,\" in which a battle was described as wholesale murder; \"Little Victories,\" in which Hugh's mother consoled him for the loss of a leg by telling him of the lives of men who became celebrated under even greater adversities; \"The Wonderful Instrument,\" which turned out to be the eye; \"Metaphysics,\" a ludicrous description of a colonial salt-box in affected terms of exactness designed to ridicule some forms of reasoning. Those who used this edition of the third reader will surely remember some of these selections.  [The Bible]  In the Fourth Reader printed in 1844 there were thirty new selections--less than one-third of the book; but some of these were such as will be remembered by those who read them in school. There was \"Respect for the Sabbath Rewarded,\" in which a barber of Bath had become so poor because he would not shave his customers on Sunday, that he borrowed a half-penny to buy a candle Saturday night to give light for a late customer, and was thus discovered to be the long-lost William Reed of Taunton, heir to many thousand pounds; \"The Just Judge,\" who disguised himself as a miller and, obtaining a place on the jury, received only five guineas as a bribe when the others got ten, and who revealed himself as Lord Chief Justice Hale and tried the case over in his miller's clothing; Hawthorne's \"The Town Pump;\" Mrs. Southey's \"April Day.\"    \"All day the low-hung clouds have dropped     Their garnered fullness down.   All day a soft gray mist hath wrapped     Hill, valley, grove and town.\"   Bryant's \"Death of the Flowers;\" Campbell's \"Lochiel's Warning;\" and the trial scene from Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice. All these became favorite reading exercises in later years.  As late as 1840 the Bible was read daily in all the schools of the West. Although sectarian or denominational teaching was not permitted, religious instruction was desired by the great majority of school patrons.  Even up to the opening of the Civil War, whatever the faith or the practice of the adult inhabitants of the country, the Bible story and the Bible diction were familiar to all. The speeches of the popular orators of that day were filled with distinct allusions to the Bible and these were quickly and clearly apprehended by the people. It may be questioned whether popular speeches of the present day would have equal force if based on the assumption that everybody knows the Biblical stories. Indeed it is a common remark made by professors of English in the higher institutions of learning that pupils know little of the Bible as a distinctly formative and conservative element in English literature. In the texts authorized for the study of English classics, Biblical allusions are very common. These have little meaning to pupils who have not read the Bible, unless the passage is pointed out and hunted up.  [Dr. Swing's Opinion]  From the pages of these readers the pupils learned to master the printed word and obtain the thought of the authors. Without conscious effort they received moral instruction and incentives toward right living. Without intent they treasured in their memories such extracts from the authors of the best English Literature as gave them a desire to read more.  [Books as Teachers]  In one of his sermons Dr. David Swing of Chicago said: \"Much as you may have studied the languages or the sciences, that which most affected you was the moral lessons in the series of McGuffey. And yet the reading class was filed out only once a day to read for a few moments, and then we were all sent to our seats to spend two hours in learning how to bound New Hampshire or Connecticut, or how long it would take a greyhound to overtake a fox or a hare if the spring of each was so and so, and the poor fugitive had such and such a start. That was perhaps well, but we have forgotten how to bound Connecticut, and how to solve the equation of the field and thicket; but up out of the far-off years come all the blessed lessons in virtue and righteousness which those reading books taught; and when we now remember, how even these moral memories have faded I cannot but wish the teachers had made us bound the States less, and solve fewer puzzles in 'position' and the 'cube root' and made us commit to memory the whole series of the McGuffey Eclectic Readers. The memory that comes from these far-away pages is full of the best wisdom of time or the timeless land. In these books we were indeed led by a schoolmaster, from beautiful maxims for children up to the best thoughts of a long line of sages, and poets, and naturalists. There we all first learned the awful weakness of the duel that took away a Hamilton; there we saw the grandeur of the Blind Preacher of William Wirt; there we saw the emptiness of the ambition of Alexander, and there we heard even the infidel say, 'Socrates died like a philosopher, but Jesus Christ like a God.'\"  This public recognition of the influence of these readers upon the mind and character of this great preacher is again noted in Rev. Joseph Fort Newton's biography of David Swing in which the books which influenced that life are named as \"The Bible, Calvin's Institutes, Fox's Book of Martyrs and the McGuffey Readers;\" and the author quotes David Swing as saying that \"The Institutes were rather large reading for a boy, but to the end of his life he held that McGuffey's Sixth Reader was a great book. For Swing, as for many a boy in the older West, its varied and wise selections from the best English authors were the very gates of literature ajar.\"  One of the most eminent political leaders of the present day attributes his power in the use of English largely to the study of McGuffey's Sixth Reader in the common schools of Ohio.  [How a Japanese Learned English]  At a dinner lately given in New York to Marquis Ito of Japan, the marquis responded to the toast of his health returning thanks in English. He then continued his remarks in Japanese for some eight minutes. At its close Mr. Tsudjuki, who was then the minister of Education in Japan, traveling with Marquis Ito as his friend and companion, and who had taken shorthand notes of the Japanese speech, rose and translated the speech readily and fluently into good English. One of the guests asked how he had learned to speak English so correctly. He replied that he had done so in the public schools of Japan and added, \"I learned my English from McGuffey's Readers, with which you are no doubt familiar.\"  [The Authorship]  It is not unusual to see in the literary columns of a daily newspaper inquiries as to where certain poems may be found of which a single stanza is faintly recalled. Many of these prove to be fragments of pieces that are found in the McGuffey Readers. Quite lately Theodore Roosevelt made the public statement that he did not propose to become a \"Meddlesome Matty.\" This allusion was perfectly clear to the millions of people who used the McGuffey Readers at any time after 1853.  When the Fourth Reader was issued in 1837 it contained a preface of three closely printed pages setting forth and defending the plan of McGuffey's books. In this he said: \"In conclusion, the author begs leave to state, that the whole series of Eclectic Readers is his own. In the preparation of the rules, etc., for the present volume he has had the assistance of a very distinguished Teacher, whose judgment"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15577"],["title","A History of the McGuffey Readers (#2)"],["body","zeal in promoting the cause of education have often been commended by the American people. In the arrangement of the series generally, he is indebted to many of his friends for valuable suggestions, and he takes this opportunity of tendering them his thanks for the lively interest they have manifested for the success of his undertaking.\"  The sole author of the four readers first issued as the Eclectic Readers was William Holmes McGuffey. He was responsible for the marked qualities in these books which met with such astonishing popular approval in all these years. What these qualities are is well known to those who have used the books and the users are numbered by millions.  [The Rhetorical Guide]  The Rhetorical Guide was prepared by Mr. A.H. McGuffey, and his name alone was on the early editions. In 1844 the book was revised by the author and Dr. Pinneo, and was given the alternate title \"or Fifth Reader of the Eclectic Series.\" The work of revision occupied two years. The title page carried the name of its author until, for reasons of his own, he asked to have it removed.  As usual when revisions of schoolbooks are made, the older edition was continued in publication so long as a distinct demand for it existed. But the issuance of a revised edition always suggests the question of change, which competing publishers promptly seek to bring about. The publishers of the \"Newly Revised McGuffey Readers,\" therefore, sought to replace the older edition wherever it was in use and to displace competing books wherever possible. The edition of 1843 acquired large sales over a very wide territory in the central West and South. It is the edition generally known by the grandfathers of the school boys of the present day.  It may be interesting to name some of the selections in this Rhetorical Guide issued in 1844 since in modified form the work has been the highest reader of the series.  [Selections of Value]  As a guide toward rhetorical reading the book contained a carefully prepared collection of rules and directions with examples for practice in Articulation. Inflection, Accent and Emphasis, Reading Verse, for the Management of the Voice and Gesture. These pages were intended for drill work, and in those days the teachers were not content with the dull monotonous utterance of the words or with mere mastery of thought, to be tested by multitudinous questioning. If the pupil obtained from the printed page the very thought the author intended to convey, the pupil was expected to read orally so as to express that thought to all hearers. If the correct thought was thus heard, no questions were needed. The test of reading orally is the communication of thought by the reader to the intelligent and attentive hearer, and the words of the author carry this message more accurately than can any other words the pupil may select.  [Noted Selections]  The selections in the Rhetorical Guide were made, first of all, to teach the art of reading. There was therefore great variety. Second, to inculcate a love for literature. Therefore the selections were taken from the great writers,--poets, orators, essayists, historians, and preachers. The extracts are wonderfully complete in themselves,--one does not need to read the whole of Byron's Don Juan to appreciate the six stanzas that describe the thunder-storm on the Alps. Of the poetical extracts all the users of this book will remember Southey's \"Cataract of Lodore\" with its exacting drill on the ending,--\"ing,\" Longfellow's \"Village Blacksmith\" and the \"Reaper and the Flowers;\" Bryant's \"Thanatopsis\" and \"Song of the Stars;\" Wolfe's \"Burial of Sir John Moore;\" Gray's \"Elegy;\" Mrs. Hemans's \"Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers;\" Cowper's \"My Mother's Picture;\" Jones's \"What Constitutes a State;\" Scott's \"Lochinvar;\" Halleck's \"Marco Bozzaris;\" Drake's \"American Flag;\" and Mrs. Thrale's \"Three Warnings.\" As an introduction to the thought, imagery and diction of Shakespeare, there were \"Hamlet's Soliloquy,\" \"Speech of Henry Fifth to his Troops,\" \"Othello's Apology,\" \"The Fall of Cardinal Wolsey\" and his death, the \"Quarrel of Brutus and Cassius\" (often committed to memory and spoken) and Antony's Oration over dead Caesar. The extracts from orations were chosen largely for their relation to great events in history. There were Patrick Henry's \"Speech before the Virginia Convention,\" Walpole's \"Reproof of Mr. Pitt,\" and Pitt's reply. Who cannot remember \"The atrocious crime of being a young man,\" and go on with the context? There were extracts from Hayne's \"Speech on South Carolina,\" and Webster's reply defending Massachusetts; a part of Burke's long speech on the Trial of Warren Hastings prefaced by Macaulay's description of the scene; Webster's \"Speech on the Trial of a Murderer,\" ending with \"It must be confessed, it will be confessed; there is no refuge from confession but suicide, and suicide is confession;\" Webster's speech on the Importance of the Union with its concluding sentiment, \"Liberty and Union, now and forever; one and inseparable.\" There was also Fox's \"Political Pause\" with its wonderful requirements of inflection to express irony; Sprague's \"American Indians,\" \"Not many generations ago, where you now sit, encircled with all that exalts and embellishes civilized life, the rank thistle nodded in the wind, and the wild fox dug his hole unscared.\" Did you not commit it to memory and speak it? Then there was Webster's Speech in which he supplied John Adams from his own fervid imagination that favorite of all patriotic boys, \"Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish; I give my hand and my heart to this vote.\" At its close, \"it is my living sentiment, and, by the blessing of God, it shall be my dying sentiment; independence now, and independence forever.\"  [Literary Selections]  From the essayists there was Lamb's \"Eulogy on Candle Light;\" that delightful \"Eulogy on Debt\" from an unknown author; Addison's \"Allegory on Discontent,\" and \"Westminster Abbey;\" and Jane Taylor's \"Discontented Pendulum.\" Only seven selections were taken from the Bible; but one of these was Paul's Defense before Agrippa. There were, however, quite a number of articles of strongly religious tendency, like Dr. Spring's \"Observance of the Sabbath.\"  The book contained two hundred and thirty-five selections and of this number nearly one-half appeared in all subsequent revisions.  This Rhetorical Guide or Fifth Reader is the book that by its careful selection of specimens of the best English literature in prose and verse contributed most to the training of its readers toward the appreciation of true beauty in literature. It contained many pieces of solid and continuous worth,--many that relate closely to the great historical eras of the United States.  [McGuffey's Ancestry]  In the latest revision of the highest reader, made in 1879, one hundred and thirty-eight selections composed the book. Of this number sixty-one were in the original book as prepared by Mr. A.H. McGuffey.  It was an admirable collection of much material that is still prized and which, when carefully read by pupils hungry for thoughtful language, made a deep and lasting impression. In many cases the inmost thought of the author may not have been at once fully apprehended by the young readers; but with advancing years and wider experience in life the stored words became instinct with thought and feeling.   THE AUTHORS.  Dr. William Holmes McGuffey was born September 28, 1800, on the southern border of Washington county, Pa. The family descended from William and Anna (McKittrick) McGuffey who came from Scotland, and landed at Philadelphia. They made a home in the southern part of York county, at which, during the Revolution, General Washington often stopped to refresh himself. In 1789 this family removed to Washington county, Pa.  [The Indian Scouts]  Alexander McGuffey, the father of Dr. McGuffey, was six years old when the family came to America in August, 1774. In 1790, when he was twenty-two years of age, he and his friend, Duncan McArthur, afterward a governor of Ohio, were selected from five young men who volunteered to act as scouts against the Indians in Ohio who were then threatening the frontier settlements in the western part of Virginia and Pennsylvania. These two young men were selected after tests by Samuel Brady to find which could run the fastest, shoot most accurately, and were least afraid of Indians. Alexander McGuffey served in the army three years, venturing his life with small bodies of scouts in the Indian country. He took part in several fights with the Indians. When General St. Clair in 1792 marched north from Cincinnati to meet the Indians, this body of scouts was one day concealed in a swamp near the spring of Castalia, Ohio. There they saw great numbers of Indians passing to meet General St. Clair, and three of the scouts hastened through the Indian country to inform the general. They traveled only at night and hid during the day. One night they marched forty miles. They told General St. Clair what they had seen and again went out to watch the collecting Indians. Three days later St. Clair was defeated. These scouts were then twelve miles away but the retreating soldiers soon overtook them and then the \"woods were alive with Indians.\" The scouts turned eastward and in due time reached Logstown, near Wheeling.  [Indian Warfare]  The next year McArthur, McGuffey and George Sutherland were again sent out by General Wayne to spy the Indians. When only seven or eight miles from Wheeling and west of the Ohio river, they came upon a trail which led to a deer lick. Just at dusk McGuffey, who was leading the party, saw in the path the gaily decorated head-dress of an Indian. It had been placed there by the Indians who were in ambush close by and were ready to shoot any white man who should stop to pick it up. McGuffey saw through the stratagem instantly; without halting, he gave it a kick and shouted \"Indians!\" Several"]]]
