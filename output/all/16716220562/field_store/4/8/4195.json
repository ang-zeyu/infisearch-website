He was gone about two years I think, when I heard of him in      Cincinnati; I repaired thither, with some few friends to aid      me, and succeeded in securing him.       He was taken to Louisville, and on the next morning after      our arrival there, he escaped, almost from before our face,      while we were on the street before the Tavern. He succeeded      in eluding our pursuit, and again reached Canada in safety.       Nothing daunted he returned, after a lapse of some twelve or      eighteen months, with the intention, as I have since      learned, of conducting off his wife and eight or ten more      slaves to Canada.       I got news of his whereabouts, and succeeded in recapturing      him. I took him to Louisville and together with his wife and      child, (she going along with him at her owner's request,)      sold him. He was taken from thence to New Orleans--and from      hence to Red River, Arkansas--and the next news I had of him      he was again wending his way to Canada, and I suppose now is      at or near Detroit.       In relation to his character, it was the general opinion      here that he was a notorious liar, and a rogue. These      things I can procure any number of respectable witnesses to      prove.       In proof of it, he says his mother belonged to James Bibb,      which is a lie, there not having been such a man about here,      much less brother of Secretary Bibb. He says that Bibb's      daughter married A.G. Sibly, when the fact is Sibly married      Judge David White's daughter, and his mother belonged to      White also and is now here, free.       So you will perceive he is guilty of lying for no effect,      and what might it not be supposed he would do where he could      effect anything by it.       I have been more tedious than I should have been, but being      anxious to give you his rascally conduct in full, must be my      apology.

Respectfully yours, &c,                                                SILAS GATEWOOD.       TO C.H. STEWART, ESQ.         *       *       *       *       *       [No. 3. An Extract.]           CINCINNATI, _March 10, 1845_.       MY DEAR SIR:--Mrs. Path, Nickens and Woodson did not see      Bibb on his first visit, in 1837, when he staid with Job      Dundy, but were subsequently told of it by Bibb. They first      saw him in May, 1838. Mrs. Path remembers this date because      it was the month in which she removed from Broadway to      Harrison street, and Bibb assisted her to remove. Mrs.      Path's garden adjoined Dundy's back yard. While engaged in      digging up flowers, she was addressed by Bibb, who was      staying with Dundy, and who offered to dig them up for her.      She hired him to do it. Mrs. Dundy shortly after called over      and told Mrs. Path that he was a slave. After that Mrs. Path      took him into her house and concealed him. While concealed,      he astonished his good protectress by his ingenuity in      bottoming chairs with cane. When the furniture was removed,      Bibb insisted on helping, and was, after some remonstrances,      permitted. At the house on Harrison street, he was employed      for several days in digging a cellar, and was so employed      when seized on Saturday afternoon by the constables. He      held frequent conversations with Mrs. Path and others, in      which he gave them the same account which he has given you.       On Saturday afternoon, two noted slave-catching constables,      E.V. Brooks and O'Neil, surprised Bibb as he was digging in      the cellar. Bibb sprang for the fence and gained the top of      it, where he was seized and dragged back. They took him      immediately before William Doty, a Justice of infamous      notoriety as an accomplice of kidnappers, proved property,      paid charges and took him away.       His distressed friends were surprised by his re-appearance      in a few days after, the Wednesday following, as they think.      He reached the house of Dr. Woods, (a colored man since      deceased,) before day-break, and staid until dusk. Mrs.      Path, John Woodson and others made up about twelve dollars      for him. Woodson accompanied him out of town a mile and bid      him \"God speed.\" He has never been here since. Woodson and      Clark saw him at Detroit two years ago.                                          Yours truly,                                         WILLIAM BIRNEY.         *       *       *       *       *       [No. 4.]                      LOUISVILLE, _March 14, 1845_.       MR. STEWART.--Yours of the 1st came to hand on the 13th      inst. You wished me to inform you what became of a boy that      was in the work-house in the fall of '39. The boy you allude      to went by the name of Walton; he had ran away from Kentucky      some time before, and returned for his wife--was caught and      sold to Garrison; he was taken to Louisiana, I think--he was      sold on Red River to a planter. As Garrison is absent in the      City of New Orleans at this time, I cannot inform you who he      was sold to. Garrison will be in Louisville some time this      Spring; if you wish me, I will inquire of Garrison and      inform you to whom he was sold, and where his master lives      at this time.                                          Yours,                                           W. PORTER.         *       *       *       *       *       [No. 5.]                       BEDFORD, TRIMBLE COUNTY, KY.      C.H. STEWART, ESQ.,       SIR.--I received your note on the 16th inst., and in      accordance with it I write you these lines. You stated that      you would wish to know something about Walton H. Bibb, and      whether he had a wife and child, and whether they were sold      to New Orleans. Sir, before I answer these inquiries, I      should like to know who Charles H. Stewart is, and why you      should make these inquiries of me, and how you knew who I      was, as you are a stranger to me and I must be to you. In      your next if you will tell me the intention of your      inquiries, I will give you a full history of the whole case.       I have a boy in your county by the name of King, a large man      and very black; if you are acquainted with him, give him my      compliments, and tell him I am well, and all of his friends.      W.H. Bibb is acquainted with him.       I wait your answer.                                          Your most obedient,                                             W.H. GATEWOOD.       _March 17, 1845_.         *       *       *       *       *       [No. 6.]              BEDFORD, KENTUCKY, _April 6th, 1845_.      MR. CHARLES H. STEWART.       SIR:--Yours of the 1st March is before me, inquiring if one      Walton Bibb, a colored man, escaped from me at Louisville,      Ky., in the Spring of 1839. To that inquiry I answer, he      did. The particulars are these: He ran off from William      Gatewood some time in 1838 I think, and was heard of in      Cincinnati. Myself and some others went there and took him,      and took him to Louisville for sale, by the directions of      his master. While there he made his escape and was gone some      time, I think about one year or longer. He came back it was      said, to get his wife and child, so report says. He was      again taken by his owner; he together with his wife and      child was taken to Louisville and sold to a man who traded      in negroes, and was taken by him to New Orleans and sold      with his wife and child to some man up Red River, so I was      informed by the man who sold him. He then ran off and left      his wife and child and got back, it seems, to your country.      I can say for Gatewood he was a good master, and treated him      well. Gatewood bought him from a Mr. Sibly, who was going      to send him down the river. Walton, to my knowledge,      influenced Gatewood to buy him, and promised if he would,      never to disobey him or run off. Who he belongs to now, I do      not know. I know Gatewood sold his wife and child at a great      sacrifice, to satisfy him. If any other information is      necessary I will give it, if required. You will please write      me again what he is trying to do in your country, or what he      wishes the inquiry from me for.                                          Yours, truly,                                            DANIEL S. LANE.         *       *       *       *       *  These letters need little comment. Their testimony combined is most harmonious and conclusive. Look at the points established.  1. Hiram Wilson gives the testimony of reputable men now in Canada, who knew Henry Bibb as a slave in Kentucky.  2. Silas Gatewood, with a peculiar relish, fills three pages of foolscap, \"being anxious to give his rascally conduct in full,\" as he says. But he vaults over the saddle and lands on the other side. His testimony is invaluable as an endorsement of Mr. Bibb's truthfulness. He illustrates all the essential facts of this narrative. He also labors to prove him deceitful and a liar.  Deceit in a slave, is only a slight reflex of the stupendous fraud practised by his master. And its indulgence has far more logic in its favor, than the ablest plea ever written for slave holding, under ever such peculiar circumstances. The attempt to prove Mr. Bibb in the lie, is a signal failure, as he never affirmed what Gatewood denies. With this offset, the letter under notice is a triumphant vindication of one, whom he thought there by to injure sadly. As Mr. Bibb has most happily acknowledged the wheat, (see page 130,) I pass"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15398"],["title","Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Henry Bibb, an American Slave, Written (#2)"],["body"," charge of stealing by referring to the logic there used, which will be deemed convincing.  3. William Birney, Esq., attests the facts of Mr. Bibb's arrest in Cincinnati, and the subsequent escape, as narrated by him, from the declaration of eye witnesses.  4. W. Porter, Jailor, states that Bibb was in the work-house at Louisville, held and sold afterwards to the persons and at the places named in this volume.  5. W.H. Gatewood, with much Southern dignity, will answer no questions, but shows his relation to these matters by naming \"King\"--saying, \"W.H. Bibb is acquainted with him,\" and promising \"a full history of the case.\"  6. Daniel S. Lane, with remarkable straight-forwardness and stupidity, tells all he knows, and then wants to know what they ask him for. The writer will answer that question. He wanted to prove by two or more witnesses, the truth of his own statements; which has most surely been accomplished.  Having thus presented an array of testimony sustaining the facts alleged in this narrative, the introduction will be concluded by introducing a letter signed by respectable men of Detroit, and endorsed by Judge Wilkins, showing the high esteem in which Mr. Bibb is held by those who know him well where he makes his home. Their testimony expresses their present regard as well as an opinion of his past character. It is introduced here with the greatest satisfaction, as the writer is assured, from an intimate acquaintance with Henry Bibb, that all who know him hereafter will entertain the same sentiments toward him:         *       *       *       *       *                                        DETROIT, _March 10, 1845_.       The undersigned have pleasure in recommending Henry Bibb to      the kindness and confidence of Anti-slavery friends in every      State. He has resided among us for some years. His      deportment, his conduct, and his Christian course have won      our esteem and affection. The narrative of his sufferings      and more early life has been thoroughly investigated by a      Committee appointed for the purpose. They sought evidence      respecting it in every proper quarter, and their report      attested its undoubted truth. In this conclusion we all      cordially unite.       H. Bibb has for some years publicly made this narrative to      assemblies, whose number cannot be told; it has commanded      public attention in this State, and provoked inquiry.      Occasionally too we see persons from the South, who knew him      in early years, yet not a word or fact worthy of impairing      its truth has reached us; but on the contrary, every thing      tended to its corroboration.       Mr. Bibb's Anti-slavery efforts in this State have produced      incalculable benefit. The Lord has blessed him into an      instrument of great power. He has labored much, and for very      inadequate compensation. Lucrative offers for other quarters      did not tempt him to a more profitable field. His sincerity      and disinterestedness are therefore beyond suspicion.       We bid him \"God-speed,\" on his route. We bespeak for him      every kind consideration. * * * *                                    H. HALLOCK,                         President of the Detroit Lib.

LUCIUS C. MATLACK.       NEW YORK CITY, _July 1st, 1849_.     AUTHOR'S PREFACE.   This work has been written during irregular intervals, while I have been travelling and laboring for the emancipation of my enslaved countrymen. The reader will remember that I make no pretension to literature; for I can truly say, that I have been educated in the school of adversity, whips, and chains. Experience and observation have been my principal teachers, with the exception of three weeks schooling which I have had the good fortune to receive since my escape from the \"grave yard of the mind,\" or the dark prison of human bondage. And nothing but untiring perseverance has enabled me to prepare this volume for the public eye; and I trust by the aid of Divine Providence to be able to make it intelligible and instructive. I thank God for the blessings of Liberty--the contrast is truly great between freedom and slavery. To be changed from a chattel to a human being, is no light matter, though the process with myself practically was very simple. And if I could reach the ears of every slave to-day, throughout the whole continent of America, I would teach the same lesson, I would sound it in the ears of every hereditary bondman, \"break your chains and fly for freedom!\"  It may be asked why I have written this work, when there has been so much already written and published of the same character from other fugitives? And, why publish it after having told it publicly all through New England and the Western States to multiplied thousands?  My answer is, that in no place have I given orally the detail of my narrative; and some of the most interesting events of my life have never reached the public ear. Moreover, it was at the request of many friends of down-trodden humanity, that I have undertaken to write the following sketch, that light and truth might be spread on the sin and evils of slavery as far as possible. I also wanted to leave my humble testimony on record against this man-destroying system, to be read by succeeding generations when my body shall lie mouldering in the dust.  But I would not attempt by any sophistry to misrepresent slavery in order to prove its dreadful wickedness. For, I presume there are none who may read this narrative through, whether Christians or slaveholders, males or females, but what will admit it to be a system of the most high-handed oppression and tyranny that ever was tolerated by an enlightened nation.                                          HENRY BIBB     NARRATIVE  OF THE  LIFE OF HENRY BIBB     CHAPTER I.  _Sketch of my Parentage.--Early separation from my Mother.--Hard Fare.--First Experiments at running away.--Earnest longing for Freedom.--Abhorrent nature of Slavery._   I was born May 1815, of a slave mother, in Shelby County, Kentucky, and was claimed as the property of David White Esq. He came into possession of my mother long before I was born. I was brought up in the Counties of Shelby, Henry, Oldham, and Trimble. Or, more correctly speaking, in the above counties, I may safely say, I was _flogged up_; for where I should have received moral, mental, and religious instruction, I received stripes without number, the object of which was to degrade and keep me in subordination. I can truly say, that I drank deeply of the bitter cup of suffering and woe. I have been dragged down to the lowest depths of human degradation and wretchedness, by Slaveholders.  My mother was known by the name of Milldred Jackson. She is the mother of seven slaves only, all being sons, of whom I am the eldest. She was also so fortunate or unfortunate, as to have some of what is called the slaveholding blood flowing in her veins. I know not how much; but not enough to prevent her children though fathered by slaveholders, from being bought and sold in the slave markets of the South. It is almost impossible for slaves to give a correct account of their male parentage. All that I know about it is, that my mother informed me that my fathers name was JAMES BIBB. He was doubtless one of the present Bibb family of Kentucky; but I have no personal knowledge of him at all, for he died before my recollection.  The first time I was separated from my mother, I was young and small. I knew nothing of my condition then as a slave. I was living with Mr. White, whose wife died and left him a widower with one little girl, who was said to be the legitimate owner of my mother, and all her children. This girl was also my playmate when we were children.  I was taken away from my mother, and hired out to labor for various persons, eight or ten years in succession; and all my wages were expended for the education of Harriet White, my playmate. It was then my sorrows and sufferings commenced. It was then I first commenced seeing and feeling that I was a wretched slave, compelled to work under the lash without wages, and often without clothes enough to hide my nakedness. I have often worked without half enough to eat, both late and early, by day and by night. I have often laid my wearied limbs down at night to rest upon a dirt floor, or a bench, without any covering at all, because I had no where else to rest my wearied body, after having worked hard all the day. I have also been compelled in early life, to go at the bidding of a tyrant, through all kinds of weather, hot or cold, wet or dry, and without shoes frequently, until the month of December,"]]]
