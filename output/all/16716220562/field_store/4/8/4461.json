It's a perfectly complete family!  Packing your trunk and going away is more fun than staying behind.  I am terribly excited at the prospect.  Seventh hour--I must run to rehearsal.  I'm to be in the Thanksgiving theatricals.  A prince in a tower with a velvet tunic and yellow curls. Isn't that a lark?                                         Yours,                                                    J. A.                                                        Saturday  Do you want to know what I look like?  Here's a photograph of all three that Leonora Fenton took.  The light one who is laughing is Sallie, and the tall one with her nose in the air is Julia, and the little one with the hair blowing across her face is Judy--she is really more beautiful than that, but the sun was in her eyes.                                    'STONE GATE',                                    WORCESTER, MASS.,                                          31st December  Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,  I meant to write to you before and thank you for your Christmas cheque, but life in the McBride household is very absorbing, and I don't seem able to find two consecutive minutes to spend at a desk.  I bought a new gown--one that I didn't need, but just wanted.  My Christmas present this year is from Daddy-Long-Legs; my family just sent love.  I've been having the most beautiful vacation visiting Sallie.  She lives in a big old-fashioned brick house with white trimmings set back from the street--exactly the kind of house that I used to look at so curiously when I was in the John Grier Home, and wonder what it could be like inside.  I never expected to see with my own eyes--but here I am!  Everything is so comfortable and restful and homelike; I walk from room to room and drink in the furnishings.  It is the most perfect house for children to be brought up in; with shadowy nooks for hide and seek, and open fire places for pop-corn, and an attic to romp in on rainy days and slippery banisters with a comfortable flat knob at the bottom, and a great big sunny kitchen, and a nice, fat, sunny cook who has lived in the family thirteen years and always saves out a piece of dough for the children to bake.  Just the sight of such a house makes you want to be a child all over again.  And as for families!  I never dreamed they could be so nice.  Sallie has a father and mother and grandmother, and the sweetest three-year-old baby sister all over curls, and a medium-sized brother who always forgets to wipe his feet, and a big, good-looking brother named Jimmie, who is a junior at Princeton.  We have the jolliest times at the table--everybody laughs and jokes and talks at once, and we don't have to say grace beforehand.  It's a relief not having to thank Somebody for every mouthful you eat.  (I dare say I'm blasphemous; but you'd be, too, if you'd offered as much obligatory thanks as I have.)  Such a lot of things we've done--I can't begin to tell you about them. Mr. McBride owns a factory and Christmas eve he had a tree for the employees' children.  It was in the long packing-room which was decorated with evergreens and holly.  Jimmie McBride was dressed as Santa Claus and Sallie and I helped him distribute the presents.  Dear me, Daddy, but it was a funny sensation!  I felt as benevolent as a Trustee of the John Grier home.  I kissed one sweet, sticky little boy--but I don't think I patted any of them on the head!  And two days after Christmas, they gave a dance at their own house for ME.  It was the first really true ball I ever attended--college doesn't count where we dance with girls.  I had a new white evening gown (your Christmas present--many thanks) and long white gloves and white satin slippers.  The only drawback to my perfect, utter, absolute happiness was the fact that Mrs. Lippett couldn't see me leading the cotillion with Jimmie McBride.  Tell her about it, please, the next time you visit the J. G. H.                         Yours ever,                                     Judy Abbott   PS.  Would you be terribly displeased, Daddy, if I didn't turn out to be a Great Author after all, but just a Plain Girl?                                            6.30, Saturday  Dear Daddy,  We started to walk to town today, but mercy! how it poured.  I like winter to be winter with snow instead of rain.  Julia's desirable uncle called again this afternoon--and brought a five-pound box of chocolates.  There are advantages, you see, about rooming with Julia.  Our innocent prattle appeared to amuse him and he waited for a later train in order to take tea in the study.  We had an awful lot of trouble getting permission.  It's hard enough entertaining fathers and grandfathers, but uncles are a step worse; and as for brothers and cousins, they are next to impossible.  Julia had to swear that he was her uncle before a notary public and then have the county clerk's certificate attached.  (Don't I know a lot of law?) And even then I doubt if we could have had our tea if the Dean had chanced to see how youngish and good-looking Uncle Jervis is.  Anyway, we had it, with brown bread Swiss cheese sandwiches.  He helped make them and then ate four.  I told him that I had spent last summer at Lock Willow, and we had a beautiful gossipy time about the Semples, and the horses and cows and chickens.  All the horses that he used to know are dead, except Grover, who was a baby colt at the time of his last visit--and poor Grove now is so old he can just limp about the pasture.  He asked if they still kept doughnuts in a yellow crock with a blue plate over it on the bottom shelf of the pantry--and they do!  He wanted to know if there was still a woodchuck's hole under the pile of rocks in the night pasture--and there is!  Amasai caught a big, fat, grey one there this summer, the twenty-fifth great-grandson of the one Master Jervis caught when he was a little boy.  I called him 'Master Jervie' to his face, but he didn't appear to be insulted.  Julia says she has never seen him so amiable; he's usually pretty unapproachable.  But Julia hasn't a bit of tact; and men, I find, require a great deal.  They purr if you rub them the right way and spit if you don't. (That isn't a very elegant metaphor.  I mean it figuratively.)  We're reading Marie Bashkirtseff's journal.  Isn't it amazing?  Listen to this:  'Last night I was seized by a fit of despair that found utterance in moans, and that finally drove me to throw the dining-room clock into the sea.'  It makes me almost hope I'm not a genius; they must be very wearing to have about--and awfully destructive to the furniture.  Mercy! how it keeps Pouring.  We shall have to swim to chapel tonight.                                 Yours ever,                                                Judy                                                    20th Jan.  Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,  Did you ever have a sweet baby girl who was stolen from the cradle in infancy?  Maybe I am she!  If we were in a novel, that would be the denouement, wouldn't it?  It's really awfully queer not to know what one is--sort of exciting and romantic.  There are such a lot of possibilities.  Maybe I'm not American; lots of people aren't. I may be straight descended from the ancient Romans, or I may be a Viking's daughter, or I may be the child of a Russian exile and belong by rights in a Siberian prison, or maybe I'm a Gipsy--I think perhaps I am.  I have a very WANDERING spirit, though I haven't as yet had much chance to develop it.  Do you know about that one scandalous blot in my career the time I ran away from the asylum because they punished me for stealing cookies? It's down in the books free for any Trustee to read.  But really, Daddy, what could you expect?  When you put a hungry little nine-year girl in the pantry scouring knives, with the cookie jar at her elbow, and go off and leave her alone; and then suddenly pop in again, wouldn't you expect to find her a bit crumby?  And then when you jerk her by the elbow and box her ears, and make her leave the table when the pudding comes, and tell all the other children that it's because she's a thief, wouldn't you expect her to run away?  I only ran four miles.  They caught me and brought me back; and every day for a week I was tied, like a naughty puppy, to a stake in the back yard while the other children were out at recess.  Oh, dear!  There's the chapel bell, and after chapel I have a committee meeting.  I'm sorry because I meant to write you a very entertaining letter this time.                                 Auf wiedersehen                                    Cher Daddy,                                        Pax tibi!                                                    Judy   PS.  There's one thing I'm perfectly sure of I'm not a Chinaman.                                                    4th February  Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,  Jimmie McBride has sent me a Princeton banner as big as one end of the room; I am very grateful to him for remembering me, but I don't know what on earth to do with it.  Sallie and Julia won't let me hang it up; our room this year is furnished in red, and you can imagine what an effect we'd have if I added orange and black.  But it's such nice, warm, thick felt, I hate to waste it.  Would it be very improper to have it made into a bath robe?  My old one shrank when it was washed.  I've entirely omitted of late telling you what I am learning, but though you might not imagine it from my letters, my time is exclusively occupied with study.  It's a very bewildering matter to get educated in five branches at once.  'The test of true scholarship,' says Chemistry Professor, 'is a painstaking passion for detail.'  'Be careful not to keep your eyes glued to detail,' says History Professor.  'Stand far enough away to get a perspective of the whole.'

ADDRESSED TO  THE DUKE OF PORTLAND AND LORD FITZWILLIAM.  1793.     LETTER  TO  HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF PORTLAND.   MY DEAR LORD,--The paper which I take the liberty of sending to your Grace was, for the greater part, written during the last session. A few days after the prorogation some few observations were added. I was, however, resolved to let it lie by me for a considerable time, that, on viewing the matter at a proper distance, and when the sharpness of recent impressions had been worn off, I might be better able to form a just estimate of the value of my first opinions.  I have just now read it over very coolly and deliberately. My latest judgment owns my first sentiments and reasonings, in their full force, with regard both to persons and things.  During a period of four years, the state of the world, except for some few and short intervals, has filled me with a good deal of serious inquietude. I considered a general war against Jacobins and Jacobinism as the only possible chance of saving Europe (and England as included in Europe) from a truly frightful revolution. For this I have been censured, as receiving through weakness, or spreading through fraud and artifice, a false alarm. Whatever others may think of the matter, that alarm, in my mind, is by no means quieted. The state of affairs _abroad_ is not so much mended as to make me, for one, full of confidence. At _home_, I see no abatement whatsoever in the zeal of the partisans of Jacobinism towards their cause, nor any cessation in their efforts to do mischief. What is doing by Lord Lauderdale on the first scene of Lord George Gordon's actions, and in his spirit, is not calculated to remove my apprehensions. They pursue their first object with as much eagerness as ever, but with more dexterity. Under the plausible name of peace, by which they delude or are deluded, they would deliver us unarmed and defenceless to the confederation of Jacobins, whose centre is indeed in France, but whose rays proceed in every direction throughout the world. I understand that Mr. Coke, of Norfolk, has been lately very busy in spreading a disaffection to this war (which we carry on for our being) in the country in which his property gives him so great an influence. It is truly alarming to see so large a part of the aristocratic interest engaged in the cause of the new species of democracy, which is openly attacking or secretly undermining the system of property by which mankind has hitherto been governed. But we are not to delude ourselves. No man can be connected with a party which professes publicly to admire or may be justly suspected of secretly abetting this French Revolution, who must not be drawn into its vortex, and become the instrument of its designs.  What I have written is in the manner of apology. I have given it that form, as being the most respectful; but I do not stand in need of any apology for my principles, my sentiments, or my conduct. I wish the paper I lay before your Grace to be considered as my most deliberate, solemn, and even testamentary protest against the proceedings and doctrines which have hitherto produced so much mischief in the world, and which will infallibly produce more, and possibly greater. It is my protest against the delusion by which some have been taught to look upon this Jacobin contest at home as an ordinary party squabble about place or patronage, and to regard this Jacobin war abroad as a common war about trade or territorial boundaries, or about a political balance of power among rival or jealous states. Above all, it is my protest against that mistake or perversion of sentiment by which they who agree with us in our principles may on collateral considerations be regarded as enemies, and those who, in this perilous crisis of all human affairs, differ from us fundamentally and practically, as our best friends. Thus persons of great importance may be made to turn the whole of their influence to the destruction of their principles.  I now make it my humble request to your Grace, that you will not give any sort of answer to the paper I send, or to this letter, except barely to let me know that you have received them. I even wish that at present you may not read the paper which I transmit: lock it up in the drawer of your library-table; and when a day of compulsory reflection comes, then be pleased to turn to it. Then remember that your Grace had a true friend, who had, comparatively with men of your description, a very small interest in opposing the modern system of morality and policy, but who, under every discouragement, was faithful to public duty and to private friendship. I shall then probably be dead. I am sure I do not wish to live to see such things. But whilst I do live, I shall pursue the same course, although my merits should be taken for unpardonable faults, and as such avenged, not only on myself, but on my posterity.  Adieu, my dear Lord; and do me the justice to believe me ever, with most sincere respect, veneration, and affectionate attachment,  Your Grace's most faithful friend,  And most obedient humble servant,  EDMUND BURKE.  BEACONSFIELD, Sept. 29, 1793.     OBSERVATIONS.   Approaching towards the close of a long period of public service, it is natural I should be desirous to stand well (I hope I do stand tolerably well) with that public which, with whatever fortune, I have endeavored faithfully and zealously to serve.  I am also not a little anxious for some place in the estimation of the two persons to whom I address this paper. I have always acted with them, and with those whom they represent. To my knowledge, I have not deviated, no, not in the minutest point, from their opinions and principles. Of late, without any alteration in their sentiments or in mine, a difference of a very unusual nature, and which, under the circumstances, it is not easy to describe, has arisen between us.  In my journey with them through life, I met Mr. Fox in my road; and I travelled with him very cheerfully, as long as he appeared to me to pursue the same direction with those in whose company I set out. In the latter stage of our progress a new scheme of liberty and equality was produced in the world, which either dazzled his imagination, or was suited to some new walks of ambition which were then opened to his view. The whole frame and fashion of his politics appear to have suffered about that time a very material alteration. It is about three years since, in consequence of that extraordinary change, that, after a pretty long preceding period of distance, coolness, and want of confidence, if not total alienation on his part, a complete public separation has been made between that gentleman and me. Until lately the breach between us appeared reparable. I trusted that time and reflection, and a decisive experience of the mischiefs which have flowed from the proceedings and the system of France, on which our difference had arisen, as well as the known sentiments of the best and wisest of our common friends upon that subject, would have brought him to a safer way of thinking. Several of his friends saw no security for keeping things in a proper train after this excursion of his, but in the reunion of the party on its old grounds, under the Duke of Portland. Mr. Fox, if he pleased, might have been comprehended in that system, with the rank and consideration to which his great talents entitle him, and indeed must secure to him in any party arrangement that _could_ be made. The Duke of Portland knows how much I wished for, and how earnestly I labored that reunion, and upon terms that might every way be honorable and advantageous to Mr. Fox. His conduct in the last session has extinguished these hopes forever.  Mr. Fox has lately published in print a defence of his conduct. On taking into consideration that defence, a society of gentlemen, called the Whig Club, thought proper to come to the following resolution:--\"That their confidence in Mr. Fox is confirmed, strengthened, and increased by the calumnies against him.\"  To that resolution my two noble friends, the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam, have given their concurrence.  The calumnies supposed in that resolution can be nothing else than the objections taken to Mr. Fox's conduct in this session of Parliament; for to them, and to them alone, the resolution refers."]]]
