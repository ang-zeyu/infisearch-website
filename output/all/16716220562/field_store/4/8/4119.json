UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE TAILOR BIRD        195     Uncle Wiggily's Travels     STORY I  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE RED SQUIRREL   You know when Uncle Wiggily Longears, the old rabbit gentleman, started out to look for his fortune, he had to travel many weary miles, and many adventures happened to him. Some of those adventures I have told you in the book just before this one, and now I am going to tell you about his travels when he hoped to find a lot of money, so he would be rich.  One day, as I told you in the last story in the other book, Uncle Wiggily came to a farm, and there he had quite an adventure with a little boy. And this little boy had on red trousers, because, I guess, his blue ones were in the washtub. Anyhow, he and the rabbit gentleman became good friends.  And now I am going to tell you what happened when Uncle Wiggily met the red squirrel.  \"Where do you think you will go to look for your fortune to-day, Uncle Wiggily?\" asked the little boy with the red trousers the next morning, after the rabbit had stayed all night at the farm house.  \"I do not know,\" said the rabbit gentleman. \"Perhaps I had better do some traveling at night. I couldn't find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but perhaps there may be a gold, or silver fortune, at the end of a moon-beam. I think I'll try.\"  \"Oh, but don't you get sleepy at night?\" asked the little boy's mother as she fried an ice cream cone for Uncle Wiggily's breakfast.  \"Well, I could sleep in the day time, and then I would stay awake at night,\" answered the traveling uncle, blinking his ears.  \"Oh, but aren't you afraid of the bogeyman at night?\" inquired the boy with the red hair--I mean trousers.  \"There are no such things as bogeymen,\" said Uncle Wiggily, \"and if there were any, they would not harm you. I am not a bit afraid in the dark, except that I don't like mosquitoes to bite me. I think I'll travel to-morrow night, and look for gold at the end of the moon-beam.\"  So he started off that day, and he went only a short distance, for he wanted to find a place to sleep in order that he would be wide awake when it got dark.  Well, he found a nice, soft place under a pile of hay, and there he stretched out to slumber as nicely as if he were in his bed at home. He even snored a little bit, I believe, or else it was Bully Frog croaking one of his songs.  The day passed, and the sun went down, and it got all ready to be night, and still Uncle Wiggily slept on soundly. But all of a sudden he heard voices whispering:  \"Now you go that way and I'll go this way, and we'll catch that rabbit and put him in a cage and sell him!\"  Well, you can just believe that Uncle Wiggily was frightened when he awakened suddenly and saw two bad boys softly creeping up and making ready to catch him.  \"Oh, this is no place for me!\" the rabbit cried, and he grabbed up his crutch and his valise and hopped away so fast that the boys couldn't catch him, no matter how fast they could run, even bare-footed.  \"Let's throw stones at him!\" they cried. And they did, but I'm glad to say that none of them hit Uncle Wiggily. Isn't it queer how mean some boys can be? But perhaps they were never told any better, so we'll forgive them this time.  \"Well, it is now night,\" said the rabbit gentleman as he hopped on through the woods, \"so I think I will sit under this tree and wait for the moon to come up. And while I'm waiting I'll eat my supper.\"  So Uncle Wiggily ate his supper, which the kind farmer lady had put up for him, and then he sat and waited for the moon to rise, and pretty soon he heard a funny noise, calling like this:  \"Who? Who? Who-tu-tu-tu.\"  \"Oh, you know who I am all right, Mr. Owl,\" said the rabbit. \"You can see very well at night. You can see me.\"  \"My goodness, if it isn't Uncle Wiggily!\" cried the owl in surprise. \"What are you doing out so late, I'd like to know?\"  \"Waiting for a moon-beam, so I can see if there is any gold for my fortune at the end of it,\" was the answer. \"Is the moon coming up over the trees, Mr. Owl?\"  \"Yes, here it comes,\" said the owl, \"and now I must fly off to the dark woods, for I don't like the light,\" and he fluttered away.  Then the moon came up, all silver and glorious; shining over the tree tops like a shimmering ball, and soon the moon-beams fell to the ground in slanting rays, but they fell so softly, like feathers, that they did not get hurt at all.  \"Well, I guess I'll follow that big one,\" said the old gentleman rabbit, as he picked out a nice, broad, large, shiny moon-beam. \"That must have gold at the end, and, if I find it, my fortune is made.\" So off he started to follow the moon-beam to where it came to an end.  It seemed to go quite a distance through the dark woods, and Uncle Wiggily traveled on for several hours, and he didn't seem to be any nearer the end by that time than he was at first.  \"My land, this is a very long beam,\" he exclaimed. \"It is almost big enough to make a church steeple from. But I'll keep on a little longer, for I'm not a bit sleepy yet.\"  Well, all of a sudden, just as he was turning the corner around a big stone, the rabbit gentleman heard a funny noise.  It wasn't like any one crying, yet it sounded as if some one was in trouble, for the voice said:  \"Oh, dear! I'll never get it big enough, I know I can't! I've combed it and brushed it, and done it up in curl papers to make it fluffy, but still it isn't like theirs. What shall I do?\"  \"Hum, I wonder who that can be?\" thought Uncle Wiggily. \"Perhaps it is some little lost child; but no children would be out in the woods at night. I'll take a look.\"  So he hopped softly over, and peered around the edge of the stone, and what do you think he saw?  Why, there was a nice, little, red squirrel-girl, and she had a comb and a brush, and little looking-glass. And the glass was stuck up on a stump where the moon-beam that Uncle Wiggily was following shone on it and reflected back again. And by the light of the moon-beam the red squirrel was combing and brushing out her tail as hard as she"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15282"],["title","Uncle Wiggily's Travels (#1)"],["body","comb and brush it.  \"What are you doing?\" asked Uncle Wiggily in surprise.  \"Oh, my! How you startled me!\" exclaimed the red squirrel. \"But I'm glad it's you, Uncle Wiggily. I'm going to a surprise party soon, and I was just trying to make my tail as big as Johnnie or Billie Bushytail's, but I can't do it,\" she said sadly.  \"No, and you never can,\" said the rabbit. \"Their tails are a different kind than yours, for they are gray squirrels and you are a red one. But yours is very nice. Be content to have yours as it is.\"  \"I guess I will,\" said the red squirrel. \"But what are you doing out so late, Uncle Wiggily?\"  \"Looking for the end of the moon-beam to get my fortune.\"  \"Ha! The moon-beam ends right here,\" said the red squirrel-girl, pointing to her looking-glass, and, surely enough, there the bright shaft of light ended. \"But there is no fortune here, Uncle Wiggily, I am sorry to say,\" she added.  \"I see there isn't,\" answered the rabbit. \"Well, I must travel on again to-morrow, then. But now I will see that you get safely home, for it is getting late.\"  And, just as he said that, what should happen but that a black, savage, ugly bear stuck his nose out of the bushes and made a grab for the rabbit. But what do you think the red squirrel did?  She just took her hair brush and with the hard back of it she whacked the bear on the end of his tender-ender nose, and he howled, and turned around to run away, and the squirrel girl tickled him with the comb, and he ran faster than ever, and the bear didn't eat Uncle Wiggily that night.  Then the rabbit stayed at the red squirrel's mamma's house the rest of the evening, and the next day the squirrel went to the surprise party with her tail the regular size it ought to be, and not as big as the Bushytail brothers' tails, and everybody was happy.  Now in case the granddaddy longlegs doesn't tickle the baby with his long cow-pointing leg and make her laugh so she gets the hiccoughs, I'll tell you in the next story about Uncle Wiggily and the brown wren.     STORY II  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BROWN WREN   Well, just as I expected, the granddaddy longlegs did tickle the baby, but she only smiled in her sleep, and didn't awaken, so, as it's nice and quiet I can tell you another story. And it's going to be about how Uncle Wiggily, in his travels about the country, in search of his fortune, helped a little brown wren.  \"Well, where are you going this morning?\" asked the red squirrel's mother as Uncle Wiggily finished his breakfast, and shook out from his long ears the oatmeal crumbs that had fallen in them.  \"Oh, I suppose I will have to be traveling on,\" answered the rabbit. \"That fortune of mine seems to be a long distance off. I've tried rainbows and moon-beams and I didn't find any money at their ends. I guess I'll have to look under the water next, but I'll wait until I get back home, and then I'll have Jimmie Wibblewobble the duck boy put his head at the bottom of the pond and see if there is any gold down there.\"  So off the old gentleman rabbit started, limping on his crutch, for his rheumatism was troubling him again, and at his side swung his valise, with some crackers and cheese and bread and butter and jam in it--plenty of jam, too, let me tell you, for the red squirrel's mamma could make lovely preserves, and this was carrot jam, with turnip frosting on it.  Well, Uncle Wiggily traveled on and on, over the hills and through the deep woods, and pretty soon he came to a place where he saw a lot of little black ants trying to carry to their nest a nice big piece of meat that some one had dropped.  \"My, how hard those ants are working,\" thought the rabbit. \"But that meat is too heavy for them. I'll have to help carry it.\"  Now the piece of meat was only as big as a quarter of a small cocoanut, but, of course, that's too big for an ant to carry; or even for forty-'leven ants, so Uncle Wiggily kindly lifted it for them, and put it in their nest.  \"Thank you very much,\" said the biggest ant. \"If ever we can do you a favor, or any of your friends, we will.\"  The old gentleman rabbit said he was glad to hear that, and then, taking up his crutch and valise again, on he went.  Pretty soon he came to a place in the woods where the sun was shining down through the trees, and a little brook was making pretty music over the stones. And then, all at once, the old gentleman rabbit heard a different kind of music, and it was that of a little bird singing. And this is the song.  Now I did not make up this song. It is much prettier than I could write, even if I had my Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes on, and I don't know who did write it. But it used to be in my school reader when I was a little boy, and I liked it very much. I hope whoever did write it won't mind if you sing it. This is it:      \"There's a little brown bird sitting up in a tree,     He's singing to you--he's singing to me.     And what does he say, little girl--little boy?     Oh, the world's running over with joy!\"  Then the bird sang about how there were five eggs laid away up in a nest, and how, pretty soon, little birds would come out from them, and then, all of a sudden, the bird sang like this:      \"But don't meddle,--don't touch,     Little girl--little boy,     Or the world will lose some of its joy!\"  \"Ha! you seem quite happy this beautiful morning,\" said Uncle Wiggily, as he paused under the tree where the bird was singing. \"Why, I do declare,\" he exclaimed. \"If it isn't Mrs. Wren! Well, I never in all my born days! I didn't know you were back from the South yet.\"  \"Yes, Uncle Wiggily,\" said the little brown wren, \"I came up some time ago. But I'm real glad to see you. I'm going to take my little birdies out of the shell pretty soon. They are almost hatched.\"  \"Glad to hear it,\" said the rabbit, politely, and then he told about seeking his fortune, and all of a sudden a great big ugly crow-bird flew down out of a tall tree and made a dash for Mrs. Wren to eat her up. But Mrs. Wren got out of the way just in time, and didn't get caught.  But alack, and alas-a-day! The crow knocked down the wren's nest, and all the sticks and feathers of which it was made were scattered all about, and the eggs, with the little birdies inside, would have been all broken ker-smash, only that they happened to fall down on some soft moss.  \"Oh, dear!\" cried Mrs. Wren, sorrowfully. \"Now see what that crow has done! My home is broken up, and my birdies will be killed.\"  \"Caw! Caw! Caw!\" cried the crow as unkindly as he could, and it sounded just as if he laughed \"Haw! Haw! Haw!\"  \"Oh, whatever shall I do?\" asked Mrs. Wren. \"My birdies will have no nest, and I haven't time to make another and break up the little fine sticks that I need and gather the feathers that are scattered all over. Oh, what shall I do? Soon my birdies will be out of the shells.\"  \"Never fear!\" said Uncle Wiggily, bravely. \"I will help you. I'll gather the sticks for you.\"  \"Oh, but you haven't time; you must be off seeking your fortune,\" answered the wren.  \"Oh, I guess my fortune can wait. It has been waiting for me a long time, and it won't hurt to wait a bit longer. I'll get you the sticks,\" said the rabbit gentleman.  So while Mrs. Wren sat over the eggs to keep them warm with her fluffy feathers, Uncle Wiggily looked for sticks with which to make a new nest. He couldn't find any short and small enough, so what do you think he did?  Why, he took some big sticks and he jumped a jiggily dance up and down on them with his sharp paws, and broke them up as fine as toothpicks for the nest. Then he arranged them as well as he could in a sort of hollow, like a tea cup.  \"Oh, if we only had some feathers now, we would be all right,\" said Mrs. Wren. \"It's a very good nest for a rabbit to make.\"  \"Don't say a word!\" cried some small voices on the ground. \"We will gather up the feathers for you.\" And there came marching up a lot of the little ants that Uncle Wiggily had been kind to, and soon they had gathered up all the scattered feathers. And the nest was made on a mossy stump, and lined with the feathers, and the warm eggs were put in it by Mrs. Wren, who then hovered over them to hatch out the birdies. And she was very thankful to Uncle Wiggily for what he had done.  Now, in case the water in the lake doesn't get inside the milk pail and make lemonade of it, I'll tell you in the next story how the birdies were hatched out, and also about Uncle Wiggily and the sunfish.     STORY III  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SUNFISH   Uncle Wiggily slept that night--I mean the night after he had helped Mrs. Wren build her nest--he slept in an old under-ground house that another rabbit must have made some time before. It was nicely lined with leaves, and the fortune-hunting bunny slept very nice and warm there.  When the sun was up, shining very brightly, and most beautifully, Uncle Wiggily arose, shook his ears to get the dust out of them, and threw the dried-leaf blankets off him.  \"Ah, ha! I must be up and doing,\" he cried. \"Perhaps I shall find my fortune to-day.\"  Well, no sooner had he crawled out of the burrow than he heard a most beautiful song. It was one Mrs. Wren was singing, and it went \"tra-la-la tra-la-la! tum-tee-tee-tum-tum-tee-tee!\" too pretty for anything. And then, afterward, there was a sort of an echo like \"cheep-cheep cheep-cheep!\"  \"Why, you must be very happy this morning, Mrs. Wren!\" called Uncle Wiggily to her as she sat in her new nest which the rabbit had made for her on the mossy stump.  \"I am,\" she answered, \"very happy. What do you think happened in the night?\"  \"I can't guess,\" he answered. \"A burglar crow didn't come and steal your eggs, I hope!\"  \"Oh, nothing sad or bad like that,\" she answered. \"But something very nice. Just hop up here and look.\"  So Uncle Wiggily hopped up on the stump, and Mrs. Wren got off her nest, and there, on the bottom, in among some egg-shells, were a lot of tiny, weeny little birdies, about as big as a spool of silk thread "]]]
