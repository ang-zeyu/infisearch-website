Portions of these sacred books may have been composed as early as 1000 B.C.  Modern Persian is a living representative of the old Iranian speech. It has naturally been much modified by time, particularly through the introduction of many words from the Arabic.  c. _The Armenian_, spoken in Armenia, the district near the Black Sea and Caucasus Mountains. This is closely related to the Iranian, and was formerly classified under that group. It is now recognized as entitled to independent rank. The earliest literary productions of the Armenian language date from the fourth and fifth centuries of the Christian era. To this period belong the translation of the Scriptures and the old Armenian Chronicle. The Armenian is still a living language, though spoken in widely separated districts, owing to the scattered locations in which the Armenians are found to-day.  d. _The Tokharian_. This language, only recently discovered and identified as Indo-European, was spoken in the districts east of the Caspian Sea (modern Turkestan). While in some respects closely related to the three Asiatic branches of the Indo-European family already considered, in others it shows close relationship to the European members of the family. The literature of the Tokharian, so far as it has been brought to light, consists mainly of translations from the Sanskrit sacred writings, and dates from the seventh century of our era.  EUROPEAN MEMBERS OF THE INDO-EUROPEAN FAMILY.  e. _The Greek_. The Greeks had apparently long been settled in Greece and Asia Minor as far back as 1500 B.C. Probably they arrived in these districts much earlier. The earliest literary productions are the Iliad and the Odyssey of Homer, which very likely go back to the ninth century B.C. From the sixth century B.C. on, Greek literature is continuous. Modern Greek, when we consider its distance in time from antiquity, is remarkably similar to the classical Greek of the fourth and fifth centuries B.C.  f. _The Italic Group._ The Italic Group embraces the Umbrian, spoken in the northern part of the Italian peninsula (in ancient Umbria); the Latin, spoken in the central part (in Latium); the Oscan, spoken in the southern part (in Samnium, Campania, Lucania, etc.). Besides these, there were a number of minor dialects, such as the Marsian, Volscian, etc. Of all these (barring the Latin), there are no remains except a few scanty inscriptions. Latin literature begins shortly after 250 B.C. in the works of Livius Andronicus, Naevius, and Plautus, although a few brief inscriptions are found belonging to a much earlier period.  g. _The Celtic._ In the earliest historical times of which we have any record, the Celts occupied extensive portions of northern Italy, as well as certain areas in central Europe; but after the second century B.C., they are found only in Gaul and the British Isles. Among the chief languages belonging to the Celtic group are the Gallic, spoken in ancient Gaul; the Breton, still spoken in the modern French province of Brittany; the Irish, which is still extensively spoken in Ireland among the common people, the Welsh; and the Gaelic of the Scotch Highlanders.  h. _The Teutonic._ The Teutonic group is very extensive. Its earliest representative is the Gothic, preserved for us in the translation of the scriptures by the Gothic Bishop Ulfilas (about 375 A.D.). Other languages belonging to this group are the Old Norse, once spoken in Scandinavia, and from which are descended the modern Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish; German; Dutch; Anglo-Saxon, from which is descended the modern English.  i. _The Balto-Slavic._ The languages of this group belong to eastern Europe. The Baltic division of the group embraces the Lithuanian and Lettic, spoken to-day by the people living on the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea. The earliest literary productions of these languages date from the sixteenth century. The Slavic division comprises a large number of languages, the most important of which are the Russian, the Bulgarian, the Serbian, the Bohemian, the Polish. All of these were late in developing a literature, the earliest to do so being the Old Bulgarian, in which we find a translation of the Bible dating from the ninth century.  j. _The Albanian_, spoken in Albania and parts of Greece, Italy, and Sicily. This is most nearly related to the Balto-Slavic group, and is characterized by the very large proportion of words borrowed from Latin, Turkish, Greek, and Slavic. Its literature does not begin till the seventeenth century.  2. Home of the Indo-European Family.--Despite the many outward differences of the various languages of the foregoing groups, a careful examination of their structure and vocabulary demonstrates their intimate relationship and proves overwhelmingly their descent from a common parent. We must believe, therefore, that at one time there existed a homogeneous clan or tribe of people speaking a language from which all the above enumerated languages are descended. The precise location of the home of this ancient tribe cannot be determined. For a long time it was assumed that it was in central Asia north of the Himalaya Mountains, but this view has long been rejected as untenable. It arose from the exaggerated importance attached for a long while to Sanskrit. The great antiquity of the earliest literary remains of the Sanskrit (the Vedic Hymns) suggested that the inhabitants of India were geographically close to the original seat of the Indo-European Family. Hence the home was sought in the elevated plateau to the north. To-day it is thought that central or southeastern Europe is much more likely to have been the cradle of the Indo-European parent-speech, though anything like a logical demonstration of so difficult a problem can hardly be expected.  As to the size and extent of the original tribe whence the Indo-European languages have sprung, we can only speculate. It probably was not large, and very likely formed a compact racial and linguistic unit for centuries, possibly for thousands of years.  The time at which Indo-European unity ceased and the various individual languages began their separate existence, is likewise shrouded in obscurity. When we consider that the separate existence of the Sanskrit may antedate 2500 B.C., it may well be believed that people speaking the Indo-European parent-speech belonged to a period as far back as 5000 B.C., or possibly earlier.  3. Stages in the Development of the Latin Language.--The earliest remains of the Latin language are found in certain very archaic inscriptions. The oldest of these belong to the sixth and seventh centuries B.C. Roman literature does not begin till several centuries later, viz. shortly after the middle of the third century B.C. We may recognize the following clearly marked periods of the language and literature:  a. _The Preliterary Period_, from the earliest times down to 240 B.C., when Livius Andronicus brought out his first play. For this period our knowledge of Latin depends almost exclusively upon the scanty inscriptions that have survived from this remote time. Few of these are of any length.  b. _The Archaic Period_, from Livius Andronicus (240 B.C.) to Cicero (81 B.C.). Even in this age the language had already become highly developed as a medium of expression. In the hands of certain gifted writers it had even become a vehicle of power and beauty. In its simplicity, however, it naturally marks a contrast with the more finished diction of later days. To this period belong:    Livius Andronicus, about 275-204 B.C. (Translation of Homer's Odyssey;       Tragedies).   Plautus, about 250-184 B.C. (Comedies).   Naevius, about 270-199 B.C. (\"Punic War\"; Comedies).   Ennius, 239-169 B.C. (\"Annals\"; Tragedies).   Terence, about 190-159 B.C. (Comedies).   Lucilius, 180-103 B.C. (Satires).   Pacuvius, 220-about 130 B.C. (Tragedies).   Accius, 170-about 85 B.C. (Tragedies).  c. _The Golden Age_, from Cicero (81 B.C.) to the death of Augustus (14 A.D.). In this period the language, especially in the hands of Cicero, reaches a high degree of stylistic perfection. Its vocabulary, however, has not yet attained its greatest fullness and range. Traces of the diction of the Archaic Period are often noticed, especially in the poets, who naturally sought their effects by reverting to the speech of olden times. Literature reached its culmination in this epoch, especially in the great poets of the Augustan Age. The following writers belong here:    Lucretius, about 95-55 B.C. (Poem on Epicurean Philosophy).   Catullus, 87-about 54 B.C. (Poet).   Cicero, 106-43 B.C. (Orations; Rhetorical Works; Philosophical Works;       Letters).   Caesar, 102-44 B.C. (Commentaries on Gallic and Civil Wars),   Sallust, 86-36 B.C. (Historian).   Nepos, about 100-about 30 B.C. (Historian).   Virgil, 70-19 B.C. (\"Aeneid\"; \"Georgics\"; \"Bucolics\").   Horace, 65-8 B.C. (Odes; Satires, Epistles).   Tibullus, about 54-19 B.C. (Poet).   Propertius, about 50-about 15 B.C. (Poet).   Ovid, 43 B.C.-17 A.D. (\"Metamorphoses\" and other poems).   Livy. 59 B.C.-17 A.D. (Historian).  d. _The Silver Latinity_, from the death of Augustus (14 A.D.) to the death of Marcus Aurelius (180 A.D.), This period is marked by a certain reaction against the excessive precision of the previous age. It had become the practice to pay too much attention to standardized forms of expression, and to leave too little play to the individual writer. In the healthy reaction against this formalism, greater freedom of expression now manifests itself. We note also the introduction of idioms from the colloquial language, along with many poetical words and usages. The following authors deserve mention:    Phaedrus, flourished about 40 A.D. (Fables in Verse)   Velleius Paterculus, flourished"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15665"],["title","New Latin Grammar (#2)"],["body","30 A.D. (Historian).   Lucan, 39-65 A.D. (Poem on the Civil War).   Seneca, about 1-65 A.D. (Tragedies; Philosophical Works).   Pliny the Elder, 23-79 A.D. (\"Natural History\").   Pliny the Younger, 62-about 115 A.D. (\"Letters\").   Martial, about 45-about 104 A.D. (Epigrams).   Quintilian, about 35-about 100 A.D. (Treatise on Oratory and Education).   Tacitus, about 55-about 118 A.D. (Historian).   Juvenal, about 55-about 135 A.D. (Satirist).   Suetonius, about 73-about 118 A.D. (\"Lives of the Twelve Caesars\").   Minucius Felix, flourished about 160 A.D. (First Christian Apologist).   Apuleius, 125-about 200 A.D. (\"Metamorphoses,\" or \"Golden Ass\").  e. _The Archaizing Period._ This period is characterized by a conscious imitation of the Archaic Period of the second and first centuries B.C.; it overlaps the preceding period, and is of importance from a linguistic rather than from a literary point of view. Of writers who manifest the archaizing tendency most conspicuously may be mentioned Fronto, from whose hand we have a collection of letters addressed to the Emperors Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius; also Aulus Gellius, author of the \"Attic Nights.\" Both of these writers flourished in the second half of the second century A.D.  f. _The Period of the Decline_, from 180 to the close of literary activity in the sixth century A.D. This period is characterized by rapid and radical alterations in the language. The features of the conversational idiom of the lower strata of society invade the literature, while in the remote provinces, such as Gaul, Spain, Africa, the language suffers from the incorporation of local peculiarities. Representative writers of this period are:    Tertullian, about 160-about 240 A.D. (Christian Writer).   Cyprian, about 200-258 A.D. (Christian Writer).   Lactantius, flourished about 300 A.D. (Defense of Christianity).   Ausonius, about 310-about 395 A.D. (Poet).   Jerome, 340-420 A.D. (Translator of the Scriptures).   Ambrose, about 340-397 (Christian Father).   Augustine, 354-430 (Christian Father--\"City of God\").   Prudentius, flourished 400 A.D. (Christian Poet).   Claudian, flourished 400 A.D. (Poet).   Boëthius, about 480-524 A.D. (\"Consolation of Philosophy \").  4. Subsequent History of the Latin Language.--After the sixth century A.D. Latin divides into two entirely different streams. One of these is the literary language maintained in courts, in the Church, and among scholars. This was no longer the language of people in general, and as time went on, became more and more artificial. The other stream is the colloquial idiom of the common people, which developed ultimately in the provinces into the modern so-called Romance idioms. These are the Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Provençal (spoken in Provence, i.e. southeastern France), the Rhaeto-Romance (spoken in the Canton of the Grisons in Switzerland), and the Roumanian, spoken in modern Roumania and adjacent districts. All these Romance languages bear the same relation to the Latin as the different groups of the Indo-European family of languages bear to the parent speech.         *       *       *       *       *  PART I.         *       *       *       *       *  SOUNDS, ACCENT, QUANTITY.         *       *       *       *       *  THE ALPHABET.  1. The Latin Alphabet is the same as the English, except that the Latin has no w.  1. K occurs only in _Kalendae_ and a few other words; y and z were introduced from the Greek about 50 B.C., and occur only in foreign words--chiefly Greek.  2. With the Romans, who regularly employed only capitals, I served both as vowel and consonant; so also V. For us, however, it is more convenient to distinguish the vowel and consonant sounds, and to write i and u for the former, j and v for the latter. Yet some scholars prefer to employ i and u in the function of consonants as well as vowels.  CLASSIFICATION OF SOUNDS.  2. 1. The Vowels are a, e, i, o, u, y. The other letters are Consonants. The Diphthongs are ae, oe, ei, au, eu, ui.  2. Consonants are further subdivided into Mutes, Liquids, Nasals, and Spirants.  3. The Mutes are p, t, c, k, q; b, d, g; ph, th, ch. Of these,--    a) p, t, c, k, q are voiceless,[4] i.e. sounded _without_ voice or   vibration of the vocal cords.    b) b, d, g are voiced,[5] i.e. sounded _with_ vibration of the vocal   cords.    c) ph, th, ch are aspirates. These are confined almost exclusively to   words derived from the Greek, and were equivalent to p + h, t + h, c + h,   i.e. to the corresponding voiceless mutes with a following breath, as in   Eng. _loop-hole_, _hot-house_, _block-house_.  4. The Mutes admit of classification also as    Labials,                        p, b, ph.   Dentals (or Linguals),          t, d, th.   Gutturals (or Palatals),        c, k, q, g, ch.  5. The Liquids are l, r. These sounds were voiced.  6. The Nasals are m, n. These were voiced. Besides its ordinary sound, n, when followed by a guttural mute also had another sound,--that of ng in _sing_,--the so-called n _adulterīnum_; as,--    anceps, _double_, pronounced angceps.  7. The Spirants (sometimes called Fricatives) are f, s, h. These were voiceless.  8. The Semivowels are j and v. These were voiced.  9. Double Consonants are x and z. Of these, x was equivalent to cs, while the equivalence of z is uncertain. See § 3, 3.  10. The following table will indicate the relations of the consonant sounds:--                   VOICELESS.     VOICED.      ASPIRATES.                      p,            b,           ph,       (Labials).   Mutes,             t,            d,           th,       (Dentals).                   c, k, q,         g,           ch,       (Gutturals).   Liquids,                       l, r,   Nasals,                        m, n,                      f,                                   (Labial).   Spirants,          s,                                   (Dental).                      h,                                   (Guttural).   Semivowels,                    j, v.    a. The Double Consonants, x and z, being compound sounds, do not admit of   classification in the above table.  SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS.  3. The following pronunciation (often called Roman) is substantially that employed by the Romans at the height of their civilization; i.e., roughly, from 50 B.C. to 50 A.D.  1. Vowels.    ā as in _father_;          ă as in the first syllable _ahá_;   ē as in _they_;            ĕ as in _met_;   ī as in _machine_;         ĭ as in _pin_;   ō as in _note_;            ŏ as in _obey_, _melody_;   ū as in _rude_;            ŭ as in _put_;   y like French _u_, German   _ü_.  2. Diphthongs.    ae like _ai_ in            eu with its two elements, ĕ and ŭ,   _aisle_;                   pronounced in rapid succession;   oe like _oi_ in _oil_;     ui occurs almost exclusively in   ei as in _rein_;           _cui_ and _huic_. These words may   au like _ow_ in _how_;     be pronounced as  though written                              _kwee_ and _wheek_.  3. Consonants.    b, d, f, h, k, l, m, n, p, qu are pronounced as in English, except that   bs, bt are pronounced _ps_, _pt_.    c is always pronounced as _k_.    t is always a plain _t_, never with the sound of _sh_ as in Eng.   _oration_.    g always as in _get_; when ngu precedes a vowel, gu has the sound of   _gw_, as in anguis, languidus.    j has the sound of _y_ as in _yet_.    r was probably slightly trilled with the tip of the tongue.    s always voiceless as in _sin_; in suādeō, suāvis, suēscō, and in   compounds and derivatives of these words, su has the sound of _sw_.    v like _w_.    x always like _ks_; never like Eng. _gz_ or _z_.    z uncertain in sound; possibly like Eng. _zd_, possibly like _z_. The   latter sound is recommended.    The aspirates ph, ch, th were pronounced very nearly like our stressed   Eng. _p_, c, _t_--so nearly so, that, for practical purposes, the latter   sounds suffice.    Doubled letters, like ll, mm, tt, etc., should be so pronounced that both   members of the combination are distinctly articulated.  SYLLABLES.  4. There are as many syllables in a Latin word as there are separate vowels and diphthongs.  In the division of words into syllables,--  1. A single consonant is joined to the following vowel; as, vo-lat, ge-rit, pe-rit, a-dest.  2. Doubled consonants, like tt, ss, etc., are always separated; as, vit-ta, mis-sus.  3. Other combinations of two or more consonants are regularly separated, and the first consonant of the combination is joined with the preceding vowel; as, ma-gis-trī, dig-nus, mōn-strum, sis-te-re.  4. An exception to Rule 3 occurs when the two consonants consist of a mute followed by l or r (pl, cl, tl; pr, cr, tr, etc.). In such cases both consonants are regularly joined to the following vowel; as, a-grī, vo-lu-cris, pa-tris, mā-tris. Yet if the l or r introduces the second part of a compound, the two consonants are separated; as, ab-rumpō, ad-lātus.  5. The double consonant x is joined to the preceding vowel; as, ax-is, tēx-ī.  QUANTITY.  5. A. Quantity of Vowels.  A vowel is _long_ or _short_ according to the length of time required for its pronunciation. No absolute rule can be given for determining the quantity of Latin vowels. This knowledge must be gained, in large measure, by experience; but the following principles are of aid:--  1. A vowel is long,[6]--    a) before nf or ns; as, īnfāns, īnferior, cōnsūmō, cēnseō, īnsum.    b) when the result of contraction; as, nīlum for nihilum.  2. A vowel is short,--    a) before nt, nd; as, amant, amandus. A few exceptions occur in compounds   whose first member has a long vowel; as, nōndum (nōn dum).    b) before another vowel, or h; as, meus, trahō. Some exceptions occur,   chiefly in proper names derived from the Greek; as, Aenēās.  B. Quantity of Syllables.  Syllables are distinguished as _long_ or _short_ according to the length of time required for their pronunciation.  1. A syllable is long,[7]--    a) if it"]]]
