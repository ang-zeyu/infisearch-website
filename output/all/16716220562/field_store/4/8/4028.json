I, of course, have shot a great deal as a big game      hunter, but, thank God, I don't remember one wanton kill,      and I know I have not killed one per cent. of the beasts I      might have done. No one wants to....  The Hon. Theodore Roosevelt, ex-President of the United States, writes:       I desire to extend my most earnest good wishes and      congratulations to the Commission of Conservation of Canada.      Your address on the need of animal sanctuaries in Labrador      must appeal, it seems to me, to every civilized man. The      great naturalist, Alfred Russell Wallace, in his book, \"The      World of Life,\" recently published, says that all who      profess religion, or sincerely believe in the Deity, the      designer and maker of this world and of every living thing,      as well as all lovers of Nature, should treat the wanton and      brutal destruction of living things and of forests as among      the first of forbidden sins. In his own words, \"All the      works of Nature, animate or inanimate, should be invested      with a certain sanctity, to be used by us but not abused,      and never to be recklessly destroyed or defaced. To pollute      a spring or a river, to exterminate a bird or a beast,      should be treated as moral offences and as social crimes.      Never before has there been such widespread ravage of the      earth's surface by the destruction of vegetation, and with      it, animal life, and such wholesale defacement of the earth.      The nineteenth century saw the rise and development and      culmination of these crimes against God and man. Let us hope      that the twentieth century will see the rise of a truer      religion, a purer Christianity.\" I have condensed what Mr.      Wallace said because it is too long to quote in full. He      shows that this wanton and brutal defacement of Nature, this      annihilation of the natural resources that should be part of      the National capital of our children and children's      children, this destruction of so much that is beautiful and      grand, goes hand in hand with the sordid selfishness which      is responsible for so very much of the misery of our      civilization. The movement for the conservation of our      natural resources, for the protection of our forests and of      the wild life of the woods, the mountains and the coasts, is      essentially a democratic movement. Democracy, in its      essence, means that a few people shall not be allowed for      their own selfish gratification, to destroy what ought to      belong to the people as a whole. The men who destroy our      forests for their own immediate pecuniary benefit, the men      who make a lifeless desert of what were once coasts teeming      with a wonderfully varied bird life, these, whether rich or      poor, and their fellows in destruction of every type, are      robbing the whole people, are robbing the citizens of the      future of their natural rights. Over most of the United      States, over all of South Africa and large portions of      Canada, this destruction was permitted to go on to the      bitter end. It is late now, but it is not too late for us to      put a stop to the process elsewhere. What is being done in      Labrador is substantially what was done, and is still, in      places, being done in Florida. A resolute effort is now      being made by the Audubon Societies, and all kindred      organizations, to stop the waste in the United States. Great      good can be done by this effort, for there is still very      much left to save in the United States. But there is very      much more left to save in Canada. Canada has taken the lead      in many matters of far-reaching importance to the future      welfare of mankind, and has taught other nations much. She      can teach no more important lesson to other nations, and      incidentally, she can benefit herself in no more striking      way, than by resolutely setting to work to preserve her      forests, and the strange and beautiful wild creatures, both      beasts and birds, of her forests and her sea-coasts.      Labrador offers one of the best of all possible fields for      such work. The forests, the wild beasts and wild birds of      Labrador can be kept perpetually as one of the great assets      of Canada; or they can he destroyed in a spirit of brutal      and careless vandalism, with no permanent benefit to anyone,      and with the effect of ruining the country and preventing      its ever becoming what it otherwise would become. The      economic argument is by no means the only argument, and, in      my eyes, is hardly the most important argument for      preserving the forests and wild life of Labrador, as your      Commission desires to preserve them, but it is in itself so      important that, even though there were no other reason to be      adduced, it would amply warrant the taking of the action      you recommend. I extend you my warmest good wishes for the      success of your movement.  Mr. Ernest Thompson Seton writes:       ... your most interesting and convincing address on _Animal      Sanctuaries in Labrador_. You certainly have hit the nail on      the head. It is now demonstrated by experiments in many      parts of the world that the only sure way to preserve      indefinitely a supply of wild animals is by giving them      well-placed, well-selected sanctuaries, wherein at all      seasons they are safe. I am delighted to know that you are      taking up this important matter with such vigor.  _South Africa_. Major Hamilton, Superintendent, Transvaal Government Game Reserves, Koomatipoort, says:       I have been much interested in reading Col. Wood's address.      They seem to have the same difficulties to contend with      there as we have here, _i.e._, ignorance and apathy of the      public, and active opposition from those with axes to grind.  Major Hamilton encloses the _Regulations under Section_ 4 _of the Game Preservation Ordinance_, 1905, (C)--_Reserves_. By these it appears that \"owners of private land situate in a Reserve or persons having the permission in writing of such owners shall have free access to every part of such land.\" But routes of access in the Reserve generally are exactly defined and must be followed. Penalties up to Â£50 may be imposed for the infraction of any one of six different clauses. Major Hamilton also says:       The Game Sanctuaries of the Transvaal stretch along the      eastern border of the Province for a length of 250 miles      with an average breadth of 50 miles.       They are in charge of a Warden under whom are six Rangers.      Five of these Rangers are in charge of each of one of the      five areas into which the Reserves are divided, four for the      Sabi Reserve and one for the Singwitsi Reserve, and each has      at his disposal a force of 12 native rangers or police. The      sixth Ranger is specially employed in the capture of live      animals for zoological purposes, the destruction of vermin      and for any emergency duty which may arise. His headquarters      are, therefore, within easy reach of the Warden.       The Warden has, further, in the districts included in the      Game Reserve, the powers of a Resident Justice of the Peace,      a Sub Native Commissioner, and a Customs Officer, while the      Rangers, white and native, have the full powers and duties      of police. The area is therefore quite self-contained, and      at the Warden's headquarters, are police barracks, court      house and lock-up, and a post of the Transvaal police in      charge of a corporal is permanently stationed there. The      special by-laws which are enforced are set forth in the      attached slip. There are about 4,000 natives, all told,      resident within the area. Most of them have been admitted as      residents on condition of their giving assistance to the      staff, and hold their tenure conditionally on their      behaviour. This system has been found to work admirably,      for, while practically no harm is done by these residents,      very considerable assistance has been obtained from them in      detecting poachers.       All carnivorous mammals are treated as vermin and are      systematically destroyed.       No shooting or hunting of any kind is permitted in the      Reserve, and in fact members of the public except on special      permit are not allowed to carry firearms or to leave certain      main tracks.       The species of game mammals found are as follows: Elephant,      rhinoceros, hippopotamus, giraffe, buffalo, zebra, sable and      roan antelope, kudu, water buck, blue wilde-beest, impalla,      reed buck, bush-buck, steenbok, duiker, klipspringer,      mountain reed buck, red duiker.       Of game birds there are: five kinds of francolin, two kinds      of knorhaan, sand grouse, quail and crested paauw.       The most destructive of the carnivora are lions, leopards,      chitas, hunting dogs, caracals and servals.       Baboons, porcupines, &c., being destructive in various ways,      are considered to be vermin.       Vermin have perceptibly decreased during the last few years,      in spite of the fact that the game has increased at the rate      of fully 10 per cent, per annum.       About 1,500 head of vermin, on an average, are destroyed      annually. The figures for 1910 included 21 lions, 24      leopards, 31 wild dogs, &c., the balance being made up of      chetahs, caracals, servals, civets, genets, wild cats,      hyenas, jackals, otters, baboons, crocodiles, pythons and      birds of prey.       There were 133 prosecutions for infringement of the      regulations, all against natives.  Dr. Charles W. Townsend, Boston, Mass., an eminent ornithologist, says:       I have just read with much interest "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15134"],["title","Supplement to Animal Sanctuaries in Labrador (#5)"],["body","Address on _Animal      Sanctuaries in Labrador_, and wish to tell you how fully I      agree with you, not only as to the importance of stopping      the destruction in Labrador before it is too late, but also      in the value of animal sanctuaries in general and of      Labrador in particular. I sincerely hope you will succeed in      your good work.       In the _Birds of Labrador_, 1907, Boston Society of Natural      History, by Mr. Glover, Mr. Allen and myself, we called      especial attention to the great destruction of life that has      gone on and is still going on there, and we suggested the      protection of the eiders for their down, as is done in      Norway, instead of their extermination, the present course.  Commander W. Wakeham, of the Department of Marine, says:       No one can question the desirability of having certain areas      set apart, where wild animals may find asylum, and rest....       A few years ago, from some unusual cause, the woodland      caribou, in great numbers, visited that part of Labrador,      east of Forteau, and along down as far as St. Charles. A      large number were there killed by the white settlers--but      this was a solitary, and exceptional year. The Indians who      hunt in the interior of Labrador undoubtedly do kill a large      number of these caribou; but, when we consider the great      extent of country over which these deer migrate, compared      with the comparatively small number of Indians--and there is      a steadily decreasing number--I can hardly believe that      there is much fear of their ever exterminating these deer.      Then, could we possibly prevent these Indians from hunting      the deer wherever they meet them? I hardly think we could.      The barren-ground caribou are not hunted to any extent by      whites. During the month of August, the Eskimo of the Ungava      peninsula, as well as those in Baffin island, resort to      certain fords, or narrows where these caribou usually pass      at the beginning of the fall migration. They kill      considerable numbers--rather for the skins as clothing, than      for food. But the Eskimo are few in number, and I cannot      conceive that there is any fear of these caribou ever being      greatly reduced in number by these native hunters. Any one      who has ever met a herd of barren-ground caribou, and seen      the countless thousands of them, could hardly conceive of      their ever being exterminated. Nor would they be if we had      to deal only with the native hunters. But, with our      experience of what happened to the buffalo when the white      man took up the slaughter, we must take precaution in time.       Up to the present, very few white men have penetrated any      distance into the interior of the Labrador peninsula, and I      do not see that they are very likely to, in the near future.      But we never can tell. A few years ago we would have said      the same of the Yukon region, so that it would be a wise      precaution to have set apart a considerable section of the      Labrador, in the interior, as a sanctuary.... It would      perhaps be better to have two regions set apart, one near      the Saguenay country and another nearer the Atlantic coast.      We have, however, to consider the fact that sanctuaries      will be of no value unless they are well guarded.       In the case of the birds the conditions are bad; the      destruction on the Labrador is horrible to contemplate. The      outer islands were scoured by crews from foreign vessels,      and whole loads of eggs carried off. There has not been much      of this done in recent years. There can he no doubt that, if      certain of the larger and less inhabited islands were set      apart, and carefully protected, the birds would return to      them. I believe that owing to the constant way in which the      birds--eider ducks, certain of the divers, gulls, &c., were      disturbed, on their natural and original nesting places,      they have changed their habits; and, instead of nesting on      the islands and by the sea, they have moved to the shores of      the interior lakes. You see flocks of young birds in the      fall; they have come from the interior, as they were not      hatched out on the islands as they used to be.       The destruction of geese and curlew does not take place on      the Labrador. These birds are not disturbed on their nesting      grounds; but, to the south and west when they are passing to      their winter haunts. Geese are found feeding on the      hill-sides, on the most distant and northern islands--as far      north as any of our explorers have gone. The first birds      Sverdrup met as he was coming south, in the early spring,      were wild geese. These birds are not disturbed on their      breeding grounds. The Eskimo do not meddle with them. In the      same way caribou are found feeding about the shores of      Hudson bay and strait. Like the geese, they feed on berries      about the hill sides. I have shot them at the mouth of      Churchill river, and near cape Digges in August, when they      were very fat--so fat that it is said that, on falling on      hard ground, they would burst open; though this did not      actually happen in my case. I certainly think that it would      be a grand thing to have certain groups of islands--or even      certain sections of coast--set apart as bird sanctuaries.       Your paper deals entirely with conditions in Labrador. There      is, however, another part of the Gulf coast, where the need      of protection is much greater than on the Labrador. That is      the interior of the Gaspe peninsula. A certain region in the      interior has been set aside as a park, but it is quite      unprotected. Here, we have moose, woodland caribou and the      red deer, besides nearly all the fur-bearing animals that we      find on the Labrador. There is no game protection whatever.      Moose and caribou are killed mostly out of season--when they      are yarded, or when it is easy to run them down. In many      cases the meat is left in the woods, the hide only being      wanted. Lumbermen are penetrating up the rivers, further      into the interior--every lumber camp is a centre from which      the game laws are persistently violated.... the game, both      fur and feather, (particularly the ruffled grouse) is      rapidly disappearing before their pitiless onslaughts.      Lumber camps are opened much earlier in the season than they      used to be; so that the interior lakes and head waters of      the rivers are being cleaned out of fish taken while in the      act of spawning. All this may seem very strong language; but      it is really not exaggerated. It may help to show the need      of more and better conservation....  Mr. Alfred Russell Wallace, the founder and exponent of the science of zoo-geography, writes:       ... your address on \"Animal Sanctuaries\" in Labrador, which      I have read with the greatest interest and astonishment.      Such reckless destruction I should hardly have thought      possible.       There is a considerable public opinion now against the use      of feathers as _ornaments_[A] because it inevitably leads to      the extermination of some of the most beautiful of living      things; but I think the attempts to stop it by legal      enactments begin at the wrong end. They seek to punish the      actual collectors or importers of the plumes, who are really      the least guilty and the most difficult to get at. It is the      actual _wearers_ of such ornaments who should be subject to      fines or even imprisonment, because, without the _demand_      they make there would be no supply. They also are,      presumably, the most educated and should know better. If it      were known that any lady with a feather in her hat (or      elsewhere) would be taken before a magistrate and _fined_,      and, on a second offence, _imprisoned_, and if this were the      case in the chief civilized countries of Europe and America,      the whole trade would at once cease and the poor birds be      left in peace.       You have, however, treated the subject very carefully and      thoroughly, and I hope your views will be soon carried      out....       I am glad to hear that Mr. Roosevelt is a reader of the      \"World of Life.\" My own interest is more especially in the      preservation of adequate areas of the glorious tropical and      equatorial forests, with their teeming and marvellous forms      of life.  Numerous other letters from all parts of the world expressing appreciation of the _Address_ have been received, the correspondents expressing strong approval of the effort to establish Animal Sanctuaries in Labrador. The names of some of the correspondents are given herewith:  Sir Robert Baden-Powell, London; Prof. H.T. Barnes, Montreal; Julien Corbett, London; Rudyard Kipling; Lord Stamfordham, London; Sir James LeMoine, Quebec; J.M. Macoun, Ottawa; Henry F. Osborn, New York; Madison Grant, New York.  _Note._--As a postscript I might add that the owner of part of a very desirable little archipelago, not far from the Saguenay, has already offered to give the property outright if a suitable sanctuary can be made out of the whole. This is all the more encouraging because such a gift involves the refusal of an offer from a speculative purchaser. May others be moved to do the same!
