The clipper's picture went with the wreckage, when the room was strewn, and I expect in that house today there is a photograph of a steamer with two funnels.  Nothing conjures back that room so well as the recollection of a strange odour which fell from it when its door opened, as though something bodiless passed as we entered.  There was never anything in the room which alone could account for the smell, for it had in it something of the sofa, which was old and black, and of the lacquered tea-caddy, within the lid of which was the faint ghost of a principle indefinably ancient and rare; and there was in it, too, something of the shells.  But you could never find where the smell really came from. I have tried, and know.  A recollection of that strange dusky fragrance brings back the old room on a summer afternoon, so sombre that the mahogany sideboard had its own reddish light, so quiet that the clock could be heard ticking in the next room; time, you could hear, going leisurely.  There would be a long lath of sunlight, numberless atoms swimming in it, slanting from a corner of the window to brighten a patch of carpet.  Two flies would be hovering under the ceiling. Sometimes they would dart at a tangent to hover in another place.  I used to wonder what they lived on.  You felt secure there, knowing it was old, but seeing things did not alter, as though the world were established and content, desiring no new thing.  I did not know that the old house, even then, quiet and still as it seemed, was actually rocking on the flood of mutable affairs; that its navigator, sick with anxiety and bewilderment in guiding his home in the years he did not understand, which his experience had never charted, was sinking nerveless at his helm.  For he heard, when his children did not, the premonition of breakers in seas having no landmark that he knew; felt the trend and push of new and inimical forces, and currents that carried him helpless, whither he would not go, but must, heartbroken, into the uproar and welter of the modern.  I have been told that London east of the Tower has no history worth mentioning, and it is true that sixteenth-century prints show the town to finish just where the Dock of St. Katherine is now.  Beyond that, and only marshes show, with Stebonhithe Church and a few other signs to mark recognizable country.  On the south side the marshes were very extensive, stretching from the River inland for a considerable distance.  The north shore was fen also, but a little above the tides was a low eminence, a clay and gravel cliff, that sea-wall which now begins below the Albert Dock and continues round the East Anglian seaboard.  Once it serpentined as far as the upper Pool, disappearing as the wharves and docks were built to accommodate London's increasing commerce.  There is no doubt, then, that the Lower Thames parishes are really young; but, when we are reminded that they have no history worth mentioning, it may be understood that the historian is simply not interested enough to mention it.  So far as age goes my shipping parish cannot compare with a cathedral city; but antiquity is not the same as richness of experience.  One remembers the historic and venerable tortoise.  He is old enough, compared with us.  But he has had nothing so varied and lively as the least of us can show.  Most of his reputed three hundred years is sleep, no doubt, and the rest vegetables.  In the experience of Wapping, Poplar, Rotherhithe, Limehouse, and Deptford, when they really came to life, there was precious little sleep, and no vegetables worth mentioning.  They were quick and lusty.  There they stood, long knee-deep and busy among their fleets, sometimes rising to cheer when a greater adventure was sailing or returning, some expedition that was off to find further avenues through the Orient or the Americas, or else a broken craft bringing back tragedy from the Arctic; ship after ship; great captain after great captain.  No history worth mentioning!  There are Londoners who cannot taste the salt.  Yet, no doubt, it is difficult for younger London to get the ocean within its horizon.  The memory of the _Oberon_, that famous ship, is significant to me, for she has gone, with all her fleet, and some say she took Poplar's best with her.  Once we were a famous shipping parish.  Now we are but part of the East End of London.  The steamers have changed us.  The tides do not rise high enough today, and our shallow waters cannot make home for the new keels.  But to the old home now the last of the sailing fleet is loyal.  We have enough still to show what once was there; the soft gradations of a ship's entrance, rising into bows and bowsprit, like the form of a comber at its limit, just before it leaps forward in collapse.  The mounting spars, alive and braced.  The swoop and lift of the sheer, the rich and audacious colours, the strange flags and foreign names.  South Sea schooner, whaling barque from Hudson's Bay, the mahogany ship from Honduras, the fine ships and barques that still load for the antipodes and 'Frisco.  Every season they diminish, but some are still with us. At Tilbury, where the modern liners are, you get wall sides mounting like great hotels with tier on tier of decks, and funnels soaring high to dominate the day.  There the prospect of masts is a line of derrick poles.  But still in the upper docks is what will soon have gone for ever from London, a dark haze of spars and rigging, with sometimes a white sail floating in it like a cloud.  We had a Russian barquentine there yesterday.  I think a barquentine is the most beautiful of ships, the most aerial and graceful of rigs, the foremast with its transverse spars giving breadth and balance, and steadying the unhindered lift skywards of main and mizzen poles.  The model of this Russian ship was as memorable as a Greek statue.  It is a ship's sheer which gives loveliness to her model, like the waist of a lissom woman, finely poised, sure of herself, in profile.  She was so slight a body, so tall and slender, but standing alert and illustriously posed, there was implied in her slenderness a rare strength and swiftness.  And to her beauty of line there went a richness of colour which made our dull parish a notable place.  She was of wood, painted white.  Her masts were of pine, veined with amber.  Her white hull, with the drenchings of the seas, had become shot with ultramarine shadows, as though tinctured with the virtue of the ocean.  The verdigris of her sheathing was vivid as green light; and the languid dock water, the colour of jade, glinting round her hull, was lambent with hues not its own.  You could believe there was a soft radiation from that ship's sides which fired the water about her, but faded when far from her sides, a delicate and faery light which soon expired.  Such are our distinguished visitors in Dockland, though now they come to us with less frequency.  If the skipper of the _Oberon_ could now look down the Dock Road from the corner by North Street, what he would look for first would be, not, I am sure, what compelled the electric trams, but for the entrance of the East Dock and its familiar tangle of spars.  He would not find it.  The old dock is there, but a lagoon asleep, and but few vessels sleeping with it.  The quays are vacant, except for the discarded lumber of ships, sun-dried boats, rusted cables and anchors, and a pile of broken davits.  The older dock of the West India Merchants is almost the same.  Yet even I have seen the bowsprits and jib-booms of the Australian packets diminish down the quays of the East Dock as an arcade; and of that West Dock there is a boy who well remembers its quays buried under the largess of the tropics and the Spanish Main, where now, through the colonnades of its warehouse supports, the vistas are empty.  Once you had to squeeze sideways through the stacked merchandise.  There were huge hogsheads of sugar and hillocks of coconuts.  Molasses and honey escaped to spread a viscid carpet which held your feet.  The casual prodigality of it expanded the mind.  Certainly this earth must be a big and cheerful place if it could spread its treasures thus wide and deep in a public place under the sky.  It corrected the impression got from the retail shops for any penniless youngster, with that pungent odour of sugar crushed under foot, with its libations of syrup poured from the plenty of the sunny isles.  Today the quays are bare and deserted, and grass rims the stones of the footway, as verdure does the neglected stone covers in a churchyard.  In the dusk of a winter evening the high and silent warehouses which enclose the mirrors of water enclose too an accentuation of the dusk.  The water might be evaporating in shadows. The hulls of the few ships, moored beside the walls, become absorbed in the dark.  Night withdraws their substance.  What the solitary wayfarer sees then is the incorporeal presentment of ships.  Dockland expires. The living and sounding day is elsewhere, lighting the new things on which the young are working.  Here is the past, deep in the obscurity from which time has taken the sun, where only memory can go, and sees but the ineffaceable impression of what once was there.  There is a notable building in our Dock Road, the Board of Trade offices, retired a little way from the traffic behind a screen of plane trees.  Not much more than its parapet appears behind the foliage.  By those offices, on fine evenings, I find one of our ancients, Captain Tom Bowline.  Why he favours the road there I do not know.  It would be a reasonable reason, but occult.  The electric trams and motor buses annoy him.  And not one of the young stokers and deck-hands just ashore and paid off, or else waiting at a likely corner for news of a ship, could possibly know the skipper and his "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15167"],["title","London River (#6)"],["body","records.  They do not know that once, in that office, Tom was a famous and respected figure.  There he stands at times, outside the place which knew him well, but has forgotten him, wearing his immemorial reefer jacket, his notorious tall white hat and his humorous trousers--short, round, substantial columns--with a broad line of braid down each leg.  His face is weather-stained still, and though his hair is white, it has the form of its early black and abundant vitality.  As long ago as 1885 he landed from his last ship, and has been with us since, watching the landmarks go.  \"The sea,\" he said to me once, \"the sea has gone.  When I look down this road and see it so empty--(the simple truth is it was noisy with traffic)--I feel I've overstayed my time allowance.  My ships are firewood and wreckage, my owners are only funny portraits in offices that run ten-thousand-ton steamers, and the boys are bones. Poplar?  This isn't Poplar.  I feel like Robinson Crusoe--only I can't find a footprint in the place.\"  It is for the young to remember there is no decay, though change, sometimes called progress, resembles it, especially when your work is finished and you are only waiting and looking on.  When Captain Tom is in that mood we go to smoke a pipe at a dockhead.  It will be high tide if we are in luck, and the sun will be going down to give our River majesty, and a steamer will be backing into the stream, outward bound. The quiet of a fine evening for Tom, and the great business of ships and the sea for me.  We see the steamer's captain and its pilot leaning over the bridge, looking aft towards the River.  I think the size of their vessel is a little awful to Tom.  He never had to guide so many thousand tons of steel and cargo into a crowded waterway.  But those two young fellows above know nothing of the change; they came with it. They are under their spell, thinking their world, as once Tom did his, established and permanent.  They are keeping easy pace with the movement, and so do not know of it.  Tom, now at rest, sitting on a pierhead bollard, sees the world leaving him, going ahead past his cogitating tobacco smoke.  Let it go.  We, watching quietly from our place on the pier-head, are wiser than the moving world in one respect. We know it does not know whence it is moving, nor why.  Well, perhaps its presiding god, who is determined the world shall go round, would be foolish to tell us.  The sun has dropped behind the black serration of the western city. Now the River with all the lower world loses substance, becomes vaporous and unreal.  Moving so fast then?  But the definite sky remains, a hard dome of glowing saffron based on thin girders of iron clouds.  The heaven alone is trite and plain.  The wharves, the factories, the ships, the docks, all the material evidence of hope and industry, merge into a dim spectral show in which a few lights burn, fumbling with ineffectual beams in dissolution.  Out on the River a dark body moves past; it has bright eyes, and hoots dismally as it goes.  There is a hush, as though at sunset the world had really resolved, and had stopped moving.  But from the waiting steamer looming over us, a gigantic and portentous bulk, a thin wisp of steam hums from a pipe, and hangs across the vessel, a white wraith.  Yet the hum of the steam is too subdued a sound in the palpable and oppressive dusk to be significant.  Then a boatswain's pipe rends the heavy dark like the gleam of a sword, and a great voice, awed by nothing, roars from the steamer's bridge.  There is a sudden commotion, we hear the voice again, and answering cries, and by us, towards the black chasm of the River in which hover groups of moving planets, the mass of the steamer glides, its pale funnel mounting over us like a column.  Out she goes, turning broadside on, a shadow sprinkled with stars, then makes slow way down stream, a travelling constellation occulting one after another all the fixed lights.  Captain Tom knocks out his pipe on the heel of his boot, his eyes still on the lights of the steamer.  \"Well,\" says Tom, \"they can still do it. They don't want any help old Tom could give aboard her.  A good man there.  Where's she bound for, I wonder?\"  Now who could tell him that? What a question to ask me.  Did Tom ever know his real destination? Not he!  And have I not watched Dockland itself in movement under the sun, easily mobile, from my window in its midst?  Whither was it bound?  Why should the old master mariner expect the young to answer that?  He is a lucky navigator who always finds his sky quite clear, and can set his course by the signs of unclouded heavenly bodies, and so is sure of the port to which his steering will take him.     IV. The Heart's Desire.  If the evening was one of those which seem longer than usual but still have far to go, it was once a custom in Millwall to find a pair of boots of which it could be claimed that it was time they were mended, and to carry the artful parcel around to Mr. Pascoe.  His cobbler's shop was in a street that had the look of having retired from the hurry and press of London, aged, dispirited, and indifferent even to its defeat, and of waiting vacantly for what must come to elderly and shabby despondence.  Each grey house in the street was distinguished but by its number and the ornament which showed between the muslin curtains of its parlour window.  The home of the Jones's had a geranium, and so was different from one neighbour with a ship's model in gypsum, and from the other whose sign was a faded photograph askew in its frame.  On warm evenings some of the women would be sitting on their doorsteps, watching with dull faces their children at play, as if experience had told them more than they wanted to know, but that they had nothing to say about it.  Beyond this street there was emptiness. It ended, literally, on a blind wall.  It was easy for a wayfarer to feel in that street that its life was caught.  It was secluded from the main stream, and its children were a lively yet merely revolving eddy. They could not get out.  When I first visited Mr. Pascoe, as there was no window ornament to distinguish his place from the others, and his number was missing, I made a mistake, and went next door.  Through a hole drilled in that wrong door a length of cord was pendant, with a greasy knot at its end.  Underneath the knot was chalked \"Pull.\"  I pulled.  The door opened on a mass of enclosed night.  From the street it was hard to see what was there, so I went inside.  What was there might have been a cavern--narrow, obscure, and dangerous with dim obstructions.  Some of the shadows were darker than others, because the cave ended, far-off, on a port-light, a small square of day framed in black.  Empty space was luminous beyond that cave.  Becoming used to the gloom I saw chains and cordage hanging from the unseen roof.  What was faintly like the prow of a boat shaped near.  Then out from the lumber and suggestions of things a gnome approached me.  \"Y' want ole Pascoe?  Nex' dore, guv'nor!\"  At that moment, in the square of bright day at the end of the darkness, the apparition of a ship silently appeared, and was gone again before my surprise.  That open space beyond was London River.  Next door, in a small room to which day and night were the same, Mr. Pascoe was always to be found bending over his hobbing foot, under a tiny yellow fan of gaslight which could be heard making a tenuous shrilling whenever the bootmaker looked up, and ceased riveting.  When his head was bent over his task only the crown of a red and matured cricketing cap, which nodded in time to his hammer, was presented to you.  When he paused to speak, and glanced up, he showed a face that the gas jet, with the aid of many secluded years, had tinctured with its own artificial hue, a face puckered through a long frowning intent on old boots.  He wore an apron that had ragged gaps in it.  He was a frail and dingy little man, and might never have had a mother, but could have been born of that dusty workroom, to which he had been a faithful son all his life.  It was a murky interior shut in from the day, a litter of petty tools and nameless rubbish on a ruinous bench, a disorder of dilapidated boots, that mean gas jet, a smell of leather; and there old Pascoe's hammer defiantly and rapidly attacked its circumstances, driving home at times, and all unseen, more than those rivets.  If he rose to rake over his bench for material or a tool, he went spryly, aided by a stick, but at every step his body heeled over because one leg was shorter than the other.  Having found what he wanted he would wheel round, with a strange agility that was apparently a consequence of his deformity, continuing his discourse, and driving his points into the air with his hammer, and so hobble back, still talking; still talking through his funny cap, as his neighbours used to say of him.  At times he convoluted aerial designs and free ideas with his hammer, spending it aloft on matters superior to boots.  The boots were never noticed.  Pascoe could revivify his dust.  The glitter of his spectacles when he looked up might have been the sparkling of an ardent vitality suppressed in his little body.  The wall space of his room was stratified with shelves, where half-seen bottles and nondescript lumps were to be guessed at, like fossils embedded in shadow.  They had never been moved, and they never would be.  Hanging from a nail on one shelf was a framed lithograph of the ship _Euterpe_, off S. Catherine's Point, July 21, 1849.  On the shelf below the picture was a row of books.  I never saw Pascoe look at them, and they could have been like the bottles, retained by a careful man because of the notion that some day they would come in handy.  Once, when waiting for Pascoe, who was out getting a little beer, I glanced at the volumes, and supposed they bore some relation to the picture of the ship; perhaps once they had"]]]
