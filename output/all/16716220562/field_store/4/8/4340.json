Something's happened. Well, Diane, this has been a bad day for me, too.\"  Plainly I heard Sally's sigh, and the little pathetic sound brought me vividly out of my sordid business of suspicion and speculation. So she was sorry.  \"Bad for you, too?\" replied Diane in amused surprise. \"Oh, I see--I forgot. You and Russ had it out.\"  \"Out? We fought like the very old deuce. I'll never speak to him again.\"  \"So your little--affair with Russ is all over?\"  \"Yes.\" Here she sighed again.  \"Well, Sally, it began swiftly and it's just as well short,\" said Diane earnestly. \"We know nothing at all of Russ.\"  \"Diane, after to-day I respect him in--in spite of things--even though he seems no good. I--I cared a lot, too.\"  \"My dear, your loves are like the summer flowers. I thought maybe your flirting with Russ might amount to something. Yet he seems so different now from what he was at first. It's only occasionally I get the impression I had of him after that night he saved me from violence. He's strange. Perhaps it all comes of his infatuation for you. He is in love with you. I'm afraid of what may come of it.\"  \"Diane, he'll do something dreadful to George, mark my words,\" whispered Sally. \"He swore he would if George fooled around me any more.\"  \"Oh, dear. Sally, what can we do? These are wild men. George makes life miserable for me. And he teases you unmer...\"  \"I don't call it teasing. George wants to spoon,\" declared Sally emphatically. \"He'd run after any woman.\"  \"A fine compliment to me, Cousin Sally,\" laughed Diane.  \"I don't agree,\" replied Sally stubbornly. \"It's so. He's spoony. And when he's been drinking and tries to kiss me, I hate him.\"  \"Sally, you look as if you'd rather like Russ to do something dreadful to George,\" said Diane with a laugh that this time was only half mirth.  \"Half of me would and half of me would not,\" returned Sally. \"But all of me would if I weren't afraid of Russ. I've got a feeling--I don't know what--something will happen between George and Russ some day.\"  There were quick steps on the hall floor, steps I thought I recognized.  \"Hello, girls!\" sounded out Wright's voice, minus its usual gaiety. Then ensued a pause that made me bring to mind a picture of Wright's glum face.  \"George, what's the matter?\" asked Diane presently. \"I never saw papa as he is to-night, nor you so--so worried. Tell me, what has happened?\"  \"Well, Diane, we had a jar to-day,\" replied Wright, with a blunt, expressive laugh.  \"Jar?\" echoed both the girls curiously.  \"Jar? We had to submit to a damnable outrage,\" added Wright passionately, as if the sound of his voice augmented his feeling. \"Listen, girls. I'll tell you all about it.\"  He coughed, clearing his throat in a way that betrayed he had been drinking.  I sunk deeper in the shadow of my covert, and stiffening my muscles for a protracted spell of rigidity, prepared to listen with all acuteness and intensity.  Just one word from this Wright, inadvertently uttered in a moment of passion, might be the word Steele needed for his clue.  \"It happened at the town hall,\" began Wright rapidly. \"Your father and Judge Owens and I were there in consultation with three ranchers from out of town. First we were disturbed by gunshots from somewhere, but not close at hand. Then we heard the loud voices outside.  \"A crowd was coming down street. It stopped before the hall. Men came running in, yelling. We thought there was a fire. Then that Ranger, Steele, stalked in, dragging a fellow by the name of Snell. We couldn't tell what was wanted because of the uproar. Finally your father restored order.  \"Steele had arrested Snell for alleged assault on a restaurant keeper named Hoden. It developed that Hoden didn't accuse anybody, didn't know who attacked him. Snell, being obviously innocent, was discharged. Then this--this gun fighting Ranger pulled his guns on the court and halted the proceedings.\"  When Wright paused I plainly heard his intake of breath. Far indeed was he from calm.  \"Steele held everybody in that hall in fear of death, and he began shouting his insults. Law was a farce in Linrock. The court was a farce. There was no law. Your father's office as mayor should be impeached. He made arrests only for petty offenses. He was afraid of the rustlers, highwaymen, murderers. He was afraid or--he just let them alone. He used his office to cheat ranchers and cattlemen in law-suits.  \"All of this Steele yelled for everyone to hear. A damnable outrage! Your father, Diane, insulted in his own court by a rowdy Ranger! Not only insulted, but threatened with death--two big guns thrust almost in his face!\"  \"Oh! How horrible!\" cried Diane, in mingled distress and anger.  \"Steele's a Ranger. The Ranger Service wants to rule western Texas,\" went on Wright. \"These Rangers are all a low set, many of them worse than the outlaws they hunt. Some of them were outlaws and gun fighters before they became Rangers.  \"This Steele is one of the worst of the lot. He's keen, intelligent, smooth, and that makes him more to be feared. For he is to be feared. He wanted to kill. He meant to kill. If your father had made the least move Steele would have shot him. He's a cold-nerved devil--the born gunman. My God, any instant I expected to see your father fall dead at my feet!\"  \"Oh, George! The--the unspeakable ruffian!\" cried Diane, passionately.  \"You see, Diane, this fellow Steele has failed here in Linrock. He's been here weeks and done nothing. He must have got desperate. He's infamous and he loves his name. He seeks notoriety. He made that play with Snell just for a chance to rant against your father. He tried to inflame all Linrock against him. That about law-suits was the worst! Damn him! He'll make us enemies.\"  \"What do you care for the insinuations of such a man?\" said Diane Sampson, her voice now deep and rich with feeling. \"After a moment's thought no one will be influenced by them. Do not worry, George, tell papa not to worry. Surely after all these years he can't be injured in reputation by--by an adventurer.\"  \"Yes, he can be injured,\" replied George quickly. \"The frontier is a queer place. There are many bitter men here, men who have failed at ranching. And your father has been wonderfully successful. Steele has dropped some poison, and it'll spread.\"  Then followed a silence, during which, evidently, the worried Wright bestrode the floor.  \"Cousin George, what became of Steele and his prisoner?\" suddenly asked Sally.  How like her it was, with her inquisitive bent of mind and shifting points of view, to ask a question the answering of which would be gall and wormwood to Wright!  It amused while it thrilled me. Sally might be a flirt, but she was no fool.  \"What became of them? Ha! Steele bluffed the whole town--at least all of it who had heard the mayor's order to discharge Snell,\" growled Wright. \"He took Snell--rode off for Del Rio to jail him.\"  \"George!\" exclaimed Diane. \"Then, after all, this Ranger was able to arrest Snell, the innocent man father discharged, and take him to jail?\"  \"Exactly. That's the toughest part....\" Wright ended abruptly, and then broke out fiercely: \"But, by God, he'll never come back!\"  Wright's slow pacing quickened and he strode from the parlor, leaving behind him a silence eloquent of the effect of his sinister prediction.  \"Sally, what did he mean?\" asked Diane in a low voice.  \"Steele will be killed,\" replied Sally, just as low-voiced.  \"Killed! That magnificent fellow! Ah, I forgot. Sally, my wits are sadly mixed. I ought to be glad if somebody kills my father's defamer. But, oh, I can't be!  \"This bloody frontier makes me sick. Papa doesn't want me to stay for good. And no wonder. Shall I go back? I hate to show a white feather.  \"Do you know, Sally, I was--a little taken with this Texas Ranger. Miserably, I confess. He seemed so like in spirit to the grand stature of him. How can so splendid a man be so bloody, base at heart? It's hideous. How little we know of men! I had my dream about Vaughn Steele. I confess because it shames me--because I hate myself!\"  Next morning I awakened with a feeling that I was more like my old self. In the experience of activity of body and mind, with a prospect that this was merely the forerunner of great events, I came round to my own again.  Sally was not forgotten; she had just become a sorrow. So perhaps my downfall as a lover was a precursor of better results as an officer.  I held in abeyance my last conclusion regarding Sampson and Wright, and only awaited Steele's return to have fixed in mind what these men were.  Wright's remark about Steele not returning did not worry me. I had heard many such dark sayings in reference to Rangers.  Rangers had a trick of coming back. I did not see any man or men on the present horizon of Linrock equal to the killing of Steele.  As Miss Sampson and Sally had no inclination to ride, I had even more freedom. I went down to the town and burst, cheerily whistling, into Jim Hoden's place.  Jim always made me welcome there, as much for my society as for the money I spent, and I never neglected being free with both. I bought a handful of cigars and shoved some of them in his pocket.  \"How's tricks, Jim?\" I asked cheerily.  \"Reckon I'm feelin' as well as could be expected,\" replied Jim. His head was circled by a bandage that did not conceal the lump where he had been struck. Jim looked a little pale, but he was bright enough.  \"That was a hell of a biff Snell gave you, the skunk,\" I remarked with the same cheery assurance.  \"Russ, I ain't accusin' Snell,\" remonstrated Jim with eyes that made me thoughtful.  \"Sure, I know you're too good a sport to send a fellow up. But Snell deserved what he got. I saw his face when he made his talk to Sampson's court. Snell lied. And I'll tell you what, Jim, if it'd been me instead of that Ranger, Bud Snell would have got settled.\"  Jim appeared to be agitated by my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15580"],["title","The Rustlers of Pecos County (#8)"],["body","intimation of friendship.  \"Jim, that's between ourselves,\" I went on. \"I'm no fool. And much as I blab when I'm hunky, it's all air. Maybe you've noticed that about me. In some parts of Texas it's policy to be close-mouthed. Policy and healthy. Between ourselves, as friends, I want you to know I lean some on Steele's side of the fence.\"  As I lighted a cigar I saw, out of the corner of my eye, how Hoden gave a quick start. I expected some kind of a startling idea to flash into his mind.  Presently I turned and frankly met his gaze. I had startled him out of his habitual set taciturnity, but even as I looked the light that might have been amaze and joy faded out of his face, leaving it the same old mask.  Still I had seen enough. Like a bloodhound, I had a scent. \"Thet's funny, Russ, seein' as you drift with the gang Steele's bound to fight,\" remarked Hoden.  \"Sure. I'm a sport. If I can't gamble with gentlemen I'll gamble with rustlers.\"  Again he gave a slight start, and this time he hid his eyes.  \"Wal, Russ, I've heard you was slick,\" he said.  \"You tumble, Jim. I'm a little better on the draw.\"  \"On the draw? With cards, an' gun, too, eh?\"  \"Now, Jim, that last follows natural. I haven't had much chance to show how good I am on the draw with a gun. But that'll come soon.\"  \"Reckon thet talk's a little air,\" said Hoden with his dry laugh. \"Same as you leanin' a little on the Ranger's side of the fence.\"  \"But, Jim, wasn't he game? What'd you think of that stand? Bluffed the whole gang! The way he called Sampson--why, it was great! The justice of that call doesn't bother me. It was Steele's nerve that got me. That'd warm any man's blood.\"  There was a little red in Hoden's pale cheeks and I saw him swallow hard. I had struck deep again.  \"Say, don't you work for Sampson?\" he queried.  \"Me? I _guess_ not. I'm Miss Sampson's man. He and Wright have tried to fire me many a time.\"  \"Thet so?\" he said curiously. \"What for?\"  \"Too many silver trimmings on me, Jim. And I pack my gun low down.\"  \"Wal, them two don't go much together out here,\" replied Hoden. \"But I ain't seen thet anyone has shot off the trimmin's.\"  \"Maybe it'll commence, Jim, as soon as I stop buying drinks. Talking about work--who'd you say Snell worked for?\"  \"I didn't say.\"  \"Well, say so now, can't you? Jim, you're powerful peevish to-day. It's the bump on your head. Who does Snell work for?\"  \"When he works at all, which sure ain't often, he rides for Sampson.\"  \"Humph! Seems to me, Jim, that Sampson's the whole circus round Linrock. I was some sore the other day to find I was losing good money at Sampson's faro game. Sure if I'd won I wouldn't have been sorry, eh? But I was surprised to hear some scully say Sampson owned the Hope So dive.\"  \"I've heard he owned considerable property hereabouts,\" replied Jim constrainedly.  \"Humph again! Why, Jim, you _know_ it, only like every other scully you meet in this town, you're afraid to open your mug about Sampson. Get me straight, Jim Hoden. I don't care a damn for Colonel Mayor Sampson. And for cause I'd throw a gun on him just as quick as on any rustler in Pecos.\"  \"Talk's cheap, my boy,\" replied Hoden, making light of my bluster, but the red was deep in his face.  \"Sure, I know that,\" I said, calming down. \"My temper gets up, Jim. Then it's not well known that Sampson owns the Hope So?\"  \"Reckon it's known in Pecos, all right. But Sampson's name isn't connected with the Hope So. Blandy runs the place.\"  \"That Blandy--I've got no use for him. His faro game's crooked, or I'm locoed bronc. Not that we don't have lots of crooked faro dealers. A fellow can stand for them. But Blandy's mean, back handed, never looks you in the eyes. That Hope So place ought to be run by a good fellow like you, Hoden.\"  \"Thanks, Russ,\" replied he, and I imagined his voice a little husky. \"Didn't you ever hear _I_ used to run it?\"  \"No. Did you?\" I said quickly.  \"I reckon. I built the place, made additions twice, owned it for eleven years.\"  \"Well, I'll be doggoned!\"  It was indeed my turn to be surprised, and with the surprise came glimmering.  \"I'm sorry you're not there now, Jim. Did you sell out?\"  \"No. Just lost the place.\"  Hoden was bursting for relief now--to talk--to tell. Sympathy had made him soft. I did not need to ask another question.  \"It was two years ago--two years last March,\" he went on. \"I was in a big cattle deal with Sampson. We got the stock, an' my share, eighteen hundred head, was rustled off. I owed Sampson. He pressed me. It come to a lawsuit, an' I--was ruined.\"  It hurt me to look at Hoden. He was white, and tears rolled down his cheeks.  I saw the bitterness, the defeat, the agony of the man. He had failed to meet his obligation; nevertheless he had been swindled.  All that he suppressed, all that would have been passion had the man's spirit not been broken, lay bare for me to see. I had now the secret of his bitterness.  But the reason he did not openly accuse Sampson, the secret of his reticence and fear--these I thought best to try to learn at some later time, after I had consulted with Steele.  \"Hard luck! Jim, it certainly was tough,\" I said. \"But you're a good loser. And the wheel turns!  \"Now, Jim, here's what I come particular to see you for. I need your advice. I've got a little money. Between you and me, as friends, I've been adding some to that roll all the time. But before I lose it I want to invest some. Buy some stock or buy an interest in some rancher's herd.  \"What I want you to steer me on is a good, square rancher. Or maybe a couple of ranchers if there happen to be two honest ones in Pecos. Eh? No deals with ranchers who ride in the dark with rustlers! I've a hunch Linrock's full of them.  \"Now, Jim, you've been here for years. So you must know a couple of men above suspicion.\"  \"Thank God I do, Russ,\" he replied feelingly. \"Frank Morton an' Si Zimmer, my friends an' neighbors all my prosperous days. An' friends still. You can gamble on Frank and Si. But Russ, if you want advice from me, don't invest money in stock now.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Because any new feller buyin' stock in Pecos these days will be rustled quicker'n he can say Jack Robinson. The pioneers, the new cattlemen--these are easy pickin'. But the new fellers have to learn the ropes. They don't know anythin' or anybody. An' the old ranchers are wise an' sore. They'd fight if they....\"  \"What?\" I put in as he paused. \"If they knew who was rustling the stock?\"  \"Nope.\"  \"If they had the nerve?\"  \"Not thet so much.\"  \"What then? What'd make them fight?\"  \"A leader!\"  I went out of Hoden's with that word ringing in my ears. A leader! In my mind's eye I saw a horde of dark faced, dusty-booted cattlemen riding grim and armed behind Vaughn Steele.  More thoughtful than usual, I walked on, passing some of my old haunts, and was about to turn in front of a feed and grain store when a hearty slap on my back disturbed my reflection.  \"Howdy thar, cowboy,\" boomed a big voice.  It was Morton, the rancher whom Jim had mentioned, and whose acquaintance I had made. He was a man of great bulk, with a ruddy, merry face.  \"Hello, Morton. Let's have a drink,\" I replied.  \"Gotta rustle home,\" he said. \"Young feller, I've a ranch to work.\"  \"Sell it to me, Morton.\"  He laughed and said he wished he could. His buckboard stood at the rail, the horses stamping impatiently.  \"Cards must be runnin' lucky,\" he went on, with another hearty laugh.  \"Can't kick on the luck. But I'm afraid it will change. Morton, my friend Hoden gave me a hunch you'd be a good man to tie to. Now, I've a little money, and before I lose it I'd like to invest it in stock.\"  He smiled broadly, but for all his doubt of me he took definite interest.  \"I'm not drunk, and I'm on the square,\" I said bluntly. \"You've taken me for a no-good cow puncher without any brains. Wake up, Morton. If you never size up your neighbors any better than you have me--well, you won't get any richer.\"  It was sheer enjoyment for me to make my remarks to these men, pregnant with meaning. Morton showed his pleasure, his interest, but his faith held aloof.  \"I've got some money. I had some. Then the cards have run lucky. Will you let me in on some kind of deal? Will you start me up as a stockman, with a little herd all my own?\"  \"Russ, this's durn strange, comin' from Sampson's cowboy,\" he said.  \"I'm not in his outfit. My job's with Miss Sampson. She's fine, but the old man? Nit! He's been after me for weeks. I won't last long. That's one reason why I want to start up for myself.\"  \"Hoden sent you to me, did he? Poor ol' Jim. Wal, Russ, to come out flat-footed, you'd be foolish to buy cattle now. I don't want to take your money an' see you lose out. Better go back across the Pecos where the rustlers ain't so strong. I haven't had more'n twenty-five-hundred head of stock for ten years. The rustlers let me hang on to a breedin' herd. Kind of them, ain't it?\"  \"Sort of kind. All I hear is rustlers.\" I replied with impatience. \"You see, I haven't ever lived long in a rustler-run county. Who heads the gang anyway?\"  Frank Morton looked at me with a curiously-amused smile.  \"I hear lots about Jack Blome and Snecker. Everybody calls them out and out bad. Do they head this mysterious gang?\"  \"Russ, I opine Blome an' Snecker parade themselves off boss rustlers same as gun throwers. But thet's the love such men have for bein' thought hell. That's brains headin' the rustler gang hereabouts.\"  \"Maybe Blome and Snecker are blinds. Savvy what I mean, Morton? Maybe there's more in the parade than just the fame of it.\"  Morton snapped his big jaw as if to shut in impulsive words.  \"Look here, Morton. I'm not so young in years even if I am young west of the Pecos. I can figure ahead. It stands to reason, no matter how damn strong these rustlers are, how hidden their work, however involved with supposedly honest men--they can't last.\"  \"They come with the pioneers an' they'll last as long as thar's a"]]]
