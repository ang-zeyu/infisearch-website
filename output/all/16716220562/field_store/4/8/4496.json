The Kahal of Vilna, therefore, implored the Council of State \"to turn its attention to this unfortunate and maligned people\" and to stop all further persecutions.  A more emphatic note of protest is sounded in the memorandum of Feigin. By a string of references to the latest Government measures he demonstrates the fact that \"the Jewish people is hunted down, not because of its moral qualities but because of its faith.\"    The Jews, faced by the new statute, have lost all hope for a better lot,   inasmuch as the Government has embarked upon this measure without having   solicited the explanations or justifications of this people, whereas,   according to common legal procedure, even an individual may not be   condemned without having been called upon to justify himself.  The rebuke had no effect. The Government preferred to render its verdict _in absentia_, without listening to counsel for the defence and without any safeguards of fair play. In line with this attitude, it also denied the petition of the Vilna Kahal to be allowed \"to send at least four deputies to the capital as spokesmen of the entire Jewish people for the purpose of submitting to the Government their explanations and propositions concerning the reorganization of the Jews, after having been presented with a draft of the statute.\" The final verdict was pronounced in the spring of 1835, and in April the new \"Statute concerning the Jews\" received the signature of the Tzar.  This \"Charter of Disabilities,\" which was destined to operate for many decades, represents a combination of the Russian \"ground laws\" concerning the Jews and the restrictive by-laws issued after 1804. The Pale of Settlement was now accurately defined: it consisted of Lithuania [1] and the South-western provinces, [2] without any territorial restrictions, White Russia [3] minus the Villages, Little Russia [4] minus the crown hamlets, New Russia [5] minus Nicholayev and Sevastopol, the government of Kiev minus the city of Kiev, the Baltic provinces for the old settlers only, while the rural settlements on the entire fifty-verst zone along the Western frontier were to be closed to newcomers. As for the interior provinces, only temporary \"furloughs\" (limited to six weeks and to be certified by gubernatorial passports) were to be granted for the execution of judicial and commercial affairs, with the proviso that the travellers should wear Russian instead of Jewish dress. The merchants affiliated with the first and second guilds were allowed, in addition, to visit the two capitals, [6] the sea-ports, as well as the fairs of Nizhni-Novgorod, Kharkov, and other big fairs for wholesale buying or selling. [7]  [Footnote 1: The present governments of Kovno, Vilna, Grodno, and Minsk.]  [Footnote 2: The governments of Volhynia and Podolia.]  [Footnote 3: The governments of Vitebsk and Moghilev.]  [Footnote 4: The governments of Chernigov and Poltava.]  [Footnote 5: The governments of Kherson, Yekaterinoslav, Tavrida, and Bessarabia.]  [Footnote 6: St. Petersburg and Moscow.]  [Footnote 7: The time-limit was six months for the merchants of the first guild and three months for those of the second.]  The Jews were further forbidden to employ Christian domestics for permanent employment. They could hire Christians for occasional services only, on condition that the latter live in separate quarters. Marriages at an earlier age than eighteen for the bridegroom and sixteen for the bride were forbidden under the pain of imprisonment--a prohibition which the defective registration of births and marriages then in vogue made it easy to evade. The language to be employed by the Jews in their public documents was to be Russian or any other local dialect, but \"under no circumstances the Hebrew language.\"  The function of the Kahal, according to the Statute, is to see to it that the \"instructions of the authorities\" are carried out precisely and that the state taxes and communal assessments are \"correctly remitted.\" The Kahal elders are to be elected by the community every three years from among persons who can read and write Russian, subject to their being ratified by the gubernatorial administration. At the same time the Jews are entitled to participation in the municipal elections; those who can read and write Russian are eligible as members of the town councils and magistracies--the supplementary law of 1836 fixed the rate at one-third, [1] excepting the city of Vilna where the Jews were entirely excluded from municipal self-government.  [Footnote 1: Compare Vol. I, p. 368.]  Synagogues may not be built in the vicinity of churches. The Russian schools of all grades are to be open to Jewish children, who \"are not compelled to change their religion\" (Clause 106)--a welcome provision in view of the compulsory methods which had then become habitual. The coercive baptism of Jewish children was provided for in a separate enactment, the Statute on Conscription, which is declared \"to remain in force.\" In this way the Statute of 1835 reduces itself to a codification of the whole mass of the preceding anti-Jewish legislation. Its only positive feature was that it put a stop to the expulsion from the villages which had ruined the Jewish population during the years 1804-1830.   6. THE RUSSIAN CENSORSHIP AND CONVERSIONIST ENDEAVORS  With all its discriminations, the promulgation of this general statute was far from checking the feverish activity of the Government. With indefatigable zeal, its hands went on turning the legislative wheel and squeezing ever tighter the already unbearable vise of Jewish life. The slightest attempt to escape from its pressure was punished ruthlessly. In 1838 the police of St. Petersburg discovered a group of Jews in the capital \"with expired passports,\" these Jews having extended their stay there a little beyond the term fixed for Jewish travellers, and the Tzar curtly decreed: \"to be sent to serve in the penal companies of Kronstadt.\" [1] In 1840 heavy fines were imposed upon the landed proprietors in the Great Russian governments for \"keeping over\" Jews on their estates.  [Footnote 1: A fortress in the vicinity of St Petersburg.]  Considerable attention was bestowed by the Government on placing the spiritual life of the Jews under police supervision. In 1836 a censorship campaign was launched against Hebrew literature. Hebrew books, which were then almost exclusively of a religious nature, such as prayer-books, Bible and Talmud editions, rabbinic, cabalistic, and hasidic writings, were then issuing from the printing presses of Vilna, Slavuta, [1] and other places, and were subject to a rigorous censorship exercised by Christians or by Jewish converts. Practically every Jewish home-library consisted of religious works of this type. The suspicions of the Government were aroused by certain Jewish converts who had insinuated that the foreign editions of these works and those that had appeared in Russia itself prior to the establishment of a censorship were of an \"injurious\" character. As a result, all Jewish home-libraries were subjected to a search. Orders were given to deliver into the hands of the local police, in the course of that year, all foreign Hebrew prints as well as the uncensored editions, published at any previous time in Russia, and to entrust their revision to \"dependable\" rabbis. These rabbis were instructed to put their stamp on the books approved by them and return the books not approved by them to the police for transmission to the Ministry of the Interior. The regulation involved the entire ancient Hebrew literature printed during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, prior to the establishment of the Russian censorship. In order to \"facilitate the supervision\" over new publications or reprints from older editions, all Jewish printing presses which existed at that time in various cities and towns were ordered closed, and only those of Vilna and Kiev, [2] to which special censors were attached, were allowed to remain.  [Footnote 1: A town in Volhynia.]  [Footnote 2: The printing-press of Kiev was subsequently transferred to Zhitomir.]  As the Hebrew authors of antiquity or the Middle Ages did not fully anticipate the requirements of the Russian censors, many classic works were found to contain passages which were thought to be \"at variance with imperial enactments.\" By the ukase of 1836 all books of this kind, circulating in tens of thousands of copies, had to be transported to St. Petersburg under a police escort to await their final verdict. The procedure, however, proved too cumbersome, and, in 1837, the emperor, complying with the petitions of the governors, was graciously pleased to command that all these books be \"delivered to the flames on the spot.\" This _auto-da-fé_ was to be witnessed by a member of the gubernatorial administration and a special \"dependable\" official dispatched by the governor for the sole purpose of making a report to the central Government on every literary conflagration of this kind and forwarding to the Ministry of the Interior one copy of each \"annihilated\" book.  But even this was not enough to satisfy the lust of the Russian censorship. It was now suspected that even the \"dependable\" rabbis might pass many a book as \"harmless,\" though its contents were subversive of the public weal. As a result, a new ukase was issued in 1841, placing the rabbinical censors themselves under Government control. All uncensored books, including those already passed as \"harmless,\" were ordered to be taken away from the private libraries and forwarded to the censorship committees in Vilna and Kiev. The latter were instructed to attach their seals to the approved books and \"deliver to the flames\" the books condemned by them. Endless wagonloads of these confiscated books could be seen moving towards Vilna and Kiev, and for many years afterwards the literature of the \"People of the Book,\" covering a period of three"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15729"],["title","History of the Jews in Russia and Poland, Volume 2 [of 3] (#7)"],["body",", was still languishing in the gaol of censorship, waiting to be saved from or to be sentenced to a fiery death by a Russian official.  It is almost unnecessary to add that the primitive method of solving the Jewish problem by means of conversion, was still the guiding principle of the Government. The Russian legislation of that period teems with regulations concerning apostasy. The surrender of the Synagogue to the Church seemed merely a question of time. In reality, however, the Government itself believed but half-heartedly in the sincerity of the converted Jews. In 1827 the Tzar put down in his own handwriting the following resolution: \"It is to be strictly observed that the baptismal ceremony shall take place unconditionally on a Sunday, and with all possible publicity, so as to remove all suspicion of a pretended adoption of Christianity.\" Subsequently, this watchfulness had to be relaxed in the case of those \"who avoid publicity in adopting Christianity,\" more especially in the case of the cantonists, \"who have declared their willingness to embrace the orthodox faith\"--under the effect, we may add, of the tortures in the barracks. Sincerity under these circumstances was out of the question, and, in 1831, the battalion chaplains were authorized to baptize these helpless creatures, even \"without applying for permission to the ecclesiastical authorities.\"  The barrack missionaries were frequently successful among these unfortunate military prisoners. In the imperial rescripts of that period the characteristic expression \"privates from among the Jews _remaining in the above faith_\" figures as a standing designation for that group of refractory and incorrigible soldiers who disturbed the officially pre-established harmony of epidemic conversions by remaining loyal to Judaism. But among the \"civilian\" Jews, who had not been detached from their Jewish environment, apostasy was extraordinarily rare, and law after law was promulgated in vain, offering privileges to converts or leniency to criminals who were ready to embrace the orthodox creed. [1]  [Footnote 1: Under Clause 157 of the Russian Penal Code of 1845, the penalty of the law was softened, not only in degree but also in kind, for those criminals who had embraced the Greek-Orthodox faith during the investigation or trial.]     CHAPTER XIV   COMPULSORY ENLIGHTENMENT AND INCREASED OPPRESSION  1. ENLIGHTENMENT AS A MEANS OF ASSIMILATION  There was a brief moment of respite when, in the phrase of the Russian poet, \"the fighter's hand was tired of killing.\" The Russian Government suddenly felt the need of passing over from the medieval forms of patronage to more enlightened and perfected methods. Among the leading statesmen of Russia were men, such as the Minister of Public Instruction, Sergius Uvarov, who were well acquainted with Western European ways and fully aware of the fact that the reactionary governments of Austria and Prussia had invented several contrivances for handling the Jewish problem which might be usefully applied in their own country. Though anxious to avoid all contact with the \"rotten West,\" and being in constant fear of European political movements, the Russian Government was nevertheless ready to seize upon the relics of \"enlightened absolutism\" which were still stalking about, particularly in Austria, in the early decades of the nineteenth century. As far as Prussia was concerned, the abundance of assimilated and converted Jews in that country and their attempts at religious reform, which to a missionary's imagination were identical with a change of front in favor of Christianity, had a fascination of its own for the Russian dignitaries. No wonder then that the Government yielded to the temptation to use some of the contrivances of Western European reaction, while holding in reserve the police knout of genuine Russian manufacture.  In 1840 the Council of State was again busy discussing the Jewish question, this time from a theoretic point of view. The reports of the provincial administrators, in particular that of Bibikov, governor-general of Kiev, dwelled on the fact that even the \"Statute\" of 1835 had not succeeded in \"correcting\" the Jews. The root of the evil lay rather in their \"religious fanaticism and separatism,\" which could only be removed by changing their inner life. The Ministers of Public Instruction and of the Interior, Uvarov and Stroganov, took occasion to expound the principles of their new system of correction before the Council of State. The discussions culminated in a remarkable memorandum submitted by the Council to Nicholas I.  In this document the Government confesses its impotence in grappling with the \"defects\" of the Jewish masses, such as \"the absence of useful labor, their harmful pursuit of petty trading, vagrancy, and obstinate aloofness from general civic life.\" Its failure the Government ascribes to the fact that the evil of Jewish exclusiveness has hitherto not been attacked at its root, the latter being imbedded in the religious and communal organization of the Jews. The fountain-head of all misfortunes is the Talmud, which \"fosters in the Jews utmost contempt towards the nations of other faiths,\" and implants in them the desire \"to rule over the rest of the world.\" As a result of the obnoxious teachings of the Talmud, \"the Jews cannot but regard their presence in any other land except Palestine as a sojourn in captivity,\" and \"they are held to obey their own authorities rather than a strange government.\" This explains \"the omnipotence of the Kahals,\" which, contrary to the law of the state, employ secret means to uphold their autonomous authority both in communal and judicial matters, using for this purpose the uncontrolled sums of the special Jewish revenue, the meat tax. The education of the Jewish youth is entrusted to melammeds, \"a class of domestic teachers immersed in profoundest ignorance and superstition,\" and, \"under the influence of these fanatics, the children imbibe pernicious notions of intolerance towards other nations.\" Finally, the special dress worn by the Jews helps to keep them apart from the surrounding Christian population.  The Russian Government \"had adopted a series of protective measures against the Jews,\" without producing any marked effect. Even the Conscription Statute \"had succeeded to a limited extent only in altering the habits of the Jews.\" Mere promotion of agriculture and of Russian schooling had been found inadequate. The expulsions from the villages had proved equally fruitless; \"the Jews, to be sure, have been ruined, but the condition of the rustics has shown no improvement.\"    It is evident, therefore--the Council declares--that restrictions   which go only half way or are externally imposed by the police are   not sufficient to direct this huge mass of people towards useful   occupations. With the patience of martyrs the Jews of Western Europe   had endured the most atrocious persecutions, and had yet succeeded   in keeping their national type intact until the governments took the   trouble to inquire more deeply into the causes separating the Jews   from general civic life, so as to be able to attack the causes   themselves.  After blurting out the truth that the Government's ultimate aim was the obliteration of the Jewish individuality, and modestly yielding the palm in inflicting \"the most atrocious persecutions\" upon the Jews to Western Europe, where after all they were receding into the past, while in Russia they were still the order of the day, the Council of State proceeds to consider \"the example set by foreign countries,\" and lingers with particular affection over the Prussian Regulation of 1797 issued by that country for its recently occupied Polish provinces--the Prussian Emancipation Edict of 1812 the memorandum very shrewdly passes over in silence--and on the system of compulsory schooling adopted by Austria.  Taking its clue from the West, the Council delineates three ways of bringing about \"a radical transformation of this people\":  1: _Cultural reforms_, such as the establishment of special secular schools for the Jewish youth, the fight against the old-fashioned heders and melammeds, the transformation of the rabbinate, and the prohibition of Jewish dress.  2. _Abolition of Jewish autonomy_, consisting in the dissolution of the Kahals and the modification of the system of special Jewish taxation.  3. _Increase of Jewish disabilities_, by segregating from their midst all those who have no established domicile and are without a definite financial status, with a view of subjecting them to disciplinary correction through expulsions, legal restrictions, intensified conscription, and similar police measures.    In this manner--the memorandum concludes--it may be hoped that by   co-ordinating all the particulars of this proposition with the   fundamental idea of reforming the Jewish people, and _by taking   compulsory measures to aid_, the goal of the Government will be   attained.  As a result of this _exposé_ of the Council of State, an imperial rescript was issued on December 27, 1840, calling for the establishment of a \"Committee for Defining Measures looking to the Radical Transformation of the Jews of Russia.\" Count Kiselev, Minister of the Crown Domains, was appointed chairman. The other members included the Ministers of Public Instruction and the Interior, the Assistant-Minister of Finance, the Director of the Second Section of the imperial chancellery, and the Chief of the Political Police, or the dreaded \"Third Section.\" [1] The latter was entrusted with the special task \"to keep a watchful eye on the intrigues and actions which may be resorted to by the Jews during the execution of this matter.\"  [Footnote 1: See p. 21, n. 1.]  Moreover, the _exposé_ of the Council of State, which was to serve as the program of the new Committee, was sent out to the governors-general of the Western region [1] \"confidentially_, for personal information and"]]]
