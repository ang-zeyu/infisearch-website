Nothin' but glory fills 'is mind;   The British charge is somethin' grand; The soldier that 'e reads about Don't 'ave no time for fear an' doubt;   'E's the 'eroic brand. So, when that boy gets in the game, 'E jist wades in an' does the same.  Not bein' old 'ands at the stunt,   They simply does as they are told; But, bein' Aussies--Spare me days!-- They never thinks uv other ways,   But does it brave an' bold. That's 'arf; an' for the other part Yeh got to go back to the start.  Yeh've got to go right back to Dad,   To Gran'dad and the pioneers, 'Oo packed up all their bag uv tricks An' come out 'ere in fifty-six,   An' battled thro' the years; Our Gran'dads; _and their women, too_, That 'ad the grit to face the new.  It's that old stock; an', more than that,   It's Bill an' Jim an' ev'ry son Gettin' three good meat meals a day An' 'eaps uv chance to go an' play   Out in the bonzer sun. It's partly that; but, don't forget, When it's all said, there's somethin' yet.  There's somethin' yet; an' there I'm beat.   Crowds uv these lads I've known, but then, They 'ave got somethin' from this war, Somethin' they never 'ad before,   That makes 'en better men. Better? There's no word I can get To name it right.  There's somethin' yet.  We 'ear a lot about reward;   We praise, an' sling the cheers about; But there was debts we can't repay Piled up on us one single day--   When that first list come out. There ain't no way to pay that debt. Do wot we can--there's somethin' yet.     X. HALF A MAN   Half a Man  \"I WASH me 'ands uv 'im,\" I tells 'em, straight.   \"You women can do wot yeh dash well like. I leave this 'arf a man to 'is own fate;   I've done me bit, an' now I'm gone on strike. Do wot yeh please; but don't arsk 'elp from me; 'E's give me nerves; so now I'll let 'im be.\"  Doreen an' ole Mar Flood 'as got a scheme.   They've been conspirin' for a week or more About this Digger Smith, an' now they dream   They've got 'is fucher waitin' in cool store To 'and 'im out, an' fix 'im up for life. But they've got Buckley's, as I tells me wife.  I've seen 'em whisperin' up in our room.   Now they wants me to join in the debate; But, \"Nix,\" I tells 'em. \"I ain't in the boom,   An' Digger Smith ain't risin' to me bait; 'E's fur too fly a fish for me to catch, An' two designin' women ain't 'is match.\"  I puts me foot down firm, an' tells 'em, No!   Their silly plan's a thing I wouldn't touch. An' then me wife, for 'arf an hour or so,   Talks to me confident, of nothin' much; Then, 'fore I know it, I am all red 'ot Into the scheme, an' leader uv the plot.  'Twas Mar Flood starts it. She got 'old uv 'im--   You know the way they 'ave with poor, weak men-- She drops a tear or two concernin' Jim;   Tells 'im wot women 'ave to bear; an' then She got 'im talkin', like a woman can. 'E never would 'ave squeaked to any man.  She leads 'im on--It's crook the way they scheme   To talk about this girl 'e's left be'ind. Not that she's pryin'!  Why, she wouldn't dream!--   But speakin' uv it might jist ease 'is mind. Then, 'fore 'e knows, 'e's told, to 'is su'prise, Name an' address--an' colour uv 'er eyes!  An' then she's off 'ere plottin' with Doreen--   Bustin' a confidence, I tells 'em, flat. But all me roustin' leaves 'em both serene   Women don't see a little thing like that. An' I ain't cooled off yet before they've got Me workin' for 'em in this crooked plot.  Nex' day Mar Flood she takes 'er Sund'y dress   An' 'er best little bonnet up to town. 'Er game's to see the girl at this address   An' word 'er in regard to comin' down To take Smith be su'prise.  My part's to fix A meetin' so there won't be any mix.  I tips, some'ow, that girl won't 'esitate.   She don't.  She comes right back with Mar nex' day, All uv a fluster. When I seen 'er state   I thinks I'd best see Digger straight away; 'Cos, if I don't, 'e's bound to 'ear the row, With 'er: \"Where is 'e?  Can't I see 'im now?\"  I finds 'im in the paddick down at Flood's.   I 'ums an' 'ars a bit about the crops. 'E don't say nothin': goes on baggin' spuds.  \"'Ow would yeh like,\" I sez to 'im, an' stops. \"'Ow would it be\" . . . 'E stands an' looks at me \"Now, wot the 'Ell's got into you?\" sez 'e.  That don't restore me confidence a bit.   The drarmer isn't goin' as I tipped. I corfs, an' makes another shot at it;   While 'e looks at me like 'e thinks I'm dipped. \"Well--jist suppose,\" I sez; an' then I turn An' see 'er standin' there among the fern.  She don't want no prelimin'ries, this tart;   She's broke away before they rung the bell; She's beat the gun, an' got a flyin' start.   Smith makes a funny noise, an' I sez, \"'Ell\" Because I tumbles that I'm out uv place: But, as I went, I caught sight uv 'er face.  That's all I want to know.  An', as I ran,   I 'ears 'er cry, \"My man!  Man an' a 'arf! Don't fool me with yer talk uv 'arf a man!\". . . .   An' then I 'ears ole Digger start to larf. It was a funny larf, so 'elp me bob: Fair in the middle uv it come a sob. . . .  I don't see Digger till the other night.  \"Well, 'Arf-a-man,\" I sez.  \"'Ow goes it now?\" \"Yes, 'arf a man,\" sez 'e.  \"Yeh got it right; I can't change that, alone, not any'ow. But she is mendin' things.\"  'E starts to larf. \"Some day,\" 'e sez, \"she'll be the better 'arf.\"     XI. SAWIN' WOOD   Sawin' Wood  I WONDERED wot was doin'.  First I seen Ole Missus Flood wave signals to Doreen.   I'm in the paddick slashin' down some ferns;   She's comin' up the road; an' if she turns An 'andspring I won't be su'prised a bit, The way she's caperin', an' goin' it.  She yells out some remark when she gets near, Which I don't catch, I'm too fur off to 'ear.   An' then Doreen comes prancin' to our door,   An' Missus Flood she sprints, an' yells some more; My wife runs to the gate an' waves 'er arms. . . . But I lays low; I'm used to these alarms.  A marri'd bloke, in time, 'e learns a bit; An' 'e ain't over keen to throw a fit   Each time the women calls the fire-reel out.   It's jist a trifle 'e'll know all about When things get normal. That's a point I learn; So I saws wood, an' keeps on cuttin' fern.  At least, I cut a few.  I got to give Reel fac's, an' own I was inquisitive;   An' these 'ere fireworks gets me fair perplexed.   I watch the 'ouse to see wot 'appens next; But nothin's doin'.  They jist goes on in, An' leaves me wonderin' wot's caused the din.  I stands it for a full 'arf-hour or more; Then gets dead sick uv starin' at the door.   I goes down to the 'ouse an' 'unts about   To find some 'baccer, which I 'ave no doubt Is in me trousers pocket all the while. When I goes in, the talk stops, an' they smile.  I sez I've lost me smoke, an' search a bit, An' ask Doreen wot 'as became uv it,   An' turns the mantelshelf all upside-down,   An' looks inside the teapot, with a frown; Then gives it up, an' owns I'd like a drink; When Missus Flood sez, \"Bill, _wot do you think_?\"  Now, ain't that like a woman?  Spare me days, I'll never get resigned to all their ways.   When they 'as news to tell they smile, an' wink,   An' bottle it, an' ask yeh wot yeh think. It's jist a silly game uv theirs, an' so, I gives the countersign: \"Wot?  I dunno.\"  \"Then guess,\" she sez.  Well, I'm a patient bloke, So I sits down an' starts to cut a smoke.   (To play this game yeh've got to persevere.)   \"Couldn't,\" I sez, \"if I guessed for a year\"; Then lights me pipe, an' waits for 'er to speak. At last she sez, \"_Jim's comin' back next week_!\"  \"Go on,\" sez I; an' puffs away awhile Quite unconcerned.  But for to see 'er smile   Was jist a treat: 'er eyes was shinin' bright,   An' she'd grow'd ten years younger in a night. Jist 'ere, Doreen she sez to me, \"Good Lor, Wot do yeh want _two_ plugs uv 'baccer for?\"  I takes me pipe out uv me mouth an' stares, An' stammers, \"Must 'ave found a piece--somewheres.\"   But, by the way she smiles--so extra sweet--   I know she twigs me game, an' I am beat. \"Fancy,\" she sez. \"Yeh're absent-minded, dear. Sure there was nothin' else yeh wanted 'ere?\"  \"Nothin',\" I sez, an' feels a first-prize fool; An' goes outside, an' grabs the nearest tool.   It was the crosscut; so I works like mad   To keep me self-respeck from goin' bad. \"This game,\" I tells meself, \"will do yeh good. You ain't proficient, yet, at sawin' wood.\"     XII. JIM   Jim  \"NOW, be the Hokey Fly!\" sez Peter Begg. \"Suppose 'e comes 'ome with a wooden leg.   Suppose 'e isn't fit to darnce at all,   Then, ain't we 'asty fixin' up this ball? A little tournament at Bridge is my Idear,\" sez Peter.  \"Be the Hokey Fly!\"  Ole Peter Begg is gettin' on in years. 'E owns a reel good farm; an' all 'e fears   Is that some girl will land 'im, by are by,   An' share it with 'im--be the Hokey Fly. That's 'is pet swear-word, an' I dunno wot 'E's meanin', but 'e uses it a lot.  \"Darncin'!\" growls Begg. We're fixin' up the 'all With bits uv green stuff for a little ball   To welcome Jim, 'oo's comin' 'ome nex' day.   We're 'angin' flags around to make things gay, An' shiftin' chairs, an' candle-greasin' floors, 'As is our way when blokes come 'ome from wars.  \"A little game uv Bridge,\" sez Peter Begg, \"Would be more decent like, an' p'r'aps a keg   Uv somethin' if the 'ero's feelin' dry.   But this 'ere darncin'!  Be the Hokey Fly, These selfish women never thinks at all About the guest; they only wants the ball.  \"Now, cards,\" sez Begg, \"amuses ev'ry one. An' then our soldier guest could 'ave 'is fun   If 'e'd lost _both_ 'is legs.  It makes me sick  'Ere!  Don't yeh spread that candle-grease too thick Yeh're wastin' it; an' us men 'as to buy Enough for nonsense, be the Hokey Fly!\"  Begg, 'e ain't never keen on wastin' much. \"Peter,\" I sez, \"it's you that needs a crutch.   Why don't yeh get a wife, an' settle down?\"  'E looks reel fierce, an' answers, with a frown, \"Do you think I am goin' to be rooked For 'arf me tucker, jist to get it cooked?\"  I lets it "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15524"],["title","Digger Smith (#5)"],["body","at that, an' does me job; An' when a little later on I lob   Along the 'omeward track, down by Flood's gate   I meet ole Digger Smith, an' stops to state Me views about the weather an' the war. . . . 'E tells me Jim gets 'ere nex' day, at four.  An' as we talk, I sees along the road A strange bloke 'umpin' some queer sort uv load.   I points 'im out to Smith an' sez; \"'Oo's that?   Looks like a soldier, don't 'e, be 'is 'at?\" \"Stranger,\" sez Digger, \"be the cut uv 'im.\" But, trust a mother's eyes. . . . \"_It's Jim! My Jim_!  \"My Jim!\" I 'ears; an', scootin' up the track Come Missus Flood, with Flo close at 'er back.   It was a race, for lover an' for son;   They finished neck an' neck; but mother won, For it was 'er that got the first good 'ug. (I'm so took back I stands there like a mug.)  _Then_ come Flo's turn; an' Jim an' Digger they Shake 'ands without no fancy, gran'-stand play.   Yeh'd think they parted yesterd'y, them two.   For all the wild 'eroics that they do. \"Yeh done it, lad,\" sez Jim.  \"I knoo yeh would.\" \"You bet,\" sez Smith; \"but I'm all to the good.\"  Then, uv a sudden, all their tongues is loosed. They finds me there an' I am intrajuiced;   An' Jim tells 'ow it was 'e come to land   So soon, while Mar an' Flo each 'olds a 'and. But, jist as sudden, they all stop an' stare Down to the 'ouse, at Dad Flood standin' there.  'E's got 'is 'and up shadin' off the sun. Then 'e starts up to them; but Dad don't run   'E isn't 'owlin' for 'is lost boy's kiss;   'E's got 'is own sweet way in things like this. 'E wanders up, an' stands an' looks at Jim. An', spare me days, that look was extra grim!  I seen the mother pluckin' at 'er dress; I seen the girl's white face an' 'er distress.   An' Digger Smith, 'e looks reel queer to me   Grinnin' inside 'imself 'e seemed to be. At last Dad sez--oh, 'e's a tough ole gun! \"Well, are yeh sorry now for wot yeh done?\"  Jim gives a start; but answers with a grin, \"Well, Dad, I 'ave been learnin' discipline.   An' tho' I ain't quite sure wot did occur   Way back\"--'e's grinnin' worse--\"I'm sorry, sir.\" (It beats me, that, about these soldier blokes They're always grinnin', like all things was jokes.)  P'r'aps Dad is gettin' dull in 'is ole age; But 'e don't seem to see Jim's cammyflage.   P'r'aps 'e don't want to; for, in 'is ole eye,   I seen a twinkle as 'e give reply. \"Nex' week,\" 'e sez, \"we will begin to cart The taters.  Yeh can make another start.\"  But then 'e grabs Jim's 'and.  I seen the joy In mother's eyes.  \"Now, welcome 'ome, me boy,\"   Sez Dad; an' then 'e adds, \"Yeh've made me proud;\"   That's all.  An' 'e don't add it none too loud. Dad don't express 'is feelin's in a shout; It cost 'im somethin' to git that much out.   .    .     .    .    .    .    .    .    .   We 'ad the darnce.  An', spite uv all Begg's fears, Jim darnced like 'e could keep it up for years;   Mostly with Flo.  We don't let up till three;   An' then ole Peter Begg, Doreen an' me We walk together 'ome, an' on the way, Doreen 'as quite a lot uv things to say.  \"Did you see Flo?\" sez she.  \"Don't she look grand? That Jim's the luckiest in all the land--   An' little Smith--that girl uv 'is, I'm sure,   She'll bring 'im 'appiness that will endure.\" She 'ugs my arm, then sez, \"'Usband or wife, If it's the right one, is the wealth uv life.\"  I sneaks a look at Begg, an' answers, \"Yes, Yeh're right, ole girl; that's the reel 'appiness.   An' if ole, lonely growlers was to know   The worth uv 'appy marridge 'ere below, They'd swap their bank-books for a wife,\" sez I. Sez Peter Begg, \"_Well! Be the--Hokey--Fly_!\"     XIII. A SQUARE DEAL   A Square Deal  \"DREAMIN'?\" I sez to Digger Smith.   \"Buck up, ole sport, an' smile. Ain't there enough uv joy to-day To drive the bogey man away   An' make reel things worth while? A bloke would think, to see you stare, There's visions on the 'ill-tops there.\"  \"Dreamin',\" sez Digger Smith.  \"Why not?   An' there is visions too. An' when I get 'em sorted out, An' strafe that little bogey, Doubt,   I'll start me life all new. Oh, I ain't crook; but packed in 'ere Is thoughts: enough to last a year.  \"I'm thinkin' things,\" sez Digger Smith.  \"I'm thinkin' big an' fine Uv Life an' Love an' all the rest, An' wot is right an' wot is best,   An' 'ow much will be mine. Not that I'm wantin' overmuch Some work, some play, an' food an' such.\"  \"See 'ere,\" I sez. \"You 'ark to me.   I've done some thinkin' too. An' this 'ere land, for wot yeh did, Owes some few million solid quid   To fightin' blokes like you. So don't be too dam modest or Yeh'll git less than yeh're lookin' for.\"  \"Money?\" sez Digger.  \"Loot?\" sez 'e   \"Aw, give that talk a rest! I'm sick uv it.  I didn't say That I was thinkin' all uv pay,   But wot was right an' best. An' that ain't in the crazy game Uv grabbin' wealth an' chasin' fame.  \"Do you think us blokes Over There,   When things was goin' strong, Was keepin' ledgers day be day An' reck'nin' wot the crowd would pay?   Pull off!  Yeh got it wrong. Do you think all the boys gone West Wants great swank 'ead-stones on their chest?  \"You chaps at 'ome 'as small ideer   Uv wot we think an' feel. We done our bit an' seen it thro', An' all that we are askin' you   Is jist a fair, square deal. We want this land we battled for To settle up--an' somethin' more.  \"We want the land we battled for   To be a land worth while. We're sick uv greed, an' 'ate, an' strife, An' all the mess that's made uv life.\" . . .   'E stopped a bit to smile. \"I got these thoughts Out There becos We learnt wot mateship reely was.\"   .    .   .    .    .    .    .    .   The hills be'ind the orchard trees   Was showin' misty blue. The ev'nin' light was growin' dim; An' down I sat 'longside uv 'im,   An' done some dreamin' too. I dreams uv war; an' wot is paid By blokes that went an' blokes that stayed.  I dreams uv honour an' reward,   An' 'ow to pay a debt. For partin' cash, an' buyin' farms, An' fittin' chaps with legs an' arms   Ain't all--there's somethin' yet. There's still a solid balance due; An' now it's up to me an' you.  There's men I know ain't yet woke up,   Or reckernized that debt-- Proud men 'oo wouldn't take yeh down Or owe their grocer 'arf-a-crown--   They ain't considered, yet, There's somethin' owin'--to the dead, An' Diggers live for more than bread.  \"_We_ learnt wot mateship was,\" 'e sez.   \"Us Diggers found the good That's hid away somewhere in chaps, An' ain't searched for enough, per'aps,   Or prized, or understood. But all this game uv grab an' greed An' silly 'ate--Why, where's the need?\"  The hills be'ind the orchard trees   Jist caught the settin' sun. A bloke might easy think that there, 'Way back be'ind the range somewhere,   Where streaks uv sunlight run, There was a land, swep' clear uv doubt, Where men finds wot they dreams about.   .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .   \"Beauty,\" sez Digger, sudden-like,  \"An' love, an' kindliness; The chance to live a clean, straight life, A dinkum deal for kids an' wife   A man needs nothin' less. . . . Maybe they'll get it when I go To push up daisies.  I dunno.\"  \"Dreamin',\" sez Digger Smith. \"Why not?   There's visions on the hill.\". . . Then I gets up an' steals away, An' leaves 'im with the dyin' day,   Dreamin' an' doubtin' still. . . . Cobber, it's up to me an' you To see that 'arf 'is dream comes true.
