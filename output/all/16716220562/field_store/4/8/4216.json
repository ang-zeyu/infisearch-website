If a nerve be destroyed it cannot carry messages to and from the brain. Before filling a tooth, the dentist sometimes destroys its nerve.  12. If a nerve be pressed upon too long it cannot perform its duty. If I press upon the nerve passing to my foot, I stop it from communicating with the brain; the foot loses its feeling, or, as I say, \"is asleep.\"  13. If I drink alcoholic liquors, or snuff, smoke, or chew tobacco, my brain and nerves cannot do their work well; because alcohol and nicotine are very poisonous to the brain and nerves.  14. The brain must be supplied with good blood;  The brain must be used;  The brain must be rested;  I must drink wholesome drink, eat wholesome food, take enough exercise, and breathe pure air, that my brain may be supplied with pure blood;  I must study and think, that my brain may grow and be strong for work;  I must rest my brain when it is tired, either by changing my employment, or by going to sleep;  I must not poison my brain with alcohol or tobacco.

The brain is egg-shaped, and of two parts, the large brain (_cerebrum_), and the little brain (_cerebellum_). These are composed of a white and gray substance, which in the large brain is so folded and wrinkled that it looks like the meat of an English walnut; in the little brain it is so arranged that it resembles a tree, and is called _arbor vitae_, tree of life. The mind does its thinking through the large brain, and controls its muscles through the little brain.  A drunken man can not walk straight because alcohol has hurt the little brain; he can not think straight because it has poisoned the large brain.         *       *       *       *       *  [Illustration: THE BRAIN AND THE SPINAL CORD.]  C, the large brain (_cerebrum_).

THE STORY ABOUT ALCOHOL.  Several hundred years ago many people were trying to discover something that would keep them young and strong, and prevent them from dying. It is said by some that a man named Paracelsus, in making experiments, discovered _alcohol_. He called it \"the water of life,\" and boasted that he would never be weak and never die; so he went on drinking alcoholic liquors until at last he died in a drunken fit.  What is this alcohol which has done and is doing so much mischief in the world? I will show you some. What does it look like?--\"Water.\" Yes; and if you were to smell it you would say it has a somewhat pleasant odor; if you were to taste it, that it has a hot, biting taste, _i.e._, is pungent. If you put a lighted match to it you would notice that it burns easily, and with a flame, and may therefore be said to be combustible and inflammable.  What does it come from? Is it one of the drinks God has given us? Some of the class think it is; we will try to learn whether this answer is correct or not. If we study about it very carefully we shall discover that it is not a natural drink, that it is not found except where it has been made from decayed or rotten fruits, grains, or vegetables.  If you take some apples, and squeeze the juice out of them, you will find it sweet and pleasant; let that juice"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15435"],["title","Object Lessons on the Human Body (#8)"],["body","for several days and what will happen to it?--\"It will get bad.\" Yes; or, as grown people say, it will _work_ or _ferment_; that is, the sugary part of the juice will be separated into a kind of gas and a liquid. The gas is called _carbonic acid gas_; the liquid is _alcohol_. Both the gas and the liquid are poisonous.  Alcohol may also be obtained from other fruits, as grapes, and from some grains and vegetables. But all these must first become rotten before alcohol will come out of them. This is one reason why we think that God, who gives us good, wholesome food, did not intend alcohol to be a drink for man, else He would have put it into the delicious ripe fruit, and not made it impossible to get until they decay.  Now let us put upon the blackboard something which will help us remember what we have learned about                            ALCOHOL. DISCOVERED BY         DESCRIPTION.          MADE FROM Paracelsus.           Water-like; with a    Fruits, Grains, or                       pleasant odor; a      Vegetables. CALLED                hot, biting taste; \"The water of life.\"  and will burn with a                       flame.         *       *       *       *       *  USES OF ALCOHOL.  We put some sugar into water; the children see that it melts; then some glue or shellac is placed in the same liquid; they see that this is not melted, but that, when alcohol is used instead of water, the glue or shellac is dissolved. From this experiment they learn that alcohol is used in making varnishes.  Some water is poured into one saucer, and alcohol into another; a lighted match is applied to each; the class notices that the alcohol takes fire and burns, while the water does not.  Next, we fill a lamp with alcohol, and put a wick into it; when the wick becomes wet with the fluid it burns steadily and without smoke, as may be seen by holding a clean white saucer over the flame. This shows why jewellers and others, who wish to use a lamp to make things very hot, prefer alcohol to kerosene, which, as the children know, smokes lamp-chimneys, or anything else, so easily.  We show a thermometer; the children are told its use if they are not already familiar with the instrument; we talk about the quicksilver in the tube, about its rising or falling according to the degree of heat or cold; then we inform the class that in some countries where it is very cold quicksilver freezes; for this reason alcohol, which does not freeze, is colored red and put into the thermometer tube to be used in these Arctic regions.  Another use for alcohol is to keep or preserve substances. This we illustrate by placing a piece of meat into some alcohol. We explain that the water in the meat is that which causes it to decay. Alcohol has the power to take up or _absorb_ water; so when meat is put into this liquid the water from the meat is absorbed by it, and the meat does not become bad. Those who wish to preserve insects a long time, and doctors who desire to keep any portion of a human body after death, put these into alcohol, in which they may be kept for a long time.  Lastly, we let the children smell cologne or other perfumery, and tell them this is made from different oils mixed with alcohol.  At the close of this lesson the class is ready to help us make the following BLACKBOARD OUTLINE.  FACTS ABOUT ALCOHOL.            GOOD USES OF ALCOHOL. It melts gums.                  To melt gums. Burns with a flame.             To make varnishes. Burns without smoke.            To burn in lamps. Will not freeze.                To make camphene, etc. Likes water.                    To put into thermometer Mixes with oils.                tubes.                                 To preserve meats, etc.                                 To make perfumery.                                 In making jewelry.         *       *       *       *       *  USES OF ALCOHOL--_concluded_.  You see alcohol is very useful for some purposes; but do people ever drink it? Some of the children think not, and we grant that no one is foolish enough to drink _raw_ alcohol, because it is too strong. It would take only a little to make them drunk, and only a few ounces to kill them instantly.  We ask the pupils if they have ever seen a drunken person, and what made that person drunk? We soon obtain an answer, and place upon the board \"Rum, gin, whiskey, brandy,\" as the names of drinks which will take away the good sense of those who drink them. To these are added \"Wine, beer, ale, lager, and cider.\"  We explain that all these have alcohol in them, as may be known by smelling them, or by smelling the breath of those who have drunk even a little of them; and that because they contain alcohol they are called _alcoholic liquors_. If a person drinks any one of them he will be poisoned, more or less, according to how much he takes. The children are astonished at the word _poisoned_, but we explain that the very word, _intoxicated_, means poisoned. So a drunken man is a poisoned man. If enough alcohol, or alcoholic liquor, is drunk by anyone, he will drop down dead as quickly as if he were shot by a cannon ball.  When told that alcohol is not a food, but a poison, the class readily understands what we mean, and we have no difficulty in having the following statements prepared and memorized:         *       *       *       *       *  FOOD.  That which makes the body grow, and helps to keep it alive.  POISON.  That which hurts the body, and makes it die.  ALCOHOL.  QUALITIES.                      GOOD USES. Water-like, _looks like         To melt gums. water_.                         To make varnishes. Transparent, _may be seen       To burn in lamps. through clearly_.

To preserve meats, insects, Liquid, _will flow in           etc. drops_.                         To make perfumery. Poisonous, _hurts the           In making jewelry. body_. Intoxicating, _takes away the   BAD USE. senses; makes drunk_.           To drink. Absorbent, _takes up or absorbs water_. Inflammable, _burns with a flame_. Uncongealable, _will not freeze_. Innutritious, _not good for food_.         *       *       *       *       *  ABOUT FERMENTATION AND FERMENTED LIQUOR.  _ALCOHOL._--Alcohol may be obtained from any substance which contains sugar or starch, or both sugar and starch, as apples, pears, grapes, potatoes, beets, rice, barley, maple, honey, etc.  Alcohol can be obtained only by _fermentation_. By fermentation we mean the change which takes place when a juice containing sugar decays, or goes to pieces. You know decay always makes things fall to pieces.  You ask, what pieces is sugar made of? Very, very little pieces, called _atoms_. There are different kinds of sugar. In that made from grapes, called _grape sugar_, there are six atoms of carbon, twelve of hydrogen, and six of oxygen. What are carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen? Oxygen is the kind of gas which keeps animals alive, and makes things burn. Hydrogen is another kind, which you have smelled perhaps when water has been spilled on a hot stove; the gas burned in street-lamps is hydrogen that has been driven out of coal. Carbon you see in charcoal and soot; the black lead of your lead-pencils is mostly composed of carbon and iron; lamp-black is pure carbon, without form or shape.  We will let these circles of colored paper stand for the atoms of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in grape sugar,--the largest, which are red, for the oxygen; the second size, which you notice are black, will represent atoms of carbon; while the little blue ones will make you think of hydrogen.  If you remember that it takes one atom of carbon and two of oxygen to make carbonic acid gas; also, that two atoms of carbon, one of oxygen, and six of hydrogen to form alcohol, you can easily find that two atoms of carbonic acid gas and two atoms of alcohol may be formed from an atom of sugar. So the more sugar a juice contains the more alcohol may be formed from it.  _CIDER._--Cider is made by pressing the juice out of apples. This sweet cider ferments, and the sugar part of it changes into carbonic acid gas and alcohol. People who do not understand this go on drinking cider, not knowing that it makes drunkards of those who drink much of a beverage which seems so pleasant and harmless.  _WINES._--Wines are made from the juices of fruits which have sugar in them, especially grapes. Sometimes people have what they call _home-made wines_, which they make from blackberries, currants, elderberries, gooseberries, cherries, or other fruits. They may ask you to take some, saying, \"This will do you no harm; we did not put any alcohol into it.\" They do not know what you have learned, that alcohol is always formed in fermented juices which contain sugar. It does not wait to be put into the home-made wines; it quietly comes in as they are getting made, at home or any other place, and will make people drunk as surely as when it is found in brandy or any other liquor.  Some of the wines in the stores are made from grape juice, but many more are made by mixing hurtful and poisonous things together to make the liquor strong, and give it what is called a fine color and good taste.  _BEER AND ALES._--These are made from grains and hops, which contain no sugar, it is true, but are composed of starch, which may be changed into sugar. When a seed of grain is put into the ground and begins to grow, the starch in it becomes sugar, which feeds the young plant. When a brewer wishes to make beer, he takes some grain, puts it in a dark place, wets it, and leaves it to sprout, or begin to grow. Then he puts it into an oven to dry it, and make it stop growing. This makes what is called _malt_. The malt is mashed and soaked in warm water to get the sugar out of it; this forms a liquid called _sweet wort_. The wort is separated from the mashed grain and"]]]
