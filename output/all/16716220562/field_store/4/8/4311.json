The Ethels looked about to see the cause of this unexpected expression of joy.  Crawling out through a hedge on to the sidewalk was a child of about Elizabeth's age, but a thin and dirty little mite, with a face that betrayed her race as Irish.  \"What's this morsel doing here all by herself!\" exclaimed Ethel Blue.  \"She must have run away; or perhaps she isn't alone.  Let's look about for her mother.\"  Up and down the street they looked while Elisabeth scraped acquaintance with the sudden arrival upon her path.  \"It doesn't seem as if she could be far off.\"  In truth she was not far off, for as the girls wondered and exclaimed a weak voice made itself heard from the other side of the hedge.  \"Don't take her away,\" it said.  Leaving the children to entertain each other on the sidewalk they enlarged the hole from which the new baby had crawled, and pushed their way through it.  On the ground behind the hedge, and hidden from the sidewalk by its thick twigs lay a young woman, so pale that she frightened the girls.  \"Don't take the baby away.  I'll feel better in a little while.  She crept off from me.\"  \"How did you get here?\" asked Ethel Brown.  \"I came out from New York to look for work in the country.  I felt so sick I lay down here.\"  \"Did you get any work?\"  A slight movement of the head indicated that she had not.  The Ethels consulted each other by disturbed glances.  There was no hospital nearer than Glen Point, and indeed, the woman seemed so ill that they did not see how she could reach the hospital even in the trolley.  As they stood silent and perplexed the honk of a motor roused the almost unconscious woman.  \"Is the baby in the street?\" she inquired frantically.  Ethel Brown crushed her way through the hedge, and found that the children were still on the sidewalk, but were so near its edge that the driver of the car had tooted to warn them back.  To her delight she saw that the driver was Grandfather Emerson.  She waved her hand to stop him.  \"You're a great caretaker!\" he cried.  \"Why do you leave Elisabeth to look after herself in this fashion?  And who's her friend?\"  Ethel climbed into the machine beside him and told of the discovery that the girls had just made.  Mr. Emerson drew the car alongside the curb and jumped out with anxiety written on his face.  The hole in the hedge was too small for him to push through so he ran around the end, and approached the prostrate form of the woman.  Her eyes were closed and she lay so still that Ethel Blue, who was rubbing her hands, shook her head as she glanced up gratefully at the new arrival.  \"What's this, what's this?\" asked Mr. Emerson in his full, rich voice. Its mere sound seemed to carry comfort to the poor creature lying at his feet.  He knelt beside her.  \"Hungry, eh?\" he asked.  \"We'll see about that right off.  Can you eat these cookies?\"  He took a thin tin box out of his pocket and opened it.  \"I have a little granddaughter named Ethel Brown who insists on my keeping cookies in my pocket all the time so that I can eat them when I'm driving.  See if you can take a bite of this.\"  A fluttering hand took the cooky and put it between the pale lips.  Helped by the girls the woman struggled to her feet and stood wavering before she tried to take a step.  She was a young woman with very black hair and gray-blue eyes and a face that was meant to be unlined and pretty and not gaunt with hunger and furrowed by anxiety.  \"You're very good,\" she whispered feebly.  Supported on each side she managed to reach the sidewalk, where she looked about wildly for her baby.  An expression that was sad but infinitely relieved came over her features when she saw the two children sitting in the gravel of the walk filling their tiny hands with pebbles.  \"A cooky won't hurt the baby either,\" decided Mr. Emerson, and he gave one to each of the children.   The Ethels had no chance to ask him what he meant to do without their discovery hearing them, so they helped the woman into the machine, put in the two children and climbed in themselves.  To their great interest Mr. Emerson turned the car about and headed it for his own home.  \"I wonder what Grandmother will say,\" murmured Ethel Brown to Ethel Blue, who was steadying the ill woman's head as it lay against the back of the seat.  Ethel Blue lifted her eyebrows to indicate that she could not guess; but both girls knew in their hearts that Mrs. Emerson would do what was wisest and for the best good of the strays.  She came to the door in answer to the sound of the horn.  \"How did you get back so soon?\" she began to inquire of her husband when her eyes fell on the passengers in the car.  \"An accident?\" she asked anxiously as she ran down the steps.  \"The girls found this woman and her child part way over here and I thought I'd better bring her on and get your opinion about her.  I think she'd like something to eat,\" and the kind old gentleman smiled in friendly fashion as the woman opened frightened eyes at the sound of a new voice.  Among them they succeeded in getting her into the house and into a cool room, where she lay exhausted on the bed, her hand holding tight to the little hand of her baby, lying wearily beside her.  \"Sunstroke?\" asked Grandmother.  \"Hunger,\" replied Mr. Emerson, and he and Ethel Brown went down stairs at once in search of food, while Mrs. Emerson and Ethel Blue managed to undress their patient and put her into a fresh nightdress and bathe her face and hands.  By the time they had done this and were undressing the baby, Ethel Brown and Mrs. Emerson's cook were at the door with jellied broth, milk, gruel and a cooling drink.  Ethel Blue fed the woman, spoonful by spoonful, and Ethel Brown gave the baby alternate spoonfuls of gruel and milk.  \"Sleepy now?\" asked Mrs. Emerson when the dark head sank back on the pillow.  \"Take a nap, then.  See, the baby is right here where you can lay your hand on her.  We'll look in now and then and just as soon as you wake up you must take some more food.\"  \"Must!\" repeated the girl, for she was hardly older than Miss Merriam they saw when her hair was pushed back from her face.  \"Must!  'Tis _glad_ I'll be to be doing it!\" and a ghost of a smile fluttered her lips.  Outside of the bedroom door Mrs. Emerson asked for an explanation and the others for her advice.  \"I don't see how we can tell what we can do until we pull her through this trouble and find out what the poor soul wants to do herself.\"  \"She said she came out from New York to look for work in the country.\"  \"Then we must find her work in the country.  But the first thing for us to attend to is to get her poor body into such a condition that she can work.  She's a sweet looking young woman.  I'm glad you brought her home, Father,\" and between Mr. and Mrs. Emerson there passed a smile of such understanding as makes beautiful the lives of people long and happily married.     CHAPTER III  THE FARMHOUSE  It took a long time to bring Moya Murphy and little Sheila back to health and strength, but it was only a day or two before Moya was able to tell her story to Mrs. Emerson.  She was twenty-five, she said, and she had come to America with her father and mother five years before.  The New World had not given a warm welcome to the new arrivals, for both of the parents had fallen ill with pneumonia only a few weeks after they landed, and both died within a few days of each other.  Moya, left alone and grieving, had soon after married Patrick Murphy, a lad she had known in the old country.  A happy life they led, especially after little Sheila came to bless them.  When the declaration of war in Europe upset business conditions in America, Patrick lost his \"job\" and all summer long he walked the streets, working for a day now and then, but never securing a permanent position, and always growing weaker and less able to work because he was underfed.  The little three-room flat that had been such a joy to them, had long been given up and they lived and ate and slept in one room, and thanked their stars that they had a landlord who did not insist on being paid regularly, as did some they knew about who put their tenants out on the street if the rent was not forthcoming promptly.  \"Somehow it's the sudden things that happens to me,\" said Moya to Mrs. Emerson.  She was sitting on the latticed back porch of the Emersons' house, her fingers busy shelling peas for Kate, the old cook who had lived with Mrs. Emerson ever since she was married.  \"Patrick was crossing the street--'tis only six weeks ago, but it seems years!  An automobile with one of the shrieking horns screamed at him.  'Twas the policeman on the crossing told me.  Patrick was light on his feet always, but that was when he had enough to eat ivery day.  He thried to jump back and his foot slipped and he fell under the car and it killed him.\"  She sobbed and Mrs. Emerson and Kate wiped their eyes.  \"Two days it was before I knew it; there was nothing on his clothes to tell who he was, and I only found out when he didn't come home and I went to the police and they took me to the Morgue and there he lay. They gave me twenty dollars--the policemen did.  They collected it among themselves.\"  \"Didn't they arrest the driver of the car?\"  \"'Twas a light car and it sped away before any one saw the number.\"  Kate Flanigan gave a grunt of disgust at the brutality of the driver.  \"I gave the landlord half the money the policemen gave me.  I owed it for the rint.  Then I set out to hunt work.  Ivery day I walked and walked and ivery day I carried the baby, for where could I leave her? Nobody wanted a girl who wasn't trained to do anything, and even if I had been able to do something well they wanted no baby.  There's no room for babies when you have to work,\" she said bitterly.  \"I want you to feel that you are safe here, you and Sheila,\" said Mrs. Emerson gently.  \"Mrs. Morton and Mrs. Smith and I have been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15550"],["title","Ethel Morton at Rose House (#3)"],["body","it over with Kate, and this is what we've planned, provided you agree.\"  Moya gathered up her baby jealously in her lap.  \"It will keep you and Sheila together,\" said Mrs. Emerson quickly, noticing her gesture, and smiling approvingly as Moya at once let the child slide off her lap on to the floor where she sat contentedly playing with some of the pods of the peas that had fallen from the pan.  \"Perhaps Kate has told you that we are planning to have some women and children who need country air come out from New York this summer and live in a farmhouse that we have on the place here.\"  Moya nodded.  \"She did.\"  \"We need a cook.  We are going to give them simple food, but nourishing and well cooked.\"  \"If it's me you're thinking of for the cooking, ma'am, I'm a poor cook beyond potaties and stew.\"  \"You never were taught to cook?\"  \"Taught?  No, ma'am.  I picked up what little I know from me mother. 'Tis simple enough, but too simple for what you need.\"  \"If you'll try to learn, here's what we've planned.  Kate needs a helper.  Not because she isn't strong and hearty, but because Mr. Emerson and I want her to have a little more time for pleasure than she has had for a good many years.  She won't take a real vacation, so we are going to give her a partial vacation.\"  \"Me being the helper?\" inquired Moya, her thin face lighting.  \"More than the helper.  Kate has agreed to teach you how to cook all the dishes that it will be necessary to cook for the women and children this summer.  You couldn't have a better teacher.\"  \"I'm sure of it,\" answered the young woman, turning gratefully to Kate. \"I'll do my very best.\"  \"You shall have a room for yourself and the baby, and wages,\" and she named a sum that made Moya's eyes burn.  \"I'm not worth that yet,\" she cried, \"but I know you'll need me to dress respectable, so I'll not refuse it and I'll get some decent things for the baby and mesilf!\"  \"If Kate finds that you take hold well she'll teach you more elaborate cooking.  There's always a place waiting somewhere for a good cook, and here's your chance to learn to be a really excellent cook.\"  So the problem of obtaining a cook was settled without trouble, and as Ethel Brown found Mrs. Schuler not only ready but eager to act as Matron, two of the possible difficulties seemed to have proved themselves no difficulties at all.     CHAPTER IV  PLANS  The work of the carpenters filled in very acceptably the time when the members of the Club were toiling at school.  A visit of inspection toward the end of June gave the onlookers the greatest satisfaction.  \"Everything is as fine as a fiddle!\" exclaimed Roger as they all stopped in one of the upstairs rooms.  \"Now it's up to us to do the papering and painting and to concoct some furniture.\"  So it was decided that all the bedrooms should have white paint and walls of delicate hues and that Mrs. Schuler's office should be pink with white paint and white curtains at the windows.  \"We can get very pretty papers for ten cents a roll,\" said Margaret. \"I saw some beauties when I went to the paperers to get some flowery papers for James to cut out when he was pasting decorations on to our Christmas Ship boxes.\"  \"Are you going to use wall paper?\" asked Miss Merriam quickly.  \"Aren't we?\" inquired Margaret.  \"It didn't occur to me that there was anything else.  There is paper on the walls now.\"  \"It's a lot more sanitary to have the walls kalsomined, I know that,\" said James in a superior tone.  \"Haven't you heard Father say so a dozen times?\"  \"I suppose I have, now I think about it,\" replied Margaret.  \"It stands to reason that there would be less chance for germs to hide.\"  \"Do you suppose these old walls are in good enough condition to go uncovered?\" asked Roger, passing his hand over a suspicious bulge that forced the paper out, and casting his eye at the ceiling which was veined with hair cracks.  \"Probably the walls will not be in the pink Of condition,\" returned Mrs. Morton; \"but, even so, color-washing will be better than papering.\"  \"We can go over them and fill up the cracks,\" suggested Tom, \"and we can whitewash the ceilings.\"  \"That's what I should advise,\" said Miss Merriam.  \"Put the walls and ceilings in as good condition as you can, and then put on your wash. Kalsomining is rather expensive, but there are plenty of color washes now that any one can put on who can wield a whitewash brush.\"  \"Me for the whitewash brush at an early date,\" Roger sang gayly.  \"What do you suggest for these upstairs floors, Miss Merriam?  Grandfather thought they weren't bad enough to have new ones laid, but they do look rather rocky, don't they?\"  He cast a disparaging glance at the boards under his feet, and waited for help.  \"Were you planning to paint them?\"  \"Yes,\" Roger nodded.  \"Then you ought to putty up the cracks first.  That will make them smooth enough.  They're not really rough, you see.  It's the spaces between the planks that make them seem so.\"  \"That's easily done.  We thought we'd paint these old floors and stain the new ones down stairs.\"  \"I'd do that.  Paint these floors tan or gray, if you want them to confess frankly that they're painted floors, or the shade of some wood if you want to pretend that they're hard wood floors.\"  James moved uneasily.  Roger guessed the reason.  \"What's the matter, old man?  Treasury low?\"  \"It always is,\" answered James uncomfortably.  \"How are we going to fill it?\"  \"That's what I've been thinking,\" Ethel Brown said meditatively.  \"It's time we did something to earn something.\"  \"Everybody I've sold cookies to all winter seems to have stopped eating them,\" complained Ethel Brown.  \"I'm thinking of getting up a cooky sale to relieve my financial distress.\"  \"There's an idea,\" cried Tom.  \"Why can't we have a cooky sale--with a few other things thrown in--and use the proceeds for the decoration and furnishing of Rose House?\"  \"We've had so many entertainments; can we do anything different enough for the Rosemonters to be willing to come?\"  \"And spend?\"  \"I think the Rosemonters have great confidence in our getting up something new and interesting; ditto the Glen Pointers,\" insisted Margaret who lived at Glen Point and knew the opinions of her neighbors.  \"Where could we have it--_it_ meaning our sale or whatever we decide to have?\"  \"Why not have it here?  Let's wait until the boys have the house all painted and whitewashed and colorwashed so it looks as fresh as possible, and then tell the town what it is we are trying to do this summer, and ask them over here to see what it looks like.\"  \"Good enough.  When they see that it's good as far as it goes, but that our Fresh Air people will be mighty uncomfortable if they don't have some beds to sleep in and a few other trifles of every day use, they'll buy whatever we have to sell.  That's the way it seems to me,\" and Roger threw himself down on the grass before the front door with an air of having said the final word.  \"Let's ask the people of _Rose_mont to come to _Rose_ House to a _Rose_ Fête,\" cried Ethel Blue, while every one of her hearers waved his handkerchief at the suggestion.  \"I'll draw a poster with the announcement on it,\" she went on, \"and we can have it printed on pink paper and the boys can go round on their bicycles and distribute them at every house.\"  \"We must have everything pink, of course.  Pink ice cream and cakes with pink icing--\"  \"And pink strawberries--\"  \"Not green ones!  No, sir!\"  \"And watermelons if we can get some that won't make too much trouble for Dr. Hancock.\"  \"How are we going to serve them?  We can't bring china way out here--and we won't have any for Rose House until after we give this party to earn it!\"  \"They have paper plates with pretty patterns on them now.  And if they cost too much we might get the plain ones and lay a d'oyley of pink paper on each one,\" suggested Margaret.  \"Probably that will be the cheapest and the effect will be just as good, but I'll find out the prices in town,\" promised Delia.  \"I have a scheme for a table of fancy things,\" offered Dorothy.  \"Let's have it under that tree over there and over it let's hang a huge rose. I think I know how to make it--two hoops, the kind Dicky rolls, one above the other, the smaller one on top, and both suspended from the tree.  Cover them inside and out with big pink paper petals.\"  \"How are you going to make it look like a rose and not a pink bell?\" inquired Delia.  \"Put a green calyx on the top and some yellow stamens inside and then make a stem that will look like the real thing, only gigantic.\"  \"How will you manage that?\"  \"Do you remember those wild grape vines that Helen and Ethel Brown found in the West Woods and used for Hallowe'en decorations?  If we could get a thick one and wind it with green paper and let it curve from the rose toward the ground it ought to look like a real stem.\"  \"We could hang the rose with dark string that wouldn't show, and fasten the stem to the branch of the tree with a pink bow.  It would look as if some giant had tied it there for his ladylove.\"  \"I have an old pink sash I'll contribute to the good cause,\" laughed Helen.  \"I've been wondering what to do with it for some time.\"  \"Everything on the table must be pink and shaped like a rose or decorated with roses--cushions, pen-wipers, baskets, stencilled bureau sets--there are a thousand things to be made.\"  \"Boxes covered with rose paper,\" suggested James solemnly.  Everybody shouted, for James's imagination always seemed to be stimulated whenever he saw a chance to make something with paste-pot and brush.  \"How about music?\"  This question brought silence, for it was not easy to arrange for music in the open.  \"I wish Edward and his violin were here,\" said Delia, referring to her brother, Dr. Watkins, who had recently gone to Oklahoma to assist an older physician in a flourishing town there.  He had been very attentive to Miss Merriam and she was annoyed to find herself blushing at the mention of "]]]
