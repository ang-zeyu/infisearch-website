She, too, had at last       been aroused by the conversation, and, missing her husband, she       had thrown a wrapper about her and had come down to seek him.        “We tame down to find Santy Claus,” burst out young John William,       at the sight of her, “and he’s been here, look muvver.”        Yes, Santa Claus had indeed been there. The boy spoke better than       he knew.        “And this,” said little Helen eagerly, pointing proudly to her       new acquaintance, “is a friend of his, and he knows papa and he’s       got a little Helen and we’re going to give her a Merry       Christmas.”        William Carstairs had no secrets from his wife. With a flash of       womanly intuition, although she could not understand how he came       to be there, she divined who this strange guest was who looked a       pale, weak picture of her strong and splendid husband, and yet       she must have final assurance.        “Who is this gentleman, William?” she asked quietly, and John       Carstairs was forever grateful to her for her word that night.        “This,” said William Carstairs, “is my father’s son, my brother,       who was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.”        And so, as it began with the beginning, this story ends with the       ending of the best and most famous of all the stories that were       ever told.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  ON CHRISTMAS GIVING        _Being a Word of Much Needed Advice_         Christmas is the birthday of our Lord, upon which we celebrate       God’s ineffable gift of Himself to His children. No human soul       has ever been able to realize the full significance of that gift,       no heart has ever been glad enough to contain the joy of it, and       no mind has ever been wise enough to express it. Nevertheless we       powerfully appreciate the blessing and would fain convey it       fitly. Therefore to commemorate that great gift the custom of       exchanging tokens of love and remembrance has grown until it has       become well nigh universal. This is a day in which we ourselves       crave, as never at any other time, happiness and peace for those       we love and that ought to include everybody, for with the angelic       message in our ears it should be impossible to hate any one on       Christmas day however we may feel before or after.        But despite the best of wills almost inevitably Christmas in many       instances has created a burdensome demand. Perhaps by the method       of exclusion we shall find out what Christmas should be. It is       not a time for extravagance, for ostentation, for vulgar display,       it is possible to purchase pleasure for someone else at too high       a price to ourselves. To paraphrase Polonius, “Costly thy gift as       thy purse can buy, rich but not expressed in fancy, for the gift       oft proclaims the man.” In making presents observe three       principal facts; the length of your purse, the character of your       friend, and the universal rule of good taste. Do not plunge into       extravagance from which you will scarcely recover except in       months of nervous strain and desperate financial struggle. On the       other hand do not be mean and niggardly in your gifts. Oh, not       that; avoid selfishness at Christmas, if at no other time. Rather       no gift at all than a grudging one. Let your offerings represent       yourselves and your affections. Indeed if they do not represent       you, they are not gifts at all. “The gift without the giver is       bare.”        And above all banish from your mind the principle of reciprocity.       The _lex talionis_ has no place in Christmas giving. Do not think       or feel that you must give to someone because someone gave to       you. There is no barter about it. You give because you love and       without a thought of return. Credit others with the same feeling       and be governed thereby. I know one upon whose Christmas list       there are over one hundred and fifty people, rich and poor, high       and low, able and not able. That man would be dismayed beyond       measure if everyone of those people felt obliged to make a return       for the Christmas remembrances he so gladly sends them.        In giving remember after all the cardinal principle of the day.       Let your gift be an expression of your kindly remembrance, your       gentle consideration, your joyful spirit, your spontaneous       gratitude, your abiding desire for peace and goodwill toward men.       Hunt up somebody who needs and who without you may lack and       suffer heart hunger, loneliness, and disappointment.        Nor is Christmas a time for gluttonous eating and drinking. To       gorge one’s self with quantities of rich and indigestible food is       not the noblest method of commemorating the day. The rules and       laws of digestion are not abrogated upon the Holy day. These are       material cautions, the day has a spiritual significance of which       material manifestations are, or ought to be, outward and visible       expressions only.        Christmas is one of the great days of obligation in the Church       year, then as at Easter if at no other time, Christians should       gather around the table of the Lord, kneeling before God’s altar       in the ministering of that Holy Communion which unites them with       the past, the present, and the future—the communion of the saints       of God’s Holy Church with His Beloved Son. Then and thus in body,       soul, and spirit we do truly participate in the privilege and       blessing of the Incarnation, then and there we receive that       strength which enables everyone of us to become factors in the       great extension of that marvellous occurrence throughout the ages       and throughout the world.        Let us therefore on this Holy Natal Day, from which the whole       world dates its time, begin on our knees before that altar which       is at once manger, cross, throne. Let us join thereafter in holy       cheer of praise and prayer and exhortation and Christmas carol,       and then let us go forth with a Christmas spirit in our hearts       resolved to communicate it to the children of men, and not merely       for the day but for the future. To make the right use of these       our privileges, this it is to save the world.        In this spirit, therefore, so far as poor, fallible human nature       permits him to realize it and exhibit it, the author wishes all       his readers which at present comprise his only flock—        A MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  IT WAS THE SAME CHRISTMAS MORNING        _In Which it is Shown how Different the Same Things may Be_        _A Story for Girls_         In Philadelphia the rich and the poor live cheek by jowl—or       rather, back to back. Between the streets of the rich and       parallel to them, run the alleys of the poor. The rich man’s       garage jostles elbows with the poor man’s dwelling.        In a big house fronting on one of the most fashionable streets       lived a little girl named Ethel. Other people lived in the big       house also, a father, a mother, a butler, a French maid, and a       host of other servants. Back of the big house was the garage.       Facing the garage on the other side of the alley was a little,       old one-story-and-a-half brick house. In this house dwelt a       little girl named Maggie. With her lived her father who was a       labourer; her mother, who took in washing; and half a dozen       brothers, four of whom worked at something or other, while the       two littlest went to school.        Ethel and Maggie never played together. Their acquaintance was       simply a bowing one—better perhaps, a smiling one. From one       window in the big playroom which was so far to one side of the       house that Ethel could see past the garage and get a glimpse of       the window of the living-room in Maggie’s house, the two little       girls at first stared at each other. One day Maggie nodded and       smiled, then Ethel, feeling very much frightened, for she had       been cautioned against playing with or noticing the children in       the alley, nodded and smiled back. Now neither of the children       felt happy unless they had held a pantomimic conversation from       window to window at some time during the day.        It was Christmas morning. Ethel awoke very early, as all properly       organized children do on that day at least. She had a beautiful       room in which she slept alone. Adjacent to it, in another room       almost as beautiful, slept Celeste, her mamma’s French maid.       Ethel had been exquisitely trained. She lay awake a long time       before making a sound or movement, wishing it were time to arise.       But Christmas was strong upon her, the infection of the season       was in her blood. Presently she slipped softly out of bed,       pattered across the room, paused at the door which gave entrance       to the hall which led to her mother’s apartments, then turned and       plumped down upon Celeste.        “Merry Christmas,” she cried shaking the maid.        To awaken Celeste was a task of some difficulty. Ordinarily the       French woman would have been indignant at being thus summarily       routed out before the appointed hour but something of the spirit       of Christmas had touched her as well. She answered the salutation       of the little girl kindly enough, but as she sat up in bed she       lifted a reproving finger.        “But,” she said, “you mus’ keep ze silence, Mademoiselle Ethel.       Madame, vôtre maman, she say she mus’ not be disturb’ in ze       morning. She haf been out ver’ late in ze night and she haf go to       ze bed ver’ early. She say you mus’ be ver’ quiet on ze Matin de       Noël!”        “I will be quiet, Celeste,” answered"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15343"],["title","A Little Book for Christmas (#6)"],["body"," little girl, her lip       quivering at the injunction.        It was so hard to be repressed all the time but especially on       Christmas Day of all others.        “Zen I will help you to dress immediatement, and zen Villiam, he       vill call us to see ze tree.”        Never had the captious little girl been more docile, more       obedient. Dressing Ethel that morning was a pleasure to Celeste.       Scarcely had she completed the task and put on her own clothing       when there was a tap on the door.        “Vat is it?”        “Mornin’, Miss Celeste,” spoke a heavy voice outside, a voice       subdued to a decorous softness of tone, “if you an’ Miss Ethel       are ready, the tree is lit, an’—”        “Ve air ready, Monsieur Villiam,” answered Celeste, throwing open       the door dramatically.        Ethel opened her mouth to welcome the butler—for if that solemn       and portentous individual ever unbent it was to Miss Ethel, whom       in his heart of hearts he adored—but he placed a warning finger       to his lip and whispered in an awestruck voice:        “The master, your father, came in late last night, Miss, an’ he       said there must be no noise or racket this morning.”        Ethel nodded sadly, her eyes filling at her disappointment;       William then marched down the hall with a stately magnificence       peculiar to butlers, and opened the door into the playroom. He       flung it wide and stood to one side like a grenadier, as Celeste       and Ethel entered. There was a gorgeous tree, beautifully       trimmed. William had bought the tree and Celeste’s French taste       had adorned it. It was a sight to delight any child’s eyes and       the things strewn around it on the floor were even more       attractive. Everything that money could buy, that Celeste and       William could think of was there. Ethel’s mother had given her       maid carte blanche to buy the child whatever she liked, and       Ethel’s father had done the same with William. The two had pooled       their issue and the result was a toyshop dream. Ethel looked at       the things in silence.        “How do you like it, Miss?” asked William at last rather       anxiously.        “Mademoiselle is not pleased?” questioned the French woman.        “It—it—is lovely,” faltered the little girl.        “We haf selected zem ourselves.”        “Yes, Miss.”        “Didn’t mamma—buy anything—or papa—or Santa?”        “Zey tell us to get vatever you vould like and nevair mind ze       money.”        “It was so good of you, I am sure,” said Ethel struggling       valiantly against disappointment almost too great to bear.       “Everything is beautiful but—I—wish mamma or papa had—I wish they       were here—I’d like them to wish me a Merry Christmas.”        The little lip trembled but the upper teeth came down on it       firmly. The child had courage. William looked at Celeste and       Celeste shrugged her shoulders, both knowing what was lacking.        “I am sure, Miss, that they do wish you a Merry Christmas,       an’”—the butler began bravely, but the situation was too much for       him. “There goes the master’s bell,” he said quickly and turned       and stalked out of the room gravely, although no bell had       summoned him.  [Illustration: “I am sure, Miss, that they do wish you a Merry Christmas.”]        “You may go, Celeste,” said Ethel with a dignity not unlike her       mother’s manner.        The maid shrugged her shoulders again, left the room and closed       the door. Everything was lovely, everything was there except that       personal touch which means so much even to the littlest girl.       Ethel was used to being cared for by others than her parents but       it came especially hard on her this morning. She turned, leaving       the beautiful things as they were placed about the tree, and       walked to the end window whence she could get a view of the       little house beyond the garage over the back wall.        There was a Christmas tree in Maggie’s house too. It wouldn’t       have made a respectable branch for Ethel’s tree, and the       trimmings were so cheap and poor that Celeste would have thrown       them into the waste basket immediately. There were a few common,       cheap, perishable little toys around the tree on the floor but to       Maggie it was a glimpse of heaven. She stood in her little white       night-gown—no such thing as dressing for her on Christmas       morning—staring around her. The whole family was grouped about       her, even the littlest brothers, who went to school because they       were not big enough to work, forgot their own joy in watching       their little sister. Her father, her mother, the big boys all in       a state of more or less dishevelled undress stood around her,       pointing out first one thing and then another which they had been       able to get for her by denying themselves some of the necessities       of life. Maggie was so happy that her eyes brimmed, yet she did       not cry. She laughed, she clapped her hands, and kissed them all       round and finally found herself, a big orange in one hand, a tin       trumpet in the other, perched upon her father’s broad shoulders       leading a frantic march around the narrow confines of the       living-room. As she passed by the one window she caught a glimpse       of the alley. It had been snowing throughout the night and the       ground was white.        “Oh,” she screamed with delight, “let me see the snow on       Christmas morning.”        Her father walked over to the window, parted the cheap lace       curtains, while Maggie clapped her hands gleefully at the       prospect. Presently she lifted her eyes and looked toward the       other window high up in the air, where Ethel stood, a mournful       little figure. Maggie’s papa looked too. He knew how cheap and       poor were the little gifts he had bought for his daughter.        “I wish,” he thought, “that she could have some of the things       that child up there has.”        Maggie however was quite content. She smiled, flourished her       trumpet, waved her orange, but there was no answering smile on       Ethel’s face now. Finally the wistful little girl in the big       house languidly waved her hand, and then Maggie was taken away to       be dressed lest she should catch cold after the mischief was       done.        “I hope that she’s having a nice Christmas,” said Maggie,       referring to Ethel.        “I hope so too,” answered her mother, wishing that her little       girl might have some of the beautiful gifts she knew must be in       the great house.        “Whatever she has,” said Maggie, gleefully, “she can’t have any       nicer Christmas than I have, that you and papa and the boys gave       me. I’m just as happy as I can be.”        Over in the big house, Ethel was also wishing. She was so unhappy       since she had seen Maggie in the arms of her big, bearded father,       standing by the window, that she could control herself no longer.       She turned away and threw herself down on the floor in front of       the tree and buried her face in her hands bursting into tears.        It was Christmas morning and she was all alone.  [Illustration]     [Illustration]  A CHRISTMAS CAROL  “_Christmas Then and Now_”   The Stars look down On David’s town, While angels sing in Winter night; The Shepherds pray, And far away The Wise Men follow guiding light. Little Christ Child By Mary Mild In Manger lies without the Inn; Of Man the Son, Yet God in One, To save the lost in World of Sin. Still stars look down On David’s town And still the Christ Child dwells with men, What thought give we To such as He, Or souls who live in Sin as then?

Henry Ives, alone in the long railroad coach,       stared out of the clouded windows at the whirling mass of snow       with feelings of dismay. It was the day before Christmas, almost       Christmas Eve. Henry did not feel any too happy, indeed he had       hard work to keep down a sob. His mother had died but a few weeks       before and his father, the captain of a freighter on the Great       Lakes, had decided, very reluctantly, to send him to his brother       who had a big ranch in western Nebraska.        Henry had never seen his uncle or his aunt. He did not know what       kind of people they were. The loss of his mother had been a       terrible blow to him and to be separated from his father had       filled his cup of sorrow to the brim. His father’s work did not       end with the close of navigation on the lakes, and he could not       get away then although he promised to come and see Henry before       the ice broke and traffic was resumed in the spring.        The long journey from the little Ohio town on Lake Erie to       western Nebraska had been without mishap. His uncle’s ranch lay       far away from the main line of the railroad on the end of the       branch. There was but one train a day upon it, and that was a       mixed train. The coach in which Henry sat was attached to the end       of a long string of freight cars. Travel was infrequent in that       section of the country. On this day Henry was the only passenger.        The train had been going up-grade for many miles and had just       about reached the crest of the divide. Bucking the snow had       become more and more difficult; several times the train had       stopped. Sometimes the engine backed the train some"]]]
