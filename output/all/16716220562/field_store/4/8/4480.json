From Harrow he had gone to Brazenose; then had quite suddenly thrown up the 'Varsity and returned to Egypt.  Love?  Not at all, for was not his indifference to woman supreme and sincere?  Just the inevitable ending of a very commonplace, sordid little story which had taught the youth one of life's bitterest lessons.  One of a multitude of guests at Hurdley Castle, he had met a woman, beautiful but predatory, whose looks were taking on an autumnal tint, and whose banking account had shrivelled under the frost of extravagance.  His utter indifference to her wiles and her beauty had culminated in a degrading scene of anger on her part, when, forgetting her breeding, her birth and her nationality, she had first of all twitted him and then openly laughed at his mixed parentage.  He had stood without uttering a word, white to the lips during her tirade.  \"Do you think that any white woman would marry you--a _half-caste_?\" had cried the woman, whose bills were coming in in shoals.  \"Yes, many,\" he had quietly answered as he bent to pick up her torn, handkerchief.  \"Am I not a rich man?\"  He had returned to Egypt upon a visit to the Flat Oasis where dwelt his parents, who, though noting the indescribable hurt in the eyes of their firstborn, yet asked no question, for in Egypt a youth is his own master and ofttimes married at the age of fourteen; how much more, therefore, is he a man at over twenty years?  He had visited his own house in the Oasis of Khargegh, with the purpose of putting his stables in order and his falconers through a stiff catechism, and had finally set out to see something of the world.  Not in a desire to cover his hurt, for he was as stoical as any high-bred Arab; and, Mohammedan from belief as well as early training, did not kick against what he looked upon as the commands of Allah.  As for women--well!  The sweet, docile woman of his father's race interested him not at all, so that he refused to listen to any hint anent the desirability of his taking a wife and establishing the succession of the House 'an Mahabbha, which is the eldest branch of the House el-Umbar; and racial distinction barred him from the virile, lovely women of his mother's race.  He had his horses, his hawks, his hunting cheetahs, his dogs; one great treasure which he prized and one little conceit.  The treasure had been found in the ruins of the Temple Deir-el-Bahari. An ornament of gold set with precious stones.  Its shape was that of the Hawk, which had stood as the symbol of the North in the glorious days of Ancient Egypt.  The wings were of emeralds tipped with rubies; gold were the claws and gold the Symbol of Life they held; the body and tail were a mass of precious stones; and the eye of some jet-black stone, unknown to the present century.  As an ornament it was of great value; as an antiquity found in the Shrine of Anubis, the God of Death, its value could not even be guessed at; and how it had come into the possession of Hugh Garden Ali will never be known, though of a truth, unlimited wealth works wonders.  And upon his horses' saddle-cloths, his falcons' hoods, his hounds' coats, and the fine linen and satins of his Eastern raiment he had the emblem worked in thread or silk or jewels, or painted in soft colours.  It was just a pretty conceit, but in conjunction with one-half of his lineage and his love for his birds, it had earned him the title of \"The Hawk of Egypt.\"  And such was the man as he stood in the market-place, having followed the path which Fate had marked out for him through the twisting lanes of the bazaar.     CHAPTER II    \"_Dog, ounce, bear and bull,   Wolf, lion, horse_.\"          DU BARTAS.   Damaris should not have been strolling by herself in the native quarter.  If you are drab or flat of chest or soul or face, you can saunter your fill in any bazaar without adventure befalling you; if, however, nature should have endowed you with the colouring of a desert sunset, if, in short, you _can_ add a splash of colour to anything so colourful as a native bazaar, then 'twere wise to do your sauntering under the wing of a vigilant chaperon, so that the curiosity and interest resultant on your splash may reach you obliquely and \"as through a glass, darkly.\"  But there was no one to worry the girl at this hour before sunset, so that little by little and quite unconsciously she moved forward until she stood outside the doorway.  She stood, outlined against a background of blazing colours, which served in no way to dim her beauty.  Through the yellow-white arch of the doorway showed a stretch of turquoise-blue sky across which, upon a string, swung golden onions and scarlet peppercorns, whilst underneath ruminated a fine, superbly indifferent dromedary.  For a moment Hugh Carden Ali, jogged by Fate, looked straight across at the beautiful picture, staying his talk with Abdul, who, with the courtesy of the East, did not turn his head as he stroked the breast and head of the _shahin_ on his fist.  But Damaris, with envy rampant in her heart, had no eyes for mere man; she wanted to walk across and get near the coal-black stallion from Unayza, a district famous for its breed of large, heavy-built horses. He stood impatiently, with an occasional plunk of a hoof on the sandy stones, or nuzzled his master's sleeve, or pulled at it with his teeth, whilst two shaggy dogs of Billi lay stretched out awaiting the signal to be up and going, perhaps, in a sprint across the desert after the _hosseny_ or red rascal of a fox which had been trapped and caged for the sole purpose of hunting.  Ride out with the caged _hosseny_ on a thoroughbred camel or thoroughbred horse, take with you a couple of greyhounds and a dog or so from Billi, get right off the tourist track and let the red rascal out, and see if you don't have some fun before breakfast.  Only get off the tourist track, else you will have all the bazaar camels and ponies loping along behind you.  The only wild beast this afternoon for sale was a jaguar, black as ink, smooth as satin, short, heavy, with half-closed green eyes fixed steadfastly upon a plump white pigeon foolishly strutting just out of reach of the steel-pointed claws.  \"Take her upon thy fist, O Master,\" said Abdul of Shammar, as he lengthened the jesses, the short, narrow straps of leather or woven silk or cotton with which to hold the hawk.  \"See, she is well reclaimed, being tame and gentle and altogether amiable.  When thrown, she is as a bullet from a rifle, binding her quarry in high air even as a man holds his woman to his heart upon the roof-top under the stars. She is full summed\"--and he ran his slender fingers through the new feathers, full and soft after moulting; \"she is keen as the winter wind--behold the worn and blunted nails; she will not give up, my master, yet will she come to the lure as quickly, as joyfully as a maid to her lover.\"  Hugh Carden Ali, the greatest authority after Abdul on the _shahin_, took the bird upon his fist, looked at the sunken, piercing eyes which were partially seeled; ran his hand over the narrow body, short tail and black back, and a finger over the large beak and deep mouth; held up the ugly face to the light, examined the flight-feathers and, moving his hand quickly up and down, caused the bird to flutter its wings--and so give him a chance of measuring the distance of the wings from the body.  Finding her altogether lovely, he nodded and handed her back to the delighted falconer of Shammar, just as with a decisive pat the jaguar landed, its huge paw upon the strutting pigeon, which had forgotten to keep its distance.  For a moment the attention of the spectators, who were mostly squatting on their heels, was diverted from the master and the falconer.  They laughed, they moved, whilst some in the back row stood up to see the fun, leaving for one second an open space through which Damaris could see the fluttering white bird.  \"Ah!\" she cried, heartbroken at the sight; then, \"Fetch!\" she commanded the dog, pointing across the square.  Now, the dog, who had dispensed with his spiked collar on account of the heat, had no more idea than the man in the moon what he had to fetch for his beloved mistress; but, restless from prolonged inactivity and the smell of strange beasts, he hurled himself in the direction pointed; and his speed, once he got going, was as surprising as that of the elephant or rhinoceros and other clumsy-looking animals, and in very truth, his appearance was just as terrifying.  He crashed head-foremost into the back row of spectators, which, as one man, yelled and fled; tore along the path made clear for him, and sensing an enemy in the growling jaguar, was at its throat like a thrown spear; missing it by an inch as the black beast flung itself back to the full length of the steel chain which fastened it to an iron ring in the ground.  Damaris in her turn rushed, across the square, passing the astounded spectators, who salaamed as she ran.  And as she ran she shouted:  \"Let the animal loose,\" she cried.  \"Give it a chance; let it loose.\"  But Hugh Carden Ali, not in the least understanding the sudden onslaught, but with every sporting instinct uppermost, had already leant down in the seething, growling mass of fur and hate, and loosened the chain; whilst, with screams of fear and delight, the crowd raced for the adjacent houses, from the upper windows of which they could hang in safety to watch the fight.  Disgusting?  Quite so!  But have you ever heard of bull-fighting or pigeon-shooting in civilised, humane Europe?  There followed a frightful scene, during which Abdul, having picked up the pigeon, hastily flung his birds far behind the growling, spitting, raging couple, whilst the stallion, rearing in terror, nearly jerked his master, who had the bridle slipped over his arm, off his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15721"],["title","The Hawk of Egypt (#2)"],["body","eet.  The two dogs of Billi and the two greyhounds leapt and barked and snapped at the belligerents until Wellington, taking an off-chance, suddenly turned and bit one of them clean through the shoulder; whereupon it yelped and howled and fled, whilst shouts of \"_Ma sha-Allah_\" and much clapping came from the upper windows.  Damaris ran straight towards the man, who, slipping the bridle, put both arms round her to draw her to safety; then, suddenly realising the beauty, the youth and the pure whiteness of her, as suddenly let her go.  \"Shall I separate them?\" he asked simply.  \"No!  Not even if you could.  Once my dog's blood is up, nothing but death will satisfy him.\"  She stood quite still, as white as a sheet, with both hands on his arm, whilst the great dog hurled himself at the spitting brute, only to meet the teeth and claws which drew blood at every attempt, until the ground was crimson where they fought.  And then, with tears streaming down her cheeks, Damaris looked up into the man's face; then buried her face on his shoulder.  And the seed of love which is in the heart of every human burst through, the clogging mould of custom and convention and, taking root, put forth shoots and sprang in one moment into the great tree of love of which the fruits, being those of purity, honour and sacrifice, are golden.  Yet he did not touch her, having learned his lesson; instead, he raised his right hand above his head.  \"Allah!\" he said, in praise of that which had come unto him, \"Allah, there is no God but Thee,\" just as, with a sudden swish, a flock of startled pigeons flashing like jewels in the setting sun new low down across his head, bringing an end to the battle.  For one half-second the jaguar's green eyes shifted, and the dog was at its throat.  There was a mighty, convulsive effort of the hind-legs which ripped the bulldog's sides, a click, a shiver, and the black brute fell dead, as the dog, a mass of blood, foam and pride, hurled himself onto the skirt of his beloved mistress, whilst the enraptured spectators, yelling with excitement, rushed out into the square with shouts of \"_Ma sha-Allah_,\" which means, \"Well done, well done!\"  \"Keep quite still,\" said Hugh Carden Ali, gently, as Damaris made an effort to turn; then, speaking quickly to the beaming, salaaming spectators, who had had the time of their lives gambling on the chances of either animal, ordered them to remove the dead beast and to strew the place with sand.  And \"_Irja Sooltan_,\" he called to the stallion, which, terrified at the sounds and sight and smell of battle, had bolted up a side street, where he stood fretting and fidgeting himself into a fine sweat, until he heard the clear call which could always bring him back to the man he loved.  He stood for one second, then flung up his heels to the devastation of a stall of earthenware, and raced back to the square at a most unseemly pace, causing the spectators once more to fly in all directions with cries of \"U'a u'a,\" which means, \"Look out, look out!\"  He pushed his soft nose with determination against the woman who stood so close to his master, so that she looked up, and then smiled and stretched out her arms.  \"You beauty!\" she cried.  \"Oh, you _beauty_!\"  \"You ride?\"  Damaris, thinking of the hack, the only thing with the shape of a horse she had been able to get so far, and upon the back of which she loathed to be seen, made a grimace.  \"I go out on horseback,\" she said.  \"I have not ridden since I left home.\"  The man's reply, whatever it might have been, was interrupted by Abdul, who, all smiles, stood before them, with the white pigeon in the left hand and the _shahin_ upon his right fist.  The native had no intention of causing the white woman pain; in fact, wishing to find favour in the eyes of the nobles, he only wanted to give them a chance of witnessing a little of, to him, the finest sport in the world.  \"Look, lady!\" he cried.  He tossed the pigeon high into the air, allowed her a little distance, then threw the hawk.  \"No!  Oh, no! don't!\" cried Damaris, as the hawk rose, \"stooped\" and missed the pigeon by a hair's-breadth as it \"put in\", which means that it flew straight into a small niche of a minaret for cover.  \"Ah!\" cried Damaris, and \"_Bi-sma-llah_!\" ejaculated Abdul, as he threw the lure of a dead plover and called his hawk with the luring Eastern call.  \"Coo-coo,\" he called; \"coo-coo,\" to which the hawk responded as a well-trained _shahin_ should.  Hugh Carden Ali stood with his hand on the stallion's mane, looking up at the sky, in which shone a great star.  \"The hawk of Egypt failed,\" he said to himself.  \"Flown at a white bird, it failed.  The House of Allah, who is God, gave sanctuary to the little white bird.  Praise be to Allah who is God.\"  He looked down at the girl, who was kneeling, consoling the dog, who, reft 'tween pride and pain, showed a lamentable countenance.  Suddenly she looked up and rose, and stood silently.  \"Come,\" he said simply, while he longed to pick her up and ride with her to his home in the Oasis.  \"I will take you to your hotel.\"  \"My car is waiting for me in the Sikket el-Gedideh,\" she replied.       *     *     *     *     *  Later, a vision of loveliness, she walked down the dining-room behind the Duchess of Longacres, whilst continuous lamentations were wafted through the spring-doors from the spot where sat a dog with sticking-plaster across his nose and middle girt with a cummerbund of pink boracic lint.  Beside the girl's place lay a huge bunch of crimson roses tied with golden tassels; there was no card, name nor message.  She asked no question, neither did her godmother.  To what purpose should they?  The one _knew_; the other firmly believed in allowing the young to work out the salvation of their own souls; which did not, however, mean that she would not keep a sharp look-out in the future over the troubled sea of Life.  \"I knew something would happen,\" thought the wise old lady, as she passed a biscuit up to the parrot on her shoulder.  \"_Kathir Khairak_,\" it said delightedly.  It merely means \"thank you,\" but had taken weeks of teaching and repeating to master.     CHAPTER III    \"Lor! but women's rum cattle to deal with, the     first man found that to his cost;   And I reckon it's just through a woman, that the     last man on earth'll be lost.\"            G. R. SIMS.   Damaris was the only daughter of Squire Hethencourt.  Her mother was an Italian from the Udino, where the hair of the women is genuine Titian-red and the eyes are blue; which perhaps accounted for her colouring and some part of her temperament.  Her type of beauty was certainly remarkable--given, it must be confessed, to a certain amount of fluctuation--and she danced divinely, which gift must not be counted as a parlour-trick; she was slow in her movements and quiet in her manner until she talked of horses or anybody she loved; then her great eyes would flash and her laugh ring out, also she would gesticulate as her mother had been wont to do, until the climate, maybe, of a northern country had served to repress the spontaneity of her Latin mannerisms.  She was simple and unsophisticated and would have made a splendid little chum, if only one out of every three men who met her had not been consumed with a desire to annex her for life by means of a gold ring.  \"Dads,\" she exclaimed, two months before the beginning of this story, having enticed him to her bedroom one night and offered him cream chocolates as he eat at the foot of her bed, facing her.  \"Dads, what am I to do?  Guy Danvers says he is coming to see you to-morrow, and I--I am sure it will only turn out to be--well--you, know.\"  \"But, Golliwog dear, I'm the one to be pitied.  This makes the--how many is it?\"  \"I don't know, Dads, and it isn't the number; it's the awful _habit_ they've got into--and I don't understand anything and I don't encourage them, do I?  Do lend me a hankie--this chocolate has burst--and what am I to do?\"  \"Turn a deaf ear, or a cold shoulder, or put a brave face on, until------\" said Dads, retrieving his handkerchief.  \"Until what?\"  \"Until the right man comes along, darling, as he surely will.\"  The girl's lids suddenly dropped until the lashes lay like a fringe upon the white cheek over which very slowly but very surely crept the faintest of rose-colours.  \"Hum!\" said Dads to himself, as he made great use of the hankie.  \"Do smoke, dearest!\"  \"No, thank you, pet; I couldn't here.\"  The man who worshipped his wife and adored his little daughter looked round the white and somewhat austere room, and ran his eye over the bookstand at his elbow.  Books on horses, a treatise on bulldogs, the New Testament, essays in French and in German, the History of Egypt in Arabic, Budge's \"Book of the Dead,\" and \"King Solomon's Mines.\"  \"But what am I do _meanwhile_, Dads?\" and the girl threw out her hands imploringly.  \"Be cold, deaf or brave, Golliwog, as I have suggested.\"  \"But I've been all that, and it's quite useless.  Do you think it would help if I let my hair grow and did it up in a tight knob?\"  \"I think it would help a lot if you shaved your head entirely, kiddie.\" And the man leant forward and ran his hand through the red curls.  Once upon a time Damaris had read the advertisement of a certain powder guaranteed to darken hair of any colour, and life having been one long torment owing to her violent colouring, she had, greatly daring, acquired a packet; had followed the directions by mixing the powder with water and covering her head with the muddy result, and, \"to make assurance doubly sure,\" had sat with her clay pate for an hour instead of ten minutes near a fire; had cracked the clay, washed her head, and found her hair grass-green.  She had chopped the verdant masses off without a thought, and had ever after refused to allow it to grow to hairpin length, and to her father only had granted the privilege of calling her by the pet name of Golliwog.  \"Would you like"]]]
