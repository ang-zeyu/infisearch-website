It would be difficult to say there had been a direct word about him.  There were manuals on navigation, seamanship, and ship-building, all of them curiosities, in these later days, rather than expert guides.  They were full of marginal notes, and were not so dusty as I had expected to find them.  The rest of the books were of journeys in Central America and Mexico: _Three Years in Guatemala_; _The Buried Cities of Yucatan_; _Scenes on the Mosquito Coast_; _A Voyage to Honduras_.  There was more of it, and of that sort.  They were by authors long forgotten; but those books, too, looked as though they were often in use.  Certainly they could not be classed with the old glue-pots and the lumber.  It was long after my first visit to Pascoe that he referred to those books.  \"Somebody told me,\" he said one evening, while offering me a share of his beer, \"that you have been to the American tropics.\"  I told him I could say I had been, but little more.  I said it was a very big world.  \"Yes,\" he said, after a pause: \"and what a world.  Think of those buried cities in Yucatan--lost in the forest, temples and gods and everything.  Men and women there, once upon a time, thinking they were a fine people, the only great people, with a king and princesses and priests who made out they knew the mysteries, and what God was up to. And there were processions of girls with fruit and flowers on feast-days, and soldiers in gold armour.  All gone, even their big notions.  Their god hasn't got even a name now.  Have you ever read the _Companions of Columbus_?\"  I was as surprised as though one of his dim bottles in the shadows had suddenly glowed before my eyes, become magical with moving opalescence. What right had old Pascoe to be staring like that to the land and romance of the Toltecs?  I had been under the impression that he read nothing but the Bible and _Progress and Poverty_.  There was a biography of Bradlaugh, too, which he would quote copiously, and his spectacles used fairly to scintillate over that, and his yellow face to acquire a new set of cunning and ironic puckers; for I believe he thought, when he quoted Bradlaugh--whose name was nearly all I knew of that famous man--that he was becoming extremely modern, and a little too strong for my conventional and sensitive mind.  But here he was, telling of Incas, Aztecs, and Toltecs, of buried cities, of forgotten treasures, though mainly of the mind, of Montezuma, of the quetzal bird, and of the vanished splendour of nations that are now but a few weathered stones.  It was the forlorn stones, lost in an uninhabited wilderness, to which he constantly returned.  A brother of his, who had been there, perhaps had dropped a word once into Pascoe's ear while his accustomed weapon was uplifted over a dock-labourer's boot-heel, and this was what that word had done.  Pascoe, with a sort of symbolic gesture, rose from his bobbing foot before me, tore the shoe from it, flung it contemptuously on the floor, and approached me with a flamboyant hammer.  And that evening I feared for a moment that Pascoe was spoiled for me. He had admitted me to a close view of some secret treasured charms of his memory, and believing that I was not uninterested, now, of course, he would be always displaying, for the ease of his soul, supposing we had a fellowship and a bond, his fascinating quetzals and Toltecs.  Yet I never heard any more about them.  There was another subject though, quite homely, seeing where we both lived, and equally absorbing for us both.  He knew our local history, as far as our ships and house-flags were concerned, from John Company's fleet to the _Macquarie_.  He knew, by reputation, many of our contemporary master mariners.  He knew, and how he had learned it was as great a wonder as though he spoke Chinese, a fair measure of naval architecture.  He could discuss ships' models as some men would Greek drama.  He would enter into the comparative merits of rig suitable for small cruising craft with a particularity which, now and then, gave me a feeling almost akin to alarm; because in a man of Pascoe's years this fond insistence on the best furniture for one's own little ship went beyond fair interest, and became the day-dreaming of romantic and rebellious youth.  At that point he was beyond my depth.  I had forgotten long ago, though but half Pascoe's age, what my ship was to be like, when I got her at last.  Knowing she would never be seen at her moorings, I had, in a manner of speaking, posted her as a missing ship.  One day I met at his door the barge-builder into whose cavernous loft I had stumbled on my first visit to Pascoe.  He said it was a fine afternoon.  He invited me in to inspect a figure-head he had purchased. \"How's the old 'un?\" he asked, jerking a thumb towards the bootmaker's. Then, with some amused winking and crafty tilting of his chin, he signed to me to follow him along his loft.  He led me clean through the port-light of his cave, and down a length of steps outside to his yard on the foreshore of the Thames, where, among his barges hauled up for repairs, he paused by a formless shape covered by tarpaulins.  \"I've seen a few things in the way of boats, but this 'ere's a--well, what do you make of it?\"  He pulled the tarpaulin back, and disclosed a vessel whose hull was nearing completion.  I did not ask if it was Pascoe's work.  It was such an amusing and pathetic surprise, that, with the barge-builder's leering face turned to me waiting for my guess, there was no need to answer.  \"He reckons,\" said the barge-builder, \"that he can do a bit of cruising about the mouth of the Thames in that.  'Bout all she wants now is to have a mast fitted, and to keep the water out, and she'll do.\"  He chuckled grimly.  Her lines were crude, and she had been built up, you could see, as Pascoe came across timber that was anywhere near being possible.  Her strakes were a patchwork of various kinds of wood, though when she was tarred their diversity would be hidden from all but the searching of the elements. It was astonishing that Pascoe had done so well.  It was still more astonishing that he should think it would serve.  \"I've given him a hand with it,\" remarked the barge-builder, \"an' more advice than the old 'un 'ud take.  But I dessay 'e could potter about with the dam' tub round about as far as Canvey, if 'e keeps it out of the wash of the steamers.  He's been at this job two years now, and I shan't be sorry to see my yard shut of it. . . .  Must humour the old boy, though. . . . Nigglin' job, mending boots, I reckon.  If I mended boots, I'd 'ave to let orf steam summow.  Or go on the booze.\"  I felt hurt that Pascoe had not taken me into his confidence, and that his ship, so far as I was concerned, did not exist.  One Saturday evening, when I called, his room was in darkness.  Striking a match, there was his apron shrouding his hobbing foot.  This had never happened before, and I turned into the barge-builder's.  The proprietor there faced me silently for a moment, treasuring a jest he was going to give me when I was sufficiently impatient for it.  \"Come to see whether your boots are done?  Well, they ain't.  Pascoe's gone.  Christened his boat this morning, and pushed off.  Gone for a trial trip.  Gone down river.\"  \"Good Lord,\" I said, or something of the sort.  \"Yes,\" continued the barge-builder, luxuriating in it, \"and I've often wondered what name he'd give her, and he done it this morning, in gold leaf.  D'yer remember what she looked like?  All right.  Well, 'er name is the _Heart's Desire_, and her skipper will be back soon, if she don't fall apart too far off.\"  Her skipper was not back soon, nor that day.  We had no news of him the next day.  A few women were in his workshop, when I called, hunting about for footwear that should have been repaired and returned, but was not.  \"'Ere they are,\" cried one.  \"'Ere's young Bill's boots, and nothing done to 'em.  The silly old fool.  Why didn't 'e tell me 'e was going to sea?  'Ow's young Bill to go to school on Monday now?\"  The others found their boots, all urgently wanted, and all as they were when Pascoe got them.  A commination began of light-minded cripples who took in young and innocent boots, promising them all things, and then treacherously abandoned them, to do God knew what; and so I left.  This became serious; for old Pascoe, with his _Heart's Desire_, had vanished, like his Toltecs.  A week went by.  The barge-builder, for whom this had now ceased to be a joke, was vastly troubled by the complete disappearance of his neighbour, and shook his head over it. Then a few lines in an evening paper, from a port on the Devon coast, looked promising, though what they wished to convey was not quite clear, for it was a humorous paragraph.  But the evidence was strong enough for me, and on behalf of the barge-builder and a few others I went at once to that west-coast harbour.  It was late at night when I arrived, and bewildering with rain, total darkness, and an upheaval of cobbles in by-ways that wandered to no known purpose.  But a guide presently brought me to a providential window, and quarters in the _Turk's Head_.  In my room I could hear a continuous murmuring, no doubt from the saloon bar below, and occasional rounds of hearty merriment.  That would be the place for news, and I went down to get it.  An oil-lamp veiled in tobacco smoke was hanging from a beam of a sooty ceiling.  A congregation of longshoremen, visible in the blue mist and smoky light chiefly because of their pink masks, was packed on benches round the walls.  They laughed aloud again as I went in.  They were regarding with indulgent interest and a little shy respect an elegant figure overlooking them, and posed negligently against the bar, on the other side of which rested the large bust of a laughing barmaid.  She was as amused as the men.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15167"],["title","London River (#8)"],["body","figure turned to me as I entered, and stopped its discourse at once.  It ran a hand over its white brow and curly hair with a gesture of mock despair.  \"Why, here comes another to share our _Hearts Desire_.  We can't keep the beauty to ourselves.\"  It was young Hopkins, known to every reader of the _Morning Despatch_ for his volatility and omniscience.  It was certainly not his business to allow any place to keep its secrets to itself; indeed, his reputation including even a capacity for humour, the world was frequently delighted with more than the place itself knew even in secret.  Other correspondents from London were also in the room.  I saw them vaguely when Hopkins indicated their positions with a few graceful flourishes of his hand.  They were lost in Hopkins's assurance of occupying superiority.  They were looking on.  \"We all got here yesterday,\" explained Hopkins.  \"It's a fine story, not without its funny touches.  And it has come jolly handy in a dull season when people want cheering up.  We have found the Ancient Mariner.  He was off voyaging again but his ship's magic was washed out by heavy weather.  And while beer is more plentiful than news, we hope to keep London going with some wonders of the deep.\"  In the morning, before the correspondents had begun on the next instalment of their serial story, I saw Pascoe sitting up in a bed at another inn, his expenses an investment of the newspaper men.  He was unsubdued.  He was even exalted.  He did not think it strange to see me there, though it was not difficult to guess that he had his doubts about the quality of the publicity he had attracted, and of the motive for the ardent attentions of his new and strange acquaintances from London.  \"Don't be hard on me,\" he begged, \"for not telling you more in London.  But you're so cautious and distrustful.  I was going to tell you, but was uncertain what you'd say.  Now I've started and you can't stop me.  I've met a man here named Hopkins, who has given me some help and advice.  As soon as my craft is repaired, I'm off again.  It was unlucky to meet that sou'wester in July.  But once out of home waters, I ought to be able to pick up the Portuguese trade wind off Finisterre, and then I'm good for the Caribbees.  I'll do it.  She should take no more than a fortnight to put right.\"  There was no need to argue with him.  The _Heart's Desire_, a centre of attraction in the place, answered any doubt I had as to Pascoe's safety.  But he was humoured.  Hopkins humoured him, even openly encouraged him.  The Heart's Desire was destined for a great adventure. The world was kept in anticipation of the second departure for this strange voyage to Guatemala.  The _Heart's Desire_ on the edge of a ship-repairer's yard, was tinkered, patched, refitted, made as right as she could be.  The ship-repairer, the money for the work made certain for him, did what he was told, but made no comment, except to interrogate me curiously when I was about.  A spring tide, with a southerly wind, brought us to a natural conclusion.  An unexpected lift of the water washed off the _Heart's Desire_, rolled her about, and left her broken on the mud.  I met the journalists in a group on their way to the afternoon train, their faces still reflecting the brightness of an excellent entertainment.  Hopkins took me aside.  \"I've made it right with old Pascoe.  He hasn't lost anything by it, you can be sure of that.\"  But I was looking for the cobbler, and all I wished to learn was the place where I was likely to find him.  They did not know that.  Late that evening I was still looking for him, and it had been raining for hours.  The streets of the village were dark and deserted.  Passing one of the many inns, which were the only illumination of the village, I stumbled over a shadow on the cobbles outside.  In the glow of a match I found Pascoe, drunk, with his necessary stick beside him, broken.     V. The Master  This master of a ship I remember first as a slim lad, with a shy smile, and large hands that were lonely beyond his outgrown reefer jacket. His cap was always too small for him, and the soiled frontal badge of his line became a coloured button beyond his forelock.  He used to come home occasionally--and it was always when we were on the point of forgetting him altogether.  He came with a huge bolster in a cab, as though out of the past and nowhere.  There is a tradition, a book tradition, that the boy apprenticed to the sea acquires saucy eyes, and a self-reliance always ready to dare to that bleak extreme the very thought of which horrifies those who are lawful and cautious.  They know better who live where the ships are.  He used to bring his young shipmates to see us, and they were like himself.  Their eyes were downcast.  They showed no self-reliance.  Their shyness and politeness, when the occasion was quite simple, were absurdly incommensurate even with modesty.  Their sisters, not nearly so polite, used to mock them.  As our own shy lad was never with us for long, his departure being as abrupt and unannounced as his appearance, we could willingly endure him.  But he was extraneous to the household.  He had the impeding nature of a new and superfluous piece of furniture which is in the way, yet never knows it, and placidly stays where it is, in its wooden manner, till it is placed elsewhere.  There was a morning when, as he was leaving the house, during one of his brief visits to his home, I noticed to my astonishment that he had grown taller than myself.  How had that happened?  And where?  I had followed him to the door that morning because, looking down at his cap which he was nervously handling, he had told me he was going then to an examination.  About a week later he announced, in a casual way, that he had got his masters ticket.  After the first shock of surprise, caused by the fact that this information was an unexpected warning of our advance in years, we were amused, and we congratulated him.  Naturally he had got his certificate as master mariner.  Why not?  Nearly all the mates we knew got it, sooner or later.  That was bound to come.  But very soon after that he gave us a genuine surprise, and made us anxious.  He informed us, as casually, that he had been appointed master to a ship; a very different matter from merely possessing the licence to command.  We were even alarmed.  This was serious.  He could not do it.  He was not the man to make a command for anything.  A fellow who, not so long ago, used to walk a mile with a telegram because he had not the strength of character to face the lady clerk in the post office round the corner, was hardly the man to overawe a crowd of hard characters gathered by chance from Tower Hill, socialize them, and direct them successfully in subduing the conflicting elements of a difficult enterprise.  Not he.  But we said nothing to discourage him.  Of course, he was a delightful fellow.  He often amused us, and he did not always know why.  He was frank, he was gentle, but that large vacancy, the sea, where he had spent most of his young life, had made him--well, slow.  You know what I mean.  He was curiously innocent of those dangers of great cities which are nothing to us because we know they are there.  Yet he was always on the alert for thieves and parasites.  I think he enjoyed his belief in their crafty omnipresence ashore.  Proud of his alert and knowing intelligence, he would relate a long story of the way he had not only frustrated an artful shark, but had enjoyed the process in perfect safety.  That we, who rarely went out of London, never had such adventures, did not strike him as worth a thought or two.  He never paused in his merriment to consider the strange fact that to him, alone of our household, such wayside adventures fell.  With a shrewd air he would inform us that he was about to put the savings of a voyage into an advertised trap which a country parson would have stepped over without a second contemptuous glance,  He took his ship away.  The affair was not discussed at home, though each of us gave it some private despondency.  We followed him silently, apprehensively, through the reports in the _Shipping Gazette_.  He made point after point safely--St. Vincent, Gibraltar, Suez, Aden--after him we went across to Colombo, Singapore, and at length we learned that he was safe at Batavia.  He had got that steamer out all right.  He got her home again, too.  After his first adventure as master he made voyage after voyage with no more excitement in them than you would find in Sunday walks in a suburb.  It was plain luck; or else navigation and seamanship were greatly overrated arts.  A day came when he invited me to go with him part of his voyage.  I could leave the ship at Bordeaux.  I went.  You must remember that we had never seen his ship.  And there he was, walking with me to the dock from a Welsh railway station, a man in a cheap mackintosh, with an umbrella I will not describe, and he was carrying a brown paper parcel. He was appropriately crowned with a bowler hat several sizes too small for him.  Glancing up at his profile, I actually wondered whether the turmoil was now going on in his mind over that confession which now he was bound to make; that he was not the master of a ship, and never had been.  There she was, a bulky modern freighter, full of derricks and time-saving appliances, and her funnel lording it over the neighbourhood.  The man with the parcel under his arm led me up the gangway.  I was not yet convinced.  I was, indeed, less sure than ever that he could be the master of this huge community of engines and men. He did not accord with it.  We were no sooner on deck than a man in uniform, grey-haired, with a seamed and resolute face, which any one would have recognized at once as a sailor's, approached us.  He was introduced as the chief officer. He had a tale of woe: trouble with the dockmaster, with the stevedores, with the cargo, with many"]]]
