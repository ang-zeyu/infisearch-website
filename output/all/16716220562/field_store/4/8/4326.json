Then Myles told his side of the case, the old knight listening attentively.  “Why, how now, Blunt,” said Sir James, when Myles had ended, “I myself gave the lads leave to go to the river to bathe. Wherefore shouldst thou forbid one of them?”  “I did it but to punish this fellow for his mutiny,” said the bachelor. “Methought we at their head were to have oversight concerning them.”  “So ye are,” said the knight; “but only to a degree. Ere ye take it upon ye to gainsay any of my orders or permits, come ye first to me. Dost thou understand?”  “Aye,” answered Blunt, sullenly.  “So be it, and now get thee gone,” said the knight; “and let me hear no more of beating out brains with wooden clogs. An ye fight your battles, let there not be murder in them. This is twice that the like hath happed; gin I hear more of such doings--” He did utter his threat, but stopped short, and fixed his one eye sternly upon the head squire. “Now shake hands, and be ye friends,” said he, abruptly.  Blunt made a motion to obey, but Myles put his hand behind him.  “Nay, I shake not hands with any one who struck me while I was down.”  “So be it,” said the knight, grimly. “Now thou mayst go, Blunt. Thou, Falworth, stay; I would bespeak thee further.”  “Tell me,” said he, when the elder lad had left them, “why wilt thou not serve these bachelors as the other squires do? Such is the custom here. Why wilt thou not obey it?”  “Because,” said Myles, “I cannot stomach it, and they shall not make me serve them. An thou bid me do it, sir, I will do it; but not at their command.”  “Nay,” said the knight, “I do not bid thee do them service. That lieth with thee, to render or not, as thou seest fit. But how canst thou hope to fight single-handed against the commands of a dozen lads all older and mightier than thou?”  “I know not,” said Myles; “but were they an hundred, instead of thirteen, they should not make me serve them.”  “Thou art a fool!” said the old knight, smiling faintly, “for that be'st not courage, but folly. When one setteth about righting a wrong, one driveth not full head against it, for in so doing one getteth naught but hard knocks. Nay, go deftly about it, and then, when the time is ripe, strike the blow. Now our beloved King Henry, when he was the Earl of Derby, what could he have gained had he stood so against the old King Richard, brooking the King face to face? I tell thee he would have been knocked on the head as thou wert like to have been this day. Now were I thee, and had to fight a fight against odds, I would first get me friends behind me, and then--” He stopped short, but Myles understood him well enough.  “Sir,” said he, with a gulp, “I do thank thee for thy friendship, and ask thy pardon for doing as I did anon.”  “I grant thee pardon,” said the knight, “but tell thee plainly, an thou dost face me so again, I will truly send thee to the black cell for a week. Now get thee away.”  All the other lads were gone when Myles came forth, save only the faithful Gascoyne, who sacrificed his bath that day to stay with his friend; and perhaps that little act of self-denial moved Myles more than many a great thing might have done.  “It was right kind of thee, Francis,” said he, laying his hand affectionately on his friend's shoulder. “I know not why thou lovest me so.”  “Why, for one thing, this matter,” answered his friend; “because methinks thou art the best fighter and the bravest one of all of us squires.”  Myles laughed. Nevertheless Gascoyne's words were a soothing balm for much that had happened that day. “I will fight me no more just now,”  said he; and then he told his friend all that Sir James had advised about biding his time.  Gascoyne blew a long whistle. “Beshrew me!” quoth he, “but methinks old Bruin is on thy side of the quarrel, Myles. An that be so, I am with thee also, and others that I can name as well.”  “So be it,” said Myles. “Then am I content to abide the time when we may become strong enough to stand against them.”    CHAPTER 10  Perhaps there is nothing more delightful in the romance of boyhood than the finding of some secret hiding-place whither a body may creep away from the bustle of the world's life, to nestle in quietness for an hour or two. More especially is such delightful if it happen that, by peeping from out it, one may look down upon the bustling matters of busy every-day life, while one lies snugly hidden away unseen by any, as though one were in some strange invisible world of one's own.  Such a hiding-place as would have filled the heart of almost any boy with sweet delight Myles and Gascoyne found one summer afternoon. They called it their Eyry, and the name suited well for the roosting-place of the young hawks that rested in its windy stillness, looking down upon the shifting castle life in the courts below.  Behind the north stable, a great, long, rambling building, thick-walled, and black with age, lay an older part of the castle than that peopled by the better class of life--a cluster of great thick walls, rudely but strongly built, now the dwelling-place of stable-lads and hinds, swine and poultry. From one part of these ancient walls, and fronting an inner court of the castle, arose a tall, circular, heavy-buttressed tower, considerably higher than the other buildings, and so mantled with a dense growth of aged ivy as to stand a shaft of solid green. Above its crumbling crown circled hundreds of pigeons, white and pied, clapping and clattering in noisy flight through the sunny air. Several windows, some closed with shutters, peeped here and there from out the leaves, and near the top of the pile was a row of arched openings, as though of a balcony or an airy gallery.  Myles had more than once felt an idle curiosity about this tower, and one day, as he and Gascoyne sat together, he pointed his finger and said, “What is yon place?”  “That,” answered Gascoyne, looking over his shoulder--“that they call Brutus Tower, for why they do say that Brutus he built it when he came hither to Britain. I believe not the tale mine own self; ne'theless, it is marvellous ancient, and old Robin-the-Fletcher telleth me that there be stairways built in the wall and passage-ways, and a maze wherein a body may get lost, an he know not the way aright, and never see the blessed light of day again.”  “Marry,” said Myles, “those same be strange sayings. Who liveth there now?”  “No one liveth there,” said Gascoyne, “saving only some of the stable villains, and that half-witted goose-herd who flung stones at us yesterday when we mocked him down in the paddock. He and his wife and those others dwell in the vaults beneath, like rabbits in any warren. No one else hath lived there since Earl Robert's day, which belike was an hundred years agone. The story goeth that Earl Robert's brother--or step-brother--was murdered there, and some men say by the Earl himself. Sin that day it hath been tight shut.”  Myles stared at the tower for a while in silence. “It is a strange-seeming place from without,” said he, at last, “and mayhap it may be even more strange inside. Hast ever been within, Francis?”  “Nay,” said Gascoyne; “said I not it hath been fast locked since Earl Robert's day?”  “By'r Lady,” said Myles, “an I had lived here in this place so long as thou, I wot I would have been within it ere this.”  “Beshrew me,” said Gascoyne, “but I have never thought of such a matter.” He turned and looked at the tall crown rising into the warm sunlight with a new interest, for the thought of entering it smacked pleasantly of adventure. “How wouldst thou set about getting within?”  said he, presently.  “Why, look,” said Myles; “seest thou not yon hole in the ivy branches? Methinks there is a window at that place. An I mistake not, it is in reach of the stable eaves. A body might come up by the fagot pile to the roof of the hen-house, and then by the long stable to the north stable, and so to that hole.”  Gascoyne looked thoughtfully at the Brutus Tower, and then suddenly inquired, “Wouldst go there?”  “Aye,” said Myles, briefly.  “So be it. Lead thou the way in the venture, I will follow after thee,”  said Gascoyne.  As Myles had said, the climbing from roof to roof was a matter easy enough to an active pair of lads like themselves; but when, by-and-by, they reached the wall of the tower itself, they found the hidden window much higher from the roof than they had judged from below--perhaps ten or twelve feet--and it was, besides, beyond the eaves and out of their reach.  Myles looked up and looked down. Above was the bushy thickness of the ivy, the branches as thick as a woman's wrist, knotted and intertwined; below was the stone pavement of a narrow inner court between two of the stable buildings.  “Methinks I can climb to yon place,” said he.  “Thou'lt break thy neck an thou tryest,” said Gascoyne, hastily.  “Nay,” quoth Myles, “I trust not; but break or make, we get not there without trying. So here goeth for the venture.”  “Thou art a hare-brained knave as ever drew breath of life,” quoth Gascoyne, “and will cause me to come to grief some of these fine days. Ne'theless, an thou be Jack Fool and lead the way, go, and I will be Tom Fool and follow anon. If thy neck is worth so little, mine is worth no more.”  It was indeed a perilous climb, but that special providence which guards reckless lads befriended them, as it has thousands of their kind before and since. So, by climbing from one knotted, clinging stem to another, they were presently seated snugly in the ivied niche in the window. It was barred from within by a crumbling shutter, the rusty fastening of which, after some little effort upon the part of the two, gave way, and entering the narrow opening, they found themselves in a small"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15575"],["title","The Tale of Samuel Whiskers; Or, The Roly-Poly Pudding (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original lovely illustrations.

She used to lose her kittens continually, and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!  On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard.  She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom.  Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten. She looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets. She went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere.  It was an old, old house, full of cupboards and passages. Some of the walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside them, as if there might be a little secret staircase. Certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared at night--especially cheese and bacon.  Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted, and mewed dreadfully.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  While their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got into mischief.  The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out.  [Illustration]  They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire.  They patted it with their little soft paws--\"Shall we make dear little muffins?\" said Mittens to Moppet.  [Illustration]  But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright.  [Illustration]  Mittens ran away to the dairy, and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand.  The visitor was a neighbour, Mrs. Ribby; she had called to borrow some yeast.  Mrs. Tabitha came downstairs mewing dreadfully--\"Come in, Cousin Ribby, come in, and sit ye down! I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby,\" said Tabitha, shedding tears. \"I've lost my dear son Thomas; I'm afraid the rats have got him.\" She wiped her eyes with her apron.  \"He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; he made a cat's cradle of my best bonnet last time I came to tea. Where have you looked for him?\"  \"All over the house! The rats are too many for me. What a thing it is to have an unruly family!\" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  \"I'm not afraid of rats; I will help you to find him; and whip him too! What is all that soot in the fender?\"  [Illustration]  \"The chimney wants sweeping--Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby--now Moppet and Mittens are gone!\"  \"They have both got out of the cupboard!\"  [Illustration]  Ribby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again. They poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella, and they rummaged in cupboards. They even fetched a candle, and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics. They could not find anything, but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs.  \"Yes, it is infested with rats,\" said Tabitha tearfully. \"I caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for dinner last Saturday. And once I saw the old father rat--an enormous old rat, Cousin Ribby. I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole.\"  \"The rats get upon my nerves, Cousin Ribby,\" said Tabitha.  [Illustration]  Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched. They both heard a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor. But there was nothing to be seen.  [Illustration]  They returned to the kitchen. \"Here's one of your kittens at least,\" said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel.  They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor. She seemed to be in a terrible fright.  \"Oh! Mother, Mother,\" said Moppet, \"there's been an old woman rat in the kitchen, and she's stolen some of the dough!\"  The two cats ran to look at the dough pan. Sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone!  \"Which way did she go, Moppet?\"  But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again.  Ribby and Tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight, while they went on with their search.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  They went into the dairy. The first thing they found was Mittens, hiding in an empty jar.  [Illustration]  They tipped up the jar, and she scrambled out.  \"Oh, Mother, Mother!\" said Mittens--  [Illustration]  \"Oh! Mother, Mother, there has been an old man rat in the dairy--a dreadful 'normous big rat, mother; and he's stolen a pat of butter and the rolling-pin.\"  Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another.  \"A rolling-pin and butter! Oh, my poor son Thomas!\" exclaimed Tabitha, wringing her paws.  \"A rolling-pin?\" said Ribby. \"Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest?\"  Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs again. Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.  [Illustration]  \"This is serious, Cousin Tabitha,\" said Ribby. \"We must send for John Joiner at once, with a saw.\"         *       *       *       *       *  [Illustration]  Now this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does not know his way, and where there are enormous rats.  Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard. When he saw that his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide.  He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the chimney.  The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks. Tom Kitten got upon the fender and looked up. It was a big old-fashioned fire-place.  The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about. So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  He jumped right up into the fire-place, balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs.  [Illustration]  Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar, and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender.  [Illustration]  Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; and he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fire-place down below. He made up his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try to catch sparrows.  \"I cannot go back. If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket.\"  The chimney was a very big old-fashioned one. It was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.  The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that kept out the rain.  [Illustration]  Tom Kitten was getting very frightened! He climbed up, and up, and up.  [Illustration]  Then he waded sideways through inches of soot. He was like a little sweep himself.  It was most confusing in the dark. One flue seemed to lead into another.  There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost.  He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall. There were some mutton bones lying about--  \"This seems funny,\" said Tom Kitten. \"Who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney? I wish I had never come! And what a funny smell? It is something like mouse; only dreadfully strong. It makes me sneeze,\" said Tom Kitten.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  He squeezed through the hole in the wall, and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light.  [Illustration]  He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the skirting-board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture.  [Illustration]  All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed on a heap of very dirty rags.  When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him--he found himself in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his life in the house.  It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and cobwebs, and lath and plaster.  Opposite to him--as far away as he could sit--was an enormous rat.  \"What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?\" said the rat, chattering his teeth.  [Illustration]  \"Please sir, the chimney wants sweeping,\" said poor Tom Kitten.  [Illustration]  \"Anna Maria! Anna Maria!\" squeaked the rat. There was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.  All in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was happening--  His coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots.  Anna Maria did the tying. The old rat watched her and took snuff. When she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open.  \"Anna Maria,\" said the old man rat (whose name was Samuel Whiskers),--\"Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for my dinner.\"  \"It requires dough and a pat of butter, and a rolling-pin,\" said Anna Maria, considering Tom Kitten with"]]]
