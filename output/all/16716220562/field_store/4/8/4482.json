His heart was of the finest, honest, loving, courageous, capable of hurling its owner to instant battle or death, in defence of the one loved, at other times rendering him, in its gentleness, an almost ludicrous spectacle of adoration.  Of such was Wellington, and if the description is somewhat detailed and technical it is because he happens a good deal into the book.  The duchess had been put into the train for Port Said by Ben Kelham, who, inwardly kicking at her sage advice, looked as despondent as a camel who considers its strength unequal to its burden.  \"Cheer up, lad,\" she cried as the train moved off.  \"Cheer up; something is sure to happen before long.\"  Which was a perfectly safe prophecy to make where Damaris was concerned.  Arrived at Port Said, she put off in a boat with her maid and her parrot, and found her godchild, who did not expect her, on deck, entranced with all she saw.  Yes! of course Port Said is a sink of iniquity and a place of odours and a fold for native wolves in sheep's clothing; also a centre for antiquities made in Birmingham, or by the vendor himself in the hot weather; and a market for things which should not be sold, much less bought.  In fact, in one short sentence, it is a deal of cosmopolitan wrong-doing.  All the same, you need not buy and you need not listen nor look, and if it is the first bit of the Orient you have meet with for the first time in your life, well! it is the East, and jolly exciting and interesting, too.  Damaris rushed at the old lady, and having curtsied to her, gathered her up in her strong arms and hugged her tightly, just as Captain X, who during one trip had had the duchess as passenger and therefore loved her, came along.  As they turned in the direction of the dining-saloon, the girl looked over her shoulder at the two maids, and smiled.  With a great love of their respective mistresses as their sole bond in common they stood, otherwise divided, staring at each other.  \"Pleased to meet you again,\" volunteered country-bred Jane, offering a plump hand.  \"Hoping you are in good health,\" responded Maria Hobson, making a corner in strawberry-leaves as she just touched the finger-tips.  \"Wellington, you have met Dekko, I think,\" laughed the girl.  \"Woomph!\" grunted the dog disdainfully, as he cocked an eye at the bird, which ruffled its feathers, spread its red tail and looked down sideways and spitefully for a long moment.  \"My Gawd!\" it suddenly shrieked.  \"My Gawd!\"  And it swung about and rubbed its soft grey pate against its mistress's outrageous golden perruque, then hurled itself onto the captain's shoulder.     CHAPTER V.    \"_Oh, yet we trust that somehow good   Will be the final goal of ill_.\"            TENNYSON.   After the fight in the bazaar, the ducal party stayed for another fortnight in Cairo, during which time Damaris saw as much of the place and its surroundings as she could in fourteen days and a few hours out of each of the fourteen nights; whilst her godmother played bridge or poker, paid and received visits, took her to dances and parties, and busied her fingers in the tangled threads Fate had tossed into her lap.  It was an understood thing that the girl should be ready to conduct the old aristocrat to the dining-room at the dinner-hour and give her the evening; other than that her time was her own, though, owing to her innate courtesy and her love for her godmother, she never once absented herself without having obtained permission.  \"You are a positive tonic, child, in these perplexing days,\" remarked her grace, when the girl had concluded the recital of the fight in the bazaar.  \"Only, do remember to come straight to me if ever you get into a real scrape.\"  And that night, the old lady, who had lost heavily at poker, fairly snapped at Maria Hobson, who, tucking her up in bed, remarked, greatly daring, upon the amount of liberty allowed the child.  \"Don't be foolish, my good woman,\" she said, \"and do for goodness' sake mind your business of looking after me.  Although my god-daughter may bluff a bit for the fun of the game, and get let down a bit for her own good, yet I shouldn't advise anyone to get seeing her too often.  Fate dealt her a royal straight flush in hearts, and better that you can't--no! not even if you hold a full house of intrigue and bad intent t'other end of Life's table.\"  \"Humff!\" replied the maid heavily through her nose, not having understood one word of her mistress's admonition.  Each day at breakfast and at dinner a bunch, big or little, of simple or hothouse flowers lay beside the girl's plate, without name or message.  Now, the finding of flowers upon your table does not, in Egypt, necessarily imply that the donor thereof is a son of the desert; the maître d'hôtel has been known to do it out of deference to your rank or purse; and only once had Jane Coop had the mixed pleasure of meeting the deaf-mute Nubian who daily left the posies at the hotel.  Refreshed from her siesta, she had descended to the hall _via_ the stairs instead of the lift, and bumped into the ebony-hued slave as he bent to lay a sheaf of flowers upon the matting outside her mistress's door.  He had straightened himself and salaamed almost to the ground--which had delighted Jane Coop--and had offered the bunch to her.  \"Oh, no, my man!\" she had said, bridling, \"you don't come over me that way.  Just you take that trash back to where it came from.  My young lady ain't that kind,\" and had shaken her fist in his face and flounced downstairs to lay a complaint.  What with the militant maids, the parrot and the dog, the ducal party was continually breaking out in some direction or another, but the maître d'hôtel, who simply worshipped the old lady, merely smiled and poured the oil of soothing words upon the troubled waters.  The girl had quite casually recounted the fight in the bazaar, and the wise old woman had made no comment; but, all the same, next day she indifferently asked a few questions of Lady Thistleton, who had a big heart, narrow mind, an ever-wagging tongue and two daughters.  \"Oh, that's the son of the Arab and the English girl.  You must remember the fuse there was in England over the runaway marriage--what was her name?--how she could, you know----\"  \"Ah! yes.  You must be talking of Jill Carden.  I knew her very well. Naughty girl, she refused the invitation I sent them asking them to come to England and stay with me, and gave up writing to me after a while.  Does she live in Cairo?\"  It seemed that Jill, the wife of the Sheikh el-Umbar, lived in the Flat Oasis t'other side of the Canal, in Arabia proper, but, according to current gossip, was at the moment upon a visit to her son at the House 'an Mahabbha, which had been built for the elder branch of the House el-Umbar on a verdant patch watered by the springs, from the limestone hills which stretch on the desert side of the Oasis of Khargegh.  \"He's not in Cairo, then?\"  \"No; he left to-day,\" replied the gossip.  \"You see, his mother is expected any time at his home, if she isn't already there.  My maid will chatter so, there's absolutely no stopping her.  Funnily enough, I arrived at the station as he was leaving in a special train.  Such a handsome man, educated in England, millionaire too.  Of course it's a case of a touch of the tarbrush--such a pity, too!\"  The duchess suddenly shivered.  \"Little Jill!\" she said gently.  \"Little Jill!  I must go and see her if she will let me.  Ah!  General, what about a hand at écarté before dinner?\"--and she rose with a stormy rustling of her softly-scented silks, leaving the gossip wondering in what way she had put her foot in it.  That night, as she lay like a little brown mouse under the mosquito-net, watching the stars through the open window, the old lady suddenly decided to bestir herself.  \"It's too risky!  She's too beautiful, too young and unsophisticated,\" she murmured as she lit a cigarette under the curtains, which is strictly against the rules.  \"I'd bet my last _piastre_ that Jill Carden's son's all right, but, all the same, one has to reckon with the glamour of the East.  Love's all very well in a cool climate, but it's the dickens out here.  Must get her anchored in safe waters.  What d'you think, Dekko old friend?  What course shall I set?  Shall we go home, or to Heliopolis?\"  The bird scrambled awkwardly on to the dressing-table.  \"Well, old man, how about it?\"  \"Steer a straight course for hell, old dear,\" came the muffled reply, as the bird twisted its head under its wing, then untucked it to murmur sleepily: \"T'hell!\"  So she made up her mind to move on the very day after the girl's birthday, which fell in a fortnights time.  She would, indeed, have left at once if it had not been that she had issued invitations on a gigantic scale for a fancy-dress ball in honour of the anniversary.  Inwardly Damaris rebelled at the suggestion of moving on to Heliopolis; outwardly she acquiesced without enthusiasm.  \"But if it will do that nasty little cough good, dearest, why wait for the ball?\"  \"Do you want to go, Maris?\"  \"The desert will be so near,\" evaded the girl.  \"Half-an-hour's ride at the most, so--so Ben Kelham told me, and there you see the desert, miles upon miles of it stretching right away like the sea.\"  The hawk-eyes flashed across the girl's face, taking in the forced indifference of the expression and the light which gleamed far down in the eyes.  \"I had a letter from Ben this morning.  His lung has been troubling him; that is why he hasn't been over.\"  \"Did you--has it--is it--?\" rather lamely replied the girl.  He had written Damaris a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15721"],["title","The Hawk of Egypt (#6)"],["body","note of welcome to the Land of the Pharaohs; then, a week later, had come over to dine.  He had ached to take his beautiful little chum up in his arms and shake her for her haughtiness and by sheer strength of arms and will force her to say \"yes\" to the question which it took him all his strength not to ask.  Since childhood he had been her slave, her door-mat, and the butt of her various moods, feeling infinitely well rewarded by a careless smile or word; so that he found it difficult, in fact well-nigh impossible, to act up to her grace's plans and suddenly transpose himself into the strong, silent man.  The girl, spoilt and accustomed to slavish devotion and used to his worship, felt incensed, then hurt, and finally perplexed, and, to hide it all, retired therewith into a shell of icy reserve.  He had adored her openly, and now, seemingly, looked upon her as just one of the crowd of women in the hotel; she had taken his adoration for granted and as a right, to waken one morning to find the gem she had tossed in amongst the rubbish of her little experiences, gone!  Is there a greater mistake in the world than that of looking upon love as an ordinary possession, instead of as a rare jewel?  They were both very young, so that they suffered the agonies of doubt and uncertainty, whilst the worldly-wise old dame smiled up her sleeve.  From the hour of the early cup of tea until breakfast-time on the morning of the ball, which was also the girl's birthday morning, tarbusched, impudent young monkeys of messenger boys, bearing gifts and flowers, arrived in a stream at the hotel.  Flowers in pots and vases and bunches lay everywhere in the suite; shawls of many colours, silken veils, slippers, albums of views of Egypt, rare antiques (made mostly in Birmingham), one mummied cat (genuine), scarabs (suspicious), and one live gazelle littered the place.  Ben Kelham had bought her a finger-napkin ring of dull gold; through it he had forced some flowers, and sent it along.  She held it tight in her hand for a moment, then deliberately and ostentatiously laid it amongst the clutter on the table, whilst her grace peeped from behind the newspaper which she was reading in bed.  Arrived at the table in the breakfast-room, the girl suddenly flushed pink and then went quite white.  Right in the centre, flanked on one side by the glass dish of glowing fruit and the other by a cut-glass jar of Keiller's marmalade, stood a cage tied at the top with silver ribbon and containing two cooing doves.  The doves were just ordinary ones, but their prison was no ordinary cage.  Fair-sized and square, it was made of fine white bars of ivory. The underside was also ivory, square and unblemished, and would have made an ideal hairpin-tray; it stood upon ebony feet inlaid with infinitesimal precious stones.  \"It has but just arrived, Miss Hethencourt,\" said the maître d'hôtel, who had been fluttering around upon the tiptoe of a most unusual curiosity.  \"There is no name, no message.\"  \"Please send it to my room,\" she replied indifferently, whilst, for some unaccountable reason, her heart throbbed as she responded to the birthday greetings which came from every corner of the room.     CHAPTER VI    \"_A mother is a mother still,   The holiest thing alive_.\"            COLERIDGE.   \"May the blessing of Allah who is God be upon thee, O woman!\"  The sonorous words, of the benediction rang through the room as Hugh Carden Ali stood with the silken curtain drawn back in one hand and the right raised in blessing upon his mother, who stood with arms outstretched in the centre of the room.  Then he knelt to receive the benison of the woman he loved, smiled when he felt the small hands upon his head and, leaping to his feet, swung her up into his arms, covering her face with kisses.  \"You beautiful darling!\" he said, as he crushed her up, to the derangement of her perfumed silks and satins and many jewels.  \"It's just heavenly coming back to you, you dear, understanding mother.\"  The woman's heart leapt to battle, for in the last words, in the way her beloved son looked down upon her in the tone of his voice, she knew that, somewhere out in the world, he had received a hurt.  She knew so little of him, had only had him for such a little, little while under the influence of her love and in the shelter of her heart, and she loved him, her firstborn, with a love beyond words.  Thinking to do the best for him, and making the biggest mistake of all, beating down her beloved husband's opposition, she had sent the boy to England, and in the subsequent eight years had only seen him twice.  \"He is of the East, Woman of my Heart!  Behold, I have studied him,\" had said the Sheikh, all those years ago.  \"Let him be, else evil may befall him.\"  But Jill, his beautiful wife, had insisted, and his love for her being beyond telling, the great Arab had submitted to her wish.  For so it had been written.  And what can be the outcome of the tragic mixing of blood?  Nothing but pain.  \"Come to the roof and talk, Mother, under the stars.\"  So up the marble staircase, with his arm about her waist, to the roof they went, where the silken awnings lay folded and the scented white flowers hung asleep.  They stood under the canopy of purple night studded with flashing, silvery points, as the soft winds carried to them the notes of a guitar softly thrummed in the shade of the palms.  \"It is Mary, dear,\" happily whispered the woman.  \"She came with me to welcome you.\"  And then she clasped her hands at the blaze of anger which swept the man's face.  \"Most gracious Mother, I am master of my house, and, save for your ever-esteemed, ever-desired presence, I cannot have woman set foot in it without my consent.  When I have the desire for one as wife, plaything or servant, then I will give orders.\"  \"But, Hugh, Mary is your sister!\"  \"Mary is my sister, and I do not deem it wise or seemly that she should run about the country at her own wish or whim.\"  \"But, Hugh,------\"  \"Dear, let me speak.  I saw so much of woman in Europe that the yashmak, the barku, the seclusion and modesty of the East have become dear to me above all else.  Have you forgotten, dear, the restaurants, the theatres, the parks and, Allah! the streets?  The half-stripped bodies, the craving for excitement, the wine, the nights turned into day!  Why, one has but to stretch the hand, for flowers to be laid therein; the feet trip at every step with the trap of woman's hair; the quarry stands waiting for the arrow; there is not even the incentive of the chase, the hot pursuit, the lust of the kill.  I speak as my father's son, and in my house I will have privacy and seclusion and seemliness.  Women shall be brought to me when I desire their presence.\"  And the steeliness of the voice brought the woman up-sitting as he gave her an order cloaked in the guise of a favour begged.  \"And I shall be glad if you will ask my sister to keep within the women's quarters until I send for her.\"  \"But----\"  And she ripped the corner of her veil between perturbed fingers when, upon the clapping of hands, a slave ran swiftly to learn his master's pleasure, then hastened away to find the head body-woman of the guesthouse assigned to women-visitors.  After which the sweet thrumming of the guitar instantly stopped.  On more than one night they talked under the stars, sitting on satin cushions, or leaning on the marble fret-work of the balustrade looking due east to where, so many miles away, flows the blue-green Nile, as it has flowed through the centuries, all unheeding of the passing of mighty kingdoms.  And yet had the mother learned nothing of the hurt reflected in her firstborn's eyes.  \"Most precious Mother,\" he was saying, as he stood flicking the pages of the latest illustrated paper just arrived from Cairo, but which was really a volume of the Book of Life written, printed and published by Fate.  \"If it pleases you to stay when I am gone, will you do so just as long as you find happiness in my dwelling?\"  \"You are going, Hugh,--so soon--for long?\"  \"There has come a report of lion in the Nubian Desert, as far north as Deir el-Bahari.  I can hardly believe it, for it is years and years since a lion has been seen even in the Khor Baraka.  However, a runner from Nubia came in this morning, so there may be something in it.  God grant it, for the sport and the danger would be great, killing or being killed, in the rocks and ruins of the Temple.  Also I could visit my Tents of Purple and of Gold.  How long shall I be gone, sweet Mother? That is known only to Allah, to whom our goings and our comings are as the drifting of the sands.\"  \"Your tents are very beautiful, my son.  The servants are waiting for your orders before pitching the--the--middle one.  Without asking permission, I went to inspect them.  Just before your return, just to see if everything was quite all right.  One can never quite trust the servants.\"  Jill might have been sitting on a rectory lawn, talking about her linen-cupboard or spring-cleaning with a neighbour, instead of one of the wonders of modern Egypt.  In fact, so quaint was it that the man laughed and swung her onto the balustrade.  \"I'm not surprised Father worships the ground your ridiculous little feet tread on, Mater,\" he said, causing his mother to gasp, so English did he sound, so Oriental did he look.  \"Dear!\" she said gently, as she scrutinised him with a mother's eyes and touched his face and patted his cheek and pulled a bit here and there at his fine white linen coat, upon which in coarse thread was embroidered the Hawk of Old Egypt.  \"Dear! don't you think you would be happier if you were to marry and--settle down?\"  And it was then that there came to her the full explanation of the hurt reflected in her firstborn's eyes.  \"I shall never marry, dear,\" very gently replied the man, so fearful was he of causing pain to the woman who had borne him.  \"I--I--you see, I cannot.\"  \"Cannot, Hugh?  But, my "]]]
