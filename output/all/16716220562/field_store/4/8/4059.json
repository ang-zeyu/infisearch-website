After many years, however, a traveler lying under the trees heard them whispering to each other.  \"Baucis,\" whispered the oak.  \"Philemon,\" replied the linden.  There the trees stood through sun and rain, always ready to spread their leafy shade over every tired stranger who passed that way.  --FLORA J. COOKE.     THE POPLAR TREE   Long ago the poplar used to hold out its branches like other trees. It tried to see how far it could spread them.  Once at sunset an old man came through the forest where the poplar trees lived. The trees were going to sleep, and it was growing dark.  The man held something under his cloak. It was a pot of gold--the very pot of gold that lies at the foot of the rainbow. He had stolen it and was looking for some place to hide it. A poplar tree stood by the path.  \"This is the very place to hide my treasure,\" the man said. \"The branches spread out straight, and the leaves are large and thick. How lucky that the trees are all asleep!\"  He placed the pot of gold in the thick branches, and then ran quickly away.  The gold belonged to Iris, the beautiful maiden who had a rainbow bridge to the earth. The next morning she missed her precious pot. It always lay at the foot of the rainbow, but it was not there now.  Iris hurried away to tell her father, the great Zeus, of her loss. He said that he would find the pot of gold for her.  He called a messenger, the swift-footed Mercury, and said, \"Go quickly, and do not return until you have found the treasure.\"  Mercury went as fast as the wind down to the earth. He soon came to the forest and awakened the trees.  \"Iris has lost her precious pot of gold that lies at the foot of the rainbow. Have any of you seen it?\" he asked.  The trees were very sleepy, but all shook their heads.  \"We have not seen it,\" they said.  \"Hold up your branches,\" said Mercury. \"I must see that the pot of gold is not hidden among them.\"  All of the trees held up their branches. The poplar that stood by the path was the first to hold up his. He was an honest tree and knew he had nothing to hide.  [Illustration: Mercury among the trees]  Down fell the pot of gold. How surprised the poplar tree was! He dropped his branches in shame. Then he held them high in the air.  \"Forgive me,\" he said. \"I do not know how it came to be there; but, hereafter, I shall always hold my branches up. Then every one can see that I have nothing hidden.\"  Since then the branches have always grown straight up; and every one knows that the poplar is an honest and upright tree.  --FLORA J. COOKE.     WHO LOVES THE TREES BEST?     Who loves the trees best?   \"I,\" said the Spring;   \"Their leaves so beautiful   To them I bring.\"    Who loves the trees best?   \"I,\" Summer said;   \"I give them blossoms,   White, yellow, red.\"    Who loves the trees best?   \"I,\" said the Fall;   \"I give luscious fruits,   Bright tints to all.\"    Who loves the trees best?   \"I love them best,\"   Harsh Winter answered;   \"I give them rest.\"  --ALICE MAY DOUGLAS.     LEAVES IN AUTUMN     Red and gold, and gold and red,   Autumn leaves burned overhead;     Hues so splendid     Softly blended,   Oh, the glory that they shed!   Red and gold, and gold and red.    Gold and brown, and brown and gold,   Of such fun the west wind told     That they listened,     And they glistened,   As they wrestled in the cold;   Gold and brown, and brown and gold.    Brown and gold, and red and brown,   How they hurried, scurried down     For a frolic,     For a rolic,   Through the country and the town,   Brown and gold, and red and brown.     [Illustration: A bird in a tree]  A STORY OF BIRD LIFE  I   Once there came to our fields a pair of birds. They had never built a nest nor seen a winter.  Oh, how beautiful was everything! The fields were full of flowers, the grass was growing tall, and the bees were humming everywhere.  One of the birds fell to singing, and the other bird said, \"Who told you to sing?\"  He answered, \"The flowers and the bees told me. The blue sky told me, and you told me.\"  \"When did I tell you to sing?\" asked his mate.  \"Every time you brought in tender grass for the nest,\" he replied. \"Every time your soft wings fluttered off again for hair and feathers to line it.\"  Then his mate asked, \"What are you singing about?\"  \"I am singing about everything,\" he answered. \"I sing because I am happy.\"  By and by five little speckled eggs were in the nest, and the mother bird asked, \"Is there anything in all the world as pretty as my eggs?\"  A week or two afterward, the mother said, \"Oh, what do you think has happened? One of my eggs has been peeping and moving.\"  Soon another egg moved, then another, and another, till five eggs were hatched.  The little birds were so hungry that it kept the parents busy feeding them. Away they both flew. The moment the little birds heard them coming back, five yellow mouths flew open wide.  \"Can anybody be happier?\" said the father bird to the mother bird. \"We will live in this tree always. It is a tree that bears joy.\"   II   The very next day one of the birds dropped out of the nest, and in a moment a cat ate it up. Only four remained, and the parent birds were very sad. There was no song all that day, nor the next.  Soon the little birds were big enough to fly. The first bird that tried his wings flew from one branch to another. His parents praised him, and the other baby birds wondered how he had done it.  The little one was so proud of it that he tried again. He flew and flew and couldn't stop flying. At last he fell plump! down by the kitchen door. A little boy caught him and carried him into the house.  Now only three birds were left. The sun no longer seemed bright to the birds, and they did not sing so often.  In a little time the other birds learned to use their wings, and they flew away and away. They found their own food and made their own nests.  Then the old birds sat silent and looked at each other a long while. At last the mother bird asked, \"Why don't you sing?\"  \"I can't sing,\" the father bird answered. \"I only think and think!\"  \"What are you thinking of?\"  \"I am thinking how everything changes. The leaves are falling, and soon there will be no roof over our heads. The flowers are all gone. Last night there was a frost. Almost all the birds have flown away, and I am restless. Something calls me, and I feel that I must fly away, too.\"  [Illustration: Two birds flying over a field]  \"Let us fly away together!\" the mother bird said.  Then they rose silently up in the air. They looked to the north; far away they saw the snow coming. They looked to the south; there they saw green leaves.  All day they flew. All night they flew and flew, till they found a land where there was no winter. There it was summer all the time; flowers always blossomed and birds always sang.  --HENRY WARD BEECHER     BOB WHITE     There's a plump little chap in a speckled coat,   And he sits on the zigzag rails remote,   Where he whistles at breezy, bracing morn,   When the buckwheat is ripe, and stacked is the corn:   \"Bob White! Bob White! Bob White!\"    Is he hailing some comrade as blithe as he?   Now I wonder where Robert White can be!   O'er the billows of gold and amber grain   There is no one in sight--but, hark again:   \"Bob White! Bob White! Bob White!\"    Ah! I see why he calls; in the stubble there   Hide his plump little wife and babies fair!   So contented is he, and so proud of the same,   That he wants all the world to know his name:   \"Bob White! Bob White! Bob White!\"  --GEORGE COOPER.     HOW MARY GOT A NEW DRESS   Mary lived a long time ago. She was a little girl when your great-great-grandmother was a little girl.  In those days all cloth had to be made at home. Aunt Dinah, Aunt Chloe, and Aunt Dilsey were kept busy spinning and weaving to make clothes for the whole plantation.  One day Mary's mother said, \"Aunt Dilsey, Mary needs a new dress, and I want you to weave some cloth at once. Can you weave some very fine cloth?\"  \"Yes, ma'am,\" said Aunt Dilsey. \"I have some cotton I've been saving to make her a dress.\"  Aunt Dilsey got out the cards and carded the cotton smooth and fine. Then she fastened a roll of this cotton to the spindle and sent the wheel whirling around with a \"Zum-m-m-m--Zum-m-m-m!\"  Mary stood and watched the old woman.  [Illustration: Mary watching Aunt Dilsey at spinning wheel]  \"Aunt Dilsey,\" she said, \"the spinning wheel sings a song, and I know what it says. Grandmother told me. It says,    'A hum and a whirl,   A twist and a twirl,   This is for the girl   With the golden curl!   Zum-m-m-m-m-m!   Zum-m-m-m-m-m!'\"  \"And that means you, honey,\" said Aunt Dilsey.  When the yarn was ready, Aunt Dilsey fastened it in the loom and began to weave. The threads went over and under, over and under. As Aunt Dilsey wove, she hummed. Mary stood by and sang this song,    \"Over and under and over we go,   Weaving the cotton as white as the snow,   Weaving the cloth for a dress, oh, ho!   As over and under and over we go.\"  After the cloth had been woven, Aunt Dilsey took it out of the loom. Then she bleached it until it was as white as snow. Now it was ready to be made into a dress.  \"Mother, do tell me how you are going to make the dress,\" said Mary. \"Will it have ruffles on it like Sue's? Will it have trimming on it? And how many buttons will you put on it? Sue's dress has twelve; I know, for I counted them.\"  Mother did not answer all these questions; she just smiled as the scissors went snip, snip into the cloth. But she did cut out ruffles, and Aunt Maria began to hem them.  [Illustration: Mary with her mother and grandmother]  By and by grandmother came into the room.  \"Mary,\" she said, \"here is some lace I got in England. Mother may put it on your dress.\"  How happy Mary was! She danced for joy.  Mother put on the lace, and grandmother worked the buttonholes. How many do you suppose she worked? Why, she worked twelve!  When the dress was finished, it was just like "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15170"],["title","The Child's World: Third Reader (#2)"],["body","Sue's. Only it was a great deal finer, for Mary's dress had three ruffles and Sue's had only two! And, then, there was the lace from England!     THE PLAID DRESS   \"I want a warm plaid dress,\" said a little girl. \"The days are colder, and the frost will soon be here. But how can I get it? Mother says that she cannot buy one for me.\"  The old white sheep in the meadow heard her, and he bleated to the shepherd, \"The little girl wants a warm plaid dress. I will give my wool. Who else will help?\"  The kind shepherd said, \"I will.\" Then he led the old white sheep to the brook and washed its wool. When it was clean and white, he said, \"The little girl wants a warm plaid dress. The sheep has given his wool, and I have washed it clean and white. Who else will help?\"  \"We will,\" said the shearers. \"We will bring our shears and cut off the wool.\"  The shearers cut the soft wool from the old sheep, and then they called, \"The little girl wants a new dress. The sheep has given his wool. The shepherd has washed it; and we have sheared it. Who else will help?\"  [Illustration: Shearer shearing the sheep]  \"We will,\" cried the carders. \"We will comb it out straight and smooth.\"  Soon they held up the wool, carded straight and smooth, and they cried, \"The little girl wants a new dress. The sheep has given his wool. The shepherd has washed the wool. The shearers have cut it, and we have carded it. Who else will help?\"  \"We will,\" said the spinners. \"We will spin it into thread.\"  \"Whirr, whirr!\" How fast the spinning wheels turned, singing all the time.  Soon the spinners said, \"The little girl wants a new dress. The sheep has given his wool. The shepherd has washed the wool. The shearers have cut it. The carders have carded it, and we have spun it into thread. Who else will help?\"  \"We will,\" said the dyers. \"We will dye it with beautiful colors.\"  Then they dipped the woven threads into bright dye, red and blue and green and brown.  As they spread the wool out to dry, the dyers called: \"The little girl wants a new dress. The sheep has given his wool. The shepherd has washed the wool. The shearers have cut it. The carders have carded it. The spinners have spun it, and we have dyed it with bright beautiful colors. Who else will help?\"  \"We will,\" said the weavers. \"We will make it into cloth.\"  [Illustration: Weaver at loom]  \"Clickety-clack! clickety-clack!\" went the loom, as the colored thread was woven over and under over and under. Before long it was made into beautiful plaid cloth.  Then the little girl's mother cut and made the dress. It was a beautiful plaid dress, and the little girl loved to wear it. Every time she put it on, she thought of her friends who had helped her,--the sheep, the shearers, the carders, the spinners, the dyers, the weavers, and her own dear mother.     THE GODDESS OF THE SILKWORM   Hoangti was the emperor of China. He had a beautiful wife whose name was Si-ling. The emperor and his wife loved their people and always thought of their happiness.  In those days the Chinese people wore clothes made of skins. By and by animals grew scarce, and the people did not know what they should wear. The emperor and empress tried in vain to find some other way of clothing them.  One morning Hoangti and his wife were in the beautiful palace garden. They walked up and down, up and down, talking of their people.  Suddenly the emperor said, \"Look at those worms on the mulberry trees, Si-ling. They seem to be spinning.\"  Si-ling looked, and sure enough, the worms were spinning. A long thread was coming from the mouth of each, and each little worm was winding this thread around its body.  Si-ling and the emperor stood still and watched the worms. \"How wonderful!\" said Si-ling.  The next morning Hoangti and the empress walked under the trees again. They found some worms still winding thread. Others had already spun their cocoons and were fast asleep. In a few days all of the worms had spun cocoons.  \"This is indeed a wonderful, wonderful thing!\" said Si-ling. \"Why, each worm has a thread on its body long enough to make a house for itself!\"  Si-ling thought of this day after day. One morning as she and the emperor walked under the trees, she said, \"I believe I could find a way to weave those long threads into cloth.\"  \"But how could you unwind the threads?\" asked the emperor.  [Illustration: Hoangti and Si-ling walking among the trees]  \"I'll find a way,\" Si-ling said. And she did; but she had to try many, many times.  She put the cocoons in a hot place, and the little sleepers soon died. Then the cocoons were thrown into boiling water to make the threads soft. After that the long threads could be easily unwound.  Now Si-ling had to think of something else; she had to find a way to weave the threads into cloth. After many trials, she made a loom--the first that was ever made. She taught others to weave, and soon hundreds of people were making cloth from the threads of the silkworm.  The people ever afterward called Si-ling \"The Goddess of the Silkworm.\" And whenever the emperor walked with her in the garden, they liked to watch the silkworms spinning threads for the good of their people.     THE FLAX  I   It was spring. The flax was in full bloom, and it had dainty little blue flowers that nodded in the breeze.  \"People say that I look very well,\" said the flax. \"They say that I am fine and long and that I shall make a beautiful piece of linen. How happy I am! No one in the world can be happier.\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said the fence post, \"you may grow and be happy, and you may sing, but you do not know the world as I do. Why, I have knots in me.\" And it creaked;    \"Snip, snap, snurre,   Basse, lurre,   The song is ended.\"  \"No, it is not ended,\" said the flax. \"The sun will shine, and the rain will fall, and I shall grow and grow. No, no, the song is not ended.\"  One day some men came with sharp reap hooks. They took the flax by the head and cut it off at the roots. This was very painful, you may be sure.  Then the flax was laid in water and was nearly drowned. After that it was put on a fire and nearly roasted. All this was frightful. But the flax only said, \"One cannot be happy always. By having bad times as well as good, we become wise.\"  After the flax had been cut and steeped and roasted, it was put on a spinning wheel. \"Whir-r-r, whir-rr-r,\" went the spinning wheel; it went so fast that the flax could hardly think.  \"I have been very happy in the sunshine and the rain,\" it said. \"If I am in pain now, I must be contented.\"  At last the flax was put in the loom. Soon it became a beautiful piece of white linen.  \"This is very wonderful,\" said the flax. \"How foolish the fence post was with its song of--    'Snip, snap, snurre,   Basse, lurre,   The song is ended.'  The song is not ended, I am sure. It has only just begun.  \"After all that I have suffered, I am at last made into beautiful linen. How strong and fine I am, and how long and white! This is even better than being a plant bearing flowers. I have never been happier than I am now.\"  After some time the linen was cut into pieces and sewed with needles. That was not pleasant; but at last there were twelve pretty white aprons.  \"See,\" said the flax, \"I have been made into something. Now I shall be of some use in the world. That is the only way to be happy.\"   II   Years passed by, and the linen was so worn that it could hardly hold together.  \"The end must come soon,\" said the flax.  At last the linen did fall into rags and tatters; it was torn into shreds and boiled in water. The flax thought the end had come.  But no, the end was not yet. After being made into pulp and dried, the flax became beautiful white paper.  \"This is a surprise, a glorious surprise,\" it said. \"I am finer than ever, and I shall have fine things written on me. How happy I am!\"  And sure enough, the most beautiful stories and verses were written upon it. People read the stories and verses, and they were made wiser and better. Their children and their children's children read them, too, and so the song was not ended.  --HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN.  [Illustration: Girl reading a book]     THE WONDERFUL WORLD     Great, wide, beautiful, wonderful World,   With the wonderful water round you curled,   And the wonderful grass upon your breast,   World, you are beautifully drest.    The wonderful air is over me,   And the wonderful wind is shaking the tree--   It walks on the water, and whirls the mills,   And talks to itself on the top of the hills.    You friendly Earth, how far do you go,   With the wheat-fields that nod and the rivers that flow,   With cities and gardens, and cliffs and isles,   And people upon you for thousands of miles?    Ah! you are so great, and I am so small,   I hardly can think of you, World, at all;   And yet, when I said my prayers to-day,   A whisper within me seemed to say,   \"You are more than the Earth, though you are such a dot!   You can love and think, and the Earth cannot!\"  --William Brighty Rands.     [Illustration: The Hillman at the housewife's door]  THE HILLMAN AND THE HOUSEWIFE   As every one knows, fairies are always just. They are kind to others, and in return they expect others to be kind to them. In some countries across the sea there are fairies called Hillmen.  Now, there once lived a certain housewife who liked to make bargains. She gave away only those things for which she had no use, and then expected always to get something in return.  One day a Hillman knocked at her door.  \"Can you lend us a saucepan?\" he asked. \"There's a wedding on the hill, and all the pots are in use.\"  \"Is he to have one?\" whispered the servant who opened the door.  \"Aye, to be sure,\" answered the housewife; \"one must be neighborly. Get the saucepan for him, lass.\"  The maid turned to take a good saucepan from the shelf, but the housewife stopped her.  \"Not that, not that,\" she whispered. \"Get the old one out of the cupboard. It leaks, but that doesn't matter. The Hillmen are"]]]
