It must be borne in mind that the Jewish population of Western Russia had but recently been incorporated into the Russian Empire. Clinging with patriarchal devotion to their religion, estranged from the Russian people, and kept, moreover, in a state of civil rightlessness, the Jews of that region could not be reasonably expected to gloat over the prospect of a military service of twenty-five years' duration, which was bound to alienate their sons from their ancestral faith, detach them from their native tongue, their habits and customs of life, and throw them into a strange, and often hostile, environment. The ultimate aim of the project, which, imbedded in the mind of its originators, seemed safely hidden from the eye of publicity, was quickly sensed by the delicate national instinct, and the soul of the people was stirred to its depths. Public-minded Jews strained every nerve to avert the calamity. Jewish representatives journeyed to St. Petersburg and Warsaw to plead the cause of their brethren. Negotiations were entered into with dignitaries of high rank and with men of influence in the world of officialdom. Rumor had it that immense bribes had been offered to Novosiltzev and several high officials in St. Petersburg for the purpose of receiving their co-operation. But even the intercession of leading dignitaries was powerless to change the will of the Tzar. He chafed under the red-tape formalities which obstructed the realization of his favorite scheme. Without waiting for the transmission of Novosiltzev's memorandum, the Tzar directed the Minister of the Interior and the Chief of the General Staff to submit to him for signature an ukase imposing military service upon the Jews. The fatal enactment was signed on August 26, 1827.   2. The Recruiting Ukase of 1827 and Juvenile Conscription  The ukase announces the desire of the Government \"to equalize military duty for all estates,\" without, be it noted, equalizing them in their rights. It further expresses the conviction that \"the training and accomplishments, acquired by the Jews during their military service, will, on their return home after the completion of the number of years fixed by law (fully a quarter of a century!), be communicated to their families and make for greater usefulness and higher efficiency in their economic life and in the management of their affairs.\"  However, the \"Statute of Conscription and Military Service,\" subjoined to the ukase, was a lurid illustration of a tendency utterly at variance with the desire \"to equalize military duty.\" Had the Russian Government been genuinely desirous of rendering military duty uniform for all estates, there would have been no need of issuing separately for the Jews a huge enactment of ninety-five clauses, with supplementary \"instructions,\" consisting of sixty-two clauses, for the guidance of the civil and military authorities. All that was necessary was to declare that the general military statute applied also to the Jews. Instead, the reverse stipulation is made: \"The general laws and institutions are not valid in the case of the Jews\" when at variance with the special statute (Clause 3).  The discriminating character of Jewish conscription looms particularly large in the central portion of the statute. Jewish families were stricken with terror on reading the eighth clause of the statute prescribing that \"the Jewish conscripts presented by the [Jewish] communes shall be between the ages of twelve and twenty-five.\" This provision was supplemented by Clause 74: \"Jewish minors, i.e., below the age of eighteen, shall be placed in preparatory establishments for military training.\"  True, the institution of minor recruits, called _cantonists_, [1] existed also for Christians. But in their case it was confined to the children of soldiers in active service, by virtue of the principle laid down by Arakcheyev [2] that children born of soldiers were the property of the Military Department, whereas the conscription of Jewish minors was to be absolute and to apply to all Jewish families without discrimination. To make things worse, the law demanded that the years of preparatory training should not be included in the term of active service, the latter to start only with the age of eighteen (Clause 90); in other words, the Jewish cantonists were compelled to serve an additional term of six years over and above the obligatory twenty-five years. Moreover, at the examination of Jewish conscripts, all that was demanded for their enlistment was \"that they be free from any disease or defect incompatible with military service, but the other qualifications required by the general rules shall be left out of consideration\" (Clause 10).  [Footnote 1: From _Canton_, a word applied in Prussia in the eighteenth century to a recruiting district. In Russia, beginning with 1805, the term \"cantonists\" is applied to children born of soldiers and therefore liable to conscription.]  [Footnote 2: See Vol. I, p. 395, n. 1.]  The duty of enlisting the recruits was imposed upon the Jewish communes, or Kahals, which were to elect for that purpose between three and six executive officers, or \"trustees,\" in every city. The community as such was held responsible for the supply of a given number of recruits from its own midst. It was authorized to draft into military service any Jew guilty \"of irregularity in the payment of taxes, of vagrancy, and other misdemeanors.\" In case the required number of recruits was not forthcoming within a given term, the authorities were empowered to obtain them from the derelict community \"by way of execution.\" [1] Any irregularity on the part of the recruiting \"trustees\" was to be punished by the imposition of fines or even by sending them into the army.  [Footnote 1: The term \"execution\" (_ekzekutzia_) is used in Russian to designate a writ empowering an officer to carry a judgment into effect, in other words, to resort to forcible seizure.]  The following categories of Jews were exempted from military duty: merchants holding membership in guilds, artisans affiliated with trade-unions, mechanics in factories, agricultural colonists, rabbis, and the Jews, few and far between at that time, who had graduated from a Russian educational institution. Those exempted from military service in kind were required to pay \"recruiting money,\" one thousand rubles for each recruit. The general law providing that a regular recruit could offer as his substitute a \"volunteer\" was extended to the Jews, with the proviso that the volunteer must also be a Jew.  The \"Instructions\" to the civil authorities, appended to the statute, specify the formalities to be followed both at the recruiting stations and in administering the oath of allegiance to the conscripts in the synagogues. The latter ceremony was to be marked by gloomy solemnity. The recruit was to be arrayed in his prayer-shawl (Tallith) and shroud (Kittel). With his philacteries wound around his arm, he should be placed before the Ark and, amidst burning candles and to the accompaniment of shofar blasts, made to recite a lengthy awe-inspiring oath. The \"Instructions\" to the military authorities accompanying the statute prescribe that every batch of Jewish conscripts \"shall be entrusted to a special officer to be watched over, prior to their departure for their places of destination, and shall be kept apart from the other recruits.\" Both in the places of conscription and on the journey the Jewish recruits were to be quartered exclusively in the homes of Christian residents.  The promulgated \"military constitution\" surpassed the very worst apprehension of the Jews. All were staggered by this sudden blow, which descended crushingly upon the mode of life, the time-honored traditions, and the religious ideals of the Jewish people. The Jewish family nests became astir, trembling for their fledglings. Barely a month after the publication of the military statute, the central Government in St. Petersburg was startled by the report that the Volhynian town of Old-Constantine had been the scene of \"mutiny and disorders among the Jews\" on the occasion of the promulgation of the ukase. Benckendorff, the Chief of the Gendarmerie, [1] conveyed this information to the Tzar, who thereupon gave orders that \"in all similar cases the culprits be court-martialed\". Evidently, the St. Petersburg authorities apprehended a whole series of Jewish mutinies, as a result of the dreadful ukase, and they were ready with extraordinary measures for the emergency.  [Footnote 1: Since 1827 the Gendarmerie served as the executive organ of the political police, or of the so-called Third Section, dreaded throughout Russia on account of its relentless cruelty in suppressing the slightest manifestation of liberal thought. The Third Section was nominally abolished in 1880.]  However, their apprehensions were unfounded. Apart from the incident referred to, there were no cases of open rebellion against the authorities. As a matter of fact, even in Old-Constantine, the \"mutiny\" was of a nature little calculated to be dealt with by a court-martial. According to the local tradition, the Jewish residents, Hasidim almost to a man, were so profoundly stirred by the imperial ukase that they assembled in the synagogues, fasting and praying, and finally resolved to adopt \"energetic\" measures. A petition reciting their grievances against the Tzar was framed in due form and placed in the hands of a member of the community who had just died, with the request that the deceased present it to the Almighty, the God of Israel. This childlike appeal to the heavenly King from the action of an earthly sovereign and the emotional scenes accompanying it were interpreted by the Russian authorities as \"mutiny.\" Under the patriarchal conditions of Jewish life prevailing at that time a political protest was a matter of impossibility. The only medium through which the Jews could give vent to their burning "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15729"],["title","History of the Jews in Russia and Poland, Volume 2 [of 3] (#3)"],["body","sorrow was a religious demonstration within the walls of the synagogue.   3. MILITARY MARTYRDOM  The ways and means by which the provisions of the military statute were carried into effect during the reign of Nicholas I. we do not learn from official documents, which seem to have drawn a veil over this dismal strip of the past. Our information is derived from sources far more communicative and nearer to truth--the traditions current among the people. Owing to the fact that every Jewish community, at the mutual responsibility of all its members, was compelled by law to supply a definite number of recruits, and that no one was willing to become a soldier of his own volition, the Kahal administration and the recruiting \"trustees,\" who had to answer to the authorities for any shortage in recruits, were practically forced to become a sort of police agents, whose function it was to \"capture\" the necessary quota of recruits. Prior to every military conscription, the victims marked for prey, the young men and boys of the burgher class, [1] very generally took to flight, hiding in distant cities, outside the zone of their Kahals, or in forests and ravines. A popular song in Yiddish refers to these conditions in the following words;  [Footnote 1: Compare on the status of the burgher in Russian law Vol. I, p. 308, n. 2. Nearly all the higher estates were exempt.]        _Der Ukas is arobgekumen auf judische Selner,       Seinen mir sich zulofen in die puste Wälder.....       In alle puste Wälder seinen mir zulofen,       In puste Gruber seinen mir verlofen_..... Oi weih, oi weih!_....[1]  [Footnote 1:        When the ukase came down about Jewish soldiers,       We all dispersed over the lonesome forests;       Over the lonesome forests did we disperse,       In lonesome pits did we hide ourselves.... Woe me, Woe!]  The recruiting agents hired by the Kahal or its \"trustees,\" who received the nickname \"hunters\" or \"captors,\" [1] hunted down the fugitives, trailing them everywhere and capturing them for the purpose of making up the shortage. In default of a sufficient number of adults, little children, who were easier \"catch,\" were seized, often enough in violation of the provision of the law. Even boys under the required age of twelve, sometimes no more than eight years old, were caught and offered as conscripts at the recruiting stations, their age being misstated. [2] The agents perpetrated incredible cruelties. Houses were raided during the night, and children were torn from the arms of their mothers, or lured away and kidnapped.  [Footnote 1: More literally \"catchers\"; in Yiddish _Khappers_.]  [Footnote 2: This was the more easy, as regular birth-registers were not yet in existence.]  After being captured, the Jewish conscripts were sent into the recruiting jail where they were kept in confinement until their examination at the recruiting station. The enlisted minors were turned over to a special officer to be dispatched to their places of destination, mostly in the Eastern provinces including Siberia. For it must be noted that the cantonists were stationed almost to a man in the outlying Russian governments, where they could be brought up at a safe distance from all Jewish influences. The unfortunate victims who were drafted into the army and deported to these far-off regions were mourned by their relatives as dead. During the autumnal season, when the recruits were drafted and deported, the streets of the Jewish towns resounded with moans. The juvenile cantonists were packed into wagons like so many sheep and carried off in batches under a military convoy. When they took leave of their dear ones it was for a quarter of a century; in the case of children it was for a longer term, too often it was good-bye for life.  How these unfortunate youngsters were driven to their places of destination we learn from the description of Alexander Hertzen, [1] who chanced to meet a batch of Jewish cantonists on his involuntary journey through Vyatka, in 1835. At one of the post stations in some God-forsaken village of the Vyatka government he met the escorting officer. The following dialogue ensued between the two:  [Footnote 1: Hertzen, a famous Russian writer (d. 1870), was exiled to the government of Vyatka for propagating liberal doctrines.]    \"Whom do you carry and to what place?\"    \"Well, sir, you see, they got together a bunch of these accursed   Jewish youngsters between the age of eight and nine. I suppose they   are meant for the fleet, but how should I know? At first the command   was to drive them to Perm. Now there is a change. We are told to   drive them to Kazan. I have had them on my hands for a hundred   versts or thereabouts. The officer that turned them over to me told   me they were an awful nuisance. A third of them remained on the road   (at this the officer pointed with his finger to the ground). Half of   them will not get to their destination,\" he added.    \"Epidemics, I suppose?\", I inquired, stirred to the very core.    \"No, not exactly epidemics; but they just fall like flies. Well, you   know, these Jewish boys are so puny and delicate. They can't stand   mixing dirt for ten hours, with dry biscuits to live on. Again   everywhere strange folks, no father, no mother, no caresses. Well   then, you just hear a cough and the youngster is dead. Hello,   corporal, get out the small fry!\"    The little ones were assembled and arrayed in a military line. It   was one of the most terrible spectacles I have ever witnessed. Poor,   poor children! The boys of twelve or thirteen managed somehow to   stand up, but the little ones of eight and ten.... No brush, however   black, could convey the terror of this scene on the canvas.    Pale, worn out, with scared looks, this is the way they stood in   their uncomfortable, rough soldier uniforms, with their starched,   turned-up collars, fixing an inexpressibly helpless and pitiful gaze   upon the garrisoned soldiers, who were handling them rudely. White   lips, blue lines under the eyes betokened either fever or cold. And   these poor children, without care, without a caress, exposed to the   wind which blows unhindered from the Arctic Ocean, were marching to   their death. I seized the officer's hand, and, with the words: \"Take   good care of them! \", threw myself into my carriage. I felt like   sobbing, and I knew I could not master myself....  The great Russian writer saw the Jewish cantonists on the road, but he knew nothing of what happened to them later on, in the recesses of the barracks into which they were driven. This terrible secret was revealed to the world at a later period by the few survivors among these martyred Jewish children.  Having arrived at their destination, the juvenile conscripts were put into the cantonist battalions. The \"preparation for military service\" began with their religious re-education at the hands of sergeants and corporals. No means was, neglected so long as it bade fair to bring the children to the baptismal font. The authorities refrained from giving formal instructions, leaving everything to the zeal of the officers who knew the wishes of their superiors. The children were first sent for spiritual admonition to the local Greek-Orthodox priests, whose efforts, however, proved fruitless in nearly every case. They were then taken in hand by the sergeants and corporals who adopted military methods of persuasion.  These brutal soldiers invented all kinds of tortures. A favorite procedure was to make the cantonists get down on their knees in the evening after all had gone to bed and to keep the sleepy children in that position for hours. Those who agreed to be baptized were sent to bed, those who refused were kept up the whole night till they dropped from exhaustion. The children who continued to hold their own were flogged and, under the guise of gymnastic exercises, subjected to all kinds of tortures. Those that refused to eat pork or the customary cabbage soup prepared with lard were beaten and left to starve. Others were fed on salted fish and then forbidden to drink, until the little ones, tormented by thirst, agreed to embrace Christianity.  The majority of these children, unable to endure the tortures inflicted on them, saved themselves by baptism. But many cantonists, particularly those of a maturer age (between fifteen and eighteen), bore their martyrdom with heroic patience. Beaten almost into senselessness, their bodies striped by lashes, tormented to the point of exhaustion by hunger, thirst, and sleeplessness, the lads declared again and again that they would not betray the faith of their fathers. Most of these obstinate youths were carried from the barracks into the military hospitals to be released by a kind death. Only a few remained alive.  Alongside of this passive heroism there were cases of demonstrative martyrdom. One such incident has survived in the popular memory. The story goes that during a military parade [1] in the city of Kazan the battalion chief drew up all the Jewish cantonists on the banks of the river, where the Greek-Orthodox priests were standing in their vestments, and all was ready for the baptismal ceremony. At the command to jump into the water, the boys answered in military fashion \"Aye, aye!\" Whereupon they dived under and disappeared. When they were dragged out, they were dead. In most cases, however, these little martyrs suffered and died noiselessly, in the gloom of the guard-houses, barracks, and military hospitals. They strewed with their tiny bodies the roads that led into the outlying regions of the Empire, and those that managed to get there were fading away slowly in the barracks which had been turned into inquisitorial dungeons. This martyrdom of children, set in a military environment, represents a singular phenomenon even in the extensive annals of Jewish martyrology.
