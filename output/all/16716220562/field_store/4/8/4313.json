That's all the stock you need except the box.\"  \"I suppose you've got a particular box in mind to fit those sizes.\"  \"Those sizes fit the box, rather.  Yes, I got a grocery box that was about eighteen inches long and thirteen wide and eleven deep.  I saw one here just like it before I gave you those measurements, so you can go ahead sawing while I pull off one side of the box--the cover has gone already but we don't need it.\"  Quiet reigned for a few minutes while they all worked briskly.  \"Now I'm ready to put this superb article together,\" announced Roger. \"How high from the ground does the seat go?\"  \"Nail your cleats across with their top edges fifteen inches from the ground and nail the bottom of the box on to the cleats.  See how these two-sided legs protect the edges of the box as well as make it decent looking?\"  \"So they do,\" admitted Roger.  \"They aren't so bad after all.\"  \"I think those sides are going to be too high,\" decided Dorothy after examining the chair carefully and sitting down in it.  \"Don't you think it pushes your elbows up too high?\"  Roger tried it and thought it did.  \"Suppose you saw those sides down about five inches.\"  Roger obeyed and Dorothy tried the chair again and pronounced it much improved.  \"It's comfy enough now, but these arms don't look very well, and they'd be liable to tear your sleeves,\" she said.  \"Let's put on some strip covers.  They'll give a finish to the whole thing, and hide the end of the two-sided legs and be smooth.\"  \"Plenty of reason for having them.  How many inches?\"  \"Twelve,\" answered Dorothy after measuring.  \"The top of the back needs a strip cover, too.  Cut another nineteen inches long.  There, _I_ think that's not such a bad looking chair!'\"  \"Do you want cushions for those chairs?\" inquired Ethel Brown, appearing at the door with a piece of cretonne in her hand.  \"We've got material enough for at least seat cushions for both of them.\"  \"They'll be lots more comfy,\" admitted James, \"if the excelsior crop is still holding out.\"  \"It is.  I'll make them right off, and Ethel Blue can help you out there.\"  She retired from view and sent out her cousin, and until the sun set the two boys and Dorothy and Ethel measured and sawed and nailed, with results that satisfied them so well that they did not mind being tired.     CHAPTER VII  TROUBLE AT ROSE HOUSE  \"If it weren't that I could come out here and see you every day or so I should be wild to get back to work in Oklahoma.\"  Edward Watkins was the speaker.  He and Miss Merriam were walking through a wooded path that ran from Rosemont to Rose House.  The day was warm and the shade of the trees was grateful.  \"How is your patient?\" asked Gertrude.  \"Getting on very well, but the doctors won't let him travel yet.\"  \"Have you heard lately from your doctor in Oklahoma?\"  \"I hear about every day!  I was with him just long enough for him to find that I was useful and he's wild to have me there again.  I wired him that I'm ready to go, but that the sick man is nervous about making the return trip alone.  Of course he wants to keep on the good side of a good patient, so he answered, 'Stay on'.\"  \"Are you able to do anything for your patient?  He's still in the hospital, isn't he?\"  \"I go there every day and he sends me on errands all over town.  I'm getting to know almost as much about oil as I do about medicine!  But I'm rather tired of playing errand boy.\"  \"You have a chance to see your family.\"  \"And you.  But I'm supposed to stay at the hotel, much to Mother's disgust.  I'm doing a little medical inspection among Father's poor people, though.  That whiles away a few hours every day, and of course, every time I go to the hospital the doctors there tell me about any interesting new cases, so I'm not 'going stale' entirely.\"  \"As if you could!\" exclaimed Gertrude admiringly.  \"You're just storing up ideas and information to startle the Oklahoman natives with.\"  \"The 'natives' in Oklahoma are all too young to be startled,\" laughed Edward, \"but of course I'm stowing away everything new I hear about methods of treatment and operations and so on to tell Dr. Billings when I get back.  Now let me hear what you've been doing.  How are these kiddies at Rose House?\"  \"I want you to look them over and talk with the mothers.  Dr. Hancock comes over when we send for him, but all these people are so delicate that I feel that they ought to have a physician's eye on them all the time.\"  \"They have you pretty often, don't they?\"  \"I go over every day either in the morning or the afternoon, and I give them advice about the babies, and teach them and Moya how to prepare their food, but they do such strange things that you can't forestall because you never had the wildest idea that any woman in her senses would treat a baby so.\"  Edward laughed.  \"Russian and Bulgarian peasant customs, I suppose.  I never shall forget the first time I saw a two-day old negro baby sucking a bit of fat bacon.  I nearly had a chill.\"  \"Didn't the child have a chill?\"  \"Not the slightest!  If they get ahead of you with some pleasing little trick like that you can console yourself with the thought that generally there is some basis of old-time experience that has shown it to be not so harmful as we are apt to think.\"  \"I've done enough tenement house work to know that the babies certainly survive extraordinary treatment, but these babies here are so delicate that they ought to have the most careful diet.  Most of them need real nursing.\"  \"Do you think your talks are making any impressions on the mothers?\"  \"Sometimes Mrs. Schuler and I think so, and just then it almost always happens that one of them does something totally unexpected that gives our hopes a terrible blow.\"  \"Let's trust that this is a good day; I'd rather talk to you than work over a case this fine afternoon.\"  Gertrude smiled at his tone and they walked on in silence out of the wood and across the brook and down the lane that brought them to the back of Rose House where the Club boys and girls were busy making a piece of furniture of some sort.  Mrs. Schuler was talking to Moya in the kitchen.  \"I've brought Dr. Watkins to see everybody,\" announced Miss Merriam gayly.  \"Where are they all?\"  \"The ones who are at home are up in the pine grove, but Moya has just told me that Mrs. Paterno and her older boy and Mrs. Tsanoff and one of the twins have gone to town.\"  \"Walked?\"  \"Walked by the road on this scorching day!\"  Miss Merriam turned to the doctor.  \"This is one of the unexpected events we were just talking about. Little Paterno is four and too large for that little woman to carry, and far too small and weak to take that long walk on his own legs even on a more suitable day than this, and the Tsanoff twins are just holding on to life by the tips of their fingers!\"  She sat down in despair.  Dr.  Watkins looked serious.  \"Is there any way of heading them off or bringing them back.  Can we reach them anywhere by telephone?\"  \"No one knows where they can have gone.  It seems it must have been about an hour and a half ago that they started and I should think they'd be back before long if they're able to come back--\"  \"--under their own steam!\" finished the doctor with a doubtful smile.  \"Let's go to the grove and see the women and children there and perhaps the others will be in sight by the time you've finished your examination.\"  They turned toward the pines whose thick needles cast a heavy shade upon the ground and gave forth a delicious fragrance under the rays of the sun.  As they disappeared Mrs. Schuler went out on the platform where the carpentering operations were going on.  \"I'm so disturbed about those women,\" she said, \"I've come to see what you're doing to divert my mind from them.\"  \"We're going to make two of these seats, one for your office and the other for the veranda,\" said Ethel Brown, standing erect and putting a hand upon her weary back.  The rest of the young carpenters stopped their work and wiped their perspiring foreheads while they explained the construction of the piece of furniture to their friend.  \"This long narrow box is the seat, you see.  It's a shoe case, and it's just the right height for comfort.  Roger has put hinges on the cover, so you can use it for a chest and keep rugs and cushions inside.\"  \"That's about as simple as it could be.  Does it take all of you to help Roger do that?\"  \"O, that's only a part of the entire affair.  We're making these two sets of shelves to go at the ends of the seat.\"  \"I see.  A great light breaks on me!\"  \"They're to be fastened to the ends of the seat.\"  \"Not for keeps.  That's Ethel Blue's patent.  She said it would be awkward to move about if it were all built together, so we're making it in three parts, and we're going to lock them together with hooks and screw eyes.\"  \"That is clever!  Then if you want to you can use these sets of shelves for little bookcases in another room or you can fasten on one of them and not the other.\"  \"Ethel Blue and I thought we'd make pink cushions for your office if you'd like them.\"  \"I think they'd be charming.  That pink room raises my spirits when--\"  \"--when you get _blue_?\" suggested Roger.  \"I'll have to go there now to get revived if those women who walked to town don't turn up soon,\" and the Matron went to the corner of the house whence she could see the lane that led from the road.  \"If they come home ill I'll have to ask you to make two bed trays,\" she suggested as she peered across the grass.  \"How do you make them?\"  \"Ask Ethel Blue.\"  \"Merely put legs on a light board so that the weight of the plates will be lifted from the sick person's legs as he sits up in bed.\"  \"What's to prevent the plates sliding off?\"  \"Nothing if he's much of a kicker, I should say,\" laughed Roger; \"but you could put a little fence an inch or two high at the back and sides and keep them on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15550"],["title","Ethel Morton at Rose House (#7)"],["body","d.\"  \"You'd better begin them right off,\" said Mrs. Schuler dryly, \"for here they come.\"  She disappeared around the corner and the young people followed to see what was the matter.  Trouble there was in very truth.  Mrs. Paterno led the way stumbling and running.  Her face was flushed a deep, threatening crimson and her breath came fast.  By the arm she held little Pietro, who from exhaustion had ceased to scream and merely gave a gulping moan when the gravel scraped his bare knees as his mother jerked him along regardless of whether he was on his feet or whether she dragged him.  Behind them at some distance came Mrs. Tsanoff carrying her baby in her arms--one of the twins that always seemed to be merely \"holding on to life by the tips of its fingers,\" to use Gertrude's expression, and now seemed to have lost even that frail hold.  It lay in its mother's arms white and with its eyes closed.  Mrs. Schuler ran to meet the Italian woman and lifted the worn child into her arms where he sank against her shoulder as if in a faint.  \"Run up in the grove and get Dr. Watkins and Miss Gertrude,\" Helen said to Roger.  \"Ask them quietly to come here.  Don't frighten the women.\"  Roger dashed away, his swift feet slowing to a walk as he neared the bit of woods where he delivered his message in an undertone.  Ethel Blue meanwhile, had rushed into the house to tell Moya to heat plenty of water and to crack some ice, and Margaret had opened Mrs. Schuler's closet of simple remedies and found the bottle of aromatic spirits of ammonia.  Ethel Brown and James ran to meet Mrs. Tsanoff, Ethel taking the baby from her and James steadying her shaking steps by a stout arm under her elbow.  As Dr. Watkins ran around the corner of the house he came upon Helen trying to help Mrs. Paterno, who was pushing her away with both hands, while she kept looking over her shoulder and screaming hysterically. Edward seized her hands and commanded her attention at once by speaking to her in Italian.  Although she did not know him she responded to his command to tell him of what she was afraid, and poured out a story of terror.  \"_Mano, nera, mano nera_--the Black Hand,\" she repeated over and over again, and Edward, who had heard her history, realized that something she had seen had set her mind in the old train of thought. While Miss Merriam attended to the children he calmed the woman and then turned her over to Mrs. Schuler with instructions to put her to bed in a darkened room and to see that some one stayed with her or just outside her door.  Fortunately for the doctor his experience with the people among whom his father worked in his East Side chapel had given him a smattering of many languages and he was able to make out from Mrs. Tsanoff, although her fright and fatigue had made her forget almost all the English she knew, what had terrified her companion.  They had gone to the stationery shop of the Englishman who also sold ice cream and soda, she said, and they had had each a glass of soda and the children had each had an ice cream cone.  Edward groaned and over his shoulder directed Delia to run and tell Miss Merriam that both babies had had ice cream cones.  \"It will help her to know what to do until I come,\" he explained.  Just as they were coming out of the store a dark man who looked like an Italian had passed them.  So far as she noticed he had paid no attention to them, but Mrs. Paterno had seized her arm, pointing after him, and then had picked up Pietro and started to run toward home.  Neither far nor fast could she go in such heat with such a burden and the poor little chap was soon tossed down and forced to run with giant strides all the rest of the eternal mile that stretched between Rosemont and Rose House.  Mrs. Tsanoff herself had followed as fast as she could because she was afraid that something, she knew not what, would happen to her friend.  She, too, was sent to bed, with Moya standing over her to lay cool compresses on her eyes, to sponge her wrists and ankles with cool water and to lay an occasional bit of cracked ice on her parched lips.  The condition of the two children was pitiable.  The heat, the sudden chill from the ice cream and the terrible homeward rush sent them both so nearly into a collapse that the doctor, Mrs. Schuler and Miss Merriam worked over them all night, resting only when Dr. Hancock, who had heard the story from James and Margaret and came up to see the state of affairs, relieved them for an hour.  \"How are we ever going to teach them the madness of such behavior?\" Gertrude asked wearily as Dr. Watkins insisted that she and Mrs. Schuler should go to bed as the dawn broke.  \"The poor little Italian woman is almost mad already, thanks to this Black Hand business.  It will take her a long time to recover her balance, but I think I can teach the others a lesson from this experience of their friends.  Wait till to-morrow comes and hear me talk five languages at once,\" he promised cheerfully as he turned her over to Mrs. Schuler.     CHAPTER VIII  SOME ENTERTAINMENT  The escapade of the Italian and Bulgarian women played havoc with the calm of Rose House for several days.  The women themselves had narrow escapes from illness and the children were so seriously ill that a trained nurse had to be sent up from the Glen Point Hospital, as neither Miss Merriam nor Mrs. Schuler could undertake nursing in addition to their other work.  When all was well again Miss Merriam redoubled her efforts to teach the women something of proper care of their children and themselves, and, with the help of Dr. Watkins's knowledge of languages, she began to hope that she was making some progress.  Mrs. Tsanoff and Mrs. Peterson, who had little babies, were taught to modify milk for them, the dangers of giving small children foods unsuited to their age was talked about now with the recent experience to point the moral; and ways of keeping well in hot weather were explained and listened to with interest.  Substitutes for meat were discussed earnestly, chiefly on account of the high cost of living but also because meat was declared to be far too heating for warm weather use.  Each of the women knew of some dish which took the place of meat and she was glad to tell the others about it.  Mrs. Paterno knew very well that cheese is one of the best substitutes for meat that there is.  \"Americans eat cheesa after meata; then sick,\" she declared with truth. Her receipt for a risotto Moya wrote down in the blank book in which she was collecting recipes and Mrs. Paterno beamed when it came onto the table.  Chiefly for the purpose of giving the little Italian woman a change of thought, the U. S. C. made a point of providing Rose House with some sort of entertainment every few days.  Once they introduced the inmates to an American hayride, and the four women, with Moya and the older children, screamed with delight as they found themselves moving slowly along on a real load of hay--for Grandfather Emerson declared that that was the only kind of hayride worth having.  Again they all stowed themselves away in the automobile and went to a pond ten miles away for a day's picnic.  That proved not to be a success, for everybody was so tired all the next day that there was a nearer approach to disagreement among them than ever happened before. Mrs. Schuler made up her mind that home--meaning Rose House--was the best place for them and that amusements must be found at home and not afield.     CHAPTER IX  A NEW KIND OF GRASS SEED  \"Your grand-father told me once about a field he had that was filled with daisies,\" said Ethel Blue.  \"It looked awfully pretty, but it spoiled the field for a pasture; the cows wouldn't touch them.\"  \"I remember that field.  We used to make daisy chains and trim Mother's room with them,\" said Ethel Brown.  \"Mr. Emerson tried ploughing up the field and he had men working over it for two seasons, but on the third, up they grew again as gay as you please.  They acted as if he had just been stirring up the soil so they would grow better than ever.\"  \"Poor Grandfather; he had a hard time with that field.\"  \"He said he really needed it for a pasture, so he made up his mind that if he couldn't root out the bad plants, he'd crowd them out.  So he bought some seed of a kind of grass that has large, strong roots, and he sowed it in the field.  As soon as it began to grow he could see that there certainly were not so many daisies there.  He kept on another year and the cows began to look over the fence as if they'd like to get in.  The third year there were so few daisies that they didn't count.\"  \"I remember all that,\" said Ethel Brown, \"but what does it have to do with Mrs. Paterno?\"  \"Why, if we--or Edward--could make her get a grip on herself and control herself that would be like Mr. Emerson's digging up the daisies.  It would be hard work and an awfully slow process.  But if we also could fill her mind with thoughts about working for her children and trying to make other people happy and with making embroidery which she loves to do, why wouldn't it help?  These new things she's thinking about would be like the strong, new grass seed that didn't give the weeds a chance to grow.\"  Dorothy stared seriously at Ethel Blue.  \"She does perfectly beautiful embroidery,\" she said slowly, as she tried to think out a way to put Ethel Blue's suggestion into effect. \"Do you suppose she'd be willing to teach us how to do it?  That beautiful Italian cut work, you know.  If we should call ourselves a class and ask her to teach us it might give her something quite new to think about.\"  \"I'd like to learn, too,\" agreed Ethel Blue.  \"I heard Mother say once that there was a school in New York for Italian lace work.  Let's get Delia to find out about it, and when Mrs. Paterno grows stronger and goes back to the city she might go there.  They have a shop uptown where they sell the pupils' work.  The class here and the prospect of having regular"]]]
