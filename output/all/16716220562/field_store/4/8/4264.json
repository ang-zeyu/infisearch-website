The great gallery, a hundred and fifty feet in length, the pride of the abbot's lodging, and a model of architecture, is filled not with white-robed ecclesiastics, but with an armed earl and his retainers. Neglected is the little oratory dedicated to Our Lady of Whalley, where night and morn the abbot used to pray. All the old religious and hospitable uses of the abbey are foregone. The reverend stillness of the cloisters, scarce broken by the quiet tread of the monks, is now disturbed by armed heel and clank of sword; while in its saintly courts are heard the ribald song, the profane jest, and the angry brawl. Of the brethren, only those tenanting the cemetery are left. All else are gone, driven forth, as vagabonds, with stripes and curses, to seek refuge where they may.  A sad, sad change has come over Whalley Abbey. In the plenitude of its pride and power has it been cast down, desecrated, despoiled. Its treasures are carried off, its ornaments sold, its granaries emptied, its possessions wasted, its storehouses sacked, its cattle slaughtered and sold. But, though stripped of its wealth and splendour; though deprived of all the religious graces that, like rich incense, lent an odour to the fane, its external beauty is yet unimpaired, and its vast proportions undiminished.  A stately pile was Whalley--one of the loveliest as well as the largest in the realm. Carefully had it been preserved by its reverend rulers, and where reparations or additions were needed they were judiciously made. Thus age had lent it beauty, by mellowing its freshness and toning its hues, while no decay was perceptible. Without a struggle had it yielded to the captor, so that no part of its wide belt of walls or towers, though so strongly constructed as to have offered effectual resistance, were injured.  Never had Whalley Abbey looked more beautiful than on a bright clear morning in March, when this sad change had been wrought, and when, from a peaceful monastic establishment, it had been converted into a menacing fortress. The sunlight sparkled upon its grey walls, and filled its three great quadrangular courts with light and life, piercing the exquisite carving of its cloisters, and revealing all the intricate beauty and combinations of the arches. Stains of painted glass fell upon the floor of the magnificent conventual church, and dyed with rainbow hues the marble tombs of the Lacies, the founders of the establishment, brought thither when the monastery was removed from Stanlaw in Cheshire, and upon the brass-covered gravestones of the abbots in the presbytery. There lay Gregory de Northbury, eighth abbot of Stanlaw and first of Whalley, and William Rede, the last abbot; but there was never to lie John Paslew. The slumber of the ancient prelates was soon to be disturbed, and the sacred structure within which they had so often worshipped, up-reared by sacrilegious hands. But all was bright and beauteous now, and if no solemn strains were heard in the holy pile, its stillness was scarcely less reverential and awe-inspiring. The old abbey wreathed itself in all its attractions, as if to welcome back its former ruler, whereas it was only to receive him as a captive doomed to a felon's death.  But this was outward show. Within all was terrible preparation. Such was the discontented state of the country, that fearing some new revolt, the Earl of Derby had taken measures for the defence of the abbey, and along the wide-circling walls of the close were placed ordnance and men, and within the grange stores of ammunition. A strong guard was set at each of the gates, and the courts were filled with troops. The bray of the trumpet echoed within the close, where rounds were set for the archers, and martial music resounded within the area of the cloisters. Over the great north-eastern gateway, which formed the chief entrance to the abbot's lodging, floated the royal banner. Despite these warlike proceedings the fair abbey smiled beneath the sun, in all, or more than all, its pristine beauty, its green hills sloping gently down towards it, and the clear and sparkling Calder dashing merrily over the stones at its base.  But upon the bridge, and by the river side, and within the little village, many persons were assembled, conversing gravely and anxiously together, and looking out towards the hills, where other groups were gathered, as if in expectation of some afflicting event. Most of these were herdsmen and farming men, but some among them were poor monks in the white habits of the Cistertian brotherhood, but which were now stained and threadbare, while their countenances bore traces of severest privation and suffering. All the herdsmen and farmers had been retainers of the abbot. The poor monks looked wistfully at their former habitation, but replied not except by a gentle bowing of the head to the cruel scoffs and taunts with which they were greeted by the passing soldiers; but the sturdy rustics did not bear these outrages so tamely, and more than one brawl ensued, in which blood flowed, while a ruffianly arquebussier would have been drowned in the Calder but for the exertions to save him of a monk whom he had attacked.  This took place on the eleventh of March, 1537--more than three months after the date of the watching by the beacon before recorded--and the event anticipated by the concourse without the abbey, as well as by those within its walls, was the arrival of Abbot Paslew and Fathers Eastgate and Haydocke, who were to be brought on that day from Lancaster, and executed on the following morning before the abbey, according to sentence passed upon them.  The gloomiest object in the picture remains to be described, but yet it is necessary to its completion. This was a gallows of unusual form and height, erected on the summit of a gentle hill, rising immediately in front of the abbot's lodgings, called the Holehouses, whose rounded, bosomy beauty it completely destroyed. This terrible apparatus of condign punishment was regarded with abhorrence by the rustics, and it required a strong guard to be kept constantly round it to preserve it from demolition.  Amongst a group of rustics collected on the road leading to the north-east gateway, was Cuthbert Ashbead, who having been deprived of his forester's office, was now habited in a frieze doublet and hose with a short camlet cloak on his shoulder, and a fox-skin cap, embellished with the grinning jaws of the beast on his head.  \"Eigh, Ruchot o' Roaph's,\" he observed to a bystander, \"that's a fearfo sect that gallas. Yoan been up to t' Holehouses to tey a look at it, beloike?\"  \"Naw, naw, ey dunna loike such sects,\" replied Ruchot o' Roaph's; \"besoide there wor a great rabblement at t' geate, an one o' them lunjus archer chaps knockt meh o' t' nob wi' his poike, an towd me he'd hong me wi' t' abbut, if ey didna keep owt ot wey.\"  \"An sarve te reet too, theaw craddinly carl!\" cried Ashbead, doubling his horny fists. \"Odds flesh! whey didna yo ha' a tussle wi' him? Mey honts are itchen for a bowt wi' t' heretic robbers. Walladey! walladey! that we should live to see t' oly feythers driven loike hummobees owt o' t' owd neest.

An dunna yo knoa that t' Abbuts o' Jervaux an Salley wor hongt o' Tizeday at Loncaster Castle?\"  \"Good lorjus bless us!\" exclaimed a sturdy hind, \"we'n a protty king. Furst he chops off his woife's heaod, an then hongs aw t' priests. Whot'll t' warlt cum 'to?  \"Eigh by t' mess, whot _win_ it cum to?\" cried Ruchot o' Roaph's. \"But we darrna oppen owr mows fo' fear o' a gog.\"  \"Naw, beleady! boh eyst oppen moine woide enuff,\" cried Ashbead; \"an' if a dozen o' yo chaps win join me, eyn try to set t' poor abbut free whon they brinks him here.\"  \"Ey'd as leef boide till to-morrow,\" said Ruchot o'Roaph's, uneasily.  \"Eigh, thou'rt a timmersome teyke, os ey towd te efore,\" replied Ashbead. \"But whot dust theaw say, Hal o' Nabs?\" he added, to the sturdy hind who had recently spoken.  \"Ey'n spill t' last drop o' meh blood i' t' owd abbut's keawse,\" replied Hal o' Nabs. \"We winna stond by, an see him hongt loike a dog. Abbut Paslew to t' reskew, lads!\"  \"Eigh, Abbut Paslew to t' reskew!\" responded all the others, except Ruchot o' Roaph's.  \"This must be prevented,\" muttered a voice near them. And immediately afterwards a tall man quitted the group.  \"Whoa wor it spoake?\" cried Hal o' Nabs. \"Oh, ey seen, that he-witch, Nick Demdike.\"  \"Nick Demdike here!\" cried Ashbead, looking round in alarm. \"Has he owerheert us?\"  \"Loike enow,\" replied Hal o' Nabs. \"But ey didna moind him efore.\"  \"Naw ey noather,\" cried Ruchot o' Roaph's, crossing himself, and spitting on the ground. \"Owr Leady o' Whalley shielt us fro' t' warlock!\"  \"Tawkin o' Nick Demdike,\" cried Hal o' Nabs, \"yo'd a strawnge odventer wi' him t' neet o' t' great brast o' Pendle Hill, hadna yo, Cuthbert?\"  \"Yeigh, t' firrups tak' him, ey hadn,\" replied Ashbead. \"Theawst hear aw abowt it if t' will.

Ey wur so glopp'nt, ey couldna speak, an' meh blud fruz i' meh veins, when ey heerd a fearfo voice ask Nick wheere his woife an' chilt were. 'The infant is unbaptised,' roart t' voice, 'at the next meeting it must be sacrificed. See that thou bring it.' Demdike then bowed to Summat I couldna see; an axt when t' next meeting wur to be held. 'On the night of Abbot Paslew's execution,' awnsert t' voice. On hearing this, ey could bear nah lunger, boh shouted out, 'Witches! devils! Lort deliver us fro' ye!' An' os ey spoke, ey tried t' barst thro' t' winda.

When I cum' to, I wur i' Nick Demdike's cottage, wi' his woife watching ower me, and th' unbapteesed chilt i' her arms.\"  All exclamations of wonder on the part of the rustics, and inquiries as to the issue of the adventure, were checked by the approach of a monk, who, joining the assemblage, called their attention to a priestly train slowly advancing along the road.  \"It is headed,\" he said, \"by Fathers Chatburne and Chester, late bursers of the abbey. Alack! alack! they now need the charity themselves which they once so lavishly bestowed on others.\"  \"Waes me!\" ejaculated Ashbead. \"Monry a broad merk han ey getten fro 'em.\"  \"They'n been koind to us aw,\" added the others.  \"Next come Father Burnley, granger, and Father Haworth, cellarer,\" pursued the monk; \"and after them Father Dinkley, sacristan, and Father Moore, porter.\"  \"Yo remember Feyther Moore, lads,\" cried Ashbead.  \"Yeigh, to be sure we done,\" replied the others; \"a good mon, a reet good mon! He never sent away t' poor--naw he!\"  \"After Father Moore,\" said the monk, pleased with their warmth, \"comes Father Forrest, the procurator, with Fathers Rede, Clough, and Bancroft, and the procession is closed by Father Smith, the late prior.\"  \"Down o' yer whirlybooans, lads, as t' oly feythers pass,\" cried Ashbead, \"and crave their blessing.\"  And as the priestly train slowly approached, with heads bowed down, and looks fixed sadly upon the ground, the rustic assemblage fell upon their knees, and implored their benediction. The foremost in the procession passed on in silence, but the prior stopped, and extending his hands over the kneeling group, cried in a solemn voice,  \"Heaven bless ye, my children! Ye are about to witness a sad spectacle. You will see him who hath clothed you, fed you, and taught you the way to heaven, brought hither a prisoner, to suffer a shameful death.\"  \"Boh we'st set him free, oly prior,\" cried Ashbead. \"We'n meayed up our moinds to 't. Yo just wait till he cums.\"  \"Nay, I command you to desist from the attempt, if any such you meditate,\" rejoined the prior; \"it will avail nothing, and you will only sacrifice your own lives. Our enemies are too strong. The abbot himself would give you like counsel.\"  Scarcely were the words uttered than from the great gate of the abbey there issued a dozen arquebussiers with an officer at their head, who marched directly towards the kneeling hinds, evidently with the intention of dispersing them. Behind them strode Nicholas Demdike. In an instant the alarmed rustics were on their feet, and Ruchot o' Roaph's, and some few among them, took to their heels, but Ashbead, Hal o' Nabs, with half a dozen others, stood their ground manfully. The monks remained in the hope of preventing any violence. Presently the halberdiers came up.  \"That is the ringleader,\" cried the officer, who proved to be Richard Assheton, pointing out Ashbead; \"seize him!\"  \"Naw mon shall lay honts o' meh,\" cried Cuthbert.  And as the guard pushed past the monks to execute their leader's order, he sprang forward, and, wresting a halbert from the foremost of them, stood upon his defence.  \"Seize him, I say!\" shouted Assheton, irritated at the resistance offered.  \"Keep off,\" cried Ashbead; \"yo'd best. Loike a stag at bey ey'm dawngerous. Waar horns! waar horns! ey sey.\"  The arquebussiers looked irresolute. It was evident Ashbead would only be taken with life, and they were not sure that it was their leader's purpose to destroy him.  \"Put down thy weapon, Cuthbert,\" interposed the prior; \"it will avail thee nothing against odds like these.\"  \"Mey be, 'oly prior,\" rejoined Ashbead, flourishing the pike: \"boh ey'st ony yield wi' loife.\"  \"I will disarm him,\" cried Demdike, stepping forward.  \"Theaw!\" retorted Ashbead, with a scornful laugh, \"Cum on, then. Hadsta aw t' fiends i' hell at te back, ey shouldna fear thee.\"  \"Yield!\" cried Demdike in a voice of thunder, and fixing a terrible glance upon him.  \"Cum on, wizard,\" rejoined Ashbead undauntedly. But, observing that his opponent was wholly unarmed, he gave the pike to Hal o' Nabs, who was close beside him, observing, \"It shall never be said that Cuthbert Ashbead feawt t' dule himsel unfairly. Nah, touch me if theaw dar'st.\"  Demdike required no further provocation. With almost supernatural force and quickness he sprung upon the forester, and seized him by the throat. But the active young man freed himself from the gripe, and closed with his assailant. But though of Herculean build, it soon became evident that Ashbead would have the worst of it; when Hal o' Nabs, who had watched the struggle with intense interest, could not help coming to his friend's assistance, and made a push at Demdike with the halbert.  Could it be that the wrestlers shifted their position, or that the wizard was indeed aided by the powers of darkness? None could tell, but so it was that the pike pierced the side of Ashbead, who instantly fell to the ground, with his adversary upon him. The next instant his hold relaxed, and the wizard sprang to his feet unharmed, but deluged in blood. Hal o' Nabs uttered a cry of keenest anguish, and, flinging himself upon the body of the forester, tried to staunch the wound; but he was quickly seized by the arquebussiers, and his hands tied behind his back with a thong, while Ashbead was lifted up and borne towards the abbey, the monks and rustics following slowly after; but the latter were not permitted to enter the gate.  As the unfortunate keeper, who by this time had become insensible from loss of blood, was carried along the walled enclosure leading to the abbot's lodging, a female with a child in her arms was seen advancing from the opposite side. She was tall, finely formed, with features of remarkable beauty, though of a masculine and somewhat savage character, and with magnificent but fierce black eyes. Her skin was dark, and her hair raven black, contrasting strongly with the red band wound around it. Her kirtle was of murrey-coloured serge; simply, but becomingly fashioned. A glance sufficed to show her how matters stood with poor Ashbead, and, uttering a sharp angry cry, she rushed towards him.  \"What have you done?\" she cried, fixing a keen reproachful look on Demdike, who walked beside the wounded man.  \"Nothing,\" replied Demdike with a bitter laugh; \"the fool has been hurt with a pike. Stand out of the way, Bess, and let the men pass. They are about to carry him to the cell under the chapter-house.\"  \"You shall not take him there,\" cried Bess Demdike, fiercely. \"He may recover if his wound be dressed. Let him go to the infirmary--ha, I forgot--there is no one there now.\"  \"Father Bancroft is at the gate,\" observed one of the arquebussiers; \"he used to act as chirurgeon in the abbey.\"  \"No monk must enter the gate except the prisoners when they arrive,\" observed Assheton; \"such are the positive orders of the Earl of Derby.\"  \"It is not needed,\" observed Demdike, \"no human aid can save the man.\"  \"But can other aid save him?\" said Bess, breathing the words in her husband's ears.  \"Go to!\" cried Demdike, pushing her roughly aside; \"wouldst have me save thy lover?\"  \"Take heed,\" said Bess, in a deep whisper; \"if thou save him not, by the devil thou servest! thou shalt lose me and thy child.\"  Demdike did not think proper to contest the point, but, approaching Assheton, requested that the wounded man might be conveyed to an arched recess, which he pointed out. Assent being given, Ashbead was taken there, and placed upon the ground, after which the arquebussiers and their leader marched off; while Bess, kneeling down, supported the head of the wounded man upon her knee, and Demdike, taking a small phial from his doublet, poured some of its contents clown his throat. The wizard then took a fold of linen, with which he was likewise provided, and, dipping it in the elixir, applied it to the wound.  In a few moments Ashbead opened his eyes, and looking round wildly,"]]]
