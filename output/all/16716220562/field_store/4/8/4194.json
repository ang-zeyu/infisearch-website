Mr. Jorrocks not keeping any \"sporting dogs,\" as the tax-papers call them, had borrowed a fat house-dog--a cross between a setter and a Dalmatian--of his friend Mr. Evergreen the greengrocer, which he had seen make a most undeniable point one morning in the Copenhagen Fields at a flock of pigeons in a beetroot garden. This valuable animal was now attached by a trash-cord through a ring in his brass collar to a leg of the sideboard, while a clean licked dish at his side, showed that Jorrocks had been trying to attach him to himself, by feeding him before starting.  \"We'll take a coach to the Castle\", said Jorrocks, \"and then get a go-cart or a cast somehow or other to Streatham, for we shall have walking enough when we get there. Browne is an excellent fellow, and will make us range every acre of his estate over half a dozen times before we give in\". A coach was speedily summoned, into which Jorrocks, the dog Pompey, the Yorkshireman, and the guns were speedily placed, and away they drove to the \"Elephant and Castle.\"  There were short stages about for every possible place except Streatham. Greenwich, Deptford, Blackheath, Eltham, Bromley, Footscray, Beckenham, Lewisham--all places but the right. However, there were abundance of \"go-carts,\" a species of vehicle that ply in the outskirts of the metropolis, and which, like the watering-place \"fly,\" take their name from the contrary--in fact, a sort of _lucus a non lucendo_. They are carts on springs, drawn by one horse (with curtains to protect the company from the weather), the drivers of which, partly by cheating, and partly by picking pockets, eke out a comfortable existence, and are the most lawless set of rascals under the sun. Their arrival at the \"Elephant and Castle\" was a signal for a general muster of the fraternity, who, seeing the guns, were convinced that their journey was only what they call \"a few miles down the road,\" and they were speedily surrounded by twenty or thirty of them, all with \"excellent 'osses, vot vould take their honours fourteen miles an hour.\" All men of business are aware of the advantages of competition, and no one more so than Jorrocks, who stood listening to their offers with the utmost sang-froid, until he closed with one to take them to Streatham Church for two shillings, and deliver them within the half-hour, which was a signal for all the rest to set-to and abuse them, their coachman, and his horse, which they swore had been carrying \"stiff-uns\" [14] all night, and \"could not go not none at all\". Nor were they far wrong; for the horse, after scrambling a hundred yards or two, gradually relaxed into something between a walk and a trot, while the driver kept soliciting every passer-by to \"ride,\" much to our sportsmen's chagrin, who conceived they were to have the \"go\" all to themselves. Remonstrance was vain, and he crammed in a master chimney-sweep, Major Ballenger the licensed dealer in tea, coffee, tobacco, and snuff, of Streatham (a customer of Jorrocks), and a wet-nurse; and took up an Italian organ-grinder to ride beside himself on the front, before they had accomplished Brixton Hill. Jorrocks swore most lustily that he would fine him, and at every fresh assurance, the driver offered a passer-by a seat; but having enlisted Major Ballenger into their cause, they at length made a stand, which, unfortunately for them, was more than the horse could do, for just as he was showing off, as he thought, with a bit of a trot, down they all soused in the mud. Great was the scramble; guns, barrel-organ, Pompey, Jorrocks, driver, master chimney-sweep, Major Ballenger, were all down together, while the wet-nurse, who sat at the end nearest the door, was chucked clean over the hedge into a dry ditch. This was a signal to quit the vessel, and having extricated themselves the best way they could, they all set off on foot, and left the driver to right himself at his leisure.  [Footnote 14: Doing a bit of resurrection work.]  Ballenger looked rather queer when he heard they were going to Nosey Browne's, for it so happened that Nosey had managed to walk into his books for groceries and kitchen-stuff to the tune of fourteen pounds, a large sum to a man in a small way of business; and to be entertaining friends so soon after his composition, seemed curious to Ballenger's uninitiated suburban mind.  Crossing Streatham Common, a short turn to the left by some yew-trees leads, by a near cut across the fields, to Browne's house; a fiery-red brick castellated cottage, standing on the slope of a gentle eminence, and combining almost every absurdity a cockney imagination can be capable of. Nosey, who was his own \"Nash,\" set out with the intention of making it a castle and nothing but a castle, and accordingly the windows were made in the loophole fashion, and the door occupied a third of the whole frontage. The inconveniences of the arrangements were soon felt, for while the light was almost excluded from the rooms, \"rude Boreas\" had the complete run of the castle whenever the door was opened. To remedy this, Nosey increased the one and curtailed the other, and the Gothic oak-painted windows and door flew from their positions to make way for modern plate-glass in rich pea-green casements, and a door of similar hue. The battlements, however, remained, and two wooden guns guarded a brace of chimney-pots and commanded the wings of the castle, one whereof was formed into a green-, the other into a gig-house.  The peals of a bright brass-handled bell at a garden-gate, surmounted by a holly-bush with the top cut into the shape of a fox, announced their arrival to the inhabitants of \"Rosalinda Castle,\" and on entering they discovered young Nosey in the act of bobbing for goldfish, in a pond about the size of a soup-basin; while Nosey senior, a fat, stupid-looking fellow, with a large corporation and a bottle nose, attired in a single-breasted green cloth coat, buff waistcoat, with drab shorts and continuations, was reposing, _sub tegmine fagi_, in a sort of tea-garden arbour, overlooking a dung-heap, waiting their arrival to commence an attack upon the sparrows which were regaling thereon. At one end of the garden was a sort of temple, composed of oyster-shells, containing a couple of carrier-pigeons, with which Nosey had intended making his fortune, by the early information to be acquired by them: but \"there is many a slip,\" as Jorrocks would say.  Greetings being over, and Jorrocks having paid a visit to the larder, and made up a stock of provisions equal to a journey through the Wilderness, they adjourned to the yard to get the other dog, and the man to carry the game--or rather, the prog, for the former was but problematical. He was a character, a sort of chap of all work, one, in short, \"who has no objection to make himself generally useful\"; but if his genius had any decided bent, it was, perhaps, an inclination towards sporting.  Having to act the part of groom and gamekeeper during the morning, and butler and footman in the afternoon, he was attired in a sort of composition dress, savouring of the different characters performed. He had on an old white hat, a groom's fustian stable-coat cut down into a shooting-jacket, with a whistle at the button-hole, red plush smalls, and top-boots.  There is nothing a cockney delights in more than aping a country gentleman, and Browne fancied himself no bad hand at it; indeed, since his London occupation was gone, he looked upon himself as a country gentleman in fact. \"Vell, Joe,\" said he, striddling and sticking his thumbs into the arm-holes of his waistcoat, to this invaluable man of all work, \"we must show the gemmem some sport to-day; vich do you think the best line to start upon--shall we go to the ten hacre field, or the plantation, or Thompson's stubble, or Timms's turnips, or my meadow, or vere?\" \"Vy, I doesn't know,\" said Joe; \"there's that old hen-pheasant as we calls Drab Bess, vot has haunted the plantin' these two seasons, and none of us ever could 'it (hit), and I hears that Jack, and Tom, and Bob, are still left out of Thompson's covey; but, my eyes! they're 'special vild!\" \"Vot, only three left? where is old Tom, and the old ramping hen?\" inquired Browne. \"Oh, Mr. Smith, and a party of them 'ere Bankside chaps, com'd down last Saturday's gone a week, and rattled nine-and-twenty shots at the covey, and got the two old 'uns; at least it's supposed they were both killed, though the seven on 'em only bagged one bird; but I heard they got a goose or two as they vent home. They had a shot at old Tom, the hare, too, but he is still alive; at least I pricked him yesterday morn across the path into the turnip-field. Suppose we goes at him first?\"  The estate, like the game, was rather deficient in quantity, but Browne was a wise man and made the most of what he had, and when he used to talk about his \"manor\" on 'Change, people thought he had at least a thousand acres--the extent a cockney generally advertises for, when he wants to take a shooting-place. The following is a sketch of what he had: The east, as far as the eye could reach, was bounded by Norwood, a name dear to cockneys, and the scene of many a furtive kiss; the hereditaments and premises belonging to Isaac Cheatum, Esq. ran parallel with it on the west, containing sixty-three acres, \"be the same more or less,\" separated from which, by a small brook or runner of water, came the estate of Mr. Timms, consisting of sixty acres, three roods, and twenty-four perches, commonly called or known by"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15398"],["title","Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Henry Bibb, an American Slave, Written (#0)"],["body","OF THE  LIFE AND ADVENTURES  OF  HENRY BIBB,  AN AMERICAN SLAVE,  WRITTEN BY HIMSELF.   WITH  AN INTRODUCTION  BY LUCIUS C. MATLACK.   NEW YORK: PUBLISHED BY THE AUTHOR; 5 SPRUCE STREET.  1849     INTRODUCTION.   From the most obnoxious substances we often see spring forth, beautiful and fragrant, flowers of every hue, to regale the eye, and perfume the air. Thus, frequently, are results originated which are wholly unlike the cause that gave them birth. An illustration of this truth is afforded by the history of American Slavery.  Naturally and necessarily, the enemy of literature, it has become the prolific theme of much that is profound in argument, sublime in poetry, and thrilling in narrative. From the soil of slavery itself have sprung forth some of the most brilliant productions, whose logical levers will ultimately upheave and overthrow the system. Gushing fountains of poetic thought, have started from beneath the rod of violence, that will long continue to slake the feverish thirst of humanity outraged, until swelling to a flood it shall rush with wasting violence over the ill-gotten heritage of the oppressor. Startling incidents authenticated, far excelling fiction in their touching pathos, from the pen of self-emancipated slaves, do now exhibit slavery in such revolting aspects, as to secure the execrations of all good men, and become a monument more enduring than marble, in testimony strong as sacred writ against it.  Of the class last named, is the narrative of the life of Henry Bibb, which is equally distinguished as a revolting portrait of the hideous slave system, a thrilling narrative of individual suffering, and a triumphant vindication of the slave's manhood and mental dignity. And all this is associated with unmistakable traces of originality and truthfulness.  To many, the elevated style, purity of diction, and easy flow of language, frequently exhibited, will appear unaccountable and contradictory, in view of his want of early mental culture. But to the thousands who have listened with delight to his speeches on anniversary and other occasions, these same traits will be noted as unequivocal evidence of originality. Very few men present in their written composition, so perfect a transcript of their style as is exhibited by Mr. Bibb.  Moreover, the writer of this introduction is well acquainted with his handwriting and style. The entire manuscript I have examined and prepared for the press. Many of the closing pages of it were written by Mr. Bibb in my office. And the whole is preserved for inspection now. An examination of it will show that no alteration of sentiment, language or style, was necessary to make it what it now is, in the hands of the reader. The work of preparation for the press was that of orthography and punctuation merely, an arrangement of the chapters, and a table of contents--little more than falls to the lot of publishers generally.  The fidelity of the narrative is sustained by the most satisfactory and ample testimony. Time has proved its claims to truth. Thorough investigation has sifted and analysed every essential fact alleged, and demonstrated clearly that this thrilling and eloquent narrative, though stranger than fiction, is undoubtedly true.  It is only necessary to present the following documents to the reader, to sustain this declaration. For convenience of reference, and that they may be more easily understood, the letters will be inserted consecutively, with explanations following the last.  The best preface to these letters, is the report of a committee appointed to investigate the truth of Mr. Bibb's narrative as he has delivered it in public for years past.                                 REPORT       OF THE UNDERSIGNED, COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY THE DETROIT      LIBERTY ASSOCIATION TO INVESTIGATE THE TRUTH OF THE      NARRATIVE OF HENRY BIBB, A FUGITIVE FROM SLAVERY, AND REPORT      THEREON:       Mr. Bibb has addressed several assemblies in Michigan, and      his narrative is generally known. Some of his hearers, among      whom were Liberty men, felt doubt as to the truth of his      statements. Respect for their scruples and the obligation of      duty to the public induced the formation of the present      Committee.       The Committee entered on the duty confided to them, resolved      on a searching scrutiny, and an unreserved publication of      its result. Mr. Bibb acquiesced in the inquiry with a      praiseworthy spirit. He attended before the Committee and      gave willing aid to its object. He was subjected to a      rigorous examination. Facts--dates--persons--and localities      were demanded and cheerfully furnished. Proper      inquiry--either by letter, or personally, or through the      medium of friends was then made from _every_ person, and in      _every_ quarter likely to elucidate the truth. In fact no      test for its ascertainment, known to the sense or experience      of the Committee, was omitted. The result was the collection      of a large body of testimony from very diversified quarters.      Slave owners, slave dealers, fugitives from slavery,      political friends and political foes contributed to a mass      of testimony, every part of which pointed to a common      conclusion--the undoubted truth of Mr. Bibb's statements.       In the Committee's opinion no individual can substantiate      the events of his life by testimony more conclusive and      harmonious than is now before them in confirmation of Mr.      Bibb. The main facts of his narrative, and many of the minor      ones are corroborated beyond all question. No inconsistency      has been disclosed nor anything revealed to create      suspicion. The Committee have no hesitation in declaring      their conviction that Mr. Bibb is amply sustained, and is      entitled to public confidence and high esteem.       The bulk of testimony precludes its publication, but it is      in the Committee's hands for the inspection of any      applicant.                                          A.L.

[No. 1. An Extract]            DAWN MILLS, FEB. 19th, 1845.       CHARLES H. STEWART, ESQ.      MY DEAR BROTHER:       Your kind communication of the 13th came to hand yesterday.      I have made inquiries respecting Henry Bibb which may be of      service to you. Mr. Wm. Harrison, to whom you alluded in      your letter, is here. He is a respectable and worthy man--a      man of piety. I have just had an interview with him this      evening. He testifies, that he was well acquainted with      Henry Bibb in Trimble County, Ky., and that he sent a letter      to him by Thomas Henson, and got one in return from him. He      says that Bibb came out to Canada some three years ago, and      went back to get his wife up, but was betrayed at Cincinnati      by a colored man--that he was taken to Louisville but got      away--was taken again and lodged in jail, and sold off to      New Orleans, or he, (Harrison,) understood that he was taken      to New Orleans. He testifies that Bibb is a Methodist man,      and says that two persons who came on with him last Summer,      knew Bibb. One of these, Simpson Young, is now at Malden.      * *  *            Very respectfully, thy friend,                                       HIRAM WILSON.         *       *       *       *       *       [No. 2.]                     BEDFORD, TRIMBLE CO., KENTUCKY.                                                  _March 4, 1845_.       SIR:--Your letter under date of the 13th ult., is now before      me, making some inquiry about a person supposed to be a      fugitive from the South, \"who is lecturing to your religious      community on Slavery and the South.\"       I am pleased to inform you that I have it in my power to      give you the information you desire. The person spoken of by      you I have no doubt is Walton, a yellow man, who once      belonged to my father, William Gatewood. He was purchased by      him from John Sibly, and by John Sibly of his brother Albert      G. Sibly, and Albert G. Sibly became possessed of him by his      marriage with Judge David White's daughter, he being born      Judge White's slave.       The boy Walton at the time he belonged to John Sibly,      married a slave of my father's, a mulatto girl, and sometime      afterwards solicited him to buy him; the old man after much      importuning from Walton, consented to do so, and accordingly      paid Sibly eight hundred and fifty dollars. He did not buy      him because he needed him, but from the fact that he had a      wife there, and Walton on his part promising every thing      that my father could desire.       It was not long, however, before Walton became indolent and      neglectful of his duty; and in addition to this, he was      guilty, as the old man thought, of worse offences. He      watched his conduct more strictly, and found he was guilty      of disposing of articles from the farm for his own use, and      pocketing the money.       He actually caught him one day stealing wheat--he had      conveyed one sack full to a neighbor and whilst he was      delivering the other my father caught him in the very act.       He confessed his guilt and promised to do better for the      future--and on his making promises of this kind my father      was disposed to keep him still, not wishing to part him from      his wife, for whom he professed to entertain the strongest      affection. When the Christmas Holidays came on, the old man,      as is usual in this country, gave his negroes a week      Holiday. Walton, instead of"]]]
