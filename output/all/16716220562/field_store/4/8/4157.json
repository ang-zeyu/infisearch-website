Macbeth does murder sleep,”—the innocent sleep; Sleep that knits up the ravell’d sleave of care, The death of each day’s life, sore labour’s bath, Balm of hurt minds, great nature’s second course, Chief nourisher in life’s feast.  LADY MACBETH. What do you mean?  MACBETH. Still it cried, “Sleep no more!” to all the house: “Glamis hath murder’d sleep, and therefore Cawdor Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more!”  LADY MACBETH. Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane, You do unbend your noble strength to think So brainsickly of things. Go get some water, And wash this filthy witness from your hand.— Why did you bring these daggers from the place? They must lie there: go carry them, and smear The sleepy grooms with blood.  MACBETH. I’ll go no more: I am afraid to think what I have done; Look on’t again I dare not.  LADY MACBETH. Infirm of purpose! Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures. ’Tis the eye of childhood That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed, I’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal, For it must seem their guilt.   [_Exit. Knocking within._]  MACBETH. Whence is that knocking? How is’t with me, when every noise appals me? What hands are here? Ha, they pluck out mine eyes! Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine, Making the green one red.   Enter Lady Macbeth.  LADY MACBETH. My hands are of your color, but I shame To wear a heart so white. [_Knocking within._] I hear knocking At the south entry:—retire we to our chamber. A little water clears us of this deed: How easy is it then! Your constancy Hath left you unattended.—[_Knocking within._] Hark, more knocking. Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers. Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts.  MACBETH. To know my deed, ’twere best not know myself. [_Knocking within._] Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE III. The same.   Enter a Porter. Knocking within.  PORTER. Here’s a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell gate, he should have old turning the key. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock, knock. Who’s there, i’ th’ name of Belzebub? Here’s a farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about you; here you’ll sweat for’t. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock! Who’s there, i’ th’ other devil’s name? Faith, here’s an equivocator, that could swear in both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough for God’s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come in, equivocator. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock, knock! Who’s there? Faith, here’s an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock. Never at quiet! What are you?—But this place is too cold for hell. I’ll devil-porter it no further: I had thought to have let in some of all professions, that go the primrose way to th’ everlasting bonfire. [_Knocking._] Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.   [_Opens the gate._]   Enter Macduff and Lennox.  MACDUFF. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, That you do lie so late?  PORTER. Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.  MACDUFF. What three things does drink especially provoke?  PORTER. Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him.  MACDUFF. I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.  PORTER. That it did, sir, i’ the very throat on me; but I requited him for his lie; and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.  MACDUFF. Is thy master stirring?   Enter Macbeth.  Our knocking has awak’d him; here he comes.  LENNOX. Good morrow, noble sir!  MACBETH. Good morrow, both!  MACDUFF. Is the King stirring, worthy thane?  MACBETH. Not yet.  MACDUFF. He did command me to call timely on him. I have almost slipp’d the hour.  MACBETH. I’ll bring you to him.  MACDUFF. I know this is a joyful trouble to you; But yet ’tis one.  MACBETH. The labour we delight in physics pain. This is the door.  MACDUFF. I’ll make so bold to call. For ’tis my limited service.   [_Exit Macduff._]  LENNOX. Goes the King hence today?  MACBETH. He does. He did appoint so.  LENNOX. The night has been unruly: where we lay, Our chimneys were blown down and, as they say, Lamentings heard i’ th’ air, strange screams of death, And prophesying, with accents terrible, Of dire combustion and confus’d events, New hatch’d to the woeful time. The obscure bird Clamour’d the live-long night. Some say the earth Was feverous, and did shake.  MACBETH. ’Twas a rough night.  LENNOX. My young remembrance cannot parallel A fellow to it.   Enter Macduff.  MACDUFF. O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!  MACBETH, LENNOX. What’s the matter?  MACDUFF. Confusion now hath made his masterpiece! Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope The Lord’s anointed temple, and stole thence The life o’ th’ building.  MACBETH. What is’t you say? the life?  LENNOX. Mean you his majesty?  MACDUFF. Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak. See, and then speak yourselves.   [_Exeunt Macbeth and Lennox._]  Awake, awake!— Ring the alarum bell.—Murder and treason! Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake! Shake off this downy sleep, death’s counterfeit, And look on death itself! Up, up, and see The great doom’s image. Malcolm! Banquo! As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites To countenance this horror!   [_Alarum-bell rings._]   Enter Lady Macbeth.  LADY MACBETH. What’s the business, That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!  MACDUFF. O gentle lady, ’Tis not for you to hear what I can speak: The repetition, in a woman’s ear, Would murder as it fell.   Enter Banquo.  O Banquo, Banquo! Our royal master’s murder’d!  LADY MACBETH. Woe, alas! What, in our house?  BANQUO. Too cruel anywhere.— Dear Duff, I pr’ythee, contradict thyself, And say it is not so.   Enter Macbeth and Lennox with Ross.  MACBETH. Had I but died an hour before this chance, I had liv’d a blessed time; for, from this instant There’s nothing serious in mortality. All is but toys: renown and grace is dead; The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of.   Enter Malcolm and Donalbain.  DONALBAIN. What is amiss?  MACBETH. You are, and do not know’t: The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood Is stopp’d; the very source of it is stopp’d.  MACDUFF. Your royal father’s murder’d.  MALCOLM. O, by whom?  LENNOX. Those of his chamber, as it seem’d, had done’t: Their hands and faces were all badg’d with blood; So were their daggers, which, unwip’d, we found Upon their pillows. They star’d, and were distracted; No man’s life was to be trusted with them.  MACBETH. O, yet I do repent me of my fury, That I did kill them.  MACDUFF. Wherefore did you so?  MACBETH. Who can be wise, amaz’d, temperate, and furious, Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man: Th’ expedition of my violent love Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan, His silver skin lac’d with his golden blood; And his gash’d stabs look’d like a breach in nature For ruin’s wasteful entrance: there, the murderers, Steep’d in the colours of their trade, their daggers Unmannerly breech’d with gore. Who could refrain, That had a heart to love, and in that heart Courage to make’s love known?  LADY MACBETH. Help me hence, ho!  MACDUFF. Look to the lady.  MALCOLM. Why do we hold our tongues, That most may claim this argument for ours?  DONALBAIN. What should be spoken here, where our fate, Hid in an auger hole, may rush, and seize us? Let’s away. Our tears are not yet brew’d.  MALCOLM. Nor our strong sorrow Upon the foot of motion.  BANQUO. Look to the lady:—   [_Lady Macbeth is carried out._]  And when we have our naked frailties hid, That suffer in exposure, let us meet, And question this most bloody piece of work To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us: In the great hand of God I stand; and thence Against the undivulg’d pretence I fight Of treasonous malice.  MACDUFF. And so do I.  ALL. So all.  MACBETH. Let’s briefly put on manly readiness, And meet i’ th’ hall together.  ALL. Well contented.   [_Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain._]  MALCOLM. What will you do? Let’s not consort with them: To show an unfelt sorrow is an office Which the false man does easy. I’ll to England.  DONALBAIN. To Ireland, I. Our separated fortune Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are, There’s daggers in men’s smiles: the near in blood, The nearer bloody.  MALCOLM. This murderous shaft that’s shot Hath not yet lighted; and our safest way Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse; And let us not be dainty of leave-taking, But shift away. There’s warrant in that theft Which steals itself, when there’s no mercy left.   [_Exeunt._]  SCENE IV. The same. Without the Castle.   Enter Ross and an Old Man.  OLD MAN. Threescore and ten I can remember well, Within the volume of which time I have seen Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night Hath trifled former knowings.  ROSS. Ha, good father, Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man’s act, Threatens his bloody stage: by the clock ’tis day, And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp. Is’t night’s predominance, or the day’s shame, That darkness does the face of earth"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1533"],["title","Macbeth (#4)"],["body",", When living light should kiss it?  OLD MAN. ’Tis unnatural, Even like the deed that’s done. On Tuesday last, A falcon, towering in her pride of place, Was by a mousing owl hawk’d at and kill’d.  ROSS. And Duncan’s horses (a thing most strange and certain) Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race, Turn’d wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out, Contending ’gainst obedience, as they would make War with mankind.  OLD MAN. ’Tis said they eat each other.  ROSS. They did so; to the amazement of mine eyes, That look’d upon’t. Here comes the good Macduff.   Enter Macduff.  How goes the world, sir, now?  MACDUFF. Why, see you not?  ROSS. Is’t known who did this more than bloody deed?  MACDUFF. Those that Macbeth hath slain.  ROSS. Alas, the day! What good could they pretend?  MACDUFF. They were suborn’d. Malcolm and Donalbain, the King’s two sons, Are stol’n away and fled; which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed.  ROSS. ’Gainst nature still: Thriftless ambition, that will ravin up Thine own life’s means!—Then ’tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.  MACDUFF. He is already nam’d; and gone to Scone To be invested.  ROSS. Where is Duncan’s body?  MACDUFF. Carried to Colmekill, The sacred storehouse of his predecessors, And guardian of their bones.  ROSS. Will you to Scone?  MACDUFF. No, cousin, I’ll to Fife.  ROSS. Well, I will thither.  MACDUFF. Well, may you see things well done there. Adieu! Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!  ROSS. Farewell, father.  OLD MAN. God’s benison go with you; and with those That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!   [_Exeunt._]   ACT III  SCENE I. Forres. A Room in the Palace.   Enter Banquo.  BANQUO. Thou hast it now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all, As the Weird Women promis’d; and, I fear, Thou play’dst most foully for’t; yet it was said It should not stand in thy posterity; But that myself should be the root and father Of many kings. If there come truth from them (As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine) Why, by the verities on thee made good, May they not be my oracles as well, And set me up in hope? But hush; no more.   Sennet sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Macbeth as Queen; Lennox,  Ross, Lords, and Attendants.  MACBETH. Here’s our chief guest.  LADY MACBETH. If he had been forgotten, It had been as a gap in our great feast, And all-thing unbecoming.  MACBETH. Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir, And I’ll request your presence.  BANQUO. Let your Highness Command upon me, to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tie For ever knit.  MACBETH. Ride you this afternoon?  BANQUO. Ay, my good lord.  MACBETH. We should have else desir’d your good advice (Which still hath been both grave and prosperous) In this day’s council; but we’ll take tomorrow. Is’t far you ride?  BANQUO. As far, my lord, as will fill up the time ’Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better, I must become a borrower of the night, For a dark hour or twain.  MACBETH. Fail not our feast.  BANQUO. My lord, I will not.  MACBETH. We hear our bloody cousins are bestow’d In England and in Ireland; not confessing Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers With strange invention. But of that tomorrow, When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu, Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?  BANQUO. Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon’s.  MACBETH. I wish your horses swift and sure of foot; And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.—   [_Exit Banquo._]  Let every man be master of his time Till seven at night; to make society The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself Till supper time alone: while then, God be with you.   [_Exeunt Lady Macbeth, Lords, &c._]  Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men Our pleasure?  SERVANT. They are, my lord, without the palace gate.  MACBETH. Bring them before us.   [_Exit Servant._]  To be thus is nothing, But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be fear’d: ’tis much he dares; And, to that dauntless temper of his mind, He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour To act in safety. There is none but he Whose being I do fear: and under him My genius is rebuk’d; as, it is said, Mark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters When first they put the name of king upon me, And bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like, They hail’d him father to a line of kings: Upon my head they plac’d a fruitless crown, And put a barren sceptre in my gripe, Thence to be wrench’d with an unlineal hand, No son of mine succeeding. If’t be so, For Banquo’s issue have I fil’d my mind; For them the gracious Duncan have I murder’d; Put rancours in the vessel of my peace Only for them; and mine eternal jewel Given to the common enemy of man, To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings! Rather than so, come, fate, into the list, And champion me to th’ utterance!—Who’s there?—   Enter Servant with two Murderers.  Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.   [_Exit Servant._]  Was it not yesterday we spoke together?  FIRST MURDERER. It was, so please your Highness.  MACBETH. Well then, now Have you consider’d of my speeches? Know That it was he, in the times past, which held you So under fortune, which you thought had been Our innocent self? This I made good to you In our last conference, pass’d in probation with you How you were borne in hand, how cross’d, the instruments, Who wrought with them, and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion craz’d Say, “Thus did Banquo.”  FIRST MURDERER. You made it known to us.  MACBETH. I did so; and went further, which is now Our point of second meeting. Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature, That you can let this go? Are you so gospell’d, To pray for this good man and for his issue, Whose heavy hand hath bow’d you to the grave, And beggar’d yours forever?  FIRST MURDERER. We are men, my liege.  MACBETH. Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men; As hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept All by the name of dogs: the valu’d file Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle, The housekeeper, the hunter, every one According to the gift which bounteous nature Hath in him clos’d; whereby he does receive Particular addition, from the bill That writes them all alike: and so of men. Now, if you have a station in the file, Not i’ th’ worst rank of manhood, say’t; And I will put that business in your bosoms, Whose execution takes your enemy off, Grapples you to the heart and love of us, Who wear our health but sickly in his life, Which in his death were perfect.  SECOND MURDERER. I am one, my liege, Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Hath so incens’d that I am reckless what I do to spite the world.  FIRST MURDERER. And I another, So weary with disasters, tugg’d with fortune, That I would set my life on any chance, To mend it or be rid on’t.  MACBETH. Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy.  BOTH MURDERERS. True, my lord.  MACBETH. So is he mine; and in such bloody distance, That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near’st of life; and though I could With barefac’d power sweep him from my sight, And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not, For certain friends that are both his and mine, Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall Who I myself struck down: and thence it is That I to your assistance do make love, Masking the business from the common eye For sundry weighty reasons.  SECOND MURDERER. We shall, my lord, Perform what you command us.  FIRST MURDERER. Though our lives—  MACBETH. Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most, I will advise you where to plant yourselves, Acquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ time, The moment on’t; for’t must be done tonight And something from the palace; always thought That I require a clearness. And with him (To leave no rubs nor botches in the work) Fleance his son, that keeps him company, Whose absence is no less material to me Than is his father’s, must embrace the fate Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart. I’ll come to you anon.  BOTH MURDERERS. We are resolv’d, my lord.  MACBETH. I’ll call upon you straight: abide within.   [_Exeunt Murderers._]  It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul’s flight, If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.   [_Exit._]  SCENE II. The same. Another Room in the Palace.   Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant.  LADY MACBETH. Is Banquo gone from court?  SERVANT. Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.  LADY MACBETH. Say to the King, I would attend his leisure For a few words.  SERVANT. Madam, I will.   [_Exit._]  LADY MACBETH. Naught’s had, all’s spent, Where our desire is got without content: ’Tis safer to be that which we destroy, Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.   Enter Macbeth.  How now, my lord, why do you keep alone, Of sorriest fancies your companions making, Using those thoughts which should indeed have died With them they think on? Things without all remedy Should be without regard: what’s done is done.  MACBETH. We have scorch’d the snake, not kill’d it. She’ll close, and be herself; whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth. But let the frame of things disjoint, Both the worlds suffer, Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead, Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave; After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well; Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison, Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing Can touch him further.  LADY MACBETH. Come on, Gently my lord, sleek o’er your rugged looks; Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.  MACBETH. So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you. Let your remembrance apply to Banquo; Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue: Unsafe the while, that "]]]
