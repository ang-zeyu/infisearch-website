As Mr. Waldemar Kaempffert, editor of _Popular Science Monthly,_ has said:      There is hardly a paper read before the Royal Institution or the     French Academy or our American engineering and chemical societies     that cannot be made dramatically interesting from a human standpoint     and that does not chronicle real news.  \"If you want to publish something where it will never be read,\" a wit has observed, \"print it in an official document.\" Government reports are filled with valuable information that remains quite unknown to the average reader unless newspapers and magazines unearth it and present it in popular form. The popularization of the contents of all kinds of scientific and technical publications affords great opportunities for the writer who can present such subjects effectively.  In addressing students of journalism on \"Science and Journalism,\" Dr. Edwin E. Slosson, literary editor of the _Independent_, who was formerly a professor of chemistry, has said:      The most radical ideas of our day are not apt to be found in the     popular newspaper or in queer little insurrectionary, heretical and     propaganda sheets that we occasionally see, but in the technical     journals and proceedings of learned societies. The real revolutions     are hatched in the laboratory and study. The papers read before the     annual meetings of the scientific societies, and for the most part     unnoticed by the press, contain more dynamite than was ever     discovered in any anarchist's shop. Political revolutions merely     change the form of government or the name of the party in power.     Scientific revolutions really turn the world over, and it never     settles back into its former position.         *       *       *       *       *      The beauty and meaning of scientific discoveries can be revealed to     the general reader if there is an intermediary who can understand     equally the language of the laboratory and of the street. The modern     journalist knows that anything can be made interesting to anybody,     if he takes pains enough with the writing of it. It is not     necessary, either, to pervert scientific truths in the process of     translation into the vernacular. The facts are sensational enough     without any picturesque exaggeration.         *       *       *       *       *      The field is not an unprofitable one even in the mercenary sense. To     higher motives the task of popularizing science makes a still     stronger appeal. Ignorance is the source of most of our ills.     Ignorant we must always be of much that we need to know, but there     is no excuse for remaining ignorant of what somebody on earth knows     or has known. Rich treasure lies hidden in what President Gilman     called \"the bibliothecal cairn\" of scientific monographs which piles     up about a university. The journalist might well exchange the     muckrake for the pick and dig it out.      Nothing could accelerate human progress more than to reduce the time     between the discovery of a new truth and its application to the     needs of mankind.... It is regarded as a great journalistic     achievement when the time of transmission of a cablegram is     shortened. But how much more important it is to gain a few years in     learning what the men who are in advance of their age are doing than     to gain a few seconds in learning what the people of Europe are     doing? This lag in intellectual progress ... is something which it     is the especial duty of the journalist to remove. He likes to score     a beat of a few hours. Very well, if he will turn his attention to     science, he can often score a beat of ten years.  The three main sources, therefore, of subjects and material for special feature and magazine articles are (1) personal observation and experience, (2) newspapers, (3) scientific and technical publications and official reports.  PERSONAL OBSERVATION. How a writer may discover subjects for newspaper feature articles in the course of his daily routine by being alive to the possibilities around him can best be shown by concrete examples.  A \"community sing\" in a public park gave a woman writer a good subject for a special article published in the _Philadelphia North American_.  In the publication of a city directory was found a timely subject for an article on the task of getting out the annual directory in a large city; the story was printed in a Sunday issue of the _Boston Herald_.  A glimpse of some children dressed like Arctic explorers in an outdoor school in Kansas City was evidently the origin of a special feature story on that institution, which was published in the _Kansas City Star_.  A woman standing guard one evening over a partially completed school building in Seattle suggested a special feature in the _Seattle Post Intelligencer_ on the unusual occupation of night \"watchman\" for a woman.  While making a purchase in a drug store, a writer overheard a clerk make a request for a deposit from a woman who desired to have a prescription filled, an incident which led him to write a special feature for the _New York Times_ on this method of discouraging persons from adding to the drug store's \"morgue\" of unclaimed prescriptions.  From a visit to the Children's Museum in Brooklyn was developed a feature article for the _New York Herald_, and from a story-telling hour at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts was evolved a feature story for the _Boston Herald_ on the telling of stories as a means of interesting children in pictures.  Magazine articles also may originate in the writer's observation of what is going on about him. The specific instances given below, like those already mentioned, will indicate to the inexperienced writer where to look for inspiration.  A newspaper reporter who covered the criminal courts compiled the various methods of burglars and sneak thieves in gaining entrance to houses and apartments, as he heard them related in trials, and wrote a helpful article for _Good Housekeeping_ on how to protect one's house against robbery.  The exhibition of a novel type of rack for curing seed corn gave a writer a subject for an article on this \"corn tree,\" which was published in the _Illustrated World_.  During a short stop at a farm while on an automobile trip, a woman writer noticed a concrete storage cellar for vegetables, and from an interview with the farmer obtained enough material for an article, which she sold to a farm journal.  While a woman writer was making a purchase in a plumber's shop, the plumber was called to the telephone. On returning to his customer, he remarked that the call was from a woman on a farm five miles from town, who could easily have made the slight repairs herself if she had known a little about the water-supply system on her farm. From the material which the writer obtained from the plumber, she wrote an article for an agricultural paper on how plumber's bills can be avoided.  A display of canned goods in a grocer's window, with special prices for dozen and case lots, suggested an article, afterwards published in the _Merchants Trade Journal_, on this grocer's method of fighting mail-order competition.  PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. What we actually do ourselves, as well as what we see others do, may be turned to good use in writing articles. Personal experiences not only afford good subjects and plenty of material but are more easily handled than most other subjects, because, being very real and vital to the writer, they can the more readily be made real and vital to the reader. Many inexperienced writers overlook the possibilities of what they themselves have done and are doing.  To gain experience and impressions for their articles, special writers on newspapers even assume temporarily the roles of persons whose lives and experiences they desire to portray. One Chicago paper featured every Sunday for many weeks articles by a reporter who, in order to get material, did a variety of things just for one day, from playing in a strolling street band to impersonating a convict in the state penitentiary. Thirty years ago, when women first entered the newspaper field as special feature writers, they were sometimes sent out on \"freak\" assignments for special features, such as feigning injury or insanity in order to gain entrance to hospitals in the guise of patients. Recently one woman writer posed as an applicant for a position as moving-picture actress; another applied for a place as housemaid; a third donned overalls and sorted scrap-iron all day in the yard of a factory; and still another accompanied a store detective on his rounds in order to discover the methods of shop-lifting with which department stores have to contend.  It is not necessary, however, to go so far afield to obtain personal experiences, as is shown by the following newspaper and magazine articles based on what the writers found in the course of their everyday pursuits.  The results obtained from cultivating a quarter-acre lot in the residence district of a city of 100,000 population were told by a writer in the _Country Gentleman_.  A woman's experience with bees was related in _Good Housekeeping_ under the title, \"What I Did with Bees.\"  Experience in screening a large porch on his house furnished a writer with the necessary information for a practical story in _Popular Mechanics_.  Some tests that he made on the power of automobiles gave a young engineer the suggestion for an article on the term \"horse power\" as applied to motor-cars; the article was published in the _Illustrated World_.  \"Building a Business on Confidence\" was the title of a personal experience article published in _System_.  The evils of tenant farming, as illustrated by the experiences of a farmer's wife in moving during the very early spring, were vividly depicted in an article in _Farm and Fireside_.  The diary of an automobile trip from Chicago to Buffalo was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15718"],["title","How To Write Special Feature Articles (#7)"],["body","in an article by a woman writer, which she sold to the _Woman's Home Companion_.  Both usual and unusual means employed to earn their college expenses have served as subjects for many special articles written by undergraduates and graduates.  Innumerable articles of the \"how-to-do-something\" type are accepted every year from inexperienced writers by publications that print such useful information. Results of experiments in solving various problems of household management are so constantly in demand by women's magazines and women's departments in newspapers, that housewives who like to write find a ready market for articles based on their own experience.  CONFESSION ARTICLES. One particular type of personal experience article that enjoys great popularity is the so-called \"confession story.\" Told in the first person, often anonymously, a well-written confession article is one of the most effective forms in which to present facts and experiences.  Personal experiences of others, as well as the writer's own, may be given in confession form if the writer is able to secure sufficiently detailed information from some one else to make the story probable.  A few examples will illustrate the kind of subjects that have been presented successfully in the confession form.  Some criticisms of a typical college and of college life were given anonymously in the _Outlook_ under the title, \"The Confessions of an Undergraduate.\"  \"The Story of a Summer Hotel Waitress,\" published in the _Independent_, and characterized by the editor as \"a frank exposure of real life below stairs in the average summer hotel,\" told how a student in a normal school tried to earn her school expenses by serving as a waitress during the summer vacation.  In _Farm and Fireside_ was published \"The Confession of a Timber Buyer,\" an article exposing the methods employed by some unscrupulous lumber companies in buying timber from farmers.  \"How I Cured Myself of Being Too Sensitive,\" with the sub-title, \"The Autobiography of a Young Business Man Who Nearly Went to Smash through Jealousy,\" was the subject of a confession article in the _American Magazine_.  An exposure of the impositions practiced by an itinerant quack was made in a series of three confession articles, in Sunday issues of the _Kansas City Star_, written by a young man whom the doctor had employed to drive him through the country districts.  To secure confession features from readers, magazines have offered prizes for the best short articles on such topics as, \"The Best Thing Experience has Taught Me,\" \"How I Overcame My Greatest Fault,\" \"The Day of My Great Temptation,\" \"What Will Power Did for Me.\"  SUBJECTS FROM THE DAY'S NEWS. In his search for subjects a writer will find numberless clues in newspapers. Since the first information concerning all new things is usually given to the world through the columns of the daily press, these columns are scanned carefully by writers in search of suggestions. Any part of the paper, from the \"want ads\" to the death notices or the real estate transfers, may be the starting point of a special article. The diversity of topics suggested by newspapers is shown by the following examples.  The death of a well-known clown in New York was followed by a special feature story about him in the Sunday magazine section of a Chicago paper.  A newspaper report of the discovery in Wisconsin of a method of eliminating printing ink from pulp made from old newspapers, so that white print paper might be produced from it, led a young writer to send for information to the discoverer of the process, and with these additional details he wrote an article that was published in the _Boston Transcript._  A news story about a clever swindler in Boston, who obtained possession of negotiable securities by means of a forged certified check, was made the basis of a special feature story in the _Providence Journal_ on the precautions to be taken against losses from forged checks.  News of the energetic manner in which a New Jersey sheriff handled a strike suggested a personality sketch of him that appeared in the _American Magazine_.  The publication, in a newspaper, of some results of a survey of rural school conditions in a Middle Western state, led to two articles on why the little red schoolhouse fails, one of which was published in the _Country Gentleman_, and the other in the _Independent_.  From a brief news item about the success of a farmer's widow and her daughter, in taking summer boarders in their old farmhouse, was developed a practical article telling how to secure and provide for these boarders on the ordinary farm. The article appeared in _Farm and Fireside_.  OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS. Bulletins and reports of government officials are a mine for both subjects and material. For new developments in agriculture one may consult the bulletins of the United States Department of Agriculture and those of state agricultural experiment stations. Reports on new and better methods of preparing food, and other phases of home economics, are also printed in these bulletins. State industrial commissions publish reports that furnish valuable material on industrial accidents, working-men's insurance, sanitary conditions in factories, and the health of workers. Child welfare is treated in reports of federal, state, and city child-welfare boards. The reports of the Interstate Commerce Commission, like those of state railroad commissions, contain interesting material on various phases of transportation. State and federal census reports often furnish good subjects and material. In short, nearly every official report of any kind may be a fruitful source of ideas for special articles.  The few examples given below suggest various possibilities for the use of these sources.  Investigations made by a commission of American medical experts constituting the Committee on Resuscitation from Mine Gases, under the direction of the U.S. Bureau of Mines, supplied a writer in the _Boston Transcript_ with material for a special feature story on the dangers involved in the use of the pulmotor.  A practical bulletin, prepared by the home economics department of a state university, on the best arrangement of a kitchen to save needless steps, was used for articles in a number of farm journals.  From a bulletin of the U.S. Department of Agriculture a writer prepared an article on \"the most successful farmer in the United States\" and what he did with twenty acres, for the department of \"Interesting People\" in the _American Magazine_.  The results of a municipal survey of Springfield, Illinois, as set forth in official reports, were the basis of an article in the _Outlook_ on \"What is a Survey?\" Reports of a similar survey at Lawrence, Kansas, were used for a special feature story in the _Kansas City Star_.  \"Are You a Good or a Poor Penman?\" was the title of an article in _Popular Science Monthly_ based on a chart prepared by the Russell Sage Foundation in connection with some of its educational investigations.  The _New York Evening Post_ published an interesting special article on the \"life tables\" that had been prepared by the division of vital statistics of the Bureau of the Census, to show the expectation of life at all ages in the six states from which vital statistics were obtained.  A special feature story on how Panama hats are woven, as printed in the _Ohio State Journal_, was based entirely on a report of the United States consul general at Guayaquil, Ecuador.  SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS. Almost every science and every art has its own special periodicals, from which can be gleaned a large number of subjects and much valuable material that needs only to be popularized to be made attractive to the average reader. The printed proceedings of scientific and technical societies, including the papers read at their meetings, as well as monographs and books, are also valuable. How such publications may be utilized is illustrated by the articles given below.  The report of a special committee of an association of electrical engineers, given at its convention in Philadelphia, furnished a writer with material for an article on \"Farming by Electricity,\" that was published in the Sunday edition of the _Springfield Republican_.  Studies of the cause of hunger, made by Prof. A.J. Carlson of the University of Chicago and published in a volume entitled \"The Control of Hunger in Health and Disease,\" furnished the subject for an article in the _Illustrated World._ Earlier results of the same investigation were given in the Sunday magazine of one of the Chicago papers.  From the _Journal of Heredity_ was gleaned material for an article entitled \"What Chance Has the Poor Child?\" It was printed in _Every Week_.  \"Golfer's Foot, One of Our Newest Diseases,\" was the subject of a special feature in the _New York Times_, that was based on an article in the _Medical Record_.  That the canals on Mars may be only an optical illusion was demonstrated in an article in the Sunday magazine of the _New York Times_, by means of material obtained from a report of the section for the Observation of Mars, a division of the British Astronomical Association.  ANTICIPATING TIMELY SUBJECTS. By looking forward for weeks or even months, as editors of Sunday newspapers and of magazines are constantly doing, a writer can select subjects and gather material for articles that will be particularly appropriate at a given time. Holidays, seasonal events, and anniversaries may thus be anticipated, and special articles may be sent to editors some time in advance of the occasion that makes them timely. Not infrequently it is desirable to begin collecting material a year before the intended time of publication.  An article on fire prevention, for instance, is appropriate for the month of October just before the day set aside for calling attention to fires caused by carelessness. Months in advance, a writer might begin collecting news stories"]]]
