He declared that he thought the trip on the steam yacht would be even more interesting than the one on the houseboat had been.  \"We're after something definite this trip,\" he said. \"We've got something to look forward to specially if that Sid Merrick starts a rival hunt.\"  \"We want to get ahead of Merrick,\" answered Dick. \"We want to locate Treasure Isle and get the gold and jewels before he knows what we are up to.\"  \"What's the name of the steam yacht.\"  \"The _Rainbow_.\"  \"That's a good name, for a rainbow is a sign of good promise,\" was Songbird's comment.  The party had to make one change of cars and had their dinner on the train. They arrived at the Grand Central Depot at half past two o'clock and the Rovers went to a nearby hotel, taking Aleck with them, while Songbird hurried off to transact his business with his uncle.  Mr. Rover had to meet some men who were interested in his mining ventures in the far west, and so, after accommodations had been obtained, he hurried off, leaving the boys to their own devices.  \"Let us take a stroll down Broadway,\" suggested Sam, to whom the sights of this busy thoroughfare were always interesting.  The others were willing, and they passed through Forty second street to Broadway and then turned southward. The street was filled with wagons, trucks and trolley cars, and the sidewalk appeared to \"overflow with folks,\" as Sam said. At one point a man was giving some sort of an exhibition in a store window and here the crowd was so great they had to walk out into the gutter to get past.  \"I can tell you one thing,\" remarked Dick. \"There is after all but one New York and no other city is like it.\"  The boys walked slowly as far as Union Square and then sat down on one of the park benches to rest. Nearly all the benches were filled with people and in idle curiosity Dick began to scan the various types of men present, from bright, brisk clerks to fat and unshaved bummers, too lazy to work.  \"Hullo!\"  Dick uttered the exclamation so abruptly that Sam and Tom were startled.  \"What do you see?\" queried both.  \"Look there!\"  They gazed in the direction Dick pointed out and on a distant bench saw a youth of about Tom's age, but heavier set, talking to a man who wore a rusty suit of brown and a peculiarly shaped slouch hat.  \"Why, that's Tad Sobber!\" cried Tom.  \"So it is,\" added Sam. \"Who is that fellow with him?\"  \"I don't know, although his figure looks somewhat familiar to me,\" answered Dick.  \"What can Tad be doing in New York?\" questioned Tom. \"Do you suppose he is down here with Sid Merrick?\"  \"Perhaps.\"  \"Let's go over and see what he has to say for himself,\" suggested Sam. \"Maybe he'll run away when he sees us.\"  All of the boys were curious to know what the former bully of Putnam Hall might have to say for himself and they strode over to the bench upon which Sobber and the man in brown were sitting. They came up behind the pair.  \"I can't give you any money, Cuffer,\" they heard Tad Sobber say. \"You'll have to wait till my Uncle Sid gets here.\"  \"When will he get to New York?\"  \"To morrow.\"  \"That fellow is Cuffer, the man who ran away from us at the old mill!\" cried Dick.  \"Let us catch him and hand him over to the police,\" returned Tom.  In his excitement he talked rather loudly and this attracted the attention of Cuffer and Tad Sobber.  \"The Rovers!\" cried Sobber, leaping to his feet in consternation. \"How did they get down to New York?\"  \"Who did you say?\" questioned Cuffer, and then looking at the three youths his face blanched. \"We must get away from here, and be quick about it!\"  He started to run and Dick and Sam went after him. The chase led to the lower end of the little park, and then Cuffer crossed Fourteenth street, and amid the crowd bound homeward for the day, pushed his way in the direction of the Third Avenue elevated railroad station.  In the meantime Tad Sobber started to run in another direction. But before he had taken a dozen steps Tom was on him and had him by the arm.  \"Stop, Sobber,\" he said shortly.  \"I won't! You let me go, Tom Rover.\"  \"I'll not let you go,\" answered Tom, firmly. \"And if you don't stand still I'll call a policeman and have you arrested.\"     CHAPTER IX  A CHASE ON THE BOWERY   Tom's threat to have Tad Sobber arrested caused the former bully of the school to pause and turn pale.  \"You--er--you don't mean that,\" he faltered. \"You can't have me arrested.\"  \"We'll see about that, Sobber.\"  \"I haven't done anything wrong.\"  \"Then why did you run away from Putnam Hall?\"  \"I had a right to leave. Captain Putnam wasn't treating me fairly.\"  \"You ran away on account of that snake affair--you can't deny it.\"  \"Humph!\"  \"That snake nearly killed Nick Pell. He isn't over it yet, altogether.\"  \"Bah! It wasn't the snake made Nick sick. He wasn't feeling well some days before the snake bit him.\"  \"It was the snake and nothing else put him in bed,\" answered Tom warmly. \"And that is not all. You are in league with your uncle, who robbed my uncle of those traction company bonds.\"  \"I--er--I don't know anything about that matter,\" answered Sobber, hastily.  \"Well, I know all about it. You were with your uncle when he got away from us, and when he dropped the pocketbook containing the bonds.\"  \"Did you get the bonds back?\" asked Sobber, with sudden interest. It may be added here that Sid Merrick had gone back long after the chase to look for the pocketbook, but, of course, had been unable to get any trace of it.  \"We did.\"  \"My uncle didn't steal them. Your uncle put them in his hands to sell,\" went on Tad Sobber, with sudden boldness. \"It is all a cooked up story about his running away with them. And it's a cooked up story about his having anything to do with those freight thieves. My uncle is an honest man.\"  \"I know all about the freight affair, for I overheard him talking to some of the other thieves,\" answered Tom. \"Where is your uncle now?\"  \"Do you think I'd be fool enough to tell you?\"  \"Perhaps you might--if I had you locked up.\"  \"My uncle is a good long way from New York.\"  \"I heard you tell that man your uncle would be in the city to-morrow.\"  \"I didn't say any such thing!\" burst out Sobber, but his manner showed that he was very much disturbed.  \"You did say it. Where are you stopping?\"  \"Nowhere--I only got in a few hours ago.\"  \"Did you come here to meet Cuffer?\"  \"What do you know about Cuffer?\"  \"I know your uncle hired him and a man named Shelley to visit our farm and get some things belonging to my father.\"  \"Why, you're crazy! My uncle hardly knows Cuffer--and I never heard of a man named Shelley.\"  \"I am not crazy, and you know I am speaking the truth,\" answered Tom, calmly. \"Now you tell me where your uncle is or I'll have you arrested.\"  \"You'll not arrest me!\" exclaimed Tad Sobber, and with a sudden movement he twisted himself free from Tom's grasp. \"You follow me and you'll get the worst of it!\" he added, and darted across the park at top speed.  Tom made after the bully, but as luck would have it a nurse girl with a baby carriage got between them and before Tom could clear himself of the carriage Sobber was a good distance away. He turned to the eastward, down a side street where a large building was in the course of erection. He looked back and then skipped into the unfinished building.  \"He shan't catch me,\" he muttered to himself, and ran to the rear of the building, amid piles of bricks and concrete blocks. A number of workmen were present, but nobody noticed him.  Reaching the building Tom peered inside, but saw nothing of the bully. He was about to go in when a warning cry reached him from overhead.  \"Get back there, unless you want to be hurt!\"  Tom looked up and saw a workman in the act of throwing down a mass of rubbish, broken bricks, sticks and old mortar. He leaped back and the stuff descended in front of him and raised a cloud of dust.  \"What do you want here, young man?\" demanded the superintendent of the building as he came forward.  \"I am after a boy who just ran in here.\"  \"Nobody here that I saw.\"  \"He just came in.\"  \"We don't allow skylarking around here. You make yourself scarce,\" and the superintendent waved Tom away.  \"I want to have that fellow arrested--that is why he ran away from me.\"  \"Oh, that's a different thing. Go find him, if you can.\"  The superintendent stepped aside and Tom entered the building. But the delay had cost him dear, for in the meanwhile Tad Sobber had made good his escape by running back to the next street. Tom looked around for over quarter of an hour and then gave up the chase.  \"It's too bad, but it can't be helped,\" he mused. \"I may as well go back to the park and wait for Dick and Sam. I hope they caught that Cuffer.\"  While Tom was talking to Sobber the other Rover boys had followed Cuffer to the elevated railroad station. A train was just coming in and Cuffer bounded up the steps two at a time, with the boys not far behind.  \"Stop that man!\" cried Dick, to the crowd coming from the train. But before anybody would or could act, Cuffer had slipped past the man at the ticket box and was trying to board one of the cars. Dick essayed to follow, but the ticket box guard stopped him.  \"Not to fast, young fellow. Where's your ticket?\"  \"I must catch that man--he is wanted by the police,\" answered Dick.  \"That's an old dodge, but it don't work with me, see? You go back and get a ticket,\" said the gateman, firmly.  \"But he'll get away from me,\" pleaded the eldest Rover.  \"If he does, it's not my fault. You can't pass here without a ticket.\"  By this time the train was almost ready to start. But Sam had procured tickets and he rushed up.  \"There are two tickets!\" he cried. \"Come on, Dick!\" and he sprinted for the train.

THE HAPPY END     VOLUME ONE   CHAPTER I.  AT THE COUNTRY-HOUSE ON THE RHINE.   The golden sunshine of a glorious June morning flooded the roses of the beautiful garden that surrounded a handsome stone villa on the banks of the Rhine. A thousand sweet perfumes borne upon the gentle breeze mounted like incense to the open windows, and sought entrance there. From a great basin in the middle of the garden, a slender shaft of water rose straight up into the blue sky, and then fell plashing back, sprinkling the flowers and the grass with sparkling moisture. Gay butterflies fluttered hither and thither, sipping sweets from the honey-laden flowers. Under the trees stood marble statues gleaming white through the shadows; and seats in sheltered nooks invited the loiterer to rest and listen to the concert of the myriad birds that made their happy homes in this paradise of summer beauty.  At the closed window of one of the upper rooms of this delightful house sat a little maiden, pressing her pale face against the wide, clear glass, as she peered out with longing eyes over the roses, toward the wavering fountain, and into the depths of the trees, whose graceful branches stirred in the light breeze. Her gaze passed over the shining flowers and the green terraces of the sunny garden, and rested far away on the glistening waves of the fast-flowing Rhine, that ran past the foot of the garden, bathing caressingly the long over-hanging branches of the old linden trees as it passed along. The rich foliage of the trees by the river-side was visible from the windows of the house; but not the stone bench which stood in the cool shade, so close to the water that one could look from it directly down into the eddying waves, and watch the drooping branches dip and rise again and again, as if in pure delight. What a spot for summer dreaming and castle-building! The pale child at the window knew the place well; and as her eyes turned in that direction, the expression of longing grew more and more painful as she gazed.  \"Oh, mamma!\" she cried presently, with tears in her voice, \"may I not go out soon into the garden, and down to the seat under the lindens by the river?\"  An hour before, the mother had brought her suffering little girl into this room, and placed her in her favorite resting-place in the window-seat, and her anxious gaze had scarcely left the pale little face, with its big eyes full of pain, that looked so longingly into the beautiful garden, which the poor child could not enjoy in any other way.  \"Dear child,\" she said now, in a voice which trembled with anxiety and affection, \"you know that you are too tired to go out in the morning; but this afternoon, perhaps, we will go down to the river. Will not that be better, my darling?\"  \"Oh, yes, I suppose so,\" sighed the child; but though she said no more, she did not turn her eyes away from the blooming roses and the waving leaves below her.  \"Oh, it is so beautiful down there! Do let me go out, mamma!\" she exclaimed again a little while afterwards. \"Do let me go!\" and her mother could not resist the beseeching tones. She arose, and at that moment an elderly woman entered the room--a woman who looked so exquisitely neat that one would have thought that she had no other business in life than that of keeping in perfect order her gray hair, with its snow-white cap, and her simple, spotless dress; but, on the contrary, she was the house-keeper, and had the whole charge of the big house, with all its complicated domestic arrangements. Both mother and daughter exclaimed on seeing her, \"Oh, Clarissa, how glad I am that you've come!\" And both began to ask her opinion as to the visit to the garden, which the invalid so longed for, but which her mother hesitated to grant.  Clarissa was a person of rare character, and a tower of strength in this household, where, from the lady of the house down to the lowest servant, her word was followed as law and obeyed with affection; and one took into the clear depths of her honest, loving eyes explained the secret of her power: they were \"Mother's eyes.\"  \"Say 'yes,' Clarissa, and let us go,\" begged the child, pathetically.  \"The air is soft, all the birds are singing and calling us: why should we not try it to-day, dear Mrs. Stanhope?\" said Clarissa.  \"Yes; if you think best, we will,\" answered the mother. And Frederic, the tall footman, was summoned to carry the little girl down the long staircase and out of the house. Then, once out-of-doors, the two women, supporting the child tenderly between them, led her through the sunny garden.  \"Nora, are you happy now?\" asked the mother, tenderly.  \"Yes; it is beautiful here,\" replied the child; \"but I should like to go down to the stone bench by the river-side, where the branches dip into the water.\"  So they went on over the green terraces to the water-side, down to the seat almost hidden under the lindens, among the clusters of whose pendent, sweet-smelling blossoms the bees were busy, mingling their deep murmur with the song which the Rhine sang in passing. Nora's eyes followed the dancing waves that seemed like living, happy sprites.  \"Oh! how I wish that I could leap and dance so, mamma! away! away! but I am so tired; I am always tired. I long to hop about as the birds do up in the trees there, and sing and be merry; but I am always so tired.\"  \"My darling, when you are stronger you will dance,\" replied her mother, in a cheerful tone; but her looks belied her voice, for she was far from feeling the confidence which she tried to give.  \"The doctor is coming to-day, and we will ask him what we can do this summer to make you stronger. Now we must go back to the house, Nora; you look pale and ill, my child. Is anything more than usual the matter with you?\"  Nora assured her mother that she was only tired. After any unusual exertion, her face always grew paler and her expression more suffering. She reached the house with difficulty, and, when Frederic had carried her up to her bed-room, she lay on the sofa a long time without moving, thoroughly exhausted.  The doctor came towards noon, and declared that a complete change of air would be the best thing for the little Nora, who certainly seemed to be losing strength daily. He would write to a physician, a friend of his in Switzerland, to find a suitable place for her, and would come again as soon as he received an answer.  Towards evening, Nora sat once more in the window, gazing wearily at the long slanting rays of the setting sun that fell across the greensward in golden radiance, and lighted up the rose-leaves till they shone like lamps among the flowers. Clarissa sat at her work-table by Nora's side and from time to time, she raised her head and looked sadly at the frail form that lay so motionless in the window-seat.  \"Clarissa,\" said the child, presently, \"will you repeat the old song of Paradise to me?\"  Clarissa laid aside her work.  \"We will sing it together again some day, dear child, when you are strong enough; now I will say it to you if you wish\" and she folded her hands and began:--      \"A stream of water, crystal bright,       Flows down through meadows green,     Where lilies, shining in the light,       Like twinkling starlets gleam.      \"And roses blow, and roses glow,       While birds in every tree     Are singing loud, are singing low,       'In Paradise are we.'      \"Here, gently blows the soft, sweet wind;       Bright flowers grow all around;     Men wake, as from a dream, to find       They tread on holy ground.      \"In blissful happiness they rove,       At peace with each and all;     United now in bonds of love,       Freed from the grave's dark pall.      \"All want and weariness are o'er,       All sorrow and all pain;     Their rapture gathers more and more;       The sick are well again.\"  After Clarissa had finished her recitation, no sound broke the stillness for a long time; Nora seemed lost in thought. \"Clarissa,\" she said at last, \"that is a beautiful poem, and makes me long to go.\"  \"Yes; go willingly, go gladly, dear child,\" replied Clarissa, with tears in her eyes. \"Then you can wander joyfully among the bright flowers, and sing:      \"'Our rapture gathers more and more;       The sick are well again.'  \"And we shall soon join you there, your mamma and I--\"  At this moment the mother entered, and Clarissa stopped suddenly; for she knew well that Mrs. Stanhope could not endure the thought of losing little Nora, even though her child were called to heaven; but the mother had heard enough of what had been said, and looked at the child with renewed anxiety. Nora certainly looked very pale and weary; and, at her mother's request, she let herself be carried at once to bed in Clarissa's strong and tender arms.  Later in the evening when Mrs. Stanhope sat"]]]
