By means of this Instrument I can with _little trouble_, and a very small quantity of any _Liquor_, examine, most accurately, the _refraction_ of it not only for one inclination, but for all; and thereby am inabled to make very accurate Tables; several of which I have also experimentally made, and find, that _Oyl of Turpentine_ has a much greater Refraction then _Spirit of Wine_, though it be _lighter_; and that _Spirit of Wine_ has a greater Refraction then _Water_, though it be lighter also; but that _salt Water_ also has a greater Refraction then _fresh_, though it be _heavier_: but _Alum water_ has a less refraction then common _Water_, though heavier also. So that it seems, as to the _refraction_ made in a Liquor, the _specifick gravity_ is of no efficacy. By this I have also found that look what _proportion _the _Sine_ of the Angle of _one Inclination_ has to the _Sine_ of the Angle of _Refraction_, correspondent to it, the same _proportion_ have all the _Sines_ of other Inclinations to the _Sines_ of their appropriate Refractions.      My way for measuring how much a Glass magnifies an Object, plac’d at a     convenient distance from my eye, is this. Having rectifi’d the     _Microscope_, to see the desir’d Object through it very distinctly, at     the same time that I look upon the Object through the Glass with one     eye, I look upon other Objects at the same distance with my other bare     eye; by which means I am able, by the help of a _Ruler_ divided into     inches and small parts, and laid on the _Pedestal_ of the _Microscope_,     to cast, as it were, the magnifi’d appearance of the Object upon the     Ruler, and thereby exactly to measure the Diameter it appears of     through the Glass, which being compar’d with the Diameter it appears of     to the naked eye, will easily afford the quantity of its magnifying.      The _Microscope_, which for the most part I made use of, was shap’d     much like that in the sixth Figure of the first _Scheme_, the Tube     being for the most part not above six or seven inches long, though, by     reason it had four Drawers, it could very much be lengthened, as     occasion required; this was contriv’d with three Glasses; a small     Object Glass at A, a thinner Eye Glass about B, and a very deep one     about C: this I made use of only when I had occasion to see much of an     Object at once; the middle Glass conveying a very great company of     radiating Pencils, which would go another way, and throwing them upon     the deep Eye Glass. But when ever I had occasion to examine the small     parts of a Body more accurately, I took out the middle Glass, and only     made use of one Eye Glass with the Object Glass, for always the fewer     the Refractions are, the more bright and clear the Object appears. And     therefore ’tis not to be doubted, but could we make a_ Microscope _to     have one only refraction, it would, _cæteris paribus_, far excel any     other that had a greater number. And hence it is, that if you take a     very clear piece of a broken _Venice_ Glass, and in a Lamp draw it out     into very small hairs or threads, then holding the ends of these     threads in the flame, till they melt and run into a small round Globul,     or drop, which will hang at the end of the thread; and if further you     stick several of these upon the end of a stick with a little sealing     Wax, so as that the threads stand upwards, and then on a Whetstone     first grind off a good part of them, and afterward on a smooth Metal     plate, with a little Tripoly, rub them till they come to be very     smooth; if one of these be fixt with a little soft Wax against a small     needle hole, prick’d through a thin Plate of Brass, Lead, Pewter, or     any other Metal, and an Object, plac’d very near, be look’d at through     it, it will both magnifie and make some Objects more distinct then any     of the great _Microscopes_. But because these, though exceeding easily     made, are yet very troublesome to be us’d, because of their smalness,     and the nearness of the Object; therefore to prevent both these, and     yet have only two Refractions, I provided me a Tube of Brass, shap’d     much like that in the fourth Figure of the first _Scheme_; into the     smaller end of this I fixt with Wax a good _plano convex_ Object Glass,     with the convex side towards the Object, and into the bigger end I fixt     also with wax a pretty large plano _Convex_ Glass, with the _convex_     side towards my eye, then by means of the small hole by the side, I     fill’d the intermediate space between these two Glasses with very clear     Water, and with a Screw stopp’d it in; then putting on a Cell for the     Eye, I could perceive an Object more bright then I could when the     intermediate space was only fill’d with Air, but this, for other     inconveniences, I made but little use of.      My way for fixing both the Glass and Object to the Pedestal most     conveniently was thus: Upon one side of a round Pedestal AB, in the     sixth Figure of the first _Scheme_, was fixt a small Pillar CC, on this     was fitted a small Iron Arm D, which could be mov’d up and down, and     fixt in any part of the Pillar, by means of a small Screw E; on the end     of this Arm was a small Ball fitted into a kind of socket F, made in     the side of the Brass Ring G, through which the small end of the Tube     was screw’d; by means of which contrivance I could place and fix the     Tube in what posture I desir’d (which for many Observations was     exceeding necessary) and adjusten it most exactly to any Object.      For placing the Object, I made this contrivance; upon the end of a     small brass Link or Staple HH, I so fastned a round Plate II, that it     might be turn’d round upon its Center K, and going pretty stiff, would     stand fixt in any posture it was set; on the side of this was fixt a     small Pillar P, about three quarters of an inch high, and through the     top of this was thrust a small Iron pin M, whose top just stood over     the Center of the Plate; on this top I fixt a small Object, and by     means of these contrivances I was able to turn it into all kind of     positions, both to my Eye and the Light; for by moving round the small     Plate on its center, could move it one way, and by turning the Pin M, I     could move it another way, and this without stirring the Glass at all,     or at least but very little; the Plate likewise I could move to and fro     to any part of the Pedestal (which in many cases was very convenient)     and fix it also in any Position, by means of a Nut N, which was screw’d     on upon the lower part of the Pillar CC. All the other Contrivances are     obvious enough from the draught, and will need no description.  Now though this were the Instrument I made most use of, yet I have made several other Tryals with other kinds of Microscopes, which both for _matter_ and _form_ were very different from common spherical Glasses. I have made a _Microscope_ with one piece of Glass, both whose surfaces were _plains_. I have made another only with a _plano concave_, without any kind of reflection, divers also by means of _reflection_. I have made others of _Waters_, _Gums_, _Resins_, _Salts_, _Arsenick_, _Oyls_, and with divers other _mixtures of watery_ and _oyly Liquors_. And indeed the subject is capable of a great variety; but I find generally none more useful then that which is made with _two Glasses_, such as I have already describ’d.  What the things are I observ’d, the following descriptions will manifest; in brief, they were either _exceeding small Bodies_, or _exceeding small Pores_, or _exceeding small Motions_, some of each of which the Reader will find in the following Notes, and such, as I presume, (many of them at least) will be _new_, and perhaps not less _strange_: Some _specimen_ of each of which Heads the Reader will find in the subsequent delineations, and indeed of some more then I was willing there should be; which was occasioned by my first Intentions to print a much greater number then I have since found time to compleat. Of such therefore as I had, I selected only some few of every Head, which for some particulars seem’d most observable, rejecting the rest as superfluous to the present Design.  What each of the delineated Subjects are, the following descriptions annext to each will inform, of which I shall here, only once for all, add, That in divers of them the Gravers have pretty well follow’d my directions and draughts; and that in making of them, I indeavoured (as far as I was able) first to discover the true appearance, and next to make a plain representation of it. This I mention the rather, because of these kind of Objects there is much more difficulty to discover the true shape, then of those visible to the naked eye, the same Object seeming quite differing, in one position to the Light, from what it really is, and may be discover’d in another. And therefore I never began to make any draught before by many examinations in several lights, and in several positions to those lights, I had discover’d the true form. For it is exceeding difficult in some Objects, to distinguish between a _prominency_ and a _depression_, between a _shadow_ and a _black stain_, or a _reflection_ and a _whiteness in the colour_. Besides, the transparency of most Objects renders them yet much more difficult then if they were _opacous_. The Eyes of a Fly in one kind of light appear almost like a Lattice, drill’d through with abundance of small holes; which probably may be the Reason, why the Ingenious _Dr. Power_ seems to suppose them such. In the Sunshine they look like a Surface cover’d with golden Nails; in another posture, like a Surface cover’d with Pyramids; in another with Cones; and in other postures of quite"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15491"],["title","Micrographia (#7)"],["body"," shapes; but that which exhibits the best, is the Light collected on the Object, by those means I have already describ’d.  And this was undertaken in prosecution of the Design which the _ROYAL SOCIETY_ has propos’d to it self. For the Members of the Assembly having before their eys so many _fatal_ Instances of the errors and falshoods, in which the greatest part of mankind has so long wandred, because they rely’d upon the strength of humane Reason alone, have begun anew to correct all _Hypotheses_ by sense, as Seamen do their _dead Reckonings_ by _Cœlestial Observations_; and to this purpose it has been their principal indeavour to _enlarge & strengthen_ the _Senses_ by _Medicine_, and by such _outward Instruments_ as are proper for their particular works. By this means they find some reason to suspect, that those effects of Bodies, which have been commonly attributed to _Qualities_, and those confess’d to be _occult_, are perform’d by the small _Machines_ of Nature, which are not to be discern’d without these helps, seeming the meer products of _Motion_, _Figure_, and _Magnitude_; and that the _Natural Textures_, which some call the _Plastick faculty_, may be made in _Looms_, which a greater perfection of Opticks may make discernable by these Glasses; so as now they are no more puzzled about them, then the vulgar are to conceive, how _Tapestry_ or _flowred Stuffs_ are woven. And the ends of all these Inquiries they intend to be the _Pleasure_ of Contemplative minds, but above all, the _ease and dispatch_ of the labours of mens hands. They do indeed neglect no opportunity to bring all the _rare_ things of Remote Countries within the compass of their knowledge and practice. But they still acknowledg their _most useful_ Informations to arise from _common_ things, and from _diversifying_ their most _ordinary_ operations upon them. They do not wholly reject Experiments of meer _light_ and _theory_; but they principally aim at such, whose Applications will _improve and facilitate_ the present way of _Manual Arts_. And though some men, who are perhaps taken up about less honourable Employments, are pleas’d to censure their proceedings, yet they can shew more _fruits_ of their first three years, wherein they have assembled, then any other _Society_ in _Europe_ can for a much larger space of time. ’Tis true, such undertakings as theirs do commonly meet with small incouragement, because men are generally rather taken with the _plausible_ and _discursive_, then the _real_ and the solid part of Philosophy; yet by the good fortune of their institution, in an Age of all others the most _inquisitive_, they have been assisted by the _contribution_ and _presence_ of very many of the chief _Nobility_ and _Gentry_, and others who are some of the _most considerable_ in their several Professions. But that that yet farther convinces me of the _Real esteem_ that the more _serious_ part of men have of this _Society_, is, that several _Merchants_, men who act in earnest (whose Object is _meum & tuum_, that great _Rudder_ of humane affairs) have adventur’d considerable sums of _Money_, to put in practice what some of our Members have contrived, and have continued _stedfast_ in their good opinions of such Indeavours, when not one of a hundred of the vulgar have believed their undertakings feasable. And it is also fit to be added, that they have one advantage peculiar to themselves, that very many of their number are _men of Converse and Traffick_; which is a good Omen, that their attempts will bring Philosophy from _words_ to _action_, seeing the men of Business have had so great a share in their first foundation.  And of this kind I ought not to conceal one particular _Generosity_, which more nearly concerns my self. It is the _munificence_ of _Sir John Cutler_, in endowing a Lecture for the promotion of _Mechanick Arts_, to be governed and directed by This _Society._This _Bounty_ I mention for the _Honourableness_ of the thing it self, and for the expectation which I have of the _efficacy_ of the _Example_; for it cannot now be objected to them, that their Designs will be esteemed _frivolous_ and _vain_, when they have such a _real Testimony_ of the _Approbation_ of a _Man_ that is such an _eminent Ornament_ of this renowned City, and one, who, by the _Variety_, and the _happy Success_, of his negotiations, has given evident proofs, that he is not easie to be deceiv’d. This Gentleman has well observ’d, that the _Arts_ of life have been too long _imprison’d_ in the dark shops of Mechanicks themselves, & there _hindred from growth_, either by ignorance, or self-interest: and he has bravely _freed_ them from these _inconveniences_: He hath not only obliged _Tradesmen_, but _Trade_ it self: He has done a work that is worthy of _London_, and has taught the chief City of Commerce in the world the right way how Commerce is to be improv’d. We have already seen many other great signs of Liberality and a large mind, from the same hand: For by his _diligence_ about the _Corporation for the Poor_; by his honorable _Subscriptions_ for the rebuilding of St. Paul’s; by his chearful _Disbursment_ for the replanting of _Ireland_, and by many other such _publick works_, he has shewn by what means he indeavours to _establish_ his Memory; and now by this last gift he has done that, which became one of the _wisest Citizens_ of our Nation to accomplish, seeing one of the _wisest of our Statesmen, the Lord Verulam_, first propounded it.  But to return to my Subject, from a digression, which, I hope, my Reader will pardon me, seeing the Example is so rare that I can make no more such digressions. If these my first Labours shall be any wayes useful to inquiring men, I must attribute the incouragement and promotion of them to a very _Reverend_ and _Learned Person_, of whom this ought in justice to be said, _That there is scarce any one Invention, which this Nation has produc’d in our Age, but it has some way or other been set forward by his assistance_. My Reader, I believe, will quickly ghess, that it is _Dr. Wilkins_ that I mean. He is indeed a man born for the _good_ of _mankind_, and for the _honour_ of his _Country_. In the _sweetness_ of whose _behaviour_, in the _calmness_ of his _mind_, in the _unbounded goodness_ of his _heart_, we have an evident Instance, what the true and the _primitive unpassionate Religion_ was, before it was _sowred_ by particular _Factions._ In a word, his _Zeal_ has been so _constant_ and _effectual_ in advancing all good and profitable _Arts, that_ as one of the Antient _Romans_ said of _Scipio_, _That he thanked God that he was a _Roman_; because whereever _Scipio_ had been born, there had been the seat of the Empire of the world_: So may I thank God, that _Dr. Wilkins_ was an _Englishman_, for whereever he had lived, there had been the chief Seat of _generous Knowledge_ and _true Philosophy_. To the truth of this, there are so many worthy men living that will subscribe, that I am confident, what I have here said, will not be looked upon, by any ingenious Reader, as a _Panegyrick_, but only as a _real testimony_.  By the Advice of this _Excellent man_ I first set upon this Enterprise, yet still came to it with much _Reluctancy_, because I was to follow the footsteps of so eminent a Person as _Dr. Wren_, who was the first that attempted any thing of this nature; whose original draughts do now make one of the Ornaments of that great Collection of Rarities in the _Kings Closet_. This _Honor_, which his first beginnings of this kind have receiv’d, to be admitted into the most famous place of the world, did not so much _incourage_, as the _hazard_ of coming after _Dr. Wren_ did _affright_ me; for of him I must affirm, that, since the time of _Archimedes_, there scarce ever met in one man, in so great a perfection, such a _Mechanical Hand_, and so _Philosophical_ a _Mind_.  But at last, being assured both by _Dr. Wilkins_, and _Dr. Wren_ himself, that he had given over his intentions of prosecuting it, and not finding that there was any else design’d the pursuing of it, I set upon this undertaking, and was not a little incourag’d to proceed in it, by the Honour the _Royal Society_ was pleas’d to favour me with, in approving of those draughts (which from time to time as I had an opportunity of describing) I presented to them. And particularly by the Incitements of divers of those Noble and excellent Persons of it, which were my more especial Friends, who were not less urgent with me for the publishing, then for the prosecution of them.  After I had almost compleated these Pictures and Observations (having had divers of them engraven, and was ready to send them to the Press) I was inform’d, that the Ingenious Physitian _Dr. Henry Power_ had made several _Microscopical_ Observations, which had I not afterwards, upon our interchangably viewing each others Papers, found that they were for the most part differing from mine, either in the Subject it self, or in the particulars taken notice of; and that his design was only to print Observations without Pictures, I had even then _suppressed_ what I had so far proceeded in. But being further _excited_ by several of my Friends, in compliance with their opinions, that it would not be unacceptable to several inquisitive Men, and hoping also, that I should thereby discover something New to the World, I have at length cast in my Mite, into the vast Treasury of _A Philosophical History_. And it is my _hope_, as well as _belief_, that these my _Labours_ will be no more comparable to the _Productions_ of many other _Natural Philosophers_, who are now every where busie about _greater_ things; then my _little Objects_ are to be compar’d to the greater and more beautiful _Works of Nature_, A Flea, a Mite, a Gnat, to an Horse, an Elephant, or a Lyon.          *       *       *       *       *   MICROGRAPHIA,  OR SOME  Physiological Descriptions  OF  MINUTE BODIES,  MADE BY  MAGNIFYING GLASSES;  WITH "]]]
