If this was orthodoxy--and the proof that it was is evident--it was of a sort that might well sour and embitter the nature of man and fill the gentle soul of womanhood with fear and dark forebodings. We well know that the Puritans thoroughly believed that man's nature was weak and sinful, and that the human soul was a prisoner placed here upon earth by the Creator to be surrounded with temptations. This God is good, however, in that he has given man an opportunity to overcome the surrounding evils.      \"But I'm a prisoner,       Under a heavy chain;     Almighty God's afflicting hand,       Doth me by force restrain.             *       *       *       *       *      \"But why should I complain       That have so good a God,     That doth mine heart with comfort fill       Ev'n whilst I feel his rod?             *       *       *       *       *      \"Let God be magnified,       Whose everlasting strength     Upholds me under sufferings       Of more than ten years' length.\"  The _Day of Doom_ is, in the main, its author's vision of judgment day, and, whatever artistic or theological defects it may have, it undeniably possesses realism. For instance, several stanzas deal with one of the most dreadful doctrines of the Puritan faith, that all infants who died unbaptized entered into eternal torment--a theory that must have influenced profoundly the happiness and woe of colonial women. The poem describes for us what was then believed should be the scene on that final day when young and old, heathen and Christian, saint and sinner, are called before their God to answer for their conduct in the flesh. Hear the plea of the infants, who dying, at birth before baptism could be administered, asked to be relieved from punishment on the grounds that they have committed no sin.      \"If for our own transgression,       or disobedience,     We here did stand at thy left hand,       just were the Recompense;     But Adam's guilt our souls hath spilt,       his fault is charg'd upon us;     And that alone hath overthrown and utterly       undone us.\"  Pointing out that it was Adam who ate of the tree and that they were innocent, they ask:      \"O great Creator, why was our nature       depraved and forlorn?     Why so defil'd, and made so vil'd,       whilst we were yet unborn?     If it be just, and needs we must       transgressors reckon'd be,     Thy mercy, Lord, to us afford,       which sinners hath set free.\"  But the Creator answers:      \"God doth such doom forbid,     That men should die eternally       for what they never did.     But what you call old Adam's fall,       and only his trespass,     You call amiss to call it his,       both his and yours it was.\"  The Judge then inquires why, since they would have received the pleasures and joys which Adam could have given them, the rewards and blessings, should they hesitate to share his \"treason.\"      \"Since then to share in his welfare,       you could have been content,     You may with reason share in his treason,       and in the punishment,     Hence you were born in state forlorn,       with natures so depraved     Death was your due because that you       had thus yourselves behaved.             *       *       *       *       *      \"Had you been made in Adam's stead,       you would like things have wrought,     And so into the self-same woe       yourselves and yours have brought.\"  Then follows a reprimand upon the part of the judge because they should presume to question His judgments, and to ask for mercy:      \"Will you demand grace at my hand,       and challenge what is mine?     Will you teach me whom to set free,       and thus my grace confine.      \"You sinners are, and such a share       as sinners may expect;     Such you shall have, for I do save       none but mine own Elect.      \"Yet to compare your sin with theirs       who liv'd a longer time,     I do confess yours is much less       though every sin's a crime.      \"A crime it is, therefore in bliss       you may not hope to dwell;     But unto you I shall allow       the easiest room in Hell.\"  Would not this cause anguish to the heart of any mother? Indeed, we shall never know what intense anxiety the Puritan woman may have suffered during the few days intervening between the hour of the birth and the date of the baptism of her infant. It is not surprising, therefore, that an exceedingly brief period was allowed to elapse before the babe was taken from its mother's arms and carried through snow and wind to the desolate church. Judge Sewall, whose _Diary_ covers most of the years from 1686 to 1725, and who records every petty incident from the cutting of his finger to the blowing off of the Governor's hat, has left us these notes on the baptism of some of his fourteen children:  \"April 8, 1677. Elizabeth Weeden, the Midwife, brought the infant to the third Church when Sermon was about half done in the afternoon ... I named him John.\" (Five days after birth.)[3] \"Sabbath-day, December 13th 1685. Mr. Willard baptizeth my Son lately born, whom I named Henry.\" (Four days after birth.)[4] \"February 6, 1686-7. Between 3 and 4 P.M. Mr. Willard baptized my Son, whom I named Stephen.\" (Five days after birth.)[5]  Little wonder that infant mortality was exceedingly high, especially when the baptismal service took place on a day as cold as this one mentioned by Sewall: \"Sabbath, Janr. 24 ... This day so cold that the Sacramental Bread is frozen pretty hard, and rattles sadly as broken into the Plates.\"[6] We may take it for granted that the water in the font was rapidly freezing, if not entirely frozen, and doubtless the babe, shrinking under the icy touch, felt inclined to give up the struggle for existence, and decline a further reception into so cold and forbidding a world. Once more hear a description by the kindly, but abnormally orthodox old Judge: \"Lord's Day, Jany 15, 1715-16. An extraordinary Cold Storm of Wind and Snow.... Bread was frozen at the Lord's Table: Though 'twas so Cold, yet John Tuckerman was baptised. At six a-clock my ink freezes so that I can hardly write by a good fire in my Wive's Chamber. Yet was very Comfortable at Meeting. Laus Deo.\"[7]  But let us pass to other phases of this theology under which the Puritan woman lived. The God pictured in the _Day of Doom_ not only was of a cruel and angry nature but was arbitrary beyond modern belief. His wrath fell according to his caprice upon sinner or saint. We are tempted to inquire as to the strange mental process that could have led any human being to believe in such a Creator. Regardless of doctrine, creed, or theology, we cannot totally dissociate our earthly mental condition from that in the future state; we cannot refuse to believe that we shall have the same intelligent mind, and the same ability to understand, perceive, and love. Apparently, however, the Puritan found no difficulty in believing that the future existence entailed an entire change in the principles of love and in the emotions of sympathy and pity.        \"He that was erst a husband pierc'd         with sense of wife's distress,       Whose tender heart did bear a part         of all her grievances.       Shall mourn no more as heretofore,           because of her ill plight,       Although he see her now to be           a damn'd forsaken wight.        \"The tender mother will own no other           of all her num'rous brood       But such as stand at Christ's right hand,           acquitted through his Blood.       The pious father had now much rather           his graceless son should lie       In hell with devils, for all his evils,           burning eternally.\"                        (_Day of Doom._)  But we do not have to trust to Michael Wigglesworth's poem alone for a realistic conception of the God and the religion of the Puritans. It is in the sermons of the day that we discover a still more unbending, harsh, and hideous view of the Creator and his characteristics. In the thunderings of Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards, we, like the colonial women who sat so meekly in the high, hard benches, may fairly smell the brimstone of the Nether World. Why, exclaims Jonathan Edwards in his sermon, _The Eternity of Hell Torments_:  \"Do but consider what it is to suffer extreme torment forever and ever; to suffer it day and night, from one day to another, from one year to another, from one age to another, from one thousand ages to another, and so, adding age to age, and thousands to thousands, in pain, in wailing and lamenting, groaning and shrieking, and gnashing your teeth; with your souls full of dreadful grief and amazement, with your bodies and every member full of racking torture, without any possibility of getting ease; without any possibility of moving God to pity by your cries; without any possibility of hiding yourselves from him.... How dismal will it be, when you are under these racking torments, to know assuredly that you never, never shall be delivered from them; to have no hope; when you shall wish that you might but be turned into nothing, but shall have no hope of it; when you shall wish that you might be turned into a toad or a serpent, but shall have no hope of it; when you would rejoice, if you might but have any relief, after you shall have endured these torments millions of ages, but shall have no hope of it; when after you shall have worn out the age of the sun, moon, and stars, in your dolorous groans and lamentations, without any rest day or night, when after you shall have worn out a thousand more such ages, yet you shall have no hope, but shall know that you are not one whit nearer to the end of your torments; but that still there are the same groans, the same shrieks, the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15488"],["title","Woman's Life in Colonial Days (#4)"],["body","doleful cries, incessantly to be made by you, and that the smoke of your torment shall still ascend up, forever and ever; and that your souls, which shall have been agitated with the wrath of God all this while, yet will still exist to bear more wrath; your bodies, which shall have been burning and roasting all this while in these glowing flames, yet shall not have been consumed, but will remain to roast through an eternity yet, which will not have been at all shortened by what shall have been past.\"  When we remember that to the Puritan man, woman, or child the message of the preacher meant the message of God, we may imagine what effect such words had on a colonial congregation. To the overwrought nerves of many a Puritan woman, taught to believe meekly the doctrines of her father, and weakened in body by ceaseless childbearing and unending toil, such a picture must indeed have been terrifying. And the God that she and her husband heard described Sabbath after Sabbath was not only heartily willing to condemn man to eternal torment but capable of enjoying the tortures of the damned, and gloating in strange joy over the writhings of the condemned. Is it any wonder that in the midst of Jonathan Edward's sermon, _Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God_, men and women sprang to their feet and shrieked in anguish, \"What shall we do to be saved?\"  \"The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one holds a spider, or some loathsome insect, over the fire, abhors you and is dreadfully provoked; his wrath towards you burns like fire; he looks upon you as worthy of nothing else but to be cast into the fire; he is of purer eyes than to bear to have you in his sight; you are ten thousand times as abominable in his eyes, as the most hateful and venomous serpent is in ours. You have offended him infinitely more than ever a stubborn rebel did his prince; and yet it is nothing but his hand that holds you from falling into the fire every moment; it is ascribed to nothing else that you did not go to hell the last night; that you was suffered to awake again in this world, after you closed your eyes to sleep; and there is no other reason to be given why you have not dropped into hell since you arose in the morning, but that God's hand has held you up; there is no other reason to be given why you have not gone to hell, since you have sat here in the house of God, provoking his pure eyes by your sinful wicked manner of attending his solemn worship: yea, there is nothing else that is to be given as a reason why you do not this very moment drop down into hell.\"  Under such teachings the girl of colonial New England grew into womanhood; with such thoughts in mind she saw her children go down into the grave; with such forebodings she herself passed out into an uncertain Hereafter. Nor was there any escape from such sermons; for church attendance was for many years compulsory, and even when not compulsory, was essential for those who did not wish to be politically and socially ostracized. The preachers were not, of course, required to give proof for their declarations; they might well have announced, \"Thus saith the Lord,\" but they preferred to enter into disquisitions bristling with arguments and so-called logical deductions. For instance, note in Edwards' sermon, _Why Saints in Glory will Rejoice to see the Torments of the Damned_, the chain of reasoning leading to the conclusion that those enthroned in heaven shall find joy in the unending torture of their less fortunate neighbors:  \"They will rejoice in seeing the _justice_ of God glorified in the sufferings of the damned. The misery of the damned, dreadful as it is, is but what justice requires. They in heaven will see and know it much more clearly than any of us do here. They will see how perfectly just and righteous their punishment is and therefore how properly inflicted by the supreme Governor of the world.... They will rejoice when they see him who is their Father and eternal portion so glorious in his justice. The sight of this strict and immutable justice of God will render him amiable and adorable in their eyes. It will occasion rejoicing in them, as they will have the greater sense of _their own happiness_, by seeing the contrary misery. It is the nature of pleasure and pain, of happiness and misery, greatly to heighten the sense of each other.... When they shall see how miserable others of their fellow-creatures are, who were naturally in the same circumstances with themselves; when they shall see the smoke of their torment, and the raging of the flames of their burning, and hear their dolorous shrieks and cries, and consider that they in the meantime are in the most blissful state, and shall surely be in it to all eternity; how will they rejoice!... When they shall see the dreadful miseries of the damned, and consider that they deserved the same misery, and that it was sovereign grace, and nothing else, which made them so much to differ from the damned, that if it had not been for that, they would have been in the same condition; but that God from all eternity was pleased to set his love upon them, that Christ hath laid down his life for them, and hath made them thus gloriously happy forever, O how will they adore that dying love of Christ, which has redeemed them from so great a misery, and purchased for them so great happiness, and has so distinguished them from others of their fellow-creatures!\"  It was a strange creed that led men to teach such theories. And when we learn that Jonathan Edwards was a man of singular gentleness and kind-heartedness, we realize that it must have tortured him to preach such doctrines, but that he believed it his sacred duty to do so.  The religion, however, that the Puritan woman imbibed from girlhood to old age went further than this; it taught the theory of a personal devil. To the New England colonists Satan was a very real individual capable of taking to himself a physical form with the proverbial tail, horns, and hoofs. Hear what Cotton Mather, one of the most eminent divines of early Massachusetts, has to say in his _Memorable Providences_ about this highly personal Satan: \"There is both a God and a Devil and Witchcraft: That there is no out-ward Affliction, but what God may (and sometimes doth) permit Satan to trouble his people withal: That the Malice of Satan and his Instruments, is very great against the Children of God: That the clearest Gospel-Light shining in a place, will not keep some from entering hellish Contracts with infernal Spirits: That Prayer is a powerful and effectual Remedy against the malicious practices of Devils and those in Covenant with them.\"[8]  And His Satanic Majesty had legions of followers, equally insistent on tormenting humanity. In _The Wonders of the Invisible World_, published in 1692, Mather proves that there is a devil and that the being has specific attributes, powers, and limitations:       \"A devil is a fallen angel, an angel fallen from the fear and      love of God, and from all celestial glories; but fallen to all      manner of wretchedness and cursedness.... There are multitudes,      multitudes, in the valley of destruction, where the devils are!      When we speak of the devil, 'tis a name of multitude.... The      devils they swarm about us, like the frogs of Egypt, in the most      retired of our chambers. Are we at our boards? beds? There will      be devils to tempt us into carnality. Are we in our shops? There      will be devils to tempt us into dishonesty. Yea, though we get      into the church of God, there will be devils to haunt us in the      very temple itself, and there tempt us to manifold misbehaviors.      I am verily persuaded that there are very few human affairs      whereinto some devils are not insinuated. There is not so much as      a journey intended, but Satan will have an hand in hindering or      furthering of it.\"       \"...'Tis to be supposed, that there is a sort of arbitrary, even      military government, among the devils.... These devils have a      prince over them, who is king over the children of pride. 'Tis      probable that the devil, who was the ringleader of that mutinous      and rebellious crew which first shook off the authority of God,      is now the general of those hellish armies; our Lord that      conquered him has told us the name of him; 'tis Belzebub; 'tis he      that is the devil and the rest are his angels, or his      soldiers.... 'Tis to be supposed that some devils are more      peculiarly commission'd, and perhaps qualify'd, for some      countries, while others are for others.... It is not likely that      every devil does know every language; or that every devil can do      every mischief. 'Tis possible that the experience, or, if I may      call it so, the education of all devils is not alike, and that      there may be some difference in their abilities....\"  What was naturally the effect of such a faith upon the sensitive nerves of the women of those days? Viewed in its larger aspects this was an objective, not a subjective religion. It could but make the sensitive soul super-sensitive, introspective, morbidly alive to uncanny and weird suggestions, and strangely afraid of the temptation of enjoying earthly pleasures. Its followers dared not allow themselves to become deeply attached to anything temporal; for such an emotion was the device of the devil, and God would surely remove the object of such affection. Whether through anger or jealousy or kindness, the Creator did this, the Puritan woman seems not to have stopped to consider; her belief was sufficient that earthly desires and even natural love must be repressed. Winthrop, a staunch supporter of colonial New England creeds as well as of independence, gives us an example of God's actions in such a matter: \"A godly woman of the church of Boston, dwelling sometime in London, brought with her a parcel of very fine linen of great value, which she set her"]]]
