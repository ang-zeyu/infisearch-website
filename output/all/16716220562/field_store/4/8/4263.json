Stand aside, or I will strike thee dead.\"  \"You are wholly in my power,\" cried Demdike with a disdainful laugh. And as he spoke he pressed the large sharp bit against the charger's mouth, and backed him quickly to the very edge of the hill, the sides of which here sloped precipitously down. The abbot would have uttered a cry, but surprise and terror kept him silent.  \"Were it my desire to injure you, I could cast you down the mountain-side to certain death,\" pursued Demdike. \"But I have no such wish. On the contrary, I will serve you, as I have said, on one condition.\"  \"Thy condition would imperil my soul,\" said the abbot, full of wrath and alarm. \"Thou seekest in vain to terrify me into compliance. _Vade retro, Sathanas_. I defy thee and all thy works.\"  Demdike laughed scornfully.  \"The thunders of the Church do not frighten me,\" he cried. \"But, look,\" he added, \"you doubted my word when I told you the rising was at an end. The beacon fires on Boulsworth Hill and on the Grange of Cliviger are extinguished; that on Padiham Heights is expiring--nay, it is out; and ere many minutes all these mountain watch-fires will have disappeared like lamps at the close of a feast.\"  \"By our Lady, it is so,\" cried the abbot, in increasing terror. \"What new jugglery is this?\"  \"It is no jugglery, I tell you,\" replied the other.  \"The waters of the Don have again arisen; the insurgents have accepted the king's pardon, have deserted their leaders, and dispersed. There will be no rising to-night or on the morrow. The abbots of Jervaux and Salley will strive to capitulate, but in vain. The Pilgrimage of Grace is ended. The stake for which thou playedst is lost. Thirty years hast thou governed here, but thy rule is over. Seventeen abbots have there been of Whalley--the last thou!--but there shall be none more.\"  \"It must be the Demon in person that speaks thus to me,\" cried the abbot, his hair bristling on his head, and a cold perspiration bursting from his pores.  \"No matter who I am,\" replied the other; \"I have said I will aid thee on one condition. It is not much. Remove thy ban from my wife, and baptise her infant daughter, and I am content. I would not ask thee for this service, slight though it be, but the poor soul hath set her mind upon it. Wilt thou do it?\"  \"No,\" replied the abbot, shuddering; \"I will not baptise a daughter of Satan. I will not sell my soul to the powers of darkness. I adjure thee to depart from me, and tempt me no longer.\"  \"Vainly thou seekest to cast me off,\" rejoined Demdike. \"What if I deliver thine adversaries into thine hands, and revenge thee upon them? Even now there are a party of armed men waiting at the foot of the hill to seize thee and thy brethren. Shall I show thee how to destroy them?\"  \"Who are they?\" demanded the abbot, surprised.  \"Their leaders are John Braddyll and Richard Assheton, who shall divide Whalley Abbey between them, if thou stayest them not,\" replied Demdike.  \"Hell consume them!\" cried the abbot.  \"Thy speech shows consent,\" rejoined Demdike. \"Come this way.\"  And, without awaiting the abbot's reply, he dragged his horse towards the but-end of the mountain. As they went on, the two monks, who had been filled with surprise at the interview, though they did not dare to interrupt it, advanced towards their superior, and looked earnestly and inquiringly at him, but he remained silent; while to the men-at-arms and the herdsmen, who demanded whether their own beacon-fire should be extinguished as the others had been, he answered moodily in the negative.  \"Where are the foes you spoke of?\" he asked with some uneasiness, as Demdike led his horse slowly and carefully down the hill-side.  \"You shall see anon,\" replied the other.  \"You are taking me to the spot where you traced the magic circle,\" cried Paslew in alarm. \"I know it from its unnaturally green hue. I will not go thither.\"  \"I do not mean you should, lord abbot,\" replied Demdike, halting. \"Remain on this firm ground. Nay, be not alarmed; you are in no danger. Now bid your men advance, and prepare their weapons.\"  The abbot would have demanded wherefore, but at a glance from Demdike he complied, and the two men-at-arms, and the herdsmen, arranged themselves beside him, while Fathers Eastgate and Haydocke, who had gotten upon their mules, took up a position behind.  Scarcely were they thus placed, when a loud shout was raised below, and a band of armed men, to the number of thirty or forty, leapt the stone wall, and began to scale the hill with great rapidity. They came up a deep dry channel, apparently worn in the hill-side by some former torrent, and which led directly to the spot where Demdike and the abbot stood. The beacon-fire still blazed brightly, and illuminated the whole proceeding, showing that these men, from their accoutrements, were royalist soldiers.  \"Stir not, as you value your life,\" said the wizard to Paslew; \"but observe what shall follow.\"     CHAPTER II.--THE ERUPTION.   Demdike went a little further down the hill, stopping when he came to the green patch. He then plunged his staff into the sod at the first point where he had cast a tuft of heather, and with such force that it sank more than three feet. The next moment he plucked it forth, as if with a great effort, and a jet of black water spouted into the air; but, heedless of this, he went to the next marked spot, and again plunged the sharp point of the implement into the ground. Again it sank to the same depth, and, on being drawn out, a second black jet sprung forth.  Meanwhile the hostile party continued to advance up the dry channel before mentioned, and shouted on beholding these strange preparations, but they did not relax their speed. Once more the staff sank into the ground, and a third black fountain followed its extraction. By this time, the royalist soldiers were close at hand, and the features of their two leaders, John Braddyll and Richard Assheton, could be plainly distinguished, and their voices heard.  \"'Tis he! 'tis the rebel abbot!\" vociferated Braddyll, pressing forward. \"We were not misinformed. He has been watching by the beacon. The devil has delivered him into our hands.\"  \"Ho! ho!\" laughed Demdike.  \"Abbot no longer--'tis the Earl of Poverty you mean,\" responded Assheton. \"The villain shall be gibbeted on the spot where he has fired the beacon, as a warning to all traitors.\"  \"Ha, heretics!--ha, blasphemers!--I can at least avenge myself upon you,\" cried Paslew, striking spurs into his charger. But ere he could execute his purpose, Demdike had sprung backward, and, catching the bridle, restrained the animal by a powerful effort.  \"Hold!\" he cried, in a voice of thunder, \"or you will share their fate.\"  As the words were uttered, a dull, booming, subterranean sound was heard, and instantly afterwards, with a crash like thunder, the whole of the green circle beneath slipped off, and from a yawning rent under it burst forth with irresistible fury, a thick inky-coloured torrent, which, rising almost breast high, fell upon the devoted royalist soldiers, who were advancing right in its course. Unable to avoid the watery eruption, or to resist its fury when it came upon them, they were instantly swept from their feet, and carried down the channel.  A sight of horror was it to behold the sudden rise of that swarthy stream, whose waters, tinged by the ruddy glare of the beacon-fire, looked like waves of blood. Nor less fearful was it to hear the first wild despairing cry raised by the victims, or the quickly stifled shrieks and groans that followed, mixed with the deafening roar of the stream, and the crashing fall of the stones, which accompanied its course. Down, down went the poor wretches, now utterly overwhelmed by the torrent, now regaining their feet only to utter a scream, and then be swept off. Here a miserable struggler, whirled onward, would clutch at the banks and try to scramble forth, but the soft turf giving way beneath him, he was hurried off to eternity.  At another point where the stream encountered some trifling opposition, some two or three managed to gain a footing, but they were unable to extricate themselves. The vast quantity of boggy soil brought down by the current, and which rapidly collected here, embedded them and held them fast, so that the momently deepening water, already up to their chins, threatened speedy immersion. Others were stricken down by great masses of turf, or huge rocky fragments, which, bounding from point to point with the torrent, bruised or crushed all they encountered, or, lodging in some difficult place, slightly diverted the course of the torrent, and rendered it yet more dangerous.  On one of these stones, larger than the rest, which had been stopped in its course, a man contrived to creep, and with difficulty kept his post amid the raging flood. Vainly did he extend his hand to such of his fellows as were swept shrieking past him. He could not lend them aid, while his own position was so desperately hazardous that he did not dare to quit it. To leap on either bank was impossible, and to breast the headlong stream certain death.  On goes the current, madly, furiously, as if rejoicing in the work of destruction, while the white foam of its eddies presents a fearful contrast to the prevailing blackness of the surface. Over the last declivity it leaps, hissing, foaming, crashing like an avalanche. The stone wall for a moment opposes its force, but falls the next, with a mighty splash, carrying the spray far and wide, while its own fragments roll onwards with the stream. The trees of the orchard are uprooted in an instant, and an old elm falls prostrate. The outbuildings of a cottage are invaded, and the porkers and cattle, divining their danger, squeal and bellow in affright. But they are quickly silenced. The resistless foe has broken down wall and door, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15493"],["title","The Lancashire Witches: A Romance of Pendle Forest (#4)"],["body","the poor creatures in mud and rubbish.  The stream next invades the cottage, breaks in through door and window, and filling all the lower part of the tenement, in a few minutes converts it into a heap of ruin. On goes the destroyer, tearing up more trees, levelling more houses, and filling up a small pool, till the latter bursts its banks, and, with an accession to its force, pours itself into a mill-dam. Here its waters are stayed until they find a vent underneath, and the action of the stream, as it rushes downwards through this exit, forms a great eddy above, in which swim some living things, cattle and sheep from the fold not yet drowned, mixed with furniture from the cottages, and amidst them the bodies of some of the unfortunate men-at-arms which have been washed hither.  But, ha! another thundering crash. The dam has burst. The torrent roars and rushes on furiously as before, joins its forces with Pendle Water, swells up the river, and devastates the country far and wide.[1]  The abbot and his companions beheld this work of destruction with amazement and dread. Blanched terror sat in their cheeks, and the blood was frozen in Paslew's veins; for he thought it the work of the powers of darkness, and that he was leagued with them. He tried to mutter a prayer, but his lips refused their office. He would have moved, but his limbs were stiffened and paralysed, and he could only gaze aghast at the terrible spectacle.  Amidst it all he heard a wild burst of unearthly laughter, proceeding, he thought, from Demdike, and it filled him with new dread. But he could not check the sound, neither could he stop his ears, though he would fain have done so. Like him, his companions were petrified and speechless with fear.  After this had endured for some time, though still the black torrent rushed on impetuously as ever, Demdike turned to the abbot and said,--  \"Your vengeance has been fully gratified. You will now baptise my child?\"  \"Never, never, accursed being!\" shrieked the abbot. \"Thou mayst sacrifice her at thine own impious rites. But see, there is one poor wretch yet struggling with the foaming torrent. I may save him.\"  \"That is John Braddyll, thy worst enemy,\" replied Demdike. \"If he lives he shall possess half Whalley Abbey. Thou hadst best also save Richard Assheton, who yet clings to the great stone below, as if he escapes he shall have the other half. Mark him, and make haste, for in five minutes both shall be gone.\"  \"I will save them if I can, be the consequence to myself what it may,\" replied the abbot.  And, regardless of the derisive laughter of the other, who yelled in his ears as he went, \"Bess shall see thee hanged at thy own door!\" he dashed down the hill to the spot where a small object, distinguishable above the stream, showed that some one still kept his head above water, his tall stature having preserved him.  \"Is it you, John Braddyll?\" cried the abbot, as he rode up.  \"Ay,\" replied the head. \"Forgive me for the wrong I intended you, and deliver me from this great peril.\"  \"I am come for that purpose,\" replied the abbot, dismounting, and disencumbering himself of his heavy cloak.  By this time the two herdsmen had come up, and the abbot, taking a crook from one of them, clutched hold of the fellow, and, plunging fearlessly into the stream, extended it towards the drowning man, who instantly lifted up his hand to grasp it. In doing so Braddyll lost his balance, but, as he did not quit his hold, he was plucked forth from the tenacious mud by the combined efforts of the abbot and his assistant, and with some difficulty dragged ashore.  \"Now for the other,\" cried Paslew, as he placed Braddyll in safety.  \"One-half the abbey is gone from thee,\" shouted a voice in his ears as he rushed on.  Presently he reached the rocky fragment on which Ralph Assheton rested. The latter was in great danger from the surging torrent, and the stone on which he had taken refuge tottered at its base, and threatened to roll over.  \"In Heaven's name, help me, lord abbot, as thou thyself shall be holpen at thy need!\" shrieked Assheton.  \"Be not afraid, Richard Assheton,\" replied Paslew. \"I will deliver thee as I have delivered John Braddyll.\"  But the task was not of easy accomplishment. The abbot made his preparations as before; grasped the hand of the herdsman and held out the crook to Assheton; but when the latter caught it, the stream swung him round with such force that the abbot must either abandon him or advance further into the water. Bent on Assheton's preservation, he adopted the latter expedient, and instantly lost his feet; while the herdsman, unable longer to hold him, let go the crook, and the abbot and Assheton were swept down the stream together.  Down--down they went, destruction apparently awaiting them; but the abbot, though sometimes quite under the water, and bruised by the rough stones and gravel with which he came in contact, still retained his self-possession, and encouraged his companion to hope for succour. In this way they were borne down to the foot of the hill, the monks, the herdsmen, and the men-at-arms having given them up as lost. But they yet lived--yet floated--though greatly injured, and almost senseless, when they were cast into a pool formed by the eddying waters at the foot of the hill. Here, wholly unable to assist himself, Assheton was seized by a black hound belonging to a tall man who stood on the bank, and who shouted to Paslew, as he helped the animal to bring the drowning man ashore, \"The other half of the abbey is gone from thee. Wilt thou baptise my child if I send my dog to save thee?\"  \"Never!\" replied the other, sinking as he spoke.  Flashes of fire glanced in the abbot's eyes, and stunning sounds seemed to burst his ears. A few more struggles, and he became senseless.  But he was not destined to die thus. What happened afterwards he knew not; but when he recovered full consciousness, he found himself stretched, with aching limbs and throbbing head, upon a couch in a monastic room, with a richly-painted and gilded ceiling, with shields at the corners emblazoned with the three luces of Whalley, and with panels hung with tapestry from the looms of Flanders, representing divers Scriptural subjects.  \"Have I been dreaming?\" he murmured.  \"No,\" replied a tall man standing by his bedside; \"thou hast been saved from one death to suffer another more ignominious.\"  \"Ha!\" cried the abbot, starting up and pressing his hand to his temples; \"thou here?\"  \"Ay, I am appointed to watch thee,\" replied Demdike. \"Thou art a prisoner in thine own chamber at Whalley. All has befallen as I told thee. The Earl of Derby is master of the abbey; thy adherents are dispersed; and thy brethren are driven forth. Thy two partners in rebellion, the abbots of Jervaux and Salley, have been conveyed to Lancaster Castle, whither thou wilt go as soon as thou canst be moved.\"  \"I will surrender all--silver and gold, land and possessions--to the king, if I may die in peace,\" groaned the abbot.  \"It is not needed,\" rejoined the other. \"Attainted of felony, thy lands and abbey will be forfeited to the crown, and they shall be sold, as I have told thee, to John Braddyll and Richard Assheton, who will be rulers here in thy stead.\"  \"Would I had perished in the flood!\" groaned the abbot.  \"Well mayst thou wish so,\" returned his tormentor; \"but thou wert not destined to die by water. As I have said, thou shalt be hanged at thy own door, and my wife shall witness thy end.\"  \"Who art thou? I have heard thy voice before,\" cried the abbot. \"It is like the voice of one whom I knew years ago, and thy features are like his--though changed--greatly changed. Who art thou?\"  \"Thou shalt know before thou diest,\" replied the other, with a look of gratified vengeance. \"Farewell, and reflect upon thy fate.\"  So saying, he strode towards the door, while the miserable abbot arose, and marching with uncertain steps to a little oratory adjoining, which he himself had built, knelt down before the altar, and strove to pray.     CHAPTER III.--WHALLEY ABBEY.   A sad, sad change hath come over the fair Abbey of Whalley. It knoweth its old masters no longer. For upwards of two centuries and a half hath the \"Blessed Place\"[2] grown in beauty and riches. Seventeen abbots have exercised unbounded hospitality within it, but now they are all gone, save one!--and he is attainted of felony and treason. The grave monk walketh no more in the cloisters, nor seeketh his pallet in the dormitory. Vesper or matin-song resound not as of old within the fine conventual church. Stripped are the altars of their silver crosses, and the shrines of their votive offerings and saintly relics. Pyx and chalice, thuribule and vial, golden-headed pastoral staff, and mitre embossed with pearls, candlestick and Christmas ship of silver; salver, basin, and ewer--all are gone--the splendid sacristy hath been despoiled.  A sad, sad change hath come over Whalley Abbey. The libraries, well stored with reverend tomes, have been pillaged, and their contents cast to the flames; and thus long laboured manuscript, the fruit of years of patient industry, with gloriously illuminated missal, are irrecoverably lost. The large infirmary no longer receiveth the sick; in the locutory sitteth no more the guest. No longer in the mighty kitchens are prepared the prodigious supply of meats destined for the support of the poor or the entertainment of the traveller. No kindly porter stands at the gate, to bid the stranger enter and partake of the munificent abbot's hospitality, but a churlish guard bids him hie away, and menaces him if he tarries with his halbert. Closed are the buttery-hatches and the pantries; and the daily dole of bread hath ceased. Closed, also, to the brethren is the refectory. The cellarer's office is ended. The strong ale which he brewed in October, is tapped in March by roystering troopers. The rich muscadel and malmsey, and the wines of Gascoigne and the Rhine,"]]]
