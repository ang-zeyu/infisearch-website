I wonder if that means me?\" thought the old gentleman rabbit. \"Let's see, gold grows under ground, in mines, and perhaps this is a gold mine. I'm going down. I'm sure there is a fortune waiting for me. Yes, I'll go down.\"  So he laid aside his valise and barber-pole crutch and got ready to go down in the hole, which wasn't very big.  \"But I can scratch it bigger if I need to,\" said Uncle Wiggily.  Well, he had no sooner gotten his front feet and part of his nose down the hole, but his ears were still sticking out, when he heard a voice calling:  \"Here! Where are you going?\"  \"Down this hole after gold,\" replied Uncle Wiggily.  \"You mustn't go down there,\" went on the voice, and pulling out his nose and looking about him, the old gentleman rabbit saw a white pussy cat sitting on a stump. And the pussy cat was washing his face with his paws, taking care not to let the claws stick out for fear of scratching his eyes.  \"Why can't I go down this hole, Pussy?\" asked the rabbit. \"Do you have charge of it?\"  \"No, indeed,\" was the answer, \"but there is a bad snake who lives down there, and he puts up that sign so the animals will come down, and then he eats them. That's the reason he says they are welcome. No, indeed, I wouldn't want to see you go down there!\"  \"Ha! Hum! I wouldn't like to see myself!\" spoke Uncle Wiggily, and he crawled away from the hole just in time, for the snake stuck out his ugly head and was about to bite the rabbit. It was the same snake that had nearly caught the bumble bee.  \"Say!\" cried the snake, quite angry like, to the pussy cat, \"I wish you would get away from here! You are always spoiling my plans. I thought I was going to have a nice rabbit dinner, and now look at what you have done,\" and that snake was so angry that he hissed like a boiling teakettle.  \"I will never let you eat up Uncle Wiggily!\" cried the pussy. \"Now look out for yourself, Mr. Snake!\" and with that the pussy made his back round like a hoop, and he swelled up his tail like a bologna sausage, and he showed his teeth and claws to the snake, and that snake popped down the hole again very quickly, I can tell you, taking his tail with him. Oh, my, yes, and a bucket of sawdust soup besides.  \"I thank you very much for telling me about that snake, little pussy cat,\" said Uncle Wiggily. \"Well, I am disappointed about my fortune again. I shall never be rich I fear. But I almost forgot that I have some fine honey sandwiches and I will give you some, for you must be hungry. I know I am.\"  \"I am, too,\" said the pussy. So Uncle Wiggily opened his valise and took out the honey sandwiches which the bee had given him, but when he went to eat them he found that the bee had forgotten to butter the bread.  \"Oh, that is too bad!\" cried the pussy, when Uncle Wiggily spoke of it. \"Still they will do very well without butter.\"  \"No, we must have some,\" said the rabbit. \"I wonder how I can get butter in the woods?\" So he looked all around and the first thing he saw was a yellow buttercup flower. You know the kind I mean. You hold them under your chin to see if you like butter, and the shine of the flower makes your chin yellow.  \"Ha!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. \"Now we will have butter.\"  \"But you are not going to eat the flower, are you?\" asked the pussy.  \"No, indeed!\" cried the rabbit, \"I'll show you.\"  Now there was a cow in the field a short distance away, and Uncle Wiggily went over and got some milk from the cow in a little tin cup. \"Butter is made from milk,\" said the rabbit to the pussy. \"So I will just pour some milk in the buttercup flower, and shake it just as if it was a churn, and then we'll have butter for our honey sandwiches.\"  So he did this. Into the buttercup he poured the milk, and it became yellow like butter at once. But Uncle Wiggily did not have to shake the flower, for a little wind came along just then and shook it for him.  And pretty soon, in a little while, the milk in the buttercup was churned into lovely sweet butter, and the rabbit and pussy spread it on their honey sandwiches, and what a fine feast they had. Just as they were eating it the bad alligator came along, and wanted to take the honey away from them, but the pussy scratched the end of the savage beast's tail with his claws, and the bad alligator ran away as fast as he could.  Then Uncle Wiggily and the pussy traveled on together and the next day they had quite an adventure. What it was I'll tell you in the next story when, in case the steamboat stops at our house for a little girl wearing a green sunbonnet, with horse chestnuts on it, I'll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the July bug.     STORY VII  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE JULY BUG   \"Well, what shall we do to-day?\" asked the white pussy of Uncle Wiggily, as they traveled on together, the next day after the adventure at the snake hole. They had slept that night in a nice hollow stump.  \"Hum! I hardly know what to do,\" replied the old gentleman rabbit. \"Of course I must be on the watch for my fortune, but, as I don't seem to be finding it very fast, what do you say to having a picnic to-day?\"  \"The very thing!\" cried pussy. \"We will get some lunch, and go off in the woods and eat it. Only we ought to have a lot more people. Two are hardly enough for a picnic.\"  \"I would like some of my friends to come to it,\" spoke Uncle Wiggily, \"but I am afraid they are too far off.\"  \"Couldn't you send them word by telephone?\" inquired the pussy. \"I'm sure I would like to meet them, for I have heard so much about Sammie and Susie Littletail, and Johnnie and Billie Bushytail.\"  \"There is no telephone in these woods,\" replied Uncle Wiggily, \"and we haven't time to send them postcards. I wish I could get word to them, however, but I don't s'pose I can.\"  \"Yes, you can!\" suddenly cried a voice down in the grass. \"I'll tell all your friends to come to the picnic if you like.\"  \"Indeed, I would like it,\" said the rabbit, \"but who are you, if I may be so bold as to ask? I can't see you.\"  \"There he is--it's a big June bug!\" exclaimed the pussy.  \"I beg your pardon,\" spoke the bug quickly, as he crawled out from under a leaf and sat on a toadstool. \"But I am not a June bug, if you please.\"  \"You look like one,\" said Uncle Wiggily politely.  \"I am a July bug,\" went on the funny little creature. \"I was intended for a June bug, but there was some mistake made, and I didn't come out of my shell until July. So you see I'm a July bug, and at first I thought it would be jolly fun, to hear all the firecrackers and skyrockets go off.\"  \"It isn't so much fun as you imagine,\" said Uncle Wiggily, as he thought of the time he went sailing into the air on the sky-cracker. \"But don't you like being a July bug?\"  \"Not very much. You see I'm the only one there is, and all the others are June bugs. The June bugs won't speak to me, nor let me play with them, so I'm very lonesome. I heard you talking about a picnic you were going to have, and so I offered to call all your friends to it. I thought perhaps if I did that you would let me come to it also.\"  \"To be sure!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. \"You may gladly come, but how are you going to send word to all of my friends?\"  \"I will fly through the air and tell them to come,\" was the answer. \"I am a very swift flyer. Watch me,\" and then and there the July bug buzzed around so fast that Uncle Wiggily and the pussy couldn't see his wings go flip-flop-flap.  Well, they decided it would be a good plan to have the July bug act as a postman, so Uncle Wiggily wrote out the invitations on little pieces of white birch bark, and gave them to the bug. Off he flew into the air waving one leg at Uncle Wiggily and the pussy.  \"Well, now we must get ready for the picnic--get the things to eat--for that bug flies so fast that soon all my friends will be here,\" said the rabbit, so he and the pussy began to get the lunch ready.  Uncle Wiggily had some food in his valise, but they got more good things from a kind old monkey who lived in the woods. He used to work on a hand organ, but when he got old he bought him a nest in the woods with the pennies he had saved up, and he lived in peace and quietness, and played a mouth organ on Sundays.  Well, you will hardly believe me, but it's true, no sooner had Uncle Wiggily and the pussy put up the lunch, wrapping some for each visitor in nice, green grape leaves, than the first ones of the picnic party began to arrive. They were Dickie and Nellie Chip-Chip, the sparrows, for they could fly through the air very quickly, and so they came on ahead.  \"We got your invitation that the July bug left us, Uncle Wiggily, and we came at once,\" said Dickie.  \"Where are the others?\" asked the old gentleman rabbit.  \"They are coming,\" answered Nellie, as she tied her tail ribbon over again, for the bow knot had become undone as she was flying through the air.  Well, in a little while along came hopping, Sammie and Susie Littletail, the rabbit children, and Billie and Johnnie Bushytail, the squirrel brothers, and Bully and Bawly the frogs, and Dottie and Munchie Trot, the ponies, and Lulu and Alice and Jimmie Wibblewobble, the duck twins, and Buddy and Brighteyes Pigg, and oh, all the boy and girl animals I have ever told you about.  And oh! how glad they were to see Uncle Wiggily. He had to tell them all about his travels after his fortune before they would go off in the woods to the picnic. But at last they went, each one with a little leaf-package of lunch. The July bug came along, too, and he had a very little package of good things, because he was so small, you see, but it was enough.  They all sat down on the ground with flat stones for plates, and sticks for knives and forks, and they ate their picnic lunch there. Oh, they had the finest time, and it didn't matter if some ants did get in the sugar. Uncle Wiggily said they could have all they wanted of the sweet stuff.  And, when the picnic was almost over, there "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15282"],["title","Uncle Wiggily's Travels (#5)"],["body","a sudden noise in the bushes, and two bad foxes sprang out. One tried to grab Uncle Wiggily, and another made a dash for Lulu Wibblewobble.  \"Oh dear!\" cried Dottie Trot, without looking to see if her hair ribbon was on straight. \"We shall all be eaten up!\"  \"No, you won't!\" cried the brave July bug. \"I'll fix those foxes!\"  So that brave July bug just buzzed his wings as hard as he could, and straight at those foxes he flew, bumping and banging them on their noses and in the eyes, so that they gave two separate and distinct howls, and ran away, taking their big tails with them.  So that is how the July bug saved everybody from being eaten up, and then the picnic was over and every one said it was lovely.  \"Well, I'll start on my travels again to-morrow,\" said Uncle Wiggily, as his friends told him good-by.  Now what happened to him the next day I'll tell you very soon, for, in case I see a chipmunk with a blue tail and a red nose climbing up the clothes pole, the story will be about Uncle Wiggily and Jack-in-the-pulpit.     STORY VIII  UNCLE WIGGILY AND JACK-IN-THE-PULPIT   Uncle Wiggily was slowly hopping along through the woods, sometimes leaning on his crutch, when his rheumatism pained him, and again skipping along when he got out into the warm sunshine. It was the day after the picnic, and the old gentleman rabbit felt a bit lonesome as all his friends had gone back to their homes.  \"I do declare!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, as he walked slowly along by a little lake, where an August rabbit was running his motor boat, \"if I don't find my fortune pretty soon I won't have any vacation this year. I must look carefully to-day, and see if I can't find a pot full of gold.\"  Well, he looked as carefully as he could, but my land sakes and a pair of white gloves! he couldn't seem to find a smitch of gold and not so much as a crumb of diamonds.  [Illustration]  \"Hum!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, \"at this rate I guess I'll have to keep on traveling for several years before I find my fortune. But never mind, I'm having a good time, anyhow. I'll keep on searching.\"  So he kept on, and all of a sudden when he was walking past a prickly briar bush, he heard a voice calling:  \"Hey, Uncle Wiggily, come on in here.\"  \"Ha! Who are you, and why do you want me to come in there?\" asked the old gentleman rabbit.  \"Oh, I am a friend of yours,\" was the answer, \"and I will give you a lot of money if you come in here.\"  \"Let me see your face,\" asked the rabbit, \"I want to know who you are.\"  \"Oh! I have a dreadful toothache,\" said the creature hiding in the bushes. \"I don't want to stick my face out in the cold. But if you will take my word for it I am a good friend of yours. I would like very much for you to come in here.\"  \"Well, perhaps I had better,\" said the old gentleman rabbit, \"for I certainly need money.\"  And he was just going to crawl in under the prickly briar bush when all of a sudden he happened to look, and he saw the skillery-scallery tail of the alligator accidentally sticking out. Yes, it was the alligator trying to fool dear old Uncle Wiggily.  \"Oh, ho!\" cried the wise old rabbit. \"I guess I won't go in there after all,\" so he hopped to one side and the alligator kept waiting for him to come in so he could eat him, but when the rabbit didn't come in the savage creature with the skillery-scallery tail cried:  \"Well, aren't you coming in?\"  \"No, thank you,\" said the rabbit. \"I have to go on to seek my fortune,\" and away he hopped. Well, that alligator was so angry that he gnashed his teeth and nearly broke them, and he crawled after Uncle Wiggily, but of course, he couldn't catch him.  Uncle Wiggily was pretty careful after that, and whenever he came near a prickly briar bush he listened with both his long ears stuck up straight to see if he could hear any sounds like an alligator. But he didn't, and so he kept on.  Well, it was coming on toward evening, one afternoon, and the old gentleman rabbit was tramping along the road, wondering where he would sleep, when all of a sudden something came bursting out of the bushes toward the rabbit, and a voice cried out:  \"Hide! Hide! Uncle Wiggily. Hide as quickly as you can!\"  \"Why should I hide?\" asked the old gentleman rabbit. \"Is there a giant coming after me?\"  \"Worse than a giant,\" said the voice. \"It is a bad wolf that jumped out of his cage from the circus, and he is just ready to eat up anything he sees,\" and the July bug, for it was he who had fluttered out of the bushes, to tell Uncle Wiggily, made his wings go slowly to and fro like an electric palm-leaf fan.  \"A wolf, eh?\" cried the old gentleman rabbit. \"And do you think he will eat me?\"  \"He surely will,\" said the July bug. \"I happened to fly past his house, and I heard him say to his wife that he was going out to see if he could find a rabbit supper. So I know he's coming for you. You'd better hide.\"  \"Oh! where can I hide?\" asked the rabbit, as he looked around for a hollow stump. But there wasn't any, and there were no holes in the ground, and he didn't know what to do.  Then, all at once there was a crashing in the bushes and it sounded like an elephant coming through, breaking all the sticks in his path.  \"There's the wolf! There's the wolf!\" cried the July bug. \"Hide, Uncle Wiggily,\" and then the bug perched on the high limb of a tree where the wolf couldn't catch him.  Well, the poor old gentleman rabbit looked for a place to hide himself away from the wolf but he couldn't seem to find any, and he was just going to crawl under a stone and maybe hurt himself, when all at once he heard a voice say:  \"Jump up here, Uncle Wiggily. I'll hide you from the wolf.\"  So the rabbit traveler looked up, and there he saw a flower called Jack-in-the-pulpit looking down on him. I've told you about them before, how the frog once took his bath in one, and how, when you pick a wood-bouquet you put them in with some ferns to make the bouquet look pretty. They are a flower like a vase, with a top curling over, and a thing standing up in the centre whose name is \"Jack.\"  \"Jump in here,\" said the Jack. \"I'll fold my top down over you like an umbrella, and the wolf can't find you.\"  \"But you are so small that I can't get inside,\" said the rabbit.  \"Oh, I'll make myself bigger,\" cried the Jack, I and he took a long breath, and puffed himself up and swelled himself up, until he was large enough for Uncle Wiggily to jump down inside. Then the Jack-in-the-pulpit closed down the umbrella top over the rabbit, and he was hidden away as nice and snug as could be wished.  Pretty soon that bad savage wolf came prancing along, and he looked all over for the rabbit. Then he sniffed and cried:  \"Ha! I smell him somewhere around here! I'll find him!\" But he couldn't see Uncle Wiggily because he was safely hidden in the Jack-in-the-pulpit. So the wolf raged around some more and chased after his tail, and just as he smelled the rabbit hidden in the flower, the July bug flew down out of the tree, bang! right into the eyes of the wolf, and then the savage creature felt so badly that he ran home and ate cold bread and water for supper, and he didn't bother Uncle Wiggily any more that day.  So that's how the Jack-in-the-pulpit saved the rabbit and very thankful Uncle Wiggily was. And he stayed that night in a hollow stump, and the next day he went on to seek his fortune.  And quite a curious thing happened to him, as I shall have the pleasure of telling you about soon, when in case our canoe boat doesn't turn upside down and spill out the breakfast oatmeal, the next bedtime story will be about Uncle Wiggily and the lost chipmunk.     STORY IX  UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LOST CHIPMUNK   Uncle Wiggily was walking along the road one morning, after he had slept all night in the hollow stump. He didn't have any breakfast either, for there was nothing left in his valise, and of course he couldn't eat his barber-pole crutch. If the crutch had had a hole in it, like in the elephant's trunk, then the old gentleman rabbit could have carried along some sandwiches. But, as it was, he had nothing for breakfast, and he hadn't had much supper either, the night before.  \"Oh, how hungry I am!\" exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. \"If only I had a piece of cherry pie now, or an ice cream cone, or a bit of bread and butter and jam I would be all right.\"  Well, he just happened to open his valise, and there on the very bottom, among some papers he found a few crumbs of the honey sandwiches the bumble bee had given him. Well, you never can imagine how good those few crumbs tasted to the old gentleman rabbit, which shows you that it is a good thing to be hungry once in a while, because even common things taste good.  But the crumbs weren't enough for Uncle Wiggily. As he walked along he kept getting hungrier and hungrier and he didn't know how he was going to stand it.  Then, all of a sudden, as he was passing by a hollow stump, he saw a whole lot of little black creatures crawling around it. They were going up and down, and they were very busy.  \"Why, these are ants,\" said the rabbit. \"Well, I s'pose they have plenty to eat. I almost wish I was an ant.\"  \"Well! Well!\" exclaimed a voice all at once. \"If here isn't Uncle Wiggily. Where did you come from?\" and there stood a second cousin to the ant for whom Uncle Wiggily had once carried home a pound of beefsteak with mushrooms on it.  \"Oh, I am traveling about seeking my fortune,\" said the rabbit. \"But I haven't been very successful. I couldn't even find my breakfast this morning.\"  \"That's too bad!\" exclaimed the ant who wore glasses. \"We can give you something, however. Come on! everybody, help get breakfast for Uncle Wiggily.\"  So all the ants came running up, and some of them brought pieces of boiled eggs, and others brought oatmeal and others parts of oranges and still others parts of cups of coffee. So take it altogether, with seventeen million, four hundred and seventeen thousand, one hundred and eighty-five ants and a baby"]]]
