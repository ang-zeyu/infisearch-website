Thinking that her right arm might be tired, she moved the weight to her left, but with no better success, for the water still spilled at every step. \"One would think there were fishes in the pail,\" said Bess, as she set it down. But there was nothing to be seen but a thin red water-worm wriggling at the bottom, such as you may see any day in a soft-water tub. It was in this shape, however, that the Nix had disguised himself, and he almost writhed out of his skin with delight at the success of his first essay in mischief.  When they once more set forward the Nix leaped and jumped harder than ever, so that not only was the water spilled, but the maiden's dress was soaked, and her tears dropped almost as fast as the wet dripped from her clothes.  \"The pail is bewitched!\" cried the poor girl. \"How my mother will beat me for this! And my back aches as if I were carrying lead, and yet the water is nearly all gone.\"  \"This is something like fun!\" laughed the Nix. \"When I go home and relate _my_ adventures, no dwarfs pranks will be named again!\" But when Bess looked into the pail, he was the same slimy, stupid-looking worm as before. She dared not return to the lake for more water--\"for,\" said she, \"I should be as much beaten for being late as for bringing short measure, and have the labour to boot.\" So she took up her burden again, and the Nix began his dance afresh, and by the time they came to their journey's end, there was not a quart of water in the pail.  \"Was ever a poor woman plagued with such a careless hussy?\" cried the mother when she saw the dripping dress; and, as Bess had expected, she seasoned her complaints with a hearty slap. \"And look what she calls a pailful of water!\" added the mother, with a second blow.  \"Late in the morning's unlucky all day,\" thought poor Bess, and, as her mother curled her, she screamed till the house rang with the noise; for she had good lungs, and knew that it is well to cry out before one gets too much hurt.  Meanwhile the Nix thought she was enduring agonies, and could hardly contain his mischievous glee; and when the woman bade her \"warm some water quickly for the wash,\" he was in no way disturbed, for he had never seen boiling water, and only anticipated fresh sport as he slipped from the pail into the kettle.  \"Now,\" cried the mother sharply, \"see if you can lift _that_ without slopping your clothes.\"  \"Aye, aye,\" laughed the Nix, \"see if you can, my dear!\" and as poor Bess seized it in her sturdy red hands he began to dance as before. But the kettle had a lid, which the pail had not. Moreover Bess was a strong, strapping lass, and, stimulated by the remembrance of her mother's slaps, with a vigorous effort she set the kettle on the fire. \"I shall be glad when I'm safely in bed,\" she muttered. \"Everything goes wrong to-day.\"  \"It is warm in here,\" said the Nix to himself, after a while; \"in fact--stuffy. But one must pay something for a frolic, and it tickles my ears to hear that old woman rating her daughter for my pranks. Give me time and opportunity, and I'll set the whole stupid race by the ears. There she goes again! It is worth enduring a little discomfort, though it certainly is warm, and I fancy it grows warmer.\"  By degrees the bottom of the kettle grew quite hot, and burnt the Nix, so that he had to jump up and down in the water to keep himself cool. The noise of this made the woman think that the kettle was boiling, and she began to scold her daughter as before, shouting, \"Are you coming with that tub to-night or not? The water is hot already.\"  This time the Nix laughed (as they say) on the other side of his mouth; for the water had now become as hot as the bottom of the kettle, and he screamed at the top of his shrill tiny voice with pain.  \"How the kettle sings to-night!\" said Bess, \"and how it rains!\" she added. For at that moment a tremendous storm burst around the house, and the rain poured down in sheets of water, as if it meant to wash everything into the lake. The kettle now really boiled, and the lid danced up and down with the frantic leaping and jumping of the agonized Nix, who puffed and blew till his breath came out of the spout in clouds of steam.  \"If your eyes were as sharp as your ears you'd see that the water is boiling over,\" snapped the woman; and giving her daughter a passing push, she hurried to the fire-place, and lifted the kettle on to the ground.  But no sooner had she set it down, than the lid flew off, and out jumped a little man with green teeth and a tall green hat, who ran out of the door wringing his hands and crying--  \"Three hundred and three years have I lived in the water of this lake, and I never knew it boil before!\"  As he crossed the threshold, a clap of thunder broke with what sounded like a peal of laughter from many voices, and then the storm ceased as suddenly as it had begun.  The woman now saw how matters stood, and did not fail next morning to fasten an old horseshoe to the door of her house. And seeing that she had behaved unjustly to her daughter, she bought her the gayest set of pink ribbons that were to be found at the next fair.  It is on record that Bess (who cared little for slaps and sharp speeches) thought this the best bargain she had ever made. But whether the Nix was equally well satisfied is not known.     THE COBBLER AND THE GHOSTS.   Long ago there lived a cobbler who had very poor wits, but by strict industry he could earn enough to keep himself and his widowed mother in comfort.  In this manner he had lived for many years in peace and prosperity, when a distant relative died who left him a certain sum of money. This so elated the cobbler that he could think of nothing else, and his only talk was of the best way of spending the legacy.  His mother advised him to lay it by against a rainy day.  \"For,\" said she, \"we have lived long in much comfort as we are, and have need of nothing; but when you grow old, or if it should please Heaven that you become disabled, you will then be glad of your savings.\"  But to this the cobbler would not listen. \"No,\" said he, \"if we save the money it may be stolen, but if we spend it well, we shall have the use of what we buy, and may sell it again if we are so minded.\"  He then proposed one purchase after another, and each was more foolish than the rest. When this had gone on for some time, one morning he exclaimed: \"I have it at last! We will buy the house. It cannot be stolen or lost, and when it is ours we shall have no rent to pay, and I shall not have to work so hard.\"  \"He will never hit on a wiser plan than that,\" thought the widow; \"it is not to be expected.\" So she fully consented to this arrangement, which was duly carried out; and the bargain left the cobbler with a few shillings, which he tied up in a bag and put in his pocket, having first changed them into pence, that they might make more noise when he jingled the bag as he walked down the street.  Presently he said; \"It is not fit that a man who lives in his own house, and has ready money in his pocket too, should spend the whole day in labouring with his hands. Since by good luck I can read, it would be well that I should borrow a book from the professor, for study is an occupation suitable to my present position.\"  Accordingly, he went to the professor, whom he found seated in his library, and preferred his request.  \"What book do you want?\" asked the professor.  The cobbler stood and scratched his head thoughtfully. The professor thought that he was trying to recall the name of the work; but in reality he was saying to himself: \"How much additional knowledge one requires if he has risen ever so little in life! Now, if I did but know where it is proper to begin in a case full of books like this! Should one take the first on the top shelf, or the bottom shelf, to the left, or to the right?\"  At last he resolved to choose the book nearest to him; so drawing it out from the rest, he answered--  \"This one, if it please you, learned sir.\" The professor lent it to him, and he took it home and began to read.  It was, as it happened, a book about ghosts and apparitions; and the cobbler's mind was soon so full of these marvels that he could talk of nothing else, and hardly did a stroke of work for reading and pondering over what he read. He could find none of his neighbours who had seen a ghost, though most had heard of such things, and many believed in them.  \"Live and learn,\" thought the cobbler; \"here is fame as well as wealth. If I could but see a ghost there would be no more to desire.\" And with this intent he sallied forth late one night to the churchyard.  Meanwhile a thief (who had heard the jingle of his money-bag) resolved to profit by the cobbler's whim; so wrapping himself in a sheet, he laid wait for him in a field that he must cross to reach the church.  When the cobbler saw the white figure, he made sure, that he had now seen a ghost, and already felt proud of his own acquaintance, as a remarkable character. Meanwhile, the thief stood quite still, and the cobbler walked boldly up to him, expecting that the phantom would either vanish or prove so impalpable that he could pass through it as through a mist, of which he had read many notable instances in the professor's book. He soon found out his mistake, however, for the supposed ghost grappled him, and without loss of time relieved him of his money-bag. The cobbler (who was not wanting in courage) fastened as tightly on to the sheet, which he still held with desperate firmness when the thief had slipped through his fingers; and after waiting in vain for further marvels, he carried the sheet home to his mother, and narrated his encounter with the ghost.  \"Alack-a-day! that I should have a son with so little wit!\" cried the old woman; \"it was no ghost, but a thief, who is now making merry with all the money we possessed.\"  \"We have his sheet,\" replied her son; \"and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15592"],["title","Old-Fashioned Fairy Tales (#4)"],["body"," is due solely to my determination. How could I have acted better?\"  \"You should have grasped the man, not the sheet,\" said the widow, \"and pummelled him till he cried out and dropped the money-bag.\"  \"Live and learn,\" said the cobbler. The next night he went out as before, and this time reached the churchyard unmolested. He was just climbing the stile, when he again saw what seemed to be a white figure standing near the church. As before, it proved solid, and this time he pummelled it till his fingers bled, and for very weariness he was obliged to go home and relate his exploits. The ghost had not cried out, however, nor even so much as moved, for it was neither more nor less than a tall tombstone shining white in the moonlight.  \"Alack-a-day!\" cried the old woman, \"that I should have a son with so little wit as to beat a gravestone till his knuckles are sore! Now if he had covered it with something black that it might not alarm timid women or children, that would at least have been an act of charity.\"  \"Live and learn,\" said the cobbler. The following night he again set forth, but this time in another direction. As he was crossing a field behind his house he saw some long pieces of linen which his mother had put out to bleach in the dew.  \"More ghosts!\" cried the shoemaker, \"and they know who is behind them. They have fallen flat at the sound of my footsteps. But one must think of others as well as oneself, and it is not every heart that is as stout as mine.\" Saying which he returned to the house for something black to throw over the prostrate ghosts. Now the kitchen chimney had been swept that morning, and by the back door stood a sack of soot.  \"What is blacker than soot?\" said the cobbler; and taking the sack, he shook it out over the pieces of linen till not a thread of white was to be seen. After which he went home, and boasted of his good deeds.  The widow now saw that she must be more careful as to what she said; so, after weighing the matter for some time, she suggested to the cobbler that the next night he should watch for ghosts at home; \"for they are to be seen,\" said she, \"as well when one is in bed as in the fields.\"  \"There you are right,\" said the cobbler, \"for I have this day read of a ghost that appeared to a man in his own house. The candles burnt blue, and when he had called thrice upon the apparition, he became senseless.\"  \"That was his mistake,\" said the old woman. \"He should have turned a deaf ear, and even pretended to slumber; but it is not every one who has courage for this. If one could really fall asleep in the face of the apparition, there would be true bravery.\"  \"Leave that to me,\" said the cobbler. And the widow went off chuckling, to herself, \"If he comes to any mischance by holding his tongue and going to sleep, ill-luck has got him by the leg, and counsel is wasted on him.\"  As soon as his mother was in bed, the cobbler prepared for his watch. First he got together all the candles in the house, and stuck them here and there about the kitchen, and sat down to watch till they should burn blue. After waiting some time, during which the candles only guttered with the draughts, the cobbler decided to go to rest for a while. \"It is too early yet,\" he thought; \"I shall see nothing till midnight.\"  Very soon, however, he fell asleep; but towards morning he awoke, and in the dim light perceived a figure in white at his bedside. It was a blacksmith who lived near, and he had run in in his night-shirt without so much as slippers on his feet.  \"The ghost at last!\" thought the cobbler, and, remembering his mother's advice, he turned over and shut his eyes.  \"Neighbour! neighbour!\" cried the blacksmith, \"your house is on fire!\"  \"An old bird is not to be caught with chaff,\" chuckled the cobbler to himself; and he pulled the bed-clothes over his head.  \"Neighbour!\" roared the blacksmith, snatching at the quilt to drag it off, \"are you mad? The house is burning over your head. Get up for your life!\"  \"I have the courage of a general, and more,\" thought the cobbler; and holding tightly on to the clothes he pretended to snore.  \"If you will burn, bum!\" cried the blacksmith angrily, \"but I mean to save my bones\"--with which he ran off.  And burnt the cobbler undoubtedly would have been, had not his mother's cries at last convinced him that the candles had set fire to his house, which was wrapped in flames. With some difficulty he escaped with his life, but of all he possessed nothing remained to him but his tools and a few articles of furniture that the widow had saved.  As he was now again reduced to poverty, he was obliged to work as diligently as in former years, and passed the rest of his days in the same peace and prosperity which he had before enjoyed.     THE LAIRD AND THE MAN OF PEACE.   In the Highlands of Scotland there once lived a Laird of Brockburn, who would not believe in fairies. Although his sixth cousin on the mother's side, as he returned one night from a wedding, had seen the Men of Peace hunting on the sides of Ben Muich Dhui, dressed in green, and with silver-mounted bridles to their horses which jingled as they rode; and though Rory the fiddler having gone to play at a christening did never come home, but crossing a hill near Brockburn in a mist was seduced into a _Shian_[1] or fairy turret, where, as all decent bodies well believe, he is playing still--in spite, I say, of the wise saws and experience of all his neighbours, Brockburn remained obstinately incredulous.  [Footnote 1: _Shian_, a Gaelic name for fairy towers, which by day are not to be told from mountain crags.]  Not that he bore any ill-will to the Good People, or spoke uncivilly of them; indeed he always disavowed any feeling of disrespect towards them if they existed, saying that he was a man of peace himself, and anxious to live peaceably with whatever neighbours he had, but that till he had seen one of the _Daoiné Shi_[2] he could not believe in them.  [Footnote 2: _Daoiné Shi_ (pronounced _Dheener Shee_) = Men of Peace.]  Now one afternoon, between Hallowmas and Yule, it chanced that the Laird, being out on the hills looking for some cattle, got parted from his men and dogs and was overtaken by a mist, in which, familiar as the country was to him, he lost his way.  In vain he raised his voice high, and listened low, no sound of man or beast came back to him through the thickening vapour.  Then night fell, and darkness was added to the fog, so that Brockburn needed to sound every step with his _rung_[3] before he took it.  [Footnote 3: _Rung_ = a thick stick.]  Suddenly light footsteps pattered beside him, then Something rubbed against him, then It ran between his legs. The delighted Laird made sure that his favourite collie had found him once more.  \"Wow, Jock, man!\" he cried; \"but ye needna throw me on my face. What's got ye the night, that _you_ should lose your way in a bit mist?\"  To this a voice from the level of his elbow replied, in piping but patronizing tones;  \"Never did I lose my way in a mist since the night that Finn crossed over to Ireland in the Dawn of History. Eh, Laird! I'm weel acquaint with every bit path on the hill-side these hundreds of years, and I'll guide ye safe hame, never fear!\"  The hairs on Brockburn's head stood on end till they lifted his broad bonnet, and a damp chill broke out over him that was not the fog. But, for all that, he stoutly resisted the evidence of his senses, and only felt about him for the collie's head to pat, crying:  \"Bark! Jock, my mannie, bark! Then I'll recognize your voice, ye ken. It's no canny to hear ye speak like a Christian, my wee doggie.\"  \"I'm nae your doggie, I'm a Man of Peace,\" was the reply. \"Dinna miscall your betters, Brockburn: why will ye not credit our existence, man?\"  \"Seein's believin',\" said the Laird, stubbornly; \"but the mist's ower thick for seein' the night, ye ken.\"  \"Turn roun' to your left, man, and ye'll see,\" said the Dwarf, and catching Brockburn by the arm, he twisted him swiftly round three times, when a sudden blaze of light poured through the mist, and revealed a crag of the mountain well known to the Laird, and which he now saw to be a kind of turret, or tower.  Lights shone gaily through the crevices or windows of the _Shian_, and sounds of revelry came forth, among which fiddling was conspicuous. The tune played at that moment was \"Delvyn-side.\"  Blinded by the light, and amazed at what he saw, the Laird staggered, and was silent.  \"Keep to your feet, man--keep to your feet!\" said the Dwarf, laughing. \"I doubt ye're fou, Brockburn!\"  \"I'm nae fou,\" said the Laird, slowly, his rung grasped firmly in his hand, and his bonnet set back from his face, which was deadly pale. \"But--man-_is yon Rory?_ I'd know his fiddle in a thousand.\"  \"Ask no questions, and ye'll be tellt no lees,\" said the Dwarf. Then stepping up to the door of the _Shian_, he stood so that the light from within fell full upon him, and the astonished Laird saw a tiny but well-proportioned man, with delicate features, and golden hair flowing over his shoulders. He wore a cloak of green cloth, lined with daisies, and had silver shoes. His beautiful face quivered with amusement, and he cried triumphantly, \"D'ye see me?--d'ye see me noo, Brockburn?\"  \"Aye, aye,\" said the Laird; \"and seein's believin'.\"  \"Then roun' wi' ye!\" shouted the Man of Peace; and once more seizing the Laird by the arm, he turned him swiftly round--this time, to the right--and at the third turn the light vanished, and Brockburn and the Man of Peace were once more alone together in the mist.  \"Aweel, Brockburn,\" said the Man of Peace, \"I'll alloo ye're candid, and have a convincible mind. I'm no ill disposit to ye, and yese get safe hame, man.\"  As he spoke he stooped down, and picking up half-a-dozen big stones from the mountain-side, he gave them to the Laird, saying, \"If the gudewife asks ye about the bit stanes, say ye got them in a compliment.\"[4]  [Footnote 4: \"In a"]]]
