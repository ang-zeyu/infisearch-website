At that altar now stood the sacrificial flamen.  The countenance of Arbaces seemed to lose all its rigid calm while the aruspices inspected the entrails, and to be intent in pious anxiety--to rejoice and brighten as the signs were declared favorable, and the fire began bright and clearly to consume the sacred portion of the victim amidst odorous of myrrh and frankincense.  It was then that a dead silence fell over the whispering crowd, and the priests gathering round the cella, another priest, naked save by a cincture round the middle, rushed forward, and dancing with wild gestures, implored an answer from the goddess.  He ceased at last in exhaustion, and a low murmuring noise was heard within the body of the statue: thrice the head moved, and the lips parted, and then a hollow voice uttered these mystic words:    There are waves like chargers that meet and glow,   There are graves ready wrought in the rocks below,   On the brow of the future the dangers lour,   But blest are your barks in the fearful hour.  The voice ceased--the crowd breathed more freely--the merchants looked at each other.  'Nothing can be more plain,' murmured Diomed; 'there is to be a storm at sea, as there very often is at the beginning of autumn, but our vessels are to be saved.  O beneficent Isis!'  'Lauded eternally be the goddess!' said the merchants: 'what can be less equivocal than her prediction?'  Raising one hand in sign of silence to the people, for the rites of Isis enjoined what to the lively Pompeians was an impossible suspense from the use of the vocal organs, the chief priest poured his libation on the altar, and after a short concluding prayer the ceremony was over, and the congregation dismissed.  Still, however, as the crowd dispersed themselves here and there, the Egyptian lingered by the railing, and when the space became tolerably cleared, one of the priests, approaching it, saluted him with great appearance of friendly familiarity.  The countenance of the priest was remarkably unprepossessing--his shaven skull was so low and narrow in the front as nearly to approach to the conformation of that of an African savage, save only towards the temples, where, in that organ styled acquisitiveness by the pupils of a science modern in name, but best practically known (as their sculpture teaches us) amongst the ancients, two huge and almost preternatural protuberances yet more distorted the unshapely head--around the brows the skin was puckered into a web of deep and intricate wrinkles--the eyes, dark and small, rolled in a muddy and yellow orbit--the nose, short yet coarse, was distended at the nostrils like a satyr's--and the thick but pallid lips, the high cheek-bones, the livid and motley hues that struggled through the parchment skin, completed a countenance which none could behold without repugnance, and few without terror and distrust: whatever the wishes of the mind, the animal frame was well fitted to execute them; the wiry muscles of the throat, the broad chest, the nervous hands and lean gaunt arms, which were bared above the elbow, betokened a form capable alike of great active exertion and passive endurance.  'Calenus,' said the Egyptian to this fascinating flamen, 'you have improved the voice of the statue much by attending to my suggestion; and your verses are excellent.  Always prophesy good fortune, unless there is an absolute impossibility of its fulfilment.'  'Besides,' added Calenus, 'if the storm does come, and if it does overwhelm the accursed ships, have we not prophesied it? and are the barks not blest to be at rest?--for rest prays the mariner in the AEgean sea, or at least so says Horace--can the mariner be more at rest in the sea than when he is at the bottom of it?'  'Right, my Calenus; I wish Apaecides would take a lesson from your wisdom. But I desire to confer with you relative to him and to other matters: you can admit me into one of your less sacred apartments?'  'Assuredly,' replied the priest, leading the way to one of the small chambers which surrounded the open gate.  Here they seated themselves before a small table spread with dishes containing fruit and eggs, and various cold meats, with vases of excellent wine, of which while the companions partook, a curtain, drawn across the entrance opening to the court, concealed them from view, but admonished them by the thinness of the partition to speak low, or to speak no secrets: they chose the former alternative.  'Thou knowest,' said Arbaces, in a voice that scarcely stirred the air, so soft and inward was its sound, 'that it has ever been my maxim to attach myself to the young.  From their flexile and unformed minds I can carve out my fittest tools.  I weave--I warp--I mould them at my will. Of the men I make merely followers or servants; of the women...'  'Mistresses,' said Calenus, as a livid grin distorted his ungainly features.  'Yes, I do not disguise it: woman is the main object, the great appetite, of my soul.  As you feed the victim for the slaughter, I love to rear the votaries of my pleasure.  I love to train, to ripen their minds--to unfold the sweet blossom of their hidden passions, in order to prepare the fruit to my taste.  I loathe your ready-made and ripened courtesans; it is in the soft and unconscious progress of innocence to desire that I find the true charm of love; it is thus that I defy satiety; and by contemplating the freshness of others, I sustain the freshness of my own sensations.  From the young hearts of my victims I draw the ingredients of the caldron in which I re-youth myself.  But enough of this: to the subject before us.  You know, then, that in Neapolis some time since I encountered Ione and Apaecides, brother and sister, the children of Athenians who had settled at Neapolis. The death of their parents, who knew and esteemed me, constituted me their guardian.  I was not unmindful of the trust. The youth, docile and mild, yielded readily to the impression I sought to stamp upon him.  Next to woman, I love the old recollections of my ancestral land; I love to keep alive--to propagate on distant shores (which her colonies perchance yet people) her dark and mystic creeds.  It may be, that it pleases me to delude mankind, while I thus serve the deities.  To Apaecides I taught the solemn faith of Isis.  I unfolded to him something of those sublime allegories which are couched beneath her worship.  I excited in a soul peculiarly alive to religious fervor that enthusiasm which imagination begets on faith.  I have placed him amongst you: he is one of you.'  'He is so,' said Calenus: 'but in thus stimulating his faith, you have robbed him of wisdom.  He is horror-struck that he is no longer duped: our sage delusions, our speaking statues and secret staircases dismay and revolt him; he pines; he wastes away; he mutters to himself; he refuses to share our ceremonies.  He has been known to frequent the company of men suspected of adherence to that new and atheistical creed which denies all our gods, and terms our oracles the inspirations of that malevolent spirit of which eastern tradition speaks.  Our oracles--alas! we know well whose inspirations they are!'  'This is what I feared,' said Arbaces, musingly, 'from various reproaches he made me when I last saw him.  Of late he hath shunned my steps.  I must find him: I must continue my lessons: I must lead him into the adytum of Wisdom. I must teach him that there are two stages of sanctity--the first, FAITH--the next, DELUSION; the one for the vulgar, the second for the sage.'  'I never passed through the first, I said Calenus; 'nor you either, I think, my Arbaces.'  'You err,' replied the Egyptian, gravely.  'I believe at this day (not indeed that which I teach, but that which I teach not).  Nature has a sanctity against which I cannot (nor would I) steel conviction.  I believe in mine own knowledge, and that has revealed to me--but no matter.  Now to earthlier and more inviting themes.  If I thus fulfilled my object with Apaecides, what was my design for Ione?  Thou knowest already I intend her for my queen--my bride--my heart's Isis.  Never till I saw her knew I all the love of which my nature is capable.'  'I hear from a thousand lips that she is a second Helen,' said Calenus; and he smacked his own lips, but whether at the wine or at the notion it is not easy to decide.  'Yes, she has a beauty that Greece itself never excelled,' resumed Arbaces. 'But that is not all: she has a soul worthy to match with mine. She has a genius beyond that of woman--keen--dazzling--bold. Poetry flows spontaneous to her lips: utter but a truth, and, however intricate and profound, her mind seizes and commands it.  Her imagination and her reason are not at war with each other; they harmonize and direct her course as the winds and the waves direct some lofty bark.  With this she unites a daring independence of thought; she can stand alone in the world; she can be brave as she is gentle; this is the nature I have sought all my life in woman, and never found till now.  Ione must be mine!  In her I have a double passion; I wish to enjoy a beauty of spirit as of form.'  'She is not yours yet, then?' said the priest.  'No; she loves me--but as a friend--she loves me with her mind only. She fancies in me the paltry virtues which I have only the profounder virtue to disdain.  But you must pursue with me her history. The brother and sister were young and rich: Ione is proud and ambitious--proud of her genius--the magic of her poetry--the charm of her conversation. When her brother left me, and entered your temple, in order to be near him she removed also to Pompeii.  She has suffered her talents to be known.  She summons crowds to her feasts; her voice enchants them; her poetry subdues.  She delights in being thought the successor of Erinna.'  'Or of Sappho?'  'But Sappho without love!  I encouraged her in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1565"],["title","The Last Days of Pompeii (#8)"],["body","boldness of career--in this indulgence of vanity and of pleasure.  I loved to steep her amidst the dissipations and luxury of this abandoned city.  Mark me, Calenus!  I desired to enervate her mind!--it has been too pure to receive yet the breath which I wish not to pass, but burningly to eat into, the mirror.  I wished her to be surrounded by lovers, hollow, vain, and frivolous (lovers that her nature must despise), in order to feel the want of love.  Then, in those soft intervals of lassitude that succeed to excitement--I can weave my spells--excite her interest--attract her passions--possess myself of her heart.  For it is not the young, nor the beautiful, nor the gay, that should fascinate Ione; her imagination must be won, and the life of Arbaces has been one scene of triumph over the imaginations of his kind.'  'And hast thou no fear, then, of thy rivals?  The gallants of Italy are skilled in the art to please.'  'None!  Her Greek soul despises the barbarian Romans, and would scorn itself if it admitted a thought of love for one of that upstart race.'  'But thou art an Egyptian, not a Greek!'  'Egypt,' replied Arbaces, 'is the mother of Athens.  Her tutelary Minerva is our deity; and her founder, Cecrops, was the fugitive of Egyptian Sais. This have I already taught to her; and in my blood she venerates the eldest dynasties of earth.  But yet I will own that of late some uneasy suspicions have crossed my mind.  She is more silent than she used to be; she loves melancholy and subduing music; she sighs without an outward cause.  This may be the beginning of love--it may be the want of love.  In either case it is time for me to begin my operations on her fancies and her heart: in the one case, to divert the source of love to me; in the other, in me to awaken it. It is for this that I have sought you.'  'And how can I assist you?'  'I am about to invite her to a feast in my house: I wish to dazzle--to bewilder--to inflame her senses.  Our arts--the arts by which Egypt trained her young novitiates--must be employed; and, under veil of the mysteries of religion, I will open to her the secrets of love.'  'Ah! now I understand:--one of those voluptuous banquets that, despite our dull vows of mortified coldness, we, the priests of Isis, have shared at thy house.'  'No, no!  Thinkest thou her chaste eyes are ripe for such scenes? No; but first we must ensnare the brother--an easier task.  Listen to me, while I give you my instructions.'    Chapter V  MORE OF THE FLOWER-GIRL.  THE PROGRESS OF LOVE.  THE sun shone gaily into that beautiful chamber in the house of Glaucus, which I have before said is now called the 'Room of Leda'.  The morning rays entered through rows of small casements at the higher part of the room, and through the door which opened on the garden, that answered to the inhabitants of the southern cities the same purpose that a greenhouse or conservatory does to us.  The size of the garden did not adapt it for exercise, but the various and fragrant plants with which it was filled gave a luxury to that indolence so dear to the dwellers in a sunny clime.  And now the odorous, fanned by a gentle wind creeping from the adjacent sea, scattered themselves over that chamber, whose walls vied with the richest colors of the most glowing flowers.  Besides the gem of the room--the painting of Leda and Tyndarus--in the centre of each compartment of the walls were set other pictures of exquisite beauty.  In one you saw Cupid leaning on the knees of Venus; in another Ariadne sleeping on the beach, unconscious of the perfidy of Theseus. Merrily the sunbeams played to and fro on the tessellated floor and the brilliant walls--far more happily came the rays of joy to the heart of the young Glaucus.  'I have seen her, then,' said he, as he paced that narrow chamber--'I have heard her--nay, I have spoken to her again--I have listened to the music of her song, and she sung of glory and of Greece.  I have discovered the long-sought idol of my dreams; and like the Cyprian sculptor, I have breathed life into my own imaginings.'  Longer, perhaps, had been the enamoured soliloquy of Glaucus, but at that moment a shadow darkened the threshold of the chamber, and a young female, still half a child in years, broke upon his solitude.  She was dressed simply in a white tunic, which reached from the neck to the ankles; under her arm she bore a basket of flowers, and in the other hand she held a bronze water-vase; her features were more formed than exactly became her years, yet they were soft and feminine in their outline, and without being beautiful in themselves, they were almost made so by their beauty of expression; there was something ineffably gentle, and you would say patient, in her aspect.  A look of resigned sorrow, of tranquil endurance, had banished the smile, but not the sweetness, from her lips; something timid and cautious in her step--something wandering in her eyes, led you to suspect the affliction which she had suffered from her birth--she was blind; but in the orbs themselves there was no visible defect--their melancholy and subdued light was clear, cloudless, and serene. 'They tell me that Glaucus is here,' said she; 'may I come in?'  'Ah, my Nydia,' said the Greek, 'is that you I knew you would not neglect my invitation.'  'Glaucus did but justice to himself,' answered Nydia, with a blush; 'for he has always been kind to the poor blind girl.'  'Who could be otherwise?' said Glaucus, tenderly, and in the voice of a compassionate brother.  Nydia sighed and paused before she resumed, without replying to his remark. 'You have but lately returned?'  'This is the sixth sun that hath shone upon me at Pompeii.'  'And you are well?  Ah, I need not ask--for who that sees the earth, which they tell me is so beautiful, can be ill?'  'I am well.  And you, Nydia--how you have grown!  Next year you will be thinking what answer to make your lovers.'  A second blush passed over the cheek of Nydia, but this time she frowned as she blushed.  'I have brought you some flowers,' said she, without replying to a remark that she seemed to resent; and feeling about the room till she found the table that stood by Glaucus, she laid the basket upon it: 'they are poor, but they are fresh-gathered.'  'They might come from Flora herself,' said he, kindly; 'and I renew again my vow to the Graces, that I will wear no other garlands while thy hands can weave me such as these.'  'And how find you the flowers in your viridarium?--are they thriving?'  'Wonderfully so--the Lares themselves must have tended them.'  'Ah, now you give me pleasure; for I came, as often as I could steal the leisure, to water and tend them in your absence.'  'How shall I thank thee, fair Nydia?' said the Greek.  'Glaucus little dreamed that he left one memory so watchful over his favorites at Pompeii.'  The hand of the child trembled, and her breast heaved beneath her tunic. She turned round in embarrassment.  'The sun is hot for the poor flowers,' said she, 'to-day and they will miss me; for I have been ill lately, and it is nine days since I visited them.'  'Ill, Nydia!--yet your cheek has more color than it had last year.'  'I am often ailing,' said the blind girl, touchingly; 'and as I grow up I grieve more that I am blind.  But now to the flowers!' So saying, she made a slight reverence with her head, and passing into the viridarium, busied herself with watering the flowers.  'Poor Nydia,' thought Glaucus, gazing on her; 'thine is a hard doom! Thou seest not the earth--nor the sun--nor the ocean--nor the stars--above all, thou canst not behold Ione.'  At that last thought his mind flew back to the past evening, and was a second time disturbed in its reveries by the entrance of Clodius.  It was a proof how much a single evening had sufficed to increase and to refine the love of the Athenian for Ione, that whereas he had confided to Clodius the secret of his first interview with her, and the effect it had produced on him, he now felt an invincible aversion even to mention to him her name.  He had seen Ione, bright, pure, unsullied, in the midst of the gayest and most profligate gallants of Pompeii, charming rather than awing the boldest into respect, and changing the very nature of the most sensual and the least ideal--as by her intellectual and refining spells she reversed the fable of Circe, and converted the animals into men.  They who could not understand her soul were made spiritual, as it were, by the magic of her beauty--they who had no heart for poetry had ears, at least, for the melody of her voice. Seeing her thus surrounded, purifying and brightening all things with her presence, Glaucus almost for the first time felt the nobleness of his own nature--he felt how unworthy of the goddess of his dreams had been his companions and his pursuits.  A veil seemed lifted from his eyes; he saw that immeasurable distance between himself and his associates which the deceiving mists of pleasure had hitherto concealed; he was refined by a sense of his courage in aspiring to Ione.  He felt that henceforth it was his destiny to look upward and to soar.  He could no longer breathe that name, which sounded to the sense of his ardent fancy as something sacred and divine, to lewd and vulgar ears.  She was no longer the beautiful girl once seen and passionately remembered--she was already the mistress, the divinity of his soul.  This feeling who has not experienced?--If thou hast not, then thou hast never loved.  When Clodius therefore spoke to him in affected transport of the beauty of Ione, Glaucus felt only resentment and disgust that such lips should dare to praise her; he answered coldly, and the Roman imagined that his passion was cured instead of heightened.  Clodius scarcely regretted it, for he was anxious that Glaucus should marry an heiress yet more richly endowed--Julia, the daughter of the wealthy Diomed, whose gold the gamester imagined he could readily"]]]
