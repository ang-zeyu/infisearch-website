Across the broad driveway and up the steps of the veranda passed Mrs. Cary, fairer than had been the flowers, a true daughter of the oldtime South, gentle and quiet eyed, her light summer dress of the cheapest material, yet deftly fashioned by her own fingers from slightly opened neck, where an old brooch lay against her soft throat, down to the dainty spotless flounces lying above her petticoat of crinoline.  Though her lips and eyes refused to betray it even when there was no one to see, it was with a very heavy heart that she mounted the stairs to the attic, thinking, contriving, clutching desperately at her fading hopes.  For good reason the plantation was very silent on this warm spring morning. Where only a year before dozens of soft eyed Jerseys had ranged through the pastures and wood lots there was now no sound of tinkling bells--one after another the fine, blooded stock had been requisitioned by a sad faced quartermaster of the Army of Northern Virginia. And one by one the fat porkers who had muzzled greedily among the ears from the Cary bins and who ought to have gone into the smoke house had departed, squealing, to furnish bone and sinew with which to repel the invader. Saddest of all, the chicken coops down by the deserted negro quarters were quite as empty as the once teeming cabins themselves. Poverty, grim and relentless, had caught the Carys in its iron hand and behind Poverty stood its far more frightening shadow--Starvation.  But in these gloomy thoughts she was not entirely alone. All that troubled her and more, though perhaps in a different way, passed hourly through the old gray kinky head of Uncle Billy who happened at this very moment to be emerging stealthily from the woods below the house. Slowly and deliberately he made his way toward the front till he reached a bench where he sat down under a tree to ruminate over the situation and inspect the feathered prize which he had lately acquired by certain, devious means known only to Uncle Billy. Wiping his forehead with his ragged sleeve and holding the bird up by its tied feet he regarded it with the eye of an expert, and the fatigue of one who has been sorely put to it in order to accomplish his purpose.  \"It 'pears to me,\" said Uncle Billy, \"dat des' when you needs 'em the mostest the chickens goes to roosting higher 'n' higher. Rooster--I wonder who you b'longs to. Um-_um_!\" he murmured as he thoughtfully sounded the rooster's well developed chest through the feathers. \"From de feelin' of you, my son, I 'spec' you was raise' by one er de ol'es' fam'lies what is!\"  But Uncle Billy knew the fortunes of the Cary family far too well to mourn over the probable toughness of his booty, and as he rose up from the seat and meandered toward the kitchen, his old, wrinkled face broke into a broad smile of satisfaction over the surprise he had in store. \"Well--after I done parbile you, I reckon Miss Hallie be mighty glad to see you. Yas, _seh_!\"  But as Uncle Billy walked slowly along beside the hedge which shielded the house on one side he heard a sound which made him halt. A young negro, coming from the rear, had dodged behind the hedge and was trying to keep out of his sight.  \"Hi, dar! You, Jeems Henry!\" shouted Uncle Billy, instantly suspicious of such maneuvers. \"Come heh! Hear _me_! Come heh!\"  At this sudden command a young mulatto, hesitating, came through a break in the hedge and stood looking at him, sullen and silent. In his hands he carried a small bundle done up in a colored handkerchief and on this guilty piece of baggage Uncle Billy's eye immediately fastened with an angry frown.  \"Whar you gwine?\" demanded Uncle Billy, with an accusing finger trembling at the bundle.  The younger man made no reply.  \"Hear _me_?\" the elder demanded again in rising tones of severity. \"Ain't you got no tongue in yo' haid? Whar you gwine?\"  Shifting from one foot to the other the younger man finally broke away from Uncle Billy's eye and tried to pass him by.  \"Den _I'll_ tell you whar you gwine,\" shouted Uncle Billy, furious at last. \"You's runnin' 'way to de Yankees, dat's whar you gwine.\"  At this too truthful thrust Jeems Henry saw that further deceit would be futile and he faced Uncle Billy with sullen resentment.  \"An' s'posin' I _is_--wat den?\"  \"Den you's a thief,\" retorted Uncle Billy with dismayingly quick wit. \"Dat's what you is--a _thief_.\"  \"I _ain'_ no thief,\" Jeems Henry refuted stubbornly, \"_I_ ain' stole nothin'.\"  \"You is too,\" and Uncle Billy's forefinger began to shake in the other's face. \"You's stealin' a _nigger_!\"  \"What dat?\" and Jeems Henry's eyes opened wide with amazement. \"What you talkin' 'bout?\"  \"Talkin' 'bout _you_,\" replied Uncle Billy, sharper than ever. \"Dey say a nigger's wuth a thousan' dollars. 'Cose _you_ ain't wuth dat much,\" he said with utter disgust. \"I put you down at a dollar and a quarter. But dat ain't de p'int,\" and he steadily advanced on the other till their faces were only a few inches apart. \"It's dis. _You_, Jeems Henry, belongs to Mars' Herbert Cary an' Miss Hallie; an' when you runs 'way you's stealin'. _You's stealin yo'sef!_\"  \"H'm!\" sniffed Jeems Henry, now that the nature and extent of his crime were fully understood. \"Ef I ain' wuth but a dollar an' a quarter, I suttenly ain' stealin' _much_!\"  At this smart reply Uncle Billy's disgust overcame him completely and he tossed the rooster on the ground and clutched Jeems Henry by the arm.  \"You mighty right, you ain't!\" he shouted. \"An' ef I was fo' years younger I'd take it outer yo' hide with a carriage whip. Hol' on dar,\" as Jeems Henry eluded his grasp and began to move away. \"Which way you gwine? You hear me? Now den!\"  \"I gwine up de river,\" replied Jeems Henry, badgered at last into revealing his plan. Then, after a cautious look around,--\"to Chickahominy Swamp,\" he added in lower tones.  Uncle Billy cocked his ears. Here was news indeed.  \"Chickahominy, huh! So de Yankees is up dar, is dey? An' what you think you gwine to do when you git to 'em?\"  \"Wuck 'roun de camp,\" replied Jeems Henry with some vagueness.  \"Doin' what?\" was the relentless query.  \"Blackin' de gent'men's boots--an'--an' gittin' paid fer it,\" Jeems Henry stammered in reply. \"It's better'n being a slave, Unc' Billy,\" he added as he saw the sneer of contempt on the faithful old man's face. \"An' ef you wan' sech a crazy ol' fool, you'd come along wid me, too.\"  At this combination of temptation and insult Uncle Billy's eyes narrowed with contempt and loathing. \"Me?\" he said, and a rigid arm pointed back at the house which had been for years his source of shelter and comfort. \"Me leave Miss Hallie _now_? Right when she ain't got _nothin_'? Look heah, nigger; dog-gone yo' skin, I got a great min' for to mash yo' mouf. Yas, I _is_ a slave. I b'longs to Mars Cary--an' I b'longed to his pa befo' him. Dey feed me and gimme de bes' dey got. Dey take care of me when I'm sick--an' dey take care of me when I'm well--an' _I_ gwine to stay right here. But you? You jes' go on wid de Yankees, an' black der boots. Dey'll free you,\" and Uncle Billy's voice rose in prophetic tones--\"an you'll _keep on_ blackin' boots! Go 'long now, you low-down, dollar-an'-a-quarter nigger!\" as Jeems Henry backed away. \"Go long wid yo' _Yankee_ marsters--and git yo' freedom an' a blackin' brush.\"  So engrossed were both the actors in this drama that they failed to hear the sound of footsteps on the veranda, and it was so that the mistress of the manor found the would-be runaway and the old slave, glaring into each other's eyes and insulting one another volubly.  Mrs. Cary, with her workbasket on her arm, paused at the top of the steps and regarded the angry pair with well-bred surprise.  \"Why, Uncle Billy,\" she queried, \"what is going on here? What _is_ the matter?\"  \"It's Jeems Henry; dat's what's de matter,\" said Uncle Billy, in defense of his agitation. \"He's runnin' 'way to de Yankees.\"  Mrs. Cary stopped short for a moment and then came slowly down the steps.  \"Oh, James,\" she said, unbelievingly. \"Is this really true?\"  Jeems Henry hung his head and dug at the gravel with his toe.  \"I'm sorry,\" said Mrs. Cary, and the word held a world of painful thought--of self-accusation, of hopeless regret, of sorrow for one who could be so foolishly misguided. \"I'm sorry not only for ourselves but for _you_. You know, I promised Mammy before she died that I would look after you--always.\"  Still Jeems Henry made no answer and old Uncle Billy saw fit to make a disclosure.  \"He's gwine up to Chickahominy.\" Then to Jeems Henry he added something in low tones which made the young negro's eyes roll wildly with fear. \"Dey tells me dat der's _hants_ and _ghoses_ over dar. I hopes dey'll git you.\"  \"Stop that!\" commanded Mrs. Cary. \"You know very well, Uncle Billy, there are no such things as ghosts.\"  \"Nor'm I don't, Miss Hallie,\" responded Uncle Billy, sticking tenaciously to his point, because he could plainly see Jeems Henry wavering. \"'Twas jes las' night I hear one--moanin' 'roun' de smoke house. An' ef I ain't mighty fur wrong, she was smellin' arfter Jeems Henry.\"  At this wild fabrication, the reason for which she nevertheless appreciated, Mrs. Cary had hard work to hold back a smile, although she promptly reassured the terrified Jeems Henry.  \"There now--there--that will do. Nothing of that kind will trouble you, James; you may take my word for it. If you are quite determined to go I shall not try to keep you. But what have you in that bundle?\"  \"Hi! Hi! Dat's de way to talk!\" interrupted Uncle Billy, excitedly foreseeing means to prevent Jeems Henry's departure. \"What you got in yo' bundle?\"  Jeems Henry lifted his anguished eyes and gazed truthfully at his mistress.  \"I ain't got nothin'--what don't b'long to me, Miss Hallie.\"  \"I don't mean that,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15414"],["title","The Littlest Rebel (#2)"],["body",". Cary responded kindly. \"But you have a long tramp before you. Have you anything to eat?\"  \"Nor'm, I ain't,\" and Jeems Henry seemed disturbed.  \"Then you'd better come around to the kitchen. We'll see what we can find.\"  At this unheard-of generosity, Uncle Billy's eyes opened widely and he exploded in remonstrance.  \"Now, hol' on dar, Miss Hallie! Hol' on. You ain' got none too much fo' yo'se'f, d'out stuffin' dis yere six-bit rat hole wid waffles an' milasses.\"  \"_William!_\" commanded his mistress.  \"Yas'm,\" was the meek response, and Uncle Billy subsided into silence.  With a sigh, Mrs. Cary turned away toward the house. \"Well, James, are you coming?\"  But Jeems Henry, completely abashed before this miracle of kindness which he did not deserve, decided that it was time for him to be a man.  \"Thank you, Miss Hallie,\" he gulped, \"but f'um now on I reckon I gwine take keer of myse'f.\"  Mrs. Cary, pausing on the bottom step, raised her eyes heavenward in a short prayer that children such as these might somehow be protected from themselves.  \"Well, James,\" she said, when she saw there was nothing more to be done. \"I hope you'll be happy and contented. If you are not--come back to us. Perhaps, when the war is over, you'll find things a little more--comfortable. Good-by, James,\" and she held out her hand.  But this last touch of gentleness was too much for the young mulatto. Although he made an obedient step forward, his feelings overcame him and with an audible snuffle and his hand over his eyes he retreated--then turned his back and plunged through the hedge.  Mrs. Cary sank down on the step and looked as if she, too, would like to cry.  Manfully, Uncle Billy came to her rescue. \"Now don't you care, Miss Hallie. He wan' no 'count for plowin' no how.\"  \"Oh, it isn't that, Uncle Billy,\" Mrs. Cary replied with a low cry of regret. \"It isn't the actual loss of help, tho' we need it, goodness knows. But it makes me sad to see them leaving, one by one. They are such children and so helpless--without a master hand.\"  \"Yas'm,\" agreed Uncle Billy readily. \"An' de marster's han' ought to have a hick'ry stick in it fer _dat_ nigger. Yas, bless Gawd. But you got _me_, Miss Hallie,\" he announced proudly. \"_I_ ain't runned away to de blue-bellies yet.\"  \"No, you dear old thing,\" Mrs. Cary cried with laughing relief, and her hand rested on his shoulder in a gentle caress. \"I'd as soon think of the skies falling. It is just such faithful friends as you who help me to fight the best.\"  \"Um?\" said Uncle Billy promptly, not quite understanding.  \"I mean a woman's battles, Uncle Billy--the _waiting_ battles--that we fight alone.\" Mrs. Gary rose to her feet and turned sadly away.  \"Yas'm,\" agreed Uncle Billy. \"I dunno what yo' talkin' 'bout but I spec' you's right. Yas'm.\"  \"Dear Uncle Billy,\" repeated Mrs. Gary, while her eyes filled with tears. \"The most truthful--the most _honest_--\"  Mrs. Cary stopped and looked sharply at something lying on the ground beside the steps. Then she turned and swept the old man with an accusing glance which made him quail.  \"_William!_\" she said, in awful tones.  \"Yas'm,\" replied Uncle Billy, feverishly.  \"What's _that_?\"  Uncle Billy immediately became the very picture of innocence and ignorance. He looked everywhere but at the helpless rooster.  \"What's what?\" he asked. \"Aw, dat? Why--why, dat ain' nothin' 'tall, Miss Hallie. Dat's--dat's des a _rooster_. Yas'm.\"  Mrs. Cary came down from the steps and looked carefully at the unfamiliar bird. No fear that she would not recognize it if it were hers. \"Whose is he?\" she asked.  \"You--you mean who he b'longs to?\" queried Uncle Billy, fencing for time in which to prepare a quasi-truthful reply. \"He--he don' b'long to _nobody_. He's his _own_ rooster.\"  \"William!\" commanded Mrs. Cary, severely. \"Look at me. _Where_ did you get him?\"  Here was a situation which Uncle Billy knew must be handled promptly, and he picked up the rooster and made an attempt to escape. \"Down on de low grouns--dis mornin'. Dat's right,\" he said, as he saw dawning unbelief in his mistress' face. \"Now you have to skuse me, Miss Hallie. I got my wuck to do.\"  \"One moment, William,\" interposed Mrs. Cary, completely unconvinced. \"You are sure he was on the low grounds?\"  \"Cose I is!\" asseverated Uncle Billy, meanwhile backing farther away.  \"What was he doing there?\"  Uncle Billy stammered.  \"He--he--he, he was trespassin', dat's what he was doin'--des natcherly trespassin'.\"  At this marvel of testimony, Mrs. Cary's lips relaxed in a smile and she warned him with an upraised finger.  \"Be careful, Uncle Billy! Be careful.\"  \"Yas, _mar'm_\" chuckled the old man. \"I _had_ to be. I never would a-got him! Oh, I's tellin' de trufe, Miss Hallie. Dis' here ol' sinner tooken flewed off a boat what was comin' up de river. Yas'm. And he sure was old enough to know better.\"  \"And you _saw_ him fly off the boat?\"  \"Oh, yas'm. I seed him. I seed him,\" and Uncle Billy floundered for a moment, caught in his own trap. \"Dat is, not wid my own eyes. But I see him settin' in de woods, lookin' dat lonesome and losted like, I felt real sorry for him. Yas'm,\" and to prove his deep sympathy for the unfortunate bird he stroked its breast lovingly.  Mrs. Cary turned away to hide her laughter. \"How did you catch him?\"  \"How?\" repeated Uncle Billy, while his ancient mind worked with unusual rapidity. \"I got down on all fo's in the thick weeds, an' cluk like a hen. An' den ol' Mr. Rooster, he came 'long over to see ef I done laid an aig--an' I des reach right out an' take him home to de Lawd.\"  \"Oh, Uncle Billy,\" his mistress laughed. \"I'm afraid you're incorrigible. It's a dreadful thing to doubt one's very dinner. Isn't it?\"  \"Yas'm. An' I was des 'bout to say ef you an' Miss Virgie kin worry down de white meat, maybe den dis here bird 'll kinder git eben wid me when I tackle his drum sticks. Yas'm,\" and with a final chuckle of joy over his success the old man hobbled quickly away in the direction of the kitchen.  Mrs. Cary, still smiling, went back to play Mrs. Fatima to a dusky moss-covered Blue Beard.  \"Oh goody, goody, here is Mrs. Fatima again!\" and Virgie's dancing feet seemed hardly to touch the ground. \"We've just finished building the castle. Look!\" She pointed proudly to a square of twigs and leaves around the garden seat. \"Come on, Sally Ann. We can play it now and use Mamma's keys.\"  \"Wait dar! Whar'd I put my s'wode?\" And Sally Ann snatched up her dangerous weapon and thrust it into a rope around her waist. \"Now I'se ready fo' killin' folks.\"  \"But we have to begin where Blue Beard goes away on a journey,\" Virgie cried. \"Susan Jemima, you sit there on the bench and clap your hands. Get up, Mamma. Go ahead, Sally Ann!\"  \"'Ooman,\" said Sally Ann, strutting up to her mistress and frowning terribly. \"I'se gwine away fer a night an' a day. Dese yere is de keys to de castle.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" was the meek response.  Sally Ann Blue Beard pointed to an imaginary door halfway between them and where Virgie sat on the steps, wriggling with delight. \"You kin look in ev'ry room in de house--castle, I means--'cept in des dat one. Orn'estan me? _Des dat one!_ But ef yo' looks in _dar_,--Gawd he'p you. I gwine cut yo' haid off,\" and the fearful sword whizzed threateningly through the air. \"Fyarwell--fyarwell.\"  \"Farewell, my lord,\" said Mrs. Cary, and then in a whisper, as Blue Beard stalked away to hide behind a tree. \"What _do_ we do now? _Quick_!\"  \"Now I come in,\" cried Virgie. \"I'm 'Sister Anne' that looks for the horseman in the cloud of dust.\" And jumping up, the child managed to change the tones of her voice in a surprising manner.  \"Good morning, fair sister. Blue Beard has gone away, and now we can look in his secret room.\"  \"No, Sister Anne, No! I dare not,\" and Mrs. Fatima shrank back full of fear from the imaginary door. \"Urge me no more. I am afraid.\"  \"But, Mother,\" cried Virgie, with a little squeal of disappointment. \"You _have_ to. It's part of the play,\" and she led her up to the invisible door.  \"Now look in--and when you look--drop the keys--an' we'll both scream.\"  Slowly the door seemed to open and, after an instant's terrified silence, both actresses screamed with complete success. Whereupon Mrs. Fatima dropped to her knees and Sister Anne hugged her tight.  \"It's blood. It's the blood of his seven wives. O-o-o-e-e-e!\"  A great roar sounded in their ears.  \"Mercy! What's that?\" cried the terrified Mrs. Fatima.  \"It's Blue Beard. He's coming back,\" whereupon Virgie immediately left Mrs. Fatima to face her fate alone.  Having spent a night and a day behind the tree, Blue Beard now rushed upon the castle and roared for his wife.  \"Greeting, my lord,\" said the trembling Mrs. Fatima with a low curtsey \"I hope you have enjoyed your journey.\"  \"'Ooman,\" demanded Blue Beard severely. \"What make you look so pale?\"  \"I know not, sweet sir. Am I, then, so pale?\"  \"You is! What you be'n up to sence I be'n away? Ha! What I tole you? Look at de blood on dat key! False 'ooman, you done deceib' me. Down on yo' marrow bones an' prepyar to die!\"  \"Spare me, my lord. Spare me! I am so--\"  It was just about this time that old Uncle Billy, with a bridle in one hand and a carriage whip in the other came slowly upon the scene. At the sight of Sally Ann apparently about to assault his mistress the bridle dropped from his hand and with a tight clutch on the carriage whip he covered the intervening space at an amazing speed.  \"Hi, dar! You li'l woolly haided imp! You tech Miss Hallie wid dat ar stick an' I bus' you wide open!\"  \"Oh, stop, Uncle Billy!\" cried Virgie in dismay. \"We're only having a play!\"  \"Maybe you is; but I lay ef I wrop my carriage whip roun' her laig, des oncet, she'll hop all de way to de river.\"  At this dismal prospect, which seemed much truer than the play, Sally Ann began to whimper loudly. \"Miss Hallie, ef he stay here, I ain't gwine to play.\"  \"Whar you git dem whiskers at?\" demanded Uncle "]]]
