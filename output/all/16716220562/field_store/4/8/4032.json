And Curdken said, \"When we go in the morning through the dark gate with our flock of geese, she weeps, and talks with the head of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says--        \"'Falada, Falada, there thou art hanging!'\"  and the head answers--        \"'Bride, bride, there thou art ganging!       Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,       Sadly, sadly her heart would rue it.'\"  And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow where the geese fed; and how his hat was blown away, and he was forced to run after it, and leave his flock. But the old king told him to go out again as usual the next day, and when morning came, the king placed himself behind the gate, and heard how she spoke to Falada, and how Falada answered; and then he went into the field and hid himself in a bush by the meadow's side, and soon saw with his own eyes how they drove the flock of geese, and how, after a little time, she let down her hair that glittered in the sun; and then he heard her say--        \"Blow, breezes, blow!       Let Curdken's hat go!       Blow, breezes, blow!       Let him after it go!       O'er hills, dales, and rocks,       Away be it whirl'd,       Till the golden locks,       Are all comb'd and curl'd!\"  [Illustration: \"THEN THERE CAME A WIND SO STRONG THAT IT BLEW OFF CURDKEN'S HAT.\"]  And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken's hat, while the girl went on combing and curling her hair.  All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and when the little goose girl came back in the evening, he called her aside, and asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, \"That I must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.\"  But the old king begged so hard that she had no peace till she had told him all, word for word: and it was very lucky for her that she did so, for the king ordered royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was so beautiful.  Then he called his son, and told him that he had only the false bride, for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true one stood by.  And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and heard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything, ordered a great feast to be got ready for all his court.  The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one side, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her, for she was quite dazzling to their eyes, and was not at all like the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress.  When they had eaten and drunk, and were very merry, the old king told all the story, as one that he had once heard of, and asked the true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would behave thus.  \"Nothing better,\" said this false bride, \"than that she should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to street till she is dead.\"  \"Thou art she!\" said the old king; \"and since thou hast judged thyself, it shall be so done to thee.\"  And the young king was married to his true wife, and they reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives.     [Illustration]  LITTLE SNOW-WHITE   It was in the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling around, that a certain queen sat working at the window, the frame of which was made of fine black ebony; and as she was looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three drops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red drops which sprinkled the white snow, and said, \"Would that my little daughter may be as white as that snow, as red as the blood, and as black as the ebony window-frame!\" And so the little girl grew up: her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as blood, and her hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snow-White.  But this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who was very beautiful, but so proud that she could not bear to think that any one could surpass her. She had a magical looking-glass, to which she used to go and gaze upon herself in it, and say,        \"Tell me, glass, tell me true!       Of all the ladies in the land.       Who is fairest? Tell me who?\"  And the glass answered, \"Thou, Queen, art fairest in the land.\"  But Snow-White grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years old, she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself. Then the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to consult it as usual:        \"Thou, Queen, may'st fair and beauteous be,       But Snow-White is lovelier far than thee!\"  When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy; and calling to one of her servants said, \"Take Snow-White away into the wide wood, that I may never see her more.\" Then the servant led her away; but his heart melted when she begged him to spare her life, and he said, \"I will not hurt thee, thou pretty child.\" So he left her by herself, and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would tear her to pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her, but leave her to her fate.  [Illustration]  Then poor Snow-White wandered along through the wood in great fear; and the wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the evening she came to a little cottage, and went in there to rest herself, for her weary feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there were seven little plates with seven little loaves and seven little glasses with wine in them; and knives and forks laid in order, and by the wall stood seven little beds. Then, as she was very hungry, she picked a little piece off each loaf, and drank a very little wine out of each glass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she tried all the little beds; and one was too long, and another was too short, till at last the seventh suited her; and there she laid herself down and went to sleep. Presently in came the masters of the cottage, who were seven little dwarfs that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched about for gold. They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw directly that all was not right. The first said, \"Who has been sitting on my stool?\" The second, \"Who has been eating off my plate?\" The third, \"Who has been picking at my bread?\" the fourth, \"Who has been meddling with my spoon?\" The fifth, \"Who has been handling my fork?\" The sixth, \"Who has been cutting with my knife?\" The seventh, \"Who has been drinking my wine?\" Then the first looked round and said. \"Who has been lying on my bed?\" And the rest came running to him, and every one cried out that somebody had been upon his bed. But the seventh saw Snow-White, and called upon his brethren to come and see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment, and brought their lamps to look at her, and said, \"Good heavens! What a lovely child she is!\" and they were delighted to see her, and took care not to waken her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs in turn, till the night was gone.  [Illustration: THE MAGIC MIRROR--\"LITTLE SNOW-WHITE\"]  In the morning Snow-White told them all her story; and they pitied her, and said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash, and knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would take good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work, seeking for gold and silver in the mountains; and Snow-White remained at home: and they warned her, and said, \"The queen will soon find out where you are, so take care and let no one in.\" But the queen, now that she thought Snow-White was dead, believed that she was certainly the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass, and the glass answered,        \"Thou, Queen, thou art fairest in all this land;       But over the hills, in the greenwood shade.       Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made.       There Snow-White is hiding her head; and she       Is lovelier far, O Queen, than thee.\"  Then the queen was very much alarmed; for she knew that the glass always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her. And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful than she was; so she disguised herself as a pedlar and went her way over the hills to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she knocked at the door, and cried, \"Fine wares to sell!\" Snow-White looked out of the window, and cried, \"Good-day, good woman; what have you to sell?\" \"Good wares, fine wares,\" said she; \"laces and bobbins of all colours.\" \"I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good sort of a body,\" thought Snow-White; so she ran down, and unbolted the door. \"Bless me!\" said the woman, \"how badly your stays are laced. Let me lace them up with one of my nice new laces.\" Snow-White did not dream of any mischief; so she stood up before the old woman; but she set to work so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snow-White lost her breath, and fell down as if she were dead. \"There's an end of all thy beauty,\" said the spiteful queen, and went away home.  [Illustration: \"'THERE'S AN END TO ALL THY BEAUTY' SAID THE SPITEFUL QUEEN, AND SHE WENT AWAY HOME.\"]  In the evening the seven dwarfs returned; and I need not say how grieved they were to see their faithful Snow-White stretched upon the ground motionless, as if she were quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when they found what was the matter, they cut the lace; and in a little time she began to breathe, and soon came to life again. Then they said,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15145"],["title","My Book of Favourite Fairy Tales (#2)"],["body"," \"The old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one in when we are away.\"  When the queen got home, she went to her glass, and spoke to it, but to her surprise it said the same words as before.  Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice to see that Snow-White still lived; and she dressed herself up again in a disguise, but very different from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb, When she reached the dwarf's cottage, she knocked at the door, and cried, \"Fine wares to sell!\" but Snow-White said, \"I dare not let anyone in.\" Then the queen begged, \"Only look at my beautiful combs;\" and gave her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty that she took it up and put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless.  \"There you may lie,\" said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs returned very early that evening; and when they saw Snow-White lying on the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb. And when they took it away, she recovered, and told them all that had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to anyone.  [Illustration]  Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and trembled with rage when she received exactly the same answer as before; and she said \"Snow-White shall die, if it costs me my life.\" So she went secretly into a chamber, and prepared a poisoned apple; the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but whosoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a peasant's wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs' cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snow-White put her head out of the window, and said, \"I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not to.\" \"Do as you please,\" said the old woman, \"but at any rate take this pretty apple; I will make you a present of it.\" \"No,\" said Snow-White, \"I dare not take it.\" \"You silly girl!\" answered the other, \"what are you afraid of? Do you think it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the other.\" Now the apple was so prepared that one side was good, though the other side was poisoned. Then Snow-White was very much tempted to taste, for the apple looked exceedingly nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she could refrain no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth, when she fell down dead upon the ground. \"This time nothing will save thee,\" said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it said,        \"Thou, Queen, art the fairest of all the fair.\"  And then her envious heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could be.  When evening came, and the dwarfs returned home, they found Snow-White lying on the ground; no breath passed her lips, and they were afraid that she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little girl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they proposed to bury her; but her cheeks were still rosy, and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said, \"We will never bury her in the cold ground.\" And they made a coffin of glass so that they might still look at her, and wrote her name upon it in golden letters, and that she was a king's daughter. And the coffin was placed upon the hill, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snow-White. First of all came an owl, and then a raven, but at last came a dove.  And thus Snow-White lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as though she were asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the dwarfs' house; and he saw Snow-White, and read what was written in gold letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and earnestly prayed them to let him take her away; but they said, \"We will not part with her for all the gold in the world.\" At last, however, they had pity on him, and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snow-White awoke, and said, \"Where am I?\" And the prince answered, \"Thou art safe with me.\" Then he told her all that had happened, and said, \"I love you better than all the world; come with me to my father's palace, and you shall be my wife.\" And Snow-White consented, and went home with the prince; and everything was prepared with great pomp and splendour for their wedding.  To the feast was invited, among the rest, Snow-White's old enemy, the queen; and as she was dressing herself in fine, rich clothes, she looked, in the glass, and the glass answered,        \"Thou, lady, art the loveliest _here_, I ween;       But lovelier far is the new-made queen.\"  When she heard this, she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And when she arrived, and saw that it was none other than Snow-White, who she thought had been dead a long while, she choked with passion, and fell ill and died; but Snow-White and the prince lived and reigned happily over that land many, many years.  [Illustration]      [Illustration]  CINDERELLA   The wife of a rich man fell sick: and when she felt that her end drew nigh, she called her only daughter to her bedside, and said, \"Always be a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.\" Soon afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always good and kind to all about her. And the snow spread a beautiful white covering over the grave: but by the time the sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This new wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her: they were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time for the poor little girl. \"What does the good-for-nothing thing want in the parlour?\" said they; \"they who would eat bread should first earn it; away with the kitchen maid!\" Then they took away her fine clothes, and gave her an old frock to put on, and laughed at her and turned her into the kitchen.  Then she was forced to do hard work; to rise early, before daylight, to bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that, the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways and laughed at her. In the evening, when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made to sleep by the hearth among the ashes; and then, as she was of course always dusty and dirty, they called her Cinderella.  It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his wife's daughters what he should bring them. \"Fine clothes,\" said the first: \"Pearls and diamonds,\" said the second. \"Now, child,\" said he to his own daughter, \"what will you have?\" \"The first sprig, dear father, that rubs against your hat on your way home,\" said she. Then he bought for the two first the fine clothes and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home as he rode through a green copse, a sprig of hazel brushed against him, and almost pushed off his hat; so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it and went to her mother's grave and planted it there, and cried so much that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three times every day she went to it and wept; and soon a little bird came and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her and watched over her, and brought her whatever she wished for.  Now it happened that the king of the land held a feast which was to last three days, and out of those who came to it his son was to choose a bride for himself; and Cinderella's two sisters were asked to come. So they called her up and said, \"Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king's feast.\" Then she did as she was told, but when all was done she could not help crying, for she thought to herself, she would have liked to go to the dance too; and at last she begged her mother very hard to let her go. \"You! Cinderella?\" said she; \"you who have nothing to wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to the ball?\" And when she kept on begging--to get rid of her, she said at last, \"I will throw this basinful of peas into the ash heap, and if you have picked them all out in two hours' time you shall go to the feast too.\" Then she threw the peas into the ashes; but the little maiden ran out at the back door into the garden, and cried out--        \"Hither, hither, through the sky.       Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!       Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,       Hither, hither, haste away!       One and all, come help me quick,       Haste ye, haste ye--pick, pick, pick!\"  [Illustration]  Then first came two white doves flying in at the kitchen window; and next came two turtle-doves; and after them all the little birds under heaven came chirping and fluttering in, and flew down into the ashes; and the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick; and picked out all the good grain and put it in a dish, and left the ashes. At the end of one hour the work was done, and all flew out again at the windows. Then Cinderella brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought that now she should go to the feast. But she said, \"No, no! Girl, you have no clothes and cannot dance, you shall not go.\" And when Cinderella begged very hard to go, she said, \"If you can in one hour's time pick two of these dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go too.\" And thus she thought she should at last get rid of her. So she shook"]]]
