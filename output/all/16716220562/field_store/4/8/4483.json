You are your father's eldest son,\" answered the woman, who, wrapped in perfect love and happiness, had never given a thought to the far-reaching effects of her marriage with the Arabian. \"Dear son, there are so many beautiful, cultured, gentle women here and at home--I mean in England--you------\"  \"Mother, please!  Oh, Mother, you don't understand--dear heavens! you don't understand.  Listen--and, how I wish my father, whom I honour, were here to comfort you.  Forgive me, dear, forgive me for the pain I must cause you------\"  And the woman went white to the lips under a sudden blinding flash of understanding and her proud eyes dropped to the hands clenched in her lap.  \"I want to marry, Mother of mine.\"  He spoke in the Arabian tongue, which, is so atune to love, \"for behold love in the space of an hour has grown within me.  The floods of love drown me, the full-blossomed trees of passion throw their shade upon the surging waters, and, behold, the shade is that of tenderness.  From the midst of the flood where I am like to drown, I stretch my arms towards the rocky shore where stands, looking towards me, the desire of my soul.  Behold, my eyes have seen her, and, behold, she is white, with hair like the desert at sunset, and eyes even as the pools of Lebanon.  She is as a rod to be bent, and as a vase of perfume to be broken upon a night of love.  And I love her--her--out of all women--a doe to be hunted at dawn, a mare to be spurred through the watches of the night------\"  \"Hugh!\"  \"I love her as my father loved you--my father, of whom I am the eldest son--son of a highborn father, son of a highborn mother--outcast--outcast!\"  \"For pity's sake, Hugh, stop!\"  But the storm swept on, tearing the veil from the woman's eyes.  \"Behold, I care not for the plucking of garden blossoms, therefore are the beautiful, docile women of the East not for me, and the thorns upon the hedge of convention defied, the barbed wires of racial distinction keep me from the hedgerow flower, born of the wind and the sky and the summer heat, which I covet.  \"Among men I am nothing; I may not claim equality with the scavenger of the Western streets; or with the donkey-boys of the Eastern bazaar. Here I am served with fear and servility, being a man of riches; across the waters, I may sun myself in the smiles of women as long as I have no desire to wed.\"  He suddenly seized the woman, holding her in a grip of iron which left great bruises on her arms.  \"Do you know what she called me, Mother?--that harlot of a line of noblemen--what she flung in my teeth because, seeing in her a woman of the streets hidden under the cloak of marriage, I refused to be tempted?\"  There fell a terrible silence, and then a few whispered words.  \"She called me a half-caste, Mother!--me--a half-caste!\"  And the mother fell at her son's feet and bowed her head to the ground, and he swept her up into his arms, raining kisses upon the piteous face.  \"I don't blame you, sweetheart-mother,\" he said in English, whilst she sobbed on his heart.  \"Am I not the fruit of a brave woman's great love?  Could there be anything finer than that?  But my father in me made my whole body clamour for the desert when I was in England; my mother in me makes my heart throb in the desert for just one hour of her cool, misty country, one hour on a hill-top in which to watch the pearl-gray dawn.  Dearest, dearest, don't sob so.  It is a case of two affirmatives making a negative; two great nationalities decried, derided, rendered null and void in their offspring through the dictates of those who, in religion, prate that we are all brothers.  I have just got to stick it, my mother, and life is not very long.  But I shall never marry.\"  And as he spoke, Fate flicked a page of an illustrated paper, which was but the volume of the Book of Life, and perhaps only a mother's eyes would have noticed the sudden tightening of the hand upon the marble of the balustrade as the man looked down into the pictured beauty of the woman he loved.  And, having read what had been written, he knelt to receive his mother's blessing.  \"To the Tents of Purple and Gold, my darling?\" she asked, smiling so bravely to hide her breaking heart.  \"Not just yet, dear; a bit further North first, I think.\"  \"For long?\"  \"I do not know, dear.  Bless me, O my mother.\"  She blessed him and called to him as he stood at the head of the marble stairway:  \"Come back to me, my son!\"  \"That, O woman, is in the hands of Allah, who is God.\"  And he turned and left her, and she, having wept her heart out and her beautiful eyes dim, took up the illustrated paper which was a volume of the Book of Life, and turned the pages.  \"Ah!\" she said.  \"How beautiful!\"  It was just a simple photograph of Damaris at a tennis tournament, and underneath the information that the most popular and beautiful visitor in Cairo would celebrate her birthday in a week's time, that in honour of the occasion her god-mother, the Duchess of Longacres, had issued invitations for a fancy-dress ball, after which social event she and her god-daughter would proceed to the Desert Palace Hotel, Heliopolis.  \"I wonder,\" whispered Jill, \"I wonder if she would come to see me.  She was always such a wise old woman.  I wonder if there is a way out\"--and she stretched her arms out towards the desert.  \"Hahmed!\" she called, \"Beloved, I love you, and my heart is breaking,\"--and she lifted her head and listened to the sound of many horses running; then bowed her head and wept.  The dawn was nigh to breaking, and yet the parade of horses was not finished; whilst the trainer, the head groom, the stud groom, the under-grooms and the rank and file of the stables tore their beards or their hair as they endeavoured to please their master, whilst they waited anxiously for the return of the man who had been hurriedly sent to fetch in the mare, Pi-Kay, who was out to grass, and as wild as a bird on the wing.  Singly, or in pairs, every priceless quadruped had been put through its paces upon the track of tan imported from England.  Three coal-black stallions, brothers to el-Sooltan, even then in Cairo, and famous throughout Egypt, tore past him like a cyclone and left him indifferent; a chestnut brood mare, whose price was above that of many rubies, trotted up at his call and snuffled a welcome in his sleeve, searched for sugar in his hand and found it, and whinnied gently when he turned away; bays, piebalds, roans, greys, trotted, galloped, jumped, whilst their master smoked endless cigarettes and the stud groom prayed fervently to Allah.  \"By the patience of the Prophet,\" the master suddenly cried, turning on the man, \"hast thou nothing else?  Is there no jewel amongst my horses? Hast thou not in all my stables one of the Al Hamsa, a descendant of the mares who found favour in the eyes of Mohammed the prophet of Allah who is God?  The mare Alia--has she been, perchance, as sterile as thy wits?\"  And then he stopped short and stood in silence, watching the loveliest picture any human could wish to see.  Picking up her dainty feet as though she walked upon hot stones, tossing her proud little head, with big, gentle eyes, spreading nostrils and fine small ears almost touching at the tips, mane flowing, tail set high and spread, came the snow-white mare, Pi-Kay.  Allah! but the loveliness of that picture as she stood, thoroughbred, perfect, as proud as any queen, as scornful as any spoiled beauty, as confused at the sight of her master as any bride!  Ten yards away and motionless she stood from this man who seemed to take no notice of her, and then she wheeled, and flung up her heels; then stopped and looked at him along her satin flank and piqued with his indifference suddenly sped out into the desert.  Then, softly, melodiously, the man's voice called her, ringing like a bell under the lightening sky, and behold, love awoke in the mare's heart and she turned and raced back towards him, longing for his hand and the grip of his knees upon her.  But with her feet upon the tan, she turned her back upon him and danced across towards the coal-black stallions, causing their grooms to hold on to them with both hands; then she came back to circle round about this man, who seemingly took no notice of her vagaries, not even when she reared just behind him, pawing the air, nor when she lashed out at a humble _sayis_, missing him by a hair; until, at last, overpowered by curiosity and love, curveting, rearing, throwing her feet and making a frightful to-do over nothing at all, she came close up--oh! very close--and whinnied gently.  With one hand clutching the silvery mane and in one bound he was across the bare back and away with her into the desert, gripping her with his knees, calling to her by every love-name he could think of.  And out there alone in the desert at the hour of prayer, he slipped from her and, turning towards Mecca, raised his hands to heaven.  \"O God of the West!  O Allah of the East!  Give me one single hour of love!\"  And the mare, Pi-Kay, wonderful in her beauty, raced from him far out into the desert, leaving him alone with his God; then stood quite still, with fine small ears pricked, waiting for the call she knew would come.  And when it came ringing clear over the golden sand, she raced back to him and pushed against him, until he sprang upon her and turned her towards the East.  \"_By the war-horses_,\" he cried, quoting from Al-Koran, \"_which run swiftly to battle, with a panting noise; and by those who strike fire by dashing their hoofs against the stones; and by those who make a sudden invasion on the enemy early in the morning and therein raise the dust, and therein pass through the midst of the adverse troops_ . . . . by the Message of the Great Book and by my love will I wrest one hour from life.\"  And urging the mare with the whip of love to the uttermost of her wonderful speed, he thundered back"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15721"],["title","The Hawk of Egypt (#8)"],["body","the path of sand, which was to be trodden by his feet alone, in spite of the plots which Zulannah the courtesan was even then weaving about him--to her own advancement.     CHAPTER VII    \"_. . . . and she painted her face, and tired her   head, and looked out at a window_.\"            II KINGS.   The house of the \"Scarlet Enchantress,\" with its balconies, turrets and outer and inner courts, stood quite by itself at one corner of the Square, in a big, neglected garden.  It had been built by means of untold gold and the destruction of scores of miserable, picturesque hovels, which, poor as they might be, had however meant home to many of the needy in the Arabian quarters of Cairo.  It would be useless to look for that building covered in white plaster now; it was, later, looted and burned to the ground.  A beautiful wanton of fourteen summers, ambitious, relentless, with the eyes of an innocent child, the morals of a jackal and a fair supply of brain-cunning rather than intellect, Zulannah sat this night of stars in a corner of her balcony overlooking the Square, smoking endless cigarettes.  Courtesan of the highest rank, she had plied her ruthless trade for three successful years, accumulating incredible wealth in jewels and hard cash.  Her ambition knew no bounds; her greed no limit; her jealousy of other women had become a by-word in the north.  Physically she was perfect; otherwise, she had not one saving grace, and her enemies were legion.  She had driven hard bargains, demanding the very rings off men's fingers in exchange for kisses; shutting the door with callous finality in the face of those she had beggared; she had disowned her mother, who, stricken with ophthalmia, begged in the streets; she had no mercy for man, woman or beast, yet all had gone well until love had come to her.  Love comes to harlots and to queens as well as to us ordinary women, and they suffer every whit as much as we do, perhaps more keenly on account of the hopeless positions they fill.  It had come to Zulannah, uncontrollably, that night when, unveiled, garbed in silks and satins and hung with jewels, she brazenly graced the stage-box at a gala performance.  She looked down, and Ben Kelham, in the end seat of the first row of stalls, looked up and looked and looked, seeing nothing, being blinded with love of Damaris.  Zulannah drove back in her Rolls-Royce to the edge of the Arabian quarter, where, owing to the narrowness of the lanes called by courtesy streets, she alighted to finish what remained of the journey in a litter swung from the shoulders of four Nubian slaves, and, arrived at the great house, summoned her special bodyguard, Qatim the Ethiopian; and for acquiring information down to the smallest detail about some special individual there is, surely, no detective agency on earth to compare to one ordinary, native servant.  He loves intrigue!  So that, twenty-four hours later, Zulannah laughed shrilly when Qatim the Ethiopian repeated all he had learned of the white man and the white maid he presumably loved.  \"Love!\" she scoffed.  \"He has not met _me_!\"  But in the weeks that followed no plot had succeeded, no device or subtle invitation had lured the bird to the list, so that she beat sharply upon a silver gong this night of the stars, upon which the Ethiopian came running hastily to cast himself upon the ground at the jewelled, henna'd feet.  \"Get up,\" she said, kicking him upon the side of the head; whereupon he rose, chalking up one more mark on his own particular slate of Life, upon one side of which was written Desire and the other Revenge.  He stood six-foot-four in his loin-cloth, as black and glistening as a polished ebony statue.  The enormous hands at the end of great, over-long arms almost touched his knees; the chest and shoulders and abdomen were hard as iron, rippling with muscle under the oiled skin; the feet were huge and pink of sole, and the animality of the man was intensified by a certain gleam of intelligence somewhere in the impassive negroid face.  The woman, took no notice of the magnificent physique; it neither repulsed nor attracted her--he was a slave.  \"Run and give orders that no one is admitted!  Hasten!\"  \"Mistress, a great noble waits at-----\"  \"Desirest thou thy tongue split, thou black dog, that thou answerest Zulannah?  Haste thee, and return!\"  And far into the night they talked, those two, planning death or destruction, anything as long as it attained the desire of the woman who, looking into the future, took no notice of the mountain of disaster beside her in the shape of the Ethiopian who desired and hated her with all the bestial passion of his race.  Then, just as far down in the east the sky lightened, she sat suddenly upright and clapped her jewelled hands.  \"Know'st thou the eunuch who guards the harem empty of women in the palace of--ah! the barbarity of the name!--E'u Car-r-den Ali?  He who perchance would give one-half, nay, all of his great wealth in return for the coal-blackness of thy odorous skin.  There is to be held a big entertainment within the walls of the white man's hotel, and soon.  An entertainment where the whites dance foolishly in foolish raiment, disguised as that which they are not and with covered faces.  What easier than for me to obtain entry as one of them under my veils and have speech with the man I love?  And if he is as thou sayest, besotted with love of this white girl, then will I use the man of barbarous name as a tool to bring about that which I desire.  Know'st thou the eunuch?\"  \"Mistress, he is my twin-brother.\"  \"Twin of _thee_!  Behold, did not thy mother die of fright, at sight of such monstrosities?\"  \"Nay, mistress, there are six sons younger than thy slave, each one of which could break thee in one hand.\"  Zulannah sprang to her feet and, seizing a short whip from a table, smote the man again and again until his face ran blood.  \"Thou vile brute, darest thou so to speak!  Behold, this is but a foretaste of what will befall thy black carcase before the hour is spent.\"  \"Call thy slaves, mistress; split my tongue; whip the soles from off my feet, the flesh from my body, even to the bones, and thou shalt never meet my twin-brother, who even now prepareth the great palace for the coming of the\"--he spat--\"bird of different-coloured plumage.\"  And Zulannah, understanding that she must not overstep the limit if she desired to attain her end, flung the whip full into the stolid, indifferent face, and fled, raving obscenities, into the house.     CHAPTER VIII    \"_If God in His wisdom have brought close   The day when I must die,   That day by water or fire or air   My feet shall fall in the destined snare   Wherever my road may lie_.\"            DANTE GABRIEL ROSETTI   \"May I come in?  Oh, Maris, what _do_ you think?  There is to be a real native fortune-teller in the Winter Garden.  They've made the corner near the fountain like an Arab's tent, and he'll tell us our horoscopes in the sand, and all sorts of things.\"  \"Not forgetting the stars, let us hope?\"  \"Oh, there's sure to be that.\"  Damaris laughed as she turned in her chair and looked at the excited little visitor in fancy-dress.  \"You _do_ look sweet.  A Light of the Harem, for certain.\"  \"Yes; and what do you think?  There are three dozen Lights.  Isn't it a shame?  I thought I should be the only one.  And there are two and a half dozen Sheikhs, and I don't know how many dozen Bedouins.  You are--what are you?  You look awfully--awfully--er--I don't quite know what.\"  Damaris adjusted the _selva_, the quaint silver kind of tube between the eyebrows which connects the yashmak and the _tarhah_ or head-veil, took a final look in the mirror, and rose.  \"I am an Egyptian woman of the humblest class.\"  She was all in black, as befits a member of that class.  The simple bodice, cut in a yoke, of the black muslin dress fitted her like a glove; the skirt fell in wide folds from the waist and swung about her ankles encircled by big brass rings, which clashed as she moved.  She wore the black yashmak and _tarhah_; upon her arms were many brass bracelets which tinkled; on one hand she wore a ring and there were flesh-coloured silken hose and sandals upon her feet.  She had made a mistake and henna'd her finger-tips, which members of the humblest class have not time to do--besides, their patient hands matter so little--and her great eyes looked as black as the yashmak over which they shone.  Her beautiful face was hidden, yet was she infinitely alluring, tantilising, mysterious, under her veils.  Heavens! if only women knew how easy it is to enhance the looks by the simple method of touching up the eyes with _kohl_ and covering the rest of the face!  \"All of us in veils and masks will have to take them off at one.\"  \"Yes, there'll be the rub,\" said Damaris, as she knelt down beside the perplexed, growling bulldog.  \"Don't know Missie?  Don't love her?\"  \"Woomph!\" replied Wellington, hurling his great weight into her lap.  \"How he loves you, Maris!\"  \"Yes, miss, he does,\" broke in Jane Coop.  \"And I firmly believe he's my mistress's guardian angel.\"  \"After you, Janie dear,\" said the girl, smiling fondly up at the plump maid and tying a huge crimson bow round the neck of the long-suffering animal.  \"What is he going as, Maris?\"  \"A gargle, miss,\" broke in the maid.  \"I think it's just fun on the part of Miss Damaris, because nothing as solid as him,\"--pointing of comb to shamed dog--\"could go as anything watery.\"  Damaris got to her feet.  \"Let's go in to _Marraine_,\" she choked.  \"Gargoyle, my dear,\" she whispered, \"is what she meant--gargoyle.  Do come along!\"  The girls' happy laughter rang down the corridor as they knocked at her grace's door.  She stood at her dressing-table in a beautiful dress of grey brocade. Diamonds sparkled in the laces of her corsage, on her fingers and in the buckles of her lovely shoes; a big bunch of pink carnations was tied on the top of her ebony stick; a "]]]
