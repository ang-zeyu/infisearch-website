Sometimes I get very lonely.\"  \"Ah! my dear,\" said Pratinas, smoothly, \"if I could do what I wished, I would never leave you. But business cannot wait. I must go and see the noble Lucius Calatinus on some very important political matters, which you could not understand. Now run away like a good girl, and don't become doleful.\"  Artemisia left the room, and Pratinas busied himself about the fine touches of his toilet. When he held the silver mirror up to his face, he remarked to himself that he was not an unhandsome man. \"If I did not have to play the philosopher, and wear this thick, hot beard,[28] I would not be ashamed to show my head anywhere.\" Then while he perfumed himself with oil of saffron out of a little onyx bottle, he went on:--    [28] At an age when respectable men were almost invariably smooth   shaven, the philosophers wore flowing beards, as a sort of professional   badge.  \"What dogs and gluttons these Romans are! They have no real taste for art, for beauty. They cannot even conduct a murder, save in a bungling way. They have to call in us Hellenes to help them. Ha! ha! this is the vengeance for Hellas, for the sack and razing of Corinth and all the other atrocities! Rome can conquer with the sword; but we Greeks, though conquered, can, unarmed, conquer Rome. How these Italians can waste their money! Villas, statues, pretty slaves, costly vases, and tables of mottled cypress,[29] oysters worth their weight in gold, and I know not what else! And I, poor Pratinas, the Greek, who lives in an upper floor of a Subura house at only two thousand sesterces rental, find in these noble Roman lords only so much plunder. Ha! ha! Hellas, thou art avenged!\"    [29] A \"fad\" of this time. Such tables often cost $20,000.  And gathering his mantle about him, he went down the several flights of very rickety stairs, and found himself in the buzzing street.   II  The Romans hugged a fond belief that houses shut out from sunlight and air were extremely healthy. If such were the fact, there should have been no sickness in a great part of the capital. The street in which Pratinas found himself was so dark, that he was fain to wait till his eyes accommodated themselves to the change. The street was no wider than an alley, yet packed with booths and hucksters,--sellers of boiled peas and hot sausage, and fifty other wares. On the worthy Hellene pressed, while rough German slaves or swarthy Africans jostled against him; the din of scholars declaiming in an adjoining school deafened him; a hundred unhappy odors made him wince. Then, as he fought his way, the streets grew a trifle wider; as he approached the Forum the shops became more pretentious; at last he reached his destination in the aristocratic quarter of the Palatine, and paused before a new and ostentatious mansion, in whose vestibule was swarming a great bevy of clients, all come in the official calling costume--a ponderous toga--to pay their respects to the great man. But as the inner door was pushed aside by the vigilant keeper, all the rest of the crowd were kept out till Pratinas could pass within.  The atrium of the house was a splendid sight, with its veined marble pillars, mosaic floor, bubbling fountain, choice frescoes, and expensive furniture upholstered in Tyrian purple. A little in the rear of this gorgeous room was seated in a high armchair the individual who boasted himself the lord of this establishment, Lucius Atilius Calatinus. He was a large, coarse man, with a rough, bull-dog face and straight red hair. He had been drinking heavily the night before, and his small bluish eyes had wide dark circles beneath them, and his breath showed strongly the garlic with which he had seasoned the bread and grapes of his early lunch. He was evidently very glad to see his Greek visitor, and drove the six large, heavily gemmed rings which he wore on one of his fat fingers, almost into the other's hand when he shook it.  \"Well met, Pratinas!\" was his salutation. \"Tell me, is that little affair of yours settled? Have you stopped the mouth of that beastly fellow, Postumus Pyrgensis, who said that I was a base upstart, with no claim to my gentile name, and a bad record as a tax farmer in Spain, and therefore should not be elected tribune[30]?\"    [30] The ten tribunes had power to convene the people and Senate,   propose laws and \"veto\" the actions of other magistrates.  \"I have stopped him,\" said Pratinas, with a little cough. \"But it was expensive. He stuck out for ten thousand sesterces.\"  \"Oh, cheaply off,\" said Calatinus, laughing. \"I will give you my cheque on Flaccus the banker. But I want to know about the other matter. Can you make sure of the votes of the Suburana tribe? Have you seen Autronius?\"  \"I have seen him,\" said Pratinas, dryly.  \"And he said?\"  \"Twenty thousand sesterces for him to deposit with trustees[31] until the election is over. Then he as go-between[32] will make sure of a majority of the tribesmen, and distribute to them the money if all goes well at the _comitia_.[33] It was the best bargain I could make; for Autronius really controls the tribe, and some one might outbid us.\"    [31] _Sequestres_.    [32] _Interpres_.    [33] Assembly of the Roman tribes for election.  \"All right,\" broke out Calatinus with a laugh, \"another cheque on Flaccus.\"  \"One thing else,\" said Pratinas; \"I must have a little money to shut up any complaints that those ridiculous anti-bribery Licinian and Pompeian Laws are being broken. Then there is my fee.\"  \"Oh, yes,\" replied the other, not to be daunted in his good humour, \"I'll give you fifty thousand in all. Now I must see this rabble.\"  And the mob of clients swept up to the armchair, grasping after the great man's hand, and raining on him their _aves_, while some daring mortals tried to thrust in a kiss.  Pratinas drew back and watched the crowd with a smile half cynical, half amused. Some of the visitors were regular hangers-on, who perhaps expected an invitation to dine; some were seekers of patronage; some had an eye to political preferment, a few were real acquaintances of Calatinus or came on some legitimate business. Pratinas observed three friends waiting to speak with Calatinus, and was soon in conversation.  The first of the trio was known as Publius Gabinius, who was by far the oldest. Coarse-featured, with broken complexion, it needed but a glance to proclaim him as gifted with no other distinctions than those of a hard drinker, fast liver, and the owner of an attenuated conscience. Servius Flaccus, the second, was of a different type. He was languid; spirited only when he railed at a slave who brushed against his immaculate toga. The frills on his robes made him almost feminine; and he spoke, even in invective, in a soft, lisping voice. Around him floated the aroma of countless rare unguents, that made his coming known afar off. His only aim in life was evidently to get through it with as little exertion of brain or muscle as was possible. The third friend was unlike the others. Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus clearly amounted to more than either of his companions. A constant worship of three very popular gods of the day--Women, Wine, and Gaming--with the other excitements of a dissipated life, had ruined a fine fair complexion. As it was, he had the profile of a handsome, affable man; only the mouth was hard and sensual, and his skin was faded and broken. He wore a little brown beard carefully trimmed around his well-oiled chin after the manner of Roman men of fashion; and his dark hair was crimped in regular steps or gradations, parting in the middle and arranged on both sides like a girl's.[34]    [34] Suet., \"Nero,\" 51.  \"Good morning, Pratinas!\" said Lucius, warmly, taking the Greek's hand. \"How glad we are to find you here. I wanted to ask you around to Marcus Læca's to-night; we think he will give something of a feast, and you must see my latest sweetheart--Clyte! She is a little pearl. I have had her head cut in intaglio on this onyx; is she not pretty?\"  \"Very pretty,\" said Pratinas, looking at the engraving on the ring. \"But perhaps it is not right for me, a grave philosopher, to go to your banquet.\"  \"How (h)absurd! (H)of c(h)ourse you c(h)an!\" lisped Flaccus, who affected Greek so far as to aspirate every word beginning with a vowel, and to change every _c_ into a _ch_.  \"Well,\" said Pratinas, laughing, for he was a dearly loved favourite of all these gilded youth, \"I will see! And now Gabinius is inviting Calatinus also, and we are dispersing for the morning.\"  \"Alas,\" groaned Ahenobarbus, \"I must go to the Forum to plead with that wretch Phormio, the broker, to arrange a new loan.\"  \"And I to the Forum, also,\" added Calatinus, coming up, \"to continue this pest of a canvass for votes.\"  The clients fell into line behind Calatinus like a file of soldiers, but before Pratinas could start away with the other friends, a slave-boy came running out from the inner house, to say that \"the Lady Valeria would be glad of his company in her boudoir.\" The Greek bowed his farewells, then followed the boy back through the court of the peristylium.[35]    [35] An inner private court back of the atrium.   III  The dressing room occupied by Valeria--once wife of Sextus Drusus and now living with Calatinus as her third husband in about four years--was fitted up with every luxury which money, and a taste which carried refinement to an extreme point, could accomplish. The walls were bright with splendid mythological scenes by really good artists; the furniture itself was plated with silver; the rugs were magnificent. The mistress of this palatial abode was sitting in a low easy-chair, holding before her a fairly large silver mirror. She wore a loose gown of silken texture, edged to an ostentatious extent with purple.

(#5)"],["body","hovered Arsinoë and Semiramis, two handsome Greek slave-girls, who were far better looking than their owner, inasmuch as their complexions had never been ruined by paints and ointments. They were expert hairdressers, and Valeria had paid twenty-five thousand sesterces for each of them, on the strength of their proficiency in that art, and because they were said to speak with a pure Attic Greek accent. At the moment they were busy stripping off from the lady's face a thick layer of dried enamel that had been put on the night before.  Had Valeria been willing, she might have feared no comparison with her maids; for from a merely sensuous standpoint, she would have been reckoned very beautiful. She had by nature large brown eyes, luxuriant brown hair, and what had been a clear brunette skin, and well-rounded and regular features. But her lips were curled in hard, haughty lines, her long eyelashes drooped as though she took little interest in life; and, worse than all, to satisfy the demands of fashion, she had bleached her hair to a German blonde, by a process ineffective and injurious. The lady was just fuming to herself over a gray hair Arsinoë had discovered, and Arsinoë went around in evident fear lest Valeria should vent her vexation on her innocent ministers.  Over in one corner of the room, on a low divan, was sitting a strange-looking personage. A gaunt, elderly man clothed in a very dingy Greek himation, with shaggy grey hair, and an enormous beard that tumbled far down his breast. This personage was Pisander, Valeria's \"house-philosopher,\" who was expected to be always at her elbow pouring into her ears a rain of learned lore. For this worthy lady (and two thousand years later would she not be attending lectures on Dante or Browning?) was devoted to philosophy, and loved to hear the Stoics[36] and Epicureans expound their varying systems of the cosmos. At this moment she was feasting her soul on Plato. Pisander was reading from the \"Phaidros,\" \"They might have seen beauty shining in brightness, when the happy band, following in the train of Zeus (as we philosophers did; or with the other gods, as others did), saw a vision, and were initiated into most blessed mysteries, which we celebrated in our state of innocence; and having no feeling of evils yet to come; beholding apparitions, innocent and simple and calm and happy as in a mystery; shining in pure light; pure ourselves, and not yet enchained in that living tomb which we carry about, now that we are imprisoned in the body ...\"    [36] The opponents of the Epicureans; they nobly antagonized the mere   pursuit of pleasure held out as the one end of life by the Epicurean,   and glorified duty.  \"Pratinas, to see her ladyship!\" bawled a servant-boy[37] at the doorway, very unceremoniously interrupting the good man and his learnedly sublime lore. And Pratinas, with the softest and sweetest of his Greek smiles, entered the room.    [37] _Cubicularius_.  \"Your ladyship does me the honour,\" he began, with an extremely deferential salutation.  \"Oh, my dear Pratinas,\" cried Valeria, in a language she called Greek, seizing his hand and almost embracing him, \"how delighted I am to see you! We haven't met since--since yesterday morning. I did so want to have a good talk with you about Plato's theory of the separate existence of ideas. But first I must ask you, have you heard whether the report is true that Terentia, Caius Glabrio's wife, has run off with a gladiator?\"  \"So Gabinius, I believe,\" replied Pratinas, \"just told me. And I heard something else. A great secret. You must not tell.\"  \"Oh! I am dying to know,\" smirked Valeria.  \"Well,\" said the Greek, confidentially, \"Publius Silanus has divorced his wife, Crispia. 'She went too much,' he says, 'with young Purpureo.'\"  \"You do not say so!\" exclaimed the lady. \"I always knew that would happen! Now tell me, don't you think this perfume of iris is delicate? It's in that little glass scent bottle; break the neck.[38] I shall use it in a minute. I have just had some bottles sent up from Capua. Roman perfumes are so vulgar!\"    [38] To let out the ointment. Capua was a famed emporium for perfumes   and like wares.  \"I fear,\" said Pratinas, doing as bidden, and testing the essence with evident satisfaction, \"that I have interrupted your philosophical studies.\" And he glanced at Pisander, who was sitting lonesome and offended in his corner.  \"Oh! not in the least,\" ran on Valeria; \"but though I know you are Epicurean, surely you enjoy Plato?\"  \"Certainly,\" said Pratinas, with dramatic dignity, \"I suck the sweets from the flowers left us by all the wise and good. Epicurean though I am, your ladyship must permit me to lend you a copy of an essay I have with me, by that great philosopher, the Stoic Chrysippos,[39] although I cannot agree with all his teachings; and this copy of Panaitios, the Eclectic's great _Treatise on Duty_, which cannot fail to edify your ladyship.\" And he held out the two rolls.    [39] Born 180 B.C.  \"A thousand thanks,\" said Valeria, languidly, \"hand them to Pisander. I will have him read them. A little more white lead, Arsinoë, I am too tanned; make me paler. Just run over the veins of my temples with a touch of blue paint. Now a tint of antimony on my eyelids.\"  \"Your ladyship seems in wonderfully good spirits this morning,\" insinuated Pratinas.  \"Yes,\" said Valeria, with a sigh, \"I endure the woes of life as should one who is consoled by philosophy.\"  \"Shall I continue the Plato?\" edged in poor Pisander, who was raging inwardly to think that Pratinas should dare to assume the name of a \"lover of learning.\"  \"When you are needed, I can tell you,\" snapped Valeria, sharply, at the feeble remonstrance. \"Now, Semiramis, you may arrange my hair.\"  The girl looked puzzled. To tell the truth, Valeria was speaking in a tongue that was a babel of Greek and Latin, although she fondly imagined it to be the former, and Semiramis could hardly understand her.  \"If your ladyship will speak in Latin,\" faltered the maid.  \"Speak in Latin! Speak in Latin!\" flared up Valeria. \"Am I deceived? Are you not Greeks? Are you some ignorant Italian wenches who can't speak anything but their native jargon? Bah! You've misplaced a curl. Take that!\" And she struck the girl across the palms, with the flat of her silver mirror. Semiramis shivered and flushed, but said nothing.  \"Do I not have a perfect Greek pronunciation?\" said the lady, turning to Pratinas. \"It is impossible to carry on a polite conversation in Latin.\"  \"I can assure your ladyship,\" said the Hellene, with still another bland smile, \"that your pronunciation is something exceedingly remarkable.\"  Valeria was pacified, and lay back submitting to her hairdressers[40], while Pratinas, who knew what kind of \"philosophy\" appealed most to his fair patroness, read with a delicate yet altogether admirable voice, a number of scraps of erotic verse that he said friends had just sent on from Alexandria.    [40] _Ornatrices_.  \"Oh! the shame to call himself a philosopher,\" groaned the neglected Pisander to himself. \"If I believed in the old gods, I would invoke the Furies upon him.\"  But Valeria was now in the best of spirits. \"By the two Goddesses,\"[41] she swore, \"what charming sentiments you Greeks can express. Now I think I look presentable, and can go around and see Papiria, and learn about that dreadful Silanus affair. Tell Agias to bring in the cinnamon ointment. I will try that for a change. It is in the murrhine[42] vase in the other room.\"    [41] Demeter and Persephone, a Greek woman's oath.    [42] A costly substance, probably porcelain agate.  Iasus the serving-boy stepped into the next apartment, and gave the order to one of his fellow slaves. A minute later there was a crash. Arsinoë, who was without, screamed, and Semiramis, who thrust her head out the door, drew it back with a look of dismay.  \"What has happened?\" cried Valeria, startled and angry.  Into the room came Arsinoë, Iasus, and a second slave-boy, a well-favoured, intelligent looking young Greek of about seventeen. His ruddy cheeks had turned very pale, as had those of Iasus.  \"What has happened?\" thundered Valeria, in a tone that showed that a sorry scene was impending.  The slaves fell on their knees; cowered, in fact, on the rugs at the lady's feet.  \"_A! A! A!_ Lady! Mercy!\" they all began in a breath. \"The murrhina vase! It is broken!\"  \"Who broke it?\" cried their mistress, casting lightning glances from one to another.  Now the truth had been, that while Agias was coming through a door covered with a curtain, carrying the vase, Iasus had carelessly blundered against him and caused the catastrophe. But there had been no other witnesses to the accident; and when Iasus saw that his mistress's anger would promptly descend on somebody, he had not the moral courage to take the consequences of his carelessness. What amounted to a frightful crime was committed in an instant.  \"Agias stumbled and dropped the vase,\" said Iasus, telling the truth, but not the whole truth.  \"Send for Alfidius the _lorarius_,\"[43] raged Valeria, who, with the promptness that characterizes a certain class of women, jumped at a conclusion and remained henceforth obstinate. \"This shall not happen again! Oh! my vase! my vase! I shall never get another one like it! It was one of the spoils of Mithridates, and\"--here her eye fell on Agias, cringing and protesting his innocence in a fearful agony.    [43] Whipper; many Roman houses had such a functionary, and he does   not seem to have lacked employment.  \"Stand up, boy! Stop whining! Of course you broke the vase. Who else had it? I will make you a lesson to all the slaves in my house. They need one badly. I will get another serving-boy who will be more careful.\"  Agias was deathly pale; the beads of sweat stood out on his forehead; he grasped convulsively at the hem of his mistress's robe, and murmured wildly of \"mercy! mercy!\" Pratinas stood back with his"]]]
