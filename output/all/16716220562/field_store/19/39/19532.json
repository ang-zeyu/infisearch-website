After which it happened, as I passed one day along a path which lay beside a stream of very clear water, that there came upon me a great desire to say somewhat in rhyme: but when I began thinking how I should say it, methought that to speak of her were unseemly, unless I spoke to other ladies in the second person; which is to say, not to _any_ other ladies, but only to such as are so called because they are gentle, let alone for mere womanhood. Whereupon I declare that my tongue spake as though by its own impulse, and said, “Ladies that have intelligence in love.” These words I laid up in my mind with great gladness, conceiving to take them as my commencement. Wherefore, having returned to the city I spake of, and considered thereof during certain days, I began a poem with this beginning, constructed in the mode which will be seen below in its division. The poem begins here:—      Ladies that have intelligence in love,       Of mine own lady I would speak with you;       Not that I hope to count her praises through,         But telling what I may, to ease my mind.     And I declare that when I speak thereof,     Love sheds such perfect sweetness over me     That if my courage failed not, certainly         To him my listeners must be all resign’d.         Wherefore I will not speak in such large kind     That mine own speech should foil me, which were base;     But only will discourse of her high grace         In these poor words, the best that I can find,     With you alone, dear dames and damozels:     ’Twere ill to speak thereof with any else.      An Angel, of his blessed knowledge, saith       To God: “Lord, in the world that Thou hast made,       A miracle in action is display’d,         By reason of a soul whose splendours fare     Even hither: and since Heaven requireth     Nought saving her, for her it prayeth Thee,     Thy Saints crying aloud continually.”         Yet Pity still defends our earthly share         In that sweet soul; God answering thus the prayer:     “My well-belovèd, suffer that in peace     Your hope remain, while so My pleasure is,         There where one dwells who dreads the loss of her:     And who in Hell unto the doomed shall say,     ‘I have looked on that for which God’s chosen pray.’”      My lady is desired in the high Heaven:       _Wherefore_, it now behoveth me to tell,       Saying: Let any maid that would be well         Esteemed keep with her: for as she goes by,     Into foul hearts a deathly chill is driven     By Love, that makes ill thought to perish there:     While any who endures to gaze on her         Must either be ennobled, or else die.         When one deserving to be raised so high     Is found, ’tis then her power attains its proof,     Making his heart strong for his soul’s behoof         With the full strength of meek humility.     Also this virtue owns she, by God’s will:     Who speaks with her can never come to ill.      Love saith concerning her: “How chanceth it       That flesh, which is of dust, should be thus pure?”       Then, gazing always, he makes oath: “Forsure,         This is a creature of God till now unknown.”     She hath that paleness of the pearl that’s fit     In a fair woman, so much and not more;     She is as high as Nature’s skill can soar;         Beauty is tried by her comparison.         Whatever her sweet eyes are turned upon,     Spirits of love do issue thence in flame,     Which through their eyes who then may look on them         Pierce to the heart’s deep chamber every one.     And in her smile Love’s image you may see;     Whence none can gaze upon her steadfastly.      Dear Song, I know thou wilt hold gentle speech       With many ladies, when I send thee forth:       Wherefore (being mindful that thou hadst thy birth         From Love, and art a modest, simple child),     Whomso thou meetest, say thou this to each:     “Give me good speed! To her I wend along     In whose much strength my weakness is made strong.”         And if, i’ the end, thou wouldst not be beguiled         Of all thy labour, seek not the defiled     And common sort; but rather choose to be     Where man and woman dwell in courtesy.         So to the road thou shalt be reconciled,     And find the lady, and with the lady, Love.     Commend thou me to each, as doth behove.  _This poem, that it may be better understood, I will divide more subtly than the others preceding; and therefore I will make three parts of it. The first part is a proem to the words following. The second is the matter treated of. The third is, as it were, a handmaid to the preceding words. The second begins here, “An Angel;” the third here, “Dear Song, I know.” The first part is divided into four. In the first, I say to whom I mean to speak of my lady, and wherefore I will so speak. In the second, I say what she appears to myself to be when I reflect upon her excellence, and what I would utter if I lost not courage. In the third, I say what it is I purpose to speak so as not to be impeded by faintheartedness. In the fourth, repeating to whom I purpose speaking, I tell the reason why I speak to them. The second begins here, “And I declare;” the third here, “Wherefore I will not speak;” the fourth here, “With you alone.” Then, when I say “An Angel,” I begin treating of this lady: and this part is divided into two. In the first, I tell what is understood of her in heaven. In the second, I tell what is understood of her on earth: here, “My lady is desired.” This second part is divided into two; for, in the first, I speak of her as regards the nobleness of her soul, relating some of her virtues proceeding from her soul; in the second, I speak of her as regards the nobleness of her body, narrating some of her beauties: here, “Love saith concerning her.” This second part is divided into two, for, in the first, I speak of certain beauties which belong to the whole person; in the second, I speak of certain beauties which belong to a distinct part of the person: here, “Whatever her sweet eyes.” This second part is divided into two; for, in the one, I speak of the eyes, which are the beginning of love; in the second, I speak of the mouth, which is the end of love. And that every vicious thought may be discarded herefrom, let the reader remember that it is above written that the greeting of this lady, which was an act of her mouth, was the goal of my desires, while I could receive it. Then, when I say, “Dear Song, I know,” I add a stanza as it were handmaid to the others, wherein I say what I desire from this my poem. And because this last part is easy to understand, I trouble not myself with more divisions. I say, indeed, that the further to open the meaning of this poem, more minute divisions ought to be used; but nevertheless he who is not of wit enough to understand it by these which have been already made is welcome to leave it alone; for certes, I fear I have communicated its sense to too many by these present divisions, if it so happened that many should hear it._  When this song was a little gone abroad, a certain one of my friends, hearing the same, was pleased to question me, that I should tell him what thing love is; it may be, conceiving from the words thus heard a hope of me beyond my desert. Wherefore I, thinking that after such discourse it were well to say somewhat of the nature of Love, and also in accordance with my friend’s desire, proposed to myself to write certain words in the which I should treat of this argument. And the sonnet that I then made is this:—      Love and the gentle heart are one same thing,       Even as the wise man[20] in his ditty saith:       Each, of itself, would be such life in death     As rational soul bereft of reasoning.     ’Tis Nature makes them when she loves: a king       Love is, whose palace where he sojourneth       Is called the Heart; there draws he quiet breath     At first, with brief or longer slumbering.     Then beauty seen in virtuous womankind       Will make the eyes desire, and through the heart         Send the desiring of the eyes again;     Where often it abides so long enshrin’d       That Love at length out of his sleep will start.         And women feel the same for worthy men.    [20] Guido Guinicelli, in the canzone which begins, “Within the        gentle heart Love shelters him.”  _This sonnet is divided into two parts. In the first, I speak of him according to his power. In the second, I speak of him according as his power translates itself into act. The second part begins here, “Then beauty seen.” The first is divided into two. In the first, I say in what subject this power exists. In the second, I say how this subject and this power are produced together, and how the one regards the other, as form does matter. The second begins here, “’Tis Nature.” Afterwards when I say, “Then beauty seen in virtuous womankind,” I say how this power translates itself into act; and, first, how it so translates itself in a man, then how it so translates itself in a woman: here, “And women feel.”_  Having treated of love in the foregoing, it appeared to me that I should also say something in praise of my lady, wherein it might be set forth how love manifested itself when produced by her; and how not only she could awaken it where it slept, but where it was not she could marvellously create it. To the which end I wrote another sonnet; and it is this:—      My lady carries love within her eyes;       All that she looks on is made pleasanter;       Upon her path men turn to gaze at her;     He whom she greeteth feels his heart to rise,     And droops his troubled visage, full of sighs,       And of his evil heart is then aware:       Hate loves, and pride becomes a worshipper.     O women, help to praise her in somewise.     Humbleness, and the hope that hopeth well,       By speech of hers into the mind are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41085"],["title","The New Life (La Vita Nuova) (#7)"],["body","ght,         And who beholds is blessèd oftenwhiles.         The look she hath when she a little smiles       Cannot be said, nor holden in the thought;     ’Tis such a new and gracious miracle.  _This sonnet has three sections. In the first, I say how this lady brings this power into action by those most noble features, her eyes; and, in the third, I say this same as to that most noble feature, her mouth. And between these two sections is a little section, which asks, as it were, help for the previous section and the subsequent; and it begins here, “O women, help.” The third begins here, “Humbleness.” The first is divided into three; for, in the first, I say how she with power makes noble that which she looks upon; and this is as much as to say that she brings Love, in power, thither where he is not. In the second, I say how she brings Love, in act, into the hearts of all those whom she sees. In the third, I tell what she afterwards, with virtue, operates upon their hearts. The second begins, “Upon her path;” the third, “He whom she greeteth.” Then, when I say, “O women, help,” I intimate to whom it is my intention to speak, calling on women to help me to honour her. Then, when I say, “Humbleness,” I say that same which is said in the first part, regarding two acts of her mouth, one whereof is her most sweet speech, and the other her marvellous smile. Only, I say not of this last how it operates upon the hearts of others, because memory cannot retain this smile, nor its operation._  Not many days after this (it being the will of the most High God, who also from Himself put not away death), the father of wonderful Beatrice, going out of this life, passed certainly into glory. Thereby it happened, as of very sooth it might not be otherwise, that this lady was made full of the bitterness of grief: seeing that such a parting is very grievous unto those friends who are left, and that no other friendship is like to that between a good parent and a good child; and furthermore considering that this lady was good in the supreme degree, and her father (as by many it hath been truly averred) of exceeding goodness. And because it is the usage of that city that men meet with men in such a grief, and women with women, certain ladies of her companionship gathered themselves unto Beatrice, where she kept alone in her weeping: and as they passed in and out, I could hear them speak concerning her, how she wept. At length two of them went by me, who said: “Certainly she grieveth in such sort that one might die for pity, beholding her.” Then, feeling the tears upon my face, I put up my hands to hide them: and had it not been that I hoped to hear more concerning her (seeing that where I sat, her friends passed continually in and out), I should assuredly have gone thence to be alone, when I felt the tears come. But as I still sat in that place, certain ladies again passed near me, who were saying among themselves: “Which of us shall be joyful any more, who have listened to this lady in her piteous sorrow?” And there were others who said as they went by me: “He that sitteth here could not weep more if he had beheld her as we have beheld her;” and again: “He is so altered that he seemeth not as himself.” And still as the ladies passed to and fro, I could hear them speak after this fashion of her and of me.  Wherefore afterwards, having considered and perceiving that there was herein matter for poesy, I resolved that I would write certain rhymes in the which should be contained all that those ladies had said. And because I would willingly have spoken to them if it had not been for discreetness, I made in my rhymes as though I had spoken and they had answered me. And thereof I wrote two sonnets; in the first of which I addressed them as I would fain have done; and in the second related their answer, using the speech that I had heard from them, as though it had been spoken unto myself. And the sonnets are these:—   I.      You that thus wear a modest countenance       With lids weigh’d down by the heart’s heaviness,       Whence come you, that among you every face     Appears the same, for its pale troubled glance?     Have you beheld my lady’s face, perchance,       Bow’d with the grief that Love makes full of grace?       Say now, “This thing is thus;” as my heart says,     Marking your grave and sorrowful advance.     And if indeed you come from where she sighs       And mourns, may it please you (for his heart’s relief)         To tell how it fares with her unto him     Who knows that you have wept, seeing your eyes,       And is so grieved with looking on your grief         That his heart trembles and his sight grows dim.  _This sonnet is divided into two parts. In the first, I call and ask these ladies whether they come from her, telling them that I think they do, because they return the nobler. In the second, I pray them to tell me of her; and the second begins here, “And if indeed.”_   II.      Canst thou indeed be he that still would sing       Of our dear lady unto none but us?       For though thy voice confirms that it is thus,     Thy visage might another witness bring.     And wherefore is thy grief so sore a thing       That grieving thou mak’st others dolorous?       Hast thou too seen her weep, that thou from us     Canst not conceal thine inward sorrowing?     Nay, leave our woe to us: let us alone:       ’Twere sin if one should strive to soothe our woe,         For in her weeping we have heard her speak:     Also her look’s so full of her heart’s moan       That they who should behold her, looking so,         Must fall aswoon, feeling all life grow weak.  _This sonnet has four parts, as the ladies in whose person I reply had four forms of answer. And, because these are sufficiently shown above, I stay not to explain the purport of the parts, and therefore I only discriminate them. The second begins here, “And wherefore is thy grief;” the third here, “Nay, leave our woe;” the fourth, “Also her look.”_  A few days after this, my body became afflicted with a painful infirmity, whereby I suffered bitter anguish for many days, which at last brought me unto such weakness that I could no longer move. And I remember that on the ninth day, being overcome with intolerable pain, a thought came into my mind concerning my lady: but when it had a little nourished this thought, my mind returned to its brooding over mine enfeebled body. And then perceiving how frail a thing life is, even though health keep with it, the matter seemed to me so pitiful that I could not choose but weep; and weeping I said within myself: “Certainly it must some time come to pass that the very gentle Beatrice will die.” Then, feeling bewildered, I closed mine eyes; and my brain began to be in travail as the brain of one frantic, and to have such imaginations as here follow.  And at the first, it seemed to me that I saw certain faces of women with their hair loosened, which called out to me, “Thou shalt surely die;” after the which, other terrible and unknown appearances said unto me, “Thou art dead.” At length, as my phantasy held on in its wanderings, I came to be I knew not where, and to behold a throng of dishevelled ladies wonderfully sad, who kept going hither and thither weeping. Then the sun went out, so that the stars showed themselves, and they were of such a colour that I knew they must be weeping: and it seemed to me that the birds fell dead out of the sky, and that there were great earthquakes. With that, while I wondered in my trance, and was filled with a grievous fear, I conceived that a certain friend came unto me and said: “Hast thou not heard? She that was thine excellent lady hath been taken out of life.” Then I began to weep very piteously; and not only in mine imagination, but with mine eyes, which were wet with tears. And I seemed to look towards Heaven, and to behold a multitude of angels who were returning upwards, having before them an exceedingly white cloud: and these angels were singing together gloriously, and the words of their song were these: “_Osanna in excelsis_;” and there was no more that I heard. Then my heart that was so full of love said unto me: “It is true that our lady lieth dead;” and it seemed to me that I went to look upon the body wherein that blessed and most noble spirit had had its abiding-place. And so strong was this idle imagining, that it made me to behold my lady in death; whose head certain ladies seemed to be covering with a white veil; and who was so humble of her aspect that it was as though she had said, “I have attained to look on the beginning of peace.” And therewithal I came unto such humility by the sight of her, that I cried out upon Death, saying: “Now come unto me, and be not bitter against me any longer: surely, there where thou hast been, thou hast learned gentleness. Wherefore come now unto me who do greatly desire thee: seest thou not that I wear thy colour already?” And when I had seen all those offices performed that are fitting to be done unto the dead, it seemed to me that I went back unto mine own chamber, and looked up towards Heaven. And so strong was my phantasy, that I wept again in very truth, and said with my true voice: “O excellent soul! how blessed is he that now looketh upon thee!”  And as I said these words, with a painful anguish of sobbing and another prayer unto Death, a young and gentle lady, who had been standing beside me where I lay, conceiving that I wept and cried out because of the pain of mine infirmity, was taken with trembling and began to shed tears. Whereby other ladies, who were about the room, becoming aware of my discomfort by reason of the moan that she made, (who indeed was of my very near kindred,) led her away from where I was, and then set themselves to awaken me, thinking that I dreamed, and saying: “Sleep no longer, and be not disquieted.”  Then, by their words, this strong imagination was brought suddenly to an end, at the moment that I was"]]]
