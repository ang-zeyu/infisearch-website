He still wasn't satisfied, but he was too bored and too lazy to exert any further effort. He stared gloomily at the torrents of rain slashing against the windows of the Officers' Club lounge, at the San Diego Naval Air Base, and sighed heavily.  \"I fancy I'll never learn not to believe a word you say, not ever!\" he groaned.  Hunched down in the next chair, Dave Dawson marked with his finger tip the place where he had stopped reading, and turned his head.  \"Speaking to me, little man?\" he murmured.  \"Only because you happen to be the only one present,\" young Farmer snapped. Then, with a wave toward the rain-swept window panes, he said, \"I was remarking that I should know better than ever to believe a word you say. Beautiful California? Good grief! Just look at it!\"  \"Look at what?\" Dawson chuckled. \"That slight dew that's falling? Think nothing of it. Good for the crops.\"  \"Dew, he says!\" Freddy snorted. And then as a vivid flash of lightning blinded them both for a split second, to be followed by a bellow of thunder that seemed to lift the whole building right up off its foundations, he added quickly, \"And that, I suppose, was just some chap out there striking a match?\"  \"Could be,\" Dawson laughed. \"California's full of things you'd never believe unless you saw them. But don't toss the weather at me, pal. I'm not a native of this state, so you can't get a rise out of me. Anyway, what the heck are you crabbing about? No good weather, no flying. And that gives us a chance to catch up on something or other. Now, take this book I'm reading. I ...\"  \"You take it, and keep it!\" Freddy Farmer growled. \"You know, Dave, you amaze me at times. Blessed if you're not as unpredictable as one of Hitler's speeches. Really.\"  \"Yeah?\" Dawson grinned at him. \"How come? Add a few more words to that, will you?\"  \"With pleasure!\" young Farmer snapped. \"Some two or three weeks ago, when we were included in a bunch of pilots and such to be sent from England to America to help train Army and Navy pilots, you just about hit the roof. Why, you were fit to go down to American Air Forces H. Q. in London and tear the blasted place apart. You train fledglings to fly? Never, you declared! You belly-ached night and day. Why, when we arrived here and you learned that we'd been assigned to Naval Aviation, you went completely off the deep end. You were an Army flier, a fighter pilot, and all that sort of rot. And now, suddenly, you're as content as a bug in a rug. Blessed if I get it, Dave? Or did the commandant of the base here overhear a few of your remarks, and call you up before him for a blistering?\"  \"Nope, not that,\" Dawson said with a chuckle. \"That I have calmed down, and am relaxed, is simply the result of another one of my sterling qualities that you have overlooked. I mean, the ability to adjust myself to existing circumstances.\"  \"Oh, quite!\" Freddy Farmer jeered at him. \"Particularly when you know blasted well that you can't do a thing about them!\"  \"Well, maybe you've got something there, pal,\" Dawson murmured, and stared at the rain-swept windows. \"When I'm posted to some job I don't go for at all, I sound off just as a matter of habit. I really don't kid myself that my objections are going to change anything. You and I have been in this cockeyed war too long to think that everything is all cut and dried. It isn't. And it never will be. In war anything can happen, and you can bet your last dime that it will, eventually. So I just get the steam off my chest, then say, oh, what the heck, and let it go like that.\"  \"I see what you mean,\" young Farmer grunted. \"And I'll admit that I feel much the same way. Only I keep my thoughts to myself. Commanding officers have big ears, you know. And it would just be the Farmer luck to have my words reach one of those big ears. But this blasted rain!\"  \"A buck says that there won't be a cloud in the sky at the end of a couple of hours,\" Dawson said. \"California's like that. But now that we're letting down our hair, I gather that you're not so hot for this instructing job, either, huh?\"  \"Definitely not!\" Freddy groaned. Then he added quickly, \"Not that I don't think these Navy chaps are top-hole, and all that. A very keen bunch of beggars, and they'll make good pilots, all of them. And you and I have flown enough with the Navy in the past to like it as much as flying with the Army. It's not that, either. It's ... well, frankly, it's because I'm so blasted selfish, I'm afraid.\"  \"Yes, you sure are, when it comes to snagging the odd piece of pie,\" Dawson said with a grin. \"That, though, is the fault of that bottomless stomach of yours, and you can't help yourself. Just what do you mean by that last remark?\"  \"Just what I said, that I'm selfish,\" young Farmer replied. \"Let some other chap have this instructing grind. I want to be on one of the fronts where there's action, and lots of it.\"  \"Freddy, the old fire eater,\" Dawson chuckled. \"But you've also got something there, too. So would I, and how! However ...\"  He let the rest slide and emphasized it with a shrug. Freddy Farmer frowned at him in a puzzled manner.  \"See?\" he eventually cried. \"That's what I mean. The way you are now. Completely licked, you seem like. Blessed if it's like you, Dave. Have you gone sour on something?\"  \"Heck, no!\" Dawson cried, and sat up straight. \"And don't get any dopey ideas that I feel licked about anything. I'm just biding my time, that's all. I mean, that something's bound to pop. It always has. It's just that I'm finally getting around to realizing that you can't push things along. You've just got to keep your shirt on when things get slow, and realize that there'll be plenty of fireworks sooner or later.\"  \"Well, well, the chap must be growing up, after all,\" Freddy Farmer murmured. Then, before Dawson could open his mouth to make a retort, he said, \"There must have been at least a hundred of us that came back to the States by Army Air Transport planes, wouldn't you say?\"  \"Yeah, more or less,\" Dawson grunted with a nod. \"So what?\"  \"So what?\" young Farmer echoed sharply. \"So why?\"  \"Ye gods, right back where we started!\" Dawson groaned. \"The old rotation idea, that's why. A bit of front line service, and then a bit of back home service, passing out your knowledge to those who have yet to see action. For Pete's sake, Freddy! What's so mysterious about that? Maybe it is a bit odd that we were stationed at a Naval Aviation base. However, perhaps the idea is to get Army and Navy pilots to know one another better. Too much rivalry between services is just as bad as none at all, you know.\"  \"Well, I do, now that you've explained, sir!\" Freddy barked at him. \"But you still haven't answered my question. I mean, with the invasion of Hitler's Europe bound to pop any day now, why in the world send a hundred or more seasoned pilots _away_ from England? Answer me that.\"  The corners of Dawson's mouth twitched in a grin, but Freddy didn't see it.  \"I don't know that I've a right to tell you, Freddy,\" he finally said, and tugged at his chin with a thumb and forefinger.  \"A right to tell me what?\" young Farmer demanded. \"Come off it, Dave! Stop being so blasted mysterious. You and I've always shared everything, haven't we?\"  \"Everything, except food,\" Dawson ribbed him. \"You never were anybody's pal when you had the feed bag on. But I guess it's all right to tell you. It's because of what General Eisenhower said.\"  \"To who?\" Freddy asked.  \"To whom, is what you mean, little man,\" Dawson said with a straight face. \"What he said to _me_ when he called me down to London High Command H.Q.\"  Freddy Farmer opened his mouth to speak, but a wrathful snort came out of it instead.  \"I might have known!\" he growled. \"General Eisenhower call you to his headquarters? Rot! Pure rot!\"  \"Okay, then, have it your way,\" Dawson sighed, and returned his attention to his book.  Freddy glared at him for a few seconds, then gave a little resigned shake of his head, and took a deep breath.  \"Very well,\" he said, \"I might as well let you get it all off your chest. And what did General Eisenhower say to you, my good man?\"  \"For two cents I wouldn't tell you!\" Dawson grunted. \"But I don't really need the money, so I will. The general told me that we were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41753"],["title","Dave Dawson at Truk (#1)"],["body","being sent back here for a home stay because the invasion of Hitler's Europe is _not_ bound to pop 'most any day, as you have just so glibly remarked.\"  \"Really, Dave?\" Freddy Farmer gasped. \"Honest? You mean...? Oh, blast you, stop pulling my leg! I know perfectly well that General Eisenhower didn't say a word to you. You didn't even see him!\"  Dawson grinned, and opened his mouth. But he closed it when he saw the look on young Farmer's face. Instead, he shook his head gravely.  \"No, Freddy,\" he said. \"The general didn't say a thing to me. It's dollars to doughnuts that he doesn't even know I exist. But I put it that way so's you'd catch on.\"  \"Catch on to what?\" Freddy wanted to know.  Dawson threw up his hands in exasperation.  \"Sweet tripe, Freddy!\" he cried. \"It's past noon! Aren't you awake yet? It's obvious, pal, isn't it? Obvious that the invasion isn't going to pop right away. The High Command is marking time while the bomber boys give Germany a good going-over. So the experienced pilots that aren't needed in England have been sent back here to help with the training program. Don't worry, when the big show starts we'll be yanked back there, but fast. _That's_ why I'm not tearing out my hair because I've been stuck on this instructing job. Because I know that when it's time for the balloon to go up I'll be sent there. And so will you. And so will all the others that flew back from England with us. Now do I make sense to you?\"  Freddy Farmer nodded, but he didn't say anything for a moment.  \"Yes, you're quite right, I fancy,\" he murmured presently. \"I must be slipping way off the beam not to have figured that out for myself. But I wonder how long?\"  \"When the Allied High Command is darned good and ready, and not a minute before,\" Dawson replied. \"Meanwhile we stick here ... and like it!\"  \"Maybe you can like it, but I don't,\" young Farmer growled, and glared at the window glass. \"This blasted rain!\"  Dave snapped his book closed, and tossed it on a nearby table.  \"Check!\" he grunted. \"It seems to be letting up a little, though, so let's do something about it. A little of it may do us some good. Let's take a walk out by those orange groves. They looked pretty interesting from the air. How about it, huh?\"  \"Right-o,\" Freddy Farmer sighed, and got to his feet. \"Anything's better than just sitting here listening to it!\"     CHAPTER TWO  _Strange Business_   With an angry gesture Freddy Farmer changed his rain slicker to his other arm, and pushed his service cap to the back of his head.  \"Blast it, I'm going to rest!\" he cried, and instantly pulled up to a halt. \"You said a walk, Dave, not a cross-country hike to the Atlantic coast. You know how far we've come?\"  Dawson slowed down and turned around with a grin.  \"Who cares how far?\" he said. \"This is swell. The trouble with you is, you're falling apart from old age. But okay, if you have to rest. Some view, huh? Californians sure have a right to brag, don't they?\"  \"If they like,\" Freddy muttered, and sank down on a convenient tree stump by the side of the path. \"But it's not my old age, I'll have you know. It's these blasted new shoes. Only wore them once before. I certainly wouldn't have worn them if I'd thought you were coming this far. It's all of five miles, if it's an inch.\"  \"Just the right distance for a nice work-out,\" Dawson said with a heartless grin, as he sank down beside Freddy. \"But get those gunboats off and let's see if you've got any blisters. And speaking of blisters from new shoes, I once knew a guy who got a blister, and two days later, guess what?\"  \"What?\" Freddy Farmer grunted, and began unlacing his shoes. \"What about two days later?\"  \"He died, just like that,\" Dawson grinned, and snapped his fingers. \"He was a swell guy, too. And it was just a little tiny blister. Didn't seem like anything at all. Let's have a look, kid. Maybe you got a _big_ blister.\"  \"You'll have something big, too, and on the side of your head, if you don't shut up!\" Freddy growled, and held up one of his shoes by the toe. \"One thing I always admired about you, young fellow, you do cheer up a chap so!\"  \"Always aim to please,\" Dawson chuckled, and leaned back on his elbows. \"See that hill over there? How far, would you say?\"  \"I'm not saying, because I don't care a penny's worth!\" young Farmer snapped, and peeled off his socks.  \"About three miles, I guess,\" Dawson murmured. \"I think we can make it there and back to the base by dark. We'd get a swell view of the sunset from the top of that hill.\"  \"You would, if you're fool enough to go there!\" Freddy Farmer cried. \"But not me, because I'm heading back to the base just as soon as I've had me a little rest!\"  \"Aw, don't be a sissy!\" Dawson chided. \"Come on. It will do you good. Really break in those new shoes of yours. I was kidding about it being three miles. It can't be more than a mile. We'll get a swell view of Dago and Coronado, Freddy. Come on; be a good guy!\"  When there was no comment from his flying mate and dearest pal, Dawson turned his head and opened his mouth to speak again. But no words came from between his lips, and that was because of the scowling, puzzled look on Freddy's face. He was sitting up straight, holding a sock in each hand, and staring intently at the crown of a low hill a short distance in back of where they sat.  \"What are you looking at?\" Dawson demanded, and twisted all the way around.  \"That little cluster of shacks up there,\" Freddy replied. \"I just saw a couple of chaps sneaking along by them. They looked a bit strange to me. I think one of them was in uniform.\"  \"So what?\" Dave grunted as he eyed the group of weather-beaten shacks. \"That's where the pickers live, I guess. For the orange groves, I mean. They're migratory pickers. They don't stay in one place all year round. Only for the picking season. Then they move, families and all, to some other section where a fruit crop has come in. That must be some life, I don't think. I wouldn't ... I see them, now, pal. And one is in uniform. And--hey! They're looking around as though they wanted to make sure nobody was watching them. Crouch down, Freddy. They won't be able to see us for those bushes there. I wonder what their act is all about anyway?\"  \"Well, it certainly looks suspicious from here,\" Freddy Farmer grunted as he hugged the ground closer with Dawson. \"And ... I say, Dave, you see that?\"  \"See what?\" Dawson demanded.  \"The one in civilian clothes, if you could call them that!\" the English-born air ace said breathlessly. \"His right hand! He's got a gun in it. Watch, and you'll see the sun on it as he turns.\"  Dawson didn't make any reply. He hugged the ground and peered past a clump of bushes at the two figures standing on the crown of the low hill no more than a couple of hundred yards away. One was very definitely garbed in uniform, but because of the position of the sinking sun, and the rays of light it cast off, it was impossible to tell what kind of a uniform at the distance. Then the other, the one obviously garbed in civilian clothes, turned slightly and the sunlight danced off a gun he held in his right hand. Dave gasped audibly, but it was not caused by sight of the sun on the gun. Rather, it was because of the figure's movements with the gun.  \"Cat's sake, Freddy!\" he grunted. \"The guy is waving that soldier inside that shack with his gun. See? There they go in, both of them. What the heck do you suppose, pal?\"  \"Blessed if I know,\" Freddy breathed back. \"Certainly looks deucedly queer, though. Do you fancy that soldier chap is being held up, or is in trouble?\"  \"I wouldn't know,\" Dawson grunted with a frown. \"Maybe we should find out. But he didn't seem to act as though he were putting up any objections. I had the feeling there that he sort of smiled.\"  \"Me, too,\" Freddy replied with a nod. \"I was wondering if you had seen it, or if it was just my imagination. Oh, it probably means nothing at all. We're just the suspicious type, I guess.\"  Dawson stared at the crown of the hill for a moment, and then lowered his gaze to the ground right in front of him, deep in thought.  \"What are you thinking about. Dave?\" young Farmer presently asked.  \"The one thing that doesn't seem to make sense,\" Dawson murmured after another moment or two of silence. \"That gun ... and it certainly was a gun, wouldn't you say?\"  \"Definitely,\" Freddy assured him. \"Looked like a long-barreled automatic to me. But it was definitely a gun of some sort. Well, what about it?\"  \"What's a civilian doing with a gun?\" Dawson asked. \"Particularly in these parts. This is a military zone, Freddy.\"  \"Perhaps it's the soldier's, and he let him look at it,\" young Farmer offered.  Dawson just shrugged at that, and said nothing. He raised his eyes and stared at the shack into which the two figures had disappeared, and then presently he turned and looked questioningly at Freddy Farmer.  \"Well?\" he said.  \"Well, what?\" the English-born air ace replied innocently.  \"You know exactly what I mean!\" Dawson snapped. \"Do we take a look to make sure, or do we just skip the whole thing, and start back to the base?\"  \"What do you think?\" Freddy instantly countered with a question of his own. \"Shall we, or shan't we?\"  Dawson hesitated a moment, and then pointed at Freddy's shoes and socks.  \"Put them on,\" he said. \"Maybe it'll just be a horse-laugh on us, but maybe it isn't as it should be. It isn't picking season around here yet, and by rights I don't think there should be anybody living in those shacks. I ... Oh, heck! Call me a curious cuss if you want to, but things like this get my curiosity clicking. I have to find out one way or the other.\"  \"As though I hadn't known you long enough to realize that!\" Freddy Farmer grunted, and began putting on his socks and shoes. \"But for once I'm with you. It's aroused my curiosity, too. How do we operate? Walk right up there, or steal from bush to bush, your American Indian style?\"  \"Neither!\" Dawson snapped, and"]]]
