PLYMOUTH TO THE FALKLANDS  Of the countless stories of naval action which I have listened to in the course of the months I have spent with the Grand Fleet, I cannot recall a single one which was told as the consequence of being asked for with malice aforethought. I have never yet found a man of action who was enamoured of the sound of his own voice raised in the recital of his own exploits, and if there is one thing more than another calculated to throw an otherwise not untalkative British Naval Officer into a state of uncommunicativeness, in comparison with which the traditional silence of the sphinx or the proverbial close-mouthedness of the clam are alike sheer garrulity, it is to ask him, point blank, to tell you (for instance) how he took his submarine into the Baltic, or what his destroyer did at Jutland, or how he fought his cruiser at Dogger Bank, or something similar.  The quiet-voiced but always interesting and often dramatic recitals of such things as these which I have heard have invariably been led up to quite incidentally--at dinner, on the bridge or quarter-deck, around the wardroom fire, or through something else that has just been told. Several times I have found in officers' diaries--little records never meant for other eyes than those of the writers' own friends or families--which have been turned over to me to verify some point regarding which I had inquired, laconic references to incidents and events of great human and even historic interest, and one of the most amusing and dramatic yarns I have ever listened to was told me in a \"kite\" balloon--plunging in the forty-mile wind against which it was being towed like a hooked salmon--by a man who had assured me before we went up that nothing really exciting had ever fallen to his experience.  It was in this way--an anecdote now and then as this or that incident of the day recalled it to his mind--that Captain ---- came to tell me the story of the _Cornwall_ during those eventful early months of the war when he commanded that now famous cruiser. He mentioned her first, I believe, one night in his cabin when, referring to a stormy midwinter month, most of which had been spent by his Division of the Grand Fleet on some sort of work at sea, I spoke of the \"rather strenuous interval\" we had experienced.  \"If you think life in a battleship of the Grand Fleet strenuous,\" laughed the Captain, extending himself comfortably in his armchair before the glowing grate, \"I wonder what you would have thought of the life we led in the old _Cornwall_. Not very far from a hundred and twenty thousand miles of steaming was her record for the first two years of the war, and in that time she ploughed most of the Seven Seas and coasted in the waters of all but one of the Six Continents. Always on the lookout for something or other, coaling as we could, provisioning as we might--let me tell you that coming to the Grand Fleet after that (at least until a few months had elapsed and the contrast wore off) was like retiring on a pension in comparison.\"  He settled himself deeper into the soft upholstery, extended his feet nearer the fire, lighted a fresh cigar, and, in the hour which elapsed before the evening mail came aboard, told me of the work of the _Cornwall_ in those first chaotic weeks of the war which preceded the battle of the Falklands.  \"We were at Plymouth when the war began,\" said he, \"and our first work was in connexion with protecting and 'shepherding' safely to port several British ships carrying bullion which were still on the high seas. It was a baffling sort of a job, especially as there were two or three German raiders loose in the North Atlantic, the favourite ruse of each of which was to represent itself as a British cruiser engaged in the same benevolent work the _Cornwall_ was on. Warned of these 'wolves-in-shepherds'-clothing,' the merchantmen we sought to protect were afraid to reveal their whereabouts by wireless, the consequence being that our first forerunning efforts to safeguard the seas resolved themselves into a sort of marine combination of 'Blind-Man's Buff' and 'Hide-and-Seek,' played pretty well all over the Atlantic. All the ships with especially valuable cargoes got safely to port ultimately, though none of them, that I recall, directly under the wing of the _Cornwall_. It was our first taste of the 'So-near-and-yet-so-far' kind of life that is the inevitable lot of the cruiser which essays the dual rôle of 'Commerce Protector' and 'Raider Chaser.'  \"After a few hours at 'Gib,' we were next sent across to Casa Blanca, where the appearance of the _Cornwall_ was about the first tangible evidence that French Africa had of the fact that England was really coming into the war in earnest. There was a good deal of unrest in Morocco at the time, for the Germans were even then at work upon their insidious propaganda among the Moslems of all the colonies of the Allies. The 'buzz' in the bazaars that the appearance of a British warship started must have served a very useful purpose at this critical juncture in carrying to the Arabs of the interior word that France was not going to have to stand alone against Germany. Our reception by both the French and native population of Casa Blanca was most enthusiastic, and during all of our stay a cheering procession followed in the wake of every party of officers or men who went ashore.  \"Leaving Casa Blanca, we were sent back to the Atlantic to search for commerce destroyers, ultimately working south by the Canaries and Cape Verde Islands to South American waters, where the _Karlsruhe_ was then at the zenith of her activities. The chase of this enterprising and elusive raider, whose career was finally brought to an inglorious end by her going aground on a West Indian Island, kept the _Cornwall_--along with a number of other British cruisers--steadily on the move, until the ominous and painful news of the destruction of Craddock's fleet off Coronel suddenly brought us face to face with the fact that there was soon going to be bigger game than a lone pirate to be stalked.  \"We never had the luck to sight even so much as the smoke of the _Karlsruhe_, although--as I only learned too late to take advantage of the information--the _Cornwall_ was within an hour or two's steaming of her on one occasion. I _did_ think we had her once, though--a jolly amusing incident it was, too. I was getting uncomfortably short of food at the time--a very common experience in the 'here-to-day-and-gone-to-morrow' sort of life we were leading;--so that when the welcome news reached me by wireless one morning that a British ship--Buenos Aires to New York with frozen beef--was due to pass through the waters we were then patrolling, I lost no time in heading over to intercept her on the chance of doing a bit of marketing.  \"We picked her up promptly as reckoned, but, while she was still hull down on the horizon, her skipper began to signal frantically, '_I am being chased by the \"Karlsruhe\"!_' Here was luck indeed. I ordered 'Action Stations' to be sounded, and the course of the ship to be altered toward the point where I figured the smoke of the pursuing pirate would begin to smudge the sky-line as she came swooping down upon her prey. Sighting nothing after holding on this course for a while, I came to the conclusion that the raider must be hidden by the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42604"],["title","Stories of the Ships (#1)"],["body","smoke-pall with which the flying beef-ship had masked a wide arc of the western horizon, and headed up in that direction, begging the fugitive in the meantime to give me the bearing of her pursuer as accurately as possible.  \"Her only reply to this, however, was to belch out 'smoke-screen' faster than ever and continue rending the empyrean ether with renewed '_I am being chased by the \"Karlsruhe\"!_' In vain I assured her that we were the H.M.S. _Cornwall_, and would take the greatest delight in seeing that the chase was put an end to, if she would only tell us from which direction the _Karlsruhe_ was coming, and cease to throw out a bituminous blanket for the enemy to hide behind. Blacker and blacker rolled the smoke, heavier and heavier piled the screen to leeward, and still more frantically shrilled the appeals for help. At the end of my patience at actions which it now began to dawn upon me looked more than a little suspicious, I headed the _Cornwall_ straight after the runaway and soon reduced the interval separating us sufficiently to reach her with 'Visual.' She brought up sharp at my 'Stop instantly!' and a quarter of an hour later my boarding party was clambering over her side.  \"'Where's the _Karlsruhe_?' I shouted impatiently to the Boarding Officer as his boat came back alongside again. I knew something of the accuracy of German long range naval gunnery, and was far from being easy in mind regarding the kind of surprise packet that might at any moment be wafted out of that slowly thinning smoke-blur to leeward.  \"'There,' he replied with a comprehensive sweep of the arm in quite the opposite direction from the one I had been expecting the enemy. 'Right there, Sir.' That old lunatic of a skipper thought the _Cornwall_ was the _Karlsruhe_!\"  \"Did you get your frozen beef?\" I asked.  The Captain smiled the pleased smile of one who recalls something that has given him great satisfaction.  \"I think that afternoon marked the beginning of the 'Food Economy' campaign in the Navy,\" he replied. \"If the Admiralty had been able to continue buying frozen beef at the rate that crestfallen but highly relieved skipper--quite of his own free will--charged for the lot we loaded up after he had found it was not to be his fate to be sunk by the _Karlsruhe_,--well, the Government could have probably built a new battleship or two and never missed the money out of the saving.\"  The recollection of the treat that fresh meat was after a long period on \"bully beef\" ration turned the Captain's thoughts to another time of plenty he had experienced after the _Cornwall_ had helped the wounded _Carmania_ limp back to Base following her successful engagement with the _Cap Trafalgar_.  \"In these times of food economy and restricted rations,\" he said, \"it fairly makes my mouth water to think of the feasts Captain G---- spread for us during the days we were devising a way to get the battered _Carmania_ back to England. You see, when the war started she was just about to sail on one of her transatlantic voyages with the usual midsummer cargo of American millionaires, and her cuisine was of a character calculated to satisfy their Epicurean tastes. When they converted her to an auxiliary cruiser, it was the usual sledge-hammer, crow-bar, and over-the-side procedure with the mirrors, the upholsteries, and the mahoganies, but they left the stores, God bless them, they left the stores. Can you fancy how things such as truffled quail, and asparagus tips with mayonnaise--_iced_--and _café parfait_, and Muscat dates, and California oranges--with the big gold labels on--tasted to men who had been for weeks pretty nearly down to the classic old wind-jammer ration of 'lobscouse' and 'dog's-body'? And those plump, black, five-inch-long Havanas in the silver foil (I can smell the soothing fumes of them yet), and that rarely blended Mocha, and those bottles of 1835 Cognac--the pungent bouquet of them scents the memories of the long evenings I sat with G---- in the wreck of his fire-swept cabin while he yarned to me of the ripping fight he had just come out of. And how we all envied G---- his luck--getting as sporting a show as a man could ask for in that half-converted liner while we cruisers were vainly chasing smoke and rumours over most of the South Atlantic. Nothing less than the banquets he gave us would have salved our heart-burnings.\"  And so it was that the Captain was led on to speak of what he had heard--from those who took part in it, and only a few hours from the time it happened--of the first great duel ever fought between modern armed merchantmen, a conflict, indeed, which is still practically unique in naval history.  \"There was not much to choose between the ships,\" he said. \"The _Cap Trafalgar_--one of the latest of the Hamburg Sud Amerika liners--had a good deal the best of it on the score of age, and the _Carmania_ probably something on the score of size. The latter had been hastily converted at Liverpool immediately after the outbreak of the war, while the former turned herself from sheep into wolf about the same time by arming herself with the guns of a small German gun-boat. This craft, by the way, steamed to the nearest Brazilian port and, with true Hunnish logic, claimed the right to intern as a peaceful German Merchantman on the strength of the fact that it was no longer armed! The largest guns that either ship had were four-inch, the _Carmania_ having slight advantage on the score of number. The _Carmania_ would have been no match for the _Karlsruhe_, just as the _Cap Trafalgar_ would have fallen easy prey to the _Cornwall_ or another of the British cruisers in those waters. Under the circumstances, it was a happy fatality that let these two ex-floating palaces fight with each other and in their own class.  \"The first word we had of the engagement was a wireless Captain G---- sent out saying, in effect, that he had sunk the _Trafalgar_, but, as his bridge was burned up, his steering gear shot away, and all his navigating instruments destroyed, that he would be glad to have some one come and tell him where he was and lead him to a place where he could, so to speak, lie down and lick his wounds for a while. It took a jolly good bit of searching to find a ship that couldn't tell any more about itself than that, but we finally sighted her ragged silhouette and gave her a lead to such a haven as the practically open seas of our rendezvous afforded.  \"Poor G---- had lost a good deal more than his steering gear it soon transpired, for the fire which had consumed his bridge had also gutted his cabin, and reduced everything in it to cinders except an old Norfolk jacket. How _that_ escaped we never could figure out, for of garments hanging on pegs to the left and right of it no trace was left. As G---- was of about three times the girth of any other British officer in those waters at the time, the wardrobe we tried to get together for him was a grotesque combination; indeed, so far as I recall now, the old Norfolk had to serve him as everything from pyjamas and bath-robe to dinner-jacket and great-coat during that trying period. It was a weird figure he cut presiding at those Gargantuan feasts he spread for us on the bruised and battered old _Carmania_, but there wasn't a one of us who wouldn't have changed places with him--Norfolk and all--for the assurance of half his luck. Such is the monotony of this patrol work in the outer seas, that, after your first enthusiasm wears off, you get into a state of mind in which you can never conceive that anything is ever going to happen. That we had the one most decisive naval battle of the war just ahead of us, no one dreamed at this time.  \"The fight between the _Carmania_ and _Cap Trafalgar_,\" he continued, \"has well been called 'The Battle of the Haystacks,' for never before (or since, for that matter) have two ships with such towering upper works stood off and tried to batter each other to pieces with gunfire. Indeed, I well recall G----'s saying that, up to the very end, he could not conceive that either ship could sink the other, and of how--even after the _Carmania_ had been struck three or four-score times and a raging fire forward had driven him from the bridge--he kept wondering in the back of his brain what sort of a fight the duel would resolve itself into when both had exhausted their shells. Luckily, he did not have to face that problem.  \"Both ships, according to G----'s account, began blazing at each other as soon as they came in range, and, as each was eager to fight it out to a finish, the distance separating them was, for a while, reduced as rapidly as possible. At something like three thousand yards, however, some sort of a rapid-fire gun burst into action on the _Trafalgar_. 'It didn't appear to be doing me much harm,' said G---- in telling of it, 'but the incessant \"pom-pom\" of the accursed thing got so much on my nerves that I drew off far enough to dull the edge of its infernal yapping.'  \"A thing which came near to putting the _Carmania_ out of the running before she had completed the polishing off of her opponent was the shell which I have spoken of as violating the sanctity of the Captain's cabin--the one that burned everything but the Norfolk jacket. This projectile--a four-inch--though (probably owing to the small resistance offered by the light upper works) it did not explode, generated enough heat in its passage to start a fire. Beginning on G----'s personal effects, this conflagration spread to the bridge, destroying the navigating instruments and ultimately making it impossible to remain there--the latter a serious blow in itself. What made this fire especially troublesome was the difficulty, because of the cutting of the main, of bringing water to bear upon it. As it was, it was necessary to head the _Carmania_ 'down the wind' to reduce the draught fanning the flames. Nothing else would have saved her. Except for one thing, this expedient would have"]]]
