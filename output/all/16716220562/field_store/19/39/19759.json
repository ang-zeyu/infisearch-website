A set grin was on the English youth's face, and as their eyes met Freddy lifted his right hand with the fingers closed and the thumb sticking straight up. Dave nodded and returned the thumbs up sign.  \"After all, there're only three of them,\" he grunted, and switched his gaze back to the advancing dots. \"If Freddy and I can't handle three of the tramps, then we just don't belong!\"  The dots were no longer dots. They had taken on definite shape and outlines. And they were as Dave expected them to be, three long range Messerschmitt One-Tens. At that very instant the two wing planes broke away from the center plane to opposite sides, and took up positions for a three direction attack on the ferry bomber formation. Dave shot out his hand and shoved the throttles of the P-Thirty-Eight's Allison engines wide open. Then he eased the nose up a hair, and with Freddy right at his wingtip he went streaking up over the ferry bombers and straight for the center Messerschmitt.  Not a word, of course, had been spoken between them. But there was no need for words. Too often had they tackled three enemy planes in spread out line formation not to know exactly what should be done, and to do it instinctively. And so, wingtip to wingtip, they slammed straight at the center Messerschmitt as though it were the only enemy craft in the air, and they were bent on its immediate destruction.  When they were still a ways from it they both opened fire and sliced a shower of hissing bullets across the sky. If they got any lucky shots into the center Messerschmitt, they didn't know. But hitting it was not their big idea. On the contrary, they counted on exactly what happened. The pilot of the center Messerschmitt didn't like the idea of two P-Thirty-Eights boring in at him. He started to return the fire, then lost heart and slammed down in a sharp dive.  But even before the German broke away from the fight, Dave and Freddy were completing the rest of their maneuver. Like streaks of greased lightning, each whirled off to his side and went thundering in for a broadside attack on the two other Messerschmitts about to close with the helpless ferry bomber formation. Maybe the pilots of those two Nazi planes figured that they had actually remained hidden in the rays of the dawn sun. Maybe they figured that Dave and Freddy had decided to make sure of at least one victim, and pray the other two would miss the bombers and over-shoot and have to come back. In fact, maybe those Nazi pilots figured a lot of things. The point is, though, they figured all wrong. For a couple of moments they had a chance at the bombers that was as easy as shooting fish in a barrel. But in the next they had a couple of flying wild men on their necks.  The impulse to twist around and see how Freddy was making out with his man was strong in Dave as he went cutting in at his victim with all guns blazing. Naturally, though, he didn't dare take out even that small amount of time. Even if Freddy and he got their respective Messerschmitts there was still a third boiling around some place in the sky. And so he tore in savagely, and thrilled with wild joy as he saw his tracers cutting into the Messerschmitt from its two spinning props clear back to the double-finned tail. The Nazi gunner-observer returned his fire, and the pilot tried to whip around and into the clear. For all the good it did him he might just as well have climbed out and tried to walk the dawn sky back to Germany.  The Messerschmitt seemed suddenly to fly smack into an invisible brick wall in the sky. The plane fell off sharply to the right, and came way up by the nose. For a brief instant it hovered there in the air. Then red flame belched out from the two underslung Benz-Daimler engines, and in the next split second the whole business was just a mass of fire slithering down toward the rolling grey-green swells of the North Atlantic.  \"Save a seat for Hitler, where you're going!\" Dave yelled as he pulled his P-Thirty-Eight up and around. \"He'll be joining you before very long. And--\"  The rest died in his throat, and his heart seemed to zoom up and jam against his back teeth. It was at that moment that he saw Freddy Farmer's plane flip-flopping and half spinning down out of the sky as though either it were completely out of control--or its pilot were dead. And thundering down with blazing guns after Freddy were the two other Messerschmitts.  \"No, no, it can't happen!\" Dave sobbed wildly, and whirled off his climb and down into a dive. \"Freddy boy! What happened? They didn't get you! _They didn't get you!_\"  Those and other words of anguish spilled off his lips as he hammered his Lockheed down in a wing-screaming dive. So great was his excitement, and so great the terror that clutched at his heart, he failed to see that Nazi bullets weren't coming very close to Freddy's plane. As a matter of fact, the Germans were shooting half-heartedly. With the Lockheed headed straight for the North Atlantic, they figured that the finish of their victim was inevitable.  But they hadn't figured on Dave, nor the terrific diving speed of his plane. As a result the \"fun\" for one of them was short-lived. Though his heart shed tears of blood for Freddy Farmer, Dave's grip on the controls was rock steady, and his eye to the ring sight keen and sharp. A two second burst from his guns was all that was needed. A longer burst would have been sheer waste of ammunition. The Nazi's wing came off as though hacked clean by a knife. What was left spun like so much stiff paper tossed into a whirlpool, and then broke up in a shower of flying wreckage.  One Nazi less, but what of it? Freddy was but a couple of hundred feet from the water now, and still flip-flopping helplessly downward with the remaining German pecking away at him. Stark reality was like white hot knives twisting about in Dave's heart and in his brain. Tears flooded his eyes, and he unconsciously hammered his free fist against the already wide open throttles.  \"Dear God, please no!\" he sobbed. \"Don't take Freddy. Don't take Freddy away. I need him! England needs him. The whole decent part of the world needs him. Please don't...!\"  Dave never finished the last, for at that exact instant a miracle seemed to take place right before his startled eyes. Freddy Farmer's plane stopped flip-flopping and spinning around abruptly. As though someone had reached down and stopped it, the Lockheed came up onto even keel. But it did much more than that! It came up past even keel and on up into a power zoom. Its guns yammered out sound and flame, and perhaps for the infinitesimal part of a split second the pilot of the third and last Messerschmitt was the most stunned and bewildered man in the whole wide world.  But only for that flash of time. In practically nothing flat he was no longer capable of thought, and less of action. He was just a dead man hunched over the controls of a diving plane--that is, the bullet-shattered wreckage of a diving plane. Before he had had the chance to blink or move a muscle, Freddy Farmer had pinned him cold to the dawn sky. And, not a little bewildered himself, Dave saw the Messerschmitt fall apart in mid-air, and Freddy Farmer, grinning from ear to ear, come tearing up past him and level off the top of his zoom. Automatically, Dave pulled up out of his own dive and swung around to join Freddy Farmer. The English-born air ace was still grinning, and he was holding up one hand, forming an \"O\" with thumb and forefinger, and extending the other three straight upward. Dave gaped at him a moment longer, and then shook his head to drive the cobwebs and mist away.  \"So, just another Freddy Farmer trick!\" he growled, and shook a fist at the English youth. \"I might have known that you were simply slipping out of a tight jam. And to think I was beginning to pray for you--you bum!\"  Freddy, of course, didn't hear the words, but he saw Dave's moving lips, and probably guessed what they were saying. His mouth opened in silent laughter, and he made a gesture with one hand, which was just the same as his lips saying:  \"Weren't getting worried, were you, old chap?\"     CHAPTER SIX  _Nazi Wrath_   Like so many huge birds of prey coming home to roost, the twenty-one ferry bombers slid down to a landing on the R.A.F. field at Land's End at the southwest tip of England, and went trundling over to the tarmac line and the waiting mechanics. When the last had touched earth, Dave and Freddy cut their throttles and slid down also. They landed together and taxied that way up to the line. When he reached it Dave cut his ignition, climbed out and hurried stiff-legged over to Freddy's plane.  \"What was the big idea of giving me such a case of heart failure?\" he demanded of his pal. \"Holy smoke! That little business took fifteen years off my life, if it took a day. In future, don't do that to me, see?\"  Freddy legged down and pulled off his helmet and goggles.  \"You think I was just having sport?\" he snorted. \"Far from it, my lad. I missed my man completely. A blasted good pilot he was, too. Next thing I knew two of them had me all wrapped up and were ready to send me some place I had no fancy to go to. Much, much too close for comfort, so the only thing I could do was fake being hit and spin the bus downward. That at least threw off their aim a bit. And when I pulled out and up in the last second, they were--\"  Freddy paused and grinned broadly.  \"Well, the remaining blighter was too surprised to do anything about stopping me,\" he said. \"But thanks for taking care of that other beggar. I might not have surprised both of them. Fact is, I fancy you saved my life again, old thing. I'm grateful.\"  \"You should get tossed in the duck pond for giving me such a scare!\" Dave growled, but softened it with a grin. \"Well, here's England. Aren't"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42250"],["title","Dave Dawson with the Commandos (#7)"],["body"," you going to drop down and kiss the ground, or something? _This_ is England, Freddy!\"  The English youth smiled, and there were stars in his eyes.  \"Yes, England again,\" he whispered softly. \"How wonderful to return to it from uncivilized lands where they eat raw things and call them hot dogs, and talk through their teeth, and drive ninety miles an hour even to funerals! Yes, blessed England! It's like being reborn. Like--like--\"  \"Like waking up from a beautiful dream!\" Dave snapped, and waved a hand at the sky that was now overcast. \"See? No sun over here! And just thirty minutes off shore we had plenty of it. What have the weather gods got against you English guys, anyway?\"  Freddy didn't have time to think up a kidding come-back for that one. They both turned at the sound of footsteps behind them, and saw Major Barber hurrying over toward them. The Commando Chief was grinning from ear to ear, and he looked as if he wanted to hug and kiss them both. He didn't, however. Instead, he grabbed each in turn by the hand and nearly shook his arm off at the shoulder socket.  \"I hope some day it will be my chance to return that little favor of life saving!\" he cried. \"And that goes for everybody aboard the ferry bombers. I had a front seat, and what you two did sure was something to see. You seemed to have a little trouble, Farmer. Hey! You didn't get wounded, did you?\"  \"Him?\" Dave snorted before Freddy could even shake his head. \"The Nazis haven't made that bullet yet. No, sir. He just wanted to show you how fancy he could get when there're Messerschmitts around. I've just been telling him that if he pulls that on me again, I'll probably shoot him down myself. But it was pretty cute, wasn't it, Major? He should be given his wings any day now, I say. Practically a fighter pilot.\"  \"Don't mind Dawson, sir,\" Freddy spoke up. \"He's always that way. Pretty cool in a fight, but when it's all over he simply goes to pieces and says the craziest things. No, I wasn't hit, fortunately. I had a close call, though, and had to do a little something extra to get out of it. We're all here, though. And that's that!\"  \"And it's plenty!\" Major Barber said with a grim nod. \"It proves this sort of thing can be done on a large scale. That is--\"  The Major paused and grinned.  \"That is, if we have fellows like you two along,\" he added. \"Well, stick around for a bit, will you? I've got things to do, but I want to talk to you again. There's the mess shack over there. I guess it won't make either of you mad to take aboard some breakfast, huh?\"  \"Oh, quite, quite!\" Dave mimicked at Freddy. \"And, of course, a pot of tea, what, old tin of fruit?\"  Freddy Farmer groaned and shook his head, and looked helplessly at Major Barber.  \"It's so utterly useless and futile, sir!\" he sighed. \"I mean the way Dawson murders the King's English. Something really should be done about it. Would you suggest gagging him, sir?\"  If the Major replied, nobody heard it. At that moment the air raid siren mounted atop the Operations Office let forth with its blood-curdling wail. Without thinking, both Dave and Freddy spun around and dived for their planes. In nothing flat they were in the pits and rocketing their ships across the field. As Dave pulled his clear and went twisting around and upward, he snapped out of his action trance long enough to look at the fuel gauge. A sigh of relief spilled from his lips when he saw that he still had enough high octane for thirty-five minutes of flying.  \"And lots of things can happen in thirty-five minutes!\" he shouted aloud.  \"Quite!\" came the sudden and startling voice of Freddy Farmer over the radio. \"And there are the blighters! Off there to the southeast. Fancy they got annoyed when they learned the bombers got through, and decided to have a go at a ground strafe. Tally-ho, Dave! And there's the R.A.F. chaps coming up to join in the fun. But we'll get first cracks at the beggars.\"  \"Sure, but remember about last time!\" Dave shouted back at him. \"No funny business. Get your man this time, and no fooling around. Okay, kid! Up and at 'em!\"  As Dave snouted the last he lifted the nose to a steeper angle, and went wing-screaming up toward a group of ten Nazi long range fighters that were bearing down on the Land's End field. Twisting in the seat, he glanced down back at the swarm of R.A.F. Spitfires and Hurricanes that were racing up off the field. A pleasant warmth surged through his body, and there was a glad song in his heart.  \"Just like the old days!\" he cried happily. \"Flying with the dear old R.A.F. again. Yeah, good! Plenty good!\"  As though to echo his words, he heard Freddy Farmer's guns blast away. The leading Nazi plane swerved, then dropped by the nose and started down with one engine smoking badly. Dave grunted and ruddered his P-Thirty-Eight a little to bring his sights to bear on another Nazi plane.  \"Okay, first blood for you, Freddy!\" he sang out. \"But it's my turn, now, and how!\"  His words were no crazy boast. They were simply a statement of cold fact. And as his guns started hammering out made-in-America doom, his statement was proved. A second Nazi would-be ground strafer seemed to jump straight up in the air. That is, the fuselage went upward. The wings remained at the lower level for a moment, then went slip-sliding away. The fuselage fell over by the nose and went down like a bomb as two objects popped out of it and soon became a pair of Germans going down by parachute.  The swift double kill obviously took some of the lust for battle away from the other Nazi pilots. The formation swerved this way and that, and then broke up into pairs that made half-hearted passes at the ferry bomber-covered field below. But they all should have stayed home. By then the pilots of the locally based R.A.F. squadrons were in the scrap, and their arrival just about settled things for the Germans. A couple of them did linger around a little longer, but that was very stupid of them. They went down like nailed clay pigeons, while their pals went streaking back across the Channel to their temporary homes in Occupied France.  When Dave and Freddy came down out of the air and landed, an orderly was waiting for them.  \"Group Captain Farnsworth wishes to see you two officers at once,\" he told them.  \"Guess breakfast waits, pal.\" Dave grinned at Freddy. \"Let's go. I guess Major Barber is with the Group Captain. I don't see him around any place. So maybe this is it.\"  \"Maybe, but I wouldn't be too sure,\" Freddy murmured.  Dave looked at him sharply.  \"What do you mean by that?\" he demanded.  \"Nothing, I hope,\" the English youth grunted. \"But I believe I've heard of Group Captain Farnsworth. Very much of a stickler for rules and regulations. And--well, after all, this is an R.A.F. field, you know.\"  \"So what?\" Dave demanded as he stared, puzzle-eyed. \"What's that got to do with it? Hey! What's eating you, anyway?\"  Freddy shrugged and started walking toward the Field Commandant's office.  \"Let's go and find out,\" he said. \"I could be wrong, of course.\"  \"You could be nuts!\" Dave growled, still mystified. \"And I think you are!\"  The English youth let that one slide. He simply hunched his shoulders once and walked with Dave over toward the office. They reached it in time, knocked, and went inside when a rasping voice told them to do so. Seated at the desk inside was a heavy-browed, red-headed man in an R.A.F. Group Captain's uniform. The decoration ribbons under his R.A.F. wings showed that this was not the first war he had fought in. And they also showed that he had not exactly kept his feet on solid earth all the time in either war. But his eyes were his outstanding feature. They were like frosted cubes of ice that seemed to melt everything that came into their range of vision. Dave looked into those eyes and gulped a little.  \"Captains Dawson and Farmer reporting, sir,\" he heard his own voice say. \"You wished to see us, sir?\"  \"Blasted right I do!\" the words came smashing at him. \"Just who the ruddy blue blazes do you think you two are? A little special air force all your own?\"     CHAPTER SEVEN  _More Orders_   Dave was filled with the sudden desire to have the office floor open up and permit him to drop down through out of sight. Those frosted ice cube eyes pinned him in his tracks, and held his own like powerful magnets. He couldn't have turned his head to see Freddy's face if he had wanted to. He gulped and moistened his tongue.  \"I beg your pardon, sir?\" he managed. \"I--\"  \"Never mind begging my pardon!\" the owner of the frosted eyes flung at him. \"Just answer my question. Who the devil do you two think you are? Who gave you permission to take off from this field and engage enemy aircraft?\"  Dave was too stunned even to begin to think up an answer. Instead, he listened to Freddy Farmer speak for them both.  \"I'm afraid we didn't stop to think, sir,\" the English youth said. \"When we heard the alarm siren we simply jumped for our planes. It was like that. I realize we shouldn't have, sir. But--well, I was in the air by that time. And it seemed the right thing to keep on and have a go at the Jerry ships. I'm sorry, sir. We're both sorry, sir.\"  A touch of sudden anger slashed through Dave, and the words were out of his mouth before he could check them.  \"I'm not, sir!\" he cried. \"I'm never sorry when I get a Nazi, no matter how or where I get him. We saw them coming, and it was our job to do something about it. That's all there was to it!\"  The Group Captain stared at Dave and made a solid line with his brows.  \"Not sorry?\" he barked. \"Who said anything about not being sorry? I demand, however, that you apologize to me, and to my fighter pilots!\"  \"Apologize?\" Dave gasped, as he seemed to lose his grip on things. \"For what? For knocking off a couple of Jerry planes, for cat's sake?\"  The senior officer looked sterner than ever; then the ghost of a smile quivered at the corners of his mouth.  \"Certainly, Captain Dawson,\" he said"]]]
