May and June made sad havoc in the already thin ranks of our battalion. Nearly a score died in my company--L--and the other companies suffered proportionately.  Among the first to die of my company comrades, was a genial little Corporal, \"Billy\" Phillips--who was a favorite with us all. Everything was done for him that kindness could suggest, but it was of little avail.  Then \"Bruno\" Weeks--a young boy, the son of a preacher, who had run away from his home in Fulton County, Ohio, to join us, succumbed to hardship and privation.  The next to go was good-natured, harmless Victor Seitz, a Detroit cigar maker, a German, and one of the slowest of created mortals.  How he ever came to go into the cavalry was beyond the wildest surmises of his comrades.  Why his supernatural slowness and clumsiness did not result in his being killed at least once a day, while in the service, was even still farther beyond the power of conjecture.  No accident ever happened in the company that Seitz did not have some share in.  Did a horse fall on a slippery road, it was almost sure to be Seitz's, and that imported son of the Fatherland was equally sure to be caught under him.  Did somebody tumble over a bank of a dark night, it was Seitz that we soon heard making his way back, swearing in deep German gutterals, with frequent allusion to 'tausend teuflin.'  Did a shanty blow down, we ran over and pulled Seitz out of the debris, when he would exclaim:  \"Zo!  dot vos pretty vunny now, ain't it?\"  And as he surveyed the scene of his trouble with true German phlegm, he would fish a brier-wood pipe from the recesses of his pockets, fill it with tobacco, and go plodding off in a cloud of smoke in search of some fresh way to narrowly escape destruction.  He did not know enough about horses to put a snaffle-bit in one's mouth, and yet he would draw the friskiest, most mettlesome animal in the corral, upon whose back he was scarcely more at home than he would be upon a slack rope.  It was no uncommon thing to see a horse break out of ranks, and go past the battalion like the wind, with poor Seitz clinging to his mane like the traditional grim Death to a deceased African.  We then knew that Seitz had thoughtlessly sunk the keen spurs he would persist in wearing; deep into the flanks of his high-mettled animal.  These accidents became so much a matter-of-course that when anything unusual occurred in the company our first impulse was to go and help Seitz out.  When the bugle sounded \"boots and saddles,\" the rest of us would pack up, mount, \"count off by fours from the right,\" and be ready to move out before the last notes of the call had fairly died away.  Just then we would notice an unsaddled horse still tied to the hitching place.  It was Seitz's, and that worthy would be seen approaching, pipe in mouth, and bridle in hand, with calm, equable steps, as if any time before the expiration of his enlistment would be soon enough to accomplish the saddling of his steed.  A chorus of impatient and derisive remarks would go up from his impatient comrades:  \"For heaven's sake, Seitz, hurry up!\"  \"Seitz!  you are like a cow's tail--always behind!\"  \"Seitz, you are slower than the second coming of the Savior!\"  \"Christmas is a railroad train alongside of you, Seitz!\"  \"If you ain't on that horse in half a second, Seitz, we'll go off and leave you, and the Johnnies will skin you alive!\" etc., etc.  Not a ripple of emotion would roll over Seitz's placid features under the sharpest of these objurgations.  At last, losing all patience, two or three boys would dismount, run to Seitz's horse, pack, saddle and bridle him, as if he were struck with a whirlwind.  Then Seitz would mount, and we would move 'off.  For all this, we liked him.  His good nature was boundless, and his disposition to oblige equal to the severest test.  He did not lack a grain of his full share of the calm, steadfast courage of his race, and would stay where he was put, though Erebus yawned and bade him fly. He was very useful, despite his unfitness for many of the duties of a cavalryman.  He was a good guard, and always ready to take charge of prisoners, or be sentry around wagons or a forage pile-duties that most of the boys cordially hated.  But he came into the last trouble at Andersonville.  He stood up pretty well under the hardships of Belle Isle, but lost his cheerfulness--his unrepining calmness--after a few weeks in the Stockade.  One day we remembered that none of us had seen him for several days, and we started in search of him.  We found him in a distant part of the camp, lying near the Dead Line.  His long fair hair was matted together, his blue eyes had the flush of fever.  Every part of his clothing was gray with the lice that were hastening his death with their torments.  He uttered the first complaint I ever heard him make, as I came up to him:  \"My Gott, M ----, dis is worse dun a dog's det!\"  In a few days we gave him all the funeral in our power; tied his big toes together, folded his hands across his breast, pinned to his shirt a slip of paper, upon which was written:                 VICTOR E. SEITZ,           Co. L, Sixteenth Illinois Cavalry.  And laid his body at the South Gate, beside some scores of others that were awaiting the arrival of the six-mule wagon that hauled them to the Potter's Field, which was to be their last resting-place.  John Emerson and John Stiggall, of my company, were two Norwegian boys, and fine specimens of their race--intelligent, faithful, and always ready for duty.  They had an affection for each other that reminded one of the stories told of the sworn attachment and the unfailing devotion that were common between two Gothic warrior youths.  Coming into Andersonville some little time after the rest of us, they found all the desirable ground taken up, and they established their quarters at the base of the hill, near the Swamp.  There they dug a little hole to lie in, and put in a layer of pine leaves.  Between them they had an overcoat and a blanket. At night they lay upon the coat and covered themselves with the blanket. By day the blanket served as a tent.  The hardships and annoyances that we endured made everybody else cross and irritable.  At times it seemed impossible to say or listen to pleasant words, and nobody was ever allowed to go any length of time spoiling for a fight.  He could usually be accommodated upon the spot to any extent he desired, by simply making his wishes known.  Even the best of chums would have sharp quarrels and brisk fights, and this disposition increased as disease made greater inroads upon them.  I saw in one instance two brothers-both of whom died the next day of scurvy--and who were so helpless as to be unable to rise, pull themselves up on their knees by clenching the poles of their tents --in order to strike each other with clubs, and they kept striking until the bystanders interfered and took their weapons away from them.  But Stiggall and Emerson never quarreled with each other.  Their tenderness and affection were remarkable to witness.  They began to go the way that so many were going; diarrhea and scurvy set in; they wasted away till their muscles and tissues almost disappeared, leaving the skin lying fiat upon the bones; but their principal solicitude was for each other, and each seemed actually jealous of any person else doing anything for the other.  I met Emerson one day, with one leg drawn clear out of shape, and rendered almost useless by the scurvy.  He was very weak, but was hobbling down towards the Creek with a bucket made from a boot leg. I said:  \"Johnny, just give me your bucket.  I'll fill it for you, and bring it up to your tent.\"  \"No; much obliged, M ----\" he wheezed out; \"my pardner wants a cool drink, and I guess I'd better get it for him.\"  Stiggall died in June.  He was one of the first victims of scurvy, which, in the succeeding few weeks, carried off so many.  All of us who had read sea-stories had read much of this disease and its horrors, but we had little conception of the dreadful reality.  It usually manifested itself first in the mouth. The breath became unbearably fetid; the gums swelled until they protruded, livid and disgusting, beyond the lips.  The teeth became so loose that they frequently fell out, and the sufferer would pick them up and set them back in their sockets.  In attempting to bite the hard corn bread furnished by the bakery the teeth often stuck fast and were pulled out.  The gums had a fashion of breaking away, in large chunks, which would be swallowed or spit out.  All the time one was eating his mouth would be filled with blood, fragments of gums and loosened teeth.  Frightful, malignant ulcers appeared in other parts of the body; the ever-present maggot flies laid eggs in these, and soon worms swarmed therein.  The sufferer looked and felt as if, though he yet lived and moved, his body was anticipating the rotting it would undergo a little later in the grave.  The last change was ushered in by the lower parts of the legs swelling. When this appeared, we considered the man doomed.  We all had scurvy, more or less, but as long as it kept out of our legs we were hopeful. First, the ankle joints swelled, then the foot became useless.  The swelling increased until the knees became stiff, and the skin from these down was distended until it looked pale, colorless and transparent as a tightly blown bladder.  The leg was so much larger at the bottom than at the thigh, that the sufferers used to make grim jokes about being modeled like a churn, \"with the biggest end down.\"  The man then became utterly helpless and usually died in a short time.  The official report puts down the number of deaths from scurvy at three thousand five hundred and seventy-four, but Dr. Jones, the Rebel surgeon, reported to the Rebel Government his belief that nine-tenths of the great mortality of the prison was due, either directly or"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4258"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons — Volume 2 (#8)"],["body","rectly, to this cause.  The only effort made by the Rebel doctors to check its ravages was occasionally to give a handful of sumach berries to some particularly bad case.  When Stiggall died we thought Emerson would certainly follow him in a day or two, but, to our surprise, he lingered along until August before dying.     CHAPTER XXXII.  \"OLE BOO,\" AND \"OLE SOL, THE HAYMAKER\"--A FETID, BURNING DESERT--NOISOME WATER, AND THE EFFECTS OF DRINKING IT--STEALING SOFT SOAP.  The gradually lengthening Summer days were insufferably long and wearisome.  Each was hotter, longer and more tedious than its predecessors.  In my company was a none-too-bright fellow, named Dawson. During the chilly rains or the nipping, winds of our first days in prison, Dawson would, as he rose in, the morning, survey the forbidding skies with lack-luster eyes and remark, oracularly:  \"Well, Ole Boo gits us agin, to-day.\"  He was so unvarying in this salutation to the morn that his designation of disagreeable weather as \"Ole Boo\" became generally adopted by us. When the hot weather came on, Dawson's remark, upon rising and seeing excellent prospects for a scorcher, changed to: \"Well, Ole Sol, the Haymaker, is going to git in his work on us agin to-day.\"  As long as he lived and was able to talk, this was Dawson's invariable observation at the break of day.  He was quite right.  The Ole Haymaker would do some famous work before he descended in the West, sending his level rays through the wide interstices between the somber pines.  By nine o'clock in the morning his beams would begin to fairly singe everything in the crowded pen.  The hot sand would glow as one sees it in the center of the unshaded highway some scorching noon in August.  The high walls of the prison prevented the circulation inside of any breeze that might be in motion, while the foul stench rising from the putrid Swamp and the rotting ground seemed to reach the skies.  One can readily comprehend the horrors of death on the burning sands of a desert.  But the desert sand is at least clean; there is nothing worse about it than heat and intense dryness.  It is not, as that was at Andersonville, poisoned with the excretions of thousands of sick and dying men, filled with disgusting vermin, and loading the air with the germs of death.  The difference is as that between a brick-kiln and a sewer.  Should the fates ever decide that I shall be flung out upon sands to perish, I beg that the hottest place in the Sahara may be selected, rather than such a spot as the interior of the Andersonville Stockade.  It may be said that we had an abundance of water, which made a decided improvement on a desert.  Doubtless--had that water been pure.  But every mouthful of it was a blood poison, and helped promote disease and death. Even before reaching the Stockade it was so polluted by the drainage of the Rebel camps as to be utterly unfit for human use.  In our part of the prison we sank several wells--some as deep as forty feet--to procure water.  We had no other tools for this than our ever-faithful half canteens, and nothing wherewith to wall the wells.  But a firm clay was reached a few feet below the surface, which afforded tolerable strong sides for the lower part, ana furnished material to make adobe bricks for curbs to keep out the sand of the upper part.  The sides were continually giving away, however, and fellows were perpetually falling down the holes, to the great damage of their legs and arms.  The water, which was drawn up in little cans, or boot leg buckets, by strings made of strips of cloth, was much better than that of the creek, but was still far from pure, as it contained the seepage from the filthy ground.  The intense heat led men to drink great quantities of water, and this superinduced malignant dropsical complaints, which, next to diarrhea, scurvy and gangrene, were the ailments most active in carrying men off. Those affected in this way swelled up frightfully from day to day.  Their clothes speedily became too small for them, and were ripped off, leaving them entirely naked, and they suffered intensely until death at last came to their relief.  Among those of my squad who died in this way, was a young man named Baxter, of the Fifth Indiana Cavalry, taken at Chicamauga.  He was very fine looking--tall, slender, with regular features and intensely black hair and eyes; he sang nicely, and was generally liked.  A more pitiable object than he, when last I saw him, just before his death, can not be imagined.  His body had swollen until it seemed marvelous that the human skin could bear so much distention without disruption, All the old look of bright intelligence had been. driven from his face by the distortion of his features.  His swarthy hair and beard, grown long and ragged, had that peculiar repulsive look which the black hair of the sick is prone to assume.  I attributed much of my freedom from the diseases to which others succumbed to abstention from water drinking.  Long before I entered the army, I had constructed a theory--on premises that were doubtless as insufficient as those that boyish theories are usually based upon--that drinking water was a habit, and a pernicious one, which sapped away the energy.  I took some trouble to curb my appetite for water, and soon found that I got along very comfortably without drinking anything beyond that which was contained in my food.  I followed this up after entering the army, drinking nothing at any time but a little coffee, and finding no need, even on the dustiest marches, for anything more.  I do not presume that in a year I drank a quart of cold water.  Experience seemed to confirm my views, for I noticed that the first to sink under a fatigue, or to yield to sickness, were those who were always on the lookout for drinking water, springing from their horses and struggling around every well or spring on the line of march for an opportunity to fill their canteens.  I made liberal use of the Creek for bathing purposes, however, visiting it four or five times a day during the hot days, to wash myself all over.  This did not cool one off much, for the shallow stream was nearly as hot as the sand, but it seemed to do some good, and it helped pass away the tedious hours.  The stream was nearly all the time filled as full of bathers as they could stand, and the water could do little towards cleansing so many.  The occasional rain storms that swept across the prison were welcomed, not only because they cooled the air temporarily, but because they gave us a shower-bath.  As they came up, nearly every one stripped naked and got out where he could enjoy the full benefit of the falling water.  Fancy, if possible, the spectacle of twenty-five thousand or thirty thousand men without a stitch of clothing upon them.  The like has not been seen, I imagine, since the naked followers of Boadicea gathered in force to do battle to the Roman invaders.  It was impossible to get really clean.  Our bodies seemed covered with a varnish-like, gummy matter that defied removal by water alone. I imagined that it came from the rosin or turpentine, arising from the little pitch pine fires over which we hovered when cooking our rations. It would yield to nothing except strong soap-and soap, as I have before stated--was nearly as scarce in the Southern Confederacy as salt.  We in prison saw even less of it, or rather, none at all.  The scarcity of it, and our desire for it, recalls a bit of personal experience.  I had steadfastly refused all offers of positions outside the prison on parole, as, like the great majority of the prisoners, my hatred of the Rebels grew more bitter, day by day; I felt as if I would rather die than accept the smallest favor at their hands, and I shared the common contempt for those who did.  But, when the movement for a grand attack on the Stockade--mentioned in a previous chapter--was apparently rapidly coming to a head, I was offered a temporary detail outside to, assist in making up some rolls.  I resolved to accept; first because I thought I might get some information that would be of use in our enterprise; and, next, because I foresaw that the rush through the gaps in the Stockade would be bloody business, and by going out in advance I would avoid that much of the danger, and still be able to give effective assistance.  I was taken up to Wirz's office.  He was writing at a desk at one end of a large room when the Sergeant brought me in.  He turned around, told the Sergeant to leave me, and ordered me to sit down upon a box at the other end of the room.  Turning his back and resuming his writing, in a few minutes he had forgotten me.  I sat quietly, taking in the details for a half-hour, and then, having exhausted everything else in the room, I began wondering what was in the box I was sitting upon.  The lid was loose; I hitched it forward a little without attracting Wirz's attention, and slipped my left hand down of a voyage of discovery.  It seemed very likely that there was something there that a loyal Yankee deserved better than a Rebel. I found that it was a fine article of soft soap.  A handful was scooped up and speedily shoved into my left pantaloon pocket.  Expecting every instant that Wirz would turn around and order me to come to the desk to show my handwriting, hastily and furtively wiped my hand on the back of my shirt and watched Wirz with as innocent an expression as a school boy assumes when he has just flipped a chewed paper wad across the room. Wirz was still engrossed in his writing, and did not look around.  I was emboldened to reach down for another handful.  This was also successfully transferred, the hand wiped off on the back of the shirt, and the face wore its expression of infantile ingenuousness.  Still Wirz did not look up.  I kept dipping up handful after handful, until I had gotten about a quart in the left hand pocket.  After each handful I rubbed my hand off on the back of my shirt and"]]]
