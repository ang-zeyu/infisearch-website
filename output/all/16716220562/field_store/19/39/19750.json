The ghastly records of that fratricidal strife sadly support the prediction concerning \"the death and misery of many souls.\" It is well known that slaves deserted the South and were marshalled in the armies of the North, and that the Confederate States solicited aid of Great Britain. While no open alliance between the Southern States and England was effected, the British government gave indirect assistance and substantial encouragement to the South, and this in such a way as to produce serious international complications. Vessels were built and equipped at British ports in the interests of the Confederacy; and the results of this violation of the laws of neutrality cost Great Britain the sum of fifteen and a half millions of dollars, which sum was awarded the United States at the Geneva arbitration in settlement of the \"Alabama claims.\" The Confederacy appointed commissioners to Great Britain and France; these appointees were forcibly taken by United States officers from the British steamer on which they had embarked. This act, which the United States government had to admit as overt, threatened for a time to precipitate a war between this nation and Great Britain.    [43] See Pearl of Great Price, British edition of 1851, and   Millennial Star, Vol. XLIX, p. 396. The prophecy is now a part of   the Doctrine and Covenants, see section lxxxvii.  =34.= The revelation cited, as given through Joseph Smith, contained other predictions, some of which are yet awaiting fulfilment.[44] The evidence presented is sufficient to prove that Joseph Smith is prominent among men by reason of his instrumentality in fulfilling prophecies uttered by the Lord's representatives in former times, and that his own claim to the rank of prophet is abundantly vindicated. But the endowment of prophecy so richly bestowed upon this Elias of the last days, and so freely yet unerringly exercised by him, is but one of the many spiritual gifts by which he, in common with a host of others who have received the priesthood from him, was distinguished. The scriptures declare that certain signs shall attend the Church of Christ, among them the gifts of tongues, healing, immunity from threatening death, and the power to control evil spirits.[45] The exercise of these powers, resulting in what are ordinarily termed miracles, is by no means an infallible proof of divine authority; for many true prophets have wrought no such wonders, and men have been known to work miracles at the instigation of evil spirits.[46] Nevertheless, the possession of the power implied by the working of miracles is an essential characteristic of the Church; and when such acts are wrought in the accomplishment of holy purposes, they serve as confirmatory evidence of divine authority. Therefore we may expect to find, as find we do, in the ministry of Joseph Smith and in that of the Church in general, the attested record of miracles, comprising manifestations of all the promised gifts of the Spirit. This subject will be further considered on another occasion.[47]    [44] See Doc. and Cov. lxxxvii, 5-7.    [45] Mark xvi, 16-18; Luke x, 19, etc.; Doc. and Cov. lxxxiv,   65-72.

The Doctrines Taught by Joseph Smith= and by the Church to-day are true and scriptural. To sustain this statement we must examine the principal teachings of the Church in separate order. The Articles of Faith furnish us a convenient summary of many of the doctrines pertaining to the latter-day work; and these we will proceed to study in the course of the lectures that are to follow.   NOTES.       =1. The \"Articles of Faith\"= date from March 1, 1841. They      constitute a portion of a letter from the Prophet Joseph Smith to      a Mr. Wentworth, of Chicago. The \"Articles\" were published in the      History of Joseph Smith: (See _Millennial Star_, vol. XIX, p.      120; also _Times and Seasons_, vol. III, p. 709.) As stated      elsewhere, the Articles have been formally adopted by the Church      as an authorized summary of its principal doctrines.       =2. Joseph Smith's Early Persecution.=--The Prophet wrote as      follows concerning the persecution of his boyhood days, which      dated from the time of his first mention of his vision of the      Father and the Son:--\"It has often caused me serious reflection,      both then and since, how very strange it was that an obscure boy,      a little over fourteen years of age, and one too who was doomed      to the necessity of obtaining a scanty maintenance by his daily      labor, should be thought a character of sufficient importance to      attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects      of the day, so as to create in them a spirit of the hottest      persecution and reviling. But strange or not, so it was, and was      often cause of great sorrow to myself. However, it was,      nevertheless, a fact that I had had a vision. I have thought      since that I felt much like Paul when he made his defense before      King Agrippa, and related the account of the vision he had when      he saw a light and heard a voice, but still there were but a few      who believed him; some said he was dishonest, others said he was      mad, and he was ridiculed and reviled; but all this did not      destroy the reality of his vision. He had seen a vision, he knew      he had, and all the persecution under heaven could not make it      otherwise; ... So it was with me; I had actually seen a light,      and in the midst of that light I saw two personages, and they did      in reality speak unto me, or one of them did; and though I was      hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it      was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and      speaking all manner of evil against me, falsely, for so saying, I      was led to say in my heart, Why persecute for telling the truth?      I had actually seen a vision, and who am I that I can withstand      God?\" _Pearl of Great Price_:--Extracts from the History of      Joseph Smith: 23-25.       =3. Tribute to Joseph Smith.=--While few people outside the      Church have had much to say in commendation of this modern      prophet, it is interesting to note that there are some honorable      exceptions to the rule. Josiah Quincy, a prominent American, made      the acquaintance of Joseph Smith a short time before the latter's      martyrdom; and after the tragic event he wrote: \"It is by no      means improbable that some future text-book, for the use of      generations yet unborn, will contain a question something like      this: What historical American of the nineteenth century has      exerted the most powerful influence upon the destinies of his      countrymen? And it is by no means impossible that the answer to      that interrogatory may be thus written: _Joseph Smith, the Mormon      Prophet_. And the reply, absurd as it doubtless seems to most men      now, may be an obvious commonplace to their descendants. History      deals in surprises and paradoxes quite as startling as this. The      man who establishes a religion in this age of free debate, who      was and is today accepted by hundreds of thousands as a direct      emissary from the Most High,--such a rare human being is not to      be disposed of by pelting his memory with unsavory epithets....      The most vital questions Americans are asking each other today      have to do with this man and what he has left us.... Burning      questions they are, which must give a prominent place in the      history of the country to that sturdy self-asserter whom I      visited at Nauvoo, Joseph Smith, claiming to be an inspired      teacher, faced adversity, such as few men have been called to      meet, enjoyed a brief season of prosperity, such as few men have      ever attained, and, finally, forty-three days after I saw him,      went cheerfully to a martyr's death. When he surrendered his      person to Governor Ford, in order to prevent the shedding of      blood, the Prophet had a presentiment of what was before him. 'I      am going like a lamb to the slaughter,' he is reported to have      said, 'but I am as calm as a summer's morning. I have a      conscience void of offence, and shall die innocent.'\" _Figures of      the Past_ by Josiah Quincy, p. 376.       =4. The Seal of Martyrdom.=--\"The highest evidence of sincerity      that a man can give his fellow-men,--the highest proof that he      has spoken the truth in any given case--is that he perseveres in      it unto death, and seals his testimony with his blood.... So      important did such a testimony become in the estimation of Paul,      that he said 'Where a testament is there must also of necessity      be the death of the testator. For a testament is of force after      men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the      testator liveth.' (Heb. ix, 16-17.) In the light of this      principle, and when the importance of the great testimony which      he bore to the world is taken into account, it is not to be      wondered at that Joseph Smith was called upon to affix the broad      seal of martyrdom to his life's work. Something of      incompleteness in his work would likely have been complained of      had this been lacking; but now, not so; his character of prophet      was rounded out to complete fulness by his falling a martyr under      the murderous fire of a mob at Carthage in the State of      Illinois.\"--Elder B.

Wm.      Crowell; No. 1; \"_A New Witness for God_,\" by Elder B. H.      Roberts.       =6. Joseph Smith's Descent.=--\"Joseph Smith was of humble birth.      His parents and their progenitors were toilers, but their      characters were godly and their names unstained. Near the middle      of the seventeenth century Robert Smith, a sturdy yeoman of      England, emigrated to the New World, the land of promise. With      his wife, Mary, he settled in Essex, Massachusetts. The numerous      descendants of these worthy people intermarried with many of the      staunchest and most industrious families of New England. Samuel,      the son of Robert and Mary, born January 26th, 1666, wedded      Rebecca Curtis, January 25th, 1707. Their son, the second Samuel,      was born January 26th, 1714; he married Priscilla Gould, and was      the father of Asael, born March 1st, 1744. Asael Smith took to      wife Mary Duty, and their son Joseph was born July 12th, 1771. On      the 24th of January, 1796, Joseph married Lucy Mack at Tunbridge      in the State of Vermont. She was born July 8th, 1776, and was the      daughter of Solomon and Lydia Mack, and was the granddaughter of      Ebenezer Mack.\"--_The Life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet_, by      George Q. Cannon; Chapter I. Joseph the Prophet was the third son      and fourth child of Joseph and Lucy (Mack) Smith; he was born at      Sharon, Vermont, December 23d, 1805.       =7. The Standard Works of the Church.=--The Bible and the Book of      Mormon--the first two of the standard works of the Church--are to      receive attention in later lectures (see pp. 240-307). The      Doctrine and Covenants is a compilation of modern revelations as      given to the Church in the present dispensation. The _Pearl of      Great Price_ comprises the visions and writings of Moses as      revealed to Joseph Smith, the Book of Abraham--a translation by      Joseph Smith from certain ancient papyri--and some of the      writings of Joseph Smith.       =8. History of the Restored Church.=--Further information      regarding the life work of Joseph Smith, and the growth of the      Church of Jesus Christ as restored to earth through his      instrumentality, may be found in the \"History of the Church of      Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\" Salt Lake City, Utah. For a      brief synopsis of Church history see \"The Story of Mormonism,\" by      James E. Talmage, Liverpool, 1907; Salt Lake City, 1910.       =9. Restoration of the Gospel.=--Plainly the vision-prophecy of      John (Rev. xiv, 6, 7), relating to the restoration of the gospel      to earth, could not refer to the gospel record preserved in the      Holy Bible, for that record has remained in the possession of      mankind. As stated in our text (page 14) a partial fulfilment is      found in the visitation of Moroni and the restoration of the Book      of Mormon, which is to us of modern times a new scripture, and      one containing a fuller record of \"the everlasting gospel.\"      However, a record of the gospel is not the gospel itself.      Authority to administer in the saving ordinances of the gospel is      essential to the effective preaching and administration thereof;      this was restored through John the Baptist, who brought the      Aaronic Priesthood, and through Peter, James, and John who      brought again to earth the Melchizedek Priesthood (see pp. 193,      194 herein). For commentary on Rev. xiv, 6, 7, see \"The Great      Apostasy,\" p. 168.     LECTURE II.  GOD AND THE GODHEAD.       =Article 1.=--We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His      Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.   =1. The Existence of God.=--Since faith in God constitutes the foundation of religious belief and practice, and inasmuch as a knowledge of the attributes and character of Deity is essential to an intelligent exercise of faith in Him, this subject claims first place in our study of the doctrines of the Church.  =2.= The existence of God is scarcely a question of rational dispute; nor does it call for proof by the feeble demonstrations of man's logic, for the fact is admitted by the human family practically without question, and the consciousness of subjection to a supreme power is an inborn quality of mankind. The early scriptures are in no sense devoted to a primary demonstration of God's existence, nor to attacks on the sophistries of atheism; and from this fact we may infer that the errors of doubt developed in some period later than the first. The universal assent of mankind to the existence of God is at least a strongly corroborative truth. There is a filial passion within human nature which flames toward heaven. Every nation, every tribe, every individual, yearns for some object of reverence. It is natural for man to worship; his soul is unsatisfied till it finds a deity. When men through transgression first fell into darkness concerning the true and living God, they established for themselves other deities; and so arose the abominations of idolatry. And yet, terrible as these practices are, even the most revolting idolatries testify to the existence of a God by declaring man's hereditary passion for worship. Plutarch has wisely remarked of ancient conditions: \"If you search the world, you may find cities without walls, without letters, without kings, without money; but no one ever saw a city without a deity, without a temple, or without prayers.\" This general assent to a belief in the existence of Deity is testimony of a high order; and in this connection the words of Aristotle may be applied:--\"What seems true to some wise men is somewhat probable; what seems true to most or all wise men is very probable; what most men, both wise and unwise, assent to, still more resembles truth; but what men generally consent in has the highest probability, and approaches so near to demonstrated truth, that it may pass for ridiculous arrogance and self-conceitedness, or for intolerable obstinacy and perverseness, to decry it.\"[48]    [48] See Notes 1, 2, and 3.  =3.= The multiplicity of evidence upon which mankind rest their conviction regarding the existence of a Supreme Being, may be classified, for convenience of consideration, under the three following heads:  I. The evidence of history and tradition.  II. The evidence furnished by the exercise of human reason.  III. The conclusive evidence of direct revelation from God Himself.  =4. I. History and Tradition.=--History as written by man, and tradition as transmitted from generation to generation prior to the date of any written record now extant, give evidence of the actuality of Deity, and of close and personal dealings between God and man in the first epochs of human existence. One of the most ancient records known, the Bible, names God as the Creator of all things,[49] and moreover, declares that He revealed Himself to our first earthly parents and to many other holy personages in the early days of the world. Adam and Eve heard His voice[50] in the Garden, and even after their transgression they continued to call upon God and to sacrifice to Him. It is plain, therefore, that they carried with them from the Garden a knowledge of God. After their expulsion they heard \"the voice of the Lord from the way toward the Garden of Eden,\" though they saw Him not; and He gave unto them commandments, which they obeyed. Then came to Adam an angelic messenger, and the Holy Ghost inspired the man and bare record of the Father and the Son.[51]    [49] Genesis i; see also Pearl of Great Price, Moses ii, 1.    [50] Genesis iii, 8; and Pearl of Great Price, Moses iv, 14.    [51] Pearl of Great Price, Moses v, 6-9.  =5.= Cain and Abel learned of God from the teachings of their parents, as well as from personal ministrations. After the acceptance of Abel's offering, and the rejection of that of Cain followed by Cain's terrible crime of fratricide, the Lord talked with Cain, and Cain answered the Lord.[52] Cain must, therefore, have taken a personal knowledge of God from Eden into the land where he went to dwell.[53] Adam lived to be nine hundred and thirty years old and many children were born unto him. Them he instructed in the fear of God, and many of them received direct ministrations. Of Adam's descendants, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, and Lamech the father of Noah, each representing a distinct generation, were all living during Adam's lifetime. Noah was born but a hundred and twenty-six years after the time of Adam's death, and moreover lived nearly six hundred years with his father Lamech, by whom he was doubtless instructed in the traditions concerning God's personal manifestations, which Lamech had learned from the lips of Adam. Through the medium of Noah and his family, a knowledge of God by direct tradition was carried beyond the flood; and Noah held direct communication with God,[54] and lived to instruct ten generations of his descendants. Then followed Abraham, who also enjoyed direct communion with the Creator,[55] and after him Isaac, and Jacob or Israel, among whose descendants the Lord wrought such wonders through the instrumentality of Moses. Thus, had there been no written records, tradition would have preserved and transmitted a knowledge of God.    [52] Genesis iv, 9-16; Pearl of Great Price, Moses v, 22, 34-40.    [53] Genesis iv, 16; Pearl of Great Price, Moses v, 41.    [54] Genesis vi, 13, and succeeding chapter.    [55] Genesis xii, and succeeding chapters.  =6.= But even if the accounts of the earliest of man's personal communion with God had become dimmed with time, and therefore weakened in effect, they could but give place to other traditions founded on later manifestations of the Divine personality.
