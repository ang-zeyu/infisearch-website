They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and beheld the face of Edward Hyde. He was dressed in clothes far too large for him, clothes of the doctor’s bigness; the cords of his face still moved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone; and by the crushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung upon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a self-destroyer.  “We have come too late,” he said sternly, “whether to save or punish. Hyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the body of your master.”  The far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre, which filled almost the whole ground story and was lighted from above, and by the cabinet, which formed an upper story at one end and looked upon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the by-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a spacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell from their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was Jekyll’s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance. Nowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive.  Poole stamped on the flags of the corridor. “He must be buried here,” he said, hearkening to the sound.  “Or he may have fled,” said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door in the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they found the key, already stained with rust.  “This does not look like use,” observed the lawyer.  “Use!” echoed Poole. “Do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if a man had stamped on it.”  “Ay,” continued Utterson, “and the fractures, too, are rusty.” The two men looked at each other with a scare. “This is beyond me, Poole,” said the lawyer. “Let us go back to the cabinet.”  They mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional awe-struck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine the contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had been prevented.  “That is the same drug that I was always bringing him,” said Poole; and even as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over.  This brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn cosily up, and the tea-things stood ready to the sitter’s elbow, the very sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one lay beside the tea-things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy of a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great esteem, annotated, in his own hand, with startling blasphemies.  Next, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came to the cheval glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary horror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow playing on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along the glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful countenances stooping to look in.  “This glass have seen some strange things, sir,” whispered Poole.  “And surely none stranger than itself,” echoed the lawyer in the same tones. “For what did Jekyll”—he caught himself up at the word with a start, and then conquering the weakness—“what could Jekyll want with it?” he said.  “You may say that!” said Poole. Next they turned to the business-table. On the desk among the neat array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the doctor’s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and several enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case of disappearance; but, in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the lawyer, with indescribable amazement, read the name of Gabriel John Utterson. He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.  “My head goes round,” he said. “He has been all these days in possession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see himself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.”  He caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor’s hand and dated at the top. “O Poole!” the lawyer cried, “he was alive and here this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space, he must be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how? and in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? Oh, we must be careful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire catastrophe.”  “Why don’t you read it, sir?” asked Poole.  “Because I fear,” replied the lawyer solemnly. “God grant I have no cause for it!” And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read as follows:  “My dear Utterson,—When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have disappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to foresee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless situation tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and first read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your hands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of   “Your unworthy and unhappy friend, “HENRY JEKYLL.”   “There was a third enclosure?” asked Utterson.  “Here, sir,” said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packet sealed in several places.  The lawyer put it in his pocket. “I would say nothing of this paper. If your master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. It is now ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall be back before midnight, when we shall send for the police.”  They went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and Utterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the hall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which this mystery was now to be explained.     DR. LANYON’S NARRATIVE   On the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening delivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague and old school-companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good deal surprised by this; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had seen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could imagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of registration. The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the letter ran:  “10th December, 18——   “Dear Lanyon,—You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at least on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day when, if you had said to me, ‘Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason, depend upon you,’ I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you. Lanyon, my life, my honour my reason, are all at your mercy; if you fail me to-night I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface, that I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judge for yourself.  “I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night—ay, even if you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless your carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in your hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, my butler, has his orders; you will find, him waiting your arrival with a locksmith. The door of my cabinet is then to be forced: and you are to go in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand, breaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, _with all its contents as they stand_, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is the same thing) the third from the bottom. In my extreme distress of wind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in error, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a phial and a paper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you to Cavendish Square exactly as it stands.  “That is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should be back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before midnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor foreseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be preferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have to ask you to be alone in your consulting-room, to admit with your own hand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to place in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from my cabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude completely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation, you will have understood that these arrangements are of capital importance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they must appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or the shipwreck of my reason.  “Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart sinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility. Think of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a blackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware that, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away like a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Lanyon, and save  “Your friend, “H. J.   “P. S.

Zeb Returns to the Ranch     To My Readers   It's no use; no use at all.  The children won't let me stop telling tales of the Land of Oz.  I know lots of other stories, and I hope to tell them, some time or another; but just now my loving tyrants won't allow me.  They cry: \"Oz--Oz! more about Oz, Mr. Baum!\" and what can I do but obey their commands?  This is Our Book--mine and the children's.  For they have flooded me with thousands of suggestions in regard to it, and I have honestly tried to adopt as many of these suggestions as could be fitted into one story.  After the wonderful success of \"Ozma of Oz\" it is evident that Dorothy has become a firm fixture in these Oz stories.  The little ones all love Dorothy, and as one of my small friends aptly states: \"It isn't a real Oz story without her.\"  So here she is again, as sweet and gentle and innocent as ever, I hope, and the heroine of another strange adventure.  There were many requests from my little correspondents for \"more about the Wizard.\"  It seems the jolly old fellow made hosts of friends in the first Oz book, in spite of the fact that he frankly acknowledged himself \"a humbug.\"  The children had heard how he mounted into the sky in a balloon and they were all waiting for him to come down again.  So what could I do but tell \"what happened to the Wizard afterward\"?  You will find him in these pages, just the same humbug Wizard as before.  There was one thing the children demanded which I found it impossible to do in this present book: they bade me introduce Toto, Dorothy's little black dog, who has many friends among my readers.  But you will see, when you begin to read the story, that Toto was in Kansas while Dorothy was in California, and so she had to start on her adventure without him.  In this book Dorothy had to take her kitten with her instead of her dog; but in the next Oz book, if I am permitted to write one, I intend to tell a good deal about Toto's further history.  Princess Ozma, whom I love as much as my readers do, is again introduced in this story, and so are several of our old friends of Oz. You will also become acquainted with Jim the Cab-Horse, the Nine Tiny Piglets, and Eureka, the Kitten.  I am sorry the kitten was not as well behaved as she ought to have been; but perhaps she wasn't brought up properly.  Dorothy found her, you see, and who her parents were nobody knows.  I believe, my dears, that I am the proudest story-teller that ever lived.  Many a time tears of pride and joy have stood in my eyes while I read the tender, loving, appealing letters that came to me in almost every mail from my little readers.  To have pleased you, to have interested you, to have won your friendship, and perhaps your love, through my stories, is to my mind as great an achievement as to become President of the United States.  Indeed, I would much rather be your story-teller, under these conditions, than to be the President.  So you have helped me to fulfill my life's ambition, and I am more grateful to you, my dears, than I can express in words.  I try to answer every letter of my young correspondents; yet sometimes there are so many letters that a little time must pass before you get your answer.  But be patient, friends, for the answer will surely come, and by writing to me you more than repay me for the pleasant task of preparing these books.  Besides, I am proud to acknowledge that the books are partly yours, for your suggestions often guide me in telling the stories, and I am sure they would not be half so good without your clever and thoughtful assistance.  L. FRANK BAUM  Coronado, 1908.     1.  The Earthquake   The train from 'Frisco was very late.  It should have arrived at Hugson's Siding at midnight, but it was already five o'clock and the gray dawn was breaking in the east when the little train slowly rumbled up to the open shed that served for the station-house.  As it came to a stop the conductor called out in a loud voice:  \"Hugson's Siding!\"  At once a little girl rose from her seat and walked to the door of the car, carrying a wicker suit-case in one hand and a round bird-cage covered up with newspapers in the other, while a parasol was tucked under her arm.  The conductor helped her off the car and then the engineer started his train again, so that it puffed and groaned and moved slowly away up the track.  The reason he was so late was because all through the night there were times when the solid earth shook and trembled under him, and the engineer was afraid that at any moment the rails might spread apart and an accident happen to his passengers.  So he moved the cars slowly and with caution.  The little girl stood still to watch until the train had disappeared around a curve; then she turned to see where she was.  The shed at Hugson's Siding was bare save for an old wooden bench, and did not look very inviting.  As she peered through the soft gray light not a house of any sort was visible near the station, nor was any person in sight; but after a while the child discovered a horse and buggy standing near a group of trees a short distance away.  She walked toward it and found the horse tied to a tree and standing motionless, with its head hanging down almost to the ground.  It was a big horse, tall and bony, with long legs and large knees and feet.  She could count his ribs easily where they showed through the skin of his body, and his head was long and seemed altogether too big for him, as if it did not fit.  His tail was short and scraggly, and his harness had been broken in many places and fastened together again with cords and bits of wire.  The buggy seemed almost new, for it had a shiny top and side curtains.  Getting around in front, so that she could look inside, the girl saw a boy curled up on the seat, fast asleep.  She set down the bird-cage and poked the boy with her parasol. Presently he woke up, rose to a sitting position and rubbed his eyes briskly.  \"Hello!\" he said, seeing her, \"are you Dorothy Gale?\"  \"Yes,\" she answered, looking gravely at his tousled hair and blinking gray eyes.  \"Have you come to take me to Hugson's Ranch?\"  \"Of course,\" he answered.  \"Train in?\"  \"I couldn't be here if it wasn't,\" she said.  He laughed at that, and his laugh was merry and frank.  Jumping out of the buggy he put Dorothy's suit-case under the seat and her bird-cage on the floor in front.  \"Canary-birds?\" he asked.  \"Oh no; it's just Eureka, my kitten.  I thought that was the best way to carry her.\"  The boy nodded.  \"Eureka's a funny name for a cat,\" he remarked.  \"I named my kitten that because I found it,\" she explained.  \"Uncle Henry says 'Eureka' means 'I have found it.'\"  \"All right; hop in.\"  She climbed into the buggy and he followed her.  Then the boy picked up the reins, shook them, and said \"Gid-dap!\"  The horse did not stir.  Dorothy thought he just wiggled one of his drooping ears, but that was all.  \"Gid-dap!\" called the boy, again.  The horse stood still.  \"Perhaps,\" said Dorothy, \"if you untied him, he would go.\"  The boy laughed cheerfully and jumped out.  \"Guess I'm half asleep yet,\" he said, untying the horse.  \"But Jim knows his business all right--don't you, Jim?\" patting the long nose of the animal.  Then he got into the buggy again and took the reins, and the horse at once backed away from the tree, turned slowly around, and began to trot down the sandy road which was just visible in the dim light.  \"Thought that train would never come,\" observed the boy.  \"I've waited at that station for five hours.\"  \"We had a lot of earthquakes,\" said Dorothy.  \"Didn't you feel the ground shake?\"  \"Yes; but we're used to such things in California,\" he replied.  \"They don't scare us much.\"  \"The conductor said it was the worst quake he ever knew.\"  \"Did he?  Then it must have happened while I was asleep,\" he said thoughtfully.  \"How is Uncle Henry?\" she enquired, after a pause during which the horse continued to trot with long, regular strides.  \"He's pretty well.  He and Uncle Hugson have been having a fine visit.\"  \"Is Mr. Hugson your uncle?\" she asked.  \"Yes.  Uncle Bill Hugson married your Uncle Henry's wife's sister; so we must be second cousins,\" said the boy, in an amused tone.  \"I work for Uncle Bill on his ranch, and he pays me six dollars a month and my board.\"  \"Isn't that a great deal?\" she asked, doubtfully.  \"Why, it's a great deal for Uncle Hugson, but not for me.  I'm a splendid worker.  I work as well as I sleep,\" he added, with a laugh.  \"What is your name?\" said Dorothy, thinking she liked the boy's manner and the cheery tone of his voice.  \"Not a very pretty one,\" he answered, as if a little ashamed.  \"My whole name is Zebediah; but folks just call me 'Zeb.'  You've been to Australia, haven't you?\"  \"Yes; with Uncle Henry,\" she answered.  \"We got to San Francisco a week ago, and Uncle Henry went right on to Hugson's Ranch for a visit while I stayed a few days in the city with some friends we had met.\"  \"How long"]]]
