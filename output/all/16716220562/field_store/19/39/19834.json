The comrades were at last reduced to the humiliation of informing the Officer of the Guard of their tunnel and the condition of their friend, and of asking assistance to release him, which was given.  The great tunneling tool was the indispensable half-canteen.  The inventive genius of our people, stimulated by the war, produced nothing for the comfort and effectiveness of the soldier equal in usefulness to this humble and unrecognized utensil.  It will be remembered that a canteen was composed of two pieces of tin struck up into the shape of saucers, and soldered together at the edges.  After a soldier had been in the field a little while, and thrown away or lost the curious and complicated kitchen furniture he started out with, he found that by melting the halves of his canteen apart, he had a vessel much handier in every way than any he had parted with.  It could be used for anything --to make soup or coffee in, bake bread, brown coffee, stew vegetables, etc., etc.  A sufficient handle was made with a split stick.  When the cooking was done, the handle was thrown away, and the half canteen slipped out of the road into the haversack.  There seemed to be no end of the uses to which this ever-ready disk of blackened sheet iron could be turned.  Several instances are on record where infantry regiments, with no other tools than this, covered themselves on the field with quite respectable rifle pits.  The starting point of a tunnel was always some tent close to the Dead Line, and sufficiently well closed to screen the operations from the sight of the guards near by.  The party engaged in the work organized by giving every man a number to secure the proper apportionment of the labor.  Number One began digging with his half canteen.  After he had worked until tired, he came out, and Number Two took his place, and so on.  The tunnel was simply a round, rat-like burrow, a little larger than a man's body.  The digger lay on his stomach, dug ahead of him, threw the dirt under him, and worked it back with his feet till the man behind him, also lying on his stomach, could catch it and work it back to the next. As the tunnel lengthened the number of men behind each other in this way had to be increased, so that in a tunnel seventy-five feet long there would be from eight to ten men lying one behind the other.  When the dirt was pushed back to the mouth of the tunnel it was taken up in improvised bags, made by tying up the bottoms of pantaloon legs, carried to the Swamp, and emptied.  The work in the tunnel was very exhausting, and the digger had to be relieved every half-hour.  The greatest trouble was to carry the tunnel forward in a straight line. As nearly everybody dug most of the time with the right hand, there was an almost irresistible tendency to make the course veer to the left.  The first tunnel I was connected with was a ludicrous illustration of this. About twenty of us had devoted our nights for over a week to the prolongation of a burrow.  We had not yet reached the Stockade, which astonished us, as measurement with a string showed that we had gone nearly twice the distance necessary for the purpose.  The thing was inexplicable, and we ceased operations to consider the matter.  The next day a man walking by a tent some little distance from the one in which the hole began, was badly startled by the ground giving way under his feet, and his sinking nearly to his waist in a hole.  It was very singular, but after wondering over the matter for some hours, there came a glimmer of suspicion that it might be, in some way, connected with the missing end of our tunnel.  One of us started through on an exploring expedition, and confirmed the suspicions by coming out where the man had broken through.  Our tunnel was shaped like a horse shoe, and the beginning and end were not fifteen feet apart.  After that we practised digging with our left hand, and made certain compensations for the tendency to the sinister side.  Another trouble connected with tunneling was the number of traitors and spies among us.  There were many--principally among the N'Yaarker crowd who were always zealous to betray a tunnel, in order to curry favor with the Rebel officers.  Then, again, the Rebels had numbers of their own men in the pen at night, as spies.  It was hardly even necessary to dress these in our uniform, because a great many of our own men came into the prison in Rebel clothes, having been compelled to trade garments with their captors.  One day in May, quite an excitement was raised by the detection of one of these \"tunnel traitors\" in such a way as left no doubt of his guilt. At first everybody was in favor of killing him, and they actually started to beat him to death.  This was arrested by a proposition to \"have Captain Jack tattoo him,\" and the suggestion was immediately acted upon.  \"Captain Jack\" was a sailor who had been with us in the Pemberton building at Richmond.  He was a very skilful tattoo artist, but, I am sure, could make the process nastier than any other that I ever saw attempt it.  He chewed tobacco enormously.  After pricking away for a few minutes at the design on the arm or some portion of the body, he would deluge it with a flood of tobacco spit, which, he claimed, acted as a kind of mordant.  Piping this off with a filthy rag, he would study the effect for an instant, and then go ahead with another series of prickings and tobacco juice drenchings.  The tunnel-traitor was taken to Captain Jack.  That worthy decided to brand him with a great \"T,\" the top part to extend across his forehead and the stem to run down his nose.  Captain Jack got his tattooing kit ready, and the fellow was thrown upon the ground and held there.  The Captain took his head between his legs, and began operations.  After an instant's work with the needles, he opened his mouth, and filled the wretch's face and eyes full of the disgusting saliva.  The crowd round about yelled with delight at this new process.  For an hour, that was doubtless an eternity to the rascal undergoing branding, Captain Jack continued his alternate pickings and drenchings.  At the end of that time the traitor's face was disfigured with a hideous mark that he would bear to his grave.  We learned afterwards that he was not one of our men, but a Rebel spy.  This added much to our satisfaction with the manner of his treatment.  He disappeared shortly after the operation was finished, being, I suppose, taken outside.  I hardly think Captain Jack would be pleased to meet him again.     CHAPTER XXVII.  THE HOUNDS, AND THE DIFFICULTIES THEY PUT IN THE WAY OF ESCAPE --THE WHOLE SOUTH PATROLLED BY THEM.  Those who succeeded, one way or another, in passing the Stockade limits, found still more difficulties lying between them and freedom than would discourage ordinarily resolute men.  The first was to get away from the immediate vicinity of the prison.  All around were Rebel patrols, pickets and guards, watching every avenue of egress.  Several packs of hounds formed efficient coadjutors of these, and were more dreaded by possible \"escapes,\" than any other means at the command of our jailors.  Guards and patrols could be evaded, or circumvented, but the hounds could not. Nearly every man brought back from a futile attempt at escape told the same story: he had been able to escape the human Rebels, but not their canine colleagues.  Three of our detachment--members of the Twentieth Indiana--had an experience of this kind that will serve to illustrate hundreds of others.  They had been taken outside to do some work upon the cook-house that was being built.  A guard was sent with the three a little distance into the woods to get a piece of timber.  The boys sauntered, along carelessly with the guard, and managed to get pretty near him.  As soon as they were fairly out of sight of the rest, the strongest of them--Tom Williams--snatched the Rebel's gun away from him, and the other two springing upon him as swift as wild cats, throttled him, so that he could not give the alarm.  Still keeping a hand on his throat, they led him off some distance, and tied him to a sapling with strings made by tearing up one of their blouses.  He was also securely gagged, and the boys, bidding him a hasty, but not specially tender, farewell, struck out, as they fondly hoped, for freedom.  It was not long until they were missed, and the parties sent in search found and released the guard, who gave all the information he possessed as to what had become of his charges.  All the packs of hounds, the squads of cavalry, and the foot patrols were sent out to scour the adjacent country. The Yankees kept in the swamps and creeks, and no trace of them was found that afternoon or evening.  By this time they were ten or fifteen miles away, and thought that they could safely leave the creeks for better walking on the solid ground.  They had gone but a few miles, when the pack of hounds Captain Wirz was with took their trail, and came after them in full cry.  The boys tried to ran, but, exhausted as they were, they could make no headway.  Two of them were soon caught, but Tom Williams, who was so desperate that he preferred death to recapture, jumped into a mill-pond near by.  When he came up, it was in a lot of saw logs and drift wood that hid him from being seen from the shore. The dogs stopped at the shore, and bayed after the disappearing prey. The Rebels with them, who had seen Tom spring in, came up and made a pretty thorough search for him.  As they did not think to probe around the drift wood this was unsuccessful, and they came to the conclusion that Tom had been drowned.  Wirz marched the other two back and, for a wonder, did not punish them, probably because he was so rejoiced at his success in capturing them.  He was beaming with delight when he returned them to our squad, and said, with a chuckle:  \"Brisoners, I pring you pack two of dem tam Yankees wat"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4258"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons â€” Volume 2 (#4)"],["body","away yesterday, unt I run de oder raskal into a mill-pont and trowntet him.\"  What was our astonishment, about three weeks later, to see Tom, fat and healthy, and dressed in a full suit of butternut, come stalking into the pen.  He had nearly reached the mountains, when a pack of hounds, patrolling for deserters or negros, took his trail, where he had crossed the road from one field to another, and speedily ran him down.  He had been put in a little country jail, and well fed till an opportunity occurred to send him back.  This patrolling for negros and deserters was another of the great obstacles to a successful passage through the country.  The rebels had put, every able-bodied white man in the ranks, and were bending every energy to keep him there.  The whole country was carefully policed by Provost Marshals to bring out those who were shirking military duty, or had deserted their colors, and to check any movement by the negros.  One could not go anywhere without a pass, as every road was continually watched by men and hounds.  It was the policy of our men, when escaping, to avoid roads as much as possible by traveling through the woods and fields.  From what I saw of the hounds, and what I could learn from others, I believe that each pack was made up of two bloodhounds and from twenty-five to fifty other dogs.  The bloodhounds were debased descendants of the strong and fierce hounds imported from Cuba--many of them by the United States Government--for hunting Indians, during the Seminole war.  The other dogs were the mongrels that are found in such plentifulness about every Southern house--increasing, as a rule, in numbers as the inhabitant of the house is lower down and poorer.  They are like wolves, sneaking and cowardly when alone, fierce and bold when in packs.  Each pack was managed by a well-armed man, who rode a mule; and carried, slung over his shoulders by a cord, a cow horn, scraped very thin, with which he controlled the band by signals.  What always puzzled me much was why the hounds took only Yankee trails, in the vicinity of the prison.  There was about the Stockade from six thousand to ten thousand Rebels and negros, including guards, officers, servants, workmen, etc.  These were, of course, continually in motion and must have daily made trails leading in every direction.  It was the custom of the Rebels to send a pack of hounds around the prison every morning, to examine if any Yankees had escaped during the night.  It was believed that they rarely failed to find a prisoner's tracks, and still more rarely ran off upon a Rebel's.  If those outside the Stockade had been confined to certain path and roads we could have understood this, but, as I understand, they were not.  It was part of the interest of the day, for us, to watch the packs go yelping around the pen searching for tracks.  We got information in this way whether any tunnel had been successfully opened during the night.  The use of hounds furnished us a crushing reply to the ever recurring Rebel question:  \"Why are you-uns puttin' niggers in the field to fight we-uns for?\"  The questioner was always silenced by the return interrogatory:  \"Is that as bad as running white men down with blood hounds?\"     CHAPTER XXVIII.  MAY--INFLUX OF NEW PRISONERS--DISPARITY IN NUMBERS BETWEEN THE EASTERN AND WESTERN ARMIES--TERRIBLE CROWDING--SLAUGHTER OF MEN AT THE CREEK.  In May the long gathering storm of war burst with angry violence all along the line held by the contending armies.  The campaign began which was to terminate eleven months later in the obliteration of the Southern Confederacy.  May 1, Sigel moved up the Shenandoah Valley with thirty thousand men; May 3, Butler began his blundering movement against Petersburg; May 3, the Army of the Potomac left Culpeper, and on the 5th began its deadly grapple with Lee, in the Wilderness; May 6, Sherman moved from Chattanooga, and engaged Joe Johnston at Rocky Face Ridge and Tunnel Hill.  Each of these columns lost heavily in prisoners.  It could not be otherwise; it was a consequence of the aggressive movements.  An army acting offensively usually suffers more from capture than one on the defensive.  Our armies were penetrating the enemy's country in close proximity to a determined and vigilant foe.  Every scout, every skirmish line, every picket, every foraging party ran the risk of falling into a Rebel trap.  This was in addition to the risk of capture in action.  The bulk of the prisoners were taken from the Army of the Potomac.  For this there were two reasons: First, that there were many more men in that Army than in any other; and second, that the entanglement in the dense thickets and shrubbery of the Wilderness enabled both sides to capture great numbers of the other's men.  Grant lost in prisoners from May 5 to May 31, seven thousand four hundred and fifty; he probably captured two-thirds of that number from the Johnnies.  Wirz's headquarters were established in a large log house which had been built in the fort a little distant from the southeast corner of the prison.  Every day--and sometimes twice or thrice a day--we would see great squads of prisoners marched up to these headquarters, where they would be searched, their names entered upon the prison records, by clerks (detailed prisoners; few Rebels had the requisite clerical skill) and then be marched into the prison.  As they entered, the Rebel guards would stand to arms.  The infantry would be in line of battle, the cavalry mounted, and the artillerymen standing by their guns, ready to open at the instant with grape and canister.  The disparity between the number coming in from the Army of the Potomac and Western armies was so great, that we Westerners began to take some advantage of it.  If we saw a squad of one hundred and fifty or thereabouts at the headquarters, we felt pretty certain they were from Sherman, and gathered to meet them, and learn the news from our friends. If there were from five hundred to two thousand we knew they were from the Army of the Potomac, and there were none of our comrades among them. There were three exceptions to this rule while we were in Andersonville. The first was in June, when the drunken and incompetent Sturgis (now Colonel of the Seventh United States Cavalry) shamefully sacrificed a superb division at Guntown, Miss.  The next was after Hood made his desperate attack on Sherman, on the 22d of July, and the third was when Stoneman was captured at Macon.  At each of these times about two thousand prisoners were brought in.  By the end of May there were eighteen thousand four hundred and fifty-four prisoners in the Stockade.  Before the reader dismisses this statement from his mind let him reflect how great a number this is. It is more active, able-bodied young men than there are in any of our leading Cities, save New York and Philadelphia.  It is more than the average population of an Ohio County.  It is four times as many troops as Taylor won the victory of Buena Vista with, and about twice as many as Scott went into battle with at any time in his march to the City of Mexico.  These eighteen thousand four hundred and fifty-four men were cooped up on less than thirteen acres of ground, making about fifteen hundred to the acre.  No room could be given up for streets, or for the usual arrangements of a camp, and most kinds of exercise were wholly precluded. The men crowded together like pigs nesting in the woods on cold nights. The ground, despite all our efforts, became indescribably filthy, and this condition grew rapidly worse as the season advanced and the sun's rays gained fervency.  As it is impossible to describe this adequately, I must again ask the reader to assist with a few comparisons.  He has an idea of how much filth is produced, on an ordinary City lot, in a week, by its occupation by a family say of six persons.  Now let him imagine what would be the result if that lot, instead of having upon it six persons, with every appliance for keeping themselves clean, and for removing and concealing filth, was the home of one hundred and eight men, with none of these appliances.  That he may figure out these proportions for himself, I will repeat some of the elements of the problem: We will say that an average City lot is thirty feet front by one hundred deep.  This is more front than most of them have, but we will be liberal.  This gives us a surface of three thousand square feet.  An acre contains forty-three thousand five hundred and sixty square feet.  Upon thirteen of these acres, we had eighteen thousand four hundred and fifty-four men.  After he has found the number of square feet that each man had for sleeping apartment, dining room, kitchen, exercise grounds and outhouses, and decided that nobody could live for any length of time in such contracted space, I will tell him that a few weeks later double that many men were crowded upon that space that over thirty-five thousand were packed upon those twelve and a-half or thirteen acres.  But I will not anticipate.  With the warm weather the condition of the swamp in the center of the prison became simply horrible.  We hear so much now-a-days of blood poisoning from the effluvia of sinks and sewers, that reading it, I wonder how a man inside the Stockade, and into whose nostrils came a breath of that noisomeness, escaped being carried off by a malignant typhus.  In the slimy ooze were billions of white maggots. They would crawl out by thousands on the warm sand, and, lying there a few minutes, sprout a wing or a pair of them.  With these they would essay a clumsy flight, ending by dropping down upon some exposed portion of a man's body, and stinging him like a gad-fly.  Still worse, they would drop into what he was cooking, and the utmost care could not prevent a mess of food from being contaminated with them.  All the water that we had to use was that in the creek which flowed through this seething mass of corruption, and"]]]
