INTRODUCTION.  The fifth part of a century almost has sped with the flight of time since the outbreak of the Slaveholder's Rebellion against the United States. The young men of to-day were then babes in their cradles, or, if more than that, too young to be appalled by the terror of the times.  Those now graduating from our schools of learning to be teachers of youth and leaders of public thought, if they are ever prepared to teach the history of the war for the Union so as to render adequate honor to its martyrs and heroes, and at the same time impress the obvious moral to be drawn from it, must derive their knowledge from authors who can each one say of the thrilling story he is spared to tell: \"All of which I saw, and part of which I was.\"  The writer is honored with the privilege of introducing to the reader a volume written by an author who was an actor and a sufferer in the scenes he has so vividly and faithfully described, and sent forth to the public by a publisher whose literary contributions in support of the loyal cause entitle him to the highest appreciation.  Both author and publisher have had an honorable and efficient part in the great struggle, and are therefore worthy to hand down to the future a record of the perils encountered and the sufferings endured by patriotic soldiers in the prisons of the enemy.  The publisher, at the beginning of the war, entered, with zeal and ardor upon the work of raising a company of men, intending to lead them to the field.  Prevented from carrying out this design, his energies were directed to a more effective service.  His famous \"Nasby Letters\" exposed the absurd and sophistical argumentations of rebels and their sympathisers, in such broad, attractive and admirable burlesque, as to direct against them the \"loud, long laughter of a world!\"  The unique and telling satire of these papers became a power and inspiration to our armies in the field and to their anxious friends at home, more than equal to the might of whole battalions poured in upon the enemy.  An athlete in logic may lay an error writhing at his feet, and after all it may recover to do great mischief.  But the sharp wit of the humorist drives it before the world's derision into shame and everlasting contempt.  These letters were read and shouted over gleefully at every camp-fire in the Union Army, and eagerly devoured by crowds of listeners when mails were opened at country post-offices.  Other humorists were content when they simply amused the reader, but \"Nasby's\" jests were arguments--they had a meaningthey were suggested by the necessities and emergencies of the Nation's peril, and written to support, with all earnestness, a most sacred cause.  The author, when very young, engaged in journalistic work, until the drum of the recruiting officer called him to join the ranks of his country's defenders.  As the reader is told, he was made a prisoner.  He took with him into the terrible prison enclosure not only a brave, vigorous, youthful spirit, but invaluable habits of mind and thought for storing up the incidents and experiences of his prison life.  As a journalist he had acquired the habit of noticing and memorizing every striking or thrilling incident, and the experiences of his prison life were adapted to enstamp themselves indelibly on both feeling and memory.  He speaks from personal experience and from the stand-paint of tender and complete sympathy with those of his comrades who suffered more than he did himself.  Of his qualifications, the writer of these introductory words need not speak. The sketches themselves testify to his ability with such force that no commendation is required.  This work is needed.  A generation is arising who do not know what the preservation of our free government cost in blood and suffering.  Even the men of the passing generation begin to be forgetful, if we may judge from the recklessness or carelessness of their political action.  The soldier is not always remembered nor honored as he should be.  But, what to the future of the great Republic is more important, there is great danger of our people under-estimating the bitter animus and terrible malignity to the Union and its defenders cherished by those who made war upon it.  This is a point we can not afford to be mistaken about.  And yet, right at this point this volume will meet its severest criticism, and at this point its testimony is most vital and necessary.  Many will be slow to believe all that is here told most truthfully of the tyranny and cruelty of the captors of our brave boys in blue.  There are no parallels to the cruelties and malignities here described in Northern society.  The system of slavery, maintained for over two hundred years at the South, had performed a most perverting, morally desolating, and we might say, demonizing work on the dominant race, which people bred under our free civilization can not at once understand, nor scarcely believe when it is declared unto them.  This reluctance to believe unwelcome truths has been the snare of our national life.  We have not been willing to believe how hardened, despotic, and cruel the wielders of irresponsible power may become.  When the anti-slavery reformers of thirty years ago set forth the cruelties of the slave system, they were met with a storm of indignant denial, villification and rebuke.  When Theodore D. Weld issued his \"Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses,\" to the cruelty of slavery, he introduced it with a few words, pregnant with sound philosophy, which can be applied to the work now introduced, and may help the reader better to accept and appreciate its statements.  Mr. Weld said:  \"Suppose I should seize you, rob you of your liberty, drive you into the field, and make you work without pay as long as you lived.  Would that be justice?  Would it be kindness?  Or would it be monstrous injustice and cruelty?  Now, is the man who robs you every day too tender-hearted ever to cuff or kick you?  He can empty your pockets without remorse, but if your stomach is empty, it cuts him to the quick.  He can make you work a life-time without pay, but loves you too well to let you go hungry. He fleeces you of your rights with a relish, but is shocked if you work bare-headed in summer, or without warm stockings in winter.  He can make you go without your liberty, but never without a shirt.  He can crush in you all hope of bettering your condition by vowing that you shall die his slave, but though he can thus cruelly torture your feelings, he will never lacerate your back--he can break your heart, but is very tender of your skin.  He can strip you of all protection of law, and all comfort in religion, and thus expose you to all outrages, but if you are exposed to the weather, half-clad and half-sheltered, how yearn his tender bowels! What! talk of a man treating you well while robbing you of all you get, and as fast as you get it?  And robbing you of yourself, too, your hands and feet, your muscles, limbs and senses, your body and mind, your liberty and earnings, your free speech and rights of conscience, your right to acquire knowledge, property and reputation, and yet you are content to believe without question that men who do all this by their slaves have soft hearts oozing out so lovingly toward their human chattles that they always keep them well housed and well clad, never push them too hard in the field, never make their dear backs smart, nor let their dear stomachs get empty!\"  In like manner we may ask, are not the cruelties and oppressions described in the following pages what we should legitimately expect from men who, all their lives, have used whip and thumb-screw, shot-gun and bloodhound, to keep human beings subservient to their will?  Are we to expect nothing but chivalric tenderness and compassion from men who made war on a tolerant government to make more secure their barbaric system of oppression?  These things are written because they are true.  Duty to the brave dead, to the heroic living, who have endured the pangs of a hundred deaths for their country's sake; duty to the government which depends on the wisdom and constancy of its good citizens for its support and perpetuity, calls for this \"round, unvarnished tale\" of suffering endured for freedom's sake.  The publisher of this work urged his friend and associate in journalism to write and send forth these sketches because the times demanded just such an expose of the inner hell of the Southern prisons.  The tender mercies of oppressors are cruel.  We must accept the truth and act in view of it.  Acting wisely on the warnings of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4257"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons — Volume 1 (#1)"],["body",", we shall be able to prevent treason, with all its fearful concomitants, from being again the scourge and terror of our beloved land.  ROBERT McCUNE.       AUTHOR'S PREFACE  Fifteen months ago--and one month before it was begun--I had no more idea of writing this book than I have now of taking up my residence in China.  While I have always been deeply impressed with the idea that the public should know much more of the history of Andersonville and other Southern prisons than it does, it had never occurred to me that I was in any way charged with the duty of increasing that enlightenment.  No affected deprecation of my own abilities had any part is this. I certainly knew enough of the matter, as did every other boy who had even a month's experience in those terrible places, but the very magnitude of that knowledge overpowered me, by showing me the vast requirements of the subject-requirements that seemed to make it presumption for any but the greatest pens in our literature to attempt the work.  One day at Andersonville or Florence would be task enough for the genius of Carlyle or Hugo; lesser than they would fail preposterously to rise to the level of the theme.  No writer ever described such a deluge of woes as swept over the unfortunates confined in Rebel prisons in the last year-and-a-half of the Confederacy's life.  No man was ever called upon to describe the spectacle and the process of seventy thousand young, strong, able-bodied men, starving and rotting to death.  Such a gigantic tragedy as this stuns the mind and benumbs the imagination.  I no more felt myself competent to the task than to accomplish one of Michael Angelo's grand creations in sculpture or painting.  Study of the subject since confirms me in this view, and my only claim for this book is that it is a contribution--a record of individual observation and experience--which will add something to the material which the historian of the future will find available for his work.  The work was begun at the suggestion of Mr. D. R. Locke, (Petroleum V. Nasby), the eminent political satirist.  At first it was only intended to write a few short serial sketches of prison life for the columns of the TOLEDO BLADE.  The exceeding favor with which the first of the series was received induced a great widening of their scope, until finally they took the range they now have.  I know that what is contained herein will be bitterly denied.  I am prepared for this.  In my boyhood I witnessed the savagery of the Slavery agitation--in my youth I felt the fierceness of the hatred directed against all those who stood by the Nation.  I know that hell hath no fury like the vindictiveness of those who are hurt by the truth being told of them.  I apprehend being assailed by a sirocco of contradiction and calumny.  But I solemnly affirm in advance the entire and absolute truth of every material fact, statement and description.  I assert that, so far from there being any exaggeration in any particular, that in no instance has the half of the truth been told, nor could it be, save by an inspired pen.  I am ready to demonstrate this by any test that the deniers of this may require, and I am fortified in my position by unsolicited letters from over 3,000 surviving prisoners, warmly indorsing the account as thoroughly accurate in every respect.  It has been charged that hatred of the South is the animus of this work. Nothing can be farther from the truth.  No one has a deeper love for every part of our common country than I, and no one to-day will make more efforts and sacrifices to bring the South to the same plane of social and material development with the rest of the Nation than I will.  If I could see that the sufferings at Andersonville and elsewhere contributed in any considerable degree to that end, and I should not regret that they had been.  Blood and tears mark every step in the progress of the race, and human misery seems unavoidable in securing human advancement.  But I am naturally embittered by the fruitlessness, as well as the uselessness of the misery of Andersonville.  There was never the least military or other reason for inflicting all that wretchedness upon men, and, as far as mortal eye can discern, no earthly good resulted from the martyrdom of those tens of thousands.  I wish I could see some hope that their wantonly shed blood has sown seeds that will one day blossom, and bear a rich fruitage of benefit to mankind, but it saddens me beyond expression that I can not.  The years 1864-5 were a season of desperate battles, but in that time many more Union soldiers were slain behind the Rebel armies, by starvation and exposure, than were killed in front of them by cannon and rifle.  The country has heard much of the heroism and sacrifices of those loyal youths who fell on the field of battle; but it has heard little of the still greater number who died in prison pen.  It knows full well how grandly her sons met death in front of the serried ranks of treason, and but little of the sublime firmness with which they endured unto the death, all that the ingenious cruelty of their foes could inflict upon them while in captivity.  It is to help supply this deficiency that this book is written.  It is a mite contributed to the better remembrance by their countrymen of those who in this way endured and died that the Nation might live.  It is an offering of testimony to future generations of the measureless cost of the expiation of a national sin, and of the preservation of our national unity.  This is all.  I know I speak for all those still living comrades who went with me through the scenes that I have attempted to describe, when I say that we have no revenges to satisfy, no hatreds to appease.  We do not ask that anyone shall be punished.  We only desire that the Nation shall recognize and remember the grand fidelity of our dead comrades, and take abundant care that they shall not have died in vain.  For the great mass of Southern people we have only the kindliest feeling. We but hate a vicious social system, the lingering shadow of a darker age, to which they yield, and which, by elevating bad men to power, has proved their own and their country's bane.  The following story does not claim to be in any sense a history of Southern prisons.  It is simply a record of the experience of one individual--one boy--who staid all the time with his comrades inside the prison, and had no better opportunities for gaining information than any other of his 60,000 companions.  The majority of the illustrations in this work are from the skilled pencil of Captain O. J. Hopkins, of Toledo, who served through the war in the ranks of the Forty-second Ohio.  His army experience has been of peculiar value to the work, as it has enabled him to furnish a series of illustrations whose life-like fidelity of action, pose and detail are admirable.  Some thirty of the pictures, including the frontispiece, and the allegorical illustrations of War and Peace, are from the atelier of Mr. O. Reich, Cincinnati, O.  A word as to the spelling: Having always been an ardent believer in the reformation of our present preposterous system--or rather, no system--of orthography, I am anxious to do whatever lies in my power to promote it. In the following pages the spelling is simplified to the last degree allowed by Webster.  I hope that the time is near when even that advanced spelling reformer will be left far in the rear by the progress of a people thoroughly weary of longer slavery to the orthographical absurdities handed down to us from a remote and grossly unlearned ancestry.  Toledo, O., Dec.  10, 1879.  JOHN McELROY.       We wait beneath the furnace blast The pangs of transformation; Not painlessly doth God recast And mold anew the nation. Hot burns the fire Where wrongs expire; Nor spares the hand That from the land Uproots the ancient evil.  The hand-breadth cloud the sages feared Its bloody rain is dropping; The poison plant the fathers spared All else is overtopping. East, West, South, North, It curses the earth; All justice dies, And fraud and lies Live only in its shadow.  Then let the selfish lip be dumb And hushed the breath of sighing; Before the joy of peace must come The pains of purifying. God give us grace Each in his place To bear his lot, And, murmuring not, Endure and wait and labor!  WHITTIER       ANDERSONVILLE  A STORY OF REBEL MILITARY PRISONS     CHAPTER I.  A STRANGE LAND--THE HEART OF THE APPALACHIANS--THE GATEWAY OF AN EMPIRE --A SEQUESTERED VALE, AND A PRIMITIVE, ARCADIAN, NON-PROGRESSIVE PEOPLE.  A low, square, plainly-hewn stone, set near the summit of the eastern approach to the formidable natural fortress of Cumberland Gap, indicates the boundaries of--the three great States of Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.  It is such a place as, remembering the old Greek and Roman myths and superstitions, one would recognize as fitting to mark the confines of the territories of great masses of strong, aggressive, and frequently conflicting  peoples.  There the god Terminus should have had one of his chief temples, where his shrine would be shadowed by barriers rising above the clouds, and his sacred solitude guarded from the rude invasion of armed hosts by range on range of battlemented rocks, crowning almost inaccessible mountains, interposed across every approach from the usual haunts of men.  Roundabout the land is full of strangeness and mystery.  The throes of some great convulsion of Nature are written on the face of the four thousand square miles of territory, of which Cumberland Gap is the central point.  Miles of granite mountains are thrust up like giant walls, hundreds of feet high, and as smooth and regular as the side of a monument.  Huge, fantastically-shaped rocks abound everywhere--sometimes rising into pinnacles on lofty summits--sometimes hanging over the verge of beetling cliffs, as if placed there in waiting for a time when they could be hurled down upon"]]]
