Angel knew it by the gate. But it was rather a long walk to get there, and Suze senior-- who told Angel that she was \"Madame Valois\"--shyly refused the little girl's insistent plea to \"come in and meet mother.\"  \"I must take the children back to their supper,\" she explained. \"Already it's getting dark, and--it's Christmas Eve, you know. I hope your mother won't have had time to worry. Tell her we brought you home as soon as--as you were found.\"  A faint fear that some gentle hint of reproach lurked in the kind words (as she had hidden under the palm) stirred in Angel's mind, making her wish all the more to benefit the Valois family, and so justify her eavesdropping. She pictured, with joy, the sensational discovery of the diamond ring, perhaps while the children were receiving their presents from the Christmas tree. She did hope it might happen then! So anxious was she to tell her mother the story of the fairy garden that, after the good-bys, she bounded into the hotel like a bomb. Her mother's suite was on the first floor, and in her haste to get to it Angel would have dashed past a group in the hall, had not the _concierge_ headed her off.  \"Here she is, Mademoiselle! Now everything is all right!\" he exclaimed, as joyously as though great news had come from the front. And out from the group tottered Mademoiselle Rose, to precipitate herself upon the child and drench her velvet hood with a waterspout of tears.  Angel had not been left in ignorance by her relatives that she was a young person of some charm and importance, but never in her life had she been so overwhelmed with adjectives, in any language. Mademoiselle Rose, shedding tears which looked to Angel's astonished gaze the size of pebbles, called her a lamb, a saint, an adored cherub, and many other things which Angel determined to bring up in future if ever she were scolded. It appeared that the distracted governess, on waking from her dream of love with Claude, had nearly fainted on finding Angel gone. She had left her soldier on his crutches, to rush here and there, searching wildly for her charge. She had described the child to every one she met, and asked in vain for news of her. She had dashed into shops and houses, she had been led to the _gendarmerie_ and had sobbed out her story of loss, reluctantly pausing to see details industriously written down; and at last she had run all the way to the hotel, hoping against hope that the lost one had returned.  Her state of mind, as described by herself, was tragic when she had ransacked the rooms and asked questions of servants and visitors, only to be assured that her charge had not come home. She blamed herself entirely, not Angel in the least; therefore Angel felt kindly toward Mademoiselle, and attempted to comfort her by saying how glad she ought to be, anyhow, that Claude was alive. The young Frenchwoman hysterically admitted this, and was in the act of expressing also her thankfulness that Madame had not yet returned, to suffer, when Madame herself walked in, followed by a _commissionaire_ bearing many bundles. She looked rosy and girlish, but at sight of Mademoiselle on her knees in the hall, bathing Angel with tears, her bright color ebbed.  \"What _has_ happened?\" she stammered, her big, dark eyes appealing to _concierge_, governess, and all Angel's other satellites.  It was the child who answered, before any one else could speak. \"Oh, mother!\" she gasped, drawing in a long breath, \"I haven't been runned over by a moting-car, or bited by a mad dog, or drownded in the sea, or anything bad, but only just lost for a _very_ little while; and it was lovely, in a fairy garden. And I want to tell you about it _quick_, because I gave them your ring what has one big di'mond and little ones all the way 'round, tied to their white kitten's neck.\"  \"Good gracious!\" ejaculated Elinor Odell, as Angel paused at the end of that long-drawn breath. \"What _does_ she mean, Mademoiselle?\"  \"I do not know yet, Madame,\" the governess apologized, getting to her feet and wiping her eyes with the drier of two damp handkerchiefs. \"The blessed one has but just come in, when I was about to go out once more and search. There has been no time to hear, but, praise, le bon Dieu, she is at least safe and unhurt.\"  \"I will telephone the good news to the _gendarmerie_,\" murmured the _concierge_.  Elinor Odell adored her child, not knowing for certain which she loved better than the other, if either--Dick, her husband, or his daughter and hers. She was warm-hearted, and deep-hearted, too; but circumstances had very early in her life of twenty-eight years developed the practical side of her nature. She had learned how to control herself and to control others. Also she was quick--perhaps too quick--in forming conclusions. Had she not grown up as the only child of a widowed millionaire, she might have been just the beautiful, intelligent, emotional girl she looked, and nothing more; but to her father she owed much besides money and position; she owed many qualities. One of them was a slight surface hardness, like a cooling crust over boiling lava. She realized instantly that, no matter what the \"Angel-Imp's\" adventure had been, there was no longer any need to worry about the child. She took in that fact, and even as she mentally gave thanks for it she took in something else also. Persons in a garden whither Angel had strayed or been invited had apparently persuaded the innocent and impulsive little girl to give away a valuable diamond ring. Prejudice instantly built up within Elinor a barrier against some one unknown. She didn't mean to reproach Angel, but she did mean to catechize her, and she intended to get back her father's last year's Christmas present.  \"All's well that ends well,\" she quoted, with the radiant smile which had helped to give Elinor Holroyd the reputation of a beauty. \"Come, Angel, come Mademoiselle, let's go up to our own rooms and tell one another everything.\" Then, when the governess and child had been started off in advance, she paused for whispered instructions concerning the bundles. They contained the Christmas presents which she had gone out to buy for Angel, but, luckily, the little girl was too excited to notice and wonder inconveniently. She wasn't even thinking of the gifts from her grandfather in America, which she confidently expected.  \"Now, my Angel-Imp, tell me all about it,\" began Elinor, when the lights were switched on in the sitting-room. \"Or will you wait until we've taken off your hat and coat?\"  But the child was not in the mood to wait for an earthquake. She began pouring forth her story, aided and supplemented, at first, by Mademoiselle, who found it necessary to explain Claude. After alternately blaming and defending her absent-mindedness, however, the word passed from Rose to Angel, who was quick to seize the advantage. She alone knew the whole story, so she alone could tell how she had wanted to go home; how she hadn't liked to bother Mademoiselle; how she had got lost, and how, just then, she had found herself at the gate of the \"fairy garden.\"  \"I truly _almost_ b'lieved it was,\" she announced, earnestly, \"because you said, 'who knows if there aren't fairies?' So they must have gardens. Anyhow, the children are as pretty as fairies, but I don't think they can be as happy, because their mother cried, and their father's been wounded, and cheated, too, by a horrid man who's going to take everything away from them, even the garden, and the oranges--the last things they've got to eat. And they're _dreadfully_ poor--oh, as poor as poor! That's what their mother was crying about when she left the children in the house so they wouldn't know. And when their father came home and found her putting flowers to bed and crying on them, she cried more because he was carrying such a heavy Christmas tree and had hurt his foot getting it, and he was so pale and thin, she _couldn't_ stop when he asked her. Besides, she'd had _such_ bad news in a letter while he was gone! It was about the nasty man who took all their money and was going to take back the garden, too. That was why I was sure you'd want me to give them your di'mond ring that you hardly ever wear. It's always lying around somewhere, mother, so when I found it on my thumb--you see, I forgot to put it back on your table--I thought it would be _just_ the thing, and a lovely surprise for the children when they found it tied to the cat's neck with my hair-ribbon. I 'spect they must be finding it now, because they brought me here--they and their mother, while their father was putting the dec'rations on the Christmas tree--and by this time maybe they're home. Their name's Valois--Suzanne and Paulette Valois, and their mother's Suzanne, too, or Susan, because _she's_ English and they're Belgian. And don't you think if grandpa sent me any presents I can give some to them? There's a whole pile of letters on the table. Maybe there's one from grandpa to say--\"  \"Stop--stop!\" cried Elinor, catching the child before she could spring on the latest arrivals from the post. \"It seems to me that you've been in rather too much of a hurry already, with your Christmas presents to the Valois family, though I know you meant for the best, darling. Now, the next thing to do is to explain how Father and Mother Valois happened to talk so much about their troubles before a stranger they'd never seen before---\"  \"Oh, they didn't see me then. I thought I telled you that!\" broke in the child. \"I eavesdropped, under a tree with branches most to the ground. I went in to play with the _fluffiest_ white kitten, and it was while I was there they talked.\"  \"How do you know they didn't see you?\" inquired Elinor, judicially.  \"Because if they had they wouldn't have talked, with me listening,\" Angel carefully made clear to the slow comprehension of a grown-"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42919"],["title","Angel Unawares: A Story of Christmas Eve (#4)"],["body","up.  \"I'm not so sure,\" murmured the grownup. She did not speak the words aloud, because she wished her Angel-Imp to go on believing, as long as she might, that human nature was all good. It occurred to her that a tree must have abnormally thick branches, if a child in a pearl-gray velvet hood and coat trimmed with glistening chinchilla were to remain invisible throughout a long and intimate conversation. It occurred to her, also, that the velvet and chinchilla simply shouted \"Money!\" People were extraordinarily subtle, sometimes, when they had an object to gain, as she had learned in her girlhood through sad experience. She, too, had had faith in everybody when she was Angel's age, and even years older, but her father had thought it best that for self-protection she should be enlightened early. She did not quite believe in Angel's fairies of the fairy garden. The story, even as the child told it, had discrepancies.  \"I fancy, darling,\" Elinor suggested, \"that your new friends can't be so dreadfully poor as they made you think. You see, if they were, they'd have no money to spend on a Christmas tree--\"  \"It was growing on a mountain,\" Angel defended her friends.  \"Perhaps, but it wasn't growing all ready decorated. You said that the father--what's his name--Valois?--stayed at home to decorate the tree while the rest of the family brought you home--and told you all about themselves, their name and everything, I suppose, so you might know where to find them again and take me to see them, perhaps. It was good of them to bring you, of course, and I'm grateful. _I_ should have cried, like Madame Valois, if I'd come back while you were lost. But, all the same, dear--\"  She stopped short, because she did not wish the child--so young, so sweet, so warmhearted--to be disillusioned. The thought in her mind, however, was that Monsieur Valois and his English wife might not have been so eager to tell their name had they learned in time about the diamond ring. They might not have made it so easy to find them in their fairy garden as it was now! But even though their name was known, it would be difficult to get back the ring, unless she--Elinor Odell--chose to take strenuous measures. It would be so simple for these people to say, when inquiries were made about the ring, and a sum of money offered in its place, that they had never seen it; that some one outside must have noticed the glittering thing tied to the cat's neck, and stolen it. That, she thought, was almost certain to be the excuse they would make; and her heart, which could be warm and generous as Angel's, hardened toward the people of the garden.  \"I suppose, unless I want a horrid fuss, I shall have to give up the ring for lost, or else offer nearly the full value as a bribe,\" she said to herself.  Nevertheless, she rang, and bade a waiter ask the manager of the hotel to step to her sitting-room for a moment. Meanwhile, until he should come, she glanced at the letters. There were many, and among them was one addressed to \"Miss Angela Odell. To be opened by herself,\" in Cyrus Holroyd's handwriting. But before it could be passed to its owner a knock announced the manager of the hotel.  He was delighted to hear that the missing little one was safe, and listened politely to Mrs. Odell's questions concerning the Valois family. At first the name suggested nothing, but when he learned that the man was \"a gardener, or horticulturist, or something,\" he remembered. Ah yes, to be sure! There was such a person, a Belgian refugee, but with money, it would appear, for he had bought property from a Swiss who had lived for some years in Mentone. Not a property of great value, no. And it was said that the Swiss-- Siegel his name was--had let his business decline. After selling it he had gone away at once. No one knew much about Valois except that he had an English Wife, a good-looking young woman, who had visited all the hotels earlier in the season, trying to get work as a teacher of her own language, or as a seamstress. That would look as if Valois had found the business profit disappointing. But then, there was nothing for any one in these days. The only thing to do was to hold on.  Yes, the only thing to do was to hold on. But it took money to hold on. Mrs. Odell was ready to admit that the Valois family might be unfortunate, yet she was all the more sure she would never see her diamond ring again. Neither would she see the Valoises, husband or wife, unless she went, or sent---  \"A young man who wishes to speak for a moment with Madame,\" announced a waiter at the door, and presented a bit of pasteboard. It was a business card, on which was printed--not engraved--in large, plain letters, \"Paul Valois, Horticulturist.\"  So, after all, he had come! But, no doubt, only to try and get money.  \"Mademoiselle, will you go with Angel to her room and take off her hat and coat?\" Elinor hastily cleared the field for action.  \"Oh, here's a letter from her grandfather, in New York. You may read it to her. And presently I will call her in to tell me what he says.\"  The tall French girl whisked away the small American child. The door was shut between the two rooms, and at the outer one, leading into the corridor, a tap sounded.  \"Come in!\" cried Elinor, clothing herself with dignity. But it was not Paul Valois, horticulturist, who entered. It was Mrs. Odell's own Irish-American maid, with an immense parcel.  \"It comes from Paris, and it's for little Miss Angel,\" she said, leaving the door open. \"Oh, Madame, it's sure to be that wonderful doll we talked of.\"  Then, just in time to catch these words--appropriate words for Christmas Eve--a tall, thin young man appeared on the threshold. His hat was in his hand, and the scar of a wound still showed red on his forehead. Though the night was cold, and Elinor Odell had been glad of her sables, he wore no overcoat. His clothes looked more suitable for summer than for winter, even in the south of France, and she wondered if it were a trick to catch her sympathy. She could not help thinking that he had a good, brave face, not the face of a trickster; but she deliberately put herself in the judgment seat. It would take more than a pair of fine eyes and a broad forehead with a soldier's scar, to charm her out of it!  \"Good evening,\" she greeted him pleasantly, in French. \"It was you, I think, who kindly sent your wife here with my little lost girl this evening. I'm glad to be able to thank you both for what you did.\" Designedly she let the man have a \"lead,\" and waited curiously to see what use he would make of it.  He did not keep her long in suspense. \"Oh, Madame, we did nothing at all,\" he replied, giving his case away unexpectedly. \"My children thought your little girl must be a fairy. You see, my wife tells them wonderful stories. She comes from a county in England where they still believe in the 'wee folk'--Devonshire. Perhaps you've been there? It was a great joy to them to have the visit, and the walk was a pleasure. We are all glad if you have been spared anxiety; but I fear you must have been anxious about another loss. It is for that reason I have hurried here, on a bicycle borrowed from our nearest neighbor. The little lady amused herself tying a ribbon and a beautiful ring to the neck of my children's pet, a white kitten given by that same neighbor who lent the bicycle. Then she must have forgotten to take it off. It was only a few minutes ago that my Paulette found the ring, when she came home. I have brought it to you.\"  \"How good of you to take so much trouble!\" exclaimed Elinor. But something inside her whispered, \"He thought it would be safer to claim the regard than to keep the diamond.\"  The Belgian took from his pocket a clean handkerchief with a knot tied in the corner, and from the knot produced the ring.  \"La voilà, Madame,\" he said, simply, as he laid the shining thing on the letter-strewn table. \"And now I will not disturb you longer. Permit me to wish for you and the little fairy who visited us a happy Christmas.\"  So he was leaving the reward to her generosity! Wasn't that rather clever of him?  \"Thank you for the wishes as well as for bringing back my ring,\" said Elinor. \"And--you must, of course, allow me to recompense your kindness. A souvenir of it, and of my daughter, for your children's Christmas---\"  As she spoke, she took from her gold-chain bag a fat bundle of notes and quickly selected one for five hundred francs. The ring was worth this sum many times over, but it seemed to her that a hundred dollars was not an ungenerous present. If the man were really poor--and honest--he ought to be well satisfied. She watched his face as, with a smile, she held out the French note.  He flushed so deeply that the scar on his forehead turned purple.  \"It isn't as much as he expected!\" thought Elinor. She waited, however, for him to speak.  \"Oh, Madame, I thank you!\" he stammered. \"But I could not possibly accept a reward. I am only too glad to have found the ring.\"  He seemed actually to be going, to be hurrying away in order to escape persuasion; yet Elinor, in her experience, realized that the move might be meant only to draw her on. She was almost sure that the man would pause at the door, but rather than see him thus humiliated (because she couldn't help liking his face) she persisted. \"You surely must take the money, or I shall be hurt.\"  The face, which she liked, grew a shade redder, and then became suddenly paler than before. \"Please do not say that, Madame,\" he pleaded, \"because it would be--it would be a thing I _could_ not do, to take money for returning to a lady her lost property. It would make me worse than a beggar.\"  A little, tingling thrill shot through Elinor's veins. She felt ashamed, for this outburst was genuine. Not even a cynic could mistake it, and she hated herself because she was a cynic. Still, she would not give up her point--less than ever would she give it up; for now she began earnestly to want"]]]
