[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41753"],["title","Dave Dawson at Truk (#4)"],["body","feel up to it now, I want to have a talk with you. What about it, Commander? Is it all right?\"  The vice-admiral addressed the last to the navy surgeon who had entered with him, and he received an immediate reply in the affirmative.  \"Oh, yes, sir,\" the officer said. Then with a little laugh, \"They both have pretty tough heads, for which they can certainly be thankful.\"  \"Thankful in more ways than one,\" the vice-admiral grunted, and Dave had the feeling he was thinking of how that Jap had been scared away from completing the job. \"Now,\" the senior officer continued, and looked from one to the other, \"let's have the complete story as nearly as you can remember it. And try to remember everything, if you possibly can. The situation is mighty serious. Mighty grave.\"  Ten minutes later Dave and Freddy Farmer had finished relating every detail of their experience. Each had confirmed the other's story and had added one or two overlooked details. Vice-Admiral Carter listened through to the very end without once interrupting with a question. Now he sat perched on the end of Dawson's bed balling one clenched fist into the palm of the other hand, and scowling thoughtfully down at his movements.  \"There's one thing I want both of you to think about hard,\" he finally broke the silence. \"It's just possible that it may have skipped both your minds thus far. The name of that pilot's carrier. Did he or the Jap mention it?\"  Dave and Freddy looked questioningly at each other. Then they both looked at the base commandant and shook their heads.  \"No, sir,\" Dave spoke for them both. \"The name of his carrier wasn't mentioned once. But I can tell you what one it was, sir. I mean, he said that it was sailing tonight. I mean, last night. So all you have to do is ...\"  Dawson stopped as the vice-admiral shook his head.  \"No, sir?\" he echoed.  \"No, Dawson,\" the base commandant said bitterly. \"We can't find it out that way, unfortunately. All three carriers sailed last night. That pilot didn't know. He only knew that his carrier was to sail, naturally. But all three were scheduled to sail. And they did.\"  \"But his was sailing for Pearl Harbor, sir!\" Freddy Farmer spoke up. \"So the one that ...\"  \"That's no good, either,\" the vice-admiral interrupted. \"The entire three-carrier force is bound for Pearl Harbor. En route they will work out a battle problem, and then proceed to Pearl Harbor to take aboard two torpedo and two dive-bomber squadrons, that are waiting there. This ensign pilot--this rotten Nazi--just what did he look like? If either of you can give me a detailed description, perhaps a radio to each of the carriers will make it possible for us to catch our man before the force reaches Pearl. Just what did he look like?\"  \"That's just the point, sir,\" Dave Dawson said sadly, when Freddy Farmer didn't speak. \"We saw him only in profile, and the light was bad. I didn't see a single thing unusual about him. I mean, sir, he looked just like hundreds of other pilots in Naval Aviation uniform. What about you, Freddy? Did you notice any outstanding features?\"  Young Farmer frowned, sighed, and shook his head.  \"No, sir,\" he said to the vice-admiral. \"I'm sure I'd be able to recognize him, if I ever saw him again, but I really didn't see anything about him that would help anybody else to identify him.\"  \"Yes, I'm sure I'd be able to spot him again, too,\" Dawson murmured. Then, with a grim note in his voice, \"And that Japrat, too, even though I did only see him at a distance.\"  The vice-admiral was again scowling down at his clenched fist grinding into the palm of his other hand, and he acted as though he had not heard either of them speak. Dawson waited a few moments, and then asked a question.  \"What about the service records of the fighter pilots aboard all three carriers, sir?\" he said.  The base commandant raised his head and looked at him sharply.  \"What do you mean?\" he demanded. \"And why just the fighter pilots?\"  \"From the way they talked, sir,\" Dawson replied quickly, \"I felt certain that he was a fighter pilot. I mean, he plans to take off, when the opportunity presents itself, and fly direct to Truk. Well, sir, if he were a torpedo plane or dive bomber or scout bomber pilot, he would have somebody along with him. Gunner, or radio man, or both, I mean, sir. But neither of them made any mention of anybody else. So I feel certain that he's a fighter pilot.\"  \"Yes, I guess you're right there, Dawson,\" the senior officer said with a nod. \"But how would service records help us to find our man?\"  \"Well, sir,\" Dave said after a moment of frowning hesitation, \"he is obviously German. He probably has a German-sounding name. His record sheet would tell about his parents. Where they were born, and so forth. He may even be a naturalized American, sir. Of course, it's just a long shot chance, but checking the service records of all the fighter pilots in that carrier force might turn up something that was suspicious-looking.\"  \"It might, but I'm afraid it would be even harder than the needle in the haystack stunt,\" the base commandant said with a shrug. \"Both the Army and the Navy have men of German birth, and parents. And it would take time. All that sort of thing is on file at the Navy Department in Washington. We haven't records that complete here. Of course, though, I'll get the wheels moving on it, at once. I'd be a fool to leave any stone untouched, and unturned. If that devil once ...\"  The senior officer cut himself off with a groan, and his dismay and worry showed plainly on his face.  \"There's one thing you might try, sir,\" Freddy Farmer spoke up hesitatingly. \"That is, if you don't mind my suggesting it, sir?\"  \"Mind?\" Vice-Admiral Carter barked. \"Good heavens, Farmer, don't stand on formality! If you have anything to suggest, don't hesitate an instant. Suggest it at once. What is it?\"  \"Recall the force to Dago, sir,\" Freddy said. \"Then Dawson and I could have a look at the fighter pilots. I mean, it might be arranged so that nobody would think anything of it. Perhaps we could pick out your man for you.\"  \"Well, I had thought of that,\" the senior officer said in a weary voice, \"but it can't be done. And for several reasons. The force is not under my command, strictly speaking. I would have to get permission from Washington, or at least from Admiral Nimitz at Honolulu. Also, the force is on close battle schedule right now, and the delay its return would cause would upset plans that have been months in the making. Of course, the seriousness of the situation seems to justify the recall of the force, but it doesn't follow that the recall would definitely solve the problem. You two might not be able to recognize him again. The very fact that the force turned back might make our man suspicious, and he might jump ship. You see we want not only to get our hands on him, but we also want to get our hands on the information that he carries. Then, too, there is his Jap partner in this spy business.\"  \"What about that Jap, sir?\" Dawson asked. \"I suppose a hunt for him was started, wasn't it? And was that orange grove manager able to give you any help there?\"  \"None at all,\" the base commandant said gloomily. \"He didn't get close enough to be able to say definitely whether the man who attacked you two was a Jap, or a Mexican worker. In fact, we only believe that he was a Jap from what you two say.\"  \"He was a Jap, or I never heard a Jap talk,\" Dawson said with an emphatic nod of his head.  \"Quite!\" Freddy Farmer echoed. \"The beggar was definitely Japanese, sir.\"  \"Oh, I'm not doubting you!\" the vice-admiral said quickly. \"I believe you completely. But that simply goes to show how hopeless the hunt for him has been, and will be. He may be a Jap, but he may not look one hundred per cent Jap, is what I mean. It's simply another case of the needle in the haystack again. If only you had heard that fighter pilot mention the name of his carrier.\"  \"Yes, but he did not mention it,\" Freddy Farmer said sadly. \"Of that I am positive.\"  \"So am I,\" Dawson said absently. \"I ...\"  He let the rest trail off into silence, and gazed vacantly into space. Vice-Admiral Carter looked at him for a moment, and then leaned forward and tapped him on the knee.  \"You've got a peculiar look on your face, Dawson,\" he said quietly. \"Has anything special come to mind?\"  Dave wiped the vacant look from his face, looked at the senior officer and smiled.  \"Nothing on what's already happened, sir,\" he said. \"But I think there's a pretty fair chance of our catching up with that fighter pilot.\"  \"Then don't beat about the bush with it!\" the senior officer snapped. \"What? How?\"  \"If Farmer and I could be relieved of our base duties, sir,\" Dave said presently, \"we could fly to Pearl and get there ahead of the force, go aboard each carrier before any shore leave was granted, and find our man. Naturally, you would have to radio for such permission to be given us, and also for Naval Intelligence to be there on hand to arrest the pilot when we spotted him, and seize his personal effects.\"  \"Naturally I'd relieve you both of your duties here at the base,\" the vice-admiral said, \"but you both happen to be hospital cases. You're in no condition for a flight to Pearl Harbor.\"  \"Why not?\" Dave blurted out. \"I feel fine. I haven't even got an ache in my head.\"  \"Nor I!\" Freddy Farmer spoke up quickly. \"Besides, sir, we don't have to take off today. It will take the force some time to reach Pearl. We can stay right here for a couple of days and still get there ahead of it. It would be simple enough to arrange for us to ferry over a Navy bomber, or something, wouldn't it?\"  \"Farmer is right, sir!\" Dawson said eagerly. \"We don't have to leave today, or even tomorrow. There's plenty of time to beat the carrier force to Pearl Harbor. And to my way of figuring the thing, we haven't got to do any worrying until the force _does_ reach Pearl. That Nazi isn't going to get those water flares until he "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41753"],["title","Dave Dawson at Truk (#5)"],["body","contact with some men in Honolulu. Of course it's really a Naval Intelligence job, but ... Well, after all, sir, if anybody can identify that fighter pilot, Farmer and I can!\"  The vice-admiral regarded them both gravely for a long moment, and then he smiled slowly.  \"Even if I didn't know of some of the tough nuts you two have cracked in the past,\" he said, \"I think I would still be inclined to agree to your plan. Very well, then. I'll arrange for you to fly to Pearl in plenty of time to meet the carrier force when it arrives. And I'll make the other arrangements you spoke of, too. Meantime I'll get out of here, and let you rest up some more. You're a couple of very lucky men. You both had a mighty close call. And in view of the fact that neither of you has eaten since yesterday noon, I guess you could do with a little food as well as rest.\"  A crack about how Freddy must certainly feel about that last rose to Dawson's lips, but he suddenly realized that he was plenty hungry himself, so he let the remark slide.  \"Thank you, sir, for giving us the chance to help,\" he said instead. \"After all, we were both very dumb to let that Japrat put one over on us.\"  \"Quite!\" Freddy Farmer said with a grim nod.  \"No, I wouldn't say that,\" the vice-admiral corrected them. \"The best of us meet up with that sort of thing, sooner or later. It's not that we're dumb as much as it is that the Japs are sure clever devils. We may call them monkey men, but it's going to take a lot of brains, and a lot of hard, tough fighting, before we sink their rising sun. Well, I must be getting along. Naturally I'll see you both again before you leave. And in case it should skip my mind, I'll say it now. Good luck, and good hunting, to both of you!\"     CHAPTER FIVE  _Westward Ho!_   \"Pretty, pretty, hey, kid?\" Dawson grunted, and made a sweeping gesture with one hand.  \"What is?\" Freddy Farmer murmured absently. \"Oh, you mean this California scenery? Yes, it's very nice, but stop talking about it so much, will you? You'll have me believing that you are a native of this state.\"  \"No, dope!\" Dave snapped. \"I don't mean the scenery, though it really is something. I mean those Flying Fortresses and Liberators, lined up over there. Remember? This is the Los Angeles Air Forces base. We flew up here last night from Dago. We're ferrying one of those jobs out to Pearl. Or don't you remember? Oh, I get it. You're in _that_ kind of a daze, huh?\"  \"What do you mean, that kind of a daze?\" young Farmer demanded. \"I was just wondering if ...\"  \"Sure!\" Dawson broke in with a chuckle. \"Just what I mean. You're wondering if there's time to slip out to Hollywood so maybe you can get Dorothy Lamour's autograph, and Hedy Lamarr's, and ...\"  \"Rot! That's kid stuff!\" Freddy snorted as his cheeks went a beet red. \"Of course ... well, I mean, they are both very lovely ladies, and ...\"  \"Okay, we'll skip it!\" Dave laughed as Freddy started to stammer in his confusion. \"We'll pretend you were wondering something else, which your face says you weren't. What was it?\"  \"Definitely something else, and please go walk into one of those revving propellers, will you!\" Freddy said hotly. \"Frankly, I was wondering why the vice-admiral sent us up here to fly an Air Forces plane out instead of sending us over by a Navy plane. A Catalina, or a Coronada, for instance.\"  \"I wondered about that myself, for a while,\" Dave replied, as the smile faded from his lips. \"But I think I figured it out.\"  \"All right, master mind!\" young Farmer said with a patient sigh when Dawson didn't continue. \"I'll be nice and polite, and ask. What did you figure out?\"  \"That Jap, who hasn't been caught yet, and probably won't be,\" Dave replied. \"He knows very well he didn't kill us, so it's a cinch he figured that we would tell what we knew, which we did. And it's just possible that he was in a position to keep an eye on us. So if he saw us take off in a Navy plane bound for Pearl he would know very well that we heard about his Nazi boy friend heading that way on one of our carriers. I mean, it stands to reason that he doesn't know how much we heard. If he saw us head for Pearl he'd know for sure that we heard plenty, and maybe there is some way he can contact that Nazi. Or even better, contact that rat in Honolulu and have him clear out before the Nazi shows up. In case he's spotted and trailed. See what I mean?\"  \"Well, you make it just about as clear as mud, but I think I follow you,\" young Farmer said. \"So to throw off the Jap, in case he was watching us, the vice-admiral sent us up here, as though we had been transferred to the Air Forces, eh?\"  \"Go to the head of the class,\" Dave said with a nod. \"That's just how I figure Vice-Admiral Carter reasoned. To ship us both north to an Air Forces base may give that Jap, if he was watching us, the idea that we hadn't learned a thing.\"  \"Well, we're here, anyway,\" Freddy Farmer said with a shrug. \"A thought comes to me, though.\"  \"Grab it and hang onto it hard, kid,\" Dawson laughed. \"Those things are rare as far as you're concerned, you know.\"  But Freddy didn't rise to that remark. He stared fixedly at the twenty or more Flying Fortresses and Liberators lined up on the far side of the huge Los Angeles field.  \"I wonder if that Nazi fighter pilot _is_ aboard one of those carriers?\" he suddenly said in a low voice, as though asking himself the question.  Dawson gulped as he suddenly realized that possibility.  \"Sweet tripe!\" he gasped. \"That _is_ a thought! Maybe, knowing that we were listening, they decided to take the chance of his going aboard. Maybe they ... But nuts! That's crazy!\"  \"How so?\" Freddy questioned.  \"Well, look at it,\" Dave argued, and gestured with one hand. \"That Nazi was all set as a fighter pilot aboard a Yank carrier. For him to jump ship, and not sail, would make him a marked man for sure. You don't miss your ship, and just walk into the Naval District commandant, and laugh it off. You catch plenty. And in his case, if _he_ jumped ship _he_ certainly wouldn't report to the Naval commandant. He'd make tracks in the opposite direction. And his place as a spy in our forces would be gone forever. No, I think he took the chance and sailed with her.\"  \"There's one way we could find out,\" Freddy said. \"Let's phone Vice-Admiral Carter. He can certainly find out in a minute if either of the carriers sailed with a fighter pilot missing. Or if one took a replacement aboard at the last minute.\"  \"Hey, nix!\" Dawson cried in alarm. \"Call him and find out that a carrier _did_ sail with one fighter pilot less? And that there was no sense for us to fly to Pearl? And get recalled to Dago to go on instructing Navy pilots? Are you nuts, Freddy? It may only be Pearl Harbor, but that's twenty-four hundred miles nearer the war than we are right now! Do you want to go back and...?\"  \"No, certainly not, Dave,\" young Farmer interrupted quietly. \"But it doesn't happen to be a matter of where we _want_ to go. It's what we can _do_ to help. If that Nazi didn't sail, then perhaps the vice-admiral would want us to stick around to maybe identify a suspect that was picked up later. After all ...\"  \"Okay, okay, you win!\" Dawson groaned. \"We better put it up to the vice-admiral, and find out what he has to say about it. We can phone from the Administration Building over there. But if he didn't sail, and we hoof it back to Dago, just don't bother speaking to me for the next twenty years, will you?\"  \"And will you listen to the chap who just a couple of days ago was quite content to wait patiently for his next good break in this war!\" Freddy Farmer jeered as he dropped into step.  \"Yeah, but that was a couple of days ago!\" Dave growled. \"I'm just hoping that the chance hasn't come _and_ gone on account of your bright little suggestion.\"  \"Well, I still think we should call him,\" Freddy said doggedly. \"And so do you, and you know it!\"  \"Oh, go walk a wing!\" Dave mumbled. \"Sure I do. And that's what burns me up!\"  Forty-five minutes later Dawson and Freddy Farmer were back on the flying field, grinning from ear to ear, and walking over toward the Operations Office.  \"Boy! Do I feel like a new man!\" Dave said, and let out a happy sigh. \"I sure was worried while that call was being put through. Not that I don't like Dago, you understand. It's a swell town, but right now I could do with some of the war.\"  \"Me, too,\" Freddy said with a chuckle. \"To tell the truth I was on pins and needles, too. But everything is all right now. The carrier force sailed with every fighter pilot aboard, so we're to carry on according to plan.\"  \"Check, and double check,\" Dave echoed, and started up the steps of the Operations Office. \"Pearl Harbor, here we come! I hope they give us a good crate to fly. What do you want, Freddy, a Fortress or a Liberator?\"  \"Either one will suit me,\" the English-born air ace replied. \"Both are pukka airplanes. I ...\"  Young Farmer stopped short as a field orderly came running up.  \"Captains Dawson and Farmer?\" he panted when he reached them.  \"I'm Dawson,\" Dave said with a nod. \"What's the matter, Sergeant?\"  \"The Naval Air Base at San Diego just called back,\" the non-com said. \"Vice Admiral Carter wants to speak with either one of you officers.\"  Dave scowled, and then looked wide-eyed at Freddy.  \"What do you suppose now?\" he murmured.  Young Farmer shrugged, but a worried look stole into his eyes.  \"I haven't the faintest,\" he said. Then, looking at the non-com, he asked, \"Can we take that call in here, or do we have to go over to Administration?\"  \"I can have it transferred over here, sir,\" the sergeant said, and pushed open the door of the Operations Office. \"Follow me, please.\"  A few minutes later Dave and Freddy were listening at a single receiver to Vice-Admiral Carter's voice at the other end of the wire.  \"I want you two to take off just as soon as you possibly can,\" the Naval base commandant told them. \"Don't delay a minute longer than you have to."]]]
