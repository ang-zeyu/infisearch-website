[16] “My son, it is time for us to lay aside our counterfeiting.”    [17] “I am as the centre of a circle, to the which all parts of        the circumference bear an equal relation: but with thee it        is not thus.” This phrase seems to have remained as obscure        to commentators as Dante found it at the moment. No one, as        far as I know, has even fairly tried to find a meaning for        it. To me the following appears a not unlikely one. Love is        weeping on Dante’s account, and not on his own. He says,        “I am the centre of a circle (_Amor che muove il sole e        l’altre stelle_): therefore all lovable objects, whether in        heaven or earth, or any part of the circle’s circumference,        are equally near to me. Not so thou, who wilt one day lose        Beatrice when she goes to heaven.” The phrase would thus        contain an intimation of the death of Beatrice, accounting        for Dante being next told not to inquire the meaning of the        speech,—”Demand no more than may be useful to thee.”  Whereupon, remembering me, I knew that I had beheld this vision during the ninth hour of the day; and I resolved that I would make a ditty, before I left my chamber, according to the words my master had spoken. And this is the ditty that I made:—      Song, ’tis my will that thou do seek out Love,       And go with him where my dear lady is;       That so my cause, the which thy harmonies     Do plead, his better speech may clearly prove.     Thou goest, my Song, in such a courteous kind,       That even companionless         Thou mayst rely on thyself anywhere.     And yet, an thou wouldst get thee a safe mind,       First unto Love address         Thy steps; whose aid, mayhap, ’twere ill to spare,         Seeing that she to whom thou mak’st thy prayer     Is, as I think, ill-minded unto me,     And that if Love do not companion thee,       Thou’lt have perchance small cheer to tell me of.      With a sweet accent, when thou com’st to her,       Begin thou in these words,         First having craved a gracious audience:     “He who hath sent me as his messenger,     Lady, thus much records,         An thou but suffer him, in his defence.         Love, who comes with me, by thine influence     Can make this man do as it liketh him:     Wherefore, if this fault _is_ or doth but _seem_       Do thou conceive: for his heart cannot move.”      Say to her also: “Lady, his poor heart       Is so confirmed in faith         That all its thoughts are but of serving thee:     ’Twas early thine, and could not swerve apart.”       Then, if she wavereth,         Bid her ask Love, who knows if these things be.         And in the end, beg of her modestly     To pardon so much boldness: saying too:—     “If thou declare his death to be thy due,       The thing shall come to pass, as doth behove.”      Then pray thou of the Master of all ruth,       Before thou leave her there,         That he befriend my cause and plead it well.     “In guerdon of my sweet rhymes and my truth”       (Entreat him) “stay with her;         Let not the hope of thy poor servant fail;         And if with her thy pleading should prevail,     Let her look on him and give peace to him.”     Gentle my Song, if good to thee it seem,       Do this: so worship shall be thine and love.  _This ditty is divided into three parts. In the first, I tell it whither to go, and I encourage it, that it may go the more confidently, and I tell it whose company to join if it would go with confidence and without any danger. In the second, I say that which it behoves the ditty to set forth. In the third, I give it leave to start when it pleases, recommending its course to the arms of Fortune. The second part begins here, “With a sweet accent;” the third here, “Gentle my Song.” Some might contradict me, and say that they understand not whom I address in the second person, seeing that the ditty is merely the very words I am speaking. And therefore I say that this doubt I intend to solve and clear up in this little book itself, at a more difficult passage, and then let him understand who now doubts, or would now contradict as aforesaid._  After this vision I have recorded, and having written those words which Love had dictated to me, I began to be harassed with many and divers thoughts, by each of which I was sorely tempted; and in especial, there were four among them that left me no rest. The first was this: “Certainly the lordship of Love is good; seeing that it diverts the mind from all mean things.” The second was this: “Certainly the lordship of Love is evil; seeing that the more homage his servants pay to him, the more grievous and painful are the torments wherewith he torments them.” The third was this: “The name of Love is so sweet in the hearing that it would not seem possible for its effects to be other than sweet; seeing that the name must needs be like unto the thing named; as it is written: _Nomina sunt consequentia rerum._”[18] And the fourth was this: “The lady whom Love hath chosen out to govern thee is not as other ladies, whose hearts are easily moved.”    [18] “Names are the consequents of things.”  And by each one of these thoughts I was so sorely assailed that I was like unto him who doubteth which path to take, and wishing to go, goeth not. And if I bethought myself to seek out some point at the which all these paths might be found to meet, I discerned but one way, and that irked me; to wit, to call upon Pity, and to commend myself unto her. And it was then that, feeling a desire to write somewhat thereof in rhyme, I wrote this sonnet:—      All my thoughts always speak to me of Love,       Yet have between themselves such difference       That while one bids me bow with mind and sense,     A second saith, “Go to: look thou above;”     The third one, hoping, yields me joy enough;       And with the last come tears, I scarce know whence:       All of them craving pity in sore suspense,     Trembling with fears that the heart knoweth of.     And thus, being all unsure which path to take,       Wishing to speak I know not what to say,         And lose myself in amorous wanderings:     Until, (my peace with all of them to make,)       Unto mine enemy I needs must pray,         My Lady Pity, for the help she brings.  _This sonnet may be divided into four parts. In the first, I say and propound that all my thoughts are concerning Love. In the second, I say that they are diverse, and I relate their diversity. In the third, I say wherein they all seem to agree. In the fourth, I say that, wishing to speak of Love, I know not from which of these thoughts to take my argument; and that if I would take it from all, I shall have to call upon mine enemy, my Lady Pity. “Lady” I say, as in a scornful mode of speech. The second begins here, “Yet have between themselves;” the third, “All of them craving;” the fourth, “And thus.”_  After this battling with many thoughts, it chanced on a day that my most gracious lady was with a gathering of ladies in a certain place; to the which I was conducted by a friend of mine; he thinking to do me a great pleasure by showing me the beauty of so many women. Then I, hardly knowing whereunto he conducted me, but trusting in him (who yet was leading his friend to the last verge of life), made question: “To what end are we come among these ladies?” and he answered: “To the end that they may be worthily served.” And they were assembled around a gentlewoman who was given in marriage on that day; the custom of the city being that these should bear her company when she sat down for the first time at table in the house of her husband. Therefore I, as was my friend’s pleasure, resolved to stay with him and do honour to those ladies.  But as soon as I had thus resolved, I began to feel a faintness and a throbbing at my left side, which soon took possession of my whole body. Whereupon I remember that I covertly leaned my back unto a painting that ran round the walls of that house; and being fearful lest my trembling should be discerned of them, I lifted mine eyes to look on those ladies, and then first perceived among them the excellent Beatrice. And when I perceived her, all my senses were overpowered by the great lordship that Love obtained, finding himself so near unto that most gracious being, until nothing but the spirits of sight remained to me; and even these remained driven out of their own instruments because Love entered in that honoured place of theirs, that so he might the better behold her. And although I was other than at first, I grieved for the spirits so expelled, which kept up a sore lament, saying: “If he had not in this wise thrust us forth, we also should behold the marvel of this lady.” By this, many of her friends, having discerned my confusion, began to wonder; and together with herself, kept whispering of me and mocking me. Whereupon my friend, who knew not what to conceive, took me by the hands, and drawing me forth from among them, required to know what ailed me. Then, having first held me at quiet for a space until my perceptions were come back to me, I made answer to my friend: “Of a surety I have now set my feet on that point of life, beyond the which he must not pass who would return.”[19]    [19] It is difficult not to connect Dante’s agony at this        wedding-feast with our knowledge that in her twenty-first year        Beatrice was wedded to Simone de’ Bardi. That she herself was        the bride on this occasion might seem out of the question,        from the fact of its not being in any way so stated: but on        the other hand, Dante’s silence throughout the _Vita Nuova_        as regards her marriage (which must have brought deep sorrow        even to his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41085"],["title","The New Life (La Vita Nuova) (#5)"],["body","love) is so startling, that we might almost        be led to conceive in this passage the only intimation of it        which he thought fit to give.  Afterwards, leaving him, I went back to the room where I had wept before; and again weeping and ashamed, said: “If this lady but knew of my condition, I do not think that she would thus mock at me; nay, I am sure that she must needs feel some pity.” And in my weeping I bethought me to write certain words, in the which, speaking to her, I should signify the occasion of my disfigurement, telling her also how I knew that she had no knowledge thereof: which, if it were known, I was certain must move others to pity. And then, because I hoped that peradventure it might come into her hearing, I wrote this sonnet:—      Even as the others mock, thou mockest me;       Not dreaming, noble lady, whence it is       That I am taken with strange semblances,     Seeing thy face which is so fair to see:     For else, compassion would not suffer thee       To grieve my heart with such harsh scoffs as these.       Lo! Love, when thou art present, sits at ease,     And bears his mastership so mightily,     That all my troubled senses he thrusts out,       Sorely tormenting some, and slaying some,         Till none but he is left and has free range         To gaze on thee. This makes my face to change       Into another’s; while I stand all dumb,     And hear my senses clamour in their rout.  _This sonnet I divide not into parts, because a division is only made to open the meaning of the thing divided: and this, as it is sufficiently manifest through the reasons given, has no need of division. True it is that, amid the words whereby is shown the occasion of this sonnet, dubious words are to be found; namely, when I say that Love kills all my spirits, but that the visual remain in life, only outside of their own instruments. And this difficulty it is impossible for any to solve who is not in equal guise liege unto Love; and, to those who are so, that is manifest which would clear up the dubious words. And therefore it were not well for me to expound this difficulty, inasmuch as my speaking would be either fruitless or else superfluous._  A while after this strange disfigurement, I became possessed with a strong conception which left me but very seldom, and then to return quickly. And it was this: “Seeing that thou comest into such scorn by the companionship of this lady, wherefore seekest thou to behold her? If she should ask thee this thing, what answer couldst thou make unto her? yea, even though thou wert master of all thy faculties, and in no way hindered from answering.” Unto the which, another very humble thought said in reply: “If I were master of all my faculties, and in no way hindered from answering, I would tell her that no sooner do I image to myself her marvellous beauty than I am possessed with a desire to behold her, the which is of so great strength that it kills and destroys in my memory all those things which might oppose it; and it is therefore that the great anguish I have endured thereby is yet not enough to restrain me from seeking to behold her.” And then, because of these thoughts, I resolved to write somewhat, wherein, having pleaded mine excuse, I should tell her of what I felt in her presence. Whereupon I wrote this sonnet:—      The thoughts are broken in my memory,       Thou lovely Joy, whene’er I see thy face;       When thou art near me, Love fills up the space,     Often repeating, “If death irk thee, fly.”     My face shows my heart’s colour, verily,       Which, fainting, seeks for any leaning-place;       Till, in the drunken terror of disgrace,     The very stones seem to be shrieking, “Die!”     It were a grievous sin, if one should not       Strive then to comfort my bewildered mind         (Though merely with a simple pitying)     For the great anguish which thy scorn has wrought       In the dead sight o’ the eyes grown nearly blind,         Which look for death as for a blessed thing.  _This sonnet is divided into two parts. In the first, I tell the cause why I abstain not from coming to this lady. In the second, I tell what befalls me through coming to her; and this part begins here “When thou art near.” And also this second part divides into five distinct statements. For, in the first, I say what Love, counselled by Reason, tells me when I am near the lady. In the second, I set forth the state of my heart by the example of the face. In the third, I say how all ground of trust fails me. In the fourth, I say that he sins who shows not pity of me, which would give me some comfort. In the last, I say why people should take pity: namely, for the piteous look which comes into mine eyes; which piteous look is destroyed, that is, appeareth not unto others, through the jeering of this lady, who draws to the like action those who peradventure would see this piteousness. The second part begins here, “My face shows;” the third, “Till, in the drunken terror;” the fourth, “It were a grievous sin;” the fifth, “For the great anguish.”_  Thereafter, this sonnet bred in me desire to write down in verse four other things touching my condition, the which things it seemed to me that I had not yet made manifest. The first among these was the grief that possessed me very often, remembering the strangeness which Love wrought in me; the second was, how Love many times assailed me so suddenly and with such strength that I had no other life remaining except a thought which spake of my lady; the third was, how, when Love did battle with me in this wise, I would rise up all colourless, if so I might see my lady, conceiving that the sight of her would defend me against the assault of Love, and altogether forgetting that which her presence brought unto me; and the fourth was, how, when I saw her, the sight not only defended me not, but took away the little life that remained to me. And I said these four things in a sonnet, which is this:—      At whiles (yea oftentimes) I muse over       The quality of anguish that is mine       Through Love: then pity makes my voice to pine,     Saying, “Is any else thus, anywhere?”     Love smiteth me, whose strength is ill to bear;       So that of all my life is left no sign       Except one thought; and that, because ’tis thine,     Leaves not the body but abideth there.     And then if I, whom other aid forsook,       Would aid myself, and innocent of art         Would fain have sight of thee as a last hope,     No sooner do I lift mine eyes to look       Than the blood seems as shaken from my heart,         And all my pulses beat at once and stop.  _This sonnet is divided into four parts, four things being therein narrated; and as these are set forth above, I only proceed to distinguish the parts by their beginnings. Wherefore I say that the second part begins, “Love smiteth me;” the third, “And then if I;” the fourth, “No sooner do I lift.”_  After I had written these three last sonnets, wherein I spake unto my lady, telling her almost the whole of my condition, it seemed to me that I should be silent, having said enough concerning myself. But albeit I spake not to her again, yet it behoved me afterward to write of another matter, more noble than the foregoing. And for that the occasion of what I then wrote may be found pleasant in the hearing, I will relate it as briefly as I may.  Through the sore change in mine aspect, the secret of my heart was now understood of many. Which thing being thus, there came a day when certain ladies to whom it was well known (they having been with me at divers times in my trouble) were met together for the pleasure of gentle company. And as I was going that way by chance, (but I think rather by the will of fortune,) I heard one of them call unto me, and she that called was a lady of very sweet speech. And when I had come close up with them, and perceived that they had not among them mine excellent lady, I was reassured; and saluted them, asking of their pleasure. The ladies were many; divers of whom were laughing one to another, while divers gazed at me as though I should speak anon. But when I still spake not, one of them, who before had been talking with another, addressed me by my name, saying, “To what end lovest thou this lady, seeing that thou canst not support her presence? Now tell us this thing, that we may know it: for certainly the end of such a love must be worthy of knowledge.” And when she had spoken these words, not she only, but all they that were with her, began to observe me, waiting for my reply. Whereupon I said thus unto them:—”Ladies, the end and aim of my Love was but the salutation of that lady of whom I conceive that ye are speaking; wherein alone I found that beatitude which is the goal of desire. And now that it hath pleased her to deny me this, Love, my Master, of his great goodness, hath placed all my beatitude there where my hope will not fail me.” Then those ladies began to talk closely together; and as I have seen snow fall among the rain, so was their talk mingled with sighs. But after a little, that lady who had been the first to address me, addressed me again in these words: “We pray thee that thou wilt tell us wherein abideth this thy beatitude.” And answering, I said but thus much: “In those words that do praise my lady.” To the which she rejoined: “If thy speech were true, those words that thou didst write concerning thy condition would have been written with another intent.”  Then I, being almost put to shame because of her answer, went out from among them; and as I walked, I said within myself: “Seeing that there is so much beatitude in those words which do praise my lady, wherefore hath my speech of her been different?” And then I resolved that thenceforward I would choose for the theme of my writings only the praise of this most gracious being. But when I had thought exceedingly, it seemed to me that I had taken to myself a theme which was much too"]]]
