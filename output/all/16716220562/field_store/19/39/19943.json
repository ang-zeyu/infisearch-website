They covered--they fought over--the half of an acre. There were contending battalions fighting as masses in the center, while wings of fighting creatures to right and left were less solidly arranged. But reinforcements poured out of the mist from two directions, and momently the situation changed. Presently the battle covered an acre. Groups of fresh fighters arriving from the city to the right uttered shrill stridulations and charged upon the flank of their enemies. Simultaneously, reinforcements from the city to the left flung themselves into the fighting-line near the center.  Formations broke up. The battle disintegrated into an indefinite number of lesser combats; troops or regiments fighting together often moved ahead with an appearance of invincibility, but suddenly they broke and broke again until there was only a complete confusion of unorganized single combats in which the fighters rolled over and over, struggling ferociously with mandible and claw to destroy each other. Presently the battle raged over five acres. Ten. Thousands upon thousands of black, glistening, stinking creatures tore at each other in murderous ferocity. Whining, squealing battle-cries arose and almost drowned out the deeper notes of larger but invisible creatures off in the mist.  Moran and Harper got back to the _Nadine_ by a wide detour past warriors preoccupied with each other just before the battle reached its most savage stage. In that stage, the space-yacht was included in the battleground. Fights went on about its landing-fins. Horrifying duels could be followed by scrapings and bumpings against its hull. From the yacht's ports the fighting ants looked like infuriated machines, engaged in each other's destruction. One might see a warrior of unidentified allegiance with its own abdomen ripped open, furiously rending an enemy without regard to its own mortal wound. There were those who had literally been torn in half, so that only head and thorax remained, but they fought on no less valiantly than the rest.         *       *       *       *       *  At the edges of the fighting such cripples were more numerous. Ants with antenna shorn off or broken, with legs missing, utterly doomed,--they sometimes wandered forlornly beyond the fighting, the battle seemingly forgotten. But even such dazed and incapacitated casualties came upon each other. If they smelled alike, they ignored each other. Every ant-city has its particular smell which its inhabitants share. Possession of the national odor is at once a certificate of citizenship in peacetime and a uniform in war. When such victims of the battle came upon enemy walking wounded, they fought.  And the giant praying mantis remained placidly and invulnerably still. It plucked single fighters from the battle and dined upon them while they struggled, and plucked other fighters, and consumed them. It ignored the battle and the high purpose and self-sacrificing patriotism of the ants. Immune to them and disregarded by them, it fed on them while the battle raged.  Presently the gray light overhead turned faintly pink, and became a deeper tint and then crimson. In time there was darkness. The noise of battle ended. The sounds of the day diminished and ceased, and other monstrous outcries took their place.  There were bellowings in the blackness without the _Nadine_. There were chirpings become baritone, and senseless uproars which might be unbelievable modifications of once-shrill and once-tranquil night-sounds of other worlds. And there came a peculiar, steady, unrhythmic pattering sound. It seemed like something falling upon the blanket-like upper surface of the soil.  Moran opened the airlock door and thrust out a torch to see. Its intolerably bright glare showed the battlefield abandoned. Most of the dead and wounded had been carried away. Which, of course, was not solicitude for the wounded or reverence for the dead heroes. Dead ants, like dead centipedes, were booty of the only kind the creatures of this world could know. The dead were meat. The wounded were dead before they were carried away.  Moran peered out, with Carol looking affrightedly over his shoulder. The air seemed to shine slightly in the glare of the torch. The pattering sound was abruptly explained. Large, slow, widely-separated raindrops fell heavily and steadily from the cloud-banks overhead. Moran could see them strike. Each spot of wetness glistened briefly. Then the rain-drop was absorbed by the ground.  But there were other noises than the ceaseless tumult on the ground. There were sounds in the air; the beating of enormous wings. Moran looked up, squinting against the light. There were things moving about the black sky. Gigantic things.  Something moved, too, across the diminishingly lighted surface about the yacht. There were glitterings. Shining armor. Multi-faceted eyes. A gigantic, horny, spiked object crawled toward the torch-glare, fascinated by it. Something else dived insanely. It splashed upon the flexible white surface twenty yards away, and struggled upward and took crazily off again. It careened blindly.         *       *       *       *       *  It hit the yacht, a quarter-ton of night-flying beetle. The air seemed filled with flying things. There were moths with twenty-foot wings and eyes which glowed like rubies in the torch's light. There were beetles of all sizes from tiny six-inch things to monsters in whom Moran did not believe even when he saw them. All were drawn by the light which should not exist under the cloud-bank. They droned and fluttered and performed lunatic evolutions, coming always closer to the flame.  Moran cut off the torch and closed the lock-door from the inside.  \"We don't load bessendium tonight,\" he said with some grimness. \"To have no light, with what crawls about in the darkness, would be suicide. But to use lights would be worse. If you people are going to salvage the stuff in that wreck, you'll have to wait for daylight. At least then you can see what's coming after you.\"  They went into the yacht proper. There was no longer any question about the planet's air. If insects which were descendents of terrestrial forms could breathe it, so could men. When the first insect-eggs were brought here, the air had to be fit for them if they were to survive. It would not have changed.  Burleigh sat in the control-room with a double handful of purple crystals before him.  \"This,\" he said when Moran and Carol reÃ«ntered, \"this is bessendium past question. I've been thinking what it means.\"  \"Money,\" said Moran drily. \"You'll all be rich. You'll probably retire from politics.\"  \"That wasn't exactly what I had in mind,\" said Burleigh distastefully. \"You've gotten us into the devil of a mess, Moran!\"  \"For which,\" said Moran with ironic politeness, \"there is a perfect solution. You kill me, either directly or by leaving me marooned here.\"  Burleigh scowled.  \"We have to land at space-ports for supplies. We can't hope to hide you, it's required that landed ships be sterilized against infections from off-planet. We can't pass you as a normal passenger. You're not on the ship's papers and they're alteration-proof. Nobody's ever been able to change a ship's papers and not be caught! We could land and tell the truth, that you hijacked the ship and we finally overpowered you. But there are reasons against that.\"  \"Naturally!\" agreed Moran. \"I'd be killed anyhow and you'd be subject to intensive investigation. And you're fugitives as much as I am.\"  \"Just so,\" admitted Burleigh.  Moran shrugged.  \"Which leaves just one answer. You maroon me and go on your way.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Burleigh said painfully;  \"There's this bessendium. If there's more--especially if there's more--we can leave you here with part of it. When we get far enough away, we charter a ship to come and get you. It'll be arranged. Somebody will be listed as of that ship's company, but he'll slip away from the space-port and not be on board at all. Then you're picked up and landed using his name.\"  \"If,\" said Moran ironically, \"I am alive when the ship gets here. If I'm not, the crew of the chartered ship will be in trouble, short one man on return to port. You'll have trouble getting anybody to run that risk!\"  \"We're trying to work out a way to save you!\" insisted Burleigh angrily. \"Harper would have been killed but for you. And--this bessendium will finance the underground work that will presently make a success of our revolution. We're grateful! We're trying to help you!\"  \"So you maroon me,\" said Moran. Then he said; \"But you've skipped the real problem! If anything goes wrong, Carol's in it! There's no way to do anything without risk for her! That's the problem! I could kill all you characters, land somewhere on a colonized planet exactly as you landed here, and be gone from the yacht on foot before anybody could find me! But I have a slight aversion to getting a girl killed or killing her just for my own convenience. It's settled. I stay here. You can try to arrange the other business if you like. But it's a bad gamble.\"  Carol was very pale. Burleigh stood up.  \"You said that, I didn't. But I don't think we should leave you here. Up near the ice-cap should be infinitely better for you. We'll load the rest of the bessendium tomorrow, find you a place, leave you a beacon, and go.\"  He went out. Carol turned a white face to Moran.  \"Is that--is that the real trouble? Do you really--\"  Moran looked at her stonily.  \"I like to make heroic gestures,\" he told her. \"Actually, Burleigh's a very noble sort of character himself. He proposes to leave me with treasure that he could take. Even more remarkably, he proposes to divide up what you take, instead of applying it all to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43046"],["title","Planet of Dread (#6)"],["body","his political ideals. Most men like him would take it all for the revolution!\"  \"But--but--.\"  Carol's expression was pure misery. Moran walked deliberately across the control-room. He glanced out of a port. A face looked in. It filled the transparent opening. It was unthinkable. It was furry. There were glistening chitinous areas. There was a proboscis like an elephant's trunk, curled horribly. The eyes were multiple and mad.  It looked in, drawn and hypnotized by the light shining out on this nightmare world from the control-room ports.  Moran touched the button that closed the shutters.   III.  When morning came, its arrival was the exact reversal of the coming of night. In the beginning there was darkness, and in the darkness there was horror.  The creatures of the night untiringly filled the air with sound, and the sounds were discordant and gruesome and revolting. The creatures of this planet were gigantic. They should have adopted new customs appropriate to the dignity of their increased size. But they hadn't. The manners and customs of insects are immutable. They feed upon specific prey--spiders are an exception, but they are not insects at all--and they lay their eggs in specific fashion in specific places, and they behave according to instincts which are so detailed as to leave them no choice at all in their actions. They move blindly about, reacting like automata of infinite complexity which are capable of nothing not built into them from the beginning. Centuries and millenia do not change them. Travel across star-clusters leaves them with exactly the capacities for reaction that their remotest ancestors had, before men lifted off ancient Earth's green surface.  The first sign of dawn was deep, deep, deepest red in the cloud-bank no more than fifteen hundred feet overhead. The red became brighter, and presently was as brilliant as dried blood. Again presently it was crimson over all the half-mile circle that human eyes could penetrate. Later still--but briefly--it was pink. Then the sky became gray. From that color it did not change again.  Moran joined Burleigh in a survey of the landscape from the control-room. The battlefield was empty now. Of the thousands upon thousands of stinking combatants who'd rent and torn each other the evening before, there remained hardly a trace. Here and there, to be sure, a severed saw-toothed leg remained. There were perhaps as many as four relatively intact corpses not yet salvaged. But something was being done about them.  There were tiny, brightly-banded beetles hardly a foot long which labored industriously over such frayed objects. They worked agitatedly in the yeasty stuff which on this world took the place of soil. They excavated, beneath the bodies of the dead ants, hollows into which those carcasses could descend. They pushed the yeasty, curdy stuff up and around the sides of those to-be-desired objects. The dead warriors sank little by little toward oblivion as the process went on. The up-thrust, dug-out material collapsed upon them as they descended. In a very little while they would be buried where no larger carrion-eater would discover them, and then the brightly-colored sexton beetles would begin a banquet to last until only fragments of chitinous armor remained.         *       *       *       *       *  But Moran and Burleigh, in the _Nadine's_ control-room, could hardly note such details.  \"You saw the cargo,\" said Burleigh, frowning. \"How's it packed? The bessendium, I mean.\"  \"It's in small boxes too heavy to be handled easily,\" said Moran. \"Anyhow the _Malabar's_ crew broke some of them open to load the stuff on their lifeboats.\"  \"The lifeboats are all gone?\"  \"Naturally,\" said Moran. \"At a guess they'd have used all of them even if they didn't need them for the crew. They could carry extra food and weapons and such.\"  \"How much bessendium is left?\"  \"Probably twenty boxes unopened,\" said Moran. \"I can't guess at the weight, but it's a lot. They opened six boxes.\" He paused. \"I have a suggestion.\"  \"What?\"  \"When you've supplied yourselves,\" said Moran, \"leave some space-port somewhere with papers saying you're going to hunt for minerals on some plausible planet. You can get such a clearance. Then you can return with bessendium coming out of the _Nadine's_ waste-pipes and people will be surprised but not suspicious. You'll file for mineral rights, and cash your cargo. Everybody will get busy trying to grab off the mineral rights for themselves. You can clear out and let them try to find the bessendium lode. You'll be allowed to go, all right, and you can settle down somewhere rich and highly respected.\"  \"Hmmm,\" said Burleigh. Then he said uncomfortably; \"One wonders about the original owners of the stuff.\"  \"After a hundred and fifty years,\" said Moran, \"who'd you divide with? The insurance company that paid for the lost ship? The heirs of the crew? How'd you find them?\" Then he added amusedly, \"Only revolutionists and enemies of governments would be honest enough to worry about that!\"  Brawn came into the control-room. He said broodingly that breakfast was ready. Moran had never heard him speak in a normally cheerful voice. When he went out, Moran said;  \"I don't suppose he'll be so gloomy when he's rich!\"  \"His family was wiped out,\" said Burleigh curtly, \"by the government we were fighting. The girl he was going to marry, too.\"  \"Then I take back what I said,\" said Moran ruefully.         *       *       *       *       *  They went down to breakfast. Carol served it. She did not look well. Her eyes seemed to show that she'd been crying. But she treated Moran exactly like anyone else. Harper was very quiet, too. He took very seriously the fact that Moran had saved his life at the risk of his on the day before. Brawn breakfasted in a subdued, moody fashion. Only Hallet seemed to have reacted to the discovery of a salvageable shipment of bessendium that should make everybody rich,--everybody but Moran, who was ultimately responsible for the find.  \"Burleigh,\" said Hallet expansively, \"says the stuff you brought back from the wreck is worth fifty thousand credits, at least. What's the whole shipment worth?\"  \"I've no idea,\" said Moran. \"It would certainly pay for a fleet of space-liners, and I'd give all of it for a ticket on one of them.\"  \"But how much is there in bulk?\" insisted Hallet.  \"I saw that half a dozen boxes had been broken open and emptied for the lifeboat voyagers,\" Moran told him. \"I didn't count the balance, but there were several times as many untouched. If they're all full of the same stuff, you can guess almost any sum you please.\"  \"Millions, eh?\" said Hallet. His eyes glistened. \"Billions? Plenty for everybody?\"  \"There's never plenty for more than one,\" said Moran mildly. \"That's the way we seem to be made.\"  Burleigh said suddenly;  \"I'm worried about getting the stuff aboard. We can't afford to lose anybody, and if we have to fight the creatures here and every time we kill one its carcass draws others.\"  Moran took a piece of bread. He said;  \"I've been thinking about survival-tactics for myself as a castaway. I think a torch is the answer. In any emergency on the yeast surface, I can burn a hole and drop down in it. The monsters are stupid. In most cases they'll go away because they stop seeing me. In the others, they'll come to the hole and I'll burn them. It won't be pleasant, but it may be practical.\"  Burleigh considered it.  \"It may be,\" he admitted. \"It may be.\"  Hallet said;  \"I want to see that work before I trust the idea.\"  \"Somebody has to try it,\" agreed Moran. \"Anyhow my life's going to depend on it.\"  Carol left the room. Moran looked after her as the door closed.  \"She doesn't like the idea of our leaving you behind,\" said Burleigh. \"None of us do.\"  \"I'm touched.\"  \"We'll try to get a ship to come for you, quickly,\" said Burleigh.  \"I'm sure you will,\" said Moran politely.         *       *       *       *       *  But he was not confident. The laws governing space-travel were very strict indeed, and enforced with all the rigor possible. On their enforcement, indeed, depended the law and order of the planets. Criminals had to know that they could not escape to space whenever matters got too hot for them aground. For a spaceman to trifle with interstellar-traffic laws meant at the least that they were grounded for life. But the probabilities were much worse than that. It was most likely that Burleigh or any of the others would be reported to space-port police instantly they attempted to charter a ship for any kind of illegal activity. Moran made a mental note to warn Burleigh about it.  By now, though, he was aware of a very deep irritation at the idea of being killed, whether by monsters on this planet or men sent to pick him up for due process of law. When he made the grand gesture of seizing the _Nadine_, he'd known nothing about the people on board, and he hadn't really expected to succeed. His real hope was to be killed without preliminary scientific questioning. Modern techniques of interrogation were not torture, but they stripped away all concealments of motive and to a great degree revealed anybody who'd helped one. Moran had killed a man in a fair fight the other man did not want to engage in. If he were caught on Coryus or returned to it, his motivation could be read from his mind. And if that was done the killing--and the sacrifice of his own future and life--would have been useless. But he'd been prepared to be killed. Even now he'd prefer to die here on Tethys than in the strictly painless manner of executions on Coryus. But he was now deeply resistant to the idea of dying at all. There was Carol....  He thrust such thoughts aside.         *       *       *       *       *  Morning was well begun when they prepared to transfer the wreck's treasure to the _Nadine_. Moran went first. At fifteen-foot intervals he burned holes in the curd-like, elastic ground-cover. Some of the holes went "]]]
