In a flash, Dave dived after him, but the attacker seemed full of coiled steel springs. He was up on his feet in a flash and speeding down the badly lighted street. Impulsively Dave streaked his hand to where his holstered service gun should have been. Only it wasn't there. It was back in the bureau drawer in his hotel room! He took a couple of leaping steps after the fleeing shadow, but checked himself and swerved sharply as a second shadow virtually flew past him. He shot out his hands, got hold of jacketcloth, but all the good that did him was that he ripped off a piece of a jacket as the second shadow went by him and down the street.  \"Dave! You all right?\"  He turned to see Freddy Farmer at his elbow. The English youth was breathing hard, and fingering the right side of his jaw.  \"I'm okay, but boiling!\" Dave grated. \"I had my bird cold, so I thought. But he must be made of rubber. I couldn't stay with him. What's the matter with your jaw?\"  \"The blighter's head!\" Freddy Farmer muttered. \"We connected violently. Say, Dave! Those beggars had knives. There's one! And there's the other. Phew! Wicked-looking things, aren't they?\"  The English youth had stooped down and retrieved two knives out of the gutter. In the bad light Dave and Freddy saw that they were mates. Each was about seven inches long, razor sharp, and with a needle point. Dave squinted at them and whistled softly.  \"You see what I see, Freddy?\" he breathed. \"They had knives exactly like those at the Commando school! Looks like a couple of thugs stole a couple.\"  \"But as you said, Dave,\" Freddy cried, \"this is New York! I know your underworld characters use machine guns, and such. But do they also go about the streets knifing people to steal their purses?\"  Dave didn't reply at once. He stood scowling down at the pair of knives, as cold, clammy chills started rippling up and down his spine. He knew full well that anything can happen in New York City, and usually does in time. But to be knifed for the few dollars he carried, instead of being blackjacked, or held up at the point of a gun, was something that just didn't jell right in his brain. He also was hit by another equally disturbing thought. The light had been so bad, and the action so swift and short lived, he hadn't got so much as a flash glimpse at either of the attackers. But for general build--well, he couldn't help but think of the two hard-faced men back in the hotel dining room.  \"I'm nuts, completely nuts!\" he chided himself aloud. \"It just couldn't have been!\"  \"What couldn't have been?\" Freddy Farmer wanted to know.  \"Those two, just now,\" Dave replied. \"I had the flash thought that they might have been that hard-faced pair in the dining room. But they didn't come at us from behind. They were ahead of us. Besides, they left before we did. Well, which of these do you want for a souvenir?\"  \"Neither,\" Freddy replied. \"I suggest we turn them over to Colonel Welsh. Those are Commando knives, right enough. He might be interested to know that some of your American underworld chaps also carry them.\"  \"Or--\" Dave started to say, and then stopped himself with a snort of disgust. \"Doggone, but my imagination is going haywire tonight! Must be something I ate.\"  \"You don't think they were underworld beggars?\" the English youth demanded. \"Good grief! You're not thinking of Nazi agents, are you?\"  \"Well, I did give it a whirl for a second or two,\" Dawson confessed with a shrug. \"But that's plain silly. No Nazi agents should have any interest in us, right now.\"  \"I don't know about that,\" Freddy grunted as they started along the street again. \"The Gestapo beggars are quite keen about revenge killings, you know. And we've been lucky enough to send a few of them to where they belong in days gone by.\"  \"Okay, Nazi agents!\" Dave snorted. \"They read those route instructions before we did, and were waiting for us in the dark doorway! See? It doesn't make sense, Freddy. It's all cockeyed to drag Nazi agents into this thing.\"  \"You're right, of course,\" the English youth murmured. \"But all I can say is, praise the good Lord for our Commando training. I'm still shuddering, thinking of one of those things slicing into my hide. And my beggar almost got me, I'll frankly confess.\"  \"Well, mine didn't exactly send me a letter,\" Dave echoed. \"I'm sore we didn't stop them, though. After that scare it would have done me a world of good to go to work on his mug. Well, one thing, and that's final. From now on I'm not going to leave my gun parked in a bureau drawer. Let the public laugh and snicker. If I'd had it, I could have clipped that bird in the leg and brought him down. But, boy! What a pair of broken field runners they were!\"  \"Let's try and forget about them, if you don't mind,\" Freddy said with a little shudder. \"And let's put on a bit of speed. My nerves never were of the best, you know.\"  The remark brought a laugh from Dave.  \"Listen to him lie, will you!\" he cried. \"Pal, if your nerves aren't the best I ever came across, then I'm Uncle Bay-Window Goering. But I was just about to suggest, myself, that we get over on Tenth Avenue where there's more light and fewer darkened doorways. Not too fast, though. I've still got some jelly in my knee joints.\"  The rest of the trip, though, was made without incident or accident. And in due time they were standing in front of a five storied brick building that was Number 697 River Street. The street was dimmed out like all the rest, but it wasn't half so dark as had been Cort Street. Also, there were plenty of people passing by on the sidewalks. They stared up at the building front in silence for a moment. It showed only one lighted room, and that was on the third floor.  \"Well let's go up the steps and push Mr. Brown's bell button,\" Dave eventually grunted. \"There's an entryway light there, so we should be able to find it. Let's go.\"  They went up the stone steps to the small outer foyer that contained a double row of bell buttons. They found the one that had \"Brown\" printed on the plate card, and Dave stabbed it with his thumb. They didn't hear the ring inside, and for a couple of minutes they stood there just waiting.  \"Give it another go, Dave,\" Freddy suggested.  Dawson lifted his hand, but froze it in mid-air as the shadow of a figure appeared on the other side of the door. There was the sound of a locking bolt being shot, and a key being turned. Then the door was pulled inward to reveal the figure on the other side. Both Dave and Freddy gulped and stared. Standing in the lighted doorway was a Sergeant of infantry, complete with side-arms. The Sergeant flashed them both a searching look, then stepped back, opening the door wider.  \"Come in, sirs,\" he said. \"And follow me, please.\"     CHAPTER THREE  _Eastward To War_   For a long minute Dave and Freddy just stood there and stared at the infantry Sergeant as though he were something escaped from a museum. Then they snapped out of their collective trance and stepped in through the door. It was then that Freddy let the question pop off his lips before he could stop it.  \"Is Colonel Welsh here, Sergeant?\" he asked.  The non-commissioned officer looked at him with a faint puzzled frown.  \"Colonel Welsh, sir?\" he echoed. Then, shaking his head, \"No, sir. There's no Colonel Welsh here. My orders are to take you to Major Barber. Follow me, please.\"  The two flying aces exchanged looks, shrugged, and then followed the Sergeant up the stairs. On the landing of the third floor the Sergeant turned right along a hallway and finally came to a stop in front of the fifth door down on the right. He motioned politely for Dave and Freddy to wait, then knocked and went inside.  \"I don't think I like this, Dave!\" Freddy whispered when they were left alone. \"You heard him say that Colonel Welsh wasn't here. What the devil do you suppose is up?\"  \"Your guess is as good as mine,\" Dawson replied with a scowl. \"I'm beginning to suspect, though, that it's something very hush-hush. I still wish I hadn't left my service gun in the hotel. Here, Freddy. I'm probably acting silly, but you never can tell.\"  As Dave spoke the last he fished out one of the Commando knives and slipped it into Freddy Farmer's hand. The English youth took it without a word and let it slide into his pocket out of sight.  \"Think we're foolish to wait here, Dave?\" he breathed a moment later. \"After what's happened tonight, we may be simply asking for more trouble. It's certainly a mixed up mess.\"  \"Plenty screwy,\" Dave grunted with a nod. \"But I'm a curious cuss. And I'm just sore enough to follow this whole cockeyed business through to the end. But keep on guard, Freddy. Back to back, pal, and so forth.\"  \"Quite!\" Freddy grated, and hunched his shoulders as though to get himself set to spring at a split second's notice.  Another minute, and the door opened and the Sergeant reappeared. He pulled the door wide, stood to one side and motioned for the two air aces to enter. They stepped through into a plainly furnished outer office. The Sergeant closed the door, walked past them and opened a door on the right.  \"In there, sirs,\" he said. \"Major Barber is waiting.\"  \"And just who is Major Barber?\" Freddy Farmer demanded, and didn't move.  The Sergeant started to grin but cut it off instantly.  \"He'll tell you, sir,\" he said. \"Go in, please.\"  The two youths hesitated a fraction of a second longer; then by mutual accord they stepped through the second door and into a smaller office. It contained a desk, a few chairs, a filing cabinet or two, and a lone picture of President Roosevelt on the wall. Seated at the desk was an iron gray-haired Major in the uniform of infantry staff. He smiled and rose from his chair as they entered.  \"Evening, Captains Dawson and Farmer,\" he said, and extended his hand. \"Glad to see you here. Sit down, both of you.\"  The two youths shook hands with him, and then settled themselves in chairs."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42250"],["title","Dave Dawson with the Commandos (#3)"],["body","Major reseated himself and rearranged a few papers on his desk. Dave watched him closely, and spun his brain in an effort to try and figure out just what the picture was this time. Presently the Major looked up and gave them both a quizzical smile.  \"Of course you're not wondering anything, are you?\" he asked with a faint chuckle. \"Any trouble on the way down here?\"  Dave stiffened slightly. Things began to click a little in his head. He gave the senior officer a long searching look.  \"No, not a thing, Major,\" he lied quietly. Then with a little gesture of one hand, \"Should something have happened?\"  That seemed to please the Major, for he grinned broadly. A moment later he took a card from his pocket and passed it across the desk.  \"Time to unmask, I guess,\" he said. \"There's my identification. You can both relax. Sorry things had to be so mysterious, but that's the way we have to work sometimes.\"  Dave took the card and held it so Freddy Farmer could see it also. He took one look, gulped, and shot a quick glance at the grinning man in infantry staff uniform. The card, which contained a small picture, plus a left thumb print, stated that the holder was one Major E. J. Barber, officer in charge of all Commando units in training in the United States. It was signed by General Marshall, and also by Colonel Welsh.  The name was suddenly very familiar to Dave, but he couldn't place it exactly for a moment. Freddy Farmer beat him to it.  \"I say!\" he gasped. \"Major Barber! Of course! You served originally with the British, sir. You helped build the original British Commando force. You won the Military Cross, and the Distinguished Service Order for those first Commando raids on Occupied Norway. And now--?\"  Freddy stopped as though embarrassed at blurting out so much. The senior officer widened his grin and nodded.  \"You've unmasked me, Farmer,\" he said. \"That's right. And now that Uncle Sam is in it, I'm fighting under my own country's flag. But that's just the same as fighting under England's flag. From now on the two countries are going to become more and more like one big country, I think. Well, satisfied with my identity now, eh?\"  Dave gravely handed back the card, and looked at the man.  \"So it was a test?\" he murmured, and placed the captured Commando knife on the desk with his other hand. \"Do I feel a sap! That idea never even occurred to me. But they were as near the real thing as I ever hope to see. Thank goodness I wasn't carrying side-arms!\"  \"Eh?\" Freddy Farmer ejaculated, pop-eyed. \"A test...? Good grief! You mean those two chaps who had a go at us tonight? But I say--!\"  The English-born air ace couldn't go on. He stopped abruptly and shook his head in stunned bewilderment. And as though his brain didn't realize what his hand was doing, he took out his own Commando knife and placed it on the table beside Dave's. Major Barber picked them both up and gently tapped the needle points against a fingernail as he looked admiringly at the two youths.  \"Check and double check,\" he finally said. \"That's just what happened. And I might add, you almost caused two of my best men to resign from the Commando service, or the Rangers, as it will become known as time goes on. Tonight was the first time that either of them had lost their knives. They were on the phone just a few minutes before you arrived. They declared that if there were any more like you two I wanted tested, I'd have to get somebody else. In fact, they begged me for a couple of days' leave to rest up from the rough going over you gave them. My congratulations!\"  \"Thanks, sir,\" Dave mumbled as he suddenly had a funny feeling in the stomach. \"Holy smoke! If I'd been able to keep my grip on my man, I'm afraid I'd have broken his arm right off, and probably his neck. But a test! Why? I mean--that is--well, you do this sort of thing often, sir? I mean--\"  Dave stopped and floundered about for suitable words. The Major tossed the two knives on the desk and leaned forward.  \"Not every day, Dawson,\" he said quietly. \"But often enough. Let me explain. As yet our Commando units are not organized or completely whipped into shape for action as all-American units. Some, however, who have gone through the training have shown that they are as good as they'll ever be, short of actual experience against the enemy. Those men we pick out and send across to get that actual service with operating British Commando units. With that action experience under their belts, they make fine instructors for the units we are sending over to England for final polishing up.\"  The Major paused to catch his breath and clear his throat.  \"Each man selected for immediate active service is ordered to report to me here,\" he continued presently. \"He does not know that he is reporting for Commando duty, so the last thing he's thinking of is an attack upon his person here in New York City. That way I can tell for sure if he is the man that I want to send across in advance of the regular Commando forces. My two men, both of whom have seen actual Commando service with me, carry out the test and report to me. Up until tonight they rather enjoyed their work. They're tough, and they can take a lot of punishment. But it seems you two gave them a little extra to take tonight.\"  As the senior officer paused, both Dave and Freddy continued to sit silent and motionless. To tell the truth, their brains were spinning just a little too much to make comment possible. But in a few seconds Freddy managed to unhinge his tongue.  \"So--so we're going across for Commando duty, sir?\" he blurted out. \"But I thought this Commando training was just a--well, a stopover between jobs Colonel Welsh had for us. I--\"  \"Hold everything, Farmer!\" Major Barber laughed, and held up a hand. \"I know you two are airmen, and it's the air where you shine the best. But--well, this is a bit different from my regular procedure. You're not going across as strictly Commando material. No, that's not right, either. You'll be all Commando. Don't worry about that. But in addition, there'll be an extra little assignment for you two to carry out.\"  \"Sounds interesting, sir,\" Dave said eagerly, as the other paused. \"What's the extra little assignment?\"  The smile faded from Major Barber's face, and he shook his head vigorously.  \"No soap, Dawson,\" he said. \"You're not going to find that out right now. In fact, not until after you have arrived in England. And incidentally, you're leaving for England tonight.\"  Coming right on top of everything else that had happened, the Major's last statement brought both boys up straight in their chairs. They exchanged wide-eyed glances, and then focussed their gaze on the senior officer again.  \"Leaving for England tonight?\" Freddy Farmer echoed breathlessly. \"I say! That's wonderful! Positively marvelous!\"  \"Figured it might please you, Farmer,\" Major Barber said with a smile. \"Yes, all _three_ of us are leaving for England tonight. You'll have me for company, if you can stand it, as far as Botwood, in Newfoundland. An Army bomber is waiting at Mitchel Field for us right now. At Botwood, though, we'll part company. At Botwood you two will get further orders.\"  The Commando chief paused for a moment and stared thoughtfully down at the desk top. Eventually he raised his eyes and gave a little half shrug.  \"I don't want you two to be too much in the dark,\" he said slowly, \"so I'll tell you that this show, if carried out successfully, will have a marked bearing on whether or not the United Nations open up that second front that everybody is yelling their heads off about. And--take it as a sincere compliment, if you wish--a good chunk of that success is going to rest on your youthful shoulders.\"  \"Well, that clears up everything, sir,\" Dave said with a grin. \"Now we know what this is _all_ about.\"  \"Stop fishing, Dawson,\" Major Barber chuckled at him. \"It won't do you the least bit of good. Not that I don't trust you two as much as I'd trust my own father and mother. But that's not the point. As we all know, the fewer who know about a surprise, the more of a surprise it is. And I definitely want this little business to _be_ a surprise to Hitler and his bunch of cutthroats. So until the time is ripe, nobody is being told a thing about anything.\"  Grave and serious as the conversation was, Dave couldn't stop the smile that tugged at his lips. The Major spotted it and cocked an eyebrow.  \"Something strike you funny, Dawson?\" he asked.  \"No, not funny, sir,\" Dave replied instantly. Then with a flash side glance at Freddy's intent and grave face, he went on, \"I agree with you that it's best to wait until the time is right for final instructions. Besides snoring something terrible, Farmer, here, often talks in his sleep.\"  It was just the thing needed to ease the mounting tension. Major Barber burst into gales of laughter, and Freddy Farmer practically shot straight up out of his seat, and turned all the colors of the rainbow. Dave put out a protective hand.  \"Take it easy, pal!\" he cried. \"I've got a witness to anything you do. Better wait until we're alone.\"  The red remained in Freddy's cheeks, but he made no move toward Dave. He simply regarded him with scorn, rather like something the cat had dragged in. Then he looked at Major Barber.  \"Your two test men gave you a complete report on tonight's little affair, sir?\" he asked. \"They told you everything?\"  The senior officer blinked, and stared at Freddy as though trying to find out what was behind the words.  \"Why, yes, I believe so,\" he said. \"But was there something they left out?\"  Freddy looked at Dave with friendly pity in his eyes.  \"I'm sorry, Dave,\" he said quietly. \"I know I promised, but--well, that last remark from you deserves the punishment of the truth. Sorry, and all that. But you asked for it, old man.\"  \"Say, what is this?\" Major Barber demanded, leaning forward. \"What truth about Dawson?\"  \"Then they didn't tell you that part, sir?\" Freddy"]]]
