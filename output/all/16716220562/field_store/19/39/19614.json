Simultaneously, fifty men in turtle-neck sweaters and caps appeared from nowhere on Center Street. Half of them barricaded the street, firing on citizens and cops who came too close. The others systematically looted every store between the barricade and the beach.  Blinking a flashlight in code, the commander approached the deadline unmolested and was let through with Wyman at his heels. The goods, the raiders, the commander and Wyman were aboard a submarine by 2:35 and under way ten minutes later.  After Commander Grinnel had exchanged congratulations with the sub commander, he presented Wyman.  \"A recruit. Normally I wouldn't have bothered, but he had a rather special motivation. He could be very useful.\"  The sub commander studied Wyman impersonally. \"If he's not a plant.\"  \"I've used my ring. If you want to get it over with, we can test him and swear him in now.\"  They strapped him into a device that recorded pulse, perspiration, respiration, muscle-tension and brainwaves. A sweatered specialist came and mildly asked Wyman matter-of-fact questions about his surroundings while he calibrated the polygraph.  Then came the pay-off. Wyman did not fail to note that the sub commander loosened his gun in his holster when the questioning began.  \"Name, age and origin?\"  \"Max Wyman. Twenty-two. Buffalo Syndic Territory.\"  \"Do you like the Syndic?\"  \"I hate them.\"  \"What are your feelings toward the North American Government?\"  \"If it's against the Syndic, I'm for it.\"  \"Would you rob for the North American Government?\"  \"I would.\"  \"Would you kill for it?\"  \"I would.\"  \"Have you any reservations yet unstated in your answers?\"  \"No.\"  It went on for an hour. The questions were re-phrased continuously; after each of Wyman's firm answers, the sweatered technician gave a satisfied little nod. At last it ended and he was unstrapped from the device.  Max was tired.  The sub commander seemed a little awed as he got a small book and read from it: \"Do you, Max Wyman, solemnly renounce all allegiances previously held by you and pledge your allegiance to the North American Government?\"  \"I do,\" the young man said fiercely.  In a remote corner of his mind, for the first time in months, the bell ceased to ring, the pendulum to beat and the light to flash.  Charles Orsino knew again who he was and what was his mission.     VII   It had begun when the girl led him through the conference room door. Naturally one had misgivings; naturally one didn't speak up. But the vault-like door far downstairs was terrifying when it yawned before you and even more so when it closed behind you.  \"What is this place?\" he demanded at last. \"Who are you?\"  She said: \"Psychology lab.\"  It produced on him the same effect that \"alchemy section\" or \"Division of astrology\" would have on a well-informed young man in 1950. He repeated flatly: \"Psychology lab. If you don't want to tell me, very well. I volunteered without strings.\" Which should remind her that he was a sort of hero and should be treated with a certain amount of dignity and that she could save her corny jokes.  \"I meant it,\" she said, fiddling busily with the locks of yet another vault-like door. \"I'm a psychologist. I'm also by the way, Lee Falcaro--since you asked.\"  \"The old man--Edward Falcaro's line?\" he asked.  \"Simon pure. He's my father's brother. Father's down in Miami, handling the tracks and gaming in general.\"  The second big door opened on a brain-gray room whose air had a curiously dead feel to it. \"Sit down,\" she said, indicating a very unorthodox chair. He did, and found that the chair was the most comfortable piece of furniture he had ever known. Its contact with his body was so complete that it pressed nowhere, it poked nowhere. The girl studied dials in its back nevertheless and muttered something about adjusting it. He protested.  \"Nonsense,\" she said decisively. She sat down herself in an ordinary seat. Charles shifted uneasily in his chair to find that it moved with him. Still no pressure, still no poking.  \"You're wondering,\" she began, \"about the word 'psychology'. It has a bad history and people have given it up as a bad job. It's true that there isn't pressure nowadays to study the human mind. People get along. In general what they want they get, without crippling effort. In your uncle Frank Taylor's language, the Syndic is an appropriately-structured organization of high morale and wide public acceptance. In my language the Syndic is a father-image which does a good job of fathering. In good times, people aren't introspective.  \"There is, literally, no reason why my line of the family should have kept up a tradition of experimental psychology. Way, way back, old Amadeo Falcaro often consulted Professor Oscar Sternweiss of the Columbia University psychology faculty--he wasn't as much of a dashing improvisor as the history books make him out to be. Eventually one of his daughters married one of Sternweiss' sons and inherited the Sternweiss notebooks and library and apparatus. It became an irrational custom to keep it alive. When each academic school of psychology managed to prove that every other school of psychology was dead wrong and psychology collapsed as a science, the family tradition was unaffected; it stood outside the wrangling.  \"Now, you're wondering what this has to do with trying to slip you into the Government.\"  \"I am,\" Charles said fervently. If she'd been a doll outside the Syndic, he would minutes ago have protested that all this was foolish and walked out. Since she was not only in the Syndic, but in the Falcaro line, he had no choice except to hear her babble and _then_ walk out. It was all rot, psychology. Id, oversoul, mind-vectors, counseling, psychosomatics--rot from sick-minded old men. Everybody knew--  \"The Government, we know, uses deinhibiting drugs as a first screening of its recruits. As an infallible second screening, they use a physiological lie-detector based on the fact that telling a lie causes tensions in the liar's body. We shall get around this by slipping you in as a young man who hates the Syndic for some valid reason--\"  \"Confound it, you were just telling me that they can't be fooled!\"  \"We won't fool them. You'll _be_ a young man who hates the Syndic. We'll tear down your present personality a gray cell at a time. We'll pump you full of Seconal every day for a quarter of a year.... We'll obliterate your personality under a new one. We'll bury Charles Orsino under a mountain of suggestions, compulsions and obsessions shoveled at you sixteen hours a day while you're too groggy to resist. Naturally the supplanting personality will be neurotic, but that works in with the mission.\"  He struggled with a metaphysical concept, for the first time in his life. \"But--but--how will I know I'm _me_?\"  \"We think we can put a trigger on it. When you take the Government oath of allegiance, you should bounce back.\"  He did not fail to note a little twin groove between her brows that appeared when she said _think_ and _should_. He knew that in a sense he was nearer death now than when Halloran's bullet had been intercepted.  \"Are you staying with it?\" she asked simply.  Various factors entered into it. _A life for the Syndic_, as in the children's history books. That one didn't loom very large. But multiply it by _it sounds like more fun than hot-rod polo_, and that by _this is going to raise my stock sky-high with the family_ and you had something. Somehow, under Lee Falcaro's interested gaze, he neglected to divide it by _if it works_.  \"I'm staying with it,\" he said.  She grinned. \"It won't be too hard,\" she said. \"In the old days there would have been voting record, social security numbers, military service, addresses they could check on--hundreds of things. Now about all we have to fit you with is a name and a subjective life.\"  It began that spring day and went on into late fall.  The ringing bell.  The flashing light.  The wobbling pendulum.  You are Max Wyman of Buffalo Syndic Territory. You are Max Wyman of Buffalo Syndic Territory. You are Max Wyman of Buffalo Syndic....

It was the tenth day of September, 1940, and the most glorious summer the British had experienced in forty years was still very much in evidence. The sun was a brassy ball in the heavens that flooded the earth with a warm comforting glow. The birds, the bees, and the butterflies were all around. And the emerald green of the surrounding landscape gave him the feeling that the snow and the cold of winter were two things that would never be experienced in England again.  A perfect summer day! The warm sun, the singing birds, the flowers in bloom--and the war! Twenty miles across the English Channel, less than three minutes by air, Nazi hordes were working day and night toward that great moment when their leader, Adolf Hitler, would give them the order to begin their attempted invasion of England. And on this side of that Channel some forty odd millions of people were also working day and night so that when the order was given, not a single German booted foot would succeed in touching English soil. A beautiful summer day, and the people of the greatest empire on earth were waiting, ready to fight and die to the last man that their empire might continue to survive.  \"Well, Pilot Officer Dave Dawson, of His Majesty's Royal Air Force,\" a voice suddenly spoke in Dave's ear, \"I'll give you a penny for your thoughts. No, wait, let me guess. You were thinking about your home in Boston, Massachusetts, back in the States?\"  Dave sat up and grinned down at the good-looking, sun-bronzed youth sprawled out on the grass at his side. He shook his head and held out his hand.  \"Wrong, Pilot Officer Freddy Farmer, of the same Royal Air Force,\" he said. \"So pay me the penny. I was thinking that it sure is one swell day. And I was wondering if we were going to get a little action, or if Hitler had found out we were now regular active service pilots, and had decided to call off the war.\"  \"Hardly,\" the English youth said with a chuckle. \"True, he's probably scared stiff now that you and I are in the R.A.F. I fancy, though, he isn't that scared. But it's pretty wonderful, isn't it? I mean, to be in the R.A.F.\"  Dave didn't answer. He let his gaze wander over to the line of Supermarine Spitfires powered with 1030 hp. Rolls Royce \"Merlin\" engines. Just looking at those swift, man-made metal birds of war made his heart start pounding and the blood surge through his body. An honest to goodness Spitfire pilot in the Royal Air Force! It was like living a wonderful dream, and it was doubly wonderful because it was true. The training and the concentrated study were all behind Freddy and himself, now. Each wore the highly prized wings above the upper left pocket of his tunic. But perhaps even more important was the fact that they had already received their baptism under fire. Each had got himself a German plane, the first payment in return for the training and instruction England had given them. For a month, now, they had been stationed with No. 207 Squadron, located on the east coast of England, just a few miles north of Chelmsford. Only a month so far on active duty--the \"Babies\" of the Squadron--but because of the speed with which wars are being fought these days, with each day filled with twenty-four hours of service and activity, they were just as much veterans as most of the older pilots.  \"Stop daydreaming,\" Freddy cut into Dave's thoughts. \"You are glad to be in the R.A.F., aren't you?\"  Dave looked at him and raised both his eyebrows.  \"Glad?\" he echoed. \"Boy, I'm tickled pink! Right now I wouldn't swap places with anybody else in all the world. Glad? Holy smokes! Is that a dumb question! And say, come across with that penny. Pay up, pal!\"  Freddy made a face, fished a penny from his pocket and tossed it over.  \"Right you are, there,\" he said. \"I'll have you know an Englishman always pays his debts. What do you think, Dave?\"  \"About what?\"  \"About the blighters across the Channel,\" Freddy said. \"Think they'll be fools enough to try and invade us? I mean, seriously.\"  \"I don't know,\" Dave said with a shrug. He plucked a blade of grass and started chewing on it thoughtfully. \"No, I don't know if Hitler's that crazy, or not,\" he continued after a moment. \"All I can say is I sure hope he tries it. We'll give him a beating he won't forget in a hurry. Gee! That makes me feel good!\"  \"What makes you feel good?\" Freddy wanted to know.  \"Saying that,\" Dave grunted. \"Saying _we'll_ give him a beating. Gosh, a few months ago I was an American citizen, standing on the sidelines watching things. Now, though, I'm a part of it. When I speak of England doing this or that, I'm including me, because I'm really a little part of it, now. It sure gives me a kick to feel that way, and to know it's true.\"  \"And England is grateful, Dave,\" Freddy said solemnly. \"I guess you might say that England's fighting to save the world, and--\"  The young Englishman didn't finish the rest. At that moment the phone bell in the Dispersal Office not far away rang harshly. In a flash they were both on their feet, because the ringing of that phone bell always meant just one thing. It meant that German planes had been sighted approaching 207's patrol area. The voice at the other end of that phone would state where the planes were, how many in number, the types, the altitude, direction, and so forth. To pilots on stand-to duty the ringing of that bell meant action coming up. And so, as their flight leader answered the call, Dave and Freddy started pulling on their helmets and zipping up their flying suits, for although it was summer on the ground it was cold up around twenty thousand feet where they usually did battle.  A moment later Flight Lieutenant Barton-Woods, leader of their flight, known as Green Flight, came dashing out of the Dispersal Office.  \"Right-o, chaps!\" he called out to them, and hurried toward his plane. \"A couple of Junkers 88s cutting across Zone H at twenty-two thousand. Let's go up and chase the beggars down into the sea.\"  In less than a minute the three Spitfires streaked off the field and went wind screaming up for altitude. As soon as they were clear, Flight Lieutenant Barton-Woods checked his radio with the field's station, and then checked with the two members of his flight.  \"Radio check, chaps!\" came the words in Dave's helmet phones.  \"Check, sir,\" he spoke into the disc-shaped mike in front of his mouth.  \"Check, also, sir,\" he heard Freddy sing out.  \"Right you are, lads,\" the flight lieutenant replied. \"Don't forget to turn on your oxygen at five thousand, so's you won't forget it at twenty.\"  Dave reached forward and turned the little valve knob that would feed him oxygen through a mouthpiece. He didn't need it yet, of course, but it was a practice to turn the thing on at low altitudes so that it would be ready for instant use at higher altitudes. If you waited until you needed oxygen, you might be too busy at that moment fighting for your life to have time to turn the knob. And then it would be just too bad--for you.  And so Dave made sure ahead of time, then concentrated on keeping his place in the V-shaped formation, and following his flight leader high up into the cloud-dotted blue. In less time than it takes to tell about it, England was just a blur of browns and greens far down under their wings; just a tiny island completely surrounded by water and almost within broad jumping distance of Nazi-conquered Europe. Dave, however, didn't bother about admiring the sight. He had seen it countless times before. And besides, he needed his eyes now for things above, not under him. Somewhere up in that vast expanse of white-dotted blue two German "]]]
