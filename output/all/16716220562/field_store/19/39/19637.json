However, \"The Magic of Oz\" is really more strange and unusual than anything I have read or heard about on our side of The Great Sandy Desert which shuts us off from The Land of Oz, even during the past exciting years, so I hope it will appeal to your love of novelty.  A long and confining illness has prevented my answering all the good letters sent me--unless stamps were enclosed--but from now on I hope to be able to give prompt attention to each and every letter with which my readers favor me.  Assuring you that my love for you has never faltered and hoping the Oz Books will continue to give you pleasure as long as I am able to write them, I am  Yours affectionately,    L. FRANK BAUM,   \"Royal Historian of Oz.\"   \"OZCOT\"   at HOLLYWOOD   in CALIFORNIA   1919     1.  Mount Munch   On the east edge of the Land of Oz, in the Munchkin Country, is a big, tall hill called Mount Munch.  One one side, the bottom of this hill just touches the Deadly Sandy Desert that separates the Fairyland of Oz from all the rest of the world, but on the other side, the hill touches the beautiful, fertile Country of the Munchkins.  The Munchkin folks, however, merely stand off and look at Mount Munch and know very little about it; for, about a third of the way up, its sides become too steep to climb, and if any people live upon the top of that great towering peak that seems to reach nearly to the skies, the Munchkins are not aware of the fact.  But people DO live there, just the same.  The top of Mount Munch is shaped like a saucer, broad and deep, and in the saucer are fields where grains and vegetables grow, and flocks are fed, and brooks flow and trees bear all sorts of things.  There are houses scattered here and there, each having its family of Hyups, as the people call themselves.  The Hyups seldom go down the mountain, for the same reason that the Munchkins never climb up: the sides are too steep.  In one of the houses lived a wise old Hyup named Bini Aru, who used to be a clever Sorcerer.  But Ozma of Oz, who rules everyone in the Land of Oz, had made a decree that no one should practice magic in her dominions except Glinda the Good and the Wizard of Oz, and when Glinda sent this royal command to the Hyups by means of a strong-winged Eagle, old Bini Aru at once stopped performing magical arts.  He destroyed many of his magic powders and tools of magic, and afterward honestly obeyed the law.  He had never seen Ozma, but he knew she was his Ruler and must be obeyed.  There was only one thing that grieved him.  He had discovered a new and secret method of transformations that was unknown to any other Sorcerer.  Glinda the Good did not know it, nor did the little Wizard of Oz, nor Dr. Pipt nor old Mombi, nor anyone else who dealt in magic arts.  It was Bini Aru's own secret.  By its means, it was the simplest thing in the world to transform anyone into beast, bird or fish, or anything else, and back again, once you know how to pronounce the mystical word: \"Pyrzqxgl.\"  Bini Aru had used this secret many times, but not to cause evil or suffering to others.  When he had wandered far from home and was hungry, he would say: \"I want to become a cow--Pyrzqxgl!\" In an instant he would be a cow, and then he would eat grass and satisfy his hunger. All beasts and birds can talk in the Land of Oz, so when the cow was no longer hungry, it would say: \"I want to be Bini Aru again: Pyrzqxgl!\" and the magic word, properly pronounced, would instantly restore him to his proper form.  Now, of course, I would not dare to write down this magic word so plainly if I thought my readers would pronounce it properly and so be able to transform themselves and others, but it is a fact that no one in all the world except Bini Aru, had ever (up to the time this story begins) been able to pronounce \"Pyrzqxgl!\" the right way, so I think it is safe to give it to you.  It might be well, however, in reading this story aloud, to be careful not to pronounce Pyrzqxgl the proper way, and thus avoid all danger of the secret being able to work mischief.  Bini Aru, having discovered the secret of instant transformation, which required no tools or powders or other chemicals or herbs and always worked perfectly, was reluctant to have such a wonderful discovery entirely unknown or lost to all human knowledge.  He decided not to use it again, since Ozma had forbidden him to do so, but he reflected that Ozma was a girl and some time might change her mind and allow her subjects to practice magic, in which case Bini Aru could again transform himself and others at will,--unless, of course, he forgot how to pronounce Pyrzqxgl in the meantime.  After giving the matter careful thought, he decided to write the word, and how it should be pronounced, in some secret place, so that he could find it after many years, but where no one else could ever find it.  That was a clever idea, but what bothered the old Sorcerer was to find a secret place.  He wandered all over the Saucer at the top of Mount Munch, but found no place in which to write the secret word where others might not be likely to stumble upon it.  So finally he decided it must be written somewhere in his own house.  Bini Aru had a wife named Mopsi Aru who was famous for making fine huckleberry pies, and he had a son named Kiki Aru who was not famous at all.  He was noted as being cross and disagreeable because he was not happy, and he was not happy because he wanted to go down the mountain and visit the big world below and his father would not let him.  No one paid any attention to Kiki Aru, because he didn't amount to anything, anyway.  Once a year there was a festival on Mount Munch which all the Hyups attended.  It was held in the center of the saucer-shaped country, and the day was given over to feasting and merry-making.  The young folks danced and sang songs; the women spread the tables with good things to eat, and the men played on musical instruments and told fairy tales.  Kiki Aru usually went to these festivals with his parents, and then sat sullenly outside the circle and would not dance or sing or even talk to the other young people.  So the festival did not make him any happier than other days, and this time he told Bini Aru and Mopsi Aru that he would not go.  He would rather stay at home and be unhappy all by himself, he said, and so they gladly let him stay.  But after he was left alone Kiki decided to enter his father's private room, where he was forbidden to go, and see if he could find any of the magic tools Bini Aru used to work with when he practiced sorcery.  As he went in Kiki stubbed his toe on one of the floor boards.  He searched everywhere but found no trace of his father's magic.  All had been destroyed.  Much disappointed, he started to go out again when he stubbed his toe on the same floor board.  That set him thinking.  Examining the board more closely, Kiki found it had been pried up and then nailed down again in such a manner that it was a little higher than the other boards.  But why had his father taken up the board?  Had he hidden some of his magic tools underneath the floor?  Kiki got a chisel and pried up the board, but found nothing under it. He was just about to replace the board when it slipped from his hand and turned over, and he saw something written on the underside of it. The light was rather dim, so he took the board to the window and examined it, and found that the writing described exactly how to pronounce the magic word Pyrzqxgl, which would transform anyone into anything instantly, and back again when the word was repeated.  Now, at first, Kiki Aru didn't realize what a wonderful secret he had discovered; but he thought it might be of use to him and so he took a piece of paper and made on it an exact copy of the instructions for pronouncing Pyrzqxgl.  Then he folded the paper and put it in his pocket, and replaced the board in the floor so that no one would suspect it had been removed.  After this Kiki went into the garden and sitting beneath a tree made a careful study of the paper.  He had always wanted to get away from Mount Munch and visit the big world--especially the Land of Oz--and the idea now came to him that if he could transform himself into a bird, he could fly to any place he wished to go and fly back again whenever he cared to.  It was necessary, however, to learn by heart the way to pronounce the magic word, because a bird would have no way to carry a paper with it, and Kiki would be unable to resume his proper shape if he forgot the word or its pronunciation.  So he studied it a long time, repeating it a hundred times in his mind until he was sure he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/419"],["title","The Magic of Oz (#1)"],["body","not forget it.  But to make safety doubly sure he placed the paper in a tin box in a neglected part of the garden and covered the box with small stones.  By this time it was getting late in the day and Kiki wished to attempt his first transformation before his parents returned from the festival. So he stood on the front porch of his home and said:  \"I want to become a big, strong bird, like a hawk--Pyrzqxgl!\" He pronounced it the right way, so in a flash he felt that he was completely changed in form.  He flapped his wings, hopped to the porch railing and said: \"Caw-oo!  Caw-oo!\"  Then he laughed and said half aloud: \"I suppose that's the funny sound this sort of a bird makes.  But now let me try my wings and see if I'm strong enough to fly across the desert.\"  For he had decided to make his first trip to the country outside the Land of Oz.  He had stolen this secret of transformation and he knew he had disobeyed the law of Oz by working magic.  Perhaps Glinda or the Wizard of Oz would discover him and punish him, so it would be good policy to keep away from Oz altogether.  Slowly Kiki rose into the air, and resting on his broad wings, floated in graceful circles above the saucer-shaped mountain-top.  From his height, he could see, far across the burning sands of the Deadly Desert, another country that might be pleasant to explore, so he headed that way, and with strong, steady strokes of his wings, began the long flight.     2.  The Hawk   Even a hawk has to fly high in order to cross the Deadly Desert, from which poisonous fumes are constantly rising.  Kiki Aru felt sick and faint by the time he reached good land again, for he could not quite escape the effects of the poisons.  But the fresh air soon restored him and he alighted in a broad table-land which is called Hiland.  Just beyond it is a valley known as Loland, and these two countries are ruled by the Gingerbread Man, John Dough, with Chick the Cherub as his Prime Minister.  The hawk merely stopped here long enough to rest, and then he flew north and passed over a fine country called Merryland, which is ruled by a lovely Wax Doll.  Then, following the curve of the Desert, he turned north and settled on a tree-top in the Kingdom of Noland.  Kiki was tired by this time, and the sun was now setting, so he decided to remain here till morning.  From his tree-top he could see a house near by, which looked very comfortable.  A man was milking a cow in the yard and a pleasant-faced woman came to the door and called him to supper.  That made Kiki wonder what sort of food hawks ate.  He felt hungry, but didn't know what to eat or where to get it.  Also he thought a bed would be more comfortable than a tree-top for sleeping, so he hopped to the ground and said: \"I want to become Kiki Aru again--Pyrzqxgl!\"  Instantly he had resumed his natural shape, and going to the house, he knocked upon the door and asked for some supper.  \"Who are you?\" asked the man of the house.  \"A stranger from the Land of Oz,\" replied Kiki Aru.  \"Then you are welcome,\" said the man.  Kiki was given a good supper and a good bed, and he behaved very well, although he refused to answer all the questions the good people of Noland asked him.  Having escaped from his home and found a way to see the world, the young man was no longer unhappy, and so he was no longer cross and disagreeable.  The people thought him a very respectable person and gave him breakfast next morning, after which he started on his way feeling quite contented.  Having walked for an hour or two through the pretty country that is ruled by King Bud, Kiki Aru decided he could travel faster and see more as a bird, so he transformed himself into a white dove and visited the great city of Nole and saw the King's palace and gardens and many other places of interest.  Then he flew westward into the Kingdom of Ix, and after a day in Queen Zixi's country went on westward into the Land of Ev.  Every place he visited he thought was much more pleasant than the saucer-country of the Hyups, and he decided that when he reached the finest country of all he would settle there and enjoy his future life to the utmost.  In the land of Ev he resumed his own shape again, for the cities and villages were close together and he could easily go on foot from one to another of them.  Toward evening he came to a good Inn and asked the inn-keeper if he could have food and lodging.  \"You can if you have the money to pay,\" said the man, \"otherwise you must go elsewhere.\"  This surprised Kiki, for in the Land of Oz they do not use money at all, everyone being allowed to take what he wishes without price.  He had no money, therefore, and so he turned away to seek hospitality elsewhere.  Looking through an open window into one of the rooms of the Inn, as he passed along, he saw an old man counting on a table a big heap of gold pieces, which Kiki thought to be money.  One of these would buy him supper and a bed, he reflected, so he transformed himself into a magpie and, flying through the open window, caught up one of the gold pieces in his beak and flew out again before the old man could interfere.  Indeed, the old man who was robbed was quite helpless, for he dared not leave his pile of gold to chase the magpie, and before he could place the gold in a sack in his pocket the robber bird was out of sight and to seek it would be folly.  Kiki Aru flew to a group of trees and, dropping the gold piece to the ground, resumed his proper shape, and then picked up the money and put it in his pocket.  \"You'll be sorry for this!\" exclaimed a small voice just over his head.  Kiki looked up and saw that a sparrow, perched upon a branch, was watching him.  \"Sorry for what?\" he demanded.  \"Oh, I saw the whole thing,\" asserted the sparrow.  \"I saw you look in the window at the gold, and then make yourself into a magpie and rob the poor man, and then I saw you fly here and make the bird into your former shape.  That's magic, and magic is wicked and unlawful; and you stole money, and that's a still greater crime.  You'll be sorry, some day.\"  \"I don't care,\" replied Kiki Aru, scowling.  \"Aren't you afraid to be wicked?\" asked the sparrow.  \"No, I didn't know I was being wicked,\" said Kiki, \"but if I was, I'm glad of it.  I hate good people.  I've always wanted to be wicked, but I didn't know how.\"  \"Haw, haw, haw!\" laughed someone behind him, in a big voice; \"that's the proper spirit, my lad!  I'm glad I've met you; shake hands.\"  The sparrow gave a frightened squeak and flew away.     3.  Two Bad Ones   Kiki turned around and saw a queer old man standing near.  He didn't stand straight, for he was crooked.  He had a fat body and thin legs and arms.  He had a big, round face with bushy, white whiskers that came to a point below his waist, and white hair that came to a point on top of his head.  He wore dull-gray clothes that were tight fitting, and his pockets were all bunched out as if stuffed full of something.  \"I didn't know you were here,\" said Kiki.  \"I didn't come until after you did,\" said the queer old man.  \"Who are you?\" asked Kiki.  \"My name's Ruggedo.  I used to be the Nome King; but I got kicked out of my country, and now I'm a wanderer.\"  \"What made them kick you out?\" inquired the Hyup boy.  \"Well, it's the fashion to kick kings nowadays.  I was a pretty good King--to myself--but those dreadful Oz people wouldn't let me alone. So I had to abdicate.\"  \"What does that mean?\"  \"It means to be kicked out.  But let's talk about something pleasant. Who are you and where did you come from?\"  \"I'm called Kiki Aru.  I used to live on Mount Munch in the Land of Oz, but now I'm a wanderer like yourself.\"  The Nome King gave him a shrewd look.  \"I heard that bird say that you transformed yourself into a magpie and back again.  Is that true?\"  Kiki hesitated, but saw no reason to deny it.  He felt that it would make him appear more important.  \"Well--yes,\" he said.  \"Then you're a wizard?\"  \"No; I only understand transformations,\" he admitted.  \"Well, that's pretty good magic, anyhow,\" declared old Ruggedo.  \"I used to have some very fine magic, myself, but my enemies took it all away from me.  Where are you going now?\"  \"I'm going into the inn, to get some supper and a bed,\" said Kiki.  \"Have you the money to pay for it?\" asked the Nome.  \"I have one gold piece.\"  \"Which you stole.  Very good.  And you're glad that you're wicked. Better yet.  I like you, young man, and I'll go to the inn with you if you'll promise not to eat eggs for supper.\"  \"Don't you like eggs?\" asked Kiki.  \"I'm afraid of 'em; they're dangerous!\" said Ruggedo, with a shudder.  \"All right,\" agreed Kiki; \"I won't ask for eggs.\"  \"Then come along,\" said the Nome.  When they entered the inn, the landlord scowled at Kiki and said:  \"I told you I would not feed you unless you had money.\"  Kiki showed him the gold piece.  \"And how about you?\" asked the landlord, turning to Ruggedo.  \"Have you money?\"  \"I've something better,\" answered the old Nome, and taking a bag from one of his pockets he poured from it upon the table a mass of glittering gems--diamonds, rubies and emeralds.  The landlord was very polite to the strangers after that.  He served them an excellent supper, and while they ate it, the Hyup boy asked his companion:  \"Where did you get so many jewels?\"  \"Well, I'll tell you,\" answered the Nome.  \"When those Oz people took my kingdom away from me--just because it was my kingdom and I wanted to run it to suit myself--they said I could take as many precious stones as I could carry.  So I had a lot of pockets made in my clothes and loaded them all up.  Jewels are fine things to have with you when you travel; you can trade them for anything.\"  \"Are they better than gold pieces?\" asked Kiki.  \"The smallest of these jewels is worth a hundred gold pieces such as you stole from the old man.\"  \"Don't talk so loud,\" begged Kiki, uneasily.  \"Some one else might hear what you are saying.\"  After supper"]]]
