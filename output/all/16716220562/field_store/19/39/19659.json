I ... know._  \"One other question,\" Geo raised the jewel from where it hung against his chest. \"How do you work this silly thing?\"  _Think ... through ... it_, said Snake.  Geo frowned. \"What do you mean? Can you tell me how it works?\"  _You ... have ... no ... words_, Snake said. _Radio ... electricity ... diode ..._  \"Radio, electricity, diode?\" repeated Geo, the sounds coming unfamiliarly to his tongue. \"What are they?\"  Snake shrugged.         *       *       *       *       *  Geo got a chance to report his findings to Urson that evening and the big man was puzzled.  \"Can you add anything?\" Geo asked.  \"All I've had a chance to do is work,\" grumbled Urson. They were standing by the edge of the rail beyond which the mist steeped thickly, making sky and water indistinguishable and grave. \"Hey, Four-arms,\" Urson suddenly asked. \"What are you looking at?\"  Snake stared at the water but said nothing.  \"Maybe he's listening to something,\" suggested Geo.  \"You'd think there were better things to eavesdrop on than fishes,\" said Urson. \"I guess Argo's given special orders that you two get no work. Some people! Let's go eat.\" As they started toward the convergence of sailors at the entrance of the mess hall, Urson said, \"Oh, guess what?\" He turned to Geo and picked up the jewel from the boy's chest. \"All you people are going around with such finery, I took my coins to the smithy and had him put chains on them. Now I'll strut with the best of you.\" He laughed, and then went through the narrow way, crowding with the other sailors into the wide hall.         *       *       *       *       *  For two weeks, nights without dreams left them early, and the boat rolled from beneath the fog. Dawn was gray, but clear; then, by one breakfast time the ragged slip of Aptor's beach hemmed the horizon.  On the wheel deck the sailors clustered to the rail, and before them rocks struck like broken teeth from the water. Urson, in his new, triple neckchain, joined Snake and Geo at the rail. \"Whew,\" he said. \"Getting through them is going to be fun.\"  Suddenly heads turned. Behind them now, Argo's dark veils, bloated with the breeze, filled about her as she mounted the steps to the wheel deck. The sailors moved away from her. Then, one hand on a stay rope, she stared across the gray water to the dark tongue of land.  From the wheel the captain spoke, \"Jordde, disperse the men and take over the wheel.\"  \"Aye, sir,\" said the mate. \"You, you, and you to the tops.\" He pointed among the men. \"You also, and you. Hey, didn't you hear me?\"  \"Me, sir?\" Geo turned around.  \"Yes, you, up to the top spar there.\"  \"You can't send him up,\" Urson called out. \"He's never been topside at all before. It's too choppy for any lad's first time up. He doesn't even know ...\"  \"And who asked you?\" demanded the mate.  \"Nobody asked me, sir,\" said Urson, \"but--\"  \"Then you get below before I have you brigged for insubordination and fine you your three gold baubles. Don't you think I recognize dead man's gold?\"  \"Now look here,\" Urson roared.  Geo glanced from Argo to the captain. The bewilderment that flooded the face of the Priestess shocked him.  Jordde suddenly seized up a marlin pin, raised it, and shouted at Urson, \"Get down below before I break your skull open.\"  Urson's fists sprang up.  \"Calmly, brother bear,\" Geo began.  \"In a bitch's ass,\" snarled Urson and swung his huge arm forward. Something leaped on Jordde from behind--Snake! The marlin pin veered inches away from Urson's shoulder. The flung fist sunk into the mate's stomach and he reeled forward, passing Urson, with Snake still clawing at his back. He reached the rail, bent double over it, and Snake's legs flipped up. When Jordde rose, he was free of encumbrance.  Geo rushed to the edge and saw Snake's head emerge in the churning water. Behind him, Urson yelled, \"Look out!\" Jordde's marlin made an inch of splinters in the length of wood against which he had been leaning.  \"Not him!\" cried Argo. \"No, no! Not him!\"  But Jordde had seized Geo's shoulder and whirled him back against the rail. Geo saw Urson grab a loose rope behind them and suddenly swing forward, intending to knock Jordde away with his feet. But suddenly Argo moved in the way of his flying body, turned, saw him, and raised her hands to push him aside so that he swung wide of them and landed on the railing a yard from where they struggled.  Geo's feet slipped on the wet boards, and he felt his body suddenly hurled backwards onto the air. Then his back slapped water. As he broke surface, Urson, still on the rail called to him, \"Hang on, friend Geo, I'm coming!\" Urson's arms swung back, and then forward as he dove into the sea.  Now Geo could see only Argo and Jordde at the rail. But they were struggling. Urson and Snake were near him in the water. The last thing he saw was Jordde suddenly wrest something from Argo's neck and then fling it out into the sea. The Priestess' hands reached for the flying jewel, followed its arc as she screamed toward the water.  Then hands were at his body. Geo turned in the water as Snake disappeared from beside him and Urson suddenly cried out. Hands were pulling him down.  Roughness of sand beneath one of his sides and the flare of sun on the other. His eyes were hot and his lids were orange over them. Then there was a breeze. He opened his eyes, and shut them quick, because of the light. Then he turned over, thought about pillows and stiff new sheets. Reaching out, he grabbed sand.  He opened his eyes and pushed himself up from the beach with both hands spread in warm, soft crumblings. Over there were rocks, and thick vegetation behind them. He swayed to his knees, the sand grating under his kneecaps. He looked at his arm in the sun, flecked with grains. Then he touched his chest.  His hand came to one bead, moved on, and came to another! He looked down. Both the chain with the platinum claw and the thong with the wire cage hung around his neck. Bewildered, he heaved to his feet, and immediately sat down again as the beach went red with the wash of blood behind his eyeballs. He got up again, slowly.  Carefully Geo started down the beach, looking toward the land. When he turned to look at the water, he stopped.  At the horizon, beyond the rocks, was a boat with lowered sails. So they hadn't left yet. He swung his eyes back to the beach: fifty feet away was another figure lying in the sun.  He ran forward, now, the sand splashing around his feet, sinking under his toes, so that it was like the slow motion running of dreams. Ten feet from the figure he stopped.  It was a young black, very dark, skin the color of richly humused soil. The long skull was shaved. Like Geo, he was almost naked. There was a clot of seaweed at his wrist, and the soles of his feet and one up-turned palm were grayish and shriveled.  Geo frowned and stood for a full minute. He looked up and down the beach once more. There was no one else. Just then the man's arm shifted across the sand.  Immediately Geo fell to his knees beside the figure, rolled him over and lifted his head. The eyes opened, squinted in the light, and the man said, \"Who are you?\"  \"My name is Geo.\"  The man sat up, and caught himself from falling forward by jamming his hands into the sand. He shook his head, and then looked up at Geo again. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I remember you. What happened? Did we founder? Did the ship go down?\"  \"Remember me from where?\" Geo asked.  \"From the ship. You were on the ship, weren't you?\"  \"I was on the ship,\" Geo said. \"And I got thrown overboard by that damned first mate in a fight. But nothing happened to the ship. It's still out there, you can see it.\" Suddenly Geo stopped. Then he said, \"You're the guy who discovered Whitey's body that morning!\"  \"That's right.\" He shook his head again. \"My name is Iimmi.\" Now he looked out to the horizon. \"I see them,\" he said. \"There's the ship. But where are we?\"  \"On the beach of Aptor,\" Geo told him.  Iimmi screwed his face up into a mask of dark horror. \"No,\" he said softly. \"We couldn't be. We were days away from her....\"  \"How did you fall in?\"  \"It was blowing up a little,\" Iimmi explained. \"I was in the rig when suddenly something struck me from behind and I went toppling. In all the mist, they didn't see me, and the current was too strong for me, and ...\" He looked around.  \"You've been on this beach once before, haven't you?\" Geo asked.  \"Once,\" said Iimmi. \"Yes, once.\"  \"Do you realize how long you've been in the water?\" Geo asked.  Iimmi looked up.  \"Over two weeks,\" Geo said. \"Come on, see if you can walk. I've got a lot of things to explain, if I can, and we've got some hunting to do.\"  Iimmi steadied himself once more, and together they started up the beach.  \"What are you looking for?\" Iimmi asked.  \"Friends,\" Geo said.  Two hundred feet up, the rocks and torpid vegetation came down to the water, cutting off the beach. Scrambling over boulders and through vines, they emerged on a rock embankment that dropped fifteen feet into the wide estuary of a ribbon of water that wound back into the jungle. Twenty feet further, the bank dropped to the river's surface, and they both fell flat at the edge of a wet table of rock and sucked in cool liquid, watching blue stones and the white and red pebbles shivering six feet below clear ripples.  There was a sound. Both sprang back from the water, turned, and crouched on the rock.  \"Hey,\" Urson said, through leaves. \"I was wondering when I'd find you.\"  Light through branches lay on the gold coins hung against his hairy chest. \"Have you seen Snake?\"  \"I was hoping he was with you,\" said Geo. \"Oh, Urson, this is Iimmi, the other sailor who died two weeks ago.\"  Both Iimmi and Urson looked puzzled. \"Have a drink of water,\" Geo said, \"and I'll explain as best I can.\"  \"Don't mind if I do,\" said Urson.  While the bear man lay down to drink, Geo began the story of Aptor and Leptar for Iimmi. When he finished, Iimmi asked, \"You"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41990"],["title","The Cid Campeador: A Historical Romance (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's note: Corrected obvious punctuation errors (e.g. \" for ')     THE  CID CAMPEADOR    _A HISTORICAL ROMANCE_       BY  D. ANTONIO DE TRUEBA Y LA QUINTANA    Translated from the Spanish  BY  HENRY J. GILL, M.A., T.C.D.      LONDON LONGMANS, GREEN, AND CO. AND NEW YORK 1895   [_All rights reserved_]     PREFACE   The \"Cid Campeador\" has been for centuries the great popular hero of Spain. He takes the same place in that country as King Arthur does in England, Roland, or Rolando, in France, and William Tell in Switzerland; and, like them, his life and exploits are, to a great extent, founded on popular traditions. In English-speaking countries there is very little known respecting him, and the translator ventures to place before the public a work which is considered by Spaniards to be one of the best historical romances in their literature. It is founded on a large number of ballads and other poetical pieces, extant in Spain for centuries, and on a very old work named \"The Chronicle of the Cid.\"  The Author writes in his Introduction: \"The Cid is the most popular of the Castilian heroes, and not without reason, for in him are personified all the virtues of the citizen and of the soldier. A good son, he avenges the insults offered to his father by bravely fighting with the Count of Gormaz: a good cavalier and faithful lover, he gives his hand and heart to the daughter of the man whom he had slain in fair combat: a good monarchist, he risks the anger of King Alfonzo by compelling him to take an oath that he was not guilty of a crime which would stain the throne of Fernando the Great: a good soldier and a good vassal, he conquers, with his invincible sword, hostile realms and Moorish kings, and lays at the feet of his sovereign, who had unjustly banished him, the spoils which he had won and the countries of which he had made himself master: a good patrician, loving the glory and the preponderance of his native land, he proceeds to Rome, enters the Church of St. Peter, and seeing in the place of honour the seat of the representative of France, he breaks it in pieces, filled with indignation, and puts in its place that of the representative of Spain: and finally, a good Christian, a good husband, and a good father; before entering into the combats, when calling upon God, he also uses the names of his wife and children, over whom he had wept when parting from them,--he who, in battle, showed a heart more hard than the armour which covered it.\"     CONTENTS       CHAP.

Don Fernando I., King of Castile and Leon, had journeyed to Najera to visit his brother Don Garcia, King of Navarre, who was sojourning, in bad health, in that town; but, having learned that Don Garcia desired to take him prisoner, on account of certain matters which were pending between them, regarding the partition of their late father's kingdom, he quickly withdrew to a place of safety. Don Garcia having gone, in his turn, to visit his brother, was incarcerated in the Castle of Cea. However, having succeeded in escaping from it, he summoned the Moors to his aid, and entered Castile, determined on revenge, and committed horrible atrocities. Don Fernando sallied forth to meet him, engaged with him at Atapuerca, not far from Burgos, and the invading army was completely routed. Don Garcia was killed by a lance-wound inflicted on him by a soldier named Sancho Fortun, who had gone over to the service of Don Fernando.  This, then, was the occasion of the festivities to which we have alluded, festivities which had attracted to the Court great numbers of ladies and cavaliers, not alone from Castile and Leon, but also from the other kingdoms, into which, at that time, Spain was divided. There had been various games, and a splendid tournament had taken place, in which Don Fernando had broken lances with the bravest and most polished cavaliers of the period--a period so celebrated for skilful jousters and valiant warriors.  Night having come on, the dances, games, and jousts ceased, and great bonfires were lighted up in the open places of the town and in the surrounding fields, where the people continued the rejoicings until the approach of morning.
