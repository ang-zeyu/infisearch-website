It seemed terrible that so gallant a soul should depart from earth in this miserable fashion.  Some of us, much moved by the sight, went to the doctors and put the case as strongly as possible, begging them to do something to alleviate his suffering.  They declined to see the case, but got rid of us by giving us a bottle of turpentine, with directions to pour it upon the ulcers to kill the maggots.  We did so.  It must have been cruel torture, and as absurd remedially as cruel, but our hero set his teeth and endured, without a groan.  He was then carried out to the hospital to die.  I said the doctors made a pretense of affording medical relief.  It was hardly that, since about all the prescription for those inside the Stockade consisted in giving a handful of sumach berries to each of those complaining of scurvy.  The berries might have done some good, had there been enough of them, and had their action been assisted by proper food. As it was, they were probably nearly, if not wholly, useless.  Nothing was given to arrest the ravages of dysentery.  A limited number of the worst cases were admitted to the Hospital each day.  As this only had capacity for about one-quarter of the sick in the Stockade, new patients could only be admitted as others died.  It seemed, anyway, like signing a man's death warrant to send him to the Hospital, as three out of every four who went out there died.  The following from the official report of the Hospital shows this:  Total number admitted .........................................12,900 Died ................................................. 8,663 Exchanged ............................................   828 Took the oath of allegiance ..........................    25 Sent elsewhere ....................................... 2,889  Total ................................................12,400  Average deaths, 76 per cent.   Early in August I made a successful effort to get out to the Hospital.  I had several reasons for this: First, one of my chums, W.  W.  Watts, of my own company, had been sent out a little whale before very sick with scurvy and pneumonia, and I wanted to see if I could do anything for him, if he still lived: I have mentioned before that for awhile after our entrance into Andersonville five of us slept on one overcoat and covered ourselves with one blanket.  Two of these had already died, leaving as possessors of-the blanket and overcoat, W. W. Watts, B. B. Andrews, and myself.  Next, I wanted to go out to see if there was any prospect of escape. I had long since given up hopes of escaping from the Stockade.  All our attempts at tunneling had resulted in dead failures, and now, to make us wholly despair of success in that direction, another Stockade was built clear around the prison, at a distance of one hundred and twenty feet from the first palisades.  It was manifest that though we might succeed in tunneling past one Stockade, we could not go beyond the second one.  I had the scurvy rather badly, and being naturally slight in frame, I presented a very sick appearance to the physicians, and was passed out to the Hospital.  While this was a wretched affair, it was still a vast improvement on the Stockade.  About five acres of ground, a little southeast of the Stockade, and bordering on a creek, were enclosed by a board fence, around which the guard walked, trees shaded the ground tolerably well. There were tents and flies to shelter part of the sick, and in these were beds made of pine leaves.  There were regular streets and alleys running through the grounds, and as the management was in the hands of our own men, the place was kept reasonably clean and orderly for Andersonville.  There was also some improvement in the food.  Rice in some degree replaced the nauseous and innutritious corn bread, and if served in sufficient quantities, would doubtless have promoted the recovery of many men dying from dysenteric diseases.  We also received small quantities of \"okra,\" a plant peculiar to the South, whose pods contained a mucilaginous matter that made a soup very grateful to those suffering from scurvy.  But all these ameliorations of condition were too slight to even arrest the progress of the disease of the thousands of dying men brought out from the Stockade.  These still wore the same lice-infested garments as in prison; no baths or even ordinary applications of soap and water cleaned their dirt-grimed skins, to give their pores an opportunity to assist in restoring them to health; even their long, lank and matted hair, swarming with vermin, was not trimmed.  The most ordinary and obvious measures for their comfort and care were neglected.  If a man recovered he did it almost in spite of fate.  The medicines given were scanty and crude.  The principal remedial agent--as far as my observation extended--was a rank, fetid species of unrectified spirits, which, I was told, was made from sorgum seed.  It had a light-green tinge, and was about as inviting to the taste as spirits of turpentine.  It was given to the sick in small quantities mixed with water.  I had had some experience with Kentucky \"apple-jack,\" which, it was popularly believed among the boys, would dissolve a piece of the fattest pork thrown into it, but that seemed balmy and oily alongside of this.  After tasting some, I ceased to wonder at the atrocities of Wirz and his associates.  Nothing would seem too bad to a man who made that his habitual tipple.  [For a more particular description of the Hospital I must refer my reader to the testimony of Professor Jones, in a previous chapter.]  Certainly this continent has never seen--and I fervently trust it will never again see--such a gigantic concentration of misery as that Hospital displayed daily.  The official statistics tell the story of this with terrible brevity: There were three thousand seven hundred and nine in the Hospital in August; one thousand four hundred and eighty-nine--nearly every other man died.  The rate afterwards became much higher than this.  The most conspicuous suffering was in the gangrene wards.  Horrible sores spreading almost visibly from hour to hour, devoured men's limbs and bodies.  I remember one ward in which the alterations appeared to be altogether in the back, where they ate out the tissue between the skin and the ribs.  The attendants seemed trying to arrest the progress of the sloughing by drenching the sores with a solution of blue vitriol.  This was exquisitely painful, and in the morning, when the drenching was going on, the whole hospital rang with the most agonizing screams.  But the gangrene mostly attacked the legs and arms, and the led more than the arms.  Sometimes it killed men inside of a week; sometimes they lingered on indefinitely.  I remember one man in the Stockade who cut his hand with the sharp corner of a card of corn bread he was lifting from the ration wagon; gangrene set in immediately, and he died four days after.  One form that was quit prevalent was a cancer of the lower one corner of the mouth, and it finally ate the whole side of the face out.  Of course the sufferer had the greatest trouble in eating and drinking.  For the latter it was customary to whittle out a little wooden tube, and fasten it in a tin cup, through which he could suck up the water.  As this mouth cancer seemed contagious, none of us would allow any one afflicted with it to use any of our cooking utensils. The Rebel doctors at the hospital resorted to wholesale amputations to check the progress of the gangrene.  They had a two hours session of limb-lopping every morning, each of which resulted in quite a pile of severed members.  I presume more bungling operations are rarely seen outside of Russian or Turkish hospitals. Their unskilfulness was apparent even to non-scientific observers like myself.  The standard of medical education in the South--as indeed of every other form of education--was quite low.  The Chief Surgeon of the prison, Dr. Isaiah White, and perhaps two or three others, seemed to be gentlemen of fair abilities and attainments.  The remainder were of that class of illiterate and unlearning quacks who physic and blister the poor whites and negros in the country districts of the South; who believe they can stop bleeding of the nose by repeating a verse from the Bible; who think that if in gathering their favorite remedy of boneset they cut the stem upwards it will purge their patients, and if downward it will vomit them, and who hold that there is nothing so good for \"fits\" as a black cat, killed in the dark of the moon, cut open, and bound while yet warm, upon the naked chest of the victim of the convulsions.  They had a case of instruments captured from some of our field hospitals, which were dull and fearfully out of order.  With poor instruments and unskilled hands the operations became mangling.  In the Hospital I saw an admirable illustration of the affection which a sailor will lavish on a ship's boy, whom he takes a fancy to, and makes his \"chicken,\" as the phrase is.  The United States sloop \"Water Witch\" had recently been captured in Ossabaw Sound, and her crew brought into prison.  One of her boys--a bright, handsome little fellow of about fifteen--had lost one of his arms in the fight.  He was brought into the Hospital, and the old fellow whose \"chicken\" he was, was allowed to accompany and nurse him.  This \"old barnacle-back\" was as surly a growler as ever went aloft, but to his \"chicken\" he was as tender and thoughtful as a woman.  They found a shady nook in one corner, and any moment one looked in that direction he could see the old tar hard at work at something for the comfort and pleasure of his pet.  Now he was dressing the wound as deftly and gently as a mother caring for a new-born babe; now he was trying to concoct some relish out of the slender materials he could beg or steal from the Quartermaster; now trying to arrange the shade of the bed of pine leaves in a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4259"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons â€” Volume 3 (#7)"],["body","comfortable manner; now repairing or washing his clothes, and so on.  All the sailors were particularly favored by being allowed to bring their bags in untouched by the guards.  This \"chicken\" had a wonderful supply of clothes, the handiwork of his protector who, like most good sailors, was very skillful with the needle.  He had suits of fine white duck, embroidered with blue in a way that would ravish the heart of a fine lady, and blue suits similarly embroidered with white.  No belle ever kept her clothes in better order than these were.  When the duck came up from the old sailor's patient washing it was as spotless as new-fallen snow.  I found my chum in a very bad condition.  His appetite was entirely gone, but he had an inordinate craving for tobacco--for strong, black plug --which he smoked in a pipe.  He had already traded off all his brass buttons to the guards for this.  I had accumulated a few buttons to bribe the guard to take me out for wood, and I gave these also for tobacco for him.  When I awoke one morning the man who laid next to me on the right was dead, having died sometime during the night.  I searched his pockets and took what was in them.  These were a silk pocket handkerchief, a gutta percha finger-ring, a comb, a pencil, and a leather pocket-book, making in all quite a nice little \"find.\"  I hied over to the guard, and succeeded in trading the personal estate which I had inherited from the intestate deceased, for a handful of peaches, a handful of hardly ripe figs, and a long plug of tobacco.  I hastened back to Watts, expecting that the figs and peaches would do him a world of good.  At first I did not show him the tobacco, as I was strongly opposed to his using it, thinking that it was making him much worse.  But he looked at the tempting peaches and figs with lack-luster eyes; he was too far gone to care for them.  He pushed them back to me, saying faintly:  \"No, you take 'em, Mc; I don't want 'em; I can't eat 'em!\"  I then produced the tobacco, and his face lighted up.  Concluding that this was all the comfort that he could have, and that I might as well gratify him, I cut up some of the weed, filled his pipe and lighted it. He smoked calmly and almost happily all the afternoon, hardly speaking a word to me.  As it grew dark he asked me to bring him a drink.  I did so, and as I raised him up he said:  \"Mc, this thing's ended.  Tell my father that I stood it as long as I could, and----\"  The death rattle sounded in his throat, and when I laid him back it was all over.  Straightening out his limbs, folding his hands across his breast, and composing his features as best I could, I lay, down beside the body and slept till morning, when I did what little else I could toward preparing for the grave all that was left of my long-suffering little friend.     CHAPTER XLVIII.  DETERMINATION TO ESCAPE--DIFFERENT PLANS AND THEIR MERITS--I PREFER THE APPALACHICOLA ROUTE--PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE--A HOT DAY--THE FENCE PASSED SUCCESSFULLY PURSUED BY THE HOUNDS--CAUGHT --RETURNED TO THE STOCKADE.  After Watt's death, I set earnestly about seeing what could be done in the way of escape.  Frank Harvey, of the First West Virginia Cavalry, a boy of about my own age and disposition, joined with me in the scheme. I was still possessed with my original plan of making my way down the creeks to the Flint River, down the Flint River to where it emptied into the Appalachicola River, and down that stream to its debauchure into the bay that connected with the Gulf of Mexico.  I was sure of finding my way by this route, because, if nothing else offered, I could get astride of a log and float down the current.  The way to Sherman, in the other direction, was long, torturous and difficult, with a fearful gauntlet of blood-hounds, patrols and the scouts of Hood's Army to be run.  I had but little difficulty in persuading Harvey into an acceptance of my views, and we began arranging for a solution of the first great problem--how to get outside of the Hospital guards.  As I have explained before, the Hospital was surrounded by a board fence, with guards walking their beats on the ground outside.  A small creek flowed through the southern end of the grounds, and at its lower end was used as a sink.  The boards of the fence came down to the surface of the water, where the Creek passed out, but we found, by careful prodding with a stick, that the hole between the boards and the bottom of the Creek was sufficiently large to allow the passage of our bodies, and there had been no stakes driven or other precautions used to prevent egress by this channel.  A guard was posted there, and probably ordered to stand at the edge of the stream, but it smelled so vilely in those scorching days that he had consulted his feelings and probably his health, by retiring to the top of the bank, a rod or more distant.  We watched night after night, and at last were gratified to find that none went nearer the Creak than the top of this bank.  Then we waited for the moon to come right, so that the first part of the night should be dark.  This took several days, but at last we knew that the next night she would not rise until between 9 and 10 o'clock, which would give us nearly two hours of the dense darkness of a moonless Summer night in the South.  We had first thought of saving up some rations for the trip, but then reflected that these would be ruined by the filthy water into which we must sink to go under the fence.  It was not difficult to abandon the food idea, since it was very hard to force ourselves to lay by even the smallest portion of our scanty rations.  As the next day wore on, our minds were wrought up into exalted tension by the rapid approach of the supreme moment, with all its chances and consequences.  The experience of the past few months was not such as to mentally fit us for such a hazard.  It prepared us for sullen, uncomplaining endurance, for calmly contemplating the worst that could come; but it did not strengthen that fiber of mind that leads to venturesome activity and daring exploits.  Doubtless the weakness of our bodies reacted upon our spirits.  We contemplated all the perils that confronted us; perils that, now looming up with impending nearness, took a clearer and more threatening shape than they had ever done before.  We considered the desperate chances of passing the guard unseen; or, if noticed, of escaping his fire without death or severe wounds.  But supposing him fortunately evaded, then came the gauntlet of the hounds and the patrols hunting deserters.  After this, a long, weary journey, with bare feet and almost naked bodies, through an unknown country abounding with enemies; the dangers of assassination by the embittered populace; the risks of dying with hunger and fatigue in the gloomy depths of a swamp; the scanty hopes that, if we reached the seashore, we could get to our vessels.  Not one of all these contingencies failed to expand itself to all its alarming proportions, and unite with its fellows to form a dreadful vista, like the valleys filled with demons and genii, dragons and malign enchantments, which confront the heros of the \"Arabian Nights,\" when they set out to perform their exploits.  But behind us lay more miseries and horrors than a riotous imagination could conceive; before us could certainly be nothing worse.  We would put life and freedom to the hazard of a touch, and win or lose it all.  The day had been intolerably hot.  The sun's rays seemed to sear the earth, like heated irons, and the air that lay on the burning sand was broken by wavy lines, such as one sees indicate the radiation from a hot stove.  Except the wretched chain-gang plodding torturously back and forward on the hillside, not a soul nor an animal could be seen in motion outside the Stockade.  The hounds were panting in their kennel; the Rebel officers, half or wholly drunken with villainous sorgum whisky, were stretched at full length in the shade at headquarters; the half-caked gunners crouched under the shadow of the embankments of the forts, the guards hung limply over the Stockade in front of their little perches; the thirty thousand boys inside the Stockade, prone or supine upon the glowing sand, gasped for breath--for one draft of sweet, cool, wholesome air that did not bear on its wings the subtle seeds of rank corruption and death.  Everywhere was the prostration of discomfort--the inertia of sluggishness.  Only the sick moved; only the pain-racked cried out; only the dying struggled; only the agonies of dissolution could make life assert itself against the exhaustion of the heat.  Harvey and I, lying in the scanty shade of the trunk of a tall pine, and with hearts filled with solicitude as to the outcome of what the evening would bring us, looked out over the scene as we had done daily for long months, and remained silent for hours, until the sun, as if weary with torturing and slaying, began going down in the blazing West.  The groans of the thousands of sick around us, the shrieks of the rotting ones in the gangrene wards rang incessantly in our ears.  As the sun disappeared, and the heat abated, the suspended activity was restored.  The Master of the Hounds came out with his yelping pack, and started on his rounds; the Rebel officers aroused themselves from their siesta and went lazily about their duties; the fifer produced his cracked fife and piped forth his unvarying \"Bonnie Blue Flag,\" as a signal for dress parade, and drums beaten by unskilled hands in the camps of the different regiments, repeated the signal.  In time Stockade the mass of humanity became full of motion as an ant hill, and resembled it very much from our point of view, with the boys threading their way among the burrows, tents and holes.  It was becoming dark quite rapidly.  The moments seemed galloping onward toward the time when we must make the decisive step.  We drew from the dirty rag in which it was wrapped the little "]]]
