(#3)"],["body","shake of his head. \"A chap who spoke English would certainly be at a loss in the States, wouldn't he?\"  \"That's right,\" Dave said sleepily. \"Just like an American being in England. Lift, for elevator! Treacle, when it's syrup! Queue-up, when you mean standing in line. Boy, what a language! And, am I all in! Jeepers! Am I tired! Am I--\"  The sudden and abrupt slackening of the train's speed woke both boys up in a flash. In fact, it woke them up in the dark, for it was late evening outside, and while they had dozed the conductor had come in and pulled down the compartment window curtains. A very pale blue light in the corridor outside was of no more good than no light at all.  Freddy groaned aloud, flexed his stiff muscles, and peered around a corner of the window curtain.  \"Now what?\" he murmured. \"Dark as pitch outside, but I'm sure we're not even close to London yet. I say, hear those anti-aircraft guns?\"  \"With both ears,\" Dave said, and took a squint out himself.  By pressing close to the glass and trying to look in the direction of the engine, he could just barely see the long pencil-thin beams of searchlights raking the heavens far ahead. And every now and then the dark sky was stabbed by blotches of flaming red and crimson.  \"The Jerries are over again, trying to hit some more women and children,\" he said grimly. \"I hope our night boys get every darn one of them.\"  \"They'll get some, I fancy,\" Freddy said quietly. \"But why are we running so slow? That raid is miles and miles ahead of us. Besides, I always thought a moving target was much harder to hit. This blasted train might just as well go sixty miles as six, as it must be doing now.\"  \"Stay after school, Pilot Officer Farmer!\" Dave snorted. \"And here I thought you knew all the answers! My, my!\"  \"Oh, come off it!\" Freddy snapped. \"I suppose you know the reason?\"  \"Sure,\" Dave said.  \"Well, what is it?\"  \"An official secret,\" Dave said in a hoarse whisper. \"I'd tell you, but how do I know there isn't a Nazi agent under the seat?\"  \"_You'll_ be under the seat, if you don't cut it out!\" Freddy whispered back at him. \"Now, what's the great reason?\"  \"Okay, if you've got to know,\" Dave said in a patient, resigned voice. \"This is how it is, my little man. German planes carry bombs, and when they get over here they drop those bombs, see? Well, one might drop on the track way ahead of a train going sixty miles an hour, see? Well, maybe the engineer couldn't stop in time, and the train would pile up. But if the train crawls along until the all-clear is sounded, then the engineer can stop it on a dime if he should go around a curve and suddenly see a nice big bomb crater where the tracks should be. Now, right or wrong?\"  Freddy made clucking sounds with his tongue in the darkness.  \"Why, I believe the chap is right,\" he said, as though talking to himself. \"Yes, I fancy he has a little bit of something useful between those big ears of his. You are right, of course, Dave.\"  \"Ever see me when I was wrong?\" Dave taunted. Then quickly: \"No, let's not bring that up! Hey! Those planes are headed this way!\"  Dave could have saved his breath on the last. As though a huge invisible door in the sky had been opened, the thunder of the guns tripled in sound. The compartment was suddenly bathed in the pale reflection of a battery of searchlight beams that suddenly sprang into action less than fifty yards from the tracks. The train had come to a full halt now, with its headlight turned off. A moment later came the familiar drone of night-bombing Heinkels and Benz-Daimler powered Focke-Wulf 187s above the roar of the batteries of anti-aircraft guns.  For a moment Dave and Freddy watched the approach of the raiding planes. Then common sense got the best of curiosity. They stretched out on the compartment floor beside each other to protect themselves as much as possible in case any of those eggs of death should happen to land near the train. Perhaps they looked funny huddling down on the compartment floor in their best Sunday-go-to-meeting uniforms. However, in England it is not a sign of being afraid or of cowardice to fling yourself flat when the bombers come over. It is a sign of good sense. Perhaps it is true that the bomb or bullet that gets you has your name on it, and you can't escape it no matter where you are. At the same time, though, only a fool or a madman deliberately dares a bomb to do him harm.  And so Freddy and Dave hugged the floor while the raiders roared over and plastered the countryside with their loads of death and destruction. At least fifty times an earth-shaking roar, and a towering sheet of flame, made them think that was the last bomb they'd ever hear in this war, or in this world. Each time invisible hands seemed to reach down out of that roaring, flame-filled night sky and lift the train clear up off the tracks, and then let it drop back with a jarring crash. After each outburst, however, they continued to remain alive. And presently the throbbing drone died away in the distance, the roaring and barking of the guns ceased, and the searchlight beams winked out one by one. Night returned again to that section of England--night painted here and there with the glow of fires set by the bombs.  \"The big bums!\" Dave growled, and got up off the floor. \"As if you and I haven't got enough to worry about without them buzzing over to make things worse. Were you scared, Freddy?\"  \"Stiff,\" the English youth promptly replied.  \"Me, too,\" Dave said with half a chuckle. \"That's my knees you hear, still knocking together. And they say you get used to air raids. Oh boy!\"  \"You probably do,\" Freddy said. \"But I have no desire to prove it to myself. I hope the blighters didn't hit the track. It's a long walk from here to London. I say, what's that?\"  At that moment a burst of shots had shattered the comparative silence outside. Regardless of regulations, the boys threw up their compartment window and leaned out. They saw a figure stumbling through the shadows alongside the train. He was bent over double as though in pain, and his footsteps faltered. Just as he came abreast of their compartment some more shots rang out. The stumbling figure stumbled for the last time. He fell forward, flat on his face, and lay still. In a few seconds half a dozen men in uniform came rushing up. One of them flashed a light on the still figure, then bent down and rolled him over.  \"Well, that's one blighter they won't be able to count on from now on!\" a voice growled. \"A jolly good thing he's finished, too!\"  \"Right!\" a second voice said. \"If we hadn't been a patrol, it might have turned out a mess for this train. Fancy the beggar trying to let them know where it was!\"  \"I say there!\" Freddy called, and leaned farther out the window. \"What's all this?\"  \"Keep back in that train, and--!\" a voice started to say, but stopped as the flashlight beam caught Dave and Freddy for a second in its glow. \"Oh, sorry, sir,\" the same voice spoke again. \"Thought you were just nosy civilians, not R.A.F. Well, sir, we caught another one of them Fifth Column beggars trying to do us harm.\"  \"Yes, sir; that's right, sir,\" another voice broke in. \"We were on our usual patrol along the track when suddenly we saw some bloke slinking along ahead of us. The raiders weren't even close, then, so we just followed this beggar and didn't challenge him. Well, strike me pink, sir, if he didn't drop down on the tracks, and whip one of them red flare things from his pocket and start to light it.\"  \"But he didn't get away with it, I can tell you, sir,\" the first voice spoke up. \"Me and Harry, here, right ups and jumps on him before he's even got the match to it. But he's a strong one, and he gives us a bit of a fight, and--\"  \"A bit of a fight?\" the other voice interrupted again. \"The blighter tosses us around like we're a couple of rag dolls, and starts scooting down the track. By then the bombers are right over us, and--Well, I guess you heard the things they dropped. Anyway, we lose this blighter for a bit during the mess-up. Then we spot him trying to get on the train. We don't bother to challenge, now. We just let him have what he deserves. And here he is. A good thing, too!\"  \"A _very_ good thing,\" Freddy added. \"Congratulations. You're air raid wardens, aren't you?\"  \"That's right, sir,\" one of them replied. \"Too old for any regular military work, but we're jolly well glad to do what we can to help.\"  Dave looked down at the still figure on the ground. But for the watchfulness and constant vigilance of those \"old\" men, that dead Nazi spy might have lighted the signal flare on the track and made it possible for the German bombers overhead to see the slow moving train. But for those \"old\" men a bomb might have come screaming down to strike the train and blow one Dave Dawson and one Freddy Farmer straight into the next world. Dave glanced up at the men, and his eyes glowed with frank and open admiration.  \"And without your help,\" he said, \"England would be in a pretty tough spot. She can thank you fellows for a lot--and how!\"  The air raid wardens chuckled in an embarrassed sort of way.  \"Well, thank you, sir,\" one of them said. \"It's mighty nice of you to put it that way. We're glad to do our bit, though. You sound like a Yank, sir.\"  \"Oh, don't mind that,\" Freddy spoke up with a laugh before Dave could say a word. \"You'd be surprised how he mangled the language at first. But he's really doing awfully well--for a little fellow. The squadron commander's going to let him taste his first cup of tea next week. And--_Ouch!_\"  Dave had eased off the window catch so that it slid down on Freddy's neck. He held it there with his hands and grinned at the air raid wardens through the glass. They roared with laughter. Then as the train started to move, Dave released Freddy's neck and pushed the window up.  \"Good luck!\" he shouted, and leaned out. \"Thumbs up, mates!\"  \"The same to you, sir!\" they shouted back. \"Thumbs up, R.A.F."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41715"],["title","Dave Dawson with the R.A.F. (#4)"],["body","!\"  The train picked up speed, and another little incident in the war careers of Dave Dawson and Freddy Farmer became history. They closed the window, pulled the curtain down, and sank back on the seats. Freddy rubbed the back of his neck and glared at Dave's grinning face.  \"Go ahead and grin, you queer-looking ape,\" he muttered. \"But I'll get back at you, no fear. And when I do, you'll jolly well know it, too.\"  \"Let that be a lesson to you to speak of your superiors in the future with more respect,\" Dave chuckled. \"You're lucky, my little man, I didn't make you keep your head hanging out there all the way to London. But, gee, you English are certainly swell people!\"  \"Naturally,\" Freddy said in mock gravity. \"Look who we are, my dear fellow. And just think how fortunate you are to have the opportunity to observe and learn.\"  \"No kidding, though,\" Dave said, \"Hitler just hasn't a chance. It gave me a great kick to meet those air raid wardens back there.\"  \"I know what you mean,\" Freddy said, and nodded. \"It isn't just the Army, and the Navy, and the Air Force fighting Hitler, now. It's England--all of England from the oldest right down to the youngest.\"  \"What a dope Hitler was even to think he could get away with it!\" Dave murmured. \"Boy, oh boy! Is that guy riding for one big fall!\"  \"And I jolly well hope it will be soon!\" Freddy echoed. \"And that reminds me. I certainly wish I knew what Air Vice-Marshal Saunders wants of us!\"  Dave groaned and slid down on the seat.  \"My pal!\" he sighed unhappily. \"Just when I was all nice and relaxed, you'd have to go and bring _that_ up!\"     CHAPTER FOUR  _Nazi Wings Over London_   Dave gave the bell-hop a shilling and waited for the boy to step out into the hall and close the door. Then he took three running steps, jumped, and landed flat on his back on the bed. The springs squeaked in protest but didn't give way. Dave flung out his arms and sighed loudly.  \"Boy, a real bed!\" he exclaimed. \"Look, Freddy, this is a bed. Springs, mattress, sheets, blankets, and everything. And it's all mine until tomorrow. Of course those things we have out at the squadron aren't too tough. But this! This is a real bed. Turn out that light, pal. I'm practically asleep right now. Gosh! That train took a million years, didn't it?\"  Freddy didn't reply at once. He slung his suitcase onto the other bed, then came over and grabbed Dave by the feet. A good yank and Dave was on the floor.  \"You're not using that bed, yet,\" Freddy grinned down into his startled face. \"There's plenty of time for your beauty sleep. First we're going out to have a look at the black-out.\"  \"Going out?\" Dave groaned and got slowly to his feet. \"Me go out and crack my shins against things in the dark? Nit, nat, no, my little man. Mrs. Dawson's pride and joy is going to bed. And I'm not kidding.\"  Freddy grinned wickedly and dropped into a wrestler's crouch.  \"You think so?\" he murmured. \"Right you are! Just try and get into that bed.\"  \"So that's it, huh?\" Dave grunted and took a cautious step forward. \"I've got to tie and gag you first? Or maybe you didn't hear me. _I'm_ going to bed. You take London and the black-out. Me, I'm taking the bed. I--\"  Dave cut the last off short and leaped forward, but Freddy was too quick for him. The English youth darted to the side, then turned in a flash and caught Dave's arms and pinned them behind his back.  \"Do you go quietly with me, my little American chap?\" he said. \"Or shall I phone down for the Savoy Hotel manager to come up here and give me a hand?\"  Dave struggled for a second or two, but was unable to break his friend's hold.  \"Darned if the youngster hasn't a little bit of strength, at that!\" he said in mocking surprise. \"I'd better not be so easy with him after this. Okay, you win. Stop breaking my arms.\"  \"We go for a walk?\" Freddy asked, still keeping his hold.  \"Okay, we walk,\" Dave said, and groaned wearily. \"But if you fall down a man-hole--and you know what I hope--don't go yelling at me for help.\"  Freddy released his grip and stepped quickly backward. Dave rubbed his arms and scowled at him.  \"Yeah, you do know a couple of tricks, don't you,\" he grunted. \"But look. Why can't we see London in the daytime, when it's light? I'm dead on my feet, no kidding. You'd--\"  Dave didn't finish. At that moment the familiar but always nerve-rasping wail of the air raid siren filled the night air outside. Freddy jumped across the room, and flipped off the light switch. Then the two went over to the window and pulled aside the black-out curtains. Far to the east the black sky was being stabbed by long pencils of white light that slowly swung back and forth from horizon to horizon. In a moment there came the dull pounding of distant anti-aircraft batteries. The sound grew louder and sharper as it drew near. Suddenly both boys jumped as a battery nearby went into savage, furious action. It was so close it seemed practically under their feet.  \"Holy smokes!\" Dave gulped, and backed away from the window. \"I swear I saw those shells going right up past the end of my nose. Get back from that window, Freddy. Concussion might blow in that glass and do plenty to your face. Let's--\"  _Br-r-rump!_  The sound of an exploding bomb a few blocks away cut Dave's words off short. He looked at Freddy, and they both grinned sheepishly.  \"I guess you're right!\" Dave exclaimed. \"I'm not going to bed. Let's go borrow a couple of tin helmets from the manager, if he has any, and go up on the roof.\"  \"The roof?\" Freddy echoed, and his eyes widened suddenly. \"What in the world?\"  _Wha-a-ang! Br-r-rump!_  Two bombs let go in rapid succession. They seemed to explode almost right outside the window. Dave and Freddy threw themselves flat on the floor between the twin beds, and held their breath. The hotel rocked and shook violently, and there was the tinkle of glass as the shattered window spilled into the room. They waited until the echo of the explosions had died away, and then got slowly to their feet. There was just a hole now where the window had been--a hole that looked out on a world gone suddenly mad with roaring sound and flashing red, orange and yellow flame. Freddy groped for Dave's hand and shook it warmly.  \"Thanks, very much,\" he said in a tight voice.  \"Thanks?\" Dave murmured. \"For what?\"  \"For reminding me to keep away from windows during a bombing raid,\" Freddy said. \"But just before that blighter scared ten years off my life, what were you saying? Oh, yes. You want to go up on the roof?\"  \"Sure,\" Dave said with a nod. \"For a look. We'll be as safe there as any place. If one's coming, it'll come. Just standing here waiting gives me the creeps, anyway.\"  \"Me, too,\" Freddy agreed. \"Let's go, then. Bet the manager's in the raid shelter, though, and won't dig up tin helmets for us for love nor money.\"  \"Well, we can try,\" Dave said. \"And--Drop, Freddy! Here comes another!\"  Dave's words of warning were just a waste of breath. The screaming whistle of that bomb hurtling downward cut through all sound. As Dave flung himself flat again, he had the crazy feeling of listening to some huge invisible giant tearing off the top of the world. Even the anti-aircraft battery close to the hotel was drowned out by the unearthly sound of that falling bomb. Then it struck, and the hotel seemed to rise right straight up in the air. Dave was sure he could feel the floor heave under him. He closed his eyes tight, and held his breath. For a long moment everything seemed to stop dead. Then the hotel settled back like something alive but so very, very tired. A second later there was a short series of sharp cracking sounds, and ceiling plaster fell down on the two R.A.F. pilots.  \"That baby was trying to mean business!\" Dave said, and got to his feet again. \"Hitler must know we're in town, the way so many of them are coming close. Hey, that _did_ hit close. The building next door!\"  The hole where the window had been was now like the entrance to a long blazing tunnel. Thirty feet away the three upper floors of a building were blazing fiercely. And when the two boys leaped over to the window hole, they saw that the entire front of the building had been torn away by the terrific blast. In the glow of the flames they could see right into rooms full of broken and mangled furniture and apartment furnishings. On the rear wall of one room was a framed picture of King George and Queen Elizabeth. Everything else in the room was wrecked beyond possible recognition by its owners, but the picture of the King and Queen was untouched. It hung on the blast-scorched wall as straight as could be.  Something about that picture hanging there touched a note deep in Dave Dawson. He stared at it for a moment in almost reverent awe. Then, clicking his heels, he brought his hand up in smart salute.  \"There'll always be an England,\" he murmured softly.  Freddy Farmer caught the direction of his gaze, looked himself and saluted in turn.  \"Always!\" he said with deep tenderness in his voice.  At that moment a shrill cry of pain came to them from out of the burning building. There was a second cry, and a third. They could see nothing but the fierce glow of the flames, but the cries seemed to come from the rear of the fourth floor.  \"There are wounded people in that building!\" Freddy cried.  \"Trapped, and probably can't get out!\" Dave added. \"And it's a cinch their cries can't be heard by the fire wardens down there in the street. What say, Freddy?\"  \"Of course!\" the English youth shouted, and went bounding for the door.  The elevators had stopped running, so they went down the stairs three and four at a time. They dashed through the vacant lobby, out the front door, and along the short court that led out onto the Strand. There they turned left and headed for a fire lieutenant directing his men at work trying to put out the fire in the bomb-hit building. Dave grabbed him by the arm, and pointed up.  \"There are some people trapped on the"]]]
