TALMAGE,   One of the Twelve Apostles of the Church    PREPARED BY APPOINTMENT, AND PUBLISHED BY THE CHURCH    Eleventh Edition in English   INCLUDING THE FIFTY-SECOND THOUSAND    THE DESERET NEWS,   SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH.   1919       ENTERED ACCORDING TO ACT OF CONGRESS   IN THE YEAR 1890,   BY JAMES E. TALMAGE,   IN THE OFFICE OF THE LIBRARIAN OF   CONGRESS, AT WASHINGTON.    COPYRIGHT 1913   BY JOSEPH F. SMITH   TRUSTEE-IN-TRUST FOR THE CHURCH OF   JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.     PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.   The lectures herewith presented have been prepared in accordance with the request and appointment of the First Presidency of the Church. The greater number of the addresses were delivered before the Theology Class of the Church University; and, after the close of the class sessions, the lectures were continued before other Church organizations engaged in the study of theology. To meet the desire expressed by the Church authorities,--that the lectures be published for use in the various educational institutions of the Church,--the matter has been revised, and is now presented in this form.  In anticipation of probable question or criticism regarding the disparity of length of the several lectures, it may be stated that each of the addresses occupied two or more class sessions, and that the present arrangement of the matter in separate lectures is rather one of compilation than of original presentation.  The author's thanks are due and are heartily rendered to the members of the committee appointed by the First Presidency, whose painstaking and efficient examination of the manuscript prior to the delivery of the lectures, has inspired some approach to confidence in the prospective value of the book among members of the Church. The committee here referred to consisted of Elders Francis M. Lyman, Abraham H. Cannon, and Anthon H. Lund, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles; Elder George Reynolds, one of the Presidents of the Presiding Quorum of Seventy; Elder John Nicholson, and Dr. Karl G. Maeser.  The lectures are now published by the Church, and with them goes the hope of the author that they may prove of some service to the many students of the scriptures among our people, and to other earnest inquirers into the doctrines and practices of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.    JAMES E. TALMAGE.  Salt Lake City, Utah, April 3, 1899.   PREFACE TO THE TENTH EDITION.

We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.  2. We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.  3. We believe that through the atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.  4. We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are:--(1) Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; (2) Repentance; (3) Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; (4) Laying on of Hands for the Gift of the Holy Ghost.  5. We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands, by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.  6. We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, viz.: apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.  7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, etc.  8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as it is translated correctly; We also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.  9. We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.  10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion will be built upon this [the American] continent; That Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, That the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.  11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where or what they may.  12. We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.  13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul. We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.--Joseph Smith.     LECTURES  ON  THE ARTICLES OF FAITH  OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.     LECTURE I.  INTRODUCTORY.   =1. Importance of Theological Study.=--In the short period of time that measures the span of mortal existence, it is not possible for man to explore any considerable portion of the vast realm of knowledge; it becomes, therefore, the part of wisdom to select for study the branches that promise to prove of the greatest worth. All truth is of value--above price indeed in its place; yet with respect to their possible application, some truths are of incomparably greater worth than are others. A knowledge of the principles of trade is essential to the success of the merchant; an acquaintance with the laws of navigation is demanded of the mariner; familiarity with the relation of soil and crops is indispensable to the"]]]
