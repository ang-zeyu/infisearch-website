All of our Princes and Rulers have grown upon this one bush from time immemorial.\"  They stood before it in silent admiration.  On the central stalk stood poised the figure of a girl so exquisitely formed and colored and so lovely in the expression of her delicate features that Dorothy thought she had never seen so sweet and adorable a creature in all her life. The maiden's gown was soft as satin and fell about her in ample folds, while dainty lace-like traceries trimmed the bodice and sleeves.  Her flesh was fine and smooth as polished ivory, and her poise expressed both dignity and grace.  \"Who is this?\" asked the Wizard, curiously.  The Prince had been staring hard at the girl on the bush.  Now he answered, with a touch of uneasiness in his cold tones:  \"She is the Ruler destined to be my successor, for she is a Royal Princess.  When she becomes fully ripe I must abandon the sovereignty of the Mangaboos to her.\"  \"Isn't she ripe now?\" asked Dorothy.  He hesitated.  \"Not quite,\" said he, finally.  \"It will be several days before she needs to be picked, or at least that is my judgment.  I am in no hurry to resign my office and be planted, you may be sure.\"  \"Probably not,\" declared the Wizard, nodding.  \"This is one of the most unpleasant things about our vegetable lives,\" continued the Prince, with a sigh, \"that while we are in our full prime we must give way to another, and be covered up in the ground to sprout and grow and give birth to other people.\"  \"I'm sure the Princess is ready to be picked,\" asserted Dorothy, gazing hard at the beautiful girl on the bush.  \"She's as perfect as she can be.\"  \"Never mind,\" answered the Prince, hastily, \"she will be all right for a few days longer, and it is best for me to rule until I can dispose of you strangers, who have come to our land uninvited and must be attended to at once.\"  \"What are you going to do with us?\" asked Zeb.  \"That is a matter I have not quite decided upon,\" was the reply.  \"I think I shall keep this Wizard until a new Sorcerer is ready to pick, for he seems quite skillful and may be of use to us.  But the rest of you must be destroyed in some way, and you cannot be planted, because I do not wish horses and cats and meat people growing all over our country.\"  \"You needn't worry,\" said Dorothy.  \"We wouldn't grow under ground, I'm sure.\"  \"But why destroy my friends?\" asked the little Wizard.  \"Why not let them live?\"  \"They do not belong here,\" returned the Prince.  \"They have no right to be inside the earth at all.\"  \"We didn't ask to come down here; we fell,\" said Dorothy.  \"That is no excuse,\" declared the Prince, coldly.  The children looked at each other in perplexity, and the Wizard sighed. Eureka rubbed her paw on her face and said in her soft, purring voice:  \"He won't need to destroy ME, for if I don't get something to eat pretty soon I shall starve to death, and so save him the trouble.\"  \"If he planted you, he might grow some cat-tails,\" suggested the Wizard.  \"Oh, Eureka! perhaps we can find you some milk-weeds to eat,\" said the boy.  \"Phoo!\" snarled the kitten; \"I wouldn't touch the nasty things!\"  \"You don't need milk, Eureka,\" remarked Dorothy; \"you are big enough now to eat any kind of food.\"  \"If I can get it,\" added Eureka.  \"I'm hungry myself,\" said Zeb.  \"But I noticed some strawberries growing in one of the gardens, and some melons in another place.  These people don't eat such things, so perhaps on our way back they will let us get them.\"  \"Never mind your hunger,\" interrupted the Prince.  \"I shall order you destroyed in a few minutes, so you will have no need to ruin our pretty melon vines and berry bushes.  Follow me, please, to meet your doom.\"     5.  Dorothy Picks the Princess   The words of the cold and moist vegetable Prince were not very comforting, and as he spoke them he turned away and left the enclosure. The children, feeling sad and despondent, were about to follow him when the Wizard touched Dorothy softly on her shoulder.  \"Wait!\" he whispered.  \"What for?\" asked the girl.  \"Suppose we pick the Royal Princess,\" said the Wizard.  \"I'm quite sure she's ripe, and as soon as she comes to life she will be the Ruler, and may treat us better than that heartless Prince intends to.\"  \"All right!\" exclaimed Dorothy, eagerly.  \"Let's pick her while we have the chance, before the man with the star comes back.\"  So together they leaned over the great bush and each of them seized one hand of the lovely Princess.  \"Pull!\" cried Dorothy, and as they did so the royal lady leaned toward them and the stems snapped and separated from her feet.  She was not at all heavy, so the Wizard and Dorothy managed to lift her gently to the ground.  The beautiful creature passed her hands over her eyes an instant, tucked in a stray lock of hair that had become disarranged, and after a look around the garden made those present a gracious bow and said, in a sweet but even toned voice:  \"I thank you very much.\"  \"We salute your Royal Highness!\" cried the Wizard, kneeling and kissing her hand.  Just then the voice of the Prince was heard calling upon them to hasten, and a moment later he returned to the enclosure, followed by a number of his people.  Instantly the Princess turned and faced him, and when he saw that she was picked the Prince stood still and began to tremble.  \"Sir,\" said the Royal Lady, with much dignity, \"you have wronged me greatly, and would have wronged me still more had not these strangers come to my rescue.  I have been ready for picking all the past week, but because you were selfish and desired to continue your unlawful rule, you left me to stand silent upon my bush.\"  \"I did not know that you were ripe,\" answered the Prince, in a low voice.  \"Give me the Star of Royalty!\" she commanded.  Slowly he took the shining star from his own brow and placed it upon that of the Princess.  Then all the people bowed low to her, and the Prince turned and walked away alone.  What became of him afterward our friends never knew.  The people of Mangaboo now formed themselves into a procession and marched toward the glass city to escort their new ruler to her palace and to perform those ceremonies proper to the occasion.  But while the people in the procession walked upon the ground the Princess walked in the air just above their heads, to show that she was a superior being and more exalted than her subjects.  No one now seemed to pay any attention to the strangers, so Dorothy and Zeb and the Wizard let the train pass on and then wandered by themselves into the vegetable gardens.  They did not bother to cross the bridges over the brooks, but when they came to a stream they stepped high and walked in the air to the other side.  This was a very interesting experience to them, and Dorothy said:  \"I wonder why it is that we can walk so easily in the air.\"  \"Perhaps,\" answered the Wizard, \"it is because we are close to the center of the earth, where the attraction of gravitation is very slight.  But I've noticed that many queer things happen in fairy countries.\"  \"Is this a fairy country?\" asked the boy.  \"Of course it is,\" returned Dorothy promptly.  \"Only a fairy country could have veg'table people; and only in a fairy country could Eureka and Jim talk as we do.\"  \"That's true,\" said Zeb, thoughtfully.  In the vegetable gardens they found the strawberries and melons, and several other unknown but delicious fruits, of which they ate heartily. But the kitten bothered them constantly by demanding milk or meat, and called the Wizard names because he could not bring her a dish of milk by means of his magical arts.  As they sat upon the grass watching Jim, who was still busily eating, Eureka said:  \"I don't believe you are a Wizard at all!\"  \"No,\" answered the little man, \"you are quite right.  In the strict sense of the word I am not a Wizard, but only a humbug.\"  \"The Wizard of Oz has always been a humbug,\" agreed Dorothy.  \"I've known him for a long time.\"  \"If that is so,\" said the boy, \"how could he do that wonderful trick with the nine tiny piglets?\"  \"Don't know,\" said Dorothy, \"but it must have been humbug.\"  \"Very true,\" declared the Wizard, nodding at her.  \"It was necessary to deceive that ugly Sorcerer and the Prince, as well as their stupid people; but I don't mind telling you, who are my friends, that the thing was only a trick.\"  \"But I saw the little pigs with my own eyes!\" exclaimed Zeb.  \"So did I,\" purred the kitten.  \"To be sure,\" answered the Wizard.  \"You saw them because they were there.  They are in my inside pocket now.  But the pulling of them apart and pushing them together again was only a sleight-of-hand trick.\"  \"Let's see the pigs,\" said Eureka, eagerly.  The little man felt carefully in his pocket and pulled out the tiny piglets, setting them upon the grass one by one, where they ran around and nibbled the tender blades.  \"They're hungry, too,\" he said.  \"Oh, what cunning things!\" cried Dorothy, catching up one and petting it.  \"Be careful!\" said the piglet, with a squeal, \"you're squeezing me!\"  \"Dear me!\" murmured the Wizard, looking at his pets in astonishment. \"They can actually talk!\"  \"May I eat one of them?\" asked the kitten, in a pleading voice.  \"I'm awfully hungry.\"  \"Why, Eureka,\" said Dorothy, reproachfully, \"what a cruel question!  It would be dreadful to eat these dear little things.\"  \"I should say so!\" grunted another of the piglets, looking uneasily at the kitten; \"cats are cruel things.\"  \"I'm not cruel,\" replied the kitten, yawning.  \"I'm just hungry.\"  \"You cannot eat my piglets, even if you are starving,\"  declared the little man, in a stern voice.  \"They are the only things I have to prove I'm a wizard.\"  \"How did they happen to be so little?\" asked Dorothy.  \"I never saw such small pigs before.\"  \"They are from the Island of Teenty-Weent,\" said the Wizard, \"where everything is small because it's a small island.  A sailor brought them to Los"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/420"],["title","Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz (#6)"],["body","and I gave him nine tickets to the circus for them.\"  \"But what am I going to eat?\" wailed the kitten, sitting in front of Dorothy and looking pleadingly into her face.  \"There are no cows here to give milk; or any mice, or even grasshoppers.  And if I can't eat the piglets you may as well plant me at once and raise catsup.\"  \"I have an idea,\" said the Wizard, \"that there are fishes in these brooks.  Do you like fish?\"  \"Fish!\" cried the kitten.  \"Do I like fish?  Why, they're better than piglets--or even milk!\"  \"Then I'll try to catch you some,\" said he.  \"But won't they be veg'table, like everything else here?\" asked the kitten.  \"I think not.  Fishes are not animals, and they are as cold and moist as the vegetables themselves.  There is no reason, that I can see, why they may not exist in the waters of this strange country.\"  Then the Wizard bent a pin for a hook and took a long piece of string from his pocket for a fish-line.  The only bait he could find was a bright red blossom from a flower; but he knew fishes are easy to fool if anything bright attracts their attention, so he decided to try the blossom.  Having thrown the end of his line in the water of a nearby brook he soon felt a sharp tug that told him a fish had bitten and was caught on the bent pin; so the little man drew in the string and, sure enough, the fish came with it and was landed safely on the shore, where it began to flop around in great excitement.  The fish was fat and round, and its scales glistened like beautifully cut jewels set close together; but there was no time to examine it closely, for Eureka made a jump and caught it between her claws, and in a few moments it had entirely disappeared.  \"Oh, Eureka!\" cried Dorothy, \"did you eat the bones?\"  \"If it had any bones, I ate them,\" replied the kitten, composedly, as it washed its face after the meal.  \"But I don't think that fish had any bones, because I didn't feel them scratch my throat.\"  \"You were very greedy,\" said the girl.  \"I was very hungry,\" replied the kitten.  The little pigs had stood huddled in a group, watching this scene with frightened eyes.  \"Cats are dreadful creatures!\" said one of them.  \"I'm glad we are not fishes!\" said another.  \"Don't worry,\"  Dorothy murmured, soothingly,  \"I'll not let the kitten hurt you.\"  Then she happened to remember that in a corner of her suit-case were one or two crackers that were left over from her luncheon on the train, and she went to the buggy and brought them.  Eureka stuck up her nose at such food, but the tiny piglets squealed delightedly at the sight of the crackers and ate them up in a jiffy.  \"Now let us go back to the city,\" suggested the Wizard.  \"That is, if Jim has had enough of the pink grass.\"  The cab-horse, who was browsing near, lifted his head with a sigh.  \"I've tried to eat a lot while I had the chance,\" said he, \"for it's likely to be a long while between meals in this strange country.  But I'm ready to go, now, at any time you wish.\"  So, after the Wizard had put the piglets back into his inside pocket, where they cuddled up and went to sleep, the three climbed into the buggy and Jim started back to the town.  \"Where shall we stay?\" asked the girl.  \"I think I shall take possession of the House of the Sorcerer,\" replied the Wizard; \"for the Prince said in the presence of his people that he would keep me until they picked another Sorcerer, and the new Princess won't know but that we belong there.\"  They agreed to this plan, and when they reached the great square Jim drew the buggy into the big door of the domed hall.  \"It doesn't look very homelike,\" said Dorothy, gazing around at the bare room.  \"But it's a place to stay, anyhow.\"  \"What are those holes up there?\" enquired the boy, pointing to some openings that appeared near the top of the dome.  \"They look like doorways,\" said Dorothy; \"only there are no stairs to get to them.\"  \"You forget that stairs are unnecessary,\" observed the Wizard.  \"Let us walk up, and see where the doors lead to.\"  With this he began walking in the air toward the high openings, and Dorothy and Zeb followed him.  It was the same sort of climb one experiences when walking up a hill, and they were nearly out of breath when they came to the row of openings, which they perceived to be doorways leading into halls in the upper part of the house.  Following these halls they discovered many small rooms opening from them, and some were furnished with glass benches, tables and chairs.  But there were no beds at all.  \"I wonder if these people never sleep,\" said the girl.  \"Why, there seems to be no night at all in this country,\" Zeb replied. \"Those colored suns are exactly in the same place they were when we came, and if there is no sunset there can be no night.\"  \"Very true,\" agreed the Wizard.  \"But it is a long time since I have had any sleep, and I'm tired.  So I think I shall lie down upon one of these hard glass benches and take a nap.\"  \"I will, too,\" said Dorothy, and chose a little room at the end of the hall.  Zeb walked down again to unharness Jim, who, when he found himself free, rolled over a few times and then settled down to sleep, with Eureka nestling comfortably beside his big, boney body.  Then the boy returned to one of the upper rooms, and in spite of the hardness of the glass bench was soon deep in slumberland.     6.  The Mangaboos Prove Dangerous   When the Wizard awoke the six colored suns were shining down upon the Land of the Mangaboos just as they had done ever since his arrival. The little man, having had a good sleep, felt rested and refreshed, and looking through the glass partition of the room he saw Zeb sitting up on his bench and yawning.  So the Wizard went in to him.  \"Zeb,\" said he, \"my balloon is of no further use in this strange country, so I may as well leave it on the square where it fell.  But in the basket-car are some things I would like to keep with me.  I wish you would go and fetch my satchel, two lanterns, and a can of kerosene oil that is under the seat.  There is nothing else that I care about.\"  So the boy went willingly upon the errand, and by the time he had returned Dorothy was awake.  Then the three held a counsel to decide what they should do next, but could think of no way to better their condition.  \"I don't like these veg'table people,\" said the little girl.  \"They're cold and flabby, like cabbages, in spite of their prettiness.\"  \"I agree with you.  It is because there is no warm blood in them,\" remarked the Wizard.  \"And they have no hearts; so they can't love anyone--not even themselves,\" declared the boy.  \"The Princess is lovely to look at,\" continued Dorothy, thoughtfully; \"but I don't care much for her, after all.  If there was any other place to go, I'd like to go there.\"  \"But IS there any other place?\" asked the Wizard.  \"I don't know,\" she answered.  Just then they heard the big voice of Jim the cab-horse calling to them, and going to the doorway leading to the dome they found the Princess and a throng of her people had entered the House of the Sorcerer.  So they went down to greet the beautiful vegetable lady, who said to them:  \"I have been talking with my advisors about you meat people, and we have decided that you do not belong in the Land of the Mangaboos and must not remain here.\"  \"How can we go away?\" asked Dorothy.  \"Oh, you cannot go away, of course; so you must be destroyed,\" was the answer.  \"In what way?\" enquired the Wizard.  \"We shall throw you three people into the Garden of the Twining Vines,\" said the Princess, \"and they will soon crush you and devour your bodies to make themselves grow bigger.  The animals you have with you we will drive to the mountains and put into the Black Pit.  Then our country will be rid of all its unwelcome visitors.\"  \"But you are in need of a Sorcerer,\" said the Wizard, \"and not one of those growing is yet ripe enough to pick.  I am greater than any thorn-covered sorcerer that every grew in your garden.  Why destroy me?\"  \"It is true we need a Sorcerer,\" acknowledged the Princess, \"but I am informed that one of our own will be ready to pick in a few days, to take the place of Gwig, whom you cut in two before it was time for him to be planted.  Let us see your arts, and the sorceries you are able to perform.  Then I will decide whether to destroy you with the others or not.\"  At this the Wizard made a bow to the people and repeated his trick of producing the nine tiny piglets and making them disappear again.  He did it very cleverly, indeed, and the Princess looked at the strange piglets as if she were as truly astonished as any vegetable person could be.  But afterward she said:  \"I have heard of this wonderful magic.  But it accomplishes nothing of value.  What else can you do?\"  The Wizard tried to think.  Then he jointed together the blades of his sword and balanced it very skillfully upon the end of his nose.  But even that did not satisfy the Princess.  Just then his eye fell upon the lanterns and the can of kerosene oil which Zeb had brought from the car of his balloon, and he got a clever idea from those commonplace things.  \"Your Highness,\" said he, \"I will now proceed to prove my magic by creating two suns that you have never seen before; also I will exhibit a Destroyer much more dreadful that your Clinging Vines.\"  So he placed Dorothy upon one side of him and the boy upon the other and set a lantern upon each of their heads.  \"Don't laugh,\" he whispered to them, \"or you will spoil the effect of my magic.\"  Then, with much dignity and a look of vast importance upon his wrinkled face, the Wizard got out his match-box and lighted the two lanterns. The glare they made was very small when compared with the radiance of the six great colored suns; but still they gleamed steadily and clearly.  The Mangaboos were much impressed because they had never before seen any light that did not come directly from their suns.  Next the Wizard poured a pool of oil from the can "]]]
