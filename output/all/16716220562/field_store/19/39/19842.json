He saw us at the same time we did him, and being frightened put whip to the animals and ran off. We tried every way to stop him, but it was no use.  He had the start of us.  We were very fearful of the consequences of this mishap, but had no remedy, and being very tired, could do nothing else but go into the woods, go to sleep and trust to luck.  The next thing I remembered was being punched in the ribs by my comrade nearest to me, and aroused with the remark, \"We are gone up.\"  On opening my eyes, I saw four men, in citizens' dress, each of whom had a shot gun ready for use.  We were ordered to get up.  The first question asked us was:  \"Who are you.\"  This was spoken in so mild a tone as to lead me to believe that we might possibly be in the hands of gentlemen, if not indeed in those of friends. It was some time before any one answered.  The boys, by their looks and the expression of their countenances, seemed to appeal to me for a reply to get them out of their present dilemma, if possible.  Before I had time to collect my thoughts, we were startled by these words, coming from the same man that had asked the original question:  \"You had better not hesitate, for we have an idea who you are, and should it prove that we are correct, it will be the worse for you.\"  \"'Who do you think we are?' I inquired.\"  \"'Horse thieves and moss-backs,' was the reply.\"  I jumped at the conclusion instantly that in order to save our lives, we had better at once own the truth.  In a very few words I told them who we were, where we were from, how long we had been on the road, etc.  At this they withdrew a short distance from us for consultation, leaving us for the time in terrible suspense as to what our fate might be.  Soon, how ever, they returned and informed us that they would be compelled to take us to the County Jail, to await further orders from the Military Commander of the District.  While they were talking together, I took a hasty inventory of what valuables we had on hand.  I found in the crowd four silver watches, about three hundred dollars in Confederate money, and possibly, about one hundred dollars in greenbacks.  Before their return, I told the boys to be sure not to refuse any request I should make.  Said I:  \"'Gentlemen, we have here four silver watches and several hundred dollars in Confederate money and greenbacks, all of which we now offer you, if you will but allow us to proceed on our journey, we taking our own chances in the future.'\"  This proposition, to my great surprise, was refused.  I thought then that possibly I had been a little indiscreet in exposing our valuables, but in this I was mistaken, for we had, indeed, fallen into the hands of gentlemen, whose zeal for the Lost Cause was greater than that for obtaining worldly wealth, and who not only refused the bribe, but took us to a well-furnished and well-supplied farm house close by, gave us an excellent breakfast, allowing us to sit at the table in a beautiful dining-room, with a lady at the head, filled our haversacks with good, wholesome food, and allowed us to keep our property, with an admonition to be careful how we showed it again.  We were then put into a wagon and taken to Hamilton, a small town, the county seat of Hamilton County, Georgia, and placed in jail, where we remained for two days and nights --fearing, always, that the jail would be burned over our heads, as we heard frequent threats of that nature, by the mob on the streets. But the same kind Providence that had heretofore watched over us, seemed not to have deserted us in this trouble.  One of the days we were confined at this place was Sunday, and some kind-hearted lady or ladies (I only wish I knew their names, as well as those of the gentlemen who had us first in charge, so that I could chronicle them with honor here) taking compassion upon our forlorn condition, sent us a splendid dinner on a very large china platter. Whether it was done intentionally or not, we never learned, but it was a fact, however, that there was not a knife, fork or spoon upon the dish, and no table to set it upon.  It was placed on the floor, around which we soon gathered, and, with grateful hearts, we \"got away\" with it all, in an incredibly short space of time, while many men and boys looked on, enjoying our ludicrous attitudes and manners.  From here we were taken to Columbus, Ga., and again placed in jail, and in the charge of Confederate soldiers.  We could easily see that we were gradually getting into hot water again, and that, ere many days, we would have to resume our old habits in prison.  Our only hope now was that we would not be returned to Andersonville, knowing well that if we got back into the clutches of Wirz our chances for life would be slim indeed. From Columbus we were sent by rail to Macon, where we were placed in a prison somewhat similar to Andersonville, but of nothing like its pretensions to security.  I soon learned that it was only used as a kind of reception place for the prisoners who were captured in small squads, and when they numbered two or three hundred, they would be shipped to Andersonville, or some other place of greater dimensions and strength. What became of the other boys who were with me, after we got to Macon, I do not know, for I lost sight of them there.  The very next day after our arrival, there were shipped to Andersonville from this prison between two and three hundred men.  I was called on to go with the crowd, but having had a sufficient experience of the hospitality of that hotel, I concluded to play \"old soldier,\" so I became too sick to travel. In this way I escaped being sent off four different times.  Meanwhile, quite a large number of commissioned officers had been sent up from Charleston to be exchanged at Rough and Ready.  With them were about forty more than the cartel called for, and they were left at Macon for ten days or two weeks.  Among these officers were several of my acquaintance, one being Lieut. Huntly of our regiment (I am not quite sure that I am right in the name of this officer, but I think I am), through whose influence I was allowed to go outside with them on parole. It was while enjoying this parole that I got more familiarly acquainted with Captain Hurtell, or Hurtrell, who was in command of the prison at Macon, and to his honor, I here assert, that he was the only gentleman and the only officer that had the least humane feeling in his breast, who ever had charge of me while a prisoner of war after we were taken out of the hands of our original captors at Jonesville, Va.  It now became very evident that the Rebels were moving the prisoners from Andersonville and elsewhere, so as to place them beyond the reach of Sherman and Stoneman.  At my present place of confinement the fear of our recapture had also taken possession of the Rebel authorities, so the prisoners were sent off in much smaller squads than formerly, frequently not more than ten or fifteen in a gang, whereas, before, they never thought of dispatching less than two or three hundred together. I acknowledge that I began to get very uneasy, fearful that the \"old soldier\" dodge would not be much longer successful, and I would be forced back to my old haunts.  It so happened, however, that I managed to make it serve me, by getting detailed in the prison hospital as nurse, so that I was enabled to play another \"dodge\" upon the Rebel officers.  At first, when the Sergeant would come around to find out who were able to walk, with assistance, to the depot, I was shaking with a chill, which, according to my representation, had not abated in the least for several hours.  My teeth were actually chattering at the time, for I had learned how to make them do so.  I was passed.  The next day the orders for removal were more stringent than had yet been issued, stating that all who could stand it to be removed on stretchers must go.  I concluded at once that I was gone, so as soon as I learned how matters were, I got out from under my dirty blanket, stood up and found I was able to walk, to my great astonishment, of course.  An officer came early in the morning to muster us into ranks preparatory for removal.  I fell in with the rest. We were marched out and around to the gate of the prison.  Now, it so happened that just as we neared the gate of the prison, the prisoners were being marched from the Stockade.  The officer in charge of us--we numbering possibly about ten--undertook to place us at the head of the column coming out, but the guard in charge of that squad refused to let him do so.  We were then ordered to stand at one side with no guard over us but the officer who had brought us from the Hospital.  Taking this in at a glance, I concluded that now was my chance to make my second attempt to escape.  I stepped behind the gate office (a small frame building with only one room), which was not more than six feet from me, and as luck (or Providence) would have it, the negro man whose duty it was, as I knew, to wait on and take care of this office, and who had taken quite a liking for me, was standing at the back door.  I winked at him and threw him my blanket and the cup, at the same time telling him in a whisper to hide them away for me until he heard from me again.  With a grin and a nod, he accepted the trust, and I started down along the walls of the Stockade alone.  In order to make this more plain, and to show what a risk I was running at the time, I will state that between the Stockade and a brick wall, fully as high as the Stockade fence that was parallel with it, throughout its entire length on that side, there was a space of not more than thirty feet.  On the outside of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4260"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons â€” Volume 4 (#2)"],["body","Stockade was a platform, built for the guards to walk on, sufficiently clear the top to allow them to look inside with ease, and on this side, on the platform, were three guards.  I had traveled about fifty feet only, from the gate office, when I heard the command to \"Halt!\" I did so, of course.  \"Where are you going, you d---d Yank?\" said the guard.  \"Going after my clothes, that are over there in the wash,\" pointing to a small cabin just beyond the Stockade, where I happened to know that the officers had their washing done.  \"Oh, yes,\" said he; \"you are one of the Yank's that's been on, parole, are you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, hurry up, or you will get left.\"  The other guards heard this conversation and thinking it all right I was allowed to pass without further trouble.  I went to the cabin in question--for I saw the last guard on the line watching me, and boldly entered.  I made a clear statement to the woman in charge of it about how I had made my escape, and asked her to secrete me in the house until night.  I was soon convinced, however, from what she told me, as well as from my own knowledge of how things were managed in the Confederacy, that it would not be right for me to stay there, for if the house was searched and I found in it, it would be the worse for her.  Therefore, not wishing to entail misery upon another, I begged her to give me something to eat, and going to the swamp near by, succeeded in getting well without detection.  I lay there all day, and during the time had a very severe chill and afterwards a burning fever, so that when night came, knowing I could not travel, I resolved to return to the cabin and spend the night, and give myself up the next morning.  There was no trouble in returning.  I learned that my fears of the morning had not been groundless, for the guards had actually searched the house for me.  The woman told them that I had got my clothes and left the house shortly after my entrance (which was the truth except the part about the clothes), I thanked her very kindly and begged to be allowed to stay in the cabin till morning, when I would present myself at Captain H.'s office and suffer the consequences.  This she allowed me to do.  I shall ever feel grateful to this woman for her protection.  She was white and her given name was \"Sallie,\" but the other I have forgotten.  About daylight I strolled over near the office and looked around there until I saw the Captain take his seat at his desk.  I stepped into the door as soon as I saw that he was not occupied and saluted him \"a la militaire.\"  \"Who are you?\" he asked; \"you look like a Yank.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said I, \"I am called by that name since I was captured in the Federal Army.\"  \"Well, what are you doing here, and what is your name?\"  I told him.  \"Why didn't you answer to your name when it was called at the gate yesterday, sir?\"  \"I never heard anyone call my name.\"  Where were you?\"  \"I ran away down into the swamp.\"  \"Were you re-captured and brought back?\"  \"No, sir, I came back of my own accord.\"  \"What do you mean by this evasion?\"  \"I am not trying to evade, sir, or I might not have been here now.  The truth is, Captain, I have been in many prisons since my capture, and have been treated very badly in all of them, until I came here.\"  \"I then explained to him freely my escape from Andersonville, and my subsequent re-capture, how it was that I had played 'old soldier' etc.\"  \"Now,\" said I, \"Captain, as long as I am a prisoner of war, I wish to stay with you, or under your command.  This is my reason for running away yesterday, when I felt confident that if I did not do so I would be returned under Wirz's command, and, if I had been so returned, I would have killed myself rather than submit to the untold tortures which he would have put me to, for having the audacity to attempt an escape from him.\"  The Captain's attention was here called to some other matters in hand, and I was sent back into the Stockade with a command very pleasantly given, that I should stay there until ordered out, which I very gratefully promised to do, and did.  This was the last chance I ever had to talk to Captain Hurtrell, to my great sorrow, for I had really formed a liking for the man, notwithstanding the fact that he was a Rebel, and a commander of prisoners.  The next day we all had to leave Macon.  Whether we were able or not, the order was imperative.  Great was my joy when I learned that we were on the way to Savannah and not to Andersonville.  We traveled over the same road, so well described in one of your articles on Andersonville, and arrived in Savannah sometime in the afternoon of the 21st day of November, 1864.  Our squad was placed in some barracks and confined there until the next day.  I was sick at the time, so sick in fact, that I could hardly hold my head up.  Soon after, we were taken to the Florida depot, as they told us, to be shipped to some prison in those dismal swamps.  I came near fainting when this was told to us, for I was confident that I could not survive another siege of prison life, if it was anything to compare to-what I had already suffered.  When we arrived at the depot, it was raining.  The officer in charge of us wanted to know what train to put us on, for there were two, if not three, trains waiting orders to start.  He was told to march us on to a certain flat car, near by, but before giving the order he demanded a receipt for us, which the train officer refused.  We were accordingly taken back to our quarters, which proved to be a most fortunate circumstance.  On the 23d day of November, to our great relief, we were called upon to sign a parole preparatory to being sent down the river on the flat-boat to our exchange ships, then lying in the harbor.  When I say we, I mean those of us that had recently come from Macon, and a few others, who had also been fortunate in reaching Savannah in small squads.  The other poor fellows, who had already been loaded on the trains, were taken away to Florida, and many of them never lived to return.  On the 24th those of us who had been paroled were taken on board our ships, and were once more safely housed under that great, glorious and beautiful Star Spangled Banner.  Long may she wave.     CHAPTER LXIII.  DREARY WEATHER--THE COLD RAINS DISTRESS ALL AND KILL HUNDREDS--EXCHANGE OF TEN THOUSAND SICK--CAPTAIN BOWES TURNS A PRETTY, BUT NOT VERY HONEST, PENNY.  As November wore away long-continued, chill, searching rains desolated our days and nights.  The great, cold drops pelted down slowly, dismally, and incessantly.  Each seemed to beat through our emaciated frames against the very marrow of our bones, and to be battering its way remorselessly into the citadel of life, like the cruel drops that fell from the basin of the inquisitors upon the firmly-fastened head of their victim, until his reason fled, and the death-agony cramped his heart to stillness.  The lagging, leaden hours were inexpressibly dreary.  Compared with many others, we were quite comfortable, as our hut protected us from the actual beating of the rain upon our bodies; but we were much more miserable than under the sweltering heat of Andersonville, as we lay almost naked upon our bed of pine leaves, shivering in the raw, rasping air, and looked out over acres of wretches lying dumbly on the sodden sand, receiving the benumbing drench of the sullen skies without a groan or a motion.  It was enough to kill healthy, vigorous men, active and resolute, with bodies well-nourished and well clothed, and with minds vivacious and hopeful, to stand these day-and-night-long solid drenchings.  No one can imagine how fatal it was to boys whose vitality was sapped by long months in Andersonville, by coarse, meager, changeless food, by groveling on the bare earth, and by hopelessness as to any improvement of condition.  Fever, rheumatism, throat and lung diseases and despair now came to complete the work begun by scurvy, dysentery and gangrene, in Andersonville.  Hundreds, weary of the long struggle, and of hoping against hope, laid themselves down and yielded to their fate.  In the six weeks that we were at Millen, one man in every ten died.  The ghostly pines there sigh over the unnoted graves of seven hundred boys, for whom life's morning closed in the gloomiest shadows.  As many as would form a splendid regiment--as many as constitute the first born of a populous City--more than three times as many as were slain outright on our side in the bloody battle of Franklin, succumbed to this new hardship.  The country for which they died does not even have a record of their names.  They were simply blotted out of existence; they became as though they had never been.  About the middle of the month the Rebels yielded to the importunities of our Government so far as to agree to exchange ten thousand sick.  The Rebel Surgeons took praiseworthy care that our Government should profit as little as possible by this, by sending every hopeless case, every man whose lease of life was not likely to extend much beyond his reaching the parole boat.  If he once reached our receiving officers it was all that was necessary; he counted to them as much as if he had been a Goliath. A very large portion of those sent through died on the way to our lines, or within a few hours after their transports at being once more under the old Stars and Stripes had moderated.  The sending of the sick through gave our commandant--Captain Bowes--a fine opportunity to fill his pockets, by conniving at the passage of well men.  There was still considerable money in the hands of a few prisoners. All this, and more, too, were they willing to give for their lives. In the first batch that went away were two of the leading sutlers at Andersonville, who had accumulated perhaps one thousand dollars each by their shrewd and successful bartering.  It was generally believed that they gave every cent to Bowes for the privilege of leaving.  I know nothing of the truth"]]]
