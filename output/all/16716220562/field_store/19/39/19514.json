Jorun set the girl down outside her home.  \"Thank you, good sir,\" she said, curtseying. \"Won't you come in to dinner?\"  \"Well--\"  The door opened, etching the girl black against the ruddiness inside. Jorun's luminous tunic made him like a torch in the dark. \"Why, it's the star-man,\" said a woman's voice.  \"I took your daughter for a swim,\" he explained. \"I hope you don't mind.\"  \"And if we did, what would it matter?\" grumbled a bass tone. Jorun recognized Kormt; the old man must have come as a guest from his farm on the outskirts. \"What could we do about it?\"  \"Now, Granther, that's no way to talk to the gentleman,\" said the woman. \"He's been very kind. Won't you come eat with us, good sir?\"  Jorun refused twice, in case they were only being polite, then accepted gladly enough. He was tired of cookery at the inn where he and Zarek boarded. \"Thank you.\"  He entered, ducking under the low door. A single long, smoky-raftered room was kitchen, diningroom, and parlor; doors led off to the sleeping quarters. It was furnished with a clumsy elegance, skin rugs, oak wainscoting, carved pillars, glowing ornaments of hammered copper. A radium clock, which must be incredibly old, stood on the stone mantel, above a snapping fire; a chemical-powered gun, obviously of local manufacture, hung over it. Julith's parents, a plain, quiet peasant couple, conducted him to the end of the wooden table, while half a dozen children watched him with large eyes. The younger children were the only Terrans who seemed to find this removal an adventure.  The meal was good and plentiful: meat, vegetables, bread, beer, milk, ice cream, coffee, all of it from the farms hereabouts. There wasn't much trade between the few thousand communities of Earth; they were practically self-sufficient. The company ate in silence, as was the custom here. When they were finished, Jorun wanted to go, but it would have been rude to leave immediately. He went over to a chair by the fireplace, across from the one in which Kormt sprawled.  The old man took out a big-bowled pipe and began stuffing it. Shadows wove across his seamed brown face, his eyes were a gleam out of darkness. \"I'll go down to City Hall with you soon,\" he said; \"I imagine that's where the work is going on.\"  \"Yes,\" said Jorun, \"I can relieve Zarek at it. I'd appreciate it if you did come, good sir. Your influence is very steadying on these people.\"  \"It should be,\" said Kormt. \"I've been their Speaker for almost a hundred years. And my father Gerlaug was before me, and his father Kormt was before him.\" He took a brand from the fire and held it over his pipe, puffing hard, looking up at Jorun through tangled brows. \"Who was your great-grandfather?\"  \"Why--I don't know. I imagine he's still alive somewhere, but--\"  \"I thought so. No marriage. No family. No home. No tradition.\" Kormt shook, his massive head, slowly, \"I pity you Galactics!\"  \"Now please, good sir--\" Damn it all, the old clodhopper could get as irritating as a faulty computer. \"We have records that go back to before man left this planet. Records of everything. It is you who have forgotten.\"  Kormt smiled and puffed blue clouds at him. \"That's not what I meant.\"  \"Do you mean you think it is good for men to live a life that is unchanging, that is just the same from century to century--no new dreams, no new triumphs, always the same grubbing rounds of days? I cannot agree.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jorun's mind flickered over history, trying to evaluate the basic motivations of his opponent. Partly cultural, partly biological, that must be it. Once Terra had been the center of the civilized universe. But the long migration starward, especially after the fall of the First Empire, drained off the most venturesome elements of the population. That drain went on for thousands of years. Sol was backward, ruined and impoverished by the remorseless price of empire, helpless before the storms of barbarian conquest that swept back and forth between the stars. Even after peace was restored, there was nothing to hold a young man or woman of vitality and imagination here--not when you could go toward Galactic center and join the new civilization building out there. Space-traffic came ever less frequently to Sol; old machines rusted away and were not replaced; best to get out while there was still time.  Eventually there was a fixed psychosomatic type, one which lived close to the land, in primitive changeless communities and isolated farmsteads--a type content to gain its simple needs by the labor of hand, horse, or an occasional battered engine. A culture grew up which increased that rigidity. So few had visited Earth in the last several thousand years--perhaps one outsider a century, stopping briefly off on his way to somewhere else--that there was no challenge or encouragement to alter. The Terrans didn't _want_ more people, more machines, more anything; they wished only to remain as they were.  You couldn't call them stagnant. Their life was too healthy, their civilization too rich in its own way--folk art, folk music, ceremony, religion, the intimacy of family life which the Galactics had lost--for that term. But to one who flew between the streaming suns, it was a small existence.  Kormt's voice broke in on his reverie. \"Dreams, triumphs, work, deeds, love and life and finally death and the long sleep in the earth,\" he said. \"Why should we want to change them? They never grow old; they are new for each child that is born.\"  \"Well,\" said Jorun, and stopped. You couldn't really answer that kind of logic. It wasn't logic at all, but something deeper.  \"Well,\" he started over, after a while, \"as you know, this evacuation was forced on us, too. We don't want to move you, but we must.\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said Kormt. \"You have been very nice about it. It would have been easier, in a way, if you'd come with fire and gun and chains for us, like the barbarians did long ago. We could have understood you better then.\"  \"At best, it will be hard for your people,\" said Jorun. \"It will be a shock, and they'll need leaders to guide them through it. You have a duty to help them out there, good sir.\"  \"Maybe.\" Kormt blew a series of smoke rings at his youngest descendant, three years old, who crowed with laughter and climbed up on his knee. \"But they'll manage.\"  \"You can't seem to realize,\" said Jorun, \"that you are the _last man on Earth_ who refuses to go. You will be _alone_. For the rest of your life! We couldn't come back for you later under any circumstances, because there'll be Hulduvian colonies between Sol and Sagittarius which we would disturb in passage. You'll be alone, I say!\"  Kormt shrugged. \"I'm too old to change my ways; there can't be many years left me, anyway. I can live well, just off the food-stores that'll be left here.\" He ruffled the child's hair, but his face drew into a scowl. \"Now, no more of that, good sir, if you please; I'm tired of this argument.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jorun nodded and fell into the silence that held the rest. Terrans would sometimes sit for hours without talking, content to be in each other's nearness. He thought of Kormt, Gerlaug's son, last man on Earth, altogether alone, living alone and dying alone; and yet, he reflected, was that solitude any greater than the one in which all men dwelt all their days?  Presently the Speaker set the child down, knocked out his pipe, and rose. \"Come, good sir,\" he said, reaching for his staff. \"Let us go.\"  They walked side by side down the street, under the dim lamps and past the yellow windows. The cobbles gave back their footfalls in a dull clatter. Once in a while they passed someone else, a vague figure which bowed to Kormt. Only one did not notice them, an old woman who walked crying between the high walls.  \"They say it is never night on your worlds,\" said Kormt.  Jorun threw him a sidelong glance. His face was a strong jutting of highlights from sliding shadow. \"Some planets have been given luminous skies,\" said the technician, \"and a few still have cities, too, where it is always light. But when every man can control the cosmic energies, there is no real reason for us to live together; most of us dwell far apart. There are very dark nights on my own world, and I cannot see any other home from my own--just the moors.\"  \"It must be a strange life,\" said Kormt. \"Belonging to no one.\"  They came out on the market-square, a broad paved space walled in by houses. There was a fountain in its middle, and a statue dug out of the ruins had been placed there. It was broken, one arm gone--but still the white slim figure of the dancing girl stood with youth and laughter, forever under the sky of Earth. Jorun knew that lovers were wont to meet here, and briefly, irrationally, he wondered how lonely the girl would be in all the millions of years to come.  The City Hall lay at the farther end of the square, big and dark, its eaves carved with dragons, and the gables topped with wing-spreading birds. It was an old building; nobody knew how many generations of men had gathered here. A long, patient line of folk stood outside it, shuffling in one by one to the registry desk; emerging, they went off quietly into the darkness, toward the temporary shelters erected for them.  Walking by the line, Jorun picked faces out of the shadows. There was a young mother holding a crying child, her head bent over it in a timeless pose, murmuring to soothe it. There was a mechanic, still sooty from his work, smiling wearily at some tired joke of the man behind him. There was a scowling, black-browed peasant who muttered a curse as Jorun went by; the rest seemed to accept their fate meekly enough. There was a priest, his head bowed, alone with his God. There was a younger man, his hands clenching and unclenching, big helpless hands, and Jorun heard him saying to someone else: \"--if they could have waited till after harvest. I hate to let good grain stand in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41064"],["title","The Chapter Ends (#3)"],["body"," field.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Jorun went into the main room, toward the desk at the head of the line. Hulking hairless Zarek was patiently questioning each of the hundreds who came hat in hand before him: name, age, sex, occupation, dependents, special needs or desires. He punches the answers out on the recorder machine, half a million lives were held in its electronic memory.  \"Oh, there you are,\" his bass rumbled. \"Where've you been?\"  \"I had to do some concy work,\" said Jorun. That was a private code term, among others: concy, conciliation, anything to make the evacuation go smoothly. \"Sorry to be so late. I'll take over now.\"  \"All right. I think we can wind the whole thing up by midnight.\" Zarek smiled at Kormt. \"Glad you came, good sir. There are a few people I'd like you to talk to.\" He gestured at half a dozen seated in the rear of the room. Certain complaints were best handled by native leaders.  Kormt nodded and strode over to the folk. Jorun heard a man begin some long-winded explanation: he wanted to take his own plow along, he'd made it himself and there was no better plow in the universe, but the star-man said there wouldn't be room.  \"They'll furnish us with all the stuff we need, son,\" said Kormt.  \"But it's _my_ plow!\" said the man. His fingers twisted his cap.  Kormt sat down and began soothing him.  The head of the line waited a few meters off while Jorun took Zarek's place. \"Been a long grind,\" said the latter. \"About done now, though. And will I be glad to see the last of this planet!\"  \"I don't know,\" said Jorun. \"It's a lovely world. I don't think I've ever seen a more beautiful one.\"  Zarek snorted. \"Me for Thonnvar! I can't wait to sit on the terrace by the Scarlet Sea, fern-trees and red grass all around, a glass of oehl in my hand and the crystal geysers in front of me. You're a funny one, Jorun.\"  The Fulkhisian shrugged slender shoulders. Zarek clapped him on the back and went out for supper and sleep. Jorun beckoned to the next Terran and settled down to the long, almost mindless routine of registration. He was interrupted once by Kormt, who yawned mightily and bade him goodnight; otherwise it was a steady, half-conscious interval in which one anonymous face after another passed by. He was dimly surprised when the last one came up. This was a plump, cheerful, middle-aged fellow with small shrewd eyes, a little more colorfully dressed than the others. He gave his occupation as merchant--a minor tradesman, he explained, dealing in the little things it was more convenient for the peasants to buy than to manufacture themselves.  \"I hope you haven't been waiting too long,\" said Jorun. Concy statement.  \"Oh, no.\" The merchant grinned. \"I knew those dumb farmers would be here for hours, so I just went to bed and got up half an hour ago, when it was about over.\"  \"Clever.\" Jorun rose, sighed, and stretched. The big room was cavernously empty, its lights a harsh glare. It was very quiet here.  \"Well, sir, I'm a middling smart chap, if I say it as shouldn't. And you know, I'd like to express my appreciation of all you're doing for us.\"  \"Can't say we're doing much.\" Jorun locked the machine.  \"Oh, the apple-knockers may not like it, but really, good sir, this hasn't been any place for a man of enterprise. It's dead. I'd have got out long ago if there'd been any transportation. Now, when we're getting back into civilization, there'll be some real opportunities. I'll make my pile inside of five years, you bet.\"  Jorun smiled, but there was a bleakness in him. What chance would this barbarian have even to get near the gigantic work of civilization--let alone comprehend it or take part in it. He hoped the little fellow wouldn't break his heart trying.  \"Well,\" he said, \"goodnight, and good luck to you.\"  \"Goodnight, sir. We'll meet again, I trust.\"  Jorun switched off the lights and went out into the square. It was completely deserted. The moon was up now, almost full, and its cold radiance dimmed the lamps. He heard a dog howling far off. The dogs of Earth--such as weren't taken along--would be lonely, too.  _Well_, he thought, _the job's over. Tomorrow, or the next day, the ships come._   4  He felt very tired, but didn't want to sleep, and willed himself back to alertness. There hadn't been much chance to inspect the ruins, and he felt it would be appropriate to see them by moonlight.  Rising into the air, he ghosted above roofs and trees until he came to the dead city. For a while he hovered in a sky like dark velvet, a faint breeze murmured around him, and he heard the remote noise of crickets and the sea. But stillness enveloped it all, there was no real sound.  Sol City, capital of the legendary First Empire, had been enormous. It must have sprawled over forty or fifty thousand square kilometers when it was in its prime, when it was the gay and wicked heart of human civilization and swollen with the lifeblood of the stars. And yet those who built it had been men of taste, they had sought out genius to create for them. The city was not a collection of buildings; it was a balanced whole, radiating from the mighty peaks of the central palace, through colonnades and parks and leaping skyways, out to the temple-like villas of the rulers. For all its monstrous size, it had been a fairy sight, a woven lace of polished metal and white, black, red stone, colored plastic, music and light--everywhere light.  Bombarded from space; sacked again and again by the barbarian hordes who swarmed maggot-like through the bones of the slain Empire; weathered, shaken by the slow sliding of Earth's crust; pried apart by patient, delicate roots; dug over by hundreds of generations of archaeologists, treasure-seekers, the idly curious; made a quarry of metal and stone for the ignorant peasants who finally huddled about it--still its empty walls and blind windows, crumbling arches and toppled pillars held a ghost of beauty and magnificence which was like a half-remembered dream. A dream the whole race had once had.  _And now we're waking up._  Jorun moved silently over the ruins. Trees growing between tumbled blocks dappled them with moonlight and shadow; the marble was very white and fair against darkness. He hovered by a broken caryatid, marveling at its exquisite leaping litheness; that girl had borne tons of stone like a flower in her hair. Further on, across a street that was a lane of woods, beyond a park that was thick with forest, lay the nearly complete outline of a house. Only its rain-blurred walls stood, but he could trace the separate rooms: here a noble had entertained his friends, robes that were fluid rainbows, jewels dripping fire, swift cynical interplay of wits like sharpened swords rising above music and the clear sweet laughter of dancing-girls; here people whose flesh was now dust had slept and made love and lain side-by-side in darkness to watch the moving pageant of the city; here the slaves had lived and worked and sometimes wept; here the children had played their ageless games under willows, between banks of roses. Oh, it had been a hard and cruel time; it was well gone but it had lived. It had embodied man, all that was noble and splendid and evil and merely wistful in the race, and now its late children had forgotten.  A cat sprang up on one of the walls and flowed noiselessly along it, hunting. Jorun shook himself and flew toward the center of the city, the imperial palace. An owl hooted somewhere, and a bat fluttered out of his way like a small damned soul blackened by hellfire. He didn't raise a wind-screen, but let the air blow around him, the air of Earth.         *       *       *       *       *  The palace was almost completely wrecked, a mountain of heaped rocks, bare bones of \"eternal\" metal gnawed thin by steady ages of wind and rain and frost, but once it must have been gigantic. Men rarely built that big nowadays, they didn't need to; and the whole human spirit had changed, become ever more abstract, finding its treasures within itself. But there had been an elemental magnificence about early man and the works he raised to challenge the sky.  One tower still stood--a gutted shell, white under the stars, rising in a filigree of columns and arches which seemed impossibly airy, as if it were built of moonlight. Jorun settled on its broken upper balcony, dizzily high above the black-and-white fantasy of the ruins. A hawk flew shrieking from its nest, then there was silence.  No--wait--another yell, ringing down the star ways, a dark streak across the moon's face. \"Hai-ah!\" Jorun recognized the joyful shout of young Cluthe, rushing through heaven like a demon on a broomstick, and scowled in annoyance. He didn't want to be bothered now.  Well, they had as much right here as he. He repressed the emotion, and even managed a smile. After all, he would have liked to feel gay and reckless at times, but he had never been able to. Jorun was little older than Cluthe--a few centuries at most--but he came of a melancholy folk; he had been born old.  Another form pursued the first. As they neared, Jorun recognized Taliuvenna's supple outline. Those two had been teamed up for one of the African districts, but--  They sensed him and came wildly out of the sky to perch on the balcony railing and swing their legs above the heights. \"How're you?\" asked Cluthe. His lean face laughed in the moonlight. \"Whoo-oo, what a flight!\"  \"I'm all right,\" said Jorun. \"You through in your sector?\"  \"Uh-huh. So we thought we'd just duck over and look in here. Last chance anyone'll ever have to do some sight-seeing on Earth.\"  Taliuvenna's full lips drooped a bit as she looked over the ruins. She came from Yunith, one of the few planets where they still kept cities, and was as much a child of their soaring arrogance as Jorun of his hills and tundras and great empty seas. \"I thought it would be bigger,\" she said.  \"Well, they were building this fifty or sixty thousand years ago,\" said"]]]
