'Don't forget there was a price--'  'I have not forgotten!' She twisted free. 'But we must go to--to Alafdhal first!'  A few minutes later the black slave let them through the wicket door. The young Turanian lay upon the divan, his arms and legs bound with heavy velvet ropes. His eyes were open, but they were like those of a mad dog, and foam was thick on his lips. Zabibi shuddered.  'Force his jaws open!' she commanded, and Conan's iron fingers accomplished the task.  Zabibi emptied the phial down the maniac's gullet. The effect was like magic. Instantly he became quiet. The glare faded from his eyes; he stared up at the girl in a puzzled way, but with recognition and intelligence. Then he fell into a normal slumber.  'When he awakes he will be quite sane,' she whispered, motioning to the silent slave.  With a deep bow he gave into her hands a small leathern bag, and drew about her shoulders a silken cloak. Her manner had subtly changed when she beckoned Conan to follow her out of the chamber.  In an arch that opened on the street, she turned to him, drawing herself up with a new regality.  'I must now tell you the truth,' she said. 'I am not Zabibi. I am Nafertari. And _he_ is not Alafdhal, a poor captain of the guardsmen. He is Jungir Khan, satrap of Zamboula.'  Conan made no comment; his scarred dark countenance was immobile.  'I lied to you because I dared not divulge the truth to anyone,' she said. 'We were alone when Jungir Khan went mad. None knew of it but myself. Had it been known that the satrap of Zamboula was a madman, there would have been instant revolt and rioting, even as Totrasmek planned, who plotted our destruction.  'You see now how impossible is the reward for which you hoped. The satrap's mistress is not--cannot be for you. But you shall not go unrewarded. Here is a sack of gold.'  She gave him the bag she had received from the slave.  'Go, now, and when the sun is come up to the palace, I will have Jungir Khan make you captain of his guard. But you will take your orders from me, secretly. Your first duty will be to march a squad to the shrine of Hanuman, ostensibly to search for clues of the priest's slayer; in reality to search for the Star of Khorala. It must be hidden there somewhere. When you find it, bring it to me. You have my leave to go now.'  He nodded, still silent, and strode away. The girl, watching the swing of his broad shoulders, was piqued to note that there was nothing in his bearing to show that he was in any way chagrined or abashed.         *       *       *       *       *  When he had rounded a corner, he glanced back, and then changed his direction and quickened his pace. A few moments later he was in the quarter of the city containing the Horse Market. There he smote on a door until from the window above a bearded head was thrust to demand the reason for the disturbance.  'A horse,' demanded Conan. 'The swiftest steed you have.'  'I open no gates at this time of night,' grumbled the horse-trader.  Conan rattled his coins.  'Dog's son knave! Don't you see I'm white, and alone? Come down, before I smash your door!'  Presently, on a bay stallion, Conan was riding toward the house of Aram Baksh.  He turned off the road into the alley that lay between the tavern compound and the date-palm garden, but he did not pause at the gate. He rode on to the northeast corner of the wall, then turned and rode along the north wall, to halt within a few paces of the northwest angle. No trees grew near the wall, but there were some low bushes. To one of these he tied his horse, and was about to climb into the saddle again, when he heard a low muttering of voices beyond the corner of the wall.  Drawing his foot from the stirrup he stole to the angle and peered around it. Three men were moving down the road toward the palm groves, and from their slouching gait he knew they were negroes. They halted at his low call, bunching themselves as he strode toward them, his sword in his hand. Their eyes gleamed whitely in the starlight. Their brutish lust shone in their ebony faces, but they knew their three cudgels could not prevail against his sword, just as he knew it.  'Where are you going?' he challenged.  'To bid our brothers put out the fire in the pit beyond the groves,' was the sullen, guttural reply. 'Aram Baksh promised us a man, but he lied. We found one of our brothers dead in the trap-chamber. We go hungry this night.'  'I think not,' smiled Conan. 'Aram Baksh will give you a man. Do you see that door?'  He pointed to a small, iron-bound portal set in the midst of the western wall.  'Wait there. Aram Baksh will give you a man.'  Backing warily away until he was out of reach of a sudden bludgeon blow, he turned and melted around the northwest angle of the wall. Reaching his horse he paused to ascertain that the blacks were not sneaking after him, and then he climbed into the saddle and stood upright on it, quieting the uneasy steed with a low word. He reached up, grasped the coping of the wall and drew himself up and over. There he studied the grounds for an instant. The tavern was built in the southwest corner of the enclosure, the remaining space of which was occupied by groves and gardens. He saw no one in the grounds. The tavern was dark and silent, and he knew all the doors and windows were barred and bolted.  Conan knew that Aram Baksh slept in a chamber that opened into a cypress-bordered path that led to the door in the western wall. Like a shadow he glided among the trees and a few moments later he rapped lightly on the chamber door.  'What is it?' asked a rumbling voice within.  'Aram Baksh!' hissed Conan. 'The blacks are stealing over the wall!'  Almost instantly the door opened, framing the tavern-keeper, naked but for his shirt, with a dagger in his hand.  He craned his neck to stare into the Cimmerian's face.  'What tale is this--_you!_'  Conan's vengeful fingers strangled the yell in his throat. They went to the floor together and Conan wrenched the dagger from his enemy's hand. The blade glinted in the starlight, and blood spurted. Aram Baksh made hideous noises, gasping and gagging on a mouthful of blood. Conan dragged him to his feet and again the dagger slashed, and most of the curly beard fell to the floor.  Still gripping his captive's throat--for a man can scream incoherently even with his tongue slit--Conan dragged him out of the dark chamber and down the cypress-shadowed path, to the iron-bound door in the outer wall. With one hand he lifted the bolt and threw the door open, disclosing the three shadowy figures which waited like black vultures outside. Into their eager arms Conan thrust the innkeeper.  A horrible, blood-choked scream rose from the Zamboulan's throat, but there was no response from the silent tavern. The people there were used to screams outside the wall. Aram Baksh fought like a wild man, his distended eyes turned frantically on the Cimmerian's face. He found no mercy there. Conan was thinking of the scores of wretches who owed their bloody doom to this man's greed.  In glee the negroes dragged him down the road, mocking his frenzied gibberings. How could they recognize Aram Baksh in this half-naked, bloodstained figure, with the grotesquely shorn beard and unintelligible babblings? The sounds of the struggle came back to Conan, standing beside the gate, even after the clump of figures had vanished among the palms.  Closing the door behind him, Conan returned to his horse, mounted and turned westward, toward the open desert, swinging wide to skirt the sinister belt of palm groves. As he rode, he drew from his belt a ring in which gleamed a jewel that snared the starlight in a shimmering iridescence. He held it up to admire it, turning it this way and that. The compact bag of gold pieces clinked gently at his saddle-bow, like a promise of the greater riches to come.  'I wonder what she'd say if she knew I recognized her as Nafertari and him as Jungir Khan the instant I saw them,' he mused. 'I knew the Star of Khorala, too. There'll be a fine scene if she ever guesses that I slipped it off his finger while I was tying him with his sword-belt. But they'll never catch me, with the start I'm getting.'  He glanced back at the shadowy palm groves, among which a red glare was mounting. A chanting rose to the night, vibrating with savage exultation. And another sound mingled with it, a mad, incoherent screaming, a frenzied gibbering in which no words could be distinguished. The noise followed Conan as he rode westward beneath the paling stars."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42198"],["title","I funghi mangerecci e velenosi dell'Europa media (#0)"],["body","FUNGHI                    MANGERECCI E VELENOSI                      DELL'EUROPA MEDIA         CON SPECIALE RIGUARDO A QUELLI CHE CRESCONO NEL                          TRENTINO                             DEL                    SAC.

LIT. TIP. GIOVANNI ZIPPEL ED.                          1906     La prima edizione di quest'opera, uscita nel 1899, fu per ragioni di opportunità limitata ad un numero inferiore di copie delle stabilite in antecedenza, e per le quali erano già approntate le tavole illustrative.  Ora che è esaurita, si giudicò conveniente di usufruire anche le tavole rimaste per una seconda edizione che qui presentiamo riveduta nel testo ed aumentata di otto tavole nuove illustranti specie pure interessanti per il nostro scopo. Anche parecchie delle tavole già esistenti, che erano un po' mancanti nelle tinte, furono ritoccate e ridotte al colore naturale. Non potendosi cangiare la numerazione primitiva, onde non venissero troppo dislocate, le tavole nuove furono segnate col numero della prossima affine, aggiungendovi una lettera dell'alfabeto per specificarle.  I nomi volgari dei funghi non si curarono di più di quanto fu fatto nella prima edizione pel motivo che fra questi ve ne sono pochissimi di veramente differenziali della specie, e questi furono già presi in considerazione. Gli altri sono comuni a moltissime specie; così i funghi che crescono in file si dicono funghi della saetta, quelli sparsi ciodi, ciodini, ombrellini, cappellini, ecc., quelli degli alberi si denominano dall'albero, quantunque appartengano a specie, generi o famiglie diverse. Un tale agglomeramento di specie sotto la medesima denominazione non serve che ad accrescere la confusione, mentre se si trascurano questi nomi, il raccoglitore dovrà attenersi alla descrizione ed alle figure, e con ciò riuscirà a conoscere i veri caratteri distintivi della specie, e quindi a separare meglio i fungi mangerecci dai venefici. Inoltre queste denominazioni multiple, per lo meno inutili, saranno dimenticate e sostituite con quelle segnate nel testo come nota specifica.    _Trento, nel Maggio 1906._                                                       G.

(FUNGHI).  Piante parassite o saprofite, cellulari, da una a più cellule, prive di clorofilla, composte di una parte vegetativa (plasmodio o micelio) e d'una parte fruttifera (ricettacolo); organi della fecondazione (sessuali) noti soltanto in qualche gruppo.[1]     [1] Per l'intelligenza dei termini _tecnici_ veggasi =Parte    generale=, pag. 23-26.  COORTE I. — EUMICETEE  Funghi con micelio, cioè generati dalle spore, le quali producono dei filamenti a cellule allungate (micelio), dal cui accrescimento ed intreccio si forma il ricettacolo.  Classe I. — Basidiomicetee De Bary.  Funghi con imenio costituito da cellule cilindriche, clavate, obovate o globose, dette emibasidii o basidii, colla produzione delle spore sempre esterna: basidii continui o settati traversalmente o verticalmente, portanti all'apice o ai setti un numero vario (all'apice generalmente 4, ai setti uno per setto) di tubetti aghiformi, detti sterimmi, più o meno lunghi, talora anche puntiformi, alla sommità dei quali si formano le spore.   Ordine I. — Imenomicetee Fr.  Funghi carnosi, membranacei, coriacei, sugherosi, legnosi o gelatinosi, per lo più grandi e terrestri, coll'imenio esterno, di forma varia, lamellosa, tubulosa, aculeata o a superficie liscia, costituito da basidii generanti all'apice o ai lati mediante i sterimmi da 2-8, generalmente 4 spore; spore di varia forma e colore, continue o rarissimamente settate.  Famiglia I. — =Agaricacee= Fr.  Funghi carnosi, carnoso tenaci, membranacei o coriacei, forniti di cappello e gambo o raramente privi di quest'ultimo, con imenio infero, formato da lamelle distese a forma di raggio dal gambo verso il margine del cappello; lamelle costituite da un tessuto a cellule allungate (ife), ai cui lati sviluppano i basidii, per lo più a 4 sterimmi, in direzione perpendicolare allo stesso.  SERIE I. — =Leucospore.= — Spore bianche o pallide, di varia forma, ellittiche, ovate, cilindriche, più raramente globose o angolate, liscie o ad episporio granuloso, tubercolato o aculeato.
