It was either that shell or the fragment of another (I could never quite make sure which) that cut off and carried away one half of a pair of prism glasses hanging there, leaving the other just as good as ever. We still have the remnant in our mess as a memento.\"  Flash and roar and that spectral upheaving of foam-fountains in the converging rays of the searchlights crowded most other things out of the next hour or two, and it was only when the night-firing was over and we were headed back for our anchorage in the cold light of the early dawn that I discovered that it was a young signalman who had been standing watch beside me during the exercises. Keen and alert he looked in spite of the sleepless night behind him, and it was easy to believe him when he told me that his had been the honour of being the first man in the _Sydney_ to sight the \"strange ship\" which subsequently turned out to be the long-sought-for _Emden_.  \"It was just the luck of my chancing to be on watch with a good pair of glasses,\" he said modestly; \"but that was by no means the limit of my luck in connexion with the _Emden_ show. When we went to 'Action Stations,' I was ordered to come up here and do nothing but keep an eye on the collier that had been standing-by the _Emden_ at first, but which got away under full steam just as soon as it was plain we were going to give her 'whats for.' I carried out orders all right as far as keeping an eye on the collier was concerned, but my other eye, and my mind, were on the _Emden_ ring of the circus. I don't really suppose there was another man on the _Sydney_ who had as little to do, and therefore as much time to see what was going on, as I did. But that wasn't the end of my luck, for I was one of the party that went ashore the next morning to round up the Huns that had landed on Direction Island, and then, after that, I was in the first boat that went to bring off prisoners from the _Emden_. So you see I had a fairly good-all-round kind of a 'look see.' My training as a signalman made it natural for me to jot down things as I saw them, and I think that I still have a page of memorandum where I made notes during the fight of what time some of the things happened. If you'd like to see it, sir----\"  Then I knew that I at last had the sort of story I had been looking for in prospect, and before going below for my cup of ship's cocoa as a preliminary to turning in I had arranged for a yarn in the first Dog Watch that evening. It was indeed good luck to hear the account of the historic action from one who, besides having had such exceptional opportunities for seeing the various phases of it, also appeared to be well educated and a trained observer.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I'm sorry I couldn't find one of the _Emden's_ cat-o'-nine-tails,\" were my visitor's first words when he appeared at the door of the Captain's sea-cabin where I awaited him after tea; \"but the fact is that the most of us have taken the best of our little remembrances of that show ashore for safe-keeping, and those 'dusters' were the things we prized more than anything else as showing the Hun up for the bully he really is.  \"What did they use them for? Well, if you'd believe their story, it was to dust their togs after coaling ship. We brought back about twenty of them, with the rest of the salvage, and at first we were rather inclined to take it for straight when they said they used them for dusters. Then one of our prisoners got hold of more than his share of our beer one night, and became drunk and truthful at the same time. He confessed that they had been used on the men time and time again, just in ordinary routine, to keep them up to the mark on discipline. He also said that they had been used freely during the fight with the _Sydney_, and that when the lashes failed to give sufficient 'encouragement,' something more drastic was used. But I'll tell you about that in its place. But you see what real prizes those 'cats' were, sir, in the way of holding the Hun up to the light so you could see through him, so to speak. _My_ 'cat' was a brand new one, but the most of the lot were black and stiff with blood.  \"We'd been rather playing at war up to the time we fought the _Emden_,\" he went on, \"having spent most of the opening months purifying the Marshalls, Carolines, New Britain, and New Guinea by cleaning the Huns out of them. There had been a few skirmishes ashore, but nothing at all at sea, nor did the prospects of anything of the kind seem any better in early November than they had been right along up to then. We missed our big fight when, with the _Australia_, _Melbourne_, and the French cruiser, _Montcalm_, we came within twenty-four hours of connecting with Von Spee's squadron when they swept through the South Pacific on their way to South American waters. With that gone, there didn't seem much to look forward to until we were sent to the North Sea, and we were rather hoping, when we set out from Australia with a convoy in the first week of November, that we might keep going right on to Europe.  \"We knew, of course, that the _Emden_ was still in business, but we also knew that any one ship had about as much chance of finding her in the Indian Ocean as you have of finding the finger-ring you lose in the coal bunkers. Certainly we didn't expect that going out in force with a convoy would be the means of bringing her to the end of her tether.  \"The first and only word we had that a raider was in our vicinity was in the form of a broken message from the Cocos station, which never got further than 'Strange cruiser is at entrance of harbour----.' At that point the 'strange cruiser' managed to work an effective 'jam,' and it was not long before the Cocos call ceased entirely. Although we did not learn it till a couple of days later, this was caused by the destruction of the station by a landing party from the _Emden_ under Lieut. Mucke.  \"The escorting warships were the _Sydney_, her sister, the _Melbourne_, and a Japanese cruiser, larger and with bigger guns, but slower than we. The Jap, without waiting for orders from the Captain of the _Melbourne_, who was the senior officer of the convoy, dashed off at once, and was only recalled with difficulty. A message which the Japanese captain sent to account for his break was most amusing, 'We do not trust the skipper ship _Emden_,' it read, 'he is one tricky fellow, and must be watched.'  \"As the job was one for a fast light cruiser, the choice was between the _Sydney_ and _Melbourne_, and it was because the skipper of the _Melbourne_, who was the senior officer, did not feel that he had authority to leave the convoy that the _Sydney_ had the call. We worked up to top speed quickly, and were soon tearing through the water headed for Cocos Island at over twenty-six knots an hour.  \"I don't remember that there was any especial excitement in the _Sydney_ that morning. We had dashed off on too many wild-goose chases already to feel that there was very much of a chance of finding our bird this time. In fact, I don't remember being as nervous at any stage of this _Emden_ show as in a night attack we made upon Rabaul, in New Britain, where never a shot was fired. There had been some 'Telefunken' messages in the air during the night (undecipherable, of course), but that was only to be expected. Every one seemed even more inclined to crack jokes than usual, and that is saying a good deal. I remember especially that some of the officers were making very merry over the fact that Lieut. G---- prepared for action by going to the barber and having his hair cut, something that he didn't do very often.  \"It was about seven in the morning when the broken message was picked up, and at eight I was sent aloft to relieve the lookout. It was nine-fifteen when the ragged fringe of the cocoa-nut palms of Direction Island--the main one of the Cocos-Keeling group--began to poke up over the horizon, and perhaps ten minutes later that my glasses made out the dim but unmistakable outline of three funnel tops.  \"Although we hadn't studied silhouettes at that stage of the game to anything like as much as we've had a chance to since, that trio of smoke-stacks marked her for a Hun, and probably the _Emden_ or _KÃ¶nigsberg_. Just which it was we never knew for certain till after we'd put her out of action and picked up the crew of the collier that accompanied her.  \"Just before I went aloft I heard one of the officers make an offer of a pound to the Boy that was first to sight the enemy. I didn't come under that rating myself, but it occurred to me instantly that it would never do to let all that money go unearned. So I leaned over, broke the news to a pukka Boy who was aloft with me, and told him to sing it out. He got the quid all right, and, for a long time at least, he got all credit and kudos of actually being the first to sight the _Emden_. When I finally told the Captain about the way it really happened, he laughed and said it served me right for trying to dabble in 'high finance.' I never understood quite what he meant, but always fancied 'high' had some reference to me being aloft, and 'finance' referred to the quid.  \"The first sign of life I saw on the _Emden_ was when she started blowing her syren. This, although we did not know it at the time, was an attempt to call back the party she had sent ashore to destroy the wireless station. Luckily for that lot there was no time for them to come off. The _Emden_ did not, as I have read in several accounts of the action, attempt to close immediately, but rather headed off in what appeared to be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42624"],["title","L'AnticlÃ©ricalisme (#0)"],["body","sur la transcription:        Les mots et phrases imprimÃ©s en gras dans le texte d'origine       sont marquÃ©s =ainsi=.

Je pense apporter de l'impartialitÃ© dans cette Ã©tude, n'appartenant Ã  aucune confession religieuse, ni, ce qui est peut-Ãªtre plus important encore dans l'espÃ¨ce, Ã  aucun parti politique. Mon intention trÃ¨s arrÃªtÃ©e est d'Ã©tudier cette affection comme si j'Ã©crivais sur un sujet de l'antiquitÃ©, comme si clÃ©ricalisme, anticlÃ©ricalisme, catholicisme et France mÃªme avaient disparu depuis dix siÃ¨cles; et comme si tous ces objets faisaient partie du domaine de la philologie ou de l'archÃ©ologie. Je m'en crois capable, encore qu'en pareille matiÃ¨re on ne saurait rÃ©pondre de rien; mais mon dessein, trÃ¨s ferme, est trÃ¨s exactement ce que je viens de dire. On me saura grÃ© d'avoir au moins pris la plume dans cet Ã©tat d'esprit.         *       *       *       *       *  Nietzsche a dit, dans la mÃªme phrase je crois, que le FranÃ§ais est essentiellement religieux et qu'il est essentiellement irrÃ©ligieux. Il n'a pas tort, Ã  la condition seulement qu'on mesure l'Ã©tendue des manifestations religieuses des FranÃ§ais et l'Ã©tendue aussi des manifestations contraires. Le FranÃ§ais, ce me semble, a des dispositions naturelles essentiellement irrÃ©ligieuses; seulement, et prÃ©cisÃ©ment Ã  cause de cela, par rÃ©action des esprits nÃ©s religieux contre leurs entours, il y a eu des groupements pÃ©nÃ©trÃ©s de l'esprit religieux le plus intense; il y a eu des Ã®lots religieux singuliÃ¨rement nets et pour ainsi dire aigus, comme il y a des Ã®lots granitiques au milieu des pays calcaires, qui tranchent vigoureusement avec tout ce qui les entoure et se font remarquer d'autant.  Cela, ce me semble, Ã  toutes les Ã©poques: vaudois, cathares, huguenots, jansÃ©nistes. La race franÃ§aise, Ã©tant ardente, devait produire quelques foyers d'ardent sentiment religieux, Ã§Ã  et lÃ , sous l'influence d'un esprit dominateur ou d'une Ã¢me apostolique; sous l'influence, aussi, des entours mÃªmes, poussant et provoquant au sentiment religieux les Ã¢mes douÃ©es de l'esprit de contradiction.  Mais le fond de la race franÃ§aise, la gÃ©nÃ©ralitÃ© des FranÃ§ais me semble toujours avoir Ã©tÃ© peu capable d'embrasser et d'entretenir l'esprit religieux et le sentiment religieux. Il ne faut pas que nos guerres religieuses, assez nombreuses et assez longues, nous fassent illusion sur ceci. La religion, dans ces guerres, a Ã©tÃ© pour un cinquiÃ¨me cause et pour quatre cinquiÃ¨mes prÃ©texte, Ã  calculer approximativement, comme on est bien forcÃ© de faire en pareille matiÃ¨re.--Est-il quelqu'un qui estime aujourd'hui que la croisade des Albigeois ait Ã©tÃ© une manifestation de foi religieuse? Est-il quelqu'un qui conteste qu'elle ait Ã©tÃ© une _ruÃ©e_ de pillards avides sur des contrÃ©es riches, prenant prÃ©texte dans le mot d'ordre d'un pape, qui lui-mÃªme obÃ©issait Ã  des idÃ©es politiques en le donnant?  De mÃªme les guerres du XVIe siÃ¨cle entre protestants et catholiques franÃ§ais ont Ã©tÃ© surtout des guerres de fÃ©odaux contre la royautÃ©; et les guerres du XVIIe siÃ¨cle entre catholiques et protestants franÃ§ais ont Ã©tÃ© surtout des guerres de rÃ©publicains plus ou moins conscients et prenant plus ou moins leur mot d'ordre Ã  GenÃ¨ve et en Hollande, contre la royautÃ© franÃ§aise devenant absolutiste.  Et je dis mÃªme que chez les plus simples et qui ne se savaient, ni se sentaient ni fÃ©odaux Ã  telle Ã©poque, ni rÃ©publicains Ã  telle autre, la religion entrait moins en jeu que le simple goÃ»t de lutte pour la lutte et de guerre pour la guerre. Le FranÃ§ais est essentiellement homme de guerre civile. Il est batailleur de village Ã  village, de province Ã  province, de quartier Ã  quartier. Ce peuple, qui a Ã©tÃ© amenÃ© Ã  l'unitÃ© nationale par la persÃ©vÃ©rance Ã©tonnante d'une maison royale Ã©nergique et tenace et qui, livrÃ© Ã  lui-mÃªme, semble retourner peu Ã  peu au particularisme, ne me paraÃ®t jamais avoir montrÃ© par lui-mÃªme un dÃ©sir d'unitÃ© et une volontÃ© de concentration.  Bien plus fort a toujours Ã©tÃ© en lui l'instinct de guerre intÃ©rieure et intestine, le dÃ©sir, soit de province Ã  province, soit de parti Ã  parti, d'Ã©craser l'adversaire, sans se demander trÃ¨s prÃ©cisÃ©ment pourquoi il est l'adversaire et tout simplement parce qu'il faut bien se haÃ¯r et parce qu'il faut bien se battre.  L'enfant, en France, est Ã©levÃ© par ses parents dans la haine d'une certaine catÃ©gorie de FranÃ§ais; et la premiÃ¨re chose, presque, qu'on lui dÃ©signe, c'est un ennemi, trÃ¨s proche, quelqu'un, Ã  cÃ´tÃ© de lui, qu'il faut s'habituer Ã  dÃ©tester et Ã  injurier sans motif trÃ¨s prÃ©cis; mais pour montrer qu'on est le fils de son pÃ¨re.  Je crois que cela est Â«dans le sangÂ». Ce que sont les partis politiques au XXe siÃ¨cle, les partis religieux l'Ã©taient au XVIe et au XVIIe siÃ¨cle. Les guerres de religion n'ont guÃ¨re Ã©tÃ© chez nous une manifestation de foi, d'un cÃ´tÃ© ou de l'autre; elles ont Ã©tÃ©, avant tout, une forme du besoin gratuit de guerre civile.  Faut-il creuser? On le pourrait, je crois. Faut-il se demander d'oÃ¹ vient lui-mÃªme ce besoin chez le FranÃ§ais de se battre contre le voisin, s'il a un couvre-chef d'une autre couleur que la nÃ´tre; et mÃªme ce besoin de n'adopter une autre couleur que la sienne que pour pouvoir se battre contre lui? On le pourrait, je crois. Le FranÃ§ais est actif de corps et paresseux d'esprit. Il est nerveux et il est de cerveau nonchalant. Il sent le besoin d'agir et il n'aime pas Ã  se donner beaucoup de peine pour trouver un motif d'agir, c'est-Ã -dire une idÃ©e. Il s'ensuit que sur un simple prÃ©texte, sur une ombre d'idÃ©e adoptÃ©e en courant, il se jette en campagne et il frappe. Les premiers coups Ã©changÃ©s sont ensuite un motif suffisant de continuer, par rancune, indÃ©finiment. Le FranÃ§ais peut donc livrer et soutenir une longue guerre sans avoir jamais eu un motif vrai de l'entreprendre, et Ãªtre soutenu lui-mÃªme pendant cette longue lutte acharnÃ©e par une idÃ©e qu'en vÃ©ritÃ© il n'a jamais eue, et qui, Ã  le bien prendre, n'existait pas.  C'est ce qui a bien trompÃ© les philosophes, trÃ¨s lÃ©gers eux-mÃªmes, du XVIIIe siÃ¨cle. Ayant constatÃ© qu'on sortait Ã  peine des guerres religieuses, et de guerres religieuses Ã©pouvantables, ils se sont imaginÃ© que c'Ã©tait la religion qui Ã©tait la cause de ces guerres et de ces Ã©pouvantements, et ils ont maudit et dÃ©noncÃ© les religions de tout leur cÅur. Mais, aprÃ¨s eux, on s'est battu pour d'autres idÃ©es, que du reste on ne comprenait pas davantage et qui n'Ã©taient Ã©galement que des prÃ©textes; et il a Ã©tÃ© suffisamment prouvÃ© qu'autre chose que l'esprit religieux pouvait mettre aux hommes les armes Ã  la main.  OÃ¹ ils s'Ã©taient trompÃ©s, c'Ã©tait Ã  croire que la religion fut la vÃ©ritable cause de la guerre et que, la religion rÃ©duite Ã  l'impuissance, il n'y aurait plus de guerre civile. La vÃ©ritable cause des guerres civiles, c'Ã©tait l'amour de la guerre civile elle-mÃªme et l'instinct mÃªme, impÃ©rieux et impatient, de guerre civile.  Des guerres de religion franÃ§aises ne concluons donc nullement que le FranÃ§ais soit trÃ¨s religieux ni qu'il l'ait jamais Ã©tÃ©. Il a, simplement, aimÃ© l'Ã©change des coups"]]]
