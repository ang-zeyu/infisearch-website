How pure the water was when it came into the Stockade was a question. We always believed that it received the drainage from the camps of the guards, a half-a-mile away.  A road was made across the swamp, along the Dead Line at the west side, where the creek entered the pen.  Those getting water would go to this spot, and reach as far up the stream as possible, to get the water that was least filthy.  As they could reach nearly to the Dead Line this furnished an excuse to such of the guards as were murderously inclined to fire upon them.  I think I hazard nothing in saying that for weeks at least one man a day was killed at this place.  The murders became monotonous; there was a dreadful sameness to them.  A gun would crack; looking up we would see, still smoking, the muzzle of the musket of one of the guards on either side of the creek.  At the same instant would rise a piercing shriek from the man struck, now floundering in the creek in his death agony.  Then thousands of throats would yell out curses and denunciations, and--  \"O, give the Rebel ---- ---- ---- ---- a furlough!\"  It was our belief that every guard who killed a Yankee was rewarded with a thirty-day furlough.  Mr. Frederick Holliger, now of Toledo, formerly a member of the Seventy-Second Ohio, and captured at Guntown, tells me, as his introduction to Andersonville life, that a few hours after his entry he went to the brook to get a drink, reached out too far, and was fired upon by the guard, who missed him, but killed another man and wounded a second.  The other prisoners standing near then attacked him, and beat him nearly to death, for having drawn the fire of the guard.  Nothing could be more inexcusable than these murders.  Whatever defense there might be for firing on men who touched the Dead Line in other parts of the prison, there could be none here.  The men had no intention of escaping; they had no designs upon the Stockade; they were not leading any party to assail it.  They were in every instance killed in the act of reaching out with their cups to dip up a little water.     CHAPTER XXIX.  SOME DISTINCTION BETWEEN SOLDIERLY DUTY AND MURDER--A PLOT TO ESCAPE --IT IS REVEALED AND FRUSTRATED.  Let the reader understand that in any strictures I make I do not complain of the necessary hardships of war.  I understood fully and accepted the conditions of a soldier's career.  My going into the field uniformed and armed implied an intention, at least, of killing, wounding, or capturing, some of the enemy.  There was consequently no ground of complaint if I was, myself killed, wounded, or captured.  If I did not want to take these chances I ought to stay at home.  In the same way, I recognized the right of our captors or guards to take proper precautions to prevent our escape.  I never questioned for an instant the right of a guard to fire upon those attempting to escape, and to kill them.  Had I been posted over prisoners I should have had no compunction about shooting at those trying to get away, and consequently I could not blame the Rebels for doing the same thing.  It was a matter of soldierly duty.  But not one of the men assassinated by the guards at Andersonville were trying to escape, nor could they have got away if not arrested by a bullet.  In a majority of instances there was not even a transgression of a prison rule, and when there was such a transgression it was a mere harmless inadvertence.  The slaying of every man there was a foul crime.  The most of this was done by very young boys; some of it by old men. The Twenty-Sixth Alabama and Fifty-Fifth Georgia, had guarded us since the opening of the prison, but now they were ordered to the field, and their places filled by the Georgia \"Reserves,\" an organization of boys under, and men over the military age.  As General Grant aptly-phrased it, \"They had robbed the cradle and the grave,\" in forming these regiments. The boys, who had grown up from children since the war began, could not comprehend that a Yankee was a human being, or that it was any more wrongful to shoot one than to kill a mad dog.  Their young imaginations had been inflamed with stories of the total depravity of the Unionists until they believed it was a meritorious thing to seize every opportunity to exterminate them.  Early one morning I overheard a conversation between two of these youthful guards:  \"Say, Bill, I heerd that you shot a Yank last night?\"  \"Now, you just bet I did.  God! you jest ought to've heerd him holler.\"  Evidently the juvenile murderer had no more conception that he had committed crime than if he had killed a rattlesnake.  Among those who came in about the last of the month were two thousand men from Butler's command, lost in the disastrous action of May 15, by which Butler was \"bottled up\" at Bermuda Hundreds.  At that time the Rebel hatred for Butler verged on insanity, and they vented this upon these men who were so luckless--in every sense--as to be in his command.  Every pains was taken to mistreat them.  Stripped of every article of clothing, equipment, and cooking utensils--everything, except a shirt and a pair of pantaloons, they were turned bareheaded and barefooted into the prison, and the worst possible place in the pen hunted out to locate them upon. This was under the bank, at the edge of the Swamp and at the eastern side of the prison, where the sinks were, and all filth from the upper part of the camp flowed down to them.  The sand upon which they lay was dry and burning as that of a tropical desert; they were without the slightest shelter of any kind, the maggot flies swarmed over them, and the stench was frightful.  If one of them survived the germ theory of disease is a hallucination.  The increasing number of prisoners made it necessary for the Rebels to improve their means of guarding and holding us in check.  They threw up a line of rifle pits around the Stockade for the infantry guards. At intervals along this were piles of hand grenades, which could be used with fearful effect in case of an outbreak.  A strong star fort was thrown up at a little distance from the southwest corner.  Eleven field pieces were mounted in this in such a way as to rake the Stockade diagonally.  A smaller fort, mounting five guns, was built at the northwest corner, and at the northeast and southeast corners were small lunettes, with a couple of howitzers each.  Packed as we were we had reason to dread a single round from any of these works, which could not fail to produce fearful havoc.  Still a plot was concocted for a break, and it seemed to the sanguine portions of us that it must prove successful.  First a secret society was organized, bound by the most stringent oaths that could be devised. The members of this were divided into companies of fifty men each; under officers regularly elected.  The secrecy was assumed in order to shut out Rebel spies and the traitors from a knowledge of the contemplated outbreak.  A man named Baker--belonging, I think, to some New York regiment--was the grand organizer of the scheme.  We were careful in each of our companies to admit none to membership except such as long acquaintance gave us entire confidence in.  The plan was to dig large tunnels to the Stockade at various places, and then hollow out the ground at the foot of the timbers, so that a half dozen or so could be pushed over with a little effort, and make a gap ten or twelve feet wide.  All these were to be thrown down at a preconcerted signal, the companies were to rush out and seize the eleven guns of the headquarters fort.  The Plymouth Brigade was then to man these and turn them on the camp of the Reserves who, it was imagined, would drop their arms and take to their heels after receiving a round or so of shell. We would gather what arms we could, and place them in the hands of the most active and determined.  This would give us frown eight to ten thousand fairly armed, resolute men, with which we thought we could march to Appalachicola Bay, or to Sherman.  We worked energetically at our tunnels, which soon began to assume such shape as to give assurance that they would answer our expectations in opening the prison walls.  Then came the usual blight to all such enterprises: a spy or a traitor revealed everything to Wirz.  One day a guard came in, seized Baker and took him out.  What was done with him I know not; we never heard of him after he passed the inner gate.  Immediately afterward all the Sergeants of detachments were summoned outside.  There they met Wirz, who made a speech informing them that he knew all the details of the plot, and had made sufficient preparations to defeat it.  The guard had been strongly reinforced, and disposed in such a manner as to protect the guns from capture.  The Stockade had been secured to prevent its falling, even if undermined.  He said, in addition, that Sherman had been badly defeated by Johnston, and driven back across the river, so that any hopes of co-operation by him would be ill-founded.  When the Sergeants returned, he caused the following notice to be posted on the gates:                                   NOTICE.       Not wishing to shed the blood of hundreds, not connected with those      who concocted a mad plan to force the Stockade, and make in this way      their escape, I hereby warn the leaders and those who formed      themselves into a band to carry out this, that I am in possession of      all the facts, and have made my dispositions accordingly, so as to      frustrate it.  No choice would be left me but to open with grape and      canister on the Stockade, and what effect this would have, in this      densely crowded place, need not be told.       May 25,1864.                                              H. Wirz.  The next day a line of tall poles, bearing white flags, were put up at some little distance from the Dead Line, and a notice was read to us at roll call that if, except at roll call, any gathering"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4258"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons â€” Volume 2 (#6)"],["body","one hundred was observed, closer the Stockade than these poles, the guns would open with grape and canister without warning.  The number of deaths in the Stockade in May was seven hundred and eight, about as many as had been killed in Sherman's army during the same time.     CHAPTER XXX.  JUNE--POSSIBILITIES OF A MURDEROUS CANNONADE--WHAT WAS PROPOSED TO BE DONE IN THAT EVENT--A FALSE ALARM--DETERIORATION OF THE RATIONS --FEARFUL INCREASE OF MORTALITY.  After Wirz's threat of grape and canister upon the slightest provocation, we lived in daily apprehension of some pretext being found for opening the guns upon us for a general massacre.  Bitter experience had long since taught us that the Rebels rarely threatened in vain.  Wirz, especially, was much more likely to kill without warning, than to warn without killing.  This was because of the essential weakness of his nature.  He knew no art of government, no method of discipline save \"kill them!\"  His petty little mind's scope reached no further.  He could conceive of no other way of managing men than the punishment of every offense, or seeming offense, with death.  Men who have any talent for governing find little occasion for the death penalty.  The stronger they are in themselves--the more fitted for controlling others--the less their need of enforcing their authority by harsh measures.  There was a general expression of determination among the prisoners to answer any cannonade with a desperate attempt to force the Stockade. It was agreed that anything was better than dying like rats in a pit or wild animals in a battue.  It was believed that if anything would occur which would rouse half those in the pen to make a headlong effort in concert, the palisade could be scaled, and the gates carried, and, though it would be at a fearful loss of life, the majority of those making the attempt would get out.  If the Rebels would discharge grape and canister, or throw a shell into the prison, it would lash everybody to such a pitch that they would see that the sole forlorn hope of safety lay in wresting the arms away from our tormentors.  The great element in our favor was the shortness of the distance between us and the cannon. We could hope to traverse this before the guns could be reloaded more than once.  Whether it would have been possible to succeed I am unable to say. It would have depended wholly upon the spirit and unanimity with which the effort was made.  Had ten thousand rushed forward at once, each with a determination to do or die, I think it would have been successful without a loss of a tenth of the number.  But the insuperable trouble--in our disorganized state--was want of concert of action.  I am quite sure, however, that the attempt would have been made had the guns opened.  One day, while the agitation of this matter was feverish, I was cooking my dinner--that is, boiling my pitiful little ration of unsalted meal, in my fruit can, with the aid of a handful of splinters that I had been able to pick up by a half day's diligent search.  Suddenly the long rifle in the headquarters fort rang out angrily.  A fuse shell shrieked across the prison--close to the tops of the logs, and burst in the woods beyond. It was answered with a yell of defiance from ten thousand throats.  I sprang up-my heart in my mouth.  The long dreaded time had arrived; the Rebels had opened the massacre in which they must exterminate us, or we them.  I looked across to the opposite bank, on which were standing twelve thousand men--erect, excited, defiant.  I was sure that at the next shot they would surge straight against the Stockade like a mighty human billow, and then a carnage would begin the like of which modern times had never seen.  The excitement and suspense were terrible.  We waited for what seemed ages for the next gun.  It was not fired.  Old Winder was merely showing the prisoners how he could rally the guards to oppose an outbreak. Though the gun had a shell in it, it was merely a signal, and the guards came double-quicking up by regiments, going into position in the rifle pits and the hand-grenade piles.  As we realized what the whole affair meant, we relieved our surcharged feelings with a few general yells of execration upon Rebels generally, and upon those around us particularly, and resumed our occupation of cooking rations, killing lice, and discussing the prospects of exchange and escape.  The rations, like everything else about us, had steadily grown worse. A bakery was built outside of the Stockade in May and our meal was baked there into loaves about the size of brick.  Each of us got a half of one of these for a day's ration.  This, and occasionally a small slice of salt pork, was call that I received.  I wish the reader would prepare himself an object lesson as to how little life can be supported on for any length of time, by procuring a piece of corn bread the size of an ordinary brickbat, and a thin slice of pork, and then imagine how he would fare, with that as his sole daily ration, for long hungry weeks and months.  Dio Lewis satisfied himself that he could sustain life on sixty cents, a week.  I am sure that the food furnished us by the Rebels would not, at present prices cost one-third that.  They pretended to give us one-third of pound of bacon and one and one-fourth pounds of corn meal. A week's rations then would be two and one-third pounds of bacon--worth ten cents, and eight and three-fourths pounds of meal, worth, say, ten cents more.  As a matter of fact, I do not presume that at any time we got this full ration.  It would surprise me to learn that we averaged two-thirds of it.  The meal was ground very coarse and produced great irrition in the bowels.  We used to have the most frightful cramps that men ever suffered from.  Those who were predisposed intestinal affections were speedily carried off by incurable diarrhea and dysentery.  Of the twelve thousand and twelve men who died, four thousand died of chronic diarrhea; eight hundred and seventeen died of acute diarrhea, and one thousand three hundred and eighty-four died of dysenteria, making total of six thousand two hundred and one victims to enteric disorders.  Let the reader reflect a moment upon this number, till comprehends fully how many six thousand two hundred and men are, and how much force, energy, training, and rich possibilities for the good of the community and country died with those six thousand two hundred and one young, active men.  It may help his perception of the magnitude of this number to remember that the total loss of the British, during the Crimean war, by death in all shapes, was four thousand five hundred and ninety-five, or one thousand seven hundred and six less than the deaths in Andersonville from dysenteric diseases alone.  The loathsome maggot flies swarmed about the bakery, and dropped into the trough where the dough was being mixed, so that it was rare to get a ration of bread not contaminated with a few of them.  It was not long until the bakery became inadequate to supply bread for all the prisoners.  Then great iron kettles were set, and mush was issued to a number of detachments, instead of bread.  There was not so much cleanliness and care in preparing this as a farmer shows in cooking food for stock.  A deep wagon-bed would be shoveled full of the smoking paste, which was then hailed inside and issued out to the detachments, the latter receiving it on blankets, pieces of shelter tents, or, lacking even these, upon the bare sand.  As still more prisoners came in, neither bread nor mush could be furnished them, and a part of the detachments received their rations in meal.  Earnest solicitation at length resulted in having occasional scanty issues of wood to cook this with.  My detachment was allowed to choose which it would take--bread, mush or meal.  It took the latter.  Cooking the meal was the topic of daily interest.  There were three ways of doing it: Bread, mush and \"dumplings.\"  In the latter the meal was dampened until it would hold together, and was rolled into little balls, the size of marbles, which were then boiled.  The bread was the most satisfactory and nourishing; the mush the bulkiest--it made a bigger show, but did not stay with one so long.  The dumplings held an intermediate position--the water in which they were boiled becoming a sort of a broth that helped to stay the stomach.  We received no salt, as a rule.  No one knows the intense longing for this, when one goes without it for a while.  When, after a privation of weeks we would get a teaspoonful of salt apiece, it seemed as if every muscle in our bodies was invigorated.  We traded buttons to the guards for red peppers, and made our mush, or bread, or dumplings, hot with the fiery-pods, in hopes that this would make up for the lack of salt, but it was a failure. One pinch of salt was worth all the pepper pods in the Southern Confederacy.  My little squad--now diminished by death from five to three--cooked our rations together to economize wood and waste of meal, and quarreled among ourselves daily as to whether the joint stock should be converted into bread, mush or dumplings.  The decision depended upon the state of the stomach.  If very hungry, we made mush; if less famished, dumplings; if disposed to weigh matters, bread.  This may seem a trifling matter, but it was far from it.  We all remember the man who was very fond of white beans, but after having fifty or sixty meals of them in succession, began to find a suspicion of monotony in the provender.  We had now six months of unvarying diet of corn meal and water, and even so slight a change as a variation in the way of combining the two was an agreeable novelty.  At the end of June there were twenty-six thousand three hundred and sixty-seven prisoners in the Stockade, and one thousand two hundred--just forty per day--had died during the month.
