DIFFICULTY OF EXERCISING--EMBARRASSMENTS OF A MORNING WALK--THE RIALTO OF THE PRISON--CURSING THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY--THE STORY OF THE BATTLE OF SPOTTSYLVANIA COURTHOUSE.  Certainly, in no other great community, that ever existed upon the face of the globe was there so little daily ebb and flow as in this.  Dull as an ordinary Town or City may be; however monotonous, eventless, even stupid the lives of its citizens, there is yet, nevertheless, a flow every day of its life-blood--its population towards its heart, and an ebb of the same, every evening towards its extremities.  These recurring tides mingle all classes together and promote the general healthfulness, as the constant motion hither and yon of the ocean's waters purify and sweeten them.  The lack of these helped vastly to make the living mass inside the Stockade a human Dead Sea--or rather a Dying Sea--a putrefying, stinking lake, resolving itself into phosphorescent corruption, like those rotting southern seas, whose seething filth burns in hideous reds, and ghastly greens and yellows.  Being little call for motion of any kind, and no room to exercise whatever wish there might be in that direction, very many succumbed unresistingly to the apathy which was so strongly favored by despondency and the weakness induced by continual hunger, and lying supinely on the hot sand, day in and day out, speedily brought themselves into such a condition as invited the attacks of disease.  It required both determination and effort to take a little walking exercise.  The ground was so densely crowded with holes and other devices for shelter that it took one at least ten minutes to pick his way through the narrow and tortuous labyrinth which served as paths for communication between different parts of the Camp.  Still further, there was nothing to see anywhere or to form sufficient inducement for any one to make so laborious a journey.  One simply encountered at every new step the same unwelcome sights that he had just left; there was a monotony in the misery as in everything else, and consequently the temptation to sit or lie still in one's own quarters became very great.  I used to make it a point to go to some of the remoter parts of the Stockade once every day, simply for exercise.  One can gain some idea of the crowd, and the difficulty of making one's way through it, when I say that no point in the prison could be more than fifteen hundred feet from where I staid, and, had the way been clear, I could have walked thither and back in at most a half an hour, yet it usually took me from two to three hours to make one of these journeys.  This daily trip, a few visits to the Creek to wash all over, a few games of chess, attendance upon roll call, drawing rations, cooking and eating the same, \"lousing\" my fragments of clothes, and doing some little duties for my sick and helpless comrades, constituted the daily routine for myself, as for most of the active youths in the prison.  The Creek was the great meeting point for all inside the Stockade. All able to walk were certain to be there at least once during the day, and we made it a rendezvous, a place to exchange gossip, discuss the latest news, canvass the prospects of exchange, and, most of all, to curse the Rebels.  Indeed no conversation ever progressed very far without both speaker and listener taking frequent rests to say bitter things as to the Rebels generally, and Wirz, Winder and Davis in particular.  A conversation between two boys--strangers to each other who came to the Creek to wash themselves or their clothes, or for some other purpose, would progress thus:  First Boy--\"I belong to the Second Corps,--Hancock's, [the Army of the Potomac boys always mentioned what Corps they belonged to, where the Western boys stated their Regiment.]  They got me at Spottsylvania, when they were butting their heads against our breast-works, trying to get even with us for gobbling up Johnson in the morning,\"--He stops suddenly and changes tone to say: \"I hope to God, that when our folks get Richmond, they will put old Ben Butler in command of it, with orders to limb, skin and jayhawk it worse than he did New Orleans.\"  Second Boy, (fervently :) \"I wish to God he would, and that he'd catch old Jeff., and that grayheaded devil, Winder, and the old Dutch Captain, strip 'em just as we were, put 'em in this pen, with just the rations they are givin' us, and set a guard of plantation niggers over 'em, with orders to blow their whole infernal heads off, if they dared so much as to look at the dead line.\"  First Boy--(returning to the story of his capture.) \"Old Hancock caught the Johnnies that morning the neatest you ever saw anything in your life. After the two armies had murdered each other for four or five days in the Wilderness, by fighting so close together that much of the time you could almost shake hands with the Graybacks, both hauled off a little, and lay and glowered at each other.  Each side had lost about twenty thousand men in learning that if it attacked the other it would get mashed fine. So each built a line of works and lay behind them, and tried to nag the other into coming out and attacking.  At Spottsylvania our lines and those of the Johnnies weren't twelve hundred yards apart.  The ground was clear and clean between them, and any force that attempted to cross it to attack would be cut to pieces, as sure as anything.  We laid there three or four days watching each other--just like boys at school, who shake fists and dare each other.  At one place the Rebel line ran out towards us like the top of a great letter 'A.' The night of the 11th of May it rained very hard, and then came a fog so thick that you couldn't see the length of a company.  Hancock thought he'd take advantage of this. We were all turned out very quietly about four o'clock in the morning. Not a bit of noise was allowed.  We even had to take off our canteens and tin cups, that they might not rattle against our bayonets.  The ground was so wet that our footsteps couldn't be heard.  It was one of those deathly, still movements, when you think your heart is making as much noise as a bass drum.  \"The Johnnies didn't seem to have the faintest suspicion of what was coming, though they ought, because we would have expected such an attack from them if we hadn't made it ourselves.  Their pickets were out just a little ways from their works, and we were almost on to them before they discovered us.  They fired and ran back.  At this we raised a yell and dashed forward at a charge.  As we poured over the works, the Rebels came double-quicking up to defend them.  We flanked Johnson's Division quicker'n you could say 'Jack Robinson,' and had four thousand of 'em in our grip just as nice as you please.  We sent them to the rear under guard, and started for the next line of Rebel works about a half a mile away.  But we had now waked up the whole of Lee's army, and they all came straight for us, like packs of mad wolves.  Ewell struck us in the center; Longstreet let drive at our left flank, and Hill tackled our right.  We fell back to the works we had taken, Warren and Wright came up to help us, and we had it hot and heavy for the rest of the day and part of the night.  The Johnnies seemed so mad over what we'd done that they were half crazy.  They charged us five times, coming up every time just as if they were going to lift us right out of the works with the bayonet. About midnight, after they'd lost over ten thousand men, they seemed to understand that we had pre-empted that piece of real estate, and didn't propose to allow anybody to jump our claim, so they fell back sullen like to their main works.  When they came on the last charge, our Brigadier walked behind each of our regiments and said:  \"Boys, we'll send 'em back this time for keeps.  Give it to 'em by the acre, and when they begin to waver, we'll all jump over the works and go for them with the bayonet.'  \"We did it just that way.  We poured such a fire on them that the bullets knocked up the ground in front just like you have seen the deep dust in a road in the middle of Summer fly up when the first great big drops of a rain storm strike it.  But they came on, yelling and swearing, officers in front waving swords, and shouting--all that business, you know.  When they got to about one hundred yards from us, they did not seem to be coming so fast, and there was a good deal of confusion among them.  The brigade bugle sounded:  \"Stop firing.\"  \"We all ceased instantly.  The rebels looked up in astonishment.  Our General sang out:  \"Fix bayonets!' but we knew what was coming, and were already executing the order.  You can imagine the crash that ran down the line, as every fellow snatched his bayonet out and slapped it on the muzzle of his gun. Then the General's voice rang out like a bugle:  \"Ready!--FORWARD!  CHARGE!'  \"We cheered till everything seemed to split, and jumped over the works, almost every man at the same minute.  The Johnnies seemed to have been puzzled at the stoppage of our fire.  When we all came sailing over the works, with guns brought right, down where they meant business, they were so astonished for a minute that they stood stock still, not knowing whether to come for us, or run.  We did not allow them long to debate, but went right towards them on the double quick, with the bayonets looking awful savage and hungry.  It was too much for Mr. Johnny Reb's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4259"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons — Volume 3 (#1)"],["body","erves.  They all seemed to about face' at once, and they lit out of there as if they had been sent for in a hurry.  We chased after 'em as fast as we could, and picked up just lots of 'em.  Finally it began to be real funny.  A Johnny's wind would begin to give out he'd fall behind his comrades; he'd hear us yell and think that we were right behind him, ready to sink a bayonet through him'; he'd turn around, throw up his hands, and sing out:  \"I surrender, mister!  I surrender!' and find that we were a hundred feet off, and would have to have a bayonet as long as one of McClellan's general orders to touch him.  \"Well, my company was the left of our regiment, and our regiment was the left of the brigade, and we swung out ahead of all the rest of the boys. In our excitement of chasing the Johnnies, we didn't see that we had passed an angle of their works.  About thirty of us had become separated from the company and were chasing a squad of about seventy-five or one hundred.  We had got up so close to them that we hollered:  \"'Halt there, now, or we'll blow your heads off.'  \"They turned round with, 'halt yourselves; you ---- Yankee ---- ----'  \"We looked around at this, and saw that we were not one hundred feet away from the angle of the works, which were filled with Rebels waiting for our fellows to get to where they could have a good flank fire upon them. There was nothing to do but to throw down our guns and surrender, and we had hardly gone inside of the works, until the Johnnies opened on our brigade and drove it back.  This ended the battle at Spottsylvania Court House.\"  Second Boy (irrelevantly.) \"Some day the underpinning will fly out from under the South, and let it sink right into the middle kittle o' hell.\"  First Boy (savagely.) \"I only wish the whole Southern Confederacy was hanging over hell by a single string, and I had a knife.\"     CHAPTER XLIV.  REBEL MUSIC--SINGULAR LACK OF THE CREATIVE POWER AMONG THE SOUTHERNERS --CONTRAST WITH SIMILAR PEOPLE ELSEWHERE--THEIR FAVORITE MUSIC, AND WHERE IT WAS BORROWED FROM--A FIFER WITH ONE TUNE.  I have before mentioned as among the things that grew upon one with increasing acquaintance with the Rebels on their native heath, was astonishment at their lack of mechanical skill and at their inability to grapple with numbers and the simpler processes of arithmetic.  Another characteristic of the same nature was their wonderful lack of musical ability, or of any kind of tuneful creativeness.  Elsewhere, all over the world, people living under similar conditions to the Southerners are exceedingly musical, and we owe the great majority of the sweetest compositions which delight the ear and subdue the senses to unlettered song-makers of the Swiss mountains, the Tyrolese valleys, the Bavarian Highlands, and the minstrels of Scotland, Ireland and Wales.  The music of English-speaking people is very largely made up of these contributions from the folk-songs of dwellers in the wilder and more mountainous parts of the British Isles.  One rarely goes far out of the way in attributing to this source any air that he may hear that captivates him with its seductive opulence of harmony.  Exquisite melodies, limpid and unstrained as the carol of a bird in Spring-time, and as plaintive as the cooing of a turtle-dove seems as natural products of the Scottish Highlands as the gorse which blazons on their hillsides in August.  Debarred from expressing their aspirations as people of broader culture do--in painting, in sculpture, in poetry and prose, these mountaineers make song the flexible and ready instrument for the communication of every emotion that sweeps across their souls.  Love, hatred, grief, revenge, anger, and especially war seems to tune their minds to harmony, and awake the voice of song in them hearts.  The battles which the Scotch and Irish fought to replace the luckless Stuarts upon the British throne--the bloody rebellions of 1715 and 1745, left a rich legacy of sweet song, the outpouring of loving, passionate loyalty to a wretched cause; songs which are today esteemed and sung wherever the English language is spoken, by people who have long since forgotten what burning feelings gave birth to their favorite melodies.  For a century the bones of both the Pretenders have moldered in alien soil; the names of James Edward, and Charles Edward, which were once trumpet blasts to rouse armed men, mean as little to the multitude of today as those of the Saxon Ethelbert, and Danish Hardicanute, yet the world goes on singing--and will probably as long as the English language is spoken--\"Wha'll be King but Charlie?\"  \"When Jamie Come Hame,\"  \"Over the Water to Charlie,\"  \"Charlie is my Darling,\"  \"The Bonny Blue Bonnets are Over the Border,\"  \"Saddle Your Steeds and Awa,\" and a myriad others whose infinite tenderness and melody no modern composer can equal.  Yet these same Scotch and Irish, the same Jacobite English, transplanted on account of their chronic rebelliousness to the mountains of Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, seem to have lost their tunefulness, as some fine singing birds do when carried from their native shores.  The descendants of those who drew swords for James and Charles at Preston Pans and Culloden dwell to-day in the dales and valleys of the Alleganies, as their fathers did in the dales and valleys of the Grampians, but their voices are mute.  As a rule the Southerners are fond of music.  They are fond of singing and listening to old-fashioned ballads, most of which have never been printed, but handed down from one generation to the other, like the 'Volklieder' of Germany.  They sing these with the wild, fervid impressiveness characteristic of the ballad singing of unlettered people. Very many play tolerably on the violin and banjo, and occasionally one is found whose instrumentation may be called good.  But above this hight they never soar.  The only musician produced by the South of whom the rest of the country has ever heard, is Blind Tom, the negro idiot.  No composer, no song writer of any kind has appeared within the borders of Dixie.  It was a disappointment to me that even the stress of the war, the passion and fierceness with which the Rebels felt and fought, could not stimulate any adherent of the Stars and Bars into the production of a single lyric worthy in the remotest degree of the magnitude of the struggle, and the depth of the popular feeling.  Where two million Scotch, fighting to restore the fallen fortunes of the worse than worthless Stuarts, filled the world with immortal music, eleven million of Southerners, fighting for what they claimed to be individual freedom and national life, did not produce any original verse, or a bar of music that the world could recognize as such.  This is the fact; and an undeniable one.  Its explanation I must leave to abler analysts than I am.  Searching for peculiar causes we find but two that make the South differ from the ancestral home of these people.  These two were Climate and Slavery.  Climatic effects will not account for the phenomenon, because we see that the peasantry of the mountains of Spain and the South of France as ignorant as these people, and dwellers in a still more enervating atmosphere-are very fertile in musical composition, and their songs are to the Romanic languages what the Scotch and Irish ballads are to the English.  Then it must be ascribed to the incubus of Slavery upon the intellect, which has repressed this as it has all other healthy growths in the South.  Slavery seems to benumb all the faculties except the passions. The fact that the mountaineers had but few or no slaves, does not seem to be of importance in the case.  They lived under the deadly shadow of the upas tree, and suffered the consequences of its stunting their development in all directions, as the ague-smitten inhabitant of the Roman Campana finds every sense and every muscle clogged by the filtering in of the insidious miasma.  They did not compose songs and music, because they did not have the intellectual energy for that work.  The negros displayed all the musical creativeness of that section. Their wonderful prolificness in wild, rude songs, with strangely melodious airs that burned themselves into the memory, was one of the salient characteristics of that down-trodden race.  Like the Russian serfs, and the bondmen of all ages and lands, the songs they made and sang all had an undertone of touching plaintiveness, born of ages of dumb suffering.  The themes were exceedingly simple, and the range of subjects limited.  The joys, and sorrows, hopes and despairs of love's gratification or disappointment, of struggles for freedom, contests with malign persons and influences, of rage, hatred, jealousy, revenge, such as form the motifs for the majority of the poetry of free and strong races, were wholly absent from their lyrics.  Religion, hunger and toil were their main inspiration.  They sang of the pleasures of idling in the genial sunshine; the delights of abundance of food; the eternal happiness that awaited them in the heavenly future, where the slave-driver ceased from troubling and the weary were at rest; where Time rolled around in endless cycles of days spent in basking, harp in hand, and silken clad, in golden streets, under the soft effulgence of cloudless skies, glowing with warmth and kindness emanating from the Creator himself.  Had their masters condescended to borrow the music of the slaves, they would have found none whose sentiments were suitable for the ode of a people undergoing the pangs of what was hoped to be the birth of a new nation.  The three songs most popular at the South, and generally regarded as distinctively Southern, were \"The Bonnie Blue Flag,\"  \"Maryland, My Maryland,\" and \"Stonewall Jackson Crossing into Maryland.\"  The first of these was the greatest favorite by long odds.  Women sang, men whistled, and the so-called musicians played it wherever we went.  While in"]]]
