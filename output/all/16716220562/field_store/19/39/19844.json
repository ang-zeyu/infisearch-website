A heavy guard was placed around us, and a number of pieces of artillery mounted where they would command the camp.  We started in to make ourselves comfortable, as at Millen, by building shanties.  The prisoners we left behind followed us, and we soon had our old crowd of five or six thousand, who had been our companions at Savannah and Millers, again with us.  The place looked very favorable for escape.  We knew we were still near the sea coast--really not more than forty miles away--and we felt that if we could once get there we should be safe.  Andrews and I meditated plans of escape, and toiled away at our cabin.  About a week after our arrival we were startled by an order for the one thousand of us who had first arrived to get ready to move out.  In a few minutes we were taken outside the guard line, massed close together, and informed in a few words by a Rebel officer that we were about to be taken back to Savannah for exchange.  The announcement took away our breath.  For an instant the rush of emotion made us speechless, and when utterance returned, the first use we made of it was to join in one simultaneous outburst of acclamation. Those inside the guard line, understanding what our cheer meant, answered us with a loud shout of congratulation--the first real, genuine, hearty cheering that had been done since receiving the announcement of the exchange at Andersonville, three months before.  As soon as the excitement had subsided somewhat, the Rebel proceeded to explain that we would all be required to sign a parole.  This set us to thinking.  After our scornful rejection of the proposition to enlist in the Rebel army, the Rebels had felt around among us considerably as to how we were disposed toward taking what was called the \"Non-Combatant's Oath;\" that is, the swearing not to take up arms against the Southern Confederacy again during the war.  To the most of us this seemed only a little less dishonorable than joining the Rebel army.  We held that our oaths to our own Government placed us at its disposal until it chose to discharge us, and we could not make any engagements with its enemies that might come in contravention of that duty.  In short, it looked very much like desertion, and this we did not feel at liberty to consider.  There were still many among us, who, feeling certain that they could not survive imprisonment much longer, were disposed to look favorably upon the Non-Combatant's Oath, thinking that the circumstances of the case would justify their apparent dereliction from duty.  Whether it would or not I must leave to more skilled casuists than myself to decide.  It was a matter I believed every man must settle with his own conscience.  The opinion that I then held and expressed was, that if a boy, felt that he was hopelessly sick, and that he could not live if he remained in prison, he was justified in taking the Oath.  In the absence of our own Surgeons he would have to decide for himself whether he was sick enough to be warranted in resorting to this means of saving his life.  If he was in as good health as the majority of us were, with a reasonable prospect of surviving some weeks longer, there was no excuse for taking the Oath, for in that few weeks we might be exchanged, be recaptured, or make our escape.  I think this was the general opinion of the prisoners.  While the Rebel was talking about our signing the parole, there flashed upon all of us at the same moment, a suspicion that this was a trap to delude us into signing the Non-Combatant's Oath.  Instantly there went up a general shout:  \"Read the parole to us.\"  The Rebel was handed a blank parole by a companion, and he read over the printed condition at the top, which was that those signing agreed not to bear arms against the Confederates in the field, or in garrison, not to man any works, assist in any expedition, do any sort of guard duty, serve in any military constabulary, or perform any kind of military service until properly exchanged.  For a minute this was satisfactory; then their ingrained distrust of any thing a Rebel said or did returned, and they shouted:  \"No, no; let some of us read it; let Ilinoy' read it--\"  The Rebel looked around in a puzzled manner.  \"Who the h--l is 'Illinoy!'  Where is he?\" said he.  I saluted and said:  \"That's a nickname they give me.\"  \"Very well,\" said he, \"get up on this stump and read this parole to these d---d fools that won't believe me.\"  I mounted the stump, took the blank from his hand and read it over slowly, giving as much emphasis as possible to the all-important clause at the end--\"until properly exchanged.\"  I then said:  \"Boys, this seems all right to me,\" and they answered, with almost one voice:  \"Yes, that's all right.  We'll sign that.\"  I was never so proud of the American soldier-boy as at that moment.  They all felt that signing that paper was to give them freedom and life.  They knew too well from sad experience what the alternative was.  Many felt that unless released another week would see them in their graves.  All knew that every day's stay in Rebel hands greatly lessened their chances of life.  Yet in all that thousand there was not one voice in favor of yielding a tittle of honor to save life.  They would secure their freedom honorably, or die faithfully.  Remember that this was a miscellaneous crowd of boys, gathered from all sections of the country, and from many of whom no exalted conceptions of duty and honor were expected.  I wish some one would point out to me, on the brightest pages of knightly record, some deed of fealty and truth that equals the simple fidelity of these unknown heros.  I do not think that one of them felt that he was doing anything especially meritorious.  He only obeyed the natural promptings of his loyal heart.  The business of signing the paroles was then begun in earnest.  We were separated into squads according to the first letters of our names, all those whose name began with A being placed in one squad, those beginning with B, in another, and so on.  Blank paroles for each letter were spread out on boxes and planks at different places, and the signing went on under the superintendence of a Rebel Sergeant and one of the prisoners. The squad of M's selected me to superintend the signing for us, and I stood by to direct the boys, and sign for the very few who could not write.  After this was done we fell into ranks again, called the roll of the signers, and carefully compared the number of men with the number of signatures so that nobody should pass unparoled.  The oath was then administered to us, and two day's rations of corn meal and fresh beef were issued.  This formality removed the last lingering doubt that we had of the exchange being a reality, and we gave way to the happiest emotions. We cheered ourselves hoarse, and the fellows still inside followed our example, as they expected that they would share our good fortune in a day or two.  Our next performance was to set to work, cook our two days' rations at once and eat them.  This was not very difficult, as the whole supply for two days would hardly make one square meal.  That done, many of the boys went to the guard line and threw their blankets, clothing, cooking utensils, etc., to their comrades who were still inside.  No one thought they would have any further use for such things.  \"To-morrow, at this time, thank Heaven,\" said a boy near me, as he tossed his blanket and overcoat back to some one inside, \"we'll be in God's country, and then I wouldn't touch them d---d lousy old rags with a ten-foot pole.\"  One of the boys in the M squad was a Maine infantryman, who had been with me in the Pemberton building, in Richmond, and had fashioned himself a little square pan out of a tin plate of a tobacco press, such as I have described in an earlier chapter.  He had carried it with him ever since, and it was his sole vessel for all purposes--for cooking, carrying water, drawing rations, etc.  He had cherished it as if it were a farm or a good situation.  But now, as he turned away from signing his name to the parole, he looked at his faithful servant for a minute in undisguised contempt; on the eve of restoration to happier, better things, it was a reminder of all the petty, inglorious contemptible trials and sorrows he had endured; he actually loathed it for its remembrances, and flinging it upon the ground he crushed it out of all shape and usefulness with his feet, trampling upon it as he would everything connected with his prison life.  Months afterward I had to lend this man my little can to cook his rations in.  Andrews and I flung the bright new tin pans we had stolen at Millen inside the line, to be scrambled for.  It was hard to tell who were the most surprised at their appearance--the Rebels or our own boys--for few had any idea that there were such things in the whole Confederacy, and certainly none looked for them in the possession of two such poverty-stricken specimens as we were.  We thought it best to retain possession of our little can, spoon, chess-board, blanket, and overcoat.  As we marched down and boarded the train, the Rebels confirmed their previous action by taking all the guards from around us.  Only some eight or ten were sent to the train, and these quartered themselves in the caboose, and paid us no further attention.  The train rolled away amid cheering by ourselves and those we left behind.  One thousand happier boys than we never started on a journey. We were going home.  That was enough to wreathe the skies with glory, and fill the world with sweetness and light.  The wintry sun had something of geniality and warmth, the landscape lost some of its repulsiveness, the dreary palmettos had less of that hideousness which made us regard them as very fitting emblems of treason.  We even began to feel a little good-humored contempt for our hateful little Brats of guards, and to reflect how much vicious education and surroundings were to be "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4260"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons — Volume 4 (#6)"],["body","responsible for their misdeeds.  We laughed and sang as we rolled along toward Savannah--going back much faster than the came.  We re-told old stories, and repeated old jokes, that had become wearisome months and months ago, but were now freshened up and given their olden pith by the joyousness of the occasion.  We revived and talked over old schemes gotten up in the earlier days of prison life, of what \"we would do when we got out,\" but almost forgotten since, in the general uncertainty of ever getting out.  We exchanged addresses, and promised faithfully to write to each other and tell how we found everything at home.  So the afternoon and night passed.  We were too excited to sleep, and passed the hours watching the scenery, recalling the objects we had passed on the way to Blackshear, and guessing how near we were to Savannah.  Though we were running along within fifteen or twenty miles of the coast, with all our guards asleep in the caboose, no one thought of escape. We could step off the cars and walk over to the seashore as easily as a man steps out of his door and walks to a neighboring town, but why should we?  Were we not going directly to our vessels in the harbor of Savannah, and was it not better to do this, than to take the chances of escaping, and encounter the difficulties of reaching our blockaders!  We thought so, and we staid on the cars.  A cold, gray Winter morning was just breaking as we reached Savannah. Our train ran down in the City, and then whistled sharply and ran back a mile or so; it repeated this maneuver two or three times, the evident design being to keep us on the cars until the people were ready to receive us.  Finally our engine ran with all the speed she was capable of, and as the train dashed into the street we found ourselves between two heavy lines of guards with bayonets fixed.  The whole sickening reality was made apparent by one glance at the guard line.  Our parole was a mockery, its only object being to get us to Savannah as easily as possible, and to prevent benefit from our recapture to any of Sherman's Raiders, who might make a dash for the railroad while we were in transit.  There had been no intention of exchanging us.  There was no exchange going on at Savannah.  After all, I do not think we felt the disappointment as keenly as the first time we were brought to Savannah.  Imprisonment had stupefied us; we were duller and more hopeless.  Ordered down out of the cars, we were formed in line in the street.  Said a Rebel officer:  \"Now, any of you fellahs that ah too sick to go to Chahlston, step fohwahd one pace.\"  We looked at each other an instant, and then the whole line stepped forward.  We all felt too sick to go to Charleston, or to do anything else in the world.     CHAPTER LXVI.  SPECIMEN CONVERSATION WITH AN AVERAGE NATIVE GEORGIAN--WE LEARN THAT SHERMAN IS HEADING FOR SAVANNAH--THE RESERVES GET A LITTLE SETTLING DOWN.  As the train left the northern suburbs of Savannah we came upon a scene of busy activity, strongly contrasting with the somnolent lethargy that seemed to be the normal condition of the City and its inhabitants.  Long lines of earthworks were being constructed, gangs of negros were felling trees, building forts and batteries, making abatis, and toiling with numbers of huge guns which were being moved out and placed in position.  As we had had no new prisoners nor any papers for some weeks--the papers being doubtless designedly kept away from us--we were at a loss to know what this meant.  We could not understand this erection of fortifications on that side, because, knowing as we did how well the flanks of the City were protected by the Savannah and Ogeeche Rivers, we could not see how a force from the coast--whence we supposed an attack must come, could hope to reach the City's rear, especially as we had just come up on the right flank of the City, and saw no sign of our folks in that direction.  Our train stopped for a few minutes at the edge of this line of works, and an old citizen who had been surveying the scene with senile interest, tottered over to our car to take a look at us.  He was a type of the old man of the South of the scanty middle class, the small farmer.  Long white hair and beard, spectacles with great round, staring glasses, a broad-brimmed hat of ante-Revolutionary pattern, clothes that had apparently descended to him from some ancestor who had come over with Oglethorpe, and a two-handed staff with a head of buckhorn, upon which he leaned as old peasants do in plays, formed such an image as recalled to me the picture of the old man in the illustrations in \"The Dairyman's Daughter.\"  He was as garrulous as a magpie, and as opinionated as a Southern white always is.  Halting in front of our car, he steadied himself by planting his staff, clasping it with both lean and skinny hands, and leaning forward upon it, his jaws then addressed themselves to motion thus:  \"Boys, who mout these be that ye got?\"  One of the Guards:--\"O, these is some Yanks that we've bin hivin' down at Camp Sumter.\"  \"Yes?\" (with an upward inflection of the voice, followed by a close scrutiny of us through the goggle-eyed glasses,) \"Wall, they're a powerful ornary lookin' lot, I'll declah.\"  It will be seen that the old, gentleman's perceptive powers were much more highly developed than his politeness.  \"Well, they ain't what ye mout call purty, that's a fack,\" said the guard.  \"So yer Yanks, air ye?\" said the venerable Goober-Grabber, (the nick-name in the South for Georgians), directing his conversation to me.  \"Wall, I'm powerful glad to see ye, an' 'specially whar ye can't do no harm; I've wanted to see some Yankees ever sence the beginnin' of the wah, but hev never had no chance.  Whah did ye cum from?\"  I seemed called upon to answer, and said: \"I came from Illinois; most of the boys in this car are from Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and Iowa.\"  \"'Deed! All Westerners, air ye?  Wall, do ye know I alluz liked the Westerners a heap sight better than them blue-bellied New England Yankees.\"  No discussion with a Rebel ever proceeded very far without his making an assertion like this.  It was a favorite declaration of theirs, but its absurdity was comical, when one remembered that the majority of them could not for their lives tell the names of the New England States, and could no more distinguish a Downeaster from an Illinoisan than they could tell a Saxon from a Bavarian.  One day, while I was holding a conversation similar to the above with an old man on guard, another guard, who had been stationed near a squad made up of Germans, that talked altogether in the language of the Fatherland, broke in with:  \"Out there by post numbah foahteen, where I wuz yesterday, there's a lot of Yanks who jest jabbered away all the hull time, and I hope I may never see the back of my neck ef I could understand ary word they said, Are them the regular blue-belly kind?\"  The old gentleman entered upon the next stage of the invariable routine of discussion with a Rebel:  \"Wall, what air you'uns down heah, a-fightin' we'uns foh?\"  As I had answered this question several hundred times, I had found the most extinguishing reply to be to ask in return:  \"What are you'uns coming up into our country to fight we'uns for?\"  Disdaining to notice this return in kind, the old man passed on to the next stage:  \"What are you'uns takin' ouah niggahs away from us foh?\"  Now, if negros had been as cheap as oreoide watches, it is doubtful whether the speaker had ever had money enough in his possession at one time to buy one, and yet he talked of taking away \"ouah niggahs,\" as if they were as plenty about his place as hills of corn.  As a rule, the more abjectly poor a Southerner was, the more readily he worked himself into a rage over the idea of \"takin' away ouah niggahs.\"  I replied in burlesque of his assumption of ownership:  \"What are you coming up North to burn my rolling mills and rob my comrade here's bank, and plunder my brother's store, and burn down my uncle's factories?\"  No reply, to this counter thrust.  The old man passed to the third inevitable proposition:  \"What air you'uns puttin' ouah niggahs in the field to fight we'uns foh?\"  Then the whole car-load shouted back at him at once:  \"What are you'uns putting blood-hounds on our trails to hunt us down, for?\"  Old Man--(savagely), \"Waal, ye don't think ye kin ever lick us; leastways sich fellers as ye air?\"  Myself--\"Well, we warmed it to you pretty lively until you caught us. There were none of us but what were doing about as good work as any stock you fellows could turn out.  No Rebels in our neighborhood had much to brag on.  We are not a drop in the bucket, either.  There's millions more better men than we are where we came from, and they are all determined to stamp out your miserable Confederacy.  You've got to come to it, sooner or later; you must knock under, sure as white blossoms make little apples.  You'd better make up your mind to it.\"  Old Man--\"No, sah, nevah.  Ye nevah kin conquer us!  We're the bravest people and the best fighters on airth.  Ye nevah kin whip any people that's a fightin' fur their liberty an' their right; an' ye nevah can whip the South, sah, any way.  We'll fight ye until all the men air killed, and then the wimmen'll fight ye, sah.\"  Myself--\"Well, you may think so, or you may not.  From the way our boys are snatching the Confederacy's real estate away, it begins to look as if you'd not have enough to fight anybody on pretty soon.  What's the meaning of all this fortifying?\"  Old Man--\"Why, don't you know?  Our folks are fixin' up a place foh Bill Sherman to butt his brains out gain'.\"  \"Bill Sherman!\" we all shouted in surprise: \"Why he ain't within two hundred miles of this place, is he?\"  Old Man--\"Yes, but he is, tho'.  He thinks he's played a sharp Yankee trick on Hood.  He found out he couldn't lick him in a squar' fight, nohow; he'd tried that on too often; so he"]]]
