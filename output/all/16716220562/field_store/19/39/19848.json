Their people, too, are a good deal like the northern Scots and Orcadians, with a dry sense of humour that usually manifests itself at your first meeting with them, when they tell you that the Falklands have two seasons, the cold and the snowy. The latter, they tell you,--because the snow stops up the chinks and keeps out the wind--is rather the warmer of the two. They are a sturdy, resolute lot, too, and we found that, quite expecting the coming of the German fleet and with no sure knowledge that British naval help would arrive in time, they had made all preparations to fight the enemy to the limit of their very primitive resources.  \"And a jolly good fight they would have put up, too. The old _Canopus_ (the battleship which did not come up in time to help Craddock at Coronel) had been grounded in the inner harbour and turned into a 'land fort.' Her heavy turret guns had been left aboard her, while those of her secondary batteries had been mounted at the most favourable positions on the hills. The 'standing army'--of something like thirty-five, I believe--had been recruited up to several times that figure, and all over the island firearms, ancient and modern, had been taken down and made ready for use. Von Spee's sailors and marines would have had many a ridge-to-ridge skirmish on their hands before they completed the conquest of the Falklands.  \"The coming of Sturdee put an entirely different face on things,\" continued the Captain, smartly side-stepping the flying \"grummet\" which had been flicked across his path from out of a howling pack of flannelled \"snotties\" deep in the throes of hockey on the opposite side of the quarter-deck. \"'When are the Huns coming?' was still the question on every tongue; but it was now put anticipatively rather than apprehensively. They had not long to wait.  \"I shall never forget that morning they appeared. It was scarcely twenty hours from the time we had dropped anchor, and most of the ships of the squadron were rushing those odd and ends of cleaning up, overhauling, revictualling, and the like that always follow arrival in port. The _Cornwall_, with some repairs on one of her engines to be effected, was at six hours' notice, and the _Bristol_, for similar reasons, at somewhat longer. Only the _Kent_ was ready to put to sea at once.  \"I was in my bath when a signal reading 'Raise steam for full speed with all despatch' was handed me, and it did not need another signal, which arrived a few minutes later, to tell me that, by some amazing stroke of 'joss,' the enemy was near at hand. How near I did not dream until the guns of the old _Canopus_ began to boom. Luckily, I was already shaved\" (I liked that little touch), \"but, even so, my finishing dressing and breakfasting within twelve minutes was a very creditable performance of its kind. I can't say much for the toilet I made, but the breakfast was a good hearty one, with porridge, eggs, and marmalade. With an action in the offing, and no knowing when you are going to have time to eat again, it is only common sense to fortify against an indefinite fast.  \"By the time I reached the bridge the topmasts of an armoured and a light cruiser were visible, slipping along above the headland which cut off the harbour from the open sea. The events of the next few hours were to etch the profile of the latter ship indelibly upon my memory, for it was the _Leipzig_, coming up with the _Gneisenau_ to destroy the Port Stanley Wireless Station. From the foretop of the _Canopus_ they were able to see the Huns clearing for action; and the _Glasgow_ and the _Bristol_, both of which were in the inner harbour, also had a clear view across the depressed neck of the peninsula. The other ships of the squadron saw no more than topmasts until they had raised steam and reached the open sea.  \"Just how the Huns came to make the disconcerting discovery that there were modern battle cruisers concealed by the higher seaward end of the peninsula I learned from an officer who had been saved from the sinking _Gneisenau_, who told me the story in his guttural broken English. They had expected to find the _Canopus_ at Port Stanley, he said, and perhaps the _Cornwall_ and _Carnarvon_ and other light cruisers; but anything of the class of the _Invincible_ and _Inflexible_--'Mein Gott, Nein! Wen der Gunnery Ludenant sent word from der foredop down' (he sputtered) 'dot he zwei ships mit dreipodt madsts gesehen had, mein Kapdtin he say, \"Nein, nein, es ist eempossibl. Ich will ein man mit der gut eyes up senden.\" Wen this man say, ya, he see zwei dreipodt madsts, mein Kapdtin, he say, \"Der Teufel, now Ich must go quickt. Ein hour, zwei hour, we run, sehr schnell. Den komen aus der Inglish ships, und preddy soon Ich see dem komen mehr schell von uns.\" Den Ich say: \"Mein Kapdtin, you must der mehr schnell gehen, or you must der fight machen.\" He say, \"Ya, ya,\" und he mehr schnell try zu gehen. Nicht gut. No good. Den we up mit der _Scharnhorst_ gekommen, und der Admiral, he say, \"Nun will we der fight gemachen. Den we machen der fight. Nichts, no good. Kaput! Feenish!\"'\"  The Captain stopped at the windward end of the deck and let the breeze fan a brow that had grown red during his effort at literal rendition. A grin of pleased reminiscence sat on his face. \"My word, but it must have given the Hun a jolly good jolt, that first sight of those 'dreipodt madsts!'\" he explained finally, as he put on his cap and fell into step beside me again.  \"If Von Spee ever had any time for _arrière pensée_ before the sea closed over him,\" he resumed, \"he must have reproached himself bitterly for not pushing on in force and attacking us in the harbour before we had steam up. If his whole squadron had come up as the _Gneisenau_ and _Leipzig_ did, they could undoubtedly have given us a very unpleasant hour or two while we were raising steam. We would have polished them off in the end, of course, but they would have done us a deal more harm than by the tactics they did follow. Again, there is a chance that, if the two armoured cruisers had pressed the attack alone--as they eventually were forced to do--they might have inflicted enough damage to our light cruisers to have made the escape of all three (instead of only one) of theirs a possibility. However, Von Spee's star of good fortune, which had been at its zenith at Coronel, was now sinking to near the horizon, and it was ordained that at the Falklands he should meet an enemy who was both faster and heavier armed than he, under conditions of sea and light which favoured him no whit.  \"The battle of the Falklands was really won in the harbour of Port Stanley. It was all a question of how soon we could get out. If we could reach the enemy in anything like full force there was little doubt of the result. A delay of an hour or two, however, might have easily resulted in their scattering so effectually that the running down of the last of them would have been a matter of months, and months, too, marked with great losses of, and greater delays to, the merchant shipping of two hemispheres. Nothing short of the truly splendid efforts of the engine-room and stokehold personnel of Sturdee's ships would have given their gunners their chance to win the battle of the Falklands.  \"Of the _Cornwall's_ achievement in this respect I am especially proud. With one of the engines partially dismantled, we would have been doing all that was expected of us if we had been under full steam in six hours. Indeed, that was the very notice we had gone under, in order to do the overhauling desired. And now let me tell you what happened. It was ten minutes after eight when the signal to raise steam for full speed was received, and before half-past ten she was steaming out of the harbour. We could have got under weigh some minutes earlier than we did but for having to let the _Invincible_ and the _Inflexible_, which had been lying inshore of us, pass out ahead. And before the day was over the old _Cornwall_, with the heartiest lot of lads that ever swung a scoop throwing coal under her boilers, covered a wide stretch of the South Atlantic at a speed a good knot or two better than she had averaged on her trial trip, or at any other time since then.  \"There was one trivial but amusing little incident in connexion with the departure of the battle cruisers which stands out particularly clearly among my otherwise rather jumbled memories of those two hours of rush and hurry. We had been leading our usual hand-to-mouth existence in the matter of food for some weeks previous to this, and one of the things we had most looked forward to our call at Port Stanley for was revictualling. We were losing no time in getting provisions aboard, and at the moment the signal to raise steam was received a lighter containing, among other things, a large cask of beer and a lot of salt pork had just moored alongside. We were really in great need of the salt pork, and--well, there seemed to be a considerable desire for the beer also. However, when the Devil drives, or a reckoning is to be settled with the Hun, one can't wait for such incidentals as food and drink. Knowing that we had enough aboard to keep going on until the game was played out, I ordered the lighter to cast off and turned my attention to more pertinent matters. I recalled later that I heard the winch grinding once or twice after I gave the order, but, seeing the lighter floating away with the tide presently, thought no more about it for the moment.  \"Carried hither and thither by the conflicting harbour currents, the lighter was half a cable's length or so off our port bow when the battle cruisers, spouting smoke like young volcanoes, came charging out to take up the chase of the Hun, and, by a strange chance, it was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42604"],["title","Stories of the Ships (#5)"],["body","indolently square athwart the course of the Flagship. The sharp bows of the _Invincible_ shore it through like a knife, and her propellers, with those of the _Inflexible_, quickly reduced boat and cargo to bobbing bits dancing in their bubbling wake.[A]  \"It really hurt me to see that good food and drink snatched almost out of our mouths, as it were, but I tried to put on a brave front and turn the matter off as a joke. 'Beer and pork sausage,' I remarked to one of my officers who had just come up to the bridge to report; 'the battle cruisers seem to have a good appetite for Hun diet this morning. I only hope they'll have as good luck gulping down the Huns themselves.'  \"'It's only \"sausage\" they put their teeth in, I'm glad to say, sir,' he replied with a grin. 'The men managed to hoist the beer aboard somehow before casting off the lighter, and as I came along just now I heard some one ordering that the cask be put down in a \"syfe plyce wher' it won't be 'oled if th' 'Un 'its us.\"'  \"'My word!' said the Captain, with the same look on his face that it had worn on another occasion when he had told me of the 'banquets' that had been served on the _Carmania_ when the _Cornwall_ had foregathered with her at a certain mid-Atlantic rendezvous after the former had sunk the _Cap Trafalgar_. 'My word! but we _did_ enjoy that beer when the time came to drink it. Yes, they shared and shared alike with the officers. Good old pirate law as to loot and salvage, you know.'  \"The _Kent_, which was at five minutes' notice, was the first ship to get under weigh, probably with orders to keep the enemy in sight but not, of course, to try to engage them. The _Glasgow_ was the next out, and then the _Carnarvon_. The _Cornwall_ was ready to follow close on the heels of the latter, but, as I have told you, had to wait for the battle cruisers, which were now under weigh. We went out not far astern of the _Inflexible_, and the _Bristol_, which had been on long notice in the inner harbour, was last, at a considerable interval.  \"The battle cruisers, with their turbines, worked up to full speed a great deal more rapidly than the ships with reciprocating engines, and, heading straight down the wake of the retreating Germans--now showing their fore-shortened silhouettes in 'Line Ahead' on the south-western horizon--they quickly drew away from all but the _Glasgow_. The latter, not long out of the dry dock and swiftest of the lot in any event, had passed the _Kent_ and was holding a southerly course, evidently with the intention of keeping the Hun light cruisers in sight and reporting their movements.  \"It took something like two hours after the British ships were out to convince Von Spee that all his efforts to go 'mehr schnell' were going to be of no avail. There was nothing left for him to do but to 'der fight gemachen.' In this he had two alternatives--to fight with all of his ships, or to fight a delaying action with a part of them and give the others a chance to escape. His choice was the one that any other sailor as gallant and able as Von Spee had proved himself to be would inevitably have taken. He plumped to fight with the _Scharnhorst_ and _Gneisenau_, and let the _Nürnberg_, _Leipzig_, and _Dresden_ make the most of their chances of scattering to safety. His signal, as we learned it later from prisoners, was substantially this: 'Light cruisers will make every endeavour to escape to South American ports. Armoured cruisers will engage enemy, and endeavour to delay.'  \"It was just about noon that I saw the tower-like, smoke-crowned silhouettes of the German ships gradually begin to lengthen, and when they held steady more or less beam-on I knew that the turn of eight points meant that Von Spee had made his decision. As the dark profiles began to draw apart--the two longest heading to port and the three shortest to starboard--I realised at once what that decision was. The armoured cruisers were going to try to draw the pursuit to the south, while the light cruisers sought safety by 'starring' on divergent courses to the south and south-west.  \"I think there will be no harm in my telling you that in all the possible contingencies we had discussed under which we might meet the enemy, there was none which roughly approximated to the conditions imposed upon us by the fact that he had unexpectedly come upon us in harbour--surprising us no less than himself--and forcing us to tumble out in pursuit of him in much the same order as a farmer and his family sallying forth following an alarm in their hen roost. What we had generally agreed would happen was that we--ourselves spread over a wide expanse of sea in 'Line Abreast'--would sight the enemy steaming in similar formation, and in that event it was understood that our battle cruisers should attend to the two German armoured cruisers, while the rest of us took on such of his light cruisers as we could most readily bring to action. Though already scattered over many miles of sea, our problem was really only that of conforming this 'elastic' general plan to present conditions.  \"The battle cruisers altered course instantly to continue the chase of the enemy armoured cruisers, but the Admiral, doubtless realising that, scattered as we were, each of the rest of us (already conversant with his general instructions) would be his own best judge as to where he could be most useful, left us to pick our own quarries. I made up my mind at once to go after the light cruisers, and, signalling 'Come on, _Kent_' (the Captain of the _Kent_ was my junior, and therefore subject to my orders in a case of this kind), headed off in the direction of what were still little more than three dark blurs on the south-westerly horizon. The _Glasgow_, which was a long way ahead to port, also decided (in view of instructions) in favour of going after the light cruisers, and, altering course sharply, passed astern of the battle cruisers and converged with the _Kent_ and _Cornwall_ in the chase. The _Carnarvon_, which for some reason was not steaming her best, and had been left a good distance astern, held on after the battle cruisers. The _Bristol_, which had been delayed in getting out of harbour, had been ordered to look after some steamers which had been following Von Spee, and which we believed to carry coal and provisions. We afterwards learned that one of them had a cargo of potatoes, and as potatoes chanced to be another of the many things which the _Cornwall_ was short of at this time, I have always harboured the same kind of grudge against the _Bristol_ for sinking these as I have against the _Invincible_ for putting down my salt pork.  \"As soon as it became evident what courses the Hun ships were steering, I signalled to the _Kent_ to go after the port ship, which turned out to be the _Nürnberg_, while I gave my attention to the middle one of the three, the _Leipzig_. This would have left the _Glasgow_ free to pursue and engage the third ship, the _Dresden_, which her twenty-six knots of speed should have enabled her to do handily. This plan, if it could have been carried out, would have made a clean sweep of Von Spee's squadron then and there, instead of giving the _Dresden_ a new lease on life, and some weeks more of uncertainty for merchant vessels of both the South Atlantic and Pacific. Where it slipped up was through the fact that the _Glasgow_ could not avoid engaging the _Leipzig en passant_ while endeavouring to get within range of the _Dresden_, and, once having taken on the latter, she was, bulldog-like, reluctant to draw off until her opponent was finished. As there was no other ship fast enough to catch up the _Dresden_, her escape was inevitable.  \"It was a little after four in the afternoon--almost to a minute the time I had reckoned it would be--that the fine burst of speed the _Cornwall_ had been putting on brought the _Leipzig_ well within range, and I gave the order to open fire. Previous to this the latter had been engaging in a very lively little running fight with the _Glasgow_, neither appearing to be inflicting serious damage to the other. The Hun's four-point-ones were about balanced by the _Glasgow's_ equal number of four-inch, but the latter's two six-inch gave her a comfortable margin that would have decided the issue in her favour in the end. The German gunners, always at their best at the beginning of an action, were making good practice, however, and the _Glasgow_ would have known she had had a fight on her hands before it was over.  \"At the intervention of the _Cornwall_, with her fourteen six-inch guns, the _Leipzig_--very pluckily and properly--turned her attention to the heavier armed, and therefore the more dangerous, of her two adversaries. We began hitting her at our third salvo, and it must have been about the same time that a shell from one of her well-served four-point-ones came crashing into the _Cornwall_. I must say it was jolly good work for such comparatively small guns. The extremely high angle they had to be fired at, though, reduced their chances of hitting, and I recall especially one beautifully bunched salvo which struck the water so close to the far side of the ship that it might almost have been dropped from an air-ship.  \"One of the gunners told me an amusing incident in connexion with that first hit. A boy, engaged in passing six-inch shells, was inclined to be rather nervous at the outset, and was coming in for a good deal of chaffing from his more callous mates. When the bang and jar of that first explosion ran through the ship, a shell had just been handed him to shove along, but, quivering all over, he stood rooted in his tracks and demanded to know what the noise was. A guffaw of laughter ran round, at the end of which an old gunner replied, 'That, me son, is our fust vaxinashun mark.' Gradually a grin of comprehension and reassurance replaced the look of terror on the lad's face as he realised that it isn't necessarily so serious a thing"]]]
