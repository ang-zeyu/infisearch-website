We had endured together the Winter's cold, the dispiriting drench of the rain, the fatigue of the long march, the discomforts of the muddy camp, the gripings of hunger, the weariness of the drill and review, the perils of the vidette post, the courier service, the scout and the fight.  We had shared in common                 The whips and scorns of time,                The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,                The insolence of office, and the spurns  which a patient private and his horse of the unworthy take; we had had our frequently recurring rows with other fellows and their horses, over questions of precedence at watering places, and grass-plots, had had lively tilts with guards of forage piles in surreptitious attempts to get additional rations, sometimes coming off victorious and sometimes being driven off ingloriously.  I had often gone hungry that he might have the only ear of corn obtainable.  I am not skilled enough in horse lore to speak of his points or pedigree.  I only know that his strong limbs never failed me, and that he was always ready for duty and ever willing.  Now at last our paths diverged.  I was retired from actual service to a prison, and he bore his new master off to battle against his old friends.                 ...........................  Packed closely in old, dilapidated stock and box cars, as if cattle in shipment to market, we pounded along slowly, and apparently interminably, toward the Rebel capital.  The railroads of the South were already in very bad condition.  They were never more than passably good, even in their best estate, but now, with a large part of the skilled men engaged upon them escaped back to the North, with all renewal, improvement, or any but the most necessary repairs stopped for three years, and with a marked absence of even ordinary skill and care in their management, they were as nearly ruined as they could well be and still run.  One of the severe embarrassments under which the roads labored was a lack of oil.  There is very little fatty matter of any kind in the South. The climate and the food plants do not favor the accumulation of adipose tissue by animals, and there is no other source of supply.  Lard oil and tallow were very scarce and held at exorbitant prices.  Attempts were made to obtain lubricants from the peanut and the cotton seed.  The first yielded a fine bland oil, resembling the ordinary grade of olive oil, but it was entirely too expensive for use in the arts. The cotton seed oil could be produced much cheaper, but it had in it such a quantity of gummy matter as to render it worse than useless for employment on machinery.  This scarcity of oleaginous matter produced a corresponding scarcity of soap and similar detergents, but this was a deprivation which caused the Rebels, as a whole, as little inconvenience as any that they suffered from.  I have seen many thousands of them who were obviously greatly in need of soap, but if they were rent with any suffering on that account they concealed it with marvelous self-control.  There seemed to be a scanty supply of oil provided for the locomotives, but the cars had to run with unlubricated axles, and the screaking and groaning of the grinding journals in the dry boxes was sometimes almost deafening, especially when we were going around a curve.  Our engine went off the wretched track several times, but as she was not running much faster than a man could walk, the worst consequence to us was a severe jolting.  She was small, and was easily pried back upon the track, and sent again upon her wheezy, straining way.  The depression which had weighed us down for a night and a day after our capture had now been succeeded by a more cheerful feeling.  We began to look upon our condition as the fortune of war.  We were proud of our resistance to overwhelming numbers.  We knew we had sold ourselves at a price which, if the Rebels had it to do over again, they would not pay for us.  We believed that we had killed and seriously wounded as many of them as they had killed, wounded and captured of us.  We had nothing to blame ourselves for.  Moreover, we began to be buoyed up with the expectation that we would be exchanged immediately upon our arrival at Richmond, and the Rebel officers confidently assured us that this would be so.  There was then a temporary hitch in the exchange, but it would all be straightened out in a few days, and it might not be a month until we were again marching out of Cumberland Gap, on an avenging foray against some of the force which had assisted in our capture.  Fortunately for this delusive hopefulness there was no weird and boding Cassandra to pierce the veil of the future for us, and reveal the length and the ghastly horror of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, through which we must pass for hundreds of sad days, stretching out into long months of suffering and death.  Happily there was no one to tell us that of every five in that party four would never stand under the Stars and Stripes again, but succumbing to chronic starvation, long-continued exposure, the bullet of the brutal guard, the loathsome scurvy, the hideous gangrene, and the heartsickness of hope deferred, would find respite from pain low in the barren sands of that hungry Southern soil.  Were every doom foretokened by appropriate omens, the ravens along our route would have croaked themselves hoarse.  But, far from being oppressed by any presentiment of coming evil, we began to appreciate and enjoy the picturesque grandeur of the scenery through which we were moving.  The rugged sternness of the Appalachian mountain range, in whose rock-ribbed heart we had fought our losing fight, was now softening into less strong, but more graceful outlines as we approached the pine-clad, sandy plains of the seaboard, upon which Richmond is built.  We were skirting along the eastern base of the great Blue Ridge, about whose distant and lofty summits hung a perpetual veil of deep, dark, but translucent blue, which refracted the slanting rays of the morning and evening sun into masses of color more gorgeous than a dreamer's vision of an enchanted land.  At Lynchburg we saw the famed Peaks of Otter--twenty miles away--lifting their proud heads far into the clouds, like giant watch-towers sentineling the gateway that the mighty waters of the James had forced through the barriers of solid adamant lying across their path to the far-off sea.  What we had seen many miles back start from the mountain sides as slender rivulets, brawling over the worn boulders, were now great, rushing, full-tide streams, enough of them in any fifty miles of our journey to furnish water power for all the factories of New England.  Their amazing opulence of mechanical energy has lain unutilized, almost unnoticed; in the two and one-half centuries that the white man has dwelt near them, while in Massachusetts and her near neighbors every rill that can turn a wheel has been put into harness and forced to do its share of labor for the benefit of the men who have made themselves its masters.  Here is one of the differences between the two sections: In the North man was set free, and the elements made to do his work.  In the South man was the degraded slave, and the elements wantoned on in undisturbed freedom.  As we went on, the Valleys of the James and the Appomattox, down which our way lay, broadened into an expanse of arable acres, and the faces of those streams were frequently flecked by gem-like little islands.     CHAPTER VII.  ENTERING RICHMOND--DISAPPOINTMENT AT ITS APPEARANCE--EVERYBODY IN UNIFORM--CURLED DARLINGS OF THE CAPITAL--THE REBEL FLAG--LIBBY PRISON --DICK TURNER--SEARCHING THE NEW COMERS.  Early on the tenth morning after our capture we were told that we were about to enter Richmond.  Instantly all were keenly observant of every detail in the surroundings of a City that was then the object of the hopes and fears of thirty-five millions of people--a City assailing which seventy-five thousand brave men had already laid down their lives, defending which an equal number had died, and which, before it fell, was to cost the life blood of another one hundred and fifty thousand valiant assailants and defenders.  So much had been said and written about Richmond that our boyish minds had wrought up the most extravagant expectations of it and its defenses. We anticipated seeing a City differing widely from anything ever seen before; some anomaly of nature displayed in its site, itself guarded by imposing and impregnable fortifications, with powerful forts and heavy guns, perhaps even walls, castles, postern gates, moats and ditches, and all the other panoply of defensive warfare, with which romantic history had made us familiar.  We were disappointed--badly disappointed--in seeing nothing of this as we slowly rolled along.  The spires and the tall chimneys of the factories rose in the distance very much as they had in other Cities we had visited.  We passed a single line of breastworks of bare yellow sand, but the scrubby pines in front were not cut away, and there were no signs that there had ever been any immediate expectation of use for the works. A redoubt or two--without guns--could be made out, and this was all. Grim-visaged war had few wrinkles on his front in that neighborhood. They were then seaming his brow on the Rappahannock, seventy miles away, where the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac lay confronting each other.  At one of the stopping places I had been separated from my companions by entering a car in which were a number of East Tennesseeans, captured in the operations around Knoxville, and whom the Rebels, in accordance with their usual custom, were treating with studied contumely.  I had always had a very warm side for these simple rustics of the mountains and valleys.  I knew much of their unwavering"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4258"],["title","Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons â€” Volume 2 (#0)"],["body","A STORY OF REBEL MILITARY PRISONS                  FIFTEEN MONTHS A GUEST OF THE SO-CALLED                           SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY                       A PRIVATE SOLDIERS EXPERIENCE                                    IN                RICHMOND, ANDERSONVILLE, SAVANNAH, MILLEN                         BLACKSHEAR AND FLORENCE                               BY JOHN McELROY                       Late of Co.

A NEW LOT OF PRISONERS--THE BATTLE OF OOLUSTEE--MEN SACRIFICED TO A GENERAL'S INCOMPETENCY--A HOODLUM REINFORCEMENT--A QUEER CROWD --MISTREATMENT OF AN OFFICER OF A COLORED REGIMENT--KILLING THE SERGEANT OF A NEGRO SQUAD.  So far only old prisoners--those taken at Gettysburg, Chicamauga and Mine Run--had been brought in.  The armies had been very quiet during the Winter, preparing for the death grapple in the Spring.  There had been nothing done, save a few cavalry raids, such as our own, and Averill's attempt to gain and break up the Rebel salt works at Wytheville, and Saltville.  Consequently none but a few cavalry prisoners were added to the number already in the hands of the Rebels.  The first lot of new ones came in about the middle of March.  There were about seven hundred of them, who had been captured at the battle of Oolustee, Fla., on the 20th of February.  About five hundred of them were white, and belonged to the Seventh Connecticut, the Seventh New Hampshire, Forty Seventh, Forty-Eighth and One Hundred and Fifteenth New York, and Sherman's regular battery.  The rest were colored, and belonged to the Eighth United States, and Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts.  The story they told of the battle was one which had many shameful reiterations during the war.  It was the story told whenever Banks, Sturgis, Butler, or one of a host of similar smaller failures were trusted with commands. It was a senseless waste of the lives of private soldiers, and the property of the United States by pretentious blunderers, who, in some inscrutable manner, had attained to responsible commands.  In this instance, a bungling Brigadier named Seymore had marched his forces across the State of Florida, to do he hardly knew what, and in the neighborhood of an enemy of whose numbers, disposition, location, and intentions he was profoundly ignorant.  The Rebels, under General Finnegan, waited till he had strung his command along through swamps and cane brakes, scores of miles from his supports, and then fell unexpectedly upon his advance.  The regiment was overpowered, and another regiment that hurried up to its support, suffered the same fate.  The balance of the regiments were sent in in the same manner--each arriving on the field just after its predecessor had been thoroughly whipped by the concentrated force of the Rebels.  The men fought gallantly, but the stupidity of a Commanding General is a thing that the gods themselves strive against in vain.  We suffered a humiliating defeat, with a loss of two thousand men and a fine rifled battery, which was brought to Andersonville and placed in position to command the prison.  The majority of the Seventh New Hampshire were an unwelcome addition to our numbers.  They were N'Yaarkers--old time colleagues of those already in with us--veteran bounty jumpers, that had been drawn to New Hampshire by the size of the bounty offered there, and had been assigned to fill up the wasted ranks of the veteran Seventh regiment.  They had tried to desert as soon as they received their bounty, but the Government clung to them literally with hooks of steel, sending many of them to the regiment in irons.  Thus foiled, they deserted to the Rebels during the retreat from the battlefield.  They were quite an accession to the force of our N'Yaarkers, and helped much to establish the hoodlum reign which was shortly inaugurated over the whole prison.  The Forty-Eighth New Yorkers who came in were a set of chaps so odd in every way as to be a source of never-failing interest.  The name of their regiment was 'L'Enfants Perdu' (the Lost Children), which we anglicized into \"The Lost Ducks.\"  It was believed that every nation in Europe was represented in their ranks, and it used to be said jocularly, that no two of them spoke the same language.  As near as I could find out they were all or nearly all South Europeans, Italians, Spaniards; Portuguese, Levantines, with a predominance of the French element.  They wore a little cap with an upturned brim, and a strap resting on the chin, a coat with funny little tales about two inches long, and a brass chain across the breast; and for pantaloons they had a sort of a petticoat reaching to the knees, and sewed together down the middle.  They were just as singular otherwise as in their looks, speech and uniform.  On one occasion the whole mob of us went over in a mass to their squad to see them cook and eat a large water snake, which two of them had succeeded in capturing in the swamps, and carried off to their mess, jabbering in high glee over their treasure trove.  Any of us were ready to eat a piece of dog, cat, horse or mule, if we could get it, but, it was generally agreed, as Dawson, of my company expressed it, that \"Nobody but one of them darned queer Lost Ducks would eat a varmint like a water snake.\"  Major Albert Bogle, of the Eighth United States, (colored) had fallen into the hands of the rebels by reason of a severe wound in the leg, which left him helpless upon the field at Oolustee.  The Rebels treated him with studied indignity.  They utterly refused to recognize him as an officer, or even as a man.  Instead of being sent to Macon or Columbia, where the other officers were, he was sent to Andersonville, the same as an enlisted man.  No care was given his wound, no surgeon would examine it or dress it.  He was thrown into a stock car, without a bed or blanket, and hauled over the rough, jolting road to Andersonville. Once a Rebel officer rode up and fired several shots at him, as he lay helpless on the car floor.  Fortunately the Rebel's marksmanship was as bad as his intentions, and none of the shots took effect.  He was placed in a squad near me, and compelled to get up and hobble into line when the rest were mustered for roll-call.  No opportunity to insult, \"the nigger officer,\" was neglected, and the N'Yaarkers vied with the Rebels in heaping abuse upon him.  He was a fine, intelligent young man, and bore it all with dignified self-possession, until after a lapse of some weeks the Rebels changed their policy and took him from the prison to send to where the other officers were.  The negro soldiers were also treated as badly as possible.  The wounded were turned into the Stockade without having their hurts attended to. One stalwart, soldierly Sergeant had received a bullet which had forced its way under the scalp for some distance, and partially imbedded itself in the skull, where it still remained.  He suffered intense agony, and would pass the whole night walking up and down the street in front of our tent, moaning distressingly.  The bullet could be felt plainly with the fingers, and we were sure that it would not be a minute's work, with a sharp knife, to remove it and give the man relief.  But we could not prevail upon the Rebel Surgeons even to see the man.  Finally inflammation set in and he died.  The negros were made into a squad by themselves, and taken out every day to work around the prison.  A white Sergeant was placed over them, who was the object of the contumely of the guards and other Rebels.  One day as he was standing near the gate, waiting his orders to come out, the gate guard, without any provocation whatever, dropped his gun until the muzzle rested against the Sergeant's stomach, and fired, killing him instantly.  The Sergeantcy was then offered to me, but as I had no accident policy, I was constrained to decline the honor.     CHAPTER XXIV.  APRIL--LONGING TO GET OUT--THE DEATH RATE--THE PLAGUE OF LICE --THE SO-CALLED HOSPITAL.  April brought sunny skies and balmy weather.   Existence became much more tolerable.  With freedom it would have been enjoyable, even had we been no better fed, clothed and sheltered.  But imprisonment had never seemed so hard to bear--even in the first few weeks--as now.  It was easier to submit to confinement to a limited area, when cold and rain were aiding hunger to benumb the faculties and chill the energies than it was now, when Nature was rousing her slumbering forces to activity, and earth, and air and sky were filled with stimulus to man to imitate her example. The yearning to be up and doing something-to turn these golden hours to good account for self and country--pressed into heart and brain as the vivifying sap pressed into tree-duct and plant cell, awaking all vegetation to energetic life.  To be compelled, at such a time, to lie around in vacuous idleness --to spend days that should be crowded full of action in a monotonous, objectless routine of hunting lice, gathering at roll-call, and drawing and cooking our scanty rations, was torturing.  But to many of our number the aspirations for freedom were not, as with us, the desire for a wider, manlier field of action, so much as an intense longing to get where care and comforts would arrest their swift progress to the shadowy hereafter.  The cruel rains had sapped away their stamina, and they could not recover it with the meager and innutritious diet of coarse meal, and an occasional scrap of salt meat.  Quick consumption, bronchitis, pneumonia, low fever and diarrhea seized upon these ready victims for their ravages, and bore them off at the rate of nearly a score a day.  It now became a part of, the day's regular routine to take a walk past the gates in the morning, inspect and count the dead, and see if any friends were among them.  Clothes having by this time become a very important consideration with the prisoners,"]]]
