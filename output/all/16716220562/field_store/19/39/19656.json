So, you too, are not that clever.\" She turned back to the boy. \"But I have need of a good thief. Will you come with me? And you, poet, I have need of one who thinks so meticulously and who delves into places where even my priests and priestesses do not go. Will you come with me?\"  \"Where are we going?\"  \"Aboard that ship,\" she said, smiling toward the vessel.  \"That's a good boat,\" said Urson. \"I'd be proud to sail on her, Geo.\"  \"The captain is in my service,\" the woman told Geo. \"He will take you on. Perhaps you will get a chance to see the world, and become the man you wish to be.\"  Geo saw that Urson was beginning to look uneasy, and said, \"My friend goes on whatever ship I do. This we've promised each other. Besides, he is a good sailor, while I have no knowledge of the sea.\"  \"On our last journey,\" the woman explained, \"we lost men. I do not think your friend will have trouble getting a berth.\"  \"Then we'll be honored to come,\" said Geo. \"Under whose service shall we be, then, for we still don't know who you are?\"  Now the veil fell across her face again. \"I am a high priestess of the Goddess Argo. Now, who are you?\"  \"My name is Geo,\" Geo told her.  \"Of the Earth, then, your name,\" she said. \"And you, Urson, the bear. And Lamio, the little Snake. I welcome you aboard our ship.\"  Just then, from down the street, came the captain and the mate, Jordde. They emerged from the diagonal of shadow that lanced over the cobbles, slowly, heavily. The captain squinted out across the ships toward the horizon, the copper light filling his deepening wrinkles and burnishing the planes of flesh around his gray eyes. As they approached, the priestess turned to them. \"Captain, I have three men as a token replacement at least for the ones my folly helped lose.\"  Urson, Geo, and Snake looked at each other, and then toward the captain.  Jordde looked at all three.  \"You seem strong,\" the captain said to Urson, \"a sea-bred man. But this one,\" and he looked at Snake now, \"one of the Strange Ones....\"  \"They're bad luck on a ship,\" interrupted the mate. \"Most ships won't take them at all, ma'am. This one's just a boy, and for all his spindles there, couldn't haul rope or reef sails. Ma'am, he'd be no good to us at all. And we've had too much bad luck already.\"  \"He's not for rope pulling,\" laughed the priestess. \"The little Snake is my guest. The others you can put to ship's work. I know you are short of men. But I have my own plans for this one.\"  \"As you say, ma'am,\" said the captain.  \"But Priestess,\" began Jordde.  \"As you say,\" repeated the captain, and the mate stepped back, quieted. The captain turned to Geo now. \"And who are you?\" he asked.  \"I'm Geo, before and still a poet. But I'll do what work you set me, sir.\"  \"And you?\" Jordde asked Urson.  \"I'm a good sea-son of the waves, can stand triple watch without flagging, and I believe I'm already hired.\" He looked to the captain.  \"But what do they call you?\" Jordde asked. \"You have a familiar look, like one I've had under me before.\"  \"They call me the handsome sailor, the fastest rope reeler, the quickest line hauler, the speediest sheaf reefer....\"  \"Your name, man, your name,\" Jordde demanded.  \"Some call me Urson.\"  \"That's the name I knew you by before! Do you think I'd sail with you again, when I myself put it in black and white and sent it to every captain and mate in the dock? For three months now you've had no berth, and if you had none for three hundred years it would be too soon.\"  Jordde turned to the captain now. \"He's a troublemaker, sir, a fight-starter. Though he's as wild as waves and with the strength of mizzen spars, spirit in a man is one thing, and a fight or two the same; but good sailor though he be, I've sworn not to have him on ship with me, sir. He's nearly murdered half a dozen men and probably has murdered half a dozen more. No mate who knows the men of this harbor will take him on.\"  The Priestess of Argo laughed. \"Captain, take him.\" Now she looked at Geo. \"The words for calming the angry bear have been recited before him. Now, Geo, we will see how good a poet you are, and if the spell works.\" At last she turned toward Urson. \"Have you ever killed a man.\"  Urson was silent a moment. \"I have.\"  \"Had you told me that,\" said the Priestess, \"I would have chosen you first. I have need of you also. Captain, you must take him. If he is a good sailor, then we cannot spare him. I will channel what special talents he may have. Geo, since you said the spell, and are his friend, I charge you with his control. Also, I wish to talk with you, poet, student of rituals. Come, you all may stay on board ship tonight.\"     CHAPTER II   An oil lamp leaked yellow light on the wooden walls of the ship's forecastle. Geo wrinkled his nose, then shrugged.  \"Well,\" said Urson, \"this is a pleasant enough hole.\" He climbed one of the tiers of bunked beds and pounded the ticking with the flat of his hand. \"Here, I'll take this one. Little wriggly arms, you look like you have a strong stomach, so you take the middle. And Geo, sling yourself down in the bottom there.\" He clumped to the floor again. \"The lower down you are,\" he explained, \"the better you sleep, because of the rocking. Well, what do you think of your first forecastle, Geo?\"  The poet was silent. As he turned his head, double pins of light struck yellow dots in his dark eyes, and then went out as he turned from the lamp.  \"I put you in the bottom because a little rough weather can unseat your belly pretty fast if you're up near the ceiling and not used to it,\" Urson expanded, dropping his hand heavily on Geo's shoulder. \"I told you I'd look out for you, didn't I, friend?\"  But Geo turned away and seemed to examine something else.  Urson looked at Snake now, who was watching him from against one wall. Urson's glance was puzzled. Snake's only silent.  \"Hey.\" Urson spoke to Geo once more. \"Let's you and me take a run around this ship and see what's tied down where. A good sailor does that first thing--unless he's too drunk. But that lets the captain and the mate know he's got an alert eye out, and sometimes he can learn something that will ease some back-bending later on. What do you say?\"  \"Not now, Urson,\" interrupted Geo. \"You go.\"  \"And would you please tell me why my company suddenly isn't good enough for you. This sudden silence is a bilgy way to treat somebody who's sworn himself to see that you make the best first voyage that a man could have. Why, I think ...\"  \"When did you kill a man?\" Geo suddenly turned.  The giant stood still, his hands twisting into double knots of bone and muscle. Then they opened. \"Maybe it was a year ago,\" he said softly. \"And maybe it was a year, two months, and five days, on a Thursday morning at eight o'clock in the brig of a heaving ship. Which would make it about five days and ten hours.\"  \"How could you kill a man?\" Geo asked. \"How could you go for a year and not tell me about it, and then admit it to a stranger just like that? You were my friend, we've slept under the same blanket, drank from the same wineskin. But what sort of a person are you?\"  \"And what sort of a person are you?\" said the giant. \"A nosy bastard that I'd break in seven pieces if ...\" he heaved in a breadth. \"If I hadn't promised I'd make no trouble. I've never broken a promise to anyone, alive or dead.\" The fists formed, relaxed again.  Suddenly he raised one hand, flung it away, and spat on the floor. Then he turned toward the steps to the door.  Then the noise hit them. They both turned toward Snake. The boy's black eyes darted under twin spots of light from the lamp, to Urson, to Geo, then back.  The noise came again, quieter this time, and recognizable as the word _Help_, only it was no sound, but like the fading hum of a tuning fork inside their skulls, immediate, yet fuzzy.  _... You ... help ... me ... together_ ... came the words once more, indistinct and blurring into one another.  \"Hey,\" Urson said, \"is that you?\"  _... Do ... not ... angry_ ... came the words.  \"We're not angry,\" Geo said. \"What are you doing?\"  _I ... thinking_ ... were the words that seemed to generate from the boy now.  \"What sort of a way to think is that if everyone can hear it?\" demanded Urson.  Snake tried to explain. _Not ... everyone ... Just ... you ... You ... think ... I ... hear ..._ came the sound again. _I ... think ... You ... hear._  \"I know we hear,\" Urson said. \"It's just like you were talking.\"  \"That's not what he means,\" Geo said. \"He means he hears what we think just like we hear him. Is that right, Snake?\"  _When ... you ... think ... loud ... I ... hear._  \"I may just have been doing some pretty loud thinking,\" Urson said. \"And if I thought something I wasn't supposed to, well, I apologize.\"  Snake didn't seem interested in the apology, but asked again, _You ... help ... me ... together_.  \"What sort of help do you want?\" Geo asked.  \"And what sort of trouble are you in that you need help out of it?\" added Urson.  _You ... don't ... have ... good ... minds_, Snake said.  \"What's that supposed to mean?\" Urson asked. \"Our minds are as good as any in Leptar. You heard the way the priestess talked to my friend the poet, here.\"  \"I think he means we don't hear very well,\" said Geo.  Snake nodded.  \"Oh,\" Urson said. \"Well, then you'll just have to go slow and be patient with us.\"  Snake shook his head. _Get ... hoarse ... when ... shout ... so ... loud._ Suddenly he went over to the bunks. _You ... hear ... better ... see ... too if ... sleep._  \"Sleep is sort of far from me,\" Urson said, rubbing his beard with the back of his wrist.  \"Me too,\" Geo admitted. \"Can't you tell us something more?\"  _Sleep_, Snake said.  \"What about talking like an ordinary human being?\" suggested Urson, still somewhat perplexed.  _Once ... speak_, Snake told them.  \"You say you could speak once?\" asked Geo. \"What happened?\"  Here the boy opened his mouth and pointed.  Geo stepped forward, held the boy's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41981"],["title","The Jewels of Aptor (#3)"],["body","in his hand and examined the face and peered into the mouth. \"By the Goddess!\" he exclaimed.  \"What is it?\" Urson asked.  Geo came away now, his face lined in a sickly frown. \"His tongue has been hacked out,\" he told the giant. \"And not too neatly, either.\"  \"Who on the seven seas and six continents did a thing like that to you, boy?\" Urson demanded.  Snake shook his head.  \"Now come on, Snake,\" he urged. \"You can't keep secrets like that from friends and expect them to rescue you from I don't know what. Now who was it hacked your voice away?\"  _What ... man ... you ... kill ..._ came the sound.  Urson stopped, and then he laughed. \"All right,\" he said. \"I see.\" His voice rose once more. \"But if you can hear thoughts, you know the man already. And you know the reason. And this is what we'd find out of you, and only for help and friendship's sake.\"  _You ... know ... the ... man_, Snake said.  Geo and Urson exchanged puzzled frowns.  _Sleep_, said Snake. _You ... sleep ... now._  \"Maybe we ought to try,\" said Geo, \"and find out what's going on.\" He crossed to his bunk and slipped in. Urson followed and hoisted himself onto the upper berth, dangling his feet against the wooden support. \"It's going to be a long time before sleep gets to me tonight,\" he said. \"You know the rituals and about magic. Aren't the Strange Ones some sort of magic?\"  \"The only mention of them in rituals says that they are ashes of the Great Fire. The Great Fire was back before the purges, the ones I spoke to the priestess about, so I don't know anything more about them.\"  \"Sailors have stories of the Great Fire,\" Urson said. \"They say the sea boiled, great birds spat fire from the sky, and beasts rose up from the waves and destroyed the harbors. But what were the purges you mentioned?\"  \"About five hundred years ago,\" Geo explained, \"all the rituals of the Goddess Argo were destroyed. A completely new set were initiated into the temple practices. All references to them were destroyed also, and with them, much of Leptar's history. Stories have it that the rituals and incantations were too powerful. But this is just a guess, and most priests are very uncomfortable about speculating.\"  \"That was after the Great Fire?\" Urson asked.  \"Nearly a thousand years after,\" Geo said.  \"It must have been a Great Fire indeed if ashes from it are still falling from the wombs of healthy women.\" He looked down at Snake. \"Is it true that a drop of your blood in vinegar will cure gout? If one of you kisses a female baby, will she have only girl children?\" He laughed.  \"You know those are only tales,\" Geo said.  \"There used to be a one with two heads that sat outside the Blue Tavern and spun a top all day. It was an idiot, though. But the dwarfs and the legless ones that wheel about the city and do tricks, they are clever. But strange, and quiet, usually.\"  \"You oaf,\" chided Geo, \"you could be one too. How many men do you know who reach your size and strength by normal means?\"  \"You're a crazy liar,\" said Urson. Then he scrunched his eyebrows together in thought, and at last shrugged. \"Well anyway, I never heard of one who could hear what you thought. It would make me uncomfortable walking down the street.\" He looked down at Snake between his legs. \"Can you all do that?\"  Snake, from the middle bunk, shook his head. Urson stretched out on his back, but then suddenly looked over the edge of the berth toward Geo. \"Hey, Geo, what about those little baubles she had. Do you know what they are?\"  \"No, I don't,\" Geo said. \"But she was concerned over them enough.\" He looked up over the bunk bottom between himself and Urson. \"Snake, will you give me another look at that thing?\"  Snake held out the thong and the jewel.  \"Where did you get it?\" Urson asked. \"Oh, never mind. I guess we learn that when we go to sleep.\"  Geo reached for it, but Snake's one hand closed and three others sprang around it. \"I wasn't going to take it,\" explained Geo. \"I just wanted to see.\"  Suddenly the door of the forecastle opened, and the tall mate was silhouetted against the brighter light behind him. \"Poet,\" he called. \"She wants to see you.\" Then he was gone.  Geo looked at the other two, shrugged, and then swung off the berth, made his way up the steps and into the hall.  On deck it was completely dark. As he walked, a door before him opened and a blade of illumination sliced the deck. He jumped.  \"Come in,\" summoned the Priestess of Argo, and he turned into a windowless cabin and stopped one step beyond the threshold. The walls rippled tapestries, lucent green, scarlet. Golden braziers perched on tapering legged tripods beneath plumes of pale blue smoke that lent thin incense in the room, pierced faintly but cleanly into his nostrils like knives. Light lashed the polished wooden newels of a great bed on which sat swirls of silk, damasked satin, brocade. A huge desk, cornered with wooden eagles, was spread with papers, meticulous instruments of cartography, sextants, rules, compasses, and great shabby books were piled on one corner. Above, from the beamed ceiling, hung by thick chains, swayed a branching candelabra of oil cups, some in the hands of demons, the mouths of monkeys, burning in the bellies of nymphs, or between the horns of satyrs' heads--red, clear green, or yellow-white.  \"Come in,\" repeated the priestess. \"Close the door.\"  Geo obeyed.  She walked behind her desk, sat down, and folded her hands in front of her veiled face. \"What do you know of the real world, outside Leptar?\"  \"That there is much water, some land, and mostly ignorance.\"  \"What tales have you heard from your bear friend, Urson? He is a traveled man and should know some of what there is of the earth.\"  \"The stories of sailors,\" said Geo, \"are menageries of beasts that no one has ever seen, of lands for which no maps exist, and of peoples whom no man has met.\"  She smiled. \"Since I boarded this ship I have heard many tales from sailors, and I have learned more from them than from all my priests. You, on the docks there, this evening, have been the only man to give me another scrap of the puzzle except a few drunken seamen, misremembering old fantasies.\" She paused. \"What do you know of the jewels you saw tonight?\"  \"Nothing, ma'am.\"  \"A common thief hiding on the docks had one; I, a priestess of Argo, possess another; and if you had one, you would probably exchange it for a kiss with some tavern maid. What do you know of the god Hama?\"  \"I know of no such god.\"  \"You,\" she said, \"who can spout all the rituals and incantations of the white goddess Argo, you do not even know the name of the dark god Hama. What do you know of the Island of Aptor?\"  \"Nothing, ma'am.\"  \"This boat has been to Aptor once and now will return again. Ask your ignorant friend the Bear to tell you tales of Aptor; and blind, wise poet, you will laugh, and probably he will, too. But I will tell you: his tales, his legends, and his fantasies are not a tithe of the truth, not a tithe. Perhaps you will be no help after all. I am thinking of dismissing you.\"  \"But, ma'am ...\" Geo began.  The priestess looked up, having been about to begin some work.  Geo regained himself. \"Ma'am, what can you tell me about these things? You have scattered only crumbs. I have extensive knowledge of incantation, poetry, magic, and I know these concern your problem. Give me what information you have, and I will be able to render mine in full. I am familiar with many sailors' tales. True, none of Aptor, or Hama, but I may be able to collate fragments. I have learned the legends and jargon of thieves through a broad life; this is more than your priests have, I'll wager. I have had teachers who were afraid to touch books I have opened. And I fear no secret you might hold.\"  \"No, you are not afraid,\" admitted the priestess. \"You are honorable, and foolish--and a poet. I hope the first and last will wipe out the middle one in time. Nevertheless, I will tell you some.\" She stood up now, and drew out a map.  \"Here is Leptar,\" she pointed to one island. Then her finger moved over water to another. \"This is Aptor. Now you know as much about it as any ordinary person in Leptar might. Aptor is a barbaric land, uncivilized. Yet they occasionally show some insidious organization. Tell me, what legends of the Great Fire have you heard?\"  \"I know that beasts are supposed to have come from the sea and destroyed the world's harbors, and that birds spat fire from the sky.\"  \"The older sailors,\" said the priestess, \"will tell you that these were beasts and birds of Aptor. Of course, there is fifteen hundred years of retelling and distortion in a tradition never written down, and perhaps Aptor has simply become a synonym for everything evil, but these stories still give you some idea. Chronicles, which only three or four people have had access to, tell me that once five hundred years ago, the forces of Aptor actually attempted to invade Leptar. The references to it are vague. I do not know how far it went nor how successful it was, but its methods were insidious and very unlike any invasion you may have read of in history. So unlike, that records of it were destroyed, and no mention of it is made in the histories given to school children.  \"Only recently have I had a chance to learn how strange and inhuman they were. And I have good reason to believe that the forces of Aptor are congealing once more, a sluggish but huge amoeba of horror. Once fully awake, once launched, it will be irrevocable. Tendrils have reached into us for the past few years, probed, and then withdrawn before they were recognized. Sometimes they dealt catastrophic blows to the center of Leptar's government and religion. All this has been assiduously kept from the people. I have been sent to clear perhaps just one more veil from our ignorance. And if you can help me in that, you are welcome.\"  \"What of the jewels, and of Hama?\" inquired Geo. \"Is he a god of Aptor under whom these forces are being marshaled?"]]]
