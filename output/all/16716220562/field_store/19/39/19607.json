Autore Ioanne Walthero.\"  That it is good, and pleasing to God, for us to sing spiritual songs is, I think, a truth whereof no Christian can be ignorant; since not only the example of the prophets and kings of the Old Testament (who praised God with singing and music, poesy and all kind of stringed instruments) but also the like practice of all Christendom from the beginning, especially in respect to psalms, is well known to every one: yea, St. Paul doth also appoint the same (I Cor. xiv.) and command the Colossians, in the third chapter, to sing spiritual songs and psalms from the heart unto the Lord, that thereby the word of God and Christian doctrine be in every way furthered and practiced.  Accordingly, to make a good beginning and to encourage others who can do it better, I have myself, with some others, put together a few hymns, in order to bring into full play the blessed Gospel, which by God's grace hath again risen: that we may boast, as Moses doth in his song (Exodus xv.) that Christ is become our praise and our song, and that, whether we sing or speak, we may not know anything save Christ our Saviour, as St. Paul saith (I Cor. ii).  These songs have been set in four parts, for no other reason than because I wished to provide our young people (who both will and ought to be instructed in music and other sciences) with something whereby they might rid themselves of amorous and carnal songs, and in their stead learn something wholesome, and so apply themselves to what is good with pleasure, as becometh the young.  Beside this, I am not of opinion that all sciences should be beaten down and made to cease by the Gospel, as some fanatics pretend; but I would fain see all the arts, and music in particular, used in the service of Him who hath given and created them.  Therefore I entreat every pious Christian to give a favorable reception to these hymns, and to help forward my undertaking, according as God hath given him more or less ability. The world is, alas, not so mindful and diligent to train and teach our poor youth, but that we ought to be forward in promoting the same. God grant us his grace. Amen.   Luther's Second Preface.  To the Funeral Hymns: _\"Christliche Geseng, Lateinisch und Deudsch, zum Begrebnis. Wittemberg,_ Anno m. d. xlii.\"  DR. MARTIN LUTHER TO THE CHRISTIAN READER. St. Paul writes to the Thessalonians, that they should not sorrow for the dead as others who have no hope, but should comfort one another with God's word, as they who have a sure hope of life and of the resurrection of the dead. For that they should sorrow who have no hope is not to be wondered at, nor indeed are they to be blamed for it, since, being shut out from the faith of Christ, they must either regard and love the present life only, and be loth to lose it, or after this life look for everlasting death and the wrath of God in hell, and be unwilling to go thither.  But we Christians who from all this have been redeemed by the precious blood of the Son of God, should exercise and wont ourselves in faith to despise death, to look on it as a deep, sound, sweet sleep, the coffin no other than the bosom of our Lord Christ, or paradise, the grave nought but a soft couch of rest; as indeed it is in the sight of God, as he saith in St. John, xi., \"our friend Lazarus sleepeth;\" Matthew ix., \"the maid is not dead but sleepeth.\"  In like manner also St. Paul, I Cor. xv., doth put out of sight the unlovely aspect of death in our perishing body, and bring forward nought but the lovely and delightsome view of life, when he saith: \"It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonor (that is, in a loathsome and vile form); it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.\"  Accordingly have we, in our churches, abolished, done away, and out-and-out made an end of the popish horrors, such as wakes, masses for the soul, obsequies, purgatory, and all other mummeries for the dead, and will no longer have our churches turned into wailing-places and houses of mourning, but, as the primitive Fathers called them, \"Cemeteries,\" that is, resting and sleeping places.  We sing, withal, beside our dead and over their graves, no dirges nor lamentations, but comforting songs of the forgiveness of sins, of rest, sleep, live and resurrection of the departed believers, for the strengthening of our faith, and the stirring up of the people to a true devotion.  For it is meet and right to give care and honor to the burial of the dead, in a manner worthy of that blessed article of our creed, the resurrection of the dead, and to the spite of that dreadful enemy, death, who doth so shamefully and continually prey upon us, in every horrid way and shape. Accordingly, as we read, the holy patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and the rest, kept their burials with great pomp, and ordered them with much diligence; and afterwards the kings of Judah held splendid ceremonials over the dead, with costly incense of all manner of precious herbs, thereby to hide the offense and shame of death, and acknowledge and glorify the resurrection of the dead, and so to comfort the weak in faith and the sorrowful. In like manner, even down to this present, have Christians ever been wont to do honorably by the bodies and the graves of the dead, decorating them, singing beside them and adorning them with monuments. Of all importance is that doctrine of the resurrection, that we be firmly grounded therein; for it is our lasting, blessed, eternal comfort and joy, against death, hell, the devil and all sorrow of heart. As a good example of what should be used for this end, we have taken the sweet music or melodies which under popish rule are in use at wakes, funerals and masses for the dead, some of which we have printed in this little book; and it is in our thought, as time shall serve, to add others to them, or have this done by more competent hands. But we have set other words thereto, such as shall adorn our doctrine of the resurrection, not that of purgatory with its pains and expiations, whereby the dead may neither sleep nor rest. The notes and melodies are of great price; it were pity to let them perish; but the words to them were unchristian and uncouth, so let these perish.  It is just as in other matters they do greatly excel us, having splendid rites of worship, magnificent convents and abbeys; but the preachings and doctrines heard therein do for the most part serve the devil and dishonor God; who nevertheless is Lord and God over all the earth, and should have of everything the fairest, best and noblest. Likewise have they costly shrines of gold and silver, and images set with gems and jewels; but within are dead men's bones, as foul and corrupt as in any charnel-house. So also have they costly vestments, chasubles, palliums, copes, hoods, mitres, but what are they that be clothed therewithal? slow- bellies, evil wolves, godless swine, persecuting and dishonoring the word of God.Just in the same way have they much noble music, especially in the abbeys and parish churches, used to adorn most vile, idolatrous words. Wherefore we have undressed these idolatrous, lifeless, crazy words, stripping off the noble music, and putting it upon the living and holy word of God, wherewith to sing, praise and honor the same, that so the beautiful ornament of music, brought back to its right use, may serve its blessed Maker and his Christian people; so that he shall be praised and glorified, and that we by his holy word impressed upon the heart with sweet songs, be builded up and confirmed in the faith. Hereunto help us God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Amen.  Yet is it not our purpose that these precise notes be sung in all the churches. Let each church keep its own notes according to its book and use. For I myself do not listen with pleasure in cases where the notes to a hymn or a _respon- sorium_ have been changed, and it is sung amongst us in a different way from what I have been used to from my youth. The main point is the correcting of the words, not of the music.  [Then follow selections of Scripture recommended as suitable for epitaphs.]    Luther's Third Preface.  To the Hymn-book printed at Wittenberg by Joseph Klug, 1543. There are certain who, by their additions to our hymns, have clearly shown that they far excel me in this matter, and may well be called my masters. But some, on the other hand, have added little of value. And inasmuch as I see that there is no limit to this perpetual amending by every one indiscriminately according to his own liking, so that the earliest of our hymns are more perverted the more they are printed, I am fearful that it will fare with this little book as it has ever fared with good books, that through tampering by incompetent hands it may get to be so overlaid and spoiled that the good will be lost out of it, and nothing be kept in use but the worthless.  We see in the first chapter of St. Luke that in the beginning every one wanted to write a gospel, until among the multitude of gospels the true Gospel was well-nigh lost. So has it been with the works of St. Jerome and St. Augustine, and with many other books. In short, there will always be tares sown among the wheat.  In order as far as may be to avoid this evil, I have once more revised this book, and put our own hymns in order by themselves with name attached, which formerly I would not do for reputation's sake, but am now constrained to do by necessity, lest strange and unsuitable songs come to be sold under our name. After these, are arranged the others, such as we deem good and useful.  I beg and beseech all who prize God's pure word that henceforth without our knowledge and consent no further additions or alterations be made in this book of ours; and that when it is amended without our"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/417"],["title","Dr. Martin Luther's Deutsche Geistliche Lieder (#4)"],["body","edge, it be fully understood to be not our book published at Wittenberg. Every man can for himself make his own hymn-book, and leave this of ours alone without additions; as we here beg, beseech and testify. For we like to keep our coin up to our own standard, debarring no man from making better for himself. Now let God's name alone be praised, and our name not sought. Amen.    Luther's Fourth Preface  To Valentine Bapst's Hymn-book, Leipzig, 1545. The xcvi Psalm saith: \"Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth.\" The service of God in the old dispensation, under the law of Moses, was hard and wearisome. Many and divers sacrifices had men to offer, of all that they possessed, both in house and in field, which the people, being idle and covetous, did grudgingly or for some temporal advantage; as the prophet Malachi saith, chap. i., \"who is there even among you that would shut the doors for naught? neither do ye kindle fires on my altars for naught.\" But where there is such an idle and grudging heart there can be no singing, or at least no singing of any good. Cheerful and merry must we be in heart and mind, when we would sing. Therefore hath God suffered such idle and grudging service to perish, as he saith further: \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of Hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand: for from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered in my name and a pure offering; for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of Hosts.\"  So that now in the New Testament there is a better service, whereof the psalm speaketh: \"Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord all the earth.\" For God hath made our heart and mind joyful through his dear Son whom he hath given for us to redeem us from sin, death and the devil. Who earnestly believes this cannot but sing and speak thereof with joy and delight, that others also may hear and come. But whoso will not speak and sing thereof, it is a sign that he doth not believe it, and doth not belong to the cheerful New Testament but to the dull and joyless Old Testament.  Therefore it is well done on the part of the printers that they are diligent to print good hymns, and make them agreeable to the people with all sorts of embellishments, that they may be won to this joy in believing and gladly sing of it. And inasmuch as this edition of Valtin Bapst [Pope] is prepared in fine style, God grant that it may bring great hurt and damage to that Roman _Bapst_ who by his accursed, intolerable and abominable ordinances has brought nothing into the world but wailing, mourning and misery. Amen. I must give notice that the song which is sung at funerals,  \"Nun lasst uns den Leib begraben,\"  which bears my name is not mine, and my name is henceforth not to stand with it. Not that I reject it, for I like it very much, and it was made by a good poet, Johannes Weis* by name, only a little visionary about the Sacrament; but I will not appropriate to myself another man's work. Also in the _De Profundis_, read thus:  Des muss _dich_ fuerchten jedermann.  Either by mistake or of purpose this is printed in most books  Des muss _sich_ fuerchten jedermann.  _Ut timearis_. The Hebrew reading is as in Matthew xv.: \"In vain do they fear me teaching doctrines of men.\"  See also Psalms xiv. and liii.: \"They call not on the Lord; there feared they where no fear was.\" That is, they may have much show of humiliation and bowing and bending in worship where I will have no worship. Accordingly this is the meaning in the place: Since forgiveness of sins is nowhere else to be found but only with thee, so must they let go all idolatry,  and come with a willing heart bowing and bending before thee, creeping up to the cross, and have thee alone in honor, and take refuge in thee, and serve thee, as living by thy grace and not by their own righteousness, etc.  *Luther's mistake for _Michael Weysse_, author of a Moravian hymn-book of 1531.    A Preface to All Good Hymn-Books. By Dr. Martin Luther.  From Joseph Klug's Hymn-Book, Wittenberg, 1543.  _Lady Musick Speaketh._  Of all the joys that are on earth Is none more dear nor higher worth, Than what in my sweet songs is found And instruments of various sound.  Where friends and comrades sing in tune, All evil passions vanish soon; Hate, anger, envy, cannot stay, All gloom and heartache melt away; The lust of wealth, the cares that cling, Are all forgotten while we sing.  Freely we take our joy herein, For this sweet pleasure is no sin, But pleaseth God far more, we know, Than any joys the world can show; The Devil's work it doth impede, And hinders many a deadly deed.  Se fared it with King Saul of old; When David struck his harp of gold, So sweet and clear its tones rang out, Saul's murderous thoughts were put to rout.  The heart grows still when I am heard, And opens to God's Truth and Word; So are we by Elisha taught, Who on the harp the Spirit sought.  The best time of the year is mine, When all the little birds combine To sing until the earth and air Are filled with sweet sounds everywhere; And most the tender nightingale Makes joyful every wood and dale, Singing her love-song o'er and o'er, For which we thank her evermore.  But yet more thanks are due from us To the dear Lord who made her thus, A singer apt to touch the heart, Mistress of all my dearest art. To God she sings by night and day, Unwearied, praising Him alway; Him I, too, laud in every song, To whom all thanks and praise belong.  _Translation by_ CATHARINE WINKWORTH.    A Warning by Dr. Martin Luther.  Viel falscher Meister itzt Lieder tichten Sihe dich fuer und lern sie recht richten Wo Gott hin bawet sein Kirch und sein wort Da will der Cenfel sein mit trug und mord.  _Wittenberg,_ 1543; _Leipzig,_ 1545  False masters now abound, who songs indite; Beware of them, and learn to judge them right: Where God builds up his Church and Word, hard by Satan is found with murder and a lie.  _Translation by_ R. MASSIE    I. Nun freut euch, lieben Christen g'mein. Dear Christians, one and all rejoice.  _A Song of Thanksgiving for the great Benefits which God in Christ has mainifested to us._  FIRST MELODY, _Wittenberg,_ 1524. _Harmony by_ H. SCHEIN, 1627. SECOND MELODY, _Wittenberg,_ 1535. _Harmony by_ M. PRAETORIUS, 1610.  1. Dear Christians, one and all rejoice, With exultation springing, And with united heart and voice And holy rapture singing, Proclaim the wonders God hath done, How his right arm the victory won; Right dearly it hath cost him.  2. Fast bound in Satan's chains I lay, Death brooded darkly o'er me; Sin was my torment night and day, Therein my mother bore me. Deeper and deeper still I fell, Life was become a living hell, So firmly sin possessed me.  3. My good works could avail me naught, For they with sin were stained; Free-will against God's judgment fought, And dead to good remained. Grief drove me to despair, and I Had nothing left me but to die, To hell I fast was sinking.  4. God saw, in his eternal grace, My sorrow out of measure; He thought upon his tenderness- To save was his good pleasure. He turn'd to me a Father's heart- Not small the cost - to heal my smart He have his best and dearest.  5. He spake to his beloved Son: 'Tis time to take compassion; Then go, bright jewel of my crown, And bring to man salvation; From sin and sorrow set him free, Slay bitter death for him, that he May live with thee forever.  6. The Son delighted to obey, And born of Virgin mother, Awhile on this low earth did stay That he might be my brother. His mighty power he hidden bore, A servant's form like mine he wore, To bind the devil captive.  7. To me he spake: cling fast to me, Thou'lt win a triumph worthy; I wholly give myself for thee; I strive and wrestle for thee; For I am thine, thou mine also; And where I am thou art. The foe Shall never more divide us.  8. For he shall shed my precious blood, Me of my life bereaving; All this I suffer for thy good; Be steadfast and believing. My life from death the day shall win, My righteousness shall bear thy sin, So art thou blest forever.  9. Now to my Father I depart, From earth to heaven ascending; Thence heavenly wisdom to impart, The Holy Spirit sending. He shall in trouble comfort thee, Teach thee to know and follow me, And to the truth conduct thee.  10. What I have done and taught, do thou To do and teach endeavor; So shall my kingdom flourish now, And God be praised forever. Take heed lest men with base alloy The heavenly treasure should destroy. This counsel I bequeath thee.   1. Nun freut euch, lieben Christen g'mein, Und lasst uns froehlich springen, Dass wir getrost und all in ein Mit Lust und Liebe singen: Was Gott an uns gewendet hat, Und seine suesse Wunderthat, Gar theur hat er's erworben.  2. Dem Teufel ich gefangen lag, Im Tod war ich verloren, Mein' Suend' mich quaelet Nacht und Tag, Darin war ich geboren, Ich fiel auch immer tiefer d'rein, Es war kein gut's am Leben mein, Die Suend' hat mich besessen.  3.

Da jammert's Gott in Ewigkeit Mein Elend ueber Massen, Er dacht' an sein' Barmherzigkeit, Er wollt' mir helfen lassen; Er wandt' zu mir das Vaterherz, Es war bei ihm fuerwahr kein Scherz, Er liess sein Bestes kosten.  5. Er sprach zu seinem lieben Sohn: Die Zeit ist hier zu 'rbarmen, Fahr' hin mein's Herzens werthe Kron' Und sei das Heil dem Armen, Und hilf ihm aus der Suenden Noth, Erwuerg' fuer ihn den bittern Tod Und lass' ihn mit dir leben.  6.
