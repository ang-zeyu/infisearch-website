From that moment on the battle was as irretrievably joined as one of those old Spanish knife-duels in which the opponents were locked together in a room to fight to a finish. Often as not, so they say, the victor in one of these fights only survived the loser by minutes or hours, and so would it have been in this instance had they not finally been able to extinguish the fire on the _Carmania_.  \"G----'s account of the way he had to carry on after being driven from the bridge--it was really a splendid bit of seamanship--was funny in the extreme, but the reality must have been funnier still, that is, if that term can be applied to anything happening while shells are bursting and blowing men to bits every few seconds. G---- is one of the biggest men in the Navy--around the waist, I mean--so it wasn't to be expected of him to be very shifty on his feet. And yet, by the irony of Fate, it was he of all men who was suddenly confronted with a task that required only less 'foot-work' than it did 'head-work.' With the battle going on all the time, they rigged up some sort of a 'jury' steering gear, or it may be that they steered her by her screws. At any rate, G---- had to con her from the most commanding position he could find on one of the after decks, or rather, as he had no longer voice-pipe communication with the engine-room, he had to keep dashing back and forth (it must have been for all the world like a batsman running in cricket) between two or three commanding positions. 'If I wanted to open the range a bit,' he said, 'I had to nip for'ard, wait till there was an interval in both gun-fire and shell-burst, and yell down a hatchway' (or was it a ventilator?) 'to the engine-room to \"Slow port!\" or if I suddenly found it imperative to open the distance, I had to make the same journey and pass the word down to \"Stop starboard!\" The very thought of that mad shuttling back and forth under the equatorial sun used to make poor G---- mop his forehead and pour himself a fresh drink every time he told the story.  \"Battered and burning fiercely as both ships were, G---- confessed that even at this juncture he could not rid himself of the feeling that neither of them had enough shells to sink the other. 'I was racking my brain for some plan of action to follow when that moment arrived,' he said, 'when suddenly the _Trafalgar_ began to heel sharply and started to sink. It was our second or third salvo, which had holed her badly at the water-line, that did the business. She had kept steaming and fighting for close to an hour and a quarter afterwards, though.'  \"G---- told us one very good story about his Gunnery officer. 'It was just before the shell which started the fire struck us,' he said, 'that Y----'s sun helmet was knocked off--I don't remember whether it was by the wind or the concussion of the firing. Seeing it fall to the deck below, he ran to the rail of the bridge and began shouting for some one to bring it back to him. Before long, luckily, a seaman who had heard the shouting in a lull of the firing, poked his head out to see what it was about, and presently came puffing up the ladder with the fugitive head-piece. I say _luckily_, because the gun-control for the whole ship was suspended while Y---- waited for that infernal helmet. And the funniest thing about it all was that, when I ventured to suggest a few days later that it might be well if he made use of the chin-strap of his helmet the next time he was in action, he claimed to have no recollection whatever of the incident--thought he had been \"sticking to his guns\" all the time. Just shows how a man's brain works in air-tight compartments when he is really busy.'  \"The Surgeon of the _Carmania_ (continued the Captain)--a splendid chap who had given up a lucrative West-end practice and sworn he was under forty (although he was really fifty-two) in order to get a chance to do something for his country--told me many stories to prove the splendid spirit of the men that passed under his hands during and after the fight. Though most of the crew were only Royal Naval Reservists, with no experience of and but little training for fighting, it appears that they stood what is perhaps the hardest of all trials--that of seeing their mates wounded and killed beside them--like seasoned veterans.  \"'There was one stout-hearted young Cockney,' said the Surgeon, 'whom, after I had finished removing a number of shell fragments from various parts of his anatomy, I asked what he thought of the fight. \"Rippin', Sir,\" he replied, grinning ecstatically through the bandage that held up the flap of a torn cheek; \"rippin', never been in one like it before.\" Then, as his eye caught the smile which I could not quite repress at the lifetime of naval battling suggested by that \"nev'r afore,\" he concluded with \"Not ev'n in Whitechapel.\"'  \"The Surgeon came across one man who insisted that the blood flowing from a ragged tear in his arm was really spattered there when one of his mates--whose mangled body he bestrode--had been decapitated by a shell a few minutes before; and there was one lot of youngsters who went on cheerily 'Yo-heave-ho-ing' in hoisting some badly needed shells which were so slippery with blood that they had to be sanded before they could be handled. Grimly pathetic was the story he told me of a gunner whose torn hand he had just finished amputating and bandaging when some one shouted into the door of the dressing station that the _Trafalgar_ was going down.  \"'He crowded to a port I had had opened,' said the Surgeon, 'just in time to see one of the last salvoes from the _Carmania_ go crashing into the side of the heeling enemy. \"Huroor, boys,\" he shouted; \"give 'em beans,\" and as he cheered he started (what had evidently been a favourite gesture of approval and excitement with him) to smite mightily with his right fist into the palm of his left hand. But the blow fell upon air; there was no answering thwack. The gnarled, weather-beaten fist shot past a bandaged stump. He drew back with surprise for a moment, and then, grinning a bit sheepishly, like a boy surprised in some foolish action, edged back beside me at the port. \"Quite forgot there was su'thin' missin',\" he said half apologetically, trying to wriggle the elbow of the maimed arm back into the sling from which it had slipped. \"S'pose I'll be havin' to get used to it, won't I?\" As the _Trafalgar_ took a new list and began rapidly to settle he burst into renewed \"Huroors.\" \"By Gawd, Sir,\" he cried, when she had finally gone, \"if I 'ad as many 'ands as an oktypuss, I'd 'a giv'n 'em all fer the joy o' puttin' that blinkin' pyrit down to Davy Jones.\"'\"  The Captain gazed long at the coals of the grate, on his face the pleased smile of one who recalls treasured memories. \"I can't tell you how sorry we were to see the _Carmania_ go,\" he said finally. \"My word, how we _did_ enjoy those feasts good old G---- spread for us!\" With a laugh he roused himself from the pleasant reverie and took up again the narrative of the _Cornwall_.  \"The first intimation we had\" (he resumed) \"of the sinking of Admiral Craddock's fleet came in the form of a wireless from the _Defence_ asking if I had heard of the disaster at Coronel. Details which came in the course of the next day or two brought home to us the astonishing change in the whole situation which the appearance of Von Spee in South American waters had wrought. The blow fell like a bolt from the blue.  \"As rapidly as possible the various British warships in the South Atlantic rendezvoused off Montevideo to discuss a plan of action. What the next move of the victorious Von Spee would be we could only surmise. German prisoners picked up after the Falklands battle said his ultimate plan--after seizing Port Stanley for a base, and undergoing such a refit there as was practicable with the means at his disposal--was to scatter his ships as commerce raiders all over the Atlantic, cutting, if possible, the main sea arteries of England to North America. The Germans figured, according to these prisoners, that the suspension of the North Atlantic traffic for even a month (no impossible thing for five speedy cruisers in the light of the delays to sailings caused by the _Emden_ and _Karlsruhe_ working alone) would practically paralyse England's war efforts and reduce her military effort in France to almost negligible proportions. I am much more inclined to believe that this--rather than escorting a fleet of German merchantmen, bearing German reservists from Argentina, Uruguay, and Southern Brazil, to South-West Africa from Buenos Aires and Montevideo--was the real plan of Von Spee.  However, it was the immediate rather than the ultimate plans of the Germans that was our chief--in fact, our only--concern. Whether Von Spee intended heading for the North Atlantic later or South Africa, or up the Thames--the only way he could clear the road to any of these objectives was by first destroying such British warships as still remained in South American waters. It was these ships which had hurried to get together off Montevideo, in order to make the path of the enemy as thorny and full of pitfalls as possible.  \"They had no illusions respecting what the immediate future held for them, that little group of cruiser captains that gathered in the Admiral's cabin of the _Defence_ to formulate a plan of action. We knew nothing at that time of what had been decided upon at the Admiralty; indeed, we were quite in agreement that it would be deemed inexpedient to send any battle cruisers away from the North Sea, where they might be imperatively needed any day, on a voyage to the South Atlantic that might easily resolve itself into a months'-long wild-goose chase. Our plans, therefore, were laid entirely on the assumption "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42604"],["title","Stories of the Ships (#3)"],["body","we should have to do the best we could with the ships already available.  \"There was not a man of us who was not keen on the chance of a fight at even the prohibitive odds under which it appeared inevitable that the one ahead of us must be fought, but the prospects of success were anything but alluring. Every day that passed had brought reports revealing the completeness of the enemy's victory at Coronel, and all of these were more than confirmed when the _Glasgow_--whose captain had had the good sense to retire from a battle in which there was no longer a chance for him to be of any use--came in and joined us.  \"It would be easy to suggest conditions under which one naval force, faced by another as much stronger than itself as the Germans were than the British at this time, would be justified in avoiding an action. The present was not such an occasion, however; in fact, I don't think it ever occurred to any of us to bring up a discussion of that phase of the question at all. This, briefly, was the way the matter presented itself to us: The measure of the power of the Germans to inflict harm to the Allies was their supply of shells. These gone--always provided no new supply reached them--the menace, even though the ships were yet unsunk, was practically at an end. We knew that they had already used up a considerable quantity of their munition in a foolish bombardment of the little tropical port of Papeete, in the French Societies, and we knew that a very large amount had been expended at Coronel. They still probably had enough, we figured, to see them through many months of commerce raiding if only they could avoid another general action against warships, and such an action, even if it was a losing one from our standpoint, it was our manifest rôle to provoke, and at the earliest possible moment.  \"This point decided, about all that remained to be considered was how to make the most effective disposition of such ships as we had at our disposal when once the enemy was in sight. We knew just what ships we would have to meet. We also knew, practically to a gun, how they were armed. Moreover, with Coronel as an object lesson, we knew how well those ships were handled, and with what deadly effectiveness those guns were served. Now that it is all ancient history, I think there is no reason why I should not tell you how we arranged that our ships should 'take partners' for the little 'sea-dance' they were expecting to shake their heels at.  \"The _Defence_--an armoured cruiser of the _Minotaur_ type, subsequently sunk at Jutland--was to tackle the _Scharnhorst_, Von Spee's flagship. The former was the only ship we had that was anywhere nearly a match for either of the larger German cruisers. She exceeded them in displacement by several thousand tons, and her four nine-point-twos and ten seven-point-fives had a comfortable margin of metal over that fired from the _Scharnhorst's_ eight eight-point-twos and six five-point-nines. In a fair duel with either of the larger Germans, I think there is little doubt she would have had the best of it. In the battle we expected to go into, however, there could be no certainty that she was going to be able to give her undivided attention to the _vis-à-vis_ we had picked for her during a sufficient interval to finish up the job.  \"The _Carnarvon_ and the _Cornwall_ were to be given the formidable task of keeping the _Gneisenau_ so busy that she could not help her sister fight the _Defence_. Our combined displacement was about equal to that of our prospective opponent, but the four seven-point-fives and twenty six-inch (all we had between us) could hardly have prevented her pounding us to pieces with her eight-point-twos, in the event that she elected to use her speed to keep beyond the effective range of our lighter guns. By dashing into close range we might have had a chance with her, or, again there was the possibility we might lead her a dance that would take her out of the way long enough to give the _Defence_ time to finish polishing off the _Scharnhorst_, in which event the former might have been able to intervene in our favour.  \"Small as would have been our chance of carrying through our part of the programme successfully, the _Gneisenau_ was the one opponent I desired above all the others, on account of the way I knew it would buck up the ship's company to feel that they were having a whack at the ship that sunk the _Monmouth_. There were a good many men in the _Monmouth_ who had gone to her from the _Cornwall_, and our men never tired cursing the Hun for letting their mates drown at Coronel without making any effort to save them. They had something to say on that score when their turn came at the Falklands.  \"The _Glasgow_ we were going to give a chance to wipe out her Coronel score by sending her in against the _Nürnberg_. With her superior speed, and her two six-inch and ten four-inch guns against the latter's ten four-point ones, she would probably have had the best of what could not but have been a very pretty fight if no one had interfered with it. Here again, unluckily, the chances were against a duel to the finish. Against the _Dresden_--a very worthy sister of the _Emden_--the very best we could muster was the armed merchantman, _Orama_. This (unless another armed merchantman--the _Otranto_, which had escaped with the _Glasgow_ from Coronel--became available) left us nothing to oppose to the _Leipzig_, which, in that event, would have been a sort of a 'rover,' free to bestow her attention and shells wherever they appeared likely to do the most harm. And (from the way she was fought at the Falklands, where she was my 'opposite number') let me tell you that a jolly troublesome 'rover' she would have been.  \"That, in a few words, was our little plan for making Von Spee use up the remainder of his ammunition. That was our principal object, and there can be no doubt that we would have come pretty near complete success in attaining it. For the rest, you can judge for yourself what our chances would have been. As the Fates would have it, however, that battle was never to be fought, save on paper in the Admiral's cabin of the old _Defence_. Before ever we had completed preparations for our 'magazine-emptying' sally against Von Spee, word was winged to us that the Admiralty had a plan of its own in process of incubation, and that we were to standby to co-operate.  \"Sturdee and his battle cruisers were well on their way to the South Atlantic, however, before even an inkling of what was afoot was vouchsafed us, and even then my orders were simply to rendezvous with him at the 'Base' I have spoken of before--the one where we foregathered and feasted with the _Carmania_. I breathed no word of where and why we were going until the muddy waters of the Plate estuary were left behind and the last least possibility of a 'leak' to the shore was out of the question. Then I simply passed it on to the men by posting some word of it on the notice-board. There was no cheering, either then or even a few days later, when the _Inflexible_ and the _Invincible_, the latter flying Admiral Sturdee's flag, came nosing in from the Atlantic and dropped anchor at the 'Base'; but the promise of action in the immediate future was like wine to the men. They were simply tumbling over themselves to carry out the most ordinary routine duties, and so it continued right up to the moment that Von Spee's foretops, gliding along above the low promontory of Port William, brought them to 'Action Stations' with real work to do at last.  \"Sturdee had his plans all laid, and we repaired to the _Invincible_ shortly after her arrival to familiarise ourselves with them. All in all, it wasn't so very different a gathering as that one which took place on the _Defence_, off Montevideo, to plan another battle--the one which was never to take place. I don't mind admitting though, that there was a bit more 'buoyancy' to the atmosphere of this second conference, the natural consequence of our 'improved prospects.' There is no use denying that it gives a man a more comfortable feeling to know that he is in a ship that has reasonable expectation of sending its 'opposite' to the bottom of the sea, than to be faced with the prospect of going out as a sort of animated lure to wheedle the enemy out of his shells.  \"With the _Invincible_ and _Inflexible_ Sturdee had sufficient force to be able to dispense with the _Defence_, which was, I believe, sent to African water to join a force that was gathering there on the off-chance that the Germans slipped through the net that was being flung off South America. For scouting purposes, the _Bristol_ and the _Kent_--both of which had foregathered with us at the 'Base'--were added to our 'punitive expedition,' which finally got under weigh for the Falklands on November 28. Steaming in a formation best calculated to sweep a wide range of seas, we held our southerly course for nine days, sighting, so far as I recall, no ship of any description except those of our own force. On the eighth day we weathered a heavy blizzard, but it was out of a clear dawn that the low, rounded hills of the Falklands--so suggestive in many respects of the Orkneys and the north of Scotland--took shape the following morning. We dropped anchor in the double harbour of Port William and Port Stanley at nine o'clock of the forenoon of December 7. Before another twenty-four hours had passed Von Spee--hurrying as though to a rendezvous--had made his appearance, and we were raising steam to go out and even up Craddock's account with him.\"   II. THE BATTLE OF THE FALKLANDS  The Captain had come for a breath of fresh air on the quarter-deck at the end of a grey winter's day, and it was the memories called up by the resemblance of the low, rounded, treeless hills which ringed the Northern Base to some other hills which he had good reason to carry a vivid mental picture of that set him talking of the Falklands.  \"They're"]]]
