Then he lit an oil lamp, which presently burned up and illumined the room. They found themselves in what to all intents and purposes was a library.  The four walls were stacked with books, but the overflow of these was so great that many were piled upon chairs and in odd corners of the room. In the centre of the floor-space was a large writing-desk, and near this a cabinet with several drawers.  Lying open on the writing-desk was a fair-sized cash-box, in which several golden sovereigns glittered in the light.  \"How careless, to be sure!\" exclaimed the Judge.  \"I had no business to leave my cash-box open.  The truth is, I was so excited about this discovery that I forgot to put it away.\"  \"And where’s the Sunstone?\" asked von Hardenberg.  \"I keep it here,\" said Mr. Langton.  Going to the cabinet, and unlocking the third drawer from the top, he took out a large stone and laid it on the table in the light of the lamp.  His two nephews, one on either side of him, leaned forward to examine this extraordinary relic.  On one side of the Sunstone were the cuneiform characters already mentioned by the Judge.  On the other was a great deal of writing in the same primitive language, scratched upon the face of the jade, but so faint as to be barely legible.  \"It was only with the greatest difficulty,\" observed the Judge, \"that I managed to decipher and translate this writing.  It is in no known language.  Indeed, I would never have been able to make head or tail of it had I not been a scholar of Sanskrit.  This writing is nothing more nor less than the definite instructions for using the Sunstone for the purpose of entering the vaults of Zoroaster.\"  \"What does it say?\" asked von Hardenberg.  \"You are told to begin with a certain character and take the others in a circle ’in the way of the sun’—that is to say, from left to right, as with the hands of a clock.  Before the main vault is a large lock, which works on the same principle as the modern Bramah lock—a very ancient device.  It consists of nine enormous wheels.  The outside, or tyre, of each of these wheels is adorned with hundreds of cuneiform characters, all of them quite different.  Each wheel must be turned until the characters visible along a given line correspond with those upon the Sunstone.  Not otherwise can the vault be opened.\"  There followed a silence of several moments.  The Judge’s discovery seemed so romantic and so astonishing that it was almost impossible to believe it was true.  After a while, it was von Hardenberg who spoke.  \"And now that you have made this discovery,\" he asked, \"what do you propose to do?\"  \"I don’t know,\" said the Judge.  \"I have no desire to pillage a sacred shrine.  For the present I propose to keep the affair a secret whilst I continue my researches.  There are several points upon which the historical world desires to be enlightened.  Very little is known concerning the life of Zoroaster.\"  \"But surely,\" exclaimed von Hardenberg, \"you don’t intend to keep this to yourself!\"  \"When I have the whole facts of the case at my finger-tips,\" said the Judge, \"I will make the result of my investigations known to the authorities of the British Museum.\"  Soon after that they left the bungalow.  Before they went to bed that night von Hardenberg took his cousin aside and looked at him intently.  \"What do you make of it?\" he asked.  \"Of the Sunstone?\" asked Harry.  \"Yes,\" said the other.  \"It seems to me, if the old gentleman wanted to, he could make himself a millionaire.\"  Harry laughed.  \"I don’t think Uncle Jack cares much about money,\" said he.  \"He looks at the whole matter from a scientific point of view.\"  \"No doubt,\" exclaimed the Prussian.  \"No doubt.  I dare say he does.\"  And at that he turned and went slowly up the stairs.     CHAPTER III—Caught Red-handed   Some hours after sunset, on the evening of the following day, Jim Braid was stationed in the woods, on the look-out for poachers.  His father, John Braid, the head-gamekeeper, was also out that night, keeping watch in a different part of the estate.  A well-known gang of poachers had been reported in the district, and, the week before, several shots had been heard as late as twelve o’clock, for which the gamekeepers could not account.  The night was cold and foggy, and Jim wore the collar of his coat turned up, and carried his gun under his arm, with his hands thrust deep into his breeches pockets.  He was moving along the edge of the coverts, which lay between Mr. Langton’s bungalow and the house, when suddenly he became conscious of footsteps approaching stealthily through the woods.  Without a moment’s thought he dropped flat upon his face, and lay close as a hare, concealed in a clump of bracken.  From this position he was able to see the path by which the intruder approached; he could also command a view of the windows of Friar’s Court, several of which were illumined.  The dark figure of a man came from among the trees.  Jim, taking his whistle from his pocket, put it to his lips, and was about to sound the alarm which would bring his father and the other keepers to the spot, when he was arrested by the man’s singular appearance.  This was no common poacher.  He wore a heavy fur overcoat, and carried in his hand—not a gun—but no more formidable a weapon than an umbrella.  On his head, tilted at an angle, was a white bowler hat.  Jim Braid was in two minds what to do, and was even about to show himself to the stranger and ask his business, when the front door of the house opened, and he made out the figure of Captain von Hardenberg silhouetted against the light in the hall.  Jim had no particular desire to eavesdrop.  Still, as we know, he disliked and mistrusted the Prussian; and, besides, the secretive manner in which the stranger was careful to keep in the shadow of the trees had already aroused his suspicions.  When the man with the white hat saw von Hardenberg, he whistled softly, and went forward a little towards him.  They met a few yards from where Jim Braid was hiding.  The stranger at once held out a hand.  Von Hardenberg refused to take it.  \"I knew you’d come here,\" said he.  \"Can’t you leave me alone?\"  \"You’re four months overdue, Captain von Hardenberg,\" answered the other.  \"My interest is increasing day by day.  You owe me nearly four thousand pounds!\"  \"Well, I can’t pay,\" said von Hardenberg.  \"And there’s an end of it.\"  \"Captain von Hardenberg,\" said the man, who spoke English with a strong German accent.  \"I am sick of you.  In a word, I have found you out. You desire the services of a spy—one who has access to valuable information—and you come to me, Peter Klein, even myself, who as the butler of a cabinet minister have many opportunities of reading letters and overhearing the consultations of those who are suppose to govern these sleepy, fog-begotten islands.  You are paid from Berlin, and you are paid to pay me.  And what do you do with the money?  Gamble.  In a word, you play cards and lose money which by right is mine, which I—not you—have earned.  Then you beseech me to hold my tongue, promising me that you will repay me with interest as soon as ever you have inherited your uncle’s estates.  This, I find, is a lie.  Your uncle has another nephew, just as likely to inherit his capital as you. You play with me. But I hold you in the hollow of my hand.  Remember, I have only to report you to Berlin, and you are ruined, once and for all.\"  Von Hardenberg was silent for some moments.  Then he spoke in a quick, jerky voice.  \"Look here,\" said he; \"it’s no good.  This very evening, knowing that you were coming, I made a clean breast of it to my uncle.  I told him that I was four thousand pounds in debt to a money-lender, and that, if I couldn’t pay, you would come down upon me.  I suppose you don’t mind that.  I couldn’t tell him you were a Government spy disguised as a butler in a private house.  And what do you think he said?\"  \"I have not the least idea,\" said the other.  \"He told me,\" said von Hardenberg, \"that he would cut me off with a shilling!\"  Mr. Peter Klein was heard to gasp.  Thrusting his hat well back upon his head, he threw out his hands and gesticulated wildly.  \"Then, you’re a thief!\" he cried.  \"What it comes to is this: you have embezzled Government money.  I have given the Wilhelmstrasse valuable information, and I have never received a penny.\"  \"Do what you like,\" answered von Hardenberg.  \"I cannot pay.\"  \"I’ll have you court-martialled!\" the other cried.  \"The Wilhelmstrasse will be on my side.  You have made a fool of me.\"  Von Hardenberg grasped the man by the wrist.  \"Listen here,\" said he.  \"Can you wait a week?\"  \"Yes.  I can.  But why?\"  \"Because I know how I can get hold of the money, though it will take some getting.  You had better go back to London.  I promise to call at your office within a few days, and then I shall have something to tell you.\"  Peter Klein turned the matter over in his mind.  As long as there remained a chance of getting his money he thought it worth while to take it.  For all his threats, he knew enough of the Secret Service department in the Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin to know that in a fight against a Prussian military attaché he would stand but a poor chance. However, he was cunning enough to point out to von Hardenberg that the Wilhelmstrasse might think that the services of Peter Klein might possibly be valuable in the future.  Then, he went his way, walking quickly through the woods in the direction of the railway station.  As for von Hardenberg, he returned to the house; and no sooner was he gone than Jim Braid got to his feet.  The young gamekeeper had been able to understand only a third of what had been said, for they had lapsed from German into English, and back to German again.  But, that night—or, rather, early the following morning—when he went to bed, he thought over the matter for some time, and had half a mind to tell his father.  However, in the end he came to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39185"],["title","Across the Cameroons: A Story of War and Adventure (#3)"],["body","that it was no business of his, and slept the sleep of the just.  The following afternoon he was engaged in driving into the ground a series of hurdles to keep the cattle from the pheasant coverts, when he was approached by Mr. Langton.  \"Hard at work, Jim?\" asked the Judge.  \"Yes, sir,\" said Jim, touching his cap.  \"These are the old hurdles we brought up from Boot’s Hollow.\"  \"That’s a useful weapon, anyhow,\" said the Judge, indicating the crowbar with which Jim was working.  \"Yes, sir, it’s a handy tool, and sharp in the bargain.\"  At that the Judge wished the boy \"Good-night!\" and went his way towards the house.  Hardly had he departed than Captain von Hardenberg brushed his way through some thickets near at hand, and approached the young gamekeeper.  He must certainly have overheard the conversation that had passed between Jim Braid and the Judge.  \"Braid,\" said he, \"would you mind lending me that crowbar?\"  \"I’ve finished with it to-night, sir,\" said Braid, \"but I shall want it to-morrow morning.\"  \"I’ll let you have it back by then,\" said the other.  And taking the unwieldy tool from Jim’s hands, he walked with it towards the house.  No sooner was he out of sight, however, than he dropped down upon a knee and looked furtively about him, as if to satisfy himself that he was not observed.  Then he thrust the crowbar down a rabbit-hole, the mouth of which he covered over with several fronds of bracken.  That done, he walked quickly towards the house.  That night, towards midnight, when everyone else in Friar’s Court was sound asleep, Captain Carl von Hardenberg sat, fully dressed, at the foot of his bed with a cigar between his lips.  He had taken off his dress-coat and put on an old Norfolk jacket.  On his feet he wore long gum-boots, into which he had tucked his trousers.  He sat looking at the clock, which was but dimly visible upon the mantelpiece through the clouds of tobacco-smoke with which the room was filled.  Presently the clock struck twelve, and at that von Hardenberg rose to his feet and went on tiptoe to the door.  Without a sound he passed out, walked quickly down the passage, and descended the back stairs to the kitchen.  With nervous hands he opened the scullery door, and then paused to listen.  Hearing no sound, he stepped quickly into the yard.  He walked rapidly past the lawns which lie between Friar’s Court and the woods.  Once inside the woods, he immediately sought out the path that led straight to the bungalow.  He had some difficulty in finding the rabbit-hole in which he had hidden the crowbar, and only succeeded in doing so with the aid of a lighted match.  It was the flare of this match that attracted Jim Braid, who was again on duty in this part of the estate.  Von Hardenberg, the crowbar in his hand, approached the bungalow.  With all his strength he drove the crowbar between the door and the jamb, and with one wrench broke open the lock.  In his uncle’s study he lit the oil lamp that stood upon the central table.  He was surprised to see that the Judge had again left his cash-box on the desk.  The cash-box, however, was not his business; he was determined to possess himself of the Sunstone.  He had provided himself with a bunch of skeleton keys.  Those whose business it is to employ Government spies are not infrequently provided with such things.  After several futile attempts he succeeded in opening the third drawer in the cabinet.  Then, with the precious stone in his hand, he rushed to the lamp and examined the Sunstone in the light.  \"Now,\" he cried—he was so excited that he spoke aloud—\"now for the German Cameroons!\"  And scarcely had he said the words than he looked up, and there in the doorway was Jim Braid, the gamekeeper’s son.  \"Hands up!\" cried Braid, bringing his gun to his shoulder.  Captain von Hardenberg looked about him like a hunted beast.  \"Don’t be a fool!\" he exclaimed.  \"You know who I am!\"  \"Yes, I do,\" said Braid; \"and you’re up to no good.  Hands up, I say!\"  Von Hardenberg held up his hands, and then tried to laugh it off.  \"You’re mad!\" said he more quietly.  \"Surely you don’t imagine I’m a thief?\"  \"I’m not given much to imagining things,\" said Braid.  \"All I know is, you broke in here by force.\"  As he was speaking, before the last words had left his mouth, von Hardenberg, with a quick and desperate action, had seized the gun by the barrel.  There followed a struggle, during which the gun went off.  There was a loud report and a piercing cry, and Jim Braid fell forward on his face.  Even as he rolled over upon the ground, a black pool of blood spread slowly across the floor.  The Prussian went to the door and listened.  He saw lights appear in the windows of the house, and one or two were thrown open.  Near at hand he heard the strong voice of John Braid, the keeper, shouting to his son. On the other side of the bungalow, an under-gamekeeper was hurrying to the place.  Von Hardenberg’s face was ashen white.  His hands were shaking, his lips moving with strange, convulsive jerks.  He went quickly to the body of the unconscious boy, and, kneeling down, felt Braid’s heart.  \"Thank Heaven,\" said he, \"he is not killed.\"  And then a new fear possessed him.  If Jim Braid was not dead, he would live to accuse von Hardenberg of the theft.  The Prussian stood bolt upright, his teeth fastened on his under lip.  The voices without were nearer to the house than before.  He had not ten seconds in which to act.  Seizing the cash-box, he laid it on the ground and dealt it a shivering blow with the crowbar.  The lid flew open, and the contents—a score of sovereigns—were scattered on the floor.  These he gathered together and thrust into the pockets of the unconscious boy.  Then he took the crowbar and closed Jim’s fingers about it.  It was at that moment that John Braid, the gamekeeper, burst into the room.  \"What’s this?\" he cried.  \"I regret to tell you,\" said Captain von Hardenberg, \"that your son is a thief.  I caught him red-handed.\"     CHAPTER IV—False Evidence   In less than a minute the bungalow was crowded.  Close upon the head-gamekeeper’s heels came one of his assistants, and after him Mr. Langton himself and Harry, followed by several servants from the house.  When John Braid heard von Hardenberg’s words, accusing his son of theft, it was as if a blow had been struck him.  He looked about him like a man dazed, and then carried a hand across his eyes.  Then, without a word, he went down upon his knees at his son’s side and examined the wounded boy.  \"He’s not dead,\" said he in a husky voice.  \"I can feel his heart distinctly.\"  It was at this moment that the Judge rushed into the room.  His bare feet were encased in bedroom slippers; he was dressed in a shirt and a pair of trousers.  \"Whatever has happened?\" he exclaimed.  He repeated the question several times before anyone answered, and by then the room was full.  The chauffeur was sent back post-haste to the stables, with orders to drive for a doctor.  \"How did it happen, John?\" repeated Mr. Langton.  But the gamekeeper shook his head.  He had the look of a man who is not completely master of his senses.  The Judge regarded his nephew.  \"Carl,\" said he, \"can you explain how this—accident occurred?\"  \"Certainly!\" said von Hardenberg, who now realized, that to save himself, all his presence of mind was necessary.  \"Then,\" said the Judge, \"be so good as to do so.\"  \"After my yesterday’s interview with you,\" von Hardenberg began, in tones of complete assurance, \"as you may imagine, I had several letters to write, and to-night I did not think of getting into bed till nearly twelve o’clock.  Before I began to undress I went to the window and opened it.  As I did so I saw a man cross the lawn and enter the woods. As his conduct was suspicious, I took him for a poacher.  As quickly as possible I left the house and walked in the direction I knew the man had taken.\"  \"Why did not you wake any of us?\" asked the Judge, who was in his own element, and might have been examining a witness in the box.  Von Hardenberg, however, did not appear to be the least alarmed.  He answered his uncle slowly, but without the slightest hesitation.  \"For the very simple reason,\" said he, \"that I did not wish to make a fool of myself.  I half expected that the man would prove to be a gamekeeper.\"  \"Then why did you follow him?\"  \"For two reasons.  First, because I wanted to satisfy myself as to who he was, and, secondly, because a man who has just learnt he is to remain a pauper for life does not, as a rule, feel inclined for sleep. I wanted to go out into the air.\"  \"Well,\" asked the Judge, \"and then what happened?\"  \"I was unable to find the man in the woods, until I heard a noise in the direction of the bungalow.  To the bungalow, accordingly I went, as quickly as I could.  I got there in time to see him break open the door with a crowbar.  There is the crowbar in his hand.\"  Everyone in the room caught his breath.  Such an accusation against Jim Braid was almost incomprehensible.  The boy was believed to be perfectly honest and trustworthy; and yet, as Captain von Hardenberg had said, there was the crowbar in his hand.  \"And then?\" prompted the judge.  \"And then,\" the Prussian continued, \"I watched him enter the room.  I could see him through the window.  He went straight to your desk, took the cash-box, and burst it open with the crowbar.  There is the box lying on the floor.  If you examine it, you will see that I speak the truth.\"  The judge picked up the box and looked at it.  \"You are prepared to swear to this?\" he asked.  \"In a court of law,\" said the other—and never flinched.  It was the Judge himself who emptied Jim’s pockets, and there sure enough he found the sovereigns which had been taken from the cash-box.  \"I would never have believed it!\" he exclaimed.  \"It’s terrible to think that one of my own servants should have treated me thus!\"  It was then that Harry Urquhart spoke for the first time.  He could not"]]]
