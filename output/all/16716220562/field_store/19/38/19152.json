Uncle,\" he pleaded, \"you don’t believe it, surely?\"  The Judge shook his head.  \"It would be very foolish for me,\" said he, \"to give an opinion one way or the other, before the boy has had a chance to speak in his own defence.  I must admit, however, that the evidence is very strong against him.\"  A hurdle was fetched, upon which a mattress was laid; and upon this the wounded boy was carried to the house, which was nearer to the bungalow than his father’s cottage.  By a strange coincidence, it was one of the very hurdles that Jim had been setting up that afternoon.  The doctor, who lived at some distance, did not arrive for an hour. After a short examination of the patient he was able to give a satisfactory report.  The gun had gone off at too close a range to allow the shot to scatter, and only about a quarter of the pellets had entered the boy’s side, the rest tearing a great hole in his coat and waistcoat. The wound was large and gaping, but no artery was touched, and before they reached the house, and Jim had been laid upon the bed in Harry’s room, the patient had recovered consciousness.  For all that, it was several days before the doctor would allow him to see anyone.  He was to be kept perfectly quiet, and not excited in any way.  During that time he was attended with the greatest care, not only by the housekeeper and Harry Urquhart, but by Mr. Langton himself.  At the end of a week, a naturally strong constitution, and the good health resulting from a life that is lived in the open air, had done their work, and Jim was allowed to get up.  It was soon after that that the Judge heard the case in his dining-room, where, seated at the head of the table, pen in hand, he might have been back in his old place in the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone.  Jim Braid—who, in very truth, was the prisoner in the dock—was seated on a chair, facing the Judge.  On either side of the table were those whom Mr. Langton proposed to call as witnesses—namely, Captain von Hardenberg, John Braid, and the under-gamekeeper.  The face of the prisoner in the dock was white as a sheet.  Harry Urquhart stood behind his uncle’s chair, regarding his old friend with commiseration in his eyes and a deep sympathy in his heart.  Von Hardenberg’s evidence differed in no material points from what he had said before.  Indeed, he played his cards with almost fiendish cunning.  The circumstantial evidence was all against the boy.  The Judge had not yet discovered that the Sunstone was missing.  There was no doubt that both the door of the bungalow and the cash-box had been broken open by the crowbar—moreover, the very crowbar which the Judge himself had seen in Jim’s hands on the afternoon of the crime.  Neither John Braid nor any other gamekeeper could do anything but bear out the testimony of von Hardenberg.  When they entered the bungalow the boy’s guilt had seemed manifest.  In his own defence Jim could state as much of the truth as he knew.  He said that he had seen von Hardenberg break into the bungalow; he swore that he had lent him the crowbar that very day.  Asked why he supposed the Judge’s nephew had become a burglar, he was unable to give an answer.  From his position he had not been able to see into the room; he had not the slightest idea what von Hardenberg did immediately after entering.  All this the Judge flatly refused to believe.  He protested that it was ridiculous to suppose that a young man of von Hardenberg’s position would rifle a cash-box, containing about twenty pounds.  In Mr. Langton’s opinion, the case was proved against the boy; he could not doubt that he was guilty.  He said that he would refrain from prosecuting, since John Braid had served him faithfully for many years, but he was unwilling any longer to employ Jim on the estate.  When Mr. Langton had finished, John Braid asked for permission to speak, and then turned upon his son with a savage fierceness that was terrible to see.  He disowned him; he was no longer a son of his.  He pointed out the benefits Jim had received at the hands of Mr. Langton, and swore that he had never dreamed that such ingratitude was possible. As far as he was concerned, he had done with his son, once and for all. He would blot out his memory.  Henceforward Jim could fend for himself.  Still weak from his wounds, and with a far greater pain in his heart than ever came from physical hurt, the boy rose to his feet and slowly and in silence left the room.  He went to his father’s cottage, and there saw his mother, from whom he parted in tears.  Then, shouldering the few belongings he possessed, done up in a bundle that he proposed to carry on the end of a stick, he went his way down the drive of Friar’s Court.  He had not gone far before he heard footsteps approaching, and, turning, beheld Harry Urquhart, running forward in haste.  The boy waited until his friend had come up with him.  He tried to speak, but found that impossible.  Something rose in his throat and choked his power of utterance.  \"You believe in me?\" said he at last.  \"I do,\" cried Harry, \"and I always will!  I know that you are innocent!\"  \"Thank you for that, sir!\" said Jim.  \"I can go my way with a lighter heart.\"  \"Where are you going?\" asked Harry.  \"I don’t know, sir, and I don’t think I care.  Anywhere, so long as I can get away from this place where I am suspected and despised!\"  \"Have you any money?\" asked Harry.  Jim shook his head.  \"Here you are.  Take this.  It’s all I have.\"  And Harry thrust into his friend’s hand a five-pound note.  Jim hesitated to take it; but in the end he did so, folding it carefully and putting it into his waistcoat pocket.  \"God bless you, sir!\" said he.  \"I’ll make it my life’s work,\" cried Harry, \"to prove your innocence. I’m confident I will succeed in the end.  For the present, good-bye!\"  \"Good-bye!\" said the other.  He dared not look young Urquhart in the face, for his eyes were filling fast with tears.  Then he went his way, throwing himself upon the mercy of the world, with life before him to be started all anew.  Under his own name, and with his old surroundings, he was disinherited, disowned, and dishonoured. He must find some new employment.  He must endeavour to forget and to live down the past.  At the gate of the drive he came into the highroad, and, turning his face towards London, set forward, walking as quickly as he could.     CHAPTER V—The Eleventh Hour   The following day Captain von Hardenberg left Friar’s Court.  He had more reasons than one to be anxious to return to London.  The robbery and the outrage at the bungalow had sadly interrupted Mr. Langton’s studies.  Nearly a month elapsed before the Judge took up his old researches, and then it was that for the first time he discovered that the Sunstone was missing.  Search where he might, he could find it nowhere.  The evidence was against Jim Braid, and there was no one to speak up on his behalf, for by then Harry Urquhart had returned to school.  On the night Braid was wounded, only his coat pockets had been emptied, and, since the whole of the money had been recovered, no further search had been made.  The Judge had little doubt in his mind that, as well as the contents of the cash-box, the boy had stolen the Sunstone, though poor Jim could have had no idea as to its value.  Mr. Langton was determined to recover the relic at all costs.  He spent a great deal of money on advertisements, and gave a full description of Braid to the police; but no trace of the boy could be found.  It was not until Christmas had come, and Harry Urquhart was again at Friar’s Court, that the Judge told his nephew of his suspicions.  And though Harry was sure of Braid’s innocence, he could not convince the Judge.  Mr. Langton’s mind was the mind of a lawyer; he based his conclusions upon the testimony of facts, and never allowed his personal opinions to influence him in the least.  Though the police had failed to discover any trace of Braid, Harry was determined to find him.  Since he had now left school, he obtained permission from his uncle to go to London.  He felt perfectly certain that Braid was somewhere in the great city where it is possible for a man to hide himself from the eyes of the world, even to bury his identity.  In the meantime, Captain von Hardenberg had presented himself before Peter Klein, the informer, and a long interview had taken place between them.  Peter listened to the whole story of the Sunstone, doubted it one moment, believed it the next; and fingered the strange jade ornament, first with reverence, and then almost with suspicion.  He examined it through a magnifying-glass, shook his head, shrugged his shoulders, and found it impossible to make up his mind.  Von Hardenberg made no secret of the fact that he was determined to undertake a journey through the German colonial territory of the Cameroons to the Caves of Zoroaster, to recover the jewels that were hidden in the vault.  With the treasure once in his possession, he swore that he would pay Klein, not only the full amount that was due to him, but ten per cent of the total profits.  Now, Peter Klein was a usurer—as well as a butler and a spy—one who drove a hard bargain, who was relentless to his victims.  He said that he himself was tired of cities, that the suspicions of the British police authorities had already been aroused in regard to his occupation, and that therefore he also would like to travel.  He would accompany von Hardenberg to the West Coast, which was once called the White-Man’s Grave; he would penetrate the bush to the Cameroon peaks, even to the Caves of Zoroaster.  But he would require more than ten per cent: they would share and share alike.  Von Hardenberg was in no position to refuse.  This man had him in his clutches.  Klein knew well that the Prussian was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39185"],["title","Across the Cameroons: A Story of War and Adventure (#5)"],["body","for life if ever his conduct was made known to the departmental heads of the German Secret Service.  And, moreover, in a few days Klein had gained the whip hand by enlisting in his services an Arab whom he found starving in the vicinity of the docks.  This man, though he was poor, in rags, and well-nigh perishing in the cold, was learned in many things.  Like all his race, he was a nomad—a man who had roamed the world throughout his life, who had even been all-powerful in his day.  He had sold ivory in Zanzibar; he had stolen cattle in the neighbourhood of Lake Chad, and driven his capture across the great plains to the east; he had hunted for slaves in the Upper Congo and the Aruwimi.  Though he was starving, he boasted that he was a sheik, and said that his name was Bayram.  He said he had been to the Cameroons River, and that he despised the Negro from Loango to Zanzibar. He was confident that, provided he was rewarded, he could render invaluable services to his employer.  He had never before heard of the Sunstone, but, from rumours he had heard, there was a treasure hidden somewhere in the mist-shrouded mountains that guard Lake Chad to the east.  To return to Jim Braid.  All these winter months he wandered the streets of London.  He found the greatest difficulty in getting work. He had no trade but that of a gamekeeper, and such business was at a discount in the midst of the great, seething city.  He was out of work for some weeks; then he obtained work in the docks; after which he was again unemployed for nearly a month.  By that time he had got to the end of his money, and was obliged to pawn his clothes.  He thanked Heaven when the snow came; for, though the frost was severe, and his clothes in rags, he saw employment in sweeping the pavements and the roads.  Then the thaw followed, and he was starving again.  One night he found himself in Jermyn Street.  He had had no food that day.  A taxi-cab drew up before a doorway, upon which was a brass plate bearing the name \"Peter Klein\".  Jim was conscious of the fact that he had heard the name before, he could not remember where.  Just then, starvation, ill-health, and the misery in his heart had broken the boy completely; it was as if his senses were numbed.  All that interested him was the taxi, by the side of which he remained, in the hope of earning a copper by opening the door.  Presently a manservant came from the house, carrying a box.  Jim volunteered to help him, and the man agreed.  Together they put the box upon the taxi-cab, and Jim noticed that it bore the same name, \"Peter Klein\", and several steamship labels, upon each of which was written the word \"Old Calabar\".  Jim Braid saw these things like one who is half-dazed, without understanding what they meant.  There were several other boxes to be put on to the cab, and when the work was finished, and the driver had strapped them securely together, two men came from the house, followed by one who wore a turban, and shivered from the cold.  Jim’s attention was attracted by the native.  He was very tall and thin. He had a great black beard, and his eyes were like those of a bird of prey.  They were cruel, bloodshot, and passionate.  One of the Europeans, who wore a fur coat, got into the cab.  The other paused with his foot upon the step and looked Jim Braid in the face. Near by a street lamp flared and flickered, and in the light Jim recognized the features of Captain von Hardenberg, the man who had been his accuser.  He stared at him in amazement.  He had not the power to speak.  He thought, at first, that he, too, would be recognized.  He did not know that misfortune had so changed him that his own mother would not have known him.  He was thin and haggard-looking; his rags hung loosely upon his gaunt form; his hair was so long that it extended over his ears.  \"Are you the man,\" said von Hardenberg in his old, insolent way, \"who helped to carry the boxes?\"  \"Yes,\" said Jim, \"I am.\"  \"There you are, then.  There’s sixpence, and don’t spend it on drink.\"  At that the Prussian jumped into the taxi, telling the driver to go to Charing Cross.  The Arab followed, closing the door, and a few seconds later the taxi was driving down the street.  Jim Braid stood on the pavement under the street lamp, regarding the sixpence in his hand.  He was starving; his bones ached from physical exhaustion; his head throbbed in a kind of fever.  He knew not where he would sleep.  This sixpence to him was wealth.  For a moment he was tempted, but not for longer.  With a quick, spasmodic action he hurled the coin into the gutter, and walked away quickly in the direction of the Haymarket.  He knew not where he was going.  The streets were crowded.  People were going to the theatre.  Outside a fashionable restaurant a lady with a gorgeous opera-cloak brushed against him, and uttered an exclamation of disgust.  He walked on more rapidly than before, and came presently to Trafalgar Square, and before he knew where he was he found himself on the Embankment.  Slowly he walked up the steps towards the Hungerford footbridge; and there, pausing, with his folded arms upon the rails, he looked down into the water.  At that moment the sound of footsteps attracted his attention.  He looked up into a face that he recognized at once.  It was that of Harry Urquhart, his only friend, the only person in the world who had believed him innocent.     CHAPTER VI—The Pursuit Begins   \"Jim!\" cried Harry.  So astonished was he that he reeled backward as though he had been struck.  \"My poor, old friend,\" said Harry.  \"I have searched for you everywhere, and had almost given up hope of finding you.  I don’t know what led my footsteps to the bridge.\"  At that Jim Braid burst into tears.  \"It was the work of God,\" said he.  Harry said nothing, but pressed Jim’s arm.  At the bottom of Northumberland Avenue he hailed a taxi, and the driver looked somewhat astonished when this ragged pauper got into the cab and seated himself at the side of his well-dressed companion.  Harry had rooms in Davies Street, where he thrust Jim into an arm-chair before the fire, upon which he heaped more coals.  Braid, leaning forward, held out his hands before the cheerful blaze.  As Harry looked at him, a great feeling of pity arose in his heart.  The boy looked so miserable and wretched that he appeared barely to cling to life.  Harry would not allow him to speak, until he had eaten a meal.  Braid fell upon his food like a wolf.  He had had absolutely nothing to eat for two days.  It is not wise to feed a starving man to repletion.  But perhaps in Braid’s case this made little or no difference, since the boy was on the verge of double pneumonia.  Within twenty-four hours he was in a raging fever, and for days afterwards the doctor despaired of saving his life. Starvation, cold, dirt, to say nothing of his wound, had done their work; but a strong heart and youth pulled him through.  It was nearly three months afterwards, when the spring was well advanced, that one afternoon the two friends talked the whole matter out.  Harry looked at Jim Braid and smiled.  \"You’re a different fellow now,\" said he.  \"It was a near thing though. One night the doctor gave you up.  He actually left the house believing you were dead.\"  Jim tried to thank his benefactor, but his heart was too full to speak.  \"Come,\" said Harry, \"tell me what has happened since you left Friar’s Court.\"  \"There is nothing to tell,\" said the other.  \"I tramped to London, sometimes sleeping in the open air, sometimes—when the weather was bad—lodging at wayside inns.  At first, I was glad to get here.  In a great city like this I felt I could not be recognized and pointed out as a thief.  Oh,\" he burst forth, \"you know that I am innocent!\"  \"I was always sure of it,\" said Harry.  \"I can’t think how my uncle can believe you guilty.\"  \"Everything was against me,\" said Jim.  \"That man, to shield himself, laid a trap for me from which I could not escape.  Had I known why he went to the bungalow that night, my story might have been believed.\"  \"I know why he went,\" said Harry.  \"I am sure of it.  It was to steal the Sunstone.\"  \"The Sunstone!\" said Braid.  \"What’s that?\"  \"It is a very valuable relic that originally came from Persia.  No one knows of its value but my uncle, von Hardenberg, and myself.  There can be no doubt that my cousin took it.\"  Jim Braid sighed.  \"I could not prove my innocence,\" said he.  \"Jim, old friend,\" said Harry, \"I promise you shall not remain under this cloud for the rest of your life.  I know my cousin to be guilty; I will not rest until I have proved him to be so.  He has the Sunstone in his possession, and I intend to do my best to recover it!\"  \"You will not succeed,\" said the other, shaking his head.  \"Why not?\"  \"Because he left England weeks ago.\"  \"Left England!\" echoed the other.  \"Yes.  He went away with a man called Peter Klein and a native who wore a turban.  They took the boat train from Charing Cross.  It was I who carried their boxes on to the taxi.  They were going to Old Calabar.\"  \"The West Coast!\" cried Harry, jumping to his feet.  Braid was as mystified as ever.  Before he knew what was happening, Harry had seized him by the shoulders, and was shaking him as a terrier shakes a rat.  \"Don’t you see,\" cried Urquhart, \"your innocence is practically proved already.  If they have not got the Sunstone, why should they want to go to Africa?  They are after the treasure of which the Sunstone is the key.  I don’t know who the native is, but he is probably some interpreter or guide whom they have hired for the journey.  Jim, when my uncle hears of this, I promise you he will take a very different view of the question.\"  \"Then,\" said Braid, \"has this Sunstone got something to do with Africa?\"  \"Everything!\" exclaimed the other.  \"Here, in Europe, it is valueless; but in certain caves which are situated upon the watershed on the southern side of the Sahara, the thing is worth "]]]
