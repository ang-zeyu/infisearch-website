The work of _arithmetic_ will now consist in taking that   formula for its starting point, and finding the number _x_ when the   values of the numbers _a_ and _b_ are given.]  We thus see that the _algebraic_ calculus and the _arithmetical_ calculus differ essentially in their object. They differ no less in the point of view under which they regard quantities; which are considered in the first as to their _relations_, and in the second as to their _values_. The true spirit of the calculus, in general, requires this distinction to be maintained with the most severe exactitude, and the line of demarcation between the two periods of the solution to be rendered as clear and distinct as the proposed question permits. The attentive observation of this precept, which is too much neglected, may be of much assistance, in each particular question, in directing the efforts of our mind, at any moment of the solution, towards the real corresponding difficulty. In truth, the imperfection of the science of the calculus obliges us very often (as will be explained in the next chapter) to intermingle algebraic and arithmetical considerations in the solution of the same question. But, however impossible it may be to separate clearly the two parts of the labour, yet the preceding indications will always enable us to avoid confounding them.  In endeavouring to sum up as succinctly as possible the distinction just established, we see that ALGEBRA may be defined, in general, as having for its object the _resolution of equations_; taking this expression in its full logical meaning, which signifies the transformation of _implicit_ functions into equivalent _explicit_ ones. In the same way, ARITHMETIC may be defined as destined to _the determination of the values of functions_. Henceforth, therefore, we will briefly say that ALGEBRA is the _Calculus of Functions_, and ARITHMETIC the _Calculus of Values_.  We can now perceive how insufficient and even erroneous are the ordinary definitions. Most generally, the exaggerated importance attributed to Signs has led to the distinguishing the two fundamental branches of the science of the Calculus by the manner of designating in each the subjects of discussion, an idea which is evidently absurd in principle and false in fact. Even the celebrated definition given by Newton, characterizing _Algebra_ as _Universal Arithmetic_, gives certainly a very false idea of the nature of algebra and of that of arithmetic.[5]    [Footnote 5: I have thought that I ought to specially notice this   definition, because it serves as the basis of the opinion which   many intelligent persons, unacquainted with mathematical science,   form of its abstract part, without considering that at the time of   this definition mathematical analysis was not sufficiently   developed to enable the general character of each of its principal   parts to be properly apprehended, which explains why Newton could   at that time propose a definition which at the present day he would   certainly reject.]  Having thus established the fundamental division of the calculus into two principal branches, I have now to compare in general terms the extent, the importance, and the difficulty of these two sorts of calculus, so as to have hereafter to consider only the _Calculus of Functions_, which is to be the principal subject of our study.     THE CALCULUS OF VALUES, OR ARITHMETIC.   _Its Extent._ The _Calculus of Values, or Arithmetic_, would appear, at first view, to present a field as vast as that of _algebra_, since it would seem to admit as many distinct questions as we can conceive different algebraic formulas whose values are to be determined. But a very simple reflection will show the difference. Dividing functions into _simple_ and _compound_, it is evident that when we know how to determine the _value_ of simple functions, the consideration of compound functions will no longer present any difficulty. In the algebraic point of view, a compound function plays a very different part from that of the elementary functions of which it consists, and from this, indeed, proceed all the principal difficulties of analysis. But it is very different with the Arithmetical Calculus. Thus the number of truly distinct arithmetical operations is only that determined by the number of the elementary abstract functions, the very limited list of which has been given above. The determination of the values of these ten functions necessarily gives that of all the functions, infinite in number, which are considered in the whole of mathematical analysis, such at least as it exists at present. There can be no new arithmetical operations without the creation of really new analytical elements, the number of which must always be extremely small. The field of _arithmetic_ is, then, by its nature, exceedingly restricted, while that of algebra is rigorously indefinite.  It is, however, important to remark, that the domain of the _calculus of values_ is, in reality, much more extensive than it is commonly represented; for several questions truly _arithmetical_, since they consist of determinations of values, are not ordinarily classed as such, because we are accustomed to treat them only as incidental in the midst of a body of analytical researches more or less elevated, the too high opinion commonly formed of the influence of signs being again the principal cause of this confusion of ideas. Thus not only the construction of a table of logarithms, but also the calculation of trigonometrical tables, are true arithmetical operations of a higher kind. We may also cite as being in the same class, although in a very distinct and more elevated order, all the methods by which we determine directly the value of any function for each particular system of values attributed to the quantities on which it depends, when we cannot express in general terms the explicit form of that function. In this point of view the _numerical_ solution of questions which we cannot resolve algebraically, and even the calculation of \"Definite Integrals,\" whose general integrals we do not know, really make a part, in spite of all appearances, of the domain of _arithmetic_, in which we must necessarily comprise all that which has for its object the _determination of the values of functions_. The considerations relative to this object are, in fact, constantly homogeneous, whatever the _determinations_ in question, and are always very distinct from truly _algebraic_ considerations.  To complete a just idea of the real extent of the calculus of values, we must include in it likewise that part of the general science of the calculus which now bears the name of the _Theory of Numbers_, and which is yet so little advanced. This branch, very extensive by its nature, but whose importance in the general system of science is not very great, has for its object the discovery of the properties inherent in different numbers by virtue of their values, and independent of any particular system of numeration. It forms, then, a sort of _transcendental arithmetic_; and to it would really apply the definition proposed by Newton for algebra.  The entire domain of arithmetic is, then, much more extended than is commonly supposed; but this _calculus of values_ will still never be more than a point, so to speak, in comparison with the _calculus of functions_, of which mathematical science essentially consists. This comparative estimate will be still more apparent from some considerations which I have now to indicate respecting the true nature of arithmetical questions in general, when they are more profoundly examined.   _Its true Nature._ In seeking to determine with precision in what _determinations of values_ properly consist, we easily recognize that they are nothing else but veritable _transformations_ of the functions to be valued; transformations which, in spite of their special end, are none the less essentially of the same nature as all those taught by analysis. In this point of view, the _calculus of values_ might be simply conceived as an appendix, and a particular application of the _calculus of functions_, so that _arithmetic_ would disappear, so to say, as a distinct section in the whole body of abstract mathematics.  In order thoroughly to comprehend this consideration, we must observe that, when we propose to determine the _value_ of an unknown number whose mode of formation is given, it is, by the mere enunciation of the arithmetical question, already defined and expressed under a certain form; and that in _determining its value_ we only put its expression under another determinate form, to which we are accustomed to refer the exact notion of each particular number by making it re-enter into the regular system of _numeration_. The determination of values consists so completely of a simple _transformation_, that when the primitive expression of the number is found to be already conformed to the regular system of numeration, there is no longer any determination of value, properly speaking, or, rather, the question is answered by the question itself. Let the question be to add the two numbers _one_ and _twenty_, we answer it by merely repeating the enunciation of the question,[6] and nevertheless we think that we have _determined the value_ of the sum. This signifies that in this case the first expression of the function had no need of being transformed, while it would not be thus in adding twenty-three and fourteen, for then the sum would not be immediately expressed in a manner conformed to the rank which it occupies in the fixed and general scale of numeration.     [Footnote 6: This is less strictly true in the English system of   numeration than in the French, since \"twenty-one\" is our more usual   mode of expressing this number.]  To sum up as comprehensively as possible the preceding"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/398"],["title","The First Book of Adam and Eve (#0)"],["body","First Book of Adam and Eve  by Rutherford Platt     TABLE OF CONTENTS   Prologue  Chapter I - The crystal sea, God commands Adam, expelled from Eden, to live in the Cave of Treasures.

This book is considered by many scholars to be part of the \"Pseudepigrapha\" (soo-duh-pig-ruh-fuh).  The \"Pseudepigrapha\" is a collection of historical biblical works that are considered to be fiction.  Because of that stigma, this book was not included in the compilation of the Holy Bible.  This book is a written history of what happened in the days of Adam and Eve after they were cast out of the garden. Although considered to be pseudepigraphic by some, it carries significant meaning and insight into events of that time.  It is doubtful that these writings could have survived all the many centuries if there were no substance to them.  This book is simply a version of an account handed down by word of mouth, from generation to generation, linking the time that the first human life was created to the time when somebody finally decided to write it down.  This particular version is the work of unknown Egyptians.  The lack of historical allusion makes it difficult to precisely date the writing, however, using other pseudepigraphical works as a reference, it was probably written a few hundred years before the birth of Christ.  Parts of this version are found in the Jewish Talmud, and the Islamic Koran, showing what a vital role it played in the original literature of human wisdom.  The Egyptian author wrote in Arabic, but later translations were found written in Ethiopic. The present English translation was translated in the late 1800's by Dr. S. C. Malan and Dr. E. Trumpp.  They translated into King James English from both the Arabic version and the Ethiopic version which was then published in The Forgotten Books of Eden in 1927 by The World Publishing Company.  In 1995, the text was extracted from a copy of The Forgotten Books of Eden and converted to electronic form by Dennis Hawkins.  It was then translated into more modern English by simply exchanging 'Thou' s for 'You's, 'Art's for 'Are's, and so forth.  The text was then carefully re-read to ensure its integrity.     Chapter I - The crystal sea, God commands Adam, expelled from Eden, to live in the Cave of Treasures.   1 On the third day, God planted the garden in the east of the earth, on the border of the world eastward, beyond which, towards the sun-rising, one finds nothing but water, that encompasses the whole world, and reaches to the borders of heaven.  2 And to the north of the garden there is a sea of water, clear and pure to the taste, unlike anything else; so that, through the clearness thereof, one may look into the depths of the earth.  3 And when a man washes himself in it, he becomes clean of the cleanness thereof, and white of its whiteness--even if he were dark.  4 And God created that sea of his own good pleasure, for He knew what would come of the man He would make; so that after he had left the garden, on account of his transgression, men should be born in the earth.  Among them are righteous ones who will die, whose souls God would raise at the last day; when all of them will return to their flesh, bathe in the water of that sea, and repent of their sins.  5 But when God made Adam go out of the garden, He did not place him on the border of it northward.  This was so that he and Eve would not be able to go near to the sea of water where they could wash themselves in it, be cleansed from their sins, erase the transgression they had committed, and be no longer reminded of it in the thought of their punishment.  6 As to the southern side of the garden, God did not want Adam to live there either; because, when the wind blew from the north, it would bring him, on that southern side, the delicious smell of the trees of the garden.  7 Wherefore God did not put Adam there.  This was so that he would not be able to smell the sweet smell of those trees, forget his transgression, and find consolation for what he had done by taking delight in the smell of the trees and yet not be cleansed from his transgression.  8 Again, also, because God is merciful and of great pity, and governs all things in a way that He alone knows--He made "]]]
