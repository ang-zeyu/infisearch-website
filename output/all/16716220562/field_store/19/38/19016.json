But when Reddie Ray lined to the second baseman, Clammer, having taken a lead, was doubled up in the play.  Of course, the sixth inning opened with the Stars playing only eight men.  There was another delay.  Probably everybody except Delaney and perhaps Healy had forgotten the Stars were short a man.  Fuller called time.  The impatient bleachers barked for action.  Capt. White came over to Delaney and courteously offered to lend a player for the remaining innings.  Then a pompous individual came out of the door leading from the press boxes--he was a director Delaney disliked.  \"Guess you'd better let Fuller call the game,\" he said brusquely.  \"If you want to--as the score stands now in our favor,\" replied Delaney.  \"Not on your life!  It'll be ours or else we'll play it out and beat you to death.\"  He departed in high dudgeon.  \"Tell Reddie to swing over a little toward left,\" was Delaney's order to Healy.  Fire gleamed in the manager's eye.  Fuller called play then, with Reddy Clammer and Reddie Ray composing the Star outfield.  And the Grays evidently prepared to do great execution through the wide lanes thus opened up.  At that stage it would not have been like matured ball players to try to crop hits down into the infield.  White sent a long fly back of Clammer.  Reddy had no time to loaf on this hit.  It was all he could do to reach it and he made a splendid catch, for which the crowd roundly applauded him.  That applause was wine to Reddy Clammer.  He began to prance on his toes and sing out to Scott:  \"Make 'em hit to me, old man!  Make 'em hit to me!\" Whether Scott desired that or not was scarcely possible to say; at any rate, Hanley pounded a hit through the infield.  And Clammer, prancing high in the air like a check-reined horse, ran to intercept the ball.  He could have received it in his hands, but that would never have served Reddy Clammer.  He timed the hit to a nicety, went down with his old grand-stand play and blocked the ball with his anatomy.  Delaney swore. And the bleachers, now warm toward the gallant outfielder, lustily cheered him.  Babcock hit down the right-field foul line, giving Clammer a long run.  Hanley was scoring and Babcock was sprinting for third base when Reddy got the ball. He had a fine arm and he made a hard and accurate throw, catching his man in a close play.  Perhaps even Delaney could not have found any fault with that play. But the aftermath spoiled the thing.  Clammer now rode the air; he soared; he was in the clouds; it was his inning and he had utterly forgotten his team mates, except inasmuch as they were performing mere little automatic movements to direct the great machinery in his direction for his sole achievement and glory.  There is fate in baseball as well as in other walks of life.  O'Brien was a strapping fellow and he lifted another ball into Clammer's wide territory.  The hit was of the high and far-away variety.  Clammer started to run with it, not like a grim outfielder, but like one thinking of himself, his style, his opportunity, his inevitable success.  Certain it was that in thinking of himself the outfielder forgot his surroundings.  He ran across the foul line, head up, hair flying, unheeding the warning cry from Healy.  And, reaching up to make his crowning circus play, he smashed face forward into the bleachers fence.  Then, limp as a rag, he dropped.  The audience sent forth a long groan of sympathy.  \"That wasn't one of his stage falls,\" said Delaney.  \"I'll bet he's dead....  Poor Reddy! And I want him to bust his face!\"  Clammer was carried off the field into the dressing room and a physician was summoned out of the audience.  \"Cap., what'd it--do to him?\" asked Delaney.  \"Aw, spoiled his pretty mug, that's all,\" replied Healy, scornfully. \"Mebee he'll listen to me now.\"  Delaney's change was characteristic of the man. \"Well, if it didn't kill him I'm blamed glad he got it....  Cap, we can trim 'em yet. Reddie Ray'll play the whole outfield.  Give Reddie a chance to run! Tell the boy to cut loose.  And all of you git in the game.  Win or lose, I won't forget it.  I've a hunch.  Once in a while I can tell what's comin' off.  Some queer game this!  And we're goin' to win. Gilbat lost the game; Clammer throwed it away again, and now Reddie Ray's due to win it....  I'm all in, but I wouldn't miss the finish to save my life.\"  Delaney's deep presaging sense of baseball events was never put to a greater test.  And the seven Stars, with the score tied, exhibited the temper and timber of a championship team in the last ditch.  It was so splendid that almost instantly it caught the antagonistic bleachers.  Wherever the tired Scott found renewed strength and speed was a mystery.  But he struck out the hard-hitting Providence catcher and that made the third out.  The Stars could not score in their half of the inning.  Likewise the seventh inning passed without a run for either side; only the infield work of the Stars was something superb. When the eighth inning ended, without a tally for either team, the excitement grew tense. There was Reddy Ray playing outfield alone, and the Grays with all their desperate endeavors had not lifted the ball out of the infield.  But in the ninth, Blake, the first man up, lined low toward right center.  The hit was safe and looked good for three bases.  No one looking, however, had calculated on Reddie's Ray's fleetness. He covered ground and dove for the bounding ball and knocked it down. Blake did not get beyond first base.  The crowd cheered the play equally with the prospect of a run.  Dorr bunted and beat the throw. White hit one of the high fast balls Scott was serving and sent it close to the left-field foul line.  The running Reddie Ray made on that play held White at second base.  But two runs had scored with no one out.  Hanley, the fourth left-handed hitter, came up and Scott pitched to him as he had to the others--high fast balls over the inside corner of the plate.  Reddy Ray's position was some fifty yards behind deep short, and a little toward center field. He stood sideways, facing two-thirds of that vacant outfield.  In spite of Scott's skill, Hanley swung the ball far round into right field, but he hit it high, and almost before he actually hit it the great sprinter was speeding across the green.  The suspense grew almost unbearable as the ball soared in its parabolic flight and the red-haired runner streaked dark across the green. The ball seemed never to be coming down.  And when it began to descend and reached a point perhaps fifty feet above the ground there appeared more distance between where it would alight and where Reddie was than anything human could cover.  It dropped and dropped, and then dropped into Reddie Ray's outstretched hands.  He had made the catch look easy. But the fact that White scored from second base on the play showed what the catch really was.  There was no movement or restlessness of the audience such as usually indicated the beginning of the exodus.  Scott struck Babcock out.  The game still had fire.  The Grays never let up a moment on their coaching.  And the hoarse voices of the Stars were grimmer than ever. Reddie Ray was the only one of the seven who kept silent. And he crouched like a tiger.  The teams changed sides with the Grays three runs in the lead. Morrissey, for the Stars, opened with a clean drive to right.  Then Healy slashed a ground ball to Hanley and nearly knocked him down. When old Burns, by a hard rap to short, advanced the runners a base and made a desperate, though unsuccessful, effort to reach first the Providence crowd awoke to a strange and inspiring appreciation.  They began that most rare feature in baseball audiences--a strong and trenchant call for the visiting team to win.  The play had gone fast and furious.  Wehying, sweaty and disheveled, worked violently.  All the Grays were on uneasy tiptoes.  And the Stars were seven Indians on the warpath.  Halloran fouled down the right-field line; then he fouled over the left-field fence.  Wehying tried to make him too anxious, but it was in vain.  Halloran was implacable.  With two strikes and three balls he hit straight down to white, and was out.  The ball had been so sharp that neither runner on base had a chance to advance.  Two men out, two on base, Stars wanting three runs to tie, Scott, a weak batter, at the plate! The situation was disheartening.  Yet there sat Delaney, shot through and through with some vital compelling force. He saw only victory.  And when the very first ball pitched to Scott hit him on the leg, giving him his base, Delaney got to his feet, unsteady and hoarse.  Bases full, Reddie Ray up, three runs to tie!  Delaney looked at Reddie.  And Reddie looked at Delaney.  The manager's face was pale, intent, with a little smile.  The player had eyes of fire, a lean, bulging jaw and the hands he reached for his bat clutched like talons.  \"Reddie, I knew it was waitin' for you,\" said Delaney, his voice ringing.  \"Break up the game!\"  After all this was only a baseball game, and perhaps from the fans' viewpoint a poor game at that.  But the moment when that lithe, redhaired athlete toed the plate was a beautiful one.  The long crash from the bleachers, the steady cheer from the grand stand, proved that it was not so much the game that mattered.  Wehying had shot his bolt; he was tired.  Yet he made ready for a final effort.  It seemed that passing Reddie Ray on balls would have been a wise play at that juncture.  But no pitcher, probably, would have done it with the bases crowded and chances, of course, against the batter.  Clean and swift, Reddie leaped at the first pitched ball.  Ping!  For a second no one saw the hit.  Then it gleamed, a terrific drive, low along the ground, like a bounding bullet, straight at Babcock in right field.  It struck his hands and glanced viciously away to roll toward the fence.  Thunder broke loose"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/385"],["title","The Redheaded Outfield, and Other Baseball Stories (#3)"],["body","the stands.  Reddie Ray was turning first base.  Beyond first base he got into his wonderful stride.  Some runners run with a consistent speed, the best they can make for a given distance.  But this trained sprinter gathered speed as he ran.  He was no short-stepping runner.  His strides were long.  They gave an impression of strength combined with fleetness. He had the speed of a race horse, but the trimness, the raciness, the delicate legs were not characteristic of him.  Like the wind he turned second, so powerful that his turn was short.  All at once there came a difference in his running.  It was no longer beautiful.  The grace was gone.  It was now fierce, violent.  His momentum was running him off his legs.  He whirled around third base and came hurtling down the homestretch. His face was convulsed, his eyes were wild.  His arms and legs worked in a marvelous muscular velocity.  He seemed a demon--a flying streak. He overtook and ran down the laboring Scott, who had almost reached the plate.  The park seemed full of shrill, piercing strife. It swelled, reached a highest pitch, sustained that for a long moment, and then declined.  \"My Gawd!\" exclaimed Delaney, as he fell back.  \"Wasn't that a finish? Didn't I tell you to watch them redheads!\"    THE RUBE  It was the most critical time I had yet experienced in my career as a baseball manager. And there was more than the usual reason why I must pull the team out.  A chance for a business deal depended upon the good-will of the stockholders of the Worcester club.  On the outskirts of the town was a little cottage that I wanted to buy, and this depended upon the business deal.  My whole future happiness depended upon the little girl I hoped to install in that cottage.  Coming to the Worcester Eastern League team, I had found a strong aggregation and an enthusiastic following.  I really had a team with pennant possibilities.  Providence was a strong rival, but I beat them three straight in the opening series, set a fast pace, and likewise set Worcester baseball mad.  The Eastern League clubs were pretty evenly matched; still I continued to hold the lead until misfortune overtook me.  Gregg smashed an umpire and had to be laid off.  Mullaney got spiked while sliding and was out of the game.  Ashwell sprained his ankle and Hirsch broke a finger.  Radbourne, my great pitcher, hurt his arm on a cold day and he could not get up his old speed.  Stringer, who had batted three hundred and seventy-one and led the league the year before, struck a bad spell and could not hit a barn door handed up to him.  Then came the slump.  The team suddenly let down; went to pieces; played ball that would have disgraced an amateur nine.  It was a trying time. Here was a great team, strong everywhere.  A little hard luck had dug up a slump--and now! Day by day the team dropped in the race.  When we reached the second division the newspapers flayed us.  Worcester would never stand for a second division team.  Baseball admirers, reporters, fans--especially the fans--are fickle.  The admirers quit, the reporters grilled us, and the fans, though they stuck to the games with that barnacle-like tenacity peculiar to them, made life miserable for all of us.  I saw the pennant slowly fading, and the successful season, and the business deal, and the cottage, and Milly----  But when I thought of her I just could not see failure.  Something must be done, but what?  I was at the end of my wits.  When Jersey City beat us that Saturday, eleven to two, shoving us down to fifth place with only a few percentage points above the Fall River team, I grew desperate, and locking my players in the dressing room I went after them.  They had lain down on me and needed a jar.  I told them so straight and flat, and being bitter, I did not pick and choose my words.  \"And fellows,\" I concluded, \"you've got to brace.  A little more of this and we can't pull out. I tell you you're a championship team.  We had that pennant cinched.  A few cuts and sprains and hard luck--and you all quit!  You lay down! I've been patient.  I've plugged for you. Never a man have I fined or thrown down.  But now I'm at the end of my string.  I'm out to fine you now, and I'll release the first man who shows the least yellow.  I play no more substitutes. Crippled or not, you guys have got to get in the game.\"  I waited to catch my breath and expected some such outburst as managers usually get from criticized players.  But not a word!  Then I addressed some of them personally.  \"Gregg, your lay-off ends today.  You play Monday.  Mullaney, you've drawn your salary for two weeks with that spiked foot.  If you can't run on it--well, all right, but I put it up to your good faith.  I've played the game and I know it's hard to run on a sore foot.  But you can do it. Ashwell, your ankle is lame, I know--now, can you run?\"  \"Sure I can.  I'm not a quitter.  I'm ready to go in,\" replied Ashwell.  \"Raddy, how about you?\" I said, turning to my star twirler.  \"Connelly, I've seen as fast a team in as bad a rut and yet pull out,\" returned Radbourne. \"We're about due for the brace.  When it comes--look out!  As for me, well, my arm isn't right, but it's acting these warm days in a way that tells me it will be soon.  It's been worked too hard. Can't you get another pitcher?  I'm not knocking Herne or Cairns.  They're good for their turn, but we need a new man to help out.  And he must be a crackerjack if we're to get back to the lead.\"  \"Where on earth can I find such a pitcher?\" I shouted, almost distracted.  \"Well, that's up to you,\" replied Radbourne.  Up to me it certainly was, and I cudgeled my brains for inspiration. After I had given up in hopelessness it came in the shape of a notice I read in one of the papers.  It was a brief mention of an amateur Worcester ball team being shut out in a game with a Rickettsville nine. Rickettsville played Sunday ball, which gave me an opportunity to look them over.  It took some train riding and then a journey by coach to get to Rickettsville.  I mingled with the crowd of talking rustics.  There was only one little \"bleachers\" and this was loaded to the danger point with the feminine adherents of the teams.  Most of the crowd centered alongside and back of the catcher's box.  I edged in and got a position just behind the stone that served as home plate.  Hunting up a player in this way was no new thing to me.  I was too wise to make myself known before I had sized up the merits of my man.  So, before the players came upon the field I amused myself watching the rustic fans and listening to them.  Then a roar announced the appearance of the Rickettsville team and their opponents, who wore the name of Spatsburg on their Canton flannel shirts.  The uniforms of these country amateurs would have put a Philadelphia Mummer's parade to the blush, at least for bright colors.  But after one amused glance I got down to the stern business of the day, and that was to discover a pitcher, and failing that, baseball talent of any kind.  Never shall I forget my first glimpse of the Rickettsville twirler.  He was far over six feet tall and as lean as a fence rail.  He had a great shock of light hair, a sunburned, sharp-featured face, wide, sloping shoulders, and arms enormously long.  He was about as graceful and had about as much of a baseball walk as a crippled cow.  \"He's a rube!\" I ejaculated, in disgust and disappointment.  But when I had seen him throw one ball to his catcher I grew as keen as a fox on a scent.  What speed he had!  I got round closer to him and watched him with sharp, eager eyes.  He was a giant.  To be sure, he was lean, rawboned as a horse, but powerful.  What won me at once was his natural, easy swing.  He got the ball away with scarcely any effort.  I wondered what he could do when he brought the motion of his body into play.  \"Bub, what might be the pitcher's name?\" I asked of a boy.  \"Huh, mister, his name might be Dennis, but it ain't.  Huh!\" replied this country youngster. Evidently my question had thrown some implication upon this particular player.  \"I reckon you be a stranger in these parts,\" said a pleasant old fellow.  \"His name's Hurtle--Whitaker Hurtle.  Whit fer short.  He hain't lost a gol-darned game this summer.  No sir-ee! Never pitched any before, nuther.\"  Hurtle!  What a remarkably fitting name!  Rickettsville chose the field and the game began. Hurtle swung with his easy motion.  The ball shot across like a white bullet.  It was a strike, and so was the next, and the one succeeding.  He could not throw anything but strikes, and it seemed the Spatsburg players could not make even a foul.  Outside of Hurtle's work the game meant little to me.  And I was so fascinated by what I saw in him that I could hardly contain myself. After the first few innings I no longer tried to.  I yelled with the Rickettsville rooters.  The man was a wonder.  A blind baseball manager could have seen that.  He had a straight ball, shoulder high, level as a stretched string, and fast.  He had a jump ball, which he evidently worked by putting on a little more steam, and it was the speediest thing I ever saw in the way of a shoot.  He had a wide-sweeping outcurve, wide as the blade of a mowing scythe.  And he had a drop--an unhittable drop.  He did not use it often, for it made his catcher dig too hard into the dirt.  But whenever he did I glowed all over.  Once or twice he used an underhand motion and sent in a ball that fairly swooped up.  It could not have been hit with a board.  And best of all, dearest to the manager's heart, he had control.  Every ball he threw went over the plate.  He could not miss it.  To him that plate was as big as a house.  What a find!  Already I had visions of the long-looked-for brace of my team, and of the pennant, and the little cottage, and the happy light of a pair of blue eyes.  What he meant to me, that country pitcher Hurtle!  He shut out the Spatsburg team without a "]]]
