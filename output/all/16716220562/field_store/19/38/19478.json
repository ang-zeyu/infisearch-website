We fought here and there--scattered fights. Those that got away joined up. We supplied the base at Orion--you people didn't know. But there was no hope; at least, nobody thought there was.\" He was silent a moment. \"Funny,\" he said, \"what happens when your back's to the wall, and there isn't any further place to go. Then you have to fight.\"  \"If our supply bases--\" Tony began thickly, but B'prith cut him off savagely.  \"Your supply bases! Don't you understand? We're beating you! Now you'll have to get out! All you white-grubs. Out of our system!\"  Tony's EEP moved forward ominously. B'prith saw it. He bent down, snatched up a rock, and hurled it straight at the EEP. The rock clanged off the metal hull and bounced harmlessly away. B'prith snatched up another rock. Llyre and the others came quickly out of the house. An adult Pas loomed up behind them. Everything was happening too fast. More rocks crashed against the EEP. One struck Tony on the arm.  \"Get out!\" B'prith screamed. \"Don't come back! This is our planet!\" His claws snatched at Tony. \"We'll tear you to pieces if you--\"  Tony smashed him in the chest. The soft shell gave like rubber, and the Pas stumbled back. He wobbled and fell over, gasping and screeching.  \"_Beetle_,\" Tony breathed hoarsely. Suddenly he was terrified. A crowd of Pas-udeti was forming rapidly. They surged on all sides, hostile faces, dark and angry, a rising thunder of rage.  More stones showered. Some struck the EEP, others fell around Tony, near his boots. One whizzed past his face. Quickly he slid his helmet in place. He was scared. He knew his EEP's E-signal had already gone out, but it would be minutes before a ship could come. Besides, there were other Earthmen in the city to be taken care of; there were Earthmen all over the planet. In all the cities. On all the twenty-three Betelgeuse planets. On the fourteen Rigel planets. On the other Orion planets.  \"We have to get out of here,\" he muttered to the EEP. \"Do something!\"  A stone hit him on the helmet. The plastic cracked; air leaked out, and then the autoseal filmed over. More stones were falling. The Pas swarmed close, a yelling, seething mass of black-sheathed creatures. He could smell them, the acrid body-odor of insects, hear their claws snap, feel their weight.  The EEP threw its heat beam on. The beam shifted in a wide band toward the crowd of Pas-udeti. Crude hand weapons appeared. A clatter of bullets burst around Tony; they were firing at the EEP. He was dimly aware of the metal body beside him. A shuddering crash--the EEP was toppled over. The crowd poured over it; the metal hull was lost from sight.  Like a demented animal, the crowd tore at the struggling EEP. A few of them smashed in its head; others tore off struts and shiny arm-sections. The EEP ceased struggling. The crowd moved away, panting and clutching jagged remains. They saw Tony.  As the first line of them reached for him, the protective envelope high above them shattered. A Terran scout ship thundered down, heat beam screaming. The crowd scattered in confusion, some firing, some throwing stones, others leaping for safety.  Tony picked himself up and made his way unsteadily toward the spot where the scout was landing.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I'm sorry,\" Joe Rossi said gently. He touched his son on the shoulder. \"I shouldn't have let you go down there today. I should have known.\"  Tony sat hunched over in the big plastic easychair. He rocked back and forth, face pale with shock. The scout ship which had rescued him had immediately headed back toward Karnet; there were other Earthmen to bring out, besides this first load. The boy said nothing. His mind was blank. He still heard the roar of the crowd, felt its hate--a century of pent-up fury and resentment. The memory drove out everything else; it was all around him, even now. And the sight of the floundering EEP, the metallic ripping sound, as its arms and legs were torn off and carried away.  His mother dabbed at his cuts and scratches with antiseptic. Joe Rossi shakily lit a cigarette and said, \"If your EEP hadn't been along they'd have killed you. Beetles.\" He shuddered. \"I never should have let you go down there. All this time.... They might have done it any time, any day. Knifed you. Cut you open with their filthy goddamn claws.\"  Below the settlement the reddish-yellow sunlight glinted on gunbarrels. Already, dull booms echoed against the crumbling hills. The defense ring was going into action. Black shapes darted and scurried up the side of the slope. Black patches moved out from Karnet, toward the Terran settlement, across the dividing line the Confederation surveyors had set up a century ago. Karnet was a bubbling pot of activity. The whole city rumbled with feverish excitement.  Tony raised his head. \"They--they turned our flank.\"  \"Yeah.\" Joe Rossi stubbed out his cigarette. \"They sure did. That was at one o'clock. At two they drove a wedge right through the center of our line. Split the fleet in half. Broke it up--sent it running. Picked us off one by one as we fell back. Christ, they're like maniacs. Now that they've got the scent, the taste of our blood.\"  \"But it's getting better,\" Leah fluttered. \"Our main fleet units are beginning to appear.\"  \"We'll get them,\" Joe muttered. \"It'll take a while. But by God we'll wipe them out. Every last one of them. If it takes a thousand years. We'll follow every last ship down--we'll get them all.\" His voice rose in frenzy. \"Beetles! Goddamn insects! When I think of them, trying to hurt my kid, with their filthy black claws--\"  \"If you were younger, you'd be in the line,\" Leah said. \"It's not your fault you're too old. The heart strain's too great. You did your job. They can't let an older person take chances. It's not your fault.\"  Joe clenched his fists. \"I feel so--futile. If there was only something I could do.\"  \"The fleet will take care of them,\" Leah said soothingly. \"You said so yourself. They'll hunt every one of them down. Destroy them all. There's nothing to worry about.\"  Joe sagged miserably. \"It's no use. Let's cut it out. Let's stop kidding ourselves.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"Face it! We're not going to win, not this time. We went too far. Our time's come.\"  There was silence.  Tony sat up a little. \"When did you know?\"  \"I've known a long time.\"  \"I found out today. I didn't understand, at first. This is--stolen ground. I was born here, but it's stolen ground.\"  \"Yes. It's stolen. It doesn't belong to us.\"  \"We're here because we're stronger. But now we're not stronger. We're being beaten.\"  \"They know Terrans can be licked. Like anybody else.\" Joe Rossi's face was gray and flabby. \"We took their planets away from them. Now they're taking them back. It'll be a while, of course. We'll retreat slowly. It'll be another five centuries going back. There're a lot of systems between here and Sol.\"  Tony shook his head, still uncomprehending. \"Even Llyre and B'prith. All of them. Waiting for their time to come. For us to lose and go away again. Where we came from.\"  Joe Rossi paced back and forth. \"Yeah, we'll be retreating from now on. Giving ground, instead of taking it. It'll be like this today--losing fights, draws. Stalemates and worse.\"  He raised his feverish eyes toward the ceiling of the little metal housing unit, face wild with passion and misery.  \"But, by God, we'll give them a run for their money. All the way back!

And he was prepared as no man had ever prepared himself before....  [Illustration]       DESIRE NO MORE    by Algis Budrys    (_illustrated by Milton Luros_)     \"_Desire no more than to thy lot may fall...._\"                                                    --Chaucer   The small young man looked at his father, and shook his head.  \"But you've _got_ to learn a trade,\" his father said, exasperated. \"I can't afford to send you to college; you know that.\"  \"I've got a trade,\" he answered.  His father smiled thinly. \"What?\" he asked patronizingly.  \"I'm a rocket pilot,\" the boy said, his thin jaw stretching the skin of his cheeks.  His father laughed in the way the boy had learned to anticipate and hate. \"Yeah,\" he said. He leaned back in his chair and laughed so hard that the Sunday paper slipped off his wide lap and fell to the floor with an unnoticed stiff rustle.  \"A _rocket_ pilot!\" His father's derision hooted through the quiet parlor. \"A ro--_oh, no!_--a rocket _pilot_!\"  The boy stared silently at the convulsed figure in the chair. His lips fell into a set white bar, and the corners of his jaws bulged with the tension in their muscles. Suddenly, he turned on his heel and stalked out of the parlor, through the hall, out the front door, to the porch. He stopped there, hesitating a little.  \"_Marty!_\" His father's shout followed him out of the parlor. It seemed to act like a hand between the shoulder-blades, because the boy almost ran as he got down the porch stairs.  \"What is it, Howard?\" Marty's mother asked in a worried voice as she came in from the kitchen, her damp hands rubbing themselves dry against the sides of her housedress.  \"Crazy kid,\" Howard Isherwood muttered. He stared at the figure of his son as the boy reached the end of the walk and turned off into the street. \"_Come back here!_\" he shouted. \"A _rocket_ pilot,\" he cursed under his breath. \"What's the kid been reading? Claiming he's a rocket pilot!\"  Margaret Isherwood's brow furrowed into a faint, bewildered frown. \"But--isn't he a little young? I know they're teaching some very odd things in high schools these days, but it seems to me....\"  \"Oh, for Pete's sake, Marge, there aren't even any rockets yet! _Come back here, you idiot!_\" Howard Isherwood was standing on his porch, his clenched fists trembling at the ends of his stiffly-held arms.  \"Are you sure, Howard?\" his wife asked faintly.  \"Yes, I'm _sure_!\"  \"But, where's he going?\"  \"_Stop that! Get off that bus! YOU hear me?_ Marty?\"  \"_Howard!_ Stop acting like a child and _talk_ to me! Where is that boy going?\"  Howard Isherwood, stocky, red-faced, forty-seven, and defeated, turned away from the retreating bus and looked at his wife. \"I don't know,\" he told her bitterly, between rushes of air into his jerkily heaving lungs. \"Maybe, the moon,\" he told her sarcastically.   Martin Isherwood, rocket pilot, weight 102, height 4', 11\", had come of age at seventeen.   The small man looked at his faculty advisor. \"No,\" he said. \"I am not interested in working for a degree.\"  \"But--\" The faculty advisor unconsciously tapped the point of a yellow pencil against the fresh green of his desk blotter, leaving a rough arc of black flecks. \"Look, Ish, you've got to either deliver or get off the basket. This program is just like the others you've followed for nine semesters; nothing but math and engineering. You've taken just about every undergrad course there is in those fields. How long are you going to keep this up?\"  \"I'm signed up for Astronomy 101,\" Isherwood pointed out.  The faculty advisor snorted. \"A snap course. A breather, after you've studied the same stuff in Celestial Navigation. What's the matter, Ish? Scared of liberal arts?\"  Isherwood shook his head. \"Uh-unh. Not interested. No time. And that Astronomy course isn't a breather. Different slant from Cee Nav--they won't be talking about stars as check points, but as things in themselves.\" Something seemed to flicker across his face as he said it.  The advisor missed it; he was too engrossed in his argument. \"Still a snap. What's the difference, how you look at a star?\"  Isherwood almost winced. \"Call it a hobby,\" he said. He looked down at his watch. \"Come on, Dave. You're not going to convince me. You haven't convinced me any of the other times, either, so you might as well give up, don't you think? I've got a half hour before I go on the job. Let's go get some beer.\"  The advisor, not much older than Isherwood, shrugged, defeated. \"Crazy,\" he muttered. But it was a hot day, and he was as thirsty as the next man.  The bar was air conditioned. The advisor shivered, half grinned, and softly quoted:    \"Though I go bare, take ye no care,   I am nothing a-cold;   I stuff my skin so full within   Of jolly good ale and old.\"  \"Huh?\" Ish was wearing the look with which he always reacted to the unfamiliar.  The advisor lifted two fingers to the bartender and shrugged. \"It's a poem; about four hundred years old, as a matter of fact.\"  \"Oh.\"  \"Don't you give a damn?\" the advisor asked, with some peevishness.  Ish laughed shortly, without embarrassment. \"Sorry, Dave, but no. It's not my racket.\"  The advisor cramped his hand a little too tightly around his glass. \"Strictly a specialist, huh?\"  Ish nodded. \"Call it that.\"  \"But _what_, for Pete's sake? What _is_ this crazy specialty that blinds you to all the fine things that man has done?\"  Ish took a swallow of his beer. \"Well, now, if I was a poet, I'd say it was the finest thing that man has ever done.\"  The advisor's lips twisted in derision. \"That's pretty fanatical, isn't it?\"  \"Uh-huh.\" Ish waved to the bartender for refills.   The _Navion_ took a boiling thermal under its right wing and bucked upward suddenly, tilting at the same time, so that the pretty brunette girl in the other half of the side-by-side was thrown against him. Ish laughed, a sound that came out of his throat as turbulently as that sudden gust of heated air had shot up out of the Everglades, and corrected with a tilt of the wheel.  \"Relax, Nan,\" he said, his words colored by the lingering laughter. \"It's only air; nasty old air.\"  The girl patted her short hair back into place. \"I wish you wouldn't fly this low,\" she said, half-frightened.  \"_Low?_ Call _this_ low?\" Ish teased. \"Here. Let's drop it a little, and you'll _really_ get an idea of how fast we're going.\" He nudged the wheel forward, and the _Navion_ dipped its nose in a shallow dive, flattening out thirty feet above the mangrove. The swamp howled with the chug of the dancing pistons and the claw of the propeller at the protesting air, and, from the cockpit, the Everglades resolved into a dirty-green blur that rocketed backward into the slipstream.  \"Marty!\"  Ish chuckled again. He couldn't have held the ship down much longer, anyway. He tugged back on the wheel suddenly, targeting a cumulous bank with his spinner. His lips peeled back from his teeth, and his jaw set. The _Navion_ went up at the clouds, her engine turning over as fast as it could, her wings cushioned on the rising thrust of another thermal.  And, suddenly, it was as if there were no girl beside him, to be teased, and no air to rock the wings--there were no wings. His face lost all expression. Faint beads of sweat broke out above his eyes and under his nose. \"Up,\" he grunted through his clenched teeth. His fists locked on the wheel. \"Up!\"  The _Navion_ broke through the cloud, kept going. \"Up.\" If he listened closely, in just the right way, he could almost hear ...  \"Marty!\"  ... the rumble of a louder, prouder engine than the Earth had ever known. He sighed, the breath whispering through his parting teeth, and the aircraft leveled off as he pushed at the wheel with suddenly lax hands. Still half-lost, he turned and looked at the white-faced girl. \"Scare you--?\" he asked gently.  She nodded. Her fingertips were trembling on his forearm.  \"Me too,\" he said. \"Lost my head. Sorry.\"   \"Look,\" he told the girl, \"You got any idea of what it costs to maintain a racing-plane? Everything I own is tied up in the Foo, my ground crew, my trailer, and that scrummy old Ryan that should have been salvaged ten years ago. I _can't_ get married. Suppose I crack the Foo next week? You're dead broke, a widow, and with a funeral to pay for. The only smart thing to do is wait a while.\"  Nan's eyes clouded, and her lips trembled. \"That's what I've been trying to say. _Why_ do you have to win the Vandenberg Cup next week? Why can't you sell the Foo and go into some kind of business? You're a trained pilot.\"  He had been standing in front of her with his body unconsciously tense from the strain of trying to make her understand. Now he relaxed--more--he slumped--and something began to die in his face, and the first faint lines crept in to show that after it had died, it would not return to life, but would fossilize, leaving his features in the almost unreadable mask that the newspapers would come to know.  \"I'm a good bit more than a trained pilot,\" he said quietly. \"The Foo Is a means to an end. After I win the Vandenberg Cup, I can walk into any plant in the States--Douglas, North American, Boeing--_any_ of them--and pick up the Chief Test Pilot's job for the asking. A few of them have as good as said so. After that--\" His voice had regained some of its former animation from this new source. Now he broke off, and shrugged. \"I've told you all this before.\"  The girl reached up, as if the physical touch could bring him back to her, and put her fingers around his wrist. \"Darling!\" she said. \"If it's that _rocket_ pilot business again....\"  Somehow, his wrist was out of her encircling fingers. \"It's always 'that _rocket_ pilot business,'\" he said, mimicking her voice. \"Damn it, I'm the only trained rocket pilot in the world! I weigh a hundred and fifteen pounds, I'm five feet tall, and I know more navigation and math than anybody the"]]]
