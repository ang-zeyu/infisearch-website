The majority were laughing and cutting jokes; some could be seen with grey, anxious faces as they thought of their dear ones at home; but amongst the whole complement there was not the faintest trace of faint-heartedness.  From the captain down to the youngest \"first-class\" boy the same sentiment held sway: that the _Warrior_ would be able to acquit herself with glory and with honour.  Through the sultry air could be faintly heard the distant and constant rumble of heavy gun-firing. The naval action was developing, although the engaged portions of the rival fleets were fifty or sixty miles away. The subdued noise made a fitting accompaniment to the stirring words of the commander.  Sefton, still remaining on the quarter-deck, could not help admiring the steadiness with which the cruisers kept station.  From time to time hoists of bunting fluttered to the yard-arm of the flagship _Defence_, the orders they expressed being carried out with the utmost celerity and precision.  A lieutenant descending from the after-bridge passed along the quarter-deck towards the companion on the half-deck.  \"You’re out of it, Sefton, I’m afraid,\" he remarked.  \"We’ve just had another wireless.  Our destroyers are giving the Huns socks.  The old _Calder_ is in the thick of it.\"  \"Any losses?\" asked Sefton, feeling ready to kick himself for being out of the scrap.  \"Don’t know yet,\" was the reply.  \"I only----\"  The lieutenant’s words were interrupted by the blare of a bugle. Turning on his heels he rushed forward at top speed, for at last the rousing order \"Action at the Double\" was given.  In an instant all was a scene of \"orderly confusion\", each man running with a set purpose.  For the most part the crew were stripped to the waist--a crowd of muscular-armed, deep-chested, clean-shaven men in the very pink of condition.  Still exchanging banter, they disappeared to their battle-stations, eager and alert to let loose a hail of shell upon the first hostile vessel that came within range.  \"Come along, old man,\" exclaimed the young sub who had previously \"cottoned on\" to Jack Sefton.  \"Now’s your chance if you want to see the fun.\"  The two junior officers made their way for’ard, past the starboard guns in their isolated and closely-sealed steel turrets, until they reached the foremast.  \"Up with you,\" said Sefton’s companion laconically.  Sefton agilely ascended to the dizzy perch known as the fire-control platform.  The other sub followed quickly at his heels, squeezed through the narrow aperture in the floor of the enclosed space, and slammed to the metal hinged cover.  \"At last!\" he exclaimed gleefully.  Sefton only nodded in complete accord.  A clock on the after side of the steel wall indicated 5.45.  A glance to the deck a hundred feet below showed no sign of life.  There was nothing to show that confined within that double-wedge-shaped hull were close upon seven hundred human beings, all with one set purpose, as the thirteen thousand tons of dead-weight forged ahead at full speed towards a distant blurr just visible through the ever-varying haze.  Suddenly the _Defence_ opened fire with her for’ard pair of 9.2’s, quickly following with her 7.5’s.  The ball had opened.  \"Fifteen eight hundred, sir,\" reported one of the range-finding officers within Sefton’s hearing.  Rapidly yet smoothly the _Warrior’s_ bow guns rose until Sefton could see their muzzles showing like oval-shaped cavities against the dull-grey painted chases.  For a second or two only the weapons hung seemingly irresolute.  Then with a concussion that shook the ship the guns sent their missiles hurtling through the air, while clouds of acrid-smelling smoke, black, white, and brown in hue, drifted rapidly across the deck.  At last the _Warrior_ had her chance--and she was taking it with a vengeance.     CHAPTER VII--In the Thick of the Fight   Leaving Sub-lieutenant Jack Sefton on his elevated perch in the fire-control station, it will be necessary to follow the fortunes of the vessel from which he had in theory deserted--the destroyer _Calder_.  Like the rest of the flotillas, the _Calder_ had cleared for action shortly after noon.  Hers was a far different part from that of the _Warrior_.  There was practically no protection for her guns’ crew and for the men serving the torpedo-tubes.  Her conning-tower afforded shelter only from slivers of steel and the bursting shrapnel; it was vulnerable to large projectiles.  Relying solely on her speed and quickness of helm, the destroyer’s mission was to dart in towards the enemy lines and get in as many hits with her torpedoes as possible. Then, if fortunate enough to escape a direct hit from the German guns, she would have to scurry back to the shelter of the battle-cruisers, and await another opportunity to make a further torpedo attack upon the enemy.  At 3.30 p.m. Beatty’s command increased speed to 25 knots, the Second Battle-cruiser Squadron forming astern of the First, while a far-flung line of destroyers took up station ahead.  The course was now E.S.E., slightly converging upon the enemy, whose ships, looming with varying degrees of visibility through the haze, were now at a distance of a little more than ten sea miles.  Half that distance away the Fifth Battle Squadron, including the gigantic _Warspite_, was bearing N.N.W., with the object of supporting the battle-cruisers when occasion arose.  It was a proud moment for the gallant Beatty when he realized that now he was between the enemy battle-cruisers and their North Sea bases; while there was an ever-increasing possibility that Jellicoe’s main fleet would speedily be in a position to cut off the German battleships from their retreat through the Skager-Rack to Kiel.  Yet at the same time the odds against Beatty were bordering upon the enormous.  His duty was to engage, entice, and hold the enemy in a northerly direction without being overwhelmed by superior force.  Even at the risk of losing some of his best ships he had to engage the attention of the enemy, lure them into the belief that at last the British battle-cruisers had run into a trap, and hammer away until the Commander-in-Chief arrived upon the scene with a vastly superior fleet.  At a quarter to five the opposing forces opened fire simultaneously at a range of 20,000 yards.  The _Calder_ was keeping station broad on the beam of the _Queen Mary_, and warding off threatened submarine attacks, for the time was not yet ripe for the destroyers to hurl themselves against the battered hostile ships.  \"By Jove, this is going to be ’some’ scrap,\" muttered Crosthwaite, as a regular tornado of heavy shells \"straddled\" the leading battle-cruisers.  At first the German gunnery was excellent, several direct hits being received by the British battle-cruisers, but in a few moments the steady, rapid, methodical salvoes from the British 13.5’s began to make themselves felt.  Between the patches of haze, rent by the lurid flashes of the guns, could be descried the greenish-grey outlines of the hostile vessels fast being reduced to scrap-iron.  For the time being all seemed well with the British battle-cruisers, whose volume of fire was still being delivered with that terrible regularity which the Huns have good cause to dread.  Suddenly the huge _Indefatigible_ was destroyed; a gallant battle-cruiser of nearly 19,000 tons had paid the price of Admiralty.  In previous naval battles such an appalling catastrophe as the blowing up of a mighty ship has caused the two fleets spontaneously to cease fire for a period of some minutes; but in the Jutland fight, regardless of the fate of the battle-cruiser, the rest of the squadron redoubled their efforts.  Not for one second did the hellish din cease, as the death-dealing salvoes hurtled into the opposing ships.  To quote the words of one on board the _Tiger_, it was \"a glorified Donnybrook Fair--whenever you see a head, crack it!\"  Twenty minutes later Crosthwaite saw the _Queen Mary_ sunk.  So quickly did she disappear that the _Tiger_, following astern, passed through the smoke that marked the grave of the devoted ship.  Beyond, the _Invincible_, already badly hit, sank, taking with her 750 gallant officers and men.  By this time the Fifth Battle Squadron, which had been attached to Beatty’s command, came into action, opening fire at 20,000 yards, and although the pressure of the enemy’s predominance in numbers was considerably relaxed, the danger was by no means over.  For, in the now thicker haze, the German battle fleet had arrived upon the scene, and Beatty was literally betwixt two fires. Yet he handled his vessels with admirable strategical and tactical skill, being convinced, as was every man under him, that in spite of losses he was succeeding in holding the Huns.  Majestically the four great battleships, _Warspite_, _Valiant_, _Barham_, and _Malaya_, bore into the mêlée, each of their 15-inch guns firing with terrible effect. The head of the German column seemed to be literally crumpled and crushed.  A large three-funnelled battleship, possibly the _Thuringien_, received terrific punishment.  Masts, funnels, turrets, were blown away piecemeal, until, a mass of smoke and flames, she hauled off line and was quickly screened by the smoke from some of the German destroyers.  Whether she sank--and it seemed as if she could not do otherwise--Crosthwaite was unable to determine.  Other German vessels, badly damaged, were swung out of position, some of them on fire and showing a tremendous list.  At a quarter to five both fleets altered course several points, the rival lines turning outwards and completely reversing their previous direction. It was at this juncture that the British destroyers were ordered to take advantage of the confusion in which the Huns had been thrown and to launch a torpedo attack upon the battered enemy ships.  \"Now for it,\" thought Crosthwaite, the glint of battle in his eyes.

A year of 458 days, twenty-six hours each. Moderate seasonal changes, axial tilt less than Earth's, orbit less elliptical. See the smallness of the north polar ice cap? The equatorial region--much too hot; the rest is subtropical to temperate. We should go down (if we do) near the 50th parallel--north, I'd say. Too much desert in the southern hemisphere. Might be hot winds, sandstorms.\"  \"The red-green _is_ vegetation?\" Dr. Christopher Wright teetered on long legs before the screen, a classroom mannerism unchanged by eleven years in the wilderness of space. He pinched and pulled the skin on his Adam's apple, his hawk's-beak, small-chinned head jutting forward with an awkwardness not aggressive but intent. Paul Mason thought: _You love him or hate him. In either case he's never quite grotesque._ Wright's too-soft voice insisted: \"It _is_, of course?\"  \"It has to be, Doc,\" Spearman said, and rubbed his bluish cheeks, looking older than his thirty-two years. Already he showed frontal baldness, deeply bracketed mouth corners. On Spearman's big shoulders was the burden of the ship. Watching him now, Paul Mason was troubled by a familiar thought: _Captain Jensen should not have died_.... \"It has to be. The instruments show oxygen in Earth proportion, or somewhat richer, plus nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The camera gives us tree shadows in these latest photographs with the stronger lens. The air may make us oxygen-happy--if we go down.... Well, Dorothy--two continents, two oceans, both smaller than the Atlantic, connected narrowly at north and south polar regions. Dozens of lakes bigger than the Caspian. The proportion of land to water surface works out nearly the same as on Earth. No mountains to match the Himalayas, but some pretty high ranges. Unlimited forest, prairie, desert.\" He closed bloodshot eyes, pressing the lids. Paul Mason thought: _I should never try to paint Ed. The portrait would always come out as Hercules Frustrated, and he wouldn't care for it...._ Spearman said, \"Even most of the tallest mountains look smooth--old. If there were glaciers it was a long time ago.\"  \"Geologically a quiet phase,\" Sears Oliphant remarked. \"As Earth looked in the Jurassic and may look again.\" Born fifty years ago in Tel Aviv, brought up in London, Rio, and New York because his parents were medical trouble shooters for the Federation, and possessed of a doctorate in biology (more exactly, taxonomy) from Johns Hopkins, Sears Oliphant claimed that his original Polish name could not have been spelled with the aid of two dictionaries and a crowbar. His fat face blinked at Dorothy with little kind eyes. \"I forget, sugar--you weren't around in the Jurassic, were you?\"  \"Maybe.\" Her slow smile was for Paul. \"As a very early mammal.\"  Wright said, \"No artifacts.... At first it looked like Venus.\" His crinkled asymmetrical face probed at them with a wistful half smile like a child's. \"May we call this planet Lucifer, son of the morning? And if we land and found a city (or am I being ridiculous?)--let it be Jensen City, in honor of a more-than-solar myth.\"  Shading closed lids, Spearman said with harshness, \"Myth?\"  \"Why, Ed, yes--like all remembered heroes who continue in the love of others, a love that magnifies. How else would you have it?\"  \"But\"--Ann Bryan was high-voiced, troubled--\"Lucifer----\"  \"My dear, Lucifer was an angel. Devils and angels have a way of turning out to be the same organism. I noticed that first when I was a damned interne. I noticed it again when I switched to anthropology. I even noticed it on a space ship with the five persons I love best.... No artifacts, huh?\"  Dorothy said, \"You haven't seen these latest pictures, Doc.\"  \"Something?\" Wright hurried over, gray eyes wide and sparkling. \"I'd quit hoping.\" Ann joined him, quick-motioned in her slimness, too taut. Wright slipped an elderly arm around her. \"Parallel lines, in jungle? Ah.... Now, why none in the open ground?\"  Spearman suggested: \"We could take more shots. But....\"  Paul Mason broke the darkening silence. \"But what, Ed?\"  \"We're falling, some. I could move us out into a self-sustaining orbit by using more of the reaction mass. We have none to waste. Jensen's death eleven years ago----\" Spearman shook his gaunt but heavy head. \"Thirty pre-calculated accelerations--and the rest periods they allowed us were insufficient, I think. You remember what wrecks we were when it was finished; that's why I tried to allow more time in deceleration.\" His brassy voice slowed, fetching out words with care: \"The last acceleration, as you know, was not pre-calculated. Jensen was already dead (must have been heart) when his hand took us out of automatic, made another acceleration that damn near flattened us----\"  \"Still here though.\" Sears Oliphant chuckled and patted his middle. \"We made it, didn't we, boy?\" It sounded a little forced.  \"In deceleration I had to allow for the big step Jensen never meant; more of the mass was used to correct a deflection. Same allowance must be made in returning, not to mention the biggest drain of all--getting out of gravity here, a problem not present at the spaceport. Oh, it's planned for--she's built to do it, even from a heavier planet than this. But after she's done it the margin for return will be--narrower than I care to think.\"  Dorothy, small and soft, leaned back in Paul's arms. Her even voice was for everyone in the control room: \"Nevertheless we'll go down.\"  Spearman gazed across at her without apparent comprehension. He went on, deliberate, harassed: \"Here's a thing I never told you. In that accidental acceleration the ship did not respond normally: the deflection happened then, and it may have been due to a defect in the building of _Argo_, a fault in the tail jets. At the time, it was all I could do to reach Jensen before I blacked out--I still don't know how I ever managed it. Later I tried to think there could be no defect. The forward jets took care of us nicely in deceleration. Until we start braking, we can't know. Indicators _say_ everything's all right down there. Instruments can lie. Lord, they've sweated out atomic motors since before 1960, almost a century now--and we're still kids playing with grown-up toys.\"  Sears smiled into plump hands. \"So I must be sure to pack my microscope in one of the lifeboats--hey?\"  \"You're for landing, then.\"  Sears nodded. Ann Bryan thrust thin ivory fingers into her loose black hair. \"_I_ couldn't take another eleven years.\" She attempted a smile. \"Tell me, somebody--tell me there'll be music on Lucifer--a way to make new strings for my violin before I forget everything....\"  Dorothy said, \"Land.\" Gently, as one might say time for lunch. And she added: \"We'll find strings, Nan.\"  \"Land, of course,\" said Christopher Wright, preoccupied; his long finger tapped on the photograph; his lips went on moving silently, carrying through some private meditation. \"Land. Give protoplasm a chance.\"  \"Land,\" Paul Mason said. _Did anyone suppose the First Interstellar would just turn around and go home? We're here, aren't we...?_  Through hours when spoken words were few, inner words riotous, Lucifer turned an evening face. A morning descent might have been pleasanter in human terms, but the calculator, churning its mathematical brew, said the time was now.  Paul Mason squirmed into his pilot's seat. It was good, he thought, that they could at least meet the challenge of the unexplored with adequate bodies. Wright was dryly indestructible; Ed Spearman a gaunt monolith; the plumpness of Sears Oliphant had nothing flabby. The women were in the warm vigor of a youth that had never known illness. As for his own body, Paul felt for it now a twinge of amused admiration, as if he were seeing an animated statue by an artist better than himself: slender, tough, nothing too much, built for endurance and speed--it would serve. Spearman was already talking in the earphones: \"Close lock. Retract shield.\" Paul responded from ingrained training. Beyond the window that would give him forward vision in the (impossible) event he had to fly the lifeboat,"]]]
