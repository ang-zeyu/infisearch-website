Giovanni. Raffaello Motta was undoubtedly a pupil of Orsi, better known under the name of Raffaellino da Reggio, who left in his native place a few of his productions in fresco; an astonishing genius, deserving of Rome for his theatre of action, as indeed I before observed, and of being lamented like a new Raffaello, prematurely passing away.  At this period Carpi had to boast the name of Orazio Grillenzone, who resided mostly in Ferrara, where enjoying the acquaintance of Tasso, he was honoured and immortalized by his pen, being rendered the subject of that dialogue, bearing for its title, _Il Grillenzone_, or the _Epitaph_. But none of his paintings are now to be found in that city; and even what remains of his in Carpi is of a very disputable character. I do not here speak of the celebrated Girolamo of Carpi; because he was in fact a native of Ferrara, as I elsewhere observed. There is little to be said of Ugo da Carpi, as a painter: he was of an inferior genius when he applied himself to his pencil; and fell still further below mediocrity when he became whimsical enough to paint with his fingers, recording the exploit upon the canvass, as he did in the figure of the Volto Santo, the Holy Face, at S. Pietro, in Rome. Still we ought to bear honourable testimony to his merit, as the inventor of wood engraving in two, and next in three blocks, or pieces, by which he expressed the three different tints, the shade, the middle tints, and the light.[8] In this way he produced many designs and inventions of Raffaello, with greater clearness than even Marc Antonio had before done; besides opening to posterity a new path, as it were, of painting in chiaroscuro, very easily imitated and multiplied. Vasari particularly treats upon it at the close of his Introduction; and there, no less than in other places, commends the genius of Ugo as one of the most acute that was ever directed towards the fine arts.    Footnote 8: The Germans claim the invention of the art of      engraving in wood, in _chiaroscuro_, before Ugo announced it      to the Italians. For this, they produce the cards of Gio.      Ulderico Pilgrim, which, although _Gothic_, observes Huber,      (p. 89) _produce an admirable effect in regard to      chiaroscuro_. They make out the inventor to be very ancient,      enumerating Mair and others, equally celebrated at the same      period. We are told nothing, however, in regard to their      mechanism, which was probably not the same as that of Ugo.       It will not here be thought irrelevant to record the new      method of engraving in the Dutch manner, in imitation of      coloured designs, though not executed by process of wood,      but of copper. It has been introduced into Tuscany, through      the efforts of the distinguished Cosimo Rossi, a gentleman      of Pistoia, and vice-president of the academy. After various      experiments, and making the first trials upon some      representations of tombs, in the solid Egyptian style of his      own invention, it soon became also imitated in other modes      of engraving, and more especially in the _Viaggio Pittorico_      of Traballesi. It were desirable that the before-mentioned      gentleman should continue to apply the same in works of      architecture and perspective; in which he succeeds admirably      also with his pencil, very happily emulating the style of      Canaletto. The method ought to be explained very minutely;      but it is both too complicate and too extensive to be      adapted to the degree of brevity we have bound ourselves to      observe upon similar subjects.     MODENESE SCHOOL.     EPOCH III.       _The Modenese Artists of the Seventeenth Century chiefly      follow the example of the Bolognese._   The taste introduced by Munari into Modena and the state, together with the example of Coreggio and Lelio, did not become wholly extinct in the seventeenth century. It was in some measure continued by several of their pupils and imitators, but in proportion as those of the Caracci grew into greater credit, gradually extending their influence over the other schools of Italy, it began to decline apace. It is well known that some of the Modenese frequented their academy, and Bartolommeo Schedone is included by Malvasia among the scholars of the Caracci. If such be the fact, we must conclude, either that his first productions are not known, or that he merely saluted that school, as it were, from the threshold; inasmuch as the larger works which are pointed out as his, betray few traces of the style of the Caracci. It seems more probable that he employed himself in following the successors of Raffaello in his native place, and in particular Coreggio, of whom there remained so many original pieces. His pieces in fresco, executed in competition with Ercole Abati, about 1604, still exist in the public palace; and among these is the beautiful history of Coriolanus, and the Seven Sisters, who are meant to represent Harmony: whoever observes these will find they possess a mixture of the two characters before alluded to. There is, moreover, in the cathedral, a half figure of S. Geminiano, with an infant boy restored by him to life, supporting himself by the saint's staff, and apparently returning his thanks. It may be enumerated among the best of his works, and bears a striking resemblance to those of Coreggio. The same resemblance was affirmed from that period in other of his pictures transferred elsewhere; and Marini mentions them in one of his letters as a kind of phenomenon. Scanelli, who wrote about forty years after the death of Schedone, also confirms such an opinion; though to make the imitation complete, he would have wished a little more practice and solidity, in which I rather think he alludes to his perspective and design, not always quite correct. For the rest his figures, both in their character and their action, are very pleasing, while his colouring in fresco is very vivid and lively; in oils he is more serious, but more harmonious, though not always free from the ill effect produced by the bad grounds usual in the age of the Caracci. His pictures on a larger scale, such as his Piet√†, now in the academy of Parma, are extremely rare, and also his history-pieces, as the Nativity of our Lord and that of the Virgin, placed for lateral ornaments to an altar-piece by Filippo Bellini. Of his Holy Families, and little sacred pieces, there are some remaining; such as are found in galleries being highly valuable, so much so, that Tiraboschi records the sum of 4,000 crowns having been required for one of them. The court of Naples is extremely rich in them, having, together with the other Farnesian pictures, obtained also those painted by Schedone, while in the service of Duke Ranuccio, his most liberal patron. This artist produced but little, being seduced by the love of gambling; nor did he survive very long after losing a large sum of money, about the end of the year 1615.  The three following names belong to the school of the Caracci, also in regard to style. Giacomo Cavedone, born in Sassuolo, but absent from the state after the period of youth, was esteemed one of the best disciples of Lodovico. Giulio Secchiari, of Modena, resided also at Rome, and in Mantua, where he produced several excellent pictures for the court, which perished in the sack of 1630. What remains of him in his native place, and in particular the Death of the Virgin, in the subterranean part of the cathedral, with four crowns around, is calculated to give rise to lively regret, that Giulio should not be equally well known in different collections, with the other disciples of the Caracci. Camillo Gavassetti, likewise of Modena, may boast also of a greater degree of merit than of fame; no less because he died young, than because of his attaching himself to works in fresco, which, confined to the place in which they are produced, confine also the reputation of the artist. He is better known in Piacenza than in Modena, Parma, or, indeed, any other city. One of his paintings adorns the presbytery of the church of S. Antonino, accompanied with figures taken from the Apocalypse, so finely executed as to induce Guercino, when coming to Piacenza to complete his finest work, to bestow the highest commendation upon it; and it is still enumerated among the chief ornaments of that rich and ornate city. There is something so grand, spirited, and choice, in its whole expression, combined with so much grace and harmony of tints, that it equally surprises us when viewed together, and satisfies us when examined part by part. The action only is sometimes too extravagant, and some of the figures are hardly sufficiently studied. In fact, this artist preferred expedition to high finish; and held a dispute, reported by Baldinucci, with Tiarini, who practised and maintained the contrary, a plan by which, in all works of importance, he was preferred to him in Parma. In Santa Maria di Campagna, at Piacenza, however, where they both painted scriptural histories in opposition, Gavassetti maintains his ground against Tiarini, and other competitors, very numerous and distinguished for that period.  When the pupils of the Caracci succeeded their masters in Bologna, the young artists of the neighbouring state of Modena continued to receive instructions from them, being highly esteemed in the court of Este. At that period flourished Francesco I., and Alfonso IV., both of whom, according to the history of Malvasia, were greatly attached to the followers of the Caracci; some of these they invited into their service, others they employed in their palaces, and at their public festivals; and from all they were anxious to obtain designs and pictures which they might exhibit in their churches, or in their grand collection of paintings, rendered by their means one of the richest in Europe.

Because of what had   happened, it was but natural that he should invite Andy and Chet to   accompany him, and equally natural that they should hasten to accept   the invitation.    The boys knew that they would have no easy time of it, yet they did   not dream of the many perils that awaited the entire party. Once the   staunch steamer was in danger of being crushed by an immense iceberg,   in which event this chronicle would not have been written. Again, the   boys and the others had a fierce fight with polar bears and with a   savage walrus. When the ship was jammed hard and fast in the ice a   start was made by the exploring party, accompanied by some Esquimaux   and several dog sledges. All had heard of the marvelous achievements   of Cook and Peary, and all were fired with a great ambition to go and   do likewise. With the thermometer often at fifty degrees below zero,   they pushed on steadily, facing death more than once. To add to their   troubles they had sickness in camp, and snow-blindness, and once some   Esquimaux, becoming scared, rebelled and tried to run off with their   supplies. Then, when the North Pole was at last gained, it became the   gravest kind of a problem how to return to civilization alive.    In penning this volume I have had a twofold purpose in mind: the first   to show what pure grit and determination can do under the most trying   of circumstances, and the second to give my readers an insight into   Esquimaux life and habits, and to relate what great explorers like   Franklin, Kane, Hall, DeLong, Nansen, Cook, and Peary have done to   open up this weird and mysterious portion of our globe.

I hardly think Mr. Storburgh will have an opening for me, but it won't hurt to ask him.\"  \"Did you try Sam Hickley, as I told you to?\" continued Josiah Graham, as he settled himself more comfortably before the open fireplace of the cabin.  \"Yes, but he said he had all the men he wanted.\" Andy Graham gave something of a sigh. \"Seems to me there are more lumbermen in this part of Maine than there is lumber.\"  \"Humph! I guess you ain't tried very hard to git work,\" grumbled the old man, drawing up his bootless feet on the rungs of his chair, and spreading out his hands to the generous blaze before him. \"Did you see them Plover brothers?\"  \"No, but Chet Greene did, day before yesterday, and they told him they were laying men off instead of taking 'em on.\"  \"Humph! I guess thet Chet Greene don't want to work. He'd rather fool his time away in the woods, huntin' and fishin'.\"  \"Chet is willing enough to work if he can get anything to do. And hunting pays, sometimes. Last week he got a fine deer and one of the rich hunters from Boston paid him a good price for it.\"  \"Humph! Thet ain't as good as a stiddy, payin' job. I don't want you to be a-lazin' your time away in the woods,--I want you to grow up stiddy an' useful. Besides, we got to have money, if we want to live.\"  \"Aren't you going to try to get work, Uncle Si?\" asked the boy anxiously, as he gazed at the large and powerful-looking frame of the man before him.  \"To be sure I'm a-goin' to go to work--soon as I'm fit. But I can't do nuthin with my feet an' my stomach goin' back on me, can I?\"  \"I thought your dyspepsia was about over--you've eaten so well the past week. And you've walked considerably lately. If you got something easy----\"  \"Now, don't you go to tellin' me what to do!\" cried the old man, wrathfully. \"I'm a sick man, that's what I am. I ain't able to work, an' it's up to you as a dootiful nevvy to git work an' support us both. Now you jest trot off to the Storburgh camp, an' don't you come home till you git work. An' after this, you better give up havin' anything to do with thet good-fer-nuthin, lazy Chet Greene.\"  The boy's eyes flashed for an instant and he was on the point of making a bitter reply to his relative. But then his mouth closed suddenly and he turned away. In silence he drew off his slippers, donned his big boots, and put on his overcoat and his winter cap. Then he pulled on his gloves, slung a game bag over his shoulder, and reached for a gun that stood behind a door.  \"Wot you takin' thet fer?\" demanded Josiah Graham, with his eyes on the gun. \"Didn't I tell you to look fer a job?\"  \"That's what I'm going to do,\" was the reply. \"But if I come across any game on the way I want the chance to bring it down.\"  \"Humph! I know how boys are! Rather loaf around the woods than work, any time.\"  \"Uncle Si, if you say another word----\" began the youth, and then he stopped short, turned on his heel, and walked from the cabin, closing the door none too gently behind him.  It was certainly a trying situation, and as he stepped out into the snow Andy felt as if he never wanted to go back and never wanted to see his Uncle Si again.  \"It's his laziness, nothing else,\" murmured the boy to himself, as he trudged off. \"He's as able to work as I am. He always was lazy--father said so. Oh, dear; I wish he had never come to Pine Run!\"  Andy was a youth of seventeen, of medium height, but with well-developed chest and muscles. His face was a round one, and usually good to look at, although at present it was drawn down because of what had just occurred.  The boy was an orphan, the son of a man who in years gone by had bought and sold lumber throughout the northern section of Maine. His mother had been taken away when he was a small lad, and then he and his father had left town and come to live in the big cabin from which Andy was now trudging so rapidly. An old colored woman had come along, to do the cooking and other household work.  A log jam on the river had caused Mr. Graham's death two years before this tale opens, and for a short time Andy had been left utterly alone, there being no near neighbors and no relatives to take care of the orphan. True, he had been offered a home by a lumber dealer of Bangor, but the man was such a harsh fellow that Andy shrank from going with him.  Then, one day, much to everybody's surprise, Josiah Graham appeared on the scene and announced his intention to settle down and live with his nephew. Josiah was an older half-brother to Andy's father, and the boy had often heard of him as a shiftless, lazy ne'er-do-well, who drifted from one town to another, seldom keeping a job longer than two or three weeks or a month. He did not drink, but he loved to smoke, and to tell stories of what he had done or was going to do.  \"I'm a-goin' to take Andy in hand an' make a man of him,\" he declared, shortly after his arrival. \"A young feller like him needs a guardeen.\" And then he had his trunk carted to the cabin and, without asking Andy's permission, proceeded to settle down and make himself comfortable.  At first it looked as if matters might go along smoothly enough, for Josiah Graham managed to obtain a position as time-keeper at one of the lumber camps, where Andy was employed as a chopper. But soon the man's laziness manifested itself, and when he did not do his work properly he was discharged.  \"It was the boss's fault, 'twasn't mine,\" he told Andy, but the youth knew better. Then he got into a quarrel with the negro woman who did the housework and told her to go away.  \"'Twill be one less to feed,\" he said to his nephew. \"We can do our own work.\" But he did not do a stroke extra, and it fell to Andy's share to sweep, and wash dishes, and make his own bed. Uncle Si wanted him to make the other bed too, but he refused.  \"If you want it made, you can make it yourself!\" declared Andy, with spirit. \"You are not working at the camp, while I am.\" This led to a lively quarrel. After that Josiah Graham did make up the bed a few times, but usually when he"]]]
