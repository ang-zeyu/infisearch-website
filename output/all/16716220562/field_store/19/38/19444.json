Even so she shrank at sight of herself below the line of sunburn, for she was ringed about like a blue-winged teal, the demarcation being more pronounced because of the natural whiteness of her skin. The year previous Doret had brought her from the coast a Spanish shawl, which a salt-water sailor had sold him, and which had lain folded away ever since. She brought it forth now and arranged it about her shoulders, but in spite of this covering the fair flesh beneath peeped through its wide interstices most brazenly. She had never paid marked attention to the fairness of her skin till now, and all at once this difference between herself and her little brother and sister struck her. She had been a mother to them ever since they came, and had often laughed when she saw how brown their little bodies were, rejoicing in blushing quietude at her own whiteness, but to-day she neither laughed nor felt any joy, rather a dim wonder. She sat down, dress and all, in the thick softness of a great brown bear-skin and thought it over.  How odd it was, now that she considered it, that she needed no aid with these alien garments, that she knew instinctively their every feature, that there was no intricacy to cause her more than an instant's trouble. This knowledge must be a piece with the intuitive wit that had been the wonder of Father Barnum and had enabled her to absorb his teachings as fast as he gave them forth.  She was interrupted in her reverie by the passing of a shadow across her window and the stamp of a man's feet on the planks at the door. Of course, it was Poleon, who had come back to see her; so she rose hastily, gave one quick glance at the mirror above her washstand, choosing the side that distorted her image the least, and, hearing him still stamping, perfunctorily called:  \"Come in! I'll be right out.\"  She kicked the train into place behind her, looped the shawl carelessly about her in a way to veil her modesty effectively, and, with an expectant smile at his extravagance of admiration, swept out into the big room, very self-conscious and very pleasing to the eye. She crossed proudly to the reading-table to give him a fair view of her splendor, and was into the middle of the room before she looked up. Taken aback, she uttered a little strangled cry and made a quick movement of retreat, only to check herself and stand with her chin high in the air, while wave after wave of color swept over her face.  \"Great lovely dove!\" ejaculated Burrell, fervently, staring at her.  \"Oh, I--I thought you were Poleon. He--\" In spite of herself she glanced towards her room as if to flee; she writhed at the utter absurdity of her appearance, and knew the Lieutenant must be laughing at her. But flight would only make it worse, so she stood as she was, having drawn back as far as she could, till the table checked her. Burrell, however, was not laughing, nor smiling even, for his embarrassment rivalled hers.  \"I was looking for your father,\" he said, wondering if this glorious thing could be the quaint half-breed girl of yesterday. There was nothing of the native about her now, for her lithe young figure was drawn up to its height, and her head, upon which the long, black braids were coiled, was tipped back in a haughty poise. She had flung her hands out to grasp the table edge behind her, forgetful of her shawl, which drooped traitorously and showed such rounded lines as her ordinary dress scarce hinted at. This was no Indian maid, the soldier vowed; no blood but the purest could pulse in such veins, no spirit save the highest could flash in such eyes as these. A jealous rancor irked him at the thought of this beauty intended for the Frenchman's eyes.  \"Can't you show yourself to me as well as to Poleon?\" he said.  \"Certainly not!\" she declared. \"He bought this dress for me, and I put it on to please him.\" Now she was herself again, for some note in the Lieutenant's voice gave her dominance over him. \"After he sees it I will take it off, and--\"  \"Don't--don't take it off--ever,\" said Burrell. \"I thought you were beautiful before, because of your quaintness and simplicity, but now--\" his chest swelled--\"why, this is a breath from home. You're like my sister and the girls back in Kentucky, only more wonderful.\"  \"Am I?\" she cried, eagerly. \"Am I like other girls? Do I really look as if I'd always worn clothes like these?\"  \"Born to them,\" said he.  A smile broke over her grave face, assuming a hundred different shades of pleasure and making a child of her on the instant; all her reserve and hauteur vanished. Her warmth and unaffected frankness suffused him, as she stood out, turning to show the beauties of her gown, her brown hands fluttering tremulously as she talked.  \"It's my first party-dress, you know, and I'm as proud of it as Molly is of her rubber boots. It's too big in here and too small right there; that girl must have had a bad chest; but otherwise it fits me as if it had been made for me, doesn't it? And the shoes! Aren't they the dearest things? See.\" She held her skirts back, showing her two feet side by side, her dainty ankles slim and shapely in their silk.  \"They won't shed water,\" he said.  \"I know; and look at the heels. I couldn't walk a mile to save my life.\"  \"And they will come off if they get wet.\"  \"But they make me very tall.\"  \"They don't wear as well as moccasins.\" Both laughed delightedly till he broke in, impulsively:  \"Oh, girl, don't you know how beautiful you are?\"  \"Of course I do!\" she cried, imitating his change of voice; then added, naively, \"That's why I hate to take it off.\"  \"Where did you learn to wear things like that?\" he questioned. \"Where did you get that--well--that air?\"  \"It seems to me I've always known. There's nothing strange about it. The buttons and the hooks and the eyes are all where they belong. It's instinct, I suppose, from father's side--\"  \"Probably. I dare say I should understand the mechanism of a dress-suit, even if I'd never seen one,\" said the man, amused, yet impressed by her argument.  \"I've always had visions of women dressed in this kind of clothing, white women--never natives--not dressed like this exactly, but in dainty, soft things, not at all like the ones I wear. I seem to have a memory, although it's hardly that, either--it's more like a dream--as if I were somebody else. Father says it is from reading too much.\"  \"A memory of what?\"  \"It's too vague and tantalizing to tell what it is, except that I should be called Merridy.\"  \"Merridy? Why that?\"  \"I'll show you. See.\" She slipped her hand inside the shawl and drew from her breast a thin gold chain on which was strung a band ring. \"It was grandmother's--that's where I got the fancy for the name of Merridy, I suppose.\"  \"May I look?\"  \"Of course. But I daren't take it off. I haven't had it off my neck since I was a baby.\" She held it out for him to examine, and, although it brought his head close to hers, there was no trace of coquetry in the invitation. He read the inscription, \"From Dan to Merridy,\" but had no realization of what it meant, for he glimpsed the milk-white flesh almost at his lips, and felt her breath stirring his hair, while the delicate scent of her person seemed to loose every strong emotion in him. She was so dainty and yet so virile, so innocent and yet so wise, so cold and yet so pulsating.  \"It is very pretty,\" he said, inanely.  At the look in his eyes as he raised his head her own widened, and she withdrew from him imperceptibly, dismissing him with a mere inflection.  \"I wish you would send Poleon here. It's time he saw his present.\"  As Burrell walked out into the air he shut his jaws grimly and muttered: \"Hold tight, young man. She's not your kind--she's not your kind.\"  Inside the store he found Doret and the trader in conversation with a man he had not met before, a ragged nondescript whose overalls were blue and faded and patched, particularly on the front of the legs above the knees, where a shovel-handle wears hardest; whose coat was of yellow mackinaw, the sleeves worn thin below the elbows, where they had rubbed against his legs in his work. As the soldier entered, the man turned on him a small, shrewd, weather-beaten face with one eye, while he went on talking to Gale.  \"It ain't nothin' to git excited over, but it's wuth follerin'. If I wasn't so cussed unlucky I'd know there was a pay streak som'ere close by.\"  \"Your luck is bound to change, Lee,\" said the trader, who helped him to roll up a pack of provisions.  \"Mebbe so. Who's the dressmaker?\" He jerked his bushy head towards Burrell, who had stopped at the front door with Poleon to examine some yellow grains in a folded paper.  \"He's the boss soldier.\"  \"Purty, ain't he?\"  \"If you ain't good he'll get you,\" said Gale, a trifle cynically, at which Lee chuckled.  \"I reckon there's several of us in camp that ain't been a whole lot too good,\" said he. \"Has he tried to git anybody yet?\"  \"No, but he's liable to. What would happen if he did? Suppose, for instance, he went after you--or me?\"  The one-eyed man snorted derisively. \"It ain't wuth considerin'!\"  \"Why not?\" insisted Gale, guardedly. \"Maybe I've got a record--you don't know.\"  \"If you have, don't tell me nothin' about it,\" hastily observed Lee. \"I'm a God-fearin' citizen myself, leanin' ever towards peace and quietudes, but what's past is dead and gone, and I'd hate to see a lispin' child like that blue-and-yeller party try to reezureck it.\"  \"He's got the American army to back him up--at least five of them.\"  \"Five agin a hundred. He aims to overawe us, don't he?\" snickered the unregenerate Lee, but his wrinkles changed and deepened as he leaned across the counter confidentially.  \"You say the word, John, and I'll"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4082"],["title","The Barrier (#7)"],["body"," take some feller along to help me, and we'll transfer this military post. There's plenty that would like the job if you give the wink.\"  \"Pshaw! I'm just supposing,\" said the trader. \"As long as they play around and drill and toot that horn, and don't bother anybody, I allow they're not in the way.\"  \"All right! It's up to you. However, if I happen to leap down on this pay streak before it sees me comin', I'm goin' to put my friends in first and foremost, and shut out these dressmakers complete. So long!\" He thrust his arms beneath the legs of a new pair of blue overalls that formed his pack-straps, wriggled the burden comfortably into place between his shoulders, and slouched out past Doret, to whom he nodded, ignoring the \"dressmaker.\"  Having given Necia's message to Poleon, the Lieutenant took up his business with the trader. It concerned the purchase of certain supplies that had been omitted from the military outfit, and when this was concluded he referred to the encounter of that morning.  \"I don't want you to think I bungle everything in that manner,\" he said, \"for I don't. I want to work with you, and I want to be friends with you.\"  \"I'm willing,\" said Gale.  \"Nobody dislikes playing policeman more than I do, but it's a part of my duty, and I'll have to do it,\" continued the young man.  \"I reckon you simply aim to keep peace, eh? You ain't lookin' for nobody in particular?\"  \"Of course not--outside of certain notorious criminals who have escaped justice and worked north.\"  \"Then there is a few that you want, eh?\"  \"Yes, certain old-timers. The officers at every post have descriptions of a few such, and if they show up we will take them in and hold them till courts are established.\"  \"If you've got their names and descriptions, mebbe I could help you,\" said the trader, carelessly.  \"Thank you, I'll bring up the list and we'll go over it together. You must have been here a good while.\"  \"About ten years.\"  \"Then Miss Necia was born out in the States?\"  Gale shot a startled glance at the soldier before he answered in the affirmative, but Burrell was studying a pattern of sunlight on the floor and did not observe him. A moment later he inquired, hesitatingly:  \"Is this your first marriage, Mr. Gale?\" When the other did not answer, he looked up and quickly added:  \"I beg your pardon, sir. What led me to ask was Miss Necia--she is so--well--she is such a remarkable girl.\"  Gale's face had undergone a change, but he answered, quietly:  \"I 'ain't never been married.\"  \"What?\"  \"When I took Alluna it wasn't the style, and neither one of us has thought much about it since.\"  \"Oh, I see,\" exclaimed Burrell, hurriedly. \"I'll bring that list with me the first time I think about it,\" and, nodding amiably, he sauntered out. But his mind was in a whirl, and even after he had reached his quarters he found himself repeating:  \"The other was bad enough. Poor little girl! Poor little girl!\"  Gale likewise left the store and went into his house, the odd look still strong in his eyes, to find Necia posing in her new regalia for Poleon's benefit. At sight of her he fell into a strange and unexpected humor, and to their amazement commanded her roughly to take the things off. His voice and manner were harsh and at utter variance with any mood he had ever displayed before; nor would he explain his unreasoning fury, but strode out again, leaving her in tears and the Frenchman staring.     CHAPTER IV  THE SOLDIER FINDS AN UNTRODDEN VALLEY   During the weeks that followed Meade Burrell saw much of Necia. At first he had leaned on the excuse that he wanted to study the curious freak of heredity she presented; but that wore out quickly, and he let himself drift, content with the pleasure of her company and happy in the music of her laughter. Her quick wit and keen humor delighted him, and the mystery of her dark eyes seemed to hold the poetry and beauty of all the red races that lay behind her on the maternal side. At times he thought of her as he had seen her that morning in the dance-girl's dress, and remembered the purity of neck and breast it had displayed, but he attributed that to the same prank of heritage that had endowed her with other traits alien to her mother's race.  He had experienced a profound sense of pity for her upon learning her father's relation to Alluna, but this also largely vanished when he found that the girl was entirely oblivious to its significance. He had tried her in many subtle ways, and found that she regarded the matter innocently, as customary, and therefore in the light of an accepted convention; nor did she seem to see anything in her blood or station to render her inferior to other women. She questioned him tirelessly about his sister, and he was glad of this, for it placed no constraint between them. So that, as he explored her many quaint beliefs and pagan superstitions, the delight of being with her grew, and he ceased to reason whither it might lead him.  As for her, each day brought a keener delight. She unfolded before the Kentuckian like some beautiful woodland flower, and through innumerable, unnoticed familiarities took him into her innermost confidence, sharing with him those girlish hopes and beliefs and aspirations she had never voiced till now.  A month of this went by, and then Runnion returned. He came on an up-going steamer which panted in for a rest from its thousand-mile climb, and for breath to continue its fight against the never-tiring sweep of waters. The manner of his coming was bold, for he stood fairly upon the ship's deck, staring at the growing picture of the town, as he had watched it recede a month before, and his smile was evil now, as it had been then. With him was a stranger. When the boat was at rest Runnion sauntered down the gang-plank and up to the Lieutenant, who stood above the landing-place, and who noted that the scar, close up against his hat-band, was scarce healed. He accosted the officer with an insolent assurance.  \"Well, I'm back again, you see, and I'm back to stay.\"  \"Very well, Runnion; did you bring an outfit with you?\" The young man addressed him civilly, although he felt that the fellow's presence was a menace and would lead to trouble.  \"Yes, and I'm pretty fat besides.\" He shook a well-laden gold-sack at the officer. \"I reckon I can rustle thirteen dollars a month most anywhere, if I'm left alone.\"  \"What do you want in this place, anyhow?\" demanded Burrell, curiously.  \"None of your damned business,\" the man answered, grinning.  \"Be sure it isn't,\" retorted the Lieutenant, \"because it would please me right down to the ground if it were. I'd like to get you.\"  \"I'm glad we understand each other,\" Runnion said, and turned to oversee the unloading of his freight, falling into conversation with the stranger, who had been surveying the town without leaving the boat. Evidently this man had a voice in Runnion's affairs, for he not only gave him instructions, but bossed the crew who handled his merchandise, and Meade Burrell concluded that he must be some incoming tenderfoot who had grub-staked the desperado to prospect in the hills back of Flambeau. As the two came up past him he saw that he was mistaken--this man was no more of a tenderfoot than Runnion; on the contrary, he had the bearing of one to whom new countries are old, who had trod the edge of things all his life. There was a hint of the meat-eating animal about him; his nose was keen and hawk-like, his walk and movements those of the predatory beast, and as he passed by, Burrell observed that his eyes were of a peculiar cruelty that went well with his thin lips. He was older by far than Runnion, but, while the latter was mean-visaged and swaggering, the stranger's manner was noticeable for its repression.  Impelled by an irresistible desire to learn something about the man, the Lieutenant loitered after Runnion and his companion, and entered the store in time to see the latter greet \"No Creek\" Lee, the prospector, who had come into town for more food. Both men spoke with quiet restraint.  \"Nine years since I saw you, Stark,\" said the miner. \"Where you bound?\"  \"The diggings,\" replied Stark, as Lee addressed the stranger.  \"Mining now?\"  \"No, same old thing, but I'm grub-staking a few men, as usual. One of them stays here. I may open a house in Dawson if the camp is as good as they say it is.\"  \"This here's a good place for you.\"  Stark laughed noiselessly and without mirth. \"Fine! There must be a hundred people living here.\"  \"Never mind, you take it from me,\" said the miner, positively, \"and get in now on the quiet. There's something doing.\" His one sharp eye detected the Lieutenant close by, so he drew his friend aside and began talking to him earnestly and with such evident effect as to alter Stark's plans on the moment; for when Runnion entered the store shortly Stark spoke to him quickly, following which they both hurried back to the steamer and saw to the unloading of much additional freight and baggage. From the volume and variety of this merchandise, it was evident that Mr. Stark would in no wise be a burden to the community.  Burrell was not sufficiently versed in the ways of mining-camps to know exactly what this abrupt change of policy meant, but that there was something in the air he knew from the mysterious manner of \"No Creek\" Lee and from the suppressed excitement of Doret and the trader. His curiosity got the better of him finally, and he fell into talk with Lee, inquiring about the stranger by way of an opening.  \"That's Ben Stark. I knew him back in the Cassiar country,\" said Lee.  \"Is he a mining man?\"  \"Well, summat. He's made and lost a bank-roll that a greyhound couldn't leap over in the mining business, but it ain't his reg'lar graft. He run one of the biggest places in the Northwest for years.\"  \"Saloon, eh?\"  \"Saloon and variety house--seven bartenders, that's all. He's the feller that killed the gold-commissioner. Of course, that put him on the hike again.\"  \""]]]
