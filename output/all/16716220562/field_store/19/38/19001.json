Amer. Fauna, 31:37, October 19, 1910), which were assigned to _Neotoma albigula leucodon_ (type locality, city of San Luis Potosí, México). Additional specimens from southwestern Tamaulipas, obtained in recent years by representatives of the Museum of Natural History, along with specimens from parts of Nuevo León and Coahuila, represent an unnamed subspecies, which is named and described as follows:   =Neotoma albigula subsolana= new subspecies       _Type._--Male, adult, skin and skull, No. 56950, Museum of Natural      History, The University of Kansas, from Miquihuana, 6400 ft.,      Tamaulipas; obtained on July 20, 1953, by Gerd H. Heinrich,      original number 7553B.       _Geographic distribution._--Sierra Madre Oriental from southeastern      Coahuila to southwestern Tamaulipas.       _Diagnosis._--Over-all size small for species (see measurements),      but tail, maxillary tooth-row and incisive foramina relatively      long; upper parts dark (individual hairs banded subterminally with      cinnamon and tipped with grayish, yielding an over-all color of      grayish brown); lips gray, especially anteriorly and medially;      alveoli of incisors narrow (4.8-5.2); posterior branch of      premaxilla extending only slightly behind nasals; rostrum short;      braincase broad; mastoid breadth averaging 51.1 (47.8-52.7) per      cent of basilar length.       _Comparisons._--_Neotoma albigula subsolana_, differs from      topotypes of _N. a. leucodon_, the subspecies geographically      adjacent to the southwest, as follows: size smaller, especially      length of palatal bridge (6.9-8.1 instead of 8.2-9.6), alveolar      length of maxillary tooth-row (8.3-8.9 instead of 8.8-9.7), and      greatest length of auditory bulla (7.3-7.9 instead of 8.2-8.9);      mastoid breadth relatively greater, 51.1 (47.8-52.7) instead of      47.0 (45.5-49.1) per cent of basilar length; posterior process of      premaxilla extending only slightly beyond posterior border of      nasals; auditory bulla conspicuously smaller; upper parts darker,      especially middorsally; over-all color grayish instead of      ochraceous or yellowish; lips gray instead of nearly white.       _Neotoma albigula subsolana_ differs from _N. a. albigula_,      geographically adjacent to the northwest (specimens from Pima      County, Arizona) as follows: size averaging slightly larger, except      length of nasals; mastoid breadth averaging 18.8 (17.9-20.2)      instead of 17.9 (17.7-18.2), its ratio to basilar length therefore      greater, 51.1 (47.8-52.7) instead of 49.4 (47.9-50.0); zygomatic      arches expanded posteriorly instead of nearly parallel as in      _albigula_; interparietal longer and narrower; mesopterygoid fossa      broader; auditory bulla slightly smaller; upper parts distinctly      darker.  _Remarks._--_N. a. subsolana_ is characterized by the combination of small size, dark color, small auditory bulla and relatively broad braincase. Typical specimens have been collected only at higher elevations in the Sierra Madre Oriental where no other species of _Neotoma_ is known to occur.  Intergradation between _N. a. subsolana_ and _N. a. leucodon_ occurs at lower elevations on the west side of the Sierra Madre Oriental as shown by specimens from nine miles southwest of Tula, Tamaulipas, and Sierra Guadalupe, Coahuila, from which places some specimens are paler than others, approaching _leucodon_ in color, and are slightly larger than typical _subsolana_. Specimens assigned to _leucodon_ from vicinity of Presa Guadalupe and from 1 to 6 kilometers south of Matehuala, San Luis Potosí, are typical of that subspecies in measurements but are darker than topotypes.  _N. a. subsolana_ intergrades with _N. a. albigula_ in southeastern Coahuila (specimens from 6 to 9 miles east of Hermanas and from Panuco) where some individuals average paler and smaller than topotypes of _subsolana_ and some have skulls that combine characters of _subsolana_ and _albigula_. These specimens, which were referred to _N. a. leucodon_ by Baker (Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:281-282, June 15, 1956), are assigned to _subsolana_ on the basis of relatively dark upperparts and broad mesopterygoid fossa (narrow in only one specimen).  On geographic grounds, specimens not studied by me from Municipio de Galeana, Nuevo León (Koestner, Great Basin Nat., 2:13, 1941), and those from Jaumave, Tamaulipas (Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 31:37, October 19, 1910), probably are referable to _N. a. subsolana_.  The subspecific name _subsolana_ (Latin adjective for eastern) is proposed for this woodrat because of its eastern geographic occurrence.       _Measurements._--Average and extreme measurements of nine topotypes      (6 males and 3 females) are as follows: total length, 338      (315-370); length of tail-vertebrae, 157 (130-182); length of hind      foot, 35 (33-37); length of ear from notch, 31 (29-34); basilar      length, 36.5 (34.7-39.2); zygomatic breadth, 23.9 (22.5-25.0);      interorbital constriction, 5.5 (5.7-6.2); length of nasals, 15.5      (15.2-16.5); length of incisive foramina, 9.4 (8.8-10.1); length of      palatal bridge, 7.7 (6.9-8.1); alveolar length of maxillary      tooth-row, 8.7 (8.3-8.9); length of auditory bulla, 7.6 (7.3-7.9);      mastoid breadth, 18.7 (17.9-20.2).       _Specimens examined._--A total of 124 (all from Mus.

[Illustration: LETTER.]  [Illustration: LETTER CONTINUED.]                          PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION.   A member of the scientific corps attached to the Expedition, which, under the auspices of that enlightened friend of science and liberty, the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian, was despatched on a voyage round the globe, the high honour has been conferred upon me of having entrusted to my care the publication of the Narrative of our Cruise.  In this not more difficult than enviable task, I have been most liberally assisted by my eminent fellow-labourers--the whole literary material collected during the voyage having been kindly placed at my disposal. The comprehensive journals and reports of the venerable Commander-in-Chief of the Expedition, Commodore Wullerstorff-Urbair, as well as the various memoranda of the other members of the Scientific Commission, contributed materially to the elucidation of my own general notes, as well as my observations upon special subjects, which latter chiefly referred to the Geography, Ethnography, and general Statistics of the various countries visited.  While preparing the details of our voyage for publication in my own language, the idea perpetually presented itself that a translation of this narrative into English might prove not unacceptable to the British public. And although fully aware that a voyage round the globe, in the course of which little more than the coasts were visited of the various countries we touched at, could not pretend to offer much new information to the greatest of maritime nations, it seemed, nevertheless, that it might interest a people so eager in the pursuit of knowledge as the English, to know the impression which has been made upon travellers of education by the Colonies and Settlements of Britain throughout the world.  The English language, moreover, being spoken more or less over the greater part of the earth's surface, geographically speaking, the author who addresses his readers in that tongue is sustained by the flattering conviction that he will be understood by the majority of the nations of the globe! For it is not alone the educated classes of all countries that seek to master a language which possesses such a grand--all but unrivalled literature! The political and commercial development which Great Britain enjoys under the benign influence of liberal institutions, has made English the medium of intercourse among almost all sea-faring nations; nay, even barbarous tribes find it their obvious interest to get a slight inkling at least of the language of a people whose civilizing and elevating energies they may not, it is true, understand, far less appreciate, but whose imposing power inspires them with awe, while they are more closely attached by the tie of material advantage.  The following narrative describes the most important occurrences and most lasting impressions of a voyage during which we traversed 51,686 miles, visited twenty-five different places, and spent 551 days at sea, and 298 at anchor or on shore.  As the purely scientific results of the Expedition will be published separately under the supervision of Commodore Wullerstorf and the other members of the scientific corps, I shall, in this place, only attempt to place before the reader a general outline of the countries and races visited during our cruise in different regions of the world.  In relating simply and concisely what was seen and experienced, I have endeavoured to avoid incurring the reproach, so frequently launched by English critics against German works of travel, of dryness and minute detail, such as render them distasteful to the English reader, and make it almost impossible to enlist his attention or evoke his sympathy.  If, as is specially the case with respect to natural science, many a doubtful point still remains undecided--if the ingenious \"Suggestions\" of the immortal Alexander von Humboldt (for the translation of which I feel particularly indebted to that profound scholar, my learned and esteemed friend Mr. Haidinger, whose name will be familiar to the scientific world in Great Britain), could not be acted upon to the extent and in the effectual manner each of us could have wished, the reason for such deficiencies will be found in the peculiar mission of the Expedition, and in the arrangement of our route, which was specially laid out with reference to the numerous and widely different objects, which it was specially intended to keep in view throughout the voyage.  Among the more prominent of these, may be specified the opportunity thus afforded for the practical instruction of our young and rapidly-increasing navy; the unfurling of the Imperial flag of Austria in those distant climes, where it had never before floated; the promulgation of commercial treaties; the aid afforded to science in exploration and investigation, as well as by the collection of those objects of Natural History, the acquisition of which is all but impossible to the solitary naturalist, owing to the expense and difficulty of transport,[1] and the establishment everywhere of friendly correspondence between our own scientific institutions and those in remote regions, I have considered it necessary to invite the attention of the British reading public to these circumstances, in order to make them more intimately cognisant of our various and manifold tasks, and thus make them the more readily disposed to overlook the deficiencies and discrepancies of this book, which I now respectfully commit to their perusal.  [Footnote 1: Notwithstanding the short period at our disposal at each port, which concomitant necessity militates so much against the practical utility of a circumnavigation of the globe as compared with an expedition solely directed to one single centre of scientific observation, the collection of objects of Natural History made during the cruise are very extensive, and unusually rich in new or rare species. The zoological department alone embraces above 23,700 individuals of different kinds of animals: viz. 440 mammalia, 300 reptiles, 1500 birds, 1400 _Amphibiæ_, 1330 fish, 9000 insects, 8900 Molluscs and _Crustaceæ_, 300 birds' eggs and nests, besides numerous skeletons. The botanical collection consists of _Herbaria_, seeds of useful plants, special regard being had to those best adapted for the various climates of the respective Austrian provinces, drugs, specimens of dye-woods, and timber, fruits preserved in alcohol, &c. The Geological and Palæontological Museums of our country have likewise been enriched with various rare and valuable specimens, particularly in consequence of Dr. Hochstetter, the geologist of the Expedition, having prolonged his stay in New Zealand, where, at the special request of the Colonial Government, he explored the province of Auckland. The Ethnographical and Anthropological collection consists of above 550 objects, among which are 100 skulls, representing the craniology of almost all the races of the globe.]  Before concluding, I beg leave to express my hearty thanks to all those who have contributed in such various ways to aid my humble efforts--to specify some were invidious, as in so doing I must wrong others."]]]
