Sherry and the boys must see it. I have to go and get lunch started now, but all of you come together after lunch and I’ll read it out loud to you.”  “We’ll all help,” said Migwan, “and then we’ll get through faster,” and the Winnebagos hurried downstairs in Nyoda’s wake.                                    CHAPTER VI                           UNCLE JASPER’S DIARY   After lunch the Winnebagos and the boys gathered around Nyoda in Uncle Jasper’s study to hear her read aloud from “The Diery of Jasper M. Carver, Esqwire.” She held the book up that all might see the portraits of the fearsome pirates, and then turned over to the next page, where the sprawly, uneven writing began, and started to read.    “October 7, 1870. Confined to the house through bad behavior while   father and mother have gone to the fair. I wasn’t lonesome though   because I had company. A boy ran into the yard chasing a cat and saw me   sticking my head out of the upstairs window and blew a bean shooter at   me and hit me on the chin and I hit him with an apple core and then he   dared me to come out and lick him but I couldn’t go out of the house so   I dared him to climb up the porch post and come in the window. He came   and I licked him. He is a new boy in town and his name is Sydney   Phillips, but he wants to be called Tad. He lives up on Harrison Hill.   We are going to be pirates when we grow up. I am going to be Jasper the   Feend and he is going to be Tad the Terror. We swore eternul frendship   and wrote our names in blood on the attic window sill.”  “Oh, how delicious!” cried Sahwah at the end of the first entry. “Your uncle must have been lots of fun when he was young. What crazy things boys are, anyway! To start out by fighting each other and end up by swearing eternal friendship! Go on, Nyoda, what did they do next?”  Nyoda proceeded.    “November 10, 1870. Tad and I made a great discovery this afternoon.   There is a secret passage in this house. It is——”  The concerted shriek of triumph that went up from the Winnebagos forced Nyoda to pause.  “I told you there was!” shouted Sahwah above the rest. “Please hurry and read where it is, I can’t wait another minute!”  Nyoda turned the page and then paused. “The next page is torn out,” she said, holding the book up so they could all see the ragged strip of paper left hanging in the binding, where the page had been torn out.  “Oh, what a shame!” The wail rose on every side.  “Maybe it tells later,” said Sahwah hopefully. “Go on, Nyoda.” The dairy continued on a page numbered six.    “January 4, 1871. Tad and I played pirat to-day. We made a pirat’s den   in the secret passage. We are going to hide our chests of money there,   all pieces of eight. We haven’t any pieces of eight yet just some red,   white and blue dollars we found in the desk drawer in the library. Tad   thinks maybe they are patriotick curency they used in the Revolushun”  Nyoda had to wait a minute until Sherry had got done laughing, and then she proceeded:    “February 19, 1871. I am in durrance vile, being locked in my room for   a week with nothing to eat but bread and water because I shut Patricia   up in the secret passage and went away and forgot all about her because   there was a fire. I remembered and let her out as soon as I got home   but she had fainted, being a silly girl and afraid of the dark, and she   couldn’t scream because we tied a handkerchief over her mouth when we   kidnapped her, being pirats. So now I am in durrance vile and cannot   see any of my family, not even Tad. But he stands behind the hedge and   shoots pieces of candy through my window with the bean shooter and   lightens my durrance vile which is what a sworn frend has to do when   their names are written in blood on the attic window sill.”  Thus the entries in the scrawling, boyish hand covered page after page, recounting the adventurous and ofttimes seamy career of the two youthful pirates, through all of which the two stood up for each other stanchly, and never, never gave each other away, because they were “sworn frends till deth us do part,” and their names were “written in blood on the attic window sill.”  The entries became farther apart after a while, and the spelling improved until finally there came this announcement:    “Tad and I can’t be pirates any longer. We are going to college next   week.”  There the India ink ceased and also the illustrations. After that came page after page of neat entries in faded but still legible blue ink, telling of the progress through college of the two boys; chronicles of the joys, the troubles, the triumphs and the escapades of the two friends, still so inseparable that their names have become a byword among the students and they go by the nickname of David and Jonathan. When one of them gets into trouble the other one still does “what a sworn friend has to do when their names are written in blood on the attic window sill.” The Winnebagos listened with shining eyes while Nyoda read the tale of this remarkable friendship.  The dates of the entries moved forward by months; records of scrapes became fewer and fewer; David and Jonathan had outgrown their colthood and were beginning to win honors with brain and brawn. Then came the record of their graduation and return to Oakwood; of “Tad the Terror” becoming a doctor, of the marriage of Jasper’s sister Patricia to a sea captain; the death of his father and the passing of Carver House into his possession.  Later came the account of a delightful year spent abroad with Tad Phillips, of mountain climbing in the Alps; of browsing among rare old art treasures in France and Italy; of gay larks in Paris. It was always he and Tad, he and Tad; still as loyal to each other as in the days when they wrote their names in blood on the attic window sill.  After the entry which chronicled Jasper’s return to Oakland and settling down in Carver House with his mother, and his enthusiastic adoption of literature as a profession, came an item which made the Winnebagos sit up and listen. It was:    “June 3, 1885. I have had a new window put into my study on the side   which faces toward’s Tad’s house on Harrisburg Hill. I had the young   Italian artist, Pusini, who has lately come to New York, come and set   the glass for me. It is a representation of a charming scene I came   across in Italy—an arched gateway covered over with climbing roses. The   window is arranged so that through the arch of the gateway I can look   directly at Tad’s house. It gives me inspiration in my work.”  “What a beautiful idea!” said Hinpoha, carried away completely by the great love of Jasper Carver for his friend, so simply expressed in his diary.  “So that was Tad’s house, that we are living in!” said Sylvia excitedly. “I wonder where he is now.”  “Go on reading, Nyoda,” said Sahwah, consumed with interest in the tale. “See if he says anything about the shutter.” Nyoda passed on to the next entry.    “June 27, 1885. Went to the Academy of Music in Philadelphia to hear   Sylvia Warrington sing. She is the new singer from the South that has   created such a furore. The Virginia Nightingale, they call her. What a   God-gifted woman she is! There never was such a voice as hers. She sang   ‘Hark, hark, the lark,’ and the whole house rose to its feet. She was   Spring incarnate. Sylvia Warrington! The name itself is music. I cannot   forget her. She is like a lark singing in the desert at dawning.”  A vague remembrance leaped up for an instant in Katherine’s mind and died as it came.  Nyoda read on through pages that recorded Uncle Jasper’s meeting with Sylvia Warrington; his great and growing love for her; his persistent wooing, her consenting to marry him; his wild happiness, which found vent in page after page of rapturous plans for the future. Then came the announcement of Tad’s return from a period of study abroad, and Uncle Jasper’s proud presentation of his bride-to-be. After that Tad’s name appeared in connection with every occasion, still the faithful David to his beloved Jonathan.  Then, almost without warning, the great friendship ran on the rocks and was shattered. For Tad no sooner saw Sylvia Warrington than he too, fell madly in love with her. A brief and bitter entry told how she finally broke her engagement to Uncle Jasper and married Tad, and how Uncle Jasper, beside himself with grief and disappointment, turned against his friend and hated him with the undying hate that is born of jealousy. With heavy strokes of the pen that cut the paper he wrote down his determination to have no more friends and to live to himself thereafter. Then, in a shaky hand in marked contrast to the fierce strokes just above, he wrote: “But Sylvia—I love her still. I can’t help it.” That shaky handwriting stood as a mute testimonial to his heart’s torment, and Nyoda, reading it after all these years, felt a sympathetic spasm of pain pass through her own heart at the sight of that wavering entry.  “It’s just like a story in a book!” exclaimed Hinpoha, furtively drying her eyes, which had overflowed during the reading of the last page. “The beautiful lady, and the rival lovers, and the disappointed one never marrying. Oh, it’s too romantic for anything! Oh, _please_ hurry and read what comes next.”  Nyoda turned the page and read the brief entry:    “I have taken up the study of ancient history as a serious pursuit. In   it I hope to find forgetfulness.”  The eyes of the Winnebagos traveled to the bookcase, and now they knew why there was nothing there but dull old books in heavy bindings, and why Uncle Jasper Carver hated love stories.  The next entry had them all sitting up again.    “I have had Hercules fasten an iron shutter over the window in my   study—the one through which I can see Tad’s house when I sit at my   desk. I cannot bear to look at anything that reminds me of him.”  “There!” shouted all the Winnebagos at once. “_That_"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38983"],["title","The Camp Fire Girls Solve a Mystery; Or, The Christmas Adventure at Carver House (#8)"],["body"," was the reason for putting up the iron shutter! The mystery is solved!”  “Poor Uncle Jasper!” said Nyoda pityingly. “What a Spartan he was! How thoroughly he set about removing every memory of Tad from his mind! Think of covering up that beautiful pane of glass because he couldn’t bear to look through it at the house of his friend!” She finished reading the entry:    “Hercules demurred at covering up the window—he admired it more than   anything else in the house—so to give him a satisfactory reason for   doing so I told him the devil would come in through that gateway some   day and I was putting up the shutter to keep him out. There’s one thing   sure; Hercules will never take that shutter down as long as he   lives—he’s scared nearly into a Chinaman.”  “So that’s why Hercules threw such a fit when we took the shutter off!” said Sherry. “He thought that now the devil would come in and get him. Poor, superstitious old nigger!”  “I wonder if Tad and Sylvia went to live in the house on Harrisburg Hill,” said Sahwah curiously. “He doesn’t say whether they did or not.”  “Oh, I wonder if they did!” cried Sylvia, with eager interest. “To think I’ve been living in the same house they lived in—if they _did_ live there,” she added. “But how strange it seems to hear them call that place Harrisburg Hill. It is called Main Street Hill now.”  “I wonder what Tad and Sylvia did after they were married,” said Hinpoha, with romantic curiosity. “Did they stay in Oakwood, or did they go away? Is there any more, Nyoda?”  Nyoda was already glancing down the next page, which was written over with lines in blacker ink, and broader and heavier strokes of the pen, which seemed somehow to express grim satisfaction on the part of Uncle Jasper. Grim satisfaction Uncle Jasper must indeed have felt when he wrote those lines, for misfortune had overtaken the one who had caused his own anguish of heart. The entry told how Tad had become staff physician at one of the large army posts in the west. There was an epidemic of typhoid and quite a few of the men were ill at once, all requiring the same kind of medicine. Through carelessness in making up a certain medicine he put in a deadly poison instead of the harmless ingredient he intended to put in, and a dozen men died of the dose. There was a tremendous stir about the matter, and the newspapers all over the country were full of it. He was court-martialed, and though he was acquitted, the mistake being entirely accidental, the matter had gained such publicity that his career as a doctor was ruined. He left the army and fled out of the country, taking Sylvia with him. Some months later the papers brought the announcement of both their deaths from yellow fever in Cuba. Again the handwriting began to waver on the last sentence. “She is dead.” In those three little words the Winnebagos seemed to hear the echo of the breaking of a strong man’s heart. There were no more entries.  “Isn’t it perfectly _thrilling_!” gulped Hinpoha, with eyes overflowing again. “It’s better than any book I ever read! And to think we never suspected there was anything like that connected with your Uncle Jasper! There, now, Katherine Adams, what did I tell you? You said he was a born bachelor, and just look at the romance he had!”  “He certainly did,” said Katherine, in a tone of surrender.  “That must be why the house we lived in was shut up so long,” said Sylvia musingly. “The man that said we could live in it said that old Mrs. Phillips had moved away many years ago and had never come back, and although people knew she was dead, no one had ever come to live in the house, and nobody in Oakwood knew who owned it. The man said he had heard from older people in the town that Mrs. Phillips had had a son who was away from home all the time after he was grown up and who had gotten into some kind of trouble—he couldn’t remember what it was. This must have been it! How queer it is, that I should first come to live in Tad’s house, and then stay in the house of his friend! I never dreamed, when I heard that man telling Aunt Aggie about the almost forgotten people that used to live in the old house, that I should ever hear of them again. Things have turned out to be _so_ interesting since I came to stay in the Winter Palace!” she finished up with sparkling eyes.  Darkness had fallen by the time Nyoda had finished reading Uncle Jasper’s Diary, and she jumped up with a little exclamation as the clock on the mantel-piece chimed six. The other hours had struck unnoticed. “Mercy!” she cried, “it’s time dinner was on the table, and here we haven’t even begun to get it! I forgot all about dinner, thinking about poor Uncle Jasper.”  All the rest had forgotten about dinner, too, and the Winnebagos could not get their minds off the tale they had just heard read. “Poor Uncle Jasper!” they all said, looking up at his picture, and to their pitying eyes his face was no longer grim and stern, but only pathetic.                                   CHAPTER VII                              SYLVIA’S STORY   “Katherine Adams, whatever has happened to you?” asked Gladys suddenly, meeting her under the bright light in the hall that evening after dinner.  “Why?” asked Katherine, looking startled. “Is there any soot on my face?”  “No,” replied Gladys with a peal of laughter, “I didn’t mean anything like that. I meant that you look different from the way you used to look, that’s all. You’ve changed since the days when I first knew you. What have you done to yourself in the last year? You’re the same old Katherine, of course, but you’re different, somehow. I noticed it when you first came to Brownell last fall, but I’ve been too busy to give it much thought. But since we’ve been here I’ve been watching you and I can’t help noticing the difference. Now stand right there under that light and let me look at you.”  Katherine laughed good humoredly and stood still dutifully while Gladys inspected her with appraising eyes that took in all the little improvements in Katherine’s appearance. She was heavier than she used to be; some of her angles were softened into curves. She now stood erect, with her head up and her shoulders thrown back, which made her look several inches taller. Her hair no longer hung about her face in stringy wisps; the loose ends were curled becomingly around her temples and ears and held in place with invisible hairpins. She wore a trim worsted dress of an odd shade of blue, which was just the right shade to go with her dull blonde hair and with the dark brown of her neat shoes. Her knuckles were no longer red and rough; her fingernails were manicured; the sagging spectacles of the old days had given way to intellectual looking nose glasses with narrow tortoise shell rims.  “Well, what’s the verdict?” asked Katherine, smiling broadly at Gladys.  “You’re wonderful!” said Gladys enthusiastically. “You’re actually stunning! Whoever told you to get that particular shade of blue to bring out the color of your hair?”  “Nobody told me,” answered Katherine. “I bought it because it was a bargain.” But there was a knowing twinkle in her eyes which gave her dead away, and Gladys, seeing it, knew that Katherine had at last achieved that pride of appearance which she had struggled so long to instill into her.  “However did you do it?” she murmured.  “It was your eleven Rules of Neatness that did it,” replied Katherine, laughing, “or was it seven? I forget. But I did do just the things you told me to do, and it worked. There is no longer any danger of my coming apart in public! What a trial I used to be to you, though!” she said, flushing a little at the recollection. “How you ever put up with me I don’t know. How _did_ you stand it, anyway?”  “Because we loved you, sweet child,” replied Gladys fondly, “and because we all believed the motto, ‘While there’s life, there’s hope.’ We knew you would be a paragon of neatness some day as soon as you got around to it. You never _could_ think of more than one thing at a time, Katherine dear!”  “O my, O my, look at them hugging each other!” exclaimed a teasing voice from above. Looking up they saw Justice Dalrymple leaning over the banisters at the head of the stairs. “You never do that to me,” he continued in a plaintive tone.  Katherine and Gladys merely laughed at him and walked on, arm in arm, and Justice came down the stairs wringing mock tears out of his handkerchief and singing mournfully,    “Forsaken, forsa-ken,   Forsa-a-a-ken a-m I,   Like the bones at a banquet   All men pass me-e-e by!”  “Do behave yourself, Justice,” said Katherine with mock severity. “If you disgrace me I’ll never get you invited anywhere again. Why can’t you be good like the other two boys?”  “’Cause I’m a Junebug,” warbled Justice, to the tune of “I’m a Pilgrim,”    “’Cause I’m a Junebug,   And I’m a beetul,   And I can’t be no   Rhinoscerairus,   ’Cause I’m a Junebug,   And I’m a beetul,   I can’t be no,   Rhinoscerairus!”  He advanced into the drawing room, where Katherine now stood alone, and drew out the last syllable of his absurd song into a long bleating wail that sent her into convulsions of laughter till the tears rolled down her cheeks.    “Tears, idle tears——”  began Justice, picking up a vase from the table and holding it under her eyes, and then he stopped, as if struck by a sudden recollection. “I said that to you once before,” he said, “don’t you remember? The first time we really got acquainted with each other. You were standing by the stove, weeping into the apple sauce.”  “It was pudding,” Katherine corrected him, with a little shamefaced laugh at the remembrance, “huckleberry pudding. And I streaked it all over my face and you nearly died laughing.”  “Well, you laughed too,” Justice defended himself, “and that’s how we got to be friends.”  “That seems ages ago,” said Katherine, “and yet it’s only a little over a year. What a year that was!”  Both stopped their bantering and looked at each other with sober eyes,"]]]
