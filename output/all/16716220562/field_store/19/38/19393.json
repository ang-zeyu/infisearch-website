But it's a book we like to handle.\"  Everybody likes to be taken into the details of technical business; and of course everybody likes to know that a bookseller is losing money.  These, I realised, were two axioms in the methods of Mr. Sellyer.  So very naturally Mrs. Rasselyer bought Among the Monkeys, and in another moment Mr. Sellyer was directing a clerk to write down an address on Fifth Avenue, and was bowing deeply as he showed the lady out of the door.  As he turned back to his counter his manner seemed much changed.  \"That Monkey book,\" I heard him murmur to his assistant, \"is going to be a pretty stiff proposition.\"  But he had no time for further speculation.  Another lady entered.  This time even to an eye less trained than Mr. Sellyer's, the deep, expensive mourning and the pensive face proclaimed the sentimental widow.  \"Something new in fiction,\" repeated the manager, \"yes, madam--here's a charming thing--Golden Dreams\"--he hung lovingly on the words--\"a very sweet story, singularly sweet; in fact, madam, the critics are saying it is the sweetest thing that Mr. Slush has done.\"  \"Is it good?\" said the lady. I began to realise that all customers asked this.  \"A charming book,\" said the manager. \"It's a love story--very simple and sweet, yet wonderfully charming. Indeed, the reviews say it's the most charming book of the month. My wife was reading it aloud only last night. She could hardly read for tears.\"  \"I suppose it's quite a safe book, is it?\" asked the widow. \"I want it for my little daughter.\"  \"Oh, quite safe,\" said Mr. Sellyer, with an almost parental tone, \"in fact, written quite in the old style, like the dear old books of the past--quite like\"--here Mr. Sellyer paused with a certain slight haze of doubt visible in his eye--\"like Dickens and Fielding and Sterne and so on. We sell a great many to the clergy, madam.\"  The lady bought Golden Dreams, received it wrapped up in green enamelled paper, and passed out.  \"Have you any good light reading for vacation time?\" called out the next customer in a loud, breezy voice--he had the air of a stock broker starting on a holiday.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Sellyer, and his face almost broke into a laugh as he answered, \"here's an excellent thing--Golden Dreams--quite the most humorous book of the season--simply screaming--my wife was reading it aloud only yesterday. She could hardly read for laughing.\"  \"What's the price, one dollar? One-fifty.  All right, wrap it up.\" There was a clink of money on the counter, and the customer was gone. I began to see exactly where professors and college people who want copies of Epictetus at 18 cents and sections of World Reprints of Literature at 12 cents a section come in, in the book trade.  \"Yes, Judge!\" said the manager to the next customer, a huge, dignified personage in a wide-awake hat, \"sea stories? Certainly. Excellent reading, no doubt, when the brain is overcharged as yours must be. Here is the very latest--Among the Monkeys of New Guinea, ten dollars, reduced to four-fifty. The manufacture alone costs six-eighty. We're selling it out. Thank you, Judge. Send it? Yes. Good morning.\"  After that the customers came and went in a string. I noticed that though the store was filled with books--ten thousand of them, at a guess--Mr. Sellyer was apparently only selling two. Every woman who entered went away with Golden Dreams: every man was given a copy of the Monkeys of New Guinea. To one lady Golden Dreams was sold as exactly the reading for a holiday, to another as the very book to read AFTER a holiday; another bought it as a book for a rainy day, and a fourth as the right sort of reading for a fine day. The Monkeys was sold as a sea story, a land story, a story of the jungle, and a story of the mountains, and it was put at a price corresponding to Mr. Sellyer's estimate of the purchaser.  At last after a busy two hours, the store grew empty for a moment.  \"Wilfred,\" said Mr. Sellyer, turning to his chief assistant, \"I am going out to lunch. Keep those two books running as hard as you can.  We'll try them for another day and then cut them right out. And I'll drop round to Dockem & Discount, the publishers, and make a kick about them, and see what they'll do.\"  I felt that I had lingered long enough. I drew near with the Epictetus in my hand.  \"Yes, sir,\" said Mr. Sellyer, professional again in a moment. \"Epictetus? A charming thing. Eighteen cents. Thank you. Perhaps we have some other things there that might interest you. We have a few second-hand things in the alcove there that you might care to look at. There's an Aristotle, two volumes--a very fine thing--practically illegible, that you might like: and a Cicero came in yesterday--very choice--damaged by damp--and I think we have a Machiavelli, quite exceptional--practically torn to pieces, and the covers gone--a very rare old thing, sir, if you're an expert.\"  \"No, thanks,\" I said. And then from a curiosity that had been growing in me and that I couldn't resist, \"That book--Golden Dreams,\" I said, \"you seem to think it a very wonderful work?\"  Mr. Sellyer directed one of his shrewd glances at me. He knew I didn't want to buy the book, and perhaps, like lesser people, he had his off moments of confidence.  He shook his head.  \"A bad business,\" he said. \"The publishers have unloaded the thing on us, and we have to do what we can. They're stuck with it, I understand, and they look to us to help them.  They're advertising it largely and may pull it off. Of course, there's just a chance. One can't tell. It's just possible we may get the church people down on it and if so we're all right. But short of that we'll never make it.  I imagine it's perfectly rotten.\"  \"Haven't you read it?\" I asked.  \"Dear me, no!\" said the manager. His air was that of a milkman who is offered a glass of his own milk. \"A pretty time I'd have if I tried to READ the new books. It's quite enough to keep track of them without that.\"  \"But those people,\" I went on, deeply perplexed, \"who bought the book. Won't they be disappointed?\"  Mr. Sellyer shook his head. \"Oh, no,\" he said; \"you see, they won't READ it. They never do.\"  \"But at any rate,\" I insisted, \"your wife thought it a fine story.\"  Mr. Sellyer smiled widely.  \"I am not married, sir,\" he said.    AFTERNOON ADVENTURES AT MY CLUB   1.--The Anecdotes of Dr. So and So  That is not really his name. I merely call him that from his manner of talking.  His specialty is telling me short anecdotes of his professional life from day to day.  They are told with wonderful dash and power, except for one slight omission, which is, that you never know what the doctor is talking about. Beyond this, his little stories are of unsurpassed interest--but let me illustrate.  . . . . . . .  He came into the semi-silence room of the club the other day and sat down beside me.  \"Have something or other?\" he said.  \"No, thanks,\" I answered.  \"Smoke anything?\" he asked.  \"No, thanks.\"  The doctor turned to me. He evidently wanted to talk.  \"I've been having a rather peculiar experience,\" he said. \"Man came to me the other day--three or four weeks ago--and said, 'Doctor, I feel out of sorts. I believe I've got so and so.' 'Ah,' I said, taking a look at him, 'been eating so and so, eh?' 'Yes,' he said.  'Very good,' I said, 'take so and so.'  \"Well, off the fellow went--I thought nothing of it--simply wrote such and such in my note-book, such and such a date, symptoms such and such--prescribed such and such, and so forth, you understand?\"  \"Oh, yes, perfectly, doctor,\" I answered.  \"Very good. Three days later--a ring at the bell in the evening--my servant came to the surgery. 'Mr. So and So is here. Very anxious to see you.' 'All right!' I went down.  There he was, with every symptom of so and so written all over him--every symptom of it--this and this and this--\"  \"Awful symptoms, doctor,\" I said, shaking my head.  \"Are they not?\" he said, quite unaware that he hadn't named any. \"There he was with every symptom, heart so and so, eyes so and so, pulse this--I looked at him right in the eye and I said--'Do you want me to tell you the truth?' 'Yes,' he said. 'Very good,' I answered, 'I will. You've got so and so.' He fell back as if shot. 'So and so!' he repeated, dazed. I went to the sideboard and poured him out a drink of such and such. 'Drink this,' I said. He drank it. 'Now,' I said, 'listen to what I say: You've got so and so. There's only one chance,' I said, 'you must limit your eating and drinking to such and such, you must sleep such and such, avoid every form of such and such--I'll give you a cordial, so many drops every so long, but mind you, unless you do so and so, it won't help you.' 'All right, very good.' Fellow promised. Off he went.\"  The doctor paused a minute and then resumed:  \"Would you believe it--two nights later, I saw the fellow--after the theatre, in a restaurant--whole party of people--big plate of so and so in front of him--quart bottle of so and so on ice--such and such and so forth. I stepped over to him--tapped him on the shoulder:  'See here,' I said, 'if you won't obey my instructions, you can't expect me to treat you.' I walked out of the place.\"  \"And what happened to him?\" I asked.  \"Died,\" said the doctor, in a satisfied tone.  \"Died. I've just been filling in the certificate:  So and so, aged such and such, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4064"],["title","Moonbeams from the Larger Lunacy (#4)"],["body","of so and so!\"  \"An awful disease,\" I murmured.    2.--The Shattered Health of Mr. Podge  \"How are you, Podge?\" I said, as I sat down in a leather armchair beside him.  I only meant \"How-do-you-do?\" but he rolled his big eyes sideways at me in his flabby face (it was easier than moving his face) and he answered:  \"I'm not as well to-day as I was yesterday afternoon. Last week I was feeling pretty good part of the time, but yesterday about four o'clock the air turned humid, and I don't feel so well.\"  \"Have a cigarette?\" I said.  \"No, thanks; I find they affect the bronchial toobes.\"  \"Whose?\" I asked.  \"Mine,\" he answered.  \"Oh, yes,\" I said, and I lighted one. \"So you find the weather trying,\" I continued cheerfully.  \"Yes, it's too humid. It's up to a saturation of sixty-six. I'm all right till it passes sixty-four. Yesterday afternoon it was only about sixty-one, and I felt fine. But after that it went up. I guess it must be a contraction of the epidermis pressing on some of the sebaceous glands, don't you?\"  \"I'm sure it is,\" I said. \"But why don't you just sleep it off till it's over?\"  \"I don't like to sleep too much,\" he answered.  \"I'm afraid of it developing into hypersomnia. There are cases where it's been known to grow into a sort of lethargy that pretty well stops all brain action altogether--\"  \"That would be too bad,\" I murmured.  \"What do you do to prevent it?\"  \"I generally drink from half to three-quarters of a cup of black coffee, or nearly black, every morning at from eleven to five minutes past, so as to keep off hypersomnia. It's the best thing, the doctor says.\"  \"Aren't you afraid,\" I said, \"of its keeping you awake?\"  \"I am,\" answered Podge, and a spasm passed over his big yellow face. \"I'm always afraid of insomnia. That's the worst thing of all. The other night I went to bed about half-past ten, or twenty-five minutes after,--I forget which,--and I simply couldn't sleep. I couldn't. I read a magazine story, and I still couldn't; and I read another, and still I couldn't sleep. It scared me bad.\"  \"Oh, pshaw,\" I said; \"I don't think sleep matters as long as one eats properly and has a good appetite.\"  He shook his head very dubiously. \"I ate a plate of soup at lunch,\" he said, \"and I feel it still.\"  \"You FEEL it!\"  \"Yes,\" repeated Podge, rolling his eyes sideways in a pathetic fashion that he had, \"I still feel it. I oughtn't to have eaten it. It was some sort of a bean soup, and of course it was full of nitrogen. I oughtn't to touch nitrogen,\" he added, shaking his head.  \"Not take any nitrogen?\" I repeated.  \"No, the doctor--both doctors--have told me that. I can eat starches, and albumens, all right, but I have to keep right away from all carbons and nitrogens. I've been dieting that way for two years, except that now and again I take a little glucose or phosphates.\"  \"That must be a nice change,\" I said, cheerfully.  \"It is,\" he answered in a grateful sort of tone.  There was a pause. I looked at his big twitching face, and listened to the heavy wheezing of his breath, and I felt sorry for him.  \"See here, Podge,\" I said, \"I want to give you some good advice.\"  \"About what?\"  \"About your health.\"  \"Yes, yes, do,\" he said. Advice about his health was right in his line. He lived on it.  \"Well, then, cut out all this fool business of diet and drugs and nitrogen. Don't bother about anything of the sort. Forget it. Eat everything you want to, just when you want it. Drink all you like. Smoke all you can--and you'll feel a new man in a week.\"  \"Say, do you think so!\" he panted, his eyes filled with a new light.  \"I know it,\" I answered. And as I left him I shook hands with a warm feeling about my heart of being a benefactor to the human race.  Next day, sure enough, Podge's usual chair at the club was empty.  \"Out getting some decent exercise,\" I thought. \"Thank Heaven!\"  Nor did he come the next day, nor the next, nor for a week.  \"Leading a rational life at last,\" I thought.  \"Out in the open getting a little air and sunlight, instead of sitting here howling about his stomach.\"  The day after that I saw Dr. Slyder in black clothes glide into the club in that peculiar manner of his, like an amateur undertaker.  \"Hullo, Slyder,\" I called to him, \"you look as solemn as if you had been to a funeral.\"  \"I have,\" he said very quietly, and then added, \"poor Podge!\"  \"What about him?\" I asked with sudden apprehension.  \"Why, he died on Tuesday,\" answered the doctor. \"Hadn't you heard? Strangest case I've known in years. Came home suddenly one day, pitched all his medicines down the kitchen sink, ordered a couple of cases of champagne and two hundred havanas, and had his housekeeper cook a dinner like a Roman banquet! After being under treatment for two years! Lived, you know, on the narrowest margin conceivable. I told him and Silk told him--we all told him--his only chance was to keep away from every form of nitrogenous ultra-stimulants. I said to him often, 'Podge, if you touch heavy carbonized food, you're lost.'\"  \"Dear me,\" I thought to myself, \"there ARE such things after all!\"  \"It was a marvel,\" continued Slyder, \"that we kept him alive at all. And, of course\"--here the doctor paused to ring the bell to order two Manhattan cocktails--\"as soon as he touched alcohol he was done.\"  So that was the end of the valetudinarianism of Mr. Podge.  I have always considered that I killed him.  But anyway, he was a nuisance at the club.    3.--The Amazing Travels of Mr. Yarner  There was no fault to be found with Mr. Yarner till he made his trip around the world.  It was that, I think, which disturbed his brain and unfitted him for membership in the club.  \"Well,\" he would say, as he sat ponderously down with the air of a man opening an interesting conversation, \"I was just figuring it out that eleven months ago to-day I was in Pekin.\"  \"That's odd,\" I said, \"I was just reckoning that eleven days ago I was in Poughkeepsie.\"  \"They don't call it Pekin over there,\" he said. \"It's sounded Pei-Chang.\"  \"I know,\" I said, \"it's the same way with Poughkeepsie, they pronounce it P'Keepsie.\"  \"The Chinese,\" he went on musingly, \"are a strange people.\"  \"So are the people in P'Keepsie,\" I added, \"awfully strange.\"  That kind of retort would sometimes stop him, but not always. He was especially dangerous if he was found with a newspaper in his hand; because that meant that some item of foreign intelligence had gone to his brain.  Not that I should have objected to Yarner describing his travels. Any man who has bought a ticket round the world and paid for it, is entitled to that.  But it was his manner of discussion that I considered unpermissible.  Last week, for example, in an unguarded moment I fell a victim. I had been guilty of the imprudence--I forget in what connection--of speaking of lions. I realized at once that I had done wrong--lions, giraffes, elephants, rickshaws and natives of all brands, are topics to avoid in talking with a traveller.  \"Speaking of lions,\" began Yarner.  He was right, of course; I HAD spoken of lions.  \"--I shall never forget,\" he went on (of course, I knew he never would), \"a rather bad scrape I got into in the up-country of Uganda.  Imagine yourself in a wild, rolling country covered here and there with kwas along the sides of the nullahs.\"  I did so.  \"Well,\" continued Yarner, \"we were sitting in our tent one hot night--too hot to sleep--when all at once we heard, not ten feet in front of us, the most terrific roar that ever came from the throat of a lion.\"  As he said this Yarner paused to take a gulp of bubbling whiskey and soda and looked at me so ferociously that I actually shivered.  Then quite suddenly his manner cooled down in the strangest way, and his voice changed to a commonplace tone as he said,--  \"Perhaps I ought to explain that we hadn't come up to the up-country looking for big game.  In fact, we had been down in the down country with no idea of going higher than Mombasa.  Indeed, our going even to Mombasa itself was more or less an afterthought. Our first plan was to strike across from Aden to Singapore.  But our second plan was to strike direct from Colombo to Karuchi--\"  \"And what was your THIRD plan?\" I asked.  \"Our third plan,\" said Yarner deliberately, feeling that the talk was now getting really interesting, \"let me see, our third plan was to cut across from Socotra to Tananarivo.\"  \"Oh, yes,\" I said.  \"However, all that was changed, and changed under the strangest circumstances.  We were sitting, Gallon and I, on the piazza of the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo--you know the Galle Face?\"  \"No, I do not,\" I said very positively.  \"Very good. Well, I was sitting on the piazza watching a snake charmer who was seated, with a boa, immediately in front of me.  \"Poor Gallon was actually within two feet of the hideous reptile. All of a sudden the beast whirled itself into a coil, its eyes fastened with hideous malignity on poor Gallon, and with its head erect it emitted the most awful hiss I have heard proceed from the mouth of any living snake.\"  Here Yarner paused and took a long, hissing drink of whiskey and soda: and then as the malignity died out of his face--  \"I should explain,\" he went on, very quietly, \"that Gallon was not one of our original party.  We had come down to Colombo from Mongolia, going by the Pekin Hankow and the Nippon Yushen Keisha.\"  \"That, I suppose, is the best way?\" I said.  \"Yes. And oddly enough but for the accident of Gallon joining us, we should have gone by the Amoy, Cochin, Singapore route, which was our first plan. In fact, but for Gallon we should hardly have got through China at all.  The Boxer insurrection had taken place only fourteen years before our visit, so you can imagine the awful state of the country.  \"Our meeting with Gallon was thus absolutely providential. Looking back on it, I think it perhaps saved our lives. We were in Mongolia (this, you understand, was before we reached China), and had spent the night "]]]
