Mammals may have reached Tamaulipas by way of a Northern route, a Trans-plateau route, a Montane route, or a Tropical route (Fig 3).  The Northern route permitted species of mammals from the temperate region to the north to enter the Tamaulipan Biotic Province from or via Texas. Several came from the Great Plains, and a few came from the eastern part of the United States. Also, a few mammals that may have originated in the Tamaulipan Province moved northwards. Some of these, according to Dice (1937:267) were _Liomys irroratus texensis_, _Peromyscus leucopus texensis_, and _Lepus californicus merriami_. Other mammals thought to have moved north by this route are _Didelphis marsupialis_, _Dasypus novemcinctus_, _Oryzomys palustris_, _Nasua narica_, and _Tayassu tajacu_. Some mammals that passed through Tamaulipas into Texas have extended their geographic ranges far north of Texas.  Mammals that came _via_ the Trans-plateau route (name proposed by Baker, 1956:146) came no farther into Tamaulipas than the Chihuahuan Biotic Province. They encountered the barrier formed by the Sierra Madre Oriental. These mammals were listed in the account of the Chihuahuan Biotic Province.  The route that Baker (1956:146) termed the \"Southern Route\" I here term the Montane route because I think it was used for movement southward as well as northward.  [Illustration: FIG. 3. Routes of movement: 1 Northern; 2 Trans-Plateau; 3 Montane; 4 Tropical.]  The Montane route was used by mammals of boreal affinities (_Microtus_ and _Neotoma_), that moved into Tamaulipas from the north; also in this category are bats of the family Vespertilionidae. For movement from south to north, the route was used by several species native to México, for example, _Cratogeomys castanops_. The seaward slope of the montane area has enabled some tropical mammals to move farther north than they have done at higher and lower elevations. _Philander opossum_ seems to be an example.  The fourth route, the Tropical one, was used by mammals of tropical origin. Most moved into Tamaulipas only as far as the Veracruzian Biotic Province. The principal mammals that have used this route are the bats and marsupials, but _Sylvilagus brasiliensis_, _Ateles geoffroyi_, _Heterogeomys hispidus_, _Eira barbara_, and _Mazama americana_ also can be included here. Some tropical mammals, as was pointed out previously, not only reached Tamaulipas but have moved through the state and far northward.  The major barriers to dispersal of mammals in Tamaulipas are three (see Fig. 2). Two of them, the Río Grande Barrier and the Sierra Madre Barrier, are physiographical, but the Tropical Barrier is maintained by a combination of environmental factors. The three barriers separate the four Biotic Provinces in Tamaulipas. The Sierra Madre Oriental, which forms the Potosian Biotic Province, lies between the Tamaulipan and Chihuahuan provinces. The Tropical barrier separates the Tamaulipan and Veracruzian biotic provinces.  The Río Grande, as was pointed out by R. H. Baker (1956:146), has low banks, is relatively shallow, and does not form an effective barrier for most mammals. For only two species, insofar as I know, has the Río Grande constituted a barrier. _Cratogeomys castanops_ has not entered southeastern Texas from México, and _Spermophilus spilosoma_ has not entered México from southeastern Texas except on the coastal barrier beach. Alvarez (1962:124) postulated that the beach was the route by which _S. spilosoma_ arrived at La Pesca where the barrier beach meets the mainland.  The Sierra Madre Barrier is a good filter for some small mammals, especially for those that occur on the Mexican Plateau and those of tropical origin. The mammals that occur on each side of the Sierra are listed in accounts of the Chihuahuan (west side), Veracruzian and Tamaulipan (east side) biotic provinces.  The Tropical Barrier is formed mainly by a climatic complex (probably a change in temperature and rainfall) in the coastal region at or about the latitude of Soto la Marina, where no geographic barrier is found. In the western and central part of the Tropical Barrier, the climatic factor is supported by a geographic factor. The Sierra Madre Oriental is in the west and the Sierra de Tamaulipas is in the center. The several mammals that are affected by this barrier are listed in the accounts of the Veracruzian and Tamaulipan biotic provinces.  A peculiar pattern of distribution is that presented by _Scalopus inflatus_ and _Geomys tropicalis_. Both are the only known species of their genera in northeastern México. Each is isolated from other species of its genus. The nearest known record of _Scalopus_ is 45 miles northward and the nearest record of _Geomys_ is approximately 165 miles northward. A possible explanation for the distribution of these two kinds is that each was widely distributed in one of the glacial periods and when the glacier receded to the north these animals remained in Tamaulipas, where they evolved and formed distinct species. The two species, _G. tropicalis_ and _S. inflatus_, are fossorial and for this reason probably were able to resist inhospitable climates better than non-burrowing species.     HISTORY OF MAMMALOGY   In Tamaulipas the first exploration directed in substantial measure toward finding out about the mammalian fauna, at least as far as I know, was made by Dr. L. Berlandier, who traveled mainly in the northern half of the state. His collections provided specimens of several previously unknown mammals, which were described by Baird (1858). The original manuscript of Berlandier never has been published. About 1880 Dr. E. Palmer collected mammals in the southern part of Tamaulipas, in the area around Tampico. The results of his exploration were reported by J. A. Allen (1881). E. W. Nelson and E. A. Goldman twice collected in Tamaulipas (Goldman, 1951). In 1898 they visited and collected mammals in the southern part of the state, around Tampico, Altamira, Victoria, Forlón, and Miquihuana. In 1901-1902 they visited the area between Nuevo Laredo and Bagdad, then went south to Soto la Marina and Victoria. From their collections several species and subspecies have been described. Between 1910 and the early 1920's little was done in the way of scientific exploration because of the Mexican Revolution.  From 1930 on, several expeditions yielded new information about the native mammals. In that year L. B. Kellum visited the Sierra San Carlos. The results were reported by Dice (1937). Another important collection from Tamaulipas was made by Marian Martin in the area of Gómez Farías. Mammals collected by her were reported by Goodwin (1954). Hooper (1953) also reported specimens from Gómez Farías but included in his report records of mammals collected in other areas as well. In 1950 E. R. Hall and C. von Wedel made a trip to the barrier beach in the northeastern part of the state and collected several kinds of mammals among which three were described as new by Hall (1951).  The report here presented is based upon specimens in the Museum of Natural History of The University of Kansas that were collected mainly by the persons named beyond. Gerd H. Heinrich and his wife Hilda collected in 1952 and 1953 in the areas around Miquihuana, Ciudad Victoria, Soto la Marina, Sierra de Tamaulipas, and Altamira. W. J. Schaldach collected in 1949 and 1950 in the Sierra Madre Oriental south of Ciudad Victoria; he returned to Tamaulipas in 1954 in company with V. Grissino and worked in the Sierra Madre Oriental south and north of Ciudad Victoria. In 1961 P. L. Clifton and J. H. Bodley collected in the northwestern part of the state and in the western part, around Tula, Nicolás, and Tajada. Some students and staff members of the Museum have occasionally collected in Tamaulipas.  As a result of all the mentioned expeditions and others, 32 species and subspecies have been described with type localities in Tamaulipas.

NW San Carlos          _Peromyscus pectoralis collinus_ Hooper     CONSERVATION   A relatively large number of the species of Mexican big game occurs in Tamaulipas because its geographic position permits it to have species from the tropics and those from the northern plains and mountains. Eight of the 11 Mexican species that are considered as Big Game are recorded from the state. Until this century Tamaulipas was not densely populated by man either in the pre-colonial period or thereafter. Therefore many species of game are still relatively abundant.  Of the eight species that originally lived in Tamaulipas, the mule deer, brocket, and black bear never have been abundant there and now are in danger of extirpation. The pronghorn was also rare in the state and now has been extirpated as it has been in many other parts of México. The white-tailed deer, javalin, jaguar, and puma are still abundant in suitable habitats. The white-tailed deer is found almost everywhere in the state; in some areas it damages cornfields, and for this reason is killed by natives who eat the meat and sell the skins. The price of skins is low; in 1959 at Ciudad Mante tanners paid natives less than one dollar (10.00 Mexican pesos) per hide. Some idea of the abundance of deer in Tamaulipas is provided by our having found in one tanner's shop, in 1959 at Ciudad Mante, about 500 deer skins. Besides these, we found about 65 skins of other species--jaguar, bear, ocelot, puma, margay, and raccoon. Additionally there was a large number of coati skins. Considering that México has no professional trappers and that commerce in skins of wild animals is illegal, it is felt that the number of skins found in the tanner's shop indicated a relative large population of game mammals.  The number of species of small game also is large. Some species are killed by natives for food, but most are killed in order to protect the cultivated crops, which are injured mainly by rabbits and squirrels.  Baker (1958) pointed out that the future of the game species in the northern part of México was not encouraging. He gave valid reasons for his view. In Tamaulipas, however, in some respects the outlook is more encouraging because there are many areas in which with a minimum of effort the authorities can save a good number of species.  As Baker (_op. cit._) remarked, the fauna in México is declining mainly because many areas recently have been cultivated for the first time. Also, better roads have enabled hunters to reach areas that formerly were natural refuges for wild animals. Many times it has been said that the populations of wild animals were declining in México because the number of game wardens is too small to protect game in all parts of the country. In some ways this is true but it seems that the problem is really one of education. The people do not realize that the animals are part of nature and therefore have the same right to live that man has. Most people see only the bad side of the animals' activities and never consider the benefit that wild mammals provide for man. A typical case is that of the coyote, which is oftentimes killed only because it is a coyote. Sometimes individual coyotes do kill domestic animals, but the people seem never to understand that the coyote destroys a large number of mice, rabbits, and insects as has been shown by studies of the contents of coyote stomachs.  The Mexican Government at this time is making a concentrated effort to provide schools in all parts of the country and is formulating new programs of education. In this official program some lectures in conservation are needed with reference to the animal life. I know that some education now is given to people with respect to conservation of the water, soil, and forest, but gather that there is little that covers also conservation of animals.  I do not deny the necessity for some natives to kill wild animals. People need to eat fresh meat and for some it is almost impossible to obtain meat in any other way than by killing wild animals. Some natives cannot afford to purchase meat in the markets or they live too far from any village or city to do so. Also, natives need to protect their cultivated areas; some of them have only four to six acres of land, on which corn is the only crop. When one deer in a night can destroy part of the corn, and in some areas not only one deer but several invade a field, and when one considers that besides deer there are rabbits, squirrels, raccoons, and coati, to name only some animals that feed on the corn, we find that the small cornfield at the end of the season may not contain any corn to harvest. It is understandable, therefore, that the natives kill the animals. In this way they protect their cultivated fields, obtain food and sometimes money for the skins. Many natives, however, destroy the wildlife only for pleasure or to obtain money for skins and meat, which sometimes is sold to restaurants.  Probably the best solution for the problem of conservation of wild animals is the establishment of wildlife refuges. In Tamaulipas, at least three refuges are needed in order to preserve the mammalian wildlife. These areas would serve also as a refuge for game birds and other vertebrates. A large area with suitable habitat for white-tailed deer, brocket, jaguar, puma, javalin, and fox could be established in the Sierra de Tamaulipas, which presents favorable habitat for all of the species named. A second area that does not need to be so large as the first could be established in the Sierra Madre Oriental, probably including some part of Nuevo León, where the black bear and the mule deer find suitable habitat. Probably the beaver can be introduced in the streams of the high mountains; beaver live in the same Sierra a little farther north in Nuevo León. The three species mentioned are in imminent danger of disappearing from Tamaulipas, if they have not already disappeared. The third refuge could be in some area of the northern part of the state near the Río Grande. This refuge should give protection to the beaver--a rare animal in México and in danger of extirpation over all the country. The pronghorn also would find suitable habitat in this area, but would have to be reintroduced there. With the establishment of these three refuges and with good management the fauna of Tamaulipas could be saved from extinction, would provide some recreation for sportsmen, and especially for the people in general who wish to study, photograph, or merely observe the native animal life.  The time is excellent for the establishment of the wildlife refuges in Tamaulipas because large areas are still in Federal ownership and because a considerable number of animals remain. Other favorable factors are that roads are not yet good in the areas proposed for refuges, the human population is low, and agriculture consequently is not practiced. But, with the rapid increase in population in México, these favorable conditions will change in a few years and it will be almost impossible to establish the refuges then.     METHODS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS   The families, genera, and species recorded in this report are arranged following Hall and Kelson (1959). Subspecies are in alphabetical order under the species. Remarks are given on natural history in each species account, if information is available. Discussion of subspecies known from the state is included. Under each subspecies, the citation to the original description is given with mention of type locality. Next is the citation to the first usage of the current name-combination. Then, synonyms are listed if there be such in the sense that original descriptions of the alleged species or subspecies had type localities in Tamaulipas.  Measurements, unless otherwise noted, are of adults and are given in millimeters. External measurements are in the following order: total length; length of tail vertebrae; length of hind foot; length of ear from notch. Capitalized color terms are those of Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912. Capital letters designate teeth in the upper jaws and lower case letters designate teeth in the lower jaws; for example, M2 refers to the second upper molar and m2 refers to the second lower molar.  The localities of specimens examined and additional records are listed from north to south and their geographic positions can be found in the gazetteer and on the map (Fig. 4).  Most of the specimens examined are in the Museum of Natural History of the University of Kansas. Unless otherwise indicated, catalogue numbers relate to that collection. A few specimens from other collections were seen.
