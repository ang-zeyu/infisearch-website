We heard that Russia was beginning to mobilize,\" (at this word be blew a puff from his cigarette and then repeated \"beginning to mobilize\") \"but we thought nothing of it.\"  \"Of course not,\" I said.  \"Then we heard that Hungary was calling out the Honveds, but we still thought nothing of it.\"  \"Certainly not,\" I said.  \"And then we heard--\"  \"Yes, I know,\" I said, \"you heard that Italy was calling out the Trombonari, and that Germany was calling in all the Landesgeschutzshaft.\"  He looked at me.  \"How did you know that?\" he said.  \"We heard it over here,\" I answered.  \"Well,\" he went on, \"next thing we knew we heard that the Russians were at Fryzzl.\"  \"Great Heavens!\" I exclaimed.  \"Yes, at Fryzzl, not a hundred miles away.  The very place we'd been at only two weeks before.\"  \"Think of it!\" I said. \"If you'd been where you were two weeks after you were there, or if the Russians had been a hundred miles away from where they were, or even if Fryzzl had been a hundred miles nearer to Izzl--\"  We both shuddered.  \"It was a close call,\" said Parkins. \"However, I said to Loo Jones, 'Loo, it's time to clear out.' And then, I tell you, our trouble began. First of all we couldn't get any money.  We went to the bank at Izzl and tried to get them to give us American dollars for Hungarian paper money; we had nothing else.\"  \"And wouldn't they?\"  \"Absolutely refused. They said they hadn't any.\"  \"By George,\" I exclaimed. \"Isn't war dreadful? What on earth did you do?\"  \"Took a chance,\" said Parkins. \"Went across to the railway station to buy our tickets with the Hungarian money.\"  \"Did you get them?\" I said.  \"Yes,\" assented Parkins. \"They said they'd sell us tickets. But they questioned us mighty closely; asked where we wanted to go to, what class we meant to travel by, how much luggage we had to register and so on. I tell you the fellow looked at us mighty closely.\"  \"Were you in those clothes?\" I asked.  \"Yes,\" said Parkins, \"but I guess he suspected we weren't Hungarians. You see, we couldn't either of us speak Hungarian. In fact we spoke nothing but English.\"  \"That would give him a clue,\" I said.  \"However,\" he went on, \"he was civil enough in a way. We asked when was the next train to the sea coast, and he said there wasn't any.\"  \"No trains?\" I repeated.  \"Not to the coast. The man said the reason was because there wasn't any railway to the coast. But he offered to sell us tickets to Vienna. We asked when the train would go and he said there wouldn't be one for two hours. So there we were waiting on that wretched little platform,--no place to sit down, no shade, unless one went into the waiting room itself,--for two mortal hours. And even then the train was an hour and a half late!\"  \"An hour and a half late!\" I repeated.  \"Yep!\" said Parkins, \"that's what things were like over there. So when we got on board the train we asked a man when it was due to get to Vienna, and he said he hadn't the faintest idea!\"  \"Good heavens!\"  \"Not the faintest idea. He told us to ask the conductor or one of the porters. No, sir, I'll never forget that journey through to Vienna,--nine mortal hours! Nothing to eat, not a bite, except just in the middle of the day when they managed to hitch on a dining-car for a while. And they warned everybody that the dining-car was only on for an hour and a half. Commandeered, I guess after that,\" added Parkins, puffing his cigarette.  \"Well,\" he continued, \"we got to Vienna at last. I'll never forget the scene there, station full of people, trains coming and going, men, even women, buying tickets, big piles of luggage being shoved on trucks. It gave one a great idea of the reality of things.\"  \"It must have,\" I said.  \"Poor old Loo Jones was getting pretty well used up with it all. However, we determined to see it through somehow.\"  \"What did you do next?\"  \"Tried again to get money: couldn't--they changed our Hungarian paper into Italian gold, but they refused to give us American money.\"  \"Hoarding it?\" I hinted.  \"Exactly,\" said Parkins, \"hoarding it all for the war. Well anyhow we got on a train for Italy and there our troubles began all over again:--train stopped at the frontier,--officials (fellows in Italian uniforms) went all through it, opening hand baggage--\"  \"Not hand baggage!\" I gasped.  \"Yes, sir, even the hand baggage. Opened it all, or a lot of it anyway, and scribbled chalk marks over it. Yes, and worse than that,--I saw them take two fellows and sling them clear off the train,--they slung them right out on to the platform.\"  \"What for?\" I asked.  \"Heaven knows,\" said Parkins,--\"they said they had no tickets. In war time you know, when they're mobilizing, they won't let a soul ride on a train without a ticket.\"  \"Infernal tyranny,\" I murmured.  \"Isn't it? However, we got to Genoa at last, only to find that not a single one of our trunks had come with us!\"  \"Confiscated?\" I asked.  \"I don't know,\" said Parkins, \"the head baggage man (he wears a uniform, you know, in Italy just like a soldier) said it was because we'd forgotten to check them in Vienna. However there we were waiting for twenty-four hours with nothing but our valises.\"  \"Right at the station?\" I asked.  \"No, at a hotel. We got the trunks later.  They telegraphed to Vienna for them and managed to get them through somehow,--in a baggage car, I believe.\"  \"And after that, I suppose, you had no more trouble.\"  \"Trouble,\" said Parkins, \"I should say we had. Couldn't get a steamer! They said there was none sailing out of Genoa for New York for three days! All cancelled, I guess, or else rigged up as cruisers.\"  \"What on earth did you do?\"  \"Stuck it out as best we could: stayed right there in the hotel. Poor old Jones was pretty well collapsed! Couldn't do anything but sleep and eat, and sit on the piazza of the hotel.\"  \"But you got your steamer at last?\" I asked.  \"Yes,\" he admitted, \"we got it. But I never want to go through another voyage like that again, no sir!\"  \"What was wrong with it?\" I asked, \"bad weather?\"  \"No, calm, but a peculiar calm, glassy, with little ripples on the water,--uncanny sort of feeling.\"  \"What was wrong with the voyage?\"  \"Oh, just the feeling of it,--everything under strict rule you know--no lights anywhere except just the electric lights,--smoking-room closed tight at eleven o'clock,--decks all washed down every night--officers up on the bridge all day looking out over the sea,--no, sir, I want no more of it. Poor old Loo Jones, I guess he's quite used up: he can't speak of it at all: just sits and broods, in fact I doubt...\"  At this moment Parkins's conversation was interrupted by the entry of two newcomers into the room. One of them had on a little Hungarian suit like the one Parkins wore, and was talking loudly as they came in.  \"Yes,\" he was saying, \"we were caught there fair and square right in the war zone. We were at Izzl in the Carpathians, poor old Parkins and I--\"  We looked round.  It was Loo Jones, describing his escape from Europe.    7.--The War Mania of Mr. Jinks and Mr. Blinks  They were sitting face to face at a lunch table at the club so near to me that I couldn't avoid hearing what they said. In any case they are both stout men with gurgling voices which carry.  \"What Kitchener ought to do,\"--Jinks was saying in a loud voice.  So I knew at once that he had the prevailing hallucination. He thought he was commanding armies in Europe.  After which I watched him show with three bits of bread and two olives and a dessert knife the way in which the German army could be destroyed.  Blinks looked at Jinks' diagram with a stern impassive face, modelled on the Sunday supplement photogravures of Lord Kitchener.  \"Your flank would be too much exposed,\" he said, pointing to Jinks' bread. He spoke with the hard taciturnity of a Joffre.  \"My reserves cover it,\" said Jinks, moving two pepper pots to the support of the bread.  \"Mind you,\" Jinks went on, \"I don't say Kitchener WILL do this: I say this is what he OUGHT to do: it's exactly the tactics of Kuropatkin outside of Mukden and it's precisely the same turning movement that Grant used before Richmond.\"  Blinks nodded gravely. Anybody who has seen the Grand Duke Nicholoevitch quietly accepting the advice of General Ruski under heavy artillery fire, will realize Blinks' manner to a nicety.  And, oddly enough, neither of them, I am certain, has ever had any larger ideas about the history of the Civil War than what can be got from reading Uncle Tom's Cabin and seeing Gillette play Secret Service. But this is part of the mania. Jinks and Blinks had suddenly developed the hallucination that they knew the history of all wars by a sort of instinct.  They rose soon after that, dusted off their waistcoats with their napkins and waddled heavily towards the door. I could hear them as they went talking eagerly of the need of keeping the troops in hard training. They were almost brutal in their severity. As they passed out of the door,--one at a time to avoid crowding,--they were still talking about it. Jinks was saying that our whole generation is overfed and soft. If he had his way he would take every man in the United States up to forty- seven years of age (Jinks is forty-eight) and train him to a shadow. Blinks went further.  He said they should be trained hard up to fifty. He is fifty-one.  After that I used to notice Jinks and Blinks always together in the club, and always carrying on the European War.  I never knew which side they were on. They seemed to be on both. One day they commanded huge armies of Russians, and there was one week when Blinks and Jinks at the head of vast levies of Cossacks threatened to overrun the whole of Western Europe. It was dreadful to watch them burning churches and monasteries and to see Jinks throw whole convents full of white robed nuns into the flames like so much waste paper.  For a time I feared they would obliterate civilization itself. Then suddenly Blinks"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4064"],["title","Moonbeams from the Larger Lunacy (#8)"],["body","that Jinks' Cossacks were no good, not properly trained. He converted himself on the spot into a Prussian Field Marshal, declared himself organised to a pitch of organisation of which Jinks could form no idea, and swept Jinks' army off the earth, without using any men at all, by sheer organisation.  In this way they moved to and fro all winter over the map of Europe, carrying death and destruction everywhere and revelling in it.  But I think I liked best the wild excitement of their naval battles.  Jinks generally fancied himself a submarine and Blinks acted the part of a first-class battleship. Jinks would pop his periscope out of the water, take a look at Blinks merely for the fraction of a second, and then, like a flash, would dive under water again and start firing his torpedoes. He explained that he carried six.  But he was never quick enough for Blinks.  One glimpse of his periscope miles and miles away was enough. Blinks landed him a contact shell in the side, sunk him with all hands, and then lined his yards with men and cheered. I have known Blinks sink Jinks at two miles, six miles--and once--in the club billiard room just after the battle of the Falkland Islands,--he got him fair and square at ten nautical miles.  Jinks of course claimed that he was not sunk.  He had dived. He was two hundred feet under water quietly smiling at Blinks through his periscope. In fact the number of things that Jinks has learned to do through his periscope passes imagination.  Whenever I see him looking across at Blinks with his eyes half closed and with a baffling, quizzical expression in them, I know that he is looking at him through his periscope.  Now is the time for Blinks to watch out. If he relaxes his vigilance for a moment he'll be torpedoed as he sits, and sent flying, whiskey and soda and all, through the roof of the club, while Jinks dives into the basement.  Indeed it has come about of late, I don't know just how, that Jinks has more or less got command of the sea. A sort of tacit understanding has been reached that Blinks, whichever army he happens at the moment to command, is invincible on land. But Jinks, whether as a submarine or a battleship, controls the sea. No doubt this grew up in the natural evolution of their conversation. It makes things easier for both. Jinks even asks Blinks how many men there are in an army division, and what a sotnia of Cossacks is and what the Army Service Corps means. And Jinks in return has become a recognized expert in torpedoes and has taken to wearing a blue serge suit and referring to Lord Beresford as Charley.  But what I noticed chiefly about the war mania of Jinks and Blinks was their splendid indifference to slaughter. They had gone into the war with a grim resolution to fight it out to a finish. If Blinks thought to terrify Jinks by threatening to burn London, he little knew his man. \"All right,\" said Jinks, taking a fresh light for his cigar, \"burn it! By doing so, you destroy, let us say, two million of my women and children? Very good. Am I injured by that? No. You merely stimulate me to recruiting.\"  There was something awful in the grimness of the struggle as carried on by Blinks and Jinks.  The rights of neutrals and non-combatants, Red Cross nurses, and regimental clergymen they laughed to scorn. As for moving-picture men and newspaper correspondents, Jinks and Blinks hanged them on every tree in Belgium and Poland.  With combatants in this frame of mind the war I suppose might have lasted forever.  But it came to an end accidentally,--fortuitously, as all great wars are apt to. And by accident also, I happened to see the end of it.  It was late one evening. Jinks and Blinks were coming down the steps of the club, and as they came they were speaking with some vehemence on their favourite topic.  \"I tell you,\" Jinks was saying, \"war is a great thing. We needed it, Blinks. We were all getting too soft, too scared of suffering and pain. We wilt at a bayonet charge, we shudder at the thought of wounds. Bah!\" he continued, \"what does it matter if a few hundred thousands of human beings are cut to pieces.  We need to get back again to the old Viking standard, the old pagan ideas of suffering--\"  And as he spoke he got it.  The steps of the club were slippery with the evening's rain,--not so slippery as the frozen lakes of East Prussia or the hills where Jinks and Blinks had been campaigning all winter, but slippery enough for a stout man whose nation has neglected his training. As Jinks waved his stick in the air to illustrate the glory of a bayonet charge, he slipped and fell sideways on the stone steps. His shin bone smacked against the edge of the stone in a way that was pretty well up to the old Viking standard of such things. Blinks with the shock of the collision fell also,--backwards on the top step, his head striking first. He lay, to all appearance, as dead as the most insignificant casualty in Servia.  I watched the waiters carrying them into the club, with that new field ambulance attitude towards pain which is getting so popular. They had evidently acquired precisely the old pagan attitude that Blinks and Jinks desired.  And the evening after that I saw Blinks and Jinks, both more or less bandaged, sitting in a corner of the club beneath a rubber tree, making peace.  Jinks was moving out of Montenegro and Blinks was foregoing all claims to Polish Prussia; Jinks was offering Alsace-Lorraine to Blinks, and Blinks in a fit of chivalrous enthusiasm was refusing to take it. They were disbanding troops, blowing up fortresses, sinking their warships and offering indemnities which they both refused to take. Then as they talked, Jinks leaned forward and said something to Blinks in a low voice,--a final proposal of terms evidently.  Blinks nodded, and Jinks turned and beckoned to a waiter, with the words,--  \"One Scotch whiskey and soda, and one stein of Wurtemburger Bier--\"  And when I heard this, I knew that the war was over.    8.--The Ground Floor  I hadn't seen Ellesworth since our college days, twenty years before, at the time when he used to borrow two dollars and a half from the professor of Public Finance to tide him over the week end.  Then quite suddenly he turned up at the club one day and had afternoon tea with me.  His big clean shaven face had lost nothing of its impressiveness, and his spectacles had the same glittering magnetism as in the days when he used to get the college bursar to accept his note of hand for his fees.  And he was still talking European politics just as he used to in the days of our earlier acquaintance.  \"Mark my words,\" he said across the little tea-table, with one of the most piercing glances I have ever seen, \"the whole Balkan situation was only a beginning. We are on the eve of a great pan-Slavonic upheaval.\" And then he added, in a very quiet, casual tone: \"By the way, could you let me have twenty-five dollars till to-morrow?\"  \"A pan-Slavonic movement!\" I ejaculated.  \"Do you really think it possible? No, I couldn't.\"  \"You must remember,\" Ellesworth went on, \"Russia means to reach out and take all she can get;\" and he added, \"how about fifteen till Friday?\"  \"She may reach for it,\" I said, \"but I doubt if she'll get anything. I'm sorry. I haven't got it.\"  \"You're forgetting the Bulgarian element,\" he continued, his animation just as eager as before. \"The Slavs never forget what they owe to one another.\"  Here Ellesworth drank a sip of tea and then said quietly, \"Could you make it ten till Saturday at twelve?\"  I looked at him more closely. I noticed now his frayed cuffs and the dinginess of his over-brushed clothes. Not even the magnetism of his spectacles could conceal it. Perhaps I had been forgetting something, whether the Bulgarian element or not.  I compromised at ten dollars till Saturday.  \"The Slav,\" said Ellesworth, as he pocketed the money, \"is peculiar. He never forgets.\"  \"What are you doing now?\" I asked him.  \"Are you still in insurance?\" I had a vague recollection of him as employed in that business.  \"No,\" he answered. \"I gave it up. I didn't like the outlook. It was too narrow. The atmosphere cramped me. I want,\" he said, \"a bigger horizon.\"  \"Quite so,\" I answered quietly. I had known men before who had lost their jobs. It is generally the cramping of the atmosphere that does it. Some of them can use up a tremendous lot of horizon.  \"At present,\" Ellesworth went on, \"I am in finance. I'm promoting companies.\"  \"Oh, yes,\" I said. I had seen companies promoted before.  \"Just now,\" continued Ellesworth, \"I'm working on a thing that I think will be rather a big thing. I shouldn't want it talked about outside, but it's a matter of taking hold of the cod fisheries of the Grand Banks,--practically amalgamating them--and perhaps combining with them the entire herring output, and the whole of the sardine catch of the Mediterranean.  If it goes through,\" he added, \"I shall be in a position to let you in on the ground floor.\"  I knew the ground floor of old. I have already many friends sitting on it; and others who have fallen through it into the basement.  I said, \"thank you,\" and he left me.  \"That was Ellesworth, wasn't it?\" said a friend of mine who was near me. \"Poor devil.  I knew him slightly,--always full of some new and wild idea of making money. He was talking to me the other day of the possibility of cornering all the huckleberry crop and making refined sugar. Isn't it amazing what fool ideas fellows like him are always putting up to business men?\"  We both laughed.  After that I didn't see Ellesworth for some weeks.  Then I met him in the club again. How he paid his fees there I do not know.  This time he was seated among a litter of foreign newspapers with a cup of tea and a ten-cent package of cigarettes beside him.  \"Have one of these cigarettes,\" he said. \"I get them specially. They are milder than what we have in the club here.\"  They certainly were.  \"Note what I say,\" Ellesworth went"]]]
