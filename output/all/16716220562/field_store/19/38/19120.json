Q. Hopton's comment.  \"I'll teach him sumthin'!\" answered the old man. \"Open thet door, I say, an' come out here.\"  \"You want to get those papers,\" said Andy. He was wondering what to do next.  \"Well, ain't I your guardeen, an' ain't I got a right to 'em?\"  \"The papers are mine, and I'm not going to give them up,\" answered Andy, doggedly. \"I don't like that Mr. Hopton, and he's not going to get the papers. I'm going to turn them over to a lawyer.\"  At these words the real estate man was much disturbed.  \"That boy is an imp,\" he said, in a low voice. \"I'd not let him talk to me that way if I were you.\"  \"I ain't goin' to,\" answered Josiah Graham. \"Andy, you open thet door, or I'll bust it in!\"  \"Don't you dare break down the door!\" answered Andy, in increased alarm. \"If you do--I'll--I'll--Well, remember, I've got my gun--and it's loaded, too.\"  \"Don't ye shoot! Don't ye shoot!\" yelled Uncle Si, in sudden terror, and he backed away several steps. \"Don't ye dare! Oh, was ever there sech a boy!\"  \"Do you think he'd dare to shoot?\" asked the real estate dealer.  \"I dunno. He's got lots o' spirit sometimes.\"  \"Maybe we had better try to reason with him.\"  \"All right.\" Josiah Graham raised his voice. \"Andy, this is all--er--foolishness. Come out o' there.\"  To this the youth did not answer. He was considering what he had best do next. He did not want to shoot anybody, and he was afraid that the two men would in some manner get the better of him and take away the papers.  \"Andy, do ye hear me? Come out--I ain't goin' to hurt ye.\"  \"You'll take those papers away from me.\"  \"He is going to sell me the papers, and at a good price,\" broke in A. Q. Hopton.  \"I don't want to sell--to you,\" answered Andy. He was moving around the bedroom rapidly, having decided on a course of action.  \"I'm your guardeen, an' I know wot's best,\" broke in Josiah Graham. \"Open the door, an' no more foolin' about it.\"  \"I don't recognize you as my guardian,\" was Andy's reply. As he spoke he tiptoed his way to the window and opened it. Then he threw out a small bundle, and his gun and game bag followed.  \"I am your guardeen!\" stormed Josiah Graham. \"You open the door!\"  Instead of answering, Andy pushed a chair to the window. In another instant he had mounted it, and then he crawled through the opening. He landed in a heap in the snow, and scrambled up immediately. With bundle, gun, the game bag in his possession, he ran back of the shed and then down the road leading to the village.  At that minute he did not know where he was going, or what he was going to do. He had the precious papers in his pocket, and his one idea was to keep these away from his uncle and Mr. A. Q. Hopton.  \"I'll not go back until I've stored the papers in a safe place,\" he told himself, finally. \"I wonder who would keep them for me without asking too many questions?\"  Although the sun hung low in the west, it was still light, and reaching a turn in the road, Andy stopped to look back. Much to his chagrin, he saw that his flight had already been discovered.  \"They are coming after me!\" he murmured, as he saw the horse and cutter flash into view. His uncle and the real estate dealer were on the seat, and the latter was urging the horse into a run through the heavy snow.  Unfortunately for Andy, there was but one road in that vicinity, and that ended at the Graham cabin. On all sides were the pine woods, with their scrub timber and underbrush, still partly laden with the fall of snow of the week previous.  \"If I stick to the road they'll catch me sure, and if I leave it I'll have to go right into the woods, and they'll easily see my trail,\" he reasoned.  He broke into a run, and thus managed to pass another bend of the highway. Behind him he heard the jingle of the sleighbells as the cutter drew closer. In a few minutes more his pursuers would be upon him.  \"I'll chance it in the woods,\" he muttered, and, reaching a spot where the undergrowth was thick, he leaped between the bushes and then walked on to a clump of pines. He was barely under the pines when he heard the cutter dash past. The men were talking excitedly, but he could not make out what was being said.  As the jingle of the sleighbells grew more distant, another thought came to Andy's mind, one that made him smile grimly in spite of the seriousness of the situation.  \"Might as well return and get something to eat,\" he told himself. \"They won't come back right away.\"  It did not take him long to retrace his steps to the cabin. The cutter, with its occupants, had kept on towards the village, so he had the place entirely to himself. He quickly found something to eat and to drink, and made a substantial meal. Then he placed a few more of his belongings in his bundle.  \"It won't do for me to stay here as long as I have the papers with me,\" he told himself. \"I guess I'd better try to get to the old Smith cabin for tonight. Then I can make up my mind what to do in the morning.\"  The Smith cabin was a deserted place nearly a mile away. To reach it, Andy had to tramp directly through the woods. But the youth did not mind this, for he had often been out hunting in the vicinity.  \"I might get a shot at something,\" he mused. \"A rabbit or a couple of birds wouldn't go bad for breakfast.\"  He lost no time in striking out. Half the distance was covered when he saw a big rabbit directly in his path. He blazed away, and the game fell dead. Then he caught sight of a squirrel, and brought that down also.  \"Now I'll have something besides crackers and bacon when I'm hungry,\" he told himself, with satisfaction.  Soon he came in sight of the old Smith place. Much to his surprise, smoke was curling from the chimney, and he saw the ruddy glare of an open fire within.  \"Somebody is here,\" he thought. \"Some hunter most likely. Wonder who it can be.\" And he strode forward to find out.     CHAPTER IV  CHET GREENE'S PAST   \"Hello, Andy!\"  \"Hello, Chet! I never expected to find you here! This is a real pleasure!\" And Andy rushed into the old cabin, threw down his luggage, and grasped another lad by the hand.  \"And I never expected you to come here tonight,\" said Chetwood Greene, as a smile lit up his somewhat square face. \"I thought I was booked to camp here alone. What brought you, hunting?\"  \"Not exactly. It's a long story, Chet. Say, I'm glad you have a fire. I'm half frozen from tramping through the woods. The snow was pretty deep in spots.\"  \"I know all about it, for I have been out all day. Here, draw up to the blaze. I was just getting supper ready. You've got some game, I see. I had very little luck--three rabbits and a wild turkey. I looked for deer, but it was no use.\"  \"You've got to go pretty well back for deer these days,\" answered Andy.  \"Thought you were going to strike Storburgh for a job.\"  \"So I did, but it's the same story everywhere.\"  \"Too bad! Well, you are no worse off than myself. I'm sick of even asking for work. I've about made up my mind to try my luck at hunting. I guess I can bring down enough to live on, and that's better than starving.\"  Chetwood Greene, always called Chet for short, was about the same age as Andy, but a trifle taller. He had a square chin, and dark, piercing eyes, that fairly shot forth fire when Chet was provoked. He was a good fellow in the main, but he had a hasty temper that occasionally got him into much trouble. Andy liked him very much, and the two boys were more or less chums.  There was a mystery surrounding Chet which few folks in that district knew. Many supposed that both of his parents were dead. But the fact of the matter was that Chet's father disappeared when the lad was fourteen years old. Some thought him dead, while others imagined he had run away to escape punishment incidental to a large transaction in lumber. Some signatures were forged, and it was held that Tolney Greene was guilty. He protested his innocence, but failed to stand trial, running away \"between two days,\" as it was termed. He was traced to New Bedford, and there it was reported that he had last been seen boarding a sailing vessel outward bound. What had become of him after that, nobody knew.  Mrs. Greene had believed her husband innocent, and it grieved her greatly to be thus deserted. She tried to bear up, however, but during the following winter contracted pneumonia, and died, leaving Chet alone in the world.  Nobody seemed to want anything to do with the lad--thinking him the son of a forger, and possibly a suicide. Some tried to talk to him, but when they mentioned the supposed guilt of his parent, he flew into a rage.  \"My father wasn't guilty, and you needn't say so!\" he stormed. \"If you say it I'll lick you!\" And then he knocked one man flat. He was subdued after a while, but he refused utterly to live with those who offered him a home, saying he did not want to be an object of charity, and that he could get along alone. He took his belongings, and a little money left by his mother, and moved to another part of the State--close to where Andy resided. Here he lived with an old guide for a while, and then got employment at one of the lumber camps. The old guide had departed during the past year for the Adirondacks, and Chet was now living alone, in a cabin that had seen better days.  It had been no easy matter for Andy and Chet to become chums. At first when they met, at a lumber camp where both were employed, Chet was silent and morose. But little by little, warmed by Andy's naturally sunny disposition, he \"thawed out,\" and told his story in all its details. He knew a few things that the general public did not know, and these he confided to Andy.  \"My father went off on a whaler named the _Betsey Andrews_,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38968"],["title","First at the North Pole; Or, Two Boys in the Arctic Circle (#4)"],["body","once said. \"He said he would come back some day and clear himself. The mate wrote to my mother that my father's mind was affected a little, but he hoped he would be all right by the end of the trip.\"  \"Well, hasn't the _Betsey Andrews_ got back yet?\" had been Andy's question.  \"No.\"  \"Where is she?\"  \"That's the worst part of it--nobody knows.\"  \"Do you think she was lost?\"  \"I hope not--but I don't know,\" had been Chet's somewhat sad answer. He lived in daily hope of hearing from his parent again.  Chet knew Andy's story, of Josiah Graham's meanness and laziness, and of the papers left by Andy's father, and he now listened with deep interest to what his chum had to tell about the visit of Mr. A. Q. Hopton, and of the escape through the bedroom window.  \"Now what do you make of the whole thing, Chet?\" asked Andy, after he had finished his recital.  \"It looks to me as if this real estate dealer was mighty anxious to get the papers,\" was the answer. \"And that means that the papers are valuable.\"  \"Just what I think.\"  \"Your uncle has no right to sell 'em for three hundred dollars, or any other amount,\" pursued Chet. \"I understand enough about law to know that he's got to get a court order to sell property. To my way of thinking, he'd like to do this on the sly, and pocket the three hundred. He's no good, even if he is your uncle.\"  \"He's only my father's half-brother, and he always was a poor stick. I wish I knew of some lawyer to go to.\"  \"Why not try Mr. Jennings, over at Lodgeport? I've heard he's a good man, and smart, too.\"  \"I might try him. But it's a twelve-mile tramp.\"  \"Never mind, I'll go along, and we may be able to pick up some game on the way,\" answered Chet.  The boys talked the matter over for two hours, during which time Chet prepared supper, and the two ate it. Then Andy fixed the fire for the night, and the boys turned in, tired out from their long tramps through the snow.  It took some time for Andy to get to sleep, for the events of the day had disturbed him greatly. But at last he dozed off, and neither he nor Chet awoke until it was daylight.  \"Phew! but it's cold!\" cried Chet, as he put his head out of doors. \"And it snowed a little last night, too.\"  \"Is it snowing now?\" questioned Andy, anxiously. His mind was on the trip to Lodgeport. A heavy fall of snow might mean much delay.  \"No, the storm is clearing away.\"  \"Then let us get breakfast and start.\"  Both of the youths had been camping so often that they knew exactly what to do. The fire was stirred up, and fresh wood put on, and they prepared a couple of cups of coffee, and broiled two squirrels. They had bread and crackers, and a little cheese, and thus made quite a good breakfast.  The meal over, they lost no time in packing up, and placing the larger portion of their outfits in hiding in the old cabin. To carry them to Lodgeport would have been too much of a load.  \"We can carry a little food and our guns,\" said Chet. \"If we can't get back tonight, we can return tomorrow. I don't believe anybody will come here during that time.\"  \"I hope I don't meet Uncle Si--or Mr. Hopton,\" said Andy.  \"We can watch out and easily keep out of their way.\"  To get to the road that led to Lodgeport, the two lads had to cross a heavy patch of timber. Here, under the pines, it was intensely cold, and they had to move along rapidly to keep their blood in circulation.  \"Talk about Greenland's icy mountains, I guess this is bad enough!\" cried Chet, as he slapped his hands to keep them warm.  \"We'll soon be out in the sunlight again,\" answered Andy. But he was mistaken, for by the time they reached the open country once more, the sun had gone under a fringe of light clouds, so it was as cold as ever.  At the end of four miles they passed through one of the lumber settlements, and then, leaving the wagon road, took to a trail running in the neighborhood of Moose Ridge.  \"I met a man yesterday who was coming out to the Ridge to hunt,\" said Andy. \"Wonder if he'll have any success.\"  \"Hunting is not as good as it might be,\" answered his chum. \"The best of the game was killed off at the very beginning of the season. Still, he may get some deer, or a moose, if he's a good hunter.\"  \"I'd like to get a moose myself, Chet.\"  \"Oh, so would I. If you see one, kindly point him out to me.\" And Chet's usually serious face showed a grin.  \"I will--after I have brought him down with my gun,\" answered Andy, and then both laughed.  Less than fifteen minutes later they came on the trail of a deer. The marks were so fresh, both boys could not resist the temptation to go after the game. They plunged through some bushes, and Andy went headlong into a hollow.  \"Wuow!\" he spluttered, as the snow got into his ears and down his neck. \"What a tumble!\"  \"Maybe you're training for a circus,\" cried Chet.  \"Not out here--and in this cold. Help me up, will you?\"  Chet gave his chum a hand, and slowly Andy came out of the hollow. He had dropped his firearm, but this was easily recovered from the snowdrift.  \"I don't want another such tumble,\" said the unfortunate one, as he tried to get the snow out of his coat collar. \"I'm cold enough already.\"  Once more they went on, after the deer, but the game had evidently heard their voices and taken fright, for when they came to a long, open stretch, no living creature was in sight.  Another mile was covered in the direction of Lodgeport, and then they reached one end of the rock elevation locally termed Moose Ridge. Here there was a good-sized cliff, with smaller cliffs branching off in various directions.  \"There used to be some good hunting around here,\" said Chet, as, having climbed a small rise, they paused to catch their breath. \"I once brought down a dandy buck over yonder.\"  He had scarcely spoken, when from a distance ahead there sounded out the crack of a rifle, followed, a few moments later, by a second report.  \"Somebody is out!\" cried Andy. \"Wonder if he hit what he was aiming at.\"  \"Maybe we'll see. Come ahead.\"  \"I hope he isn't shooting this way.\"  \"The reports came from the top of the big cliff.\"  The two boys moved on, keeping their eyes on the alert for the possible appearance of the hunter who had fired the two shots.  \"Look! look!\" cried Andy, suddenly, and pointing over the top of a small tree that stood between them and the big cliff ahead.  \"What did you see?\"  \"Maybe I was mistaken, but I thought I saw a man tumble off the cliff!\"  \"A man? Perhaps it was a deer, or a moose.\"  \"No, it looked like a man to me. Come on! If he fell to the bottom he may be killed!\"  Andy set off as rapidly as the depth of the snow permitted, and Chet followed in his footsteps. Soon they rounded half a dozen trees and came in full view of the big cliff. Both uttered cries of horror, and with good reason.  Halfway down the edge of the cliff was a narrow ledge, and on this rested the body of a man,--a hunter, as was shown by his gun and game bag. He had tumbled from the top of the cliff, and the fall had rendered him unconscious. He lay half over the edge of the ledge, and was in imminent danger of falling still further and killing himself.     CHAPTER V  THE MAN ON THE LEDGE   \"Is he dead?\" questioned Chet, in a strained voice.  \"I don't know--but I don't think so,\" answered Andy. \"He has certainly had a nasty tumble.\"  \"It looks to me as if he was going to tumble the rest of the way, unless he holds on.\"  \"Let us see if we can't help him.\"  Both youths stood their guns against a tree, and made their way to the bottom of the cliff. As they did this, they saw the man's body shift slightly, and then came a low moan.  \"He's alive!\" cried Andy. \"Hi, there!\" he shouted. \"Look out for yourself, or you'll get another tumble!\"  To this, the man on the ledge did not answer. But the boys, listening intently, heard him moan again.  \"I wonder if we can get at him?\" mused Chet. \"I don't see any way up the cliff from here, do you?\"  \"Oh, we must find a way to get to him!\" cried Andy.  \"Maybe we can catch him if he falls. If we--Look out!\"  Andy leaped to one side, and the next instant the man's gun dropped down on the rocks and fell in the snow. The game bag followed. They now saw the man in his unconscious state turn partly over.  \"He'll fall sure, unless we help him,\" said Chet. \"But I don't know what to do.\"  \"I have it,\" returned his chum. \"Come on.\"  \"Where to?\"  \"I'll show you.\"  Wondering what his friend had in mind to do, Chet followed Andy to where was located an ash sapling of fair size. It had been broken off about two feet above the ground--how, they could not tell.  \"We can put that against the cliff, and use it as a ladder,\" said Andy.  \"Provided we can get it over, Andy.\"  Both began to tug at the sapling, and at last got it free from the stump end. Then they fairly rushed with it to the bottom of the cliff.  \"You hold the end, and I'll raise it up,\" said Chet, who was a little the stronger of the two. \"We can put the top right against the man, and that will keep him from rolling down.\"  \"If it will reach that far.\"  \"I think it will.\"  Their experience as lumbermen stood them in good stead, and while Andy kept the bottom of the ash sapling from slipping in the snow, his chum raised it slowly but steadily, until it stood upright. Then Chet let it go over against the cliff with care, so that the man might not be further injured. The little tree reached several feet above the man's head.  \"I'll go up and see what I can do for him,\" said Andy, throwing off his overcoat. \"You steady the tree, Chet.\"  \"All right. But be careful.\"  From early boyhood days Andy had been a good climber, and he went up the ash sapling with ease. The young tree was strong, so there was no danger of its breaking beneath his weight. Soon his feet touched the ledge, and he knelt down beside the hurt man.  \"Why, I know him!\" he called down to his chum. \"He's the man I told you about--the one who asked me about the road to Moose Ridge.\"  \"Pull him back, before he has a"]]]
