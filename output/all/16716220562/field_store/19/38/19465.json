The kettle wasn't really spoiled, and while the water was heating in it for the dishes, Jean took up the little yellow book and said to Jock,  \"Come here now, laddie, and see if you can say your catechism. Do you ken what is the chief end of man?\"  \"Dod, and I do,\" answered Jock. \"You let me spier the questions.\"  \"No,\" answered Jean firmly. \"I'll spier them first myself.\"  \"You're thinking I can't answer,\" said Jock. \"I'll fool you.\"  He stood up as straight as a whole row of soldiers and fired off the answer all in one breath.  \"The-chief-end-of-man-is-to-glorify-God-and-enjoy-Him-forever,\" he shouted.  Jean nodded approvingly. \"You ken that one all right, but that is the first one in the book and everybody knows that one. Now I'm going to skip around.\"  \"Don't skip,\" urged Jock. \"Take them just the way they come. I can remember 'em better.\"  But Jean gave no quarter. \"What is predestination?\" she demanded.  This was a poser, but Jock tackled it bravely.  \"Whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to-to-\" he got so far and stuck.  \"To what?\" asked Jean.  \"To be reformed,\" Jock hazarded, wallowing in difficulties.  \"Conformed,\" corrected Jean. \"You don't know that one at all! What is Saving Grace?\"  Jock fell down entirely on saving grace. \"It's a--It's a--\" he began. Then he bit his lip and scowled, and looked up at the ham hanging from the rafters, and out of the windows, but as nothing more about saving grace occurred to him he said, \"Aw, Jean, I know, but I can't think.\"  \"If you knew, you wouldn't have to think,\" Jean retorted, and then she made him take the book and sit down on the stool by the window and learn both answers while she finished the dishes.  It was ten miles to the village and back, and there was no way to get there except by walking, but the Campbells would sooner have thought of going without their food than of staying away from the Kirk, and so by eight o'clock they were all dressed in their best clothes and ready to start. They left True Tammas sitting on the doorstep with his ears drooped and his eyes looking very sorrowful. He wanted to go with them, but he knew well that he must stay at home to guard the sheep from stray dogs.  It was springtime, and the world was so lovely that the troubles the little family had faced the evening before seemed far away and impossible in the morning light. It was as if they had awakened from a bad dream. Who could help being happy on such a morning? The birds were flying about with straw and bits of wool in their bills to weave into their nests, and singing as if they would split their little throats. The river splashed and gurgled and sang as it dashed over its rocky bed on its way to the sea. From the village came the distant music of the church bells. The hawthorn was in bloom, and the river-banks and roadsides were gay with dandelions and violets, daisies and buttercups. Far away the mountains lifted their blue summits to the sky, and on a nearer hill they could see the gray towers of the castle of the Laird of Glen Cairn.  The bell was ringing its final summons and all the people were pouring into the little vestibule as the Campbells reached the steps of the Kirk. Angus Niel pushed past them, looking as puffy as a turkey-cock with its feathers spread, and glaring at the Twins so fiercely that Jock whispered to Jean, \"If I poked my finger at him I believe he'd gobble,\" and made her almost laugh aloud. When they passed Mr. Craigie, who held the plate for people to drop their money in, Jean whispered to Jock, \"He looks for all the world like a pair of tongs in his blacks, he's that tall and thin,\" and then Jock certainly would have laughed outright if he hadn't seen Mrs. Crumpet's eye on him.  The sermon was very long and the seats were hard and high, but the service did come to an end at last, although Jock was sure it was never going to, and afterward the children with their father stood about in the churchyard for a little while talking to their neighbors and friends.  The farm of Andrew Crumpet lay in the same direction as the home of the Campbells, so it was natural that they should walk along together and that the two men should talk about the thing that was uppermost in their minds. Mrs. Crumpet had gone on ahead with another neighbor, and Sandy Crumpet, who was twelve too, and had yellow hair, a snub nose, and freckles like Jock's own, walked with the Twins behind the two fathers. As they turned into the road, the children heard Andrew say, with a heavy sigh: \"Aye, Robin, we must just make up our minds to it. The Auld Laird's bent on getting us out.\"  \"Has Mr. Craigie given you notice, too?\" asked the Shepherd.  \"Aye, has he,\" Andrew answered with bitterness, \"and short work he made of it. It means little to him telling a man to leave his home and go out in the world to seek new work at our time of life.\"  \"He passes for a religious man,\" said the Shepherd.  \"So did the Pharisee in the temple,\" said Andrew, \"but 'by their fruits ye shall know them,' and we're not gathering any figs off of Mr. Craigie, nor grapes from that thorn of an Auld Laird that I can see!\"  \"Nor from Angus Niel, either,\" agreed Robin Campbell. \"The Auld Laird's servants are of a piece with himself.\"  \"Fine I ken that,\" answered Andrew.  \"Well,\" sighed the Shepherd, \"the toad under the harrow cannot be expected to praise the plowman, and we're just like the toad.\"  \"Very true,\" said Andrew, \"but the toad has the best of it. We are being destroyed; not that some one may till the land, but that it may go to waste, and be kept out of use. We suffer that the rich may be richer and the poor poorer, that less food may be produced instead of more. I tell you, Robin, it is not justice.\"  \"It may be so. It may be so,\" sighed the Shepherd, \"but it is the law, and we must just submit.\"  The two men walked on in silence to the bridge, where the Crumpets turned, while the Campbells kept on beside the river. The children were silent, too, only calling out \"Good-bye\" to Sandy as they parted, Jock adding, \"Come on by to-morrow if you can,\" and Sandy, waving his hand, calling back, \"Aye, will I.\"  As the Twins and their father neared the \"wee bit hoosie,\" Tam came bounding down the brae to meet them, and in less time than it takes to tell it Jean had run into the house, taken off her Sabbath dress, and put on her old one, with her kitchen apron over it, had mended the fire and heated the broth, and the little family was seated about the table eating their frugal meal with appetites sharpened by their long walk.  The afternoon seemed endless to the children, for they spent it trying hard not to do any of the things they wanted to do. They studied the catechism while their father sat with his bonnet on his head nodding over the Bible, and the wag-at-the-wall clock ticked the hours solemnly away. Jock whispered to Jean that he didn't see why Sunday was so much longer than any other day, and didn't believe her when she said it wasn't really that it only seemed so.     IV. THE NEW BOY   Usually Jean and Jock went to school in summer, for in winter the snow made the roads impassable, but at this time the Dominie was ill and until he should get well they had the long days to themselves. When breakfast was over the next morning and the Shepherd had gone with Tam to the hills, Jean decided to wash the clothes. Sandy Crumpet came early, and the two boys went off to play, leaving Jean standing on a stone in the middle of the burn, soaping the clothes and scrubbing them on the flat surface of a rock. The water was so cold it made her arms ache, and she soon decided to let the fast-running stream do the washing for her. She soaped the garments well, weighted them down with stones, and then went to join the boys. She found them flat on their stomachs by the stream, gazing down into a pool of clear water.  \"What do you see?\" she called out to them.  \"Trout,\" answered Jock, his eyes shining with excitement.  \"Let me take a keek,\" said Jean, flopping down beside them and craning her neck over the edge.  They were all three peering with breathless interest into the water when a strange voice behind them made them jump. For an instant they thought it might be Angus Niel.  \"Hello!\" said the voice.  The children whirled around, and there before them stood a boy not much older than themselves, but taller and thinner. He had a pale face with large black eyes and dark hair partly covered with a Glengarry bonnet set rakishly over one ear. He wore a suit of gray tweed with plaid-topped stockings, and carried a fishing-rod over his shoulder.  \"Hello!\" said the stranger again.  \"Hello, yourself!\" responded Jock.  Jean and Sandy were so relieved to find it wasn't Angus Niel that for an instant they merely gazed at him without speaking.  \"What's there?\" asked the new boy.  \"Fish,\" said Jock.  \"Fish!\" cried the new boy, shifting his rod into position. \"Where? Let me have a crack at 'em!\"  \"Na, na, don't be so hasty,\" cried Jock, heading him off. \"You'll get yourself into trouble! Angus Niel would be after you in no time, and if he caught you, he'd cuff your lug for you, and drag you before the bailie for poaching!\"  \"Who's Angus Niel?\" demanded the boy. \"I'm not afraid of him.\"  \"Not yet,\" answered Jock, \"but just go on and you will be! He's gamekeeper to the Laird, and he'd rather do for you than not. Aye, he'd just like the feel of you in his fingers, he would.\" Jock rubbed his ear. \"It's but two days gone since he nearly pulled the lug off me because I was running after a rabbit that was eating up our garden. He's terrible suspicious, is Angus, and he's mad at us besides.\"  \"What for?\" asked the boy.  \"I stepped on him by accident,\" explained Jock, \"and butted him into the burn.\"  \"No wonder he was mad,\" laughed the boy. \"Come on, now. Surely a body can fish. There's no law against that!\"  \"Well,\" said Sandy, \"law or no"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4086"],["title","The Scotch Twins (#4)"],["body","aw, Angus is against it, and the Auld Laird is terrible particular. He's going to turn out all the farmers in this region and make it into a great game preserve. Nothing else. You're strange hereabouts, I doubt, or you'd ken all this yourself. Where are you from?\"  \"I'm from London,\" replied the boy. \"I'm staying with Eppie McLean at the castle.\"  \"Are you, now?\" gasped Sandy. \"Is Eppie your aunt, maybe? She'll be telling you about Angus herself.\"  \"Eppie's not my aunt,\" said the boy. \"She's a friend of my mother, and my mother got her to take me in because I've been sick, and she thought I'd get strong up here, and I'm not going to have my summer spoiled by Angus Niel or any other old bogie man. Stand back now while I cast.\"  He swung his rod over his head, and the fly fell with a flop in the middle of the pool. He waited a breathless instant while Jock, Sandy, and Jean watched the fly with him, and then, as nothing happened, he cast again. When several such attempts brought no result, he said, \"You're sure they 're there?\"  \"They're lying at the bottom as soft as a baby in a cradle,\" said Jean. \"I could catch them with a skimmer! Gin they don't bite, maybe I'll try it!\"  Jock looked at Jean in amazement.  \"You're a braw lassie, Jean Campbell,\" he said severely, \"and you just telling about Angus Niel!\"  \"T'was yourself and Sandy here telling about Angus Niel,\" Jean answered. \"I said nothing at all about him. I'm not afraid of him, either.\"  \"Good for you!\" said the new boy with admiration. \"You can have a turn with my rod. Try it once before you get the skimmer!\"  Jean sprang to her feet and took the rod, though she had never had one like it in her hand before. She made a mighty sweep with it as she had seen the new boy do, but somehow the fly flew off in an unexpected direction and caught in a tree, while the line wound itself in a hopeless snarl around the tip. Jock and Sandy, who had stood by, green with envy, clapped their hands over their mouths and danced with mirth.  \"It looks easy,\" said poor Jean mournfully, \"but maybe I'd best stick to the skimmer when I fish.\"  \"Oh, it always does that the first time,\" said the new boy comfortingly, as he rescued the fly and straightened out the line.  \"When a girl tries to do it,\" added Jock witheringly.  The new boy held out the rod.  \"You try it,\" he said to Jock, and Jock, full of confidence, did not wait for a second invitation.  \"Look here, Jean,\" he said. \"This is the way you do it.\"  He swung the rod with a mighty flourish over his head, bud alas, the fly surprised him too. It caught in Sandy's trousers and surprised Sandy as well. Not only that, it scratched him.  \"Ow!\" howled Sandy, leaping about like a monkey on the end of the string. \"Leave go of me!\"  There was a snarl even worse than Jean's, too, and between that and Sandy's jumping about it was some time before the line was disentangled and the hook freed so that Sandy was able to take his turn. Jean, meanwhile, said nothing at all, for Jock looked so crestfallen that she hadn't the heart. When Sandy tried it things were still worse, for the fly flew about so wildly that Jock and Jean fled before it and hid behind some bushes.  \"Whoever could catch fish with such gewgaws as them anyway?\" said Sandy scornfully, when a second attempt brought no better result. \"The fish aren't used to it.\"  Jock rolled up his sleeves, crept to the side of the burn, and looked over into the pool.  \"Hold to me, Sandy,\" he said, and Sandy immediately sat down on his legs. Then Jock suddenly plunged his arms into the water and before the fish could whisk their tails he had caught one in his hand and thrown it on the grass.  Springing to his feet and upsetting Sandy, he jumped to a rock in the middle of the brook and caught two more. It was now the new boy's turn to be astonished. Apparently Jock had stirred up a whole school of trout, for Sandy, following Jock's lead, also leaped into the stream, and in a few moments six fine trout were flopping about the grass.  \"Let's build a fire and cook them,\" urged the new boy, whose name they soon learned was Alan McRae. \"And if old Angus Niel comes nosing around we'll offer him a bite! He can do nothing with four of us, anyway, unless he shoots us, and he'd hang for that. Come on!\"  By this time they were all so thrilled with the sport and were having such fun that nobody thought any more about Angus anyway, so Jean ran for a pan, while Jock and Sandy cleaned the fish with Alan's knife, and Alan gathered dry twigs and bracken for the fire. Jean brought down some scones, which she split and spread with butter while the fish were frying. When they were done to a golden brown she put a hot fish on each piece of scone and handed them out to the boys, and when they had eaten every scrap they buried the fish-bones in case Angus should come that way.  After lunch Jean went to wring out the clothes and hang them on the bushes to dry, while Jock and Sandy examined Alan's wonderful book of flies and his reel, and even the creel in which he was to have put the fish, if he had caught any.  \"Losh, man!\" exclaimed Sandy, swaggering about with his hands in his pockets, \"that's all very well. Aye, it's a good game, and you might go dandering along a stream all day playing with it, but if you really want fish, just go after 'em yourself! That's my way. Guddling for trout like you saw me and Jock do, that's the real sport!\"  \"I believe you,\" said Alan. \"I'm going to try it myself. Come on. Let's go farther up stream and see if we can find another good fishing-hole. I told Eppie I'd bring her a fish to her tea, and I'd hate to go back with nothing at all,\" and the three boys disappeared in the woods.  Jean finished her work by the brook and went to the house to make more scones, for the picnic had exhausted the supply and they used no other bread. She bustled about the kitchen, mixing, spreading them on the girdle over the fire, keeping the coals bright, and turning them out nicely browned on the mixing-board. She was just finishing the sixth one, when there was a great thumping at the door, and she ran to see what was the matter. There on the doorstep stood the three boys, Alan dripping wet from head to heel, shivering with cold, and with mud and water running from him in streams. Jean threw up her hands.  \"It's most michty,\" she cried, \"if I can't ever bake scones in this kitchen without some man body coming in half drowned to mess up my clean floor! However did you go and drop yourself in the burn, Alan McRae? 'Deed and I wonder that your mother lets you go out alone, you're that careless with yourself. And you not long out of a sick bed, too.\"  \"He was guddling for trout,\" shouted Jock and Sandy in one breath; \"and the hole was deep. There was no one sitting on him, and syne over he went!\"  Jean seized Alan by the shoulder and drew him into the kitchen, and set him to drip on the hearth while she gave her orders.  \"Jock, do you fill the basin with warm water, and you, Sandy, put more peat on the fire. He must have a rinse with hot water and something hot to drink.\"  \"What'll he do for clothes?\" cried Jock.  \"Dinna fash yourself about clothes,\" said Jean, rummaging furiously in the \"kist.\" \"I'm laying out Father's old kilts he had when he was a boy. He can put them on till his own things are dry. Here's a towel for you,\" she added, tossing one to Alan. \"Rub yourself down well, and when you've dressed, just give a chap at the door, and I'll come in and get you a sup of tea.\"  Then she disappeared. You can imagine what the kitchen looked like when she came back again. Alan's wet clothes were spread out on her father's chair by the fire, and Alan, gorgeous in his plaid kiltie, was strutting back and forth giving an imitation of the bagpipes on his nose, with Jock and Sandy marching behind him singing \"Do ye ken John Peel with his coat so gay\" at the top of their lungs.  \"Have you gone clean daft?\" Jean shouted. \"Sit down by the fire and get out of my way while I mop up after you!\"  The boys each seized one of the kitchen stools without stopping the song and marched with it to the hearth, and when they came to \"Peel's view halloo would awaken the dead,\" they gave a howl that nearly brought down the ham from the rafters as they banged them down on the hearth-stones. Jean clapped her hands over her ears and ran for the mop, and in no time at all the puddles had disappeared and the boys were drinking tea by the fire.  Of course, Alan had no shoes to put on because his were soaking wet, and as it was now late in the afternoon it began to be a question how he should get back to the castle. It was still cold for going barefoot, and he was not used to it besides, and his clothes certainly would not be fit to put on for a long time. They held a consultation. Alan thought he could go without shoes.  \"You'll do nothing of the kind,\" said Jean firmly. \"What sickness was it you had, anyway?\"  \"Measles,\" said Alan, looking ashamed of it.  \"Measles!\" shouted Sandy. \"That's naught but a baby disease. My little sister had that. Sal, but I've had worse things the matter with me! I've had the fever, and once I cut my toe with the axe!\"  \"Hold your tongue, Sandy,\" said Jean, \"and dinna boast! If Alan's had measles he can't go back to the castle barefoot; so you must just be stepping yourself, and stop by at the castle to tell Eppie McLean that Alan will bide here till his things are dry.\"  Sandy rose reluctantly and set down his empty mug.  \"Well, then, if I must, I must,\" he said, and started off down the hill whistling.     V. EVENING IN THE WEE BIT HOOSIE   When he was out of sight, Jean brought in the washing and then it was time to get supper. Alan helped set the table and kept the fire bright under the pot, while Jock fed the hens and brought in the eggs; and when the Shepherd and Tam returned from the hills, you can imagine how surprised they were to find three children waiting for them instead of two. At supper "]]]
