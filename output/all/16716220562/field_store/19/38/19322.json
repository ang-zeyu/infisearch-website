You can understand that I can’t release a gentleman who administers sleeping-draughts, who escapes by the window and who is afterward caught in the act of trespassing upon private property. I can’t release him without a compensation of some kind.”  “I await your pleasure.”  “Well, we will resume our interrupted conversation and you shall tell me how far you have advanced with your investigations. In two days of liberty, you must have carried them pretty far?” And, as Ganimard was preparing to go, with an affectation of contempt for that sort of practice, the magistrate cried, “Not at all, M. Inspector, your place is here—I assure you that M. Isidore Beautrelet is worth listening to. M. Isidore Beautrelet, according to my information, has made a great reputation at the Lycée Janson-de-Sailly as an observer whom nothing escapes; and his schoolfellows, I hear, look upon him as your competitor and a rival of Holmlock Shears!”  “Indeed!” said Ganimard, ironically.  “Just so. One of them wrote to me, ‘If Beautrelet declares that he knows, you must believe him; and, whatever he says, you may be sure that it is the exact expression of the truth.’ M. Isidore Beautrelet, now or never is the time to vindicate the confidence of your friends. I beseech you, give us the exact expression of the truth.”  Isidore listened with a smile and replied:  “Monsieur le Juge d’Instruction, you are very cruel. You make fun of poor schoolboys who amuse themselves as best they can. You are quite right, however, and I will give you no further reason to laugh at me.”  “The fact is that you know nothing, M. Isidore Beautrelet.”  “Yes, I confess in all humility that I know nothing. For I do not call it ‘knowing anything’ that I happen to have hit upon two or three more precise points which, I am sure, cannot have escaped you.”  “For instance?”  “For instance, the object of the theft.”  “Ah, of course, you know the object of the theft?”  “As you do, I have no doubt. In fact, it was the first thing I studied, because the task struck me as easier.”  “Easier, really?”  “Why, of course. At the most, it’s a question of reasoning.”  “Nothing more than that?”  “Nothing more.”  “And what is your reasoning?”  “It is just this, stripped of all extraneous comment: on the one hand, _there has been a theft_, because the two young ladies are agreed and because they really saw two men running away and carrying things with them.”  “There has been a theft.”  “On the other hand, _nothing has disappeared_, because M. de Gesvres says so and he is in a better position than anybody to know.”  “Nothing has disappeared.”  “From those two premises I arrive at this inevitable result: granted that there has been a theft and that nothing has disappeared, it is because the object carried off has been replaced by an exactly similar object. Let me hasten to add that possibly my argument may not be confirmed by the facts. But I maintain that it is the first argument that ought to occur to us and that we are not entitled to waive it until we have made a serious examination.”  “That’s true—that’s true,” muttered the magistrate, who was obviously interested.  “Now,” continued Isidore, “what was there in this room that could arouse the covetousness of the burglars? Two things. The tapestry first. It can’t have been that. Old tapestry cannot be imitated: the fraud would have been palpable at once. There remain the four Rubens pictures.”  “What’s that you say?”  “I say that the four Rubenses on that wall are false.”  “Impossible!”  “They are false _a priori_, inevitably and without a doubt.”  “I tell you, it’s impossible.”  “It is very nearly a year ago, Monsieur le Juge d’Instruction, since a young man, who gave his name as Charpenais, came to the Château d’Ambrumésy and asked permission to copy the Rubens pictures. M. de Gesvres gave him permission. Every day for five months Charpenais worked in this room from morning till dusk. The copies which he made, canvases and frames, have taken the place of the four original pictures bequeathed to M. de Gesvres by his uncle, the Marqués de Bobadilla.”  “Prove it!”  “I have no proof to give. A picture is false because it is false; and I consider that it is not even necessary to examine these four.”  M. Filleul and Ganimard exchanged glances of unconcealed astonishment. The inspector no longer thought of withdrawing. At last, the magistrate muttered:  “We must have M. de Gesvres’s opinion.”  And Ganimard agreed:  “Yes, we must have his opinion.”  And they sent to beg the count to come to the drawing room.  The young sixth-form pupil had won a real victory. To compel two experts, two professionals like M. Filleul and Ganimard to take account of his surmises implied a testimony of respect of which any other would have been proud. But Beautrelet seemed not to feel those little satisfactions of self-conceit and, still smiling without the least trace of irony, he placidly waited.  M. de Gesvres entered the room.  “Monsieur le Comte,” said the magistrate, “the result of our inquiry has brought us face to face with an utterly unexpected contingency, which we submit to you with all reserve. It is possible—I say that it is possible—that the burglars, when breaking into the house, had it as their object to steal your four pictures by Rubens—or, at least, to replace them by four copies—copies which are said to have been made last year by a painter called Charpenais. Would you be so good as to examine the pictures and to tell us if you recognize them as genuine?”  The count appeared to suppress a movement of annoyance, looked at Isidore Beautrelet and at M. Filleul and replied, without even troubling to go near the pictures:  “I hoped, Monsieur le Juge d’Instruction, that the truth might have remained unknown. As this is not so, I have no hesitation in declaring that the four pictures are false.”  “You knew it, then?”  “From the beginning.”  “Why didn’t you say so?”  “The owner of a work is never in a hurry to declare that that work is not—or, rather, is no longer genuine.”  “Still, it was the only means of recovering them.”  “I consider that there was another and a better.”  “Which was that?”  “Not to make the secret known, not to frighten my burglars and to offer to buy back the pictures, which they must find more or less difficult to dispose of.”  “How would you communicate with them?”  As the count did not reply, Isidore answered for him:  “By means of an advertisement in the papers. The paragraph inserted in the agony column of the _Journal_, the _Écho de Paris_ and the _Matin_ runs, ‘Am prepared to buy back the pictures.’”  The count agreed with a nod. Once again, the young man was teaching his elders. M. Filleul showed himself a good sportsman.  “There’s no doubt about it, my dear sir,” he exclaimed. “I’m beginning to think your school-fellows were not quite wrong. By Jove, what an eye! What intuition! If this goes on, there will be nothing left for M. Ganimard and me to do.”  “Oh, none of this part was so very complicated!”  “You mean to say that the rest was more so I remember, in fact, that, when we first met you seemed to know all about it. Let me see, a far as I recollect, you said that you knew the name of the murderer.”  “So I do.”  “Well, then, who killed Jean Daval? Is the man alive? Where is he hiding?”  “There is a misunderstanding between us, Monsieur le Juge d’Instruction, or, rather, you have misunderstood the facts from the beginning The murderer and the runaway are two distinct persons.”  “What’s that?” exclaimed M. Filleul. “The man whom M. de Gesvres saw in the boudoir and struggled with, the man whom the young ladies saw in the drawing-room and whom Mlle. de Saint-Véran shot at, the man who fell in the park and whom we are looking for: do you suggest that he is not the man who killed Jean Daval?”  “I do.”  “Have you discovered the traces of a third accomplice who disappeared before the arrival of the young ladies?”  “I have not.”  “In that case, I don’t understand.—Well, who is the murderer of Jean Daval?”  “Jean Daval was killed by—”  Beautrelet interrupted himself, thought for a moment and continued:  “But I must first show you the road which I followed to arrive at the certainty and the very reasons of the murder—without which my accusation would seem monstrous to you.—And it is not—no, it is not monstrous at all.—There is one detail which has passed unobserved and which, nevertheless, is of the greatest importance; and that is that Jean Daval, at the moment when he was stabbed, had all his clothes on, including his walking boots, was dressed, in short, as a man is dressed in the middle of the day, with a waistcoat, collar, tie and braces. Now the crime was committed at four o’clock in the morning.”  “I reflected on that strange fact,” said the magistrate, “and M. de Gesvres replied that Jean Daval spent a part of his nights in working.”  “The servants say, on the contrary, that he went to bed regularly at a very early hour. But, admitting that he was up, why did he disarrange his bedclothes, to make believe that he had gone to bed? And, if he was in bed, why, when he heard a noise, did he take the trouble to dress himself from head to foot, instead of slipping on anything that came to hand? I went to his room on the first day, while you were at lunch: his slippers were at the foot of the bed. What prevented him from putting them on rather than his heavy nailed boots?”  “So far, I do not see—”  “So far, in fact, you cannot see anything, except anomalies. They appeared much more suspicious to me, however, when I learned that Charpenais the painter, the man who copied the Rubens pictures, had been introduced and recommended to the Comte de Gesvres by Jean Daval himself.”  “Well?”  “Well, from that to the conclusion that Jean Daval and Charpenais were accomplices required but a step. I took that step at the time of our conversation.”  “A little quickly, I think.”  “As a matter of fact, a material"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4017"],["title","The Hollow Needle; Further adventures of Arsene Lupin (#6)"],["body","was wanted. Now I had discovered in Daval’s room, on one of the sheets of the blotting-pad on which he used to write, this address: ‘Monsieur _A.L.N., Post-office_ 45, _Paris_.’ You will find it there still, traced the reverse way on the blotting-paper. The next day, it was discovered that the telegram sent by the sham flyman from Saint-Nicolas bore the same address: ‘_A.L.N., Post-office_ 45.’ The material proof existed: Jean Daval was in correspondence with the gang which arranged the robbery of the pictures.”  M. Filleul raised no objection.  “Agreed. The complicity is established. And what conclusion do you draw?”  “This, first of all, that it was not the runaway who killed Jean Daval, because Jean Daval was his accomplice.”  “And after that?”  “Monsieur le Juge d’Instruction, I will ask you to remember the first sentence uttered by Monsieur le Comte when he recovered from fainting. The sentence forms part of Mlle. de Gesvres’ evidence and is in the official report: ‘I am not wounded.—Daval?—Is he alive?—The knife?’ And I will ask you to compare it with that part of his story, also in the report, in which Monsieur le Comte describes the assault: ‘The man leaped at me and felled me with a blow on the temple!’ How could M. de Gesvres, who had fainted, know, on waking, that Daval had been stabbed with a knife?”  Isidore Beautrelet did not wait for an answer to his question. It seemed as though he were in a hurry to give the answer himself and to avoid all comment. He continued straightway:  “Therefore it was Jean Daval who brought the three burglars to the drawing room. While he was there with the one whom they call their chief, a noise was heard in the boudoir. Daval opened the door. Recognizing M. de Gesvres, he rushed at him, armed with the knife. M. de Gesvres succeeded in snatching the knife from him, struck him with it and himself fell, on receiving a blow from the man whom the two girls were to see a few minutes after.”  Once again, M. Filleul and the inspector exchanged glances. Ganimard tossed his head in a disconcerted way. The magistrate said:  “Monsieur le Comte, am I to believe that this version is correct?”  M. de Gesvres made no answer.  “Come, Monsieur le Comte, your silence would allow us to suppose—I beg you to speak.”  Replying in a very clear voice, M. de Gesvres said:  “The version is correct in every particular.”  The magistrate gave a start.  “Then I cannot understand why you misled the police. Why conceal an act which you were lawfully entitled to commit in defense of your life?”  “For twenty years,” said M. de Gesvres, “Daval worked by my side. I trusted him. If he betrayed me, as the result of some temptation or other, I was, at least, unwilling, for the sake of the past, that his treachery should become known.”  “You were unwilling, I agree, but you had no right to be.”  “I am not of your opinion, Monsieur le Juge d’Instruction. As long as no innocent person was accused of the crime, I was absolutely entitled to refrain from accusing the man who was at the same time the culprit and the victim. He is dead. I consider death a sufficient punishment.”  “But now, Monsieur le Comte, now that the truth is known, you can speak.”  “Yes. Here are two rough drafts of letters written by him to his accomplices. I took them from his pocket-book, a few minutes after his death.”  “And the motive of his theft?”  “Go to 18, Rue de la Barre, at Dieppe, which is the address of a certain Mme. Verdier. It was for this woman, whom he got to know two years ago, and to supply her constant need of money that Daval turned thief.”  So everything was cleared up. The tragedy rose out of the darkness and gradually appeared in its true light.  “Let us go on,” said M. Filluel after the count had withdrawn.  “Upon my word,” said Beautrelet, gaily, “I have said almost all that I had to say.”  “But the runaway, the wounded man?”  “As to that, Monsieur le Juge d’Instruction, you know as much as I do. You have followed his tracks in the grass by the cloisters—you have—”  “Yes, yes, I know. But, since then, his friends have removed him and what I want is a clue or two as regards that inn—”  Isidore Beautrelet burst out laughing:  “The inn! The inn does not exist! It’s an invention, a trick to put the police on the wrong scent, an ingenious trick, too, for it seems to have succeeded.”  “But Dr. Delattre declares—”  “Ah, that’s just it!” cried Beautrelet, in a tone of conviction. “It is just because Dr. Delattre declares that we mustn’t believe him. Why, Dr. Delattre refused to give any but the vaguest details concerning his adventure! He refused to say anything that might compromise his patient’s safety!—And suddenly he calls attention to an inn!—You may be sure that he talked about that inn because he was told to. You may be sure that the whole story which he dished up to us was dictated to him under the threat of terrible reprisals. The doctor has a wife. The doctor has a daughter. He is too fond of them to disobey people of whose formidable power he has seen proofs. And that is why he has assisted your efforts by supplying the most precise clues.”  “So precise that the inn is nowhere to be found.”  “So precise that you have never ceased looking for it, in the face of all probability, and that your eyes have been turned away from the only spot where the man can be, the mysterious spot which he has not left, which he has been unable to leave ever since the moment when, wounded by Mlle. de Saint-Véran, he succeeded in dragging himself to it, like a beast to its lair.”  “But where, confound it all?—In what corner of Hades—?”  “In the ruins of the old abbey.”  “But there are no ruins left!—A few bits of wall!—A few broken columns!”  “That’s where he’s gone to earth. Monsieur le Juge d’Instruction!” shouted Beautrelet. “That’s where you will have to look for him! It’s there and nowhere else that you will find Arsène Lupin!”  “Arsène Lupin!” yelled M. Filleul, springing to his feet.  There was a rather solemn pause, amid which the syllables of the famous name seemed to prolong their sound. Was it possible that the vanquished and yet invisible adversary, whom they had been hunting in vain for several days, could really be Arsène Lupin? Arsène Lupin, caught in a trap, arrested, meant immediate promotion, fortune, glory to any examining magistrate!  Ganimard had not moved a limb. Isidore said to him:  “You agree with me, do you not, M. Inspector?”  “Of course I do!”  “You have not doubted either, for a moment have you, that he managed this business?”  “Not for a second! The thing bears his signature. A move of Arsène Lupin’s is as different from a move made by another man as one face is from another. You have only to open your eyes.”  “Do you think so? Do you think so?” said M. Filleul.  “Think so!” cried the young man. “Look, here’s one little fact: what are the initials under which those men correspond among themselves? ‘A. L. N.,’ that is to say, the first letter of the name Arsène and the first and last letters of the name Lupin.”  “Ah,” said Ganimard, “nothing escapes you! Upon my word, you’re a fine fellow and old Ganimard lays down his arms before you!”  Beautrelet flushed with pleasure and pressed the hand which the chief-inspector held out to him. The three men had drawn near the balcony and their eyes now took in the extent of the ruins. M. Filleul muttered:  “So he ought to be there.”  “_He is there_,” said Beautrelet, in a hollow voice. “He has been there ever since the moment when he fell. Logically and practically, he could not escape without being seen by Mlle. de Saint-Véran and the two servants.”  “What proof have you?”  “His accomplices have furnished the proof. On the very morning, one of them disguised himself as a flyman and drove you here—”  “To recover the cap, which would serve to identify him.”  “Very well, but also and more particularly to examine the spot, find out and see for himself what had become of the ‘governor.’”  “And did he find out?”  “I presume so, as he knew the hiding-place. And I presume that he became aware of the desperate condition of his chief, because, under the impulse of his alarm, he committed the imprudence to write that threat: ‘Woe betide the young lady, if she has killed the governor!’”  “But his friends were able to take him away afterward?”  “When? Your men have never left the ruins. And where could they have moved him to? At most, a few hundred yards away, for one doesn’t let a dying man travel—and then you would have found him. No, I tell you, he is there. His friends would never have removed him from the safest of hiding-places. It was there that they brought the doctor, while the gendarmes were running to the fire like children.”  “But how is he living? How will he keep alive? To keep alive you need food and drink.”  “I can’t say. I don’t know. But he is there, I will swear it. He is there, because he can’t help being there. I am as sure of it as if I saw as if I touched him. He is there.”  With his finger outstretched toward the ruins, he traced in the air a little circle which became smaller and smaller until it was only a point. And that point his two companions sought desperately, both leaning into space, both moved by the same faith in Beautrelet and quivering with the ardent conviction which he had forced upon them. Yes, Arsène Lupin was there. In theory and in fact, he was there: neither of them was now able to doubt it.  And there was something impressive and tragic in knowing that the famous adventurer was lying in some dark shelter, below the ground, helpless, feverish and exhausted.  “And if he dies?” asked M. Filleul, in a low voice.  “If he dies,” said Beautrelet, “and if his accomplices are sure of it, then see to the safety of Mlle. de Saint-Véran. Monsieur le Juge d’Instruction, for the vengeance will be terrible.”  A few minutes later and in spite of the entreaties of M. Filleul, who would gladly have made further use of this fascinating auxiliary,"]]]
