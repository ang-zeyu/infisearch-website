Unless the gray matter is surging about in your cerebrum, as in mine, you can't hope--\"  Jimmy leaned back in his chair, and spoke calmly but with decision.  \"Any man of ordinary intelligence,\" he said, \"could break into a house.\"  Mifflin jumped up and began to gesticulate. This was heresy.  \"My good man, what absolute--\"  \"_I_ could,\" said Jimmy, lighting a cigarette.  There was a roar of laughter and approval. For the past few weeks, during the rehearsals of \"Love, the Cracksman,\" Arthur Mifflin had disturbed the peace at the Strollers' with his theories on the art of burglary. This was his first really big part, and he had soaked himself in it. He had read up the literature of burglary. He had talked with men from Pinkerton's. He had expounded his views nightly to his brother Strollers, preaching the delicacy and difficulty of cracking a crib till his audience had rebelled. It charmed the Strollers to find Jimmy, obviously of his own initiative and not to be suspected of having been suborned to the task by themselves, treading with a firm foot on the expert's favorite corn within five minutes of their meeting.  \"You!\" said Arthur Mifflin, with scorn.  \"I!\"  \"You! Why, you couldn't break into an egg unless it was a poached one.\"  \"What'll you bet?\" said Jimmy.  The Strollers began to sit up and take notice. The magic word \"bet,\" when uttered in that room, had rarely failed to add a zest to life. They looked expectantly at Arthur Mifflin.  \"Go to bed, Jimmy,\" said the portrayer of cracksmen. \"I'll come with you and tuck you in. A nice, strong cup of tea in the morning, and you won't know there has ever been anything the matter with you.\"  A howl of disapproval rose from the company. Indignant voices accused Arthur Mifflin of having a yellow streak. Encouraging voices urged him not to be a quitter.  \"See! They scorn you,\" said Jimmy. \"And rightly. Be a man, Arthur. What'll you bet?\"  Mr. Mifflin regarded him with pity.  \"You don't know what you're up against, Jimmy,\" he said. \"You're half a century behind the times. You have an idea that all a burglar needs is a mask, a blue chin, and a dark lantern. I tell you he requires a highly specialized education. I've been talking to these detective fellows, and I know. Now, take your case, you worm. Have you a thorough knowledge of chemistry, physics, toxicology--\"  \"Sure.\"  \"--electricity and microscopy?\"  \"You have discovered my secret.\"  \"Can you use an oxy-acetylene blow-pipe?\"  \"I never travel without one.\"  \"What do you know about the administration of anaesthetics?\"  \"Practically everything. It is one of my favorite hobbies.\"  \"Can you make 'soup'?\"  \"Soup?\"  \"Soup,\" said Mr. Mifflin, firmly.  Jimmy raised his eyebrows.  \"Does an architect make bricks?\" he said. \"I leave the rough preliminary work to my corps of assistants. They make my soup.\"  \"You mustn't think Jimmy's one of your common yeggs,\" said Sutton. \"He's at the top of his profession. That's how he made his money. I never did believe that legacy story.\"  \"Jimmy,\" said Mr. Mifflin, \"couldn't crack a child's money-box. Jimmy couldn't open a sardine-tin.\"  Jimmy shrugged his shoulders.  \"What'll you bet?\" he said again. \"Come on, Arthur; you're earning a very good salary. What'll you bet?\"  \"Make it a dinner for all present,\" suggested Raikes, a canny person who believed in turning the wayside happenings of life, when possible, to his personal profit.  The suggestion was well received.  \"All right,\" said Mifflin. \"How many of us are there? One, two, three, four--Loser buys a dinner for twelve.\"  \"A good dinner,\" interpolated Raikes, softly.  \"A good dinner,\" said Jimmy. \"Very well. How long do you give me, Arthur?\"  \"How long do you want?\"  \"There ought to be a time-limit,\" said Raikes. \"It seems to me that a flyer like Jimmy ought to be able to manage it at short notice. Why not tonight? Nice, fine night. If Jimmy doesn't crack a crib tonight, it's up to him. That suit you, Jimmy?\"  \"Perfectly.\"  Willett interposed. Willett had been endeavoring to drown his sorrows all the evening, and the fact was a little noticeable in his speech.  \"See here,\" he said, \"how's J-Jimmy going to prove he's done it?\"  \"Personally, I can take his word,\" said Mifflin.  \"That be h-hanged for a tale. Wha-what's to prevent him saying he's done it, whether he has or not?\"  The Strollers looked uncomfortable. Nevertheless, it was Jimmy's affair.  \"Why, you'd get your dinner in any case,\" said Jimmy. \"A dinner from any host would smell as sweet.\"  Willett persisted with muddled obstinacy.  \"Thash--thash not point. It's principle of thing. Have thish thing square and 'bove board, _I_ say. Thash what _I_ say.\"  \"And very creditable to you being able to say it,\" said Jimmy, cordially. \"See if you can manage 'Truly rural'.\"  \"What _I_ say is--this! Jimmy's a fakir. And what I say is what's prevent him saying he's done it when hasn't done it?\"  \"That'll be all right,\" said Jimmy. \"I'm going to bury a brass tube with the Stars and Stripes in it under the carpet.\"  Willett waved his hand.  \"Thash quite sh'factory,\" he said, with dignity. \"Nothing more to say.\"  \"Or a better idea,\" said Jimmy. \"I'll carve a big J on the inside of the front door. Then, anybody who likes can make inquiries next day. Well, I'm off home. Glad it's all settled. Anybody coming my way?\"  \"Yes,\" said Arthur Mifflin. \"We'll walk. First nights always make me as jumpy as a cat. If I don't walk my legs off, I shan't get to sleep tonight at all.\"  \"If you think I'm going to help you walk your legs off, my lad, you're mistaken. I propose to stroll gently home, and go to bed.\"  \"Every little helps,\" said Mifflin. \"Come along.\"  \"You want to keep an eye on Jimmy, Arthur,\" said Sutton. \"He'll sand-bag you, and lift your watch as soon as look at you. I believe he's Arsene Lupin in disguise.\"     CHAPTER II  PYRAMUS AND THISBE   The two men turned up the street. They walked in silence. Arthur Mifflin was going over in his mind such outstanding events of the evening as he remembered--the nervousness, the relief of finding that he was gripping his audience, the growing conviction that he had made good; while Jimmy seemed to be thinking his own private thoughts. They had gone some distance before either spoke.  \"Who is she, Jimmy?\" asked Mifflin.  Jimmy came out of his thoughts with a start.  \"What's that?\"  \"Who is she?\"  \"I don't know what you mean.\"  \"Yes, you do! The sea air. Who is she?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Jimmy, simply.  \"You don't know? Well, what's her name?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"Doesn't the Lusitania still print a passenger-list?\"  \"She does.\"  \"And you couldn't find out her name in five days?\"  \"No.\"  \"And that's the man who thinks he can burgle a house!\" said Mifflin, despairingly.  They had arrived now at the building on the second floor of which was Jimmy's flat.  \"Coming in?\" said Jimmy.  \"Well, I was rather thinking of pushing on as far as the Park. I tell you, I feel all on wires.\"  \"Come in, and smoke a cigar. You've got all night before you if you want to do Marathons. I haven't seen you for a couple of months. I want you to tell me all the news.\"  \"There isn't any. Nothing happens in New York. The papers say things do, but they don't. However, I'll come in. It seems to me that you're the man with the news.\"  Jimmy fumbled with his latch-key.  \"You're a bright sort of burglar,\" said Mifflin, disparagingly. \"Why don't you use your oxy-acetylene blow-pipe? Do you realize, my boy, that you've let yourself in for buying a dinner for twelve hungry men next week? In the cold light of the morning, when reason returns to her throne, that'll come home to you.\"  \"I haven't done anything of the sort,\" said Jimmy, unlocking the door.  \"Don't tell me you really mean to try it.\"  \"What else did you think I was going to do?\"  \"But you can't. You would get caught for a certainty. And what are you going to do then? Say it was all a joke? Suppose they fill you full of bullet-holes! Nice sort of fool you'll look, appealing to some outraged householder's sense of humor, while he pumps you full of lead with a Colt.\"  \"These are the risks of the profession. You ought to know that, Arthur. Think what you went through tonight.\"  Arthur Mifflin looked at his friend with some uneasiness. He knew how very reckless Jimmy could be when he had set his mind on accomplishing anything, since, under the stimulus of a challenge, he ceased to be a reasoning being, amenable to argument. And, in the present case, he knew that Willett's words had driven the challenge home. Jimmy was not the man to sit still under the charge of being a fakir, no matter whether his accuser had been sober or drunk.  Jimmy, meanwhile, had produced whiskey and cigars. Now, he was lying on his back on the lounge, blowing smoke-rings at the ceiling.  \"Well?\" said Arthur Mifflin, at length.  \"Well, what?\"  \"What I meant was, is this silence to be permanent, or are you going to begin shortly to amuse, elevate, and instruct? Something's happened to you, Jimmy. There was a time when you were a bright little chap, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. Where be your gibes now; your gambols, your songs, your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table in a roar when you were paying for the dinner? You remind me more of a deaf-mute celebrating the Fourth of July with noiseless powder than anything else on earth. Wake up, or I shall go. Jimmy, we were practically boys together. Tell me about this girl--the girl you loved, and were idiot enough to lose.\"  Jimmy drew a deep breath.  \"Very well,\" said Mifflin complacently, \"sigh if you like; it's better than nothing.\"  Jimmy sat up.  \"Yes, dozens of times,\" said Mifflin.  \"What do you mean?\"  \"You were just going to ask me if I had ever been in love, weren't you?\"  \"I wasn't, because I know you haven't. You have no soul. You don't know what love is.\"  \"Have it your own way,\" said Mifflin, resignedly.  Jimmy bumped back on the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4075"],["title","The Intrusion of Jimmy (#2)"],["body","sofa.  \"I don't either,\" he said. \"That's the trouble.\"  Mifflin looked interested.  \"I know,\" he said. \"You've got that strange premonitory fluttering, when the heart seems to thrill within you like some baby bird singing its first song, when--\"  \"Oh, cut it out!\"  \"--when you ask yourself timidly, 'Is it? Can it really be?' and answer shyly, 'No. Yes. I believe it is!' I've been through it dozens of times; it is a recognized early symptom. Unless prompt measures are taken, it will develop into something acute. In these matters, stand on your Uncle Arthur. He knows.\"  \"You make me sick,\" Jimmy retorted.  \"You have our ear,\" said Mifflin, kindly. \"Tell me all.\"  \"There's nothing to tell.\"  \"Don't lie, James.\"  \"Well, practically nothing.\"  \"That's better.\"  \"It was like this.\"  \"Good.\"  Jimmy wriggled himself into a more comfortable position, and took a sip from his glass.  \"I didn't see her until the second day out.\"  \"I know that second day out. Well?\"  \"We didn't really meet at all.\"  \"Just happened to be going to the same spot, eh?\"  \"As a matter of fact, it was like this. Like a fool, I'd bought a second-class ticket.\"  \"What? Our young Rockerbilt Astergould, the boy millionaire, traveling second-class! Why?\"  \"I had an idea it would be better fun. Everybody's so much more cheery in the second cabin. You get to know people so much quicker. Nine trips out of ten, I'd much rather go second.\"  \"And this was the tenth?\"  \"She was in the first-cabin,\" said Jimmy.  Mifflin clutched his forehead.  \"Wait!\" he cried. \"This reminds me of something--something in Shakespeare. Romeo and Juliet? No. I've got it--Pyramus and Thisbe.\"  \"I don't see the slightest resemblance.\"  \"Read your 'Midsummer Night's Dream.' 'Pyramus and Thisbe,' says the story, 'did talk through the chink of a wall,'\" quoted Mifflin.  \"We didn't.\"  \"Don't be so literal. You talked across a railing.\"  \"We didn't.\"  \"Do you mean to say you didn't talk at all?\"  \"We didn't say a single word.\"  Mifflin shook his head sadly.  \"I give you up,\" he said. \"I thought you were a man of enterprise. What did you do?\"  Jimmy sighed softly.  \"I used to stand and smoke against the railing opposite the barber's shop, and she used to walk round the deck.\"  \"And you used to stare at her?\"  \"I would look in her direction sometimes,\" corrected Jimmy, with dignity.  \"Don't quibble! You stared at her. You behaved like a common rubber-neck, and you know it. I am no prude, James, but I feel compelled to say that I consider your conduct that of a libertine. Used she to walk alone?\"  \"Generally.\"  \"And, now, you love her, eh? You went on board that ship happy, careless, heart-free. You came off it grave and saddened. Thenceforth, for you, the world could contain but one woman, and her you had lost.\"  Mifflin groaned in a hollow and bereaved manner, and took a sip from his glass to buoy him up.  Jimmy moved restlessly on the sofa.  \"Do you believe in love at first sight?\" he asked, fatuously. He was in the mood when a man says things, the memory of which makes him wake up hot all over for nights to come.  \"I don't see what first sight's got to do with it,\" said Mifflin. \"According to your own statement, you stood and glared at the girl for five days without letting up for a moment. I can quite imagine that you might glare yourself into love with anyone by the end of that time.\"  \"I can't see myself settling down,\" said Jimmy, thoughtfully. \"And, until you feel that you want to settle down, I suppose you can't be really in love.\"  \"I was saying practically that about you at the club just before you came in. My somewhat neat expression was that you were one of the gypsies of the world.\"  \"By George, you're quite right!\"  \"I always am.\"  \"I suppose it's having nothing to do. When I was on the News, I was never like this.\"  \"You weren't on the News long enough to get tired of it.\"  \"I feel now I can't stay in a place more than a week. It's having this money that does it, I suppose.\"  \"New York,\" said Mifflin, \"is full of obliging persons who will be delighted to relieve you of the incubus. Well, James, I shall leave you. I feel more like bed now. By the way, I suppose you lost sight of this girl when you landed?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, there aren't so many girls in the United States--only twenty million. Or is it forty million? Something small. All you've got to do is to search around a bit. Good-night.\"  \"Good-night.\"  Mr. Mifflin clattered down the stairs. A minute later, the sound of his name being called loudly from the street brought Jimmy to the window. Mifflin was standing on the pavement below, looking up.  \"Jimmy.\"  \"What's the matter now?\"  \"I forgot to ask. Was she a blonde?\"  \"What?\"  \"Was she a blonde?\" yelled Mifflin.  \"No,\" snapped Jimmy.  \"Dark, eh?\" bawled Mifflin, making night hideous.  \"Yes,\" said Jimmy, shutting the window.  \"Jimmy!\"  The window went up again.  \"Well?\"  \"Me for blondes!\"  \"Go to bed!\"  \"Very well. Good-night.\"  \"Good-night.\"  Jimmy withdrew his head, and sat down in the chair Mifflin had vacated. A moment later, he rose, and switched off the light. It was pleasanter to sit and think in the dark. His thoughts wandered off in many channels, but always came back to the girl on the Lusitania. It was absurd, of course. He didn't wonder that Arthur Mifflin had treated the thing as a joke. Good old Arthur! Glad he had made a success! But was it a joke? Who was it that said, the point of a joke is like the point of a needle, so small that it is apt to disappear entirely when directed straight at oneself? If anybody else had told him such a limping romance, he would have laughed himself. Only, when you are the center of a romance, however limping, you see it from a different angle. Of course, told badly, it was absurd. He could see that. But something away at the back of his mind told him that it was not altogether absurd. And yet--love didn't come like that, in a flash. You might just as well expect a house to spring into being in a moment, or a ship, or an automobile, or a table, or a--He sat up with a jerk. In another instant, he would have been asleep.  He thought of bed, but bed seemed a long way off--the deuce of a way. Acres of carpet to be crawled over, and then the dickens of a climb at the end of it. Besides, undressing! Nuisance--undressing. That was a nice dress the girl had worn on the fourth day out. Tailor-made. He liked tailor-mades. He liked all her dresses. He liked her. Had she liked him? So hard to tell if you don't get a chance of speaking! She was dark. Arthur liked blondes, Arthur was a fool! Good old Arthur! Glad he had made a success! Now, he could marry if he liked! If he wasn't so restless, if he didn't feel that he couldn't stop more than a day in any place! But would the girl have him? If they had never spoken, it made it so hard to--  At this point, Jimmy went to sleep.     CHAPTER III  MR. McEACHERN   At about the time when Jimmy's meditations finally merged themselves in dreams, a certain Mr. John McEachern, Captain of Police, was seated in the parlor of his up-town villa, reading. He was a man built on a large scale. Everything about him was large--his hands, his feet, his shoulders, his chest, and particularly his jaw, which even in his moments of calm was aggressive, and which stood out, when anything happened to ruffle him, like the ram of a battle-ship. In his patrolman days, which had been passed mainly on the East side, this jaw of his had acquired a reputation from Park Row to Fourteenth Street. No gang-fight, however absorbing, could retain the undivided attention of the young blood of the Bowery when Mr. McEachern's jaw hove in sight with the rest of his massive person in close attendance. He was a man who knew no fear, and he had gone through disorderly mobs like an east wind.  But there was another side to his character. In fact, that other side was so large that the rest of him, his readiness in combat and his zeal in breaking up public disturbances, might be said to have been only an off-shoot. For his ambition was as large as his fist and as aggressive as his jaw. He had entered the force with the single idea of becoming rich, and had set about achieving his object with a strenuous vigor that was as irresistible as his mighty locust-stick. Some policemen are born grafters, some achieve graft, and some have graft thrust upon them. Mr. McEachern had begun by being the first, had risen to the second, and for some years now had been a prominent member of the small and hugely prosperous third class, the class that does not go out seeking graft, but sits at home and lets graft come to it.  In his search for wealth, he had been content to abide his time. He did not want the trifling sum that every New York policeman acquires. His object was something bigger, and he was prepared to wait for it. He knew that small beginnings were an annoying but unavoidable preliminary to all great fortunes. Probably, Captain Kidd had started in a small way. Certainly, Mr. Rockefeller had. He was content to follow in the footsteps of the masters.  A patrolman's opportunities of amassing wealth are not great. Mr. McEachern had made the best of a bad job. He had not disdained the dollars that came as single spies rather than in battalions. Until the time should arrive when he might angle for whales, he was prepared to catch sprats.  Much may be done, even on a small scale, by perseverance. In those early days, Mr. McEachern's observant eye had not failed to notice certain peddlers who obstructed the traffic, divers tradesmen who did the same by the side-walk, and of restaurant keepers not a few with a distaste for closing at one o'clock in the morning. His researches in this field were not unprofitable. In a reasonably short space of time, he had put by the three thousand dollars that were the price of his promotion to detective-sergeant. He did not like paying three thousand dollars for promotion, but there must be sinking of capital if "]]]
