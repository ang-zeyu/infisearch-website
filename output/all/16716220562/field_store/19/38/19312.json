First came the geese, looking very indignant, and the goslings. Then came Kit with the leaves all whipped off his willow switches. Then came Kat with her pail; and, last of all, Vrouw Vedder and the milk!  When the new family of geese had been taken care of, and the fresh milk had been put away to cool, Vrouw Vedder got out her churn and scalded it well. Then she put in her cream, and put the cover down over the handle of the dasher.  \"Now, Kit and Kat, you may take turns,\" she said, \"and see which one of you can bring the butter, but be sure you work the dasher very evenly or the butter will not be good.\"  \"Me first!\" said Kat, and she began. Kit sat on a little stool and watched for the butter.  Kat worked the dasher up and down, up and down. The cream splashed and splashed inside the churn, and a little white ring of spatters came up around the dasher. Kat worked until her arms ached.  \"Now it's my turn,\" said Kit. Then he poked the dasher, and the cream splashed and splashed for quite a long time; but still the butter did not come.  \"Ho!\" said Kat. \"You're nothing but a boy. Of course you don't know how to churn. Let me try.\" And she took her turn.  Dash! Splash! Splash, dash! She worked away; and very soon, around the dasher, there was a ring of little specks of butter.      \"Come, butter, come! Come, butter, come!      Some for a honey cake, and some for a bun,\"  she sang in time to the dasher; and truly, when Vrouw Vedder opened the churn, there was a large cake of yellow butter!  Vrouw Vedder took out the butter and worked it into a nice roll. Then she gave each of the Twins a cup of buttermilk to drink.  While the Twins drank the buttermilk, their mother washed the churn and put it away. When she was all through, it was still quite early in the morning, because they had gotten up with the sun.  \"Now we must clean the house,\" she said.  So she got out her scrubbing-brushes, and mops, and pails, and dusters, and began.  First she shook out the pillows of the best bed, that nobody ever slept in, and pushed back the curtains so that the embroidered coverlet could be seen. Then she put the other beds in order and drew the curtains in front of them.  She dusted the linen press and left it open just a little, so that her beautiful rolls of white linen, tied with ribbons, would show. Kat dusted the chairs, and Kit carried the big brass jugs outside the kitchen door to be polished.  Then they all three rubbed and scoured and polished them until they shone like the sun.  \"Now it is time to cook the dinner,\" said Vrouw Vedder. \"We will have pork and potatoes and some cabbage. Kit, run to the garden and bring a cabbage; and Kat, you may get the fire ready to cook it, when Kit brings it in.\"  Kat went to the stove--but it was such a funny stove! It wasn't a stove at all, really.  There was a sort of table built up against the chimney. It was all covered with pretty blue tiles, with pictures of boats on them. Over this table, there was a shelf, like a mantel shelf. There were plates on it, and from the bottom of the shelf hung some chains with hooks on them. The coals were right out on the little table.  Kat took the bellows and--puff, puff, puff!--made the coals burn brighter. She peeped in the kettle to see that there was water in it. Then she put some more charcoal on the fire.  Kit brought in the cabbage, and Vrouw Vedder cut it up and put it into the pot of water hanging over the fire. She put the pork and potatoes in too.  In a little while the pot was bubbling away merrily; and Father Vedder, who was in the garden, sniffed the air and said,  \"I know what we are going to have for dinner.\"  While the pot boiled, Vrouw Vedder scrubbed the floor and wiped the window.  Then she took her brooms and scrubbing-brush outside.  She scrubbed the door and the outside of the house. She scrubbed the little pig with soap. The little pig squealed, because she got some soap in its eyes. She scrubbed the steps--and even the trunk of the poplar tree in the yard! She scrubbed everything in sight, except Father Vedder and the Twins! By and by she came to the door and called,  \"Come to dinner! Only be sure to leave your wooden shoes outside, when you come into my clean kitchen.\"  Here are the shoes, just as they left them, all in a row. And as it was Saturday, the shoes were scrubbed too, that night.  When the dinner was cleared away, Vrouw Vedder said to the Twins,  \"It is almost time for Grandmother to come. Let's walk out to meet her.\"  They walked clear to the edge of the town before they saw her coming. They walked on top of the dyke, so they could look right down into the street, and see all the houses in a row. Grandmother was coming up the street with a basket on her arm.  \"What do you think is in that basket?\" Vrouw Vedder asked the Twins.  \"Honey cake!\" said Kit; and Kat said, \"Candy!\"  And Kit and Kat were both right. There was a large honey cake and anise candies, and some currant buns besides!  Grandmother let them peep in and see. They were very polite and did not ask for any--Vrouw Vedder was proud of the Twins' good manners. Grandmother said,  \"This afternoon, when we have tea, you shall have some.\"  \"I'm glad I ate such a lot of dinner,\" said Kit to Kat, as they walked along; \"or else I'd just have to have a bun this minute!\"  \"Yes,\" said Kat, \"it's much easier to be polite when you aren't hungry.\"  When they got home, Kit and Kat took their Grandmother to see the new goslings, and to see the ducklings too. And Vrouw Vedder showed her the butter that Kit and Kat had helped to churn; and Grandmother said,  \"My, my! What helpers they are getting to be!\" Then she said, \"How clean the house is!\" and then, \"How the brasses shine!\"  \"Yes,\" said Vrouw Vedder; \"the Twins helped me make everything clean and tidy to show to you.\"  \"I guess it's time for honey cake,\" said Grandmother.  Then Vrouw Vedder stirred up the fire again and boiled the kettle and made tea. She took down her best china cups and put them out on the round table.  Then Grandmother opened her basket and took out the honey cake and buns and the candy; and Vrouw Vedder brought out her fresh butter.  \"I can't stay polite much longer,\" said Kit to Kat.  Grandmother gave them each a thin slice of honey cake and a bun; and Vrouw Vedder spread some of the butter on the buns--and oh, how good they were!      \"Some for a honey cake,      And some for a bun,\"  sang Kat. It didn't take the Twins long to finish them.  When they had drunk their tea, Grandmother brought out her knitting, and Mother Vedder began to spin.  \"How many rolls of linen have you ready for Kat when she marries?\" Grandmother asked.  \"I try to make at least one roll each year; so she has four now and I am working on the fifth one,\" said Vrouw Vedder. \"She shall be as well-to-do as any farmer's daughter near here, when she marries. See, this is the last one,\" and Vrouw Vedder took from the press a roll of beautiful white linen tied with blue ribbons.  \"Is that for me, Mother?\" asked Kat.  \"Yes,\" said Vrouw Vedder. \"When you marry, we shall have a fine press full of linen for you.\"  \"Isn't Kit going to have some too?\" asked Kat.  Grandmother laughed.  \"The mother of the little girl who will some day marry Kit, is working now on her linen, no doubt; so Kit won't need any of yours.\"  The Twins looked very solemn and went out into the yard. They sat down on the bench by the kitchen door together. Then Kat said,  \"Kit, do you suppose we've got to be married?\"  \"It looks like it,\" said Kit.  Things seemed very dark indeed to the Twins.  \"Well,\" said Kat, \"I just tell you I'm not going to do it. I'm going to stay at home with Mother and Father, and you and the ducks and everything!\"  \"What will they do with the linen then?\" said Kit. \"I guess you'll have to be married.\"  Kat began to cry.  \"I'll just go and ask Mother,\" she said.  \"I'll go with you,\" said Kit. \"I don't want to any more than you do.\"  So the Twins got down from the bench and went into the kitchen where Grandmother and Vrouw Vedder were.  Their mother was spinning flax to make linen thread.  \"Mother,\" said the Twins, \"will you please excuse us from being married.\"  \"O my soul!\" said Vrouw Vedder. She seemed surprised.  \"We don't want to at all,\" said Kat. \"We'd rather stay with you.\"  \"You shan't be married until after you are four feet and a half high and are called Christopher and Katrina anyway,\" said Vrouw Vedder. \"I promise you that.\"  The Twins were much relieved. They went out and fed their ducklings. They felt so much better that they gave them an extra handful of grain, and they carried a bun to Father Vedder, who was hoeing in the farthest corner of the garden. He ate it, leaning on his hoe.  When they went back to the house, it was late in the afternoon. Grandmother was rolling up her knitting.  \"I must go home to Grandfather;\" she said. \"He'll be wanting his supper.\"  The Twins walked down the road as far as the first bridge with Grandmother. There she kissed them good-bye and sent them home.  When their mother put them to bed that night, Kat said,  \"Has this been a short day, Mother?\"  \"Oh, very short!\" said Vrouw Vedder, \"because you helped me so much.\"  Then she kissed them good-night and went out to feed the pigs, and shut up the chickens for the night.  When she was gone, Kit said,  \"I don't see how they got along before we came. We help so much!\"  \"No,\" said Kat; \"I don't think--\" But what she didn't think, no one will ever know, because just then she popped off to sleep.     IV  ONE SUNDAY   One Sunday morning in early fall, Kit and Kat woke up and peeped out from their cupboard bed to see what was going on in the world.  The sun was shining through the little panes of the kitchen window, making square patches of light on the floor. The kettle was singing on the fire, and Vrouw Vedder was already putting away the breakfast things.  Father Vedder was lighting his pipe"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4012"],["title","The Dutch Twins (#4)"],["body","a coal from the fire. He had on his black Sunday clothes, all ready for church. Father Vedder did not look at Kit and Kat at all. He just puffed away at his pipe and said to himself,  \"If there are any Twins anywhere that want to go to church with me, they'd better get dressed and eat their breakfasts.\"  Kit and Kat tumbled out of the cupboard at once.  Vrouw Vedder came to help them dress.  I can't tell you how many petticoats she put on Kat, but it was ever so many. And over them all she put a skirt of plaid. There was a waist of a different color, and over that a kerchief with bright red roses on it. And over the skirt she put a new, clean apron.  Kit was dressed very splendidly too. He had full baggy trousers of velveteen that reached to his ankles, and a jacket that buttoned with big silver buttons. His trousers had pockets in them.  Kit and Kat both wore stockings, which Vrouw Vedder had knit, and their best shoes of stout leather.  When they were all dressed, Vrouw Vedder stood them up side by side and had them turn around slowly to be sure they were all right.  \"Now see that you behave well in meeting,\" she said. \"Sit up straight. Look at the Dominie, and do not whisper.\"  \"Yes, Mother,\" said Kit and Kat.  Then she tied a big apron over each of them and gave them each a bowl of bread and milk. While they were eating it, Father Vedder went out and looked at the pigs, and chickens, and ducks, and geese, and smoked his pipe.  When he came in, Kit and Kat were quite ready. Vrouw Vedder had tied on Kat's little white-winged cap, and put Kit's hat on. She kissed them good-bye, and they were off, one on each side of Father Vedder, holding tight to his hands.  Mother Vedder looked after them proudly, from the doorway. She did not go to church that day.  They walked slowly along the roadway in the bright sunshine. Many of their neighbors and friends, all dressed in their best, were walking to church, too.  Father Vedder and Kit and Kat went a little out of their way, in order to pass a large windmill that was swinging its arms around and creaking out a kind of sleepy windmill song. This is the song it seemed to sing:      Around, and around, and around, I go,     Sometimes fast and sometimes slow.     I pump the water and grind the grain,     The marshy fields of the Lowlands, drain.     I harness the wind to turn my mill,     Around, and around, and around with a will!  Perhaps it was listening to the windmill song that made Kat say,  \"Why do we have windmills, father?\"  Kit and Kat said \"Why?\" every few steps on that walk. You see, they didn't often have their father all to themselves, to ask questions of.  \"Why, what a little Dutch girl,\" said Father Vedder, \"not to know what windmills are for! They pump the water out of the fields, to be sure! Don't you know how wet the fields are sometimes? If we didn't keep pumping the water out, they would be so wet we could not make gardens at all.\"  \"Does the wind pump the water?\" asked Kat.  \"Of course it does, goosie girl! and grinds the grain too. The wind blows against the great arms and turns them round and round. That works the pumps; and the pumps suck the water out of the fields, and it is poured out into the canals. If it weren't for the good old windmills working away, who knows but the water would get the best of us some day and cover up all our land!\"  \"Wouldn't the dykes keep out the sea?\" asked Kit.  \"Suppose the dykes should break!\" said Father Vedder. \"Even one little break can let in lots of water. The dykes have to be watched day and night all the time, and the least bit of a hole stopped up right away, so it can't grow any bigger and let in the sea.\"  \"Oh dear,\" Kat said, \"what a leaky country!\"  She ran near the mill and let the wind from the fans blow her hair and the white wings on her cap.  As the great fans swung near the ground, Kit jumped up and caught hold of one. It lifted him right off the ground as it swung around, and in a minute he was dangling high in the air.  \"Jump, jump, quick,\" shouted Father Vedder.  Kit let go and dropped to the ground just in time. In another minute he would have been carried clear over.  As it was, he sat down very hard on the ground, and had to have the dirt brushed off of his Sunday clothes.  \"I am surprised at you,\" Father Vedder said, while he brushed him. \"You are too small to swing on windmills, and besides it is the Sabbath day. Don't you ever do it again until you are big enough to be called Christopher!\"  Sitting down so hard in the dirt had hurt Kit a little bit, and scared him a good deal, so he said, \"No, father.\"  Then they walked all around the mill. They peeped inside a door which was open, and saw the pumps working away.  \"Yes,\" said Father Vedder, \"it is nip and tuck between wind and water in Holland. Let us sit down here on the canal bank, in the sunshine, and I will tell you what hard work has to be done to keep this good land of ours. And it is a good land! We should be thankful for it! Just see the rich green meadows over there, with the cows grazing in them!\" Father Vedder pointed to the beautiful fields across the canal. \"The grass is so rich and fresh, that the cows here give more milk than any other cows in the whole world!\"  \"That's what Mother says,\" said Kat.  \"The Holland butter and cheese are famous everywhere,\" went on Father Vedder; \"and we have all the good milk we want to drink, besides. The Dutch gardens, too, are the finest in the world.\"  \"And ours is one of the best of Dutch gardens, isn't it, Father?\" said Kit.  \"It's a very good garden,\" said Father Vedder, proudly. \"No one can raise better onions and cabbage and carrots than I can. And the Dutch bulbs! Our tulips and hyacinths make the whole world bloom!\"  \"Holland is really the greatest country there is; isn't it?\" said Kit.  \"Well, not in point of size, perhaps,\" Father Vedder admitted; \"but in pluck, my boy, it is! Did you know that sometimes people call Holland the Land of Pluck?\"  \"I don't see why,\" said Kat. \"I'm Dutch, but I'm afraid of lots of things! I'm afraid of spiders and of cross geese, and of falling into the water!\"  \"You're a girl, if you are Dutch,\" said Kit. \"Boys are always pluckier than girls; aren't they, Father?\"  \"Really plucky people never boast,\" said Father Vedder.  Kit looked the other way and dug the toe of his shoe into the dirt. Kat snuggled up to her Father and sniffed at Kit.  \"So there, Kit!\" was all she said.  \"There's pluck enough to go round,\" said Father Vedder mildly, \"and we all need it boys and girls, and men and women too. It was pluck that made Holland, and it's pluck that keeps her from slipping back into the sea.\"  \"How did pluck make Holland?\" asked Kit.  \"There wasn't any Holland in the first place,\" Father Vedder answered. \"There were only some marshes and some lands under water. But people built a wall of earth around these flats; and then they pumped out the water from the space inside the wall, and made canals through the land, and drained it. And after all that work, we have our rich fields.\"  \"How does pluck keep them?\" asked Kat.  \"The dykes have to be watched and mended all the time,\" said Father Vedder. \"And the windmills have to work and work, to keep the fields drained. No one can be lazy in Holland. Each one has to work well for what he gets. If Holland should grow lazy, she would soon be back again in the Zuyder Zee! So, my children, you see you must learn well and work hard. And that is all my sermon to-day.\"  \"It is a better sermon than the Dominie will preach, I know,\" said Kat.  \"Tut, tut! You must never say such things,\" said Father Vedder. He got up and held out his hands to the Twins.  \"Come! we must walk along, or we shall be late for church,\" he said. \"Here comes the Dominie now.\"  There indeed was the Dominie! Kit and Kat knew him well. No one else dressed as he did. He wore a high silk hat, and long, black coat and trousers, such as city people wear.  As he came along the road, all the people bowed respectfully; the little boys took off their caps, and the little girls bobbed a courtesy. Kit and Kat bobbed and courtesied too, and the Dominie smiled at them and laid his hand on Kit's head.  \"I wish he'd come to see us again,\" said Kit, after the Dominie had passed by.  Father Vedder was pleased.  \"I am glad to see that you love your pastor, my son,\" he said.  \"Well,\" said Kit, \"I don't really like him so very much, because we have to be washed, and recite the catechism, and mind all our manners when he comes. But Mother always has such good things to eat when the Dominie comes--doesn't she, Kat?--cake and preserves and everything!\"  \"If it weren't for the catechism and such things, it would be something like St. Nicholas day!\" sighed Kat. \"But the Dominie never forgets! And last time I couldn't tell what saving grace was! The cakes are good, but...\"  \"Good Dutch boys and girls always learn their catechism well,\" said Father Vedder; \"then they are glad to see the good Dominie as well as the cakes. Now no more chatter! Here is a penny for each of you to put in the bag when it is passed.\"  He gave them each a penny. Kit put his in his pocket. Kat didn't have a pocket, so she held hers tight in her hand.  At the church door they met Grandfather and Grandmother.  Grandfather looked very fine indeed, in his black clothes; and Grandmother was all dressed up in her best black dress, with a fresh white cap, and a shawl over her shoulders. She carried a large psalm book with golden clasps in one hand, and a scent bottle in the other. She had some peppermints too. Kit and Kat smelled them.  They all went into the church together, and an old woman led them to their seats. Kit and Kat sat one on each side of Grandmother. Grandfather and Father Vedder sat on the other side of the church with all the rest of the men.  \"You must sit very still and look straight before you,\" said Grandmother.  Kit remembered the peppermints and sat up like a soldier. So did Kat."]]]
