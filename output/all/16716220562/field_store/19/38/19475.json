We are about to begin transportation of our population to the new world. For the first time since our ancestors became aware of the awful presence of man on the Earth, we feel that we can look forward to security._  Markham Gray remained quiet for a long time. \"I am still amazed that you were able to develop so far without our knowledge,\" he said finally.  There was an edge of amusement in the answering thought. _We are very tiny, Mr. Gray. And our greatest efforts have always been to keep from under man's eyes. We have profited greatly, however, by our suitability to espionage; little goes on in the human world of which we don't know. Our progress was greatly aided by our being able to utilize the science that man has already developed. You've noted, for instance, how similar our space ships are to your own._  Gray nodded to himself. \"But I'm also impressed by the manner in which you have developed some mechanical device to duplicate human speech. That involved original research.\"  _At any rate, neither man nor we need dread the future any longer. We have escaped the danger that overhung us, and you know now that we are no alien enemies from space threatening you. We wish you well, mankind; perhaps the future will see changes in your nature. It is in this friendly hope that we have contacted humanity through you, Mr. Gray._  The elderly journalist said quietly, \"I appreciate your thoughtfulness and hope you are correct. Good luck to you in your new world.\"  _Thank you, Markham Gray, and goodbye._  The set was suddenly quiet again.         *       *       *       *       *  Markham Gray stood before the assembled Military Council of the Solar System. He had told his story without interruption to this most powerful body on Earth. They listened to him in silence.  When he had finished, he waited for their questions. The first came from SupSpaceCom Michell. He said, thoughtfully, \"You believe their words to be substantially correct, Gray?\"  \"I believe them to be entirely truthful, your excellency,\" the journalist told him sincerely.  \"Then they are on the verge of leaving the Earth and removing to this other planet in some other star system?\"  \"That is their plan.\"  The SupSpaceCom mused aloud. \"We'll be able to locate them when they blast off en masse. Their single ships are so small that they missed being observed, but a mass flight we'll be able to detect. Our cruisers will be able to follow them all the way, blasting them as they go. If any get through to their new planet, we'll at least know where they are and can take our time destroying it.\"  The President of the Council added thoughtfully, \"Quite correct, Michell. And in the early stages of the fight, we should be able to capture some of their ships intact. As soon as we find what kind of insect they are, our bacteriologists will be able to work on a method to eliminate any that might remain on Earth.\"  Markham Gray's face had paled in horror. \"But why?\" he blurted. \"Why not let them go in peace? All they've wanted for centuries is to escape us, to have a planet of their own.\"  SupSpaceCom Michell eyed him tolerantly. \"You seem to have been taken in, Mr. Gray. Once they've established themselves in their new world, we have no idea of how rapidly they might develop and how soon they might become a threat. Even though they may be peaceful today, they are potential enemies tomorrow. And a potential enemy _is_ an enemy, who must be destroyed.\"  Gray felt sickness well through him \"But ... but this policy.... What happens when man finally finds on his borders a life form more advanced than he--an intelligence strong enough to destroy rather than be destroyed?\"  The tolerance was gone now. The SupSpaceCom said coldly, \"Don't be a pessimistic defeatist, Gray.\"  He turned to the admirals and generals of his staff. \"Make all preparations for the attack, gentlemen.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40961"],["title","Luna Escapade (#0)"],["body","Escapade                              _by H.

He drummed absently with the fingers of his right hand upon the buckle of the seat strap which restrained him from floating out of the padded acceleration seat.  \"Let's see, tail's right out there in front. I got the angle perfect. Guess everything's okay.\"  He noticed his fingers drumming, and stopped.  \"Cut that out!\" he told himself. \"Get nervous now and Jack'll be sending some other vacuum on the next Mars run. There's Ericsson dead center in the screen, waiting for you to plop down beside the domes. You couldn't miss a crater that size if you tried.\"  He leaned back and stared speculatively at the curving tip of the Lunar Rockies that ended in one of the largest craters on the far side of Luna. His eyes squinted slightly and there was a crease between them, as if he spent much time peering into instruments. There were deeper lines beside his mouth, but the thin lips and pointed chin neutralized that evidence of frequent smiling.  \"Are we nearly there?\"  Dudley's brown eyes opened so wide that the whites gleamed in the dim light from his instruments. Then he shut them tightly and shook his head quickly.  He had thought he heard a woman's voice, and of course he couldn't have. Freight rockets were checked out of Terran spaceports with only a pilot aboard. A lonely job for a man, but it was really only a way of keeping in practice. He made six round trips to Luna a year, but the big one was the three-month kick to Mars.  Then he smelled the perfume, so out of place in the machine-crowded compartment. He turned around slowly.  She stood with one hand gripping the lead of a computing machine to keep her feet on the deck. Dudley stared her up and down two or three times before he realized his mouth hung open.  Slim and about five-feet-four, she looked like a nice little girl making her first disastrous experiments with adult make-up. The slack suit of deep blue, revealing a soft white blouse at the neck of the jacket, was in the best of taste, but her heavy application of lipstick was crude.  _And her hair isn't naturally ash-blonde_, Dudley thought. _Yet she looks like such a kid. Not pretty, but she might be in a few years._  \"What are you doing here?\" he demanded harshly.  For a second, her eyes were scared. Then the expression was supplanted by a hard, make-believe confidence, leaving him merely with a fading sense of shame at his tone.  \"Same as you,\" she said boldly. \"Going to Luna.\"  Dudley snorted. \"Then relax,\" he growled, \"because I can't stop you now. Where the devil did you spend the last thirty-six hours?\"  She tried a grin. \"In the little room where the things are that pump the air. I sneaked in the galley once, when you were asleep. Did you miss anything?\"  \"No,\" he admitted, thinking back.  \"See? I'm not enough trouble to be noticed!\"  Dudley eyed her sourly. There was trouble behind this somewhere, he was willing to bet, or else why had she stowed away? Running from a family fight? When the port checkers at Ericsson saw her--!  \"How old are you, kid?\" he asked.  \"Twenty-one.\"  The answer was too pat and quickly given. Even the girl seemed to realize that, and she continued talking. \"My name's Kathi Foster. You're the next Mars pilot, according to the schedule, aren't you?\"  \"What about it?\"  She let go of the cable and pushed her weightless body across the control room to his chair.  \"What's it like on Mars?\" she asked breathlessly.  _What does she expect me to tell her?_ Dudley wondered cynically. _That the whole population of the colony is only about four thousand? That they still live mostly on hope, dreams, and regular rocket service? That every one of them represents such a fantastic transportation expense that the Commission only sends top-notch people?_  \"It's pretty tough,\" he said.  She hesitated over his unhelpful reply, then plunged ahead.  \"How about taking me along to see for myself?\"  Dudley smiled with one corner of his mouth.  \"You're not going anywhere except back to Terra on the next rocket,\" he predicted flatly. \"And I hope your father still has enough hair on his head to own a hair-brush!\"  \"My father is dead.\"  \"Then your--.\" He paused as she shook her head. \"Well, don't you have any family? Jobs on Luna are ... limited. The settlements just aren't very big. You're better off down home.\"  Kathi's half-defiant, half-wheedling mask cracked. Her over-painted lips twitched.  \"What do you know about where I'm better off? If you knew the kind of family I have--.\"  \"Oh, calm down!\" grunted Dudley, somewhat discomforted by the sight of tears spilling from her blue eyes. \"Things are never as bad as you think when you're just a ... when you're young. When we land, we can say you got left aboard by mistake. They'll just send you back without any trouble.\"  \"Like hell they will! I won't go!\"  Dudley stared hard at her, until she dropped her gaze.  \"You don't understand,\" she said more quietly. \"I ... my family has been kicking me around the law courts all my life just because my grandfather left me his money. They're all trying to get their hands on it, or on me to back up their claims. Do you realize I'm eight--I'm twenty-one and I never lived a happy day in my life? I'd rather _die_ than go back!\"  \"Yeah, sure,\" said Dudley. \"What did you really do to make you so scared of going back? Smack up grandpop's helicopter, maybe, or flunk out of school?\"  \"No, I got sick and tired of being shoved around. I wanted to get away someplace where I could be myself.\"  \"Why didn't you buy a ticket on a passenger rocket, if you had such an urge to visit Luna?\"  \"My aunts and uncles and cousins have all my money tied up in suits.\"  He leaned back by pushing the edge of the control desk.  \"Pretty fast with the answers, aren't you?\" he grinned. \"I wonder what you'll think up for the spaceport police when _they_ ask you?\"  \"You don't believe--,\" she began.  He shook his head and to avoid further argument he picked up his sliderule, muttering something about checking his landing curve. Actually, he was not as convinced as he pretended that her story was all lies.  _But what the hell?_ he thought. _I have my own troubles without worrying because some blonde little spiral thinks she can go dramatic over a family spat. She'd better learn that life is full of give and take._  \"You better get attached to something around here,\" he warned her when the time came for serious deceleration.  \"I ... I could go back where I was,\" she stammered. He suddenly realized that for the past hour she had silently accepted his ignoring her. She asked now, \"What happens next?\"  \"We cut our speed and come down on the tail as near to the domes of the Ericsson settlement as possible without taking too much of a chance. Then I secure everything for the towing.\"  \"Towing? I'm sorry; I never read much about the moon rockets.\"  \"Natural enough,\" Dudley retorted dryly. \"Anyway, they send out big cranes to lower the rocket to horizontal so they can tow it on wheels under one of the loading domes. Handling cargo goes a lot faster and safer that way. Most of the town itself is underground.\"  He began warming up his tele-screen prior to asking the spaceport for observation of his approach. Kathi grabbed his elbow.  \"Of course I'm going to talk with them,\" he answered her startled question.  \"Can they see me here behind you?\"  \"I guess so. Maybe not too clear, but they'll see somebody's with me. What's the difference? It'll just save them a shock later.\"  \"Why should they see me at all? I can hide till after you leave the ship, and--.\"  \"Fat chance!\" grunted Dudley. \"Forget it.\"  \"Please, Dudley! I--I don't want to get you in any trouble, for one thing. At least, let me get out of sight now. Maybe you'll change your mind before we land.\"  He looked at her, and the anxiety seemed real enough. Knowing he was only letting her postpone the unpleasantness but reluctant to make her face it, he shrugged.  \"All right, then! Go somewhere and wipe that stuff off your face. But stop dreaming!\"  He waited until she had disappeared into one or another of the tiny compartments behind the control room, then sent out his call to the Lunar settlement.  The problem did not affect his landing; in fact, he did better than usual. His stubby but deft fingers lacked their ordinary tendency to tighten up, now that part of his mind was rehearsing the best way to explain the presence of an unauthorized passenger.  In the end, when he had the rocket parked neatly on the extremities of its fins less than a quarter of a mile from one of the port domes, he had not yet made up his mind.  \"Nice landing, Pete,\" the ground observer told him. \"Buy you a drink later?\"  \"Uh ... yeah, sure!\" Dudley answered. \"Say, is Jack Fisher anywhere around?\"  \"Jack? No, I guess he's gone bottom level. We're having 'night' just now, you know. Why? What do you want a cop for?\"  Suddenly, it was too difficult.  _If she could hide as long as she did, she could have done it all the way_, he told himself.  \"Oh, don't wake him up if he's asleep,\" he said hastily. \"I just thought I'd have dinner with him sometime before I leave.\"  He waited sullenly while the great self-propelled machines glided out over the smooth floor of the crater toward the ship, despising himself for giving in.  _Well, I just won't know anything about her_, he decided. _Let her have her little fling on Luna! It won't last long._  He closed the key that would guard against accidental"]]]
