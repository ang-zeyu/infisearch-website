Hodson's face was then like sunshine      breaking through the dark clouds of despondency and gloom      that would settle down occasionally on all but a few brave      hearts, England's worthiest sons, who were determined to      conquer.\"  But this siege does set one really thinking in earnest about several things, and this is the conclusion at which our Lieutenant arrives:--       \"There is but one rule of action for a soldier in the field,      as for a man at all times, to do that which is best for the      public good; to make that your sole aim, resting assured      that the result will in the end be best for individual      interest also. I am quite indifferent not to see my name      appear in newspaper paragraphs and despatches; only content      if I can perform my duty truly and honestly, and too      thankful to the Almighty if I am daily spared for future      labors or future repose.\"  But here is another coil this June 27th:--       \"There has been an outcry throughout the camp at ----'s      having fled from Bhagput, the bridge which caused me so much      hard riding and hard work to get, some time ago.\"  He has actually bolted, on a report of mutineers coming, leaving boats, bridge, and all. By this conduct he has lost our communication with Meerut, and that too when our reinforcements were actually in sight. The consequence is that I have to go down to Bhagput to recover boats, bridge, &c., and reopen communication, which is done at once and satisfactorily; and by July 2d we are quite comfortable, for I have set myself up with plates, &c., for one rupee, and Colonel Seaton's traps and servants will be here to-day ... except that we are somewhat vexed in our spirits, for       \"---- has been shelved and allowed to get sick, to save him      from supersession. I do not like euphuisms. In these days      men and things should be called by their right names, that      we might know how far either should be trusted.       \"_July 5th._--General Barnard dies of cholera after a few      hours' illness. Personally I am much grieved, for no kinder      or more considerate or gentlemanly man ever lived. I am so      sorry for his son, a fine brave fellow, whose attention to      his father won the love of us all. It was quite beautiful to      see them together.\"  And so we plunge on day after day, the rain nearly flooding us out of camp. Will the ladies in the hills make us some flannel shirts?       \"The soldiers bear up like men, but the constant state of      wet is no small addition to what they have to endure from      heat, hard work, and fighting. I know by experience what a      comfort a dry flannel shirt is.       \"_July 12th._--Three hundred of my new regiment arrive; very      fine-looking fellows, most of them. I am getting quite a      little army under me, what with the Guides and my own men.      Would to Heaven they would give us something more to do than      this desultory warfare, which destroys our best men, and      brings us no whit nearer Delhi, and removes the end of the      campaign to an indefinite period.\"  Another fight this 14th July, one of the sharpest we have yet had, and we who have to lead were obliged to expose ourselves, but really not more than we could help; and how the papers can have got hold of this wound story I can't think, for I didn't tell it even to you. The facts are thus:--       \"A rascally Pandy made a thrust at my horse, which I      parried, when he seized his 'tulwar' in both hands, bringing      it down like a sledge-hammer; it caught on the iron of my      antigropelos legging, which it broke into the skin, cut      through the stirrup-leather, and took a slice off my boot      and stocking; and yet, wonderful to say, the sword did not      penetrate the skin. Both my horse and myself were staggered      by the force of the blow, but I recovered myself quickly,      and I don't think that Pandy will ever raise his 'tulwar'      again.\"  But, to show you that I did no more than was necessary, I must tell you what Chamberlain had to do, who led in another part.       \"Seeing a hesitation among the troops he led, who did not      like the look of a wall lined with Pandies, and stopped      short, instead of going up to it, he leaped his horse clean      over the wall into the midst of them, and dared the men to      follow, which they did, but he got a ball in the shoulder.\"  I must positively give up the Quartermaster-General's work; head-quarters' staff seems breaking down altogether. General Reed goes to the hills to-night; Congreve and Curzon have been sent off, too; Chamberlain and Becher on their backs with wounds.       \"Colonel Young, Norman, and myself, are therefore the only      representatives of the head-quarters' staff, except the      doctors and commissaries. I am wonderfully well, thank God!      and able to get through as much work as any man; but      commanding two regiments, and being eyes and ears to the      whole army, too, is really too much.\"  Again, to-day (July 19) a sharp fight; Pandies in great force--driven pellmell up to the walls; but how about getting back.       \"We were commanded by a fine old gentleman, who might sit      for a portrait of Falstaff, so fat and jolly is he, Colonel      Jones, of 60th Rifles.\"  Jolly old Briton, with the clearest possible notion of going on, but as for retiring, little enough idea of that sort of work in Colonel Jones.       \"The instant we began to draw off, they followed us, their      immense numbers giving them a great power of annoyance at      very slight cost to themselves. The brave old colonel was      going to retire 'all of a heap,' infantry, guns, and all in      a helpless mass, and we should have suffered cruel loss in      those narrow roads, with walls and buildings on both sides.      I rode up to him and pointed this out, and in reply received      _carte blanche_ to act as I saw best. This was soon done,      with the assistance of Henry Vicars (Adjutant 61st) and      Coghill (Adjutant 2d Bengal European Fusileers), both cool      soldiers under fire, though so young, and we got off in good      order and with trifling loss, drawing the men back slowly,      and in regular order, covered by Dixon's and Money's guns.\"  This colonel, too, with no notion of retreating, is a candid man; goes straight to the general on his return, and begs to thank our Lieutenant, and to say he hopes for no better aid whenever he has to lead; unlike some persons under whom we have served.       \"The general has begged me to give up the Guides, and not      the quartermaster-general's office. You, at least, will      rejoice that it greatly diminishes the risk to life and      limb, which, I confess, lately has been excessive in my      case.\"  News of Wheeler's surrender--of the massacre four days later (July 26), and our blood is running fire. \"There will be a day of reckoning for these things, and a fierce one, or I have been a soldier in vain.\" Another fight on the 24th, and Seaton down with chest-wound, but doing well; \"he is patient and gentle in suffering as a woman, and this helps his recovery wonderfully.\" ... Thanks for the flannel waistcoats; but as for you and Mrs. ---- coming to camp as nurses, no.       \"Unless any unforeseen emergency should arise, I would      strongly dissuade any lady from coming to camp. They would      all very speedily become patients in the very hospitals      which they came to serve, and would so willingly support.      The flannel garments are invaluable, and this is all that      can be done for us by female hands at present.... You say      there is a great difference between doing one's duty and      running unnecessary risks, and you say truly; the only      question, what is one's duty. Now, I might, as I have more      than once, see things going wrong at a time and place when I      might be merely a spectator, and not 'on duty,' or ordered      to be there, and I might feel that by exposing myself to      danger for a time I might rectify matters, and I might      therefore think it right to incur that danger; and yet, if I      were to get hit, it would be said 'he had no business      there;' nor should I, as far as the rules of the service go,      though, in my own mind, I should have been satisfied that I      was right. These are times when every man should do his      best, his utmost, and not say, 'No; though I see I can do      good there, yet, as I have not been ordered and am not on      duty, I will not do it.' This is not my idea of a soldier's      duty, and hitherto the results have proved me right.\"  _August 3d._--Rumor that Sir Henry is dead at Lucknow. The news has quite unnerved me. 5th.--Nana Sahib, the murderer (you remember the man at the artillery review, a \"swell\" looking native gentleman, who spoke French, and was talking a good deal to Alfred Light), has been beaten by Havelock, they say has drowned himself.       \"I hope it is not true; for it is one of my aims to have the      catching of the said Nana myself. The hanging him would be a      positive pleasure to me.... Nicholson has come on ahead of      our reinforcements from the Punjaub; a host in himself, if      he does not go and get knocked over as Chamberlain did.       \"General Wilson has been down for some days, but is now      better, but nervous and over-anxious about trifles.... These      men are, personally, as brave as lions, but they have not      big hearts or heads enough for circumstances of serious      responsibility....       \"_August 11th._--Talking of jealousies, one day, under a      heavy fire, Captain ---- came up to me, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39448"],["title","Twelve Years of a Soldier's Life in India (#7)"],["body","begged me to      forget and forgive what had passed, and only to remember      that we were soldiers fighting together in a common cause.      As I was the injured party, I could afford to do this. The      time and place, as well as his manner, appealed to my better      feelings, so I held out my hand at once. Nowadays, we must      stand by and help each other, forget all injuries, and rise      superior to them, or God help us! we should be in terrible      plight.\"  _August 12th_.--A brilliant affair under Showers; four guns taken. Brave young Owen wounded, \"riding astride one gun, and a soldier with musket and fixed bayonet riding each horse, the rest cheering like mad things. I was in the thick of it, _by accident_.\"  By this time, Pandy, having been beaten severely in twenty-three fights, has had nearly enough of it, and is very chary of doing more than firing long shots, so there is no longer so much need of our Lieutenant in camp. He may surely be useful in clearing the neighborhood and restoring British rule and order; so we find him starting for Rohtuck, on 17th August, with three hundred men and five officers,--all his own men, and first-rate,--and Macdowell, two Goughs, Ward, and Wise. On the 18th the inhabitants send supplies and fair words, but there is a body of a thousand infantry and three hundred horse close by, who must be handled. Accordingly, they are drawn into the open by a feigned retreat, and come on firing and yelling in crowds.  \"Threes about and at them;\" five parties, each headed by an officer, are upon them. \"Never was such a scatter; they fled as if not the Guides and Hodson's Horse, but death and the devil, were at their heels.\" Only eight of my men touched. This will encourage my new hands, utterly untrained.  Another skirmish, and now--       \"In three days we have frightened away and demoralized a      force of artillery, cavalry, and infantry, some two thousand      strong, beat those who stood or returned to fight us, twice,      in spite of numbers, and got fed and furnished forth by the      rascally town itself. Moreover, we have thoroughly cowed the      whole neighborhood, and given them a taste of what more they      will get unless they keep quiet in future.... This is a      terribly egotistical detail, and I am thoroughly ashamed of      saying so much of myself; but you insisted on having a full,      true, and particular account, so do not think me      vainglorious.\"  Next come orders, but sadly indefinite ones, to look out for and destroy the 10th Light Cavalry, who are out in the Jheend district:--       \"He must either say distinctly 'do this or that,' and I will      do it; or he must give me _carte blanche_ to do what he      wants in the most practicable way, of which I, knowing the      country, can best judge. I am not going to fag my men and      horses to death, and then be told I have exceeded my      instructions. He gives me immense credit for what I have      done, but 'almost wishes I had not ventured so far.' The old      gentleman means well, but does not understand either the      country or the position I was in, nor does he appreciate a      tenth part of the effects which our bold stroke at Rohtuck,      forty-five miles from camp, has produced. '_N'importe_,'      they will find it out sooner or later. I hear both      Chamberlain and Nicholson took my view of the case, and      supported me warmly.... I foresee that I shall remain a      subaltern, and the easy-going majors of brigade,      aides-de-camp, and staff-officers will all get brevets.\"  Too true, my Lieutenant.       \"The Victoria Cross, I confess, is the highest object of my      ambition, and had I been one of Fortune's favorites, I      should have had it ere now.\"  True again.       \"But, whether a lieutenant or lieutenant-general, I trust I      shall continue to do my duty to the best of my judgment and      ability, as long as strength and sense are vouchsafed to      me.\"  We trust, and are on the whole by this time prepared to hazard a prophecy, that you will so continue, whether lieutenant or general.  _August 26th._--A glorious victory at Nujjufghur, by Nicholson. I was not there. Ill in camp; worse luck.... Scouring the country again till August 30th, when I have to receive an emissary from Delhi to treat.  Sir Colin Campbell is, they say, at Calcutta, and Mansfield, as chief of the staff; so now we may get some leading.  We are in Delhi at last (September 15th), but with grievous loss. My dear old regiment (1st Fusileers) suffered out of all proportion.       \"Of the officers engaged only Wriford, Wallace, and I are      untouched. My preservation (I don't like the word _escape_)      was miraculous.\" ...  Nicholson dangerously hit; ten out of seventeen engineer officers killed or wounded.       ... \"'You may count our real officers on your fingers now.'       \"_Sept. 16th._--I grieve much for poor Jacob; we buried him      and three sergeants of the regiment, last night; he was a      noble soldier. His death has made me captain, the long      wished-for goal; but I would rather have served on as a      subaltern than gained promotion thus.       \"_Sept. 19th._--We are making slow progress in the city.      The fact is, the troops are utterly demoralized by hard work      and hard drink, I grieve to say. For the first time in my      life, I have had to see English soldiers refuse, repeatedly,      to follow their officers. Greville, Jacob, Nicholson, and      Speke were all sacrificed to this.       \"_Sept. 22d._--In the Royal Palace, Delhi.--I was quite      unable to write yesterday, having had a hard day's work. I      was fortunate enough to capture the King and his favorite      wife. To-day, more fortunate still, I have seized and      destroyed the King's two sons and a grandson (the famous, or      rather infamous, Abu Bukt), the villains who ordered the      massacre of our women and children, and stood by and      witnessed the foul barbarity; their bodies are now lying on      the spot where those of the unfortunate ladies were exposed.      I am very tired, but very much satisfied with my day's work,      and so seem all hands.\"  This is Hodson's account of the two most remarkable exploits in even his career. We have no space to give his own full narrative, which he writes later, upon being pressed to do so; or the graphic account of Macdowell, his lieutenant, which will be found in the book, and it would be literary murder to mutilate such gems. As to defending the shooting of the two princes, let those do it who feel that a defence is needed, for we believe that no Englishman, worth convincing, now doubts as to the righteousness and policy of the act, and probably the old Radical general-officer and M. P., who thought it his duty to call Hodson hard names at the time, has reconsidered his opinion. Whether he has or not, however, matters little. He who did the deed, and is gone, cared not for hasty or false tongues,--why should we?       \"Strange,\" he says, \"that some of those who are loudest      against me for sparing the King, are also crying out at my      destroying his sons. 'Quousque tandem?' I may well exclaim.      But, in point of fact, I am quite indifferent to clamor      either way. I made up my mind, at the time, to be abused. I      was convinced I was right, and when I prepared to run the      great physical risk of the attempt, I was equally game for      the moral risk of praise or blame. These have not been, and      are not times when a man who would serve his country dare      hesitate, as to the personal consequences to himself, of      what he thinks his duty.\"  \"By Jove, Hodson, they ought to make you Commander-in-Chief for this,\" shouts the enthusiast to whom the prisoners were handed over. \"Well, I'm glad you have got him, but I never expected to see either him or you again,\" says the Commander-in-Chief, and sits down and writes the following despatch:--       \"The King, who accompanied the troops for some short      distance last night, gave himself up to a party of Irregular      Cavalry, whom I sent out in the direction of the fugitives,      and he is now a prisoner under a guard of European      soldiers.\"  Delhi is ours; but at what a cost in officers and men! and Nicholson is dead.       \"With the single exception of my ever revered friend, Sir      Henry Lawrence, and Colonel Mackeson, I have never met his      equal in field or council; he was preëminently our best and      bravest, and his loss is not to be atoned for in these days.       \"The troops have behaved with singular moderation towards      women and children, considering their provocation. I do not      believe, and I have some means of knowing, that a single      woman or child has been purposely injured by our troops, and      the story on which your righteous indignation is grounded is      quite false; the troops have been demoralized by drink, but      nothing more.\"  In November he gets a few weeks' leave, and is off to Umbala to meet his wife for the last time, safe after all, and no longer a lieutenant under a cloud. What a meeting must that have been.  With the taking of Delhi our narrative, already too long, must close, though a grand five months of heroic action still remained. Nothing in the book exceeds in interest the ride of ninety-four miles from Seaton's column, with young Macdowell, to carry a despatch to Sir Colin, on December 30th. The tale of the early morning summons, the rumors of enemies on the road, the suspense as to the Chief's whereabouts, the leaving all escort behind, their flattering and cordial reception by Sir Colin, (who gets them \"chops and ale in a quiet friendly way,\") the fifty-four miles' ride home, the midnight alarm and escape, and the safe run in, take away our breath. And the finish is inimitable.       \"All Hodson said,\" writes Macdowell, \"when we were at Bewar,      and safe, was 'By George! Mac, I'd"]]]
