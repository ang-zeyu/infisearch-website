Hannah did not come back, nor was she to be found in the house at breakfast time.  “You say she took a candle with her,” said the coroner. “Was it in a candlestick?”  “No, sir; loose like.”  “Why did she take a candle? Does not Mr. Leavenworth burn gas in his halls?”  “Yes, sir; but we put the gas out as we go up, and Hannah is afraid of the dark.”  “If she took a candle, it must be lying somewhere about the house. Now, has anybody seen a stray candle?”  “Not as I knows on, sir.”  “Is _this_ it?” exclaimed a voice over my shoulder.  It was Mr. Gryce, and he was holding up into view a half-burned paraffine candle.  “Yes, sir; lor’, where did you find it?”  “In the grass of the carriage yard, half-way from the kitchen door to the street,” he quietly returned.  Sensation. A clue, then, at last! Something had been found which seemed to connect this mysterious murder with the outside world. Instantly the back-door assumed the chief position of interest. The candle found lying in the yard seemed to prove, not only that Hannah had left the house shortly after descending from her room, but had left it by the back-door, which we now remembered was only a few steps from the iron gate opening into the side street. But Thomas, being recalled, repeated his assertion that not only the back-door, but all the lower windows of the house, had been found by him securely locked and bolted at six o’clock that morning. Inevitable conclusion--some one had locked and bolted them after the girl. Who? Alas, that had now become the very serious and momentous question.     V. EXPERT TESTIMONY        “And often-times, to win us to our harm,       The instruments of darkness tell us truths;       Win us with honest trifles, to betray us       In deepest consequence.”                                                Macbeth.   In the midst of the universal gloom thus awakened there came a sharp ring at the bell. Instantly all eyes turned toward the parlor door, just as it slowly opened, and the officer who had been sent off so mysteriously by the coroner an hour before entered, in company with a young man, whose sleek appearance, intelligent eye, and general air of trustworthiness, seemed to proclaim him to be, what in fact he was, the confidential clerk of a responsible mercantile house.  Advancing without apparent embarrassment, though each and every eye in the room was fixed upon him with lively curiosity, he made a slight bow to the coroner.  “You have sent for a man from Bohn & Co.,” he said.  Strong and immediate excitement. Bohn & Co. was the well-known pistol and ammunition store of ---- Broadway.  “Yes, sir,” returned the coroner. “We have here a bullet, which we must ask you to examine, You are fully acquainted with all matters connected with your business?”  The young man, merely elevating an expressive eyebrow, took the bullet carelessly in his hand.  “Can you tell us from what make of pistol that was delivered?”  The young man rolled it slowly round between his thumb and forefinger, and then laid it down. “It is a No. 32 ball, usually sold with the small pistol made by Smith & Wesson.”  “A small pistol!” exclaimed the butler, jumping up from his seat. “Master used to keep a little pistol in his stand drawer. I have often seen it. We all knew about it.”  Great and irrepressible excitement, especially among the servants. “That’s so!” I heard a heavy voice exclaim. “I saw it once myself--master was cleaning it.” It was the cook who spoke.  “In his stand drawer?” the coroner inquired.  “Yes, sir; at the head of his bed.”  An officer was sent to examine the stand drawer. In a few moments he returned, bringing a small pistol which he laid down on the coroner’s table, saying, “Here it is.”  Immediately, every one sprang to his feet, but the coroner, handing it over to the clerk from Bonn’s, inquired if that was the make before mentioned. Without hesitation he replied, “Yes, Smith & Wesson; you can see for yourself,” and he proceeded to examine it.  “Where did you find this pistol?” asked the coroner of the officer.  “In the top drawer of a shaving table standing near the head of Mr. Leavenworth’s bed. It was lying in a velvet case together with a box of cartridges, one of which I bring as a sample,” and he laid it down beside the bullet.  “Was the drawer locked?”  “Yes, sir; but the key was not taken out.”  Interest had now reached its climax. A universal cry swept through the room, “Is it loaded?”  The coroner, frowning on the assembly, with a look of great dignity, remarked:  “I was about to ask that question myself, but first I must request order.”  An immediate calm followed. Every one was too much interested to interpose any obstacle in the way of gratifying his curiosity.  “Now, sir!” exclaimed the coroner.  The clerk from Bonn’s, taking out the cylinder, held it up. “There are seven chambers here, and they are all loaded.”  A murmur of disappointment followed this assertion.  “But,” he quietly added after a momentary examination of the face of the cylinder, “they have not all been loaded long. A bullet has been recently shot from one of these chambers.”  “How do you know?” cried one of the jury.  “How do I know? Sir,” said he, turning to the coroner, “will you be kind enough to examine the condition of this pistol?” and he handed it over to that gentleman. “Look first at the barrel; it is clean and bright, and shows no evidence of a bullet having passed out of it very lately; that is because it has been cleaned. But now, observe the face of the cylinder: what do you see there?”  “I see a faint line of smut near one of the chambers.”  “Just so; show it to the gentlemen.”  It was immediately handed down.  “That faint line of smut, on the edge of one of the chambers, is the telltale, sirs. A bullet passing out always leaves smut behind. The man who fired this, remembering the fact, cleaned the barrel, but forgot the cylinder.” And stepping aside he folded his arms.  “Jerusalem!” spoke out a rough, hearty voice, “isn’t that wonderful!” This exclamation came from a countryman who had stepped in from the street, and now stood agape in the doorway.  It was a rude but not altogether unwelcome interruption. A smile passed round the room, and both men and women breathed more easily. Order being at last restored, the officer was requested to describe the position of the stand, and its distance from the library table.  “The library table is in one room, and the stand in another. To reach the former from the latter, one would be obliged to cross Mr. Leavenworth’s bedroom in a diagonal direction, pass through the passageway separating that one apartment from the other, and----”  “Wait a moment; how does this table stand in regard to the door which leads from the bedroom into the hall?”  “One might enter that door, pass directly round the foot of the bed to the stand, procure the pistol, and cross half-way over to the passageway, without being seen by any one sitting or standing in the library beyond.”  “Holy Virgin!” exclaimed the horrified cook, throwing her apron over her head as if to shut out some dreadful vision. “Hannah niver would have the pluck for that; niver, niver!” But Mr. Gryce, laying a heavy hand on the woman, forced her back into her seat, reproving and calming her at the same time, with a dexterity marvellous to behold. “I beg your pardons,” she cried deprecatingly to those around; “but it niver was Hannah, niver!”  The clerk from Bohn’s here being dismissed, those assembled took the opportunity of making some change in their position, after which, the name of Mr. Harwell was again called. That person rose with manifest reluctance. Evidently the preceding testimony had either upset some theory of his, or indubitably strengthened some unwelcome suspicion.  “Mr. Harwell,” the coroner began, “we are told of the existence of a pistol belonging to Mr. Leavenworth, and upon searching, we discover it in his room. Did you know of his possessing such an instrument?”  “I did.”  “Was it a fact generally known in the house?”  “So it would seem.”  “How was that? Was he in the habit of leaving it around where any one could see it?”  “I cannot say; I can only acquaint you with the manner in which I myself became aware of its existence.”  “Very well, do so.”  “We were once talking about firearms. I have some taste that way, and have always been anxious to possess a pocket-pistol. Saying something of the kind to him one day, he rose from his seat and, fetching me this, showed it to me.”  “How long ago was this?”  “Some few months since.”  “He has owned this pistol, then, for some time?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Is that the only occasion upon which you have ever seen it?”  “No, sir,”--the secretary blushed--“I have seen it once since.”  “When?”  “About three weeks ago.”  “Under what circumstances?”  The secretary dropped his head, a certain drawn look making itself suddenly visible on his countenance.  “Will you not excuse me, gentlemen?” he asked, after a moment’s hesitation.  “It is impossible,” returned the coroner.  His face grew even more pallid and deprecatory. “I am obliged to introduce the name of a lady,” he hesitatingly declared.  “We are very sorry,” remarked the coroner.  The young man turned fiercely upon him, and I could not help wondering that I had ever thought him commonplace. “Of Miss Eleanore Leavenworth!” he cried.  At that name, so uttered, every one started but Mr. Gryce; he was engaged in holding a close and confidential confab with his finger-tips, and did not appear to notice.  “Surely it is contrary to the rules of decorum and the respect we all feel for the lady"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4047"],["title","The Leavenworth Case (#7)"],["body","to introduce her name into this discussion,” continued Mr. Harwell. But the coroner still insisting upon an answer, he refolded his arms (a movement indicative of resolution with him), and began in a low, forced tone to say:  [Illustration: “What was my astonishment to come upon Miss Eleanore Leavenworth standing at the side of her uncle’s bed, with his pistol in her hand”]  “It is only this, gentlemen. One afternoon, about three weeks since, I had occasion to go to the library at an unusual hour. Crossing over to the mantel-piece for the purpose of procuring a penknife which I had carelessly left there in the morning, I heard a noise in the adjoining room. Knowing that Mr. Leavenworth was out, and supposing the ladies to be out also, I took the liberty of ascertaining who the intruder was; when what was my astonishment to come upon Miss Eleanore Leavenworth, standing at the side of her uncle’s bed, with his pistol in her hand. Confused at my indiscretion, I attempted to escape without being observed; but in vain, for just as I was crossing the threshold, she turned and, calling me by name, requested me to explain the pistol to her. Gentlemen, in order to do so, I was obliged to take it in my hand; and that, sirs, is the only other occasion upon which I ever saw or handled the pistol of Mr. Leavenworth.” Drooping his head, he waited in indescribable agitation for the next question.  “She asked you to explain the pistol to her; what do you mean by that?”  “I mean,” he faintly continued, catching his breath in a vain effort to appear calm, “how to load, aim, and fire it.”  A flash of awakened feeling shot across the faces of all present. Even the coroner showed sudden signs of emotion, and sat staring at the bowed form and pale countenance of the man before him, with a peculiar look of surprised compassion, which could not fail of producing its effect, not only upon the young man himself, but upon all who saw him.  “Mr. Harwell,” he at length inquired, “have you anything to add to the statement you have just made?”  The secretary sadly shook his head.  “Mr. Gryce,” I here whispered, clutching that person by the arm and dragging him down to my side; “assure me, I entreat you--” but he would not let me finish.  “The coroner is about to ask for the young ladies,” he quickly interposed. “If you desire to fulfil your duty towards them, be ready, that’s all.”  Fulfil my duty! The simple words recalled me to myself. What had I been thinking of; was I mad? With nothing more terrible in mind than a tender picture of the lovely cousins bowed in anguish over the remains of one who had been as dear as a father to them, I slowly rose, and upon demand being made for Miss Mary and Miss Eleanore Leavenworth, advanced and said that, as a friend of the family--a petty lie, which I hope will not be laid up against me--I begged the privilege of going for the ladies and escorting them down.  Instantly a dozen eyes flashed upon me, and I experienced the embarrassment of one who, by some unexpected word or action, has drawn upon himself the concentrated attention of a whole room.  But the permission sought being almost immediately accorded, I was speedily enabled to withdraw from my rather trying position, finding myself, almost before I knew it, in the hall, my face aflame, my heart beating with excitement, and these words of Mr. Gryce ringing in my ears: “Third floor, rear room, first door at the head of the stairs. You will find the young ladies expecting you.”     VI. SIDE-LIGHTS        “Oh! she has beauty might ensnare       A conqueror’s soul, and make him leave his crown       At random, to be scuffled for by slaves.”                                                    OTWAY.   Third floor, rear room, first door at the head of the stairs! What was I about to encounter there?  Mounting the lower flight, and shuddering by the library wall, which to my troubled fancy seemed written all over with horrible suggestions, I took my way slowly up-stairs, revolving in my mind many things, among which an admonition uttered long ago by my mother occupied a prominent place.  “My son, remember that a woman with a secret may be a fascinating study, but she can never be a safe, nor even satisfactory, companion.”  A wise saw, no doubt, but totally inapplicable to the present situation; yet it continued to haunt me till the sight of the door to which I had been directed put every other thought to flight save that I was about to meet the stricken nieces of a brutally murdered man.  [Illustration: “Pausing only long enough on the threshold to compose myself for the interview, I lifted my hand to knock”]  Pausing only long enough on the threshold to compose myself for the interview, I lifted my hand to knock, when a rich, clear voice rose from within, and I heard distinctly uttered these astounding words: “I do not accuse your hand, though I know of none other which would or could have done this deed; but your heart, your head, your will, these I do and must accuse, in my secret mind at least; and it is well that you should know it!”  Struck with horror, I staggered back, my hands to my ears, when a touch fell on my arm, and turning, I saw Mr. Gryce standing close beside me, with his finger on his lip, and the last flickering shadow of a flying emotion fading from his steady, almost compassionate countenance.  “Come, come,” he exclaimed; “I see you don’t begin to know what kind of a world you are living in. Rouse yourself; remember they are waiting down below.”  “But who is it? Who was it that spoke?”  “That we shall soon see.” And without waiting to meet, much less answer, my appealing look, he struck his hand against the door, and flung it wide open.  Instantly a flush of lovely color burst upon us. Blue curtains, blue carpets, blue walls. It was like a glimpse of heavenly azure in a spot where only darkness and gloom were to be expected. Fascinated by the sight, I stepped impetuously forward, but instantly paused again, overcome and impressed by the exquisite picture I saw before me.  [Illustration: “Her whole appearance was so startling, so extraordinary, that I held my breath in surprise”]  Seated in an easy chair of embroidered satin, but rousing from her half-recumbent position, like one who was in the act of launching a powerful invective, I beheld a glorious woman. Fair, frail, proud, delicate; looking like a lily in the thick creamy-tinted wrapper that alternately clung to and swayed from her finely moulded figure; with her forehead, crowned with the palest of pale tresses, lifted and flashing with power; one quivering hand clasping the arm of her chair, the other outstretched and pointing toward some distant object in the room,--her whole appearance was so startling, so extraordinary, that I held my breath in surprise, actually for the moment doubting if it were a living woman I beheld, or some famous pythoness conjured up from ancient story, to express in one tremendous gesture the supreme indignation of outraged womanhood.  “Miss Mary Leavenworth,” whispered that ever present voice over my shoulder.  Ah! Mary Leavenworth! What a relief came with this name. This beautiful creature, then, was not the Eleanore who could load, aim, and fire a pistol. Turning my head, I followed the guiding of that uplifted hand, now frozen into its place by a new emotion: the emotion of being interrupted in the midst of a direful and pregnant revelation, and saw--but, no, here description fails me! Eleanore Leavenworth must be painted by other hands than mine. I could sit half the day and dilate upon the subtle grace, the pale magnificence, the perfection of form and feature which make Mary Leavenworth the wonder of all who behold her; but Eleanore--I could as soon paint the beatings of my own heart. Beguiling, terrible, grand, pathetic, that face of faces flashed upon my gaze, and instantly the moonlight loveliness of her cousin faded from my memory, and I saw only Eleanore--only Eleanore from that moment on forever.  When my glance first fell upon her, she was standing by the side of a small table, with her face turned toward her cousin, and her two hands resting, the one upon her breast, the other on the table, in an attitude of antagonism. But before the sudden pang which shot through me at the sight of her beauty had subsided, her head had turned, her gaze had encountered mine; all the horror of the situation had burst upon her, and, instead of a haughty woman, drawn up to receive and trample upon the insinuations of another, I beheld, alas! a trembling, panting human creature, conscious that a sword hung above her head, and without a word to say why it should not fall and slay her.  It was a pitiable change; a heart-rending revelation! I turned from it as from a confession. But just then, her cousin, who had apparently regained her self-possession at the first betrayal of emotion on the part of the other, stepped forward and, holding out her hand, inquired:  “Is not this Mr. Raymond? How kind of you, sir. And you?” turning to Mr. Gryce; “you have come to tell us we are wanted below, is it not so?”  It was the voice I had heard through the door, but modulated to a sweet, winning, almost caressing tone.  Glancing hastily at Mr. Gryce, I looked to see how he was affected by it. Evidently much, for the bow with which he greeted her words was lower than ordinary, and the smile with which he met her earnest look both deprecatory and reassuring. His glance did not embrace her cousin, though her eyes were fixed upon his face with an inquiry in their depths more agonizing than the utterance of any cry would have been. Knowing Mr. Gryce as I did, I felt that nothing could promise worse, or be more significant, than this transparent disregard of one who seemed to fill the room with her terror. And, struck with pity, I forgot that Mary Leavenworth had spoken, forgot her very presence in fact, and, turning hastily away, took one step toward her cousin, when"]]]
