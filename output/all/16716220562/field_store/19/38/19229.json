Viewed from the fore-bridge of H.M. torpedo-boat destroyer _Calder_, there was little in the outlook to suggest that a state of war had existed for twenty months.  The same short steep seas, the same lowering sky, the almost unbroken horizon towards which many anxious glances were hourly directed in the hope that \"they\" had at last come out.  Two cables’ distance from the _Calder_, a typical trawler, with dense columns of smoke issuing from her funnel, was forging slowly ahead. Another vessel of a similar type was steaming in almost the opposite direction, and on a course that would bring her close under the stern of the almost motionless destroyer.  From the galley funnel of each trawler a trail of bluish smoke was issuing, the reek as it drifted across the _Calder’s_ deck indicating pretty plainly the nature of the \"hands’\" breakfast.  Of the crew of either craft no one was visible, the helmsman in each case sheltering in the ugly squat wheel-house on the bridge.  Acting Sub-lieutenant Sefton brought his binoculars to bear upon the nearmost trawler.  The action was merely a perfunctory one.  He knew both trawlers almost about as much as their own crews did, and certainly more than their respective owners in pre-war times.  For close on fifty hours, watch in and watch out, the _Calder_ had been dancing attendance on these two almost insignificant specimens of the North Sea fishing-fleet--the _Carse o’ Gowrie_ and the _Dimpled Lassie_, both registered at the port of Aberdeen.  Carrying bare steerage-way, the destroyer glided slowly past the _Dimpled Lassie’s_ port quarter. From the trawler’s stern a flexible wire hawser led beneath the foaming wake of the propeller, dipping with a sag that did not gladden the heart of the young officer of the watch.  \"Any luck yet?\" shouted Sefton through an enormous megaphone.  At the hail two men’s heads appeared above the bulwarks aft, while a greatcoated figure came in view from behind the storm-dodgers of the trawler’s bridge.  \"Not the least, sir,\" replied the master of the _Dimpled Lassie_, Peter M’Kie, skipper R.N.R. \"Are we right, sir?\"  The acting-sub had a few minutes previously taken an observation.  The destroyer was playing the part of nursemaid to the two trawlers, for although both skippers could find their way, even in thick weather, almost anywhere in the North Sea, solely by the aid of lead-line and compass, neither had the faintest experience in the use of the sextant.  \"Ought to be right over it,\" replied Sefton. \"Carry on, and trust to luck.\"  The trawlers were \"creeping\" with grapnels. Not for mines, although there was always a possibility of hooking one of those fiendish contrivances. That was a risk that the tough fisherman faced with an equanimity bordering on fatalism.  Mine-sweeping they had engaged upon almost continuously since the notable month of August, 1914.  Now they were on particular service--a service of such importance and where so much secrecy was imperative that these two Scottish trawlers had been sent expressly from a northern base to scour the bed of the North Sea in the neighbourhood of Great Yarmouth, where there were Government craft for disposal in abundance.  Sefton replaced his binoculars, and, turning, found that his superior officer had just come on deck and was standing at his elbow.  Lieutenant Richard Crosthwaite, D.S.O., the \"owner\" of the destroyer, was one of those young officers who had made good use of the chances that the war had thrown in his way.  Specially promoted for good work in the Dardanelles, he found himself at a comparatively early age in command of a destroyer that had already made a name for herself in the gallant but ill-starred operations against the Turks.  \"Well, Mr. Sefton?\" he asked.  \"Nothing much to report, sir,\" replied the acting-sub. \"But we’ll get it yet,\" he added confidently.  Evidently \"it\"--hardly ever referred to by any other designation--was more elusive than Crosthwaite had imagined.  A shade of disappointment flitted across his tanned features.  The task upon which the trawlers were engaged was a matter of extreme urgency.  At Whitehall anxious admirals awaited the news that \"it\" had been fished up; but \"it\", reposing serenely on the bed of the North Sea, had resolutely declined to receive the embraces of a couple of heavy grapnels.  Crosthwaite, after giving a searching glance to windward, stepped to the head of the ladder.  An alert bos’n’s mate, awaiting the signal, piped the starboard watch.  Saluting, Sefton gained the deck and went aft, his mind dwelling on the prospects of breakfast and a much-needed sleep.  The ward-room, a scantily-furnished apartment extending the whole width of the ship, was showing signs of activity.  From one of the adjoining dog-boxes, termed by courtesy a cabin, a short, full-faced, jovial-featured man had just emerged, clad in regulation trousers and a sweater.  His curly light-brown hair was still wet, as the result of his ablutions, a slight gash upon the point of his chin betokened the fact that he had tempted fate by shaving in a stiff seaway, and by the aid of an ordinary razor dulled by the penetrating salt air.  \"Oh, it’s quiet down here----\" he began singing in a ringing baritone.  \"No need to rub that in, Pills,\" exclaimed a drawling voice.  \"The fact is patent to all.  Can’t you give us ’They don’t run Corridor Cars on our Branch Line’ by way of a change?\"  Thereon hung a tale: something that took place when Jimmy Stirling first joined the mess at the Portsmouth Naval Barracks as a Probationary Surgeon, R.N.V.R.  \"I called attention to the fact that it was quiet down here with deliberate intent, my festive Box-spanner,\" retorted the surgeon.  \"At last, after weeks of expostulation, your minions have succeeded in quelling that demon of unrest, the steam steering-gear.  For the first time for a fortnight I have slept serenely, and, thanks to that blessed balm, I feel like a giant refreshed.  Now, how about it?\"  He made a dive into the adjoining cabin, where the engineer-lieutenant was in the act of struggling with a refractory collar.  The next instant the two men lurched into the ward-room engaged in what looked to be a mortal struggle.  Cannoning off the stove, sweeping a sheaf of books from the wall, glissading from the cushioned lockers, the high-spirited officers tackled each other with mock-serious desperation until, with a violent heave, the athletic doctor deposited his engineering confrère fairly upon the table.  With a series of crashes, cups, saucers, tureens, teapot, coffee-pot, eggs and bacon sidled in an indescribable state of chaos upon the floor.  \"Time!\" exclaimed Sefton authoritatively. \"Look here, you fellows.  I haven’t had my breakfast, and I suppose"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39489"],["title","With Beatty off Jutland: A Romance of the Great Sea Fight (#1)"],["body","haven’t had yours? Not that it matters to me.  And, Pills, has your supply of bromide run out?\"  The combatants separated and began taking stock of the damage.  \"You logged a gale of wind last night, I hope, Sefton?\" asked the engineer-lieutenant in tones of mock anxiety.  \"Must account for this smash-up, you know----  Any luck?  Have they got it?\"  The acting-sub, now that conversation had reverted to the inevitable \"it\", was bound to admit that the preceding night’s labours had been fruitless.  The possibilities of the recovery of the much-desired \"it\" monopolized the attention of the occupants of the ward-room until the steward, outwardly stolidly indifferent to the unsympathetic treatment of his labours, provided another repast.  They were boyish and high-spirited officers on H.M.T.B.D. _Calder_. Their pranks were but an antidote to the ceaseless strain of days and nights of watch and ward.  \"To get back to things mundane,\" persisted the engineer-lieutenant as the trio sat down to their belated meal, \"will they find it?\"  \"It is my firm belief that they will,\" replied Sefton decisively.  \"Even if we have to mark time about here for another month.\"  \"Heaven forbid!\" ejaculated the surgeon piously, \"I pine for fresh water.  Your vile condenser-brewed fluid is simply appalling, my festive Box-spanner. And I yearn for newspapers less than a week old.\"  The engineer-lieutenant glared defiance at his medical confrère.  He knew perfectly well that the water on board was brackish and insipid, but it was condensed under his personal supervision.  Any disparaging remarks upon his _métier_--even if uttered in jest--touched him to the quick.  A resumption of the \"scrap\" seemed imminent, when a bluejacket, tapping at the ward-room door, announced: \"Captain’s compliments, sir; they’ve just hooked it.\"     CHAPTER II--The Recovered Cable   Instantly there was a wild scramble on the part of the three officers to gain the deck, all other topics of interest vanishing before the all-important information.  A cable’s length on the port beam the _Carse o’ Gowrie_ was backing gently astern in order to close with her consort.  The _Dimpled Lassie_ was pitching sluggishly.  Way had been taken off her, while over her squat counter the wire hawser attached to the Lucas grapnel was \"straight up and down\" under the steady strain of some heavy and still submerged object.  From the destroyer’s bridge a signalman was semaphoring rapidly by means of hand-flags.  The _Dimpled Lassie_ replied.  The man had just finished delivering the message to Lieutenant-Commander Crosthwaite when Sefton and the other officers gained the bridge.  \"There’s no doubt about it now,\" declared Crosthwaite breezily. \"They’ve just reported that the thing is two fathoms off the bottom. The _Carse o’ Gowrie_ is going to help take the strain.\"  \"Hope it won’t carry away, sir,\" remarked Sefton.  \"Never fear!  Where the patent grapnel grips, it holds.  What water have we?\"  A cast with the lead gave 19 fathoms, the tide having risen 7 feet.  The tidal current was setting south-east a half east, with a velocity of 1-½ knots.  \"Tide’ll be slacking in half an hour,\" said the skipper.  \"The less strain we get the better. Signalman!\"  \"Sir?\"  \"Ask the _Dimpled Lassie_ to report the state of the dynometer.\"  Promptly came the reply that already the strain on the grapnel hawser was 2-½ tons.  \"And the breaking strain is four, sir,\" Sefton reminded his chief.  \"We’ll get it all right,\" reiterated Crosthwaite. \"Never fear.\"  His optimism was justified when forty-five minutes later the grapnel sullenly bobbed above the surface, holding in its tightly-closed jaws the bight of a large submarine electric cable.  \"Let’s hope we’ve hooked the right one,\" muttered the engineer-lieutenant.  \"You atom of despondency!\" exclaimed Stirling.  \"I state a possibility, not a probability, Pills,\" rejoined Boxspanner. \"It’s a three-to-one chance, you know.\"  Already a number of artificers, who had been temporarily detailed for duty on board each of the trawlers, were hard at work in connection with the retrieved cable.  What they were doing in connection must remain a matter of conjecture, but the fact was patent that the success or otherwise of unremitting toil depended upon the next few minutes.  Impatiently the young lieutenant-commander of the _Calder_ awaited a further signal announcing the result of the investigations.  When it came it was highly satisfactory.  \"Thanks be for small mercies!\" ejaculated Crosthwaite fervently. \"Signal M’Kie and tell him to take due precautions in case a ground swell sets in from the east’ard.\"  The cable was one of three that in pre-war time connected the little Norfolk fishing-village of Bacton with the German island of Borkum.  Two more ran from Borkum to Lowestoft, the whole system being partly British and partly German controlled.  Immediately upon the declaration of war the telegraph cables had been severed, both in the neighbourhood of the British coast and in the vicinity of the German island fortress.  To all intents and purposes it seemed as if the cables were nothing more than useless cores of copper encased in gutta-percha, rotting in the ooze on the bed of the North Sea.  Yet in spite of the most stringent precautions on the part of the British Government to prevent a leakage of news, the disconcerting fact remained that, thanks to an efficient and extensive espionage system, information, especially relating to the movements of the Grand Fleet, did reach Germany.  Various illicit means of communication were suspected by the authorities, and drastic, though none the less highly necessary, regulations were put into force that had the effect of reducing the leakage to a minimum.  Simultaneously a campaign was opened against the use of wireless installations.  Undoubtedly wireless played its part in the spies’ work, but its efficacy was doubtful.  It could be \"tapped\"; its source of agency could be located.  However beneficial in times of peace, it was a two-edged weapon in war.  For a long time the British Government failed to unravel the secret, until it was suggested that the submarine cables had been repaired.  And this was precisely what had been done.  The Huns had promptly repaired their end of one of the Bacton-Borkum lines, while a German trawler, disguised as a Dutch fishing-boat, had grappled the severed end just beyond the British three-mile limit.  To the recovered end was fixed a light india-rubber-covered cable.  This would be sufficiently strong to outlast the duration of the war, the scarcity of gutta-percha and the enormous weight of the finished cable being prohibitive.  It was paid out from the trawler with considerable rapidity, the end being buoyed and dropped overboard some miles from the spot where the original cable used to land.  In the inky blackness of a dark winter’s night a boat manned by German agents disguised as British fishermen succeeded in recovering the light cable and taking it ashore. Here it was a brief and simple matter to carry the line to a cottage on the edge of the low cliff, burying the land portion in the sand.  For nearly eighteen months the secret wireless station had been in active operation.  News culled from all the naval bases by trustworthy German agents was surreptitiously communicated to the operators in the little unsuspected Norfolk cottage and thence telegraphed to Borkum.  For the task of recovering the cable the utmost skill, caution, and discretion were necessary.  The vessels detailed for the work were sent from a far-off Scottish port with orders to make no communication with the shore; while to protect them from possible interference the _Calder_ had been detached from the rest of the flotilla to stand by and direct operations.  The _Dimpled Lassie_ was indeed fortunate in finding the cable in a comparatively short space of time, and, what was more to the point, in locating the right one of the three known to be in close proximity. Contrast this performance with that of the cruiser _Huascar_ in the Chilean-Peruvian War. That vessel tried for two days in shallow water to sever the cable at Valparaiso.  The officer in charge had himself assisted to lay that particular cable, but picked up the one communicating with Iquique and severed that by mistake.  The only \"fly in the ointment\", as far as Lieutenant-Commander Crosthwaite was concerned, was the anticipated fact that the _Calder_ would have to dance attendance upon the trawlers for an indefinite period.  Once the mild excitement of grappling for the cable was over, the _Calder_ was in the position of those who \"serve who only stand and wait\". It was a necessary task to \"stand by\", but with vague rumours in the air of naval activity on the part of the Huns, the officers and crew of the destroyer would infinitely have preferred to be in the thick of it, rather than detained within a few miles of the Norfolk and Suffolk coast.  When at length interest in the proceeding had somewhat abated, Sub-lieutenant Sefton went below to make up long arrears of sleep.  He had not turned in many minutes when Doctor Stirling gave him a resounding whack on the back.  \"Wake up, you lazy bounder!\" exclaimed the surgeon.  \"Didn’t you hear ’Action Stations’? We’ve got the whole German fleet coming for us.\"     CHAPTER III--The Stranded Submarine   \"No such luck,\" protested Sefton, until, reading the serious look in the medical officer’s eyes, and now conscious of a commotion on deck as the ship’s company went to action stations, he started up, leapt from his bunk, and hurriedly scrambled into his clothes.  Upon gaining the deck Sefton found that Stirling had exaggerated the facts--he generally did, as a matter of fact.  Just looming through the light haze were half a dozen large grey forms emitting tell-tale columns of smoke; for, combined with the lack of Welsh steam coal and inferior stoking, the Huns generally managed to betray their whereabouts by "]]]
