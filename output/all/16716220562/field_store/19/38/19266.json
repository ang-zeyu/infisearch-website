Yet the novelty of our route, and of our intended mode of operations, had a strong charm for me, and gave me an excitement which I could not otherwise have felt.  14th.--As there were great quantities of ice along the shore to the northward of us, I let the boats take the ground, so that this morning they were high and dry on the mud, the water being a mile or two outside of us, and we as far from the high-water mark.  As the Goose Hunt House (a small hut where one of the Company's servants and some Indians go every spring and autumn to shoot and salt geese,) was at no great distance, I visited it, but found that the people had taken their departure for the Factory--a certain sign that the geese and ducks had gone farther north. Numbers of the Hudsonian godwit (_limosa Hudsonica_) were flying about, apparently intending to breed in the neighbourhood.  The boats floated at a quarter after 10 A.M., and we got under weigh with a fine light breeze from the S.E. The temperature of the air was 62° and the water 40°. There were many pieces of ice floating about, and a great quantity close-packed about half a mile outside. At mid-day we were in latitude 57° 25' 93\" N. After running by Massey's patent log for 10¾ miles north, we were stopped by ice at a few minutes after 1 P.M., when we made fast to a large grounded mass, which protected us from the smaller floating pieces as long as the tide was ebbing; but as soon as the flood made, it required all our exertions to prevent the boats being damaged. We now found the great advantage of some sheet copper that had been nailed on their bows, as it completely protected them from being chafed. At 11 next forenoon, finding our situation rather dangerous, as soon as the tide flowed far enough, we pushed inshore, and beached the boats on a fine smooth surface of mud and gravel. With the exception of a heavy shower of rain at 6 A.M., the weather continued fine all day, but the sky was too cloudy to permit any observations to be made.  On the 16th we advanced only 1½ miles. The temperature of the air 42° and the water 34°. By an azimuth of the sun the variation of the compass, 10° 54' east, was obtained.  As it was only at, or near, high-water that we could make any progress, we crept along shore about four miles during the morning's tide, and in the evening we put into Rupert's Creek, which afforded us good shelter, and also fresh water, of which we were getting rather short. A fresh breeze from the east brought in much ice, which completely blockaded our harbour. The morning of the 18th was very fine, but the easterly wind still continued, and such was the effect produced by it that not a spot of open water was to be seen. The latitude 57° 32' 18\" was observed, and an observation of the sun's azimuth yesterday gave the variation of the compass 9° 56' E. Some partridges (_tetrao saliceti_), ducks, and a flat-billed phalarope (_P. fulicarius_) were shot.  19th.--The ice having become somewhat more open during the night, we left the creek at 4 A.M., and ran 32½ miles before a fine breeze of S.E. wind, through lanes of open water, as nearly as possible in a N.N.E. course. Large unbroken fields, on which numbers of seals were lying, now opposed our further progress. At high-water next morning, we set forward among ice so closely packed, that we were obliged to open a passage by pushing aside the smaller pieces; we thus gained between two and three miles and reached Broad River. We lay here during the remainder of the day, which was too cloudy for a meridian observation; but in the evening an amplitude of the sun gave variation 12° 19' east. The dip of the needle was 84° 46' 4\".  The morning's tide of the 21st advanced us nearly three miles. Our new position was found to be in latitude 58° 9' 51\" N.; the latitude of Broad River must therefore be 58° 7' N. A strong breeze of S.S.W. wind had driven out some of the ice, so that, with the aid of sails and poles, we gained 12 miles more northing in the evening.  From the 22nd to the 24th we continued to creep alongshore, but our progress was very slow, 19 miles being, at the highest estimate, as much as we gained. We were, however, killing ducks of various kinds, and collecting eggs enough to keep us in food. A deer was also shot by Nibitabo on the 22nd, and on the 24th I procured from a high mound of ice, where it was feeding, what appeared to be a Canada nuthatch (_sitta Canadensis_). The skin was preserved, and is with other specimens in the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company's warehouse in London.  On the 25th we lay all day in a small creek, which afforded us a safe harbour.  The wind, which had yesterday blown a strong gale from the N.E., shifted round to W., which gave us some hopes of an opening to seaward. In the evening much ice drove out with the ebb. The latitude of our position by reduction to the meridian was 58° 31' N.  26th.--This morning we were fortunate enough, after a great deal of trouble, to get the boats into comparatively open water, and as the wind was moderate from E.S.E. we threaded our way, through narrow channels and openings, until opposite Cape Churchill. At 3 P.M. we doubled the cape, and to our great joy found an open sea to the north and north west of it.  The whole of the coast between Nelson River and Cape Churchill is low and flat, with not a single rock in situ. There are, however, a number of boulder stones of granite, and debris of limestone, to be seen.  There are numerous lakelets near the shore, the banks of which form the favourite breeding places of the Canada goose, the mallard, pintail, teal, scaup, and long-tailed ducks, great northern diver,[1] and the Arctic tern. The phalaropus hyperboreus is also very numerous--so much so that I could have shot twenty in half-an-hour. The female of this phalarope and of the P. fulicarius is considerably larger, and has much finer markings on its plumage, than the male, the colours being much brighter.  As we sailed along shore to the westward, the land gradually became more high and rocky, and there were many ridges of stones lying off several miles from the beach, among which we had some trouble in threading our way, the navigation being rendered still more difficult by a thick fog.  We arrived at the mouth of Churchill River at 3 A.M. on the 27th, but as the tide was ebbing we could not stem the current, so that we did not reach the Company's Fort, situated on the west bank of the river and about five miles up, until half-past six, when I was most kindly welcomed by my friend Mr. Sinclair, chief trader, the gentleman in charge, who had not expected to see us so early.  My letter of instructions had not yet arrived, so that we took advantage of the delay thus occasioned to have the boats unloaded, some slight repairs effected, and the cargoes examined and dried. I determined on leaving here some tobacco, salt, and one or two other articles that were not absolutely essential, supplying their place with pemmican and flour. Some observations for the dip of the needle gave mean dip 84° 47' 3\". The variation of the compass 12° 29' east, and the latitude of the Establishment 58° 44' 12\" were found, and the mean time of 70 vertical vibrations of the needle in the magnetic meridian was 148\".  The people of the fort were busy killing white whales, great numbers of which come up the river with the flood tide. The mode of taking them is very simple. A boat, having a harpooner both at bow and stern, sails out among the shoal, and being painted white, it does not alarm them; they approach quite close, and are thus easily struck. When harpooned they do not run any great distance in one direction, but dart about much in the way that a trout does when hooked.  On the evening of the 4th July the anxiously expected instructions arrived from Red River, viâ York Factory. The following is a copy of them:--      \"_Red River Settlement_,     \"15th June, 1846.      \"SIR,      \"You are aware that the grand object of the expedition which has     been placed under your direction is to complete the geography of     the northern shore of America, by surveying the only section of     the same that has not yet been traced, namely, the deep bay, as     it is supposed to be, stretching from the western extremity of     the Straits of the Fury and Hecla to the eastern limit of the     discoveries of Messrs. Dease and Simpson.      \"2. For this purpose you will proceed from Churchill with the     two boats, and twelve men that have been selected for this     arduous and important service, losing not a moment, at least on     your outward voyage, in examining such part of the coast as has     already been visited and explored. In a word, you will reach,     with as little loss of time as possible, the interesting scene     of your exclusive labours.      \"3. In prosecuting the survey in question, you will, as a matter     of course, endeavour to ascertain as accurately as circumstances     may permit, without occasioning any serious delay, the latitudes     and longitudes of all the most remarkable points within the     range of your operations, and also the general bearing and     extent of all the intermediate portions of coast, embodying the     whole at the same time in the form of a chart, or rather of the     draft of a chart, from day to day.      \"4. But in addition to this, your principal and essential task,     you will devote as much of your attention as possible to various     subordinate and incidental duties. You will do your utmost,     consistently with the success of your main object, to attend to     botany and geology; to zoology in all its departments; to the     temperature both of the air and of the water; to the conditions     of the atmosphere and the state of the ice; to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39917"],["title","Narrative of an Expedition to the Shores of the Arctic Sea in 1846 and 1847 (#3)"],["body","and     currents; to the soundings as well with respect to bottom as     with respect to depth; to the magnetic dip and the variation of     the compass; to the aurora borealis and the refraction of light.     You will also, to the best of your opportunities, observe the     ethnographical peculiarities of the Esquimaux of the country;     and in the event of your wintering within the Arctic Circle, you     will be careful to notice any characteristic features or     influences of the long night of the high latitudes in question.     These particulars, and such others as may suggest themselves to     you on the spot, you will record fully and precisely in a     journal, to be kept, as far as practicable, from day to day,     collecting at the same time any new, curious, or interesting     specimens, in illustration of any of the foregoing heads.      \"5. In order to provide against the probable necessity of     requiring two seasons for your operations, you will take with     you all the provisions that your boats can carry, with such     shooting, hunting, and fishing tackle as may enable you to     husband your supplies. I need hardly mention medicines and warm     clothing among the necessaries of your voyage, for, in full     reliance on your professional zeal and ability, I place the     health of your people, under Providence, entirely in your hands.      \"6. In the event of wintering in the country, you will cultivate     the most friendly relations with the natives, taking care,     however, to guard against surprise. For this purpose you will     repeatedly and constantly inculcate on your men, collectively     and individually, the absolute necessity of mildness and     firmness, of frankness and circumspection.      \"7. If, in the event of your being unable to accomplish the     whole of your task in one season, you see ground for doubting     whether the resources of the country are competent to maintain     the whole of your people, you will in that case send back a part     of them to Churchill with one of the boats. For the remaining     part of your men you cannot fail to find subsistence, animated     as you and they are by a determination to fulfil your mission at     the cost of danger, fatigue, and privation. Wherever the natives     can live, I can have no fears with respect to you, more     particularly as you will have the advantage of the Esquimaux,     not merely in your actual supplies, but also in the means of     recruiting and renewing them.      \"8. During the winter you will pursue the various objects of the     expedition by making excursions with a due regard, of course, to     safety, on the snow or on the ice; and at the close of your     second season, after having accomplished the whole of your task,     you will return according to your own discretion, either by your     original course or by Back's Great Fish River, keeping     constantly in view, till you reach Churchill or Great Slave     Lake, the general spirit of these your instructions.      \"9. In conclusion, let me assure you that we look confidently to     you for the solution of what may be deemed the final problem in     the geography of the northern hemisphere. The eyes of all who     take an interest in the subject are fixed on the Hudson's Bay     Company; from us the world expects the final settlement of the     question that has occupied the attention of our country for two     hundred years; and your safe and triumphant return, which may     God in His mercy grant, will, I trust, speedily compensate the     Hudson's Bay Company for its repeated sacrifices and its     protracted anxieties.      \"I remain,     \"Sir, &c.      (Signed) \"G. SIMPSON.\"      \"John Rae, Esq.     \"Churchill,     \"Hudson's Bay.\"  The boats were loaded during the night, and at 6 A.M. were sent down to the old stone fort at the mouth of the river, where they were to wait for me a few hours. Besides an abundant supply of ammunition, guns, nets, twines, &c. for our own use, and various articles for presents and to barter with the Esquimaux, we had on board      20 bags pemmican, about 90 lbs. each,      2 ditto grease,    \"   90 lbs.  \"     25 ditto flour, each 1 cwt.      4 gallons of alcohol for fuel;  with a good stock of tea, sugar, and chocolate, but only four gallons of brandy and two gallons of port wine, as I was well aware of the bad effects of spirits in a cold climate. Considering that we were to be absent fifteen or perhaps twenty-seven months, our quantity of provisions (amounting in all to little more than four months' consumption at full allowance) was not very great.

The immature bird has often been described by ornithologists as the female.     CHAPTER II.      Depart from Churchill--A gale--Anchor in Knap's Bay--Land on an     island--Esquimaux graves--Visited by Esquimaux--A large river     running into Knap's Bay--Nevill's Bay--Corbet's Inlet--Rankin's     Inlet--Cape Jalabert--Greenland whales seen--Chesterfield     Inlet--Walruses--Cape Fullerton--Visited by an     Esquimaux--Reefs--Cape Kendall seen--Ice packed against the     shore--Take shelter in an excellent harbour--River     traced--Seals--Gale--Ice driven off--Direction of the tides     reversed--Whale Point--Many whales seen--Again stopped by the     pack--Wager River estuary--Ice drifts--Eddy currents--No second     opening into Wager River seen--Enter Repulse Bay--Interview with     Esquimaux--No intelligence of Sir John Franklin.   Having taken on board Ouligbuck and one of his sons as Esquimaux interpreters, and bid adieu to Mr. Sinclair, who, during our stay, had omitted nothing that could in any way tend to the comfort of the party, we set sail at 11 o'clock on the 5th July with a light air of N.N.E. wind, and stood to the westward across Button's Bay. The weather was fine, and to enliven the scene numbers of white whales were seen sporting about, and sometimes coming within a few yards of the boats. The men were all in excellent health and spirits, there not being a melancholy look nor a desponding word to be seen or heard among them.  At 3.30 P.M. we passed Pauk-a-thau-kis-cow River, and the wind having freshened and shifted round to the S.E. we had run upwards of forty miles before 10 o'clock. The temperature of the air was 49°, and of the water 50°, thus showing that there was little or no ice in the neighbourhood.  The night being fine we continued under sail, the crews being divided into two watches. The land had now become much lower than it was about Churchill, and the coast very flat; so that it was necessary to keep six or eight miles from the land when the tide was out; and even then, although the boats drew only two and a half feet water, there was little enough for them. The bottom was of mud, sand, or shingle, with every here and there a large boulder stone, some of them ten or twelve feet high.  Early on the morning of the 6th three Esquimaux came off in their kayaks, and although we were going at the rate of four miles an hour they easily overtook us. As they were going towards Churchill, I sent a few lines to Mr. Sinclair by them.  Our latitude at noon was 60° 17' 59\" N. Thermometer in air 49°, in water 45°. The total distance run, measured by Massey's log, was ninety-five miles, which agreed very nearly with our latitude, the difference being easily accounted for by the circumstance that the ebb tide runs much stronger to the northward than the flood does in an opposite direction.  In the afternoon there was a strong breeze, which, although fair, was rather too much onshore and raised a heavy sea. At 5 P.M., having run twenty-five miles since noon, we got into shallow water, and although the heads of the boats were immediately turned to seaward, the ebb tide was too quick for us, and we got aground, being ten miles from the main shore. Five miles N.W. of us there was a small but steep island, on the E. side of which there was still a deep snow drift. By a meridian altitude of the moon our latitude was 60° 47' 24\" N.  The following morning we floated at 2 A.M., and with a strong breeze from S.E. stood on our course. The weather looked threatening, and we had not been long out before the wind increased to a gale, and the sea rose in proportion. The boats fully realised the good opinion we had of them, but being so deeply laden the sea broke frequently over them, and kept us continually baling; at last the Magnet shipped a heavy sea, and the steersman, either from losing his presence of mind or from not knowing how to act, allowed the boat to broach to. Fortunately no other sea struck her whilst thus placed, else both she and the crew must inevitably have been lost. I here saw the benefit of the precaution I had taken to have some Orkneymen with me, for it was evident the others (although as good fellows as could possibly be wished) knew nothing about the management of a boat in such weather.  I was loath to lose so fine an opportunity of getting on, but it would have been recklessness to attempt proceeding. We accordingly ran in towards Knap's Bay, which was nearly abreast of us, and were soon anchored in a snug cove under the lee of the largest island in the bay. It was well that we put in here, for the wind in a short time increased to a perfect storm with heavy rain.  On a neighbouring island some miles to the south of us, many Esquimaux tents were seen, but we could not discover if they were inhabited.  Notwithstanding the rain I took my gun and made a tour of the island. It is about two miles long, a quarter of a mile broad, and not exceeding 100 feet in height, being covered with a scanty vegetation, and thickly strewn in many places with fragments of granite.  I met with a great many Esquimaux graves, the bodies being protected from wild animals by"]]]
