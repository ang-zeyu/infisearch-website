Being      condemned to death, \"Asiaticus declined the counsel of his friends      to starve himself, a course which might leave an interval for the      chance of pardon; and after the lofty fashion of the ancient      Romans, bathed, perfumed, and supped magnificently, and then opened      his veins, and let himself bleed to death. Before dying he      inspected the pyre prepared for him in his own gardens, and ordered      it to be removed to another spot, that an umbrageous plantation      which overhung it might not be injured by the flames.\"       As soon as she heard of his death, Messalina took possession of the      villa, and held high revel there with her numerous lovers, with the      most favoured of whom, Silius, she had actually gone through the      religious rites of marriage in the lifetime of the emperor, who was      absent at Ostia. But a conspiracy among the freedmen of the royal      household informed the emperor of what was taking place, and at      last even Claudius was aroused to a sense of her enormities.       \"In her suburban palace, Messalina was abandoning herself to      voluptuous transports. The season was mid-autumn, the vintage was      in full progress; the wine-press was groaning; the ruddy juice was      streaming; women girt with scanty fawnskins danced as drunken      Bacchanals around her: while she herself, with her hair loose and      disordered, brandished the thyrsus in the midst, and Silius by her      side, buskined and crowned with ivy, tossed his head to the      flaunting strains of Silenus and the Satyrs. Vettius, one, it      seems, of the wanton's less fortunate paramours, attended the      ceremony, and climbed in merriment a lofty tree in the garden. When      asked what he saw, he replied, 'an awful storm from Ostia'; and      whether there was actually such an appearance, or whether the words      were spoken at random, they were accepted afterwards as an omen of      the catastrophe which quickly followed.       \"For now in the midst of these wanton orgies the rumour quickly      spread, and swiftly messengers arrived to confirm it, that Claudius      knew it all, that Claudius was on his way to Rome, and was coming      in anger and vengeance. The lovers part: Silius for the forum and      the tribunals; Messalina for the shade of her gardens on the      Pincio, the price of the blood of the murdered Asiaticus.\" Once the      empress attempted to go forth to meet Claudius, taking her children      with her, and accompanied by Vibidia, the eldest of the vestal      virgins, whom she persuaded to intercede for her, but her enemies      prevented her gaining access to her husband; Vibidia was satisfied      for the moment by vague promises of a later hearing; and upon the      arrival of Claudius in Rome, Silius and the other principal lovers      of the empress were put to death. \"Still Messalina hoped. She had      withdrawn again to the gardens of Lucullus, and was there engaged      in composing addresses of supplication to her husband, in which her      pride and long-accustomed insolence still faintly struggled into      her fears. The emperor still paltered with the treason. He had      retired to his palace; he had bathed, anointed, and lain down to      supper; and, warmed with wine and generous cheer, he had actually      despatched a message to the _poor creature_, as he called her,      bidding her come the next day, and plead her cause before him. But      her enemy Narcissus, knowing how easy might be the passage from      compassion to love, glided from the chamber, and boldly ordered a      tribune and some centurions to go and slay his victim. 'Such,' he      said, 'was the emperor's command'; and his word was obeyed without      hesitation. Under the direction of the freedman Euodus, the armed      men sought the outcast in her gardens, where she lay prostrate on      the ground, by the side of her mother Lepida. While their fortunes      flourished, dissensions had existed between the two; but now, in      her last distress, the mother had refused to desert her child, and      only strove to nerve her resolution to a voluntary death. 'Life,'      she urged, 'is over; nought remains but to look for a decent exit      from it.' But the soul of the reprobate was corrupted by her vices;      she retained no sense of honour; she continued to weep and groan as      if hope still existed; when suddenly the doors were burst open, the      tribune and his swordsmen appeared before her, and Euodus assailed      her, dumb-stricken as she lay, with contumelious and brutal      reproaches. Roused at last to the consciousness of her desperate      condition, she took a weapon from one of the men's hands and      pressed it trembling against her throat and bosom. Still she wanted      resolution to give the thrust, and it was by a blow of the      tribune's falchion that the horrid deed was finally accomplished.      The death of Asiaticus was avenged on the very spot; the hot blood      of the wanton smoked on the pavement of his gardens, and stained      with a deeper hue the variegated marbles of Lucullus.\"--_Merivale,      Hist. of the Romans under the Empire._  From the garden of the Pincio a terraced road (beneath which are the long-closed catacombs of St. Felix) leads to the _Villa Medici_, built for Cardinal Ricci da Montepulciano by Annibale Lippi in 1540. Shortly afterwards it passed into the hands of the Medici family, and was greatly enlarged by Cardinal Alessandro de Medici, afterwards Leo XI. In 1801 the Academy for French Art-Students, founded by Louis XIV., was established here. The villa contains a fine collection of casts, open every day except Sunday.  Behind the villa is a beautiful _Garden_ (which can be visited on application to the porter). The terrace, which looks down upon the Villa Borghese, is bordered by ancient sarcophagi, and has a colossal statue of Rome. The garden side of the villa has sometimes been ascribed to Michael Angelo.       \"La plus grande coquetterie de la maison, c'est la façade      postérieure. Elle tient son rang parmi les chefs-d'œuvre de la      Renaissance. On dirait que l'architecte a épuisé une mine de      bas-reliefs grecs et romains pour en tapisser son palais. Le jardin      est de la même époque: il date du temps où l'aristocratie romaine      professait le plus profond dédain pour les fleurs. On n'y voit que      des massifs de verdure, alignés avec un soin scrupuleux. Six      pelouses, entourées de haies à hauteur d'appui, s'étendent devant      la villa et laissent courir la vue jusqu'au mont Soracte, qui ferme      l'horizon. A gauche, quatre fois quatre carrés de gazon s'encadrent      dans de hautes murailles de lauriers, de buis gigantesques et de      chênes verts. Les murailles se rejoignent au-dessus des allées et      les enveloppent d'une ombre fraîche et mystérieuse. A droite, une      terrasse d'une style noble encadre un bois de chênes verts, tordus      et eventrés par le temps. J'y vais quelquefois travailler à      l'ombre; et le merle rivalise avec le rossignol au-dessus de ma      tête, comme un beau chantre de village peut rivaliser avec Mario ou      Roger. Un peu plus loin, une vigne toute rustique s'étend jusqu'à      la porte Pinciana, où Belisaire a mendié, dit-on. Les jardins      petits et grands sont semés de statues, d'Hermes, et de marbres de      toute sorte. L'eau coule dans des sarcophages antiques ou jaillit      dans des vasques de marbre: le marbre et l'eau sont les deux luxes      de Rome.\"--_About, Rome Contemporaine._       \"The grounds of the Villa Medici are laid out in the old fashion of      straight paths, with borders of box, which form hedges of great      height and density, and are shorn and trimmed to the evenness of a      wall of stone, at the top and sides. There are green alleys, with      long vistas, overshadowed by ilex-trees; and at each intersection      of the paths the visitor finds seats of lichen-covered stone to      repose upon, and marble statues that look forlornly at him,      regretful of their lost noses. In the more open portions of the      garden, before the sculptured front of the villa, you see fountains      and flower-beds; and, in their season, a profusion of roses, from      which the genial sun of Italy distils a fragrance, to be scattered      abroad by the no less genial breeze.\"--_Hawthorne._  A second door will admit to the higher terrace of _the Boschetto_; a tiny wood of ancient ilexes, from which a steep flight of steps leads to the \"Belvidere,\" whence there is a beautiful view.       \"They asked the porter for the key of the Bosco, which was given,      and they entered a grove of ilexes, whose gloomy shade effectually      shut out the radiant sunshine that still illuminated the western      sky. They then ascended a long and exceedingly steep flight of      steps, leading up to a high mound covered with ilexes.       \"Here both stood still, side by side, gazing silently on the city,      where dome and bell-tower stood out against a sky of gold; the      desolate Monte Mario and its stone pines rising dark to the right.      Behind, close at hand, were sombre ilex woods, amid which rose here      and there the spire of a cypress or a ruined arch, and on the      highest point, the white Villa Ludovisi; beyond, stretched the      Campagna, girdled by hills melting into light under the evening      sky.\"--_Mademoiselle Mori._  From the door of the Villa Medici is the scene familiar to artists, of a fountain shaded by ilexes, which frame a distant view of St Peter's.       \"Je vois (de la Villa Medici) les quatre cinquièmes de la ville; je      compte les sept collines, je parcours les rues régulières qui      s'étendent entre le cours et la place d'Espagne, je fais le      d'enombrement des palais, des"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39308"],["title","Walks in Rome (#8)"],["body","s, des dômes, et des clochers;      je m'égare dans le Ghetto et dans la Trastévère. Je ne vois pas des      ruines autant que j'en voudrais: elles sont ramassées là-bas, sur      ma gauche, aux environs du Forum. Cependant nous avons tout près de      nous la colonne Antonine et la mausolée d'Adrien. La vue est fermée      agréablement par les pins de la villa Pamphili, qui reunissent      leurs larges parasols et font comme une table à mille pieds pour un      repas de géants. L'horizon fuit à gauche à des distances infinies;      la plaine est nue, onduleuse et bleue comme la mer. Mais si je vous      mettais en présence d'un spectacle si étendu et si divers, en seul      objet attirerait vos regards, un seul frapperait votre attention:      vous n'auriez des yeux que pour Saint Pierre. Son dôme est moitié      dans la ville, moitié dans la ciel. Quand j'ouvre ma fenêtre, vers      cinq heures du matin, je vois Rome noyée dans les brouillards de la      fièvre: seul, le dôme de Saint-Pierre est coloré par la lumière      rose du soleil levant.\"--_About._  The terrace (\"La Passeggiata\") ends at the _Obelisk of the Trinità de' Monti_, erected here in 1822 by Pius VII., who found it near the Church of Sta. Croce in Gerusalemme.       \"When the Ave Maria sounds, it is time to go to the church of      Trinità de' Monti, where French nuns sing; and it is charming to      hear them. I declare to heaven that I am become quite tolerant, and      listen to bad music with edification; but what can I do? The      composition is perfectly ridiculous, the organ-playing even more      absurd: but it is twilight, and the whole of the small bright      church is filled with persons kneeling, lit up by the sinking sun      each time that the door is opened; both the singing nuns have the      sweetest voices in the world, quite tender and touching, more      especially when one of them sings the responses in her melodious      voice, which we are accustomed to hear chaunted by priests in a      loud, harsh, monotonous tone. The impression is very singular;      moreover, it is well known that no one is permitted to see the fair      singers, so this caused me to form a strange resolution. I have      composed something to suit their voices, which I have observed very      minutely, and I mean to send it to them. It will be pleasant to      hear my chaunt performed by persons I never saw, especially as they      must in turn sing it to the 'barbaro Tedescho,' whom they also      never beheld.\"--_Mendelssohn's Letters._       \"In the evenings people go to the Trinità to hear the nuns sing      from the organ-gallery. It sounds like the singing of angels. One      sees in the choir troops of young scholars, moving with slow and      measured steps, with their long white veils, like a flock of      spirits.\"--_Frederika Bremer._  _The Church of the Trinità de' Monti_ was built in 1495 by Charles VIII. of France, at the request of S. Francesco di Paola. At the time of the French revolution it was plundered, but was restored by Louis XVIII. in 1817. It contains several interesting paintings.  In the second chapel on the left is the Descent from the Cross, the masterpiece of _Daniele da Volterra_, declared by Nicholas Poussin to be the third picture in the world, but terribly injured by the French in their attempts to remove it.       \"We might almost fancy ourselves spectators of the mournful      scene,--the Redeemer, while being removed from the cross, gradually      sinking down with all that relaxation of limb and utter      helplessness which belongs to a dead body; the assistants engaged      in their various duties, and thrown into different and contrasted      attitudes, intently occupied with the sacred remains which they so      reverently gaze upon; the mother of the Lord in a swoon amidst her      afflicted companions; the disciple whom he loved standing with      outstretched arms, absorbed in contemplating the mysterious      spectacle. The truth in the representation of the exposed parts of      the body appears to be nature itself. The colouring of the heads      and of the whole picture accords precisely with the subject,      displaying strength rather than delicacy, a harmony, and in short a      degree of skill, of which M. Angelo himself might have been proud,      if the picture had been inscribed with his name. And to this I      believe the author alluded, when he painted his friend with a      looking-glass near it, as if to intimate that he might recognize in      the picture a reflection of himself.\"--_Lanzi._       \"Daniele da Volterra's Descent from the Cross is one of the      celebrated pictures of the world, and has very grand features. The      body is not skilfully sustained; nevertheless the number of strong      men employed about it makes up in sheer muscle for the absence of      skill. Here are four ladders against the cross, stalwart figures      standing, ascending, and descending upon each, so that the space      between the cross and the ground is absolutely alive with      magnificent lines. The Virgin lies on one side, and is like a grand      creature struck down by a sudden death-blow. She has fallen, like      Ananias in Raphael's cartoon, with her head bent backwards, and her      arm under her. The crown of thorns has been taken from the dead      brow, and rests on the end of one of the ladders.\"--_Lady      Eastlake._  The third chapel on the right contains an Assumption of the Virgin, another work of _Daniele da Volterra_. The fifth chapel is adorned with frescoes of his school. The sixth has frescoes of the school of _Perugino_. The frescoes in the right transept are by _F. Zuccaro_ and _Pierino del Vaga_; in that of the Procession of St. Gregory the mausoleum of Hadrian is represented as it appeared in the time of Leo X.  The adjoining _Convent of the Sacré Cœur_ is much frequented as a place of education. The nuns are all persons of rank. When a lady takes the veil, her nearest relations inherit her property, except about 1000_l._, which goes to the convent. The nuns are allowed to retain no personal property, but if they wish still to have the use of their books, they give them to the convent library. They receive visitors every afternoon, and quantities of people go to them from curiosity, on the plea of seeking advice.  From the Trinità the two popular streets--Sistina and Gregoriana--branch off; the former leading in a direct line (though the name changes) to Sta. Maria Maggiore, and thence to St. John Lateran and Sta. Croce in Gerusalemme. The house adjoining the Trinità was that of Nicholas Poussin; that at the angle of the two streets, called the _Tempietto_, was once inhabited by Claude Lorraine. The adjoining house (64 Sistina)--formerly known as Palazzo della Regina di Polonia, from Maria Casimira, Queen of Poland, who resided there for some years--was inhabited by the Zuccari family, and has paintings on the ground-floor by _Federigo Zuccaro_. One of the rooms on the first-floor was adorned with frescoes by modern German artists at the expense of the Prussian consul Bartholdy, viz.:--      The Selling of Joseph: _Overbeck._     Joseph and Potiphar's Wife: _Veit._     Meeting of Joseph and his Brethren: _Cornelius._     The Seven Lean Years: _Overbeck._     Joseph interprets the Dreams in Prison: _Schadow._     The Brethren bring Joseph's Coat to Jacob: _Schadow._     Joseph interprets the Dreams of Pharaoh: _Cornelius._     The Seven Plentiful Years: _Veit._         *       *       *       *       *  On the left of the Piazza del Popolo, the _Via Babuino_ branches off, deriving its name from the mutilated figure on a fountain halfway down. On the right is the Greek _Church of S. Atanasio_, attached to a college founded by Gregory XIII. in 1580.       \"To-day, the feast of the Epiphany, I have witnessed mass according      to the Greek rite. The ceremonies appear to be more stately, more      severe, more significant, and at the same time more popular, than      those of the Latin rite.\"--_Goethe, Romische Briefe._  Behind this street is the _Via Margutta_, almost entirely inhabited by artists and sculptors.       \"The Via Margutta is a street of studios and stables, crossed at      the upper end by a little roofed gallery with a single window, like      a shabby Bridge of Sighs. Horses are continually being washed and      currycombed outside their stable doors; frequent heaps of      _immondeazzajo_ make the air unfragrant; and the perspective is      frequently damaged by rows of linen suspended across the road from      window to window. Unsightly as they are, however, these obstacles      in no wise affect the popularity of the Via Margutta, either as a      residence for the artist, or a lounge for the amateur. Fashionable      patrons leave their carriages at the corner, and pick their way      daintily among the gutters and dust-heaps. A boar-hunt by Vallatti      compensates for an unlucky splash; and a campagna sunset of      Desoulavey glows all the richer for the squalor through which it is      approached.\"--_Barbara's History._  In this street also is situated the _Costume Academy_.       \"Imagine a great barn of a room, with dingy walls half covered with      chalk studies of the figure in all possible attitudes. Opposite the      door is a low platform with revolving top, and beside it an      _écorché_, or plaster figure bereft of skin, so as to exhibit the      muscles. Ranges of benches, raised one above the other, occupy the      remainder of the room; and if you were to look in at about eight      o'clock on a winter's evening, you would find them tenanted by a      multitude of young artists, mostly in their shirt sleeves, with      perhaps three or four ladies, all disposed around the model, who      stands upon the platform in one of the picturesque costumes of      Southern Italy, with a cluster of eight lamps, intensified by a"]]]
