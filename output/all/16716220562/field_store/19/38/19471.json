Neither did she tell them that little Jean, the Verger's son, was one of that heroic band. These sorrows she bore in her own breast, but she never passed near the Cathedral after that terrible night. Sometimes, when a necessary errand took her to that part of the City, she would pause at a distance to look long at the statue of Jeanne d'Arc, standing unharmed in the midst of the destruction about her still lifting her sword to the sky. In all the rain of shells which had fallen upon the City not one had yet touched the statue. Only the tip of the sword had been broken off. It comforted Mother Meraut to see it standing so strangely safe in the midst of such desolation. \"It stands,\" she thought, \"even as her pure spirit stood safe amidst the flames of her martyrdom. But I cannot, like her, pray for my enemies while I burn in the fires they have kindled.\"  There was yet another burden which she carried safely hidden in her heart. She had not heard from her father and mother since the Battle of the Marne. That the Germans had passed through the village where they lived she knew, but what destruction they had wrought she could only guess. It was impossible for her at that time to go to them; so she waited in silence, hoping that some time good news might come. The slow weeks lengthened into months, and at last Father Meraut was strong enough to get about on a crutch like Father Varennes. It was a great day when first he was able to hobble down the steps and out upon the street, leaning on Mother Meraut's arm on one side, and his crutch upon the other, with Pierre and Pierrette marching before him like a guard of honor.  It was now cold weather; winter had set in, and life became more difficult as food grew scarce and there was not enough fuel to heat the houses. School should have begun in October, but school-buildings had not been spared in the bombardment, and it was dangerous to permit children to stay in them. At last, however, a new way was found to cheat the enemy of its prey. Schools were opened in the great champagne cellars of Rheims, and Pierre and Pierrette were among the first scholars enrolled. Every day after that they hastened through the streets before the usual hour of the bombardment, went down into one of the great tunnels cut in chalk, and there, in rooms deep underground, carried on their studies. It was a strange school, but it was safer than their home, even though there was danger in going back and forth in the streets. By spring the children of Rheims had lived so much in cellars that they were as pale as potato-sprouts.  Mother Meraut watched her two with deepening anxiety. Then, one day in the spring, a corner of their own roof was blown off by a shell. No one was hurt, but when a few moments later a second explosion blew a cat through the hole and dropped it into the soup, Mother Meraut's endurance gave way.  It was the last straw! She put the cat out, yowling but unharmed, and silently cleared away the debris. Then, when the bombardment was over, she put on her bonnet and went out. She came back an hour later, to find the Twins sitting, one on each side of their Father, holding his hands, and all three the picture of despair. Mother Meraut stood before them, her eyes flashing, her cheeks burning a deep red, and this is what she said: \"I will not live like this another day. Life in Rheims is no longer possible. I will not stay here to be killed by inches. I have made arrangements to get a little row-boat, and to-morrow morning we will take such things as we can carry and leave this place. Whatever may happen to us elsewhere, it cannot be worse than what is happening here, and it may possibly be better.\"  Her husband and children looked at her in amazement. She did not ask their opinion about the matter, but promptly began the necessary preparations and told them what to do. Clothing was brought to Father Meraut to be packed in compact bundles and tied up with string. Then blankets were made into another bundle; a third held a frying-pan, a coffee-pot, and a kettle, with a few knives, forks, and spoons, while a fourth contained food. The Twins were sent to say good-by to Madame Coudert, and to give her a key to the door, and then all the rest of their household goods were packed away as carefully as time permitted, in the cellar.  Mother Meraut put the Twins to bed early, but she herself remained at work most of the night; yet when morning came and the children woke, she was up and neatly dressed, and had their breakfast ready. She did not linger over their sad departure, nor did she shed a tear as they left the little house which had been their happy home. Instead, she locked the door after them with a snap, put the key in her pocket, and walked down the steps with the grim determination of a soldier going into battle, carrying a big bundle under each arm.    VIII. REFUGEES  The Twins and their Father followed the resolute figure of Mother Meraut down the street, not knowing at all where she was leading them, but with implicit confidence that she knew what she was about. She was carrying the heaviest bundles, and the Twins carried the rest between them, packed in a clothes-basket. On her other arm Pierrette bore her dearly loved Jacqueline. Father Meraut could carry nothing but such small articles as could be put in his pockets, but it was joy enough that he could carry himself, and it was quite wonderful to see how speedily he got over the ground with his crutch.  Not far from their house in the Rue Charly ran the River Vesle, which flows through Rheims, and as the Merauts knew well a man whose business it was to let boats to pleasure parties in summer, the children were not surprised to see their Mother walk down the street toward the little wharf where his boats were kept. He was waiting to receive them, and, drawn up to the water's edge was a red and white row-boat, with the name \"The Ark\" painted upon her prow. Mother Meraut smiled when she saw the name. \"If we only had the animals to go in two by two, we should be just like Noah and his family, shouldn't we?\" she said, as she put the bundles in the stern.  In a few moments they were all seated in the boat, with their few belongings carefully balanced, and Jacqueline safely reposing in Pierrette's lap. The boatman pushed them away from the pier. \"Au revoir,\" called Mother Meraut as the boat slid into the stream. \"We will come back again when the Germans are gone, and in some way I shall have a chance to send your boat to you, I know. Meanwhile we will take good care of it.\"  \"There will be few pleasure-seekers on the Vesle this summer,\" answered the boat-man, \"and the Ark will be safer with you than rotting at the pier, let alone the chance of its being blown up by a shell. I'm glad you've got her, and glad you are going away from Rheims. It will be easy pulling, for you're going down-stream, and about all you'll have to do is to keep her headed right. Au revoir, and good luck.\" He stood on the pier looking after them and waving his hat until they were well out in the middle of the stream.  Father Meraut had the oars, and, as his arms had not been injured, he was able to guide the boat without fatigue, and soon the current had carried them through the City and out into the open country which lay beyond. Mother Meraut sat in the prow, looking back toward the Cathedral she had so loved, until the blackened towers were hidden from view by trees along the riverbank. They had started early in order to be well out of Rheims before the daily bombardment should begin.  Spring was already in the air, and as they drifted along they heard the skylarks singing in the fields. The trees were turning green, and there were blossoms on the apple trees. The wild flowers along the riverbank were already humming with bees, and the whole scene seemed so peaceful and quiet after all they had endured in Rheims, that even the shell-holes left in the fields which had been fought over in the autumn and the crosses marking the graves of fallen soldiers did not sadden them.  Mother Meraut sat for a long time silent, then heaved a deep sigh of relief. \"I feel like Lot's wife looking back upon Sodom and Gomorrah,\" she said. Suddenly her eyes filled with tears and she kissed her finger-tips and blew the kiss toward Rheims. \"Farewell, my beautiful City!\" she cried. \"It is not for your sins we must leave you! And some happy day we shall return.\"  There was a report, and a puff of smoke far away over the City, then the sound of a distant explosion. The daily bombardment had begun!  \"Your friends are firing a farewell salute,\" said Father Meraut.  All the morning they slipped quietly along between greening banks, carried by the current farther and farther down-stream. At noon they drew the boat ashore beneath some willow trees, where they ate their lunch, and then spent an hour in such rest as they had not had for many weary months.  It was then, and not until then, that Father Meraut ventured to ask his wife her plans. \"My dear,\" he said, as he stretched himself out in a sunny spot and put his head in Pierrette's lap, \"I have great confidence in you, and will follow you willingly anywhere, but I should really like to know where we are going.\"  Mother Meraut looked at him in surprise. \"Why, haven't I told you?\" she said \"My mind has been so full of it I can't believe you didn't know that we are going to my father's, if we can get there! You know their village is on a little stream which flows into the Aisne some distance beyond its junction with the Vesle. We could drift down to the place where the two rivers join, and go on from there to the little stream which flows past Fontanelle. Then we could row up-stream to the village.\"  \"It's as plain as day, now you tell it,\" answered her husband, \"and a very good plan, too.\"  \"You see,\" said Mother Meraut, as she packed away the remains of the lunch, \"I haven't heard a word from them"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4091"],["title","The French Twins (#7)"],["body","winter. I don't know whether they are dead or alive. I haven't said anything about it, because you were so ill and there were so many other worries, but this plan has been in my mind all the time. What we shall do when we get to Fontanelle I do not know, but we shall be no worse off than other refugees, and at any rate we shall not be under shell-fire every day.\"  \"If we can't find any place to stay there, why can't we go on and on down the river, until we get clear to the sea,\" said Pierre with enthusiasm.  \"It's just like being gypsies, isn't it?\" added Pierrette.  \"So far as I can see,\" said Mother Meraut, \"we've got to go on and on! Certainly we can't go back.\"  \"No, we can't go back,\" echoed her husband, with a sigh.  All the pleasant afternoon they drifted peacefully along, and nightfall found them in open country. It began to grow colder as darkness came on. \"We shall need all our blankets if we are to sleep in the fields,\" said Mother Meraut at last. \"It's time for supper and bed, anyway. Let's go ashore.\"  \"We'll build a fire on the bank and cook our supper there,\" said her husband.  \"What is there, Mother, that we can cook?\"  \"There are eggs to fry, and potatoes to roast in the ashes,\" she answered, \"and coffee besides.\"  \"I am as hungry as a wolf,\" said Pierrette.  \"I'm as hungry as two wolves,\" said Pierre.  They found a landing-place, and the Ark was drawn ashore. Pierre and Pierrette ran at once to gather sticks and leaves. These they brought to their Father, and soon a cheerful fire flamed red against the shadows. Then the smell of coffee floated out upon the evening air, and the sputter of frying eggs gave further promise to their hungry stomachs.  Before they had finished their supper the stars were winking down at them, and over the brow of a distant hill rose a slender crescent moon. Pierrette saw it first. \"Oh,\" she cried, \"the new moon! And I saw it over my right shoulder, too! We are sure to have wonderful luck this month.\"  Pierre shut his eyes. \"Which way is it?\" he cried. Pierrette turned him carefully about so that he too might see it over his right shoulder, and then, this ceremony completed, they washed the dishes and helped pack the things carefully away in the clothes-basket once more.  They slept that night under the edge of a straw-stack in the meadow near the river, and though they were homeless wanderers without a roof to cover them, they slept well, and awakened next morning to the music of bird-songs instead of to the sound of guns and the whistling of shells.    IX. THE FOREIGN LEGION  Fortunately for our pilgrims the weather remained clear and unusually warm for the season of year, and they were able to continue their journey the following day in comfort. That night they slept in a cowshed, where no cows had been since the Germans passed through so many months before, and on the morning of the third day they reached the large market town which marked the junction of the little river upon which the village of Fontanelle was situated with the Aisne.  Mother Meraut was now upon familiar territory, among the scenes of her childhood. She had often come here with her father when he had brought a load of produce to sell in the town market. Here they disembarked, bought a load of provisions, and once more resumed their journey. Progress from this point on was slower than that of previous days, for now the current was against them. Father and Mother Meraut took turns at the oars, and they had gone some four or five miles up the stream when they came in sight of something quite unfamiliar to Mother Meraut. Stretching across the level meadows beside the river, as far, as the eye could see, were rows and rows of tents. Companies of soldiers in French uniforms were drilling in an open field. Groups of cavalry horses were herded in an enclosure, and everywhere there were the activities of a great military encampment.  \"It's a French training-camp,\" cried Father Meraut, and he waved his cap on the end of an oar and shouted \"Vive la France\" at the top of his lungs. Pierre and Pierrette waved and shouted too, and Mother Meraut, caught by the general excitement, snatched up Jacqueline, who had been reposing in the basket, and frantically waved her. Some soldiers answered their signal, and shouted to them.  Father Meraut looked puzzled. \"That's not French,\" he said; \"I can't understand what they say. But they have on French uniforms! I wonder what regiment it can be. I'm going to find out.\"  \"We're not far from Fontanelle now,\" said Mother Meraut; \"don't you think we'd better go on?\"  \"We can't get there without stopping somewhere to eat, anyway,\" said Father Meraut. \"It's already eleven o'clock, and I'd rather find out about the soldiers than eat.\" So they tied the Ark to a willow tree and went ashore.  In a moment more they were in a city of soldiers, and Father Meraut was making friends with some of the men who were lounging near the cook-house, sniffing the savory smell of soup which issued from it in appetizing gusts. Pierre and Pierrette sniffed too, and even Mother Meraut could not help saying appreciatively, \"That cook knows how to make soup.\" Pierre laid his hand upon his stomach and smacked his lips. \"Pierre,\" said his mother, reprovingly, \"where are your manners, child?\"  At that moment two soldiers were passing--one a tall, thin man, and one much smaller. They paused and laughed, and the tall man laid his hand on his stomach, too, and smacked his lips.  \"Are you hungry, kid?\" he said genially to Pierre. Pierre looked blank.  The short man punched the tall man in the ribs. \"Don't you see he's French,\" he said derisively. \"Did you think you were back home in Illinois? Why don't you try some of your parley-voo on him? You're not getting on with the language; here's your chance for a real Parisian accent.\"  \"Oh, g'wan,\" answered the tall man. \"Try your own French on him! I guess it won't kill him; he looks strong.\"  The short man came nearer to Pierre and shouted at him as if he were deaf. \"Avvy-voo-doo faim?\"  Pierre withdrew a step nearer his mother and Pierrette. \"Je ne comprends pas!\" he said politely. \"Pardon.\"  The tall man took off his cap and rumpled his hair. \"Try it again, Jim,\" he said, \"even if he is scared. They look to me like refugees, and as if a good bowl of soup wouldn't strike their insides amiss, but your French would stampede a herd of buffaloes!\"  \"Try it yourself, then,\" said the short man, grinning.  The tall man sat down on a box at the door of the tent and beckoned to Pierre. \"I say, kid,\" he began, \"avvy-voo-doo-fam--fam?\" He rubbed his stomach in expressive pantomime.  \"Mamma,\" cried poor puzzled Pierre, \"he asks me if I have a wife, and rubs his stomach as if he had a stomach-ache. What does he mean?\"  Mother Meraut came forward, trying hard not to laugh. \"Que voulez-vous, Messieurs?\" she said politely.  The tall man was on his feet instantly with his cap in his hand. \"You see, ma'am,\" he began, \"we're from the States-des Etats-Unis! We've come here to fight le Boche--savez-vows?--combattre le Boche!\" He waved his arms frantically and made a motion as if shooting with a gun.  A smile broke over Mother Meraut's face, and she held out both hands. \"Les Americains!\" she cried joyfully, \"des Etats-Unis, dans l'uniforme de la France! Mais maintenant nous exterminons le Boche!\" She called Pierrette and Pierre to her side. \"These are Americans,\" she explained in French, \"come from the United States of America to fight with us. Shake hands with them.\"  The Twins obeyed shyly, and when their Father rejoined the family a few moments later, their friendship had progressed to such an extent that Pierre was seated on one side of the tall man and Pierrette on the other, and they were all three studying a French phrase-book. The short man, called Jim, was gesticulating wildly, and talking to Mother Meraut, and she, good soul, looked so wise, and said \"Oui\" and \"Non,\" and nodded her head so intelligently to encourage him, that he never suspected that she did not understand one word in ten, and cast triumphant glances at the tall man to see if he was observing his success.  At this moment a French Captain came by. The men sprang to their feet, clicked their heels together, and saluted. Father Meraut stiffened into military position and saluted also. The officer returned the salute, then stopped and spoke to him. \"You are a soldier of France, I see,\" he said. \"Where did you get your wound?\"  \"With Joffre, at the Marne, mon Capitaine,\" answered Father Meraut, proudly. And then he told the Captain of his being brought wounded to the Cathedral in Rheims, of its bombardment and burning, and of his rescue by Pierre and Pierrette.  The Captain turned to the Americans and said to them in English: \"We have here three heroes of France instead of one! These children have lived under constant fire since last September, and they rescued their wounded father from the burning Cathedral of Rheims at the risk of their own lives.\" The Americans saluted Father Meraut, then they saluted Pierre and Pierrette, while Mother Meraut stood by, beaming with pride.  \"We will ask them to dine with us as our guests,\" said the Captain, and, turning to Father Meraut, he spoke again in French. \"This is the Foreign Legion,\" he said. \"It is made up of friends of France, brave men of different countries who came voluntarily to fight with us against the Boche. Here they receive special training under French officers before going to the front. These Americans have only just come. They do not know much French, but they wish you to dine with them.\"  Ah, what a day that was for Pierre and Pierrette! Their story was passed about from one to another, and, instead of being homeless, wandering refugees, they found themselves suddenly treated as distinguished guests, by real soldiers. Pierre swelled with pride, and if he had only been able to speak their language, how glad he would have been to tell the Americans"]]]
