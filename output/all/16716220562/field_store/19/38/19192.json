Schaldach reported in his notes that four-eyed opossums robbed trap lines set for small mammals at Rancho Pano Ayuctle. W. W. Dalquest trapped an individual seven kilometers southwest of La Purisima using the body of an armadillo as bait. The natives of southern Tamaulipas refer to this animal as \"tlacuache cuatrojos.\"  Tamaulipan specimens of _P. o. pallidus_ differ from topotypes and other specimens from the vicinity of the type locality in averaging somewhat paler dorsally and slightly smaller in cranial dimensions when specimens of equal age are compared. They differ also in having a longer terminal area of white on the tail, 53.1 per cent (43.3-62.8) of the length of the tail in 13 specimens from Tamaulipas, and 38.7 (30.9-48.2) per cent in 14 specimens from the vicinity of the type locality of _pallidus_ in Veracruz; specimens from northern Veracruz are intermediate between the two mentioned populations in amount of white on the tail. Baker (1951:210) noted that the specimens from two kilometers west of El Carrizo had \"proportionately longer tails than typical _P. o. pallidus_ from central Veracruz,\" but I do not find this character to be consistent in the more abundant material now available.       _Measurements._--External and cranial measurements of three      adults, a male and female from Rancho Pano Ayuctle and a      male from two kilometers west of El Carrizo, respectively,      are as follows: 577, 580, 568; 294, 288, 290; 46, 43, 43;      40, 42, 37; condylobasal length, ----, 70.1, 69.9; palatal      length, 43.2, 42.3, 41.9; lambdoidal breadth, 23.6, 22.0,      22.7; alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row, 29.5, 28.4,      29.0.       _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 15: 7 km.

Zool.,      39:19, April.       _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Known only from Aserradero      del Infernillo (Goodwin, 1954:3) in southwestern part of      state.       _Marmosa_ has been reported from Tamaulipas only by Goodwin      (1954:3), who examined \"15 rami, and one fragment of      maxillary\" that were found in a cave. Possibly they were      remains from owl pellets.   =Sorex saussurei saussurei= Merriam  Saussure's Shrew       1892. _Sorex saussurei_ Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc.      Washington, 7:173, September 29, type from N slope Sierra      Nevada de Colima, approximately 8000 ft., Jalisco.       _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Known only from Miquihuana.       Jackson (1928:156) reported four specimens from Miquihuana,      which he incorrectly located in Nuevo León.   =Cryptotis parva berlandieri= (Baird)  Least Shrew       1858. _Blarina berlandieri_ Baird, Mammals, _in_ Repts.

Mamm.,      22:413, November 13.       _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Throughout state.  A female taken on July 5, one mile south of Altamira, carried three embryos 5 mm. in crown-rump length. A female from the same locality and another taken on June 6 in the Sierra de Tamaulipas were lactating. Weight of each of six males was 5.0 grams.       _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 9: Sierra de      Tamaulipas, 10 mi. W, 2 mi. S Piedra, 1200 ft., 1; 1 mi. S      Altamira, 8.       Additional records: Matamoros (Baird, 1858:53); 9 km.

Washington, 46:79, April 27, type from      Huachinango, 5000 ft., Puebla.       _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Known only from Aserradero      del Paraiso.  The only report from Tamaulipas of this small shrew is that of Goodwin (1954:3) who listed a cranium and mandible, possibly of the same individual, found on the floor of a cave. Goodwin referred the remains to _pueblensis_ because of the \"noticeably broader and heavier rostrum than in ... _C. parva berlandieri_ from Rancho Tigre.\"   =Cryptotis mexicana madrea= Goodwin  Mexican Small-eared Shrew       1954. _Cryptotis mexicana madrea_ Goodwin, Amer. Mus.      Novit., 1670:1, June 28, type from Rancho del Cielo, 5 mi.      NW Gómez Farías, 3500 ft., Tamaulipas.       _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Known only from the type      locality and vicinity thereof.  This subspecies is known only from two complete specimens, six crania and four rami collected in two different localities--the type locality and Aserradero del Infernillo, only seven kilometers from the type locality. All the specimens were examined and reported by Goodwin (1954:1; 1954:4). The type specimen \"was taken in a low section of an overgrown ditch\" and the other complete specimen was trapped in a stone wall that separated an orchard from a pasture. The six skulls were found in owl pellets.   =Notiosorex crawfordi= (Coues)  Crawford's Desert Shrew       1877. _Sorex (Notiosorex) crawfordi_ Coues, Bull. U. S.      Geol. and Geog. Surv. Territories, 3:651, May 15, type from      near old Fort Bliss, approximately 2 mi. above El Paso, El      Paso Co., Texas.       1895. _Notiosorex crawfordi_, Merriam, N. Amer. Fauna,      10:32, Dec. 31.       _Distribution in Tamaulipas_.--Known only from two      localities in southwestern part of state.  The two specimens examined were collected in July, one in tropical forest and the other in pine-oak forest; each was a lactating female and each weighed 5 grams.  Judging from Merriam's (1895:32) description, the two females differ from the type and three specimens from San Diego, Texas, in having a unicolored tail and in being slightly larger externally. When more abundant material is available the _Notiosorex crawfordi_ of northeastern México probably will be found to represent a new subspecies; for the present I follow Findley (1955:616) in referring Tamaulipan specimens to _N. crawfordi_.       _Measurements._--External measurements of the specimens from      Jaumave and Palmillas, respectively: 90, 90; 28, 31; 11,      11.5; 8, 8. For cranial measurements see Findley (1955:32).       _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 2: Jaumave,      2400 ft., 1; Palmillas, 4400 ft., 1.   =Scalopus inflatus= Jackson  Tamaulipan Mole       1914. _Scalopus inflatus_ Jackson, Proc. Biol. Soc.      Washington, 27:21, February 2, type from Tamaulipas, 45      miles from Brownsville, Texas.       _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Known only from the type      locality.  _Scalopus inflatus_ is known only from the type specimen, which is imperfect and lacks complete data according to Jackson (1914:21). The type locality is in Tamaulipas, 45 miles from Brownsville, Texas, but the exact direction from Brownsville is unknown; probably the locality was on the road between that town and San Fernando, Tamaulipas, which is south-southwest of Brownsville.   =Pteronotus rubiginosus mexicanus= (Miller)  Mustached Bat       1902. _Chilonycteris mexicana_ Miller, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.      Philadelphia, 54:401, September 12, type from San Blas,      Nayarit.       _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Southern part of state in      areas of tropical forest.  Most individuals of this species were taken in mist nets. Northwest of El Encino for example, bats were collected from a net placed in \"a strategic position across a narrow opening\" (Schaldach, fieldnotes) in a cave near the headwaters of the Río Sabinas; along the same river at Rancho Pano Ayuctle some were taken in a net stretched across a little creek (arroyo). In the cave near El Encino the collector (Schaldach) estimated the population of _P. rubiginosus_ at between two and three hundred; at Ojo de Agua this bat was found in the deepest part of a cave in association with _Myotis nigricans_.  Two June-taken females from the Sierra de Tamaulipas were lactating, and weighed 17 and 18 grams.  The generic name _Pteronotus_ is employed instead of _Chilonycteris_ following Burt and Stirton (1961:24-25). The specific name _rubiginosus_ is used in accordance with de la Torre (1955:696). Tamaulipan specimens are assigned to _P. r. mexicana_ because they do not differ from specimens of that subspecies from Nayarit, except that the coloration of Tamaulipan specimens averages slightly darker in both color phases.  Specimens of this subspecies from the Sierra de Tamaulipas, previously recorded by Anderson (1956:349), are the northernmost reported in eastern México.       _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 31: Sierra de      Tamaulipas, 2 mi.

According to field-notes of Schaldach _et al._, individuals of _P. d. fulvus_ appear when it is almost dark (about 6:30 p. m. in December and January), ordinarily fly about 25 feet above the ground, but occasionally are seen at heights of between 60 and 70 feet (near tops of the largest cypress trees). Most bats flew in a straight line for 10 to 20 yards, then zig-zagged, and repeated the same movements. All specimens examined are in the brown color phase.       _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 11: Rancho      Santa Rosa, 25 km. N, 13 km. W Cd.

Specimens from La Mula were obtained in a small cave, which was inhabited also by _Desmodus rotundus_ and _Tadarida brasiliensis_. The specimens from Miquihuana were captured in a mine by a native. Those from four kilometers north of Joya Verde also were taken from a mine. Females obtained in August at La Mula were lactating.  Specimens examined are indistinguishable from _C. mexicana_ from Oaxaca and Jalisco. Baker (1956:172) found no differences between Coahuilan and Tamaulipan specimens. Most Tamaulipan specimens are dark grayish, but some are brownish and some are intermediate between the two colors mentioned. Fourteen adults weighed an average of 16.0 (12-18) grams.       _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 19: 4 km. N      Joya Verde, 4000 ft., 3; La Mula, 13 mi.

Akad.      Wiss., Berlin, p. 381, type from southern México.       _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Throughout state, except      possibly west of the Sierra Madre Oriental.  Specimens from the Sierra de Tamaulipas were taken in mist nets in which _Pteronotus rubiginosus_, _Lasiurus borealis_, or _Centurio senex_ also were captured. The specimen from Rancho Santa Rosa was shot as it flew at a height of six feet.  Tamaulipan specimens of _Mormoops megalophylla_ are here assigned to _M. m. megalophylla_ instead of to _M. m. senicula_ following Villa and Jimenez (1961:503), who regarded _senicula_ as indistinguishable from _megalophylla_.  Weight of four specimens from the Sierra de Tamaulipas averaged 16.2 (15-18) grams.       _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 5: Sierra de      Tamaulipas, 3 mi. S, 16 mi.

Mus., 46:419, December 31.       _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Tropical region of southern      part of state.  Specimens from the Sierra de Tamaulipas were taken in a cave along with _Desmodus rotundus_ and _Tadarida laticaudata_. Specimens from 20 miles north of El Mante were collected from a cave about 50 yards deep. Weights of two females from the Sierra de Tamaulipas were 9 and 12 grams. Tamaulipan specimens examined do not differ from specimens from Nicaragua that were used in comparison.       _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 6: Sierra de      Tamaulipas, 3 mi.

[= Ischnoglossa] nivalis_ Saussure, Revue et Mag.      Zool., Paris, ser. 2, 12:492, November, type from near snow      line of Mt. Orizaba, Veracruz.       1900. _Leptonycteris nivalis_, Miller, Proc. Biol. Soc.      Washington, 13:126, April 6.       _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Probably throughout southern      part of state, but presently known only from one locality.  The specimens herein reported were taken in a cave. They provide the first record of the species from Tamaulipas and are assigned to the subspecies _nivalis_ on the basis of their brownish color and small size in comparison with specimens of _L. n. longala_ from Coahuila (see also description and measurements of _longala_ given by Stains, 1957:356). None of the specimens suggests intergradation in color between _nivalis_ and _longala_, but some are slightly larger than specimens of the former from Veracruz.  Twelve females taken on August 27, 1961, were pregnant. Each carried a single embryo, the embryos averaging 15.7 (12-20) mm. in crown-rump length. The average weight of the 12 females was 26.9 (24.5-30.0) grams; 10 males weighed an average of 24.6 (21-28) grams.       _Measurements._--Average and extremes of ten specimens (5      males and 5 females) are as follows: 78.2 (76-80); 0.0; 16.4      (15-17); 16.7 (16-19); length of forearm, 48.4 (45.2-54.3);      length of third finger, 100.8 (99.2-103.7); greatest length      of skull, 26.8 (25.9-27.6); zygomatic breadth (6 only), 10.9      (10.7-11.1); least interorbital constriction, 4.6 (4.5-4.9);      mastoid breadth, 10.8 (10.5-11.2); length of maxillary      tooth-row, 8.7 (8.4-9.0).       _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 28: all from      6.5 mi.

Washington, 30:116, May 23, type from Papayo, about 25 mi.      NW Acapulco, Guerrero.       _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Known presently only from      Rancho Pano Ayuctle.  The two specimens from Tamaulipas were reported by de la Torre (1954:114) and in eastern México are the northernmost yet reported of the genus.   =Artibeus jamaicensis jamaicensis= Leach  Jamaican Fruit-eating Bat       1821. _Artibeus Jamaicensis_ Leach, Trans. Linn. Soc.      London, 13:75, type from Jamaica.       _Distribution in Tamaulipas._--Tropical region of southern      part of state.  The specimens from northwest of El Encino were shot deep (250 yards) in a cave; specimens of _Myotis nigricans_ were obtained in the same cave. A female taken on May 24 carried a single embryo that was 43 mm. in crown-rump length. Six March-taken females reported by de la Torre (1954:114) had one embryo each that varied from 20 to 38 mm. in length.  _Artibeus jamaicensis_ and _A. lituratus_ are the largest bats known from Tamaulipas. In addition to the differences between the two species pointed out by Lukens and Davis (1957:9), I note, in Tamaulipas at least, that the postorbital constriction is narrower in relation to the condylobasal length in _lituratus_, 24.6 (23.7-26.0) per cent as compared to 27.9 (26.7-29.9) per cent in _jamaicensis_.       _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 19: 10 km.

Two specimens from the Río Sabinas were taken in a mist net placed across the small, crevicelike entrance to a cave. Ten pregnant females taken in late May each contained a single embryo; average crown-rump length of the 10 embryos was 43 (35-55) mm.  Tamaulipan specimens of _lituratus_ do not differ appreciably in color from topotypes except that the facial stripes are narrow and, in three individuals, poorly marked. Lukens and Davis (1957:9) reported that females from Guerrero were paler than the males, but the male examined in this study does not differ in color from the females seen.       _Records of occurrence._--Specimens examined, 15: Rancho      Pano Ayuctle, 6 mi.
