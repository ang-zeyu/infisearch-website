Lowering of sea level would expand the lowlands in the isthmus; rising sea level would restrict them, leaving only the central ridges and many islands in the isthmus, but never forming a seaway between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.  Probably the level of the water table in the coastal lowlands and the gradients of the streams in the lowlands and foothills was closely correlated with fluctuation in sea level. If sea level fluctuated as much as 575 feet in the Pleistocene, changes in the level of the water table must have been of considerable magnitude.  During times of glacial advances the lowlands of the isthmus probably were more extensive and had more semi-arid tropical environments than at present, with patches of rainforest existing in sheltered valleys along the major streams. In the course of bio-climatic fluctuation the semi-arid environments (scrub forest and/or savanna) were continuous at times from the Pacific lowlands across the isthmus to the Gulf lowlands. At those times such typical inhabitants of the semi-arid environments as _Rhinophrynus dorsalis_, _Engystomops pustulosus_, and _Hyla staufferi_ could have made their way across the isthmus. At times of most extensive glaciation, such as the Illinoian, temperatures in the isthmus probably were low enough to permit the growth of pine-oak forest and cloud forest continuously across the central ridges from the Mexican to the Chiapan-Guatemalan highlands. At those times such highland members of the fauna as _Chiropterotriton_, _Pseudoeurycea_, _Magnadigita_, and the _eximia_ group of _Hyla_ could have crossed the isthmus. During Wisconsin time, climate probably fluctuated less than during previous glaciations; probably no montane environments, except cloud forest, were represented in the isthmus during the Wisconsin. Even at this relatively late date such animals as _Lineatriton lineola_, _Anotheca coronata_, and _Phyllomedusa moreleti_ could have crossed the isthmus.  During the interglacial periods, which in the isthmian region were characterized by warmer temperatures, higher sea level and consequently more restricted areas of lowlands, and possibly more rainfall than in the glacial periods, the continuity of pine-oak forest and cloud forest from east to west across the isthmus was interrupted. Probably, too, the semi-arid environments were restricted, and the rainforests were more widespread. At those times animals now inhabiting the rainforests of the Gulf lowlands and those inhabiting the Pacific lowlands of Chiapas and Guatemala could have crossed the isthmus. In this group are species such as _Bolitoglossa occidentalis_, _Eleutherodactylus rhodopis_, _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_, and _Rana palmipes_.  The amount of differentiation in isolated populations of amphibians in southern México and northern Central America gives some idea of relative lengths of time of isolation from related populations. Those populations inhabiting high mountain environments on either side of the isthmus are specifically distinct. Some populations inhabiting cloud forests lower on the mountains are specifically distinct from related populations on the other side of the isthmus; between others there is no recognizable differentiation. Even though many populations are isolated from other populations of the same species in the lowlands of the isthmus, there is no apparent speciation. This indicates that the lowland environments and their inhabitants have been isolated from one another for a shorter time than have the highland environments and their inhabitants.     ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES   For each species of amphibian known to occur in the lowlands of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, localities where one or more specimens were collected are listed, and variation, ecology, and life histories are discussed. A total of 2833 specimens has been examined for the purposes of this study. Individual specimens cited in the text are listed with catalogue numbers and abbreviations of the name of the museum, as follows:       AMNH  American Museum of Natural History      KU    University of Kansas Museum of Natural History      MCZ   Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard College      UIMNH University of Illinois Museum of Natural History      UMMZ  University of Michigan Museum of Zoology      USNM  United States National Museum   =Gymnopis mexicanus mexicanus= Duméril and Bibron       _Oaxaca_: El Barrio (3); Matías Romero; Tehuantepec (2).      _Veracruz_: Cosamaloapan; Cuatotolapam (2).  The two specimens from Cuatotolapam were collected by Ruthven in an area of mixed savanna and forest. The three specimens (USNM 30535-7) listed above from El Barrio were collected by Sumichrast; possibly they came from another locality. The city of Tehuantepec is divided into seven districts called \"barrios.\" The two specimens listed from Tehuantepec (MCZ 1604) merely bear the data \"Tehuantepec, Mexico.\" They may have come from the town, the district, or from anywhere in the isthmus. The specimen from Matías Romero has 109 primary and 67 secondary annuli, a length of 400 mm., and a diameter of 19 mm.; the one from Cosamaloapan has 106 primary and 58 secondary annuli, a length of 397 mm., and a diameter of 19 mm. Data on the other specimens were recorded by Dunn (1942:475).   =Bolitoglossa occidentalis= Taylor       _Oaxaca_: Río Sarabia (2); Ubero. _Veracruz_: La Oaxaqueña;      14 km. E of Suchil.  The specimens from Oaxaca are only tentatively assigned to _occidentalis_. All are immature and lack maxillary teeth. Taylor (1941:147) stated that the maxillary teeth are absent in young _occidentalis_. One from Río Sarabia is a male with a body-length of 29 mm. and a tail-length of 22 mm. The dorsum is reddish brown streaked with dark gray; the venter is dark gray. Two small individuals (one from Sarabia and one from Ubero) have body-lengths of 19 and 21 mm. and tail-lengths of 10.5 and 11 mm. In life they were pale yellowish tan above with a brown triangular mark on the occiput, but with no middorsal stripe. Both were found in the axils of elephant ear plants (_Xanthosoma_).  This species has been noted by Goodnight and Goodnight (1956:146) on the Atlantic lowlands at Palenque, Chiapas, and by Shannon and Werler (1955:362) at several localities in Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz. I have collected it at Vista Hermosa on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental above Tuxtepec in northern Oaxaca. Both _B. occidentalis_ and _B. rufescens_ have been reported from Palenque, Chiapas (Taylor and Smith, 1945:547). Reëxamination of specimens from northern Chiapas and Tabasco is needed to verify the sympatric occurrence of these two similar species.   =Bolitoglossa platydactyla= Tschudi       _Oaxaca_: La Oaxaqueña; Tolosita (2). _Veracruz_: Acayucan;      Cuatotolapam; 25 km. ESE of Jesús Carranza; 14 km. E of      Suchil; 2.7 km. N of Tula.  Known only from the Gulf lowlands in the isthmian region, this species has been taken in a variety of habitats within the humid forest area: under outer leaves of banana plants, under a rock along a stream, under a log in a plowed field, and on a reed in a pond at night. Three adult males have an average snout-vent length of 44 mm. and a tail-length of 41 mm. In life the color of the dorsum varied from orange-yellow to orange-tan, usually being more orange on the tail. The iris was a reddish orange.   =Bolitoglossa veracrucis= Taylor       _Veracruz_: 35 km. SE of Jesús Carranza (21).  This species is known only from the type series collected at night on a limestone cliff by Walter W. Dalquest. If this salamander is restricted to this type of habitat, it should be found in the region of extensive limestone outcroppings in northern Chiapas and southern Tabasco.   =Rhinophrynus dorsalis= Duméril and Bibron       _Oaxaca_: Ixtepec; Limón; Salina Cruz (18); Tehuantepec      (57); Tuxtepec (3). _Veracruz_: Amatitlán (3); Cosamaloapan      (5); Novillero (2); San Lorenzo.  This species inhabits the scrub forests of the Pacific coastal plain and the savannas in southern Veracruz; apparently it does not occur in rainforest. Consequently, its distribution in the isthmus is discontinuous.  PLATE 1  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Savanna about 75 kilometers east of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. Photograph by L. C.

Clasping pair of _Diaglena reticulata_ at the edge of a pond north of Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, on July 6, 1958. × 1.]  Breeding congregations were found after heavy rains at Tehuantepec on July 5, 1956, at Cosamaloapan, Novillero, and Amatitlán on July 26, 1956, and at Salina Cruz on July 6, 1958. The call is a long \"worrp\" made while the male is floating on the surface of the pond. The small heads, small limbs, and greatly inflated bodies cause the calling males to resemble miniature caricature balloons (Pl. 6, fig. 1). Amplexus is inguinal. These toads are notably wary, even when calling. Often the beam of a flashlight or the slightest disturbance of the water will cause the males to stop calling. The body is deflated with one last nauseous note, and the frog sinks beneath the surface of the water and swims away with short slow kicks of the hind feet.   =Bufo canaliferus= Cope       _Oaxaca_: Chivela; Salina Cruz; Santa Efigenia; Tapanatepec      (6); Tehuantepec (10); Zanatepec (4).  This small toad apparently is restricted to the Pacific lowlands from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec eastward to Guatemala. At Zanatepec on July 13, 1956, males were calling from a flooded field bordered by scrub forest. The call is a rather loud nasal racket. Living individuals vary greatly in coloration. Some have yellowish tan flanks and dorsum and an orange middorsal stripe; others have a pale red dorsum, yellow flanks, and a cream middorsal stripe (Pl. 6, fig. 2).   =Bufo coccifer= Cope       _Oaxaca_: Juchitán (5); Tehuantepec.  It is with some degree of hesitancy that these toads are referred to the species _coccifer_. Although these and other specimens from Guerrero and Michoacán display no striking differences from specimens from Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and southeastern Guatemala, the ranges of the populations are separated by a broad hiatus in Chiapas and Guatemala. Possibly this species has utilized the sub-humid corridor through northern Central America (Stuart, 1954) and subsequently disappeared from the corridor in Guatemala and Chiapas. Specimens of a _coccifer_-like toad collected by Stuart in the vicinity of Jacaltenango, Departamento Huehuetenango, Guatemala, are much larger than either the Central American or Mexican specimens of _coccifer_. A final commitment on the systematic status must await a thorough study of this group of toads.  Males of this species were calling from a grassy rain-pool in open scrub forest at the edge of Juchitán on July 6, 1956. The call is a low \"whirrr.\" The calling males were sitting in the shallow water at the edge of pond, where they were hidden by the grass. None was observed in open water, as is characteristic of calling males of _Bufo canaliferus_ and _marmoreus_.   =Bufo marinus= Linnaeus       _Oaxaca_: Agua Caliente; Guichicovi (3); Mixtequilla;      Tolosita (6); Tehuantepec (37); Tuxtepec; Unión Hidalgo.      _Veracruz_: Ciudad Alemán (4); Cosamaloapan; Cuatotolapam      (19); 20 km. SE of Jesús Carranza (4); 38 km. SE of Jesús      Carranza (10); 20 km. NE of Jesús Carranza (4); Novillero.  This large toad is abundant throughout the lowlands of the isthmus. The loud rattling call of males was heard on rainy nights throughout the summer. In March, 1956, several adults were found in a small cave back of a spring at Agua Caliente.   =Bufo marmoreus= Wiegmann       _Oaxaca_: Cerro San Pedro (2); Chivela (5); Escurano (3);      Juchitán; Salina Cruz (101); Santa Lucía (2); 12 km. S of      Santiago Chivela (11); Santo Domingo; Tapanatepec;      Tehuantepec (100); Tequisistlán. _Veracruz_: Alvarado;      Coatzacoalcos.  This toad is abundant on the Pacific lowlands, where it inhabits both open and dense scrub forest. On the Gulf lowlands its distribution seems to be limited to xeric coastal habitats. Aside from the specimens from Alvarado and Coatzacoalcos, it is known in Veracruz only from Boca del Río (Langebartel and Smith, 1959:27).  The similarity in size of _Bufo marmoreus_ and _valliceps_ and their almost completely allopatric ranges suggest that the two species may be in competition at any one locality. Nevertheless, both were calling from a small rocky stream south of Santiago Chivela on July 6, 1956.  On the night of July 6, 1958, an estimated 400 toads of this species made up a breeding congregation near Salina Cruz. The site was a shallow muddy pond about 20 × 40 meters located in an area cleared of scrub forest; the banks of the pond were devoid of vegetation (Pl. 5, fig. 2). Breeding in the same pond were _Rhinophrynus dorsalis_ and _Diaglena reticulata_. The following morning no more than a dozen _Bufo_ were found in the pond, but several individuals were found beneath debris and in small burrows near the pond. On July 7, 1958, large numbers of tadpoles and recently metamorphosed young were in a shallow grassy pool just east of Salina Cruz.  Taylor (1943b:347) referred certain specimens from Tehuantepec to _Bufo perplexus_, a species closely related to _Bufo marmoreus_. Evidence to be presented elsewhere shows that _perplexus_ does not occur in the isthmus.   =Bufo valliceps valliceps= Wiegmann       _Oaxaca_: Guichicovi (2); Matías Romero; 32 km. N of Matías      Romero (2); Nueva Raza; Río Sarabia (3); Santa María      Chimalapa (14); Santiago Chivela; 12 km. S of Santiago      Chivela (5); Santo Domingo (5); Tolosita (7). _Veracruz_:      Acayucan (3); Alvarado; Amatitlán; Ayentes; Cosamaloapan      (3); Cosoleacaque (6); Cuatotolapam (14); Hueyapan; 20 km.      ENE of Jesús Carranza (6); 20 km. S of Jesús Carranza; 25      km. SE of Jesús Carranza (23); 35 km. SE of Jesús Carranza;      60 km. SW of Jesús Carranza (5); La Oaxaqueña (4); Novillero      (4); San Lorenzo (5).  Individuals were found in both wet and dry seasons. In the dry season they were most frequently found in rainforest, whereas in the rainy season breeding congregations were found in savannas as well. This toad occurs throughout the Gulf lowlands and on the Pacific slopes and in the Grijalva Valley of Chiapas and Guatemala, but not on the Pacific lowlands of the isthmus.  I have not been able to recognize individuals referrable to the race _macrocristatus_. Firschein and Smith (1957:219) described _macrocristatus_ from the mountains of eastern Oaxaca and referred to it specimens from the Gulf lowlands of northern Chiapas. None of the present material shows the hypertrophied cranial crests supposedly characteristic of _macroaristatus_, nor do specimens from the isthmus resemble the population in the Grijalva Valley being described by L. C. Stuart, who will discuss the variation in, and the validity of, the named populations of _valliceps_.  Five specimens from San Lorenzo, Veracruz (USNM 123516-20), were identified as _Bufo cristatus_ by Smith (1947:408). Firschein (1950:83) redefined the _cristatus_ group of _Bufo_ and assigned these specimens to _valliceps_.   =Eleutherodactylus alfredi= Boulenger       _Oaxaca_: Tolosita (2). _Veracruz_: 35 km. SE of Jesús      Carranza (6).  These specimens were collected in rainforest. Shreve (1957:247) pointed out the close resemblance between _E. alfredi_ and _E. conspicuus_ from Piedras Negras, Guatemala, and treated them as subspecies. Examination of the specimens from the isthmus, together with seven from central Veracruz and one from Teapa, Tabasco, suggests an even closer relationship. _Eleutherodactylus conspicuus_ was diagnosed by Taylor and Smith (1945:567) as differing from _alfredi_ \"in lacking a tarsal fold, in having shorter hind legs with the tibiotarsal articulation reaching only to the nostril instead of beyond the tip of the snout; the vomerine teeth barely reach the posterior level of the choanae.\" The specimen from Teapa has the vomerine teeth reaching to the posterior edge of the choanae; in the eight specimens from the isthmus the teeth reach the posterior edge of the choanae in two and to the middle of the choanae in six; in seven specimens from central Veracruz the teeth reach the posterior edge of the choanae in two and to the middle in five. The tibiotarsal articulation extends beyond the tip of the snout in the specimen from Teapa and in two from central Veracruz; in three specimens from the isthmus and in one from central Veracruz it extends only to the nostril; in the others it extends to the snout. The tarsal fold is absent in the specimen from Teapa, in three from the isthmus, and in all those from central Veracruz; it is weakly present in the others.  In the light of this evidence there seems to be little justification in recognizing two species or even two subspecies in this group. Consequently, _Eleutherodactylus conspicuus_ Taylor and Smith (1945) is here placed in the synonymy of _Eleutherodactylus alfredi_ Boulenger (1898), a species with a range extending from Cuautlapan and Potrero Viejo in central Veracruz southward and eastward in forested habitats to western El Petén, Guatemala.   =Eleutherodactylus natator= Taylor       _Veracruz_: 35 km. SE of Jesús Carranza (3); 38 km. S of      Jesús Carranza; 55 km. SE of Jesús Carranza.  The snout-vent length is 42.0 mm. in a male and averages 59.5 mm. in three adult females. The tarsal fold is low and extends about half the length of the tarsus; the first and second fingers are subequal in length; the tibiotarsal articulation extends beyond the tip of the snout. The patches of vomerine teeth lie between the posterior margins of the choanae. The throat and belly are immaculate, and the soles of the feet are dark. In the isthmus this species can be distinguished from _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_ by less rugose skin on the dorsum and absence of dark ventral mottling.  The"]]]
