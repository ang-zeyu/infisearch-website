When they reached home, it was already quite dark. Mother Meraut hastened up the steps and unlocked the door, and in less time than it takes to tell it her bonnet was off, the fire was burning, and the omelet was cooking on the stove.  Pierrette set the table. \"I'm going to place father's chair too,\" she said to her mother. \"He is no doubt thinking of us as we are of him, and it will make him stem nearer.\"  Mother Meraut nodded her head without speaking, and wiped her eyes on her apron as she slid the omelet on to a hot plate. Then she seated herself opposite the empty chair and with a steady voice prayed for a blessing upon the food and upon the Armies of France.  When they had finished supper, cleared it away, and put the kitchen in order, Mother Meraut pointed to the clock. \"Voila!\" she cried, \"hours past your bedtime, and here you are still flapping about like two young owls! To bed with you as fast as you can go.\"  \"But, Mother,\" began Pierre.  \"Not a single 'but,'\" answered his Mother, wagging her finger at him. \"Va!\"  The children knew protest was useless, and in a few minutes they were snugly tucked away. Long after they were both sound asleep, their Mother sat with her head bowed upon the table, listening, listening to the distant sound of marching feet. At last, worn out with grief and anxiety, she too undressed, said her rosary, and, after a long look at her sleeping children, blew out the candle and crept into bed beside Pierrette.  Silence and darkness settled down upon the little household, and, for a time at least, their sorrows were forgotten in the blessed oblivion of sleep.    III. THE COMING OF THE GERMANS  When the Twins opened their eyes the next morning, the first thing they saw was the sun shining in at the eastern window of the kitchen, and Mother Meraut bending over the fire. There was a smell of chocolate in the air, and on the table there were rolls and butter. Pierre yawned and rubbed his eyes. Pierrette sat up and tried to think what it was she was so unhappy about; sleep had, for the time being, swept the terrors of the night quite out of her mind. In an instant more the fearful truth rolled over her like a wave, and she sank back upon the pillow with a little moan.  Her Mother heard and understood. She too had waked from sleep to sorrow, but she only cried out cheerfully, \"Bonjour, my sleepy heads! Last night you did not want to go to your beds at all. This morning you wish not to leave them! Hop into your clothes as fast as you can, or we shall be late.\"  \"Late where?\" asked Pierre.  \"To my work at the Cathedral, to be sure,\" answered Mother Meraut promptly. \"Where else? Did you think the Germans would make me sit at home and cry for terror while my work waits? Whoever rules in Rheims, the Cathedral still stands and must be kept clean.\"  It was wonderful how the dismal world brightened to Pierre and Pierrette as they heard their Mother's brave voice. They flew out of bed at once and were dressed in a twinkling.  While they ate their breakfast, Pierre thought of a plan. \"We ought to take a lot of food with us to-day,\" he said to his Mother. \"There's no telling what may happen before night. Maybe we can't get home at all and shall have to sleep in the Cathedral.\"  \"Oh,\" shuddered Pierrette, \"among all those tombs?\"  \"There are worse places where one might sleep,\" said the Mother. \"The dead are less to be feared than the living, and the Cathedral is the safest place in Rheims.\" She brought out a wicker basket and began to pack it with food as she talked. First she put in two pots of jam. \"There,\" said she, \"that's the jam Grandmother made from her gooseberries at the farm.\"  She paused, struck by a new alarm. Her father and mother lived in a tiny village far west of Rheims. What if the Germans should succeed in getting so far as that? What would become of them? She shut her fears in her breast, saying nothing to the children, and went on filling the basket. \"Here is a bit of cheese left from last night. I'll put that in, and a pat of butter,\" she said; \"but we must stop at Madame Coudert's for more bread. You two little pigs have eaten every scrap there was in the house.\"  \"There are eggs left,\" suggested Pierrette.  \"So there are, ma mie,\" said her Mother. \"We will boil them all and take them with us. There's a great deal of nourishment in eggs.\" She flew to get the saucepan, and while the eggs bubbled and boiled on the stove, she and the children set the little kitchen in order and got themselves ready for the street.  It was after nine o'clock when at last Mother Meraut took the basket on her arm and gave Pierrette her knitting to carry, and the three started down the steps.  \"Everything looks just the same as it did yesterday,\" said Pierrette as they walked down the street. \"There's that little raveled-out dog that always barks at Pierre, and there's Madame Coudert's cat asleep on the railing, just as she always is.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mother Meraut, with a sigh, \"the cats and dogs are the same, it is only the people who are different!\"  They entered the shop and exchanged greetings with Madame Coudert. They had bought a long loaf of bread, and Mother Meraut was just opening her purse to pay for it, when suddenly a shot rang out. It was followed by the rattle of falling tiles. Another and another came, and soon there was a perfect rain of shot and shell.  \"It is the Germans knocking at the door of Rheims before they enter,\" remarked Madame Coudert with grim humor. \"I did not expect so much politeness!\"  Mother Meraut did not reply. For once her cheerful tongue found nothing comforting to say. Pierre clung to her arm, and Pierrette put her fingers in her ears and hid her face against her Mother's breast.  For some time the deafening sounds continued. From the window they could see people running for shelter in every direction. A man came dashing down the street; dodging falling tiles as he ran, and burst into Madame Coudert's shop. He had just come from the Rue Colbert and had news to tell. \"The Boches have sent an emissary to the Mayor to demand huge supplies of provisions from the City, and a great sum of money besides,\" he told them, as he gasped for breath. \"They are shelling the champagne cellars and the public buildings of the City to scare us into giving them what they demand. The German Army will soon be here.\"  In a few moments there was a lull in the roar of the guns, and then in the distance another sound was heard. It was a mighty song of triumph as the conquerors came marching into Rheims!  \"There won't be any more shooting for a while anyway,\" said the stranger, who had now recovered his breath. \"They won't shell the City while it's full of their own men. I'm going to see them come in.\"  All Pierre's fears vanished in an instant. \"Come on,\" he cried, wild with excitement; \"let us go too.\"  \"I'll not stir a foot from my shop,\" said Madame Coudert firmly. \"I don't want to see the Germans, and if they want to see me, they can come where I am.\"  But Pierre had not waited for a reply, from her or any one else. He was already running up the street.  \"Catch him, catch him,\" gasped Mother Meraut.  Pierrette dashed after Pierre, and as she could run like the wind, she soon caught up with him and seized him by the skirt of his blouse. \"Stop! stop!\" she screamed. \"Mother doesn't want you to go.\"  But she might as well have tried to argue with a hurricane. Pierre danced up and down with rage, as Pierrette braced herself, and firmly anchored him by his blouse. \"Leggo, leggo!\" he shrieked. \"I'm going, I tell you! I'm not afraid of any Germans alive.\"  Just then, panting and breathless, Mother Meraut arrived upon the scene. While Pierrette held on to his blouse, she attached herself to his left ear. It had a very calming effect upon Pierre. He stopped tugging to get away lest he lose his ear.  \"Foolish boy,\" said his Mother, \"see how much trouble you give me! You shall see the Germans, but you shall not run away from me. If we should get separated, God only knows whether we should ever find each other again.\"  The music had grown louder and louder, and was now very near. \"I'll stay with you, if you'll only go,\" pleaded Pierre, \"but you aren't even moving.\"  \"Come, Pierrette,\" said his Mother, \"take hold of his left arm. I will attend to his right; he might forget again. What he really needs is a bit and bridle!\"  The three moved up the street, Pierre chafing inwardly, but helpless in his Mother's grasp, and at the next crossing the great spectacle burst upon them. A whole regiment of cavalry was passing, singing at the top of their lungs, \"Lieb' Vaterland, macht ruhig sein.\" The sun glistened on their helmets, and the clanking of swords and the jingling of spurs kept time with the swelling chorus. After the cavalry came soldiers on foot--miles of them.  \"Oh,\" murmured Pierrette, clinging to her Mother, \"it's like a river of men!\"  Her Mother did not answer. Pierrette looked up into her face. The tears were streaming down her cheeks, but her head was proudly erect. She looked at the other French people about them. There were tears on many cheeks, but not a head was bowed. Pierre was glaring at the troops and muttering through his teeth: \"Just you wait till I grow up! I'll make you pay for this, you pirates! I'll--\"  \"Hush!\" whispered Pierrette. \"Suppose they should hear you!\"  \"I don't care if they do! I wish they would!\" raged Pierre. \"I'm going--\"  But the German Army was destined not to suffer the consequences of Pierre's wrath. He did not even have a chance to tell Pierrette his plan for their destruction, for at this point his Mother, unable longer to endure the sight, dragged him forcibly from the scene. \"They shall not parade their colors before me,\" she said firmly, \"I will not stand still and look in silence upon my conquerors! If I could but face them with a gun, that would be different!\"  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4091"],["title","The French Twins (#3)"],["body","led the children through a maze of small streets by a roundabout way to the Cathedral, and there they were met at the entrance by the Verger, who gazed at them with sad surprise. \"You've been out in the street during the bombardment,\" he said reproachfully. \"It's just like you, Antoinette.\"  \"Oh, but how was I to know it was coming?\" cried Mother Meraut. \"We left home before it began!\"  \"It would have been just the same if you had known,\" scolded the Verger. \"Germans or devils--it would make no difference to you! You have no fear in you.\"  \"You misjudge me,\" cried Mother Meraut; \"but what good would it do to sit and quake in my own house? There is no safety anywhere, and here at least there is work to do.\"  \"You can go about your work as usual with the noise of guns ringing in your ears and the Germans marching through Rheims?\" exclaimed the Verger.  \"Why not?\" answered Mother Meraut, with spirit. \"I guess our soldiers don't knock off work every time a gun goes off or a few Germans come in sight! It would be a shame if we could not follow their example!\"  \"Antoinette, you are a wonderful woman. I have always said so,\" declared the Verger solemnly. \"You are as brave as a man!\"  \"Pooh!\" said Mother Meraut, mockingly. \"As if the men, bless their hearts, were so much braver than women, anyway! Oh, la! la! the conceit of you!\" She wagged a derisive finger at the Verger, and, calling the children, went to get her scrubbing-pail and brushes.  All day long, while distant guns roared, she went about her daily tasks, keeping one spot of order and cleanliness in the midst of the confusion, disorder, and destruction of the invaded city. The Twins were busy, too; their Mother saw to that. They dusted chairs and placed them in rows; and at noon they found a corner where the light falling through one of the beautiful stained-glass windows made a spot of cheerful color in the gloom, and there they ate part of the lunch which they had packed in the wicker basket. During all the excitement of the morning they had not forgotten the lunch!  When the day's work was done, they ventured out upon the streets in the gathering dusk. They found them full of German soldiers, drinking, swaggering, singing, and they saw many strange and terrifying sights in the havoc wrought by the first bombardment. As they passed the door of Madame Coudert's shop, they peeped in and saw her sitting stolidly behind the counter, knitting.  \"Oh,\" said Pierrette, \"doesn't it seem like a year since we were here this morning?\"  Mother Meraut called out a cheerful greeting to Madame Coudert. \"Still in your place, I see,\" she said.  \"Like the Pyramids,\" came the calm answer; and, cheered by her fortitude, they hurried on their way to the little house in the Rue Charly.  Mother Meraut sighed with relief as she unlocked the door. \"Everything just as we left it,\" she said. \"We at least shall have one more night in our own home.\" Then she drew the children into the shelter of the dear, familiar roof and locked the door from the inside.    IV. THE RETURN OF THE FRENCH  One unhappy day followed upon another for the inhabitants of Rheims. Each night they went to bed in terror; each morning they rose to face new trials and dangers. Yet their spirit did not fail. Each day the roar of guns toward the west grew fainter and more distant, and the people knew with sinking hearts that the Germans had driven the Armies of France farther and farther back toward Paris. Each day the conduct of the conquerors grew more arrogant. \"Our Emperor will soon be in Paris!\" they said.  On the public monuments and in the squares of the City appeared German proclamations printed upon green paper, warning the people of Rheims of terrible punishments which would befall them if they in any way rebelled against the will of the victorious invaders. It was only with great difficulty that Pierre could be dragged by these signs. Each morning as they went to the Cathedral they had to pass several of them, and Pierrette and her Mother soon learned to take precautions against an outburst of rage which might bring down upon his rash head the wrath of the enemy. The eye of the Germans seemed everywhere. One of these posters was fixed to the window of Madame Coudert's shop. On the morning that it first appeared, Pierre in passing made a dash for the gutter, picked up a handful of mud, and threw it squarely into the middle of the poster.  Madame Coudert saw him, and winked solemnly, but did not move. His Mother instantly collared Pierre, and led him up a side street just in time to escape the clutches of a German officer who had seen him a block away, and came on the run after him. When, puffing and blowing, he at last reached the shop there was no one in sight except Madame Coudert behind her counter. The enraged officer pointed out the insult that had been offered his country.  Madame Coudert looked surprised and concerned. She followed the officer to the door, and gazed at the disfigured poster. \"I will clean it at once,\" she said obligingly. She got out soap and a brush immediately, and when she had finished, her work had been so thoroughly done that not a spot of mud was left, but unfortunately the center of the poster was rubbed through and quite illegible, and the rest of it was all streaked and stained! \"Will that do?\" she asked the officer, looking at him with round, innocent eyes and so evident a desire to please that, in spite of an uneasy suspicion, he merely grunted and went his way.  The first time they came into the shop after this episode Madame Coudert gave Pierre a cake with pink frosting on it.  In this way a whole week dragged itself by, and, on the morning of the eighth day after the German entry into Rheims, Mother Meraut and the Twins left home earlier than usual in order to reach the Cathedral before the bombardment, which they had learned daily to expect, should begin. They found Madame Coudert in front of her shop; washing the window. A large corner of the poster was now gone. \"It rained last night,\" she said to Mother Meraut, \"and the green color ran down on my window. I had to wash it, and accidentally I rubbed off a corner of the poster. It can't be very good paper.\" She looked solemnly at Pierre. \"Too bad, isn't it?\" she said, and closed one eye behind her round spectacles.  \"The weather seems to have damaged a good many of them, I notice,\" answered Mother Meraut, with just a suspicion of a smile. \"The weather has been quite pleasant too,--strange!\"  \"Weather--nothing!\" said Pierre, scornfully. \"I'll bet you that--\"  It seemed as if Pierre was always being interrupted at just the most exciting moment of his remarks, but this time he interrupted himself. \"What's that?\" he said, stopping short. Madame Coudert, his Mother, and Pierrette, all stood perfectly still, their eyes wide, their lips parted, listening, listening! They heard cannon-shots, then music--toward the west--coming nearer--nearer.  \"It is--oh, it is the Marseillaise!\" shrieked Pierrette.  Mother Meraut and the Twins ran toward the sound. Now shouts were heard--joyous shouts--from French throats! Never had they heard such a sound! People came tumbling out of their houses, some not fully dressed--but who cared? The French were returning victorious from the battle of the Marne. They were coming again into Rheims, driving the Germans before them! Ah, but when the red trousers actually appeared in the streets the populace went mad with joy! They embraced the soldiers; they marched beside them with tears streaming down their cheeks, singing \"March on! March on!\" as though they would split their throats. Pierre and Pierrette marched and sang with the others, their Mother close beside them.  On and on came the singing, joy-maddened people, right past Madame Coudert's shop, and there, standing on the curb, with a tray in her arms piled high with goodies, was Madame Coudert herself. The green poster was already torn in shreds and lying in the gutter. It even looked as if some one had stamped on it, and above her door waved the tricolor of France! \"Come here,\" she cried to Pierre and Pierrette, \"Quick! Hand these out to the soldiers as long as there's one left!\"  Pierre seized a pink frosted cake, and ran with it to a Captain. Pierrette gave a sugar roll to the first soldier she could reach; other hands helped. Mother Meraut ran into the shop and brought out more cakes. Shop-keepers all along the way followed Madame Coudert's example, and soon people everywhere were bringing offerings of candy, chocolate, and cigars to the soldiers, and the streets suddenly blossomed with blue, white, and red flags. At the corner, near Madame Coudert's shop, Pierre had the joy of seeing the German officer who had tried to catch him surrender to the Captain who had taken the pink cake. Oh, what a moment that was for Pierre! He sprang into the gutter as the German passed and savagely jumped up and down upon the fragments of the green poster! It was a matter for bitter regret to him long after that the German did not seem to notice him.  The whole morning passed in such joy and excitement that it was nearly noon when at last Mother Meraut, beaming with happiness, and accompanied by a radiant Pierre and Pierrette, entered the Cathedral. They were astonished to find it no longer the silent and dim sanctuary to which they were accustomed. The Abbe' was there, and the Verger, looking quite distracted, was directing a group of men in moving the praying-chairs from the western end of the Cathedral, and the space where they had been was already covered with heaps of straw. Under the great choir at the western end there were piles of broken glass. Part of the wonderful rose window had been shattered by a shell, and lay in a million fragments on the stone floor.  Mother Meraut clasped her hands in dismay. \"What does it all mean?\" she demanded of the Verger, as he went tap-tapping by after the workmen. \"What do you wish me to do?\"  \"Gather up every"]]]
