The Rhea is, above all other birds, a most characteristic representative of the Avifauna of the Patagonian subregion. It is true that it ranges far north throughout the campos of Inner Brazil, where the outlying members have become developed into an almost distinct species or subspecies, _Rhea americana macrorhyncha_. But south of the Rio Negro of Patagonia another very distinct type of Rhea, almost subgenerically different, is met with and extends thence to the Straits of Magellan. _Rhea_ has also been lately ascertained to occur on the western side of the Andes in the Chilian province of Tarapaco; so that this fine form of bird-life is diffused nearly over the entire Patagonian subregion, and is well entitled to be termed one of the most characteristic features of the Patagonian Avifauna.  In conclusion, therefore, we may sum up our present knowledge of the Argentine Avifauna somewhat as follows:--  The Argentine Avifauna comprises 434 species of birds, referable to 54 families and genera.  All the twenty Orders of the Neotropical Avifauna have representatives within its boundaries, except the _Opisthocomi_ or Hoatzins, which are restricted to the Amazonian subregion.  The most numerous families of the Argentine Avifauna are, among the Passeres, the Finches with 46 species, the Tyrants with 63 species, and the Wood-hewers with 46 species. Among the remaining Orders, the Diurnal Birds of Prey with 19 species, the Waterfowl with 22 species, the Rails with 13 species, the Snipes with 15 species, and the Tinamous with 8 species, are likewise well represented.  Genera characteristic and proportionately numerous in species in the Argentine Avifauna are _Poospiza_ and _Phrygilus_ among the Finches, _Tænioptera_ and _Cnipolegus_ among the Tyrants, _Synallaxis_ among the Wood-hewers, _Fulica_ among the Rails, and _Nothura_ among the Tinamous. Less numerous in species, but highly characteristic forms of the Argentine Ornis, are _Thinocorus_, _Rhynchotis_, and _Rhea_.  The following ten genera, mostly monotypic, are, so far as we know at present, restricted to the limits of the Argentine Avifauna or its immediate confines:--_Donacospiza_ and _Saltatricula_ (Fringillidæ); _Coryphistera_, _Anumbius_, _Limnornis_, and _Drymornis_ (Dendrocolaptidæ); _Rhinocrypta_, with two species (Pteroptochidæ); _Spiziapteryx_ (Falconidæ); _Chunga_ (Cariamidæ); and _Calodromas_ (Tinamidæ).     ARGENTINE ORNITHOLOGY.   Order I. PASSERES.  Suborder I. _OSCINES._  Fam. I. TURDIDÆ, or THRUSHES.   Eight species of the almost cosmopolitan Thrush-family are known to occur in the Argentine Republic. Of these, five belong to the widely-spread genus _Turdus_, and are closely similar in structure to our European Thrushes. The remaining three are Mock-birds (_Miminæ_)--a group restricted to the New World, and sometimes considered more nearly allied to the Wrens. They are remarkable as splendid songsters. Burmeister includes in his list a fourth species of _Mimus_ (_M. thenca_), as found in the Mendoza district; but there may be some error in this, as _M. thenca_ is only known to us from Chili west of the Andes.   1. TURDUS LEUCOMELAS, Vieill.  (DUSKY THRUSH.)    +Turdus leucomelas+, _Scl. et Salv. Nomencl._ p. 1; _Hudson, P. Z.       S._ 1870, p. 798 (Buenos Ayres); _Durnford, Ibis_, 1877, p. 166       (Buenos Ayres); _White, P. Z. S._ 1882, p. 592 (Misiones and       Corrientes); _Barrows, Bull. Nutt. Orn. Cl._ viii. p. 85       (Concepcion); _Seebohm, Cat. Birds_, v. p. 213. +Turdus       crotopezus+, _Burm. La-Plata Reise_, ii. p. 474 (Mendoza).      _Description._--Above olive-grey, tinged with brown on the head and     neck; beneath pale grey, throat white, more or less striped with     brown; middle of belly and crissum white; under wing-coverts and     inner margins of wing-feathers fulvous; bill yellow; feet hazel:     total length 9·0 inches, wing 4·5, tail 3·7. _Female_ similar.  _Hab._ Eastern South America, from Cayenne to Buenos Ayres.  The Dusky Thrush is widely distributed in South America, and ranges as far south as Buenos Ayres, where it is quite common in the woods along the Plata river. It is a shy forest-bird; a fruit- and insect-eater; abrupt in its motions; runs rapidly on the ground with beak elevated, and at intervals pauses and shakes its tail; pugnacious in temper; strong on the wing, its flight not being over the trees, but masked by their shadows. It can always be easily distinguished, even at a distance, from other species by its peculiar short, metallic chirp--a melodious sound indicating alarm or curiosity, and uttered before flight--in contrast to the harsh screams and chuckling notes of other Thrushes in this district.  Whether it is a fine singer or not within the tropics I am unable to say, its vocal powers having received no attention from the naturalists who have observed it. With us in the temperate climate of Buenos Ayres, where it commences to sing in September, it has the finest song of any bird I know, excepting only _Mimus triurus_. Like the English Song-Thrush, but unlike its near neighbours the Red-bellied Thrush and the Magellanic Thrush, it perches on the summit of a tree to sing. Its song is, however, utterly unlike that of the English bird, which is so fragmentary, and, as Mr. Barrows describes it, made up of \"vocal attitudes and poses.\" The two birds differ also in voice as much as in manner. The strains of the Dusky Thrush are poured forth in a continuous stream, with all the hurry and freedom of the Sky-Lark's song; but though so rapidly uttered, every note is distinct and clear, and the voice singularly sweet and far-reaching. At intervals in the song there recurs a two-syllabled note twice repeated, unlike in sound any other bird-music I have heard, for it is purely metallic, and its joyous bell-like \"_te-ling te-ling_\" always comes like a delightful surprise to the listener, being in strange contrast with the prevailing tone.  The song is altogether a very fine one, its peculiar charm being that it seems to combine two opposite qualities of bird-music, plaintiveness and joyousness, in some indefinable manner.  I have never heard this species sing in a cage or anywhere near a human habitation; and it is probably owing to its recluse habits that its excellent song has not been hitherto noticed. Azara perhaps mistook the song of this species for that of _Turdus rufiventris_, a very inferior vocalist.  The nest is made in the centre of a thick bush or tree six or eight feet above the ground, and is a deep elaborate structure, plastered inside with mud, and lined with soft dry grass. The eggs are four in number, oblong; the ground-colour light blue, abundantly marked with reddish-brown spots.  This Thrush has, I believe, a partial migration in Buenos Ayres. In the autumn and winter I have frequently observed it in localities where it is never seen in summer.   2. TURDUS RUFIVENTRIS, Vieill.  (RED-BELLIED THRUSH.)    +Turdus rufiventris+, _Scl. et Salv. Nomencl._ p. 2; _Burm. La-Plata       Reise_, ii. p. 474; _Hudson, P. Z. S._ 1870, p. 89 (Buenos       Ayres); _Durnford, Ibis_, 1877, p. 167, 1880, p. 417 (Buenos       Ayres); _White, P. Z. S._ 1882, p. 592 (Salta); _Barrows, Bull.       Nutt. Orn. Cl._ viii. p. 85 (Concepcion). +Turdus rufiventer+,       _Seebohm, Cat. B._ v. p. 222.      _Description._--Entire upper parts olive-grey; throat white, striped     with dark brown, the striped portion extending to the chest; rest of     under surface, also under wing-coverts, rufous-red, deepest on the     belly; bill brownish yellow; feet brown: total length 9·0 inches,     wing 4·6, tail 3·6. _Female_ similar.  _Hab._ S.E. Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and La Plata.  The Red-bellied Thrush, distinguished from the species just described by its larger size and the bright rufous colour of its under plumage, is common everywhere in the Plata region, and does not appear to be migratory. It is a noisy, strong-winged, quarrelsome bird, closely resembling the Dusky Thrush in its manners. It inhabits forests, runs on the ground in search of food, and when approached darts away with loud chuckling notes, flying close to the ground. These birds are also often seen pursuing each other through the trees with loud harsh screams.  The song has a faint resemblance to that of the English Song-Thrush, being composed of a variety of notes uttered in the same disconnected manner, with frequent pauses; but it is, both in sweetness and strength, inferior to that of the English bird. As a rule this Thrush sings concealed in a thick bush or tree.  The nest is deep, well made, plastered inside with mud, and concealed in the centre of a large bush or low tree. The eggs are four, pale blue in colour, and thickly spotted with brown.   3. TURDUS MAGELLANICUS, King.  (MAGELLANIC THRUSH.)    +Turdus magellanicus+, _Seebohm, Cat. B._ v. p. 223, pl. xiv. +Turdus       falklandicus+, _Scl. et Salv. Nomencl._ p. 2; _Hudson, P. Z. S._       1872, p. 548 (Rio Negro); _Döring, Exp. al Rio Negro, Zool._ p.       36 (R. Colorado and R. Negro).      _Description._--Head, wings, and tail brownish black; the remaining     portions of upper surface brownish olive; under surface pale     rufous, obscure on the breast; throat white, striped with black;     bill and feet dull yellow: total length 10·5 inches, wing 7·5, tail     4·0. _Female_ similar.  _Hab._ Patagonia and Chili.  This Thrush, which I met with on the Rio Negro of Patagonia, so closely approximates to _T. rufiventris_ in colour, language, and habits, that the casual observer finds it difficult to distinguish one from the other. Its nest and eggs are also precisely like those of its northern representative. The song is, however, much poorer, and reminds one of the first attempts of a young bird. That a member of so melodious a family should have so inferior a song I attribute to the fact that Thrushes (unlike the songsters of other genera) sing only in the warm season and when the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38956"],["title","Argentine Ornithology, Volume 1 (of 2) (#5)"],["body","is calm. In the southern portion of the South-American continent violent winds prevail in summer, so that this southern Thrush sings perhaps less frequently than any other song-bird, and appears to be losing the faculty of song altogether.   4.

B._ vi. p. 347. +Mimus calandria+,       _Burm. La-Plata Reise_, ii. p. 475; _Scl. et Salv. Nomencl._ p.       3; _Hudson, P. Z. S._ 1870, p. 89 (Buenos Ayres); _Durnford,       Ibis_, 1877, p. 167 (Buenos Ayres); _White, P. Z. S._ 1883, p. 37       (Cordova); _Barrows, Bull. Nutt. Orn. Cl._ viii. p. 85       (Concepcion).      _Description._--Above dark grey, faintly mottled with pale grey;     rump tinged with brown; wings nearly black, the feathers edged with     brownish white; tail black, the feathers, except the two middle     ones, broadly tipped with white; under surface dirty white; bill and     legs black; eye olive-green: total length 11·0 inches, wing 4·5,     tail 4·9. _Female_ similar.  _Hab._ Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentine Republic.  Azara has not failed to remark that it would be well to find a more appropriate name for this species, which was absurdly called \"Calandria\" (_i. e._ Sky-Lark) by the early colonists of the Plata. Use is, however, too strong to be easily set aside, and the name is now familiar to everyone in the Argentine Province. Moreover, by a curious irony of fate, the Spanish naturalist himself, by employing this unsuitable name in his 'Apuntamientos,' even while protesting against it, has been the cause of its introduction into scientific nomenclature.  It would be impossible to improve on the account Azara gives of the bird's appearance and manners. The prevailing colour of the plumage is grey, the irides are deep green, the beak black, slender, and curved. The tail is long, jerked and elevated when the bird is at rest, spread open and depressed in flight. The Calandria's movements are measured and dignified, its flight low and never extends far, the bird usually passing from one tree to another in a long graceful curve. It goes alone or with its mate only; feeds chiefly on the ground; does not penetrate into deep forests, nor is it seen on the treeless plains. It frequents the borders of woods and open grounds abounding in isolated shrubs and trees; is fond of coming about houses, and invariably perches itself on the most conspicuous places. It sings chiefly in spring, and its really wonderful vocal powers have made it one of our best-known and most-admired songsters. To sing it usually places itself on the summit of a bush or tree, and occasionally, as if carried away by excitement, it darts upwards three or four yards into the air, and then drops back on to its perch. So varied are its notes, and so frequently suggestive of the language of other species, that the listener finds himself continually asking whether the Calandria is really an original singer or merely a cunning plagiarist, able to steal scraps of fifty different melodies and to blend them in some sort into one complete composition. As a whole the song is in character utterly unlike that of any other bird (birds of the _Mimus_ genus, of course, excepted), for the same notes are never repeated twice in the same order; and though the Calandria has many favourite notes, he is able to vary every one of them a hundred ways. Sometimes the whole song seems to be made up of imitations of other singers, with slight variations--and not of singers only, for now there will be clear flute-like notes, only to be succeeded by others reedy and querulous as the hunger-calls of a young Finch; then there will be pretty flourishes or Thrush-like phrases, and afterwards screams, as of a frightened Swallow hurrying through the sky to announce the approach of a Falcon; or perhaps piteous outcries, as of a chicken in the clutches of a Kite.  Nevertheless Azara says truly that the Calandria does not mock or mimic the songs of other birds; for though the style and intonation of a score of different singers, chatterers, and screamers are reproduced by him, one can never catch a song, or even a portion of a song, of which he is able to say that it is absolutely like that of any other species. This much, however, can be said of the Calandria: he has a passion for endless variety in singing, a capacity for varying his tones to almost any extent, and a facility for catching the notes of other birds, which, in the Virginian Mocking-bird of North, and in the White-banded Mocking-bird of South America, has been developed into that marvellous faculty these two species possess of faithfully imitating the songs of all other birds. The two species I have just named, while mockers of the songs of other birds, also retain their own original music--their \"natural song,\" as an American ornithologist calls it.  The Calandria makes its nest in the middle of a large bush or low thorn-tree standing by itself; it is deep, like the nest of a Thrush in form, built of sticks, thorns, and grass, and lined with thistle-down or some other soft material. The eggs are four or five, pale blue, and thickly marked with reddish-brown spots.  When the nest is approached the parent birds demonstrate their anxiety by uttering loud harsh angry notes.  It is generally believed that the Calandria will not live in captivity. I have, however, seen a few individuals in cages, but they never sang.   7. MIMUS PATACHONICUS (d'Orb. et Lafr.).  (PATAGONIAN MOCKING-BIRD.)    +Mimus patachonicus+, _Scl. et Salv. Nomencl._ p. 3; _Hudson, P. Z.       S._ 1872, p. 538 (Rio Negro); _Durnford, Ibis_, 1877, p. 31       (Chupat); _Döring, Exp. al Rio Negro, Zool._ p. 36 (R. Colorado);       _Sharpe, Cat. B._ vi. p. 352. +Mimus thenca+, _Burm. La-Plata       Reise_, ii. p. 475 (Mendoza)?      _Description._--Above and beneath grey, paler on the under surface,     and tinged with rufous on the belly; throat and mark over the eye     white; wings black, the outer webs of the feathers edged with white     and grey; tail black, tipped with white; bill and feet black; eye     olive-green: total length 9·2 inches, wing 4·2, tail 4·0. _Female_     similar, but smaller in size and lighter in colour.  _Hab._ Northern Patagonia.  The Patagonian Mocking-bird, which I met with during my sojourn on the Rio Negro of Patagonia in 1871, closely resembles the species just described, but is smaller, the plumage is of a darker grey, and the irides are also of a darker green. It is a common bird, resident, lives alone or with its mate, feeds on insects and berries, and in its manner of flight and habits is like _Mimus modulator_. The nest is made in the centre of a bush of thorns and sticks, and lined with dry grass, cow-hair, or other soft material; and the eggs are four in number, bluntly pointed, and thickly marked with dark flesh-coloured spots. When the nest is approached the parent birds come close to the intruder, often perching within a yard of his head, but without uttering any sound, differing in this respect from _M. modulator_.  The song of the Patagonian bird is in character like that of the northern species, the variety of its notes being apparently infinite; there are, however, some differences worth mentioning. The singing of the Patagonian species is perhaps inferior, his voice being less powerful, while his mellow and clear notes are constantly mingled with shrill ones, resembling the cries of some of the Dendrocolaptine birds. While incapable of notes so loud or so harsh as those of the northern bird, or of changes so wild and sudden, he possesses even a greater variety of soft notes. Day after day for many months I have heard them singing, yet never once listened to them for any length of time without hearing some note or phrase I had never heard before. The remarks I have made concerning the Calandria's mocking-faculties also apply to this bird: but though he does not actually repeat the notes and songs of other species, he certainly does mock the notes of individuals of his own species; for it must be borne in mind that no two individuals sing quite alike, and that the same bird constantly introduces new notes into his song, and never repeats his notes in the same order. I have often observed that when a bird, while singing, emits a few of these _new_ notes, he seems surprised and "]]]
