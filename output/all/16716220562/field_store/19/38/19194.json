The disturbed areas bordering the roads were likewise little used and tended to reinforce the effects of the roads as barriers. There were almost pure stands of _Bromus japonicus_ along both roads. No mammal of any kind was taken in traps set where this grass was dominant.  Because seasonal changes in vole density followed the curve for rate of growth of the complex of grasses on the Reservation, and because years in which there was a sparse growth of plants due to dry weather showed a decrease in the density of voles, the relationships between productivity of plants and vole population levels on the two study areas were investigated. In both fields the composition of the plant cover was similar, and the differences were chiefly quantitative. In June, 1951, ten square-meter quadrats were clipped on each of the areas to be studied. The clippings from each were dried in the sun and weighed. From Quarry Field the mean yield amounted to 1513 ± 302 lbs. per acre; while from House Field the yield was 2351 ± 190 lbs. per acre (Table 1). Using experience gained in making these samples, I periodically estimated the relative productivity of the two areas. House Field was from 1.5 to 3 times as productive as Quarry Field during the growing seasons of 1951 and 1952. Although House Field, being more productive, usually supported a larger population of voles than Quarry Field the reverse was true at the time of the clipping (Fig. 5).    TABLE 1.

In June, 1951, the population of voles and cotton rats on Quarry Field was increasing rapidly whereas in House Field that trend was reversed. The trends were reflected by the percentages of immature individuals in the two populations and by the ratios of the June, 1951, densities to the March, 1951, densities (Table 1). Perhaps the density curve was determined in part by factors inherent in the population and, to that extent, was fluctuating independently of the environment (Errington, 1946:153).  The flood in 1951 reduced the population of voles and obscured the normal seasonal trends. Although House Field produced a heavier crop of vegetation, Quarry Field produced a larger crop of rodents, chiefly _Microtus_ and _Sigmodon_. In House Field, however, the ratio of _Sigmodon_ to _Microtus_ was notably higher. Presumably the cotton rats competed with the voles and exerted a depressing effect on their numbers. The intensity of the effect seemed to depend on the abundance of both species. That this depressing effect involved more than direct competition for plant food was suggested by the fact that in House Field, with a heavy crop of vegetation and a seemingly high carrying capacity for both herbivorous rodents, the biomass of voles, and of all rodents combined, were lower than in Quarry Field which had less vegetation and fewer cotton rats. The relationships between voles and cotton rats are discussed further later in this report.  When the centers of activity (Hayne, 1949b) of individual voles were plotted it was seen that there was a shift in the places of high density of voles on the trapping areas. This shift seemed to be related to the advance of the forest edge with such woody plants as _Rhus_ and _Symphoricarpos_ and young trees invading the area. These shifts were clearly shown when the distribution of activity centers on both areas in June, 1951, was compared with the distribution in June, 1952 (Fig. 1). The shift was gradual and the more or less steady progress could be observed by comparing the monthly trapping records. It was perhaps significant that during the summers the centers of activity were less concentrated than during the winter. The shift of voles away from the woods was more nearly evident in winter when the voles were driven into areas of denser ground cover, which provided better shelter.  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Progressive encroachment of woody vegetation onto study areas, and the accompanying shift of the centers of populations of voles. Activity centers of individuals were calculated as described by Hayne (1949b) and are indicated by dots. The cross-hatched areas show places where the vegetation was influenced by the shade of woody plants.]  From 1948 to 1950 and again in 1952 and 1953 I trapped in various habitat types in a mixed prairie near Hays, Kansas. Before the great drought of the thirties, _Microtus ochrogaster_ was the most common species of small mammal in that area. Since 1948, at least, it has been taken only rarely and from a few habitats. No voles have been taken from grazed sites. In a relict area, voles were trapped in a lowland association dominated by big bluestem. Since 1948 only one vole has been trapped in the more extensive hillside association characterized by a mixture of big bluestem, little bluestem and side-oats grama. None was taken in the upland parts of the relict area where buffalo grass and blue grama dominated the association.  In the pastured areas there are nine livestock exclosures established by the Department of Botany of Ft. Hays Kansas State College. These exclosures included many types of habitat found in the mixed prairie. All of these exclosures were trapped and voles were taken in only two of them. An exclosure situated near a pond, on low ground producing a luxuriant growth of big bluestem and western wheat grass, has supported voles in 1948, 1949, 1952 and 1953. An upland exclosure containing only short grasses also supported a few voles in 1953.  An examination of the nature of the various plant associations of the mixed prairie indicates that yield of grasses, amount of debris and basal cover may be critical factors in the distribution of voles. The association to which the voles seemed to belong was the lowland association. Hopkins _et al_ (1952:401; 409) reported the yield of grasses from the lowland to be approximately twice as great as from the hillside and upland in most years. Probably equally important to the voles was the fact that debris accumulation in the lowland was approximately five times as great as in the upland and approximately 2.5 times as great as on the hillside (Hopkins, unpublished data). The unexpected presence of voles in the short grass exclosure was probably due to two factors. In ungrazed short grass, basal cover may reach 90 per cent (Albertson, 1937:545), thus providing excellent cover for voles. Also, the ungrazed exclosure had greater yield and a thicker mat of debris than the grazed short grass surrounding it and was thus a relatively good habitat, although it did not compare favorably with the lowland type.  Samples of the populations of various areas, obtained by snap-trapping, gave further information regarding the types of vegetation preferred by voles. Voles were taken in all ungrazed and unmown grasslands trapped in eastern Kansas, although some of the areas were not used at all seasons of the year nor in years having a low population of _Microtus_. Reithro Field, similar to Quarry Field in its general aspect, had a heavy population of voles in the spring and summer of 1951, a time when voles were generally abundant. On the same area the population of small mammals was sampled in the summer of 1949 and, though occasional sign of voles was seen, not one vole was trapped. Later trapping, in the spring and summer of 1952, also failed to catch any voles and Fitch (1953, _in litt._) caught none in several trapping attempts in 1953. These later times were characterized by a general scarcity of voles. Reithro Field was drier, with less dense vegetation, than the two main study areas and had larger percentages of little bluestem (_Andropogon scoparius_) and side-oats grama (_Bouteloua curtipendula_) and smaller percentages of _Vernonia_, _Verbena_, _Solanum_ and _Solidago_.  Various species of foxtail (_Setaria_) dominated most roadsides in the vicinity of the Reservation. Voles almost always used these strips of grass but never were abundant in them. Voles were taken near the margin of a weedy field, fallow since 1948, but there was none in the middle of the field. Most individuals were confined to the grassy areas around the field and made only occasional forays away from the edge. The dam of a small pond on the Reservation and low ground near the water were used by _Microtus_ at all times. In the summer of 1949 no voles were taken anywhere on the Reservation but their runways were more abundant around the pond than in the other places examined. Of all the areas studied in the summer of 1949, only the pond area had been protected from grazing in previous years. _Polygonum coccineum_ was the most prominent plant in the pond edge association. A few voles were trapped in large openings in the woods, where a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39396"],["title","A Population Study of the Prairie Vole (Microtus ochrogaster) in Northeastern (#3)"],["body","vegetation remained and where voles seemingly lived in nearly isolated groups.  Voles were rarely taken in grazed or mown grassland or in fields of alfalfa, stubble or row crops. The critical factor in these cases seemed to be the absence of debris or other ground cover under which runways and nests could be concealed satisfactorily. Woods, rocky outcroppings and bare ground were not used regularly by voles. Fitch (1953, _in litt._) has taken several _Microtus_ in reptile traps set along a rocky ledge in woods but most of these voles were subadult males and seemed to be transients. Fields in the early stages of succession also failed to support a population of voles. Such areas on the Reservation were characterized by giant ragweed, horse weed, thistles and other coarse weeds. Basal cover was low and debris scanty. Not until an understory of grasses was established did a population of voles appear on such areas. The coarse weeds seemed to provide neither food nor cover adequate for the needs of the voles.  An analysis of trapping success at each station in House Field further clarified habitat preferences. The tendency of voles to avoid woody vegetation was again demonstrated. Not only was the population concentrated on that part of the study plot farthest from the forest edge but, as a general rule, voles tended to avoid single trees or clumps of shrubby plants wherever these occurred on the area. As an example, trap number 18 never caught more than one per cent of the monthly catch and in many trapping periods caught nothing. This trap was under a wild plum tree. Adjacent traps often were entered; the general area was the most heavily populated part of the study plot. Only under the plum tree was there a relatively unused portion.  Traps number 29 and 30, in the shade of a large honey locust tree, also caught but few voles. Trap number 30 was only six feet from the base of the tree and caught but one vole throughout the study period. These two traps caught more _Peromyscus leucopus_ than any other pair, however, and both of them also caught pine voles (_M. pinetorum_). The area shaded by this tree permitted an extension of parts of the forest edge fauna into the grassland.  In spite of the marked general tendency to avoid woody plants, some voles made their runways around the roots of blackberry bushes, sumac and wild plum trees. Some nests were found under larger roots, as if placed there for protection. More vegetation was found under the woody plants which the voles chose to use for shelter than under those which they avoided. It seemed probable that the actual condition avoided by voles was the bareness of the ground (a result of the shade cast by the woody plants) rather than the woody plants themselves.  Running diagonally across the eastern half of the trapping plot in House Field there was a terracelike ridge of soil. On each side of this ridge there was a slight depression. Observations of the study plot in the growing season showed this strip to produce the most luxuriant vegetation of any part of the plot. Clip-quadrat studies confirmed this observation and showed the bluegrass understory to be especially heavy. This strip included the areas trapped by traps numbered 4, 5, 17, 18, 22, 23 and 37. With the exception of trap number 18, discussed above, these traps consistently made more captures than traps set in other parts of the plot. In winter, these traps also caught more harvest mice (_Reithrodontomys megalotis_) than any other comparable group of traps.  Although the amount of growing tissue of plants probably is at least as important to voles as the total amount of vegetation, some correlation seemed to exist between the density of grassy vegetation and the density of populations of voles. A mixed stand of grasses, with an obvious weedy component, can support a larger population of voles than can either a nearly pure stand of grass or the typical early seral stages dominated by weeds. Probably the more or less continual supply of young plants provided preferred food easily available to voles. A more homogeneous vegetation would tend to pass through the young and tender stage as a unit, thus causing a feast to be followed by a relative famine.     POPULATION STRUCTURE   During the period of study the percentage of males in most of my samples was less than 50 per cent (Fig. 2). Only once, in June, 1952, did the mean percentage of males in samples from three areas (House Field, Quarry Field, Fitch traps) exceed that level and then it was only 50.1 per cent. On several occasions, however, the percentage of males in a sample from a single area was slightly above 50 per cent. The highest percentage of males recorded was 56.69 per cent, in a sample taken from the Quarry Field population in June, 1952. In the samples taken in April, 1952, the mean percentage of males was 39.67 per cent, the lowest mean recorded. The low point for one sample was 28.02 per cent in August, 1952, from Quarry Field. The mean percentage of males in all samples taken was 45.02 ± 2.72 per cent. Percentages observed would occur in random samples taken from a population with 50 per cent males less than one per cent of the time. Exactly 50 per cent of the young in the 65 litters examined were classified as males but the sample was small and the sexing of newborn individuals was difficult.  [Illustration: FIG. 2. Graphs of population structure showing the monthly changes in the mean percentages of juveniles, subadults, adults and males in samples from the three study areas.]  The extent to which sex ratios in samples were affected by trapping procedure was not determined. A possibility considered was that the greater wandering tendency of males (Blair, 1940:154; Hamilton, 1937c:261; Townsend, 1935:98) impaired the formation of trap habits (Chitty and Kempson, 1949:536) on their part and thus unbalanced the sex ratios of the samples. If this were the explanation, the apparent sex ratio on larger areas would more nearly approximate the true ratio, and the frequency of capture of females would exceed that of males. The evidence is somewhat equivocal. In the populations described here the mean number of captures per individual per month was 2.31 for females, which was significantly greater (at the one per cent level) than the 2.20 captures per individual per month which was the mean number for males. This difference supports the idea that differences in habits between the sexes result in distorted sex ratios in samples obtained by live-trapping. Mean percentages of males did not, however, differ significantly between the House Field-Quarry Field samples and the samples from the Fitch trapping area, nearly five times as large.  Three age classes, juvenal, subadult and adult, were separated on the basis of condition of pelage. The percentage of adults in populations varied seasonally (Fig. 2). January, February and March were the months when the adult fraction of the population was highest and October and November were low points, with May and June showing percentages almost as low. The only marked variation in this seasonal pattern occurred in July and August, 1952, when the percentage of adults rose sharply. This was due to a depression in the reproductive rate during the dry summer of 1952, which is discussed later in this report. Juveniles made up only a small fraction of the population from December through March and a relatively large fraction in the October-November and May-June periods (Fig. 2). Again, July and August of 1952 were exceptions to the pattern as the percentages of juveniles in these months fell to midwinter levels. As expected, the curve of the percentages of subadults in the population followed that of the juveniles and preceded that of the adults. The mean percentages for the thirty month period for which data were available were: adults, 77.72 ± 4.48 per cent; subadults, 14.06 ± 3.14 per cent; and juveniles, 8.22 ± 2.62 per cent. Seasonal and yearly changes in the population structure occurred, with notable variation in the ratio of breeding females to the entire population, as discussed in this report under the heading of reproduction.  Since some of the juveniles did not move enough to be readily trapped, the real percentage of juveniles in the population was probably far greater than that shown by trapping data. I tried, therefore, to estimate the number of juveniles on the study plot each month by multiplying the number of lactating females by the mean litter size. As expected, the results were consistently higher than the estimate based on trapping data. The discrepancy was largest in April, May, June and October. During the winter there was no important difference between the two estimates. Even when the discrepancy was greatest, the estimated weight of the juveniles missed by trapping was not large enough to modify the picture of habitat utilization in any important way. I chose, therefore, to count only those juveniles actually trapped. Although probably consistently too low, such a figure seemed more reliable than an estimate made on any other basis.  [Illustration: FIG. 3. Percentages of individuals captured each month surviving in subsequent months. The graph shows differential survival according to time of birth. Individuals born in autumn seem to have a longer life expectancy. The numbers on the lines refer to months of first capture.]  A study of the age groups in each month's population revealed a differential survival based on the season of birth. Blair (1948:405) found that chances of survival in _Microtus pennsylvanicus_ were approximately equal throughout the year. In the present populations of _M. ochrogaster_, however, voles born in October, November, December and January tended to live longer than those born in other months (Fig. 3). Presumably these animals, born in autumn and early winter, were more vigorous than their older competitors and were therefore better able to survive"]]]
