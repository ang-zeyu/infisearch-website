English born and bred, he had gained a degree at Cambridge, and, failing to turn it to any good account, had been sent to New Zealand by his disappointed father.  In the Dominion he found that he was \"up against something\" in which an ornate classical education did not count. Down on his luck, he tried for a clerical post in a Wellington lawyer's office.  \"Any qualifications?\" enquired the lawyer.  \"Er--well, I'm considered good at Greek Iambics and Latin Prose, don't you know.\"  \"'Fraid you've come to the wrong shop,\" rejoined the man of law bluntly. \"This is a live country, not a dead one. Good morning!\"  So Fortescue drifted up-country and found employment on a farm. It was hard work. The polished 'Varsity man, who hardly knew how to use a saw or to drive a nail in straight, found it particularly so. He had grit. He got on well with his fellow farm hands, who promptly dubbed him \"Fortyscrews\", a name that was eventually cut down to \"Screws\". He accepted the nickname cheerfully, stuck to his job, and in five years saved enough to start sheep-farming on his own account.  Then came the war. Fortescue promptly \"sold out\" and enlisted. At Gallipoli he acquitted himself manfully, was mentioned for gallantry in an affair at Quinn's Post, and was brought back to Alexandria in a hospital ship, with a wound sufficiently dangerous to smash many a man up completely.  Given the chance of being sent either to England or to New Zealand, he chose the latter alternative. In six months he was himself again. Re-enlisting, he was offered a staff job at Featherston, but declined it, preferring to see more fun at the Front. For the second time Trevor Fortescue had marched over The Summit on the long trail that ended within sight and sound of hostile guns.  Dusty, tired, footsore, but in high spirits, the Thirty-somethingth marched into camp at Trentham. Their stay was but a short one, for three days later the reinforcement embarked at Wellington on Transport 99 for England--and France.     CHAPTER IV  The Interrupted Concert   Transport 99, otherwise the S.S. _Awarua_, was a single-screw vessel of 8000 tons. Originally a combined passenger and cargo boat, she had been ruthlessly converted into a troop-conveying ship, and the internal rearrangements were not by any means suitable for her new rôle. Nevertheless, after the first few days, when many of the men were prostrate with sea-sickness, the troops soon accustomed themselves to their new conditions, and settled down with the fixed determination to make the voyage a sort of maritime picnic.  \"Say, Quarter,\" began Fortescue, addressing the Quartermaster-sergeant, \"how about a sing-song on the mess deck this evening? Most of the boys have found their sea-legs, and there's no lack of talent.\"  \"Good idea!\" replied the Q.M.S. \"We'll form ourselves into an entertainment committee. Let me see: there's Sergeant Thomson, he's a bit of a vocalist.\"  \"Unfortunately he shot his false teeth over the side last night,\" reported Malcolm. \"He was so jolly bad that he never realized his loss till this morning. He's out of it, I fancy.\"  \"We'll put him down anyway,\" declared Fortescue. \"There's M'Kie and Macdonald: they'll open with a duet on the bagpipes.\"  Other names were submitted and approved, not-withstanding the fact that their owners were not consulted on the matter.  \"How about the officers?\" enquired Selwyn. \"They are to be invited, I suppose?\"  \"Rather,\" replied Fortescue. \"By the way, what has Lieutenant Nicholson been doing to get his left optic in a sling? He wasn't looking skywards out of one of the ports when Thomson jettisoned his ivories?\"  \"Dunno,\" replied the M. S. \"He was all right when he went the rounds last night.\"  \"I know,\" chipped in another N.C.O. \"It was the Padre.\"  \"The Padre!\" exclaimed half a dozen voices. \"Our Padre been scrapping?\"  \"Hardly!\" was the reply. \"He shares a two-bunk berth with the Lieutenant. Padre has, or had, the upper bunk, and he tops the scale at sixteen stone. I don't insinuate, mind you, that any of the fellows tampered with the ironwork, but all the same the bunk collapsed, and our Padre subsided heavily upon poor little Nicholson.\"  \"We'll get the company poet to write up a special stanza and recite it at the concert,\" declared Fortescue. \"Sort of object lesson on the way our Padre tackles sin.\"  The men, remembering that the Lieutenant's initials were S.I.N., laughed uproariously. These impromptu concerts gave them poetic licence to joke at the expense of their officers. The latter, too, were quite used to that sort of thing. In fact they enjoyed it. Even the popular Padre found these entertainments a welcome antidote to the dull business of censoring letters.  The concert--as far as it went--was a huge success. According to _The Deep Sea Roll_, the Thirty-somethingth's magazine, the opening items and the honorary reporter's notes were as follows:--  \"A duet by the brothers Mac. I thought they would never finish, due mainly to Macdonald, who had his Scotch blood up and his bagpipes in good wind.\"  \"Sergeant Thomson next stepped into the ring and gave 'Thora' a slap up. It was a pity he lost his teeth, but, thank goodness, he has not lost his voice.\"  \"Tiny Anderson's voice was like his size--tremendous. 'Asleep in the Deep' was his song. I thought he _was_ asleep at one part of it.\"  There was no lack of enthusiasm on the part of the audience. The men, packed like sardines in a barrel, filled the mess-deck almost to suffocation, their boisterous applause increasing in volume as item succeeded item in quick succession.  \"Item seven--Cornet Competition,\" announced Sergeant Fortescue. \"Sisters Howard and O'Dowd have kindly consented to act as judges.\"  Prolonged sounds of cheering greeted the two Red Cross nurses as they stepped upon the platform with marked timidity. They would perhaps--and did--unhesitatingly and calmly assist the medical officers in their work of mercy and within range of hostile shells, but their present task was an ordeal.  Four strapping young fellows, each armed with a highly-polished cornet, appeared and stood facing their critical audience, receiving their caustic comments with a studied indifference.  \"Rifleman Gilway.\"  Rifleman Gilway advanced two paces, lifted the instrument to his lips, and distended his cheeks. Beyond an eerie gurgle (\"the last gasp of a dying flounder\", according to the above-quoted honorary reporter) not a sound came from the cornet. The audience, rocking with laughter, threw shouts of encouragement and advice to the would-be musician, but all in vain. Rifleman Gilway's eyes were riveted upon the half of a cut, juicy lemon displayed within six inches of his face by a waggish subaltern. The sight of the acid fruit effectually prevented the man getting a single note out of the instrument. He puffed and blew like a grampus, the tears ran down his distended cheeks, and the perspiration oozed from his forehead, till in disgust he retired from the contest.  Cornet No. 2 shared the same fate, after a gallant struggle. By this time the audience was almost silent. The men could laugh no longer. They were almost on the verge of hysterical tears of excessive merriment.  The third competitor withdrew without an effort, but the fourth was something of a strategist. He used his music-card as a screen to shut out the sight of the tantalizing lemon. By so doing he had to lean forward slightly. His cheeks were bulging, but again silence--mysterious silence.  Compared with Rifleman Gilway's efforts those Of Corporal Jephson were simply terrific. His whole frame shook under the tremendous force of lung power. The doctor began to shift uneasily in his chair, anticipating a case of apoplexy. Jephson's face gradually changed in colour fro light bronze to a deep purple. Something had to go----  Something did! From the interior of the instrument a wad of paper was ejected with the velocity of a stone from a catapult. In its wake followed, a compact mass of viscous substance. Both struck the waggish subaltern full in the face, and then the nature of the \"main charge\" became apparent. It was treacle. A practical joker had primed Jephson's cornet with the sticky stuff, plugging it with a wad. Amidst renewed outbursts of cheering the subaltern retired for repairs and renewals, while the lady judges were fortunately spared the task of bestowing the palm upon the cornet champion of the Thirty-somethingths.  More songs followed, then a series of recitations bearing upon incidents and characters on board Transport No. 99. Many of the references were pointedly personal; the victims enjoyed them as much as anyone, for it is difficult to raise a New Zealander's \"dander\" by means of a practical joke. And when the reciter commenced a string of verses portraying the catastrophe in the cabin shared by Lieutenant Nicholson and the Padre, the former's \"Hear, hear!\" and the latter's deep bass laugh were heard above the roars of hilarity.  The composer of the verses had turned the accident into a work of intent on the Padre's part, representing the latter combating the evil influence of sin. The reciter began with slight hesitation; then, finding that he was receiving unstinted approval, he warmed up to his task.    \"Sin turned in, and soon was heard the music of his snore,   And then the Padre set to work as none had worked before.   He got a large belaying-pin, he got the vessel's lead,   And everything that weighed at all he piled upon the bed.   He took the screws out, one by one, that held the fixing frail,   Till all that stood 'twixt him and Sin was but a single nail.   Then with a fierce look in his eye, as one who thirsts for blood,   He hurled his weight upon the bunk--there came a sickening thud----\"  Crash!  The old _Awarua_ shook under the terrific impact of an unseen force, listed to starboard, and then slowly recovered, to heel to port. Simultaneously every electric light on the ship was extinguished, while above"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40073"],["title","A Lively Bit of the Front: A Tale of the New Zealand Rifles on the Western Front (#4)"],["body","noise of escaping steam arose the babel of hundreds of voices as the swarm of humanity slithered in a struggling mass along the sloping floor of the mess deck.  \"Torpedoed, by Jupiter!\" shouted a voice. The ominous words were taken up by others, and in the darkness an ugly rush was made for the upper deck.     CHAPTER V  Broken down in Mid-ocean   \"It's all right, boys!\" came a deep voice. \"It's only the Padre fallen out of his bunk again.\"  The men recognized the voice.  \"Good old Padre!\" they shouted, and then silence fell upon the crowd. Someone struck a match, and held it so that the feeble glimmer shone upon his face. It was the C.O.  \"File out in an orderly manner, lads,\" he ordered. \"Fall in on the upper deck. I'll _follow_ you out. We are not going over the top this time; when we do I'll take good care to _lead_ you.\"  On the upper deck a bugle rang out shrilly. The seamen, assisted by some troops, who, detailed for duty, had not attended the sing-song, were \"standing by\" ready to lower away the boats.  Rapidly yet without confusion the mess deck was cleared. The first signs of panic nipped in the bud, the men were now as cool as cucumbers.  \"How far is it to the nearest land?\" enquired one as he ascended the ladder.  \"Less'n half a mile underneath your feet,\" was the grim answer.  True to his word, the Colonel was the last to leave the mess deck. As he emerged into the open air he remarked to the Chaplain: \"My word, Padre, heaven forgive you for that lie, but you saved the situation.\"  Like most of his comrades, Malcolm Carr was under the impression that he would soon have to swim for it, unless he was one of the lucky ones to get told off to the boats. If anyone had suggested that he was afraid, he would have stoutly repudiated the statement; but he was conscious of a peculiar sinking sensation in the pit of his stomach. To a man not a sailor by profession the knowledge that only a comparatively thin steel plate, and fractured at that, is between him and death by drowning is apt to be decidedly disconcerting. He had voluntarily contracted to risk his life by fighting the Boche, but to be \"downed\" without the chance of seeing a shot fired in earnest was hardly playing the game.  \"Hallo, Malcolm!\"  Carr turned his head and peered into the face of his right-hand man. It was Dick Selwyn.  \"Hallo, Dick! I didn't recognize your voice. How goes it?\"  \"So, so!\" replied Dick. \"Look here, I vote we stick together. Why aren't they lowering the boats? They don't seem in any sort of a hurry.\"  \"Perhaps it is as well. You know----\"  Again a bugle rang out. The ranks stiffened.  \"Boys!\" exclaimed the Colonel; \"the Captain has just sent word that there is no immediate danger. There has been a slight explosion in a bunker. One compartment--the for'ard stokehold--is flooded. For the present the men will remain on deck. The cooks will issue a hot ration. Stand at ease!\"  Out came pipes and cigarettes. The men began chatting and yarning, discussing the possibilities and chances of the catastrophe. The explosion had been an internal one, sufficient to cripple the vessel's engines. The question naturally arose as to whether it was the work of a Hun agent.  \"I'd like to know who the idiot was who yelled out something about being torpedoed,\" remarked a rifleman.  \"I did,\" owned up the man in question. \"What about it?\"  \"If you were in C Company they'd give you poison,\" declared the first speaker contemptuously.  \"And,\" retorted the other, \"if I were in C Company I'd take it. As for----\"  \"Stop that!\" ordered Sergeant Fortescue; then, turning to Malcolm, he added: \"It shows the boys are settling down again. Sort of psychologic phenomenon; I've noticed it before. While there's danger they are as well-behaved as kids in a drawing-room; directly it's over they let themselves go and start treading on each other's corns. Well, here we are, midway between New Zealand and Cape Horn, with our engines broken down. A fine old jamboree!\"  \"We've wirelessed for assistance, I've been told,\" observed Malcolm.  \"Aye,\" agreed Fortescue, \"and received a reply. No. 101, which left Wellington two days after we did, sends a reassuring message. She's a faster boat, you know. But I might add,\" he said, lowering his voice, \"that we've been warned that the _See Adler_ is somewhere knocking around, and we have to take due precaution. Ah! There you are. They're serving out small-arms and ammunition to C Company.\"  The situation was a grave one. Lying helpless on the water was Transport 99, unescorted and with no other friendly vessel within ten hours' steaming of her. She was armed with two 4.7 guns both mounted aft. These were of little use against a swift hostile craft should the latter approach on a bearing three degrees on either side of the _Awarua's_ bows. On the other hand there were half a dozen Maxims and nearly two thousand rifles on board, although these would be of little use if the raider kept beyond 200 yards' range.  Against an armed and mobile vessel the _See Adler_ would stand but little chance. She was a sailing craft provided with a powerful motor installation. Earlier in the year she had caused a certain amount of sensation by her depredations in the Atlantic, until British cruisers made that locality too hot for her. She vanished mysteriously. There were vague rumours that she had been sent to the bottom by one of the Allied warships. It was now evident that she had rounded the Horn, making use of her sails only and keeping her motors for cases of emergency, and at the present was within a few miles of the transport _Awarua_.  Throughout the rest of the night the transport's crew manned the two stern-chasers. The Maxims, protected by coal-sacks and mealie-bags, were kept ready for instant action, while each company took duty in turn to man the side, ready to supplement the machine- and quick-firing guns with a fusillade of small arms.  Daybreak came, but with it no signs of the expected raider. Viewed from the deck, the _Awarua_ showed no trace of the explosion beyond a slight list to starboard. The steam had been raised from the auxiliary engines, and the pumps were continuously ejecting water that made its way from the flooded stokehold to the adjoining compartments. The ship's artificers were busily engaged in repairing the fractured main steam-pipe. It was just possible that the vessel might be able to proceed under her own steam, either back to Wellington or else to Port Stanley, in the Falkland Islands. Meanwhile there was no line of churned water extending from under the vessel's quarter as far as the eye could reach, no dull reverberations of the \"screw\". The _Awarua_, lying helpless, rolled sullenly in the swell at the mercy of wind and ocean current.  Meanwhile the troops were kept fully occupied. Ennui was at all costs to be banished, and the best antidote for that was plenty of hard work. Parades, boat drill, physical exercises, almost filled the bill; but even then there were plenty of enthusiasts to take part in strenuous games on deck, in which the C.O. and most of the officers took a personal interest and prominent part.  Just before sunset a blurr of smoke was detected on the horizon. Transport 101 was arriving upon the scene. Two hours later, in the starry night, the new arrival came within hailing distance, and preparations were made to take the _Awarua_ in tow.  By midnight Transport 99 was moving slowly through the water in the wake of the towing vessel, three hearty cheers from the boys showing their relief at the thought that the tedious period of immobility was at an end. The repairs to the steam-pipe were almost completed, and with reasonable luck the _Awarua_ might be able to proceed under her own steam before daybreak.  At réveillé Malcolm Carr heard the welcome thud of the propeller. Going on deck, he found that Transport 101 was hull down to the west'ard, while a couple of cable-lengths on the _Awarua's_ star-board quarter was a long grey cruiser flying the White Ensign.  Just then one of the crew came aft. Malcolm knew him by sight. He was a loquacious Welsh-man, always \"in the know\", and one of the recognized media between the ship's officers and the rank and file.  \"Hallo, Sergeant!\" he exclaimed, jerking his thumb in the direction of the cruiser. \"How's that, eh? Sorter objec' lesson on the great silent navy I'll allow. She's our escort as far as the Falklands.\"  \"She's turned up at just the right moment,\" remarked Malcolm.  \"She's what?\" enquired the seaman. \"My eye, you don't know nuffink, Sergeant. She's been hoppin' about us for the last three days. I 'eard our Old Man tell the First Officer so. Got our wireless, but wouldn't reply.\"  \"Why not?\" asked Carr curiously.  \"'Cause she was waitin' to mop up that _See Adler_. Kept out of sight, hoping, in a manner o' speaking, that the Dutchy would have a smack at us, and then she'd butt in. Howsomever, they say as a jap cruiser 'as got the hang of the 'Un, an' you chaps 'ave been done out of a visit to Davy Jones this time.\"     CHAPTER VI  Man Overboard   \"Party, fall in! Sergeant, march the men aft report to the Second Mate for boat drill. Until you are dismissed you will take your orders from him.\"  Sergeant Carr saluted, and then devoted his attention to the squad fallen in on the upper deck. They were a set of stalwarts, but without exception were up-country farmers and sheep-shearers before they left New Zealand for the still distant Front. Until they joined the S.S. _Awarua_ at Wellington, very few of them had ever seen a ship's boat.  Transport 99 was forging ahead at a modest 10 or 11 knots. The 21-knot cruiser, although steaming under natural draught, was cutting rings round her charge, as if reproaching her for her tardiness. The wind was abeam and fairly fresh, making the old _Awarua_ roll heavily.  Aft on the port side of the poop stood the Second Mate, a short, bull-necked, burly man, whose attitude, suggested a bored interest in"]]]
