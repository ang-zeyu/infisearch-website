Sierra Madre Oriental  This physiographic region is represented in Tamaulipas by a small part of the long Sierra Madre Oriental that extends from the Big Bend area in Texas southward to the Trans-volcanic Belt of central México. The Sierra Madre Oriental is in the southwestern part of Tamaulipas. The Sierra was formed by folding of the Middle and Upper Cretaceous and Cenozoic deposits that now are 400 to 2700 meters in elevation. In general, the soils are Chernozems.  This physiographic region is situated between the other two physiographic regions in Tamaulipas and represents a barrier to the distribution of some tropical mammals on the one hand and to those from the Mexican Plateau on the other.  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Three physiographic regions: 1 Coastal Plain; 2 Sierra Madre Oriental; 3 Central Plateau.]   Central Plateau  This physiographic region, commonly termed the Mexican Plateau, occupies only a small area of Tamaulipas in its southwesternmost part. The plateau is approximately 900 meters above sea level. In general, the Mexican Plateau was formed by Cretaceous sediments. The most common type of soil is Chestnut.     CLIMATE   Owing to the differences in elevations and varying distances from the sea, the climate of Tamaulipas is varied. Tamayo (1949), following the Koeppen System, assigned to Tamaulipas 10 different climate types that result principally from differences in temperature, precipitation, and humidity.   Temperature  The annual mean temperature for the lands less than 1000 meters in elevation, which make up most of the state, is between 20° and 25° C.; and the difference in monthly means is 5° C.  In the areas above 1000 meters, the annual mean is between 15° and 20° C., and the difference in the monthly means is 15° C.  The maximum temperature recorded in the state is 45° C. in the region of Ciudad Victoria, between the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Sierra San Carlos, and the Sierra de Tamaulipas. Minima recorded are between O° and 5° C. on the southeastern coast, O° to -5° C. between 98° 20´ long. and 99° 00´ long., and -5° to -10° C. in the Sierra Madre Oriental.   Precipitation  Rainfall varies seasonally and can be described as follows: In January it amounts to 25 to 50 mm. in the coastal region and 10 to 25 mm. in the rest of the state. In April there is more than 25 mm. to the north of about 23° north latitude, 10 to 25 mm. in the Sierra de Tamaulipas and Sierra Madre Oriental, and less than 10 mm. in the extreme southwestern part of the state.  In July rainfall amounts to less than 25 mm. in Nuevo Laredo and San Fernando, is from 25 to 50 mm. in the northeastern and central parts of the state, 50 to 100 mm. in the Sierra San Carlos and Sierra Madre Oriental, and 100 to 200 mm. in the area south of Soto la Marina and east of the Sierra Madre Oriental. In October rainfall is less than 50 mm. in the northern half of the state, including the Sierra de Tamaulipas, and 50 to 100 mm. in the rest of the state, except on the east side of the Sierra Madre Oriental and in the area near Tampico, which receive between 100 and 200 mm.  The number of rainy days per year varies from 60 to 90 at Sierra San Carlos, Sierra Madre Oriental, and in the lowlands south of 23° north latitude; the rest of the state has about 60 rainy days, excepting the Mexican Plateau, which has fewer than 60.  Although Tamayo (1949) followed the Koeppen System in classifying types of climate and thereby recognized 10 different kinds of climate in Tamaulipas, these can be grouped into three major categories as follows:   Steppe Dry Climate (Clima Seco de Estepa)  This kind of climate can be divided into two categories based on the average annual temperature.   _Warm_  The average annual temperature exceeds 18° C. but the mean of the coolest month is less than 18° C. This sub-climate is characterized by a short rainy season in summer and occurs on the west side of the southern part of the Sierra Madre Oriental and on the Mexican Plateau; it occurs also in the area northwest of Reynosa and on the east side of the Sierra Madre Oriental but in these areas the rainfall is irregularly distributed in the year.   _Cool_  The average annual temperature is less than 18° C. but the mean of the warmest month exceeds 18° C. This sub-climate occurs only on the west side of the northern part of the Sierra Madre Oriental.   Moderate Rainy Temperature Climate (Clima Templado Moderato Lluvioso)  This type of climate is characterized by the coolest month having a temperature of between -3° and 18° C. In the northeastern and central parts of Tamaulipas, including the Sierra de Tamaulipas, Ciudad Victoria, Gómez Farías, Rancho Pano Ayuctle, and Llera, the average temperature of the warmest month is less than 22° C.; the winters are dry and not rigorous, and the wettest month has ten times as much rain as the driest. In the Sierra San Carlos the average temperature of the warmest month is less than 22° C., and the rainy season is in the autumn.   Tropical Rainy Climate (Clima Tropical Lluvioso)  This climate is characterized by the average temperature of all months being above 18° C. and the mean-annual rainfall being above 75 cm. According to the distribution of precipitation this type of climate can be divided into: (1) areas having periodic rain and wet winters (southeastern Tamaulipas, south of 22° north latitude and east of 99° west longitude), and (2) areas having an irregular rainy season and dry winters (area around Ciudad Mante, between 99° 30´ and 98° 30´ west longitude and south of 22° 30´ north latitude).     AFFINITIES OF TAMAULIPAN MAMMALS   Owing to the differences in climate from one region to another, the flora and fauna also differ, especially in the southern part of the state as compared with the northern part.       For expressing the taxonomic resemblance of mammalian faunas      having nearly equal numbers of taxa, Burt (1959:139)      recommended the following formula: C × 100/(N_{1} + N_{2} - C)      (where C is the number of taxa common to the two faunas,      N_{1} is the number of taxa in the smaller fauna, and N_{2}      is the number of taxa in the larger fauna). For non-flying      mammals the resemblance of the Tamaulipan fauna to that of      Texas, adjacent to the north, and Veracruz, adjacent to the      south, is as follows:       _Genera._--Texas 65 per cent, Veracruz 60 per cent.       _Species._--Texas 45 per cent, Veracruz 39 per cent.       For bats the resemblance of the Tamaulipan fauna to those of      Texas and Veracruz is as follows:       _Genera._--Texas 40 per cent, Veracruz 51 per cent.       _Species._--Texas 24, Veracruz 39.

On the whole, the fauna of Tamaulipas resembles faunas of both the Brazilian Subregion and the North American part of the Nearctic Subregion (see Hershkovitz, 1958:611). Considering the 48 genera of non-flying land mammals of Tamaulipas, 24 genera occur in habitats from the North American part through habitats of northern México into the Brazilian Subregion. Of the remaining 24 genera, 16 occur in the North American part of the Nearctic Subregion or in it and the part of northern México north of the Brazilian boundary, whereas eight occur in the Brazilian Subregion or in it and the northern part of México. None occurs only in Tamaulipas or only in northern México.  The non-flying fauna of the coastal plain east of the Sierra Madre Oriental and south of the Sierra de Tamaulipas and Soto la Marina is mainly tropical in affinities; only 27 per cent of that fauna (at the subspecific level) resembles the fauna north of Soto la Marina, which is Nearctic in its affinities. The fauna of the Sierra de Tamaulipas has a greater taxonomic resemblance (20.4 per cent at subspecific level) to that of the Sierra Madre Oriental, than does the fauna of the Sierra San Carlos (17.6 per cent). Taxonomic resemblance between the faunas from the Sierra San Carlos and the Sierra de Tamaulipas amounts to only 16.1 per cent. Therefore, the faunas of these two Sierras (both are included in the same zoogeographic unit) resemble each other less than either resembles the fauna of the Sierra Madre Oriental (in another zoogeographic unit). Of the three sierran faunas, those of the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Sierra de Tamaulipas have most in common. Migration from one to the other in relative recent time may account for the resemblance. The Sierra San Carlos may have been isolated for a long time and interchange between its fauna and those of the other two sierras, therefore, may have been slight.  Study of the taxonomic resemblance shows that the dividing line, in eastern México, between Nearctic and Neotropical faunas is along the eastern base of the Sierra Madre Oriental, the southern base of the Sierra de Tamaulipas and thence to the coast at or near Soto la Marina.

There were: Transitional on the highest elevations of the Sierra Madre; Upper Austral at lower elevations on the Sierra Madre; Lower Austral over most of the state; and Tropical in the coastal areas.  Dice (1943) outlined Biotic Provinces on a map of North America and in the northern part of Tamaulipas showed two Biotic Provinces, Tamaulipan and Potosian. He did not show the southeastern limits of the Chihuahuan Biotic Province nor any of the limits of the Veracruzian Biotic Province and in text mentioned nothing about the limits of these two provinces with reference to Tamaulipas. Later, Goldman and Moore (1946) divided Tamaulipas in three Biotic Provinces: Tamaulipas, Sierra Madre, and Veracruz. Still later (1949), Smith published a map of Mexican Biotic Provinces based on the herpetofauna of the Republic. He divided Tamaulipas among four Provinces. Two were Nearctic (Austro-oriental and Tamaulipan) and the other two were Neotropical (Veracruzian and Cordoban).  Leopold (1950 and 1959) recognized five principal vegetational types in Tamaulipas as follows: Mesquite-grassland; Pine-oak Forest; Thorn Forest; Tropical Deciduous Forest; and Desert.  For dealing with the mammals of Tamaulipas in the following accounts the four Biotic Provinces (Tamaulipan, Potosian, Veracruzian, and Chihuahuan) of Dice are the most useful. For dealing with types of vegetation in the accounts that follow, Leopold's (1950) system is employed although reference is made to other associations and formations that have been reported in Tamaulipas.   Tamaulipan Biotic Province  This Province is recognized by most authors who have written about the zoogeography of México. It is the most extensive in the state and includes the northern part of the Coastal Plain (see Fig. 2).  The vegetation of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province is in general Mesquite-grassland but in the Sierra San Carlos and Sierra de Tamaulipas other types of vegetation are found.       Two formations occur in the Mesquite-grassland. The first is      the Mesquite Scrub, in which the dominant plant is the      mesquite (_Prosopis juliflora_), associated with _Cordia      boissieri_, several species of _Acacia_, and in some areas      with _Opuntia_ and _Yucca treculeana_. The dominant grasses      are of the genera _Bouteloua_ and _Andropogon_. The second      formation is the Gulf Bluestem Prairie, where species of      _Andropogon_ are the dominants on the well-drained sites.      Sloughs and depressions are occupied by cordgrass, _Spartina      spartinae_. Many areas have been invaded by mesquite and      other shrubs.  [Illustration: FIG. 2. Four biotic provinces: 1 Tamaulipan; 2 Potosian; 3 Chihuahuan; 4 Veracruzian.]       Around the Sierra de Tamaulipas and in the area between it      and the Sierra San Carlos the vegetation is Thorn Forest      (Tropical Thorn Forest of Martin _et al._, 1954), in which      the dominant plants are _Acacia_, _Ichthyomethia_, _Ipomea_,      _Prosopis_, and _Cassia_. Another type of vegetation in the      Sierra de Tamaulipas is the Tropical Deciduous Forest at 300      to 700 meters elevation, the trees of which are 20 meters      high with a canopy averaging eight meters high (Martin _et      al._, _op. cit._). The common species of trees belong to the      genera _Tabebuia_, _Ipomea_, _Bombax_, and _Conzattia_.      Species of _Bursera_, _Acacia_, and _Cassia_ are less      abundant. In the low canyons _Bursera_, _Ceiba_, and      _Psidium_, draped with lianas and various epiphytes, can be      found.       The Pine-oak Formation grows above an elevation of 800      meters in the Sierra de Tamaulipas and is characterized by      _Pinus cembroides_, _P. nelsonii_, _P. teocote_, and      _Quercus arizonica_. Martin _et al._ (_op. cit._) recorded      Montane Scrub from the dry areas, between elevations of 600      and 900 meters. That scrub is formed by huisaches (_Acacia      farnesiana_) along with a few oaks and some trees of the      Tropical Deciduous Forest.       The vegetation of the Sierra San Carlos was studied by Dice      (1937) and divided into three life belts, each with several      associations. For more information about the plants of each      association and their related mammals see the publication of      the mentioned author.       Endemic mammals of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province, in the      part of it that is in Tamaulipas, are the following:      _Scalopus inflatus_; _Lepus californicus curti_;      _Spermophilus spilosoma oricolus_; _Cratogeomys castanops      tamaulipensis_; _Dipodomys ordii parvabullatus_; and      _Sigmodon hispidus solus_. Other characteristic mammals of      this Province in the state of Tamaulipas are: _Sylvilagus      floridanus connectens_; _S. audubonii parvulus_; _Lepus      californicus merriami_; _Perognathus merriami merriami_;      _Dipodomys ordii compactus_; _Orzomys melanotis carrorum_;      _Reithrodontomys fulvescens intermedius_; _Peromyscus boylii      ambiguus_; _Canis latrans texensis_; _C. l. microdon_; _C.      lupus monstrabilis_; _Taxidea taxus berlandieri_; _Mephitis      mephitis varians_; _Felis pardalis albescens_; _Trichechus      manatus latirostris_; and _Odocoileus virginianus texanus_.       Many other kinds of mammals occur mainly in the Tamaulipan      Province but are not listed above because they occur also in      one or more of the other provinces.       The Sierra de Tamaulipas is placed in the Tamaulipan Biotic      Province because the fauna, especially of non-flying      mammals, is closely related to that of the rest of the      Province. Nevertheless, many mammals found in this Sierra      are tropical in relationship. This is especially true of the      bats. Therefore, most of the tropical bats that occur in      Tamaulipas occur in the Veracruzian Biotic Province and in      the Sierra de Tamaulipas.   Potosian Biotic Province  This Province occupies all of the Sierra Madre Oriental and, therefore, the southwestern part of the state.  The vegetation in general is Pine-oak Forest, in which the most common trees are _Abies religiosa_, _Pinus flexilis_, _P. patula_, _P. montezumae_, _P. teocote_, _Populus tremuloides_, _Juniperus flaccida_, _Quercus arizonica_, _Q. clivicola_ and _Q. polymorpha_.       In his study of plants of the Gómez Farías area, Martin      (1958) recorded several different types of vegetation, which      in part can be placed in the Potosian Biotic Province,      especially those types that occur to the northwest of the      Cloud Forest. In addition to the Cloud Forest, Martin      recognized Humid Pine-oak Forest, Dry Oak-pine Forest,      Chaparral, Thorn Forest and Scrub, and Thorn Desert.       The only mammal endemic to the Potosian Province in      Tamaulipas is _Cryptotis pergracilis pueblensis_. Other      mammals that occur mainly in this Province are: _Sorex      saussurei_; _Notiosorex crawfordi_; _Glaucomys volans      herreranus_; _Cratogeomys castanops planifrons_;      _Perognathus nelsoni_; _Liomys irroratus alleni_;      _Reithrodontomys fulvescens griseoflavus_; _Microtus      mexicanus subsimus_; _Ursus americanus eremicus_; _Conepatus      leuconotus texensis_; and _Odocoileus hemionus_.       The fauna of this Province is a mixture of elements with      tropical affinities on the east side of the Sierra Madre and      with those of the Mexican Plateau on the west side.   Chihuahuan Biotic Province  This Province occurs in Tamaulipas only in a small portion of the Central Plateau physiographic region and occupies the southwesternmost part of the state.       The vegetation is of two types: Desert or      Mesquite-grassland. The last is like that described for the      Tamaulipan Biotic Province. In the Desert type the dominant      plants are the cactus, _Opuntia leptocaulis_, and yuccas,      _Yucca filifera_ and _Y. potosina_. Subdominants are      mariola, guayule, _Agave lechugilla_, _A. stricta_ or      _Larrea divaricata_. Along stream banks mesquite, _Prosopis      juliflora_, can be found.       No endemic mammals of the Chihuahuan Province are known in      Tamaulipas. Mammals that occur principally in this Province      are: _Dipodomys merriami atronasus_; _D. ordii durranti_;      _Peromyscus melanophrys consobrinus_; _P. difficilis      petricola_; _Onychomys torridus subrufus_; and _Neotoma      albigula subsolana_.   Veracruzian Biotic Province  This Province includes the southern part of the Coastal Plain physiographic region, south of the Sierra de Tamaulipas and Soto la Marina. But the exact line between this Province and the Tamaulipan Province to the north is difficult to draw. The northern boundary of the Veracruzian Province is the line between the Nearctic and Neotropical regions in eastern México.  Vegetation of most of the Veracruzian Biotic Province is Tropical Deciduous Forest. This Forest is made up of _Tabebuia_, _Ipomea_, _Bombax_, and _Conzattia_, along with some _Ceiba_, _Bursera_, and _Psidium_.       The mammalia fauna of the Veracruzian Biotic Province is      tropical in nature. This is especially true of the bats.      Representatives of the tropical genera _Micronycteris_,      _Sturnira_, _Artibeus_, _Enchistenes_, _Desmodus_,      _Diphylla_, and _Molossus_ have their northern      distributional limits in this Province. The non-flying      mammals characteristic of the Province in Tamaulipas are:      _Philander opossum pallidus_; _Marmosa mexicana_; _Ateles      geoffroyi velerosus_; _Geomys tropicalis_; _Oryzomys      melanotis rostratus_; _O. alfaroi huastecae_; _O. fulvescens      engracie_ (endemic to this Province in Tamaulipas); _O. f.      fulvescens_; _Reithrodontomys mexicanus_; _Peromyscus      orchraventer_ (endemic); _Neotoma micropus angustapalata_;      _Eira barbara senex_; _Felis wiedii oaxacensis_; and _Mazama      americana temama_.
