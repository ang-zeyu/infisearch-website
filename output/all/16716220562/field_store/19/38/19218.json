My valued friend A. H. Haworth, Esq., F.L.S., &c. possesses a fine pair of the true _P. Jairus_ in his rich and extensive collection; and the liberality with which it is constantly and freely opened to me, deserves my warmest thanks.  From these two species I have formed the present genus, the characters of which will distinguish it from that of _Hætera_ (Fabr.), a scanty genus confined to South America; and this seems to occupy its place in India: both will come in the natural family of _Hipparchidæ_. Only one specimen (a male) exists in Dr. Horsfield's collections; I could not therefore dissect the mouth, &c. On the inner borders of the inferior wings is a lengthened tuft of fine hairs: the _anus_ beneath has on each side an obtuse lengthened process, partially attached, and which appears to supply the place of the lateral valves. It is represented on a sprig of  GÆRTNERA _racemosa_,  which, although differing slightly from the figure of Dr. Roxburgh's Coromandel Plants, p. 19. t. 18, Dr. Horsfield considers as the same plant. The Javanese name is _Kakas_.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 12  [Illustration]  GOBIUS Suerii.  _Suerian Goby._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Caput parvum.

It is not uncommon on the coast of Sicily in the spring months: it has likewise been discovered on the shores of Nice by Risso, who is its first describer: his figure, however, is so remarkably bad, that it would be impossible to recognise it but for his description: in fact, the fish is so delicate, that unless the fins are very carefully expanded in water their form and colouring will never be seen correctly. It has been named after M. C. A. Le Sueur (who accompanied Peron in the French circumnavigation), an able zoologist and most inimitable draftsman and engraver.  General colour pale olivaceous yellow, with a few obscure large spots along the body somewhat brighter. The head has four yellow oblique bands, between which, and behind the eye, is a bright blue spot. Ventral fins blackish. The first dorsal fin is trigonal, and has the third ray lengthened and longest; the three last rays tipt with deep-black; the second fin is lengthened, broadest at the end, the membrane greyish-white with narrow longitudinal lines of yellow. Caudal fin lanceolate, pointed, blackish-purple, margined and marked with yellow lines parallel with the borders. Pectoral fin ovately rounded, with faint yellow transverse bands. Anal fin resembling the second dorsal, greyish, with the margin dull-purple. Scales large, very deciduous; lateral line invisible; lower jaw longest; teeth minute. Body and fins semi-transparent. The first dorsal fin has seven rays; the second fifteen; anal fifteen; pectoral twelve; caudal seventeen; ventral fourteen.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 13  [Illustration]  PLATYRHYNCHUS Ceylonensis.  _Ceylonese Flat-bill._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Rostrum breve, rectum, depressissimum, fermè trigonum; mandibulâ     superiore ad apicem abruptè aduncâ, emarginatâ; inferiore rectâ,     breviore; marginibus superioris inferiorem superplicantibus.

The stiff bristles at the corner of the mouth are nearly the length of the bill, which is quite flattened: the tail is even, and the whole bird in every respect but colour closely resembles the bearded Flycatcher (_Musc. barbata_ Lath.).  Cuvier and other modern zoologists have done much in distributing the Linnæan _Muscicapæ_ into their natural families; but as we are acquainted with a great number from descriptions only, the arrangement is by no means perfect.  The generic characters now given of the genus _Platyrhynchos_ (very slightly noticed by Vieillot) will be found perfectly applicable to the separate divisions here formed; the first comprising the _Todus Platyrhynchos_ of Gmelin, and a few others having the bill larger and more dilated than the second division, which includes the present species, together with _M. barbata_, _cærulea_, _cuneata_, and no doubt many others. The construction of the bill in all these birds will be found precisely the same, though more or less developed in each division, and even in the species; it thus becomes impossible to draw the line of demarcation without refining too much on generic distinctions. Their bills, although so broad, are by no means stout; thus enabling them to prey with greater readiness on the _Lepidoptera_ and other large winged insects with soft bodies; while the long stiff bristles at the base of the bill seem intended to confine the resistance their prey would otherwise make by their wings. The illustrious Cuvier has well observed, that the true Flycatchers have the bill longer, narrowed, less compressed, and the tip but slightly bent.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 14  [Illustration]  PICUS rubiginosus.  _Brown Woodpecker._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Rostrum polyedrum, rectum, in apicem compressum, cuneatum, attenuatum.

Eight species inhabit Europe, five of which are found in our own country. The largest however of these, the Great Black Woodpecker, is very rare; and even the others are less frequently seen than formerly, from the gradual diminution of our few remaining forests.  The present appears an undescribed species, and was sent from the Spanish Main to E. Falkner, Esq. of Fairfield. I have since seen the male, which, like many others of this genus, is distinguished by a patch of red below the eye.  Total length, eight inches and a half; bill one inch long, blackish; front and crown cinereous black; the hind head and nape crimson; a dusky whitish line (beginning at the nostrils) includes the eye and ear-feathers; below this on each side blackish, with longitudinal whitish dots, which in the male is mixed near the bill with crimson; chin blackish, speckled with white. The general plumage above is uniform tawny rufous brown, becoming more olive on the rump. Under parts olivaceous yellow, crossed with numerous close bands of blackish brown. Quills with the inner web black, the margin pale yellow; shafts and outer web tawny; tail the same, the shafts and outer half black, excepting the last pair, which have yellowish shafts and dusky tips. Wings inside, pale orange. Legs and claws dusky green.  Two or three other individuals have since fallen under my observation: the male I saw at Mr. Leadbeater's, Animal Preserver, in Brewer-street, of whose liberality and integrity in every way, I can bear the most unqualified and cheerful testimony.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 15  [Illustration]"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39471"],["title","Zoological Illustrations, Volume 1 (#6)"],["body","Melite.         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Antennæ graciles; clavâ elongatâ, fusiformi, compressâ.

They are all natives of South America, where I discovered nine species. The females differ most strikingly, and have hitherto been mistaken by authors not only for distinct species, but as belonging to different genera.  Their natural situation will be among the _Pieridæ_, with whose general habit they accord.  The female of this species resembles _Pap. Licinia_ of Cramer, except in having a short black stigma in the middle of the anterior border of the fore wings, pointing obliquely to the exterior margin. Cramer's insect, however, is the female of another undescribed species in my cabinet.  The under side of the posterior wings in both sexes is the same.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 16  [Illustration]  ISMENE Oedipodea.         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.      _Antennæ cylindraceæ, juxta medium crassissimæ, versus apicem subulatæ,     articulis numerosis brevissimis pene detectis.

It is one of the many new and interesting subjects in entomology discovered in Java by Dr. Horsfield; and by his kindness and liberality I am enabled to add the figures of the caterpillar and chrysalis, which were copied out of a fine series of drawings made in Java under his own eye: they do not appear to differ in their formation from others of this family, although the perfect insect possesses such striking and peculiar generic characters; one of the many facts which prove the impossibility of making the _Larvæ_ a primary consideration in forming the genera of Lepidoptera.  This is a rare insect, I have therefore been obliged to leave the generic character imperfect, as the dissection of the mouth, &c. would destroy the specimen. The posterior margin in the wings of the male is sinuated; in the female it is nearly straight; the underside of the wings in both sexes is the same; the anterior pair reddish-brown, paler in the middle; the tip and posterior margin whitish: inferior wings reddish-orange towards the inner margin, with an obsolete central curved band of the same, and a black dot at the base of the inferior wings. The head, palpi, and thorax are margined with orange, less conspicuous in the female.  Our knowledge of the genus _Hesperia_ of Latreille (under which the present insect would come) is little more than what was known of _Scarabæus_ twenty years ago; nor has Fabricius even noticed one half of the species figured by Cramer. The larva feeds on  GÆRTNERA _Javensis_      _Foliis ovatis, obtusè-acuminatis, caule volubili ramosissimo, ramulis     diffusis, deflexis,_  a new species, discovered in Java by Dr. Horsfield, who has distinguished it by the above specific character. He informs me the natives give it the name of _Kakas-rambat_, which last word signifies twining or trailing. In the inflorescence and fruit it differs not from _G. racemosa_.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 17  [Illustration]  BULIMUS zonatus.  _Zoned Bulimus._         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 4.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _B. testâ lævi conicâ; spiræ anfractibus quinque; ultimo aliquantulum     distorto; albis duabus fasciis ferrugineis inæqualibus; anfractu basali     rufo duabus albis fasciis; aperturâ albâ._      Shell smooth, conic, of five volutions, the last somewhat distorted;     white, with two unequal ferrugineous bands; body whirl rufous, with two     white bands.

Its precise locality is unknown: a fine specimen exists in my father's collection, who thinks it came from the East Indies; and this is the only one I have yet seen.  The aperture is more round than ovate, and is less than one half the total length of the shell; the outer lip much reflected, and the transverse bands on the spiral whirls nearly obsolete.         *       *       *       *       *   Pl. 18  [Illustration]  MITRA contracta.  _Contracted Mitre_--upper figure.         *       *       *       *       *  GENERIC CHARACTER.--_Pl._ 23.         *       *       *       *       *  SPECIFIC CHARACTER.      _M.

Shell one inch and a half long, and smooth; the base and spire with faint remote grooves; the spiral whorls are scarcely convex, and their upper margins prominent. Outer lip thick, effuse, slightly reflected below, and contracted above.
