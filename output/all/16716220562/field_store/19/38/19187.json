I cried, and leaped down again from the wall.  \"They howled back their reply, which I did not wait to hear--and that is the end of my story,\" said Pussy.  \"Thank you, Pussy dear!\" I said. And King Charlie danced frantically round the room to show his delight at the way the adventure had ended.  \"I hate low under-bred curs, and I am always glad to see them punished,\" he cried, again assuming his kingly look. He was a despot in spirit, and really thought himself King of the dogs. Poor, harmless, vain little Charlie, I loved him all the same!  \"Now it is your turn to tell _me_ a story,\" said Miss Perkie to him. \"I will tell you something more of these three dogs afterwards.\"  \"Very well,\" began King Charles, \"very well; a tale you shall have, but a short one. My tail is not long, and my tales are not long,\" and he looked towards Pussy; then at me; but neither of us smiled: he was only a dog of small intellect, so I forgave him.  \"Your story was of dogs,\" he went on; \"mine shall be of cats. You hate dogs--I hate cats; therefore we like each other.\"  Pussy did not quite follow the reasoning, as I could see from her puzzled face; but since the end was true, and the argument sounded well, she thought it must be all right.  \"My story is of a cat of your tribe, Perkie,\" he continued; \"of a Maltese kitten. They are all great play-babies, you know, and I suppose you owe your earnestness of character to me. But that is not to the point! The kitten I am speaking of was called _Pussy_. That seems to be a common name in your family, Pussy; and it is a most extraordinary thing that all the cats and kittens I have ever known have had that name, and it is yours too, Perkie, isn't it? However, it is a very pretty name, so I won't say anything more about it. It is not to the point either! To proceed: this Pussy was a _very_ great play-baby. A soft ball was her joy, her comfort; a saucer of milk, her greatest delight. How you cats can live on milk, I cannot understand. It's very nice in its way, but it goes such a _little_ way, though _that_ is not much to the point again! Well, this cat's mother was a thief--all cats are thieves--she used regularly, when she had a chance, to go to the jar of milk that was kept for me and for the family, and lap up as much as she could reach with her tongue.  [Illustration: \"AND LAP UP AS MUCH AS SHE COULD.\"]  \"Of course I hated her for this alone; but another vile practice she had increased my dislike for her. She would, every morning after the piano was dusted, jump upon the music-stool, and thence bound on to the keyboard. She would then walk about on it backwards and forwards, making the most abominable sounds--screeching notes, buzzing notes, groaning notes; groaning notes, buzzing notes, screeching notes, worse than the railway train. I could not stay in the same room with her, and used rather to go out and sit in the cold attic.  [Illustration: AN UNSKILLED PERFORMER]  \"I never actually fought her, for I always pitied her weakness, and her claws were very long and sharp. Her daughter was just as annoying in other ways, though I must confess that her ball-games were rather pretty. But still I do not agree with frivolity being turned into a science, and her games were almost scientific in grace and action. I will try to describe to you her morning occupation.  \"First of all, of course, was the mewing scene--'Mieaou--mieaou--mieaou!' 'What is it my little sweetie wants, then?' the lady of the house would ask; 'does it want its pretty little ball?' And then she would throw the miserable soft ball to her.  \"I sat by and looked on, half scornful, half amused, half---- I forget what the other half was!\"  \"Half asleep?\" suggested Pussy.  \"Perhaps half asleep, but I forget. The kitten would then watch where the ball fell, waiting till it stopped rolling. She would never touch it until it got to a considerable distance from her. Then she would suddenly dart upon a hassock or a footstool close by it, and fiercely gaze down upon it. After a while, she would stretch out one paw, and set it rolling, and, as it rolled, crawl after it, crouching low down to the ground.  [Illustration]  \"Suddenly a pounce, and a little squeak of delight: 'The ball is mine,' she thinks, and begins to play with it. She tosses it to and fro, now biting it, now patting it--preparatory, no doubt, to swallowing it.  \"But do not be too sure, Miss Pussy! See, the ball flies from her, as if possessed with life. It rolls away, on and on. And Pussy, who had thought it dead, seems struck with wonder. 'Can it be alive after all?' she thinks; 'there must be a mouse inside it!' then scamper, scamper, a spring and a leap, and she has caught the ball again. Once more it escapes from her claws--once more she bounds towards it, and now it is surely hers. I confess it was rather interesting to me to look on, and more than once I nearly joined in the chase after the ball myself. Then Pussy would roll about on the floor with it, but never did she find a mouse inside it. Poor Pussy, every day she deceived herself thus! Then I would laugh to myself. Cats are such silly aimless things! They have no higher motives than a soft ball!\"  \"Yes,\" said Miss Perkie, \"but isn't it time you began your story?\"  \"That is my story, you simpleton!\" answered King Charlie.  \"Oh, I did not know that: it was not much like one, you know.\"  \"Eh? I call it a capital story. But now it is your turn again, unless Miss Nelly will tell us one?\" he said, and turned to me.  \"I don't know many stories of cats' and dogs' adventures; but I will describe a walk I once took with the dog I had before you, Charlie, if you like.\"  And I began: \"His name was Tim, and he was a Pomeranian dog. Everybody liked him, and he liked everybody and everything excepting cats. He never harmed _our_ cats, though--it was before your time, Perkie--and never used even to worry them. But he could not abide strange cats. His greatest enemy was a big black tom, that lived quite near here. He is dead now, killed by Tim, and I am going to tell you how it all happened.  [Illustration: \"HIS GREATEST ENEMY WAS A BIG BLACK TOM-CAT.\"]  \"One day we were out for our morning walk--just as _we_ go now, Charlie--when he spied this hated cat perched up on a high rock that overhung the lane. He was peering down at us, and I suppose he thought we should not see him. But 'Tim's eyes looked everywhere when we were out together,' I used to say. At any rate, he saw his enemy up there at once, and made after him at full speed. The frightened cat did not seem to know what to do, and in his flurry did the worst thing he could have done. Behind him stretched a field of barley, and the foolish animal rushed straight into it. I called to Tim, but he did not hear, or pretended not to.  \"The next thing I saw was Tim coming along, wagging his tail, the tom-cat dead between his teeth.  [Illustration: \"HE STOOD UP ON HIS HIND-LEGS.\"]  \"I scolded Tim, and beat him; but he could not understand that he had not done a very virtuous deed. For my own part, I was not sorry the cat had been killed; he was a great nuisance in the neighbourhood, and often used to steal our chickens. So I could not find the heart to give Tim all the beating he deserved; and when he stood up on his hind-legs, half-sorrowfully, half-beseechingly, looking into my face, I felt that he had only acted according to his nature, and that what was wrong in us to do might not be a sin in him. Therefore I took the dear old dog back again into my favour, and forgave him his disobedience in not coming when I called him. The darling old fellow bore me no spite, and soon he was gambolling along again at my side, as though nothing had happened.\"  \"Quite right, quite right!\" interposed King Charlie at this point; \"but go on with the story.\"  \"We walked on until we came to a farm-yard,\" I continued. \"All of a sudden Tim rushed forward, then back again to me, barking loudly, as though mad.  \"'What is it, Tim? What is it? Good dog! good fellow!' I cried to him, but no good; he seemed distracted about something.  [Illustration]  \"Then I looked in the direction in which he was barking, and there I saw on the steps of the barn a large toy-lamb, which some children must have left behind them. On its back a bird was perched. The poor dickie had made a mistake; he thought, no doubt, it was a real lamb! And Tim, too, who had never seen such an extraordinary sight before, was astonished beyond measure, and resented what he thought was meant for a personal insult to himself.  \"He scrambled under the wooden fence that surrounded the farm-yard, and hurried towards the terrible object.  [Illustration: \"HE SCRAMBLED UNDER THE WOODEN FENCE.\"]  \"'Come back--here, Tim--Tim!' I shouted after him, but in vain: the bird had flown from the lamb's back, and the lamb was already torn to tatters by the furious dog.  \"Then he came back to me, barking 'See how I have treated the impostor!'  \"But I did not see with his eyes. I whipped him again, and after having given the woman at the farm enough money to buy another lamb, I took him home. Two misbehaviours in one walk I thought quite enough.  \"Poor old Tim! he died soon afterwards, and then you came, you know, Charlie. That's all my story. I love to recall my memories of dear old Tim; but I am afraid I've not interested you two much.\"  \"No, not much, as far as I am concerned,\" rudely answered King Charles. I did not mean it, but I had made him very jealous by the love I had shown for Tim. I could not therefore take offence at his rude answer, especially as His Majesty had always been petted and spoilt so much.  \"It is Perkie's turn now to tell her other story,\" he added.  \"I am ready,\" said Pussy, and began at once: \"As I said before, my story shall be about the same three dogs, and how they tried to catch a mouse. I heard it from the mouse's own lips--I'll tell you how, later on--so it must be true!  \"The lazy dogs were,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39358"],["title","A Winter Nosegay: Being Tales for Children at Christmastide (#3)"],["body"," usual, snoring in the kitchen of the house to which they belonged. A little mouse peeped her head out of a hole, and saw them asleep. 'Surely,' she thought,--'surely I can get onto the table without waking them.' So she tried.  \"She reached the table without a sound, and the dogs still snored on peacefully. To mount the leg of the table, and to climb up among the dishes and glass were but the matter of a moment to her. Then she set to work. As she tasted the nice, fresh cheese, she quite forgot all about her enemies, the dogs. She clattered the plates, and made such a noise, that they soon started from their sleep.  \"'A mouse! a mouse on the table!' they cried, and rushed towards it.  \"'I am, anyhow, safe up here,' thought mousie, and nibbled on.  \"The dogs soon grew weary of waiting below, and consulted together as to what they should do. At last they hit upon a plan. They seized the table-cloth between their teeth, and began to drag it from the table. Crash! crash! down came the dishes and plates and vases, knives and forks and all, smothering the dogs in broken bits of glass and water.  [Illustration: \"DOWN IT ALL CAME, SMOTHERING THE DOGS IN BROKEN BITS OF GLASS AND WATER.\"]  \"Poor little mousie was nearly dragged down too, only she just managed to scramble onto the table again, whence she leaped down to the ground. The dogs saw her, however, and gave chase. She climbed up the wooden partition leading to the loft; but a friend of mine sat up there in wait for her. The sly puss had expected that all would turn out as it had happened, and thought she would get a nice meal without the trouble of hunting it down. She was mistaken, though--for mousie saw her, and stopped half-way up the wall, just out of reach of the dogs. They stood below, barking at her, but could do nothing more.  [Illustration: \"JUST OUT OF REACH OF THE DOGS.\"]  \"After a while mousie felt her strength giving way, so she ran a little sideways along the wall, jumped down, and scampered through the open door along the passage. Her three torturers hurried after her, and away they all went helter-skelter.  [Illustration: \"ALONG THE PASSAGE.\"]  \"Now, midway across the passage stood the hall-bench. The mouse sprang over it at one bound; but the three clumsy dogs were not so clever. The first one jumped too short, and he just caught the further side of the bench; he pulled it backwards, and together both came down with a crash. He limped back to the hearth-side with a lame leg, having had enough of mouse-catching. His two companions saw his fall, and followed him. All bullies are cowards!\" sagely added Pussy, parenthetically.  [Illustration: THE HALL-BENCH.]  [Illustration: \"DOG AND BENCH CAME DOWN WITH A CRASH.\"]  \"And what became of the mouse?\" asked the impatient Charlie.  \"Why, I was there for her all ready at the end of the passage, and the dogs had done my work for me. But I did not eat her up. I promised her her life if she would tell me all about how she escaped from them, and what they had suffered--and that's how I know it all.\"  \"Thank you, Pussy dear, for your----\"  [Illustration]  \"What are you thinking about, child, calling me Pussy?\" exclaimed my godmother, shaking me from a deep sleep. \"I have come to bid you good-bye, as I am going now. Little girls should be more respectful to their elders.\"  \"But, really, I suppose I must have been dreaming that----\"  \"Little girls should not dream foolish things. You should know better, my dear. Now, good-bye, Nelly!\"  And so it was all a dream! Yes, there lay Pussy and Charlie fast asleep, too. Dear me! I wish it had been real, though!  [Illustration]     [Illustration]     A Fortune in an Empty Wallet.     A FORTUNE IN AN EMPTY WALLET.   IN the north of England, several hundred years ago, there lived a young knight. He was very poor, as his father had spent all his money, and the only things of value that he left his son were a white horse of wonderful beauty and a very curious old sword. Edgar--that was the knight's name--was obliged to leave his home, for he had no money to spend in keeping up a large house; and, besides, his father had been deeply in debt, and the tradesmen were clamouring for their bills to be paid, and threatening to put him in prison if he did not pay them. So, having filled two bundles with clothes and food, he mounted his horse and rode off to seek his fortune abroad.  He had been journeying along for several days, not knowing where to go or what to do, when one evening he found himself riding through a dark and gloomy forest. He was thinking to himself how dismal his future looked, and was wondering how he should be able to make a living, when all of a sudden his horse started, reared up on his hind-legs, and then stood quite still, trembling with fright.  Edgar looked around him, and saw, standing under the shadow of an old yew-tree, the figure of an aged man. His form was bent with years, and he leaned for support on a thick knotted stick. His clothes were patched and torn, his toes peeped out from his worn-out boots, while in one hand he carried an old wallet, which had been carefully mended, and which evidently contained something that he greatly valued.  As soon as Edgar's horse stopped short, the old man came near, and asked for alms.  \"You have come to the wrong person,\" replied Edgar; \"for though I would gladly help you if I could, I expect that I am quite as poor as you are, except that I still have my sword and my good steed.\"  The old man looked earnestly at the sword, and his eyes sparkled as he asked eagerly--  \"Where did you get that sword from?\"  \"My father gave it to me,\" replied Edgar; \"and he brought it home with him when he returned from the wars beyond the seas.\"  \"Noble knight!\" returned the old man, \"in my wallet I have a jewel that is beyond price. That sword of yours takes my fancy, and if you like to exchange it for my wallet and what it contains, I assure you that you will not repent it.\"  \"Let me first see the jewel,\" said Edgar; for although he was very anxious to get it, he wanted first of all to make quite sure that it was really there.  \"Before I let you have my wallet I must have your sword,\" said the old man; \"but if you do not like your bargain, I will give it you back again. You see I cannot possibly run away with it, for you are on horse-back, while I am on foot.\"  At first Edgar refused to do this, but at last he agreed; for he thought to himself that he could easily get the sword back, as of course the old man could not run as fast as his horse. He therefore handed down his sword and received the old wallet in exchange.  He opened it eagerly, but to his rage and dismay found that it was empty. In his anger he turned round so suddenly, that by accident he touched his horse with his spur. The horse at once began to gallop off, and it had carried him some distance before he could stop it.  When he returned to the spot where he had given up his sword, he at first saw nothing of the beggar, but happening to look up, to his great surprise he saw him sitting in the top of a tall tree, having climbed there so as to be out of his reach.  \"Honoured knight!\" cried the beggar, \"forgive me for playing you such a trick, and rest assured that you shall not in the end suffer for it. This sword which I hold in my hand belonged to my great-grandfather, who was killed in the first crusade, and it has chanced to become your property in some way or other. I knew it at once by the curious hilt, of which the cross-piece is, as you know, turned up at one end and down at the other. Give me your knightly word that you will not harm me, and I will come down and explain to you how it is that I value the sword so highly. Of one thing you may be certain--I shall not deceive you again. And what I tell you will be of great service to you.\"  Edgar promised the beggar that he should be safe, and the latter began to scramble down from his uncomfortable perch. But, wonderful to relate, he was quite changed, and was now a handsome youth, though still dressed in the same tattered old clothes.  \"My name,\" said the beggar, \"is Bertram; and to you I owe a debt of gratitude that I can never repay, for by means of this sword I can win back the castle and lands of my ancestors, from which I have been lately driven to wander about in the guise of an old beggar. Henceforth we will be as brothers, and the half of my lands shall be yours; for had it not been for you, they would never again have become mine. But let me tell you my story.  \"Three years ago my father died, and I became heir to all his estates; but my step-mother was a wicked woman, and hated me with all her might. Twelve months since she married again, and both she and her husband set to work to drive me from my home. Many of their attempts failed; but at last they secured the help of an old wizard, who turned me into a beggar. Of course nobody recognized me in this disguise, and my own servants only laughed and jeered when I told them who I was, and my step-father drove me from the castle with blows that I was too feeble to resist.  \"I begged him to have mercy, but he only laughed; and the wizard, who was standing by him, said, 'A beggar you must remain until you find your great-grandfather's sword:' then they slammed the door in my face.  [Illustration]  [Illustration]  \"My father thought that he was perfectly safe to keep the castle for ever, as he believed the sword had been lost in a foreign land, and that I never could possibly find it again. But chance has brought it to me when I least expected it, and at a time when I am within a mile of my castle. Come, my friend, let us go and take possession, for I know that the wizard spoke the truth when he said that I should enjoy my own again when I got this sword, because already half of what he said has come true, since I am once more my own self, instead of being an old beggar.\"  Edgar took Bertram up behind him on his horse, and together they rode off to the"]]]
