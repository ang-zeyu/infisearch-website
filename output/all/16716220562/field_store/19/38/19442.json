The squaw, also, seemed to resent his presence, for, after a lowering glance, she drew the shawl closer about her head, and, leaving the trail, slunk out of sight around the corner of the store.  Burrell looked up at his companion's clear-cut, delicate face, at the wind-tanned cheeks, against which her long braids lay like the blue-black locks of an Egyptian maid, then at her warm, dark eyes, in which was a hint of the golden light of the afternoon sun. He noted covertly the slender lines of her body and the dainty, firm, brown hands flung protectingly about the shoulders of her little friends, who were peering at him owlishly from their shelter.  The bitter revolt that had burned in him at the prospect of a long exile in this undiscovered spot died out suddenly. What a picture she made! How fresh and flower-like she looked, and yet the wisdom of her! He spoke impulsively:  \"I am glad you are here, Miss Necia. I was glad the moment I saw you, and I have been growing gladder ever since, for I never imagined there would be anybody in this place but men and squaws--men who hate the law and squaws who slink about--like that.\" He nodded in the direction of the Indian woman's disappearance. \"Either that, or, at best, a few 'breeds' like these little fellows.\"  She looked at him quickly.  \"Well! What difference would that make?\"  \"Ugh! Squaws and half-breeds!\" His tone conveyed in full his utter contempt.  The tiny hands of the boy and girl slid into her own as she arose. A curiously startled look lay in her eyes, and an inquiring, plaintive wrinkle came between her brows.  \"I don't believe you understand,\" she said. \"Lieutenant Burrell, this is my sister, Molly Gale, and this is my little brother John.\" Both round-eyed elfs made a ducking courtesy and blinked at the soldier, who gained his feet awkwardly, a flush rising into his cheeks.  From the regions at the rear of the store came the voice of an Indian woman calling:  \"Necia! Necia!\"  \"Coming in a moment!\" the girl called back; then, turning to the young officer, she added, quietly: \"Mother needs me now. Good-bye!\"     CHAPTER II  POLEON DORET'S HAND IS QUICKER THAN HIS TONGUE   The trader's house sat back of the post, farther up on the hill. It was a large, sleepy house, sprawling against the sunny side of the slope, as if it had sought the southern exposure for warmth, and had dozed off one sultry afternoon and never waked up from its slumber. It was of great, square-hewn timbers, built in the Russian style, the under side of each log hollowed to fit snugly over its fellow underneath, upon which dried moss had previously been spread, till in effect the foot-thick walls were tongued and grooved and, through years of seasoning, become so tinder dry that no frosts or heats could penetrate them. Many architects had worked on it as it grew, room by room, through the years, and every man had left behind the mark of his individuality, from Pretty Charlie the pilot, who swung an axe better than any Indian on the river, to Larsen the ship's carpenter, who worked with an adze and who starved the summer following on the Koyukuk. It had stretched a bit year by year, for the trader's family had been big in the early days when hunters and miners of both breeds came in to trade, to loaf, and to swap stories with him. Through the winter days, when the caribou were in the North and the moose were scarce, whole families of natives came and camped there, for Alluna, his squaw, drew to her own blood, and they felt it their due to eat of the bounty of him who ruled them like an overlord; but when the first goose honked they slipped away until, by the time the salmon showed, the house was empty again and silent, save for Alluna and the youngsters. In return these people brought him many skins and much fresh meat, for which he paid no price, and, with the fall, his cache was filled with fish of which the bulk were dried king salmon as long as a grown man's leg and worth a dollar apiece to any traveller.  There are men whose wits are quick as light, and whose muscles have been so tempered and hardened by years of exercise that they are like those of a wild animal. Of such was John Gale; but with all his intelligence he was very slow at reading, hence he chose to spend his evenings with his pipe and his thoughts, rather than with a book, as lonesome men are supposed to do. He did with little sleep, and many nights he sat alone till Alluna and Necia would be awakened by his heavy step as he went to his bed. That he was a man who could really think, and that his thoughts were engrossing, no one doubted who saw him sitting enthralled at such a time, for he neither rocked, nor talked, nor moved a muscle hour after hour, and only his eyes were alive. To-night the spell was on him again, and he sat bulked up in his chair, rocklike and immovable.  From the open door of the next room he could hear Necia and the little ones. She had made them ready for bed, and was telling them the tale of the snow-bird's spot.  \"So when all the other birds had failed,\" he heard her say, \"the little snowbird asked for a chance to try. He flew and flew, and just before he came to the edge of the world where the two Old Women lived he pulled out all of his feathers. When he came to them he said:\"  \"'I am very cold. May I warm myself at your fire?'\"  \"They saw how little and naked he was, and how he shivered, so they did not throw sticks at him, but allowed him to creep close. He watched his chance, and when they were not looking he picked up a red-hot coal in his beak and flew back home with it as fast as ever he could--and that is how fire came to the Indian people.\"  \"Of course the coal was hot, and it burned his throat till a drop of blood came through, so ever since that day the snowbird has had a red spot on his throat.\"  The two children spoke out in their mother's tongue, clamoring for the story of the Good Beaver who saved the hunter's life, and she began, this time in the language of the Yukon people, while Gale listened to the low music of her voice, muffled and broken by the log partition.  His squaw came in, her arrival unannounced except by the scuff of her moccasins, and seated herself against the wall. She did not use a chair, of which there were several, but crouched upon a bear-skin, her knees beneath her chin, her toes a trifle drawn together. She sat thus for a long time, while Necia continued her stories and put the little ones to bed. Soon the girl came to say good-night.  John Gale had never kissed his daughter, and, as it was not a custom of her mother's race, she never missed the caresses. On rare occasions the old man romped with the little ones and took them in his arms and acted as other fathers act, but he had never done these things with her. When she had gone he spoke without moving.  \"She'll never marry Poleon Doret.\"  \"Why?\" inquired Alluna.  \"He ain't her kind.\"  \"Poleon is a good man.\"  \"None better. But she'll marry some--some white man.\"  \"Poleon is white,\" the squaw declared.  \"He is and he ain't. I mean she'll marry an 'outside' man. He ain't good enough, and--well, he ain't her kind.\" Alluna's grunt of indignation was a sufficient answer to this, but he resumed, jerking his head in the direction of the barracks. \"She's been talking a lot with this--this soldier.\"  \"Him good man, too, I guess,\" said the wife.  \"The hell he is!\" cried the trader, fiercely. \"He don't mean any good to her.\"  \"Him got a woman, eh?\" said the other.  \"No, no! I reckon he's single all right, but you don't understand. He's different from us people. He's--he's--\" Gale paused, at a loss for words to convey his meaning. \"Well, he ain't the kind that would marry a half-breed.\"  Alluna pondered this cryptic remark unsuccessfully, and was still seeking its solution when her lord continued:  \"If she really got to loving him it would be bad for all of us.\"  Evidently Alluna read some hidden meaning back of these words, for she spoke quickly, but in her own tongue now, as she was accustomed to do when excited or alarmed.  \"Then this thing must cease at once. The risk is too great. Better that you kill him before it is too late.\"'  \"Hardly that,\" said the trader.  \"Think of the little ones and of me,\" the squaw insisted, and, encouraged by his silence, continued: \"Why not? Soon the nights will grow dark. The river runs swiftly, and it never gives up its dead. I can do it if you dare not. No one would suspect me.\"  Gale rose and laid his big hand firmly on her shoulder.  \"Don't talk like that. There has been too much blood let already. We'll allow things to run along a bit as they are. There's time enough to worry.\"  He rose, but instead of going to his room he strode out of the house and walked northward up the trail, passing through the town and out of sight. Alluna sat huddled up in the doorway, her shawl drawn close about her head, and waited for him until the late sun--which at this time of year revolves in a great circle overhead--dipped down below the distant mountains for the midnight hour, then rolled slanting out again a few points farther north, to begin its long journey anew; but he did not return. At last she crept stiffly in-doors, like an old and weary woman, the look of fright still staring in her eyes.  About nine o'clock the next morning a faint and long-drawn cry came from the farthest limits of the little camp. An instant later it was echoed closer, and then a dog began to howl. Before its voice had died away another took it up sadly, and within three breaths, from tip and down the half-mile of scanty water-front, came the cry of \"Steam-bo-o-a-t!\" Cabin doors opened and men came out, glanced up the stream and echoed the call, while from sleepy nooks and sun-warmed roofs wolf-dogs arose, yawning and stretching. Those who had slept late dressed as they hurried towards the landing-place, joining in the plaint, till men and malamutes united in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4082"],["title","The Barrier (#3)"],["body","hrill, slow cry.  Down-stream came the faint-sighing whoof-whoof of a steamer, and then out from behind the bend she burst, running on the swift spring current with the speed of a deer. She blew hoarsely before the tardy ones had reached the bank, and when abreast of the town her bell clanged, the patter of her great wheel ceased, she reversed her engines and swung gracefully till her bow was up against the current, then ploughed back, inching in slowly until, with much shouting and the sound of many gongs, she slid her nose quietly into the bank beneath the trading-post and was made fast. Her cabin-deck was lined with passengers, most of whom were bound for the \"outside,\" although still clad in mackinaw and overalls. They all gazed silently at the hundred men of Flambeau, who stared back at them till the gang-plank was placed, when they came ashore to stretch their legs. One of them, however, made sufficient noise to make up for the silence of the others. Before the steamer had grounded he appeared among the Siwash deck-hands, his head and shoulders towering above them, his white teeth gleaming from a face as dark as theirs, shouting to his friends ashore and pantomiming his delight to the two Gale children who had come with Alluna to welcome him.  \"Who's dose beeg, tall people w'at stan' 'longside of you, Miz Gale?\" he called to her; then, shading his eyes elaborately, he cried, in a great voice: \"Wall! wal! I b'lieve dat's M'sieu Jean an' Mam'selle Mollee. Ba Gar! Dey get so beeg w'ile I'm gone I don' know dem no more!\"  The youthful Gales wriggled at this delicious flattery and dug their tiny moccasined toes into the sand. Molly courtesied nervously and continuously as she clung to her mother, and the boy showed a gap where two front teeth had been and was now filled by a very pink tongue.  \"Wen you goin' stop grow, anyhow, you two, eh?\" continued the Frenchman, and then, in a tone of sadness: \"If I t'ink you ack lak' dis, I don' buy all dese present. Dese t'ing ain' no good for ole folks. I guess I'll t'row dem away.\" He made as if to heave a bundle that he carried into the river, whereupon the children shrieked at him so shrilly that he laughed long and incontinently at the success of his sally.  Lieutenant Burrell had come with the others, for the arrival of a steamboat called for the presence of every soul in camp, and, spying Necia in the outskirts of the crowd, he took his place beside her. He felt constrained, after what had happened on the previous evening, but she seemed to have forgotten the episode, and greeted him with her usual frankness. Even had she remembered it, there was nothing he could say in explanation or in apology. He had lain awake for hours thinking of her, and had fallen asleep with her still in his mind, for the revelation of her blood had come as a shock to him, the full force of which he could not appreciate until he had given himself time to think of it calmly.  He had sprung from a race of Slave-holders, from a land where birth and breed are more than any other thing, where a drop of impure blood effects an ineradicable stain; therefore the thought of this girl's ignoble parentage was so repugnant to him that the more he pondered it the more pitiful it seemed, the more monstrous. Lying awake and thinking of her in the stillness of his quarters, it had seemed a very unfortunate and a very terrible thing. During his morning duties the vision of her had been fresh before him again, and his constant contemplation of the matter had wrought a change in his attitude towards the girl, of which he was uncomfortably conscious and which he was glad to see she did not perceive.  \"There are some of the lucky men from El Dorado Creek,\" she informed him, pointing out certain people on the deck. \"They are going out to the States to get something to eat. They say that nothing like those mines have ever been heard of in the world. I wish father had gone up last year when the news came.\"  \"Why didn't he?\" asked the Lieutenant. \"Surely he must have been among the first to learn of it.\"  \"Yes. 'Stick' George sent him word a year ago last fall, when he made the first discovery, but for some reason father wouldn't go.\"  The men were pouring off the boat now, and through the crowd came the tall Frenchman, bearing in the hollow of each arm a child who clasped a bundle to its breast. His eyes grew brighter at sight of Necia, and he broke into a flood of patois; they fairly bombarded each other with quick questions and fragmentary answers till she remembered her companion, who had fallen back a pace and was studying the newcomer, whereupon she turned.  \"Oh, I forgot my manners. Lieutenant Burrell, this is Napoleon Doret--our Poleon!\" she added, with proud emphasis.  Doret checked his volubility and stared at the soldier, whom he appeared to see for the first time. The little brown people in his arms stared likewise, and it seemed to Burrell that a certain distrust was in each of the three pairs of eyes, only in those of the man there was no shyness. Instead, the Canadian looked him over gravely from head to heel, seeming to note each point of the unfamiliar attire; then he inquired, without removing his glance:  \"Were'bouts you live, eh?\"  \"I live at the post yonder,\" said the Lieutenant.  \"Wat biznesse you work at?\"  \"I am a soldier.\"  \"Wat for you come 'ere? Dere's nobody fightin' roun' dis place.\"  \"The Lieutenant has been stationed here, foolish,\" said Necia. \"Come up to the store quick and tell me what it's like at Dawson.\" With a farewell nod to Burrell, she went off with Doret, whose speech was immediately released again.  In spite of the man's unfriendliness, Burrell watched him with admiration. There were no heels to his tufted fur boots, and yet he stood a good six feet two, as straight as a pine sapling, and it needed no second glance to tell of what metal he was made. His spirit showed in his whole body, in the set of his head, and, above all, in his dark, warm face, which glowed with eagerness when he talked, and that was ever--when he was not singing.  \"I never see so many people since I lef Quebec,\" he was saying. \"She's jus' lak' beeg city--mus' be t'ree, four t'ousan' people. Every day some more dey come, an' all night dey dance an' sing an' drink w'iskee. Ba gosh, dat's fine place!\"  \"Are there lots of white women?\" asked the girl.  \"Yes, two, t'ree hondred. Mos' of dem is work in dance-halls. Dere's one fine gal I see, name' Marie Bourgette. I tell you 'bout her by-an'-by.\"  \"Oh, Poleon, you're in love!\" cried Necia.  \"No, siree!\" he denied. \"Dere's none of dem gal look half so purty lak' you.\" He would have said more, but spying the trader at the entrance of the store, he went to him, straightway launching into the details of their commercial enterprise, which, happily, had been most successful. Before they could finish, the crowd from the boat began to drift in, some of them buying drinks at the bar and others making purchases of tobacco and so forth, but for the main part merely idling about curiously.  Among the merchandise of the Post there were for sale a scanty assortment of fire-arms, cheap shot-guns, and a Winchester or two, displayed in a rack behind the counter in a manner to attract the eye of such native hunters as might need them, and with the rest hung a pair of Colt's revolvers. One of the new arrivals, who had separated from the others at the front, now called to Gale:  \"Are those Colts for sale? Mine was stolen the other day.\" Evidently he was accustomed to Yukon prices, for he showed no surprise at the figure the trader named, but took the guns and tested each of them, whereupon the old man knew that here was no \"Cheechako,\" as tenderfeet are known in the North, although the man's garb had deceived him at first glance. The stranger balanced the weapons, one in either hand, then he did the \"double roll\" neatly, following which he executed a move that Gale had not witnessed for many years. He extended one of the guns, butt foremost, as if surrendering it, the action being free and open, save for the fact that his forefinger was crooked and thrust through the trigger-guard; then, with the slightest jerk of the wrist, the gun spun about, the handle jumped into his palm, and instantly there was a click as his thumb flipped the hammer. It was the old \"road-agent spin,\" which Gale as a boy had practised hours at a time; but that this man was in earnest he showed by glancing upward sharply when the trader laughed.  \"This one hangs all right,\" he said; \"give me a box of cartridges.\"  He emptied his gold-sack in payment for the gun and ammunition, then remarked:  \"That pretty nearly cleans me. If I had the price I'd take them both.\"  Gale wondered what need induced this fellow to spend his last few dollars on a fire-arm, but he said nothing until the man had loosened the bottom buttons of his vest and slipped the weapon inside the band of his trousers, concealing its handle beneath the edge of his waistcoat. Then he inquired:  \"Bound for the outside?\"  \"No. I'm locating here.\"  The trader darted a quick glance at him. He did not like this man.  \"There ain't much doing in this camp; it's a pretty poor place,\" he said, guardedly.  \"I'll put in with you, from its looks,\" agreed the other. \"It's got too many soldiers to be worth a damn.\" He snarled this bitterly, with a peculiar leering lift of his lip, as if his words tasted badly.  \"Most of the boys are going up-river,\" said Gale.  \"Well, those hills look as if they had gold in them,\" said the stranger, pointing vaguely. \"I'm going to prospect.\"  Gale knew instinctively that the fellow was lying, for his hands were not those of a miner; but there was nothing to be said. His judgment was verified, however, when Poleon drew him aside later and said:  \"You know dat feller?\"  \"No.\"  \"He's bad man.\"  \"How do you know?\"  \"She's leave Dawson damn queeck.
