Sirius. Far Centauris. And at the end of it, the hucksters, the phony props, would be there first.  Some people should stay on Earth, she thought, those who are so hard to please. There the veils of space and time might keep the last illusions living. Once you find that even the farthest star is illusory, there's no place left to go.  His lips were near her lips. His voice was low. \"You are different!\" His throat trembled. \"You really are. But--I wonder if you're different enough.\"  She was aware of the awful gnawing emptiness within her that was only intense desire too frightened to be free. And then his lips were crushing to hers and she allowed it, for she knew what was to be her only way out, and the promise of union was a haze in the room like the veils of light from the moons of Mars that joined against the starlight of heaven.  There was more than the ardent in his intensity. A kind of desperation, his desire to please going beyond the line of duty. The old consuming terror returned.  She pushed him away. His hands reached, his body crushed. Panic. She felt unable to breathe, and she started to scream. His hand was over her mouth.  \"Don't look any deeper, don't probe any farther!\" he said, like a suddenly terrible threat. \"I beg you, don't do it! You're different--beautifully different, Madeleine. But not different enough! None of them ever are!\"  She squirmed away, onto the floor between the glass and the couch, and scurried toward the door. She could hear the gasping, the sobbing desperation in his voice, and his shadow lengthened across the walls.  Then, as she hesitated in the doorway, he was gone.  She put on a nylon hiking suit and left the room. The silence of the hall was not real, and the emptiness was not really emptiness. It was like waking and being exasperatingly aware of only the fleeting end of a dream. And as she slipped out a side entrance, even the wailing of exotic musical instruments seemed in a sense not real. Even the silence, the feeling of being followed, watched, even that seemed artificial--it was impossible to substantiate the suspicion.  Her palms were wet as she slipped along the wall toward the garage where the sandsleds were kept. From the amphitheatre she could hear the rituals, the intercessions, comminations, hymns, libations, incense-burning, and who knew what else. She saw the reflection of chrome and artificial glitter disguised as Martian authenticity, the lights hanging like a grove of pastel moons, and the shrill empty laughter of girls uncoiling as bright as tinsel through the sluggish Martian evening. And in spite of the sound and elaborate pretension, it all had the undying feel of lugubrious solitude.  It had, for a doomed generation driven into inescapable conformity, the necessary quality of a dream in which a stubborn unconsciousness seeks ever for truth. And later, back on Earth, in the rut and groove, it would remain only a dream no one ever talked about to anyone else. After all, it would simply be something that happened on another world.  She gave one brief, bitter laugh. And even on another world the last desperate dream was false.  There might be something to be said for release through a pagan orgy under the double moons; she had no moral scruples about it. But the paganism would have to be real, that was the thing. Besides, it was too late. For a moment she pressed her flattened hands against her face and felt tears squeezing through the tightly-locked fingers. She felt as though she might explode somewhere inside and realized how the invisible edges of living had cut her soul to pieces.  It wasn't even self-pity any more. It had grown above self-pity to a realism beyond tragedy.  She felt icy and empty and alone as she lit a cigarette. Through the taper smoke, the glowing amphitheatre seemed like a golden porpoise lapped in dawn, and coupled with the expanse of the Haven it nestled in the night to resemble a sleeping question mark, an entity gay and sad and full of what was called life.  There was no turning back now. There was no turning back, even to Earth, for that would be the most humiliating defeat of all.  Then she was inside the first sandsled. The sled moved noiselessly out of the garage and whispered away over the sands.  After only a few minutes the radio frightened her with an abrupt voice like that of a disembodied spirit.  \"Madeleine!\"  She looked back through the trailing skeins of moonlight. A dark spot was overtaking her. She couldn't go any faster. Evidently Don had one of those racing sleds that hardly seemed to touch the sand at all.  \"Madeleine! Please--for God's sake, don't see that old hermit!\"  \"For the sake of which God, Don? I understand the Martians had more than one.\"  \"Madeleine! I'm begging you to come back!\"  \"Why?\"  \"You know why.\"  \"The contamination!\" She laughed. \"Your melodramatic devices don't frighten me.\"  \"It's true. You'll die--! Come back!\"  \"To what?\"  \"We'll talk about it! Just come back!\"  \"What's so dangerous, Don, about my not accepting things here as they're supposed to be?\"  His voice tightened. \"Just stop, stop and come back!\"  She didn't stop, didn't bother to answer. She circled the sandsled among the hills, skirting the rocky clefts with a reckless abandon she had never felt before, and her face was flushed as she leaned her head back and laughed.  \"Madeleine!\"  It was the last time he called to her. After that, the silence conveyed an intensity of purpose far stronger than verbal entreaties.  She swerved the sandsled dangerously among the erosions, and felt the grinding strain at the base of her skull as the sled bounded from one spire and careened toward another, which she barely avoided smashing into head-on.  She recognized the area. She leaped out of the car and ran, hearing the pursuing sandsled stop somewhere below her as she climbed.  For an instant dizziness threatened, and the surroundings and the motions of Don and herself and the love moons in the sky seemed wildly, almost dangerously abstracted, as if viewed through drug-glazed eyes. A panicky wash of blood came to her face and she struggled for breath, wanting to cry out. It passed. Her mind groped for reason and the terror receded.  She went on up to the ridge and found the old man waiting. From that high ridge where the night wind cut coldly toward the Martian south, the lights of the rituals in the amphitheatre of Martian Haven flickered in a misty halo far away, like phosphorescent globes of spooky glowing, and frenetic dancings and shiftings of crazed flames.  The old man had a vague, insubstantial look, only his eyes seemed real, almost too real, in their intensity as he looked at her. He was propped against a block of eroded rock and the wind rustled the fringes of his ragged robe.  She sat beside him, their shoulders touched. And then, as though slowly dissolving through some chemical reaction, the old man began to fade. Vaguely Don was there, too, in a nebulous transparency like the old man. And Madeleine lay there, her face pressed into the sand. On Mars one should expect, without shock, a different kind of reality.  Their voices weren't really voices. Just thoughts, thoughts in the head, feelings, but nothing solid. The thoughts of Don and the old man seemed to be in some kind of time-worn conflict.  \"You encouraged her,\" Don was thinking.  \"Those who can see a little should be urged to try to see more. Maybe, sometime, we'll find one who is different enough to come through to us.\"  \"No! It never works that way! They just--die.\"  \"Maybe they won't--always,\" the old man thought.  Madeleine felt strangely disoriented, as though dreaming with delirious fever. All time and space seemed for a moment to be enclosed within that rocky space, itself unmoored and unhelmed upon a dark and compassless ocean.  Martians, Martians all around, but not a one to see. Like disembodied spirits, they had long ago evolved beyond confinement to fleshly bodies. But Earth people suspected there was something, so the younger ones, like Don, allowed suspicion to take any stereotyped, acceptable form. But the oldsters believed in being honest. Let those who can see--see.  \"Madeleine!\" Don was thinking, desperately, as desperate as only pure feeling can be. \"Go back--back to the Haven. You can still go back!\"  \"But she cannot,\" the old man said. \"For those who come this far, there's never anything to go back to.\"  \"No--I cannot,\" Madeleine thought. \"I don't want to go back.\"  \"All right,\" Don thought after a while. \"All right, Madeleine.\"  Then she was on her feet and moving over sand and stone that seemed alive toward the Ruins of Taovahr--but they were no longer ruins. She heard the murmur of sea-tides and warmer winds sighing over a younger land.  The sterile sand blossomed. Aridity drifted away. \"_Don! Is that you, Don?_\"  Don seemed to be somewhere, felt rather than heard, sensed, not seen. And instead of ruins, the high white walls and rising towers surrounded by gardens, fountains, and through the gardens a stream of clear water, soft with the pads of giant water lilies, trailing like glass under the moonlight and sympathetic shadows of leaves.  \"Don! You knew what real living was in your youth. It was way, way back in time. Didn't you? And only if you're really living do you know where you're going, and you knew, didn't you? You gave up the machines, and went on to freedom. You escaped the confining flesh that can be caught up in war, and in hopeless peonage to the radios and teevee and radar and thundering jets that drown out the song of real life, and a horde of cunningly made, treacherous machines--\"  \"Madeleine. Join us--the way we are now. You can do it--\"  \"I--I can't see you, Don.\"  \"You don't have to. You just think about it and join us, all of us--\"  \"Just--just a spirit of some kind, Don--is that it?\"  \"Yes, yes--something"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40969"],["title","The Mating of the Moons (#3)"],["body","that! You can't explain it! Just do it!\"  It was too late, she knew that now. \"We're old, too old, where I come from, Don. When I was very young, I might have done it.\" Only the wonder-filled child can go through the looking glass and--stay.  And he knew she was right, that she was too old. But the old man had promised her a moment of joy. She suddenly saw him--Don--the bright, strong man waiting across the stream. \"It's what you brought to me,\" he said softly. \"When we were young we looked this way--and we were real.\"  She moved toward the water and her arms lifted to him. At first she couldn't recognize the woman who bathed there. From the water's surface a slight vapor drifted, and she saw the wet gleam of naked arms as they lowered and raised and the water shone on the pale loveliness of unashamed nakedness. And then she knew that the woman there, her hair floating over the water, was Madeleine. She whispered her own name.  He took her in his arms, and she could hear her breath joining his as the mist drifted up among the buttressed writhings of the trees. She was laughing, her breasts pressed to the damp richness of the loam, and in the water she could see her face, white, with sharp shadows under the eyes and a high look of joy.  \"I love you, Madeleine.\"  His face was above her and his lips crushed to hers, and she could hear the stream flowing all around her like blood in her ears.  \"I love you, Madeleine.\"  A whisper went through the gray starlight that Mars was turning toward morning. And the waters of the mind drained away, leaving high and clear the common desire that stands like a drowned tower.  \"I love you, Madeleine.\"  She could hear it all fading away--her own joy, the fires--as if everything were melting, a wax candle dying, a wine glass draining, a soft light dimming....         *       *       *       *       *  They had found her by following the pathway left by bits of abandoned clothing. There was nothing but the rescue party and thousands of miles of waste around Madeleine where she lay in the ancient, dried-up creek bed. And she was shriveled and dried out and resembled, as Don had predicted, a mummy. But there was a kind of softness of repose on her face that hadn't been there before. Don stood back and looked down at her and thought about the waste.  Mr. Ericson ran forward in his purple shirt and fell to his knees whispering, \"Madeleine, we've found you! Madeleine--Madeleine--can't you hear your Daddy?\"  \"We give you anything you want,\" Don whispered, but no one heard him.  And while Mr. Ericson wept, Mrs. Ericson slumped into Don's arms as though it was the end of the world."]]]
