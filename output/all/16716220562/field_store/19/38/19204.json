It      is our great danger in India, and Lord Hardinge's prophecy,      that our biggest fight in India would be with our own army,      seems not unlikely to be realized, and that before long.      Native papers, education, and progress, are against keeping      200,000 native mercenaries in hand.\"  This is not the exact time a sane Commander-in-Chief, looking about for helpful persons, should choose for letting a certain Lieutenant Hodson, lately under a cloud, but, we hear, a smart officer, and of great knowledge concerning, and influence with natives, out of our reach. So thinks General Anson about the 5th of May, 1857, when Hodson, out of all patience at finding that Taylor's report has never reached the authorities at Calcutta, applies to him for leave to go to Calcutta to clear himself. However, by this time the ill-used lieutenant can afford to joke about his own misfortunes, and writes,--       \"There were clearly three courses open to me, 'à la Sir      Robert Peel.'       \"1st. Suicide.       \"2d. To resign the service in disgust, and join the enemy.       \"3d. To make the Governor-General eat his words, and      apologize.       \"I chose the last.       \"The first was too melodramatic and foreign; the second      would have been a triumph to my foes in the Punjaub;      besides, the enemy might have been beaten!       \"I have determined, therefore, on a trip to Calcutta.\"  Wherefore General Anson has interviews with this outrageous lieutenant; is \"most polite, even cordial,\" and \"while approving of my idea of going down to Calcutta, and thinking it plucky to undertake a journey of two thousand five hundred miles in such weather,\" thinks \"I had better wait till I hear again from him, for he will himself write to Lord Canning, and try to get justice done me.\"  In six days from this time India is in a blaze.  With the news of the outbreak come orders to the 1st European Fusileers to move down to Umbala, on the route to Delhi. They march the sixty miles in less than two days, but, on their arrival, find an unsatisfactory state of things:       \"Here,\" writes Hodson, \"alarm is the prevalent feeling, and      conciliation, of men with arms in their hands and in a state      of absolute rebellion, the order of the day. This system, if      pursued, is far more dangerous than anything the Sepoys can      do to us. I do trust the authorities will act with vigor,      else there is no knowing where the affair will end. Oh, for      Sir Charles now! The times are critical, but I have no fear      of aught save the alarm and indecision of our rulers.\"  The Commander-in-Chief arrives, and now, to Hodson's most naïve astonishment, which breaks out in the comicalest way in his letters, he regains all he has ever lost by one leap.       \"_May 17th._--Yesterday, I was sent for by the      Commander-in-Chief, and appointed Assistant      Quartermaster-General on his personal staff, to be under the      immediate orders of his Excellency, and with command to      raise one hundred horse and fifty foot, for service in the      Intelligence Department, and as personal escort. All this      was done, moreover, in a most complimentary way, and it is      quite in my line.\"  We can see clearly enough, from our own point of view, what has been at work for a lieutenant lately under a cloud. The plot thickens apace.  But who, at this juncture, will open the road to Meerut, from the general in command of which place we want papers and intelligence? The following extract from the letter of an officer stationed at that place will, perhaps, explain:--       \"When the mutiny broke out, our communications were      completely cut off. One night, on outlying picket at Meerut,      this subject being discussed, I said, 'Hodson is at Umbala,      I know; and I'll bet he will force his way through, and open      communications with the Commander-in-Chief and ourselves.'      At about three that night I heard my advanced sentries      firing. I rode off to see what was the matter, and they told      me that a party of the enemy's cavalry had approached their      post. When day broke, in galloped Hodson. He had left      Kurnâl (seventy-six miles off) at nine the night before,      with one led horse and an escort of Sikh cavalry, and, as I      had anticipated, here he was with despatches for Wilson. How      I quizzed him for approaching an armed post at night without      knowing the parole. Hodson rode straight to Wilson, had his      interview, a bath, breakfast, and two hours' sleep, and then      rode back the seventy-six miles, and had to fight his way      for about thirty miles of the distance.\"  The pace pleased the general, Hodson supposes, for \"he ordered me to raise a corps of Irregular Horse, and appointed me Commandant,\" but \"still no tidings from the hills,\" (where his wife is;) \"this is a terrible additional pull upon one's nerves at a time like this, and is a phase of war I never calculated on.\"  On the 27th of May the march towards Delhi begins, and Hodson accompanies, acting as Assistant Quartermaster-General attached to the Commander-in-Chief, \"with free access to him at any time, and to other people in authority, which gives me power for good. The Intelligence Department is mine exclusively, and I have for this line Sir Henry's old friend, the one-eyed Moulvie, Rujub Alee, so I shall get the best news in the country.\" He starts, too, happy about his wife from whom he has heard; the hill stations all safe, and likely to remain so.  General Anson dies of cholera, and General Barnard succeeds; still, oddly enough, no change takes place in our lieutenant's appointments. And so the little army marches, all too slowly, as the lieutenant thinks and remonstrates, upon Delhi. Other men are answering to the pressure of the times:--       \"Colonel T. Seaton and the other officers have gone to      Rohtuck with the 60th Native Infantry, who, I have no doubt,      will desert to a man as soon as they get there. It is very      plucky of him and the other officers to go; and very hard of      the authorities to send them; a half-hearted measure, and      very discreditable, in my opinion, to all concerned;      affording a painful contrast to Sir John Lawrence's bold and      decided conduct in this crisis. This regiment (1st      Fusileers) is a credit to any army, and the fellows are in      as high spirits and heart, and as plucky and free from      croaking as possible, and really do good to the whole force.       \"Alfred Light doing his work manfully and well....      Montgomery has come out very, very strong indeed; but many      are beginning to knock up already, and this is but the      beginning of this work, I fear; and before this business      ends, we who are, thank God, still young and strong, shall      alone be left in camp; all the elderly gentlemen will sink      under the fatigue and exposure.\"  _June 5th._--Head-quarters arrive at Aleepore, nearly at the end of our march, in fact one may say at the end, for on that day I rode right up to the Delhi parade-ground to reconnoitre, and the few sowars whom I met galloped away like mad at the sight of one white face. \"Had I had a hundred Guides with me I would have gone up to the very walls;\" and on June the 8th we occupy our position before Delhi, having driven the enemy out of their position; not without loss, for Colonel Chester is killed, Alfred Light (who won the admiration of all) wounded.... No one else of the staff party killed or wounded; but our general returns will, I fear, tell a sad tale. I am mercifully unhurt, and write this line in pencil on the top of a drum to assure you thereof.                   *       *       *       *       *  We must break the narrative here for a moment, now that we have got the combatants face to face, in the place of decision, to submit to our readers our own conviction that this same siege of Delhi, beginning on June 9th and ending triumphantly on September 22d, 1857, is _the_ feat of arms of which England has most cause to be proud. From Cressy to Sebastopol it has never been equalled. A mere handful of Englishmen, for half the time numbering less than three thousand, sat down in the open field, in the worst days of an Indian summer, without regular communications, (for the daks were only got carried by bribery, stage by stage,) without proper artillery, and last and worst of all, without able leading, before and took a city larger than Glasgow, garrisoned by an army trained by Englishmen, and numbering at first 20,000, in another ten days 37,000, and at last 75,000 men, supplied with all but exhaustless munitions of war, and in the midst of a nation in arms. \"I venture to aver,\" writes Hodson, \"that no other nation in the world would have remained here, or have avoided defeat, had they attempted to do so.\" We agree with him; and we do trust that the nation will come to look at the siege of Delhi in the right light, and properly to acknowledge and reward the few who remain of that band of heroes who saved British India.  Our readers must also remember that we are not giving the story of the siege, but the story of Hodson's part therein, and must therefore not think we are unduly putting him forward to the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39448"],["title","Twelve Years of a Soldier's Life in India (#5)"],["body","of other as glorious names. We would that we had the same means of following the life day by day of Nicholson and Chamberlain, Tombs and Light, Welchman, Showers, Home, Salkeld, or a hundred others equally gallant. But what we have is Hodson's life compiled from his daily letters to his wife. No doubt the work of the regulars was as important, perhaps even more trying, than that of the Captain of Irregular Cavalry, Assistant Quartermaster-General, and head of the Intelligence Department; but these were his duties, and not the others', and we shall now see how he fulfilled them.  On the first day of the siege \"the Guides\" march into camp:       \"It would have done your heart good to see the welcome they      gave me--cheering and shouting and crowding round me like      frantic creatures. They seized my bridle, dress, hands, and      feet, and literally threw themselves down before the horse      with the tears streaming down their faces. Many officers who      were present hardly knew what to make of it, and thought the      creatures were mobbing me; and so they were--but for joy,      not for mischief.\"  \"Burrah Serai-wallah,\" they shouted, (\"great in battle\" in the vulgar tongue,) making the staff and others open their eyes, who do not much believe, for their part, in the power of any Englishman really to attach to himself any native rascals.  Next day, June 10th, the ball opens. The mutineers march out in force and attack our position:       \"I had command of all the troops on our right, the gallant      Guides among the rest. They followed me, with a cheer for      their old commander, and behaved with their usual pluck, and      finally we drove the enemy in with loss.... Indeed, I did      _not_ expose myself unnecessarily; for having to direct the      movements of three or four regiments, I could not be in the      front as much as I wished.\"  But wives will be anxious, my lieutenant, and making all just allowances, it must be confessed that you give her fair cause:       \"The warmth of the reception again given me by the Guides      was quite affecting, and has produced a great sensation in      camp, and had a good effect on our native troops, insomuch      that they are more willing to obey their European officers      when they see their own countrymen's enthusiasm.       \"My position is Assistant Quartermaster-General on the      Commander-in-Chief's personal staff. I am responsible for      the Intelligence Department, and in the field, or when      anything is going on for directing the movements of the      troops in action, under the immediate orders of the      general.\"  Again, on June 12th, we are at it:--       \"A sharp fight for four hours, ending as usual. They have      never yet been so punished as to-day. The Guides behaved      admirably, so did the Fusileers as usual. I am vexed much at      the _Lahore Chronicle butter_, and wish people would leave      me alone in the newspapers. The best butter I get is the      deference and respect I meet with from all whose respect I      care for, and the affectionate enthusiasm of the Guides,      which increases instead of lessening.\"  But this daily repulsing attacks cannot be allowed to go on: cannot we have something to say to attacking them? So the general thinks, and sets Greathed, assisted by me and two more engineers, to submit a plan for taking Delhi.       \"We drew up our scheme and gave it to the general, who      highly approved, and will, I trust, carry it out; but how      times must be changed, when four subalterns are called upon      to suggest a means of carrying out so vitally important an      enterprise as this, one on which the safety of the empire      depends!\"  Simple but \"perfectly feasible\" plan of four subalterns: blow open gates with powder, and go in with bayonet, and that there may be no mistake about it, I volunteer to lead the assault (wholly unmindful of that assurance given to a loving heart in the hills that I am _not_ exposing myself) and fix on a small building in front of the gate as the rendezvous, which is now called \"Hodson's Mosque.\"  General approves, and orders assault for the morning of June 13th. Alas for our \"perfectly feasible\" plan!       \"We were to have taken Delhi by assault last night, but a      'mistake of orders' (?) as to the right time of bringing the      troops to the rendezvous prevented its execution. I am much      annoyed and disappointed at our plan not having been carried      out, because I am confident it would have been successful.      The rebels were cowed, and perfectly ignorant of any      intention of so bold a stroke on our part as an assault; the      surprise would have done everything.\"  Next day there is another fight. A council of war. Our plan is still approved, but put off from day to day. Abandoned at last, we are to wait for reinforcements. Poor \"feasible plan!\"       \"It was frustrated the first night by the fears and absolute      disobedience of orders of ----, the man who first lost      Delhi, and has now by folly prevented its being recaptured.      The general has twice since wished and even ordered it, but      has always been thwarted by some one or other; latterly by      that old woman ----, who has come here for nothing      apparently but as an obstacle; ---- is also a crying evil to      us. The general knows this and wants to get rid of him, but      has not the nerve to supersede him. The whole state of      affairs here is bad to a degree.\"  And here I am (June 19th), with fights going on every day, knocked down with bronchitis and inflammation of the chest, \"really very ill for some hours.\" \"The general nurses me as if I were his son. I woke in the night and found the kind old man by my bedside covering me carefully up from the draught.\" But on June 20th (bronchitis notwithstanding) I am up and at work again, for the Sepoys have attacked our rear to-day, and though beaten as usual, Colonel Becher (Quartermaster-General) is shot through right arm, and Daly (commanding Guides) hit through the shoulder. So the whole work of the Quartermaster-General's office is on me, and the general begs me as a personal favor to take command of Guides in addition. I at first refused, but the general was most urgent, putting it on the ground that the service was at stake, and none was so fit, &c. &c. I do feel that we are bound to do our best just now to put things on a proper footing; and after consulting Seaton and Norman, I accepted the command. How ---- will gnash his teeth to see me leading my dear old Guides again in the field.  And so we fight on, literally day by day, for now \"our artillery officers themselves say they are outmatched by these rascals in accuracy and rapidity of fire; and as they have unlimited supplies of guns, &c., they are quite beyond us in many respects. We are, in point of fact, reduced to merely holding our own ground till we get more men.\" Still we don't feel at all like giving in.       \"The wounded generally are doing well, poor fellows,      considering the heat, dirt, and want of any bed but the dry      ground. Their pluck is wonderful, and it is not in the field      alone that you see what an English soldier is made of. One      poor fellow who was smoking his pipe and laughing with the      comrade by his side, was asked, what was the matter with      him, and he answered in a lively voice, 'Oh, not much, Sir,      only a little knock on the back; I shall be up and at the      rascals again in a day or two.' He had been shot in the      spine, and all his lower limbs were paralyzed. He died next      day. Colonel Welchman is about again; too soon, I fear, but      there is no keeping the brave old man quiet. Poor Peter      Brown is very badly wounded, but he is cheerful, and bears      up bravely. Jacob has 'come out' wonderfully. He is cool,      active, and bold, keeps his wits about him under fire, and      does altogether well. We are fortunate in having him with      the force. Good field-officers are very scarce indeed; I do      not wonder at people at a distance bewailing the delay in      the taking of Delhi. No one not on the spot can appreciate      the difficulties in the way, or the painful truth, that      those difficulties increase upon us.\"  I am rather out of sorts still myself, also. It is a burden to me to stand or walk, and the excessive heat makes it difficult for me to recover from that sharp attack of illness. \"The doctors urge me to go away for a little, to get strength--as if I could leave just now, or as if I would if I could.\" ... So I am in the saddle all day, (June 24th,) though obliged occasionally to rest a bit where I can find shelter, and one halt is by Alfred Light.       \"It does me good to see the 'Light of the ball-room' working      away at his guns, begrimed with dust and heat, ever cheery      and cool, though dead beat from fatigue and exposure. How      our men fought to-day; liquid fire was no name for the      fervent heat; but nothing less than a knock-down blow from      sun, sword, or bullet, stops a British soldier.\"  My glorious old regiment! how they have suffered in this short three weeks; Colonel Welchman badly hit in the arm, Greville down with fever, Wriford with dysentery, Dennis with sunstroke, Brown with wounds.       \"Jacob and the 'boys' have all the work to themselves, and      well indeed do the boys behave--with a courage and coolness      which would not disgrace veterans. Little Tommy Butler,      Owen, Warner, all behave like heroes, albeit with sadly      diminishing numbers to lead. Neville Chamberlain is come in,      who ought to be worth a thousand men to us.\"  Those rascals actually came out to-day (June 25th), in their red coats and medals!       \"We are not very well off, _quant à la cuisine_. I never had      so much trouble in getting anything fit to eat, except when      I dine with the general. Colonel Seaton lives in my tent, "]]]
