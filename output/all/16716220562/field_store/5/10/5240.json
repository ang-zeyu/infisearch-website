And for some reason he did not care to visit the farm buildings until it grew darker.  So he amused himself by making the woods echo with his strange cry, “_Whoo-whoo-whoo, whoo-whoo, to-whoo-ah!_” And now and then he threw in a few “_wha-whas_,” just for extra measure.  Many of the forest folk who heard him remarked that Solomon Owl seemed to be in extra fine spirits.  “Probably it’s the hunter’s moon that pleases him!” Jimmy Rabbit remarked to a friend of his. “I’ve always noticed that old Solomon makes more noise on moonlight nights than at any other time.”  The hunter’s moon, big and yellow and round, was just rising over Blue Mountain. But for once it was not the moon that made Solomon Owl so talkative. He was in fine feather, so to speak, because he was hoping to have a fat pullet for his supper. And as for the moon, he would have been just as pleased had there been none at all that night. For Solomon Owl never cared to be seen when he visited Farmer Green’s chicken house.     VII The Blazing Eyes   It was some three hours after sunset when Solomon Owl at last reached Farmer Green’s place. All was quiet in the chicken house because the hens and roosters and their families had long since gone to roost. And except for a light that shone through a window, the farmhouse showed not a sign of life.  Everything was as Solomon Owl wished it—or so he thought, at least, as he alighted in a tree in the yard to look about him. He wanted no one to interrupt him when he should go nosing around the chicken house, to find an opening.  To his annoyance, he had not sat long in the tree when the wood-shed door opened. And Solomon stared in amazement at the strange sight he saw.  A great head appeared, with eyes and mouth—yes! and nose, too—all a glaring flame color. Solomon had never seen such a horrible face on man or bird or beast. But he was sure it was a man, for he heard a laugh that was not to be mistaken for either a beast’s or a bird’s. And the worst of it was, those blazing eyes were turned squarely toward Farmer Green’s chicken house!  Solomon Owl was too wary to go for his fat pullet just then. He decided that he would wait quietly in the tree for a time, hoping that the man would go away.  While Solomon watched him the stranger neither moved nor spoke. And, of course, Solomon Owl was growing hungrier every minute. So at last he felt that he simply _must_ say something.  “Who-who-who-are-you?” he called out from his tree.  But the strange man did not answer. He did not even turn his head.  “He must be some city person,” Solomon Owl said to himself. “He thinks he’s too good to speak to a countryman like me.”  Then Solomon sat up and listened. He heard a scratching sound. And soon he saw a plump figure crawl right up into his tree-top.  It was Fatty Coon!  “What are you doing here?” Solomon Owl asked in a low voice, which was not any too pleasant.  “I’m out for an airing,” Fatty answered. “Beautiful night—isn’t it?”  But Solomon Owl was not interested in the weather. “I don’t suppose you’ve come down here to get a chicken, have you?” he inquired.  Fatty Coon seemed greatly surprised at the question.  “Why—no!” he exclaimed. “But now that you speak of it, it reminds me that Farmer Green’s saving a pullet for me. He was heard to say not long ago that he would like to catch me taking one of his hens. So he must have one for me. And I don’t want to disappoint him.”  At first Solomon Owl didn’t know what answer to make. But at last he turned his head toward Fatty.  “Why don’t you go and get your pullet now?” he asked.  “There’s that man down below, with the glaring eyes—” said Fatty Coon. “I’ve been waiting around here for quite a long time and he hasn’t looked away from the chicken house even once.... Do you know him?”  “No! And I don’t want to!” said Solomon Owl.  “S-sh!” Fatty Coon held up a warning hand. “Who’s that?” he asked, peering down at a dark object at the foot of their tree.  Then both he and Solomon saw that it was Tommy Fox, sitting on his haunches and staring at the big head, with its blazing eyes and nose and mouth.  “Not looking for chickens, I suppose?” Solomon Owl called in a low tone, which was hardly more than a whisper.  But Tommy Fox’s sharp ears heard him easily. And he looked up, licking his chops as if he were very hungry indeed. And all the while the stranger continued to stare straight at the chicken house, as if he did not intend to let anybody go  prowling about that long, low building to steal any of Farmer Green’s poultry.  It was no wonder that the three chicken-lovers (two in the tree and one beneath it) hesitated. If the queer man had only spoken they might not have been so timid. But he said never a word.     VIII Watching The Chickens   Solomon Owl and Fatty Coon couldn’t help laughing at what Tommy Fox said to them, as they sat in their tree near the farmhouse, looking down at him in the moonlight.  “I’m here to watch Farmer Green’s chickens for him—” said he—“to see that no rat—or anybody else—runs away with a pullet.”  “Farmer Green has someone else watching for him to-night,” said Solomon Owl, when he had stopped laughing. “There’s that strange man! You can see how he keeps his glaring eyes fixed on the chicken house. And unless I’m mistaken, he’s on the lookout for _you_.”  “No such thing!” Tommy Fox snapped. And he looked up at Solomon as if he wished that he could climb the tree.  “Here comes somebody else!” Fatty Coon exclaimed suddenly. His keen eyes had caught sight of Jimmy Rabbit, hopping along on his way to the vegetable garden, to see if he couldn’t find a stray cabbage or a turnip.  Solomon Owl called to him. Whereupon, Jimmy Rabbit promptly sat up and looked at the odd trio. If it hadn’t been for Tommy Fox he would have drawn nearer.  “Do you know that stranger?” Solomon Owl asked him, pointing out the horrible head to Jimmy.  “I haven’t the pleasure,” said Jimmy Rabbit, after he had taken a good look.  “Well,” said Solomon, “won’t you kindly speak to him; and ask him to go away?”  “Certainly!” answered Jimmy Rabbit, who always tried to be obliging.  “I hope the stranger won’t eat him,” remarked Tommy Fox, “because I hope to do that some day, myself.”  It was queer—but Jimmy Rabbit was the only one of the four that wasn’t afraid of those glaring features. He hopped straight up to the big round head, which was just a bit higher than one of the fence posts, against which the stranger seemed to be leaning. And after a moment or two Jimmy Rabbit called to Solomon and Fatty and Tommy Fox:  “He won’t go away! He’s going to stay right where he is!”  “Come here a minute!” said Tommy.  Jimmy Rabbit shook his head.  “You come over here!” he answered. And he did not stir from the side of the stranger. He knew very well that Tommy Fox was afraid of the man with the head with the glaring eyes.  As for Tommy Fox, he did not even reply—that is, to Jimmy Rabbit. But he spoke his mind freely enough to his two friends in the tree.  “It seems to me one of you ought to do something,” said he. “We’ll eat no pullets to-night if we can’t get rid of this meddlesome stranger.”  Fatty Coon quite agreed with him.  “The one who was here first is the one to act!” Fatty declared. “That’s _you!_” he told Solomon Owl.  So Solomon Owl felt most uncomfortable.  “I don’t know what I can do,” he said. “I spoke to the stranger—asked him who he was. And he wouldn’t answer me.”  “Can’t you frighten him away?” Tommy Fox inquired. “Fly right over his head and give him a blow with your wing as you pass!”  Solomon Owl coughed. He was embarrassed, to say the least.  “He’s afraid!” Fatty Coon cried. And both he and Tommy Fox kept repeating, over and over again, “He’s afraid! He’s afraid! He’s afraid!”  It was really more than Solomon Owl could stand.  “I’m not!” he retorted angrily. “Watch me and you’ll see!” And without another word he darted out of the tree and swooped down upon the stranger, just brushing the top of his head. Solomon Owl knew at once that he had knocked something off the top of that dreadful head—something that fell to the ground and made Jimmy Rabbit jump nervously.  Then Solomon returned to his perch in the tree.  “He hasn’t moved,” he said. “But I knocked off his hat.”  “You took off the top of his head!” cried Fatty Coon in great excitement. “Look! The inside of his head is afire.”  And peering down from the tree-top, Solomon Owl saw that Fatty Coon had told the truth.     IX Hallowe’en   Solomon Owl was afraid of fire. And when he looked down from his perch in the tree and saw, through the hole in the stranger’s crown, that all was aglow inside his big, round head, Solomon couldn’t help voicing his horror. He “_whoo-whooed_” so loudly that Tommy Fox, at the foot of the tree, asked him what on earth was the matter.  “His head’s all afire!” Solomon Owl told him. “That’s what makes his eyes glare so. And that’s why the fire shines through his mouth and his nose, too. It’s no wonder he didn’t answer my question—for, of course, his tongue must certainly be burned to a cinder.”  “Then it ought to be safe for anybody to enter the chicken house,” Tommy Fox observed. “What could the stranger do, when he’s in such a fix?”  “He could set the chicken house afire, if he followed you inside,” replied Solomon Owl wisely. “And I, for one, am not going near the pullets to-night.”  “Nor I!” Fatty Coon echoed. “I’m going straight to the cornfield. The corn is still standing there in shocks; and I ought to find enough ears to make a good meal.”  But Solomon Owl and Tommy Fox were not interested in corn. They never ate it. And so it is not surprising that they should be greatly disappointed. After a person has his mouth all made up for chicken it is hard to think of anything that would taste even half as good.  “It’s queer he doesn’t go and hold his head under the pump,” said Solomon Owl. “That’s what I should"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16663"],["title","The Tale of Solomon Owl (#3)"],["body",", if I were he.”  “Jimmy Rabbit had better not go too near him, or he’ll get singed,” said Tommy Fox, anxiously. “I don’t want anything to happen to _him_.”  “Jimmy Rabbit is very careless,” Solomon declared. “I don’t see what he’s thinking of—going so near a fire! It makes me altogether too nervous to stay here. And I’m going away at once.”  Tommy Fox said that he felt the same way. And the moment Fatty Coon, with his sharp claws, started to crawl down the tree on his way to the cornfield, Tommy Fox hurried off without even stopping to say good-bye.  “_Haw-haw-haw-hoo!_” laughed Solomon Owl. “Tommy Fox is afraid of you!” he told Fatty Coon.  But Fatty didn’t seem to hear him. He was thinking only of the supper of corn that he was going to have.  “Better come away!” Solomon Owl called to Jimmy Rabbit, turning his head toward the fence where Jimmy had been lingering near the hot-headed stranger.  But Jimmy Rabbit didn’t answer him, either. He was no longer there. The moment he had seen Tommy Fox bounding off across the meadow Jimmy had started at once for Farmer Green’s vegetable garden.  So Solomon Owl was the last to leave.  “There’s really nothing else I can do,” he remarked to himself. “I don’t know what Aunt Polly Woodchuck would say if she knew that I didn’t follow her advice to-night and eat a pullet for my supper.... But I’ve tried my best.... And that’s all anybody can do.”  Solomon Owl was upset all the rest of that night. And just before daybreak he visited the farmyard again, to see whether the strange man with the flaring head still watched the chicken house. And Solomon found that he had vanished.  So Solomon Owl alighted on the fence. There was nothing there except a hollowed-out pumpkin, with a few holes cut in it, which someone had left on one of the fence-posts.  “Good!” said he. “Maybe I can get my pullet after all!” He turned to fly to the chicken house. But just then the woodshed door opened again. And Farmer Green stepped outside, with a lantern in his hand. He was going to the barn to milk the cows. But Solomon Owl did not wait to learn anything more.  He hurried away to his house among the hemlocks. And having quickly settled himself for a good nap, he was soon fast asleep.  That was how Johnnie Green’s jack-o’-lantern kept Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon and Solomon Owl from taking any chickens on Hallowe’en.     X A Troublesome Wishbone   Solomon Owl had pains—sharp pains—underneath his waistcoat. And not knowing what else to do, he set off at once for Aunt Polly Woodchuck’s house under the hill, in the pasture, which he had not visited since the previous fall. Luckily, he found the old lady at home. And quickly he told her of his trouble.  “What have you been eating?” she inquired.  “I’ve followed your advice. I’ve been eating chickens,” said he—“very small chickens, because they were all I could get.”  Aunt Polly Woodchuck, who was an herb doctor—and a good one—regarded him through her spectacles.  “I’m afraid,” said she, “you don’t chew your food properly. Bolting one’s food is very harmful. It’s as bad as not eating anything at all, almost.”  Solomon Owl showed plainly that her remark surprised him.  “Why,” he exclaimed, “I always swallow my food whole—when it isn’t too big!”  “Gracious me!” cried Aunt Polly, throwing up both her hands. “It’s no wonder you’re ill. It’s no wonder you have pains; and now I know exactly what’s the matter with you. You have a wishbone inside you. I can feel it!” she told him, as she prodded him in the waistcoat.  “I wish you could get it out for me!” said Solomon with a look of distress.  “All the wishing in the world won’t help you,” she answered, “unless we can find some way of removing the wishbone so you can wish on that. Then I’m sure you would feel better at once.”  “This is strange,” Solomon mused. “All my life I’ve been swallowing my food without chewing it. And it has never given me any trouble before.... What shall I do?”  “Don’t eat anything for a week,” she directed. “And fly against tree-trunks as hard as you can. Then come back here after seven days.”  Solomon Owl went off in a most doleful frame of mind. It seemed to him that he had never seen so many mice and frogs and chipmunks as he came across during the following week. But he didn’t dare catch a single one, on account of what Aunt Polly Woodchuck had said.  His pains, however, grew less from day to day—at least, the pains that had first troubled him. But he had others to take their place. Hunger pangs, these were! And they were almost as bad as those that had sent him hurrying to see Aunt Polly Woodchuck.  On the whole, Solomon passed a very unhappy week. Flying head foremost into tree-trunks (as Aunt Polly had instructed him to do) gave him many bumps and bruises. So he was glad when the time came for him to return to her house in the pasture.  Solomon’s neighbors had been so interested in watching him that they were all sorry when he ceased his strange actions. Indeed, there was a rumor that Solomon had become very angry with Farmer Green and that he was trying to knock down some of Farmer Green’s trees. Before the end of that unpleasant week Solomon had often noticed as many as twenty-four of the forest folk following him about, hoping to see a tree fall.  But they were all disappointed. However, they enjoyed the sight of Solomon hurling himself against tree-trunks. And the louder he groaned, the more people gathered around him.     XI Cured At Last   “How do you feel now?” Aunt Polly Woodchuck asked Solomon Owl, when he had come back to her house after a week’s absence.  “No better!” he groaned. “I still have pains. But they seem to have moved and scattered all over me.”  “Good!” she exclaimed with a smile. “You are much better, though you didn’t know it. The wishbone is broken. You broke it by flying against the trees. And you ought not to have any more trouble. But let me examine you!” she said, prodding him in the waistcoat once more.  “This is odd!” she continued a bit later. “I can feel the wishbone more plainly than ever.”  “That’s my own wishbone!” Solomon cried indignantly. “I’ve grown so thin through not eating that it’s a wonder you can’t feel my backbone, too.”  Aunt Polly Woodchuck looked surprised.  “Perhaps you’re right!” said she. “Not having a wishbone of my own, I forgot that you had one.”  A look of disgust came over Solomon Owl’s face.  “You’re a very poor doctor,” he told her. “Here you’ve kept me from eating for a whole week—and I don’t believe it was necessary at all!”  “Well, you’re better, aren’t you?” she asked him.  “I shall be as soon as I have a good meal,” replied Solomon Owl, hopefully.  “You ought not to eat anything for another week,” Aunt Polly told him solemnly.  “Nonsense!” he cried.  “I’m a doctor; and I ought to know best,” she insisted.  But Solomon Owl hooted rudely.  “I’ll never come to you for advice any more,” he declared. “I firmly believe that my whole trouble was simply that I’ve been eating too sparingly. And I shall take good care to see that it doesn’t happen again.”  No one had ever spoken to Aunt Polly in quite that fashion—though old Mr. Crow had complained one time that she had cured him _too quickly_. But she did not lose her temper, in spite of Solomon’s jeers.  “You’ll be back here again the very next time you’re ill,” she remarked. “And if you continue to swallow your food whole——”  But Solomon Owl did not even wait to hear what she said. He was so impolite that he flew away while she was talking. And since it was then almost dark, and a good time to look for field mice, he began his night’s hunting right there in Farmer Green’s pasture.  By morning Solomon was so plump that Aunt Polly Woodchuck would have had a good deal of trouble finding his wishbone. But since he did not visit her again, she had no further chance to prod him in the waistcoat.  Afterward, Solomon heard a bit of gossip that annoyed him. A friend of his reported that Aunt Polly Woodchuck was going about and telling everybody how she had saved Solomon’s life.  “Mice!” he exclaimed (he often said that when some would have said “Rats!”). “There’s not a word of truth in her claim. And if people in this neighborhood keep on taking her advice and her catnip tea they’re going to be sorry some day. For they’ll be really ill the first thing they know. And then what will they do?”     XII Benjamin Bat   Solomon Owl was by no means the only night-prowler in Pleasant Valley. He had neighbors that chose to sleep in the daytime, so they might roam through the woods and fields after dark. One of these was Benjamin Bat. And furthermore, he was the color of night itself.  Now, Benjamin Bat was an odd chap. When he was still he liked to hang by his feet, upside down. And when he was flying he sailed about in a zigzag, helter-skelter fashion. He went in so many different directions, turning this way and that, one could never tell where he was going. One might say that his life was just one continual dodge—when he wasn’t resting with his heels where his head ought to be.  A good many of Benjamin Bat’s friends said he certainly must be crazy, because he didn’t do as they did. But that never made the slightest difference in Benjamin Bat’s habits. He continued to zigzag through life—and hang by his heels—just the same. Perhaps he thought that all other people were crazy because they didn’t do likewise.  Benjamin often dodged across Solomon Owl’s path, when Solomon was hunting for field mice. And since Benjamin was the least bit like a mouse himself—except for his wings—there was a time, once, when Solomon tried to catch him.  But Solomon Owl soon found that chasing Benjamin Bat made him dizzy. If Benjamin hadn’t been used to hanging head downward, maybe he would have been dizzy, too.  Though the two often saw each other, Benjamin Bat never seemed to care to stop for a chat with Solomon Owl. One night, however, Benjamin actually called to Solomon and asked his advice. He was in"]]]
