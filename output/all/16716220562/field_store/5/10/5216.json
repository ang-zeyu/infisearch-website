With a blood-curdling cry they leaped forward, and, seizing one of Zeb's legs, tried to drag him from the horse's back.  The yells of the Indians were as nothing to those that Zeb then let loose! The air was fairly split by blood-curdling shrieks, and the horse, terrified in turn, leaped forward, tearing Zeb from the grasp of the Indian and almost unseating Dan by the jerk. But Dan dug his knees into the horse's sides, flung his arms about her neck, and, holding on for dear life, tore away up the trail with Zeb clinging like a limpet to his waist.  Never was a ride like that. Even John Gilpin's was a mild performance beside it, for Zeb shrieked every minute of the way as they sped along, with the horse's tail streaming out behind like the tail of a comet, and the daylight showing between the bouncing boys and Penny's back at every wild leap. Even if Daniel had not been minded to obey his father's command, he could not have helped himself, for Penny took matters into her own four hoofs, and never paused in her wild career until, covered with foam, she dashed madly into a little hamlet where the village of Neponset now stands.  Samuel Kittredge was just starting for the forest with his axe on his shoulder, when his ears were smitten by the frantic shrieks of Zeb, and, thinking it must be a wildcat on the edge of the clearing, he started back to the house for his gun. Before he reached it, Penitence, with the two boys on her back, came thundering toward him at full gallop, and stopped at his side.  \"What in tarnation is the matter with ye?\" he exclaimed, gazing in amazement at the strange apparition. \"I declare for it, that nigger is all but scared plumb white! What ails ye?\"  \"Indians!\" gasped Dan, pointing toward the trail. \"My father--quick!\" No more words were needed. Samuel Kittredge dashed into his house, snatched his gun from the chimney, and, dashing out again, fired it into the air. Poor Zeb! He slid off over the horse's tail on to the ground and lay there in a heap, while a knot of men, responding to the signal of Sam Kittredge's gun, gathered hurriedly before his house and started at once down the trail.  \"You stay here,\" said Sam to Dan as he started away. \"We 'll be back soon with your father if the pesky red-skins have n't got him.\"  \"Or if they have,\" added another man grimly, and off they went.  Goodwife Kittredge now took charge of Dan and Zeb, while her son, a boy of eleven, tied Penny to a tree beside their cabin. Zeb recovered at once when she offered him a generous slice of brown-bread, but Dan was too anxious about his father to eat. He stood beside Penny, rubbing her neck and soothing her, with his eyes constantly on the trail and his ears eagerly listening for the sound of shots. It seemed an age, but really was not more than half an hour, before he saw the men come out of the woods, and, oh joy! his father was with them!  Leaving Penny nibbling grass, he ran to meet them and threw his arms about his father's neck, crying, \"Oh, dear father, art thou hurt?\"  \"Nay; the Lord was merciful,\" answered the Goodman. \"I fired but one shot, and hit one of the red-skins, I am sure, for they both dived back into the woods at once. I hid myself in the thick underbrush on the other side of the trail and waited, thinking perhaps I could creep along beside it out of sight, but Zeb's roaring must have frighted the Indians. Doubtless they knew it would rouse the countryside. At any rate I saw no more of them, and when these Good Samaritans came along I knew I was safe.\"  \"The lungs of that blackamoor are worth more to thee than many guns,\" laughed Sam Kittredge. \"'T is a pity thou couldst not bottle up a few of his screeches to take with thee when thou goest abroad. They are of a sort to make a wildcat sick with envy.\" The men laughed heartily, and, leaving the Goodman and Daniel with Sam, returned to their interrupted tasks.  Goodwife Kittredge insisted on their resting there for the night before resuming their journey. \"You must be proper tired,\" said she, with motherly concern, \"and if you go on now 't is more than likely those rascally knaves will follow you like your shadow. You 'll stand a sight better chance of safety if you make an early start in the morning.\"  \"Your horse needs rest, too,\" added Sam. \"I 'll rub her down and give her a measure of corn when she 's cooled off. Get to bed with the chickens, and start with the sun, and to-morrow night will find you safe in your own home again.\"  To this plan the travelers gladly agreed. Early next morning, after a hearty breakfast in the Kittredges' cheerful kitchen they set forth once more. The roosters in the farmyard were still crowing, and the air was sweet with the music of robins, orioles, and blackbirds when they again plunged into the forest trail. All day they plodded steadily along, delayed by bad roads, and it was not until late that evening that they at last came in sight of the little house, where Nancy and her mother slept, little dreaming how near they were to a happy awakening. When, at last they reached the cabin, the Goodman, fearing to alarm his wife, stopped on the door-stone and gently called her name. He had called but once when a shutter was thrown open and the Goodwife's head was thrust through it.  \"Husband, son!\" she cried joyfully. \"Nancy!--awake child!--it is thy father and brother!\" and in another moment the door flew open, and Nancy and her mother flung their arms about the necks of the wanderers. When the horse had been cared for, they went into the cabin. Nancy raked the coals from the ashes, the fire blazed up, and the Goodwife gave them each a drink of hot milk. Zeb blinked sleepily at the reunited and happy family, as Dan and his father told their adventures, and when at last they had gone to their beds in the loft he sank down on a husk mattress which the Goodwife had spread for him on the floor, and in two minutes was sound asleep.  [Illustration]     V  THE NEW HOME   Goodman Pepperell and his wife rose early the next morning, and, leaving the two children still sleeping; crept down the ladder to the floor below. There lay Zeb, also sound asleep, with his toes toward the ashes like a little black Cinderella. The Goodwife's mother heart was stirred with pity as she looked down at him. Perhaps she imagined her own boy a captive in a strange land, unable to speak the language, with no future but slavery and no friends to comfort his loneliness.  \"Poor lad--let him sleep a bit, too,\" she said to her husband.  They unbolted the door and stepped out into the sunlight of a perfect June morning. The dew was still on the grass; robins and bobolinks were singing merrily in the young apple trees, which, owing to a late, cold spring, were still in bloom, and the air hummed with the music of bees' wings.  The Goodman drew a deep breath as he gazed at the beauty about him. \"'T is good to be at home again,\" he said to his wife. \"And 't is a goodly land--aye, better even than old England! There 's space here, room enough to grow.\" He looked across the river to the hills of Boston town. \"I doubt not we shall live to see a city in place of yon village,\" he said; \"more ships seek its port daily, and there are settlements along the whole length of the bay. 'T is a marvel where the people come from. The Plymouth folk are scattering to the north and south, and already villages are springing up between Plymouth and New Amsterdam. God hath prospered us, wife.\"  \"Praise be to his holy name,\" said the Goodwife, reverently. \"But, husband,\" she added, \"what shall we do with our increase? Thou hast brought home a horse and the black lad. The horse can stay out of doors during the summer, but there is not room for him in the cow-shed, and the lad cannot sleep always before the fire.\"  \"I have thought of that,\" said the Goodman, \"and when the crops are in I purpose to build a larger house.\"  \"Verily it will be needed,\" she answered. \"The crops grow like weeds in this new soil. If there were but a place for storage, I could put away much for winter use that now is wasted. Go thou and look at the garden, while I uncover the coals and set the kettle to boil.\"  \"Wait a moment, wife,\" said the Goodman, \"I have somewhat to tell thee. There is ever a black spot in our sunshine. Though the danger grows less all the while as the settlements increase, it is still true that the Indians are ever a menace, and I fear they are over watchful of us.\" Then he told her of the attack in the forest. \"I have reason to think the red-skins spied upon us all the way to Boston town,\" he finished. \"I did not tell Daniel, but twice I saw savages on our trail after we left Kittredge's. I wounded one in the encounter, and they will not forget that. I know not why they should plot against the black boy, unless it is to revenge themselves upon me, but it is certain they tried to drag him away with them into the woods.\" The Goodwife listened with a pale face.  \"'T is well, then, that we have a watchdog added to our possessions,\" she said at last. \"Gran'ther Wattles's shepherd hath a litter of pups, and he hath promised one to the children. Nancy hath waited until Dan came home that he might share the pleasure of getting it with her.\"  \"She hath a generous heart,\" said her father, tenderly. \"Aye,--she is a good lass, though headstrong.\"  When their mother reached the cabin, she found the Twins up and dressed and Daniel trying to rouse the sleeping Zeb. \"Wake up,\" he shouted, giving him a shake. Zeb rolled over with a grunt and opened his eyes.  \"Take him outdoors while I get breakfast,\" said the Goodwife. \"Mercy upon me, what shall I do with a blackamoor and a dog both underfoot!\"  \"A dog!\" cried Daniel. \"What dog? Where is he?\"  \"Nancy will tell thee,\" said his mother, and, not able to wait a moment to hear and tell such wonderful news, the two children rushed out at once, followed by Zeb. When their mother called the family to breakfast half an hour later, Zeb"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16645"],["title","Sermons Preached at Brighton (#0)"],["body","Team at https://www.pgdp.net                                         SERMONS                         _PREACHED AT BRIGHTON._                                BY THE LATE                       REV.

HEBREWS xi. 8-10.--\"By faith Abraham, when he was called to    go out into a place which he should after receive for an    inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.    By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange    country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs    with him of the same promise: for he looked for a city which hath    foundations, whose builder and maker is God.\"                    77    SERMON VII.

THE SACRIFICE OF CHRIST.   2 COR. v. 14, 15.--\"For the love of Christ constraineth us;    because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all    dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not    henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them,    and rose again.\"                                                 90    SERMON VIII.

CHRISTIAN CASUISTRY.   1 COR. vii. 18-24.--\"Is any man called being circumcised?    let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision?    let him not be circumcised. Circumcision is nothing, and    uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of    God. Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.    Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou    mayest be made free use it rather. For he that is called in the    Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman; likewise also he that    is called being free, is Christ's servant. Ye are bought with a    price; be not ye the servants of men. Brethren, let every man    wherein he is called therein abide with God.\"                   156    SERMON XIV.

MARRIAGE AND CELIBACY.   1 COR. vii. 29-31.--\"But this I say, brethren, the time is    short: it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though    they had none; and they that weep as though they wept not; and they    that rejoice as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as    though they possessed not; and they that use this world as not    abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.\"        169    SERMON XV.   Preached January 11, 1852.   THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH A FAMILY.

THE LAW OF CHRISTIAN CONSCIENCE.   1 COR. viii. 7-13.--\"Howbeit there is not in every man that    knowledge: for some, with conscience of the idol, unto this hour,    eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being    weak is defiled. But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither if    we eat are we the better; neither if we eat not are we the worse.    But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a    stumbling-block to them that are weak. For if any man see thee    which hast knowledge, sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not    the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those    things which are offered to idols; and through thy knowledge shall    the weak brother perish for whom Christ died? But when ye sin so    against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against    Christ. Wherefore if meat make my brother to offend I will eat no    flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.\"                                                                    196    SERMON XVII.

ISAIAH lvii. 15.--\"For thus saith the High and Lofty One    that inhabiteth Eternity, whose Name is Holy. I dwell in the high    and holy place--with him also that is of a contrite and humble    spirit.\"                                                        230    SERMON XIX.   Preached June 27, 1852.   THE LAWFUL AND UNLAWFUL USE OF LAW. (A FRAGMENT.)   1 TIM. i. 8.--\"But we know that the law is good, if a man    use it lawfully.\"                                               246    SERMON XX.   Preached February 21, 1853.   THE PRODIGAL AND HIS BROTHER.   LUKE xv. 31, 32.--\"And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever    with me, and all that I have is thine. It was meet that we should    make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is    alive again; was lost, and is found.\"                           253    SERMON XXI.   Preached May 15, 1853.   JOHN'S REBUKE OF HEROD.   LUKE iii. 19, 20.--\"But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved    by him for Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, and for all the    evils which Herod had done, added yet this above all, that he shut    up John in prison.\"                                             270      SERMONS.      I.   _Preached April 28, 1850._   THE TONGUE.      \"Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.     Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! And the tongue     is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our     members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the     course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.\"--St. James iii.     5-6.   In the development of Christian Truth a peculiar office was assigned  to the Apostle James.   It was given to St. Paul to proclaim Christianity as the spiritual law  of liberty, and to exhibit Faith as the most active principle within  the breast of man. It was St. John's to say that the deepest quality  in the bosom of Deity is Love; and to assert that the life of God in  Man is Love. It was the office of St. James to assert the necessity of  Moral Rectitude; his very name marked him out peculiarly for this  office: he was emphatically called, \"the Just:\" integrity was his  peculiar characteristic. A man singularly honest, earnest, real. "]]]
