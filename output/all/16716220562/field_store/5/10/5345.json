He was prepared with an excuse for his abrupt departure and an explanation that would satisfy his indulgent master and mistress.  Keeping his companion in the background the wretch could then complete his plans for turning the party over to the fury of their brother murderers, who probably were calmly waiting on the outside for the signal.  Nothing of all this, we repeat, entered the head of Jack until he had made the change in the course he was following and had passed down the slope to the river bank.  His effort to mislead his enemies necessarily took him some distance above the point where he had left the boat, and he now set out to find his way to it.  It was while he was engaged in doing so that he became aware that he was followed.  \"Well, I'll be hanged!\" he muttered, coming to an abrupt stop; \"it seems to me that these infernal imps are everywhere.\"  He had not seen any one, but a rustling, grating noise in the shadow of the nearest tree told him where the immediate danger lay.  Believing that an unexpected course was best he wheeled and ran at full speed toward the tree, which contained a large number of dense, wide-spreading branches.  The result was surprising.  Instead of one native, two leaped out from cover and ran away at full speed.  They had been stealing after him, on the watch for a chance to bring him down by a blow in the back, when the tables were turned in this unexpected manner.  Jack, therefore, had no hesitation in firing at the one on his right, and immediately after at his companion, whose superior speed had placed him considerably in advance.  As a consequence, he missed the latter, while the first emitted a screech, leaped high in air and sprawled forward on his face as dead as Julius Caesar.  The fact that his pursuers were two in number led the young man to believe they were Mustad and his companion, whom he had heard in the house.  A few minutes later he made another halt.  He was able, despite the gloom, to identify the spot where he had left the boat, but it was not in sight.  \"I told them not to wait for me, and they acted on my suggestion.  They can't be far off, and I hope have run into no trouble.\"  The occurrences of the last quarter of an hour gave Jack a vivid idea of the increasing peril.  The natives from the nearby town were hunting for the physician, his daughter and himself, all of whom had not left the house a minute too soon and now, while he paused on the shore of the river and listened, he too caught the sound that had filled his friends with dread.  There were no noises from the jungles to the eastward, though at times the outcries are terrifying, and the shouts and shrieks of the mutineers and their victims at Meerut and Delhi were too far away to reach his ears, but he heard now and then the faint sound of paddles out on the stream.  \"Anderson spoke of using paddles,\" reflected Jack, \"but it was a misnomer, for they have none, and they would not have pushed so far out from shore when they knew I expected to return so soon.  All that proves that a party of devils have also a boat and are hunting for the one in which our new friends are groping for safety.\"  This threatened to make a new complication, but the plain course for Jack was to keep along the shore of the river and press his search for the craft, which he was certain was not far off.  His experience had taught him the need of unceasing vigilance, and as he advanced, he scrutinized the ground in front and on every hand, like a scout stealing into a hostile camp.  Within less time than he counted upon he saw the boat lying close to shore, where his friends were awaiting him.  As soon as he recognized the craft he announced himself in a guarded undertone, to guard against any mistake, and the next moment clambered aboard, where, it need not be said, he was warmly welcomed.  After they had exchanged greetings the doctor asked:  \"Did I not hear the report of your pistol a little while ago?\"  \"Inasmuch as I discharged it very probably you did.\"  Thereupon Jack told of what he had seen and done since leaving the boat to recover the pistol of Miss Marlowe.  It was a story of deep interest to all, and his account of his meeting with the faithless Mustad deeply stirred his master.  \"Despite my denunciation of the fellow I confess I had a lingering suspicion that I might have been mistaken; but all doubt now is removed.  There is no native in all India to be more dreaded than he.\"  \"I have a faint hope that it was he with whom I made my fourth bull's-eye,\" remarked Jack.  \"Hardly likely.  Probably there were two others skulking on the outside and waiting for a chance at us.\"  \"But they had all the chance they could have asked at _me_.\"  \"It may have been the doctor and his daughter whom they were the most eager to secure,\" suggested Mr. Turner.  \"That is my belief,\" added Anderson.  \"And mine, too,\" joined the doctor himself.  \"It seems to be a trait of our perverse human nature to hate with the deepest intensity those who have done us the greatest kindness.\"  This remark meant more to Jack Everson than to any one else, for he believed that it was the daughter who was the special object of the natives.  That reminded him of the weapon he had secured.  \"Here,\" he said, \"take it before I forget to return it.\"  \"You risked a good deal for my sake,\" she said gratefully, accepting the weapon, \"and I cannot thank you sufficiently----  Well, I declare!\"  She was in the act of placing the pistol in the pocket of her dress when she made the discovery that her weapon was already there.  Jack Everson had taken Mustad's own property from him.     CHAPTER X.  ALONG SHORE.  The curious incident served to lift for a brief time the oppression that rested upon all.  The remarkable part of it was how Miss Marlowe could believe she had left her revolver in her home when it was in the pocket of her dress, where, it would seem, she ought to have felt it while walking across the lawn to the boat, even if she had forgotten to examine that most natural receptacle for it when she first missed the weapon.  \"It is the most stupid thing I ever did,\" she declared.  \"I meant to keep it in my hand while coming from the house, and, awaking to the fact that it was not there, did not stop to examine my pocket.  It is too bad.\"  \"We have gained an additional means of defense,\" observed Mr. Turner, \"and that may be decisive before we are through with this business.\"  Now that all were together again each was impatient to be on the move. Wharton and Turner began using the poles with the skill shown some time before, and once more the unwieldy craft swung slowly down the Ganges, with all on board alert for the first sign of their enemies.  The women were advised to remain in the small cabin, where they would be safe against stealthy shots.  As the boat crept under the shadows along shore the spirits of all improved, for it seemed that with every rod placed behind, them the danger was diminished, and by and by would vanish altogether.  \"That, however, cannot be,\" said the doctor to Jack Everson, as they sat a little apart from the rest, near the bow of the craft.  \"In truth, I see but one possible escape for this party.\"  \"What is that?\"  \"I have already referred to it.  It will take us weeks to reach Calcutta on the east or Bombay on the west, and between us and each of these points the hell fire will rage for months to come.  To go south is equally suicidal, since it would take us into the heart of the insurrection.  I repeat that there is but one thing to be done: that is to push northward, as I said, until we reach a people too far removed to be affected by this deviltry.\"  \"To find a simple people where our knowledge of medicine will cause us to be looked upon as superior beings.  I have discovered a remedy for the bite of a cobra which will stand one in good stead, should a native be bitten.  They believe, you know, as does the rest of the world, that the bite of this serpent is certain death.  But I have discovered a remedy, the necessary drugs of which I carry in this case,\" touching the leather case strapped to his back.  \"Beyond all doubt.  You have tested this remedy of yours?\"  \"I have, twice.\"  \"Upon man or brute?\"  \"Upon both.\"     CHAPTER XI.  A COLLISION.  Although the two physicians were deeply interested in the question of toxicology they could not forget their situation and its perils.  The craft had nearly completed its half mile to the mouth of the tributary which it was intended to ascend, when the polemen, pausing for a moment's rest, whispered that they heard the sound of paddles again.  \"_There they are_!\"  It was Jack Everson who uttered the exclamation, loud enough for all to hear.  He pointed down stream as he spoke, and every one perceived the dreaded boat returning.  Although nearer at hand than before, it seemed to be following the course of the river, and there was hope that it would again pass without discovering the shrinking ones so near land.  When first observed the other boat was fifty yards out and not quite so far down stream.  Moving against the current its progress was slower than before, but its advance was plainly perceptible.  The craft of the white people had lost the momentum imparted by the poling, and was now controlled only by the current, which was so sluggish close to the land that the motion was hardly noticeable.  The hopes of our friends steadily rose until the other boat was almost directly abreast.  It would seem that if the occupants intended attacking they would have veered inward before this, but there could be no assurance so long as they remained visible.  Every one started when the gaunt, sloping figure suddenly became upright at the prow of the boat and stood motionless.  He had ceased using the pole that he had been plying with so much vigor.  At the same moment the noise of the paddles ceased, proving that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16805"],["title","The Jungle Fugitives: A Tale of Life and Adventure in India (#6)"],["body"," men controlling them had also stopped work.  What could it mean?  No one of the white people stirred or whispered.  Could they have done so they would have checked the beating of their hearts through fear of being betrayed.  Surely something had awakened the suspicion of the natives.  Suddenly some one spoke on board the craft.  The voice was audible, but the doctor, who was a master of Hindoostanee, could not catch what was said.  At the same instant a splash was heard, and the lank form bent over, as he pressed the long pole against the bottom of the river and resumed his slow walking toward the stern.  The noise of paddles, too, was heard again.  The craft had resumed its progress, and for an instant every one believed it was about to pass by.  Then Jack Everson said:  \"By heaven! they're coming for us!\"  All saw that the boat was swinging around so as to head toward them.  \"Into the cabin, quick!\" commanded the doctor, and the women quickly scrambled out of sight, while the men lay down, so as to screen their bodies as much as possible.  \"It won't do to let them come too near,\" added the physician.  \"Try to make every shot tell.\"  As he spoke he took the best aim he could and fired.  Jack Everson was but a moment behind him, and Anderson discharged his gun almost simultaneously.     CHAPTER XII.  A WHITE MAN'S VICTORY.  It was clear that the reception was a stunning surprise to the Asiatics in the other boat.  In times of confusion and terror strong men often sit dazed and meekly submit to massacre when sturdy resistance would leave a far different tale to tell.  Such was the case at Meerut, at Delhi, at Cawnpore, at Lucknow and scores of places where the human fiends revelled in massacre and crime.  But here, where evidently the same submissiveness was expected, the miscreants were fired upon before they had discharged a single shot themselves.  Not only that, but the Caucasians kept the thing up.  This was contrary to all rule and precedent.  If, however, the white men did not wait to be slain, neither did the dusky barbarians sit still and allow themselves to be shot down.  They ceased paddling and appealed to their guns, whose bullets began whistling about the heads of the defenders in the other boat.  Who of our friends did it will never be known, but one of them perforated the gaunt scoundrel who, with his form bent over, was pushing the pole while he stalked the length of the boat, returning again to the prow to repeat the performance.  The fellow emitted a screech like a wounded tiger and leaped several feet in air, coming down on the gunwale, over which he toppled into the water and was seen no more.  It was the spirited defiance of the white men that told. Screening themselves as best they could they continued firing, Jack Everson occasionally adding a shot from his revolver by way of variety. The conformation of the other boat and its crowded condition prevented the natives from sheltering themselves as did those who were using them as targets.  In short, the wretches were getting the worst of the business, and it did not take them long to learn the fact.  Left without control, their boat began drifting with the current, which being stronger than along shore gradually carried it down stream and out of sight.  So long, however, as it was visible its occupants continued firing, while the white people did still better, for they sent several shots after their enemies when they could see nothing and fired wholly by guess.  There could be no question that the promptness of Dr. Marlowe and the vigor of the resistance threw their foes into a sort of panic from which they did not recover until beyond range.  They had been taught a lesson that they were sure to remember for a long time; though, when our friends came to think the matter over, after finding no one of them had been hurt, they could not escape the belief that the consequences were certain to be of the most serious nature to themselves, and in this conclusion, sad to say, they were not mistaken.     CHAPTER XIII.  UNDER THE BANK.  A few minutes later an open space appeared in front of the boat.  It was the month of the tributary flowing into the Ganges from the left or north, and was more than a hundred yards across.  Since it was necessary to stem the current in order to take advantage of this refuge, the doctor contemplated it with misgiving, for the work of poling it up stream promised to be laborious.  He had not forgotten his original plan of abandoning the boat and striking across the country on foot, taking advantage of the less-frequented roads and paths that were well known to him.  He was relieved, however, to find the flow so languid that it was easy to make headway against it.  \"I have never followed this stream far,\" he remarked, \"and, therefore, have less knowledge of it than the rest of the country, but my impression is that it cannot serve us long.\"  \"It will be time enough to leave the boat and take to the woods when we can go no further,\" said Jack Everson; \"but we cannot get away from the main stream too soon.\"  This was self-evident.  It was not likely that the natives after their decisive repulse would abandon their purpose of massacring the party, but they would be more guarded in what they did and probably secure reinforcements, an easy thing to do when the sanguinary wretches everywhere were thirsting for victims.  Jack had seized one of the poles, and he and young Wharton plied them with so much sturdiness that the heavy craft made better progress than at any time since it was used as a vehicle of safety.  The course of the tributary was winding, and our friends had not gone far when they were shut out from the sight of any persons passing up and down the main river, even if close to the northern bank.  Would the natives suspect the course taken by the whites?  That was the all-important question that must soon be answered.  After searching up and down the Ganges without success, it was likely they would penetrate the stratagem and follow them, in which event the fugitives would be in a critical situation, since the straightness of the stream and the wooded shores would place them at much greater disadvantage than if they remained upon the Ganges.  When the boat had ascended the tributary for perhaps an eighth of a mile it was deemed safe to lessen the work of poling.  Careful listening failed to detect any sound of pursuit, and there was ground for hoping that their enemies neither knew nor suspected what had been done.  Several facts had become apparent.  The densely wooded shores offered excellent concealment.  By running the boat beneath the dense branches and among the heavy vegetation the keenest-eyed Asiatics might pass up or down stream almost within arm's length without suspecting its presence.  But the tributary had perceptibly narrowed and its current was swifter than at the mouth.  All this pointed to the truth of what Dr. Marlowe suspected--the stream could not serve them much further.  The night was now so far advanced that the women took the advice of their friends and withdrew to the cabin for slumber.  Their quarters were cramped, but they made themselves fairly comfortable.  The night was cooler than the day, but only sufficiently so to be pleasant.  It was not deemed probable that anything would be seen of their enemies before the morrow, and perhaps not even then.  Dr. Marlowe insisted upon taking his turn in poling, but since there were four vigorous men without him, they would not consent.  When two had toiled for an hour or more, they gave way to the other couple, and the progress thus continued without interruption, while the time slowly dragged along.  The resting spells gave each the opportunity for sleep, thus husbanding their vigor for the morrow.  Finding that there was nothing to which he could turn his hand, the physician reclined at the bow and soon joined the others in dreamland.  It was probably one o'clock when Jack Everson, who had been sleeping for nearly an hour, was awakened by a gentle shaking of his shoulder. Opening his eyes and looking up he saw Wharton bending over him.  \"All right,\" remarked the American; \"I'm ready for my turn,\" and he rose, yawning, to his feet.  \"I think we had better rest until morning.\"  \"Why?\"  \"The current has become so rapid that it is hard to make progress; this stream can't be of much further use to us.\"  It needed but a glance around in the gloom to see that it was as his friend had declared.  The boat was so close to the left-hand shore that it was held motionless by Anderson at the bow, who gripped an overhanging branch, with one hand.  The water rippled around the front of the craft, and when Jack dipped the end of one of the poles into the current it swept downward at a rate that astonished him.  \"I esteem your advice good,\" he said, \"but it will not do to leave the boat in sight.\"  With the help of the limbs and the use of the poles it was easy to force the craft under the bank, where it was screened from observation. Then it was secured in place against drifting and all work for the time was over.  Wharton and Jack Everson were the only persons awake.  The women had been sleeping for several hours, while Anderson and Turner had long since joined the venerable doctor in the realms of unconsciousness. The two young men sat down where they could speak in low tones without being overheard.  \"It won't do for all of us to sleep at the same time,\" remarked Jack; \"the scoundrels may be creeping up stream after us.\"  \"That is hardly possible; I am sure that for the present we are as safe as if in the heart of London.\"  \"I cannot believe as you do; since I have just enjoyed an hour's sleep I will act as sentinel until daybreak.  I can easily keep awake for the few hours that remain.\"  \"As you think best, though I am sure it is an unnecessary precaution.\"  \"We must not forget that there are perils from the jungle as well as from the river.  There is "]]]
