She was a tall, spare woman, with a firm mouth, keen blue eyes, and a look of patient endurance in her face, bred by the stern life of pioneer New England. Far away across the pasture which sloped southward from the cabin she could see long meadow grass waving in the breeze, and beyond a thread of blue water where the Charles River flowed lazily to the sea. Westward there was also pasture land where sheep were grazing, and in the distance a glimpse of the thatched roofs of the little village of Cambridge.  Goodwife Pepperell gazed long and earnestly in this direction, and then, making a trumpet of her hands, sent a call ringing across the silent fields. \"Nancy! Daniel!\" she shouted.  She was answered only by the tinkle of sheep bells. A shade of anxiety clouded the blue eyes as she went round to the back of the cabin and looked toward the dense forest which bounded her vision on the north. Stout-hearted though she was, Goodwife Pepperell could never forget the terrors which lay concealed behind that mysterious rampart of green. Not only were there wolves and deer and many other wild creatures hidden in its depths, but it sheltered also the perpetual menace of the Indians. Toward the east, at some distance from the cabin, corn-fields stretched to salt meadows, and beyond, across the bay, she could see the three hills of Boston town.[1]  [Footnote 1: See map.]  As no answering shout greeted her from this direction either, the Goodwife stepped quickly toward a hollow stump which stood a short distance from the cabin. Beside the stump a slender birch tree bent beneath the weight of a large circular piece of wood hung to its top by a leather thong. This was the samp-mill, where their corn was pounded into meal. Seizing the birch tree with her hands, she brought the wooden pestle down into the hollow stump with a resounding thump. The birch tree sprang back lifting the block with it and again she pulled it down and struck the stump another blow, then paused to listen. This time there was, beside the echo, an answering shout, and in a few moments two heads appeared above the rows of young corn just peeping out of the ground, two pairs of lively bare feet came flying across the garden patch, and a breathless boy and girl stood beside their mother.  They were a sturdy pair of twelve-year-olds, the boy an inch or more taller than his sister, and both with the blue eyes, fair skin, and rosy cheeks which proclaimed their English blood. There was a gleam of pride in Goodwife Pepperell's eye as she looked a her children, but not for the world would she have let them see it; much less would she have owned it to herself, for she was a Puritan mother, and regarded pride of any kind as altogether sinful. \"Where have you been all the morning?\" she said. \"You were nowhere to be seen and the corn is not yet high enough to hide you.\"  \"I was hoeing beyond that clump of bushes,\" said Daniel, pointing to a group of high blueberries that had been allowed to remain in the cleared field.  \"And I was keeping away the crows,\" said Nancy, holding out her wooden clappers. \"Only I fell asleep. It was so warm I just could n't help it.\"  \"So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth and thy want as an armed man,\" quoted the mother sternly. \"Night is the time for sleep. Go now and eat the porridge I have set for you in your little porringers, and then go down to the bay with this basket and fill it with clams. Put a layer of seaweed in the basket first and pack the clams in that. They will keep alive for some time if you bed them so, and be sure to bring back the shovel.\"  This was a task that suited the Twins much better than either hoeing corn or scaring crows, and they ran into the house at once, ate their porridge with more haste than good manners, and dashed joyfully away across the fields toward the river-mouth, a mile away. They followed a path across the wide stretch of pasture, where wild blackberry vines and tall blueberry bushes grew, then through a strip of meadow land, and at last ran out on the bare stretch of sand and weed left by the ebb tide toward the narrow channel cut by the clear water of the Charles.  Here they set down the basket and began looking about for the little holes which betray the hiding-places of clams.  [Illustration]  \"Oh, look, Dan,\" cried Nancy, stopping to admire the long line of foot-prints which they had left behind them. \"Dost see what a pretty border we have made? 'T is just like a pattern.\" She walked along the edge of the stream with her toes turned well out, leaving a track in the sand like this:  [Illustration]  Then the delightful flat surface tempted her to further exploits. She picked up a splinter of driftwood and, making a wide flourish, began to draw a picture. \"See,\" she called rapturously to Dan, \"this is going to be a pig! Here 's his nose, and here 's his curly tail, and here are his little fat legs.\" She clapped her hands with admiration. \"Now I shall do something else,\" she announced as she finished the pig with a round red pebble stuck in for the eye. \"Let me see. What shall I draw? Oh, I know! A picture of Gran'ther Wattles! Look, Dan.\" She made a careful stroke. \"Here 's his nose, and here 's his chin. They are monstrous near together because he has nothing but gums between! And here 's his long tithing-stick with the squirrel-tail on the end!\"  [Illustration]  \"It doth bear a likeness to him!\" admitted Dan, laughing in spite of himself, \"but, sister, thou shouldst not mock him. He is an old man, and we should pay respect to gray hairs. Father says so.\"  \"Truly I have as much of respect as he hath of hair,\" answered naughty Nancy. \"His poll is nearly as bald as an egg.\"  \"I know the cause of thy displeasure,\" declared Dan. \"Gran'ther Wattles poked thee for bouncing about during the sermon last Sunday. But it is unseemly to bounce in the meeting-house, and besides, is he not the tithing-man? 'T is his duty to see that people behave as they should.\"  \"He would mayhap have bounced himself if a bee had been buzzing about his nose as it did about mine,\" said Nancy, and, giving a vicious dab at the pictured features, she drew a bee perched on the end of Gran'ther Wattles's nose. \"Here now are all the gray hairs he hath,\" she added, making three little scratches above the ear.  \"Nancy Pepperell!\" cried her brother, aghast, \"dost thou not remember what happened to the forty and two children that said 'Go up, thou bald head' to Elijah? It would be no marvel if bears were to come out of the woods this moment to eat thee up!\"  [Illustration]  \"'T was n't Elijah, 't was Elisha,\" Nancy retorted with spirit, \"but it matters little whether 't was one or t' other, for I don't believe two bears could possibly hold so much, and besides dost thou not think it a deal worse to cause a bear to eat up forty and two children than to say 'Go up, thou bald head'?\"  \"Nancy!\" exclaimed her horrified brother, glancing fearfully toward the forest and clapping his hand on her mouth to prevent further impiety, \"thou art a wicked, wicked girl! Dost thou not know that the eye of the Lord is in every place? Without doubt his ear is too, and He can hear every word thy saucy tongue sayeth. Come, let us rub out this naughty picture quickly, and mayhap God will take no notice this time.\" He ran across Gran'ther Wattles's portrait from brow to chin, covering it with foot-prints. \"Besides,\" he went on as he trotted back and forth, \"thou hast broken a commandment! Thou hast made a likeness of something that 's in the earth, and that 's Gran'ther Wattles! Nancy, thou dost take fearful chances with thy soul.\"  Nancy began to look a little anxious as she considered her conduct. \"At any rate,\" she said defensively, \"it is n't a graven image, and I have neither bowed down to it nor served it! I do try to be good, Dan, but it seemeth that the devil is ever at my elbow.\"  [Illustration]  \"'T is because thou art idle,\" said Dan, shaking his head as gravely as Gran'ther Wattles himself. \"Busy thyself with the clams, and Satan will have less chance at thy idle hands, and thy idle tongue too.\"  Nancy obediently took hold of the basket which Dan thrust into her hands, and together they walked for some distance over the sandy stretches. Suddenly a tiny stream"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16644"],["title","The Puritan Twins (#1)"],["body","water spouted up beside Dan's feet. \"Here they be!\" he shouted, plunging his shovel into the sand, \"and what big ones!\" Nancy surveyed the clams with disfavor. They were thrusting pale thick muscles out between the lobes of their shells. \"They look as if they were sticking out their tongues at us,\" said Nancy as she picked one up gingerly and dropped it into the basket. \"But, Dan, Mother said we were to bed them in seaweed!\"  \"I see none here,\" said Dan, leaning on his shovel and looking about him. \"The tide hath swept everything as clean as a floor.\"  \"I 'll seek for some while thou art busy with the digging,\" said Nancy, glad to escape the duty of picking up the clams, and off she trotted without another word. The flats, seamed and grooved with channels where pools of water still lingered, sloped gently down to the lower level of the bay, and farther out a range of rocks lifted themselves above the sandy waste.  [Illustration]  \"I 'll surely find seaweed on the rocks,\" thought Nancy to herself as she sped along, and in a few moments she had reached them, had tossed up the basket, and was climbing their rugged sides.  \"There 's a mort o' seaweed here,\" she said, nodding her head wisely as she picked up a long string of kelp; \"I can fill my basket in no time at all.\" There was no need for haste, she thought, so she sat down beside a pool of water left in a hollow of the rocks, to explore its contents. The first thing she found was a group of tiny barnacles, and for a while she amused herself by washing salt water over them to see them open their tiny cups of shell. In the pool itself a beautiful lavender-colored jelly-fish was floating about, and just beyond lay a star-fish clinging to a bunch of seaweed. She found other treasures scattered about by the largess of the tide--tiny spiral shells, stones of all colors, and a horseshoe crab, besides seaweed with pretty little pods which popped delightfully when she squeezed them with her fingers. Then she heard the cries of gulls overhead and watched them as they wheeled and circled between her and the sky. When they flew out to sea she sat with her hands clasping her knees and gazed across the bay at the three hills of Boston town. She could see quite plainly the tall beacon standing like a ship's mast on top of Beacon Hill, and farther north she strained her eyes to pick out Governor Winthrop's dwelling from the cluster of houses which straggled up the slope of Copp's Hill and which made all there was of the city of Boston in that early day.  [Illustration]  For some time she sat there hugging her knees and thinking long, long thoughts, and it was not until the sound of little waves lapping against the rocks roused her that she woke from her day dream and realized with terror that the tide had turned. The channels and lower levels of the bay were already brimming over, and the water was deep about the rocks on which she perched. At almost the same moment Dan had been surprised by a cold wave which washed over his bare feet, and, turning about, was dismayed to find a sheet of blue water covering the bay and to see Nancy standing on the topmost rock shouting \"Dan! Dan!\" at the top of her lungs. For one astonished instant he looked at her, then, throwing down his shovel, he plunged unhesitatingly into the icy bath. And now Nancy, realizing that there was not a moment to lose if she hoped to reach the shore in safety, let herself slowly down off the rocks, leaving the basket behind her, and started toward her brother.  The water was already so deep in the channels that their progress toward each other was slow, but they ploughed bravely on, feeling the bottom carefully at each step lest they sink in some sand-pocket or hollow washed out by the tide. Some distance away toward Charlestown a fishing schooner rocked on the deeper water of the bay, and a fisherman in a small boat, attracted by the shouting, looked up, and, seeing the two struggling figures, instantly bent to his oars and started toward them. Though he rowed rapidly, it was some minutes before he could reach the children, who were now floundering about in water nearly up to their necks.  [Illustration]  \"Hold fast to my shoulder, Nancy,\" he heard Dan cry. \"I can float, and I can swim a little. Keep thy nose above water and let thy feet go where they will.\" Nancy, spluttering and gurgling, was trying hard to follow Dan's directions, when the boat shot alongside, and a cheery voice cried, \"Ahoy, there! Come aboard, you young porpoises!\"  To the children it was like a voice straight from heaven. Dan immediately helped Nancy to get into the boat, and then she balanced it while he climbed aboard.  When they were safely bestowed among the lobster-pots with which the boat was laden, the man leaned on his oars and eyed them critically. \"Short of sense, ain't ye?\" he remarked genially. \"Nigh about drownded that time or I 'm no skipper! If ye ain't bent on destruction ye 'd better get into dry clothes. Ye 're as wet as a mess of drownded kittens. Tell me where you live and I 'll take you home.\"  He flung a tarpaulin over the shivering figures and tucked it around them as he scolded. \"'T is all my fault,\" sobbed poor Nancy. \"Dan came in just to get me out.\"  \"Very commendable of him, I 'm sure,\" said the stranger, nodding approvingly at Dan, \"and just what he 'd ought to do, and doubtless you 're worth saving at that, though a hen-headeder young miss I never see in all my days!\"  \"She went to find seaweed to bed the clams,\" explained Dan, coming to his sister's defense, \"and the tide caught her. Thou art kind indeed to pick us up, sir.\"  \"Oh,\" groaned remorseful Nancy, her teeth chattering, \"it 's all because I 'm such a sinner! I made a likeness of Gran'ther Wattles in the sand and said dreadful things about the prophet Elijah, or mayhap 't was Elisha, and Dan said a bear might come to eat me up just like the forty and two children, and instead of a bear we both were almost swallowed by the tide!\"  \"Well, now,\" said the stranger, comfortingly, \"ye see instead of sending bears the Lord sent me along to fish ye out, just the same as He sent the whale to swallow Jonah when he was acting contrary! Looks like He meant to let ye off with a scare this time. Come now, my lass, there 's salt water enough aboard and if ye cry into the boat, ye 'll have to bail her out. Besides,\" he added whimsically, looking up at the sky, \"there 's another squall coming on, and two at a time is too many for any sailor. If I 'm to cast you up on the shore same as the whale, ye 'll have to tell me which way to go, and who ye are.\"  \"Our father is Josiah Pepperell,\" answered Dan, \"and our house is almost a mile back from shore near Cambridge.\"  \"So you 're Josiah Pepperell's children! To be sure, to be sure! Might have known it. Ye do favor him some,\" said the fisherman. \"Well! well! The ways of the Lord are surely past finding out! Why, I knew your father way back in England. He came over here for religion and I came for fish. Not that I ain't a God-fearing man,\" he added hastily, noticing a look of horror on Nancy's face, \"but I ain't so pious as some. I 'm a seafaring man, Captain Sanders of the Lucy Ann, Marblehead. Ye can see her riding at anchor out there in the bay. I have n't set eyes on your father since he left Boston and settled in the back woods up yonder.\"  He sent the boat flying through the water with swift, sure strokes as he talked, and brought it ashore at the first landing-place they found. Here they drew it up on the bank and, taking out the lobster-pots, turned it upside down so the rain would not fill it. Two great green lobsters with goblin-like eyes were hidden away under the pots, and when the boat was overturned they tumbled out and started at a lively pace for the water.  \"Hi, there!\" shouted the Captain, seizing them by their tails, \"where are your manners? By jolly, I like to forgot ye! Come along now and take supper with the Pepperells. I invite ye! They 're short of clams and they 'll be pleased to see ye, or I miss my reckoning.\" There were pegs stuck in the scissor-like claws, so the creatures were harmless, and, swinging along with one kicking vigorously in each hand, the Captain plunged into the long meadow grass, the children following close at his heels.  The clouds grew darker and darker; there was a rumble of thunder, and streaks of lightning tore great rents in the sky as they hurried across the open meadow and struck into the pasture land beyond.  \"Head into the wind there and keep going,\" shouted the Captain as the children struggled along, impeded by their wet clothing. \"It 's from the north, and we 're pointed straight into it.\"  Past bushes waving distractedly in the wind, under the boughs of young oak trees, over stones and through briars they sped, and at last they came in sight of the cabin just as the storm broke. Goodwife Pepperell was standing in the door gazing anxiously toward the river, when they dashed out of the bushes and, scudding past her, stood dripping on the hearth-stone. Her husband was just hanging his gun over the chimney-piece, and the noise of their entrance was drowned out by a clap of thunder; so when he turned about and saw the three drenched figures it was no wonder that for an instant he was too surprised to speak.  \"Well, of all things!\" he said at last, holding out his hand to Captain Sanders. \"What in God's providence brings thee here, Thomas? Thou art welcome indeed. 'T is a long time since I have seen thee.\"  \"God's providence ye may call it,\" answered the Captain, shaking the Goodman's hand as if he were pumping out the hold of a sinking ship, \"and I 'll not gainsay it. The truth is I overhauled these small craft floundering around in the tide-wash with water over their scuppers 'n' all but wrecked, so I took 'em in tow and brought 'em ashore!\"  Their mother, meanwhile, had not waited for explanations. Seeing how chilled they were, she had hurried the children to"]]]
