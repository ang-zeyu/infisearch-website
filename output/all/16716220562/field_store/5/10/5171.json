The overture,     in fact, was not unlike a race between the different     instruments; the piano came in first by several bars,     and the violoncello next, quite distancing the poor     flute; for the deaf gentleman _too-too'd_ away, quite     unconscious that he was at all wrong, until apprised,     by the applause of the audience, that the overture     was concluded.  It was probably after this that the pianoforte player fainted away, owing to the heat, and left the music of _Masaniello_ to the other two. There were differences between these remaining musicians and Mr. Harleigh, who played the title r√¥le, the orchestra complaining that 'Mr. Harleigh put them out, while the hero declared that the orchestra prevented his singing a note.'  It was to the strains of a wandering harp and fiddle that Marion and Grace Jeddler danced 'a trifle in the Spanish style,' much to their father's astonishment as he came bustling out to see who 'played music on his property before breakfast.'  The little fiddle commonly known as a 'kit' that dancing-masters used to carry in their capacious tail coat pockets was much more in evidence in the middle of last century than it is now. Caddy Jellyby (_B.H._), after her marriage to a dancing-master, found a knowledge of the piano and the kit essential, and so she used to practise them assiduously. When Sampson Brass hears Kit's name for the first time he says to Swiveller:      'Strange name--name of a dancing-master's fiddle,     eh, Mr. Richard?'  We must not forget the story of a fine young Irish gentleman, as told by the one-eyed bagman to Mr. Pickwick and his friends, who,      being asked if he could play the fiddle, replied he     had no doubt he could, but he couldn't exactly say     for certain, because he had never tried.   _Violoncello_  Mr. Morfin (_D. & S._), 'a cheerful-looking, hazel-eyed elderly bachelor,' was      a great musical amateur--in his way--after business,     and had a paternal affection for his violoncello, which     was once in every week transported from Islington,     his place of abode, to a certain club-room hard by     the Bank, where quartets of the most tormenting and     excruciating nature were executed every Wednesday     evening by a private party.  His habit of humming his musical recollections of these evenings was a source of great annoyance to Mr. James Carker, who devoutly wished 'that he would make a bonfire of his violoncello, and burn his books with it.' There was only a thin partition between the rooms which these two gentlemen occupied, and on another occasion Mr. Morfin performed an extraordinary feat in order to warn the manager of his presence.      I have whistled, hummed tunes, gone accurately through     the whole of Beethoven's Sonata in B, to let him know     that I was within hearing, but he never heeded me.  This particular sonata has not hitherto been identified.  It is comforting to know that the fall of the House of Dombey made no difference to Mr. Morfin, who continued to solace himself by producing 'the most dismal and forlorn sounds out of his violoncello before going to bed,' a proceeding which had no effect on his deaf landlady, beyond producing 'a sensation of something rumbling in her bones.'  Nor were the quartet parties interfered with. They came round regularly, his violoncello was in good tune, and there was nothing wrong in _his_ world. Happy Mr. Morfin!  Another 'cellist was the Rev. Charles Timson, who, when practising his instrument in his bedroom, used to give strict orders that he was on no account to be disturbed.  It was under the pretence of buying 'a second-hand wiolinceller' that Bucket visited the house of the dealer in musical instruments in order to effect the arrest of Mr. George (_B.H._).   _Harp_  The harp was a fashionable drawing-room instrument in the early Victorian period, although the re-introduction of the guitar temporarily detracted from its glory. It was also indispensable in providing music for dancing-parties and concerts. When Esther Summerson went to call on the Turveydrops (_B.H._) she found the hall blocked up with a grand piano, a harp, and various other instruments which had been used at a concert. As already stated, it was the sight of these instruments being carried up the stairs at The Bull in Rochester that aroused Mr. Jingle's curiosity (_P.P._) and led to the discovery that a ball was in prospect.  We must not forget the eldest Miss Larkins, one of David Copperfield's early, fleeting loves. He used to wander up and down outside the home of his beloved and watch the officers going in to hear Miss L. play the harp. On hearing of her engagement to one of these he mourned for a very brief period, and then went forth and gloriously defeated his old enemy the butcher boy. What a contrast between this humour and the strange scene in the drawing-room at James Steerforth's home after Rosa Dartle had sung the strange weird Irish song to the accompaniment of her harp! And how different, again, the scene in the home of Scrooge's nephew (_C.C._) when, after tea, 'they had some music.'      Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and played,     among other things, a simple little air.  It reminded Scrooge of a time long past.      He softened more and more; and thought that if he     could have listened to it often, years ago, he might     have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own     happiness with his own hand.  Little Paul Dombey told Lady Skettles at the breaking-up party that he was very fond of music, and he was very, very proud of his sister's accomplishments both as player and singer. Did they inherit this love from their father? 'You are fond of music,' said the Hon. Mrs. Skewton to Mr. Dombey during an interval in a game of picquet. 'Eminently so,' was the reply. But the reader must not take him at his word. When Edith (the future Mrs. Dombey) entered the room and sat down to her harp,      Mr. Dombey rose and stood beside her, listening. He     had little taste for music, and no knowledge of the     strain she played; but he saw her bending over it,     and perhaps he heard among the sounding strings some     distant music of his own.  Yet when she went to the piano and commenced to sing Mr. Dombey did not know that it was 'the air that his neglected daughter sang to his dead son'!   _Piano_  Lady musicians are numerous, and of very varied degrees of excellence. Amongst the pianists is Miss Teresa Malderton, who nearly fell a prey to that gay deceiver Mr. Horatio Sparkins (_S.B.T._ 5). Her contribution to a musical evening was 'The Fall of Paris,' played, as Mr. Sparkins declared, in a masterly manner.  There was a song called 'The Fall of Paris,' but it is most probable that Dickens was thinking of a very popular piece which he must have often heard in his young days, of which the full title was      THE SURRENDER OF PARIS. A characteristic Divertimento     for the Pianoforte, including the events from the Duke     of Wellington and Prince Blucher's marching to that     capital to the evacuation by the French troops and     taking possession by the Allies, composed by Louis     Jansen, 1816.  Not the least curious section of this piece of early programme music is a _moderato_ recording the various articles of the capitulation. These are eighteen in number, and each has its own 'theme.' The interspersion of some discords seems to imply serious differences of opinion between the parties to the treaty.  There was also a song called 'The Downfall of Paris,' the first verse of which was      Great news I have to tell you all,       Of Bonaparte and a' that;     How Paris it has got a fall,       He's lost his plans and a' that.      _Chorus._      Rise up, John Bull, rise up and sing,       Your chanter loudly blaw that;     Lang live our auld and worthy king,       Success to Britain, a' that.  The instrument beloved of Miss Tox (_D. & S._) was the harpsichord, and her favourite piece was the 'Bird Waltz,' while the 'Copenhagen Waltz' was also in her repertoire. Two notes of the instrument were dumb from disuse, but their silence did not impoverish the rendering. Caddy Jellyby found it necessary to know something of the piano, in order that she might instruct the 'apprentices' at her husband's dancing-school. Another performer was Mrs. Namby, who entertained Mr. Pickwick with solos on a square piano while breakfast was being prepared. When questioned by David Copperfield as to the gifts of Miss Sophy Crewler, Traddles explained that she knew enough of the piano to teach it to her little sisters, and she also sang ballads to freshen up her family a little when they were out of spirits, but 'nothing scientific.' The guitar was quite beyond her. David noted with much satisfaction (though he did not say so) that his Dora was much more gifted musically.  When Dickens wrote his earlier works it was not considered the correct thing for a gentleman to play the piano, though it might be all very well for the lower classes and the music teacher. Consequently we read of few male performers on the instrument. Mr. Skimpole could play the piano, and of course Jasper had a 'grand' in his room at Cloisterham.  At one time, if we may believe the turnkey at the Marshalsea prison, William Dorrit had been a pianist, a fact which raised him greatly in the turnkey's opinion.      Brought up as a gentleman, he was, if ever a man was.     Educated at no end of expense. Went into the Marshal's     house once to try a new piano for him. Played it,     I understand, like one o'clock--beautiful.  In the _Collected Papers_ we have a picture of the 'throwing off young gentleman,' who strikes a note or two upon the piano, and accompanies it correctly (by dint of laborious practice) with his voice. He assures      a circle of wondering listeners that so acute was his     ear that he was wholly unable to sing out of tune,     let him try as he would.

His object was to effect Mr. Pickwick's escape from the Fleet.      Me and a cab'net-maker has dewised a plan for     gettin' him out. 'A pianner, Samivel, a pianner,'     said Mr. Weller, striking his son on the chest with     the back of his hand, and falling back a step or two.      'Wot do you mean?' said Sam.      'A pianner-forty, Samivel,' rejoined Mr. Weller, in a     still more mysterious manner, 'as he can have on hire;     vun as von't play, Sammy.'      'And wot 'ud be the good of that?' said Sam.      'There ain't no vurks in it,' whispered his father. 'It     'ull hold him easy, vith his hat and shoes on; and     breathe through the legs, vich is holler.'  But the usually dutiful Sam showed so little enthusiasm for his father's scheme that nothing more was heard of it.     CHAPTER III  VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS  FLUTE, ORGAN, GUITAR (AND SOME HUMMERS)   _Flute_  We find several references to the flute, and Dickens contrives to get much innocent fun out of it. First comes Mr. Mell, who used to carry his instrument about with him and who, in response to his mother's invitation to 'have a blow at it' while David Copperfield was having his breakfast, made, said David, 'the most dismal sounds I have ever heard produced by any means, natural or artificial.' After he had finished he unscrewed his flute into three pieces, and deposited them underneath the skirts of his coat.  Dickens' schoolmasters seem to have been partial to the flute. Mr. Squeers, it is true, was not a flautist, but Mr. Feeder, B.A., was, or rather he was going to be. When little Paul Dombey visited his tutor's room he saw 'a flute which Mr. Feeder couldn't play yet, but was going to make a point of learning, he said, hanging up over the fireplace.'  He also had a beautiful little curly second-hand 'key bugle,' which was also on the list of things to be accomplished on some future occasion, in fact he has unlimited confidence in the power and influence of music. Here is his advice to the love-stricken Mr. Toots, whom he recommends to      learn the guitar, or at least the flute; for women     like music when you are paying your addresses to 'em,     and he has found the advantage of it himself.  The flute was the instrument that Mr. Richard Swiveller took to when he heard that Sophy Wackles was lost to him for ever,      thinking that it was a good, sound, dismal occupation,     not only in unison with his own sad thoughts, but     calculated to awaken a fellow feeling in the bosoms     of his neighbours.  So he got out his flute, arranged the light and a small oblong music-book to the best advantage, and began to play 'most mournfully.'      The air was 'Away with Melancholy,' a composition which,     when it is played very slowly on the flute, in bed,     with the further disadvantage of being performed     by a gentleman but imperfectly acquainted with the     instrument, who repeats one note a great many times     before he can find the next, has not a lively effect.  So Mr. Swiveller spent half the night or more over this pleasing exercise, merely stopping now and then to take breath and soliloquize about the Marchioness; and it was only after he 'had nearly maddened the people of the house, and at both the next doors, and over the way,' that he shut up the book and went to sleep. The result of this was that the next morning he got a notice to quit from his landlady, who had been in waiting on the stairs for that purpose since the dawn of day.  Jack Redburn, too (_M.H.C._), seems to have found consolation in this instrument, spending his wet Sundays in 'blowing a very slow tune on the flute.'  There is one, and only one, recorded instance of this very meek instrument suddenly asserting itself by going on strike, and that is in the sketch entitled _Private Theatres_ (_S.B.S._ 13), where the amateurs take so long to dress for their parts that 'the flute says he'll be blowed if he plays any more.'  We must on no account forget the serenade with which the gentlemen boarders proposed to honour the Miss Pecksniffs. The performance was both vocal and instrumental, and the description of the flute-player is delightful.      It was very affecting, very. Nothing more dismal could     have been desired by the most fastidious taste.... The     youngest gentleman blew his melancholy into a flute. He     didn't blow much out of it, but that was all the better.  After a description of the singing we have more about the flute.      The flute of the youngest gentleman was wild and     fitful. It came and went in gusts, like the wind. For     a long time together he seemed to have left off, and     when it was quite settled by Mrs. Todgers and the     young ladies that, overcome by his feelings, he had     retired in tears, he unexpectedly turned up again at     the very top of the tune, gasping for breath. He was     a tremendous performer. There was no knowing where to     have him; and exactly when you thought he was doing     nothing at all, then was he doing the very thing that     ought to astonish you most.  Yet another performer is the domestic young gentleman (_C.P._) who holds skeins of silk for the ladies to wind, and who then      brings down his flute in compliance with a request     from the youngest Miss Gray, and plays divers tunes     out of a very small book till supper-time.  When Nancy went to the prison to look for Oliver Twist, she found nobody in durance vile except a man who had been taken up for playing the flute, and who was bewailing the loss of the same, which had been confiscated for the use of the county.  The gentleman who played the violoncello at Mrs. Gattleton's party has already been referred to, and it only remains to mention Mr. Evans, who 'had such lovely whiskers' and who played the flute on the same occasion, to bring the list of players to an end.   _Hummers_  We meet with a remarkable musician in _Dombey and Son_ in the person of Harriet Carker's visitor, a scientific one, according to the description:      A certain skilful action of his fingers as he hummed     some bars, and beat time on the seat beside him,     seemed to denote the musician; and the extraordinary     satisfaction he derived from humming something very     slow and long, which had no recognizable tune, seemed     to denote that he was a scientific one.  A less capable performer was Sampson Brass, who hummed      in a voice that was anything but musical certain     vocal snatches which appeared to have reference to the     union between Church and State, inasmuch as they were     compounded of the Evening Hymn and 'God Save the King.'  Musicians of various degrees abound in the _Sketches_. Here is Mr. Wisbottle, whistling 'The Light Guitar' at five o'clock in the morning, to the intense disgust of Mr. John Evenson, a fellow boarder at Mrs. Tibbs'. Subsequently he came down to breakfast in blue slippers and a shawl dressing-gown, whistling 'Di piacer.' Mr. Evenson can no longer control his feelings, and threatens to start the triangle if his enemy will not stop his early matutinal music. A suggested name for this whistler is the 'humming-top,' from his habit of describing semi-circles on the piano stool, and 'humming most melodiously.' There are a number of characters who indulge in the humming habit either to cover their confusion, or as a sign of light-heartedness and contentment. Prominent amongst these are Pecksniff, who, like Morfin, hums melodiously, and Micawber, who can both sing and hum. Nor must we omit to mention Miss Petowker, who 'hummed a tune' as her contribution to the entertainment at Mrs. Kenwigs' party. Many of the characters resort to humming to conceal their temporary discomfiture, and perhaps no one ever hummed under more harassing circumstances than when Mr. Pecksniff had to go to the door to let in some very unwelcome guests, who had already knocked several times. But he was a past master in the art of dissimulation. He is particularly anxious to conceal from his visitors the fact that Jonas Chuzzlewit is in the house. So he says to the latter--      'This may be a professional call. Indeed I am pretty     sure it is. Thank you.' Then Mr. Pecksniff, gently     warbling a rustic stave, put on his garden hat, seized     a spade, and opened the street door; calmly appearing     on the threshold as if he thought he had, from his     vineyard, heard a modest rap, but was not quite certain.  Then he tells his visitors 'I do a little bit of Adam still.' He certainly had a good deal of the old Adam in him.   _Clarionet_  The clarionet is associated with the fortunes of Mr. Frederick Dorrit, who played the instrument at the theatre where his elder niece was a dancer, and where Little Dorrit sought an engagement. After the rehearsal was over she and her sister went to take him home.      He had been in that place six nights a week for many     years, but had never been observed to raise his eyes     above his music-book.... The carpenters had a joke     that he was dead without being aware of it.  At the theatre he had no part in what was going on except the part written for the clarionet. In his young days his house had been the resort of singers and players. When the fortunes of the family changed his clarionet was taken away from him, on the ground that it was a 'low instrument.' It was subsequently restored to him, but he never played it again.  Of quite a different stamp was one of the characters in _Going into Society_, who played the clarionet in a band at a Wild Beast Show, and played it all wrong. He was somewhat eccentric in dress, as he had on 'a white Roman shirt and a bishop's mitre covered with leopard skin.' We are told nothing about him, except that he refused to know his old friends. In his story of the _Seven Poor Travellers_ Dickens found the clarionet-player of the Rochester Waits so communicative that he accompanied the party across an open green"]]]
