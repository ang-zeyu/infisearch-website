Does the gentleman suppose it is in his power', to exhibit in Carolina a name so bright' as to produce envy' in my bosom?  3. If it be admitted, that strict integrity is not the shortest way to success, is it not the surest', the happiest', the best'?  4.  Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens, To wash this crimson hand as white as snow'?  Exception.--Emphasis may reverse this rule.   EXAMPLES. (25)  1, Can' you be so blind to your interest? Will' you rush headlong to destruction?  2. I ask again, is' there no hope of reconciliation? Must' we abandon all our fond anticipations?  3.  Will you deny' it? Will you deny' it?  4. Am I Dromio'? Am I your man'? Am I myself'?   RULE VII.--Interrogative exclamations, and words repeated as a kind of echo to the thought, require the rising inflection.  EXAMPLES. (25)  1. Where grows', where grows it not'?  2. What'! Might Rome have been taken'? Rome taken when I was consul'?  3. Banished from Rome'! Tried and convicted traitor'!  4. Prince Henry. What's the matter'?     Falstaff. What's the matter'? Here be four of us    have taken a thousand pounds this morning.     Prince H. Where is' it, Jack, where is' it?     Fal. Where is' it? Taken from us, it is.  5. Ha'! laughest thou, Lochiel, my vision to scorn?  6. And this man is called a statesman. A statesman'? Why, he never invented a decent humbug.  7. I can not say, sir, which of these motives influence the advocates of the bill before us; a bill', in which such cruelties are proposed as are yet unknown among the most savage nations.   RISING AND FALLING INFLECTIONS. (26)  RULE VIII.--Words and members of a sentence expressing antithesis or contrast, require opposite inflections.  EXAMPLES. (26)  1. By honor' and dishonor'; by evil' report and good' report; as deceivers' and yet true'.  2. What they know by reading', I know by experience'.  3. I could honor thy courage', but I detest thy crimes'.  4. It is easier to forgive the weak', who have injured us', than the powerful' whom we' have injured.  5. Homer was the greater genius', Virgil the better artist'.  6. The style of Dryden is capricious and varied'; that of Pope is cautious and uniform'. Dryden obeys the emotions of his own mind'; Pope constrains his mind to his own rules of composition.' Dryden is sometimes vehement and rapid'; Pope is always smooth, uniform, and gentle'. Dryden's page is a natural field, rising into inequalities, varied by exuberant vegetation'; Pope's is a velvet lawn, shaven by the scythe and leveled by the roller'.  7. If the flights of Dryden are higher', Pope continues longer on the wing'. If the blaze of Dryden's fire is brighter', the heat of Pope's is more regular and constant'. Dryden often surpasses' expectation, and Pope never falls below' it.  REMARK l.--Words and members connected by or used disjunctively, generally express contrast or antithesis, and always receive opposite inflection.   EXAMPLES. (27)  1. Shall we advance', or retreat'?  2. Do you seek wealth', or power'?  3. Is the great chain upheld by God', or thee'?  4. Shall we return to our allegiance while we may do so with safety and honor', or shall we wait until the ax of the executioner is at our throats'?  5. Shall we crown' the author of these public calamities with garlands', or shall we wrest' from him his ill-deserved authority' ?  REMARK 2.--When the antithesis is between affirmation and negation, the latter usually has the rising inflection, according to Rule V.   EXAMPLES. (27)  1. You were paid to fight' against Philip, not to rail' at him.  2. I said rationally', not irrationally'.  3. I did not say rationally', but irrationally'.  4. I said an elder' soldier, not a better'.  5. Let us retract while we can', not when we must'.  REMARK 3.--The more emphatic member generally receives the falling inflection.   EXAMPLES. (27)  1. A countenance more in sorrow', than anger'.  2. A countenance less in anger', than sorrow'.  3. You should show your courage by deeds', rather than by words.  4. If we can not remove' pain, we may alleviate' it.    OF SERIES. (28)  A series is a number of particulars immediately following one another in the same grammatical construction.  A commencing series is one which commences a sentence or clause.   EXAMPLE. (28)  Faith, hope, love, joy, are the fruits of the spirit.  A concluding series is one which concludes a sentence or a clause.   EXAMPLE. (28)  The fruits of the spirit are faith, hope, love, and joy.  RULE IX.--All the members of a commencing series, when not emphatic, usually require the rising inflection.   EXAMPLES. (28)  1. War', famine', pestilence', storm', and fire' besiege mankind.  2. The knowledge', the power', the wisdom', the goodness' of God, must all be unbounded.  3. To advise the ignorant', to relieve the needy', and to comfort the afflicted' are the duties that fall in our way almost every day of our lives.  4. No state chicanery', no narrow system of vicious politics', no idle contest for ministerial victories', sank him to the vulgar level of the great.  5. For solidity of reasoning', force of sagacity', and wisdom of conclusion', no nation or body of men can compare with the Congress at Philadelphia.  6. The wise and the foolish', the virtuous and the evil', the learned and the ignorant', the temperate and the profligate', must often be blended together.  7. Absalom's beauty', Jonathan's love', David's valor', Solomon's wisdom', the patience of Job, the prudence of Augustus', and the eloquence of Cicero' are found in perfection in the Creator.   REMARK.--Some elocutionists prefer to give the falling inflection to the last member of a commencing series.  Exception.--In a commencing series, forming a climax, the last term usually requires the falling inflection.   EXAMPLES. (29)  1. Days', months', years', and ages', shall circle away,    And still the vast waters above thee shall roll.  2. Property', character', reputation', everything', was sacrificed.  3. Toils', sufferings', wounds', and death' was the price of our liberty.   RULE X.--All the members of a concluding series, when not at all emphatic, usually require the falling inflection.   EXAMPLES. (29)  1. It is our duty to pity', to support', to defend', and to relieve' the oppressed.  2. At the sacred call of country, they sacrifice property', ease', health', applause' and even life'.  3. I protest against this measure as cruel', oppressive', tyrannous', and vindictive'.  4. God was manifest in the flesh', justified in the Spirit', seen of angels', preached unto the Gentiles', believed on in the world', received up into glory'.  5. Charity vaunteth not itself', is not puffed up', doth not behave itself unseemly', seeketh not her own', is not easily provoked', thinketh no evil'; beareth' all things, believeth' all things, hopeth' all things, endureth' all things.  REMARK.--Some authors give the following rule for the reading of a concluding series: \"All the particulars of a concluding series, except the last but one, require the falling inflection.\" Exception l.--When the particulars enumerated in a concluding series are not at all emphatic, all except the last require the rising inflection.   EXAMPLES (30)  He was esteemed for his kindness', his intelligence', his self-denial', and his active benevolence'.  Exception 2.--When all the terms of a concluding series are strongly emphatic, they all receive the falling inflection.  EXAMPLES. (30)  1. They saw not one man', not one woman', not one child', not one four-footed beast'.  2. His hopes', his happiness', his life', hung upon the words that fell from those lips,  3. They fought', they bled', they died', for freedom.    PARENTHESIS. (30)  RULE XI.--A parenthesis should be read more rapidly and in a lower key than the rest of the sentence, and should terminate with the same inflection that next precedes it. If, however, it is complicated, or emphatic, or disconnected from the main subject, the inflections must be governed by the same rules as in the other cases.  REMARK.--A smooth and expressive reading of a parenthesis is difficult of acquisition, and can be secured only by careful and persistent training.   EXAMPLES. (30)  1. God is my witness' (whom I serve with my spirit, in the gospel of his Son'), that, without ceasing, I make mention of you always in my prayers; making request' (if, by any means, now at length, I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God'), to come unto you.  2. When he had entered the room three paces, he stood still; and laying his left hand upon his breast' (a slender, white staff with which he journeyed being in his right'), he introduced himself with a little story of his convent.  3. If you, AEschines, in particular, were persuaded' (and it was no particular affection for me, that prompted you to give up the hopes, the appliances, the honors, which attended the course I then advised; but the superior force of truth, and your utter inability to point any course more eligible') if this was the case, I say, is it not highly cruel and unjust to arraign these measures now, when you could not then propose a better?  4. As the hour of conflict drew near' (and this was a conflict to be dreaded even by him'), he began to waver, and to abate much of his boasting.    CIRCUMFLEX. (31)  RULE XII.--The circumflex is used to express irony, sarcasm, hypothesis, or contrast.  NOTE.--For the reason that the circumflex always suggests a double or doubtful meaning, it is appropriate for the purposes expressed in the rule. It is, also, frequently used in sportive language; jokes and puns are commonly given with this inflection.   EXAMPLES. (31)  1. Man never is, but always to be, blest.  2. They follow an adventurer whom they fear; we serve a monarch whom we love. They boast, they come but to improve our state, enlarge our thoughts, and free us from the yoke of error. Yes, they will give enlightened freedom to our minds, who are themselves the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16751"],["title","McGuffey's Sixth Eclectic Reader (#5)"],["body","of passion, avarice, and pride. They offer us their protection: yes, such protection as vultures give to lambs, covering and devouring them.    MONOTONE. (32)  RULE XIII.--The use of the monotone is confined chiefly to grave and solemn subjects. When carefully and properly employed, it gives great dignity to delivery.   EXAMPLES. (32)  1. The unbeliever! one who can gaze upon the sun, and moon, and stars, and upon the unfading and imperishable sky, spread out so magnificently above him, and say, \"All this is the work of chance!\"  2. God walketh upon the ocean. Brilliantly    The glassy waters mirror back his smiles;    The surging billows, and the gamboling storms    Come crouching to his feet.  3. I hail thee, as in gorgeous robes,    Blooming thou leav'st the chambers of the east,    Crowned with a gemmed tiara thick embossed    With studs of living light.  4. High on a throne of royal state, which far    Outshone the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,    Or where the gorgeous east, with richest hand    Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,    Satan exalted sat.  5. His broad expanded wings    Lay calm and motionless upon the air,    As if he floated there without their aid,    By the sole act of his unlorded will.  6. In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds    On half the nations, and with fear of change    Perplexes monarchs.    III. ACCENT AND EMPHASIS. (33)  ACCENT.  That syllable in a word which is uttered more forcibly than the others, is said to be accented, and is marked thus, ('); as the italicized syllables in the following words:  morn'ing.     pos'si-ble. ty'rant.      re-cum'bent. pro-cure'.    ex-or'bi-tant, de-bate'.     com-pre-hen'sive.  Common usage alone determines upon what syllable the accent should be placed, and to the lexicographer it belongs, to ascertain and record its decision on this point.  In some few cases, we can trace the reasons for common usage in this respect. In words which are used as different parts of speech, or which have different meanings, the distinction is sometimes denoted by changing the accent.   EXAMPLES. (33)     sub'ject   sub-ject'    pres'ent   pre-sent'    ab'sent    ab-sent'    cem'ent    ce-ment'    con'jure   con-jure'   There is another case, in which we discover the reason for changing the accent, and that is, when it is required by emphasis, as in the following:   EXAMPLES. (33)  1. His abil'ity or in'ability to perform the act materially varies    the case. 2. This corrup'tion must put on in'corruption.    SECONDARY ACCENT. (34)  In words of more than two syllables, there is often a second accent given, but more slight than the principal one, and this is called the secondary accent; as, em\"igra'tion, rep\"artee', where the principal accent is marked ('), and the secondary, (\"); so, also, this accent is obvious, in nav\"iga'tion, com\"prehen'sion, plau\"sibil'ity, etc. The whole subject, however, properly belongs to dictionaries and spelling books.    EMPHASIS. (34)  Emphasis consists in uttering a word or phrase in such a manner as to give it force and energy, and to draw the attention of the hearer particularly to the idea expressed.  This is most frequently accomplished by an increased stress of voice laid upon the word or phrase. Sometimes, though more rarely, the same object is effected by an unusual lowering of the voice, even to a whisper, and not unfrequently by a pause before the emphatic word.  The inflections are often made subsidiary to this object. To give emphasis to a word, the inflection is changed or increased in force or extent. When the rising inflection is ordinarily used, the word, when emphatic, frequently takes the falling inflection; and sometimes, also, the falling inflection is changed into the rising inflection, for the same purpose.  Emphatic words are often denoted by being written in italics, in SMALL CAPITALS, or in CAPITALS.  Much care is necessary to train the pupil to give clear and expressive emphasis, and at the same time to avoid an unpleasant \"jerky\" movement of the voice.    ABSOLUTE EMPHASIS. (35)  Where the emphasis is independent of any contrast or comparison with other words or ideas, it is called absolute emphasis.   EXAMPLES. (35)  1. We praise thee, O God; we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.  2. Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll!  3. Arm, warriors, arm!  4. You know that you are Brutus, that speak this,    Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.  5. Hamlet. Saw, who?    Horatio. The king, your father.    Hamlet. The king, my father?  6. Strike--till the last armed foe expires;    Strike--for your altars and your fires;    Strike--for the green graves of your sites;    God, and your native land!    RELATIVE EMPHASIS. (35)  Where there is antithesis, either expressed or implied, the emphasis is called relative.   EXAMPLES. (35)  1.  We can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.  2.  But I am describing your condition, rather than my own.  3.  I fear not death, and shall I then fear thee?  4.  Hunting men, and not beasts, shall be his game.  5. He is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole world.  6. It may moderate and restrain, but it was not designed to banish gladness from the heart of man.  In the following examples, there are two sets of antitheses in the same sentence.  7. To err is human, to forgive, divine.  8. John was punished; William, rewarded.  9. Without were fightings, within were fears.  10. Business sweetens pleasure, as labor sweetens rest.  11. Justice appropriates rewards to merit, and punishments to crime.  12. On the one side, all was alacrity and courage; on the other, all was timidity and indecision.  13. The wise man is happy when he gains his own approbation; the fool, when he gains the applause of others.  14. His care was to polish the country by art, as he had protected it by arms.  In the following examples, the relative emphasis is applied to three sets of antithetic words.  15. The difference between a madman and a fool is, that the former reasons justly from false data; and the latter, erroneously from just data.  16. He raised a mortal to the skies,     She drew an angel down.  Sometimes the antithesis is implied, as in the following instances.  17. The spirit of the white man's heaven,     Forbids not thee to weep.  18. I shall enter on no encomiums upon Massachusetts.    EMPHASIS AND ACCENT. (37)  When words, which are the same in part of their formation, are contrasted, the emphasis is expressed by accenting the syllables in which they differ. See Accent, page 33.    EXAMPLES. (37)  1.  What is the difference between probability and possibility?  2.  Learn to unlearn what you have learned amiss.  3.  John attends regularly. William, irregularly.  4.  There is a great difference between giving and forgiving.  5.  The conduct of Antoninus was characterized by justice and humanity; that of Nero, by injustice and inhumanity.  6. The conduct of the former is deserving of approbation, while that of the latter merits the severest reprobation.   EMPHASIS AND INFLECTION. (37)  Emphasis sometimes changes the inflection from the rising to the falling, or from the falling to the rising. For instances of the former change, see Rule II, and Exception 1 to Rule IV. In the first three following examples, the inflection is changed from the rising to the falling inflection; in the last three, it is changed from the falling to the rising, by the influence of emphasis.   EXAMPLES. (37)   1. If we have no regard for religion in youth', we ought to have respect for it in age.  2. If we have no regard for our own' character, we ought to regard the character of others.  3. If content can not remove' the disquietudes of life, it will, at least, alleviate them.  4. The sweetest melody and the most perfect harmony fall powerless upon the ear of one who is deaf',  5. It is useless to expatiate upon the beauties of nature to one who is blind',  6. And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren'; but rather let them do them service.    EMPHATIC PHRASE. (38)  When it is desired to give to a phrase great force of expression, each word, and even the parts of a compound word, are independently emphasized.    EXAMPLES. (38)  1. Cassius. Must I endure all this?    Brutus. All this!--Ay,--more. Fret, till your proud--heart--break.  2. What! weep you when you but behold    Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look ye here,    Here is himself, marred, as you see, by traitors.  3. There was a time, my fellow-citizens, when the Lacedaemonians were sovereign masters, both by sea and by land; while this state had not one ship--no, NOT--ONE--WALL.  4. Shall I, the conqueror of Spain and Gaul; and not only of the Alpine nations, but of the Alps themselves; shall I compare myself with this HALF--YEAR--CAPTAIN?  5. You call me misbeliever--cutthroat--dog.    Hath a dog--money? Is it possible--    A cur can lend three--thousand--ducats?    EMPHATIC PAUSE. (39)  A short pause is often made before or after, and sometimes both before and after, an emphatic word or phrase,--thus very much increasing the emphatic expression of the thought.  EXAMPLES. (39)  1. May one be pardoned, and retain--the offense?    In the corrupted currents of this world,    Offense's gilded hand may shove by--justice;    And oft 'tis seen, the wicked prize itself    Buys out the law: but 't is not so--above:    There--is no shuffling: there--the action lies    In its true nature.  2. He woke to hear his sentries shriek,    \"To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!    He woke--to die--midst flame and smoke.\"  3. This--is no flattery: These--are counselors    That feelingly persuade me what I am.  4. And this--our life, exempt from public haunt,    Finds tongues--in tree, books--in the running brooks,    Sermons--in stones, and--good in everything.  5. Heaven gave this Lyre, and thus decreed,    Be thou a bruised--but not a broken-"]]]
