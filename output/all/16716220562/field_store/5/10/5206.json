And here where once their smiles were seen we keep a printed scroll;     The absent boy we long to see is on the honor roll.      So quickly did the summons come we scarcely marked the change,     One day life marched its normal pace, the next all things seemed strange,     And when we questioned where they were, the sturdiest of us all,     We saw the silent honor roll on each familiar wall.      The laughter that we knew has gone; the merry voice of youth     No longer rings where graybeards sit, discussing sombre truth.     No longer jests are flung about to rouse our weary souls,     For they who meant so much to us are on our honor rolls.             The Princess Pats       A touch of the plain and the prairie,       A bit of the Motherland, too;     A strain of the fur-trapper wary,       A blend of the old and the new;     A bit of the pioneer splendor       That opened the wilderness' flats,     A touch of the home-lover, tender,       You'll find in the boys they call Pats.      The glory and grace of the maple,       The strength that is born of the wheat,     The pride of a stock that is staple,       The bronze of a midsummer heat;     A blending of wisdom and daring,       The best of a new land, and that's     The regiment gallantly bearing       The neat little title of Pats.      A bit of the man who has neighbored       With mountains and forests and streams,     A touch of the man who has labored       To model and fashion his dreams;     The strength of an age of clean living,       Of right-minded fatherly chats,     The best that a land could be giving       Is there in the breasts of the Pats.             July the Fourth, 1917       Time was the cry went round the world:       America for freedom speaks,     A new flag is to-day unfurled,       An eagle on the mountain shrieks,     A king is failing on his throne,       A race of men defies his power!     And no one could have guessed or known       The burden of that splendid hour.      A bell rang out that summer day       And men and women stood and heard;     That tongue of brass had more to say       Than could be spoken by a word.     It spoke the thoughts of honest men,       It whispered Destiny's intents     And rang a warning loudly then       To Kings of all the continents.      The old bell in its holy loft       Where pigeons nest, has ceased to swing     And yet through many a day and oft       A weary people hear it sing.     That hour long years ago, when first       America for freedom fought,     The bonds of slavery were burst:       That hour began the reign of thought.      Here comes another summer day:       America is on the sea,     America has dared to say       That other people shall be free.     No selfish stain her banner mars,       Her flag, for truth and right, unfurled,     With every stripe and all its stars       Still speaks its message to the world      Out where the soldiers fight for men,       Out where, for others, heroes die,     Out where they storm the Tyrant's den,       The Starry Banner lights the sky.     And once again the cry goes out       That brings the flush of hope to cheeks     Grown pale by bitter war and doubt:       \"America for Freedom speaks.\"             Spring in the Trenches       It's coming time for planting in that little patch of ground,     Where the lad and I made merry as he followed me around;     The sun is getting higher, and the skies above are blue,     And I'm hungry for the garden, and I wish the war were through.           But it's tramp, tramp, tramp,            And it's never look behind,          And when you see a stranger's kids,            Pretend that you are blind.      The spring is coming back again, the birds begin to mate;     The skies are full of kindness, but the world is full of hate.     And it's I that should be bending now in peace above the soil,     With laughing eyes and little hands about to bless the toil.           But it's fight, fight, fight,            And it's charge at double-quick;          A soldier thinking thoughts of home            Is one more soldier sick.      Last year I brought the bulbs to bloom and saw the roses bud;     This year I'm ankle deep in mire, and most of it is blood.     Last year the mother in the door was glad as she could be;     To-day her heart is full of pain, and mine is hurting me.           But it's shoot, shoot, shoot,            And when the bullets hiss,          Don't let the tears fill up your eyes,            For weeping soldiers miss.      Oh, who will tend the roses now and who will sow the seeds?     And who will do the heavy work the little garden needs?     And who will tell the lad of mine the things he wants to know,     And take his hand and lead him round the paths we used to go?           For it's charge, charge, charge,            And it's face the foe once more;          Forget the things you love the most            And keep your mind on war.             Bigger Than His Dad       He has heard his country calling, and has fallen into line,       And he's doing something bigger than his daddy ever did;     He has caught a greater vision than the finest one of mine,       And I know to-day I'm prouder of than sorry for the kid.      His speech is soft and vibrant with the messages of truth,       And he says some things of duty that I cannot understand;     It may be that I'm selfish, but this ending of his youth       Is not the dream I cherished and it's not the thing I planned.      I only know he's bigger in his uniform to-day       Than I, who stand and watch him as he drills, have ever been;     That he sees a greater vision of life's purpose far away,       And a finer goal to die for than my eyes have ever seen.      I wish I felt as he does, wish I had his sense of right;       With the vision he possesses I should be supremely glad;     But I sometimes start to choking when I think of him at night--       The boy that has grown bigger, yes, and better than his dad.             The Boy's Adventure       \"Dear Father,\" he wrote me from Somewhere in France,     Where he's waiting with Pershing to lead the advance,     \"There's little the censor permits me to tell     Save the fact that I'm here and am happy and well.     The French people cheered as we marched from our ship     At the close of a really remarkable trip;     They danced and they screamed and they shouted and ran,     And I blush as I write. I was kissed by a man!      \"I've seen a great deal since I bade you good-bye,     I have witnessed a battle far up in the sky;     I have heard the dull roar of a long line of guns,     And seen the destruction that's worked by the Huns;     Some scenes I'll remember, and some I'll forget,     But the welcome he gave me! I'm feeling it yet.     Oh, try to imagine your boy if you can,     As he looked and he felt, being kissed by a man!      \"'Ah, Meestaire!' he cried in a voice that was shrill,     And his queer little eyes with delight seemed to fill,     And before I was wise to the custom, or knew     Just what he was up to, about me he threw     His arms, and he hugged me, and then with a squeak,     He planted a chaste little kiss on each cheek.     He was stocky and strong and his whiskers were tan.     Now please keep it dark. I've been kissed by a man.\"             Out of It All       Out of it all shall come splendor and gladness;     Out of the madness and out of the sadness,     Clearer and finer the world shall arise.     Why then keep sorrow and doubt in your eyes?      Joy shall be ours when the warfare is over;     Children shall gleefully romp in the clover;     Here with our heroes at home and at rest,     We shall rejoice with the world at its best.      Not in vain, not in vain, is our bright banner flying;     Not for naught are the sons of our fond mothers dying;     The gloom and despair are not ever to last;     The world shall be better when they shall have passed.      So mourn not his absence, but smile and be brave;     You shall have him again from the brink of the grave     In a wonderful world 'neath a wonderful sun;     He shall come to your arms with his victory won.             The Christmas Box       Oh, we have shipped his Christmas box with ribbons red 'tis tied,     And he shall find the things he likes from them he loves inside,     But he must miss the kisses true and all the laughter gay     And he must miss the smiles of home upon his Christmas Day.      He'll spend his Christmas 'neath the Flag; he'll miss each merry face,     Old Glory smiling down on him must take his mother's place,     Yet in the Christmas box we've sent, in fancy he will find     The laughter and the tears of joy that he has left behind.      His mother's tenderness is there, his father's kindly way,     And all that went last year to make his merry Christmas Day;     He'll see once more his sister's smile, he'll hear the baby shout,     And as he opens every gift we'll gather round about.      He cannot come to share with us the joys of Christmas Day;     The Flag has called to him, and he is serving far away.     Undaunted, unafraid and fine he stands to duty grim,     And so this Christmas we have tried to ship ourselves to him.             A Plea       God grant me these: the strength to do       Some needed service here;     The wisdom to be brave and true;       The gift of vision clear,     That in each task that comes to me     Some purpose I may plainly see.      God teach me to believe that I       Am stationed at a post,     Although the humblest 'neath the sky,       Where I am needed most,     And that, at last, if I do well,     My humble services will tell.      God grant me faith to stand on guard,       Uncheered, unspoke, alone,     And see behind such duty hard       My service to the throne."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16632"],["title","Over Here (#7)"],["body","'er my task, be this my creed:     I am on earth to fill a need.             Your Country Needs You       The country needs a man like you,     It has a task for you to do.     It has a job for you to face.     Somewhere for you it has a place.     Not all the slackers dodge the work     Of service where the cannon lurk,     Not all the slackers on life's stage     Are boys of military age.     The old, the youthful and unfit     Must also do their little bit.      The country needs a man like you,     'Twill suffer if you prove untrue.     What though you cannot bear a gun?     That isn't all that's to be done.     There are a thousand other ways     To serve your country through the days     Of trial and the nights of storm.     You need not wear a uniform     Or with the men in council sit     To serve the Flag and do your bit.      Somewhere for you there is a place,     Somewhere you have a task to face.     There's none so helpless or so frail     That cannot, when our foes assail,     In some way help our common cause     And be deserving of applause.     Behind the Flag we all must be,     Each at his post, awake to see     That in so far as he has striven,     His best was to his country given.      You can be patient, brave and strong,     And not complain when plans go wrong;     You can be cheerful at your toil,     Or till, perhaps, some patch of soil;     You can encourage others who     Have heavier, greater tasks to do;     You can be loyal, not in creed     Alone, but in each thought and deed;     You can make sacrifices, too.     The country needs a man like you,             A Creed       To keep in mind from day to day     That I'm a soldier in the fray;     That I must serve, from sun to sun,     As well as he who bears a gun     The flag that flies above us all,     And answer well my Country's call.      I must not for one hour forget     Unto the Stars and Stripes my debt.     'Twas spotless on' my day of birth,     And when at last I quit this earth     Old Glory still must spotless be     For all who follow after me.      At some post where my work will fit     I must with courage do my bit;     Some portion of myself I'd give     That freedom and the Flag may live.     And in some way I want to feel     That I am doing service real.      I must in all I say and do     Respect the red, the white and blue',     Nor dim with petty deeds of shame     The splendor of Old Glory's fame;     I must not let my standards drag,     For my disgrace would stain the Flag.             The Struggle       Life is a struggle for peace,       A longing for rest,     A hope for the battles to cease,       A dream for the best;     And he is not living who stays       Contented with things,     Unconcerned with the work of the days       And all that it brings.      He is dead who sees nothing to change,       No wrong to make right;     Who travels no new way or strange       In search of the light;     Who never sets out for a goal       That he sees from afar     But contents his indifferent soul       With things as they are.      Life isn't rest--it is toil;       It is building a dream;     It is tilling a parcel of soil       Or bridging a stream;     It's pursuing the light of a star       That but dimly we see,     And in wresting from things as they are       The joy that should be.             As It Looks to the Boy       His comrades have enlisted, but his mother bids him stay,     His soul is sick with coward shame, his head hangs low to-day,     His eyes no longer sparkle, and his breast is void of pride     And I think that she has lost him though she's kept him at her side.     Oh, I'm sorry for the mother, but I'm sorrier for the lad     Who must look on life forever as a hopeless dream and sad.      He must fancy men are sneering as they see him walk the street,     He will feel his cheeks turn crimson as his eyes another's meet;     And the boys and girls that knew him as he was but yesterday,     Will not seem to smile upon him, in the old familiar way.     He will never blame his mother, but when he's alone at night,     His thoughts will flock to tell him that he isn't doing right.      Oh, I'm sorry for the mother from whose side a boy must go,     And the strong desire to keep him that she feels, I think I know,     But the boy that she's so fond of has a life to live on earth,     And he hungers to be busy with the work that is of worth.     He will sicken and grow timid, he'll be flesh without a heart     Until death at last shall claim him, if he doesn't do his part.      Have you kept him, gentle mother? Has he lost his old-time cheer?     Is he silent, sad and sullen? Are his eyes no longer clear?     Is he growing weak and flabby who but yesterday was strong?     Then a secret grief he's nursing and I'll tell you what is wrong.     All his comrades have departed on their country's noblest work,     And he hungers to be with them--it is not his wish to shirk.             Fly a Clean Flag       This I heard the Old Flag say     As I passed it yesterday:     \"Months ago your friendly hands     Fastened me on slender strands     And with patriotic love     Placed me here to wave above     You and yours. I heard you say     On that long departed day:     'Flag of all that's true and fine,     Wave above this house of mine;     Be the first at break of day     And the last at night to say     To the world this word of cheer:     Loyalty abideth here.'      \"Here on every wind that's blown,     O'er your\" portal I have flown;     Rain and snow have battered me,     Storms at night have tattered me;     Dust of street and chimney stack     Day by day have stained me black,     And I've watched you passing there,     Wondering how much you care.     Have you noticed that your flag,     Is to-day a wind-blown rag?     Has your love so careless grown     By the long neglect you've shown     That you never raise your eye     To the symbol that you fly?\"      \"Flag, on which no stain has been,     'Tis my sin that you're unclean,\"     Then I answered in my shame.     \"On my head must lie the blame.     Now with patriotic hands     I release you from your strands,     And a spotless flag shall fly     Here to greet each passer-by.     Nevermore shall Flag of mine     Be a sad and sorry sign     Telling all who look above     I neglect the thing I love.     But my Flag of faith shall be     Fit for every eye to see.\"             To a Kindly Critic       If it's wrong to believe in the land that we love     And to pray for Our Flag to the good God above;     If it's wrong to believe that Our Country is best;     That honor's her standard, and truth is her crest;     If placing her first in our prayers and our song     Is false to true reason, we're glad to be wrong.      If it's wrong to wish victory day after day     For the troops of Our Country now marching away;     If it's wrong to believe they are moved by the right     And not by the love and the lure of the fight;     If to cheer them to battle and bid them be strong     Is false to right thinking, then let us be wrong.      If it's wrong to believe in America's dreams     Of a freedom on earth that's as real as it seems;     If it's error to cherish the hope, through and through,     That the Stars in Old Glory's immaculate blue     Shall shine through the ages, true beacons to men,     We pray that no right phrase shall flow from our pen.             War's Homecoming       We little thought how much they meant--the bleeding hearts of France,     And British mothers wearing black to mark some troop's advance,     The war was, O, so distant then, the grief so far away,     We couldn't see the weeping eyes, nor hear the women pray.     We couldn't sense the weight of woe that rested on that land,     But now our boy is called to go--to-day, we understand.      There, some have heard the blackest news that o'er the wires has sped,     And some are living day by day beneath the clouds of dread;     Some fear the worst; some know the worst, but every heart is chilled,     And every soul is sorrow touched and laughter there is stilled.     There, old folks sit alone and grieve and pray for peace to come,     And now our little boy has heard the summons of the drum.      Their grief was such a distant thing, we made it fruit for speech.     We never thought in days of old such pain our hearts would reach.     We talked of it, as people do of sorrow far aloof,     Nor dreamed such care would ever dwell beneath our happy roof.     But England's woes are ours to-day, we share the sighs of France;     Our little boy is on the sea with Death to take his chance.             Next of Kin       I notice when the news comes in       Of one who's claimed eternal glory,     This simple phrase, \"the next of kin,\"       Concludes the soldier's final story.     This tells the world what voice will choke,     What heart that bit of shrapnel broke,     What father or what mother brave     Will think of Flanders as a grave.      \"The next of kin,\" the cable cold       Wastes not a precious word in telling,     Yet cannot you and I behold       The sorrow in some humble dwelling,     And cannot you and I perceive     The brave yet lonely mother grieve     And picture, when that news comes in,     The anguish of \"the next of kin?\"      For every boy in uniform,       Another soldier brave is fighting;     A double rank the cannons storm,       Two lines the cables are uniting,     And with the hurt each soldier feels,     At home the other warrior reels;     Two suffer, freedom's cause to win:     The soldier and \"the next of kin.\"      Oh, next of kin, be brave, be strong,       As brave as was the boy that's missing;     The years will many be and long       That you will hunger for his kissing.     Yet he enlisted you with him     To share war's bitter price and grim;     Your service runs through many years     Because your name with his appears.        "]]]
