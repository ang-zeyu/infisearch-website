COLLEGE AND CHURCH   In 1867 I introduced the first purely metaphysical system of healing since the apostolic days. I began by teaching one student Christian Science Mind-healing. From this seed grew the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in Boston, chartered in 1881. No charter was granted for similar purposes after 1883. It is the only College, hitherto, for teaching the pathology of spiritual power, _alias_ the Science of Mind-healing.  My husband, Asa G. Eddy, taught two terms in my College. After I gave up teaching, my adopted son, Ebenezer J. Foster-Eddy, a graduate of the Hahneman Medical College of Philadelphia, and who also received a certificate from Dr. W.W. Keen's (allopathic) Philadelphia School of Anatomy and Surgery,--having renounced his material method of practice and embraced the teachings of Christian Science, taught the Primary, Normal, and Obstetric class one term. Gen. Erastus N. Bates taught one Primary class, in 1889, after which I judged it best to close the institution. These students of mine were the only assistant teachers in the College.  The first Christian Scientist Association was organized by myself and six of my students in 1876, on the Centennial Day of our nation's freedom. At a meeting of the Christian Scientist Association, on April 12, 1879, it was voted to organize a church to commemorate the words and works of our Master, a Mind-healing church, without a creed, to be called the Church of Christ, Scientist, the first such church ever organized. The charter for this church was obtained in June, 1879,[D] and during the same month the members, twenty-six in number, extended a call to me to become their pastor. I accepted the call, and was ordained in 1881, though I had preached five years before being ordained.  When I was its pastor, and in the pulpit every Sunday, my church increased in members, and its spiritual growth kept pace with its increasing popularity; but when obliged, because of accumulating work in the College, to preach only occasionally, no student, at that time, was found able to maintain the church in its previous harmony and prosperity.  Examining the situation prayerfully and carefully, noting the church's need, and the predisposing and exciting cause of its condition, I saw that the crisis had come when much time and attention must be given to defend this church from the envy and molestation of other churches, and from the danger to its members which must always lie in Christian warfare. At this juncture I recommended that the church be dissolved. No sooner were my views made known, than the proper measures were adopted to carry them out, the votes passing without a dissenting voice.  This measure was immediately followed by a great revival of mutual love, prosperity, and spiritual power.  The history of that hour holds this true record. Adding to its ranks and influence, this spiritually organized Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, still goes on. A new light broke in upon it, and more beautiful became the garments of her who \"bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace.\"  Despite the prosperity of my church, it was learned that material organization has its value and peril, and that organization is requisite only in the earliest periods in Christian history. After this material form of cohesion and fellowship has accomplished its end, continued organization retards spiritual growth, and should be laid off,--even as the corporeal organization deemed requisite in the first stages of mortal existence is finally laid off, in order to gain spiritual freedom and supremacy.  From careful observation and experience came my clue to the uses and abuses of organization. Therefore, in accord with my special request, followed that noble, unprecedented action of the Christian Scientist Association connected with my College when dissolving that organization,--in forgiving enemies, returning good for evil, in following Jesus' command, \"Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.\" I saw these fruits of Spirit, long-suffering and temperance, fulfil the law of Christ in righteousness. I also saw that Christianity has withstood less the temptation of popularity than of persecution.     \"FEED MY SHEEP\"  Lines penned when I was pastor of the Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston.       Shepherd, show me how to go       O'er the hillside steep,     How to gather, how to sow,--       How to feed Thy sheep;     I will listen for Thy voice,       Lest my footsteps stray;     I will follow and rejoice       All the rugged way.      Thou wilt bind the stubborn will,       Wound the callous breast,     Make self-righteousness be still,       Break earth's stupid rest.     Strangers on a barren shore,       Lab'ring long and lone,     We would enter by the door,       And Thou know'st Thine own.      So, when day grows dark and cold,       Tear or triumph harms,     Lead Thy lambkins to the fold,       Take them in Thine arms;     Feed the hungry, heal the heart,       Till the morning's beam;     White as wool, ere they depart,       Shepherd, wash them clean.     COLLEGE CLOSED   The apprehension of what has been, and must be, the final outcome of material organization, which wars with Love's spiritual compact, caused me to dread the unprecedented popularity of my College. Students from all over our continent, and from Europe, were flooding the school. At this time there were over three hundred applications from persons desiring to enter the College, and applicants were rapidly increasing. Example had shown the dangers arising from being placed on earthly pinnacles, and Christian Science shuns whatever involves material means for the promotion of spiritual ends.  In view of all this, a meeting was called of the Board of Directors of my College, who, being informed of my intentions, unanimously voted that the school be discontinued.  A Primary class student, richly imbued with the spirit of Christ, is a better healer and teacher than a Normal class student who partakes less of God's love. After having received instructions in a Primary class from me, or a loyal student, and afterwards studied thoroughly Science and Health, a student can enter upon the gospel work of teaching Christian Science, and so fulfil the command of Christ. But before entering this field of labor he must have studied the latest editions of my works, be a good Bible scholar and a consecrated Christian.  The Massachusetts Metaphysical College drew its breath from me, but I was yearning for retirement. The question was, Who else could sustain this institute, under all that was aimed at its vital purpose, the establishment of _genuine_ Christian Science healing? My conscientious scruples about diplomas, the recent experience of the church fresh in my thoughts, and the growing conviction that every one should build on his own foundation, subject to the one builder and maker, God,--all these considerations moved me to close my flourishing school, and the following resolutions were passed:--      At a special meeting of the Board of the Metaphysical College     Corporation, Oct. 29, 1889, the following are some of the     resolutions which were presented and passed unanimously:--      WHEREAS, The Massachusetts Metaphysical College,     chartered in January, 1881, for medical purposes, to give     instruction in scientific methods of mental healing on a purely     practical basis, to impart a thorough understanding of     metaphysics, to restore health, hope, and harmony to man,--has     fulfilled its high and noble destiny, and sent to all parts of our     country, and into foreign lands, students instructed in Christian     Science Mind-healing, to meet the demand of the age for something     higher than physic or drugging; and      WHEREAS, The material organization was, in the beginning     in this institution, like the baptism of Jesus, of which he said,     \"Suffer it to be so now,\" though the teaching was a purely     spiritual and scientific impartation of Truth, whose Christly     spirit has led to higher ways, means, and understanding,--the     President, the Rev. Mary B.G. Eddy, at the height of prosperity     in the institution, which yields a large income, is willing to     sacrifice all for the advancement of the world in Truth and Love;     and      WHEREAS, Other institutions for instruction in Christian     Science, which are working out their periods of organization, will     doubtless follow the example of the _Alma Mater_ after having     accomplished the worthy purpose for which they were organized, and     the hour has come wherein the great need is for more of the spirit     instead of the letter, and Science and Health is adapted to work     this result; and      WHEREAS, The fundamental principle for growth in     Christian Science is spiritual formation first, last, and always,     while in human growth material organization is first; and      WHEREAS, Mortals must learn to lose their estimate of the     powers that are not ordained of God, and attain the bliss of     loving unselfishly, working patiently, and conquering all that is     unlike Christ and the example he gave; therefore      _Resolved_, That we thank the State for its charter, which is the     only one ever granted to a _legal college_ for teaching the     Science of Mind-healing; that we thank the public for its liberal     patronage. And everlasting gratitude is due to the President, for     her great and noble work, which we believe will prove a healing     for the nations, and bring all men to a knowledge of the true God,     uniting them in one common brotherhood.      After due deliberation and earnest discussion it was unanimously     voted: That as all debts of the corporation have been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16734"],["title","Retrospection and Introspection (#6)"],["body","id, it is     deemed best to dissolve this corporation, and the same is hereby     dissolved.      C.A. FRYE, _Clerk_.  When God impelled me to set a price on my instruction in Christian Science Mind-healing, I could think of no financial equivalent for an impartation of a knowledge of that divine power which heals; but I was led to name three hundred dollars as the price for each pupil in one course of lessons at my College,--a startling sum for tuition lasting barely three weeks. This amount greatly troubled me. I shrank from asking it, but was finally led, by a strange providence, to accept this fee.  God has since shown me, in multitudinous ways, the wisdom of this decision; and I beg disinterested people to ask my loyal students if they consider three hundred dollars any real equivalent for my instruction during twelve half-days, or even in half as many lessons. Nevertheless, my list of indigent charity scholars is very large, and I have had as many as seventeen in one class.  Loyal students speak with delight of their pupilage, and of what it has done for them, and for others through them. By loyalty in students I mean this,--allegiance to God, subordination of the human to the divine, steadfast justice, and strict adherence to divine Truth and Love.  I see clearly that students in Christian Science should, at present, continue to organize churches, schools, and associations for the furtherance and unfolding of Truth, and that my necessity is not necessarily theirs; but it was the Father's opportunity for furnishing a new rule of order in divine Science, and the blessings which arose therefrom. Students are not environed with such obstacles as were encountered in the beginning of pioneer work.  In December, 1889, I gave a lot of land in Boston to my student, Mr. Ira O. Knapp of Roslindale,--valued in 1892 at about twenty thousand dollars, and rising in value,--to be appropriated for the erection, and building on the premises thereby conveyed, of a church edifice to be used as a temple for Christian Science worship.     GENERAL ASSOCIATIONS, AND OUR MAGAZINE   For many successive years I have endeavored to find new ways and means for the promotion and expansion of scientific Mind-healing, seeking to broaden its channels and, if possible, to build a hedge round about it that should shelter its perfections from the contaminating influences of those who have a small portion of its letter and less of its spirit. At the same time I have worked to provide a home for every true seeker and honest worker in this vineyard of Truth.  To meet the broader wants of humanity, and provide folds for the sheep that were without shepherds, I suggested to my students, in 1886, the propriety of forming a National Christian Scientist Association. This was immediately done, and delegations from the Christian Scientist Association of the Massachusetts Metaphysical College, and from branch associations in other States, met in general convention at New York City, February 11, 1886.  The first official organ of the Christian Scientist Association was called _Journal of Christian Science_. I started it, April, 1883, as editor and publisher.  To the National Christian Scientist Association, at its meeting in Cleveland, Ohio, June, 1889, I sent a letter, presenting to its loyal members _The Christian Science Journal_, as it was now called, and the funds belonging thereto. This monthly magazine had been made successful and prosperous under difficult circumstances and was designed to bear aloft the standard of genuine Christian Science.     FAITH-CURE   It is often asked, Why are faith-cures sometimes more speedy than some of the cures wrought through Christian Scientists? Because faith is belief, and not understanding; and it is easier to believe, than to understand spiritual Truth. It demands less cross-bearing, self-renunciation, and divine Science to admit the claims of the corporeal senses and appeal to God for relief through a humanized conception of His power, than to deny these claims and learn the divine way,--drinking Jesus' cup, being baptized with his baptism, gaining the end through persecution and purity.  Millions are believing in God, or good, without bearing the fruits of goodness, not having reached its Science. Belief is virtually blindness, when it admits Truth without understanding it. Blind belief cannot say with the apostle, \"I know whom I have believed.\" There is danger in this mental state called belief; for if Truth is admitted, but not understood, it may be lost, and error may enter through this same channel of ignorant belief. The faith-cure has devout followers, whose Christian practice is far in advance of their theory.  The work of healing, in the Science of Mind, is the most sacred and salutary power which can be wielded. My Christian students, impressed with the true sense of the great work before them, enter this strait and narrow path, and work conscientiously.  Let us follow the example of Jesus, the master Metaphysician, and gain sufficient knowledge of error to destroy it with Truth. Evil is not mastered by evil; it can only be overcome with good. This brings out the nothingness of evil and the eternal somethingness, vindicates the divine Principle, and improves the race of Adam.     FOUNDATION-STONES   The following ideas of Deity, antagonized by finite theories, doctrines, and hypotheses, I found to be demonstrable rules in Christian Science, and that we must abide by them.  Whatever diverges from the one divine Mind, or God,--or divides Mind into minds, Spirit into spirits, Soul into souls, and Being into beings,--is a misstatement of the unerring divine Principle of Science, which interrupts the meaning of the omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence of Spirit, and is of human instead of divine origin.  War is waged between the evidences of Spirit and the evidences of the five physical senses; and this contest must go on until peace be declared by the final triumph of Spirit in immutable harmony. Divine Science disclaims sin, sickness, and death, on the basis of the omnipotence and omnipresence of God, or divine good.  All consciousness is Mind, and Mind is God. Hence there is but one Mind; and that one is the infinite good, supplying all Mind by the reflection, not the subdivision, of God. Whatever else claims to be mind, or consciousness, is untrue. The sun sends forth light, but not suns; so God reflects Himself, or Mind, but does not subdivide Mind, or good, into minds, good and evil. Divine Science demands mighty wrestlings with mortal beliefs, as we sail into the eternal haven over the unfathomable sea of possibilities.  Neither ancient nor modern philosophy furnishes a scientific basis for the Science of Mind-healing. Plato believed he had a soul, which must be doctored in order to heal his body. This would be like correcting the principle of music for the purpose of destroying discord. Principle is right; it is practice that is wrong. Soul is right; it is the flesh that is evil. Soul is the synonym of Spirit, God; hence there is but one Soul, and that one is infinite. If that pagan philosopher had known that physical sense, not Soul, causes all bodily ailments, his philosophy would have yielded to Science.  Man shines by borrowed light. He reflects God as his Mind, and this reflection is substance,--the substance of good. Matter is substance in error, Spirit is substance in Truth.  Evil, or error, is not Mind; but infinite Mind is sufficient to supply all manifestations of intelligence. The notion of more than one Mind, or Life, is as unsatisfying as it is unscientific. All must be of God, and not our own, separated from Him.  Human systems of philosophy and religion are departures from Christian Science. Mistaking divine Principle for corporeal personality, ingrafting upon one First Cause such opposite effects as good and evil, health and sickness, life and death; making mortality the status and rule of divinity,--such methods can never reach the perfection and demonstration of metaphysical, or Christian Science.  Stating the divine Principle, omnipotence (_omnis potens_), and then departing from this statement and taking the rule of finite matter, with which to work out the problem of infinity or Spirit,--all this is like trying to compensate for the absence of omnipotence by a physical, false, and finite substitute.  With our Master, life was not merely a sense of existence, but an accompanying sense of power that subdued matter and brought to light immortality, insomuch that the people \"were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.\" Life, as defined by Jesus, had no beginning; it was not the result of organization, or infused into matter; it was Spirit.     THE GREAT REVELATION   Christian Science reveals the grand verity, that to believe man has a finite and erring mind, and consequently a mortal mind and soul and life, is error. Scientific terms have no contradictory significations.  In Science, Life is not temporal, but eternal, without beginning or ending. The word _Life_ never means that which is the source of death, and of good and evil. Such an inference is unscientific. It is like saying that addition means subtraction in one instance and addition in another, and then applying this rule to a demonstration of the science of numbers; even as mortals apply finite terms to God, in demonstration of infinity. _Life_ is a term used to indicate Deity; and every other name for the Supreme Being, if properly employed, has the signification of Life. Whatever errs is mortal, and is the antipodes of Life, or God, and of health and holiness, both in idea and demonstration.  Christian Science reveals Mind, the only living and true God, and all that is made by Him, Mind, as harmonious, immortal, and spiritual: the five material senses define Mind and matter as distinct, but mutually dependent, each on the other, for intelligence and"]]]
