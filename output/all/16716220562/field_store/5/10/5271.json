Most of the passengers--there were only twenty first and about a dozen second class--were in our boat, and among the second-class passengers with us were a few Portuguese soldiers going from Macao to Delagoa Bay.  Some of us were slightly bruised, and all were shaken, but luckily none required medical treatment. Chairs were quickly found for the ladies, the men seated themselves on the hatch, and the German sailors busied themselves bringing tea and cigarettes to their latest captives. We were then left to ourselves for a short time on deck, and just before dark a spruce young Lieutenant came up to me, saluted, and asked me to tell all the passengers that we were to follow him and go aft. We followed him along the ship, which seemed to be very crowded, to the well deck aft, where we met the remaining few passengers and some of the crew of the _Hitachi_. We had evidently come across a new type of Hun. The young Lieutenant was most polite, and courteous and attentive. He apologized profusely for the discomfort which the ladies and ourselves would have to put up with--\"But it is war, you know, and your Government is to blame for allowing you to travel when they know a raider is out\"--assured us he would do what he could to make us as comfortable as possible, and that we should not be detained more than two or three days. This was the first of a countless number of lies told us by the Germans as to their intentions concerning us.  We had had nothing to eat since tiffin, so we were ordered below to the 'tween decks to have supper. We clambered down a ladder to partake of our first meal as prisoners. What a contrast to the last meal we enjoyed on the _Hitachi_, taken in comfort and apparent security! (But, had we known it, we were doomed even then, for the raider's seaplane had been up and seen us at 11 a.m., had reported our position to the raider, and announced 3 p.m. as the time for our capture. Our captors were not far out! It was between 2.30 and 3 when we were taken.) The meal consisted of black bread and raw ham, with hot tea in a tin can, into which we dipped our cups. We sat around on wooden benches, in a small partitioned-off space, and noticed that the crockery on which the food was served had been taken from other ships captured--one of the Burns Philp Line, and one of the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand. Some of the Japanese officers and crew were also in the 'tween decks--later on the Japanese Captain appeared (we had not seen him since he left the _Hitachi_ saloon after tiffin), and he was naturally very down and distressed--and some of the German sailors came and spoke to us. Shortly after, the young Lieutenant came down and explained why the raider, which the German sailors told us was the _Wolf_, had fired on us. We then learnt for the first time that many persons had been killed outright by the firing--another direct result of the _Hitachi's_ failure to obey the raider's orders to stop. It was impossible to discover how many. There must have been about a dozen, as the total deaths numbered sixteen, all Japanese or Indians; the latest death from wounds occurred on October 28th, while one or two died while we were on the _Wolf_. The Lieutenant, who we afterwards learnt was in charge of the prisoners, told us that the _Wolf_ had signalled us to stop, and not to use our wireless or our gun, for the _Hitachi_ mounted a gun on her poop for the submarine zone. He asserted that the _Hitachi_ hoisted a signal that she understood the order, but that she tried to use her wireless, that she brought herself into position to fire on the _Wolf_, and that preparations were being made to use her gun. If the _Hitachi_ had manoeuvred at all, it was simply so that she should not[1] present her broadside as a target for a torpedo from the raider.  The Germans professed deep regret at the _Hitachi's_ action and at the loss of life caused, the first occasion, they said--and, we believe, with truth--on which lives had been lost since the _Wolf's_ cruise began. The _Wolf_, however, they said, had no choice but to fire and put the _Hitachi_ gun out of action. This she failed to do, as the shooting was distinctly poor, with the exception of the shot aimed at the wireless room, which went straight through the room, without exploding there or touching the operator, and exploded near the funnel, killing most of the crew who met their deaths while running to help lower the boats. The other shots had all struck the ship in the second-class quarters astern. One had gone right through the cabin of the Second Steward, passing just over his bunk--where he had been asleep a minute before--and through the side of the ship. Others had done great damage to the ship's structure aft, but none had gone anywhere near the gun or ammunition house on the poop. I saw afterwards some photos the Germans had taken of the gun as they said they found it when they went on board. These photos showed the gun with the breech open, thus proving, so the Germans said, that the Japanese had been preparing to use the gun. In reality, of course, it proved nothing of the sort; it is more than likely that the Germans opened the breech themselves before they took this photograph, as they had to produce some evidence to justify their firing on the _Hitachi_. But whether the Japanese opened the gun breech and prepared to use the gun or not, it is quite certain that the _Hitachi_ never fired a shot at the _Wolf_, though the Germans have since asserted that she did so. It was indeed very lucky for us that she did not fire--had she done so and even missed the _Wolf_, it is quite certain the _Wolf_ would have torpedoed the _Hitachi_ and sent us to the bottom.  It was very hot in the 'tween decks, although a ventilating fan was at work there, and after our meal we were all allowed to go on deck for some fresh air. About eight o'clock, however, the single men of military age were again sent below for the night, while the married couples and a few sick and elderly men were allowed to remain on deck, which armed guards patrolled all night. It was a cool moonlight night. We had nothing but what we stood up in, so we lay down in chairs as we were, and that night slept--or rather did not sleep--under one of the _Wolf's_ guns. Throughout the night we were steaming gently, and from time to time we saw the _Hitachi_ still afloat, and steaming along at a considerable distance from us. During the night, one of the passengers gifted with a highly cultivated imagination--who had previously related harrowing details of his escape from a shell which he said had smashed his and my cabin immediately after we left them, but which were afterwards found to be quite intact--told me he had seen the _Hitachi_ go down at 2.30 in the morning. So she evidently must have come up again, for she was still in sight just before daybreak! Soon after daybreak next morning, the men were allowed to go aft under the poop for a wash, with a very limited supply of water, and the ladies had a portion of the 'tween decks to themselves for a short time. Breakfast, consisting of black bread, canned meat, and tea, was then brought to us on deck by the German sailors, and we were left to ourselves on the well deck for some time. The Commander sent down a message conveying his compliments to the ladies, saying he hoped they had had a good night and were none the worse for their experiences. He assured us all that we should be in no danger on his ship and that he would do what he could to make us as comfortable as possible under the circumstances. But, we were reminded again, this is war. Indeed it was, and we had good reason to know it now, even if the war had not touched us closely before.  How vividly every detail of this scene stands out in our memories! The brilliant tropical sunshine, the calm blue sea, the ship crowded in every part, the activity everywhere evident, and--we were prisoners! The old familiar petition of the Litany, \"to shew Thy pity upon all prisoners and captives,\" had suddenly acquired for us a fuller meaning and a new significance. What would the friends we had left behind, our people at home, be thinking--if they only knew! But they were in blissful ignorance of our fate--communication of any kind with the world outside the little one of the _Wolf_ was quite impossible.  There seemed to be literally hundreds of prisoners on and under the poop, and the whole ship, as far as we could see, presented a scene of the greatest activity. Smiths were at work on the well deck, with deafening din hammering and cutting steel plates with which to repair the _Hitachi_; mechanics were working at the seaplane, called the _WÃ¶lfchen_, which was kept on the well deck between her flights; prisoners were exercising on the poop, and the armed guards were patrolling constantly among them and near us on the well deck. The guards wore revolvers and side-arms, but did not appear at all particular in the matter of uniform. Names of various ships appeared on their caps, while some had on their caps only the words \"Kaiserliche Marine.\" Some were barefoot, some wore singlets and shorts, while some even dispensed with the former. Most of the crew at work wore only shorts, and, as one of the lady prisoners remarked, the ship presented a rather unusual exhibition of the European male torso! There seemed to have been a lavish distribution of the Iron Cross among the ship's company. Every officer we saw and many of the crew as well wore the ribbon of the coveted decoration.  Some German officers came aft to interrogate us; they were all courteous and sympathetic, and I took the opportunity of mentioning to the young Lieutenant the loss of my wife's jewels in the lifeboat, and he assured me he would have the boat searched, and if the jewels were found they should be restored.  The Japanese dhobi had died from wounds during the night, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16690"],["title","Five Months on a German Raider (#3)"],["body","was buried in the morning; nearly all the German officers, from the Commander downwards, attending in full uniform. The Japanese Captain and officers also attended, and some kind of funeral service in Japanese was held.  Officers and men were very busy on the upper deck--we were much impressed by the great number of men on board--and we noticed a lady prisoner, a little girl--evidently a great pet with the German sailors and officers--some civilian prisoners, and some military prisoners in khaki on the upper deck, but we were not allowed to communicate with them. There were also a few Tommies in khaki among the prisoners aft. It was very hot on the well deck, and for some hours we had no shelter from the blazing sun. Later on, a small awning was rigged up and we got a little protection, and one or two parasols were forthcoming for the use of the ladies. A small wild pig, presumably taken from some Pacific island when the _Wolf_ had sent a boat ashore, was wandering around the well deck, a few dachshunds were wriggling along the upper deck, and a dozen or so pigeons had their home on the boat deck. During the morning the sailors were allowed to bring us cooling drinks from time to time in one or two glass jugs (which the Asiatics and Portuguese always made a grab at first), and both officers and men did all they could to render our position as bearable as possible. The men amongst us were also allowed to go to the ship's canteen and buy smokes. We were steaming gently in a westerly direction all day, occasionally passing quite close to some small islands and banks of sand, a quite picturesque scene. The sea was beautifully calm and blue, and on the shores of these banks, to which we sailed quite close, the water took on colours of exquisite hues of the palest and tenderest blue and green, as it rippled gently over coral and golden sands.  Tiffin, consisting of rice, and bacon and beans, was dealt out to us on deck at midday, and the afternoon passed in the same way as the morning. The _Wolf's_ chief officer, a hearty, elderly man, came aft to speak to us. He chaffed us about our oarsmanship in the lifeboats, saying the appearance of our oars wildly waving reminded him of the sails of a windmill. \"Never use your wireless or your gun,\" he said, \"and you'll come to no harm from a German raider.\"  The long hot day seemed endless, but by about five o'clock the two ships arrived in an atoll, consisting of about fifteen small islands, and the _Hitachi_ there dropped anchor. The _Wolf_ moved up alongside, and the two ships were lashed together. Supper, consisting of tinned fruit and rice, was served out at 5.30, and we were then told that the married couples and one or two elderly men were to return to the _Hitachi_ that night. So with some difficulty we clambered from the upper deck of the _Wolf_ to the boat deck of the _Hitachi_ and returned to find our cabins just as we had left them in a great hurry the day before. We had not expected to go on board the _Hitachi_ again, and never thought we should renew acquaintance with our personal belongings. We ourselves were particularly sad about this, as we had brought away from Siam, after twenty years' residence there, many things which would be quite irreplaceable. We were therefore very glad to know they were not all lost to us. But we congratulated ourselves that the greater part of our treasures gathered there had been left behind safely stored in the Bank and in a go-down in Bangkok.     CHAPTER III  BACK TO THE \"HITACHI MARU\"   The _Hitachi_ was now a German ship, the Prize Captain was in command, and German sailors replaced the Japanese, who had all been transferred to the _Wolf_. The German Captain spoke excellent English, and expressed a wish to do all he could to make us as comfortable on board as we had been before. He also told us to report at once to him if anything were missing from our cabins. (He informed us later that he had lived some years in Richmond--he evidently knew the neighbourhood quite well--and that he had been a member of the Richmond Tennis Club!) There was of course considerable confusion on board; the deck was in a state of dirt and chaos, littered with books and chairs, and some parts of it were an inch or two deep in water, and we found next morning that the bathrooms and lavatories were not in working order, as the pipes supplying these places had been shot away when the ship was shelled. This state of affairs prevailed for the next few days, and the men passengers themselves had to do what was necessary in these quarters and haul sea-water aboard. The next morning the transference of coal, cargo, and ship's stores from the _Hitachi_ to the _Wolf_ began, and went on without cessation day and night for the next five days. One of the German officers came over and took photos of the passengers in groups, and others frequently took snapshots of various incidents and of each other on different parts of the ship.  We know now that we were then anchored _in a British possession_, one of the southernmost groups of the Maldive Islands! Some of the islands were inhabited, and small sailing boats came out to the _Wolf_, presumably with provisions of some kind. We were, of course, not allowed to speak to any of the islanders, who came alongside the _Wolf_, and were not allowed alongside the _Hitachi_. On one occasion even, the doctor of the _Wolf_ went in the ship's motor launch to one of the islands to attend the wife of one of the native chiefs! On the next day--the 28th--all the _Hitachi_ passengers returned on board her, and at the same time some of the Japanese stewards returned, but they showed no inclination to work as formerly. Indeed, the German officers had no little difficulty in dealing with them. They naturally felt very sore at the deaths of so many of their countrymen at the hands of the Germans, and they did as little work as possible. The stewards were said to be now paid by the Germans, but as they were no longer under the command of their own countrymen, they certainly did not put themselves out to please their new masters.  With their usual thoroughness, the Germans one day examined all our passports and took notes of our names, ages, professions, maiden names of married ladies, addresses, and various other details. My passport described me as \"Principal of Training College for Teachers.\" So I was forthwith dubbed \"Professor\" by the Germans, and from this time henceforth my wife and I were called Frau Professor and Herr Professor, and this certainly led the sailors to treat us with more respect than they might otherwise have done. One young man, who had on his passport his photo taken in military uniform, was, however, detained on the _Wolf_ as a military prisoner. He was asked by a German officer if he were going home to fight. He replied that he certainly was, and pluckily added, \"I wish I were fighting now.\"  On October 1st the married prisoners from the _Wolf_, together with three Australian civilian prisoners over military age, a Colonel of the Australian A.M.C., a Major of the same corps, and his wife, with an Australian stewardess, some young boys, and a few old sea captains and mates, were sent on board the _Hitachi_. They had all been taken off earlier prizes captured and sunk by the _Wolf_. The Australians had been captured on August 6th from the s.s.[2] _Matunga_ from Sydney to what was formerly German New Guinea, from which latter place they had been only a few hours distant. An American captain, with his wife and little girl, had been captured on the barque _Beluga_, from San Francisco to Newcastle, N.S.W., on July 9th. All the passengers transferred were given cabins on board the _Hitachi_. We learnt from these passengers that the _Wolf_ was primarily a mine-layer, and that she had laid mines at Cape Town, Bombay, Colombo, and off the Australian and New Zealand coasts. She had sown her last crop of mines, 110 in number, off the approaches to Singapore before she proceeded to the Indian Ocean to lie in wait for the _Hitachi_. Altogether she had sown five hundred mines.  During her stay in the Maldives the _Wolf_ sent up her seaplane--or, as the Germans said, \"the bird\"--every morning about six, and she returned about eight. To all appearances the coast was clear, and the _Wolf_ consequently anticipated no interference or unwelcome attention from any of our cruisers. Two of them, the _Venus_ and the _Doris_, we had seen at anchor in Colombo harbour during our stay there, but it was apparently thought not worth while to send any escort with the _Hitachi_, though the value of her cargo was said to run into millions sterling; and evidently the convoy system had not yet been adopted in Eastern waters. A Japanese cruiser was also in Colombo harbour when we arrived there, preceded by mine-sweepers, on September 24th. The _Hitachi_ Captain and senior officers visited her before she sailed away on the 25th. The Germans on the _Wolf_ told us that they heard her wireless call when later on she struck one of their mines off Singapore, but the Japanese authorities have since denied that one of their cruisers struck a mine there.  The _Wolf_ remained alongside us till the morning of October 3rd, when she sailed away at daybreak, leaving us anchored in the centre of the atoll. It was a great relief to us when she departed; she kept all the breeze off our side of the ship, so that the heat in our cabin was stifling, and it was in addition very dark; the noise of coaling and shifting cargo was incessant, and the roaring of the water between the two ships most disturbing. Before she sailed away the Prize Captain handed to my wife most of her jewels which had been recovered from the bottom of our lifeboat. As many of these were Siamese jewellery and unobtainable now, we were very rejoiced to obtain possession of them again, but many rings were missing and were never recovered.  The falls of the lifeboats were all renewed, and on"]]]
