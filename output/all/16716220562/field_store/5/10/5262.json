There were three of us--Kate, and Susan, and Jem--                 And three of them--     I don't know _their_ names, for they couldn't speak,     Except with a little imperative squeak,                 Exactly like Poll,                 Susan's squeaking doll;     But squeaking dolls will lie on the shelves     For years and never squeak of themselves:     The reason we like little birds so much better than toys     Is because they are _really_ alive, and know how to make a noise.      There were three of us, and three of them;     Kate,--that is I,--and Susan, and Jem.                 Our mother was busy making a pie,                 And theirs, we think, was up in the sky;     But for all Susan, Jemmy, or I can tell,     She may have been getting their dinner as well.               They were left to themselves (and so were we)               In a nest in the hedge by the willow tree;     And when we caught sight of three red little fluff-tufted, hazel-eyed,              open-mouthed, pink-throated heads, we all shouted for glee.      The way we really did wrong was this:               We took them for Mother to kiss,               And she told us to put them back;     Whilst out on the weeping-willow _their_ mother was crying \"Alack!\"               We really heard     Both what Mother told us to do, and the voice of the mother-bird.               But we three--that is Susan and I and Jem--               Thought we knew better than either of them:     And in spite of our mother's command and the poor bird's cry,     We determined to bring up her three little nestlings ourselves              on the sly.                We each took one,               It did seem such excellent fun!               Susan fed hers on milk and bread,               Jem got wriggling worms for his instead.                   I gave mine meat,     For, you know, I thought, \"Poor darling pet! why shouldn't it have              roast beef to eat?\"     But, oh dear! oh dear! oh dear! how we cried     When in spite of milk and bread and worms and roast beef, the              little birds died!               It's a terrible thing to have heart-ache,               I thought mine would break               As I heard the mother-bird's moan,     And looked at the grey-green, moss-coated, feather-lined nest she had              taken such pains to make,     And her three little children dead, and as cold as stone.               Mother said, and it's sadly true,               \"There are some wrong things one can never undo.\"               And nothing that we could do or say               Would bring life back to the birds that day.      The bitterest tears that we could weep     Wouldn't wake them out of their stiff cold sleep.                               But then,     We--Susan and Jem and I--mean never to be so selfish, and wilful,              and cruel again.     And we three have buried those other three     In a soft, green, moss-covered, flower-lined grave at the foot of              the willow tree.               And all the leaves which its branches shed               We think are tears because they are dead.         DOLLY'S LULLABY.      A NURSERY RHYME       Hush-a-by, Baby! _Your_ baby, Mamma,     No one but pussy may go where you are;     Soft-footed pussy alone may pass by,     For, if he wakens, your baby will cry.      Hush-a-by, Dolly! My baby are you,     Yellow-haired Dolly, with eyes of bright blue;     Though I say \"Hush!\" because Mother does so,     You wouldn't cry like her baby, I know!      Hush-a-by, Baby! Mamma walks about,     Sings to you softly, or rocks you without;     If you slept sounder, then I might walk too,     Sing to my Dolly, and rock her like you!      Hush-a-by Dolly! Sleep sweetly, my pet!     Dear Mamma made you this fine berceaunette,     Muslin and rose-colour, ribbon and lace;     When had a baby a cosier place?      Hush-a-by, Baby! the baby who cries.     Why, dear Mamma, don't you shut baby's eyes?     Pull down his wire, as I do, you see;     Lay him by Dolly, and come out with me.      Hush-a-by, Dolly! Mamma will not speak;     You, my dear baby, would sleep for a week.     Poor Mamma's baby allows her no rest,     Hush-a-by, Dolly, of babies the best!         [Illustration]      A HERO TO HIS HOBBY-HORSE.       Hear me now, my hobby-horse, my steed of prancing paces!     Time is it that you and I won something more than races.     I have got a fine cocked hat, with feathers proudly waving;     Out into the world we'll go, both death and danger braving.      Doubt not that I know the way--the garden-gate is clapping:     Who forgot to lock it last deserves his fingers slapping.     When they find we can't be found, oh won't there be a chorus!     You and I may laugh at that, with all the world before us.      All the world, the great green world that lies beyond the paling!     All the sea, the great round sea where ducks and drakes are sailing!     I a knight, my charger thou, together we will wander     Out into that grassy waste where dwells the Goosey Gander.      Months ago, my faithful steed, that Goose attacked your master;     How it hissed, and how I cried! It ran, but I ran faster!     Down upon my face I fell, its awful wings were o'er me,     Mother came and picked me up, and off to bed she bore me.      Months have passed, my faithful steed, both you and I are older,     Sheathless is my wooden sword, my heart I think is bolder.     Always ready bridled thou, with reins of crimson leather;     Woe betide the Goose to-day who meets us both together!      Up then now, my hobby-horse, my steed of prancing paces!     Time it is that you and I won something more than races.     I a knight, my charger thou, together we will wander     Out into that grassy waste where dwells the Goosey Gander.         THE DOLLS' WASH.       Sally is the laundress, and every Saturday     She sends our clean clothes up from the wash, and Nurse puts them away.     Sometimes Sally is very kind, but sometimes she's as cross as a Turk;     When she's good-humoured we like to go and watch her at work.     She has tubs and a copper in the wash-house, and a great big fire and              plenty of soap;     And outside is the drying-ground with tall posts, and pegs bought from              the gipsies, and long lines of rope.     The laundry is indoors with another big fire, and long tables, and a              lot of irons, and a crimping-machine;     And horses (not live ones with tails, but clothes-horses) and the same              starch that is used by the Queen.     Sally wears pattens in the wash-house, and turns up her sleeves, and              splashes, and rubs,     And makes beautiful white lather which foams over the tops of the tubs,     Like waves at the seaside dashing against the rocks, only not so              strong.     If I were Sally I should sit and blow soap-bubbles all the day long.     Sally is angry sometimes because of the way we dirty our frocks,     Making mud pies, and rolling down the lawn, and climbing trees, and              scrambling over the rocks.     She says we do it on purpose, and never try to take care;     But if things have got to go to the wash, what can it matter how              dirty they are?     Last week Mary and I got a lot of kingcups from the bog, and I              carried them home in my skirt;     It was the end of the week, and our frocks were done, so we didn't              mind about the dirt.     But Sally was as cross as two sticks, and won't wash our dolls'              clothes any more--so she said,--     But never mind, for we'll ask Mamma if we may have a real Dolls'              Wash of our own instead.         *       *       *       *       *      Mamma says we may on one condition, to which we agree;     We're to _really_ wash the dolls' clothes, and make them just              what clean clothes should be.     She says we must wash them thoroughly, which of course we intend to do,     We mean to rub, wring, dry, mangle, starch, iron, and air them too.     A regular wash must be splendid fun, and everybody knows     That any one in the world can wash out a few dirty clothes.         *       *       *       *       *      Well, we've had the Dolls' Wash, but it's only pretty good fun.     We're glad we've had it, you know, but we're gladder still that              it's done.     As we wanted to have as big a wash as we could, we collected              everything we could muster,     From the dolls' bed dimity hangings to Victoria's dress, which I'd              used as a duster.     It was going to the wash, and Mary and I were house-maids--fancy              house-maids, I mean--     And I took it to dust the bookshelf, for I knew it would come back              clean.     Well, we washed in the wash-hand-basin, which holds a good deal, as              the things are small;     We made a glorious lather, and splashed half over the floor; but the              clothes weren't white after all.     However, we hung them out in our drying-ground in the garden, which              we made with dahlia-sticks and long strings,     And then Dash went and knocked over one of the posts, and down in the              dirt went our things!     So we washed them again and hung them on the towel-horse, and most of              them came all right,     But Victoria's muslin dress--though I rinsed it again and again--will              never dry white!     And the grease-spots on Mary's doll's dress don't seem to come out, and              we can't think how they got there;     Unless it was when we made that Macassar-oil, because she has              real hair.     I knew mine was going to the wash, but I'm sorry I used it as a duster              before it "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16686"],["title","Verses for Children, and Songs for Music (#3)"],["body","went;     We think dirty clothes perhaps shouldn't be _too_ dirty before they              are sent.     We had sad work in trying to make the starch--I wonder what the Queen              does with hers?     I stirred mine up with a candle, like Sally, but it only made it worse;     So we had to ask Mamma's leave to have ours made by Nurse.     Nurse makes beautiful starch--like water-arrowroot when you're ill--in              a minute or two.     It's a very odd thing that what looks so easy should be so difficult              to do!     Then Mary put the iron down to heat, but as soon as she'd turned              her back,     A jet of gas came sputtering out of the coals and smoked it black.     We dared not ask Sally for another, for we knew she'd refuse it,     So we had to clean this one with sand and brown-paper before we              could use it.     It was very hard work, but I rubbed till I made it shine;     Yet as soon as it got on a damped \"fine thing\" it left a brown line.     I rubbed it for a long, long time before it would iron without a mark,     But it did at last, and we finished our Dolls' Wash just before dark.         *       *       *       *       *      Sally's very kind, for she praised our wash, and she has taken away     Victoria's dress to do it again; and I really must say     She was right when she said, \"You see, young ladies, a week's wash              isn't all play.\"     Our backs ache, our faces are red, our hands are all wrinkled, and              we've rubbed our fingers quite sore;     We feel very sorry for Sally every week, and we don't mean to dirty              our dresses so much any more.         [Illustration]      HOUSE-BUILDING AND REPAIRS.       Father is building a new house, but I've had one given to me for              my own;     Brick red, with a white window, and black where it ought to be glass,              and the chimney yellow, like stone.     Brother Bill made me the shelves with his tool-box, and the table I              had before, and the pestle-and-mortar;     And Mother gave me the jam-pot when it was empty; it's rather big, but              it's the only pot we have that will really hold water.     We--that is I and Jemima, my doll. (For it's a Doll's House, you know,     Though some of the things are real, like the nutmeg-grater, but not              the wooden plates that stand in a row.     _They_ came out of a box of toy tea-things, and I can't think what              became of the others;     But one never can tell what becomes of anything when one has brothers.)     Jemima is much smaller than I am, and, being made of wood, she is thin;     She takes up too much room inside, but she can lie outside on the roof              without breaking it in.     I wish I had a drawing-room to put her in when I want to really cook;     I have to have the kitchen-table outside as it is, and the              pestle-and-mortar is rather too heavy for it, and everybody              can look.     There's no front door to the house, because there's no front to have a              door in, and beside,     If there were, I couldn't play with anything, for I shouldn't know how              to get inside.     I never heard of a house with only one room, except the cobbler's, and              his was a stall.     I don't quite know what that is; but it isn't a house, and it served              him for parlour and kitchen and all.     Father says that whilst he is about it, he thinks he shall add on              a wing;     And brother Bill says he'll nail my Doll's House on the top of an              old tea-chest, which will come to the same thing.         *       *       *       *       *      Father's house is not finished, though the wing is; for now the              builder says it will be all wrong if there isn't another              to match;     And my house isn't done either, though it's nailed on, for Bill took              off the roof to make a new one of thatch.     The paint is very much scratched, but he says that's nothing, for it              must have had a new coat;     And he means to paint it for me, inside and out, when he paints              his own boat.     There's a sad hole in the floor, but Bill says the wood is as rotten              as rotten can be:     Which was why he made such a mess of the side with trying to put real              glass in the window, through which one can see.     Bill says he believes that the shortest plan would be to make a new              Doll's House with proper rooms, in the regular way;     Which was what the builder said to Father when he wanted to build in              the old front; and to-day     I heard him tell him the old materials were no good to use and weren't              worth the expense of carting away.     I don't know when I shall be able to play at dolls again, for all the              things are put away in a box;     Except Jemima and the pestle-and-mortar, and they're in the bottom              drawer with my Sunday frocks.     I almost wish I had kept the house as it was before;     We managed very well with a painted window and without a front door.     I don't know what Father means to do with his house, but if ever              mine is finished, I'll never have it altered any more.         THE BLUE-BELLS ON THE LEA.      FAIRY KING.       \"The breeze is on the Blue-bells,       The wind is on the lea;     Stay out! stay out! my little lad,       And chase the wind with me.     If you will give yourself to me,       Within the fairy ring,         At deep midnight,         When stars are bright,       You'll hear the Blue-bells ring--                    D!

I pray you ring to me.     I only did as Mother bade,       For tea I did not care,           And winds at night           Give more delight       Than all this noonday glare.\"                    D!                 DI! DIN!                  DING!     No sound of bells was there.       BOY.      \"The snow lies o'er the Blue-bells,       A storm is on the lea;     Our hearth is warm, the fire burns bright,       The flames dance merrily.     Oh, Mother dear! I would no more       That on that summer's day,         Within the ring,         The Fairy King       Had stolen me away--                    D!                 DI! DIN!                  DING!     To where the Blue-bells play.      \"Yet when the storm is loudest,       At deep midnight I dream,     And up and down upon the lea       To chase the wind I seem;     While by my side, in feathered cap,       There runs the Fairy King,         And down below,         Beneath the snow,       We hear the Blue-bells ring--                    D!                 DI! DIN!                  DING!     Such happy dreams they bring!\"         AN ONLY CHILD'S TEA-PARTY.       When I go to tea with the little Smiths, there are eight of them              there, but there's only one of me,     Which makes it not so easy to have a fancy tea-party as if there were              two or three.     I had a tea-party on my birthday, but Joe Smith says it can't have              been a regular one,     Because as to a tea-party with only one teacup and no teapot,              sugar-basin, cream-jug, or slop-basin, he never heard of such              a thing under the sun.     But it was a very big teacup, and quite full of milk and water, and,              you see,     There wasn't anybody there who could really drink milk and water except              Towser and me.     The dolls can only pretend, and then it washes the paint off              their lips,     And what Charles the canary drinks isn't worth speaking of, for he              takes such very small sips.     Joe says a kitchen-chair isn't a table; but it has got four legs and              a top, so it would be if the back wasn't there;     And that does for Charles to perch on, and I have to put the Prince              of Wales to lean against it, because his legs have no joints              to sit on a chair.      [Illustration]      That's the small doll. I call him the Prince of Wales because he's              the eldest son, you see;     For I'"]]]
