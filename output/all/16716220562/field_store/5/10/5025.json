In your curiosity I fully participate, but, I'm sorry to say, I can't gratify it. It is one of those things that I could never find out.  Three mattresses, thick and well wadded, spread on the disc forming the false bottom of the Projectile, were arranged in lines whose parallelism was simply perfect. But Ardan would never think of occupying his until the very last moment. Walking up and down, with the restless nervousness of a wild beast in a cage, he kept up a continuous fire of talk; at one moment with his friends, at another with the dogs, addressing the latter by the euphonious and suggestive names of Diana and Satellite.  [Illustration: DIANA AND SATELLITE.]  \"Ho, pets!\" he would exclaim as he patted them gently, \"you must not forget the noble part you are to play up there. You must be models of canine deportment. The eyes of the whole Selenitic world will be upon you. You are the standard bearers of your race. From you they will receive their first impression regarding its merits. Let it be a favorable one. Compel those Selenites to acknowledge, in spite of themselves, that the terrestrial race of canines is far superior to that of the very best Moon dog among them!\"  \"Dogs in the Moon!\" sneered M'Nicholl, \"I like that!\"  \"Plenty of dogs!\" cried Ardan, \"and horses too, and cows, and sheep, and no end of chickens!\"  \"A hundred dollars to one there isn't a single chicken within the whole Lunar realm, not excluding even the invisible side!\" cried the Captain, in an authoritative tone, but never taking his eye off the chronometer.  \"I take that bet, my son,\" coolly replied Ardan, shaking the Captain's hand by way of ratifying the wager; \"and this reminds me, by the way, Mac, that you have lost three bets already, to the pretty little tune of six thousand dollars.\"  \"And paid them, too!\" cried the captain, monotonously; \"ten, thirty-six, six!\"  \"Yes, and in a quarter of an hour you will have to pay nine thousand dollars more; four thousand because the Columbiad will not burst, and five thousand because the Projectile will rise more than six miles from the Earth.\"  \"I have the money ready,\" answered the Captain, touching his breeches pocket. \"When I lose I pay. Not sooner. Ten, thirty-eight, ten!\"  \"Captain, you're a man of method, if there ever was one. I think, however, that you made a mistake in your wagers.\"  \"How so?\" asked the Captain listlessly, his eye still on the dial.  \"Because, by Jove, if you win there will be no more of you left to take the money than there will be of Barbican to pay it!\"  \"Friend Ardan,\" quietly observed Barbican, \"my stakes are deposited in the _Wall Street Bank_, of New York, with orders to pay them over to the Captain's heirs, in case the Captain himself should fail to put in an appearance at the proper time.\"  \"Oh! you rhinoceroses, you pachyderms, you granite men!\" cried Ardan, gasping with surprise; \"you machines with iron heads, and iron hearts! I may admire you, but I'm blessed if I understand you!\"  \"Ten, forty-two, ten!\" repeated M'Nicholl, as mechanically as if it was the chronometer itself that spoke.  \"Four minutes and a half more,\" said Barbican.  \"Oh! four and a half little minutes!\" went on Ardan. \"Only think of it! We are shut up in a bullet that lies in the chamber of a cannon nine hundred feet long. Underneath this bullet is piled a charge of 400 thousand pounds of gun-cotton, equivalent to 1600 thousand pounds of ordinary gunpowder! And at this very instant our friend Murphy, chronometer in hand, eye on dial, finger on discharger, is counting the last seconds and getting ready to launch us into the limitless regions of planetary--\"  \"Ardan, dear friend,\" interrupted Barbican, in a grave tone, \"a serious moment is now at hand. Let us meet it with some interior recollection. Give me your hands, my dear friends.\"  \"Certainly,\" said Ardan, with tears in his voice, and already at the other extreme of his apparent levity.  The three brave men united in one last, silent, but warm and impulsively affectionate pressure.  \"And now, great God, our Creator, protect us! In Thee we trust!\" prayed Barbican, the others joining him with folded hands and bowed heads.  \"Ten, forty-six!\" whispered the Captain, as he and Ardan quietly took their places on the mattresses.  Only forty seconds more!  Barbican rapidly extinguishes the gas and lies down beside his companions.  The deathlike silence now reigning in the Projectile is interrupted only by the sharp ticking of the chronometer as it beats the seconds.  Suddenly, a dreadful shock is felt, and the Projectile, shot up by the instantaneous development of 200,000 millions of cubic feet of gas, is flying into space with inconceivable rapidity!     CHAPTER II.  THE FIRST HALF HOUR.   What had taken place within the Projectile? What effect had been produced by the frightful concussion? Had Barbican's ingenuity been attended with a fortunate result? Had the shock been sufficiently deadened by the springs, the buffers, the water layers, and the partitions so readily ruptured? Had their combined effect succeeded in counteracting the tremendous violence of a velocity of 12,000 yards a second, actually sufficient to carry them from London to New York in six minutes? These, and a hundred other questions of a similar nature were asked that night by the millions who had been watching the explosion from the base of Stony Hill. Themselves they forgot altogether for the moment; they forgot everything in their absorbing anxiety regarding the fate of the daring travellers. Had one among them, our friend Marston, for instance, been favored with a glimpse at the interior of the projectile, what would he have seen?  Nothing at all at first, on account of the darkness; except that the walls had solidly resisted the frightful shock. Not a crack, nor a bend, nor a dent could be perceived; not even the slightest injury had the admirably constructed piece of mechanical workmanship endured. It had not yielded an inch to the enormous pressure, and, far from melting and falling back to earth, as had been so seriously apprehended, in showers of blazing aluminium, it was still as strong in every respect as it had been on the very day that it left the Cold Spring Iron Works, glittering like a silver dollar.  Of real damage there was actually none, and even the disorder into which things had been thrown in the interior by the violent shock was comparatively slight. A few small objects lying around loose had been furiously hurled against the ceiling, but the others appeared not to have suffered the slightest injury. The straps that fastened them up were unfrayed, and the fixtures that held them down were uncracked.  The partitions beneath the disc having been ruptured, and the water having escaped, the false floor had been dashed with tremendous violence against the bottom of the Projectile, and on this disc at this moment three human bodies could be seen lying perfectly still and motionless.  Were they three corpses? Had the Projectile suddenly become a great metallic coffin bearing its ghastly contents through the air with the rapidity of a lightning flash?  In a very few minutes after the shock, one of the bodies stirred a little, the arms moved, the eyes opened, the head rose and tried to look around; finally, with some difficulty, the body managed to get on its knees. It was the Frenchman! He held his head tightly squeezed between his hands for some time as if to keep it from splitting. Then he felt himself rapidly all over, cleared his throat with a vigorous \"hem!\" listened to the sound critically for an instant, and then said to himself in a relieved tone, but in his native tongue:  \"One man all right! Call the roll for the others!\"  He tried to rise, but the effort was too great for his strength. He fell back again, his brain swimming, his eyes bursting, his head splitting. His state very much resembled that of a young man waking up in the morning after his first tremendous \"spree.\"  \"Br--rr!\" he muttered to himself, still talking French; \"this reminds me of one of my wild nights long ago in the _Quartier Latin_, only decidedly more so!\"  Lying quietly on his back for a while, he could soon feel that the circulation of his blood, so suddenly and violently arrested by the terrific shock, was gradually recovering its regular flow; his heart grew more normal in its action; his head became clearer, and the pain less distracting.  \"Time to call that roll,\" he at last exclaimed in a voice with some pretensions to firmness; \"Barbican! MacNicholl!\"  He listens anxiously for a reply. None comes. A snow-wrapt grave at midnight is not more silent. In vain does he try to catch even the faintest sound of breathing, though he listens intently enough to hear the beating of their hearts; but he hears only his own.  \"Call that roll again!\" he mutters in a voice far less assured than before; \"Barbican! MacNicholl!\"  The same fearful unearthly stillness.  \"The thing is getting decidedly monotonous!\" he exclaimed, still speaking French. Then rapidly recovering his consciousness as the full horror of the situation began to break on his mind, he went on muttering audibly: \"Have they really hopped the twig? Bah! Fudge! what has not been able to knock the life out of one little Frenchman can't have killed two Americans! They're all right! But first and foremost, let us enlighten the situation!\"  So saying, he contrived without much difficulty to get on his feet. Balancing himself then for a moment, he began groping about for the gas. But he stopped suddenly.  \"Hold on a minute!\" he cried; \"before lighting this match, let us see if the gas has been escaping. Setting fire to a mixture of air and hydrogen would make a pretty how-do-you-do! Such an explosion would infallibly burst the Projectile, which so"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16457"],["title","All Around the Moon (#3)"],["body"," seems all right, though I'm blest if I can tell whether we're moving or not.\"  He began sniffing and smelling to discover if possible the odor of escaped gas. He could not detect the slightest sign of anything of the kind. This gave him great courage. He knew of course that his senses were not yet in good order, still he thought he might trust them so far as to be certain that the gas had not escaped and that consequently all the other receptacles were uninjured.  At the touch of the match, the gas burst into light and burned with a steady flame. Ardan immediately bent anxiously over the prostrate bodies of his friends. They lay on each other like inert masses, M'Nicholl stretched across Barbican.  Ardan first lifted up the Captain, laid him on the sofa, opened his clenched hands, rubbed them, and slapped the palms vigorously. Then he went all over the body carefully, kneading it, rubbing it, and gently patting it. In such intelligent efforts to restore suspended circulation, he seemed perfectly at home, and after a few minutes his patience was rewarded by seeing the Captain's pallid face gradually recover its natural color, and by feeling his heart gradually beat with a firm pulsation.  At last M'Nicholl opened his eyes, stared at Ardan for an instant, pressed his hand, looked around searchingly and anxiously, and at last whispered in a faint voice:  \"How's Barbican?\"  \"Barbican is all right, Captain,\" answered Ardan quietly, but still speaking French. \"I'll attend to him in a jiffy. He had to wait for his turn. I began with you because you were the top man. We'll see in a minute what we can do for dear old Barby (_ce cher Barbican_)!\"  In less than thirty seconds more, the Captain not only was able to sit up himself, but he even insisted on helping Ardan to lift Barbican, and deposit him gently on the sofa.  [Illustration: HELPED ARDAN TO LIFT BARBICAN.]  The poor President had evidently suffered more from the concussion than either of his companions. As they took off his coat they were at first terribly shocked at the sight of a great patch of blood staining his shirt bosom, but they were inexpressibly relieved at finding that it proceeded from a slight contusion of the shoulder, little more than skin deep.  Every approved operation that Ardan had performed for the Captain, both now repeated for Barbican, but for a long time with nothing like a favorable result.  Ardan at first tried to encourage the Captain by whispers of a lively and hopeful nature, but not yet understanding why M'Nicholl did not deign to make a single reply, he grew reserved by degrees and at last would not speak a single word. He worked at Barbican, however, just as before.  M'Nicholl interrupted himself every moment to lay his ear on the breast of the unconscious man. At first he had shaken his head quite despondingly, but by degrees he found himself more and more encouraged to persist.  \"He breathes!\" he whispered at last.  \"Yes, he has been breathing for some time,\" replied Ardan, quietly, still unconsciously speaking French. \"A little more rubbing and pulling and pounding will make him as spry as a young grasshopper.\"  They worked at him, in fact, so vigorously, intelligently and perseveringly, that, after what they considered a long hour's labor, they had the delight of seeing the pale face assume a healthy hue, the inert limbs give signs of returning animation, and the breathing become strong and regular.  At last, Barbican suddenly opened his eyes, started into an upright position on the sofa, took his friends by the hands, and, in a voice showing complete consciousness, demanded eagerly:  \"Ardan, M'Nicholl, are we moving?\"  His friends looked at each other, a little amused, but more perplexed. In their anxiety regarding their own and their friend's recovery, they had never thought of asking such a question. His words recalled them at once to a full sense of their situation.  \"Moving? Blessed if I can tell!\" said Ardan, still speaking French.  \"We may be lying fifty feet deep in a Florida marsh, for all I know,\" observed M'Nicholl.  \"Or, likely as not, in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico,\" suggested Ardan, still in French.  \"Suppose we find out,\" observed Barbican, jumping up to try, his voice as clear and his step as firm as ever.  But trying is one thing, and finding out another. Having no means of comparing themselves with external objects, they could not possibly tell whether they were moving, or at an absolute stand-still. Though our Earth is whirling us continually around the Sun at the tremendous speed of 500 miles a minute, its inhabitants are totally unconscious of the slightest motion. It was the same with our travellers. Through their own personal consciousness they could tell absolutely nothing. Were they shooting through space like a meteor? They could not tell. Had they fallen back and buried themselves deep in the sandy soil of Florida, or, still more likely, hundreds of fathoms deep beneath the waters of the Gulf of Mexico? They could not form the slightest idea.  Listening evidently could do no good. The profound silence proved nothing. The padded walls of the Projectile were too thick to admit any sound whether of wind, water, or human beings. Barbican, however, was soon struck forcibly by one circumstance. He felt himself to be very uncomfortably warm, and his friend's faces looked very hot and flushed. Hastily removing the cover that protected the thermometer, he closely inspected it, and in an instant uttered a joyous exclamation.  \"Hurrah!\" he cried. \"We're moving! There's no mistake about it. The thermometer marks 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Such a stifling heat could not come from the gas. It comes from the exterior walls of our projectile, which atmospheric friction must have made almost red hot. But this heat must soon diminish, because we are already far beyond the regions of the atmosphere, so that instead of smothering we shall be shortly in danger of freezing.\"  \"What?\" asked Ardan, much bewildered. \"We are already far beyond the limits of the terrestrial atmosphere! Why do you think so?\"  M'Nicholl was still too much flustered to venture a word.  \"If you want me to answer your question satisfactorily, my dear Ardan,\" replied Barbican, with a quiet smile, \"you will have the kindness to put your questions in English.\"  \"What do you mean, Barbican!\" asked Ardan, hardly believing his ears.  \"Hurrah!\" cried M'Nicholl, in the tone of a man who has suddenly made a welcome but most unexpected discovery.  \"I don't know exactly how it is with the Captain,\" continued Barbican, with the utmost tranquillity, \"but for my part the study of the languages never was my strong point, and though I always admired the French, and even understood it pretty well, I never could converse in it without giving myself more trouble than I always find it convenient to assume.\"  \"You don't mean to say that I have been talking French to you all this time!\" cried Ardan, horror-stricken.  \"The most elegant French I ever heard, backed by the purest Parisian accent,\" replied Barbican, highly amused; \"Don't you think so, Captain?\" he added, turning to M'Nicholl, whose countenance still showed the most comical traces of bewilderment.  \"Well, I swan to man!\" cried the Captain, who always swore a little when his feelings got beyond his control; \"Ardan, the Boss has got the rig on both of us this time, but rough as it is on you it is a darned sight more so on me. Be hanged if I did not think you were talking English the whole time, and I put the whole blame for not understanding you on the disordered state of my brain!\"  Ardan only stared, and scratched his head, but Barbican actually--no, not _laughed_, that serene nature could not _laugh_. His cast-iron features puckered into a smile of the richest drollery, and his eyes twinkled with the wickedest fun; but no undignified giggle escaped the portal of those majestic lips.  \"It _sounds_ like French, I'd say to myself,\" continued the Captain, \"but I _know_ it's English, and by and by, when this whirring goes out of my head, I shall easily understand it.\"  Ardan now looked as if he was beginning to see the joke.  \"The most puzzling part of the thing to me,\" went on M'Nicholl, giving his experience with the utmost gravity, \"was why English sounded so like _French_. If it was simple incomprehensible gibberish, I could readily blame the state of my ears for it. But the idea that my bothered ears could turn a mere confused, muzzled, buzzing reverberation into a sweet, harmonious, articulate, though unintelligible, human language, made me sure that I was fast becoming crazy, if I was not so already.\"  \"Ha! ha! ha!\" roared Ardan, laughing till the tears came. \"Now I understand why the poor Captain made me no reply all the time, and looked at me with such a hapless woe-begone expression of countenance. The fact is, Barbican, that shock was too much both for M'Nicholl and myself. You are the only man among us whose head is fire-proof, blast-proof, and powder-proof. I really believe a burglar would have greater difficulty in blowing your head-piece open than in bursting one of those famous American safes your papers make such a fuss about. A wonderful head, the Boss's, isn't it M'Nicholl?\"  \"Yes,\" said the Captain, as slowly as if every word were a gem of the profoundest thought, \"the Boss has a fearful and a wonderful head!\"  \"But now to business!\" cried the versatile Ardan, \"Why do you think, Barbican, that we are at present beyond the limits of the terrestrial atmosphere?\"  \"For a very simple reason,\" said Barbican, pointing to the chronometer; \"it is now more than seven minutes after 11. We must, therefore, have been in motion more than twenty minutes. Consequently, unless our initial velocity has been very much diminished by the friction, we must have long before this completely cleared the fifty miles of atmosphere enveloping the earth.\"  \"Correct,\" said the Captain, cool as a cucumber, because"]]]
