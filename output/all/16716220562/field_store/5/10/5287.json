THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH IN THE SECOND CENTURY.  Statement of Justin Martyr,                                            499 Great obscurity resting on the subject,                                500 Illustrated by the Epistles of Clement and Polycarp,                   ib. Circumstances which led to the writing of Clement's Epistle,           501 Churches of Corinth and Borne then governed by presbyters,             503 Churches of Smyrna and Philippi governed by presbyters,                504 The presbyters had a chairman or president,                            ib. Traces of this in the apostolic age,                                   505 Early catalogues of bishops--their origin and contradictions,          ib.

Singular that many episcopal lists stop at the end of the second     century,                                                           519 Before that date only one bishop in Egypt,                             520 In some places another system set up earlier,                          521   CHAPTER VI.  THE RISE OF THE HIERARCHY CONNECTED WITH THE SPREAD OF HERESIES.  Eusebius.  The defects of his Ecclesiastical History,                  522 Superior erudition of Jerome,                                          523 His account of the origin of Prelacy,                                  524 Prelacy originated after the apostolic age,                            527 Suggested by the distractions of the Church,                           529 Formidable and vexatious character of the early heresies,              530 Mode of appointing the president of the eldership changed.     Popular election of bishops, how introduced,                       532 The various statements of Jerome consistent,                           533 The primitive moderator and the bishop contrasted,                     535 How the decree relative to a change in the ecclesiastical     constitution adopted throughout the whole world,                   ib.   CHAPTER VII.  PRELACY BEGINS IN ROME.  Comparative length of the lives of the early bishops of Rome,          537 Observations relative to a change in the organization of the     Roman Church in the time of Hyginus,                               538   1. The statement of Hilary will account for the increased average       in the length of episcopal life,                                 539   2. The testimony of Jerome cannot otherwise be explained,            540   3. Hilary indicates that the constitution of the Church was       changed about this period,                                       541   4. At this time such an arrangement must naturally have suggested       itself to the Roman Christians,                                  542   5. The violent death of Telesphorus fitted to prepare the way       for it,                                                          543   6. The influence of Rome would recommend its adoption,               544   7. A vacancy which occurred after the death of Hyginus accords       with this view. Valentine a candidate for the Roman bishopric,   545   8. The letters of Pius to Justus corroborate this view,              547   9. It is sustained by the fact that the word _bishop_ now       began to be applied to the presiding elder,                      550  10. The Pontifical Book remarkably confirms it--Not strange that       history speaks so little of this change,                         552 Little alteration at first apparent in the general aspect of the     Church in consequence of the adoption of the new principle,        554 Facility with which the change could be accomplished,                  565 Polycarp probably dissatisfied with the new arrangements,              556 Change, in all likelihood, not much opposed,                           558 Many presbyters, as well as the people, would be favourable to it,     ib. The new system gradually spread,                                       559   CHAPTER VIII.  THE CATHOLIC SYSTEM.  History of the word Catholic,                                          561 Circumstances in which the system originated,                          ib. The bishop the centre of unity for his district,                       562 Principal or apostolic Churches--their position,                       564 The Church of Rome more potentially principal,                         566 How communion maintained among the Churches,                           567 Early jealousy towards the bishop of Rome,                             568 The Catholic system identified with Rome,                              569 Why the Apostle Peter everywhere so highly exalted,                    570 Roman bishops sought to work out the idea of unity,                    571 Theory of the Catholic system fallacious,                              572 How Rome the antitype of Babylon,                                      573   CHAPTER IX.  PRIMITIVE EPISCOPACY AND PRESBYTERIAN ORDINATION.  Where Christians formed only a single congregation Episcopacy     made little change,                                                575 The bishop the parish minister,                                        ib. Every one who could might preach if the bishops permitted,             576 Bishops thickly planted--all of equal rank--the greatest had very     limited jurisdiction,                                              577 Ecclesiastics often engaged in secular pursuits,                       578 The Alexandrian presbyters made their bishops,                         580 When this practice ceased,                                             581 Alexandrian bishops not originally ordained by imposition of     hands,                                                             582 Roman presbyters and others made their bishops,                        583 The bishop the presiding elder--early Roman bishops so called,         584 Bishops of the order of the presbytery,                                585 All Christian ministers originally ordained by presbyters,             ib. A bishop ordained by a bishop and a presbyter,                         586 Difference between ancient and modern bishops,                         587   CHAPTER X.  THE PROGRESS OF PRELACY.  Power of the president of a court,                                     589 Power of the ecclesiastical president increased when elected by the     people,                                                            590 The superior wealth of the bishop added to his influence,              ib. Appointment of lectors, sub-deacons, acolyths, exorcists,     and janitors,                                                      592 These new offices first appeared in Rome,                              ib. Bishops began to appoint church officers without consulting the     people,                                                            593 New canons relative to ordination,                                     594 Presbyters ceased to inaugurate bishops,                               595 Presbyters continued to ordain presbyters and deacons,                 596 Country bishops deprived of the right to ordain,                       597 Account of their degradation,                                          598 Rise of metropolitans,                                                 599 Circumstances which added to the power of the city bishops,            ib. One bishop in each province at the head of the rest,                   601 Jealousies and contentions of city bishops,                            602 Great change in the Church, in two centuries,                          603 Reasons why the establishment of metropolitans so much opposed,        604   CHAPTER XI.  SYNODS--THEIR HISTORY AND CONSTITUTION.  Apostles sought, first, the conversion of sinners, and then the     edification of their converts,                                     605 No general union of Churches originally,                               606 But intercourse in various ways maintained,                            ib. Synods did not commence about the middle of the second century,        607 A part of the original constitution of the Church,                     ib."]]]
