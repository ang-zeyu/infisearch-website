It is quite an improvement on those first used.  To make it more portable it is in three pieces, a b and c; having a groove e on one side to receive the thermometre tube and scale by which the proper degree of heating the mercury is ascertained.  Into the top are nicely fitted two or three iron frames, with shoulders, for the plate to rest in, suitable for the different sizes of plates.  The bath is heated by means of a spirit lamp placed under it.  From two to four ounces of highly purified mercury are put into the bath at a time.  IV. PLATE BLOCKS AND VICES.--There are several kinds of this article in use; I shall describe the two best only.  [Illustration: Fig. 10 (hipho_10.gif)]  Fig. 10 gives an idea of the improvement on the English hand block. The top a is perfectly flat and smooth--a little smaller than the plate, so as to permit the latter to project a very little all around--having at opposite angles c c two clasps, one fixed the other moveable, but capable of being fastened by the thumb screw d, so as to secure the plate tightly upon the block.  This block turns upon a swivle, b, which is attached to the table by the screw c, This block is only used for holding the plate while undergoing the first operation in cleaning.  [Illustration: Fig. 11 (hipho_11.gif)]  Fig. 11, shows the form of Lewis' newly patented plate vice, which for durability, simplicity and utility is preferable to all others.  It consists of a simple platform and arm of cast iron, the former, a, having a groove, d, in the centre for fixing the different sizes of plate beds, e--and the latter supporting the leaves, e f.  On this vice which is secured to a table, or bench, the plate receives its finishing polish with rouge, or prepared lampblack.  Mr. Lewis gives the following directions for its use.  \"As the cam wears tighten it with the adjusting screw (g) so as to allow the lever (f) to fall back into a horizontal position; the plate being in its place at the time.  Oil the wearing parts occasionally.\"  Some Daguerreotypists, however, use a foot lathe with buff wheels of various forms; but this vice is sufficient for all ordinary purposes.  [Illustration: Fig. 12 (hipho_12.gif)]  [Illustration: Fig. 13 (hipho_13.gif)]  V. COATING BOXES.--The usual form for iodine and bromine boxes is see, at figs. 14 and 15.  They are far superior to those in use with the English operators.  Each consists of a wooden box (a,) having firmly embeded within it a stout glass jar (c), the edges of which are ground. Over this is placed the sliding cover b, double the length of the box, one half occupied by a piece of ground glass (e), tightly pressed upon the glass pot by a spring (i) beneath the cross bar g, and fits the pot so accurately that it effectually prevents the escape of the vapor of the iodine, bromine or other accelerating liquid contained therein. The other half of the lid is cut through, shoulders being left at the four angles for the different sizes of frames, designed to recieve the plate while undergoing the coating process.  When the plate is put into the frame, the cover b is shoved under the second lid h and when coated to the proper degree, it resumes its former position and the plate is placed in the holder of the camera box.  To test the tightness of the box, light a piece of paper, put it into the pot and cover it with the sliding lid.  The burning paper expels the air from the pot, and if it be perfectly tight you may raise the whole box by the lid.  VI. GLASS FUNNELS.--Are a necessary article to the Daguerreotypist, for filtering water, solutions, &c.  [Illustration: Fig. 14 (hipho_14.gif)]  VII. GILDING STAND.--For nervous persons the gilding stand is a useful article.  It is adjusted to a perfect level by thumb screws placed in its base.  VIII. SPIRIT LAMPS.--The most useful and economical of those made are the Britania, as they are less liable to break; and the tube for the wick being fastened to the body by a screw renders it less liable to get out of order or explode.  Glass is the cheapest, and for an amateur will do very well, but for a professed artist the Britania should always be obtained.  IX.  COLOR BOX.--These are generally found on sale at the shops, and usually contain eight colors, four brushes and a gold cup.  The artist would, however, do well to obtain, all the colors mentioned in the last chapter of this work, and be sure to get the very best, as there are various qualities of the same color, particularly carmine, which is very expensive, and the cupidity of some may induce them to sell a poor article for the sake of larger profits.  [Illustration: Fig. 15 (hipho_15.gif)]  STILL.--Daguerreotypists should always use distilled water for solutions, and washing the plate, as common water holds various substances in solution which detract very materially from the excellence of a photograph, and often gives much trouble, quite unaccountable to many.  For the purpose of distilling water the apparatus represented at Fig. 16 is both convenient and economical.  It may be either wholly of good stout tin, or of sheet iron tinned on the inside, and may be used over a common fire, or on a stove.  A is the body, which may be made to hold from one to four gallons of water, which is introduced at the opening b, which is then stopped by a cork. The tube d connects the neck a of the still with the worm tub, or refrigerator B, at e, which is kept filled with cold water by means of the funnel c, and drawn off as fast as it becomes warm by the cock f. The distilled water is condensed in the worm--and passes off at the cock b, under which a bottle, or other vessel, should be placed to receive it.  The different joints are rendered tight by lute, or in its absence, some stiff paste spread upon a piece of linen and wrapped around them will answer very well; an addition of sealing wax over all will make them doubly secure.  [Illustration: Fig. 16 (hipho_16.gif)]  HYGROMETER.--This is an instrument never to be found, I believe, in the rooms of our operators, although it would be of much use to them, for ascertaining the quantity of moisture floating about the room; and as it is necessary to have the atmosphere as dry as possible to prevent an undue absorption of this watery vapor by the iodine &c., and to procure good pictures,--its detection becomes a matter of importance.  Mason's hygrometer, manufactured by Mr. Roach and sold by Mr. Anthony, 205 Broadway, New York is the best in use.  It consists of two thermometre tubes placed, side by side, on a metalic scale, which is graduated equally to both tubes.  The bulb of one of these tubes communicates, by means of a net-work of cotton, with a glass reservoir of water attached to the back of the scale.  Fig. 17 and 18 represent a front and back view of this instrument.  Fig. 17 is the front view, showing the tubes with their respective scales; the bulb b being covered with the network of cotton communicating with the reservoir c fig. 18, at d.  [Illustration: Fig. 17 (hipho_17.gif)]  [Illustration: Fig. 18 (hipho_18.gif)]  The evaporation of the water from this bulb decreases the temperature of the mercury in the tube b in proportion to the dryness of the atmosphere, and the number of degrees the tube b indicates below that of the other, shows the real state of the atmosphere in the room; for instance, if b stands at forty and a at sixty-one the room is in a state of extreme dryness, the difference of twenty-one degrees between the thermometers--let a stand at any one point--gives this result.  If they do not differ, or there is only four or five degrees variation, the atmosphere of the room is very moist and means should be taken to expel the superfluous quantity.  HEAD RESTS.--The button head rest with chair back clip, A fig.  19--is much the best for travelling artists, as it can be taken apart, into several pieces and closely packed; is easily and firmly fixed to the back of a chair by the clamp and screw a and b, and is readily adjusted to the head, as the buttons c, c and arms d, d are movable.  Sometimes the button rest is fixed to a pole, which is screwed to the chair; but this method is not so secure and solid as the clip and occupies more room in packing.  Both the pole and clip, are furnished in some cases with brass band rests instead of the button; but the only recommendation these can possibly possess in the eyes of any artist, is their cheapness.  [Illustration: Fig. 19 (hipho_19.gif)]  For a Daguerreotypist permanently located the independent iron head-rest, B fig. 19, is the most preferable, principally on account of its solidity.  It is entirely of iron, is supported by a tripod (a) of the same metal and can be elevated by means of a rod (b) passing through the body of the tripod, to a height sufficient for a person, standing, to rest against.  [Illustration: Fig. 20 (hipho_20.gif)]  GALVANIC BATTERY.--This article is used for the purpose of giving to imperfectly coated plates a thicker covering of silver.  The form of battery now most universally employed for electrotype, and other galvanic purposes, is Smee's--Fig. 20.  It consists of a piece of platinized silver, A, on the top of which is fixed a beam of wood, B, to prevent contact with the silver.  A binding screw C is soldered on to the silver plate to connect it with any desired object, by means of the copper wire, e.  A plate of amalgamated zinc, D, varying with the fancy of the operator from one half to the entire width of the silver is placed on each side of the wood.  This is set into a glass vessel, P,--the extreme ends of the wood resting upon its edge--on which the acid with which it is charged has no effect.  The jar is charged with sulphuric acid, (common oil of vitriol) diluted in eight parts its bulk of water.  The zinc plates of the battery have been amalgamated with quicksilver, and when the battery is set into the jar of acid there should be no action percieved"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16805"],["title","The Jungle Fugitives: A Tale of Life and Adventure in India (#0)"],["body","JUNGLE FUGITIVES  A Tale of Life and Adventure in India Including also Many Stories of American Adventure, Enterprise and Daring  by  EDWARD S.

All through India, with its fanatical population five times as great as that of England, the rumblings of the coming uprising had been heard for months.  The disaffection had been spreading and taking root.  The emissaries of the arch-plotters had passed back and forth almost from end to end of the vast empire, with their messages of hatred and appeal.  The people were assured that the \"Inglese loge\" were perfecting their insidious schemes for overthrowing their religion, and the faithful everywhere were called upon to crush the infidels in the dust.  The evil seed fell upon the rankest of soil, and grew with a vigor and exuberance that threatened to strangle every other growth.  The plot, as agreed upon, was that a general uprising was to take place throughout India on the last day of May, 1857, but, as is often the case in such far-reaching schemes, the impatience of the mutineers precipitated the tremendous tragedy.  The first serious outbreak took place at Meerut on Sunday, May 10th, just three weeks previous to the time set for the general uprising. That town, with its population of about 40,000 at that time, lies thirty-two miles northeast from Delhi, which was to be the capital of the resurrected Mogul Empire.  It was the precipitancy of this first revolt that prevented its fullest success.  The intention was to kill every white man, woman and child in the place.  Two regiments were clamorous for beginning the massacre, but the Eleventh Native Infantry held back so persistently that the others became enraged and fired a volley among them, killing a number.  Thereupon the Eleventh announced themselves ready to take their part in the slaughter that was to free India from the execrated \"Inglese loge.\"  Seeing now for the first time the real peril, the colonel of the Eleventh made an impassioned appeal to the regiment to stand by its colors and to take no part in the useless revolt.  While he was speaking, a volley riddled his body, and he tumbled lifeless from his saddle.  The Eleventh, however, covered the flight of the other officers, but helped to release a thousand prisoners, suffering punishment for various offenses, and then the hell fire burst forth.  The bungalows of the officers, the mess houses of the troops, and all the buildings between the native lines and Meerut were fired, and the whole became a roaring conflagration, whose glare at night was visible for miles.  When an appeal was made to the Emperor of Delhi by the troopers, he inquired their errand.  The lacklustre eyes flashed with a light that had not been seen in them for years, the bowed form acquired new energy, and he gave orders to admit the troopers.  Their message was enough to fan into life the slumbering fires of ambition in the breast of a dying person.  He yielded to the dazzling dream.  A throne of silver, laid away for years, was brought into the \"hall of special audience,\" and the tottering form was helped to the seat, into which he sank and looked around upon his frenzied followers.  Mohammed Suraj-oo-deen Shah Gezee was now the Great Mogul of India.  A royal salute of twenty-one guns was fired by two troops of artillery from Meerut in front of the palace, and the wild multitudes again strained their throats.  To the thunder of artillery, the strains of martial music and the shouting of the people, the gates of the palace were flung open, and Prince Mirza Mogul, with his brother, Prince Abu Beker, at the head of the royal bodyguard, rode forth, the king following in an open chariot, surrounded by his bodyguard.  With impressive slowness this strange procession made its way through the principal street, the populace becoming as frantic as so many ghost dancers.  Finally a halt was made at the Juma Musjeed, the largest mosque in India, where the banner of the Prophet was unfurled and the Mogul Empire proclaimed.     CHAPTER II.  ON AN AFTERNOON.  Almost due east from Delhi Dr. Hugh Marlowe, a venerable American physician, had lived for more than twenty years.  Since the death of his wife, six years previous to the Mutiny, he had dwelt alone with his only daughter, Mary, and their single servant, Mustad, a devout Mussulman.  A portion of the time mentioned had been passed without the society of his beloved child, who spent several years in New England (where the physician himself was born and had received his education) at one of the fashionable schools.  Shortly after her graduation, Miss Marlowe met Jack Everson, fresh from Yale, and the acquaintance ripened into mutual love, though the filial affection of the young woman was too profound to permit her to form an engagement with the young man until the consent of her father was obtained, and he would not give that consent until he had met and conversed with the young gentleman face to face and taken his measure, as may be said.  \"If he doesn't esteem you enough to make a little journey like the one from America to this country he isn't worth thinking about.\"  \"But he _will_ make the journey,\" said the blushing daughter, patting the bronzed cheek of the parent whom she idolized as much as he idolized her.  \"Don't be to sure of that, my young lady; romantic young girls like you have altogether too much faith in the other sex.\"  \"But he _has_ started,\" she added with a sly smile.  \"He has, eh?  He will change his mind before he reaches here.  How far has he got?\"  \"He was due in England many weeks ago.\"  \"Well, well!  How soon will he arrive _here_?\"  \"I think he is due now.\"  \"Very probably, but his fancy will give out before he reaches this out-of-the-way place.\"  \"I think not, papa.\"  \"Of course not, of course not; I just told you that that is the way with all foolish girls like you.\"  The old gentleman had assumed a stern earnestness, and he added: \"I tell you he will never show himself here!  I know what I'm talking about.\"  \"But he _is_ here, papa; let me introduce you to Jack Everson, a physician like yourself.\"  All this time the smiling young man was standing directly behind the old doctor, who was lazily reclining in a hammock on the shaded lawn, smoking a cheroot, while his daughter sat on a camp stool, with one hand resting on the edge of the hammock, so as to permit her gently to sway it back and forth.  As she spoke the tall, muscular American walked forward and extended his hand.  \"Doctor, I am glad to make your acquaintance,\" he said, in his cheery way.  The astonished physician came to an upright position like the clicking of the blade of a jackknife, and meeting the salutation, exclaimed:  \"Well, I'll be hanged!  I never knew a girl so full of nonsense and tricks as Mary.  You are welcome, doctor, to my house; let me have a look at you!\"  Jack Everson laughingly stepped hack a couple of paces and posed for inspection.  The elder deliberately drew his spectacle case from his pocket, adjusted the glasses and coolly scrutinized the young man from head to foot.  \"You'll do,\" he quietly remarked, removing his glasses and returning them to the morocco case; \"now, if you'll be good enough to seat yourself, we'll talk over matters until dinner time.  When did you arrive?\"  Jack seated himself on the remaining camp stool, a few paces from the happy young lady, accepted a cheroot from his host, and the conversation became general.  Like most Americans, when at home or travelling, Jack Everson kept his eyes and ears open.  He heard at Calcutta, his starting point, at Benares, Allahabad, Cawnpore and other places, the whisperings of the uprising that was soon to come, and his alarm increased as he penetrated the country.  \"Worse than all,\" he said gravely, speaking of his trip, \"one of my bearers spoke English well, and quite an intimacy sprang up between us. Since his companions could not utter a word in our language, we conversed freely without being understood.  He was reticent at first concerning the impending danger and professed to know nothing of it, but this forenoon be gave me to understand, in words that could not be mistaken, that the whole country would soon be aflame with insurrection.\"  \"Did he offer any advice?\" asked Dr. Marlowe, less impressed with the news than was his visitor or his daughter.  \"He did; he said that the escape of myself and of your family could be secured only by leaving this place at the earliest moment possible.\"  \"But whither can we go?  We are hundreds of miles from the seacoast and should have to journey for weeks through a country swarming with enemies.\"  \"I asked him that question, and his answer was that we should make for Nepaul.\"  \"That is the province to the east of us.  It is a mountainous country, a long way off, and hard to reach.  Why should he advise us to go thither?\"  \"I questioned him, but he seemed to fear that his companions would grow suspicious over our conversation and he said nothing more.  I thought he would add something definite when we came to separate, and, to loosen his tongue, I gave him an extra fee, but he added never a word, and, unless I am mistaken, regretted what he had already said.\"  \"It seems to me,\" observed the daughter, \"that the man knew it is impossible for us to get to the seacoast, and believed that by going further into the interior we should reach the people who are not affected by the insurrection.  Wide as it may be, there"]]]
