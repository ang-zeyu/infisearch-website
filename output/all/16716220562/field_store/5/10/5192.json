And then I began to think how many kinds of idiot I was. Here I was thirty or forty miles from home, in the mountains where no one goes in the winter and where I knew the snow got to be ten or fifteen feet deep. But I could never see the good of moping, so I got up and got breakfast while Baby put her shoes on. We had our squirrels and more baked potatoes and I had delicious black coffee.  After I had eaten I felt more hopeful. I knew Mr. Stewart would hunt for me if he knew I was lost. It was true, he wouldn't know which way to start, but I determined to rig up \"Jeems\" and turn him loose, for I knew he would go home and that he would leave a trail so that I could be found. I hated to do so, for I knew I should always have to be powerfully humble afterwards. Anyway it was still snowing, great, heavy flakes; they looked as large as dollars. I didn't want to start \"Jeems\" until the snow stopped because I wanted him to leave a clear trail. I had sixteen loads for my gun and I reasoned that I could likely kill enough food to last twice that many days by being careful what I shot at. It just kept snowing, so at last I decided to take a little hunt and provide for the day. I left Jerrine happy with the towel rolled into a baby, and went along the brow of the mountain for almost a mile, but the snow fell so thickly that I couldn't see far. Then I happened to look down into the ca単on that lay east of us and saw smoke. I looked toward it a long time, but could make out nothing but smoke, but presently I heard a dog bark and I knew I was near a camp of some kind. I resolved to join them, so went back to break my own camp.  At last everything was ready and Jerrine and I both mounted. Of all the times! If you think there is much comfort, or even security, in riding a pack-horse in a snowstorm over mountains where there is no road, you are plumb wrong. Every once in a while a tree would unload its snow down our backs. \"Jeems\" kept stumbling and threatening to break our necks. At last we got down the mountain-side, where new danger confronted us,--we might lose sight of the smoke or ride into a bog. But at last, after what seemed hours, we came into a \"clearing\" with a small log house and, what is rare in Wyoming, a fireplace. Three or four hounds set up their deep baying, and I knew by the chimney and the hounds that it was the home of a Southerner. A little old man came bustling out, chewing his tobacco so fast, and almost frantic about his suspenders, which it seemed he couldn't get adjusted.  As I rode up, he said, \"Whither, friend?\" I said \"Hither.\" Then he asked, \"Air you spying around for one of them dinged game wardens arter that deer I killed yisteddy?\" I told him I had never even seen a game warden and that I didn't know he had killed a deer. \"Wall,\" he said, \"air you spying around arter that gold mine I diskivered over on the west side of Baldy?\" But after a while I convinced him that I was no more nor less than a foolish woman lost in the snow. Then he said, \"Light, stranger, and look at your saddle.\" So I \"lit\" and looked, and then I asked him what part of the South he was from. He answered, \"Yell County, by gum! The best place in the United States, or in the world, either.\" That was my introduction to Zebulon Pike Parker.  Only two \"Johnny Rebs\" could have enjoyed each other's company as Zebulon Pike and myself did. He was so small and so old, but so cheerful and so sprightly, and a real Southerner! He had a big, open fireplace with backlogs and andirons. How I enjoyed it all! How we feasted on some of the deer killed \"yisteddy,\" and real corn-pone baked in a skillet down on the hearth. He was so full of happy recollections and had a few that were not so happy! He is, in some way, a kinsman of Pike of Pike's Peak fame, and he came west \"jist arter the wah\" on some expedition and \"jist stayed.\" He told me about his home life back in Yell County, and I feel that I know all the \"young uns.\"  There was George Henry, his only brother; and there were Phoebe and \"Mothie,\" whose real name is Martha; and poor little Mary Ann, whose death was described so feelingly that no one could keep back the tears. Lastly there was little Mandy, the baby and his favorite, but who, I am afraid, was a selfish little beast since she had to have her prunellas when all the rest of the \"young uns\" had to wear shoes that old Uncle Buck made out of rawhide. But then \"her eyes were blue as morning-glories and her hair was jist like corn-silk, so yaller and fluffy.\" Bless his simple, honest heart! His own eyes are blue and kind, and his poor, thin little shoulders are so round that they almost meet in front. How he loved to talk of his boyhood days! I can almost see his father and George Henry as they marched away to the \"wah\" together, and the poor little mother's despair as she waited day after day for some word, that never came.  Poor little Mary Ann was drowned in the bayou, where she was trying to get water-lilies. She had wanted a white dress all her life and so, when she was dead, they took down the white cross-bar curtains and Mother made the little shroud by the light of a tallow dip. But, being made by hand, it took all the next day, too, so that they buried her by moonlight down back of the orchard under the big elm where the children had always had their swing. And they lined and covered her grave with big, fragrant water-lilies. As they lowered the poor little home-made coffin into the grave the mockingbirds began to sing and they sang all that dewy, moonlight night. Then little Mandy's wedding to Judge Carter's son Jim was described. She wore a \"cream-colored poplin with a red rose throwed up in it,\" and the lace that was on Grandma's wedding dress. There were bowers of sweet Southern roses and honeysuckle and wistaria. Don't you know she was a dainty bride?  At last it came out that he had not heard from home since he left it. \"Don't you ever write?\" I asked. \"No, I am not an eddicated man, although I started to school. Yes'm, I started along of the rest, but they told me it was a Yankee teacher and I was 'fraid, so when I got most to the schoolhouse I hid in the bushes with my spelling-book, so that is all the learning I ever got. But my mother was an eddicated woman, yes'm, she could both read and write. I have the Bible she give me yit. Yes'm, you jist wait and I'll show you.\" After some rummaging in a box he came back with a small leather-bound Bible with print so small it was hard to read. After turning to the record of births and deaths he handed it to me, his wrinkled old face shining with pride as he said, \"There, my mother wrote that with her own hand.\" I took the book and after a little deciphered that \"Zebulon Pike Parker was born Feb. 10, 1830,\" written in the stiff, difficult style of long ago and written with pokeberry ink. He said his mother used to read about some \"old feller that was jist covered with biles,\" so I read Job to him, and he was full of surprise they didn't \"git some cherry bark and some sasparilly and bile it good and gin it to him.\"  He had a side room to his cabin, which was his bedroom; so that night he spread down a buffalo robe and two bearskins before the fire for Jerrine and me. After making sure there were no moths in them, I spread blankets over them and put a sleepy, happy little girl to bed, for he had insisted on making molasses candy for her because they happened to be born on the same day of the month. And then he played the fiddle until almost one o'clock. He played all the simple, sweet, old-time pieces, in rather a squeaky, jerky way, I am afraid, but the music suited the time and the place.  Next morning he called me early and when I went out I saw such a beautiful sunrise, well worth the effort of coming to see. I had thought his cabin in a ca単on, but the snow had deceived me, for a few steps from the door the mountains seemed to drop down suddenly for several hundred feet and the first of the snow peaks seemed to lie right at our feet. Around its base is a great swamp, in which the swamp pines grow very thickly and from which a vapor was rising that got about halfway up the snow peak all around. Fancy to yourself a big jewel-box of dark green velvet lined with silver chiffon, the snow peak lying like an immense opal in its center and over all the amber light of a new day. That is what it looked most like.  Well, we next went to the corral, where I was surprised to find about thirty head of sheep. Some of them looked like they should have been sold ten years before. \"Don't you ever sell any of your sheep?\" I asked. \"No'm. There was a feller come here once and wanted to buy some of my wethers, but I wouldn't sell any because I didn't need any money.\" Then he went from animal to animal, caressing each and talking to them, calling them each by name. He milked his one cow, fed his two little mules, and then we went back to the house to cook breakfast. We had delicious venison steak, smoking hot, and hoe-cakes and the \"bestest\" coffee, and honey.  After breakfast we set out for home. Our pack transferred to one of the little mules, we rode \"Jeems,\" and Mr. Parker rode the other mule. He took us another way, down ca単on after ca単on, so that we were able to ride all the time and could make better speed. We came down out of the snow and camped within twelve miles of home in an old, deserted ranch house. We had grouse and sage chicken for supper. I was so anxious to get home that I could hardly sleep, but at last I did and was only awakened by the odor of coffee, and barely had time to wash before Zebulon Pike called breakfast. Afterwards we fixed \"Jeems's\" pack so that I could still ride, for Zebulon Pike was very anxious to get back to his \"critters.\"  Poor, lonely, childlike little man! He tried to tell me how glad he had been to entertain me. \"Why,\" he said, \"I was plumb glad to see you and right sorry to have you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16623"],["title","Letters of a Woman Homesteader (#4)"],["body",". Why, I would jist as soon talk to you as to a nigger. Yes'm, I would. It has been almost as good as talking to old Aunt Dilsey.\" If a Yankee had said the same to me I would have demanded instant apology, but I know how the Southern heart longs for the dear, kindly old \"niggers,\" so I came on homeward, thankful for the first time that I can't talk correctly.  I got home at twelve and found, to my joy, that none of the men had returned, so I am safe from their superiority for a while, at least.  With many apologies for this outrageous letter, I am    Your ex-Washlady,     ELINORE RUPERT.     V  SEDALIA AND REGALIA        _November 22, 1909._  MY DEAR FRIEND,--  I was dreadfully afraid that my last letter was too much for you and now I feel plumb guilty. I really don't know how to write you, for I have to write so much to say so little, and now that my last letter made you sick I almost wish so many things didn't happen to me, for I always want to tell you. Many things have happened since I last wrote, and Zebulon Pike is not done for by any means, but I guess I will tell you my newest experience.  I am making a wedding dress. Don't grin; it isn't mine,--worse luck! But I must begin at the beginning. Just after I wrote you before, there came a terrific storm which made me appreciate indoor coziness, but as only Baby and I were at home I expected to be very lonely. The snow was just whirling when I saw some one pass the window. I opened the door and in came the dumpiest little woman and two daughters. She asked me if I was \"Mis' Rupit.\" I told her that she had almost guessed it, and then she introduced herself. She said she was \"Mis' Lane,\" that she had heard there was a new stranger in the country, so she had brought her twin girls, Sedalia and Regalia, to be neighborly. While they were taking off their many coats and wraps it came out that they were from Linwood, thirty miles away. I was powerful glad I had a pot roast and some baked beans.  After we had put the horses in the barn we had dinner and I heard the story of the girls' odd names. The mother is one of those \"comfy,\" fat little women who remain happy and bubbling with fun in spite of hard knocks. I had already fallen in love with Regalia, she is so jolly and unaffected, so fat and so plain. Sedalia has a veneer of most uncomfortable refinement. She was shocked because Gale ate all the roast she wanted, and if I had been very sensitive I would have been in tears, because I ate a helping more than Gale did.  But about the names. It seemed that \"Mis' Lane\" married quite young, was an orphan, and had no one to tell her things she should have known. She lived in Missouri, but about a year after her marriage the young couple started overland for the West. It was in November, and one night when they had reached the plains a real blue blizzard struck them. \"Mis' Lane\" had been in pain all day and soon she knew what was the matter. They were alone and it was a day's travel back to the last house. The team had given out and the wind and sleet were seeing which could do the most meanness. At last the poor man got a fire started and a wagon sheet stretched in such a manner that it kept off the sleet. He fixed a bed under the poor shelter and did all he could to keep the fire from blowing away, and there, a few hours later, a little girl baby was born. They melted sleet in the frying-pan to get water to wash it. \"Mis' Lane\" kept feeling no better fast, and about the time they got the poor baby dressed a second little one came.  That she told me herself is proof she didn't die, I guess, but it is right hard to believe she didn't. Luckily the fire lasted until the babies were dressed and the mother began to feel better, for there was no wood. Soon the wind stopped and the snow fell steadily. It was warmer, and the whole family snuggled up under the wagon sheet and slept.  Mr. Lane is a powerful good husband. He waited two whole days for his wife to gain strength before he resumed the journey, and on the third morning he actually carried her to the wagon. Just think of it! Could more be asked of any man?  Every turn of the wheels made poor \"Mis' Lane\" more homesick. Like Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch, she had a taste for geographical names, and \"Mis' Lane\" is very loyal, so she wanted to call the little first-born \"Missouri.\" Mr. Lane said she might, but that if she did he would call the other one \"Arkansas.\" Sometimes homesickness would almost master her. She would hug up the little red baby and murmur \"Missouri,\" and then daddy would growl playfully to \"Arkansas.\" It went on that way for a long time and at last she remembered that Sedalia was in Missouri, so she felt glad and really named the older baby \"Sedalia.\" But she could think of nothing to match the name and was in constant fear the father would name the other baby \"Little Rock.\"  For three years poor Gale was just \"t'other one.\" Then the Lanes went to Green River where some lodge was having a parade. They were watching the drill when a \"bystander that was standing by\" said something about the \"fine regalia.\" Instantly \"Mis' Lane\" thought of her unnamed child; so since that time Gale has had a name.  There could be no two people more unlike than the sisters. Sedalia is really handsome, and she is thin. But she is vain, selfish, shallow, and conceited. Gale is not even pretty, but she is clean and she is honest. She does many little things that are not exactly polite, but she is good and true. They both went to the barn with me to milk. Gale tucked up her skirts and helped me. She said, \"I just love a stable, with its hay and comfortable, contented cattle. I never go into one without thinking of the little baby Christ. I almost expect to see a little red baby in the straw every time I peek into a manger.\"  Sedalia answered, \"Well, for Heaven's sake, get out of the stable to preach. Who wants to stand among these smelly cows all day?\"  They stayed with us almost a week, and one day when Gale and I were milking she asked me to invite her to stay with me a month. She said to ask her mother, and left her mother and myself much together. But Sedalia stuck to her mother like a plaster and I just could not stand Sedalia a whole month. However, I was spared all embarrassment, for \"Mis' Lane\" asked me if I could not find work enough to keep Gale busy for a month or two. She went on to explain that Sedalia was expecting to be married and that Gale was so \"common\" she would really spoil the match. I was surprised and indignant, especially as Sedalia sat and listened so brazenly, so I said I thought Sedalia would need all the help she could get to get married and that I should be glad to have Gale visit me as long as she liked.  So Gale stayed on with me. One afternoon she had gone to the post-office when I saw Mr. Patterson ride up. He went into the bunk-house to wait until the men should come. Now, from something Gale had said I fancied that Bob Patterson must be the right man. I am afraid I am not very delicate about that kind of meddling, and while I had been given to understand that Patterson was the man Sedalia expected to marry, I didn't think any man would choose her if he could get Gale, so I called him. We had a long chat and he told me frankly he wanted Gale, but that she didn't care for him, and that they kept throwing \"that danged Sedalia\" at him. Then he begged my pardon for saying \"danged,\" but I told him I approved of the word when applied to Sedalia, and broke the news to him that Gale was staying with me. He fairly beamed. So that night I left Gale to wash dishes and Bob to help her while I held Mr. Stewart a prisoner in the stable and questioned him regarding Patterson's prospects and habits. I found both all that need be, and told Mr. Stewart about my talk with Patterson, and he said, \"Wooman, some day ye'll gang ploom daft.\" But he admitted he was glad it was the \"bonny lassie, instead of the bony one.\" When we went to the house Mr. Stewart said, \"Weel, when are you douchy bairns gangin' to the kirk?\"  They left it to me, so I set Thanksgiving Day, and as there is no \"kirk to gang to,\" we are going to have a justice of the peace and they are to be married here. We are going to have the dandiest dinner that I can cook, and Mr. Stewart went to town next day for the wedding dress, the gayest plaid outside of Caledonia. But Gale has lots of sense and is going to wear it. I have it almost finished, and while it doesn't look just like a Worth model, still it looks plumb good for me to have made. The boys are going up after Zebulon Pike, and Mr. Stewart is going after \"Mis' Lane.\" Joy waves are radiating from this ranch and about Thanksgiving morning one will strike you.  With lots of love and happy wishes,    Your ex-Washlady,     ELINORE RUPERT.     VI  A THANKSGIVING-DAY WEDDING   DEAR MRS. CONEY,--  ... I think every one enjoyed our Thanksgiving programme except poor Gale. She was grieved, I verily believe, because Mr. Patterson is not Mormon and could not take Sedalia and herself also. I suppose it seemed odd to her to be unable to give way to Sedalia as she had always done.  I had cooked and cooked. Gale and Zebulon Pike both helped all they could. The wedding was to be at twelve o'clock, so at ten I hustled Gale into my room to dress. I had to lock the door to keep her in, and I divided my time between the last touches to my dinner and the finishing touches to Gale's toilet and receiving the people. The Lane party had not come yet, and I was scared to death lest Sedalia had had a tantrum and that Mr. Stewart would not get back in time. At last I left the people to take care of themselves, for I had too much on my mind to bother with them. Just after eleven Mr. Stewart, Mis' Lane, Sedalia, and Pa Lane \"arriv\" and came at once into the kitchen to warm. In a little while poor, frightened Gale came creeping in, looking guilty. But she looked lovely, too, in spite of her plaid dress. She wore her"]]]
