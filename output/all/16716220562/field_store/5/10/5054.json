The anger, the despair, even the self-humiliation and anguish of repentance, were gone with the night. Morning was here,--a new day and a new life. \"Here is the new Hildegarde!\" she cried as she plunged her face into the clear, sparkling water. \"Do you see me, blue dragons? Shake paws, you foolish creatures, and don't stand ramping and glaring at each other in that way! Here is a new girl come to see you. The old one was a minx,--do you hear, dragons?\" The dragons heard, but were too polite to say anything; and as for not ramping, why they had ramped and glared for fifty years, and had no idea of making a change at their time of life.  The gilt cherubs round the little mirror were more amiable, and smiled cheerfully at Hilda as she brushed and braided her hair, and put on the pretty blue gingham frock. \"We have no clothes ourselves,\" they seemed to say, \"but we appreciate good ones when we see them!\" Indeed, the frock fitted to perfection. \"And after all,\" said the new Hilda as she twirled round in front of the glass, \"what _is_ the use of an overskirt?\" after which astounding utterance, this young person proceeded to do something still more singular. After a moment's hesitation she drew out one of the white aprons which she had scornfully laid in the very lowest drawer only twelve hours before, tied it round her slender waist, and then, with an entirely satisfied little nod at the mirror, she tripped lightly downstairs and into the kitchen. Dame Hartley was washing dishes at the farther end of the room, in her neat little cedar dish-tub, with her neat little mop; and she nearly dropped the blue and white platter from her hands when she heard Hilda's cheerful \"Good morning, Nurse Lucy!\" and, turning, saw the girl smiling like a vision of morning.  \"My dear,\" she cried, \"sure I thought you were fast asleep still. I was going up to wake you as soon as I had done my dishes. And did you sleep well your first night at Hartley's Glen?\"  \"Oh, yes! I slept very sound indeed,\" said Hilda, lightly. And then, coming close up to Dame Hartley, she said in an altered tone, and with heightened color: \"Nurse Lucy, I did not behave well last night, and I want to tell you that I am sorry. I am not like mamma, but I want to grow a little like her, if I can, and you must help me, please!\"  Her voice faltered, and good Nurse Lucy, laying down her mop, took the slender figure in her motherly arms, from which it did not now shrink away.  \"My lamb!\" she said; \"Miss Mildred's own dear child! You look liker your blessed mother this minute than I ever thought you would. Help you? That I will, with all my heart!--though I doubt if you need much help, coming to yourself so soon as this. Well, well!\"  \"Coming to herself!\" It was the same phrase the good dame had used the night before, and it struck Hilda's mind with renewed force. Yes, she had come to herself,--her new self, which was to be so different from the old. How strange it all was! What should she do now, to prove the new Hilda and try her strength? Something must be done at once; the time for folded hands and listless revery was gone by.  \"Shall I--may I help you to get breakfast?\" she asked aloud, rather timidly.  \"Breakfast? Bless you, honey, we had breakfast two hours ago. We farmers are early birds, you know. But you can lay a plate and napkin for yourself, if you like, while I drop a couple of fresh eggs and toast a bit of bacon for you. Do you like bacon, then?\"  Rather disappointed at the failure of her first attempt to be useful, Hilda laid the snowy napkin on the shining table, and chose a pretty blue and white plate from the well-stocked shelves of the dresser.  \"And now open that cupboard, my lamb,\" said her hostess, \"and you'll find the loaf, and a piece of honeycomb, and some raspberries. I'll bring a pat of butter and some milk from the dairy, where it's all cool for you.\"  \"Raspberries!\" cried Hilda. \"Oh, how delightful! Why, the dew is still on them, Nurse Lucy! And how pretty they look, with the cool green leaves round them!\"  \"Ay!\" said the good woman, \"Jacob brought them in not ten minutes ago. He thought you would like them fresh from the bushes.\"  Hilda's cheek rivalled the raspberries in bloom as she bent over them to inhale their fragrance. The farmer had picked these himself for her,--had probably left his work to do so; and she had called him an odious old savage, and an unkempt monster, and--oh dear! decidedly, the old Hilda was a very disagreeable girl. But here were the eggs, each blushing behind its veil of white, and here was the milk, and a little firm nugget in a green leaf, which was too beautiful to be butter, and yet too good to be anything else. And the new Hilda might eat her breakfast with a thankful heart, and did so. The white rose nodded to her from the west window much more cordially than it had done the night before. It even brought out a little new bud to take a peep at the girl who now smiled, instead of scowling across the room. The vines rustled and shook, and two bright black eyes peeped between the leaves. \"Tweet!\" said the robin, ruffling his scarlet waistcoat a little. \"When you have quite finished your worms, you may come out, and I will show you the garden. There are cherries!\" and away he flew, while Hilda laughed and clapped her hands, for she had understood every word.  \"May I go out into the garden?\" she asked, when she had finished her breakfast and taken her first lesson in dish-washing, in spite of Dame Hartley's protest. \"And isn't there something I can do there, please? I want to work; I don't want to be idle any longer.\"  \"Well, honey,\" replied the dame, \"there are currants to pick, if you like such work as that. I am going to make jelly to-morrow; and if you like to begin the picking, I will come and help you when my bread is out of the oven.\"  Gladly Hilda flew up to her room for the broad-leaved hat with the daisy-wreath; and then, taking the wide, shallow basket which Dame Hartley handed her, she fairly danced out of the door, over the bit of green, and into the garden.  Ah! the sweet, heartsome country garden that this was,--the very thought of it is a rest and a pleasure. Straight down the middle ran a little gravel path, with a border of fragrant clove-pinks on either side, planted so close together that one saw only the masses of pale pink blossoms resting on their bed of slender silvery leaves. And over the border! Oh the wealth of flowers, the blaze of crimson and purple and gold, the bells that swung, the spires that sprang heavenward, the clusters that nodded and whispered together in the morning breeze! Here were ranks upon ranks of silver lilies, drawn up in military fashion, and marshalled by clumps of splendid tiger-lilies,--the drum-majors of the flower-garden. Here were roses of every sort, blushing and paling, glowing in gold and mantling in crimson. And the carnations showed their delicate fringes, and the geraniums blazed, and the heliotrope languished, and the \"Puritan pansies\" lifted their sweet faces and looked gravely about, as if reproving the other flowers for their frivolity; while shy Mignonette, thinking herself well hidden behind her green leaves, still made her presence known by the exquisite perfume which all her gay sisters would have been glad to borrow.  Over all went the sunbeams, rollicking and playing; and through all went Hildegarde, her heart filled with a new delight, feeling as if she had never lived before. She talked to the flowers. She bent and kissed the damask rose, which was too beautiful to pluck. She put her cheek against a lily's satin-silver petals, and started when an angry bee flew out and buzzed against her nose. But where were the currant-bushes? Ah! there they were,--a row of stout green bushes, forming a hedge at the bottom of the garden.  Hilda fell busily to work, filling her basket with the fine, ruddy clusters. \"How beautiful they are!\" she thought, holding up a bunch so that the sunlight shone through it. \"And these pale, pinky golden ones, which show all the delicate veins inside. Really, I _must_ eat this fat bunch; they are like fairy grapes! The butler fay comes and picks a cluster every evening, and carries it on a lily-leaf platter to the queen as she sits supping on honey-cakes and dew under the damask rose-bush.\"  While fingers and fancy were thus busily employed, Hilda was startled by the sound of a voice which seemed to come from beyond the currant-bushes, very near her. She stood quite still and listened.  \"A-g, ag,\" said the voice; \"g-l-o-m, glom,--agglom; e-r er,--agglomer; a-t-e, ate,--agglomerate.\" There was a pause, and then it began again: \"A-g, ag; g-l-o-m, glom,\" etc.  Hilda's curiosity was now thoroughly aroused; and laying down her basket, she cautiously parted the leaves and peeped through. She hardly knew what she expected to see. What she did see was a boy about ten years old, in a flannel shirt and a pair of ragged breeches, busily weeding a row of carrots; for this was the vegetable garden, which lay behind the currant-bushes. On one side of the boy was a huge heap of weeds; on the other lay a tattered book, at which he glanced from time to time, though without leaving his work. \"A-n, an,\" he was now saying; \"t-i, ti,--anti; c-i-p, cip,--anticip; a-t-e, ate,--anti_cip_ate. 'To expect.' Well! that _is_ a good un. Why can't they _say_ expect, 'stead o' breakin' their jawsen with a word like that? Anti_cip_-ate! Well, I swan! I hope he enjoyed eatin' it. Sh'd think 't'd ha giv' him the dyspepsy, anyhow.\"  At this Hilda could contain herself no longer, but burst into a merry peal of laughter; and as the boy started up with staring eyes and open mouth, she pushed the bushes aside and came towards him. \"I am sorry I laughed,\" she said, not unkindly. \"You said that so funnily, I couldn't help it. You did not pronounce the word"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16473"],["title","Queen Hildegarde (#7)"],["body","right, either. It is an_ti_cipate, not antic_ip_-ate.\"  [Illustration: \"SHE PUSHED THE BUSHES ASIDE AND CAME TOWARDS HIM\"]  The boy looked half bewildered and half grateful. \"An_ti_cipate!\" he repeated, slowly. \"Thanky, miss! it's a onreasonable sort o' word, 'pears ter me.\" And he bent over his carrots again.  But Hilda did not return to her currant-picking. She was interested in this freckled, tow-headed boy, wrestling with four-syllabled words while he worked.  \"Why do you study your lesson out here?\" she asked, sitting down on a convenient stump, and refreshing herself with another bunch of white currants. \"Couldn't you learn it better indoors?\"  \"Dunno!\" replied the boy. \"Ain't got no time ter stay indoors.\"  \"You might learn it in the evening!\" suggested Hilda.  \"I can't keep awake evenin's,\" said the boy, simply. \"Hev to be up at four o'clock to let the cows out, an' I git sleepy, come night. An' I like it here too,\" he added. \"I can l'arn 'em easier, weedin'; take ten weeds to a word.\"  \"Ten weeds to a word?\" repeated Hilda. \"I don't understand you.\"  \"Why,\" said the boy, looking up at her with wide-open blue eyes, \"I take a good stiff word (I like 'em stiff, like that an--an_ti_cipate feller), and I says it over and over while I pull up ten weeds,--big weeds, o' course, pusley and sich. I don't count chickweed. By the time the weeds is up, I know the word, I've larned fifteen this spell!\" and he glanced proudly at his tattered spelling-book as he tugged away at a mammoth root of pusley, which stretched its ugly, sprawling length of fleshy arms on every side.  Hilda watched him for some moments, many new thoughts revolving in her head. How many country boys were there who taught themselves in this way? How many, among the clever girls at Mademoiselle Haut-ton's school, had this sort of ambition to learn, of pride in learning? Had she, the best scholar in her class, had it? She had always known her lessons, because they were easy for her to learn, because she had a quick eye and ear, and a good memory. She could not help learning, Mademoiselle said. But this,--this was something different!  \"What is your name?\" she asked, with a new interest.  \"Bubble Chirk,\" replied the freckled boy, with one eye on his book, and the other measuring a tall spire of pigweed, towards which he stretched his hand.  \"WHAT!\" cried Hilda, in amazement.  \"Bubble Chirk!\" said the boy. \"Kin' o' curus name, ain't it? The hull of it's Zerubbabel Chirk; but most folks ain't got time to say all that. It trips you up, too, sort o'. Bubble's what they call me; 'nless it's Bub.\"  The contrast between the boy's earnest and rather pathetic face, and his absurdly volatile name, was almost too much for Hilda's gravity. But she checked the laugh which rose to her lips, and asked: \"Don't you go to school at all, Bubble? It is a pity that you shouldn't, when you are so fond of study.\"  \"Gin'lly go for a spell in the winter,\" replied Bubble. \"They ain't no school in summer, y' know. Boys hes to work, round here. Mam ain't got nobody but me 'n Pink, sence father died.\"  \"Who is Pink?\" asked Hilda, gently.  \"My sister,\" replied Bubble. \"Thet ain't _her_ real name, nuther. Mam hed her christened Pinkrosia, along o' her bein' so fond o' roses, Mam was; but we don't call her nothin' only Pink.\"  \"Pink Chirk!\" repeated Hilda to herself. \"What a name! What can a girl be like who is called Pink Chirk?\"  But now Bubble seemed to think that it was his turn to ask questions. \"I reckon you're the gal that's come to stay at Mr. Hartley's?\" he said in an interrogative tone.  Hilda's brow darkened for a moment at the word \"gal,\" which came with innocent frankness from the lips of the ragged urchin before her. But the next moment she remembered that it was only the old Hilda who cared about such trifles; so she answered pleasantly enough:  \"Yes, I am staying at Mr. Hartley's. I only came yesterday, but I am to stay some time.\"  \"And what mought _your_ name be?\" inquired Master Chirk.  \"Hildegardis Graham.\" It was gently said, in a very different voice from that which had answered Farmer Hartley in the same words the night before; but it made a startling impression on Bubble Chirk.  \"Hildy--\" he began; and then, giving it up, he said simply: \"Well, I swan! Do ye kerry all that round with ye all the time?\"  Hilda laughed outright at this.  \"Oh, no!\" she said; \"I am called Hilda generally.\"  \"But you kin spell the hull of it?\" asked the boy anxiously.  \"Yes, certainly!\" Bubble's eager look subsided into one of mingled awe and admiration.  \"Reckon ye must know a heap,\" he said, rather wistfully. \"Wish't I did!\"  Hilda looked at him for a moment without speaking. Her old self was whispering to her. \"Take care what you do!\" it said. \"This is a coarse, common, dirty boy. He smells of the stable; his hair is full of hay; his hands are beyond description. What have you in common with such a creature? He has not even the sense to know that he is your inferior.\" \"I don't care!\" said the new Hilda. \"I know what mamma would do if she were here, and I shall do it,--or try to do it, at least. Hold your tongue, you supercilious minx!\"  \"Bubble,\" she said aloud, \"would you like me to teach you a little, while I am here? I think perhaps I could help you with your lessons.\"  The boy looked up with a sudden flash in his blue eyes, while his face grew crimson with pleasure.  \"Would I like it?\" he cried eagerly. But the next moment the glow faded, and he looked awkwardly down at his ragged book and still more ragged clothes. \"Guess I ain't no time to l'arn that way,\" he muttered in confusion.  \"Nonsense!\" said Hilda, decidedly. \"There must be _some_ hour in the day when you can be spared. I shall speak to Farmer Hartley about it. Don't look at your clothes, you foolish boy,\" she continued, with a touch of Queen Hildegardis' quality, yet with a kindly intonation which was new to that potentate. \"I am not going to teach your clothes. _You_ are not your clothes!\" cried Her Majesty, wondering at herself, and a little flushed with her recent victory over the \"minx.\" The boy's face brightened again.  \"That's so!\" he said, joyously; \"that's what Pink says. But I didn't s'pose _you'd_ think so,\" he added, glancing bashfully at the delicate, high-bred face, with its flashing eyes and imperial air.  \"I _do_ think so!\" said Hilda. \"So that is settled, and we will have our first lesson to-morrow. What would you--\"  \"Hilda! Hilda! where are you, dear?\" called Dame Hartley's voice from the other side of the currant-bush-hedge. And catching up her basket, and bidding a hasty good-by to her new acquaintance and future scholar, Hildegarde darted back through the bushes.  Zerubbabel Chirk looked after her a few moments, with kindling eyes and open mouth of wonder and admiration.  \"Wall!\" he said finally, after a pause of silent meditation, \"I swan! I reelly do! I swan to man!\" and fell to weeding again as if his life depended on it.     CHAPTER V.  THE BLUE PLATTER.        \"Merry it is in the green forést,       Among the leavés green!\"  Thus sang Hildegarde as she sat in the west window, busily stringing her currants. She had been thinking a great deal about Bubble Chirk, making plans for his education, and wondering what his sister Pink was like. He reminded her, she could not tell why, of the \"lytel boy\" who kept fair Alyce's swine, in her favorite ballad of \"Adam Bell, Clym o' the Clough, and William of Cloudeslee;\" and the words of the ballad rose half unconsciously to her lips as she bent over the great yellow bowl, heaped with scarlet and pale-gold clusters.       \"Merry it is in the green forést,       Among the leavés green,       Whenas men hunt east and west       With bows and arrowés keen,       \"For to raise the deer out of their denne,--       Such sights have oft been seen;       As by three yemen of the north countree:       By them it is, I mean.       \"The one of them hight Adam Bell,       The other Clym o' the Clough;       The third was Willyam of Cloudeslee,--       An archer good enough.       \"They were outlawed for venison,       These yemen every one.       They swore them brethren on a day       To English wood for to gone.       \"Now lythe and listen, gentylmen,       That of myrthes loveth to hear!\"  At this moment the door opened, and Farmer Hartley entered, taking off his battered straw hat as he did so, and wiping his forehead with a red bandanna handkerchief. Hilda looked up with a pleasant smile, meaning to thank him for the raspberries which he had gathered for her breakfast; but to her utter astonishment the moment his eyes fell upon her he gave a violent start and turned very pale; then, muttering something under his breath, he turned hastily and left the room.  \"Oh! what is the matter?\" cried Hilda, jumping up from her chair. \"What have I done, Nurse Lucy? I have made the farmer angry, somehow. Is this his chair? I thought--\"  \"No, no, honey dear!\" said Nurse Lucy soothingly. \"Sit ye down; sit ye down! You have done nothing. I'm right glad of it,\" she added, with a tone of sadness in her pleasant voice. \"Seeing as 'tis all in God's wisdom, Jacob must come to see it so; and 'tis no help, but a deal of hindrance, when folks set aside chairs and the like, and see only them that's gone sitting in them.\" Then, seeing Hilda's look of bewilderment, she added, laying her hand gently on the girl's soft hair: \"You see, dear, we had a daughter of our own this time last year. Our only one she was, and just about your age,--the light of our eyes, our Faith. She was a good girl, strong and loving and heartsome, and almost as pretty as yourself, Hilda dear; but the Father had need of her, so she was taken from us for a while. It was cruel hard for Jacob; cruel, cruel hard. He can't seem to see, even now, that it was right, or it wouldn't have been so. And so I can tell just what he felt, coming in just now, sudden like, and seeing you sitting in Faith's chair. Like as"]]]
