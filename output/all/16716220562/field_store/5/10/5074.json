Debussy, through his appreciation of the living value of the old church modes, has been enabled to shape for himself a manner of utterance which derives from none of these influences. It is anything but chromatic; indeed, one of its most striking characteristics is its use of whole-tone progressions, a natural result, of course, of its dependence upon the old modes. Other contemporary Frenchmen have made occasional use of Gregorian effects; but Debussy was the first to adopt them deliberately as the basis of a settled manner of utterance, and he has employed them with increasing consistency and devotion. His example has indubitably served to enrich the expressional material at the disposal of the modern music-maker--there cannot conceivably, in reason, be two opinions as to that: he has acted upon a principle which is, beyond question, liberating and stimulating. And the adaptability to his own peculiar temperament of the wavering and fluid order of discourse which is permitted by the flexibility and variety of the antique modes is sufficiently obvious.  His resort to Gregorian principles is, it has been observed, far from being a matter of recent history with him. Almost twenty years ago we find him writing in the spirit of the old modes. Examine the opening phrases of his song, _Harmonie du Soir_ (composed in 1889-1890), and note the felicitous adaptation to modern use of the \"authentic\" mode known as the Lydian, which corresponds to a C-major scale with F-sharp. Observe the use of the same mode in the introductory measures, and elsewhere, of his setting of Verlaine's _Il pleure dans mon coeur_ (1889), the second of the \"Ariettes.\" Five years later, in _Pelléas et Mélisande_, the trait is omnipresent--too extensive and obvious, indeed, to require detailed indication. One might point out, at random, the derivation from the seventh of the ecclesiastical modes (the Mixolydian) of the phrase in the accompaniment to Arkël's words in the final scene, \"L'âme humaine aime à s'en aller seule;\" or the relationship between the opening measures of the orchestral introduction to the drama and the first of the \"authentic\" modes, the Dorian; or between the same mode (corresponding to the D-minor scale without accidentals) and Mélisande's song at the tower window at the beginning of the third act.         *       *       *       *       *  It remains only to be said, by way of conclusion to this brief survey, that, for those who are disposed to open their sensibilities to the appeal of this music, its high and haunting beauty must exert an increasing sway over the heart and the imagination. It is making no excessive or invidious claim for it to assert that, after one has truly savored its quality, other music, transcendent though it may demonstrably be, seems a little coarse-fibred, a little otiose, a little--as Jules Laforgue might have said--_quotidienne_. But, however it may come to be ranked, there are few, I think, who will not recognize here an accent that is personal and unique, a peculiar ecstasy, a pervading and influential magic.     II  THE PLAY  ITS QUALITIES   Maurice Maeterlinck's _Pelléas et Mélisande_, published in 1892, stands fifth in the chronological order of his dramatic works. It was preceded by _La Princesse Maleine_ (1889); _L'Intruse_, _Les Aveugles_ (1890); and _Les sept Princesses_ (1891). Since its appearance Maeterlinck has published these plays: _Alladine et Palomides_; _Intérieur_; _La Mort de Tintagiles: Trois petits drames pour Marionnettes_ (1894); _Aglavaine et Selysette_ (1896); _Ariane et Barbe-Bleue_; _Soeur Béatrice_ (1901); _Monna Vanna_ (1902); _Joyzelle_ (1903). _Pelléas et Mélisande_, dedicated to Octave Mirbeau \"in token of deep friendship, admiration, and gratitude,\" was first performed at the Bouffes-Parisiens, Paris, on May 17, 1893, with this cast: _Pelléas_, Mlle. Marie Aubry; _Mélisande_, Mlle. Meuris; _Arkël_, Émile Raymond; _Golaud_, Lugné-Poë; _Geneviève_, Mme. Camée; _Le petit Yniold_, Georgette Loyer.  \"Take care,\" warns The Old Man in that most simply touching of Maeterlinck's plays, _Intérieur_; \"we do not know how far the soul extends about men.\" It is a subtle and characteristic saying, and it might have been used by the dramatist as a motto for his _Pelléas et Mélisande_; for not only does it embody the central thought of this poignant masque of passion and destiny, but it summarizes Maeterlinck's attitude as a writer of drama. \"In the theatre,\" he says in the introduction to his translation of Ruysbroeck's _l'Ornement des Noces Spirituelles_, \"I wish to study ... man, not relatively to other people, not in his relations to others or to himself; but, after sketching the ordinary facts of passion, to look at his attitude in presence of eternity and mystery, to attempt to unveil the eternal nature hidden under the accidental characteristics of the lover, father, husband.... Is the thought an exact picture of that something which produced it? Is it not rather a shadow of some struggle, similar to that of Jacob with the Angel?\" Art, he has said, \"is a temporary mask, under which the unknown without a face puzzles us. It is the substance of eternity, introduced ...by a distillation of infinity. It is the honey of eternity, taken from a flower of eternity.\" Everywhere, throughout his most deeply characteristic work, he emphasizes this thought--he would have us realize that we are the unconscious protagonists of an overshadowing, vast, and august drama whose significance and _dénouement_ we do not and cannot know, but of which mysterious intimations are constantly to be perceived and felt. The characters in his plays live, as the old king, Arkël, says in _Pelléas et Mélisande_, like persons \"whispering about a closed room,\" This drama--at once his most typical, moving, and beautiful performance--swims in an atmosphere of portent and bodement; here, as Pater noted in the work of a wholly different order of artist, \"the storm is always brooding;\" here, too, \"in a sudden tremor of an aged voice, in the tacit observance of a day,\" we become \"aware suddenly of the great stream of human tears falling always through the shadows of the world.\" Mystery and sorrow--these are its keynotes; separately or in consonance, they are sounded from beginning to end of this strange and muted tragedy. It is full of a quality of emotion, of beauty, which is as \"a touch from behind a curtain,\" issuing from a background vague and illimitable. One is aware of vast and inscrutable forces, working in silence and indirection, which somehow control and direct the shadowy figures who move dimly, with grave and wistful pathos, through a no less shadowy pageant of griefs and ecstasies and fatalities. They are little more than the instruments of a mysterious will, these vague and mist-enwrapped personages, who seem always to be unconscious actors in some secret and hidden drama whose progress is concealed behind the tangible drama of passionate and tragic circumstance in which they are ostensibly taking part.  \"Maeterlinck's man,\" says S.C. de Soissons in a penetrating study of the Belgian's dramatic methods, \"is a being whose sensuous life is only a concrete symbol of his infinite transcendental side; and, further, is only a link in an endless change of innumerable existences, a link that remains in continual communication, in mutual union with all the other links.... In Maeterlinck's dramas the whole of nature vibrates with man, either warning him of coming catastrophes or taking on a mournful attitude after they have happened. He considers man to be a great, fathomless mystery, which one cannot determine precisely, at which one can only glance, noting his involuntary and instinctive words, exclamations and impressions. Maeterlinck consciously deprives nature of her passive rôle of a soulless accessory, he animates her, orders her to collaborate actively in the action of the drama, to speak mysteriously beside man and to man, to forecast future incidents and catastrophes, in a word, to participate in all the actions of that fragment of human life which is called a drama.\" This \"rhythmic correspondence,\" as Mr. James Huneker calls it, between man and his environment, is nowhere more effectively insisted upon by Maeterlinck than in _Pelléas et Mélisande_. Note the incident at the conclusion of the first act, where the departure of the ship and the gathering of the storm are commented upon by the two lovers in a scene which is charged with an inescapable atmosphere of foreboding; note the incident of the fugitive doves in the scene at Mélisande's tower window; or the episodic passage near the end of the third act, during the tense and painful scene of Golaud's espionage: \"Do you see those poor people down there trying to kindle a little fire in the forest?--It has rained. And over there, do you see the old gardener trying to lift that tree that the wind has blown down across the road?--He cannot; the tree is too big ... too heavy; ... it will lie where it fell.\" Note, further on (in the third scene of the fourth act), just in advance of the culmination of the tragedy, the strange and ominous scene wherein Little Yniold describes the passing of the flock of sheep:       \"Why, there is no more sun.... They are coming, the little sheep.      How many there are! They fear the dark! They crowd together! They      cry! and they go quick! They are at the crossroads, and they know      not which way to turn!... Now they are still.... Shepherd! why do      they not speak any more?       THE SHEPHERD (_who is out of sight_)     \"Because it is no longer the road to the fold.       YNIOLD     \"Where are they going?--Shepherd! Shepherd!--where are they      going?--Where are they going to sleep to-night? Oh! oh! it is too      dark!--I am going to tell something to somebody.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16488"],["title","Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande (#3)"],["body","the setting, the accessories, reflect and underscore the inner movement of the drama, and always with arresting and intense effect.  It tempts one to extravagant praise, this heart-shaking and lovely drama; this _vieille et triste légende de la forêt_, with its indescribable glamour, its affecting sincerity, its restraint, its exquisite and unflagging simplicity. The hesitant and melancholy personages who invest its scenes--Mélisande, timid, naïve, child-like, wistful, mercurial, infinitely pathetic; Pelléas, dream-filled, ardent, yet honorable in his passion; old Arkël, wise, gentle, and resigned; the tragic and brooding figure of Golaud; Little Yniold, artless and pitiful, a figure impossible anywhere save in Maeterlinck; the grave and simple diction, at times direct and homely in phrasing and imagery, at times rapturous, subtle, and evasive; the haunting _mise-en-scène_: the dim forest, the fountain in the park, the luminous and fragrant nightfall, the occasional glimpses, sombre and threatening, of the sea, the silent and gloomy castle,--all these unite to form a dramatic and poetic and pictorial ensemble which completely fascinates and enchains the mind. The result would have been as inconceivable before Maeterlinck undertook the writing of drama as, to-day, it is inimitable and untouched.   ITS ACTION  Maeterlinck's play, as adapted by Debussy for musical setting, becomes a \"lyric drama in five acts and twelve tableaux.\" Certain portions have been left out--as the scenes, at the beginning of Act I and Act V, in which the servingwomen of the castle appear; the fourth scene of Act II, in which Pelléas is persuaded by Arkël to postpone his journey to the bedside of his dying friend Marcellus; the opening scene of Act III, between Pelléas, Mélisande, and Yniold. Numerous passages that are either not essential to the development of the action, or that do not invite musical transmutation, have been curtailed or omitted, with the result that the movement of the drama has been compressed and accelerated throughout. In outlining very briefly the action of the play (which should be read in the original by all who would know Debussy's setting of it) I shall adhere to the slightly altered version which forms the actual text of the opera.  The characters are these:  ARKËL, _King of Allemonde_ PELLÉAS & GOLAUD, _half-brothers, grandsons of_ ARKËL MÉLISANDE, _an unknown princess; later the bride of_ GOLAUD LITTLE YNIOLD, _Son of_ GOLAUD _by a former marriage_ GENEVIÈVE, _Mother of_ PELLÉAS _and_ GOLAUD A PHYSICIAN _Servants, Beggars, etc._     ACT I  The opening scene is in a forest, in an unknown land. It is autumn. Golaud, gray-bearded, stern, a giant in stature (\"I am made of iron and blood,\" he says of himself), has been hunting a wild boar, and has been led astray. His dogs have left him to follow a false scent. He is about to retrace his steps, when he comes upon a young girl weeping by a spring. She is very beautiful, and very timid. She would flee, but Golaud reassures her. Her dress is that of a princess, though her garments have been torn by the briars. Golaud questions her. Her name, she says, is Mélisande; she was born \"far away;\" she has fled, and is lost; but she will not tell her age, or whence she came, or what injury has been done her, or who it is that has harmed or threatened her--\"Every one! every one!\" she says. Her golden crown has fallen into the water--\"It is the crown he gave me,\" she cries; \"it fell as I was weeping.\" Golaud would recover it for her, but she will have no more of it.... \"I had rather die at once!\" she protests. Golaud prevails upon her to go with him--the night is coming on, and she cannot remain alone in the forest. She refuses, at first, in terror, then reluctantly consents. \"Where are you going?\" she asks. \"I do not know.... I, too, am lost,\" replies Golaud. They leave together.  The scene changes to a hall in the castle--the silent and forbidding castle near the sea, surrounded by deep forests, where Golaud, with his mother Geneviève and his little son Yniold (the child of his first wife, now dead), lives with his aged father, Arkël, king of Allemonde. Here, too, lives Golaud's young half-brother, Pelléas--for they are not sons of the same father. Half a year has passed, and it is spring. Geneviève reads to her father, the ancient Arkël, a letter sent by Golaud to Pelléas. After recounting the circumstances of his meeting with Mélisande, Golaud continues: \"It is now six months since I married her, and I know as little of her past as on the day we met. Meanwhile, dear Pelléas, you whom I love more than a brother, ... make ready for our return. I know that my mother will gladly pardon me; but I dread the King, in spite of all his kindness. If, however, he will consent to receive her as if she were his own daughter, light a lamp at the summit of the tower overlooking the sea, upon the third night after you receive this letter. I shall be able to see it from our vessel. If I see no light, I shall pass on and shall return no more.\" They decide to receive Golaud and his child-bride, although the marriage has prevented a union which, for political reasons, Arkël had arranged for his grandson.  Again the scene changes. Mélisande and Geneviève are walking together in the gardens, and they are joined by Pelléas. \"We shall have a storm to-night,\" he says, \"yet it is so calm now.... One might embark unwittingly and come back no more.\" They watch the departure of a great ship that is leaving the port, the ship that brought Golaud and his young wife. \"Why does she sail to-night?... She may be wrecked,\" says Mélisande.... \"The night comes quickly,\" observes Pelléas. A silence falls between them. \"It is time to go in,\" says Geneviève. \"Pelléas, show the way to Mélisande. I must go 'tend to little Yniold,\" and she leaves them alone. \"Will you let me take your hand?\" says Pelléas to Mélisande. Her hands are full of flowers, she responds. He will hold her arm, he says, for the road is steep. He tells her that he has had a letter from his dying friend Marcellus, summoning him to his bedside, and that he may perhaps go away on the morrow. \"Oh! why do you go away?\" says Mélisande.   ACT II  The second act begins at an old and abandoned fountain in the park--the \"Fountain of the Blind,\" so called because it once possessed miraculous healing powers. Pelléas and Mélisande enter together. It is a stifling day, and they seek the cool tranquillity of the fountain and the shadow of the overarching trees--\"One can hear the water sleep,\" says Pelléas. Their talk is dangerously intimate. Mélisande dips her hand in the cool water, and plays with her wedding-ring as she lies stretched along the edge of the marble basin. She throws the ring in the air and it falls into the deep water. Mélisande displays agitation: \"What shall we say if Golaud asks where it is?\" \"The truth, the truth,\" replies Pelléas.  The scene changes to an apartment in the castle. Golaud lies upon a bed, with Mélisande bending over him. He has been wounded while hunting. Mélisande is compassionate, perhaps remorseful. She too, she confesses, is ill, unhappy, though she will not tell Golaud what it is that ails her. Her husband discovers the absence of her wedding-ring, and harshly, suspiciously, asks where it is. Mélisande, confused and terrified, dissembles, and answers that she must have lost it in a grotto by the seashore, when she went there in the morning to pick shells for little Yniold. She is sure it is there. Golaud bids her go at once and search for it. She fears to go alone, and he suggests that she ask Pelléas to accompany her.  The next scene discovers Mélisande with Pelléas in the grotto. They are deeply agitated. It is very dark, but Pelléas describes to her the look of the place, for, he tells her, she must be able to answer Golaud if he should question her. The moon breaks through the clouds and illumines brightly the interior, revealing three old and white-haired beggars asleep against a ledge of rock. Mélisande is uneasy, and would go. They depart in silence.   ACT III  The opening scene of the third act shows the exterior of one of the towers of the castle, with a winding staircase passing beneath a window at which sits Mélisande, combing her unbound hair, and singing in the starlit darkness--\"like a beautiful strange bird,\" says Pelléas, who enters by the winding stair. He entreats her to lean further forward out of the window, that he may come closer, that he may touch her hand; for, he says, he is leaving on the morrow. She leans further out, telling him that he may take her hand if he will promise not to leave on the next day. Suddenly her long tresses fall over her head and stream about Pelléas. He is enraptured. \"I have never seen such hair as yours, Mélisande! See! see! Though it comes from so high, it floods me to the heart!... And it is sweet, sweet as though it fell from heaven!... I can no longer see the sky through your locks.... My two hands can no longer hold them.... They are alive like birds in my hands. And they love me, they love me more than you do!\" Mélisande begs to be released, Pelléas kisses the enveloping tresses.... \"Do you hear my kisses?--They mount along your hair.\" Doves come from the tower--Mélisande's doves--and fly about them. They are frightened, and are flying away. \"They will be lost in the dark!\" laments Mélisande. Golaud enters by the winding stair, and surprises them. Mélisande is entrapped by her hair, which is caught in the branches of a tree. \"What are you doing here?\" asks Golaud. They are confused, and stammer inarticulately. \"Mélisande, do not lean so far out of the window,\" cautions her husband. \"Do you not know how late it is? It is almost midnight. Do not play so in the darkness. You are a pair of children!\" He laughs nervously. \"What children!\"  He and Pelléas go out, and the scene shifts to the vaults in the depths under the castle,--dank, unwholesome depths, that "]]]
