Everybody was busy with the wreckage, so they were left almost entirely to themselves.  Tom was the first to get up, and going on deck found that the storm had cleared away and that the sun was shining brightly. Without delay he halted a sailor who happened to be passing.  \"What ship is this?\" he questioned.  \"Dis ship da _Golden Wave_,\" replied the sailor, who was a Norwegian.  \"And where are you bound?\"  \"Da ship sail for Australia.\"  \"Great Scott! Australia!\" gasped Tom. \"This is the worst yet.\"  \"What's up, Tom?\" asked Sam, who had followed his brother.  \"This sailor tells me this ship is bound for Australia.\"  \"Why, that is thousands of miles away!\"  \"I know it.\"  \"If we go to Australia, we'll never get back.\"  \"Not quite as bad as that, Sam. But we certainly don't want to go to Australia.\"  \"Who is the captain?\"  \"Captain Blossom,\" replied the sailor. \"Where is he?\"  The sailor said he would take them to the captain and did so. He proved to be a burly fellow with rather a sober-looking face.  \"Got around at last, eh?\" he said, eying Tom and Sam shrewdly.  \"We have, and we must thank you for rescuing us,\" replied Tom.  \"That's all right.\"  \"One of your sailors tells me you are bound for Australia,\" put in Sam.  \"He told you the truth.\"  \"Won't you stop at some port in the Hawaiian Islands?\"  \"No.\"  \"But you might put us off.\"  \"Can't spare the time. As it is, this storm blew me away out of my course,\" answered Captain Blossom.  He had a twofold reason for not putting them ashore at or near Honolulu. It would not only take time, but it might also lead to questioning concerning the fate of the steamer, and he was afraid he would be hauled into some marine court for running into the Tacoma, for that was what he had done.  \"Do you know anything about the steamer?\" asked Sam.  \"No, she got away from us in the darkness, after we hauled seven of you aboard.\"  \"The steamer lost some of her crew,\" said Tom, shuddering. \"Did you lose any men?\"  \"One sailor, and one of my passengers got hurt in the leg by the collision.\"  By this time Dick joined the party, followed by old Jerry and the three girls.  \"Will the captain carry us away to Australia?\" asked Dora, when the situation was explained.  \"I suppose so,\" said Dick soberly. \"If I had some money I might buy him off, but I haven't a dollar. What little I did have I left on board of the Tacoma.\"  The others were equally destitute, and when Captain Blossom heard of this his face grew dark. He was a close man, and his first mate, Jack Lesher, was no better.  \"If you haven't any money, you'll have to work your passage,\" he growled. \"I can't afford to carry you to Australia for nothing.\"  \"Then let us off at some port in the Hawaiian Islands,\" said Tom.  \"Can't do it, I told you,\" retorted Captain Blossom angrily. \"And you'll either work while you are on board or starve.\"  \"My, what a Tarter!\" whispered Sam.  \"Well, we'll work,\" said Dick. \"But you must not force the young ladies to do anything.\"  \"I'm a sailor and will do my full share,\" said old Jerry. But he did not like the situation any better than did the Rovers.  The matter was talked over, and seeing that they were willing to work, Captain Blossom became a little milder in his manner. He said he would give the three girls one of the staterooms, but the boys and old Jerry would have to join the crew in the forecastle.  Fortunately the sailors on board the _Golden Wave_ were a fairly clean lot, so the forecastle was not so dirty a place as it might otherwise have been. The boys did not like to be separated from the girls, however, and Dick called the girls aside to talk the matter over.  \"I want to know if anything goes wrong,\" said he. \"If there is the least thing out of the way, let us know at once,\" and the girls promised to keep their eyes open.  Once in the forecastle the boys were given three rough suits of clothes to wear while working. Then they were called out to work without delay, for the storm had left much to do on board the Golden Wave.  \"We have only one passenger,\" said one of the sailors, in reply to a question from Tom.. \"He is a young fellow named Robert Brown. He was hurt during the storm, but I reckon he's all right now.\"  Tom was set to coiling some rope and Sam and Dick had to scrub down the deck. This was by no means an agreeable task, but nobody complained.  \"We must take what comes,\" said Dick cheerfully. \"So long as we get enough to eat and are not abused I shan't say a word.\"  The boys had been to work about an hour when Sam saw a young fellow limping around the other end of the deck. There was something strangely familiar about the party, and the youngest Rover drew closer to get a better look at him.  \"Dan Baxter!\" he cried in astonishment. \"Dan Baxter!\"  At this cry the person turned and his lower jaw dropped in equal astonishment.  \"Who--er--where did you come from?\" he stammered.  \"So this is the vessel you shipped on?\" went on Sam. And then he called out: \"Dick! Tom! Come here.\"  For a brief instant Dan Baxter's face was a study. Then a crafty look came into his eyes and he drew himself up.  \"Excuse me, but you have made a mistake in your man,\" he said coldly.  \"What's that?\" came from Sam in bewilderment.  \"I am not the party you just named. My name is Robert Brown.\"  \"It is?\" came from the youngest Rover. \"If that is so, you look exactly like somebody I know well.\"  By this time Dick and Tom came hurrying to the spot, followed by Dora, who happened to be on deck.  \"Dan Baxter!\" came from Tom and Dick simultaneously.  \"He says he isn't Dan Baxter,\" said Sam.  \"Isn't Dan Baxter? Why, Baxter, you fraud, what new wrinkle is this?\" said Dick, catching him by the arm.  \"Let go of me!\" came fiercely from Baxter. \"Let go, I say, or it will be the worse for you. You have made a mistake.\"  \"No mistake about it,\" put in Tom. \"He is Dan Baxter beyond a doubt.\"     CHAPTER IX  IN WHICH THE ENEMY IS CORNERED   The loud talking had attracted the attention of Captain Blossom, and now the master of the _Golden Wave_ strode up to the crowd.  \"What's going on here?\" he demanded of the Rover boys. \"Why are you not at work, as I ordered?\"  \"I have made an important discovery,\" answered Dick. \"Is this your passenger, Captain Blossom?\"  \"He is. What of him?\"  \"He is a thief and ran away from San Francisco to escape the police.\"  \"It's a falsehood!\" roared Dan Baxter. \"They have made a mistake. I am a respectable man just out of college, and my father, Doctor L. Z. Brown, is a well-known physician of Los Angeles. I am traveling to Australia for my health.\"  \"His real name is Daniel Baxter and his father is now in prison,\" said Tom. \"He robbed us of our money and some diamonds while we were stopping at a hotel in San Francisco. The detectives followed him up, but he slipped them by taking passage on your ship.\"  \"I tell you my name is Brown--Robert Brown!\" stormed Baxter. \"This is some plot hatched up against me. Who are these fellows, anyway?\" he went on, turning to the captain.  \"They came from the steamer we ran into,\" answered Captain Blossom.  \"I never saw them before.\"  At this moment Dora touched the captain on the shoulder.  \"Please, captain,\" she said, \"I knew Dan Baxter quite well and I am sure this young man is the same person.\"  \"It aint so. I tell you, captain, it is a plot.\"  \"What kind of a plot could it be?\" asked Captain Blossom. He scarcely knew what to say.  \"I don't know. Perhaps they want to get hold of my money,\" went on Baxter, struck by a sudden idea.  \"That's right, we do want to get hold of the money!\" cried Sam. \"For it belongs to us--at least two hundred and seventy-five dollars of it--not counting what he may have got on the diamonds and the cuff buttons.\"  \"You shan't touch my money!\" screamed Baxter.  \"Captain, he ought to be placed under arrest,\" said Dick.  Dora had gone back to the cabin and now she returned in great haste with Nellie and Grace.  \"To be sure, that is Dan Baxter,\" said Nellie.  \"There can be no mistake,\" put in Grace, \"We all know him only too well.\"  \"You see, Captain Blossom, that we are six to one,\" said Tom. \"And you will surely believe the ladies.\"  \"How is you all happen to know him so well?\" demanded the captain curiously.  \"We know him because we all went to school together,\" answered Dick. \"These young ladies lived in the vicinity of the school. We had trouble with Baxter at school and later on out West, and ever since that time he has been trying to injure us. We met him in San Francisco in the hotel lobby and at night he went to our room, cut open a traveling bag and unlocked our trunks and robbed us of two hundred and seventy-five dollars in cash, some diamond studs, a pair of cuff buttons, and some clothing.\"  \"I've got an idea!\" almost shouted Sam. \"Maybe he has some of the stolen stuff in his stateroom.\"  \"Yes, yes, let us search the stateroom: by all means!\" exclaimed Tom.  \"You shall not touch my room!\" howled Baxter, turning pale. \"I have nothing there but my own private property.\"  \"If that is so, you shouldn't object to having the stateroom searched,\" observed Captain Blossom.  \"If we get back our money we may be able to pay you something, captain, for our passage,\" said Dick.  This was a forceful argument and set Captain Blossom to thinking. He was a man who loved money dearly.  \"I will go along and we will look around the stateroom,\" he said, after a pause.  \"This is an outrage!\" cried Dan Baxter. \"I will have the law on you for it.\"  \"Shut up! I am master on my own ship,\" retorted Captain Blossom, and led the way to the stateroom Dan Baxter occupied. The door was locked and Baxter refused to give up the key. But the captain had a duplicate, and soon he and the Rover boys were inside the room. Baxter followed them, still expostulating, but in vain.  \"Here is a pocketbook full of bills!\" cried Tom, bringing the article to light.  \"Here is my light overcoat!\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16476"],["title","The Rover Boys on Land and Sea: The Crusoes of Seven Islands (#8)"],["body","from Dick. \"See, it has my initials embroidered in the hanger. Aunt Martha did that for me.\"  \"Here are my gold cuff buttons!\" exclaimed Sam. \"They were a present from my father and they have my monogram engraved on each.\" And he showed the articles to the captain.  \"I reckon it's a pretty clear case against you,\" said Captain Blossom, turning to Dan Baxter.  \"Here are half a dozen letters,\" said Tom, holding them up. \"You can see they are all addressed to Daniel Baxter. That's his name, and he'd be a fool to deny it any longer.\"  \"Well, I won't deny it,\" cried the big bully. \"What would be the use--you are all against me--even the captain.\"  \"I am not against you,\" retorted Captain Blossom. \"But if you are a thief I want to know it. Why did you give me your name as Robert Brown?\"  \"That's my business.\" Baxter paused for a moment. \"Now you have found me out, what are you going to do about it?\" he went on brazenly. \"You can't arrest me on shipboard.\"  \"No, but we can have you arrested when we land,\" said Dick. \"And in the meantime we will take charge of what is our own.\"  \"Here are some pawn tickets for the diamonds,\" said Sam, who was continuing the search. \"They show he got seventy-five dollars on them.\"  \"We will keep the tickets--and the seventy-five dollars, too--if we can find the money,\" said Tom.  But the money could not be found, for the greater part had been turned over to Captain Blossom for Baxter's passage to Australia and the rest spent before leaving shore. The pocketbook contained only two hundred and thirty dollars.  \"What did he pay you for the passage?\" questioned Dick of the captain.  \"One hundred dollars.\"  \"Then you ought to turn that amount over to our credit.\"  \"Why, what do you mean?\"  \"I mean that Dan Baxter has no right to a free passage on your ship, since he bought that passage with our money. Let him work his way and place that passage money to our credit.\"  \"That's the way to talk,\" put in Tom. \"Make him work by all means.\"  \"He deserves good, hard labor,\" came from Sam.  \"I don't think you can make me work!\" burst out Dan Baxter. \"I am a passenger and I demand that I be treated as such.\"  \"You are an impostor!\" returned Captain Blossom bluntly. \"The fact that you used an assumed name proves it. If I wanted to do so, I could clap you in the ship's brig until we reach port and chain you into the bargain. I want no thieves on board my ship.\"  \"Here is more of our clothing,\" came from Tom.  \"Pick out all the things that are yours,\" said the captain. \"And take the other things that are yours, too.\"  This was done, nobody paying any attention to Baxter's protests. When the Rovers had what there was of their things the captain turned to the bully.  \"I've made up my mind about you,\" he said, speaking with great deliberation. \"I am master here, and a judge and jury into the bargain. You can take your choice: Either sign articles as a foremast hand for the balance of the trip, or be locked up as a prisoner, on prison rations.\"  \"Do you mean th--that?\" gasped Baxter, turning pale.  \"I do.\"  \"But the passage money Goes to the credit of these young fellows.\"  \"It's an outrage!\"  \"No, it's simply justice, to my way of thinking. I'll give you until to-morrow to make up your mind what you will do.\"  This ended the talk with Dan Baxter. The captain said he wanted to see the Rover boys in the cabin, and they followed him to that place.  \"Captain, I feel I must thank you for your fair way of managing this affair,\" said Dick, feeling that a few good words at this point would not go amiss. \"I hope you treat Baxter as he deserves.\"  \"I will try to do right,\" was Captain Blossom's answer. \"But what I want to know now is, What do you intend to do with that money? It seems to me I should be paid something for keeping you on board.\"  \"I have a proposition to make, captain. We will give you two hundred dollars if you will allow us to consider ourselves passengers. And by 'us' I mean the young ladies as well as ourselves.\"  \"It's not very much.\"  \"If we pay you that amount it will leave us but thirty dollars, hardly enough with which to cable home for more. Of course, when we get our money in Australia we will pay you whatever balance is due you,--and something besides for saving us.\"  This pleased Captain Blossom and he said he would accept the offer. The matter was discussed for half an hour, and it was decided that the boys should have two staterooms, the one occupied by Baxter and another next to that given over to the girls.  When Dora, Nellie, and Grace heard of the new arrangement that had been made they were highly pleased.  \"I didn't want to see you do the work of a common sailor,\" said Dora to Dick.  \"Oh, it wouldn't kill me,\" he returned lightly. \"Even as it is, I'll give a hand if it is necessary.\"  \"It's a wonder Captain Blossom took to your offer so quickly.\"  \"He loves money, that's why, Dora. He would rather have that two hundred dollars than our services,\" and with this remark Dick hit the nail squarely on the head.     CHAPTER X  A BLOW IN THE DARKNESS   It would be hard to describe Dan Baxter's feelings after Captain Blossom and the Rover boys left him alone in his stateroom. At one instant he was fairly shaking with rage, and at the next quaking with fear over what the future might hold in store for him.  \"They have got the best of me again!\" he muttered, clenching his fists. \"And after I felt sure I had escaped them. It must have been Fate that made Captain Blossom pick them up. Now I've either got to work as a common sailor or submit to being locked up in some dark, foul-smelling hole on the ship. And when we get to Australia, unless I watch my chance to skip out, they'll turn me over to the police.\"  He could not sleep that night for thinking over the situation and was up and dressed before daylight. Strolling on deck, he came face to face with Sam, who had come up to get the morning air.  \"I suppose you think you have got the best of me,\" growled Baxter.  \"It looks like it, doesn't it?\" returned Sam briefly.  \"The game isn't ended yet.\"  \"No, but it will be when you land in prison, Baxter.\"  \"I'll get square.\"  \"You have promised to get square times without number--and you have failed every time.\"  \"I won't fail the next time.\"  \"Yes, you will. Wrong never yet triumphed over right.\"  \"Oh, don't preach, Sam Rover.\"  \"I am not preaching, I am simply trying to show you how foolish it is to do wrong. Why don't you turn over a new leaf?\"  \"Oh, such talk makes me sick!\" growled the bully, and turned away.  A little while later Captain Blossom appeared and hunted up Dan Baxter, who sat in his state-room, packing up his few belongings.  \"Well, have you decided on your course, young man?\" demanded the master of the _Golden Wave_.  \"Do you mean to lock me up if I refuse to become a sailor?\" asked Dan Baxter,  \"I do, and I won't argue with you, either. Is it yes or no?\"  \"I don't want to be locked up in some dark hole on your ship.\"  \"Then you are willing to become a sailor?\"  \"I--er--I suppose so.\"  \"Very well, you can remove your things to the forecastle. Jack Lesher, the first mate, will give you your bunk.\"  This was \"adding insult to injury,\" as it is termed, so far as Baxter was concerned, for it will be remembered that it was Jack Lesher who had obtained the passage on the _Golden Wave_ for the bully.  But Dan Baxter was given no chance to demur. Taking his traps he went on deck, where Jack Lesher met him, grinning in sickly fashion.  \"So you are going to make a change, eh?\" said the mate.  \"You needn't laugh at me, if I am,\" growled Baxter.  \"I shan't laugh, my boy. It's hard luck,\" said Lesher. \"Come along.\"  He led the way to the forecastle and gave Baxter a bunk next to that occupied by old Jerry. Then he brought out an old suit of sailor's clothing and tossed it over.  \"You've run in hard luck, boy,\" he said in a low voice, after he had made certain that nobody else was within hearing. \"I am sorry for you.\"  \"Really?\" queried Dan Baxter, giving the mate a sharp look.  \"Yes, I am, and if I can do anything to make it easy for you, count on me,\" went on Jack Lesher.  \"Thank you.\"  \"I suppose taking that money and the other things was more of boy's sport than anything, eh?\"  \"That's the truth. I wanted to get square with those Rover boys. They are my bitter enemies. I didn't want the money.\"  Just then old Jerry came in and the conversation came to an end. But Baxter felt that he had a friend on board and this eased him a little. He did not know that the reason Jack Lesher liked him was because the first mate was a criminal himself and had once served a term in a Michigan jail for knocking down a passenger on a boat and robbing him of his pocketbook. As the old saying goes, \"Birds of a feather flock together.\"  When the girls came on deck they found Baxter doing some of the work which Dick and Tom had been doing the morning before. At first they were inclined to laugh, but Dora stopped herself and her cousins.  \"Don't let us laugh at him,\" she whispered. \"It is hard enough for the poor fellow as it is.\"  \"I am not going to notice him after this,\" said Nellie. \"To me he shall be an entire stranger.\" And the others agreed to treat Dan Baxter in the same manner.  But the boys were not so considerate, and Tom laughed outright when he caught sight of Baxter swabbing up some dirt on the rear deck. This made the bully's passion arise on the instant and he caught up his bucket as if to throw it at Tom's head.  \"Don't you dare, Baxter!\" cried Tom. \"If you do we'll have a red-hot war.\"  \"I can lick you, Tom Rover!\"  \"Perhaps you can and perhaps you can't.\"  Baxter put up his fists, but on the approach of Dick and Sam he promptly retreated. But before he went he hissed in Tom's ear:  \"You wait, and see what I do!\"  \"He had better keep his distance,\" said Dick. \"If he doesn't, somebody will get hurt.\"  \"I suppose it galls him to work,\" said Sam. \"He always was rather lazy.\"  The day proved a"]]]
