Dickens rang far more changes on the bells than there is space to enumerate; but I have shown to what extent he makes their sound a commentary on innumerable phases of life. A slight technical knowledge of bell phraseology is found in _Barnaby Rudge_ (7), where he mentions the variations known as a 'triple bob major.' Finally there is an interesting reference in _Master Humphrey's Clock_ to a use of the bell which has now passed into history. Belinda says in a postscript to a letter to Master Humphrey, 'The bellman, rendered impatient by delay, is ringing dreadfully in the passage'; while in a second PS. she says, 'I open this to say the bellman is gone, and that you must not expect it till the next post.'  In the old days it was the custom for the letter-carriers to collect letters by ringing a bell.  There is no doubt that a most extraordinary, certainly a most original, musical effect is that secured by Mr. George (_B.H._), who had just finished smoking.      'Do you know what that tune is, Mr. Smallweed?' he adds,     after breaking off to whistle one, accompanied on the     table with the empty pipe.      'Tune,' replies the old man. 'No, we never have     tunes here.'      'That's the \"Dead March\" in _Saul_. They bury soldiers     to it, so it's the natural end of the subject.'  Surely a highly original way of bringing a conversation to a close!  This march is referred to in _Our Mutual Friend_, where Mr. Wilfer suggests that going through life with Mrs. Wilfer is like keeping time to the 'Dead March' in _Saul_, from which singular simile we may gather that this lady was not the liveliest of companions.  Several other instruments are casually mentioned. Mr. Hardy (_S.B.T._ 7) was a master of many accomplishments.      He could sing comic songs, imitate hackney coachmen     and fowls, play airs on his chin, and execute concertos     on the Jew's harp.  The champion 'chin' performer of the early Victorian period was Michael Boai, 'The celebrated chin melodist,' who was announced to perform 'some of his admired pieces' at many of the places of entertainment. There is another reference to this extraordinary way of producing music in _Sketches by Boz_, where Mrs. Tippin performed an air with variations on the guitar, 'accompanied on the chin by Master Tippin.' To return to Mr. Hardy, this gentleman was evidently deeply interested in all sorts and degrees of music, but he got out of his depth in a conversation with the much-travelled Captain Helves. After the three Miss Briggses had finished their guitar performances, Mr. Hardy approached the Captain with the question, 'Did you ever hear a Portuguese tambourine?'      'Did _you_ ever hear a tom-tom, sir?' sternly inquired     the Captain, who lost no opportunity of showing off     his travels, real or pretended.      'A what?' asked Hardy, rather taken aback.      'A tom-tom.'      'Never.'      'Nor a gum-gum?'      'Never.'      'What _is_ a gum-gum?' eagerly inquired several     young ladies.  The question is unanswered to this day, though Hardy afterwards suggests it is another name for a humbug.  When Dickens visited the school where the half-time system was in force, he found the boys undergoing military and naval drill. A small boy played the fife while the others went through their exercises. After that a boys' band appeared, the youngsters being dressed in a neat uniform. Then came a choral class, who sang 'the praises of a summer's day to a harmonium.' In the arithmetical exercises the small piper excels (_U.T._ 29).      Wise as the serpent is the four feet of performer on     the nearest approach to that instrument.  This was written when the serpent was practically extinct, but Dickens would be very familiar with the name of the instrument, and may have seen and heard it in churches in his younger days.  In referring to another boy's attempt at solving the arithmetical puzzles, he mentions the cymbals, combined with a faint memory of St. Paul.      I observe the player of the cymbals to dash at a     sounding answer now and then rather than not cut in at     all; but I take that to be in the way of his instrument.  In _Great Expectations_ Mr. Wopsle, who is a parish clerk by profession, had an ambition not only to tread the boards, but to start off as Hamlet. His appearance was not a success, and the audience was derisive.      On his taking the recorders--very like a little black     flute that had just been played in the orchestra and     handed out at the door--he was called upon unanimously     for 'Rule Britannia.'  Reference has already been made to Bucket's music-shop, so we must not forget to visit Caleb Plummer's little room, where there were      scores of melancholy little carts which, when the     wheels went round, performed most doleful music. Many     small fiddles, drums, and other instruments of torture.  The old man made a rude kind of harp specially for his poor blind daughter, and on which Dot used to play when she visited the toy-maker's. Caleb's musical contribution would be 'a Bacchanalian song, something about a sparkling bowl,' which much annoyed his grumpy employer.      'What! you're singing, are you?' said Tackleton, putting     his head in at the door. 'Go it, _I_ can't sing.'      Nobody would have suspected him of it. He hadn't what     is generally termed a singing face, by any means.  The wonderful duet between the cricket and the kettle at the commencement of _The Cricket on the Hearth_ certainly deserves mention, though it is rather difficult to know whether to class the performers as instrumentalists or singers. The kettle began it with a series of short vocal snorts, which at first it checked in the bud, but finally it burst into a stream of song, 'while the lid performed a sort of jig, and clattered like a deaf and dumb cymbal that had never known the use of its twin brother.' Then the cricket came in with its chirp, chirp, chirp, and at it they went in fierce rivalry until 'the kettle, being dead beat, boiled over, and was taken off the fire.'  Dickens was certainly partial to the cricket, for elsewhere (_M.H.C._) we read of the clock that      makes cheerful music, like one of those chirping     insects who delight in the warm hearth.  There are two or three references to the key bugle, which also used to be known as the Kent bugle. It was a popular instrument half a century ago, as the addition of keys gave it a much greater range of notes than the ordinary bugle possessed. A notable though inefficient performer was the driver who took Martin Chuzzlewit up to London.      He was musical, besides, and had a little key bugle in     his pocket on which, whenever the conversation flagged,     he played the first part of a great many tunes, and     regularly broke down in the second.  This instrument was on Mr. Feeder's _agenda_.  Two more instruments demand our attention. At the marriage of Tackleton and May Fielding (_C.H._) there were to be marrow-bones and cleavers, while to celebrate the union of Trotty Veck's daughter Meg and Richard they had a band including the aforesaid instruments and also the drum and the bells. It was formerly the custom for butchers' assistants to provide themselves with marrow-bones and cleavers for musical effects. Each cleaver was ground so that when it was struck with the bone it emitted a certain note.[12] A complete band would consist of eight men, with their cleavers so tuned as to give an octave of notes. After more or less practice they would offer their services as bandsmen on the occasion of marriage ceremonies, which they had a wonderful faculty for locating, and they would provide music (of a kind) _ad libitum_ until the requisite fee was forthcoming. If their services were declined the butchers would turn up all the same, and make things very unpleasant for the marriage party. The custom dates from the eighteenth century, and though it has gradually fallen into disuse a marrow-bone and cleaver band is still available in London for those who want it. A band took part in a wedding ceremony at Clapham as recently as the autumn of 1911.  The following extract, referring to the second marriage of Mr. Dombey, shows what bridal parties had to put up with in the good old days:      The men who play the bells have got scent of the     marriage; and the marrow-bones and cleavers too;     and a brass band too. The first are practising in     a back settlement near Battle-bridge[13]; the second     put themselves in communication, through their chief,     with Mr. Tomlinson, to whom they offer terms to be     bought off; and the third, in the person of an artful     trombone, lurks and dodges round the corner, waiting     for some traitor-tradesman to reveal the place and     hour of breakfast, for a bribe.  Other instruments casually referred to are the Pan's pipes, which in one place is also called a mouth-organ (_S.B.S._ 20), the flageolet, and the triangle. It is difficult to classify the walking-stick on which Mr. Jennings Rudolph played tunes before he went behind the parlour door and gave his celebrated imitations of actors, edgetools, and animals (_S.B.C._ 8).   [11] Forster, _Life of Charles Dickens._  [12] This is rather a modern development.  [13] Near King's Cross Station (G.N.R.).     CHAPTER V  CHURCH MUSIC   Dickens has not much to say about church music as such, but the references are interesting, inasmuch as they throw some light upon it during the earlier years of his life. In _Our Parish_ (_S.B._) we read about the old naval officer who      finds fault with the sermon every Sunday, says that the     organist ought to be ashamed of himself, and offers to     back himself for any amount to sing the psalms better     than all the children put together.
