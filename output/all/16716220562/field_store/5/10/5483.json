My grace to thee is plenteous, it cannot be veiled. My love has made in thee its home, it cannot be concealed. My light is manifest to thee, it cannot be obscured.    “21: O SON OF MAN! Upon the tree of effulgent glory I have hung for...”   O SON OF MAN! Upon the tree of effulgent glory I have hung for thee the choicest fruits, wherefore hast thou turned away and contented thyself with that which is less good? Return then unto that which is better for thee in the realm on high.    “22: O SON OF SPIRIT! Noble have I created thee, yet thou hast abased...”   O SON OF SPIRIT! Noble have I created thee, yet thou hast abased thyself. Rise then unto that for which thou wast created.    “23: O SON OF THE SUPREME! To the eternal I call thee, yet thou dost seek that...”   O SON OF THE SUPREME! To the eternal I call thee, yet thou dost seek that which perisheth. What hath made thee turn away from Our desire and seek thine own?    “24: O SON OF MAN! Transgress not thy limits, nor claim that which...”   O SON OF MAN! Transgress not thy limits, nor claim that which beseemeth thee not. Prostrate thyself before the countenance of thy God, the Lord of might and power.    “25: O SON OF SPIRIT! Vaunt not thyself over the poor, for I lead him on...”   O SON OF SPIRIT! Vaunt not thyself over the poor, for I lead him on his way and behold thee in thy evil plight and confound thee for evermore.    “26: O SON OF BEING! How couldst thou forget thine own faults and...”   O SON OF BEING! How couldst thou forget thine own faults and busy thyself with the faults of others? Whoso doeth this is accursed of Me.    “27: O SON OF MAN! Breathe not the sins of others so long as thou art...”   O SON OF MAN! Breathe not the sins of others so long as thou art thyself a sinner. Shouldst thou transgress this command, accursed wouldst thou be, and to this I bear witness.    “28: O SON OF SPIRIT! Know thou of a truth: He that biddeth men be just...”   O SON OF SPIRIT! Know thou of a truth: He that biddeth men be just and himself committeth iniquity is not of Me, even though he bear My name.    “29: O SON OF BEING! Ascribe not to any soul that which thou wouldst...”   O SON OF BEING! Ascribe not to any soul that which thou wouldst not have ascribed to thee, and say not that which thou doest not. This is My command unto thee, do thou observe it.    “30: O SON OF MAN! Deny not My servant should he ask anything from...”   O SON OF MAN! Deny not My servant should he ask anything from thee, for his face is My face; be then abashed before Me.    “31: O SON OF BEING! Bring thyself to account each day ere thou art...”   O SON OF BEING! Bring thyself to account each day ere thou art summoned to a reckoning; for death, unheralded, shall come upon thee and thou shalt be called to give account for thy deeds.    “32: O SON OF THE SUPREME! I have made death a messenger of joy to thee....”   O SON OF THE SUPREME! I have made death a messenger of joy to thee. Wherefore dost thou grieve? I made the light to shed on thee its splendor. Why dost thou veil thyself therefrom?    “33: O SON OF SPIRIT! With the joyful tidings of light I hail thee: rejoice!...”   O SON OF SPIRIT! With the joyful tidings of light I hail thee: rejoice! To the court of holiness I summon thee; abide therein that thou mayest live in peace for evermore.    “34: O SON OF SPIRIT! The spirit of holiness beareth unto thee the joyful...”   O SON OF SPIRIT! The spirit of holiness beareth unto thee the joyful tidings of reunion; wherefore dost thou grieve? The spirit of power confirmeth thee in His cause; why dost thou veil thyself? The light of His countenance doth lead thee; how canst thou go astray?    “35: O SON OF MAN! Sorrow not save that thou art far from Us. Rejoice...”   O SON OF MAN! Sorrow not save that thou art far from Us. Rejoice not save that thou art drawing near and returning unto Us.    “36: O SON OF MAN! Rejoice in the gladness of thine heart, that thou...”   O SON OF MAN! Rejoice in the gladness of thine heart, that thou mayest be worthy to meet Me and to mirror forth My beauty.    “37: O SON OF MAN! Divest not thyself of My beauteous robe, and forfeit...”   O SON OF MAN! Divest not thyself of My beauteous robe, and forfeit not thy portion from My wondrous fountain, lest thou shouldst thirst for evermore.    “38: O SON OF BEING! Walk in My statutes for love of Me and deny thyself...”   O SON OF BEING! Walk in My statutes for love of Me and deny thyself that which thou desirest if thou seekest My pleasure.    “39: O SON OF MAN! Neglect not My commandments if thou lovest My...”   O SON OF MAN! Neglect not My commandments if thou lovest My beauty, and forget not My counsels if thou wouldst attain My good pleasure.    “40: O SON OF MAN! Wert thou to speed through the immensity of...”   O SON OF MAN! Wert thou to speed through the immensity of space and traverse the expanse of heaven, yet thou wouldst find no rest save in submission to Our command and humbleness before Our Face.    “41: O SON OF MAN! Magnify My cause that I may reveal unto thee the...”   O SON OF MAN! Magnify My cause that I may reveal unto thee the mysteries of My greatness and shine upon thee with the light of eternity.    “42: O SON OF MAN! Humble thyself before Me, that I may graciously...”   O SON OF MAN! Humble thyself before Me, that I may graciously visit thee. Arise for the triumph of My cause, that while yet on earth thou mayest obtain the victory.    “43: O SON OF BEING! Make mention of Me on My earth, that in My...”   O SON OF BEING! Make mention of Me on My earth, that in My heaven I may remember thee, thus shall Mine eyes and thine be solaced.    “44: O SON OF THE THRONE! Thy hearing is My hearing, hear thou therewith....”   O SON OF THE THRONE! Thy hearing is My hearing, hear thou therewith. Thy sight is My sight, do thou see therewith, that in thine inmost soul thou mayest testify unto My exalted sanctity, and I within Myself may bear witness unto an exalted station for thee.    “45: O SON OF BEING! Seek a martyr’s death in My path, content with...”   O SON OF BEING! Seek a martyr’s death in My path, content with My pleasure and thankful for that which I ordain, that thou mayest repose with Me beneath the canopy of majesty behind the tabernacle of glory.    “46: O SON OF MAN! Ponder and reflect. Is it thy wish to die upon thy...”   O SON OF MAN! Ponder and reflect. Is it thy wish to die upon thy bed, or to shed thy life-blood on the dust, a martyr in My path, and so become the manifestation of My command and the revealer of My light in the highest paradise? Judge thou aright, O servant!    “47: O SON OF MAN! By My beauty! To tinge thy hair with thy blood...”   O SON OF MAN! By My beauty! To tinge thy hair with thy blood is greater in My sight than the creation of the universe and the light of both worlds. Strive then to attain this, O servant!    “48: O SON OF MAN! For everything there is a sign. The sign of love...”   O SON OF MAN! For everything there is a sign. The sign of love is fortitude under My decree and patience under My trials.    “49: O SON OF MAN! The true lover yearneth for tribulation even as...”   O SON OF MAN! The true lover yearneth for tribulation even as doth the rebel for forgiveness and the sinful for mercy.    “50: O SON OF MAN! If adversity befall thee not in My path, how...”   O SON OF MAN! If adversity befall thee not in My path, how canst thou walk in the ways of them that are content with My pleasure? If trials afflict thee not in thy longing to meet Me, how wilt thou attain the light in thy love for My beauty?    “51: O SON OF MAN! My calamity is My providence, outwardly it is...”   O SON OF MAN! My calamity is My providence, outwardly it is fire and vengeance, but inwardly it is light and mercy. Hasten thereunto that thou mayest become an eternal light and an immortal spirit. This is My command unto thee, do thou observe it.    “52: O SON OF MAN! Should prosperity befall thee, rejoice not, and...”   O SON OF MAN! Should prosperity befall thee, rejoice not, and should abasement come upon thee, grieve not, for both shall pass away and be no more.    “53: O SON OF BEING! If poverty overtake thee, be not sad; for in...”   O SON OF BEING! If poverty overtake thee, be not sad; for in time the Lord of wealth shall visit thee. Fear not abasement, for glory shall one day rest on thee.    “54: O SON OF BEING! If thine heart be set upon this eternal, imperishable...”   O SON OF BEING! If thine heart be set upon this eternal, imperishable dominion, and this ancient, everlasting life, forsake this mortal and fleeting sovereignty.    “55: O SON OF BEING! Busy not thyself with this world, for with fire We...”   O SON OF BEING! Busy not thyself with this world, for with fire We test the gold, and with gold We test Our servants.    “56: O SON OF MAN! Thou dost wish for gold and I desire thy freedom...”   O SON OF MAN! Thou dost wish for gold and I desire thy freedom from it. Thou thinkest thyself rich in its possession, and I recognize thy wealth in thy sanctity therefrom. By My life! This is My knowledge, and that is thy fancy; how can My way accord with thine?    “57: O SON OF MAN! Bestow My wealth upon My poor, that in heaven...”   O SON OF MAN! Bestow My wealth upon My poor, that in heaven thou mayest draw from stores of unfading splendor and treasures of imperishable glory. But by My life! To offer up thy soul is a more glorious thing couldst thou but see with Mine eye.    “58: O SON OF MAN! The temple of being is My throne; cleanse it of...”   O SON OF MAN! The temple of being is My throne; cleanse it of all things, that there I may be established and there I may abide.    “59: O SON OF BEING! Thy heart is My home; sanctify it for My descent....”   O SON OF BEING! Thy heart is My home; sanctify it for My descent. Thy spirit is My place of revelation; cleanse it for My manifestation.    “60: O SON OF MAN! Put thy hand into My"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16941"],["title","The Hidden Words of Bahá'u'lláh (#3)"],["body","m, that I may rise above...”   O SON OF MAN! Put thy hand into My bosom, that I may rise above thee, radiant and resplendent.    “61: O SON OF MAN! Ascend unto My heaven, that thou mayest obtain...”   O SON OF MAN! Ascend unto My heaven, that thou mayest obtain the joy of reunion, and from the chalice of imperishable glory quaff the peerless wine.    “62: O SON OF MAN! Many a day hath passed over thee whilst thou...”   O SON OF MAN! Many a day hath passed over thee whilst thou hast busied thyself with thy fancies and idle imaginings. How long art thou to slumber on thy bed? Lift up thy head from slumber, for the Sun hath risen to the zenith, haply it may shine upon thee with the light of beauty.    “63: O SON OF MAN! The light hath shone on thee from the horizon of...”   O SON OF MAN! The light hath shone on thee from the horizon of the sacred Mount and the spirit of enlightenment hath breathed in the Sinai of thy heart. Wherefore, free thyself from the veils of idle fancies and enter into My court, that thou mayest be fit for everlasting life and worthy to meet Me. Thus may death not come upon thee, neither weariness nor trouble.    “64: O SON OF MAN! My eternity is My creation, I have created it for...”   O SON OF MAN! My eternity is My creation, I have created it for thee. Make it the garment of thy temple. My unity is My handiwork; I have wrought it for thee; clothe thyself therewith, that thou mayest be to all eternity the revelation of My everlasting being.    “65: O SON OF MAN! My majesty is My gift to thee, and My grandeur...”   O SON OF MAN! My majesty is My gift to thee, and My grandeur the token of My mercy unto thee. That which beseemeth Me none shall understand, nor can anyone recount. Verily, I have preserved it in My hidden storehouses and in the treasuries of My command, as a sign of My loving-kindness unto My servants and My mercy unto My people.    “66: O CHILDREN OF THE DIVINE AND INVISIBLE ESSENCE!...”   O CHILDREN OF THE DIVINE AND INVISIBLE ESSENCE! Ye shall be hindered from loving Me and souls shall be perturbed as they make mention of Me. For minds cannot grasp Me nor hearts contain Me.    “67: O SON OF BEAUTY! By My spirit and by My favor! By My mercy and...”   O SON OF BEAUTY! By My spirit and by My favor! By My mercy and by My beauty! All that I have revealed unto thee with the tongue of power, and have written for thee with the pen of might, hath been in accordance with thy capacity and understanding, not with My state and the melody of My voice.    “68: O CHILDREN OF MEN! Know ye not why We created you all from the...”   O CHILDREN OF MEN! Know ye not why We created you all from the same dust? That no one should exalt himself over the other. Ponder at all times in your hearts how ye were created. Since We have created you all from one same substance it is incumbent on you to be even as one soul, to walk with the same feet, eat with the same mouth and dwell in the same land, that from your inmost being, by your deeds and actions, the signs of oneness and the essence of detachment may be made manifest. Such is My counsel to you, O concourse of light! Heed ye this counsel that ye may obtain the fruit of holiness from the tree of wondrous glory.    “69: O YE SONS OF SPIRIT! Ye are My treasury, for in you I have treasured the...”   O YE SONS OF SPIRIT! Ye are My treasury, for in you I have treasured the pearls of My mysteries and the gems of My knowledge. Guard them from the strangers amidst My servants and from the ungodly amongst My people.    “70: O SON OF HIM THAT STOOD BY HIS OWN ENTITY IN THE KINGDOM OF HIS SELF!...”   O SON OF HIM THAT STOOD BY HIS OWN ENTITY IN THE KINGDOM OF HIS SELF! Know thou, that I have wafted unto thee all the fragrances of holiness, have fully revealed to thee My word, have perfected through thee My bounty and have desired for thee that which I have desired for My Self. Be then content with My pleasure and thankful unto Me.    “71: O SON OF MAN! Write all that We have revealed unto thee with the...”   O SON OF MAN! Write all that We have revealed unto thee with the ink of light upon the tablet of thy spirit. Should this not be in thy power, then make thine ink of the essence of thy heart. If this thou canst not do, then write with that crimson ink that hath been shed in My path. Sweeter indeed is this to Me than all else, that its light may endure for ever.      PART II—FROM THE PERSIAN     Preamble               In the Name of the Lord of Utterance, The Mighty.    “1: O YE PEOPLE THAT HAVE MINDS TO KNOW AND EARS TO HEAR!...”   O YE PEOPLE THAT HAVE MINDS TO KNOW AND EARS TO HEAR! The first call of the Beloved is this: O mystic nightingale! Abide not but in the rose-garden of the spirit. O messenger of the Solomon of love! Seek thou no shelter except in the Sheba of the well-beloved, and O immortal phoenix! dwell not save on the mount of faithfulness. Therein is thy habitation, if on the wings of thy soul thou soarest to the realm of the infinite and seekest to attain thy goal.    “2: O SON OF SPIRIT! The bird seeketh its nest; the nightingale the...”   O SON OF SPIRIT! The bird seeketh its nest; the nightingale the charm of the rose; whilst those birds, the hearts of men, content with transient dust, have strayed far from their eternal nest, and with eyes turned towards the slough of heedlessness are bereft of the glory of the divine presence. Alas! How strange and pitiful; for a mere cupful, they have turned away from the billowing seas of the Most High, and remained far from the most effulgent horizon.    “3: O FRIEND! In the garden of thy heart plant naught but the...”   O FRIEND! In the garden of thy heart plant naught but the rose of love, and from the nightingale of affection and desire loosen not thy hold. Treasure the companionship of the righteous and eschew all fellowship with the ungodly.    “4: O SON OF JUSTICE! Whither can a lover go but to the land of his...”   O SON OF JUSTICE! Whither can a lover go but to the land of his beloved? and what seeker findeth rest away from his heart’s desire? To the true lover reunion is life, and separation is death. His breast is void of patience and his heart hath no peace. A myriad lives he would forsake to hasten to the abode of his beloved.    “5: O SON OF DUST! Verily I say unto thee: Of all men the most negligent...”   O SON OF DUST! Verily I say unto thee: Of all men the most negligent is he that disputeth idly and seeketh to advance himself over his brother. Say, O brethren! Let deeds, not words, be your adorning.    “6: O SON OF EARTH! Know, verily, the heart wherein the least remnant...”   O SON OF EARTH! Know, verily, the heart wherein the least remnant of envy yet lingers, shall never attain My everlasting dominion, nor inhale the sweet savors of holiness breathing from My kingdom of sanctity.    “7: O SON OF LOVE! Thou art but one step away from the glorious...”   O SON OF LOVE! Thou art but one step away from the glorious heights above and from the celestial tree of love. Take thou one pace and with the next advance into the immortal realm and enter the pavilion of eternity. Give ear then to that which hath been revealed by the pen of glory.    “8: O SON OF GLORY! Be swift in the path of holiness, and enter the...”   O SON OF GLORY! Be swift in the path of holiness, and enter the heaven of communion with Me. Cleanse thy heart with the burnish of the spirit, and hasten to the court of the Most High.    “9: O FLEETING SHADOW! Pass beyond the baser stages of doubt and rise to...”   O FLEETING SHADOW! Pass beyond the baser stages of doubt and rise to the exalted heights of certainty. Open the eye of truth, that thou mayest behold the veilless Beauty and exclaim: Hallowed be the Lord, the most excellent of all creators!    “10: O SON OF DESIRE! Give ear unto this: Never shall mortal eye recognize...”   O SON OF DESIRE! Give ear unto this: Never shall mortal eye recognize the everlasting Beauty, nor the lifeless heart delight in aught but in the withered bloom. For like seeketh like, and taketh pleasure in the company of its kind.    “11: O SON OF DUST! Blind thine eyes, that thou mayest behold My...”   O SON OF DUST! Blind thine eyes, that thou mayest behold My beauty; stop thine ears, that thou mayest hearken unto the sweet melody of My voice; empty thyself of all learning, that thou mayest partake of My knowledge; and sanctify thyself from riches, that thou mayest obtain a lasting share from the ocean of My eternal wealth. Blind thine eyes, that is, to all save My beauty; stop thine ears to all save My word; empty thyself of all learning save the knowledge of Me; that with a clear vision, a pure heart and an attentive ear thou mayest enter the court of My holiness.    “12: O MAN OF TWO VISIONS! Close one eye and open the other. Close one to...”   O MAN OF TWO VISIONS! Close one eye and open the other. Close one to the world and all that is therein, and open the other to the hallowed beauty of the Beloved.    “13: O MY CHILDREN! I fear lest, bereft of the melody of the dove of...”   O MY CHILDREN! I fear lest, bereft of the melody of the dove of heaven, ye will sink back to the shades of utter loss, and, never having gazed upon the beauty of the rose, return to water and clay.    “14: O FRIENDS! Abandon not the everlasting beauty for a beauty...”   O FRIENDS! Abandon not the everlasting beauty for a beauty that must die, and set not your affections on this mortal world of dust.    “15: O SON OF SPIRIT! The time cometh, when the nightingale of holiness...”   O SON OF SPIRIT! The time cometh, when the nightingale of holiness will no longer unfold the inner mysteries and ye will all be bereft of the celestial melody and of the voice from on high.    “16: O ESSENCE OF NEGLIGENCE! Myriads of mystic tongues find utterance in one...”   O ESSENCE OF NEGLIGENCE! Myriads of mystic tongues find utterance in one speech, and myriads of hidden mysteries are revealed in a single melody; yet, alas, there is no"]]]
