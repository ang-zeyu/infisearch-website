Νήνεμος ’Αἰών      I WOULD my days had been in other times,    A moment in the long unnumbered years    That knew the sway of Horus and of hawk,    In peaceful lands that border on the Nile.     I would my days had been in other times,    Lulled by the sacrifice and mumbled hymn    Between the Five great Rivers, or in shade    And shelter of the cool Himâlayan hills.     I would my days had been in other times,    That I in some old abbey of Touraine    Had watched the rounding grapes, and lived my life,    Ere ever Luther came or Rabelais!     I would my days had been in other times,    When quiet life to death not terrible    Drifted, as ashes of the Santhal dead    Drift down the sacred Rivers to the Sea!     ART.   A VERY WOFUL BALLADE OF THE ART CRITIC.                               (TO E. A. ABBEY.)     A SPIRIT came to my sad bed,    And weary sad that night was I,    Who’d tottered, since the dawn was red,    Through miles of Grosvenor Gallery,    Yea, leagues of long Academy    Awaited me when morn grew white,    ’Twas then the Spirit whispered nigh,    “Take up the pen, my friend, and write!     “Of many a portrait grey as lead,    Of many a mustard-coloured sky,    Say much, where little should be said,    Lay on thy censure dexterously,    With microscopic glances pry    At textures, Tadema’s delight,    Praise foreign swells they always sky,    Take up the pen, my friend, and write!”     I answered, “’Tis for daily bread,    A sorry crust, I ween, and dry,    That still, with aching feet and head,    I push this lawful industry,    ’Mid pictures hung or low, or high,    But, touching that which I indite,    Do artists hold me lovingly?    Take up the pen, my friend, and write.”                         _The Spirit writeth in form of_                                     ENVOY.     “They fain would black thy dexter eye,    They hate thee with a bitter spite,    But scribble since thou must, or die,    Take tip the pen, my friend, and write!”    ART’S MARTYR.   Telleth of a young man that fain would be fairly tattooed on his flesh, after the heathen manner, in devices of blue, and that, falling among the Dyacks, a folk of Borneo, was by them tattooed in modern fashion and device, and of his misery that fell upon him, and his outlawry.     _HE said_, The China on the shelf       Is very fair to view,    And wherefore should mine outer self,       Not correspond thereto?             In blue       My frame I must tattoo.     Where may tattooing men abound,       And ah, where might they be?    Nay, well I wot they are not found       In lands of Christentie,             (_Quoth he_)       But I must cross the sea!     So forth he sailed to Borneo,       (A land that culture lacks,)    And there his money did bestow       To purchase pricks and hacks,             (Dyacks       Are famed tattooing blacks.)     But European commerce had       Debased the savage kind,    And they this most unhappy lad       Before (and eke behind)             Designed       In colours to their mind!     Such awful colours as are blent       On terrible placards    Where flames the fierce advertisement       Yea, or on Christmas cards             (Not Ward’s,       But common Christmas cards!)     Thus never more to Chelsea might       The luckless boy return,    He knew himself too dreadful, quite,       A thing his friends would spurn,             And turn       To praise some Grecian urn!     But still he dwells in Borneo,       A land that culture lacks,    And there they all admire him so,       They bring him heads in sacks,             Dyacks       Are _not_ æsthetic blacks!    THE PALACE OF BRIC-À-BRAC.      HERE, where old Nankin glitters,       Here, where men’s tumult seems    As faint as feeble twitters       Of sparrows heard in dreams,          We watch Limoges enamel,          An old chased silver camel,          A shawl, the gift of Schamyl,       And manuscripts in reams.     Here, where the hawthorn pattern       On flawless cup and plate    Need fear no housemaid slattern,       Fell minister of fate,          ’Mid webs divinely woven,          And helms and hauberks cloven,          On music of Beethoven       We dream and meditate.     We know not, and we need not       To know how mortals fare,    Of Bills that pass, or speed not,       Time finds us unaware,          Yea, creeds and codes may crumble,          And Dilke and Gladstone stumble,          And eat the pie that’s humble,       We neither know nor care!     Can kings or clergies alter       The crackle on one plate?    Can creeds or systems palter       With what is truly great?          With Corots and with Millets,          With April daffodillies,          Or make the maiden lilies       Bloom early or bloom late?     Nay, here ’midst Rhodian roses,       ’Midst tissues of Cashmere,    The Soul sublime reposes,       And knows not hope nor fear;          Here all she sees her own is,          And musical her moan is,          O’er Caxtons and Bodonis,       Aldine and Elzevir!

IN Camelot how grey and green    The Damsels dwell, how sad their teen,    In Camelot how green and grey    The melancholy poplars sway.    I wis I wot not what they mean    Or wherefore, passionate and lean,    The maidens mope their loves between,    Not seeming to have much to say,                               In Camelot.    Yet there hath armour goodly sheen    The blossoms in the apple treen,    (To spell the Camelotian way)    Show fragrant through the doubtful day,    And Master’s work is often seen                               In Camelot!                                 _Philistia_.

THE BARBAROUS BIRD-GODS: A SAVAGE PARABASIS.   In the _Aves_ of Aristophanes, the Bird Chorus declare that they are older than the Gods, and greater benefactors of men.  This idea recurs in almost all savage mythologies, and I have made the savage Bird-gods state their own case.                              _The Birds sing_:     WE would have you to wit, that on eggs though we sit, and are spiked    on the spit, and are baked in the pan,    Birds are older by far than your ancestors are, and made love and made    war ere the making of Man!    For when all things were dark, not a glimmer nor spark, and the world    like a barque without rudder or sail    Floated on through the night, ’twas a Bird struck a light, ’twas a    flash from the bright feather’d Tonatiu’s {105} tail!    Then the Hawk {106a} with some dry wood flew up in the sky, and afar,    safe and high, the Hawk lit Sun and Moon,    And the Birds of the air they rejoiced everywhere, and they recked not    of care that should come on them soon.    For the Hawk, so they tell, was then known as Pundjel, {106b} and    a-musing he fell at the close of the day;    Then he went on the quest, as we thought, of a nest, with some bark of    the best, and a clawful of clay. {106c}    And with these did he frame two birds lacking a name, without feathers    (his game was a puzzle to all);    Next around them he fluttered a-dancing, and muttered; and, lastly, he    uttered a magical call:    Then the figures of clay, as they featherless lay, they leaped up, who    but they, and embracing they fell,    And _this_ was the baking of Man, and his making; but now he’s    forsaking his Father, Pundjel!    Now these creatures of mire, they kept whining for fire, and to crown    their desire who was found but the Wren?    To the high heaven he came, from the Sun stole he flame, and for this    has a name in the memory of men! {107a}    And in India who for the Soma juice flew, and to men brought it    through without falter or fail?    Why the Hawk ’twas again, and great Indra to men would appear, now and    then, in the shape of a Quail,    While the Thlinkeet’s delight is the Bird of the Night, the beak and    the bright ebon plumage of Yehl.{107b}    And who for man’s need brought the famed Suttung’s mead? why ’tis told    in the creed of the Sagamen strong,    ’Twas the Eagle god who brought the drink from the blue, and gave    mortals the brew that’s the fountain of song. {108a}    Next, who gave men their laws? and what reason or cause the young    brave"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1645"],["title","Rhymes a la Mode (#6)"],["body","when in need of a squaw,    Till he thinks it a shame to wed one of his name, and his conduct you    blame if he thus breaks the law?    For you still hold it wrong if a _lubra_ {108b} belong to the    self-same _kobong_ {108c} that is Father of you,    To take _her_ as a bride to your ebony side; nay, you give her a wide    berth; quite right of you, too.    For her father, you know, is _your_ father, the Crow, and no blessing    but woe from the wedding would spring.    Well, these rules they were made in the wattle-gum shade, and were    strictly obeyed, when the Crow was the King. {108d}    Thus on Earth’s little ball to the Birds you owe all, yet your    gratitude’s small for the favours they’ve done,    And their feathers you pill, and you eat them at will, yes, you    plunder and kill the bright birds one by one;    There’s a price on their head, and the Dodo is dead, and the Moa has    fled from the sight of the sun!    MAN AND THE ASCIDIAN.                                  A MORALITY.     “THE Ancestor remote of Man,”    Says Darwin, “is th’ Ascidian,”    A scanty sort of water-beast    That, ninety million years at least    Before Gorillas came to be,    Went swimming up and down the sea.     Their ancestors the pious praise,    And like to imitate their ways;    How, then, does our first parent live,    What lesson has his life to give?     Th’ Ascidian tadpole, young and gay,    Doth Life with one bright eye survey,    His consciousness has easy play.    He’s sensitive to grief and pain,    Has tail, and spine, and bears a brain,    And everything that fits the state    Of creatures we call vertebrate.    But age comes on; with sudden shock    He sticks his head against a rock!    His tail drops off, his eye drops in,    His brain’s absorbed into his skin;    He does not move, nor feel, nor know    The tidal water’s ebb and flow,    But still abides, unstirred, alone,    A sucker sticking to a stone.     And we, his children, truly we    In youth are, like the Tadpole, free.    And where we would we blithely go,    Have brains and hearts, and feel and know.    Then Age comes on!  To Habit we    Affix ourselves and are not free;    Th’ Ascidian’s rooted to a rock,    And we are bond-slaves of the clock;    Our rocks are Medicine—Letters—Law,    From these our heads we cannot draw:    Our loves drop off, our hearts drop in,    And daily thicker grows our skin.     Ah, scarce we live, we scarcely know    The wide world’s moving ebb and flow,    The clanging currents ring and shock,    But we are rooted to the rock.    And thus at ending of his span,    Blind, deaf, and indolent, does Man    Revert to the Ascidian.    BALLADE OF THE PRIMITIVE JEST.       “What did the dark-haired Iberian laugh at before the tall blonde     Aryan drove him into the corners of Europe?”—_Brander Matthews_.     I AM an ancient Jest!    Palæolithic man    In his arboreal nest    The sparks of fun would fan;    My outline did he plan,    And laughed like one possessed,    ’Twas thus my course began,    I am a Merry Jest!     I am an early Jest!    Man delved, and built, and span;    Then wandered South and West    The peoples Aryan,    _I_ journeyed in their van;    The Semites, too, confessed,—    From Beersheba to Dan,—    I am a Merry Jest!     I am an ancient Jest,    Through all the human clan,    Red, black, white, free, oppressed,    Hilarious I ran!    I’m found in Lucian,    In Poggio, and the rest,    I’m dear to Moll and Nan!    I am a Merry Jest!                                     ENVOY.     Prince, you may storm and ban—    Joe Millers _are_ a pest,    Suppress me if you can!    I am a Merry Jest!     CAMEOS.                          _SONNETS FROM THE ANTIQUE_.  These versions from classical passages are pretty close to the original, except where compression was needed, as in the sonnets from Pausanias and Apuleius, or where, as in the case of fragments of Æschylus and Sophocles, a little expansion was required.    CAMEOS.      _THE graver by Apollo’s shrine_,       _Before the Gods had fled_, _would stand_,       _A shell or onyx in his hand_,    _To copy there the face divine_,    _Till earnest touches_, _line by line_,       _Had wrought the wonder of the land_       _Within a beryl’s golden band_,    _Or on some fiery opal fine_.    _Ah_! _would that as some ancient ring_    _To us_, _on shell or stone_, _doth bring_,       _Art’s marvels perished long ago_,    _So I_, _within the sonnet’s space_,    _The large Hellenic lines might trace_,       _The statue in the cameo_!    HELEN ON THE WALLS.                              (_Iliad_, iii. 146.)     FAIR Helen to the Scæan portals came,    Where sat the elders, peers of Priamus,    Thymoetas, Hiketaon, Panthöus,    And many another of a noble name,    Famed warriors, now in council more of fame.    Always above the gates, in converse thus    They chattered like cicalas garrulous;    Who marking Helen, swore “it is no shame    That armed Achæan knights, and Ilian men    For such a woman’s sake should suffer long.    Fair as a deathless goddess seemeth she.    Nay, but aboard the red-prowed ships again    Home let her pass in peace, not working wrong    To us, and children’s children yet to be.”    THE ISLES OF THE BLESSED.      _Pindar_, _Fr._, 106, 107 (95): B. 4, 129–130, 109 (97): B. 4, 132.     NOW the light of the sun, in the night of the Earth, on the souls of    the True       Shines, and their city is girt with the meadow where reigneth the    rose;    And deep is the shade of the woods, and the wind that flits o’er them    and through       Sings of the sea, and is sweet from the isles where the    frankincense blows:    Green is their garden and orchard, with rare fruits golden it glows,       And the souls of the Blessed are glad in the pleasures on Earth    that they knew,    And in chariots these have delight, and in dice and in minstrelsy    those,       And the savour of sacrifice clings to the altars and rises anew.     But the Souls that Persephone cleanses from ancient pollution and    stain,       These at the end of the age be they prince, be they singer, or    seer;    These to the world, shall be born as of old, shall be sages again;       These of their hands shall be hardy, shall live, and shall die, and    shall hear    Thanks of the people, and songs of the minstrels that praise them    amain,       And their glory shall dwell in the land where they dwelt, while    year calls unto year!    DEATH.                             (_Æsch._, _Fr._, 156.)     OF all Gods Death alone       Disdaineth sacrifice:    No man hath found or shown       The gift that Death would prize.       In vain are songs or sighs,    Pæan, or praise, or moan,       Alone beneath the skies    Hath Death no altar-stone!     There is no head so dear       That men would grudge to Death;    Let Death but ask, we give    All gifts that we may live;    But though Death dwells so near,       We know not what he saith.    NYSA.                   (_Soph._, _Fr._, 235; _Æsch._, _Fr._, 56.)     ON these Nysæan shores divine       The clusters ripen in a day.       At dawn the blossom shreds away;    The berried grapes are green and fine    And full by noon; in day’s decline       They’re purple with a bloom of grey,       And e’er the twilight plucked are they,    And crushed, by nightfall, into wine.     But through the night with torch in hand       Down the dusk hills the Mænads fare;       The bull-voiced mummers roar and blare,    The muffled timbrels swell and sound,       And drown the clamour of the band    Like thunder moaning underground.    COLONUS.                             (_Œd. Col._, 667–705.)                                       I.     HERE be the fairest homes the land can show,    The silvery-cliffed Colonus; always here    The nightingale doth haunt and singeth clear,    For well the deep green gardens doth she know.    Groves of the God, where winds may never blow,       Nor men may tread, nor noontide sun may peer       Among the myriad-berried ivy dear,    Where Dionysus wanders to and fro.     For here he loves to dwell, and here resort    These Nymphs that are his nurses and his court,    And golden eyed beneath the dewy boughs       The crocus burns, and the narcissus fair       Clusters his blooms to crown thy clustered hair,    Demeter, and to wreathe the Maiden’s brows!                                       II.     YEA, here the dew of Heaven upon the grain       Fails never, nor the ceaseless water-spring,       Near neighbour of Cephisus wandering,    That day by day revisiteth the plain.    Nor do the Goddesses the grove disdain,       But chiefly here the Muses quire and sing,       And here they love to weave their dancing ring,    With Aphrodite of the golden rein.     And here there springs a plant that knoweth not       The Asian mead, nor that great Dorian isle,    Unsown, untilled, within our garden plot       It dwells, the grey-leaved olive; ne’er shall guile    Nor force of foemen root it from the spot:       Zeus and Athene guarding it the while!    THE PASSING OF ŒDIPOUS.                            (_Œd. Col._, 1655–1666.)     HOW Œdipous departed, who may tell       Save Theseus only? for there neither came       The burning bolt of thunder, and the flame    To blast him into nothing, nor the swell    Of sea-tide spurred by tempest on him fell.       But some diviner herald none may name       Called him, or inmost Earth’s abyss became    The painless place where such a soul might dwell.     Howe’er it chanced, untouched of malady,       Unharmed by fear, unfollowed by lament,    With comfort on the twilight way he went,       Passing, if ever man did, wondrously;    From this world’s death to life divinely rent,       Unschooled in Time’s last lesson, how we die.    THE TAMING OF TYRO.                             (_Soph._, _Fr._, 587.)  (Sidero, the stepmother of Tyro, daughter of Salmoneus, cruelly entreated her in all"]]]
