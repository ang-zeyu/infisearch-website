Give us leave to withdraw from your sight and speak privately together. Then he who returns to you will be the true voice and there shall be no more division--\"  It was Paft who broke in before Halfer's spokesman could reply.  \"It would have been better to have spoken together before you came to us. Go then until the shadow of the shield is not, then return hither and speak truly. We do not wait upon the pleasure of outlanders--\"  A murmur approved that tart comment. \"Until the shadow of the shield is not.\" They had until noon. Van Rycke arose and Dane gathered up his chief's possessions. With the same superiority to his surroundings he had shown upon entering, the Cargo-master left the enclosure, the Eysies following. But they were away from the clearing, out upon the road back to the Queen before the two from the Company caught up with them.  \"Captain Grange will see you right away--\" the Eysie Cargo-master was beginning when Van Rycke met him with a quelling stare.  \"If you poachers have anything to say--you say it at the Queen and to Captain Jellico,\" he stated flatly and started on.  Above his tight tunic collar the other's face flushed, his teeth flashed as he caught his lower lip between them as if to forcibly restrain an answer he longed to make. For a second he hesitated and then he vanished down a side path with his assistant. Van Rycke had gone a quarter of the distance back to the ship before he spoke.  \"I thought it was too easy,\" he muttered. \"Now we're in for it--maybe right up the rockets! By the Spiked Tail of Exol, this is certainly _not_ our lucky day!\" He quickened pace until they were close to trotting.     Chapter II  RIVALS   \"That's far enough, Eysie!\"  Although Traders by law and tradition carried no more potent personal weapons--except in times of great crisis--than hand sleep rods, the resultant shot from the latter was just as unpleasant for temporary periods as a more forceful beam--and the threat of it was enough to halt the three men who had come to the foot of the Queen's ramp and who could see the rod held rather negligently by Ali. Ali's eyes were anything but negligent, however, and Free Traders had reputations to be respected by their rivals of the Companies. The very nature of their roving lives taught them savage lessons--which they either learned or died.  Dane, glancing down over the Engineer-apprentice's shoulder, saw that Van Rycke's assumption of confidence had indeed paid off. They had left the trade enclosure of the Salariki barely three-quarters of an hour ago. But below now stood the bebadged Captain of the I-S ship and his Cargo-master.  \"I want to speak to your Captain--\" snarled the Eysie officer.  Ali registered faint amusement, an expression which tended to rouse the worst in the spectator, as Dane knew of old when that same mocking appraisal had been turned on him as the rawest of the Queen's crew.  \"But does _he_ wish to speak to you?\" countered Kamil. \"Just stay where you are, Eysie, until we are sure about that fact.\"  That was his cue to act as messenger. Dane retreated into the ship and swung up the ladder to the command section. As he passed Captain Jellico's private cabin he heard the muffled squall of the commander's unpleasant pet--Queex, the Hoobat--a nightmare combination of crab, parrot and toad, wearing a blue feather coating and inclined to scream and spit at all comers. Since Queex would not be howling in that fashion if its master was present, Dane kept on to the control cabin where he blundered in upon an executive level conference of Captain, Cargo-master and Astrogator.  \"Well?\" Jellico's blaster scarred left cheek twitched as he snapped that impatient inquiry at the messenger.  \"Eysie Captain below, sir. With his Cargo-master. They want to see you--\"  Jellico's mouth was a straight line, his eyes very hard. By instinct Dane's hand went to the grip of the sleep rod slung at his belt. When the Old Man put on his fighting face--look out! Here we go again, he told himself, speculating as to just what type of action lay before them now.  \"Oh, they do, do they!\" Jellico began and then throttled down the temper he could put under iron control when and if it were necessary. \"Very well, tell them to stay where they are. Van, we'll go down--\"  For a moment the Cargo-master hesitated, his heavy-lidded eyes looked sleepy, he seemed almost disinterested in the suggestion. And when he nodded it was with the air of someone about to perform some boring duty.  \"Right, sir.\" He wriggled his heavy body from behind the small table, resealed his tunic, and settled his cap with as much precision as if he were about to represent the Queen before the assembled nobility of Sargol.  Dane hurried down the ladders, coming to a halt beside Ali. It was the turn of the man at the foot of the ramp to bark an impatient demand:  \"Well?\" (Was that the theme word of every Captain's vocabulary?)  \"You wait,\" Dane replied with no inclination to give the Eysie officer any courtesy address. Close to a Terran year aboard the Solar Queen had inoculated him with pride in his own section of Service. A Free Trader was answerable to his own officers and to no one else on earth--or among the stars--no matter how much discipline and official etiquette the Companies used to enhance their power.  He half expected the I-S officers to leave after an answer such as that. For a Company Captain to be forced to wait upon the convenience of a Free Trader must be galling in the extreme. And the fact that this one was doing just that was an indication that the Queen's crew did, perhaps, have the edge of advantage in any coming bargain. In the meantime the Eysie contingent fumed below while Ali lounged whistling against the exit port, playing with his sleep rod and Dane studied the grass forest. His boot nudged a packet just inside the port casing and he glanced inquiringly from it to Ali.  \"Cat ransom,\" the other answered his unspoken question.  So that was it--the fee for Sinbad's return. \"What is it today?\"  \"Sugar--about a tablespoon full,\" the Engineer-assistant returned, \"and two colored steelos. So far they haven't run up the price on us. I think they're sharing out the spoil evenly, a new cub brings him back every night.\"  As did all Terran ships, the Solar Queen carried a cat as an important member of the regular crew. And the portly Sinbad, before their landing on Sargol, had never presented any problem. He had done his duty of ridding the ship of unusual and usual pests and cargo despoilers with dispatch, neatness and energy. And when in port on alien worlds had never shown any inclination to go a-roving.  But the scents of Sargol had apparently intoxicated him, shearing away his solid dignity and middle-aged dependability. Now Sinbad flashed out of the Queen at the opening of her port in the early morning and was brought back, protesting with both voice and claws, at the end of the day by that member of the juvenile population whose turn it was to collect the standing reward for his forceful delivery. Within three days it had become an accepted business transaction which satisfied everyone but Sinbad.  The scrape of metal boot soles on ladder rungs warned of the arrival of their officers. Ali and Dane withdrew down the corridor, leaving the entrance open for Jellico and Van Rycke. Then they drifted back to witness the meeting with the Eysies.  There were no prolonged greetings between the two parties, no offer of hospitality as might have been expected between Terrans on an alien planet a quarter of the Galaxy away from the earth which had given them a common heritage.  Jellico, with Van Rycke at his shoulder, halted before he stepped from the ramp so that the three Inter-Solar men, Captain, Cargo-master and escort, whether they wished or no, were put in the disadvantageous position of having to look up to a Captain whom they, as members of one of the powerful Companies, affected to despise. The lean, well muscled, trim figure of the Queen's commander gave the impression of hard bitten force held in check by will control, just as his face under its thick layer of space burn was that of an adventurer accustomed to make split second decisions--an estimate underlined by that seam of blaster burn across one flat cheek.  Van Rycke, with a slight change of dress, could have been a Company man in the higher ranks--or so the casual observer would have placed him, until an observer marked the eyes behind those sleepy drooping lids, or caught a certain note in the calm, unhurried drawl of his voice. To look at the two senior officers of the Free Trading spacer were the antithesis of each other--in action they were each half of a powerful, steamroller whole--as a good many men in the Service--scattered over a half dozen or so planets--had discovered to their cost in the past.  Now Jellico brought the heels of his space boots together with an extravagant click and his hand flourished at the fore of his helmet in a gesture which was better suited to the Patrol hero of a slightly out-of-date Video serial.  \"Jellico, Solar Queen, Free Trader,\" he identified himself brusquely, and added, \"this is Van Rycke, our Cargo-master.\"  Not all the flush had faded from the face of the I-S Captain.  \"Grange of the Dart,\" he did not even sketch a salute. \"Inter-Solar. Kallee, Cargo-master--\" And he did not name the hovering third member of his party.  Jellico stood waiting and after a long moment of silence Grange was forced to state his business.  \"We have until noon--\"  Jellico, his fingers hooked in his belt, simply waited. And under his level gaze the Eysie Captain began to find the going hard.  \"They have given us until noon,\" he started once more, \"to get together--\"  Jellico's voice came, coldly remote. \"There is no reason for any 'getting together,' Grange. By rights I can have you up before the Trade Board for poaching. The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16921"],["title","Plague Ship (#3)"],["body"," Queen has sole trading rights here. If you up-ship within a reasonable amount of time, I'll be inclined to let it pass. After all I've no desire to run all the way to the nearest Patrol post to report you--\"  \"You can't expect to buck Inter-Solar. We'll make you an offer--\" That was Kallee's contribution, made probably because his commanding officer couldn't find words explosive enough.  Jellico, whose forté was more direct action, took an excursion into heavy-handed sarcasm. \"You Eysies have certainly been given excellent briefing. I would advise a little closer study of the Code--and not the sections in small symbols at the end of the tape, either! _We're_ not bucking anyone. You'll find our registration for Sargol down on tapes at the Center. And I suggest that the sooner you withdraw the better--before we cite you for illegal planeting.\"  Grange had gained control of his emotions. \"We're pretty far from Center here,\" he remarked. It was a statement of fact, but it carried over-tones which they were able to assess correctly. The Solar Queen was a Free Trader, alone on an alien world. But the I-S ship might be cruising in company, ready to summon aid, men and supplies. Dane drew a deep breath, the Eysies _must_ be sure of themselves, not only that, but they must want what Sargol had to offer to the point of being willing to step outside the law to get it.  The I-S Captain took a step forward. \"I think we understand each other now,\" he said, his confidence restored.  Van Rycke answered him, his deep voice cutting across the sighing of the wind in the grass forest.  \"Your proposition?\"  Perhaps this return to their implied threat bolstered their belief in the infallibility of the Company, their conviction that no independent dared stand up against the might and power of Inter-Solar. Kallee replied:  \"We'll take up your contract, at a profit to you, and you up-ship before the Salariki are confused over whom they are to deal with--\"  \"And the amount of profit?\" Van Rycke bored in.  \"Oh,\" Kallee shrugged, \"say ten percent of Cam's last shipment--\"  Jellico laughed. \"Generous, aren't you, Eysie? Ten percent of a cargo which can't be assessed--the gang on Limbo kept no records of what they plundered.\"  \"We don't know what he was carrying when he crashed on Limbo,\" countered Kallee swiftly. \"We'll base our offer on what he carried to Axal.\"  Now Van Rycke chucked. \"I wonder who figured that one out?\" he inquired of the scented winds. \"He must save the Company a fair amount of credits one way or another. Interesting offer--\"  By the bland satisfaction to be read on the three faces below the I-S men were assured of their victory. The Solar Queen would be paid off with a pittance, under the vague threat of Company retaliation she would up-ship from Sargol, and they would be left in possession of the rich Koros trade--to be commended and rewarded by their superiors. Had they, Dane speculated, ever had any dealings with Free Traders before--at least with the brand of independent adventurers such as manned the Solar Queen?  Van Rycke burrowed in his belt pouch and then held out his hand. On the broad palm lay a flat disc of metal. \"Very interesting--\" he repeated. \"I shall treasure this recording--\"  The sight of that disc wiped all satisfaction from the Eysie faces. Grange's purplish flush spread up from his tight tunic collar, Kallee blinked, and the unknown third's hand dropped to his sleep rod. An action which was not overlooked by either Dane or Ali.  \"A smooth set down to you,\" Jellico gave the conventional leave taking of the Service.  \"You'd better--\" the Eysie Captain began hotly, and then seeing the disc Van Rycke held--that sensitive bit of metal and plastic which was recording this interview for future reference, he shut his mouth tight.  \"Yes?\" the Queen's Cargo-master prompted politely. But Kallee had taken his Captain's arm and was urging Grange away from the spacer.  \"You have until noon to lift,\" was Jellico's parting shot as the three in Company livery started toward the road.  \"I don't think that they will,\" he added to Van Rycke.  The Cargo-master nodded. \"You wouldn't in their place,\" he pointed out reasonably. \"On the other hand they've had a bit of a blast they weren't expecting. It's been a long time since Grange heard anyone say 'no.'\"  \"A shock which is going to wear off,\" Jellico's habitual distrust of the future gathered force.  \"This,\" Van Rycke tucked the disc back into his pouch, \"sent them off vector a parsec or two. Grange is not one of the strong arm blaster boys. Suppose Tang Ya does a little listening in--and maybe we can rig another surprise if Grange does try to ask advice of someone off world. In the meantime I don't think they are going to meddle with the Salariki. They don't want to have to answer awkward questions if _we_ turn up a Patrol ship to ask them. So--\" he stretched and beckoned to Dane, \"we shall go to work once more.\"  Again two paces behind Van Rycke Dane tramped to the trade circle of the Salariki clansmen. They might have walked out only five or six minutes of ship time before, and the natives betrayed no particular interest in their return. But, Dane noted, there was only one empty stool, one ceremonial table in evidence. The Salariki had expected only one Terran Trader to join them.  What followed was a dreary round of ceremony, an exchange of platitudes and empty good wishes and greetings. No one mentioned Koros stones--or even perfume bark--that he was willing to offer the off-world traders. None lifted so much as a corner of his trade cloth, under which, if he were ready to deal seriously, his hidden hand would meet that of the buyer, so that by finger pressure alone they could agree or disagree on price. But such boring sessions were part of Trade and Dane, keeping a fraction of attention on the speeches and \"drinkings-together,\" watched those around him with an eye which tried to assess and classify what he saw.  The keynote of the Salariki character was a wary independence. The only form of government they would tolerate was a family-clan organization. Feuds and deadly duels between individuals and clans were the accepted way of life and every male who reached adulthood went armed and ready for combat until he became a \"Speaker for the past\"--too old to bear arms in the field. Due to the nature of their battling lives, relatively few of the Salariki ever reached that retirement. Short-lived alliances between families sometimes occurred, usually when they were to face a common enemy greater than either. But a quarrel between chieftains, a fancied insult would rip that open in an instant. Only under the Trade Shield could seven clans sit this way without their warriors being at one another's furred throats.  An hour before sunset Paft turned his goblet upside down on his table, a move followed speedily by every chieftain in the circle. The conference was at an end for that day. And as far as Dane could see it had accomplished exactly nothing--except to bring the Eysies into the open. What _had_ Traxt Cam discovered which had given him the trading contract with these suspicious aliens? Unless the men from the Queen learned it, they could go on talking until the contract ran out and get no farther than they had today.  From his training Dane knew that ofttimes contact with an alien race did require long and patient handling. But between study and experiencing the situation himself there was a gulf, and he thought somewhat ruefully that he had much to learn before he could meet such a situation with Van Rycke's unfailing patience and aplomb. The Cargo-master seemed in nowise tired by his wasted day and Dane knew that Van would probably sit up half the night, going over for the hundredth time Traxt Cam's sketchy recordings in another painstaking attempt to discover why and how the other Free Trader had succeeded where the Queen's men were up against a stone wall.  The harvesting of Koros stones was, as Dane and all those who had been briefed from Cam's records knew, a perilous job. Though the rule of the Salariki was undisputed on the land masses of Sargol, it was another matter in the watery world of the shallow seas. There the Gorp were in command of the territory and one had to be constantly alert for attack from the sly, reptilian intelligence, so alien to the thinking processes of both Salariki and Terran that there was, or seemed to be, no point of possible contact. One went gathering Koros gems after balancing life against gain. And perhaps the Salariki did not see any profit in that operation. Yet Traxt Cam had brought back his bag of gems--somehow he had managed to secure them in trade.  Van Rycke climbed the ramp, hurrying on into the Queen as if he would not get back to his records soon enough. But Dane paused and looked back at the grass jungle a little wistfully. To his mind these early morning hours were the best time on Sargol. The light was golden, the night winds had not yet arisen. He disliked exchanging the freedom of the open for the confinement of the spacer.  And, as he hesitated there, two of the juvenile population of Sargol came out of the forest. Between them they carried one of their hunting nets, a net which now enclosed a quiet but baneful eyed captive--Sinbad being delivered for nightly ransom. Dane was reaching for the pay to give the captors when, to his real astonishment, one of them advanced and pointed with an extended forefinger claw to the open port.  \"Go in,\" he formed the Trade Lingo words with care. And Dane's surprise must have been plain to read for the cub followed his speech with a vigorous nod and set one foot on the ramp to underline his desire.  For one of the Salariki, who had continually manifested their belief that Terrans and their ship were an offence to the nostrils of all right living \"men,\" to wish to enter the spacer was an astonishing about-face. But any advantage no matter how small, which might bring"]]]
