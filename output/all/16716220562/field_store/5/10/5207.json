There are thousands to start with a rush for the fray       When the fighting seems easy to do,     But when danger is present and rough is the way,       The few have to see the job through.      It is easy to quit with a battle unwon,       It is hard to press on to success;     It is easy to stop with a purpose undone,       It is hard to encounter distress.     And many will march when the roadway is clear       And the glorious goal is in view,     But the many, too often, when dangers appear,       Aren't willing to see the fight through.      They weaken in spirit when trials grow great,       They flinch at the clashing of steel;     They talk of the strength of the foe at the gate       And whine at the hurts that they feel.     They begin to regret having ventured for right,       They sigh that they dared to be true,     They haven't the heart they once had for the fight,       They don't want to see the job through.      We have set out to battle for justice and truth,       We have fearful disasters to meet;     We shall weep for the best of our manliest youth,       We shall suffer the pangs of defeat.     But let us stand firm for the cause that we plead,       Let the many be brave with the few;     The cry of the quitter let none of us heed       Till we've done what we started to do.             Hope       Mine is a song of hope          For the days that lie before;       For the grander things       The morrow brings          When the struggle days are o'er.     Dark be the clouds to-day,          Bitter the winds that blow,       But falter nor fail,       Through the howling gale--          Comes peace in the afterglow.      Mine is the song of hope,          A song for the mother here,       Who lulls to rest       The babe at breast,          And hopes for a brighter year.     Hope is the song she sings,          Hope is the prayer she prays;       As she rocks her boy,       She dreams of the joy          He'll bring in the future days.      Mine is the song of hope,          A song for the father, too,       Whose right arm swings,       While his anvil sings          A song of the journey through.     Hope is the star that guides,          Hope is the father's sun;       Far ahead he sees,       Through the waving trees,          Sweet peace when his work is done.      Mine is the song of hope,          Of hope that sustains us all;       Be we young or old,       Be we weak or bold,          Do we falter or even fall,     Brightly the star of hope          From the distance is shining still;       And with courage new       We rise to do,          For hope is the God of Will.             The Gold Givers       Oh, some shall stand in glory's light when all the strife is done,     And many a mother there shall say, \"For truth I gave my son!\"     But I shall stand in silence then and hear the stories brave,     For I must answer at the last that gold is all I gave.      When all this age shall pass away, and silenced are the guns,     When sweethearts join their loves again, and mothers kiss their sons,     When brave unto the brave return, and all they did is told,     How pitiful my gift shall seem, when all I gave is gold.      When we are asked what did you then, when all the world was red,     And some shall say, \"I fell in France,\" and some, \"I mourned my dead;\"     With all the brave assembled there in glory long to live,     How trivial our lives shall seem who had but gold to give.             The Undaunted       He tried to travel No Man's Land, that's guarded well with guns,     He tried to race the road of death, where never a coward runs.     Now he's asking of his doctor, and he's panting hard for breath,     How soon he will be ready for another bout with death.      You'd think if you had wakened in a shell hole's slime and mud     That was partly dirty water, but was mostly human blood,     And you had to lie and suffer till the bullets ceased to hum     And the night time dropped its cover, so the stretcher boys could come--      You'd think if you had suffered from a fever and its thirst,     And could hear the \"rapids\" spitting and the high explosives burst,     And had lived to tell that story--you could face our fellow men     In the little peaceful village, though you never fought again.      You'd think that once you'd fallen in the shrapnel's deadly rain,     Once you'd shed your blood for honor, you had borne your share of pain;     Once you'd traveled No Man's country, you'd be satisfied to quit     And be invalided homeward, and could say you'd done your bit.      But he's lying, patched and bandaged, very white and very weak,     And he's trying to be cheerful, though it's agony to speak;     He is pleading with the doctor, though he's panting hard for breath,     To return him to the trenches for another bout with death.             The Discovery of a Soul         _The proof of a man is the danger test_,       _That shows him up at his worst or best_.      He didn't seem to care for work, he wasn't much at school.     His speech was slow and commonplace--you wouldn't call him fool.     And yet until the war broke out you'd calmly pass him by,     For nothing in his make-up or his way would catch your eye.     He seemed indifferent to the world, the kind that doesn't care--     That's satisfied with just enough to eat and drink and wear;     That doesn't laugh when others do or cry when others weep,     But seems to walk the wakeful world half dormant and asleep;     Then came the war, and soldiers marched and drums began to roll,     And suddenly we realized his body held a soul.      We little dreamed how much he loved his Country and her Flag;     About the glorious Stars and Stripes we'd never heard him brag.     But he was first to volunteer, while brilliant men demurred,     He took the oath of loyalty without a faltering word,     And then we found that he could talk, for one remembered night,     There came a preaching pacifist denouncing men who fight,     And he got up in uniform and looked at him and said:     \"I wonder if you ever think about our soldiers dead.     All that you are to-day you owe some soldier in his grave;     If he had been afraid to fight, you still would be a slave.\"      If he had died a year ago beneath a peaceful sky,     Unjust our memory would have been; of him our tongues would lie.     We should have missed his splendid worth, we should have called him frail     And listed him among the weak and sorry men who fail.     But few regrets had marked his end; he would have passed unmourned--     Perhaps by those who knew him best, indifferently scorned.     But now he stands among us all, eyes bright and shoulders true,     A strong defender of the faith; a man with work to do;     And if he dies, his name shall find its place on history's scroll;     The great chance has revealed to men the splendor of his soul.             Here We Are!       Here we are, Britain! the finest and best of us     Taking our coats off and rolling our sleeves,     Answering the thoughtless that once made a jest of us,     Each man a soldier for what he believes.     Here we are, tight little island, in unity!     Tell us the job that you want us to do!     You can depend on us all with impunity.     Give us a task and we'll all see it through.      Here we are, France! every Yankee born man of us     Coming to stand by your side in the fight;     Liberty's cause makes a whole-hearted clan of us.     Here we are, willing to die for the right.     Silently, long from our shores we've admired you,     Secretly proud of the pluck you've displayed.     Brothers we are of the love that inspired you;     Now we are coming, full front, to your aid.      Here we are, Allies! make room in your trenches!     Shoulder to shoulder we'll share in each drive.     Here we are! quitting our lathes and our benches,     Bringing our best that our best shall survive.     Here we are! Liberty's children, red-blooded,     Coming to share in the struggle with you,     Ready to die for the Flag that's star-studded;     Tell us the work that you want us to do.      What is it, fighting or building you're needing?     Boring a mountain or bridging a stream,     Steel work and real work? Your call we are heeding.     Each of us here is a man with a dream.     Here we are! tacklers of tough jobs and dangers,     Any old post where you put us we'll fit;     Coming to serve you as brothers, not strangers;     Here we are, Allies! to offer our bit!             We Who Stay at Home       When you were just our little boy, on many a night we crept     Unto your cot and watched o'er you, and all the time you slept.     We tucked the covers round your form and smoothed your pillow, too,     And sometimes stooped and kissed your cheeks, but that you never knew.     Just as we came to you back then through many a night and day,     Our spirits now shall come to you--to kiss and watch and pray.      Whenever you shall look away into God's patch of sky     To think about the folks at home, we shall be standing by.     And as we prayed and watched o'er you when you were wrapped in sleep,     So through your soldier danger now the old-time watch we'll keep.     You will not know that we are there, you will not see or hear,     But all the time in prayer and thought we shall be very near.      The world has made of you a man; the work of man you do,     But unto us you still remain the baby that we knew;     And we shall come, as once we did, on wondrous wings of prayer,     And you will never know how oft in spirit we are there.     We'll stand beside your bed at night, in silence bending low,     And all the love we gave you then shall follow where you go.

The editors of the several volumes will be chosen for their special qualifications in connection with the texts to be issued under their individual supervision, but familiarity with the practical needs of the classroom, no less than sound scholarship, will characterize the editing of every book in the series.  In connection with each text, a critical and historical introduction, including a sketch of the life of the author and his relation to the thought of his time, critical opinions of the work in question chosen from the great body of English criticism, and, where possible, a portrait of the author, will be given. Ample explanatory notes of such passages in the text as call for special attention will be supplied, but irrelevant annotation and explanations of the obvious will be rigidly excluded.  CHARLES E. MERRILL CO.     LIFE OF EMERSON   Ralph Waldo Emerson was born in Boston, May 25, 1803. He was descended from a long line of New England ministers, men of refinement and education. As a school-boy he was quiet and retiring, reading a great deal, but not paying much attention to his lessons. He entered Harvard at the early age of fourteen, but never attained a high rank there, although he took a prize for an essay on Socrates, and was made class poet after several others had declined. Next to his reserve and the faultless propriety of his conduct, his contemporaries at college seemed most impressed by the great maturity of his mind. Emerson appears never to have been really a boy. He was always serene and thoughtful, impressing all who knew him with that spirituality which was his most distinguishing characteristic.  After graduating from college he taught school for a time, and then entered the Harvard Divinity School under Dr. Channing, the great Unitarian preacher. Although he was not strong enough to attend all the lectures of the divinity course, the college authorities deemed the name Emerson sufficient passport to the ministry. He was accordingly \"approbated to preach\" by the Middlesex Association of Ministers on October 10, 1826. As a preacher, Emerson was interesting, though not particularly original. His talent seems to have been in giving new meaning to the old truths of religion. One of his hearers has said: \"In looking back on his preaching I find he has impressed truths to which I always assented in such a manner as to make them appear new, like a clearer revelation.\" Although his sermons were always couched in scriptural language, they were touched with the light of that genius which avoids the conventional and commonplace. In his other pastoral duties Emerson was not quite so successful. It is characteristic of his deep humanity and his dislike for all fuss and commonplace that he appeared to least advantage at a funeral. A connoisseur in such matters, an old sexton, once remarked that on such occasions \"he did not appear at ease at all. To tell the truth, in my opinion, that young man was not born to be a minister.\"  Emerson did not long remain a minister. In 1832 he preached a sermon in which he announced certain views in regard to the communion service which were disapproved by a large part of his congregation. He found it impossible to continue preaching, and, with the most friendly feelings on both sides, he parted from his congregation.  A few months later (1833) he went to Europe for a short year of travel. While abroad, he visited Walter Savage Landor, Coleridge and Wordsworth, and Thomas Carlyle. This visit to Carlyle was to both men a most interesting experience. They parted feeling that they had much intellectually in common. This belief fostered a sympathy which, by the time they had discovered how different they really were, had grown so strong a habit that they always kept up their intimacy. This year of travel opened Emerson's eyes to many things of which he had previously been ignorant; he had profited by detachment from the concerns of a limited community and an isolated church.  After his return he began to find his true field of activity in the lecture-hall, and delivered a number of addresses in Boston and its vicinity. While thus coming before the open public on the lecture platform, he was all the time preparing the treatise which was to embody all the quintessential elements of his philosophical doctrine. This was the essay _Nature_, which was published in 1836. By its conception of external Nature as an incarnation of the Divine Mind it struck the fundamental principle of Emerson's religious belief. The essay had a very small circulation at first, though later it became widely known.  In the winter of 1836 Emerson followed up his discourse on Nature by a course of twelve lectures on the \"Philosophy of History,\" a considerable portion of which eventually became embodied in his essays. The next year (1837) was the year of the delivery of the _Man Thinking, or the American Scholar_ address before the Phi Beta Kappa Society at Cambridge.  This society, composed of the first twenty-five men in each class graduating from college, has annual meetings which have called forth the best efforts of many distinguished scholars and thinkers. Emerson's address was listened to with the most profound interest. It declared a sort of intellectual independence for America. Henceforth we were to be emancipated from clogging foreign influences, and a national literature was to expand under the fostering care of the Republic.  These two discourses, _Nature_ and _The American Scholar_, strike the keynote of Emerson's philosophical, poetical, and moral teachings. In fact he had, as every great teacher has, only a limited number of principles and theories to teach. These principles of life can all be enumerated in twenty words--self-reliance, culture, intellectual and moral independence, the divinity of nature and man, the necessity of labor, and high ideals.  Emerson spent the latter part of his life in lecturing and in literary work. His son, Dr. Edward Emerson, gave an interesting account of how these lectures were constructed. \"All through his life he kept a journal. This book, he said, was his 'Savings Bank.' The thoughts thus received and garnered in his journals were indexed, and a great many of them appeared in his published works. They were religiously set down just as they came, in no order except chronological, but later they were grouped, enlarged or pruned, illustrated, worked into a lecture or discourse, and, after having in this capacity undergone repeated testing and rearranging, were finally carefully sifted and more rigidly pruned, and were printed as essays.\"  Besides his essays and lectures Emerson left some poetry in which is embodied those thoughts which were to him too deep for prose expression. Oliver Wendell Holmes in speaking of this says: \"Emerson wrote occasionally in verse from his school-days until he had reached the age which used to be known as the grand climacteric, sixty-three.... His poems are not and hardly can become popular; they are not meant to be liked by the many, but to be dearly loved and cherished by the few.... His occasional lawlessness in technical construction, his somewhat fantastic expressions, his enigmatic obscurities hardly detract from the pleasant surprise his verses so often bring with them.... The poetic license which we allow in the verse of Emerson is more than excused by the noble spirit which makes us forget its occasional blemishes, sometimes to be pleased with them as characteristic of the writer.\"  Emerson was always a striking figure in the intellectual life of America. His discourses were above all things inspiring. Through them many were induced to strive for a higher self-culture. His influence can be discerned in all the literary movements of the time. He was the central figure of the so-called transcendental school which was so prominent fifty years ago, although he always rather held aloof from any enthusiastic participation in the movement.  Emerson lived a quiet life in Concord, Massachusetts. \"He was a first-rate neighbor and one who always kept his fences up.\" He traveled extensively on his lecturing tours, even going as far as England. In _English Traits_ he has recorded his impressions of what he saw of English life and manners.  Oliver Wendell Holmes has described him in this wise: \"His personal appearance was that of the typical New Englander of college-bred ancestry. Tall, spare, slender, with sloping shoulders, slightly stooping in his later years, with light hair and eyes, the scholar's complexion, the prominent, somewhat arched nose which belongs to many of the New England sub-species, thin lips, suggestive of delicacy, but having nothing like primness, still less of the rigidity which is often noticeable in the generation succeeding next to that of the men in their shirt-sleeves, he would have been noticed anywhere as one evidently a scholarly thinker astray from the alcove or the study, which were his natural habitats. His voice was very sweet, and penetrating without any "]]]
