Does the patriot-flame in her heart cease to stir,--     Does she feel that the conflict is over for her?     Because the red war-tide has deluged her o'er,--     Has wreaked its wild wrath, and can harm _her_ no more,--     Does she stand, self-absorbed, on the wreck she has braved,     Nor care if her country be lost or be saved?      By her pride in the soil that has given her birth--     By her tenderest memories garnered on earth--     By the legacy blood-bought and precious, which she     Would leave to her children--the right to be free,--     By the altar where once rose the hymn and the prayer;     By the home that lies scarred in its solitude there,--     By the pangs she has suffered,--the ills she has borne,--     By the desolate exile through which she must mourn,--     By the struggles that hallow this fair Southern sod,     By the vows she has breathed in the ear of her God,--     By the blood of the heart that she worshipped,--the life     That enfolded her own; by her love, as his wife;     By his death on the battle-field, gallantly brave,--     By the shadow that ever will wrap her--his grave--     By the faith she reposes, oh! Father! in Thee,     She claims that her glorious South MUST be free!     VIRGINIA.  A SONNET.       Grandly thou fillest the world's eye to-day,       My proud Virginia! When the gage was thrown--       The deadly gage of battle--thou, alone,     Strong in thy self-control, didst stoop to lay     The olive-branch thereon, and calmly pray       We might have peace, the rather. When the foe       Turned scornfully upon thee,--bade thee go,     And whistled up his war-hounds, then--the way       Of duty full before thee,--thou didst spring       Into the centre of the martial ring--     Thy brave blood boiling, and thy glorious eye,       Shot with heroic fire, and swear to claim       Sublimest victory in God's own name,--     Or, wrapped in robes of martyrdom,--to die!     JACKSON.  A SONNET.       Thank God for such a Hero!--Fearless hold       His diamond character beneath the sun,       And brighter scintillations, one by one,     Come flashing from it. Never knight of old     Wore on serener brow, so calm, yet bold,       Diviner courage: never martyr knew       Trust more sublime,--nor patriot, zeal more true,--     Nor saint, self-abnegation of a mould       Touched with profounder beauty. All the rare,     Clear, starry points of light, that gave his soul       Such lambent lustre, owned but one sole aim,--       Not for himself, nor yet his country's fame,     These glories shone: he kept the clustered whole       A jewel for the crown that Christ shall wear!     DIRGE FOR ASHBY.       Heard ye that thrilling word--       Accent of dread--     Flash like a thunderbolt,       Bowing each head--     Crash through the battle dun,     Over the booming gun--     \"_Ashby, our bravest one_,--       _Ashby is dead!_\"      Saw ye the veterans--       Hearts that had known     Never a quail of fear,       Never a groan--     Sob 'mid the fight they win,     --Tears their stern eyes within,--     \"Ashby, our Paladin,       Ashby is gone!\"      Dash,--dash the tear away--       Crush down the pain!     \"_Dulce et decus_,\" be       Fittest refrain!     Why should the dreary pall     Round him be flung at all?     Did not our hero fall       Gallantly slain?      Catch the last word of cheer       Dropt from his tongue;     Over the volley's din,       Loud be it rung--     \"_Follow me! follow me!_\"--     Soldier, oh! could there be     PÃ¦an or dirge for thee,       Loftier sung!      Bold as the Lion-heart,       Dauntless and brave;     Knightly as knightliest       Bayard could crave;     Sweet with all Sidney's grace--     Tender as Hampden's face--     Who--who shall fill the space       Void by his grave?      'Tis not _one_ broken heart,       Wild with dismay;     Crazed with her agony,       Weeps o'er his clay:     Ah! from a thousand eyes     Flow the pure tears that rise;     Widowed Virginia lies       Stricken to-day!      Yet--though that thrilling word--       Accent of dread--     Falls like a thunderbolt,       Bowing each head--     Heroes! be battle done     Bravelier every one,     Nerved by the thought alone--       _Ashby is dead!_      STONEWALL JACKSON'S GRAVE.[A]       A simple, sodded mound of earth,       Without a line above it;     With only daily votive flowers       To prove that any love it:     The token flag that silently       Each breeze's visit numbers,     Alone keeps martial ward above       The hero's dreamless slumbers.      No name?--no record? Ask the world;       The world has read his story--     If all its annals can unfold       A prouder tale of glory:--     If ever merely human life       Hath taught diviner moral,--     If ever round a worthier brow       Was twined a purer laurel!      A twelvemonth only, since his sword       Went flashing through the battle--     A twelvemonth only, since his ear       Heard war's last deadly rattle--     And yet, have countless pilgrim-feet       The pilgrim's guerdon paid him,     And weeping women come to see       The place where they have laid him.      Contending armies bring, in turn,       Their meed of praise or honor,     And Pallas here has paused to bind       The cypress wreath upon her:     It seems a holy sepulchre,       Whose sanctities can waken     Alike the love of friend or foe,--       Of Christian or of pagan.      THEY come to own his high emprise,       Who fled in frantic masses,     Before the glittering bayonet       That triumphed at Manassas:     Who witnessed Kernstown's fearful odds,       As on their ranks he thundered,     Defiant as the storied Greek,       Amid his brave three hundred!      They well recall the tiger spring,       The wise retreat, the rally,     The tireless march, the fierce pursuit,       Through many a mountain valley:     Cross Keys unlock new paths to fame,       And Port Republic's story     Wrests from his ever-vanquish'd foes,       Strange tributes to his glory.      Cold Harbor rises to their view,--       The Cedars' gloom is o'er them;     Antietam's rough and rugged heights,       Stretch mockingly before them:     The lurid flames of Fredericksburg       Right grimly they remember,     That lit the frozen night's retreat,       That wintry-wild December!      The largess of their praise is flung       With bounty, rare and regal;     --Is it because the vulture fears       No longer the dead eagle?     Nay, rather far accept it thus,--       An homage true and tender,     As soldier unto soldier's worth,--       As brave to brave will render,      But who shall weigh the wordless grief       That leaves in tears its traces,     As round their leader crowd again,       The bronzed and veteran faces!     The \"Old Brigade\" he loved so well--       The mountain men, who bound him     With bays of their own winning, ere       A tardier fame had crowned him;      The legions who had seen his glance       Across the carnage flashing,     And thrilled to catch his ringing \"_charge_\"       Above the volley crashing;--     Who oft had watched the lifted hand,       The inward trust betraying,     And felt their courage grow sublime,       While they beheld him praying!      Good knights and true as ever drew       Their swords with knightly Roland;     Or died at Sobieski's side,       For love of martyr'd Poland;     Or knelt with Cromwell's Ironsides;       Or sang with brave Gustavus;     Or on the plain of Austerlitz,       Breathed out their dying AVES!      Rare fame! rare name!--If chanted praise,       With all the world to listen,--     If pride that swells a nation's soul,--       If foemen's tears that glisten,--     If pilgrims' shrining love,--if grief       Which nought may soothe or sever,--     If THESE can consecrate,--this spot       Is sacred ground forever!  [A] In the month of June the singular spectacle was presented at Lexington, Va., of two hostile armies, in turn, reverently visiting Jackson's grave.     WHEN THE WAR IS OVER.  A CHRISTMAS LAY.   I.      Ah! the happy Christmas times!       Times we all remember;--     Times that flung a ruddy glow       O'er the gray December;--     Will they never come again,       With their song and story?     Never wear a remnant more       Of their olden glory?     Must the little children miss       Still the festal token?     Must their realm of young romance       All be marred and broken?     Must the mother promise on,       While her smiles dissemble,     And she speaks right quietly,       Lest her voice should tremble:--      \"Darlings! wait till father comes--       Wait--and we'll discover     Never were such Christmas times,       When the war is over!\"   II.      Underneath the midnight sky,       Bright with starry beauty,     Sad, the shivering sentinel       Treads his round of duty:     For his thoughts are far away,       Far from strife and battle,     As he listens dreamingly,       To his baby's prattle;--     As he clasps his sobbing wife,       Wild with sudden gladness,     Kisses all her tears away--       Chides her looks of sadness--     Talks of Christmas nights to come,--       And his step grows lighter,     Whispering, while his stiffening hand       Grasps his musket tighter:--      \"Patience, love!--keep heart! keep hope!       To your weary rover,     What a home our home will be,       When the war is over!\"   III.      By the twilight Christmas fire,       All her senses laden     With a weight of tenderness,       Sits the musing maiden:     From the parlor's cheerful blaze,       Far her visions wander,     To the white tent gleaming bright,       On the hill-side yonder.     Buoyant in her brave, young love,       Flushed with patriot honour,     No misgiving, no fond fear,       Flings its shade upon her.     Though no mortal soul can know       Half the love she"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16480"],["title","Beechenbrook (#7)"],["body","him,     Proudly, for her country's sake,       From her heart she spares him.      --God be thanked!--she does not dream,       That her gallant lover     Will be in a soldier's grave,       When the war is over!   IV.      'Midst the turmoil and the strife       Of the war-tide's rushing,     Every heart its separate woe       In its depths is hushing.     Who has time for tears, when blood       All the land is steeping?     --In our poverty we grudge       Even the waste of weeping!     But when quiet comes again,       And the bands, long broken,     Gather round the hearth, and breathe       Names now seldom spoken--     _Then_ we'll miss the precious links--       Mourn the empty places--     Read the hopeless \"_Nevermore_,\"       In each other's faces!      --Oh! what aching, anguish'd hearts       O'er lone graves will hover,     With a new, fresh sense of pain,       When the war is over!   V.      Stern endurance, bitterer still,       Sharp with self-denial,     Fraught with loftier sacrifice,       Fuller far of trial--     Strews our flinty path of thorns--       Marks our bloody story--     Fits us for the victor's palm--       Weaves our robe of glory!     Shall we faint with God above,       And His strong arm under--     And the cold world gazing on,       In a maze of wonder?     No! with more resistless march,       More resolved endeavor,     Press we onward--struggle still,       Fight and win forever!      --Holy peace will heal all ills,       Joy all losses cover,     Raptures rend our Southern skies,       When the war is over!     VIRGINIA CAPTA.  APRIL 9TH, 1865.   I.      Unconquered captive!--close thine eye,       And draw the ashen sackcloth o'er,       And in thy speechless woe deplore     The fate that would not let thee die!   II.      The arm that wore the shield, strip bare;       The hand that held the martial rein,       And hurled the spear on many a plain--     Stretch--till they clasp the shackles there!   III.      The foot that once could crush the crown,       Must drag the fetters, till it bleed       Beneath their weight:--thou dost not need     It now, to tread the tyrant down.   IV.      Thou thought'st him vanquish'd--boastful trust!       --His lance, in twain--his sword, a wreck--       But with his heel upon thy neck,     He holds _thee_ prostrate in the dust!   V.      Bend though thou must, beneath his will,       Let not one abject moan have place;       But with majestic, silent grace,     Maintain thy regal bearing still.   VI.      Look back through all thy storied past,       And sit erect in conscious pride:--       No grander heroes ever died--     No sterner, battled to the last!   VII.      Weep, if thou wilt, with proud, sad mein,       Thy blasted hopes--thy peace undone,--       Yet brave, live on,--nor seek to shun     Thy fate, like Egypt's conquer'd Queen.   VIII.      Though forced a captive's place to fill,       In the triumphal train,--yet there,       Superbly, like Zenobia, wear     Thy chains,--_Virginia Victrix_ still!"]]]
