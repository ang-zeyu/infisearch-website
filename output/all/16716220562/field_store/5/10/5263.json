Towser is my real live brother, but I don't think he's as old as the              Prince of Wales;     He's a perfect darling, though he whisks everything over he comes              near, and I tell him I don't know what we should do if              we all had tails.     His hair curls like mine in front, and grows short like a lion behind,              but no one need be frightened, for he's as good as good;     And as to roaring like a real menagerie lion, or eating people up,              I don't believe he would if he could.     He has his tea out of the saucer after I've had mine out of the cup;     You see I am sure to leave some for him, but if I let him begin first              he would drink it all up.     The big doll Godmamma gave me this birthday, and the chair she gave me              the year before.     (I haven't many toys, but I take great care of them, and every birthday              I shall have more and more.)     You've no idea what a beautiful doll she is, and when I pinch her in              the middle, she can squeak;     It quite frightened Towser, for he didn't know that any of us but he              and I and Charles were able to speak.     I've taken her for my only sister, for of course I may take anybody              I choose;     I've called her Cinderella, because I'm so fond of the story, and              because she's got real shoes.     I don't feel so _only_ now there are so many of us; for, counting              Cinderella there are five,--     She, and I, and Towser, and Charles, and the Prince of Wales--and              three of us are really alive;     And four of us can speak, and I'm sure the Prince of Wales is              wonderful for his size;     For his things (at least he's only got one thing) take off and on,              and, though he's nothing but wood, he's got real glass eyes.     And perhaps in three birthdays more there may be as many of us as the              Smiths, for five and three make eight;     I shall be seven years old then (as old as Joe), but I don't like              to think too much of it, it's so long to wait.     And after all I don't know that I want any more of us: I think I'd              rather my sister had a chair     Like mine; and the next year I should like a collar for Towser if              it wouldn't rub off his hair.     And it would be very nice if the Prince of Wales could be dressed              like a Field-marshal, for he's got nothing on his legs;     And Cinderella's beautifully dressed, and Towser looks quite as if              he'd got a fur coat on when he begs.     Joe says it's perfectly absurd, and that I can't take a Pomeranian              in earnest for my brother;     But I don't think he really and truly knows how much Towser and I              love each other.     I didn't like his saying, \"Well, there's one thing about your lot,--you              can always have your own way.\"     And then he says, \"You can't possibly have fun with four people when              you have to pretend what they say.\"     But, whatever he says, I don't believe I shall ever enjoy a tea-party              more than the one that we had on that day.         [Illustration]      PAPA POODLE.       Can any one look so wise, and have so little in his head?     How long will it be, Papa Poodle, before you have learned to read?     You were called Papa Poodle because you took care of me when I was              a baby:     And now I can read words of three syllables, and you sit with a book              before you like a regular gaby.     You've not read a word since I put you in that corner ten minutes ago;     Bill and I've fought the battle of Waterloo since dinner, and you've              not learned BA BE BI BO.     Here am I doing the whole British Army by myself, for Bill is obliged              to be the French;     And I've come away to hear you say your lesson, and left Bill waiting              for me in the trench.     And there you sit, with a curly white wig, like the Lord Chief Justice,              and as grave a face,     Looking the very picture of goodness and wisdom, when you're really in              the deepest disgrace.     Those woolly locks of yours grow thicker and thicker, Papa Poodle.     Does the wool tangle inside as well as outside your head? and is it              that which makes you such a noodle?     You seem so clever at some things, and so stupid at others, and I keep              wondering why;     But I'm afraid the truth is, Papa Poodle, that you're uncommonly sly.     You did no spelling-lessons last week, for you were out from morning              till night,     Except when you slunk in, like a dirty door-mat on legs, and with one              ear bleeding from a fight,     Looking as if you'd no notion what o'clock it was, and had come home              to see.     But _your watch keeps very good meal-time_, Papa Poodle, for you're              always at breakfast, and dinner, and tea.     No, it's no good your shaking hands and licking me with your              tongue,--I know you can do that;     But sitting up, and giving paws, and kissing, won't teach you to              spell C A T, Cat.     I wonder, if I let you off lessons, whether I could teach you to pull              the string with your teeth, and fire our new gun?     If I could, you might be the Artillery all to yourself, and it would              be capital fun.     You wag your tail at that, do you? You would like it a great deal              better?     But I can't bear you to be such a dunce, when you look so wise; and              yet I don't believe you'll ever learn a letter.     Aunt Jemima is going to make me a new cocked hat out of the next old              newspaper, for I want to have a review;     But the newspaper after that, Papa Poodle, must be kept to make a              fool's cap for you.         GRANDMOTHER'S SPRING.       \"In my young days,\" the grandmother said (Nodding her head,     Where cap and curls were as white as snow),     \"In my young days, when we used to go                Rambling,                Scrambling;     Each little dirty hand in hand,     Like a chain of daisies, a comical band     Of neighbours' children, seriously straying,     Really and truly going a-Maying,     My mother would bid us linger,     And lifting a slender, straight forefinger,                Would say--     'Little Kings and Queens of the May,                Listen to me!                If you want to be     Every one of you very good     In that beautiful, beautiful, beautiful wood,     Where the little birds' heads get so turned with delight,     That some of them sing all night:                Whatever you pluck,                Leave some for good luck;     Picked from the stalk, or pulled up by the root,     From overhead, or from underfoot,     Water-wonders of pond or brook;                Wherever you look,                And whatever you find--                Leave something behind:                Some for the Naïads,                Some for the Dryads,     And a bit for the Nixies, and the Pixies.'\"      \"After all these years,\" the grandame said,                Lifting her head,     \"I think I can hear my mother's voice                Above all other noise,     Saying, 'Hearken, my child!     There is nothing more destructive and wild,     No wild bull with his horns,     No wild-briar with clutching thorns,     No pig that routs in your garden-bed,     No robber with ruthless tread,                More reckless and rude,     And wasteful of all things lovely and good,     Than a child, with the face of a boy and the ways of a bear,                Who _doesn't care;_     Or some little ignorant minx                Who _never thinks_.     Now I never knew so stupid an elf,     That he couldn't think and care for himself.     Oh, little sisters and little brothers,     Think for others, and care for others!     And of all that your little fingers find,                Leave something behind,     For love of those that come after:     Some, perchance, to cool tired eyes in the moss that stifled your              laughter!                Pluck, children, pluck!                But leave--for good luck--                Some for the Naïads,                And some for the Dryads,     And a bit for the Nixies, and the Pixies!'\"      \"We were very young,\" the grandmother said,           Smiling and shaking her head;           \"And when one is young,     One listens with half an ear, and speaks with a hasty tongue;           So with shouted Yeses,           And promises sealed with kisses,     Hand-in-hand we started again,           A chubby chain,     Stretching the whole wide width of the lane;           Or in broken links of twos and threes,             For greater ease             Of rambling,             And scrambling,           By the stile and the road,     That goes to the beautiful, beautiful wood;           By the brink of the gloomy pond,           To the top of the sunny hill beyond,     By hedge and by ditch, by marsh and by mead,     By little byways that lead               To mysterious bowers;     Or to spots where, for those who know,               There grow,     In certain out-o'-way nooks, rare ferns and uncommon flowers.               There were flowers everywhere,               Censing the summer air,               Till the giddy bees went rolling home               To their honeycomb,               And when we smelt at our posies,     The little fairies inside the flowers rubbed coloured dust on              our noses,     Or pricked us till we cried aloud for snuffing the dear dog-roses.               But above all our noise,               I kept thinking I heard my mother's voice.     But it may have been only a fairy joke,     For she was at home, and I sometimes thought"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16686"],["title","Verses for Children, and Songs for Music (#5)"],["body","was         really the flowers that spoke.               From the Foxglove in its pride,               To the Shepherd's Purse by the bare road-side;     From the snap-jack heart of the Starwort frail,     To meadows full of Milkmaids pale,     And Cowslips loved by the nightingale.     Rosette of the tasselled Hazel-switch,     Sky-blue star of the ditch;               Dandelions like mid-day suns;               Bindweed that runs;     Butter and Eggs with the gaping lips,     Sweet Hawthorn that hardens to haws, and Roses that die into hips;               Lords-with-their-Ladies cheek-by-jowl,               In purple surcoat and pale-green cowl;               Family groups of Primroses fair;               Orchids rare;     Velvet Bee-orchis that never can sting,     Butterfly-orchis which never takes wing,     Robert-the-Herb with strange sweet scent,     And crimson leaf when summer is spent:               Clustering neighbourly,               All this gay company,               Said to us seemingly--               'Pluck, children, pluck!

In that beautiful wood,     To dream that through every woodland noise,               Through the cracking               Of twigs and the bending of bracken,               Through the rustling     Of leaves in the breeze,               And the bustling     Of dark-eyed, tawny-tailed squirrels flitting about the trees,     Through the purling and trickling cool     Of the streamlet that feeds the pool,               I could hear her voice.     Should I wonder to hear it? Why?     Are the voices of tender wisdom apt to die?     And now, though I'm very old,     And the air, that used to feel fresh, strikes chilly and cold,               On a sunny day when I potter               About the garden, or totter     To the seat from whence I can see, below,     The marsh and the meadows I used to know,     Bright with the bloom of the flowers that blossomed there long ago;               Then, as if it were yesterday,               I fancy I hear them say--               'Pluck, children, pluck,               But leave some for good luck;     Picked from the stalk, or pulled up by the root,     From overhead, or from underfoot,     Water-wonders of pond or brook;     Wherever you look,               And whatever your little fingers find,               Leave something behind:               Some for the Naïads,               And some for the Dryads,     And a bit for the Nixies, and the Pixies.'\"       The following note was given in _Aunt Judy's Magazine_, June     1880, when \"Grandmother's Spring\" first appeared:--\"It may     interest old readers of _Aunt Judy's Magazine_ to know that     'Leave some for the Naïads and the Dryads' was a favourite     phrase with Mr. Alfred Gatty, and is not merely the charge of     an imaginary mother to her 'blue-eyed banditti.' Whether my     mother invented the expression for our benefit, or whether she     only quoted it, I do not know. I only remember its use as a     check on the indiscriminate 'collecting' and 'grubbing' of a     large family; a mystic warning not without force to fetter the     same fingers in later life, with all the power of a pious              tradition.\"--J.H.E.         [Illustration]      BIG SMITH.       Are you a Giant, great big man, or is your real name Smith?     Nurse says you've got a hammer that you hit bad children with.     I'm good to-day, and so I've come to see if it is true     That you can turn a red-hot rod into a horse's shoe.      Why do you make the horses' shoes of iron instead of leather?     Is it because they are allowed to go out in bad weather?     If horses should be shod with iron, Big Smith, will you shoe mine?     For now I may not take him out, excepting when it's fine.      Although he's not a real live horse, I'm very fond of him;     His harness won't take off and on, but still it's new and trim.     His tail is hair, he has four legs, but neither hoofs nor heels;     I think he'd seem more like a horse without these yellow wheels.      They say that Dapple-grey's not yours, but don't you wish he were?     My horse's coat is only paint, but his is soft grey hair;     His face is big and kind, like yours, his forelock white as snow--     Shan't you be sorry when you've done his shoes and he must go?      I do so wish, Big Smith, that I might come and live with you;     To rake the fire, to heat the rods, to hammer two and two.     To be so black, and not to have to wash unless I choose;     To pat the dear old horses, and to mend their poor old shoes.      When all the world is dark at night, you work among the stars,     A shining shower of fireworks beat out of red-hot bars.     I've seen you beat, I've heard you sing, when I was going to bed;     And now your face and arms looked black, and now were glowing red.      The more you work, the more you sing, the more the bellows roar;     The falling stars, the flying sparks, stream shining more and more.     You hit so hard, you look so hot, and yet you never tire;     It must be very nice to be allowed to play with fire.      I long to beat and sing and shine, as you do, but instead     I put away my horse, and Nurse puts me away to bed.     I wonder if you go to bed; I often think I'll keep     Awake and see, but, though I try, I always fall asleep.      I know it's very silly, but I sometimes am afraid     Of being in the dark alone, especially in bed.     But when I see your forge-light come and go upon the wall,     And hear you through the window, I am not afraid at all.      I often hear a trotting horse, I sometimes hear it stop;     I hold my breath--you stay your song--it's at the blacksmith's shop.     Before it goes, I'm apt to fall asleep, Big Smith, it's true;     But then I dream of hammering that horse's shoes with you!         KIT'S CRADLE.       They've taken the cosy bed away     That I made myself with the Shetland shawl,     And set me a hamper of scratchy hay,     By that great black stove in the entrance-hall.      [Illustration]      I won't sleep there; I'm resolved on that!     They may think I will, but they little know     There's a soft persistence about a cat     That even a little kitten can show.      I wish I knew what to do but pout,     And spit at the dogs and refuse my tea;     My fur's feeling rough, and I rather doubt     Whether stolen sausage agrees with me.      On the drawing-room sofa they've closed the door,     They've turned me out of the easy-chairs;     I wonder it never struck me before     That they make their beds for themselves up-stairs.         *       *       *       *       *      I've found a crib where they won't find me,     Though they're crying \"Kitty!\" all over the house.     Hunt for the Slipper! and riddle-my-ree!     A cat can keep as still as a mouse.      It's rather unwise perhaps to purr,     But they'll never think of the wardrobe-shelves.     I'm happy in every hair of my fur;     They may keep the hamper and hay themselves.      [Illustration]         THE MILL STREAM.       One of a hundred little rills--           Born in the hills,     Nourished with dews by the earth, and with tears by the sky,           Sang--\"Who so mighty as I?           The farther I flow           The bigger I grow.     I, who was born but a little rill,     Now turn the big wheel of the mill,     Though the surly slave would rather stand still.         Old, and weed-hung, and grim,         I am not afraid of him;     For when I come running and dance on his toes,     With a creak and a groan the monster goes.           And turns faster and faster,           As he learns who is master,           Round and round,           Till the corn is ground,     And the miller smiles as he stands on the bank,     And knows he has me to thank.     Then when he swings the fine sacks of flour,            I feel my power;     But when the children enjoy their food,     I know I'm not only great but good!\"      Furthermore sang the brook--     \"Who loves the beautiful, let him look!     Garlanding me in shady spots            The Forget-me-nots     Are blue as the summer sky:            Who so lovely as I?     My King-cups of gold     Shine from the shade of the alders old,            Stars of the stream!--     At the water-rat's threshold they gleam.            From below     The Frog-bit spreads me its blossoms of snow,            And in masses     The Willow-herb, the flags, and the grasses,            Reeds, rushes, and sedges,     Flower and fringe and feather my edges.            To be beautiful is not amiss,     But to be loved is more than this;     And who more sought than I,     By all that run or swim or crawl or fly?     Sober shell-fish and frivolous gnats,            Tawny-eyed water-rats;     The poet with rippling rhymes so fluent,     Boys with boats playing truant,     Cattle wading knee-deep for water;     And the flower-plucking parson's daughter.     Down in my depths dwell creeping things     Who rise from my bosom on rainbow wings,     For--too swift for a school-boy's prize--     Hither and thither above me dart the prismatic-hued dragon-flies.     At my side the lover lingers,     And with lack-a-daisical fingers,     The Weeping Willow, woe-begone,     Strives to stay me as I run on.\"      There came an hour     When all this beauty and love and power              Did seem     But a small thing to that Mill Stream.              And then his cry         Was, \"Why, oh! why         Am I thus surrounded     With checks and limits, and bounded            By bank and border            To keep me in order,               Against my will?     I, who was born to be free and unfettered--a mountain rill!         But for "]]]
