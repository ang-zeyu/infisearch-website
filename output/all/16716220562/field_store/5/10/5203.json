For them at night we kneel and pray.     Be with them, Lord, who serve the truth,     And make us worthy of our youth!      Here mother-love and father-love       Unite in love of country now;     Here to the flag that flies above,       Our heads we reverently bow;     Here as one people, night and day,     For victory we work and pray.      Nor race nor creed shall difference make,       Nor bigot mar the zealot's plan;     We give our all for Freedom's sake,       Each man a king, each king a man.     Make us the equal, Lord, we pray     Of them who die for truth to-day!      Let us as gladly give our best,       Let us as bravely pay the price     As they, who in the bitter test       Meet the supremest sacrifice.     Oh, God! Wherever we are led,     Let us be worthy of our dead!      Let us not compromise the truth,       Let us not cringe so much in fear     That foes may whisper to our youth       That we have failed in courage here.     Lord, strengthen us, that they may know     Our spirits follow where they go!                  Why We Fight       This is the thing we fight:     A cry of terror in the night;     A ship on work of mercy bent--       A carrier of the sick and maimed--     Beneath the cruel waters sent,       And those that did it, unashamed.      A woman who had tried to fill     A mother's place; had nursed the ill     And soothed the troubled brows of pain       And earned the dying's grateful prayers,     Before a wall by soldiers slain!       And such a poor pretext was theirs!      Old women pierced by bayonets grim     And babies slaughtered for a whim,     Cathedrals made the sport of shells,       No mercy, even for a child,     As though the imps of all the hells       Were crazed with drink and running wild.      All this we fight--that some day when     Good sense shall come again to men,     Our children's children may not read       This age's history thus defamed     And find we served a selfish creed       And ever be of us ashamed!                  America       God has been good to men. He gave     His Only Son their souls to save,     And then he made a second gift,     Which from their dreary lives should lift     The tyrant's yoke and set them free     From all who'd throttle liberty.     He gave America to men--     Fashioned this land we love, and then     Deep in her forests sowed the seed     Which was to serve man's earthly need.      When wisps of smoke first upwards curled     From pilgrim fires, upon the world     Unnoticed and unseen, began     God's second work of grace for man.     Here where the savage roamed and fought,     God sowed the seed of nobler thought;     Here to the land we love to claim,     The pioneers of freedom came;     Here has been cradled all that's best     In every human mind and breast.      For full four hundred years and more     Our land has stretched her welcoming shore     To weary feet from soils afar;     Soul-shackled serfs of king and czar     Have journeyed here and toiled and sung     And talked of freedom to their young,     And God above has smiled to see     This precious work of liberty,     And watched this second gift He gave     The dreary lives of men to save.      And now, when liberty's at bay,     And blood-stained tyrants force the fray,     Worn warriors, battling for the right,     Crushed by oppression's cruel might,     Hear in the dark through which they grope     America's glad cry of hope:     Man's liberty is not to die!     America is standing by!     World-wide shall human lives be free:     America has crossed the sea!      America! the land we love!     God's second gift from Heaven above,     Builded and fashioned out of truth,     Sinewed by Him with splendid youth     For that glad day when shall be furled     All tyrant flags throughout the world.     For this our banner holds the sky:     That liberty shall never die.     For this, America began:     To make a brotherhood of man.             The Time for Deeds       We have boasted our courage in moments of ease,     Our star-spangled banner we've flung on the breeze;     We have taught men to cheer for its beauty and worth,     And have called it the flag of the bravest on earth     Now the dark days are here, we must stand to the test.     Oh, God! let us prove we are true to our best!      We have drunk to our flag, and we've talked of the right,     We have challenged oppression to show us its might;     We have strutted for years through the world as a race     That for God and for country, earth's tyrants would face;     Now the gage is flung down, hate is loosed in the world.     Oh, God! shall our flag in dishonor be furled?      We have said we are brave; we have preached of the truth,     We have walked in conceit of the strength of our youth;     We have mocked at the ramparts and guns of the foe,     As though we believed we could laugh them all low.     Now oppression has struck! We are challenged to fight!     Oh, God! let us prove we can stand for the right!      If in honor and glory our flag is to wave,     If we are to keep this--the land of the brave;     If more than fine words are to fashion our creeds,     Now must our hands and our hearts turn to deeds.     We are challenged by tyrants our strength to reveal!     Oh, God! let us prove that our courage is real!             Everywhere in America       Not somewhere in America, but everywhere to-day,     Where snow-crowned mountains hold their heads,          the vales where children play,     Beside the bench and whirring lathe, on every          lake and stream     And in the depths of earth below, men share a          common dream--     The dream our brave forefathers had of freedom          and of right,     And once again in honor's cause, they rally and          unite.      Not somewhere in America is love of country          found,     But east and west and north and south once          more the bugles sound,     And once again, as one, men stand to break          their brother's chains,     And make the world a better place, where only          justice reigns.     The patriotism that is here, is echoed over there,     The hero at a certain post is on guard everywhere.     O'er humble home and mansion rich the starry          banner flies,     And far and near throughout the land the men          of valor rise.      The flag that flutters o'er your home is fluttering          far away     O'er homes that you have never seen. The same          impulses sway     The souls of men in distant states. The red, the          white and blue     Means to one hundred million strong, just what          it means to you.     The self-same courage resolute you feel and          understand     Is throbbing in the breasts of men throughout          this mighty land.     Not somewhere in America, but everywhere to-day,     For justice and for liberty all free men work          and pray.             The Things That Make a Soldier Great       The things that make a soldier great and send him out to die,     To face the flaming cannon's mouth, nor ever question why,     Are lilacs by a little porch, the row of tulips red,     The peonies and pansies, too, the old petunia bed,     The grass plot where his children play, the roses on the wall:     'Tis these that make a soldier great. He's fighting for them all.      'Tis not the pomp and pride of kings that make a soldier brave;     'Tis not allegiance to the flag that over him may wave;     For soldiers never fight so well on land or on the foam     As when behind the cause they see the little place called home.     Endanger but that humble street whereon his children run--     You make a soldier of the man who never bore a gun.      What is it through the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16632"],["title","Over Here (#1)"],["body","smoke the valiant soldier sees?     The little garden far away, the budding apple trees,     The little patch of ground back there, the children at their play,     Perhaps a tiny mound behind the simple church of gray.     The golden thread of courage isn't linked to castle dome     But to the spot, where'er it be--the humble spot called home.      And now the lilacs bud again and all is lovely there,     And homesick soldiers far away know spring is in the air;     The tulips come to bloom again, the grass once more is green,     And every man can see the spot where all his joys have been.     He sees his children smile at him, he hears the bugle call,     And only death can stop him now--he's fighting for them all.             The Flag       We never knew how much the Flag       Could mean, until he went away,     We used to boast of it and brag,       As something of a by-gone day;     But now the Flag can start our tears       In moments of our greatest joy,     Old Glory in the sky appears       The symbol of our little boy.      We knew that sometimes people wept       To see the Flag go waving by,     But never guessed the griefs they kept--       We never understood just why.     But now our eyes grow quickly dim,       Our voices choke with sobs to-day;     The Flag is telling us of him,       Our little boy who's gone away.      We never knew the Flag could be       So much a part of human life,     We thought it beautiful to see       Before these bitter days of strife;     But now more beautiful it gleams,       And deeper in our hearts it dwells;     It is the emblem of our dreams,       For of our little boy it tells.             A Battle Prayer       God of battles, be with us now:       Guard our sons from the lead of shame,       Watch our sons when the cannons flame,     Let them not to a tyrant bow.      God of battles, to Thee we pray:       Be with each loyal son who fights       In the cause of justice and human rights,     Grant him strength and lead the way.      God of battles, our youth we give       To the battle line on a foreign soil,       To conquer hatred and lust and spoil;     Grant that they and their cause shall live.             Good Luck       Good luck! That's all I'm saying, as you sail across the sea;     The best o' luck, in the parting, is the prayer you get from me.     May you never meet a danger that you won't come safely through,     May you never meet a German that can get the best of you;     Oh! A thousand things may happen when a fellow's at the front,     A thousand different mishaps, but here's hoping that they won't.      Good luck! That's all I'm saying, as you turn away to go,     Good luck and plenty of it, may it be your lot to know;     May you never meet rough weather, but remember if you do     That the folks at home are wishing that you'll all come safely through.     Oh! A thousand things may happen when a fellow bears the brunt     Of His Country's fight for glory, but I'm praying that they won't.      Good luck! That's all I'm saying as you're falling into line;     May the splendor of your service bring you everything that's fine;     May the fates deal kindly with you, may you never know distress,     And may every task you tackle end triumphant with success.     Oh! A thousand things may happen that with joy your life will fill;     You may not get all the gladness, but I'm hoping that you will.             A Prayer, 1918       Oh, make us worthy,       God, we pray,     To do thy service       Here to-day;     Endow us with       The strength we need     For every       Sacrificial deed!             The Change       'Twas hard to think that he must go,     We knew that we should miss him so,     We thought that he must always stay     Beside us, laughing, day by day;     That he must never know the care     And hurt and grief of life out there.     Then came the call for youth, and he     Talked with his mother and with me,     And suddenly we learned the boy     Was hungering to know the joy     Of doing something real with life,     And that he craved the test of strife.      And so we steeled ourselves to dread;     To see at night his empty bed;     To feel the silence and the gloom     That hovers o'er his vacant room,     And though we wept the day he went,     And many a lonely hour we've spent,     We've come to think as he, somehow,     And we are more contented now;     We're proud that we can stand and say     We have a boy who's gone away.     And we are glad to know that he     Is serving where he ought to be.      It's queer, the change that time has brought:     We're different now in speech and thought;     His letters home mean joy to us,     His difficulties we discuss.     When word of his promotion came,     His mother, with her eyes aflame     With happiness and pride, rushed out     To tell the neighbors round about.     Her boy! Her boy is doing well!     What greater news can mothers tell?     I think that pity now we show     For those who have no boys to go.             Mothers and Wives       Mothers and wives, 'tis the call to arms       That the bugler yonder prepares to sound;     We stand on the brink of war's alarms       And your men may lie on a blood-stained          ground.     The drums may play and the flags may fly,       And our boys may don the brown and blue,     And the call that summons brave men to die       Is the call for glorious women, too.      Mothers and wives, if the summons comes,       You, as ever since war has been,     Must hear with courage the rolling drums       And dry your tears when the flags are seen.     For never has hero fought and died       Who has braver been than the mother, who     Buckled his saber at his side,       And sent him forward to dare and do.      Mothers and wives, should the call ring out,       It is you must answer your country's cry;     You must furnish brave hearts and stout       For the firing line where the heroes die.     And never a corpse on the field of strife       Should be honored more in his country's sight     Than the noble mother or noble wife       Who sent him forth in the cause of right.      Mothers and wives, 'tis the call for men       To give their strength and to give their lives;     But well we know, such a summons then       Is the call for mothers and loyal wives,     For you must give us the strength we need,       You must give us the boys in blue,     For never a boy or a man shall bleed       But a mother or wife shall suffer, too.             The Call to Service       These are the days when little thoughts       Must cease men's minds to occupy;     The nation needs men's larger creeds,       Big men must answer to her cry;     No longer selfish ways we tread,       The greater task lies just ahead.      These are the days when petty things       By all men must be thrust aside;     The country needs men's finest deeds,       Awakened is the nation's pride;     Men must forsake their selfish strife       Once more to guard their country's life.             Kelly Ingram       His name was Kelly Ingram; he was Alabama's son,     And he whistled \"Yankee Doodle,\" as he stood beside his gun;     There was laughter in his make-up, there was manhood in his face,     And he knew the best traditions and the courage of his race;     Now there's not a heart among us but should swell with loyal pride     When he thinks of Kelly Ingram and the splendid way he died.      On the swift Destroyer Cassin he was merely gunner's mate,     But up there to-day, I fancy, he is standing with the great.     On that grim day last October his position on the craft     Was that portion of the vessel which the sailors christen aft;     There were deep sea bombs beside him to be dropped upon the Hun     Who makes women folks his victims and then gloats o'er what he's done.      From the lookout came a warning; came the cry all sailors fear,     A torpedo was approaching, and the vessel's doom was near;     Ingram saw the streak of danger, but he saw a little more,     A greater menace faced them than that missile had in store;     If those deep sea bombs beside him were not thrown beneath the wave,     Every man aboard the Cassin soon would find a watery grave.      It was death for him to linger, but he figured if he ran     And quit his post of duty, 'twould be death for every man;     So he stood at his position, threw those depth bombs overboard,     And when that torpedo struck them, he went forth to meet his Lord.     Oh, I don't know how to say it, but these whole United States     Should remember Kelly Ingram--he who died to save his mates.             The Joy to Be       Oh, mother, be you brave of heart and keep          your bright eyes shining;     Some day the smiles of joy shall start and you          shall cease repining.     Beyond the dim and distant line the days of          peace are waiting,     When you shall have your soldier fine, and men          shall turn from hating.      Oh, mother, bear the pain a-while, as long ago          you bore it;     You suffered then to win his smile, and you          were happier for it;     And now you suffer once again, and bear your          weight of sorrow;     Yet you shall thrill with gladness when he wins          the glad to-morrow.      Oh, mother, when the cannons roar and all the          brave are fighting,     Remember that the son you bore the wrongs          of earth is righting;     Remember through the hours of pain that he          with all his brothers     Is battling there to win again a happy world          for mothers.             He Should Meet a Mother There       If he should meet a mother there       Along some winding Flanders road,     No extra touch of grief or care       He'll add unto her heavy load.     But he will kindly take her arm       And tender as her son will be;     He'll lead her from the path of harm       Because of me.      Be she the mother "]]]
