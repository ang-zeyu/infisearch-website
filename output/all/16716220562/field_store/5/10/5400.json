This was to give free play to their arms in flinging their javelins.  The occasion was one in which the fate of the explorers depended upon their promptness and bravery.  Anything like timidity or hesitation meant sure destruction, and the whites knew it.  \"Into the boat!\" commanded Ashman, addressing Bippo and his friends.  The words were like an electric shock to the helpers, who instantly clambered into the canoe and lay flat behind the luggage, where they were safe from the poisoned missiles that would soon be flying through the air.  Those natives, with their crude weapons, were only incumbrances in a crisis like the present.  The whites exchanged but a word or two and then opened the ball.  A savage, evidently the leader, and one who probably now saw the whites for the first time, had the audacity to step forward a couple of paces, and with a yell of defiance, raised his spear over his head.  Before he could launch the missile Jared Long sent a bullet through him, and then, shifting the muzzle of his Winchester toward the line of dusky figures, he blazed away as fast as he could sight the weapon and pull the trigger.  At the same instant the Professor and Ashman opened, and the bombardment which followed was enough to strike terror to the hearts of a hundred men.  It was more than the savages could stand, but, great as was their panic, most of them hurled one or two javelins apiece at the white men who stood fearlessly erect and combated them.  They had come from their village prepared for a fight, and each warrior was provided with several of the poisoned missiles.  Before the explorers had emptied the magazines of their Winchesters not a live foe was left.  The affrighted survivors, shrieking with terror, scrambled hastily back among the trees, some of them dragging the dead bodies, so that the spot was freed of the dusky miscreants with as much suddenness as it had been occupied by them.  There were plenty of shots left, and, after the disappearance of the savages, the whites fired into the woods, where they had vanished, not with the expectation of accomplishing anything more than adding to the panic.  When it was sure the wretches were gone, our friends made their preparations for leaving the spot, for nothing was clearer than that such was the wisest step to take.  It will be borne in mind that all the trouble had taken place on the left bank of the Xingu, no savages having been observed on the western bank.  The daring of the savages could not be questioned.  They had faced death repeatedly, and now, that they had the strongest of all motives--revenge--to prompt them, they were sure to use every means possible to bring about the ruin of the whites and their three native companions.  The forest, extending so close to the river, was a constant menace, for it afforded the best kind of shelter.  Indeed, had the savages been less courageous and kept among the trees, taking a stealthy shot as the chance offered, they would have had a much better chance of doing what they wished and with less risk to themselves.  The javelins flung in blind desperation went wide of their mark, with the exception of one which whizzed over the canoe within a few inches of Bippo's head.  The fellow was peeping furtively above the luggage, and heard the whizz of the missile passing fearfully close.  He instantly ducked with such emphasis that he almost broke his nose against the bottom of the craft.  Striking the water beyond, the spear sank as abruptly as if it were a cannon ball.  The belief of our friends was that the troublesome natives were entirely confined to the left bank, though it was not likely they refrained from crossing so narrow a stream as the Xingu at its upper portion.  If the savages had been slow to learn from their first experience with the white men, there could be no doubt that the valuable lesson of the last encounter would not be lost upon them.  The space between the edge of the wood and the margin of the river was so slight that it was the easiest thing in the world for one of them to launch his javelin with terrific force across it, and they would do so before morning, if the chance were given them.  If the other bank were reached, the savages would be easily detected in the bright moonlight, if they attempted to swim across or used some of their own boats.  The only way in which they could avoid detection would be by crossing above or below this point.  They would hardly ascend the Xingu for this purpose, since the rapids would oblige them to travel a long way, and the place of ferryage, therefore, was likely to be below the campfire.  Such were the views of the whites, as they shoved the canoe into the stream, and stepping within, seized the paddles, which the helpers were too frightened to use effectively, while so near the dreaded shore.  Fred Ashman had taken but a few strokes when he handed the implement to Bippo and ordered him to use it.  Then, resuming his Winchester, he faced the land, half suspecting they would not be allowed to reach the other side without some demonstration on the part of their fierce antagonists.  Time was of the first importance, and all the paddles in the craft were plied with the utmost possible vigor, each yard passed adding to the hope that hostilities were over for the time.  Probably three-fourths of the distance was accomplished, when a low exclamation from Ashman caused all to cease paddling and gaze at the shore which he was watching with such interest.  The most gigantic savage yet seen had emerged from the forest trail, but instead of advancing to the river's edge, he halted just far enough from the wood to allow the moonlight to inclose him.  He was thus in almost as plain-sight as if it were mid-day.  He stood in silent contemplation of the strangers that had invaded his dominions and given his people such a dear lesson.  Confident that he could accomplish no harm, even if he wished to try it, Ashman refrained from firing, while the company surveyed him with a feeling akin to admiration.  He was over six feet in height and of massive proportions.  He would have been an ugly customer in a tussle where the conditions were equal, and Ashman could not forbear the thought that he was one of the contestants in the frightful sport he had witnessed near the village. If so, there was little doubt that he was hailed the champion.  It may have been that he had hastened along the forest path, burning with a desire to assail the mysterious beings who had used his countrymen so ill, and he was filled with chagrin and disappointment that he had arrived too late.  But there was no end to the fancies that might be formed concerning him.  That there was little imagination about Bippo was shown by his timid request to his masters to shoot the savage.  To Bippo the elimination of a single enemy of such formidable mien was a consummation devoutly to be prayed for.  But the Professor reminded the native that they only slew in self-defense.  All at once, the herculean savage was seen to make a motion of his arm, and before the act could be understood, the terrified Bippo called out that he was about to throw his javelin.  At the same instant he and his two companions cowered in the bottom of the boat, where they were abundantly protected.  \"The poor fellow is disappointed,\" laughed Ashman, \"and he must show his anger, even if it requires the loss of one of his----\"  Something like the flitting of a bird's wing whisked so close to the speaker's face that he involuntarily threw back his head.  At the same instant, a heavy javelin crashed through the side of the boat, as if it were cardboard, and splashed out of sight in the water beyond.  The missile of the gigantic savage had passed between Ashman and the Professor, missing both by a few inches.  The young man, like a flash, brought his rifle to his shoulder and sighted at the savage who was still in plain sight, as if defying the whites to do their worst.  But Ashman did not pull the trigger.  Lowering his weapon, he said:  \"You have earned your life.\"     CHAPTER X.  DOUBLE-GUARDED.  The native who had made the wonderful throw of the javelin stood a moment longer, and then as if satisfied that he could do no more, he turned about and disappeared.  Fortunately, the missile had struck the upper part of the canoe, through which it tore a jagged hole several inches wide, and a short distance above the water.  The injury could be easily repaired, and at present required no attention.  The paddles were again called into play, and the prow of the craft gently touched shore.  Having reached the right bank, the explorers had something to think of beside the savages whom they hoped were left behind for good.  Two white men were known to be in the neighborhood, and there was warrant for believing they were as hostile as the natives from whom our friends had had such a narrow escape.  With their superior intelligence, there was more to be feared from them than from the brave but ignorant savages; but, at the same time, it was to be hoped they might be conciliated, and that, if not, they would fight without the use of the fearful implements used by the savages, who held human life in such light esteem.  On the other hand, the explorers were too sensible to believe they had seen the last of the warriors that had proven their daring and ferocity.  It was decided to leave all the luggage in the canoe which was held so lightly against the bank that it could be shoved into the river at an instant's need.  No fire was to be kindled, although the entire party left the boat and advanced to the edge of the wood, beneath whose shelter they seated themselves on the ground.  The night which they had hoped would afford them much needed rest, promised to be most exhausting in its requirements.  It had been the custom of the explorers, when camping on their way to the Matto"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16855"],["title","The Land of Mystery (#8)"],["body","rosso, to have at all times a couple of their number on guard, the night being divided into two watches.  For the first five hundred miles, after leaving the Amazon, this precaution was mainly to provide against the wild animals, that were always prowling around camp, and often showed a curiosity to make the acquaintance of the sleepers, and especially of their supplies.  The white men held an earnest consultation, while occupied in eating their evening meal or lunch.  Had they deemed it prudent to kindle a fire, they would have prepared some fragrant coffee, of which they carried an abundance, though plenty of the little berries were encountered growing wild along the Xingu.  But that much-relished refreshment was now dispensed with, and they ate their fruit and a slight quantity of dried meat in darkness.  The fish in the river was an unfailing source of supply, but that species of food also required fire in its preparation, and was therefore out of the question for the time.  Their latitude was about fifteen degrees south, the temperature being so mild that the whites could have got along very well with as scanty raiment as their native helpers, though, as has been intimated, they clung to a civilized costume.  They wore broad Panama hats, flannel shirts, with no coats or vests, and strong duck trousers thrust into their bootlegs.  Thus attired, they were probably as comfortable as they could be.  A belt around the waist contained a supply of cartridges for their Winchesters and revolvers, besides affording a resting place for the knives, the indispensible Smith & Wesson being carried in the hip pocket, after the usual fashion.  In view of the unusual peril threatening the party, extra precautions were taken against surprise.  It was arranged that Quincal and Jared Long should mount guard until midnight, when they would give way to Pedros and the professor.  This would leave Bippo and Ashman free from any duty, their turn to come the following night.  Ashman, however, insisted on taking a part which was somewhat original in its nature.  He was confident that if the savages found it impracticable to cross the Xingu in sight of the explorers, they would pass down stream and endeavor to do so, at a point where they could not be observed by those in camp.  He meant, therefore, to station himself so as to be able to detect such a movement.  With his repeating rifle at command, he was sanguine of defeating the attempt, even though made by a score of enemies.  But for the peculiar contour of the banks on both sides, the whites could have done much better by simply paddling the canoe a quarter of a mile down the river and then hiding under the overhanging vegetation; but it has been explained that the Xingu, when its volume was swelled by rain, had swept the shores with such violence that they were bare for a dozen feet from the water.  Such a movement, therefore, would have to be made in the full light of the moon, and would, therefore, be plainly perceptible from the opposite bank--a fact which rendered the precaution of no avail.  All conceded the wisdom of Ashman's plan.  The Professor urged him in case he found himself growing drowsy, to return at once to camp and allow one of his friends to take his place.  The young man gave his promise, and, bidding them good-by, he began stealing down the stream, keeping as closely within the wall of shadow as he could, and advancing with as much care as though he saw the fierce savages across the Xingu watching for just such a movement.  The peculiar nature of the ground rendered progress easy, and he paused after going about a furlong, believing he had advanced sufficiently far to accomplish what he wished.  The essential work of Ashman was to cover one-half the distance between him and the camp, the further half being under the surveillance of the guards on duty there.  Since he could also overlook the stream equally far in the opposite direction, it will be seen that the savages would have to make their crossing nearly a fourth of a mile below the camp to escape observation.  All this was on the theory that the lone sentinel was really able to scan the space with sufficient clearness to detect anything of the nature apprehended, and that the savages themselves had no suspicion of any such extra care on the part of their enemies.  The astonishing brilliancy of the moonlight will be appreciated, when it is stated that Ashman felt not the least doubt of his ability to meet every requirement of his self-assumed duty.  Well aware, from previous experience, of the insidious approach of slumber to the most vigilant sentinel, when unable to keep in motion, he avoided sitting down, even though he never felt more wakeful.  So long as he stood erect, there was no danger of his lapsing into unconsciousness.  Another indispensable requirement was that he should not be tempted into venturing from the shadow where he stood, for such an act was liable to bring about discovery and defeat the very object that had brought him thither.  The moon was so nearly in the zenith that the shade from the edge of the forest did not project halfway across the open space to which we have alluded.  It was in this partial gloom that the young man took his station, placing himself as far back as he could without standing among the trees themselves.  He was in the position of one who feels that the lives of his dearest friends are placed in his hands.  To him, nothing was more evident than that the revengeful savages would attempt to cross the stream and make another stealthy attack upon the camp.  They surely must feel enough dread of the terrible weapons that had wrought such havoc, not to defy them again, but would make their next demonstration in the nature of a flank movement.  One fact caused Ashman some surprise; he had seen nothing of any canoes or boats, which were plentiful along the shores of the Xingu below.  It was not to be supposed that such a powerful and brave tribe as those on the other side, would live in a country abounding in streams, without finding need of such craft.  But because he had not seen them, was no proof that they were not in existence.  They may have been drawn up among the trees, their precise location known only to their owners.  The prospect of holding his place for several hours, with his senses at a high tension, was not an inviting one, for he did not expect the savages to make their attempt before midnight; all such people aiming to surprise their enemies when wrapped in profound slumber.  But Ashman had not been at his station a half hour, when, to his amazement, he discovered that something was going on across the river directly opposite.  Despite the strong moonlight, he was unable to guess for a long time what it meant.  He first heard a splash, as though a body had fallen or been thrown into the water, and then, for several minutes, everything was still as before.  It was a source of annoyance to him that at this moment, when he hoped to keep his attention fixed on matters on the other bank, he should be disturbed by a sound among the trees directly behind him.  He, turned sharply and looked around, for the noise which had caught his attention was a footfall beyond all question.  But, if the youth was to be taken between two fires, he was ready.  The stranger nearest him could have no thought of his proximity, or he would have taken more care to suppress any noise.  Since he was so much nearer than him on the other side.  Ashman was forced to give his whole attention for the moment to the former's approach.  His suspense was brief, for while he stood with rifle ready, a large puma, or American lion, emerged from a point a couple of rods away, walked in his stealthy fashion to the edge of the river and began lapping the water.  Ashman wished nothing with him in view of more important business elsewhere, and he, therefore, stepped softly back in the wood, before the beast finished drinking.  The puma quickly slaked his thirst, and then, raising his head, looked about him with an inquiring stare as though he scented something suspicious.  He gazed toward the other shore and finally swung himself lightly around, and trotted back to the forest.  Just before entering, he abruptly stopped and looked toward the spot where Ashman was concealed.  He offered a tempting shot, but it hardly need be said that the young man restrained himself, and the next minute the beast vanished.     CHAPTER XI.  A MYSTIFIED SENTINEL.  Jared Long, the New Englander, and Quincal, the native helper, were the sentinels on duty in the immediate vicinity of the camp.  The professor was wearied from a hard day's work, and, feeling that everything possible had been done for the safety of all, stretched out upon his blanket on the soft ground and was soon asleep.  He expected to assume his duty as guardsman in the course of a few hours, and needed all the rest he could get before that time.  Bippo and Pedros were so disturbed by what they had witnessed, that, though they lay down at the same time, it was a good while before they closed their eyes in slumber.  Their homes were near the mouth of the Xingu, and, even at that remote point, they had heard so many fearful accounts of the ferocious savages that infested the upper portions of the river, that they never would have dared to help in an attempt to explore the region but for the liberal pay promised, and their unbounded faith in the white men and their firearms.  The poor fellows would have given all they had, or expected to have, to be transported down the Xingu and out of the reach of the terrible natives who used their poisoned arrows and javelins with such effect; but, behold! the explorers, undaunted by what had taken place, had no thought of turning back, but were resolved to push on for an unknown distance, and Bippo and his friends had no choice but to go with them, for to run away would insure certain death at the hands of these "]]]
