Science defines man as immortal, as coexistent and coeternal with God, as made in His own image and likeness; material sense defines life as something apart from God, beginning and ending, and man as very far from the divine likeness. Science reveals Life as a complete sphere, as eternal, self-existent Mind; material sense defines life as a broken sphere, as organized matter, and mind as something separate from God. Science reveals Spirit as All, averring that there is nothing beside God; material sense says that matter, His antipode, is something besides God. Material sense adds that the divine Spirit created matter, and that matter and evil are as real as Spirit and good.  Christian Science reveals God and His idea as the All and Only. It declares that evil is the absence of good; whereas, good is God ever-present, and therefore evil is unreal and good is all that is real. Christian Science saith to the wave and storm, \"Be still,\" and there is a great calm. Material sense asks, in its ignorance of Science, \"When will the raging of the material elements cease?\" Science saith to all manner of disease, \"Know that God is all-power and all-presence, and there is nothing beside Him;\" and the sick are healed. Material sense saith, \"Oh, when will my sufferings cease? Where is God? Sickness is something besides Him, which He cannot, or does not, heal.\"  Christian Science is the only sure basis of harmony. Material sense contradicts Science, for matter and its so-called organizations take no cognizance of the spiritual facts of the universe, or of the real man and God. Christian Science declares that there is but one Truth, Life, Love, but one Spirit, Mind, Soul. Any attempt to divide these arises from the fallibility of sense, from mortal man's ignorance, from enmity to God and divine Science.  Christian Science declares that sickness is a belief, a latent fear, made manifest on the body in different forms of fear or disease. This fear is formed unconsciously in the silent thought, as when you awaken from sleep and feel ill, experiencing the effect of a fear whose existence you do not realize; but if you fall asleep, actually conscious of the truth of Christian Science,--namely, that man's harmony is no more to be invaded than the rhythm of the universe,--you cannot awake in fear or suffering of any sort.  Science saith to fear, \"You are the cause of all sickness; but you are a self-constituted falsity,--you are darkness, nothingness. You are without 'hope, and without God in the world.' You do not exist, and have no right to exist, for 'perfect Love casteth out fear.'\"  God is everywhere. \"There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard;\" and this voice is Truth that destroys error and Love that casts out fear.  Christian Science reveals the fact that, if suffering exists, it is in the mortal mind only, for matter has no sensation and cannot suffer.  If you rule out every sense of disease and suffering from mortal mind, it cannot be found in the body.  Posterity will have the right to demand that Christian Science be stated and demonstrated in its godliness and grandeur,--that however little be taught or learned, that little shall be right. Let there be milk for babes, but let not the milk be adulterated. Unless this method be pursued, the Science of Christian healing will again be lost, and human suffering will increase.  Test Christian Science by its effect on society, and you will find that the views here set forth--as to the illusion of sin, sickness, and death--bring forth better fruits of health, righteousness, and Life, than _a belief in their reality has ever done_. A demonstration of the _unreality_ of evil destroys evil.     SIN, SINNER, AND ECCLESIASTICISM   Why do Christian Scientists say God and His idea are the only realities, and then insist on the need of healing sickness and sin? Because Christian Science heals sin as it heals sickness, by establishing the recognition that God _is All_, and there is none beside Him,--that all is good, and there is in reality no evil, neither sickness nor sin. We attack the sinner's belief in the pleasure of sin, _alias_ the reality of sin, which makes him a sinner, in order to destroy this belief and save him from sin; and we attack the belief of the sick in the reality of sickness, in order to heal them. When we deny the authority of sin, we begin to sap it; for this denunciation must precede its destruction.  God is good, hence goodness is something, for it represents God, the Life of man. Its opposite, nothing, named _evil_, is nothing but a conspiracy against man's Life and goodness. Do you not feel bound to expose this conspiracy, and so to save man from it? Whosoever covers iniquity becomes accessory to it. Sin, as a claim, is more dangerous than sickness, more subtle, more difficult to heal.  St. Augustine once said, \"The devil is but the ape of God.\" Sin is worse than sickness; but recollect that it encourages sin to say, \"There is no sin,\" and leave the subject there.  Sin ultimates in sinner, and in this sense they are one. You cannot separate sin from the sinner, nor the sinner from his sin. The sin is the sinner, and _vice versa_, for such is the unity of evil; and together both sinner and sin will be destroyed by the supremacy of good. This, however, does not annihilate man, for to efface sin, _alias_ the sinner, brings to light, makes apparent, the real man, even God's \"image and likeness.\" Need it be said that any opposite theory is heterodox to divine Science, which teaches that good is equally _one_ and _all_, even as the opposite claim of evil is one.  In Christian Science the fact is made obvious that the sinner and the sin are alike simply nothingness; and this view is supported by the Scripture, where the Psalmist saith: \"He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light. Man that is in honor, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.\" God's ways and works and thoughts have never changed, either in Principle or practice.  Since there is in belief an illusion termed sin, which must be met and mastered, we classify sin, sickness, and death as illusions. They are supposititious claims of error; and error being a false claim, they are no claims at all. It is scientific to abide in conscious harmony, in health-giving, deathless Truth and Love. To do this, mortals must first open their eyes to all the illusive forms, methods, and subtlety of error, in order that the illusion, error, may be destroyed; if this is not done, mortals will become the victims of error.  If evangelical churches refuse fellowship with the Church of Christ, Scientist, or with Christian Science, they must rest their opinions of Truth and Love on the evidences of the physical senses, rather than on the teaching and practice of Jesus, or the works of the Spirit.  Ritualism and dogma lead to self-righteousness and bigotry, which freeze out the spiritual element. Pharisaism killeth; Spirit giveth Life. The odors of persecution, tobacco, and alcohol are not the sweet-smelling savor of Truth and Love. Feasting the senses, gratification of appetite and passion, have no warrant in the gospel or the Decalogue. Mortals must take up the cross if they would follow Christ, and worship the Father \"in spirit and in truth.\"  The Jewish religion was not spiritual; hence Jesus denounced it. If the religion of to-day is constituted of such elements as of old ruled Christ out of the synagogues, it will continue to avoid whatever follows the example of our Lord and prefers Christ to creed. Christian Science is the pure evangelic truth. It accords with the trend and tenor of Christ's teaching and example, while it demonstrates the power of Christ as taught in the four Gospels. Truth, casting out evils and healing the sick; Love, fulfilling the law and keeping man unspotted from the world,--these practical manifestations of Christianity constitute the only evangelism, and they need no creed.  As well expect to determine, without a telescope, the magnitude and distance of the stars, as to expect to obtain health, harmony, and holiness through an unspiritual and unhealing religion. Christianity reveals God as ever-present Truth and Love, to be utilized in healing the sick, in casting out error, in raising the dead.  Christian Science gives vitality to religion, which is no longer buried in materiality. It raises men from a material sense into the spiritual understanding and scientific demonstration of God.     THE HUMAN CONCEPT   Sin existed as a false claim before the human concept of sin was formed; hence one's concept of error is not the whole of error. The human thought does not constitute sin, but _vice versa_, sin constitutes the human or physical concept.  Sin is both concrete and abstract. Sin was, and _is_, the lying supposition that life, substance, and intelligence are both material and spiritual, and yet are separate from God. The first iniquitous manifestation of sin was a finity. The finite was self-arrayed against the infinite, the mortal against immortality, and a sinner was the antipode of God.  Silencing self, _alias_ rising above corporeal personality, is what reforms the sinner and destroys sin. In the ratio that the testimony of material personal sense ceases, sin diminishes, until the false claim called sin is finally lost for lack of witness.  The sinner created neither himself nor sin, but sin created the sinner; that is, error made its man mortal, and this mortal was the image and likeness of evil, not of good. Therefore the lie was, and _is_, collective as well as individual. It was in no way contingent on Adam's thought, but supposititiously self-created. In the words of our Master, it, the \"devil\" (_alias_ evil), \"was a liar, and the father of it.\"  This mortal material concept was never a creator, although as a serpent it claimed to originate in the name of \"the Lord,\" or good,--original evil; second, in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16734"],["title","Retrospection and Introspection (#8)"],["body"," of human concept, it claimed to beget the offspring of evil, _alias_ an evil offspring. However, the human concept never was, neither indeed can be, the father of man. Even the spiritual idea, or ideal man, is not a parent, though he reflects the infinity of good. The great difference between these opposites is, that the human material concept is _unreal_, and the divine concept or idea is spiritually real. One is false, while the other is true. One is temporal, but the other is eternal.  Our Master instructed his students to \"call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.\" (Matt. xxiii. 9.)  Science and Health, the textbook of Christian Science, treats of the human concept, and the transference of thought, as follows:--      \"How can matter originate or transmit mind? We answer that it     cannot. Darkness and doubt encompass thought, so long as it bases     creation on materiality\" (p. 551).      \"In reality there is no _mortal_ mind, and consequently no     transference of mortal thought and will-power. Life and being are     of God. In Christian Science, man can do no harm, for scientific     thoughts are true thoughts, passing from God to man\" (pp. 103,     104).      \"Man is the offspring of Spirit. The beautiful, good, and pure     constitute his ancestry. His origin is not, like that of mortals,     in brute instinct, nor does he pass through material conditions     prior to reaching intelligence. Spirit is his primitive and     ultimate source of being; God is his Father, and Life is the law     of his being\" (p. 63).      \"The parent of all human discord was the Adam-dream, the deep     sleep, in which originated the delusion that life and intelligence     proceeded from and passed into matter. This pantheistic error, or     so-called _serpent_, insists still upon the opposite of Truth,     saying, 'Ye shall be as gods;' that is, I will make error as real     and eternal as Truth.... 'I will put spirit into what I call     matter, and matter shall seem to have life as much as God, Spirit,     who _is_ the only Life.' This error has proved itself to be error.     Its life is found to be not Life, but only a transient, false     sense of an existence which ends in death\" (pp. 306, 307).      \"When will the error of believing that there is life in matter,     and that sin, sickness, and death are creations of God, be     unmasked? When will it be understood that matter has no     intelligence, life, nor sensation, and that the opposite belief is     the prolific source of all suffering? God created all through     Mind, and made all perfect and eternal. Where then is the     necessity for recreation or procreation?\" (p. 205).      \"Above error's awful din, blackness, and chaos, the voice of Truth     still calls: 'Adam, where art thou? Consciousness, where art thou?     Art thou dwelling in the belief that mind is in matter, and that     evil is mind, or art thou in the living faith that there is and     can be but one God, and keeping His commandment?'\" (pp. 307,     308). \"Mortal mind inverts the true likeness, and confers animal     names and natures upon its own misconceptions. Ignorant of the     origin and operations of mortal mind,--that is, ignorant of     itself,--this so-called mind puts forth its own qualities, and     claims God as their author;... usurps the deific prerogatives and     is an attempted infringement on infinity\" (pp. 512, 513).  We do not question the authenticity of the Scriptural narrative of the Virgin-mother and Bethlehem babe, and the Messianic mission of Christ Jesus; but in our time no Christian Scientist will give chimerical wings to his imagination, or advance speculative theories as to the recurrence of such events.  No person can take the individual place of the Virgin Mary. No person can compass or fulfil the individual mission of Jesus of Nazareth. No person can take the place of the author of Science and Health, the Discoverer and Founder of Christian Science. Each individual must fill his own niche in time and eternity.  The second appearing of Jesus is, unquestionably, the spiritual advent of the advancing idea of God, as in Christian Science.  And the scientific ultimate of this God-idea must be, will be, forever individual, incorporeal, and infinite, even the reflection, \"image and likeness,\" of the infinite God.  The right teacher of Christian Science lives the truth he teaches. Preeminent among men, he virtually stands at the head of all sanitary, civil, moral, and religious reform. Such a post of duty, unpierced by vanity, exalts a mortal beyond human praise, or monuments which weigh dust, and humbles him with the tax it raises on calamity to open the gates of heaven. It is not the forager on others' wisdom that God thus crowns, but he who is obedient to the divine command, \"Render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and to God the things that are God's.\"  Great temptations beset an ignorant or an unprincipled mind-practice in opposition to the straight and narrow path of Christian Science. Promiscuous mental treatment, without the consent or knowledge of the individual treated, is an error of much magnitude. People unaware of the indications of mental treatment, know not what is affecting them, and thus may be robbed of their individual rights,--freedom of choice and self-government. Who is willing to be subjected to such an influence? Ask the unbridled mind-manipulator if he would consent to this; and if not, then he is knowingly transgressing Christ's command. He who secretly manipulates mind without the permission of man or God, is not dealing justly and loving mercy, according to pure and undefiled religion.  Sinister and selfish motives entering into mental practice are dangerous incentives; they proceed from false convictions and a fatal ignorance. These are the tares growing side by side with the wheat, that must be recognized, and uprooted, before the wheat can be garnered and Christian Science demonstrated.  Secret mental efforts to obtain help from one who is unaware of this attempt, demoralizes the person who does this, the same as other forms of stealing, and will end in destroying health and morals.  In the practice of Christian Science one cannot impart a mental influence that hazards another's happiness, nor interfere with the rights of the individual. To disregard the welfare of others is contrary to the law of God; therefore it deteriorates one's ability to do good, to benefit himself and mankind.  The Psalmist vividly portrays the result of secret faults, presumptuous sins, and self-deception, in these words: \"How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors.\"     PERSONALITY   The immortal man being spiritual, individual, and eternal, his mortal opposite must be material, corporeal, and temporal. Physical personality is finite; but God is infinite. He is without materiality, without finiteness of form or Mind.  Limitations are put off in proportion as the fleshly nature disappears and man is found in the reflection of Spirit.  This great fact leads into profound depths. The material human concept grew beautifully less as I floated into more spiritual latitudes and purer realms of thought.  From that hour personal corporeality became less to me than it is to people who fail to appreciate individual character. I endeavored to lift thought above physical personality, or selfhood in matter, to man's spiritual individuality in God,--in the true Mind, where sensible evil is lost in supersensible good. This is the only way whereby the false personality is laid off.  He who clings to personality, or perpetually warns you of \"personality,\" wrongs it, or terrifies people over it, and is the sure victim of his own corporeality. Constantly to scrutinize physical personality, or accuse people of being unduly personal, is like the sick talking sickness. Such errancy betrays a violent and egotistical personality, increases one's sense of corporeality, and begets a fear of the senses and a perpetually egotistical sensibility.  He who does this is ignorant of the meaning of the word _personality_, and defines it by his own _corpus sine pectore_ (soulless body), and fails to distinguish the individual, or real man from the false sense of corporeality, or egotistic self.  My own corporeal personality afflicteth me not wittingly; for I desire never to think of it, and it cannot think of me.     PLAGIARISM   The various forms of book-borrowing without credit spring from this ill-concealed question in mortal mind, Who shall be greatest? This error violates the law given by Moses, it tramples upon Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, it does violence to the ethics of Christian Science.  Why withhold my name, while appropriating my language and ideas, but give credit when citing from the works of other authors?  Life and its ideals are inseparable, and one's writings on ethics, and demonstration of Truth, are not, cannot be, understood or taught by those who persistently misunderstand or misrepresent the author. Jesus said, \"For there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.\"  If one's spiritual ideal is comprehended and loved, the borrower from it is embraced in the author's own mental mood, and is therefore _honest_. The Science of Mind excludes opposites, and rests on unity.  It is proverbial that dishonesty retards spiritual growth and strikes at the heart of Truth. If a student at Harvard College has studied a textbook written by his teacher, is he entitled, when he leaves the University, to write out as his own the substance of this textbook? There is no warrant in common law and no permission in the gospel for plagiarizing an author's ideas and their words. Christian Science is not copyrighted; nor would protection by copyright be requisite, if mortals obeyed God's law of _manright_. A student can write voluminous works on Science"]]]
