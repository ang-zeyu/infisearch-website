All great civilizations have evolved from the habits and experiences of settled communities. Law and religion were closely associated, and the evidence afforded by the remains of stone circles and temples suggests that in the organization and division of labour the influence of religious teachers was pre-eminent. Early rulers, indeed, were priest-kings--incarnations of the deity who owned the land and measured out the span of human life.  We need not assume that Neolithic man led an idyllic existence; his triumphs were achieved by slow and gradual steps; his legal codes were, no doubt, written in blood and his institutions welded in the fires of adversity. But, disciplined by laws, which fostered humanitarian ideals, Neolithic man, especially of the Mediterranean race, had reached a comparatively high state of civilization long ages before the earliest traces of his activities can be obtained. When this type of mankind is portrayed in Ancient Sumeria, Ancient Egypt, and Ancient Crete we find that the faces are refined and intellectual and often quite modern in aspect. The skulls show that in the Late Stone Age the human brain was fully developed and that the racial types were fixed. In every country in Europe we still find the direct descendants of the ancient Mediterranean race, as well as the descendants of the less highly cultured conquerors who swept westward out of Asia at the dawn of the Bronze Age; and everywhere there are evidences of crossment of types in varying degrees. Even the influence of Neolithic intellectual life still remains. The comparative study of mythology and folk beliefs reveals that we have inherited certain modes of thought from our remote ancestors, who were the congeners of the Ancient Sumerians and the Ancient Egyptians. In this connection it is of interest, therefore, to refer to the social ideals of the early peoples who met and mingled on the southern plains of the Tigris and Euphrates, and especially the position occupied by women, which is engaging so much attention at the present day.  It would appear that among the Semites and other nomadic peoples woman was regarded as the helpmate rather than the companion and equal of man. The birth of a son was hailed with joy; it was \"miserable to have a daughter\", as a Hindu sage reflected; in various countries it was the custom to expose female children after birth and leave them to die. A wife had no rights other than those accorded to her by her husband, who exercised over her the power of life and death. Sons inherited family possessions; the daughters had no share allotted to them, and could be sold by fathers and brothers. Among the peoples who observed \"male right\", social life was reflected in the conception of controlling male deities, accompanied by shadowy goddesses who were often little else than figures of speech.  The Ancient Sumerians, on the other hand, like the Mediterranean peoples of Egypt and Crete, reverenced and exalted motherhood in social and religious life. Women were accorded a legal status and marriage laws were promulgated by the State. Wives could possess private property in their own right, as did the Babylonian Sarah, wife of Abraham, who owned the Egyptian slave Hagar.[26] A woman received from her parents a marriage dowry, and in the event of separation from her husband she could claim its full value. Some spinsters, or wives, were accustomed to enter into business partnerships with men or members of their own sex, and could sue and be sued in courts of law. Brothers and sisters were joint heirs of the family estate. Daughters might possess property over which their fathers exercised no control: they could also enter into legal agreements with their parents in business matters, when they had attained to years of discretion. Young women who took vows of celibacy and lived in religious institutions could yet make business investments, as surviving records show. There is only one instance of a Sumerian woman ascending the throne, like Queen Hatshepsut of Egypt. Women, therefore, were not rigidly excluded from official life. Dungi II, an early Sumerian king, appointed two of his daughters as rulers of conquered cities in Syria and Elam. Similarly Shishak, the Egyptian Pharaoh, handed over the city of Gezer, which he had subdued, to his daughter, Solomon's wife.[27] In the religious life of ancient Sumeria the female population exercised an undoubted influence, and in certain temples there were priestesses. The oldest hymns give indication of the respect shown to women by making reference to mixed assemblies as \"females and males\", just as present-day orators address themselves to \"ladies and gentlemen\". In the later Semitic adaptations of these productions, it is significant to note, this conventional reference was altered to \"male and female\". If influences, however, were at work to restrict the position of women they did not meet with much success, because when Hammurabi codified existing laws, the ancient rights of women received marked recognition.  There were two dialects in ancient Sumeria, and the invocatory hymns were composed in what was known as \"the women's language\". It must not be inferred, however, that the ladies of Sumeria had established a speech which differed from that used by men. The reference would appear to be to a softer and homelier dialect, perhaps the oldest of the two, in which poetic emotion found fullest and most beautiful expression. In these ancient days, as in our own, the ideal of womanhood was the poet's chief source of inspiration, and among the hymns the highest reach of poetic art was attained in the invocation of Ishtar, the Babylonian Venus. The following hymn is addressed to that deity in her Valkyrie-like character as a goddess of war, but her more feminine traits are not obscured:--      HYMN TO ISHTAR      To thee I cry, O lady of the gods,     Lady of ladies, goddess without peer,     Ishtar who shapes the lives of all mankind,     Thou stately world queen, sovran of the sky,     And lady ruler of the host of heaven--     Illustrious is thy name... O light divine,     Gleaming in lofty splendour o'er the earth--     Heroic daughter of the moon, oh! hear;     Thou dost control our weapons and award     In battles fierce the victory at will--     crown'd majestic Fate. Ishtar most high,     Who art exalted over all the gods,     Thou bringest lamentation; thou dost urge     With hostile hearts our brethren to the fray;     The gift of strength is thine for thou art strong;     Thy will is urgent, brooking no delay;     Thy hand is violent, thou queen of war     Girded with battle and enrobed with fear...     Thou sovran wielder of the wand of Doom,     The heavens and earth are under thy control.      Adored art thou in every sacred place,     In temples, holy dwellings, and in shrines,     Where is thy name not lauded? where thy will     Unheeded, and thine images not made?     Where are thy temples not upreared? O, where     Art thou not mighty, peerless, and supreme?      Anu and Bel and Ea have thee raised     To rank supreme, in majesty and pow'r,     They have established thee above the gods     And all the host of heaven... O stately queen,     At thought of thee the world is filled with fear,     The gods in heaven quake, and on the earth     All spirits pause, and all mankind bow down     With reverence for thy name... O Lady Judge,      Thy ways are just and holy; thou dost gaze     On sinners with compassion, and each morn     Leadest the wayward to the rightful path.      Now linger not, but come! O goddess fair,     O shepherdess of all, thou drawest nigh     With feet unwearied... Thou dost break the bonds     Of these thy handmaids... When thou stoopest o'er     The dying with compassion, lo! they live;     And when the sick behold thee they are healed.      Hear me, thy servant! hearken to my pray'r,     For I am full of sorrow and I sigh     In sore distress; weeping, on thee I wait.     Be merciful, my lady, pity take     And answer, \"'Tis enough and be appeased \".      How long must my heart sorrow and make moan     And restless be? How long must my dark home     Be filled with mourning and my soul with grief?     O lioness of heaven, bring me peace     And rest and comfort. Hearken to my pray'r!     Is anger pity? May thine eyes look down     With tenderness and blessings, and behold     Thy servant. Oh! have mercy; hear my cry     And unbewitch me from the evil spells,     That I may see thy glory... Oh! how long     Shall these my foes pursue me, working ill,     And robbing me of joy?... Oh! how long     Shall demons compass me about and cause     Affliction without end?... I thee adore--     The gift of strength is thine and thou art strong--     The weakly are made strong, yet I am weak...     O hear me! I am glutted with my grief--     This flood of grief by evil winds distressed;     My heart hath fled me like a bird on wings,     And like the dove I moan. Tears from mine eyes     Are falling as the rain from heaven falls,     And I am destitute and full of woe.             *       *       *       *       *      What have I done that thou hast turned from me?     Have I neglected homage to my god     And thee my goddess? O deliver me     And all my sins forgive, that I may share     Thy love and be watched over in thy fold;     And may thy fold be wide, thy pen secure.             *       *       *       *       *      How long wilt thou be angry? Hear my cry,     And turn again to prosper all my ways--     O may thy wrath be crumbled and withdrawn     As by a crumbling stream. Then smite my foes,     And take away their power to work me ill,     That I may crush them. Hearken to my pray'r!     And bless me so that all who me behold     May laud thee and may magnify thy name,     While I exalt thy power over all--     Ishtar is highest! Ishtar is the queen!     Ishtar the peerless daughter of the moon!     CHAPTER "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16653"],["title","Myths of Babylonia and Assyria (#8)"],["body","II.

Ancient Babylonia was for over four thousand years the garden of Western Asia. In the days of Hezekiah and Isaiah, when it had come under the sway of the younger civilization of Assyria on the north, it was \"a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey[28]\". Herodotus found it still flourishing and extremely fertile. \"This territory\", he wrote, \"is of all that we know the best by far for producing grain; it is so good that it returns as much as two hundredfold for the average, and, when it bears at its best, it produces three hundredfold. The blades of the wheat and barley there grow to be full four fingers broad; and from millet and sesame seed, how large a tree grows, I know myself, but shall not record, being well aware that even what has already been said relating to the crops produced has been enough to cause disbelief in those who have not visited Babylonia[29].\" To-day great tracts of undulating moorland, which aforetime yielded two and three crops a year, are in summer partly barren wastes and partly jungle and reedy swamp. Bedouins camp beside sandy heaps which were once populous and thriving cities, and here and there the shrunken remnants of a people once great and influential eke out precarious livings under the oppression of Turkish tax-gatherers who are scarcely less considerate than the plundering nomads of the desert.  This historic country is bounded on the east by Persia and on the west by the Arabian desert. In shape somewhat resembling a fish, it lies between the two great rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates, 100 miles wide at its broadest part, and narrowing to 35 miles towards the \"tail\" in the latitude of Baghdad; the \"head\" converges to a point above Basra, where the rivers meet and form the Shatt-el-Arab, which pours into the Persian Gulf after meeting the Karun and drawing away the main volume of that double-mouthed river. The distance from Baghdad to Basra is about 300 miles, and the area traversed by the Shatt-el-Arab is slowly extending at the rate of a mile every thirty years or so, as a result of the steady accumulation of silt and mud carried down by the Tigris and Euphrates. When Sumeria was beginning to flourish, these two rivers had separate outlets, and Eridu, the seat of the cult of the sea god Ea, which now lies 125 miles inland, was a seaport at the head of the Persian Gulf. A day's journey separated the river mouths when Alexander the Great broke the power of the Persian Empire.  In the days of Babylonia's prosperity the Euphrates was hailed as \"the soul of the land\" and the Tigris as \"the bestower of blessings\". Skilful engineers had solved the problem of water distribution by irrigating sun-parched areas and preventing the excessive flooding of those districts which are now rendered impassable swamps when the rivers overflow. A network of canals was constructed throughout the country, which restricted the destructive tendencies of the Tigris and Euphrates and developed to a high degree their potentialities as fertilizing agencies. The greatest of these canals appear to have been anciently river beds. One, which is called Shatt en Nil to the north, and Shatt el Kar to the south, curved eastward from Babylon, and sweeping past Nippur, flowed like the letter S towards Larsa and then rejoined the river. It is believed to mark the course followed in the early Sumerian period by the Euphrates river, which has moved steadily westward many miles beyond the sites of ancient cities that were erected on its banks. Another important canal, the Shatt el Hai, crossed the plain from the Tigris to its sister river, which lies lower at this point, and does not run so fast. Where the artificial canals were constructed on higher levels than the streams which fed them, the water was raised by contrivances known as \"shaddufs\"; the buckets or skin bags were roped to a weighted beam, with the aid of which they were swung up by workmen and emptied into the canals. It is possible that this toilsome mode of irrigation was substituted in favourable parts by the primitive water wheels which are used in our own day by the inhabitants of the country who cultivate strips of land along the river banks.  In Babylonia there are two seasons--the rainy and the dry. Rain falls from November till March, and the plain is carpeted in spring by patches of vivid green verdure and brilliant wild flowers. Then the period of drought ensues; the sun rapidly burns up all vegetation, and everywhere the eye is wearied by long stretches of brown and yellow desert. Occasional sandstorms darken the heavens, sweeping over sterile wastes and piling up the shapeless mounds which mark the sites of ancient cities. Meanwhile the rivers are increasing in volume, being fed by the melting snows at their mountain sources far to the north. The swift Tigris, which is 1146 miles long, begins to rise early in March and reaches its highest level in May; before the end of June it again subsides. More sluggish in movement, the Euphrates, which is 1780 miles long, shows signs of rising a fortnight later than the Tigris, and is in flood for a more extended period; it does not shrink to its lowest level until early in September. By controlling the flow of these mighty rivers, preventing disastrous floods, and storing and distributing surplus water, the ancient Babylonians developed to the full the natural resources of their country, and made it--what it may once again become--one of the fairest and most habitable areas in the world. Nature conferred upon them bountiful rewards for their labour; trade and industries flourished, and the cities increased in splendour and strength. Then as now the heat was great during the long summer, but remarkably dry and unvarying, while the air was ever wonderfully transparent under cloudless skies of vivid blue. The nights were cool and of great beauty, whether in brilliant moonlight or when ponds and canals were jewelled by the lustrous displays of clear and numerous stars which glorified that homeland of the earliest astronomers.  Babylonia is a treeless country, and timber had to be imported from the earliest times. The date palm was probably introduced by man, as were certainly the vine and the fig tree, which were widely cultivated, especially in the north. Stone, suitable for building, was very scarce, and limestone, alabaster, marble, and basalt had to be taken from northern Mesopotamia, where the mountains also yield copper and lead and iron. Except Eridu, where ancient workers quarried sandstone from its sea-shaped ridge, all the cities were built of brick, an excellent clay being found in abundance. When brick walls were cemented with bitumen they were given great stability. This resinous substance is found in the north and south. It bubbles up through crevices of rocks on river banks and forms small ponds. Two famous springs at modern Hit, on the Euphrates, have been drawn upon from time immemorial. \"From one\", writes a traveller, \"flows hot water black with bitumen, while the other discharges intermittently bitumen, or, after a rainstorm, bitumen and cold water.... Where rocks crop out in the plain above Hit, they are full of seams of bitumen.\"[30] Present-day Arabs call it \"kiyara\", and export it for coating boats and roofs; they also use it as an antiseptic, and apply it to cure the skin diseases from which camels suffer.  Sumeria had many surplus products, including corn and figs, pottery, fine wool and woven garments, to offer in exchange for what it most required from other countries. It must, therefore, have had a brisk and flourishing foreign trade at an exceedingly remote period. No doubt numerous alien merchants were attracted to its cities, and it may be that they induced or encouraged Semitic and other raiders to overthrow governments and form military aristocracies, so that they themselves might obtain necessary concessions and achieve a degree of political ascendancy. It does not follow, however, that the peasant class was greatly affected by periodic revolutions of this kind, which brought little more to them than a change of rulers. The needs of the country necessitated the continuance of agricultural methods and the rigid observance of existing land laws; indeed, these constituted the basis of Sumerian prosperity. Conquerors have ever sought reward not merely in spoil, but also the services of the conquered. In northern Babylonia the invaders apparently found it necessary to conciliate and secure the continued allegiance of the tillers of the soil. Law and religion being closely associated, they had to adapt their gods to suit the requirements of existing social and political organizations. A deity of pastoral nomads had to receive attributes which would give him an agricultural significance; one of rural character had to be changed to respond to the various calls of city life. Besides, local gods could not be ignored on account of their popularity. As a result, imported beliefs and religious customs must"]]]
