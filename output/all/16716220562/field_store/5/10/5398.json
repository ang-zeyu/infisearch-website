Remembering the javelin which had whizzed so near his crown, he cast about for a moment and picked it up from the earth where it lay but a few feet distant.  As he balanced it in his hand, he observed that it was about six feet in length, was made entirely of wood, which was heavy and as hard and smooth as polished ebony.  The light of the moon was like that of the day itself.  It would have been easy to read ordinary print by it.  He had no trouble, therefore, in closely examining the novel implement of war.  As he suspected, the point was made of stone or flint, ground almost to needle-like sharpness and securely fastened in place by a fine tendon wound around the portion of the stick that held the harder part.  This was covered with a gummy substance extending to the end.  This he was satisfied was among the most virulent of substances known to toxicology.  A puncture of the skin was sure to be fatal unless some remedy, of whose existence he held no suspicion, was instantly obtainable.  He had set down his rifle white examining the weapon, but quickly caught it up again, still retaining the javelin in his right band.  He had been startled by the sound of the terrific threshing among the trees on his right.  He supposed that his friend was coming back, but, glancing toward the point where he expected him to appear, he was amazed to see the third native, who whisked off before Long could draw a bead on him, step from the wood not twenty paces away.  His back was toward the Professor, and, strangely enough, he did not observe the white man--an oversight that never could have occurred, but for the tumult in the undergrowth which held his attention.  Grimcke had hardly caught sight of him, when the other native came flying to view, so astonishing his waiting comrade that he stood a moment irresolute after the white pursuer burst into sight.  Brief as was this pause, it gave the Professor time for some exceedingly fine work.  He uttered a shout which caused the native to turn his affrighted gaze behind him, just in time to observe the white man with javelin raised and apparently in the very act of launching it at him.  The savage knew what a prick from that frightful thing meant, and with a howling shriek he ducked his head as though he had caught its whizz through the air, and shot among the trees with as much celerity as his companion had shown in coming from them.  Neither of the explorers wished to slay the natives, no matter how savage, unless compelled to do so in actual self-defence.  Long had recovered from his first burst of fury, and, though the Professor could have sunk the javelin in the naked body, he withheld it, not unwilling that his assailant, now that he had started to flee, should escape.  The one who had so foolishly come back to the river side was left in the worst possible situation, for both his enemies stood between him and the sheltering forest and he was defenceless.  He was at their mercy, and such people as those natives neither gave nor expected quarter, when engaged in their savage warfare.  The fellow acted like a bewildered animal.  The white strangers were standing a few paces apart, so as to form the two angles of a triangle, while he made the third.  The nearest point to the forest way midway between Grimcke and Long, as was apparent to the savage, who was fairly cornered.  Had the Xingu behind him been as placid as farther above or below the rapids, he would not have hesitated to plunge into its waters, trusting to his skill in swimming; but, to dive into the raging current would have been as certain destruction as for a man to undertake to swim unaided through the whirlpool below Niagara.  Grimcke and Long were not unwilling to torment the fellow, because of his cowardly attempt a few minutes before, though, as has been stated, neither intended to do him any special harm.  The affrighted native crouched down, as though seeking to draw himself into such a narrow compass that the terrible javelin could not reach him.  Despite the proof he had seen of the power of the civilized weapons, he held his own in greater dread.  Grimcke raised the spear, as if poising it aloft to hurl at the savage. The latter uttered a howl of terror, and, with his head still low, attempted to dart between the strangers.  Naturally he shied as far away as possible from the Professor, and thereby brought himself almost close enough to touch Jared.  \"That's what I want,\" muttered the latter, hurriedly concentrating his strength in his good right leg, and delivering the most powerful kick at his command.  It was well aimed and most effectively landed.  The Professor was sure he heard the \"dull thud,\" and always insisted that the recipient was lifted clear of the ground and propelled among the trees with an impetus sufficient to break his neck.  \"There!\" exclaimed the New Englander, looking around, \"I guess I'm through!\"  \"I am sure that last fellow hopes so,\" said the Professor with a laugh, \"for it's safe to conclude he was never handled with such vigor before.\"  The levity which both felt over their triumphant routing of their assailants was checked by the sight of the stark, lifeless form on the ground, only a few paces distant.  They had the best plea in the world for shooting the fierce savage, but the consciousness that the necessity existed and that the deed had been done, rendered them serious and thoughtful.  There was reason for believing the other natives would watch them from the forest, and the one who retained his javelin was likely to seek the chance to use it again.  He certainly had strong temptation to do so, with the prospect of little risk to himself.  Besides, as the explorers followed the rapids, their uproar increased to that extent that the savages could move freely without danger of any noise being overheard.  The most prudent thing to do seemed for the friends to walk so briskly as to disconcert any plan their enemies might have formed.  This was quite easy, because of the open space, already mentioned, as lining both banks of the Xingu.  Fortunately the distance to camp was not far, and, with the hurried pace adopted by the Professor and Long, it ought not to occupy more than a few minutes, provided no interruption occurred.  Strange emotions tortured both, as they kept their eyes fixed on the dark wood at their side, from which they expected the sweep of the fearful javelin, whose touch was death.  The keenest hearing could not detect the faint whizz, while the roar of the rapids was in their ears, and they had to depend, therefore, on their eyes, which promised to be of little more service.  But the entire distance was almost passed, and the hearts of the two were beating high with increasing hope, when Long, with a gasp of terror, grasped the arm of the Professor with incredible force, and jerking him backward, pointed with his extended finger to the camp in front of them.     CHAPTER V.  THE NATIVE VILLAGE.  Meanwhile, Fred Ashman and Aaron Johnston the sailor, found themselves involved in a most stirring experience.  After studying the path or trail which led directly from the camp into the vast forest, stretching to an unknown distance from the Xingu, the young man decided to follow the route which he believed had been formed by persons instead of the wild animals of the wilderness.  Johnston was disposed to complain, but he was deeply attached to the manly partner in the exploring enterprise, and there was no reasonable peril which he would not willingly face in his defence.  The forest wore an unusually gloomy and dismal appearance, now that the sun had set and night was closing in.  The roar of the rapids, which at first sounded so loud, grew duller and fainter as they penetrated the wood until it became like the moaning of the distant ocean.  The men spoke in guarded undertones and were able to hear each other plainly, while eyes and ears were on the alert, for the first sight or sound of danger.  Being within the forest, they were favored with but little of the moonlight, which proved such a help to their friends in their ascent of the bank of the Xingu to the head of the rapids.  But here and there a few of the rays penetrated the vegetation overhead and illuminated the trail sufficiently to prevent their wandering from it.  Ashman was less than a rod in advance of the sailor and led until they had traversed perhaps a fifth of a mile, during which they met no living creature, though the noises from the wood left no doubt that wild animals were on every hand.  Fred began to think he had gone far enough, though his wish to obtain a glimpse of the village, which he believed was not far off, prevented his coming to a full stop.  Johnston noticing his hesitation put in another vigorous protest, but he was easily persuaded to venture further under the pledge that if they discovered nothing within the next ten minutes, they would withdraw and return to camp.  Knowing that his companion would insist on the fulfillment of this agreement, Fred pushed on faster than before; the sailor, however, easily maintaining his place almost on his heels.  It was only at intervals they spoke, for there was no call to do so, and it was not wise to allow any cause to interfere with their watchfulness for the peril which was liable to come with the suddenness of the thunderbolt.  By stepping carefully they were able to proceed without noise, and, at the same time, hoped to catch the sound of any other footsteps, since there was not supposed to be any call on the part of the natives for the caution which they might have displayed under different circumstances.  The young man's heart gave a quicker throb than usual when he caught the sound of something like a shout, and observed a faint light in the path in front.  It was apparent that the latter made an abrupt"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16855"],["title","The Land of Mystery (#4)"],["body","n, and the cause of the noise was but a brief distance beyond.  Fred reached back his hand and touched his companion, as a warning for the most extreme care on his part, but the admonition was not needed. Johnston understood the situation too well.  Sure enough, less than a couple of rods further, and the path turned almost at right angles.  Passing guardedly around this, the explorers came upon a striking scene.  There was an open space with an area of perhaps three or four acres; it was as clear of trees as a stretch of western prairie.  It was triangular in shape, the boundary being so regular that there could be no doubt it was artificially made.  Around three sides of this space were erected huts or cabins, the excellence and similarity or their structure suggesting that the natives were the superior in intelligence of any that had yet been encountered during the ascent of the Xingu.  The huts were a dozen feet square, half as high, and each had a broad open entrance in the middle of the front.  They seemed to be built of logs or heavy limbs, the roofs being flat and composed of the branches of trees, overlaid with leaves and earth.  In the middle of the open square was a tall pole, like an immense flag-staff.  The light which had been noticed sometime before by the whites was the full flood of the moon's rays, there being no other kind of illumination, so far as they could ascertain, in the native village.  The huge pole was without any limbs or appurtenances, but around the space were gathered a score of figures in rapid motion, the meaning of whose actions was a puzzle to the white spectators, until they studied them.  Then it was seen they were struggling together, and the conclusion was that they were engaged in some kind of a rough sport, for all the rest of the savages were seated in front of their huts watching the singular spectacle.  Naturally they ought to have come closer, and the fact that they did not, suggested that they kept back to give the actors plenty of room for their performances.  Not the least impressive feature of the scene was the profound silence which marked it.  The shout that first arrested the attention of Ashman and his companion, must have been some kind of a signal, probably announcing the opening of the proceedings.  It was evident that the villagers in the square were struggling hard, for their forms were interlocked and they were divided into two lines, which swayed back and forth as one gained or yielded ground.  \"It is a wrestling bout,\" whispered Ashman to his companion, and then, reflecting that their situation was dangerous, the two stopped from the path among the trees, where they would not be noticed by any passing near.  Suddenly something like a groan was heard from the body of contesting men.  Almost at the same instant, a command was shouted from the further end of the square, where part of the spectators were gathered. The two lines fell apart, and ran silently and swiftly to opposite points a hundred feet distant, where they abruptly halted as if in obedience to some signal and faced each other.  This was stirring enough, but that which riveted the eyes of the white men was the sight of three figures lying prone on the ground, at the foot of the pole.  They were as motionless as so many stones.  There could be no mistaking the significance of the sight: they were dead.  It may have been some species of sport in which the actors were engaged for the entertainment of the spectators, but, if so, there was an awful earnestness about it, for the stake for which they strove was human life.  The two lines faced each other but a moment, when another shout rang out, and they rushed together once more with the fury of two cyclones.  By this time, our friends had discovered that no member of the parties was furnished with any weapon other than those provided by nature.  Fearful then must have been the struggle, which had already terminated in the death of three of the contestants.  But they were at it again with the fierceness of so many cougars fighting in defence of their young.  The result was terrifying.  The contest had lasted but a few minutes, and already a couple were on the earth, when one of the combatants, with a cry of pain dashed in almost a direct line toward the spot where our friends were hiding.  Had he not been overtaken and dragged back, he would have been upon them before they could get out of the way, and it is not difficult to conjecture what would have followed.  The miserable wretch, however, was seized on the very edge of the wood by four others and carried writhing and resisting back to the space. There he was flung down, and, being unable to rise, the others leaped upon him and in a few minutes all was over.  He was added to the list that were already _hors du combat_.  Ashman and Johnston had received a shock which drove away all interest in the fearful spectacle.  Their escape was exceedingly narrow and they could scarcely hope for such good fortune again.  Fred touched his friend and whispered to him.  Immediately, they began stealing from the dangerous spot.     CHAPTER VI.  ALONG THE FOREST PATH.  If any further proof were needed of the delicacy and danger of the situation of the white men, it came the next minute, when, as they were in the act of stepping back into the trail, the sailor caught the arm of his friend and checked him.  No need of speaking, for Ashman had detected the peril at the same instant.  Two natives were stealing like phantoms along the path, from the direction of the river and going toward the village.  Had they been ten seconds later, the foremost would have collided with the young explorer.  The latter held his breath, and placed his hand on his revolver, believing a fight was inevitable.  So it would have been, had not the attention of the savages been absorbed by the scene in the square, of which they caught sight a pace or two before coming opposite the watchers.  They strode directly onward, and swung across the open space, swerving enough to one side to avoid the struggling lines, and moving on until they reached the fringe of spectators beyond.  There they could no longer be identified, and probably took their places among those who were enjoying the cruel spectacle.  Ashman waited a brief while beside the path, fearful that other natives might be coming; but, when the minutes passed without their appearance, he resumed picking his way back, and quickly stood erect in the narrow opening, which he felt had been followed too far from the Xingu.  There was no reason to suspect that any of the natives knew of the presence of the mysterious strangers so near them, but since they seemed to have a remarkable disposition to be on the move, our friends felt it would not be safe to relax their caution for a single instant.  While they did not apprehend a direct pursuit, there was a probability that some parties might be moving along the trail behind them, while they had seen enough to convince them of the danger from the front. Ashman, therefore, whispered to his companion to keep special guard against an approach from the rear, while he would be equally alert in guarding the front.  The two kept so near that they could have reached each other by simply extending the hand.  They had no more than fairly started on their withdrawal from the spot, when Johnston touched the arm of his friend, who instantly halted to learn the cause.  \"I believe some of 'em are following us,\" said Johnston.  Fred listened, but his straining ear could detect nothing to warrant such an alarming conclusion, and he so stated.  The sailor became convinced that possibly he was mistaken.  There is no law governing noises at night, and it might be that he had misjudged the rustling of a branch or possibly the stealthy footsteps of some wild animal.  Not entirely convinced, however, that his companion was mistaken, Fred once more resumed the advance, trying to perform the difficult task of giving as much attention to the rear as the front.  If the savages suspected the presence of others, they would be likely to tread so lightly that their footfalls could not be heard; but inasmuch as neither of the whites could believe they had even the most shadowy knowledge of them, they relied more on hearing than sight.  Suddenly Fred started and almost uttered an exclamation.  In his nervous, apprehensive state, he was sure that one of their dusky foes had leaped from the side of the path and was crouching in front.  He drew his pistol and waited for the assault, which he was confident would come the next moment; but the seconds passed and all remained profoundly still.  With his weapon ready for instant use, he advanced a pace or two, touching the sailor as a command for him to remain motionless; but the chivalrous fellow would not obey, and was close behind him, when he stooped down and placed his hand on a piece of decayed limb that had fallen into the path.  \"What a mistake,\" muttered Fred, with a sigh, as he shoved it aside with his foot, explaining its nature to the wondering Johnston.  But it was only simple prudence to maintain unceasing vigilance, and he did not permit the error to lessen his watchfulness.  It was rather the reverse.  But the explorers were threading their way through a labyrinth of peril, the like of which they had never encountered before.  Fred had not gone a hundred yards further, when his companion once more caught his arm, and he turned about as before to learn the cause.  \"What have you heard?\" he asked, with his mouth almost against the ear of the other.  \"There are some of 'em behind us, certain sure!\"  \"How do you know there are more than one?\"  \"By the sound--there!\"  The amazement of the two may be understood, when they not only detected the sound of footfalls, but discovered that instead of being at the rear as both thought, they were in front!  A party of natives were approaching from the Xingu, and the keener"]]]
