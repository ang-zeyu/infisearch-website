Briefly, this is the wisdom of referring the laws of society to     the House of Justice. In the religion of Islám, similarly, not     every ordinance was explicitly revealed; nay not a tenth part of a     tenth part was included in the Text; although all matters of major     importance were specifically referred to, there were undoubtedly     thousands of laws which were unspecified. These were devised by     the divines of a later age according to the laws of Islamic     jurisprudence, and individual divines made conflicting deductions     from the original revealed ordinances. All these were enforced.     Today this process of deduction is the right of the body of the     House of Justice, and the deductions and conclusions of individual     learned men have no authority, unless they are endorsed by the     House of Justice. The difference is precisely this, that from the     conclusions and endorsements of the body of the House of Justice     whose members are elected by and known to the worldwide Bahá’í     community, no differences will arise; whereas the conclusions of     individual divines and scholars would definitely lead to     differences, and result in schism, division, and dispersion. The     oneness of the Word would be destroyed, the unity of the Faith     would disappear, and the edifice of the Faith of God would be     shaken.   Although the Universal House of Justice is explicitly authorized to change or repeal its own legislation as conditions change, thus providing Bahá’í law with an essential element of flexibility, it cannot abrogate or change any of the laws which are explicitly laid down in the sacred Text.  The society for which certain of the laws of the Aqdas are designed will come only gradually into being, and Bahá’u’lláh has provided for the progressive application of Bahá’í law:       Indeed, the laws of God are like unto the ocean and the children     of men as fish, did they but know it. However, in observing them     one must exercise tact and wisdom... Since most people are feeble     and far-removed from the purpose of God, therefore one must     observe tact and prudence under all conditions, so that nothing     might happen that could cause disturbance and dissension or raise     clamour among the heedless. Verily, His bounty hath surpassed the     whole universe and His bestowals encompassed all that dwell on     earth. One must guide mankind to the ocean of true understanding     in a spirit of love and tolerance. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas itself     beareth eloquent testimony to the loving providence of God.   The principle governing this progressive application was enunciated in a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to a National Spiritual Assembly in 1935:       The laws revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in the Aqdas are, whenever     practicable and not in direct conflict with the Civil Law of the     land, absolutely binding on every believer or Bahá’í institution     whether in the East or in the West. Certain ... laws should be     regarded by all believers as universally and vitally applicable at     the present time. Others have been formulated in anticipation of a     state of society destined to emerge from the chaotic conditions     that prevail today... What has not been formulated in the Aqdas,     in addition to matters of detail and of secondary importance     arising out of the application of the laws already formulated by     Bahá’u’lláh, will have to be enacted by the Universal House of     Justice. This body can supplement but never invalidate or modify     in the least degree what has already been formulated by     Bahá’u’lláh. Nor has the Guardian any right whatsoever to lessen     the binding effect much less to abrogate the provisions of so     fundamental and sacred a Book.   The number of laws binding on Bahá’ís is not increased by the publication of this translation. When it is deemed timely, the Bahá’í community will be advised which additional laws are binding upon believers, and any guidance or supplementary legislation necessary for their application will be provided.  In general, the laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas are stated succinctly. An example of this conciseness can be seen in the fact that many are expressed only as they apply to a man, but it is apparent from the Guardian’s writings that, where Bahá’u’lláh has given a law as between a man and a woman, it applies mutatis mutandis between a woman and a man unless the context makes this impossible. For example, the text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas forbids a man to marry his father’s wife (i.e. his stepmother), and the Guardian has indicated that likewise a woman is forbidden to marry her stepfather. This understanding of the implications of the Law has far-reaching effects in light of the fundamental Bahá’í principle of the equality of the sexes, and should be borne in mind when the sacred Text is studied. That men and women differ from one another in certain characteristics and functions is an inescapable fact of nature and makes possible their complementary roles in certain areas of the life of society; but it is significant that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has stated that in this Dispensation \"Equality of men and women, except in some negligible instances, has been fully and categorically announced.\"  Mention has already been made of the intimate relationship between the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the Holy Books of previous Dispensations. Especially close is the relationship to the Bayán, the Book of Laws revealed by the Báb. It is elucidated in the following excerpts from letters written on behalf of the Guardian:       Shoghi Effendi feels that the unity of the Bahá’í Revelation as     one complete whole embracing the Faith of the Báb should be     emphasized... The Faith of the Báb should not be divorced from     that of Bahá’u’lláh. Though the teachings of the Bayán have been     abrogated and superseded by the laws of the Aqdas, yet due to the     fact that the Báb considered Himself as the Forerunner of     Bahá’u’lláh, we would regard His Dispensation together with that     of Bahá’u’lláh as forming one entity, the former being     introductory to the advent of the latter.      The Báb states that His laws are provisional and depend upon the     acceptance of the future Manifestation. This is why in the Book of     Aqdas Bahá’u’lláh sanctions some of the laws found in the Bayán,     modifies others and sets aside many.   Just as the Bayán had been revealed by the Báb at about the mid-point of His Ministry, Bahá’u’lláh revealed the Kitáb-i-Aqdas around 1873, some twenty years after He had received, in the Síyáh-C̱ẖál of Ṭihrán, the intimation of His Revelation. In one of His Tablets He indicates that even after its revelation the Aqdas was withheld by Him for some time before it was sent to the friends in Iran. Thereafter, as Shoghi Effendi has related:       The formulation by Bahá’u’lláh, in His Kitáb-i-Aqdas, of the     fundamental laws of His Dispensation was followed, as His Mission     drew to a close, by the enunciation of certain precepts and     principles which lie at the very core of His Faith, by the     reaffirmation of truths He had previously proclaimed, by the     elaboration and elucidation of some of the laws He had already     laid down, by the revelation of further prophecies and warnings,     and by the establishment of subsidiary ordinances designed to     supplement the provisions of His Most Holy Book. These were     recorded in unnumbered Tablets, which He continued to reveal until     the last days of His earthly life...   Among such works is the Questions and Answers, a compilation made by Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín, the most eminent of the transcribers of Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings. Consisting of answers revealed by Bahá’u’lláh to questions put to Him by various believers, it constitutes an invaluable appendix to the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. In 1978 the most noteworthy of the other Tablets of this nature were published in English as a compilation entitled Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.  Some years after the revelation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Bahá’u’lláh had manuscript copies sent to Bahá’ís in Iran, and in the year 1308 A.H. (1890-91 A.D.), towards the end of His life, He arranged for the publication of the original Arabic text of the Book in Bombay.  A word should be said about the style of language in which the Kitáb-i-Aqdas has been rendered into English. Bahá’u’lláh enjoyed a superb mastery of Arabic, and preferred to use it in those Tablets and other Writings where its precision of meaning was particularly appropriate to the exposition of basic principle. Beyond the choice of language itself, however, the style employed is of an exalted and emotive character, immensely compelling, particularly to those familiar with the great literary tradition out of which it arose. In taking up his task of translation, Shoghi Effendi faced the challenge of finding an English style which would not only faithfully convey the exactness of the text’s meaning, but would also evoke in the reader the spirit of meditative reverence which is a distinguishing feature of response to the original. The form of expression he selected, reminiscent of the style used by the seventeenth-century translators of the Bible, captures the elevated mode of Bahá’u’lláh’s Arabic, while remaining accessible to the contemporary reader. His translations, moreover, are illumined by his uniquely inspired understanding of the purport and implications of the originals.  Although both Arabic and English are languages with rich vocabularies and varied modes of expression, their forms differ widely from one another. The Arabic of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is marked by intense concentration and terseness of expression. It is a characteristic of this style that if a connotation is obvious it should not be explicitly stated. This presents a problem for a reader whose"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16523"],["title","The Kitáb-i-Aqdas (#4)"],["body","l, religious and literary background is entirely different from that of Arabic. A literal translation of a passage which is clear in the Arabic could be obscure in English. It therefore becomes necessary to include in the English translation of such passages that element of the Arabic sentence which is obviously implicit in the original. At the same time, it is vital to avoid extrapolating this process to the point where it would add unjustifiably to the original or limit its meaning. Striking the right balance between beauty and clarity of expression on the one hand, and literalness on the other, is one of the major issues with which the translators have had to grapple and which has caused repeated reconsideration of the rendering of certain passages. Another major issue is the legal implication of certain Arabic terms which have a range of meanings different from those of similar terms in English.  Sacred Scripture clearly requires especial care and faithfulness in translation. This is supremely important in the case of a Book of Laws, where it is vital that the reader not be misled or drawn into fruitless disputation. As had been foreseen, the translation of the Most Holy Book has been a work of the utmost difficulty, requiring consultation with experts in many lands. Since some one third of the text had already been translated by Shoghi Effendi, it was necessary to strive for three qualities in the translation of the remaining passages: accuracy of meaning, beauty of English, and conformity of style with that used by Shoghi Effendi.  We are now satisfied that the translation has reached a point where it represents an acceptable rendering of the original. Nevertheless, it will undoubtedly give rise to questions and suggestions which may shed further light on its content. We are profoundly grateful for the assiduous and meticulous labours of the members of the Committees whom we commissioned to prepare and review this translation of the Aqdas and to compose the annotations. We are confident that this first authorized English edition of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas will enable its readers to obtain at least an inkling of the splendour of the Mother Book of the Bahá’í Dispensation.  Our world has entered the dark heart of an age of fundamental change beyond anything in all of its tumultuous history. Its peoples, of whatever race, nation, or religion, are being challenged to subordinate all lesser loyalties and limiting identities to their oneness as citizens of a single planetary homeland. In Bahá’u’lláh’s words: \"The well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established.\" May the publication of this translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas lend a fresh impulse to the realization of this universal vision, opening vistas of a worldwide regeneration.                                              THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE      A DESCRIPTION OF THE KITÁB-I-AQDAS BY SHOGHI EFFENDI      Taken from _God Passes By_, His History of the First Bahá’í Century   Unique and stupendous as was this Proclamation, it proved to be but a prelude to a still mightier revelation of the creative power of its Author, and to what may well rank as the most signal act of His ministry—the promulgation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. Alluded to in the Kitáb-i-Iqán, the principal repository of that Law which the Prophet Isaiah had anticipated, and which the writer of the Apocalypse had described as the \"new heaven\" and the \"new earth\", as \"the Tabernacle of God\", as the \"Holy City\", as the \"Bride\", the \"New Jerusalem coming down from God\", this \"Most Holy Book\", whose provisions must remain inviolate for no less than a thousand years, and whose system will embrace the entire planet, may well be regarded as the brightest emanation of the mind of Bahá’u’lláh, as the Mother Book of His Dispensation, and the Charter of His New World Order.  Revealed soon after Bahá’u’lláh had been transferred to the house of Údí Ḵẖammár (circa 1873), at a time when He was still encompassed by the tribulations that had afflicted Him, through the acts committed by His enemies and the professed adherents of His Faith, this Book, this treasury enshrining the priceless gems of His Revelation, stands out, by virtue of the principles it inculcates, the administrative institutions it ordains and the function with which it invests the appointed Successor of its Author, unique and incomparable among the world’s sacred Scriptures. For, unlike the Old Testament and the Holy Books which preceded it, in which the actual precepts uttered by the Prophet Himself are non-existent; unlike the Gospels, in which the few sayings attributed to Jesus Christ afford no clear guidance regarding the future administration of the affairs of His Faith; unlike even the Qur’án which, though explicit in the laws and ordinances formulated by the Apostle of God, is silent on the all-important subject of the succession, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, revealed from first to last by the Author of the Dispensation Himself, not only preserves for posterity the basic laws and ordinances on which the fabric of His future World Order must rest, but ordains, in addition to the function of interpretation which it confers upon His Successor, the necessary institutions through which the integrity and unity of His Faith can alone be safeguarded.  In this Charter of the future world civilization its Author—at once the Judge, the Lawgiver, the Unifier and Redeemer of mankind—announces to the kings of the earth the promulgation of the \"Most Great Law\"; pronounces them to be His vassals; proclaims Himself the \"King of Kings\"; disclaims any intention of laying hands on their kingdoms; reserves for Himself the right to \"seize and possess the hearts of men\"; warns the world’s ecclesiastical leaders not to weigh the \"Book of God\" with such standards as are current amongst them; and affirms that the Book itself is the \"Unerring Balance\" established amongst men. In it He formally ordains the institution of the \"House of Justice\", defines its functions, fixes its revenues, and designates its members as the \"Men of Justice\", the \"Deputies of God\", the \"Trustees of the All-Merciful\"; alludes to the future Centre of His Covenant, and invests Him with the right of interpreting His holy Writ; anticipates by implication the institution of Guardianship; bears witness to the revolutionizing effect of His World Order; enunciates the doctrine of the \"Most Great Infallibility\" of the Manifestation of God; asserts this infallibility to be the inherent and exclusive right of the Prophet; and rules out the possibility of the appearance of another Manifestation ere the lapse of at least one thousand years.  In this Book He, moreover, prescribes the obligatory prayers; designates the time and period of fasting; prohibits congregational prayer except for the dead; fixes the Qiblih; institutes the Ḥuqúqu’lláh (Right of God); formulates the law of inheritance; ordains the institution of the Mas̱ẖriqu’l-Aḏẖkár; establishes the Nineteen Day Feast, the Bahá’í festivals and the Intercalary Days; abolishes the institution of priesthood; prohibits slavery, asceticism, mendicancy, monasticism, penance, the use of pulpits and the kissing of hands; prescribes monogamy; condemns cruelty to animals, idleness and sloth, backbiting and calumny; censures divorce; interdicts gambling, the use of opium, wine and other intoxicating drinks; specifies the punishments for murder, arson, adultery and theft; stresses the importance of marriage and lays down its essential conditions; imposes the obligation of engaging in some trade or profession, exalting such occupation to the rank of worship; emphasizes the necessity of providing the means for the education of children; and lays upon every person the duty of writing a testament and of strict obedience to one’s government.  Apart from these provisions Bahá’u’lláh exhorts His followers to consort, with amity and concord and without discrimination, with the adherents of all religions; warns them to guard against fanaticism, sedition, pride, dispute and contention; inculcates upon them immaculate cleanliness, strict truthfulness, spotless chastity, trustworthiness, hospitality, fidelity, courtesy, forbearance, justice and fairness; counsels them to be \"even as the fingers of one hand and the limbs of one body\"; calls upon them to arise and serve His Cause; and assures them of His undoubted aid. He, furthermore, dwells upon the instability of human affairs; declares that true liberty consists in man’s submission to His commandments; cautions them not to be indulgent in carrying out His statutes; prescribes the twin inseparable duties of recognizing the \"Dayspring of God’s Revelation\" and of observing all the ordinances revealed by Him, neither of which, He affirms, is acceptable without the other.  The significant summons issued to the Presidents of the Republics of the American continent to seize their opportunity in the Day of God and to champion the cause of justice; the injunction to the members of parliaments throughout the world, urging the adoption of a universal script and language; His warnings to William I, the conqueror of Napoleon III; the reproof He administers to Francis Joseph, the Emperor of Austria; His reference to \"the lamentations of Berlin\" in His apostrophe to \"the banks of the Rhine\"; His condemnation of \"the throne of tyranny\" established in Constantinople, and His prediction of the extinction of its \"outward splendour\" and of the tribulations destined to overtake its inhabitants; the words of cheer and comfort He addresses to His native city, assuring her that God had chosen her to be \"the source of the joy of all mankind\"; His prophecy that \"the voice of the heroes of Ḵẖurásán\" will be raised in glorification of their Lord; His assertion that men \"endued with mighty valour\" will be raised up in Kirmán who will make mention of Him; and finally, His"]]]
