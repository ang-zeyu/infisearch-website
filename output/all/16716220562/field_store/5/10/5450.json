Had it not been for you, oh! had it not been for you”—and she glanced at the blood stains on the earthen floor, put her hands before her eyes and shuddered.  “Nonsense, Marie,” I answered, taking her hand feebly enough, for I was very weak. “Anyone else would have done as much, even if they did not love you as I do. Let us thank God that it was not in vain. But what is all that noise? Have the Quabies come back?”  She shook her head.  “No; the Boers have come back from hunting them.”  “And did they catch them and recover the cattle?”  “Not so. They only found some wounded men, whom they shot, and the body of Monsieur Leblanc with his head cut off, taken away with other bits of him for medicine, they say to make the warriors brave. Quabie has burnt his kraal and fled with all his people to join the other Kaffirs in the Big Mountains. Not a cow or a sheep did they find, except a few that had fallen exhausted, and those had their throats cut. My father wanted to follow them and attack the Red Kaffirs in the mountains, but the others would not go. They said there are thousands of them, and that it would be a mad war, from which not one of them would return alive. He is wild with grief and rage, for, Allan dear, we are almost ruined, especially as the British Government are freeing the slaves and only going to give us a very small price, not a third of their value. But, hark! he is calling me, and you must not talk much or excite yourself, lest you should be ill again. Now you have to sleep and eat and get strong. Afterwards, dear, you may talk”; and, bending down once more, she blessed and kissed me, then rose and glided away.     CHAPTER IV. HERNANDO PEREIRA   Several more days passed before I was allowed out of that little war-stained room of which I grew to hate the very sight. I entreated my father to take me into the air, but he would not, saying that he feared lest any movement should cause the bleeding to begin again or even the cut artery to burst. Moreover, the wound was not healing very well, the spear that caused it having been dirty or perhaps used to skin dead animals, which caused some dread of gangrene, that in those days generally meant death. As it chanced, although I was treated only with cold water, for antiseptics were then unknown, my young and healthy blood triumphed and no gangrene appeared.  What made those days even duller was that during them I saw very little of Marie, who now only entered the place in the company of her father. Once I managed to ask her why she did not come oftener and alone. Her face grew troubled as she whispered back, “Because it is not allowed, Allan,” and then without another word left the place.  Why, I wondered to myself, was it not allowed, and an answer sprang up in my mind. Doubtless it was because of that tall young man who had argued with my father in the wagon-house. Marie had never spoken to me of him, but from the Hottentot Hans and my father I managed to collect a good deal of information concerning him and his business.  It appeared that he was the only child of Henri Marais’s sister, who married a Portuguese from Delagoa Bay of the name of Pereira, who had come to the Cape Colony to trade many years before and settled there. Both he and his wife were dead, and their son, Hernando, Marie’s cousin, had inherited all their very considerable wealth.  Indeed, now I remembered having heard this Hernando, or Hernan, as the Boers called him for short, spoken of in past years by the Heer Marais as the heir to great riches, since his father had made a large fortune by trading in wine and spirits under some Government monopoly which he held. Often he had been invited to visit Maraisfontein, but his parents, who doted on him and lived in one of the settled districts not far from Cape Town, would never allow him to travel so far from them into these wild regions.  Since their death, however, things had changed. It appeared that on the decease of old Pereira the Governor of the Colony had withdrawn the wine and spirit monopoly, which he said was a job and a scandal, an act that made Hernando Pereira very angry, although he needed no more money, and had caused him to throw himself heart and soul into the schemes of the disaffected Boers. Indeed, he was now engaged as one of the organisers of the Great Trek which was in contemplation. In fact, it had already begun, into the partially explored land beyond the borders of the Colony, where the Dutch farmers proposed to set up dominions of their own.  That was the story of Hernando Pereira, who was to be—nay, who had already become—my rival for the hand of the sweet and beautiful Marie Marais.  One night when my father and I were alone in the little room where he slept with me, and he had finished reading his evening portion of Scripture aloud, I plucked up my courage to tell him that I loved Marie and wished to marry her, and that we had plighted our troth during the attack of the Kaffirs on the stead.  “Love and war indeed!” he said, looking at me gravely, but showing no sign of surprise, for it appeared that he was already acquainted with our secret. This was not wonderful, for he informed me afterwards that during my delirium I had done nothing except rave of Marie in the most endearing terms. Also Marie herself, when I was at my worst, had burst into tears before him and told him straight out that she loved me.  “Love and war indeed!” he repeated, adding kindly, “My poor boy, I fear that you have fallen into great trouble.”  “Why, father?” I asked. “Is it wrong that we should love each other?”  “Not wrong, but, in the circumstances, quite natural—I should have foreseen that it was sure to happen. No, not wrong, but most unfortunate. To begin with, I do not wish to see you marry a foreigner and become mixed up with these disloyal Boers. I hoped that one day, a good many years hence, for you are only a boy, Allan, you would find an English wife, and I still hope it.”  “Never!” I ejaculated.  “Never is a long word, Allan, and I dare say that what you are so sure is impossible will happen after all,” words that made me angry enough at the time, though in after years I often thought of them.  “But,” he went on, “putting my own wishes, perhaps prejudices, aside, I think your suit hopeless. Although Henri Marais likes you well enough and is grateful to you just now because you have saved the daughter whom he loves, you must remember that he hates us English bitterly. I believe that he would almost as soon see his girl marry a half-caste as an Englishman, and especially a poor Englishman, as you are, and unless you can make money, must remain. I have little to leave you, Allan.”  “I might make money, father, out of ivory, for instance. You know I am a good shot.”  “Allan, I do not think you will ever make much money, it is not in your blood; or, if you do, you will not keep it. We are an old race, and I know our record, up to the time of Henry VIII. at any rate. Not one of us was ever commercially successful. Let us suppose, however, that you should prove yourself the exception to the rule, it can’t be done at once, can it? Fortunes don’t grow in a night, like mushrooms.”  “No, I suppose not, father. Still, one might have some luck.”  “Possibly. But meanwhile you have to fight against a man who has the luck, or rather the money in his pocket.”  “What do you mean?” I asked, sitting up.  “I mean Hernando Pereira, Allan, Marais’s nephew, who they say is one of the richest men in the Colony. I know that he wishes to marry Marie.”  “How do you know it, father?”  “Because Marais told me so this afternoon, probably with a purpose. He was struck with her beauty when he first saw her after your escape, which he had not done since she was a child, and as he stopped to guard the house while the rest went after the Quabies—well, you can guess. Such things go quickly with these Southern men.”  I hid my face in the pillow, biting my lips to keep back the groan that was ready to burst from them, for I felt the hopelessness of the situation. How could I compete with this rich and fortunate man, who naturally would be favoured of my betrothed’s father? Then on the blackness of my despair rose a star of hope. I could not, but perchance Marie might. She was very strong-natured and very faithful. She was not to be bought, and I doubted whether she could be frightened.  “Father,” I said, “I may never marry Marie, but I don’t think that Hernando Pereira ever will either.”  “Why not, my boy?”  “Because she loves me, father, and she is not one to change. I believe that she would rather die.”  “Then she must be a very unusual sort of woman. Still, it may be so; the future will tell to those who live to see it. I can only pray and trust that whatever happens will be for the best for both of you. She is a sweet girl and I like her well, although she may be Boer—or French. And now, Allan, we have talked enough, and you had better go to sleep. You must not excite yourself, you know, or it may set up new inflammation in the wound.”  “Go to sleep. Must not excite yourself.” I kept muttering those words for hours, serving them up in my mind with a spice of bitter thought. At last torpor, or weakness, overcame me, and I fell into a kind of net of bad dreams which, thank Heaven! I have now forgotten. Yet when certain events happened subsequently I always thought, and indeed still think, that these or something like them, had been a part of those evil dreams.  On the morning following this conversation I was at length allowed to be carried to the stoep, where they laid me down, wrapped in a very dirty blanket, upon a rimpi-strung bench or primitive sofa. When I had satisfied my first delight at seeing the sun and breathing the fresh air, I began to study my surroundings.

At length you need no sort of crutch, You stand alone, you're voted \"much\"-- Get busy  and behave as such.

Now have you strength to stand and shine In your own light and say, \"Divine The thing is that I do.

What is calling, Billy Khaki, that you're foot-    ing it so free?  Though his lines are none too level,    And he lacks a bit of style. And he's swanking like the devil    Where the women wave and smile, He will answer with a rifle    Trim and true from stock to bore, Where the comrades crouch and stifle    In the reeking pit of war.  What is calling, Billy Khaki? There is    thunder down the sky, And the merry magpie bugle splits the morn-    ing with its cry, While your feet are beating rhythms up the    dusty hills and down, And the drums are all a-talking in the hollow    of the town.  Billy Khaki, is't the splendor of the song the    kiddies sing, Or the whipping of the flags aloft that sets    your heart a-swing?

'Tis the rattle     far away Of the cavalry at gallop and artillery in play; 'Tis the great gun's fierce concussion, and the    smell of seven hells When the long ranks go to pieces in the    sneezing of the shells.  But your eyes are laughing, Billy, and a    ribald song you sing, While the old men sit and tell us war it is a    ghastly thing, When the swift machines are busy and the    grim, squat fortress nocks At your bolts as vain as eggs of gulls that spatter on the rocks.  When the horses sweep upon you to complete    a sudden rout, Or in fire and smoke and fury some brave    regiment goes out, War is cruel, Bill, and ugly. But full well    you know the rest, Yet your heart is for the battle, and your face    is to the west.  For if war is beastly, Billy, you can picture    something worse-- There's the wrecking of an empire, and its    broken people's curse; There are nations reft of freedom, and of hope    and kindly mirth, And the shadow of an evil black upon the    bitter earth.  So we know what's calling, Billy. 'Tis the    spirit of our race, And its stir is in your pulses, and its light is    on your face As you march with clipping boot-heels    through the piping, howling town To uphold the land we live in, and to pull a    tyrant down.  Thou his lines are none too level,    And he's not a whale for style, And he's swanking like the devil    When the women wave and smile He will answer with a rifle,    Trim and true from stuck to bore, When the comrades sit and stifle    In the smoking pit of war.    AS THE TROOP WENT THROUGH  I HEARD this day, as I may no more, The world's heart throb at my workshop door. The sun was keen, and the day was still;    The township drowsed in, a haze of heat. A stir far off on the sleepy hill,    The measured beat of their buoyant feet,       And the lilt and thrum       Of a little drum, The song they sang in a cadence low, The piping note of a piccolo.  The township woke, and the doors flew wide; The women trotted their boys beside. Across the bridge on a single heel    The soldiers came in a golden glow, With throb of song and the chink of steel,    The gallant crow of the piccolo.       Good and brown they were,       And their arms swung bare. Their fine young faces revived in me A boyhood's vision of chivalry.  The lean, hard regiment tramping down, Bushies, miners and boys from town. From 'mid the watchers the road along    One fell in line with the khaki men. He took the stride, and he caught their song,    And Steve went then, and Meneer, and Ben,       Long Dave McCree,       And the Weavers three, All whisked away by the \"Come! Come! Come!\" The lusty surge of the vaunting drum.  I swore a prayer for each soldier lad. He was the son that might have had; The tall, bold boy who was never mine,    All brave with dust that the eyes laughed through, His shoulders square, and his chin in line,    Was marching too with the gallant few.       Passed the muffled beat       Of their swanking feet, The swell of drum, the exulting crow, The wild-bird note of the piccolo.  They dipped away in the listless trees; A mother wept on her beaded knees For sons gone out to the long war's end;    But more than mother or man wept I Who had no son in the world to send.    The hour lagged by, and drifting high      Came the fitful hum       Of the little drum, And faint, but still with an ardent flow, The pibroch, call of the piccolo.    MARSHAL NEIGH, V.C.  HE came from tumbled country past the    humps of Buffalo Where the snow sits on the mountain 'n' the    Summer aches below. He'd a silly name like Archie. Squattin'    sullen on the ship, He knew nex' to holy nothin' through the gor-    forsaken trip.  No thoughts he had of women, no refreshin'    talk of beer; If he'd battled, loved, or suffered vital facts    did not appear; But the parsons and the poets couldn't teach    him to discourse When it come to pokin' guyver at a pore,    deluded horse.  If nags got sour 'n' kicked agin the rules of    things at sea, Artie argued matters with 'em, 'n' he'd kid    'em up a tree. \"Here's a pony got hystericks. Pipe the word    for Privit Rowe,\" The Sargint yapped, 'n' all the ship came    cluckin' to the show.  He'd chat him confidential, 'n' he'd pet 'n'    paw the moke; He'd tickle him, 'n' flatter him, 'n' try him    with a joke; 'N' presently that neddy sobers up, 'n' sez    \"Ive course, Since you puts it that way, cobber, I will be    a better horse.\"  There was one pertickler whaler, known    aboard ez Marshal Neigh, Whose monkey tricks with Privit Rowe was    better than a play. He'd done stunts in someone's circus, 'n' he    loved a merry bout, Whirlin' in to bust his boiler, or to kick    the bottom out.  Rowe he sez: \"Well, there's an idjit! Oh,    yes, let her whiz, you beauty! Where's yer 'orse sense, little feller? Where's    yer bloomin' sense iv duty?
