She had a blue dress that he always liked, and she'd sit here and sing, and the sun coming in on her through her own window there, as she always called it: like a pretty picture she was, our Faith.\"  \"Oh!\" cried Hilda, taking the brown, motherly hand in both of hers, \"I am so very, very sorry, dear Nurse Lucy! I did not know! I will never sit here again. I thought--\"  But she was ashamed to say what she had thought,--that this chair and table had been set for her to tempt her to sit down \"in a kitchen!\" She could hear herself say it as she had said it last night, with a world of scornful emphasis. How long it seemed since last night; how much older she had grown! And yet--and yet somehow she felt a great deal younger.  All this passed through her mind in a moment; but Nurse Lucy was petting her, and saying: \"Nay, dearie; nay, child! This is just where I want you to sit. 'Twill be a real help to Farmer, once he is used to it. Hark! I hear him coming now. Sit still! To please me, my dear, sit still where ye are.\"  [Illustration: \"SHE BENT IN REAL DISTRESS OVER THE CURRANTS.\"]  Hilda obeyed, though her heart beat painfully; and she bent in real distress over the currants as Farmer Hartley once more entered the room. She hardly knew what she feared or expected; but her relief was great when he bade her a quiet but cheerful \"Good-day!\" and crossing the room, sat down in his great leather arm-chair.  \"Dinner'll be ready in five minutes, Jacob!\" said the good dame, cheerily; \"I've only to lay the table and dish the mutton.\"  \"Oh! let me help,\" cried Hilda, springing up and setting her bowl of currants on the window-sill.  So between the two the snowy cloth was laid, and the blue plates and the shining knives and forks laid out. Then they all sat down, and the little maid-servant came too, and took her place at the end of the table; and presently in came a great loutish-looking fellow, about one or two and twenty, with a great shock of sandy hair and little ferret-eyes set too near together, whom Dame Hartley introduced as her nephew. He sat down too, and ate more than all the rest of them put together. At sight of this man, who gobbled his food noisily, and uttered loud snorts between the mouthfuls, the old Hilda awoke in full force. She could _not_ endure this; mamma never could have intended it! The Hartleys were different, of course. She was willing to acknowledge that she had been in the wrong about them; but this lout, this oaf, this villainous-looking churl,--to expect a lady to sit at the same table with him: it was too much! She would ask if she might not dine in her own room after this, as apparently it was only at dinner that this \"creature\" made his appearance.  Farmer Hartley had been very silent since he came in, but now he seemed to feel that he must make an effort to be sociable, so he said kindly, though gravely,--  \"I see ye're lookin' at that old dish, Huldy. 'Tis a curus old piece, 'n' that's a fact. Kin ye read the motter on it?\"  Hilda had not been _looking_ at the dish, though her eyes had been unconsciously fixed upon it, and she now bent forward to examine it. It was an oblong platter, of old blue and white crockery. In the middle (which was now visible, as the \"creature\" had just transferred the last potato to his own plate, stabbing it with his knife for that purpose) was a quaint representation of a mournful-looking couple, clad in singularly ill-fitting aprons of fig-leaves. The man was digging with a spade, while the woman sat at a spinning-wheel placed dangerously near the edge of the deep ditch which her husband had already dug. Round the edge ran an inscription, which, after some study, Hilda made out to be the old distich:       \"When Adam delved, and Eve span,       Where was then the gentleman?\"  Hilda burst out laughing in spite of her self.  \"Oh, it is wonderful!\" she cried. \"Who ever heard of Eve with a spinning-wheel? Where did this come from, Farmer Hartley? I am sure it must have a history.\"  \"Wa-al,\" said the farmer, smiling, \"I d'no ez 't' hes so to speak a hist'ry, an' yit there's allays somethin' amoosin' to me about that platter. My father was a sea-farin' man most o' his life, an' only came to the farm late in life, 'count of his older brother dyin', as owned it. Well, he'd picked up a sight o' queer things in his voyages, father had; he kep' some of 'em stowed away in boxes, and brought 'em out from time to time, ez he happened to think of 'em. Wa-al, we young uns growed up (four of us there was, all boys, and likely boys too, if I do say it), and my brother Simon, who was nex' to me, he went to college. He was a clever chap, Simon was, an' nothin' would do for _him_ but he must be a gentleman.  \"'Jacob kin stick to the farm an' the mill; if he likes,' says he, 'an' Tom kin go to sea, an' William kin be a minister,--'t's all he's good fer, I reckon; but _I'm_ goin' ter be a _gentleman_!' says Simon. He said it in father's hearin' one day, an' father lay back in his cheer an' laughed; he was allays laughin', father was. An' then he went off upstairs, an' we heard him rummagin' about among his boxes up in the loft-chamber. We dassn't none of us tech them boxes, we boys, though we warn't afeard of nothin' else in the world, only father. Presently he comes down again, still a-laughin', an' kerryin' that platter in his hand. He sets it down afore Simon, an' says he, 'Wealthy,' says he (that was my mother), 'Wealthy,' says he, 'let Simon have his victuals off o' this platter every day, d'ye hear? The' ain't none other that's good enough for him!' an' then he laughed again, till he fairly shook, an' Simon looked black as thunder, an' took his hat an' went out. An' so after Simon went to college, every time he come home for vacation and set down to table with his nose kind o' turned up, like he was too good to set with his own kith and kin, father 'ud go an git the old blue platter and set it afore him, an' say, 'Here's _your_ dish, Simon; been diggin' any lately, my son?' and then lay back in his cheer and laugh.\"  \"And did Simon become--a--a gentleman?\" asked Hilda, taking her own little lesson very meekly, in her desire to know more.  Farmer Hartley's brow clouded instantly, and the smile vanished from his lips. \"Poor Simon!\" he said, sadly. \"He might ha' been anythin' he liked, if he'd lived and--been fortunate.\"  \"Simon Hartley is dead, Hilda dear,\" interposed Dame Hartley, gently; \"he died some years ago. Will you have some of your own currants, my dear?--Hilda has been helping me a great deal, Father,\" she added, addressing her husband. \"I don't know how I should have got all my currants picked without her help.\"  \"Has she so?\" exclaimed the farmer, fixing his keen gray eyes on the girl. \"Waal! waal! to think o' that! Why, we sh'll hev her milkin' that cow soon, after all; hey, Huldy?\"  Hildegarde looked up bravely, with a little smile. \"I will try,\" she said, cheerfully, \"if you will risk the milk, Farmer Hartley.\"  The old farmer returned her smile with one so bright and kind and genial that somehow the ice bent, then cracked, and then broke. The old Hilda shrank into so small a space that there was really very little left of her, and the new Hilda rose from table feeling that she had gained a new friend.  So it came to pass that about an hour later our heroine was walking beside the farmer on the way to the barnyard, talking merrily, and swinging the basket which she was going to fill with eggs. \"But how shall I find them,\" she asked, \"if the hens hide them away so carefully?\"  \"Oh, you'll hear 'em scrattlin' round!\" replied the farmer. \"They're gret fools, hens are,--greter than folks, as a rule; an' that is sayin' a good deal.\"  They crossed the great sunny barn-yard, and paused at the barn-door, while Hilda looked in with delight. A broad floor, big enough for a ballroom, with towering walls of fragrant hay on either side reaching up to the rafters; great doors open at the farther end, showing a snatch of blue, radiant sky, and a lovely wood-road winding away into deep thickets of birch and linden; dusty, golden, cobwebby sunbeams slanting down through the little windows, and touching the tossed hay-piles into gold; and in the middle, hanging by iron chains from the great central beam, a swing, almost big enough for a giant,--such was the barn at Hartley Farm; as pleasant a place, Hilda thought, as she had ever seen.  \"Waal, Huldy, I'll leave ye heer,\" said the farmer; \"ye kin find yer way home, I reckon.\"  \"Oh, yes, indeed!\" said Hilda. \"But stop one moment, please, Farmer Hartley. I want to know--will you please--may I teach Bubble Chirk a little?\" The farmer gave a low whistle of surprise; but Hilda went on eagerly: \"I found him studying, this morning, while he was weeding the garden,--oh! studying so hard, and yet not neglecting his work for a minute. He seems a very bright boy, and it is a pity he should not have a good education. Could you spare him, do you think, for an hour every day?\" She stopped, while the farmer looked at her with a merry twinkle in his eye.  \"You teach Bubble Chirk!\" he said. \"Why, what would your fine friends say to that, Miss Huldy? Bubble ain't nothin' but a common farm-boy, if he _is_ bright; an' I ain't denyin' that he is.\"  \"I don't know what they would say,\" said Hildegarde, blushing hotly, \"and I don't care, either! I know what mamma would do in my place; and so do you, Farmer Hartley!\" she added, with a little touch of indignation.  \"Waal, I reckon I do!\" said Farmer Hartley. \"And I know who looks like her mother, this minute, though I never thought she would. Yes!\" he said, more seriously, \"you shall teach Bubble Chirk, my gal; and it's my belief 'twill bring you a blessin' as well as him. Ye are yer mother's darter, after all. Shall I give ye a swing now, before I go; or are ye too big to swing!\"  \"I--don't--know!\" said Hildegarde, eying the swing wistfully. \"Am I "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16476"],["title","The Rover Boys on Land and Sea: The Crusoes of Seven Islands (#0)"],["body","ROVER BOYS ONLAND AND SEA    or The Crusoes of the Seven Islands     by Arthur M Winfield     CONTENTS       I.

MY DEAR BOYS: \"The Rover Boys on Land and Sea,\" is a complete story in itself, but forms the seventh volume of the \"Rover Boys Series for Young Americans.\"  As I mentioned in a previous volume of this series, when I began this set of books I had in mind to write no more than three volumes, relating the adventures of Dick, Tom, and Sam Rover, at home, at school, and elsewhere. But the publication of \"The Rover Boys at School,\" \"The Rover Boys on the Ocean,\" and \"The Rover Boys in the Jungle,\" immediately called for more stories of the same sort, so year after year I have followed with \"The Rover Boys out West,\" \"The Rover Boys on the Great Lakes,\" \"The Rover Boys in the Mountains,\" and now the volume before you, which relates the adventures of the three brothers, and some of their friends and enemies, on the sea and on a number of far away islands, where, for a time, all lead a sort of Robinson Crusoe life.  In writing this tale I had in mind not alone to please my young readers, but also to give them a fair picture of life on the ocean as it is to-day, in distinction to what it was years ago, and also to acquaint the boys and girls with some of the beauties of those mid-ocean lands which are generally, so strange to all of us. The boys see much that is new, novel, and pleasing--new fruits, new flowers, new animals--and have often to use their wits to the utmost, to get themselves out of serious difficulty and also to make themselves, and those under their protection, comfortable.  Once again I thank my young friends for the interest they have shown in my previous stories. I trust that all who peruse this volume will find it equally to their liking.  Affectionately and sincerely yours, ARTHUR M. WINFIELD.      THE ROVER BOYS ON LAND AND SEA     CHAPTER I  THE ROVER BOYS IN SAN FRANCISCO   \"Well, Dick, here we are in San Francisco at last.\"  \"Yes, Tom, and what a fine large city it is.\"  \"We'll have to take care, or we'll get lost,\" came from a third boy, the youngest of the party.  \"Just listen to Sam!\" cried Tom Rover. \"Get lost! As if we weren't in the habit of taking care of ourselves.\"  \"Sam is joking,\" came from Dick Rover. \"Still we might get lost here as well as in New York or any other large city.\"  \"Boston is the place to get lost in,\" said Tom Rover. \"Got streets that curve in all directions. But let us go on. Where is the hotel?\"  \"I'm sure I don't know,\" came from Sam Rover.  \"Cab! carriage! coupe!\" bawled a cabman standing near. \"Take you anywhere you want to go, gents.\"  \"How much to take the three of us to the Oakland House?\"  \"Take you there for a dollar, trunks and all.\"  \"I'll go you,\" answered Dick Rover. \"Come on, I'll see that you get the right trunks.\"  \"I think we are going to have some good times while we are on the Pacific coast,\" observed Tom Rover, while he and Sam were waiting for Dick and the cabman to return.  \"I shan't object to a good time,\" replied Sam. \"That is what we came for.\"  \"Before we go back I am going to have a sail up and down the coast.\"  \"To be sure, Tom. Perhaps we can sail down to Santa Barbara. That is a sort of Asbury Park and Coney Island combined, so I have been told.\"  Dick Rover and the cabman soon returned. The trunks were piled on the carriage and the boys got in, and away they bowled from the station in the direction of the Oakland House.  It was about ten o'clock of a clear day in early spring. The boys had reached San Francisco a few minutes before, taking in the sights on the way. Now they sat up in the carriage taking in more sights, as the turnout moved along first one street and then another.  As old readers of this series know, the Rover boys were three in number, Dick being the oldest, fun-loving Tom next, and sturdy-hearted Sam the youngest. They were the only offspring of Anderson Rover, a former traveler and mine-owner, who, at present, was living with his brother Randolph and his sister-in-law Martha, on their beautiful farm at Valley Brook, in the heart of New York State.  During the past few years the Rover boys had had numerous adventures, so many, in fact, that they can scarcely be hinted at here. While their father was in the heart of Africa, their Uncle Randolph had sent them off to Putnam Hall Academy. Here they had made many friends among the boys and also among some folks living in the vicinity, including Mrs. Stanhope and her daughter Dora, a girl who, according to Dick Rover's idea, was the sweetest creature in the whole world. They had also made some enemies, the worst of the number being Dan Baxter, a fellow who had been the bully of the school, but who was now a homeless wanderer on the face of the earth. Baxter came from a disreputable family, his father having at one time tried to swindle Mr. Rover out of a rich gold mine in the West. The elder Baxter was now in prison suffering the penalty for various crimes.  A term at school had been followed by an exciting chase on the ocean, and then by a trip through the jungle of Africa, whence the Rover boys had gone to find their long-lost father. After this the boys made a trip West to establish their parent's claim to the gold mine just mentioned, and this was followed by a grand trip on the Great Lakes in which the boys suffered not a little at the hands of the Baxters. On an island on one of the lakes the Rover boys found a curious casket and this, on being opened, proved to contain some directions for locating a treasure secreted in the heart of the Adirondack Mountains.  \"We must locate that treasure,\" said Tom Rover, and off they started for the mountains, and did locate it at last, but not before Dan Baxter had done everything in his power to locate it ahead of them. When they finally outwitted their enemy, Dan Baxter had disappeared, and that was the last they had seen of him for some time.  The Rover boys had expected to return to Putnam Hall and their studies immediately after the winter outing in the Adirondacks, but an unexpected happening at the institution of learning made them change their plans. Three pupils were taken down with scarlet fever, and rather than run the risk of having more taken sick, Captain Victor Putnam had closed up the Academy for the time being, and sent the pupils to their homes.  \"The boys will have to go to some other school,\" their Aunt Martha had said, but one and another had murmured at this, for they loved Captain Putnam too well to desert him so quickly.  \"Let us wait a few months,\" had been Dick's suggestion.  \"Let us study at home,\" had come from Sam.  \"Let us travel,\" Tom had put in. \"Travel broadens the mind.\" He loved to be \"on the go\" all the time.  The matter was talked over for several days, and Tom begged that they might take a trip across the continent and back, using some of the money derived from the old treasure. At last Anderson Rover consented; and two days later the three boys were off, going by way of New York City, on the Chicago Limited. They had spent two days in the great city by the lakes, and then come direct to the Golden Gate city.  \"I wonder if we will meet anybody we know while we are out here,\" said Tom, as the carriage continued on its way.  \"If we get down to Santa Barbara I think we'll meet somebody,\" answered Dick, and he blushed just a trifle. \"I got a letter in Chicago, as you know. It was from Dora Stanhope, and she said that she and her mother were traveling again and expected to go either to Santa Barbara or Los Angeles. Her mother is not well again, and the doctor thought the air on the Pacific coast might benefit her.\"  \"Oh, my, but won't Dick have an elegant time, if he falls in with Dora!\" cried Sam. \"Tom, we won't be in it.\"  \"Now don't you start to tease me,\" returned Dick, his face redder than ever. \"I guess Dora always gave you a good time, too.\"  \"That's right, she did,\" said Tom. And then he added: \"Did she say anything about the Lanings?\" For the Laning girls, Nellie and Grace, were cousins to Dora Stanhope, and Tom and Sam thought almost as much of them as Dick did of Dora.  \"To be sure she did,\" replied Dick. \"But I guess it's--well, it's a secret.\"  \"A secret!\" shouted Sam. \"Not much, Dick! Let us in on it at once!\"  \"Yes, do!\" put in Tom.  \"But it may prove a disappointment.\"  \"We'll chance it,\" returned Tom.  \"Well then, Dora wrote that if she and her mother could find a nice cottage at Los Angeles or Santa Barbara they were going to invite Nellie and Grace to come out and keep house with them for six months or so.\"  \"Hurrah!\" cried Sam enthusiastically. \"I hope they come. If they do, won't the six of us just have boss times!\" And his face glowed with anticipation.  \"We can certainly have good times if Mrs. Stanhope's health will permit,\" said Dick. \"Here we are at the hotel.\"  He uttered the last words as the carriage came to a stop at the curb. He leaped out and so did the others; and a few minutes later found them "]]]
