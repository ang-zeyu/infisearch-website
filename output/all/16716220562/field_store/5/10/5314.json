And this time, as the last syllable dropped from his lips, the whole face of the man flamed with a sudden and terrible anger. His skin became deep, deep red, and he clenched his teeth. With all the strength of his vigorous soul he was struggling to keep control of himself.  For perhaps five minutes he stood there beside the table without stirring a muscle. He might have been carved out of stone. His eyes were shut, and only the heaving of the chest betrayed the fact that he was a living being. Then, with a strange quietness, he lit a match and applied it to the sheet of paper he held in his hand. The ashes fell slowly about him, piece by piece, and he blew them from the window-sill into the air, his eyes following them as they floated away on the summer wind that breathed so warmly over the world.  He turned back slowly into the room. Although his actions and movements were absolutely steady and controlled, it was clear that he was on the edge of violent action. A hurricane might burst upon the still room any moment. His muscles were tense and rigid. Then, suddenly, he whitened, collapsed, and sank backwards into a chair, like a tumbled bundle of inert matter. He had fainted.  In less than half an hour he recovered consciousness and sat up. As before, he made no sound. Not a syllable passed his lips. He rose quietly and looked about the room.  Then he did a curious thing.  Taking a heavy stick from the rack in the corner he approached the mantlepiece, and with a heavy shattering blow he smashed the clock to pieces. The glass fell in shivering atoms.  \"Cease your lying voice for ever,\" he said, in a curiously still, even tone. \"There is no such thing as _time_!\"  He took the watch from his pocket, swung it round several times by the long gold chain, smashed it into smithereens against the wall with a single blow, and then walked into his laboratory next door, and hung its broken body on the bones of the skeleton in the corner of the room.  \"Let one damned mockery hang upon another,\" he said smiling oddly. \"Delusions, both of you, and cruel as false!\"  He slowly moved back to the front room. He stopped opposite the bookcase where stood in a row the \"Scriptures of the World,\" choicely bound and exquisitely printed, the late professor's most treasured possession, and next to them several books signed \"Pilgrim.\"  One by one he took them from the shelf and hurled them through the open window.  \"A devil's dreams! A devil's foolish dreams!\" he cried, with a vicious laugh.  Presently he stopped from sheer exhaustion. He turned his eyes slowly to the wall opposite, where hung a weird array of Eastern swords and daggers, scimitars and spears, the collections of many journeys. He crossed the room and ran his finger along the edge. His mind seemed to waver.  \"No,\" he muttered presently; \"not that way. There are easier and better ways than that.\"  He took his hat and passed downstairs into the street.     5   It was five o'clock, and the June sun lay hot upon the pavement. He felt the metal door-knob burn the palm of his hand.  \"Ah, Laidlaw, this is well met,\" cried a voice at his elbow; \"I was in the act of coming to see you. I've a case that will interest you, and besides, I remembered that you flavoured your tea with orange leaves!--and I admit--\"  It was Alexis Stephen, the great hypnotic doctor.  \"I've had no tea to-day,\" Laidlaw said, in a dazed manner, after staring for a moment as though the other had struck him in the face. A new idea had entered his mind.  \"What's the matter?\" asked Dr. Stephen quickly. \"Something's wrong with you. It's this sudden heat, or overwork. Come, man, let's go inside.\"  A sudden light broke upon the face of the younger man, the light of a heaven-sent inspiration. He looked into his friend's face, and told a direct lie.  \"Odd,\" he said, \"I myself was just coming to see you. I have something of great importance to test your confidence with. But in _your_ house, please,\" as Stephen urged him towards his own door--\"in your house. It's only round the corner, and I--I cannot go back there--to my rooms--till I have told you.  \"I'm your patient--for the moment,\" he added stammeringly as soon as they were seated in the privacy of the hypnotist's sanctum, \"and I want--er--\"  \"My dear Laidlaw,\" interrupted the other, in that soothing voice of command which had suggested to many a suffering soul that the cure for its pain lay in the powers of its own reawakened will, \"I am always at your service, as you know. You have only to tell me what I can do for you, and I will do it.\" He showed every desire to help him out. His manner was indescribably tactful and direct.  Dr. Laidlaw looked up into his face.  \"I surrender my will to you,\" he said, already calmed by the other's healing presence, \"and I want you to treat me hypnotically--and at once. I want you to suggest to me\"--his voice became very tense--\"that I shall forget--forget till I die--everything that has occurred to me during the last two hours; till I die, mind,\" he added, with solemn emphasis, \"till I die.\"  He floundered and stammered like a frightened boy. Alexis Stephen looked at him fixedly without speaking.  \"And further,\" Laidlaw continued, \"I want you to ask me no questions. I wish to forget for ever something I have recently discovered--something so terrible and yet so obvious that I can hardly understand why it is not patent to every mind in the world--for I have had a moment of absolute _clear vision_--of merciless clairvoyance. But I want no one else in the whole world to know what it is--least of all, old friend, yourself.\"  He talked in utter confusion, and hardly knew what he was saying. But the pain on his face and the anguish in his voice were an instant passport to the other's heart.  \"Nothing is easier,\" replied Dr. Stephen, after a hesitation so slight that the other probably did not even notice it. \"Come into my other room where we shall not be disturbed. I can heal you. Your memory of the last two hours shall be wiped out as though it had never been. You can trust me absolutely.\"  \"I know I can,\" Laidlaw said simply, as he followed him in.     6   An hour later they passed back into the front room again. The sun was already behind the houses opposite, and the shadows began to gather.  \"I went off easily?\" Laidlaw asked.  \"You were a little obstinate at first. But though you came in like a lion, you went out like a lamb. I let you sleep a bit afterwards.\"  Dr. Stephen kept his eyes rather steadily upon his friend's face.  \"What were you doing by the fire before you came here?\" he asked, pausing, in a casual tone, as he lit a cigarette and handed the case to his patient.  \"I? Let me see. Oh, I know; I was worrying my way through poor old Ebor's papers and things. I'm his executor, you know. Then I got weary and came out for a whiff of air.\" He spoke lightly and with perfect naturalness. Obviously he was telling the truth. \"I prefer specimens to papers,\" he laughed cheerily.  \"I know, I know,\" said Dr. Stephen, holding a lighted match for the cigarette. His face wore an expression of content. The experiment had been a complete success. The memory of the last two hours was wiped out utterly. Laidlaw was already chatting gaily and easily about a dozen other things that interested him. Together they went out into the street, and at his door Dr. Stephen left him with a joke and a wry face that made his friend laugh heartily.  \"Don't dine on the professor's old papers by mistake,\" he cried, as he vanished down the street.  Dr. Laidlaw went up to his study at the top of the house. Half way down he met his housekeeper, Mrs. Fewings. She was flustered and excited, and her face was very red and perspiring.  \"There've been burglars here,\" she cried excitedly, \"or something funny! All your things is just any'ow, sir. I found everything all about everywhere!\" She was very confused. In this orderly and very precise establishment it was unusual to find a thing out of place.  \"Oh, my specimens!\" cried the doctor, dashing up the rest of the stairs at top speed. \"Have they been touched or--\"  He flew to the door of the laboratory. Mrs. Fewings panted up heavily behind him.  \"The labatry ain't been touched,\" she explained, breathlessly, \"but they smashed the libry clock and they've 'ung your gold watch, sir, on the skelinton's hands. And the books that weren't no value they flung out er the window just like so much rubbish. They must have been wild drunk, Dr. Laidlaw, sir!\"  The young scientist made a hurried examination of the rooms. Nothing of value was missing. He began to wonder what kind of burglars they were. He looked up sharply at Mrs. Fewings standing in the doorway. For a moment he seemed to cast about in his mind for something.  \"Odd,\" he said at length. \"I only left here an hour ago and everything was all right then.\"  \"Was it, sir? Yes, sir.\" She glanced sharply at him. Her room looked out upon the courtyard, and she must have seen the books come crashing down, and also have heard her master leave the house a few minutes later.  \"And what's this rubbish the brutes have left?\" he cried, taking up two slabs of worn gray stone, on the writing-table. \"Bath brick, or something, I do declare.\"  He looked very sharply again at the confused and troubled housekeeper.  \"Throw them on the dust heap, Mrs. Fewings, and--and let me know if anything is missing in the house, and I will notify the police this evening.\"  When she left the room he went into the laboratory and took his watch off the skeleton's fingers. His face wore a troubled expression, but after a moment's thought it cleared again. His memory was a complete blank.  \"I suppose I left it on the writing-table when I went out to take the air,\" he said. And there was no one present to contradict him.  He crossed to the window and blew carelessly some ashes of burned paper from the sill, and stood watching them as they floated away lazily over the tops"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16734"],["title","Retrospection and Introspection (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net           RETROSPECTION  AND  INTROSPECTION   BY  MARY BAKER EDDY  AUTHOR OF SCIENCE AND HEALTH WITH KEY TO THE SCRIPTURES      Registered     U.S. Patent Office      Published by The     Trustees under the Will of Mary Baker G.

His wife, my great-grandmother, was Marion Moor, and her family is said to have been in some way related to Hannah More, the pious and popular English authoress of a century ago.  I remember reading, in my childhood, certain manuscripts containing Scriptural sonnets, besides other verses and enigmas which my grandmother said were written by my great-grandmother. But because my great-grandmother wrote a stray sonnet and an occasional riddle, it was no sign that she inherited a spark from Hannah More, or was her relative.  John and Marion Moor McNeil had a daughter, who perpetuated her mother's name. This second Marion McNeil in due time was married to an Englishman, named Joseph Baker, and so became my paternal grandmother, the Scotch and English elements thus mingling in her children.  Mrs. Marion McNeil Baker was reared among the Scotch Covenanters, and had in her character that sturdy Calvinistic devotion to Protestant liberty which gave those religionists the poetic daring and pious picturesqueness which we find so graphically set forth in the pages of Sir Walter Scott and in John Wilson's sketches.  Joseph Baker and his wife, Marion McNeil, came to America seeking \"freedom to worship God;\" though they could hardly have crossed the Atlantic more than a score of years prior to the Revolutionary period.  With them they brought to New England a heavy sword, encased in a brass scabbard, on which was inscribed the name of a kinsman upon whom the weapon had been bestowed by Sir William Wallace, from whose patriotism and bravery comes that heart-stirring air, \"Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled.\"  My childhood was also gladdened by one of my Grandmother Baker's books, printed in olden type and replete with the phraseology current in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  Among grandmother's treasures were some newspapers, yellow with age. Some of these, however, were not very ancient, nor had they crossed the ocean; for they were American newspapers, one of which contained a full account of the death and burial of George Washington.  A relative of my Grandfather Baker was General Henry Knox of Revolutionary fame. I was fond of listening, when a child, to grandmother's stories about General Knox, for whom she cherished a high regard.  In the line of my Grandmother Baker's family was the late Sir John Macneill, a Scotch knight, who was prominent in British politics, and at one time held the position of ambassador to Persia.  My grandparents were likewise connected with Capt. John Lovewell of Dunstable, New Hampshire, whose gallant leadership and death, in the Indian troubles of 1722-1725, caused that prolonged contest to be known historically as Lovewell's War.  A cousin of my grandmother was John Macneil, the New Hampshire general who fought at Lundy's Lane, and won distinction in 1814 at the neighboring battle of Chippewa, towards the close of the War of 1812.     AUTOBIOGRAPHIC REMINISCENCES   This venerable grandmother had thirteen children, the youngest of whom was my father, Mark Baker, who inherited the homestead, and with his brother, James Baker, he inherited my grandfather's farm of about five hundred acres, lying in the adjoining towns of Concord and Bow, in the State of New Hampshire.  One hundred acres of the old farm are still cultivated and owned by Uncle James Baker's grandson, brother of the Hon. Henry Moore Baker of Washington, D.C.  The farm-house, situated on the summit of a hill, commanded a broad picturesque view of the Merrimac River and the undulating lands of three townships. But change has been busy. Where once stretched broad fields of bending grain waving gracefully in the sunlight, and orchards of apples, peaches, pears, and cherries shone richly in the mellow hues of autumn,--now the lone night-bird cries, the crow caws cautiously, and wandering winds sigh low requiems through dark pine groves. Where green pastures bright with berries, singing brooklets, beautiful wild flowers, and flecked with large flocks and herds, covered areas of rich acres,--now the scrub-oak, poplar, and fern flourish.  The wife of Mark Baker was Abigail Barnard Ambrose, daughter of Deacon Nathaniel Ambrose of Pembroke, a small town situated near Concord, just across the bridge, on the left bank of the Merrimac River.  Grandfather Ambrose was a very religious man, and gave the money for erecting the first Congregational Church in Pembroke.  In the Baker homestead at Bow I was born, the youngest of my parents' six children and the object of their tender solicitude.  During my childhood my parents removed to Tilton, eighteen miles from Concord, and there the family remained until the names of both father and mother were inscribed on the stone memorials in the Park Cemetery of that beautiful village.  My father possessed a strong intellect and an iron will. Of my mother I cannot speak as I would, for memory recalls qualities to which the pen can never do justice. The following is a brief extract from the eulogy of the Rev. Richard S. Rust, D.D., who for many years had resided in Tilton and knew my sainted mother in all the walks of life.      The character of Mrs. Abigail Ambrose Baker was distinguished for     numerous excellences. She possessed a strong intellect, a     sympathizing heart, and a placid spirit. Her presence, like the     gentle dew and cheerful light, was felt by all around her. She     gave an elevated character to the tone of conversation in the     circles in which she moved, and directed attention to themes at     once pleasing and profitable.      As a mother, she was untiring in her efforts to secure the     happiness of her family. She ever entertained a lively sense of     the parental obligation, especially in regard to the education of     her children. The oft-repeated impressions of that sainted spirit,     on the hearts of those especially entrusted to her watch-care, can     never be effaced, and can hardly fail to induce them to follow her     to the brighter world. Her life was a living illustration of     Christian faith.  My childhood's home I remember as one with the open hand. The needy were ever welcome, and to the clergy were accorded special household privileges.  Among the treasured reminiscences of my much respected parents, brothers, and sisters, is the memory of my second brother, Albert Baker, who was, next to my mother, the very dearest of my kindred. To speak of his beautiful character as I cherish it, would require more space than this little book can afford.  My brother Albert was graduated at Dartmouth College in 1834, and was reputed one of the most talented, close, and thorough scholars ever connected with that institution. For two or three years he read law at Hillsborough, in the office of Franklin Pierce, afterwards President of the United States; but later Albert spent a year in the office of the Hon. Richard Fletcher of Boston. He was consequently admitted to the bar in two States, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. In 1837 he succeeded to the law-office which Mr. Pierce had occupied, and was soon elected to the Legislature of his native State, where he served the public interests faithfully for two consecutive years. Among other important bills which were carried through the Legislature by his persistent energy was one for the abolition of imprisonment for debt.  In 1841 he received further political preferment, by nomination to Congress on a majority vote of seven thousand,--it was the largest vote of the State; but he passed away at the age of thirty-one, after a short illness, before his election. His noble political antagonist, the Hon. Isaac Hill, of Concord, wrote of my brother as follows:--      Albert Baker was a young man of uncommon promise. Gifted with the     highest order of intellectual powers, he trained and schooled them     by intense and almost incessant study throughout his short life.     He was fond of investigating abstruse and metaphysical principles,     and he never forsook them until he had explored their every nook     and corner, however hidden and remote. Had life and health been     spared to him, he would have made himself one of the most     distinguished men in the country. As a lawyer he was able and     learned, and in the successful practice of a very large business.     He was noted for his boldness and firmness, and for his powerful     advocacy of the side he deemed right. His death will be deplored,     with the most poignant grief, by a large number of friends, who     expected no more than they realized from his talents and     acquirements."]]]
