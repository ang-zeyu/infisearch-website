The action of the servant Mustad, who owed his life to the father and child, was proof of what might be expected from these miscreants when swept off their feet by the delirium that was spreading with the frightful swiftness of a prairie fire.  Accordingly no time was lost.  There was a hurried scrambling on board, the water fortunately being deep enough near shore to allow all to step upon the boat dry shod.  The faint moon revealed the smooth surface of the Ganges for nearly a hundred yards from land, but the further shore was veiled in darkness.  It was at this juncture that Miss Marlowe made an annoying discovery.  \"Oh, papa, I have forgotten my pistol!\"  \"Wait and I'll soon get it,\" she added, starting to leap the short distance from the gunwale to land, but Jack Everson caught her arm.  \"You must not think of it; tell me where you left the weapon and I'll bring it.\"  \"I laid it on the table in the dining-room and in the hurry forgot it when we left.\"  Jack turned to his friends.  \"Don't wait here,\" he said, aware of the nervousness of the whole party.  \"Push down stream, and I'll quickly overtake you.\"  Without waiting for further explanation, he leaped the slight space and started up the lawn on a loping trot.  For convenience he left his rifle behind, but made sure that his revolver was in his hip pocket. He did not apprehend that he would need the weapon in the short time he expected to be absent, but if anything went awry it would be more useful than the rifle.  In that moment of profound stillness following the disappearance of the young man among the trees grouped about the lawn, the motionless people on the boat felt a thrill of terror at the unmistakable sound of oars from some point on the river not distant.  \"Let us land and take refuge in your house,\" suggested young Wharton; \"we cannot make a decent fight in this boat.\"  \"We shall have a better chance than in the house,\" was the reply of the physician; \"the bank of the river is shaded by trees a little further down; we must lose no time in getting there, and avoid the least noise.\"  There were two long poles belonging to the boat, one of which was grasped by Wharton, while Anderson swayed the other, the remainder watching their movements, which could not have been more skillful. Pressing the end against the bank, and afterwards against the clayey bottom, the craft speedily swung several rods from shore.  While the two men were thus employed, the others peered off in the gloom and listened for a repetition of the sounds that had frightened them a few minutes before.  They were not heard again, nor could the straining vision detect anything of the dreaded object, which could not be far away.  Not a person on board doubted that a number of their enemies were near and searching for them.  Dr. Marlowe would have taken comfort from this fact had the circumstances been different; for the men who were hunting for him would go to his house, since it was there they must gain their first knowledge of his flight; but, as he viewed it, it was impossible that they should be wholly ignorant of the boat and its occupants, which must have made most of the distance before night closed in.  It followed, therefore, that if they were looking for the doctor and his family they were also looking for the boat and the fugitives it contained.  The low-lying shore, with no trees fringing the bank, was the worst place for him and his friends, and he was in a fever of eagerness to reach the protecting shadows along shore.  The nerves of all were keyed to the tensest point, when they caught the dim outlines of the overhanging growth, with the leafage as exuberant as it always is in a subtropical region at that season of the year.  The men toiled with vigor and care, while the others glanced from the gloom of the river to the deeper gloom of the bank, which seemed to recede as they labored toward it.  With a relief that cannot be imagined the bulky craft glided into the bank of deeper gloom, which so wrapped it about that it was invisible from any point more than a dozen yards distant.  It is inconceivable how a narrower escape could have come about, for the two men had hardly ceased poling, allowing the boat to move forward with the momentum already gained, when their enemies were discovered. Mary Marlowe's arm was interlocked with that of her father, when she nervously clutched it and whispered:  \"Yonder is their boat!\"  All saw the terrifying sight at the same moment.  Almost opposite, and barely fifty yards out on the river, could be traced a moving shadow, the outlines of which showed a craft similarly shaped to their own, except that it was somewhat smaller and sat lower in the water.  The men were too dimly seen for their number to be counted or their motions observed, but, as in the former instance, the sounds indicated that they were using paddles.  Since it was certain that the natives were searching for the fugitives in the boat under the shadows of the bank every one of the latter wondered that the pursuers remained out in the stream, when there was need of unimpeded vision.  They half expected their enemies to turn to the left and come directly for them.  But nothing of the kind took place.  The craft headed down the river, the sound of the paddles so slight that only the closely listening ear could hear them, until it melted in the gloom and vanished from sight.  It was a vast relief for the moment, but little comfort could our friends take from the fact.  Their enemies were not likely to go far, when they would suspect that something of the nature described had occurred, and they would return and grope along shore for their victims.  So certain was Dr. Marlowe of this turn that he believed the wisest course was for the entire party to abandon the boat, and, as may be said, \"take to the woods.\"  They had the whole night before them, and, with his intimate knowledge of the roads, paths and trails of the country and jungles, he was confident of guiding them beyond danger and to some place where, when morning dawned, there would be little to fear in the way of discovery.  This course would have been taken except for the absence of Jack Everson.  There was no way of apprising him of the change of plan, and, with his ignorance of the topography of their surroundings, he would be certain to go astray, and for any one in his situation, to go astray meant death.     CHAPTER VII.  AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.  Meanwhile, Mr. Jack Everson found matters exceedingly interesting.  When he informed his friends that he would rejoin them in the course of a few minutes the possibility of anything interfering with his promise did not occur to him.  That danger threatened every member of the little company may be set down as self-evident, but what could happen to disturb him in the brief interval spent in running up the slope, dashing into the house and back again to the river's side?  Such were his thoughts as he entered the shadows and hurriedly approached the front veranda.  Although he had reached this spot within the preceding twenty-four hours the evening meal and the preparations for flight had given him sufficient knowledge of the interior to remove all difficulty in going straight to the table in the dining-room and taking the forgotten revolver therefrom.  The first tingle of misgiving came to the young man when he was close to the porch and about to step upon it.  He remembered that it was himself who had extinguished the lamp on the table as the three were about to pass into the hall and out of doors, but lo! a light was shining from that very room.  What could it mean?  \"That's deuced queer,\" he thought, coming to an abrupt halt; \"I screwed down that lamp and blew into the chimney in the orthodox fashion, so it couldn't have been that I unconsciously left the wick burning.\"  At this juncture he made another significant discovery.  The front door which he had seen Dr. Marlowe close was partly open.  The inference was inevitable: some one was in the house.  In the brief time that had passed one or more persons had entered and were busy at that moment in the interior.  Perhaps they had been watching among the shadows on the outside for the occupants to leave the way open for them to pass within.  Prudence dictated that Jack Everson should not linger another moment. Indeed, he ought to have counted himself fortunate that he had made his discovery in time to save himself from running into a trap.  He should return to his friends with the alarming news and help them in getting away with the utmost haste possible.  But Jack did nothing of the sort.  The chief cause of his lingering was his desire to obtain the revolver belonging to Miss Marlowe.  Recalling the paucity of firearms among the people on the boat he felt that a single weapon could be ill spared. But above and beyond this cold truth was a vague, shuddering suspicion, amounting to a belief, that the young woman would soon need that very weapon; that, without it she would become another of the unspeakable victims of the fiends who made the Sepoy Mutiny one of the most hideous blots that darken the pages of history.  He compressed his lips and swore that the revolver should be recovered, if the thing were possible, failing in which he would compel her to take his own.  The first thing was to learn whether there was more than one person in the house and what business had brought them there.  His own return was not expected, so that that advantage was in his favor.  He stepped lightly upon the veranda and, like a burglar in his stocking feet, passed across the porch and pushed back the door far enough to admit him.  This required but a few inches, and the hinges gave out not the slightest creak.  The entrance to the dining-room was closed, so that all was darkness, but he plainly saw the yellow thread along the edges of the door, caused by the lamp in the room beyond.  Once within the hall he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16805"],["title","The Jungle Fugitives: A Tale of Life and Adventure in India (#4)"],["body","intently, but could not detect the slightest sound within the building.  He had already drawn his revolver, and held it ready for instant use.  Knowing the value of seconds, he began moving along the hall toward the door, which was only a few paces distant, and had passed half the space when a muttered execration escaped him, for his foot struck some object that was kicked the remaining length of the hall with a clatter that he verily believed must have been heard by his friends on the boat.  No use now for precaution.  Determined to have the other weapon, but not unmindful of the peril involved, he strode the few remaining steps and hastily shoved open the door of the dining-room.  If a foe was there with the revolver he was quite likely to hold it levelled at the intruder, because of which Jack, when he burst into the room, held his own weapon pointed, so as to prevent any enemy from \"getting the drop\" on him.  For one moment the young man believed it was all a mistake and that, despite the precaution taken upon leaving the house, he had not extinguished the lamp, whose wick had recovered its vigor, but the suspicion was hardly formed when he knew there was no foundation for it.  In the first place no lamp ever acts that way, and, the front door having been closed, could not open of itself.  More convincing than all was the fact that Mary Marlowe's revolver, which had brought him back, was missing.  Diagonally across the dining-room from where Jack Everson stood was the door leading to the rear of the house.  This was open for three or four inches, and while searching the apartment with all the keenness of his powerful vision, he distinctly saw it move.  The distance was no more than an inch, but he was not mistaken, and knew it had been drawn that much nearer shut.  Since no air was stirring the conclusion was inevitable that some one was on the other side who was aware of the entrance of the American.  The position of the lamp on the table threw the crevice caused by the slight opening of the door in shadow, and all was blank darkness beyond.  But, looking in that direction, Jack caught the gleam of a pair of eyes, peering from the gloom like the orbs of a jungle tiger gathering himself for a spring.  Nothing could be seen but the glow of the eyes, that seemed to have something of the phosphorescence of the cat species, but he could not mistake the meaning of what he saw.  Jack had partly lowered his revolver, after the first glance around the room, but it now came to a level again with the suddenness of lightning and was pointed straight at the gleaming eyes, as he spoke in a low, deadly tone:  \"Come forth or I'll send a bullet through your infernal brain!\"  Never was man more fairly caught.  In the language of the West, Jack Everson had the drop on him, and none could be more alive to the fact than the fellow who was thus taken at disadvantage.  It was merited punishment for his foolhardiness in inviting his own discomfiture.  At first the chances of the two were equal, but the white man was more alive to the situation.  The Asiatic showed his appreciation of the situation by stepping forward into the lamplight.  Incredible as it may seem, he not only held a pistol in his right hand, but it was half raised and pointed at Jack Everson.     CHAPTER VIII.  MUSTAD.  The East Indian who stood before Jack Everson, thoroughly cowed and submissive, was unusually tall, dark, and thin to emaciation.  He wore a turban, a light linen jacket which encompassed his chest to below the waist, with a sash or girdle, loose flapping trousers and sandals.  In the girdle at his waist was a long, formidable knife or yataghan, which he would have been glad to bury in the heart of the man who had thus brought him to his knees.  When Jack Everson demanded to know his identity the fellow replied in a low voice that was not lacking in a certain musical quality:  \"Mustad!\"  The young man half expected the answer.  \"What business brings you here?\"  \"He is my master; I work for him.  I have been to see my aged mother, who is very ill.  I have just returned to serve my master.\"  \"That is not true!  You went away to bring some of your people to kill the doctor and his family.\"  \"Sahib does Mustad great wrong,\" replied that individual in a grieved voice.  \"I love my master and my mistress.  I am not ungrateful.  I would give my life sooner than harm a hair of their heads.  Where have they gone?\"  It was the last question that removed all lingering doubt of the native's treachery.  He had returned to bring about their overthrow, but knew not where to look for them.  When he could ascertain whither they had fled he and his brother miscreants would be at their heels.  \"Suppose I should tell you that they had gone to Meerut or Delhi?\"  \"Allah be praised!\" exclaimed the other devoutly; \"for then they will be safe.\"  \"Is there no trouble in Meerut or Delhi?\"  \"What trouble can there be!\" asked Mustad, with well-feigned simplicity.  \"It is in those cities that the missionaries and many of the Inglese live.  They have lived there many years.  What harm could befall them?\"  By this time Jack Everson had lost all doubt of the perfidy of the man. He could not fail to know what had taken place within the preceding twenty-four hours in the cities named, and he lacked his usual cunning when he tried to deceive his questioner.  The young man saw that it was a waste of time to question Mustad.  No reliance could be placed on anything he said.  \"You will wait here, then, until Dr. Marlowe comes back?\"  Mustad vigorously nodded his head and replied:  \"I shall wait, and my eyes will be filled with tears until I see the good man and his child again.  When will they come to their home?\"  \"Well, the best thing you can do is to wait here until you see them again.\"  As Jack made this remark he took a quick step forward and picked up the revolver.  He did not pause to examine it, but was sure that none of the chambers had been discharged.  Slipping the weapon into his coat pocket, and still grasping his own, he said:  \"I think I shall go out on the veranda and await the return of the doctor.\"  As he made this remark he committed a mistake for which there was no excuse.  Instead of backing out of the room he turned about and started through the open door into the hall.  The walking cane against which he had once struck his foot still lay where he had kicked it, and he tripped over it a second time.  The mishap, slight as it was, saved his life.  As he stumbled in the gloom something whizzed like the rush of a cobra's head past his temple, nipping his hat and striking the opposite wall with force enough to kill two or three men.  It was the yataghan of Mustad, who had drawn and hurled it with inconceivable quickness and with an aim so unerring that it would have brained the unsuspecting American but for his fortunate stumble.  The furious Jack whirled around with the purpose of sending a bullet through the brain of the wretch, but something like a shadow flitted through the lamplight while Jack was in the act of turning and, before he could secure any aim, the scoundrel had vanished.  Determined not to be balked the young man let fly, and then, bounding across the room, snapped back the door, meaning to repeat the shot at the first glimpse of Mustad.  But the latter was familiar with all the turnings of the house, while Jack knew nothing of that portion of the building.  He could neither see nor hear anything, and did not deem it prudent to use the lamp to help in the search, though it was hard to retire from the field and leave the miscreant unpunished.  To do so, however, was the wiser course, and again he moved into the hall.  This time he backed thither, though, since Mustad had no weapon, it was impossible that the attempt upon the young man's life should be repeated.  The outer door was opened, and once more he stood on the veranda.  Before venturing across the lawn in the direction of the river he spent a minute or two in peering into the surrounding gloom and listening. He may have been mistaken, but he fancied he heard more than one person moving stealthily about in the house.  Once he was sure he caught the sound of whispered words, so that the astounding fact was established that during the few minutes occupied in talking with Mustad he had a friend within instant call.  \"All of which goes to prove that these people are cowards at heart,\" was the sage conclusion of Jack Everson.  \"They will throw away their lives for the sake of Islamism, and they will fight like wildcats if a man turns his back upon them; but when he stands face to face they are whipped curs.\"  Since there was no doubt that Mustad and his companions would be on the alert to note the course taken by Everson, so as to learn what had become of his friends, the young man saw the need of misleading them. He took care not to return to the river over his own trail.  Instead of doing so he moved to the right, as if on his way to the nearby town of Akwar.  When satisfied he was beyond range of the keen vision of those in the house of Dr. Marlowe he made an abrupt change, which led him toward the Ganges, forgetting, when he did so, that there might be natives in the vicinity who were not in the building at all.     CHAPTER IX.  SCOUTING.  Had Mr. Jack Everson spent a few years in Hindoostan he would not have made the blunders that we are obliged to record concerning his movements after parting from his friends on the boat.  He had acquitted himself pluckily while in the house of the physician, but his escape from death at the hands of Mustad and his companion was providential and, under similar circumstances, was not likely to be repeated once in a thousand times.  Moreover, with his knowledge, already gained, of Asiatic cunning, he ought to have reflected that if two of their dusky enemies were within the house there were likely to be others in the immediate neighborhood. It looked as"]]]
