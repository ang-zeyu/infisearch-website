Little Abdul's quite a fighter, 'n' he mixes it    with skill; But the Anzacs have him snouted,, 'n', oh,    ma, he's feelin' ill. They wake the all-fired desert, 'n' the land for    ever dead Is alive 'n' fairly creepin', and the skies are    droppin' lead.  When they've got the Ot'man goin', little    gaudy hunts begin. It fer us to chiv His Trousers. 'n' to round    the stragglers in. Cuttin' closest to the raw, 'n' swearin' lovin'    all the way, Is Artie from Molinga on his neddy, Marshal    Neigh.  We're pursuin' sundry camels turkey-trottin'    anyhow With the carriage iv an emu 'n' the action iv    a cow, When a sand dune busts, 'n' belches arf a    million iv the foe. They uncork a blanky batt'ry, 'n' it's, Allah,    let her go!  We're not stayin' dinner, thank you. Lie    along yer horse 'n' yell, While the bullets pip yer britches 'n' you    sniff the flue of Hell. Here it is that Artie takes it good 'n' solid in    the crust, He dives from out the saddle, 'n' is swallered    in the dust.  I got through 'n' saw them pointin' where the    Marshal faced the band. He was goin' where we came from, sniffin'    bodies in the sand. Till he found Rowe snugglin' under, took him    where his pants was slack, 'N' be all the Asiatic gods, he brought his    soldier back!  With a bullet in his buttock, 'n' a drill hole    in his ear, He dumped Artie down among us. Square    'n' all, how did we cheer! There's no medals struck fer neddies, but we    rule there orter be, 'N' the pride iv all the Light Horse is old    Marshal Neigh, V.C.    IN HOSPITAL.  IT is thirty moons since I slung me hook    From the job at the hay and corn, Took me solemn oath, 'n' I straight forsook All the ways of life, dinkum ways 'n' crook, 'N' the things on which it was good to look    Since the day when a bloke was born.  I was give a gun, 'n' a bay'net bright,    'N' a 'ell of a swag iv work, N' I dipped my lid to the big pub light, To the ole push cobbers I give \"Good-night!\" Slipped a kiss to 'er, 'n' I wings me flight    For a date with the demon Turk.  Ez we pricked our heel to the skitin' drum.    Square 'n' all, I was gone a mile. With a perky air, 'n' a 'eart ez glum Ez a long-dead cod, I was blind 'n' dumb, Holdin' do the tear that was bound to come    At a word or a friendly smile.  Now I've seen it all, I may come out dead,    But I 'ope never more a fool. I have scorched, 'n' thirsted, 'n' froze, 'n'       bled, 'N' bin taught the use of the human head, For when all is done 'n' when all is said,    War's a wonderful sort of school.  I've bin taught to get 'em 'n' never fret,    'N' to sleep without dreamin' when We have swarmed a slope with the red rain wet; I 'ave learned a pile, 'n' I'm learnin' yet; But the thing I've learned that I won't forget    Is a way of not judgin' men.  We was shot down there in a dirty place--    From the mansions 'n' huts we'd come-- 'N' of all the welter the 'ardest case Was a little swine with a dimpled face, Who a year ago was dispensin' lace    In a Carlton em-por-ee-um.  In the moochin' days of me giddy youth,    When I kidded meself a treat, I'd have pass him one ez a gooey. 'Strewth On the track iv Huns, he's a eight-day sleuth, 'N' at tearin' into 'em nail 'n' tooth    He's got Julius Caesar beat!  I ain't proud with him ; 'n' I'm modest, too,    When dividin' a can of swill With a Algy boy from the wilds iv Kew. Cos I do not know what the cow will do When a Fritzy offers to sock me through;    'N' it's good to be livin' still.  There you are, you see! Oh! it makes you sore,    When a bloke you despised at 'ome In them pifflin' days of the years before Takes a odds-on chance with the God of War, 'N' he tows you out with his left lung tore,    'N' a crack in his bleedin' dome!  'Twas a lad called Hugh done ez much for       me.    (He has curls 'n' he's fair 'n' slim). Well, I mind the days in the Port when we Puts it over Hugh coz we don't agree With his tone 'n' style, 'n' my foot was free    When the push made a hack of him.  Now he's paid me back. I had struck a snag,    And must creep through the battle spume All a flamin' age, with a grinnin' jag In me thigh, for water, or jest a fag. Like a crippled snake I was forced to drag    Shattered flesh till the crack of doom.  When they saw me he was the one who came.    'N' he give me a raffish grin 'N' a swig. I wasn't so bad that shame Didn't get me then, for the lad was lame. They had passed him his, but his 'art was       game.    'N' he coughed ez he brought me in.  I have tackled God on me bended knees,    So He'll save him alive 'n' whole, For the sake of one who he thinks he sees When the Nurse's hands bring a kind of ease; And I thank God, too, for the things like these    That have give me a sort of soul.  There are Percies, Algies, 'n' Claudes I've       met    Who could take it 'n' come agen, While the bullets flew in a screamin' jet. What in pain, 'n' death, and in mire 'n' sweat I 'ave learned from them that I won't forget    Is a way of not judgin' men.    SISTER ANN.  I'M lyin' in a narrow bed,    'N' starin' at a wall. Where all is white my plastered head    Is whitest of it all. My life is jist a whitewashed blank,    With flamin' spurts of pain. I dunno who I've got to thank, I've p'raps been trod on by a tank,    Or caught out in the rain    When skies were peltin' fish-plates, bricks      'n' lengths of bullock-chain.  I'm lyin' here, a sulky swine,    'N' hatin' of the bloke Who's in the doss right next to mine    With 'arf his girders broke. He never done no 'arm t me,    'N' he's pertickler ill; But I have got him snouted, see, 'N' all old earth beside but she    Come with the chemist's swill,    'N' puts a kind, soft 'and on mine, 'n' all      my nark is still.  She ain't a beaut, she's thirty two,    She scales eleven stone; But, 'struth, I didn't think it true    There was such women grown! She's nurse 'n' sister, mum 'n' dad,    'N' all that straight 'n' fine In every girl I ever had. When Gabr'el comes, 'n' all the glad    Young saints are tipped the sign,    You'll see this donah take her place, first      angel in the line!  She's sweet 'n' cool, her touch is dew--    Wet lilies on yer brow. (Jist 'ark et me what never knew    Of lilies up to now). She fits your case in 'arf a wink,    'N' knows how, why, 'n' where. If you are five days gone in drink, N' hoverin' on perdition's brink,    It is her brother there.    God how pain will take a man, and      He has spoke with her!  I dunno if she ever sleeps    Ten minutes at a stretch. A dozen times a night she creeps    To soothe a screamin' wretch Who has a tiger-headed Hun    A-gnawin' at his chest. 'N' when the long, 'ard flght is won, 'N' he is still 'n' nearly done,    She smiles down on his rest,    'N' minds me of a mother with a baby at her      breast.  The curly kid we cuddled when    There was no splendid row (It seemed a little matter then,    But feels so wondrous now). It's part of her. She's Joan iv Ark,    Flo Nightingale, all fair 'N' dinkum dames who've made their mark If she comes tip-toe in the dark,    We blighters feel her there.    The whole pack perks up like a bird, 'n'      sorter takes the air.  She chats you in a 'Ighland botch;    But if our Sis saw fit To pitch Hindoo instead of Scotch    I'd get the hang of it, Because her heart it is that talks    What now is plain to me. At war where bloody murder stalks, 'N' Nick his hottest samples hawks.    I have been given to see    What simple human kindness is, what      brotherhood may be.    BRICKS.  DEAR Ned, I now take up my pen to write      you these few lines, And hopin' how they find you fit. Gorbli',      it seems an age Since Jumbo ducked the Port, 'n' drilled 'n'      polished to the nines, He walked his pork on Collins like a hero off      the stage, Then hiked a rifle 'cross the sea this bleedin'      war to wage.  The things what's 'appened lately calls to      Jumbo's mind that day Our push took on the Peewee pack, 'n'      belted out their lard, With twenty cops to top it off. But now I'm      stowed away, A bullet in me gizzard where I took it good      and hard, A-dealin'-stoush 'n' mullock to the Prussian      flamin' Guard.  At Bullcoor mortal charnce had dumped a      mutton-truck of us From good ole Port ker-flummox where we      didn't orter be, All in a 'elpless hole-the Pug, Bill Carkeek,      Son, 'n' Gus, Don, Steve, 'n' Jack, 'n' seven more, 'n', as      it 'appens, me, With nothin' in since breakfast, 'n' a week      to go for tea.  Worked loose from Caddy's bunch, we went      it gay until we found We'd took to 'arf the ragin' German Hempire      on our own. Then down we went so 'umble, with our noses      in the ground, Takin' cover in the rubble. If a German head      was shown It was fare-the-well to Herman with a bullet      through the bone.  We slogged the cows remorseless, 'n' they      laid for us a treat. We held that stinkin' cellar, though, 'n' when      the day was done Son pussied on his bingie where a Maxie trim      'n' neat Had spit out loaded lightnin', and he slugged      a tubby Hun, Then choked a Fritzie with his dukes, 'n'      pinched the sooner's gun!  We rigged her on her knuckle-bones. Cri',      how she lapped 'em up! We hosed 'em out with livin' lead. That was      the second day. Me left eye I'd 'ave give for jest a bubble in a      cup, Three fingers I'd 'ave parted for a bone I've      flung away; But the butcher wasn't callin', 'n' the fountain      didn't play.  T'was rotten mozzle, Neddo. We had blown      out ever clip, 'N' 'blooed the hammunition for the little box      of tricks. Each took a batten in his fist. Sez Billy      \"Let 'er rip!\" But Son he claws his stubble. Sez--he:      \"Hold a brace of ticks.\" Then \"Yow!\" he pipes 'n' \"Strewth!\" he      sez, \"it's bricks, you blighters,      bricks!\"  There's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16904"],["title","'Hello, Soldier!'

Sez Sonny: \"Lay 'em open! Give 'em      blotches on the rind!\"  Then bricks was flyin' in the wind. Mine      dinted Otto's chin; Ole Nosey got his brother, which he never      more will roam. When Ulrich stopped a Port bookay he rolled      his alley in. Their fire was somethin' fierce. Poor Son      was blowin' blood 'n' foam, \"Fill up,\" he coughs, \"'n' plug 'em! S'elp      me Gord, we're goin' 'ome!\"  With bricks we drove right at 'em 'n' we      wanged 'em best we could. 'Twas either bed 'n' breakfast or a scribble      and a wreath. Haynes bust a Prussian's almond, took the      bay'net where he stood, Then heaved his last 'arf-Brunswick, split      the demon's grinnin' teeth, And Son went down in glory, with a German      underneath!  We'd started out with gibbers in our clobber      and our 'ats. They gave us floatin' lead enough to stop an      army cor. We yelled like fiends, 'n' countered with a      lovely flight of bats, Then rushed in close formation, heavin' cot-      tages, n' tore Through blinded, bleedin' Bosches, 'n' lor      love yeh, it was war!  We came peltin', headfirst, 'elpless, in a drain      among a lot Of dirty, damned old Tommies (Gord! The      best that ever blew!) Eight left of us, all punctured, each man      holdin' what he'd got. Me wild, a rat hole in me lung, but in me      mauley, too, A bull-nosed brick with whiskers where no      whiskers ever grew.  There's nothin' doin' now. I wear me blan-      kets like a toff. The way this fat nurse pets me, strewth, it's      well to be so sick, A-dreamin' of our contract 'n' the way we      pulled it off. I reckon Haig is phonin' Hughes: \"Hullo,      there, Billy. Quick-- A dozen of the pushes and a thousan' tons      of brick!\"    MUD.  THIS war's a waste of slurry, and its at-      mosphere is mud,    All is bog from here to sunset. Wadin'      through We're the victims of a thicker sort of universal      flood,    With discomforts that old Noah never knew.  We have dubbed our trench The Cecil.      There's a brass-plate and a dome,    And a quagmire where the doormat used      to be, If you're calling, second Tuesday is our reg'-      lar day at home,    So delighted if you'll toddle in to tea!  There is mud along the corridors enough to      bog a cow;    In the air there hangs a musty kind of      woof; There's a frog-pond in the parlour, and the      kitchen is a slough.    She has neither doors nor windows, nor a      roof.  When they post our bald somnambulist as      missing from his flat   We take soundings for the digger with a      prop. By the day the board is gratis, by the week      it's half of that;   For the season there's a corresponding drop.  Opening off the spacious hallway is my natty      little suite,    A commodious and accessible abode. By judicious disposition, with exclusion of      my feet,    There is sleeping room for Oliver the toad.  Though the ventilation's gusty, and in gobs      the ceiling falls--    Which with oral respiration disagrees-- Though there comes a certain quantity of      seepage from the walls,    There are some I knew in diggings worse      than these.  On my right is Cobber Carkeek. There's a      spring above his head,    And his mattress is a special kind of clay. He's a most punctilious bloke about the      fashion of his bed,    And he makes it with a shovel every day.  Man is dust. If so, the Cobber has been      puddled up a treat.    On domestic sanitation he's a toff, For he lights a fire on Sunday, bakes his sur-      face in the heat,    Then he takes a little maul, and cracks it      off.  After hanging out a winter in this Cimmerian      hole    We're forgetting sheets, and baths, and      tidy skins. In the dark and deadly calm last night they      took us on patrol.    Seven, little fellows, thinking of their sins.  It was ours like blinded snails to prowl the      soggy, slimy night,    With a feeler pricking out at every pore For the death that stalks in darkness, or the      blinking stab of light,    And the other trifling matters that are war.  That's the stuff to get your liver, that's the      acid on a man,    For it tries his hones, and seeks his marrow      throngh. You have got the thought to comfort you that      life is but a span,    If Fritz squirts his loathly limelight over      you.  We got back again at daybreak. Cobber      ducked to doss and said,    From the soft, embracing mud: \"No more      I'll roam. \"Oh, thank Heaven, blokes,\" he murmured,      \"for the comforts of a bed!    Gorstruth, but ain't it good to have a      home!\"    MICKIE MOLLYNOO.  A MILE-LONG panto dragon ploddin'      'opeless all the day, Stuffed out with kits, 'n' spiked with rifles,      steamin' in its sweat, A-heavin' down the misty road, club-footed      through the clay, By waggons bogged 'n' buckin' guns,      the wildest welter yet, Like 'arf creation's tenants shiftin' early      in the wet.  We're marchin' out, we dunno where, to meet      we dunno who; But here we lights eventual, 'n' sighs 'n'      slips the kit, 'N', 'struth, the first to take us on is Mickie      Mollynoo! A copper of the Port he was, when 'istory      was writ. Sez I : \"We're sent to face the foe, 'n', selp      me, this is It.\"  A shine John. Hop is Mollynoo. A mix-up      with the push Is all his joy. One evenin' when his      baton's flyin' free I takes a baby brick, 'n' drives it hard agin      the cush, 'N' Privit Mick is scattered out fer all the      world to see, But not afore indelible he's put his mark on      me.  I got the signs Masonic all inlaid along me      lug Where Molly, P.C., swiped me in them      'appy, careless days. He's sargin' now, a vet'ran; I'm a newchum      and a mug, 'N' when he sorter fixes me there's some-      thin' in his gaze That's pensive like. \"Move on!\" sez he.      \"Keep movin' there!\" he says.  If after this I dreams of scraps promiscuous      and crool, The mills in Butcher's Alley when the      watch is on the wine, Those nights he raided Wylie's shed to break      the two-up school, I takes a screw at Molly. With a grin that      ain't divine He's toyin' with a scar of old I reckernise      as mine.  'N' so I'm layin' for it, 'n' I'm wonderin' how      'n' what. We're signed on with the Germans, 'n' there      ain't a vacant date; But sure it's comin' to me, 'n' it's comin' 'ard      'n' 'ot. Me lurk is patient waitin', but I'm trim-      min' while I wait A brick to jab or swing with, in a willin'      tatertate.  Oh, judge me wonder! There's a scrim that      follers on a raid. I'm roughin' it all-in with Hans. He sock      me such a bat I slides on somethin' narsty, 'n' me little grave      is made; But Molly butts my Hun, 'n' leaves no face      beneath his hat, 'N', \"'Scuse me, Mister Herr,\" sez he, \"I have a lien on that!\"  He helps me under cover, 'n' he 'ands me      somethin' wet (I've got a lick or two that leaves me feelin'      pretty sick). \"Lor love yeh, ole John Hop,\" sez I, \"yiv      buried me in debt.\" \"Don't minton ut at all,\" he sez, 'n' eyes      me arf-a-tick. 'N' back there in the trench I sits, 'n' trims      another brick.  'Tis all this how a month or more; then      Mollynoo sez he: \"Come aisy, Jumm, yeh loafer, little hell 'n'      all to view. A job most illegant is on, cut out fer you 'n'      me. The damnedest, dirtiest fighter on the      Continent is you, Bar one, yeh gougin' thafe, 'n' that is      Sargin' Mollynoo!\"  I take, with knife 'n' pistol, arf a brick to line      me shirt. We creeps a thousan' yards or so to jigger      up a gun Which seven Huns is workin' on the Irish like      a squirt. We gets across them, me 'n' him. I pots      the extra one; Mick chokes his third in comfort, 'n',      be'old, the thing is done!  He stands above me, rakin' sweat from off his      gleamin' nut. \"Me dipper's leakin', Mick,\" sez I; \"me      leg is bit in two.\" Sez he: \"Bleed there in comfort, I'm for      bringin' help, ye scut.\" He's back in twenty minutes, with a dillied      German crew. \"Three'll carry in the gun,\" sez he, \"the      rest will carry you.\"  I dunno how he got 'em, but he made them      barrer me. They lugged the gun before him, 'n' he      yarded them like geese. Then Mickie s'lutes the Major. \"They're in      custody,\" sez he, \"Fer conduc' calculated to provoke a breach      iv peace, A-tearin' iv me uniform, 'n' 'saultin' the      po-lice.\"  Then down he dumped. His wounds would      make a 'arf a column list. When hack to front I chucks me bricks 'n'      smiles the best I can. He grins at me: \"Yer right,\" sez he, \"Hold      out yer bla'-guard fist, I couldn't fight yeh, blarst yeh, if yeh dinted      in me pan. This messin' round wid Germans makes a      chicken iv a man.\"    JAM. (A Hymn of Hate).       WHAT is meant by active service         'Ere where sin is leakin' loose,      'N' the oldest 'and's as nervis         As a dog-bedevilled goose,      Has bin writ be every poet         What can rhyme it worth a dam,      But the 'orror as we know it         Is jist jam, jam, JAM!
