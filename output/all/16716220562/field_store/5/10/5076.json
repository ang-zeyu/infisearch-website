The radicalism of the music was fully appreciated at the time of the first performances in Paris. To the dissenters, Debussy's musical personages were mere \"stammering phantoms,\" and he was regaled with the age-worn charge of having \"ignored melody altogether.\" Debussy has defended his methods with point and directness. \"I have been reproached,\" he says, \"because in my score the melodic phrase is always in the orchestra, never in the voice. I tried, with all my strength and all my sincerity, to identify my music with the poetical essence of the drama. Before all things, I respected the characters, the lives of my personages; I wished them to express themselves independently of me, of themselves. I let them sing in me. I tried to listen to them and to interpret them faithfully. I wished--intended, in fact--that the action should never be arrested; that it should be continuous, uninterrupted. I wished to dispense with parasitic musical phrases. When listening to a work, the spectator is wont to experience two kinds of emotions which are quite distinct: the musical emotion, on the one hand; the emotion of the character [in the drama], on the other; generally they are felt successively. I have tried to blend these two emotions, and make them simultaneous. Melody is, if I may say so, almost anti-lyric, and powerless to express the constant change of emotion or life. Melody is suitable only for the song (_chanson_), which confirms a fixed sentiment. I have never been willing that my music should hinder, through technical exigencies, the changes of sentiment and passion felt by my characters. It is effaced as soon as it is necessary that these should have perfect liberty in their gestures as in their cries, in their joy as in their sorrow.\" However much one may hesitate to subscribe to Debussy's generalities, the final justification for his procedure is in the fact that it is ideally suited to its especial purpose,--the tonal utterance of Maeterlinck's rhymeless, metreless, and broken phrases. To have set them in the sustained arioso style of _Tristan und Isolde_ would have been as impossible as it would have been inept. As it is, the writing for the voices in _Pelléas_ never, as one might reasonably suppose, becomes monotonous. The achievement--an astonishing _tour de force_, at the least--is as artistically successful as it is unprecedented in modern music.  In his treatment of the orchestra, Debussy makes a scarcely less resolute departure from tradition. There is little symphonic development in the Wagnerian sense. His orchestra reflects the emotional implications of the text and action with absolute and scrupulous fidelity, but suggestively rather than with detailed emphasis. The drama is far less heavily underscored than with Wagner; the note of passion or of conflict or of tragedy is never forced. His personages love and desire, exult and hate and die, with a surprising economy of vehemence and insistence. Yet, unrhetorical as the music is, it is never pallid; and in such truly climacteric moments as that of Golaud's agonized outbreak in the scene with Mélisande, in the fourth act, and the ecstatic culmination of the final love-scene, the music supports the dramatic and emotional crisis with superb competency and vigor.  He follows Wagner to the extent of using the inescapable device of representative themes, though he has, with his usual airy inconsistency, characterized the Wagnerian _Leitmotiv_ system as \"rather coarse.\" It is true, however, that his typical phrases are employed far more sparingly and subtly than modern precedent would have led one to expect. They are seldom set in sharp and vividly dramatic contrast, as with Wagner; nor are they polyphonically deployed. Often they are mere sound-wraiths, intended to denote moods and nuances of emotion so impalpable and evanescent, so vague and interior, that it is more than a little difficult to mark their precise significance. Often they are mere fragments of themes, mere patches of harmonic color, evasive and intangible, designed almost wholly to translate phases of that psychic penumbra in which the characters and the action of the drama are enwrapped. They have a common kinship in their dim and muted loveliness, their grave reticence, the deep and immitigable sadness with which, even at their most rapturous, they are penetrated. This is a score rich in beauty and strangeness, yet the music has often a deceptive naïveté, a naïveté that is so extreme that it reveals itself, finally, as the quintessence of subtlety and reticence--in which respect, again, we are reminded of its perfect, its well-nigh uncanny, correspondence with the quality of Maeterlinck's drama.  As it has been remarked, Debussy's orchestra is here, with few exceptions, the orchestra of Mozart's day. On page after page he writes for strings alone, or for strings with wood-wind and horns. He uses the full modern orchestra only upon the rarest occasions, and then more often for color than for volume. He has an especial affection for the strings, particularly in the lower registers; and he is exceedingly fond of subdividing and muting them. It is rare to find him using the wood-wind choir alone, or the wood and brass without the strings. His orchestra contains the usual modern equipment--3 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, an English horn, 3 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums, glockenspiel, cymbals, 2 harps, and strings; yet one may count on but little more than the fingers of both hands the pages in which this apparatus is employed in its full strength. And in spite of this curious and unpopular reticence, we listen here, as M. Bruneau has observed, to \"a magic orchestra\"--an orchestra of indescribable richness, delicacy, and suppleness--an orchestra that melts and shimmers with opalescent hues--an orchestra that has substance without density, sonority without blatancy, refinement without thinness.  The music, as a whole, is as insinuating as it is unparalleled. Many passages are of an hypnotic and abiding fascination. There is something necromantic in the art which can so swiftly and so surely cast an ineluctable spell upon the heart and the imagination: such a spell as is cast in the scene at the _Fontaine des Aveugles_, in the second act; or when, from the window in the castle tower, Mélisande's unbound hair falls and envelops Pelléas--an unforgettable page; or when the lovers meet for the last time at the Fountain of the Blind; or in the scene of Mélisande's death--one of the most pathetic and affecting pages in all music. One must wonder at the elasticity and richness of the harmonic texture--which, while it is incurably \"irregular,\" is never crude or inchoate; at the distinction of the melodic line; at the rhythmical variety; at the masterly and individual orchestration. No faculty of trained perception is required justly to value the excellences of Debussy's score. There is great beauty, great eloquence, in this music. It has sincerity, dignity, and reserve, yet it is both deeply impassioned and enamoringly tender; and it is as absolutely personal, as underived, as was _Tristan_ forty years ago.   THE THEMES AND THEIR TREATMENT  The score of _Pelléas et Mélisande_ ill brooks the short and ruthless method of the thematic annotator. As I have pointed out in the foregoing pages, its themes are often so indeterminate, so shadowy and elusive, as to rebuke the analyst who would disengage and expose them. Many of them are simply harmonic hues and half-lights, melodic shreds and fragments, whose substance is as impalpable as mist and whose outlines waver and fade almost before they are perceived. Few of them are clearly and definitely articulated; for the most part they are, as I have called them, mere \"sound-wraiths,\" intentionally suggestive rather than definitive, evocative rather than descriptive. If one ventures to exhibit and to name them, one does so rather for the purpose of drawing attention to their beauty, their singularity, and their delicate potency, than with any thought of imposing an arbitrary character upon them or of insisting upon what seems to be their essential meaning--which is often altogether too recondite for positive identification. I shall not, therefore, attempt to dissect the music measure by measure, but shall endeavor rather to survey it \"in the large,\" to offer simply a general indication of its more significant features. Nor shall I offer any further justification or apology for the titles which I have adopted for the various representative themes than to say that they have seemed to me to be sufficiently supported by their association with the moods and events of the drama. It is, of course, entirely possible that apter designations might be found for them; I offer those that I have chosen more as an invitation to the sympathetic and the inquisitive than from any"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16488"],["title","Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande (#7)"],["body","to impose my own interpretation upon unwilling, dissenting, or indifferent minds.   ACT I  A brief orchestral prelude, less than twenty measures in length, introduces the opening scene of the first act. Divided and muted 'cellos, double-basses, and bassoons intone, _pp_, a solemn and brooding theme[6] designed to evoke the thought of the forest, which, sombre, mysterious, and oppressive, forms the background against which the events of the drama are projected (page 1, measure 1):[7]  [6] Its curious progressions, based on the Dorian mode of the plain-chant (corresponding to a scale of D-minor without accidentals), I have alluded to in a previous chapter.  [7] These indications refer to the arrangement of the score for voices and piano, with French and English text, published by A. Durand & Fils of Paris in 1907. I have indicated in each case, in addition to the page, the measure in which the example begins.   I. THE FOREST [Illustration: Très modéré]  This is immediately followed by one of the most important themes in the opera, that which seems to typify the veiled and overshadowing destiny which is very close to the central thought of Maeterlinck's play. Strangely harmonized, this _Fate_ theme (it is in the second measure that its kernel is contained, and it is this portion of it that is most frequently repeated) is sounded, _pp, très modéré_, by oboes, English horn, and clarinets (page 1, measure 5):   II. FATE  [Illustration]  These two themes are repeated, with altered harmonization; then follows one of the two principal themes of the score--that of _Mélisande_, sung, _doux et expressif_, by the oboe over tremolos in the divided strings (page 1, measure 14):   III. MÉLISANDE  [Illustration: _p doux et expressif_]  It is followed by a derivative theme which, in the drama, suggests the naïveté of Mélisande's personality (page 1, measure 1):   IV. MÉLISANDE'S NAÏVETÉ [Illustration]   Flute, oboe and clarinet repeat it over a counterpoint formed by the _Fate_ theme (2 horns), and the curtain opens to the accompaniment of the _Forest_ motive. This latter theme, with the motive of _Fate_, underscores the earlier portions of the dialogue between Golaud and Mélisande. At Golaud's words: \"Oh! you are beautiful!\" we hear (page 7, measure 1) an ardent phrase in the strings expressive of his awakened passion for the distressful little princess:   V. GOLAUD'S LOVE  [Illustration: Animée]  This theme is sounded again, with peculiarly penetrating effect, in the divided strings, as Golaud entreats Mélisande not \"to weep so\" (page 9, measure 4), and, later in the scene (page 19, measure 1), when he tells her that she must not stay in the forest alone after nightfall, and urges her to go with him. As he informs her that he is \"Prince Golaud, grandson of Arkël, the aged king of Allemonde,\" we hear, on the bassoons and horns, his own motive (page 14, measure 8):   VI. GOLAUD  [Illustration: Très soutenu]  \"You look like a mere child,\" he says, and the _Mélisande_ theme is given out, _doux et calme_, by the divided strings (page 18, measure 2). As the two go out together, the motive of _Fate_ is quietly intoned by the horns (page 22, measure 3).  An interlude of some fifty measures, in which the _Forest, Fate_, and _Mélisande_ themes are exploited, introduces the second scene of the act. To an accompaniment of long-sustained chords varied by recurrences of the _Mélisande_ theme, Geneviève reads to the venerable Arkël Golaud's letter to his brother. The entrance of Pelléas is accompanied by the theme which characterizes him throughout--the second of the two motives (that of Mélisande being the other) which most conspicuously dominate the score. It is announced (page 33, measure 10) by three flutes and a clarinet, over a viola accompaniment:   VII. PELLÉAS  [Illustration: Animez un peu]  The scene closes with a variant of this, and there is an interlude in which the orchestra weaves a commentary out of the themes of _Fate_ and _Golaud's Love_.  As the third scene opens (before the castle), the _Mélisande_ theme is sung, _mélancolique et doux_, by the oboe against a murmuring accompaniment of the strings. Together with the _Pelléas_ theme, it accompanies the opening portion of the scene. A suggestive use is made of a fragment of the _Fate_ theme at Mélisande's words, after Pelléas prophesies the approach of a storm: \"And yet it is so calm now!\" (page 44, measure 5). Just before the voices of the departing sailors are heard, the curious student will note a characteristic passage in the orchestra (page 45, measure 1)--a sequence of descending \"ninth-chords\" built on a downward scale of whole tones. The _Fate_ theme, combined with that of _Mélisande_, colors the rest of the scene to the end. The conclusion of the act is striking: two flutes outline a variant of the _Mélisande_ motive; a horn sounds the first three notes of the second measure of the _Fate_ theme, and four horns and flute sustain, _pp_, an unresolved suspension--C#-F#-A#-D#-G#.   VIII  [Illustration: _presque plus rien_]     ACT II  The _Pelléas_ theme, sung by two flutes, opens the brief introduction to the second act. It is repeated, interwoven with harp arpeggios. Immediately preceding the entrance of Pelléas and Mélisande a muted horn, two flutes, two oboes, and harp sound a chord of singularly liquid quality--one of those fragmentary effects in the invention of which Debussy is so curiously happy. It is the motive of _The Fountain_.[8]  [8] I quote it in the completer and more beautiful form in which it appears on page 57, measures 1-3.   IX. THE FOUNTAIN  [Illustration: Modéré]  It is repeated, with still more magical effect (scored for divided violins and violas, two muted horns, and harp), as Mélisande remarks upon the clearness of the water, while the violins and violas weave about it a shimmering figure in sixteenth-notes with which its appearances are usually associated. As Pelléas warns Mélisande to take care, while she leans above the water along the marble edge of the basin, the clarinet, over a string accompaniment, announces an impassioned phrase (page 62, measure 3)--the theme of _Awakening Desire_:   X. AWAKENING DESIRE  [Illustration: En animant]  As Pelléas questions Mélisande about the ring with which she is playing,--her wedding-ring,--and when it falls into the water while she is tossing it in the air, we hear persistently the theme of _Fate_, which, with the _Golaud_ theme (portentously sounded, _pp_, by horns and bassoons), closes the scene. There is an interlude in which the _Golaud_, _Mélisande_, and _Fate_ themes are heard.  The rhythm of the latter theme mutters ominously in the bass as the second scene is disclosed. When _Golaud_, lying wounded on his bed, describes to Mélisande how, \"at the stroke of noon,\" his horse \"swerved suddenly, with no apparent cause,\" and threw him, as he was hunting in the forest (\"could he have seen something extraordinary?\"), the oboe recalls the theme of _Awakening Desire_, which was first heard as Mélisande and Pelléas sat together by the fountain in the forest during the heat of midday. The rhythm of the _Fate_ motive is hinted by violas, 'cellos, and horns as Golaud, in answer to Mélisande's compassionate questioning, observes that he is \"made of iron and blood.\" Mélisande weeps, and the oboe sounds a plaintive variant of her motive (page 82, measure 2); the strings repeat it as she complains that she is ill. Nothing has happened, no one has harmed her, she answers, in response to Golaud's questionings: \"It is no one. You do not understand me. It is something stronger than I,\" she says; and we hear the _Pelléas_ theme, dulcetly harmonized, in the strings. When, later, Golaud mentions his brother's name inquiringly, and she replies that she thinks he dislikes her, although he speaks to her sometimes, we hear, very softly, the theme of _Awakening Desire_. As their talk progresses to its climax, there is a recurrence of the _Fate_ theme; then, as Golaud, upon discovering the loss of her wedding-ring, harshly tells her that he \"would rather have lost everything than that,\" the trombones and tuba declaim (page 99, measure 5) a threatening and sinister phrase which will later be more definitely associated with the thought of Golaud's vengeful purpose:   XI. VENGEANCE  [Illustration: Anime, un peu retenu]  This is repeated still more vehemently three measures further on, and there is a return of the _Fate_ motive as Mélisande, at the bidding of Golaud, goes forth to seek the missing ring. An interlude, in which are blended the variant of the _Mélisande_ theme, which denotes her grieving, and the shimmering figure in sixteenth-notes heard during the dialogue at the fountain, leads into the scene before the grotto.  As Pelléas and Mélisande stand in the darkness of the cavern we hear again (page 110, measure 2) the variant of the _Fate_ motive which marked the close of the preceding scene; then, as a sudden shaft of moonlight illuminates the grotto, it is expanded and transmuted into a gleaming flood of orchestral and harmonic color (two flutes, oboe, two harps _glissando_, string tremolos, cymbals _pp_). While they talk of the beggars sleeping in a corner of the cave, an oboe and flute trace a tenuous and melancholy phrase (_doux et triste_) which continues almost to the end of the scene; it leads into a quiet coda formed out of the theme of _Fate_.     ACT III  After several bars of preluding by flute, harp, violas, and 'cellos (harmonics), on an arpeggio figure, _ppp_, flutes and oboe present (page 115, measure 6) a theme which, in an ampler version, dominates the entire scene. Its complete form, in which I conceive it to be suggestive of the magic of night, is as follows (page 118, measure 2):   XII. NIGHT  [Illustration: Modéré sans lenteur]  It continues in the orchestra until, as Pelléas urges Mélisande to lean further out of the window that he may see her hair unbound, a new theme enters, seeming to"]]]
