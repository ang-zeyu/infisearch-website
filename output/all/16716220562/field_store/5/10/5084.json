And up in a tree I have heard a thrush singing the song of a seraph and I have said, as I looked at the eggs, “You would have been singers too, but you were forsaken.”  These boys—they did not forsake their chum. They said, “Buck up, old boy. We’ll help you.”  “No,” he said. “This is my job.”  So they stood by him and cheered him on. People, I say again, don’t die of overmuch love, but for the want of a bit of it. These boys stood by my champion swearer, and when he was putting the polishing touches on the last gun he stood up, his face radiant, like a man that has fought a battle and won: “Boys, this is the last gun I shall clean for anybody under these conditions, because, God helping me, I’m going to see this thing through.”  And he _is_ seeing it through.                  *       *       *       *       *  I was at a home for limbless men the other day—there are over one hundred and eighty of them in that home. I held my hand out to shake hands with the first two men I met, and they laughed at me. I looked down for their hands—they hadn’t got one between them! I took the face of one of those dear boys and I patted it. I wanted to kiss it with gratitude. I wonder how you feel!  I walked round amongst those boys—one hundred and eighty limbless! I found one boy without legs and without an arm. He was just a trunk, and his comrades, those who could, were carrying him around. He was the sunshine in the whole place—not a grouse. They are doing no grousing—your boys there. When they see you they just say, “Cheerio.”  A friend of mine, a minister, went to see one of these boys, and he was wondering what he could say to him; he thought he had got to cheer him up. The boy looked at the padre and said,  “Guv’nor, don’t get down-hearted. I am going to make money out of this job. Why, I shall only want a pair of trousers with one leg, and I shall only want a coat with one sleeve, and I shall only want a pair of boots with one boot.”  It reminds me of the question I once asked: “Sonny, what struck you most when you got in the trenches?” and the reply came sharp,  “A bit of shrapnel.”  Another of your boys, just picked up in the trenches by those tender fellows, the stretcher-bearers, those men with the hands of a woman and with the heart of a mother—God bless them!—called out as they came to him, “_Home, John_.” And when he was passing the officer and they were carrying him into the Red Cross train, he cried, “_Season_.” He had two gold stripes already. That’s the spirit of your boys.                  *       *       *       *       *  There was a dear old Scotchman from Aberdeen. A telegram had come to that granite city to say that his boy was badly wounded, and he ran all the way to the station and jumped into a train without stopping to put on a collar. You don’t think of collars when your boys are dying. I saw him when he landed. It was my job to help him. The dear old fellow was just in time to see his boy die—and afterwards he came and laid his head on my shoulder and he sobbed. And I wept too. He was seventy.  Presently he said, “It will be hard to go home and tell mother that her only boy has gone, but I’ve got a message for her. ‘Father,’ my boy said, ‘tell mother I am not afraid to die. I have found Jesus. Tell mother that.’”  There are some people who think you are not doing Christian work unless you have a hymn-book in one hand and a Bible in the other and are singing, “Come to Jesus.” I am glad I haven’t to live with that kind of people. I call them the Lord’s Awkward Squad.  If you take “firstly,” “secondly,” “thirdly,” out to the front with you, by the time you get to thirdly the boys will be in the trenches. I never take an old sermon out with me to France. I write my prescription after I’ve seen my patients.  I was talking to a thousand boys one day. “Boys,” I said, “how many of you have written to your mother this week?”  Now, that’s a proper question. I wonder what would happen if the preacher stopped in his sermon next Sunday morning and said, “Have you paid your debts this week?” “In what sort of a temper did you come down to breakfast this morning?”  If a man’s religion does not get into every detail of his life he may profess to be a saint, but he’s a fraud. Religion ought to permeate life and make it beautiful—as lovely as a breath of perfume from the garden of the Lord.  The boys have given me the privilege of talking straight to them. “If you don’t write, you know what you’ll get,” I said, and I began to give out the note-paper. I can give boys writing-paper and envelopes and sell them a cup of coffee or a packet of cigarettes with as much religion as I can stand in a pulpit and talk about them. Why, my Master washed people’s feet and cooked a breakfast for hungry fishermen. He kindled the fire with the hands that were nailed to a tree for humanity. There are no secular things if you are in the spirit of the Master—they are all Divine.  I went on dealing the note-paper out, and presently a clergyman came to me and said, “Gipsy Smith, a man in my room wants to see you.”  When I got there, I saw he was crying, sobbing.  “I am not a kid,” he said; “I am a man. I’m forty-one. You told me to write to my mother. Read that,” he said, throwing down a letter; and this is what I read:    “My dear Mother,    “It’s seven years since I wrote you last. I’ve done my best to   break your heart and to turn your hair grey. I’ve lived a bad   life, but it’s come to an end. I have given my heart to God. I   won’t ask you to believe me, or to forgive me. I deserve   neither. But I ask for a bit of time that I may prove my   sincerity.                                                    “Your boy still,                                                            “Jack.”  “Shall I put a bit at the bottom for a postscript?” I asked. “But first of all, let us pray.”  We got on our knees, and I said, “You begin.”  “I’m not used to it,” he replied.  “Begin; never mind how. Did you ever pray?”  “Yes,” he said; “I prayed as a child.”  “Start with that, then—He loves cradle faith.”  It took him some time, but presently he began with his mother’s prayer, “Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me.” When he got to the third line there was a big lump in his throat and one in mine, and then he gave me a dig with his elbow and said, “You’ll have to finish”—and I finished.  I put my postscript to that letter. “God has saved him,” I wrote. “Believe him. Write and tell him you forgive him.”  And when that mother got that she knew that giving out note-paper was religion.                  *       *       *       *       *  I was in a cemetery just behind the lines, walking among the graves of our dear lads who have fallen, and weeping for those at home who weep over graves that they will never see. There I found an old soldier who had been to the woods and had cut a big bundle of box trimmings. He was setting a little border of box round the graves.  “But,” I said to him, “they won’t strike. It’s not the right time of year—and the ground’s too dry.”  “I know, sir,” he said, “but it will look as if somebody cares.”  God’s jewels lie deep, and if you will dig deep enough you will find them—so I took the trouble to dig a little deeper. I said, “Nobody will see them here.”  “Yes, sir, the angels will. You taught me to think like this in one of the meetings in the huts, and since I can’t do any more in the fight”—for he was disabled—“I am putting in my time caring for the boys’ graves, and if the wives and mothers don’t see them—well”—and his face lit up with a radiance that I can’t put into words—“the angels will, sir.”                  *       *       *       *       *  I have had your boys say to me, “Gipsy, does it mean Blighty, or does it mean West?” I have had to say to some of them, “It doesn’t mean Blighty.”  A sister took me to see one dear fellow. He was blown up by a mine, both his legs and his arm were broken.  “I was lying out there, after the mine blew up, for twenty-four hours, and I was half buried,” he told me.  Fancy lying out there in No Man’s Land for twenty-four hours with both legs broken and an arm!  I said, “Sonny, you have had a rough time.”  And this was his reply: “They copped me, worse luck, before I had a pot at them.”  You can’t beat these boys of yours, the nation’s boys, the best boys of our homes, the flower of our manhood, the noblest and the dearest that God ever gave to a people. These boys, they are worth everything in the world, and there is _nothing_ you and I can do will ever repay them for what they are doing for you and for me.                  *       *       *       *       *  When the great end of the day comes, the greatest joy of all will be the joy of knowing you have tried to make somebody else’s life happy. It is the flowers that you have made grow in unlikely places that will tell—not how much money you have made, not how big a house you have lived in, not how popular you were in the world of letters, of science, of finance, but—how many burdens have you lifted? How many dark hearts have you lightened? You can’t do too much for your boys. Remember what they are doing for you. Remember the lives that are being laid down for you.  I shook hands with a boy a little while ago in Scarborough, and he said, “I believe I hold the record for having lost most in the war. I have lost five brothers, my sister was killed in the war, and my mother died of a broken heart through grief, but,” he said, “I’ll give my next week’s pay, sir, towards this new hut.”  Another boy, when I was making my appeal, said, “I’ve been wounded and I am discharged. I’ll give my next week’s pay,” and up jumped a war-widow and she said, “I’ll give my next week’s pension.”  I was talking in Doncaster, and I had a batch of wounded men from one of the local hospitals—a batch of twenty dressed in blue—and every one of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16495"],["title","Your Boys (#5)"],["body","gave something; and when I looked round and said, “Boys, why are you giving?” one said, “Well, sir, we’re grateful for what it did for us when we were there.”  People say, “What are you going to do with the huts after the war?” We want to pick them up, and bring them back to this country and put one down in every parish in the land, so that when the boys do come back they will still have the Y.M.C.A. hut to go into, so that they can still keep up the spirit of unity.  Woe be to the man who goes into the hut and tries to preach sectarianism. The Y.M.C.A. is creating a spirit of unity amongst the boys, and that is going on all the time. I want the limitations to vanish at home. I want the ecclesiastical barriers to go. When you get to Heaven the Lord will have to give Gabriel a job to introduce many Christians to one another. You should see your boys, how they mix up. They come in—the Roman Catholics, the Church of England, and the Nonconformists and Plymouth Brethren and Salvation Army, and all sorts—you don’t know who’s who. We are not quarrelling over religions at the front—we are fighting and dying for the folks who are doing that at home.  Let’s stop our religious nonsense. Religion’s too big to be confined within our four little walls. If our Church rules are so rigid that they won’t let us come together, then our Church rules are wrong. God never made rules which divide men—all God’s laws unite. Christ died that we might be one, and it is time we got together. Your boys are bigger than your Churches. You and I have got to rise to the opportunity. God help us to do it!                  *       *       *       *       *  Somebody asks, “Why does the Y.M.C.A. always want more new huts? Why not move the old ones?” What will the boys do who take the places of those who have gone forward? When the line goes forward, it does not come back—not in these days; it abides—and the boys who come up as a support, they take the huts the other boys leave.  The Y.M.C.A. stands for everything to your boys. It is their club, their church, their recreation-room. It is their canteen—dry canteen, you may be sure—it is their reading-room, it is their smoking-room, and why should not the Church of Jesus Christ provide places of recreation for its own people? Why should it leave the public-house and the theatre to do it all? We have lost lots of people because we have been so slow—we have lost them, you and I, but we are learning sense in these days, and the Y.M.C.A. has come to the help of the Churches, to be the communication-trench between the Churches and the people.  It is doing magnificent work.  As I write these lines I think of one dear boy, a young sergeant, a Public-School boy. I had watched him grow up. I knew his home, and as he leaned against me he said, “Gipsy, I’m homesick; I want my mother,” and then, with a sob, he said, “Tell me more about Jesus.”  I was able to talk to him about his mother because I had lost mine, and just because I love Jesus I was able to talk to him about the blessed Jesus Who comes into a man’s heart when he is sad, lonely, and homesick, and helps him.  He was lying on a stretcher, and it was my privilege to hold his hand and to kiss him for his mother.  “Gipsy,” he said, “does it mean West?”  I said, “Sonny, it means West.”  As I held his hand it flickered for a moment and he said, “I am not afraid to go. I know Christ. I found Him in your meetings, and—it’s great to die, for freedom.”  And it was a great thing for me to be with your boy then.                  *       *       *       *       *  _I thank my God upon every remembrance of your boys._"]]]
