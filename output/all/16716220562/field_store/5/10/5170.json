Here too were ballads on the old ballad paper and     in the old confusion of types, with an old man in a     cocked hat, and an armchair, for the illustration     to Will Watch the bold smuggler, and the Friar of     Orders Grey, represented by a little girl in a hoop,     with a ship in the distance. All these as of yore,     when they were infinite delights to me.  On one of his explorations he met a landsman who told him about the running down of an emigrant ship, and how he heard a sound coming over the sea 'like a great sorrowful flute or Aeolian harp.' He makes another and very humorous reference to this instrument in a letter to Landor, in which he calls to mind      that steady snore of yours, which I once heard piercing     the door of your bedroom ... reverberating along the     bell-wire in the hall, so getting outside into the     street, playing Aeolian harps among the area railings,     and going down the New Road like the blast of a trumpet.  The deserted watering-place referred to in _Out of the Season_ is Broadstairs, and he gives us a further insight into its musical resources in a letter to Miss Power written on July 2, 1847, in which he says that      a little tinkling box of music that stops at 'come'     in the melody of the Buffalo Gals, and can't play 'out     to-night,' and a white mouse, are the only amusements     left at Broadstairs.  'Buffalo Gals' was a very popular song 'Sung with great applause by the Original Female American Serenaders.' (_c._ 1845.) The first verse will explain the above allusion:      As I went lum'rin' down de street, down de street,     A 'ansom gal I chanc'd to meet, oh, she was fair to view.     Buffalo gals, can't ye come out to-night, come out to-night,             come out to-night;     Buffalo gals, can't ye come out to-night, and dance by the             light of the moon.  We find some interesting musical references and memories in the novelist's letters. Writing to Wilkie Collins in reference to his proposed sea voyage, he quotes Campbell's lines from 'Ye Mariners of England':      As I sweep     Through the deep     When the stormy winds do blow.  There are other references to this song in the novels. I have pointed out elsewhere that the last line also belongs to a seventeenth-century song.  Writing to Mark Lemon (June, 1849) he gives an amusing parody of      Lesbia hath a beaming eye,  beginning      Lemon is a little hipped.  In a letter to Maclise he says:      My foot is in the house,       My bath is on the sea,     And before I take a souse,       Here's a single note to thee.  These lines are a reminiscence of Byron's ode to Tom Moore, written from Venice on July 10, 1817:      My boat is on the shore,       And my bark is on the sea,     But before I go, Tom Moore,       Here's a double health to thee!  The words were set to music by Bishop. This first verse had a special attraction for Dickens, and he gives us two or three variations of it, including a very apt one from Dick Swiveller (see p. 126).  Henry F. Chorley, the musical critic, was an intimate friend of Dickens. On one occasion he went to hear Chorley lecture on 'The National Music of the World,' and subsequently wrote him a very friendly letter criticizing his delivery, but speaking in high terms of the way he treated his subject.  In one of his letters he makes special reference to the singing of the Hutchinson family.[5] Writing to the Countess of Blessington, he says:      I must have some talk with you about these American     singers. They must never go back to their own country     without your having heard them sing Hood's 'Bridge     of Sighs.'  Amongst the distinguished visitors at Gad's Hill was Joachim, who was always a welcome guest, and of whom Dickens once said 'he is a noble fellow.' His daughter writes in reference to this visit:      I never remember seeing him so wrapt and absorbed as     he was then, on hearing him play; and the wonderful     simplicity and _un_-self-consciousness of the genius     went straight to my father's heart, and made a fast     bond of sympathy between those two great men.   _In Music Drama_  Much has been written about Dickens' undoubted powers as an actor, as well as his ability as a stage manager, and it is well known that it was little more than an accident that kept him from adopting the dramatic profession. He ever took a keen interest in all that pertained to the stage, and when he was superintending the production of a play he was always particular about the musical arrangements. There is in existence a play-bill of 1833 showing that he superintended a private performance of _Clari_. This was an opera by Bishop, and contains the first appearance of the celebrated 'Home, Sweet Home,' a melody which, as we have already said, he reproduced on the accordion some years after. He took the part of Rolano, but had no opportunity of showing off his singing abilities, unless he took a part in the famous glee 'Sleep, gentle lady,' which appears in the work as a quartet for alto, two tenors, and bass, though it is now arranged in other forms.  In his dealings with the drama Dickens was frequently his own bandmaster and director of the music. For instance, in _No Thoroughfare_ we find this direction: 'Boys enter and sing \"God Save the Queen\" (or any school devotional hymn).' At Obenreizer's entrance a 'mysterious theme is directed to be played,' that gentleman being 'well informed, clever, and a good musician.'  Dickens was concerned in the production of one operetta--_The Village Coquettes_--for which he wrote the words, and John Hullah composed the music. It consists of songs, duets, and concerted pieces, and was first produced at St. James's Theatre, London, on December 6, 1836. The following year it was being performed at Edinburgh when a fire broke out in the theatre, and the instrumental scores together with the music of the concerted pieces were destroyed. No fresh copy was ever made, but the songs are still to be obtained. Mr. Kitton, in his biography of the novelist, says, 'The play was well received, and duly praised by prominent musical journals.'  The same writer gives us to understand that Hullah originally composed the music for an opera called _The Gondolier_, but used the material for _The Village Coquettes_. Braham, the celebrated tenor, had a part in it. Dickens says in a letter to Hullah that he had had some conversation with Braham about the work. The singer thought very highly of it, and Dickens adds:      His only remaining suggestion is that Miss     Rainforth[6] will want another song when the piece is     in rehearsal--'a bravura--something in \"The soldier     tired\" way.'  We have here a reference to a song which had a long run of popularity. It is one of the airs in Arne's _Artaxerxes_, an opera which was produced in 1761, and which held the stage for many years. There is a reference to this song in _Sketches by Boz_, when Miss Evans and her friends visited the Eagle. During the concert 'Miss Somebody in white satin' sang this air, much to the satisfaction of her audience.  Dickens wrote a few songs and ballads, and in most cases he fell in with the custom of his time, and suggested the tune (if any) to which they were to be sung. In addition to those that appear in the various novels, there are others which deserve mention here.  In 1841 he contributed three political squibs in verse to the _Examiner_, one being the 'Quack Doctor's Proclamation,' to the tune of 'A Cobbler there was,' and another called 'The fine old English Gentleman.'  For the _Daily News_ (of which he was the first editor) he wrote 'The British Lion, a new song but an old story,' which was to be sung to the tune of the 'Great Sea Snake.' This was a very popular comic song of the period, which described a sea monster of wondrous size:      One morning from his head we bore       With every stitch of sail,     And going at ten knots an hour       In six months came to his tail.  Three of the songs in the _Pickwick Papers_ (referred to elsewhere) are original, while Blandois' song in _Little Dorrit_, 'Who passes by this road so late,' is a translation from the French. This was set to music by R.S. Dalton.  In addition to these we find here and there impromptu lines which have no connexion with any song. Perhaps the best known are those which 'my lady Bowley' quotes in _The Chimes_, and which she had 'set to music on the new system':      Oh let us love our occupations,     Bless the squire and his relations,     Live upon our daily rations,     And always know our proper stations.  The reference to the 'new system' is not quite obvious. Dickens may have been thinking of the 'Wilhem' method of teaching singing which his friend Hullah introduced into England, or it may be a reference to the Tonic Sol-fa system, which had already begun to make progress when _The Chimes_ was written in 1844.[7]  There are some well-known lines which owners of books were fond of writing on the fly-leaf in order that there might be no mistake as to the name of the possessor. The general form was something like this:      John Wigglesworth is my name,       And England is my nation;     London is my dwelling-place,       And Christ is my salvation.  (See _Choir_, Jan., 1912, p. 5.) Dickens gives us at least two variants of this. In _Edwin Drood_, Durdles says of the Mayor of Cloisterham:      Mister Sapsea is his name,       England is his nation,     Cloisterham's his dwelling-place,       Aukshneer's his occupation.  And Captain Cuttle thus describes himself, ascribing the authorship of the words to Job--but then literary accuracy was not the Captain's strong point:      Cap'en Cuttle is my name,       And England is my nation,     This here is my dwelling-place,       And blessed be creation.  It is said that there"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16595"],["title","Charles Dickens and Music (#3)"],["body"," in the _London Singer's Magazine_ for 1839 'The Teetotal Excursion, an original Comic Song by Boz, sung at the London Concerts,' but it is not in my copy of this song-book, nor have I ever seen it.  Dickens was always very careful in his choice of names and titles, and the evolution of some of the latter is very interesting. One of the many he conceived for the magazine which was to succeed _Household Words_ was _Household Harmony_, while another was _Home Music_. Considering his dislike of bells in general, it is rather surprising that two other suggestions were _English Bells_ and _Weekly Bells_, but the final choice was _All the Year Round_. Only once does he make use of a musician's name in his novels, and that is in _Great Expectations_. Philip, otherwise known as Pip, the hero, becomes friendly with Herbert Pocket. The latter objects to the name Philip, 'it sounds like a moral boy out of a spelling-book,' and as Pip had been a blacksmith and the two youngsters were 'harmonious,' Pocket asks him:      'Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There's     a charming piece of music, by Handel, called the     \"Harmonious Blacksmith.\"'      'I should like it very much.'  Dickens' only contribution to hymnology appeared in the _Daily News_ February 14, 1846, with the title 'Hymn of the Wiltshire Labourers.' It was written after reading a speech at one of the night meetings of the wives of agricultural labourers in Wiltshire, held with the object of petitioning for Free Trade. This is the first verse:      O God, who by Thy Prophet's hand       Did'st smite the rocky brake,     Whence water came at Thy command       Thy people's thirst to slake,     Strike, now, upon this granite wall,       Stern, obdurate, and high;     And let some drop of pity fall       For us who starve and die!  We find the fondness for Italian names shown by vocalists and pianists humorously parodied in such self-evident forms as Jacksonini, Signora Marra Boni, and Billsmethi. Banjo Bones is a self-evident _nom d'occasion_, and the high-sounding name of Rinaldo di Velasco ill befits the giant Pickleson (_Dr. M._), who had a little head and less in it. As it was essential that the Miss Crumptons of Minerva House should have an Italian master for their pupils, we find Signer Lobskini introduced, while the modern rage for Russian musicians is to some extent anticipated in Major Tpschoffki of the Imperial Bulgraderian Brigade (_G.S._). His real name, if he ever had one, is said to have been Stakes.  Dickens has little to say about the music of his time, but in the reprinted paper called _Old Lamps for New Ones_ (written in 1850), which is a strong condemnation of pre-Raphaelism in art, he attacks a similar movement in regard to music, and makes much fun of the Brotherhood. He detects their influence in things musical, and writes thus:      In Music a retrogressive step in which there is much     hope, has been taken. The P.A.B., or pre-Agincourt     Brotherhood, has arisen, nobly devoted to consign to     oblivion Mozart, Beethoven, Handel, and every other     such ridiculous reputation, and to fix its Millennium     (as its name implies) before the date of the first     regular musical composition known to have been achieved     in England. As this institution has not yet commenced     active operations, it remains to be seen whether the     Royal Academy of Music will be a worthy sister of the     Royal Academy of Art, and admit this enterprising body     to its orchestra. We have it, on the best authority,     that its compositions will be quite as rough and     discordant as the real old original.  Fourteen years later he makes use of a well-known phrase in writing to his friend Wills (October 8, 1864) in reference to the proofs of an article.      I have gone through the number carefully, and have     been down upon Chorley's paper in particular, which     was a 'little bit' too personal. It is all right now     and good, and them's my sentiments too of the Music     of the Future.[8]  Although there was little movement in this direction when Dickens wrote this, the paragraph makes interesting reading nowadays in view of some musical tendencies in certain quarters.   [1]  In his speech at Birmingham on 'Literature and Art'      (1853) he makes special reference to the 'great music      of Mendelssohn.'  [2]  Moore's _Irish Melodies_.  [3]  Moore.  [4]  'Seven Dials! the region of song and poetry--first      effusions and last dying speeches: hallowed by the      names of Catnac and of Pitts, names that will entwine      themselves with costermongers and barrel-organs, when      penny magazines shall have superseded penny yards of      song, and capital punishment be unknown!' (_S.B.S._ 5.)  [5]  The 'Hutchinson family' was a musical troupe composed of      three sons and two daughters selected from the 'Tribe of      Jesse,' a name given to the sixteen children of Jesse      and Mary Hutchinson, of Milford, N.H. They toured in      England in 1845 and 1846, and were received with great      enthusiasm. Their songs were on subjects connected      with Temperance and Anti-Slavery. On one occasion      Judson, one of the number, was singing the 'Humbugged      Husband,' which he used to accompany with the fiddle,      and he had just sung the line 'I'm sadly taken in,'      when the stage where he was standing gave way and he      nearly disappeared from view. The audience at first      took this as part of the performance.  [6]  Miss Rainforth was the soloist at the first production      of Mendelssohn's 'Hear my Prayer.' (See _The Choir_,      March, 1911.)  [7]  John Curwen published his _Grammar of Vocal Music_      in 1842.  [8]  Quoted in Mr. R.C. Lehmann's _Dickens as an Editor_      (1912).     CHAPTER II  INSTRUMENTAL COMBINATIONS  VIOLIN, VIOLONCELLO, HARP, PIANO   Dickens' orchestras are limited, both in resources and in the number of performers; in fact, it would be more correct to call them combinations of instruments. Some of them are of a kind not found in modern works on instrumentation, as, for instance, at the party at Trotty Veck's (_Ch._) when a 'band of music' burst into the good man's room, consisting of a drum, marrow-bones and cleavers, and bells, 'not _the_ bells but a portable collection on a frame.' We gather from Leech's picture that other instrumentalists were also present. Sad to relate, the drummer was not quite sober, an unfortunate state of things, certainly, but not always confined to the drumming fraternity, since in the account of the Party at Minerva House (_S.B.T._) we read that amongst the numerous arrivals were 'the pianoforte player and the violins: the harp in a state of intoxication.'  We have an occasional mention of a theatre orchestra, as, for instance, when the Phenomenon was performing at Portsmouth (_N.N._):      'Ring in the orchestra, Grudden.'      That useful lady did as she was requested, and shortly     afterwards the tuning of three fiddles was heard,     which process, having been protracted as long as it     was supposed that the patience of the orchestra could     possibly bear it, was put a stop to by another jerk of     the bell, which, being the signal to begin in earnest,     set the orchestra playing a variety of popular airs     with involuntary variations.  On one occasion Dickens visited Vauxhall Gardens by day, where 'a small party of dismal men in cocked hats were \"executing\" the overture to _Tancredi_,' but he does not, unfortunately, give us any details about the number or kind of instruments employed. This would be in 1836, when the experiment of day entertainments was given a trial, and a series of balloon ascents became the principal attraction. Forster tells us that Dickens was a frequent visitor at the numerous gardens and places of entertainment which abounded in London, and which he knew better than any other man. References will be found elsewhere to the music at the Eagle (p. 47) and the White Conduit Gardens (p. 93).   _Violin and Kit._  We meet with but few players on the violin, and it is usually mentioned in connexion with other instruments, though it was to the strains of a solitary fiddle that Simon Tappertit danced a hornpipe for the delectation of his followers, while the same instrument supplied the music at the Fezziwig's ball.      In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to     the lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned     like fifty stomach-aches.  The orchestra at the 'singing-house' provided for Jack's amusement when ashore (_U.T._ 5) consisted of a fiddle and tambourine; while at dances the instruments were fiddles and harps. It was the harps that first aroused Mr. Jingle's curiosity, as he met them being carried up the staircase of The Bull at Rochester, while, shortly after, the tuning of both harps and fiddles inspired Mr. Tupman with a strong desire to go to the ball. Sometimes the orchestra is a little more varied. At the private theatricals which took place at Mrs. Gattleton's (_S.B.T._ 9), the selected instruments were a piano, flute, and violoncello, but there seems to have been a want of proper rehearsal.      Ting, ting, ting! went the prompter's bell at eight     o'clock precisely, and dash went the orchestra into     the overture to the _Men of Prometheus_. The pianoforte     player hammered away with laudable perseverance, and the     violoncello, which struck in at intervals, sounded very     well, considering. The unfortunate individual, however,     who had undertaken to play the flute accompaniment     'at sight' found, from fatal experience, the perfect     truth of the old adage, 'Out of sight, out of mind';     for being very near-sighted, and being placed at     a considerable distance from his music-book, all he     had an opportunity of doing was to play a bar now and     then in the wrong place, and put the other performers     out. It is, however, but justice to Mr. Brown to     say that he did "]]]
