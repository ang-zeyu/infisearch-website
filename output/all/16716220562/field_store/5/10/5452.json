For we bolt 'em, chew 'em, drink 'em, Million billion bar'ls of beastly, cloyin'        clammy jam!       We are sorry-sick of peaches,         'N' we're full right up of plum,      'N' innards fairly screeches         When the tins of apple come.      Back of Blighty piled in cases,         Jist as close as they can cram,      Fillin' all the open spaces,         Is the 'jam, jam, JAM!      Oh, the woe the soldiers face is, Monday, Sunday, ruddy, muddy, boundless        bogs of jam.    WEEPIN' WILLIE.  WHEY our trooper hit wide water every      heart was yearin' back To the little 'ouse at Coogee or a hut at Bar-      renjack. She was 'ookin' up to spike the stars, or rootin'      in the wave, An' me liver turned a hand spring with each      buck the beggar gave. Then we pulls a sick 'n' silly smile 'n' tips a      saucy lid, Crackin' hardy. Willie didn't. Willie      snivelled like a kid.  At Gallip' the steamer dumped us, 'n' we got      right down to work, Whoopin' up the hill splendacious, playin'      tiggie with the Turk. When the stinkin' Abdul hit us we curled      down upon a stone, 'N' we yelled for greater glory, crackin' 'ardy      on our own. Not so Willie. He was cursin', cold ez death      'n' grey ez steel, 'N' the smallest thing that busted made the      little blighter squeal.  In the bitter day's that follered, spillin' life be-      side the sea, We would fake a spry expression for the things      that had to be, Always dressin' up the winder, crackin' 'ardy      though we felt Fearful creepy in the whiskers, very cold be-      neath the belt. But his jills would sniff 'n' shiver in the mother      of a fright, 'N' go blubberin' 'n' quakin' out to waller in      the fight.  In the West we liked the weather, 'n' we fat-      tened in the mud, Crackin' 'ardy, stewed together, rats an'      slurry men 'n' blood. Weepin' Willie wouldn't have it these was      pleasin' things abed, 'N' he shuddered in his shimmy if they passed      him with the dead. When he cried about his mother, in a gentle      voice he'd tell Them as dumb-well didn't like it they could go      to sudden 'ell.  There was nothin' sweet for Willie in a rough-      up in the wet; But if all things scared him purple, not a thing      had stopped him yet. If some chaps was wanted urgent special dirty      work to do Willie went in with a shudder, but he alwiz      saw it through. Oh, a busy little body was our Willie in a      crush! Then he'd cry out in the night about the faces      in the slush.  Well they pinked him one fine mornin' with      a thumpin' 'unk iv shell; Put it in 'n' all across him. What he was      you couldn't tell. I saw him stitched 'n' mended where he      whimpered in his bed, 'N' he'd on'y lived because he was afraid to      die, he said. Sez he \"Struth, they're out there fightin',      trimmin' Boshes good 'n' smart, While I'm bedded here 'n' 'elpless. It fair      breaks a feller's 'eart.\"  But he came again last Tuesday '-n' we go it      in a breath-- \"London's big 'n' black 'n' noisy. It would      scare a bloke to death.\" He's away now in the trenches, white 'n'      nervous, but, you bet, Playin' lovely 'ands of poker with his busy      bay-o-net, 'Fraid of givin' 'n' of takin', 'fraid of gases,      'fraid of guns-- But a champion lightweight terror to the gor-      forsaken 'Uns!    BILLJIM  DOWN to it is Plugger Bill, Lyin' crumpled, white 'n' still.      Me 'n' him Chips in when the scrap begins, Carin' nothin' for our skins, Chi-iked as the 'Eavenly Twins-      Bill 'n' Jim.  They 'ave outed Bill at last, Slugged me cobber hard 'n' fast.      It's a kill. See the purple of his lip 'N' the red 'n' oozy drip! Ends our great ole partnership-      Jim 'n' Bill  Mates we was when we was kids; Camp, 'n' ship, 'n' Pyramids,      Him 'n' me Hung together, 'n' we tore Up the heights from Helles shore, Bill a long 'arf head afore,      Fine to see!  Then it was we took a touch- Simple puncture, nothin' much;      But we lay 'N' we stays the count, it seems, In a sorter realm of dreams Where the sun infernal gleams      Night 'n' day;  Boilin', fryin' achin', dumb, Waitin' till the stretchers come,      Patiently. I hangs on to 'arf a cup. Which I wants ole Bill to sup. Damn if he ain't savin' up      His for me!  When they come to lift my head I am softly kiddin' dead,      For a game, So's they'll first take on his gills. Over, though, me scheme he spills- Bli'me, this ole take-down Bill's      Done the same!  But he isn't kiddin' now, And it knocks me anyhow      Seein' him. We was both agreed before, Though it got 'em by the score, Two was goin' to beat this war-      But 'n' Jim.  Mate o' mine, yiv stayed it through. Hard luck, Bill-for me 'n' you      Hard 'n' grim. They have got me Cobber true, But I'm stickin' tight ez glue.... Bill, there's one who'll plug for two-      It is Jim!    THE CRUSADERS.  WHAT price yer humble, Dicko Smith,     in gaudy putties girt,  With sand-blight in his optics, and much     leaner than he started, Round the 'Oly Land cavorting in three-    quarters of a shirt,  And imposin' on the natives ez one Dick     the Lion 'Earted?  We are drivin' out the infidel, we're hittin'    up the Turk,  Same ez Richard slung his right across the     Saracen invader In old days of which I'm readin'. Now    we're gettin' in our work,  'N' what price me nibs, I ask yeh, ez a     qualified Crusader!  'Ere I am, a thirsty Templar in the fields of    Palestine,  Where that hefty little fighter, Bobby     Sable, smit the heathen, And where Richard Coor de Lion trimmed    the Moslem good 'n' fine,  'N' he took the belt from Saladin, the     slickest Dago breathin'.  There's no plume upon me helmet, 'n' no red    cross on me chest,  'N' so fur they haven't dressed me in a     swanking load of metal; We've no 'Oly Grail I know of, but we do    our little best  With a jamtin, 'n' a billy, 'n' a battered     ole mess kettle.  Quite a lot of guyver missin' from our brand    of chivalry;  We don't make a pert procession when     we're movin' up the forces; We've no pretty, pawin' stallion, 'n' no    pennants flowin' free,  'N' no giddy, gaudy bedquilts make a     circus of the 'orses.  We 'most always slip the cattle 'n' we cut out    all the dog  When it fairly comes to buttin' into battle's     hectic fever, Goin' forward on our wishbones, with our    noses in the bog,  'N' we 'eave a pot iv blazes at the cursed     unbeliever.  Fancy-dress them old Crusaders wore,    and alwiz kep' a band.  What we wear's so near to nothin' that it's     often 'ardly proper, And we swings a tank iv iron scrap across    the 'Oly Land  From a dinkie gun we nipped ashore the     other side of Jopper.  We ain't ever very natty, for the climate here    is hot;  When it isn't liquid mud the dust is thicker     than the vermin. Ten to one our bold Noureddin is some wad-    dlin' Turkish pot,  'N' the Saladin we're on to is a snortin'     red-eyed German.  But be'old the eighth Crusade, 'n' Dicko    Smith is in the van,  Dicko Coor de Lion from Carlton what     could teach King Dick a trifle, For he'd bomb his Royal Jills from out his    baked-pertater can,  Or he'd pink him full of leakage with a     quaint repeatin' rif1e.  We have sunk our claws in Mizpah, and    Siloam is in view.  By my 'alidom from Agra we will send the     Faithful reelin'! Those old-timers botched the contract, but we    mean to put it through.  Knights Templars from Balmain, the Port,     Monaro, Nhill, andl Ealin'.  We 'are wipin' up Jerus'lem; we were ready    with a hose  Spoutin' lead, a dandy cleaner that you bet     you can rely on; And Moss Isaacs, Cohn, and Cohen, Moses,    Offelbloom 'n' those  Can all pack their bettin' bags, and come    right home again to Zion.    PEACE, BLESSED PEACE.  HERE in the flamin' thick of thick of things,    With Death across the way, 'n' traps What little Fritz the German flings    Explodin' in yer lunch pe'aps, It ain't all glory for a bloke',    It ain't all corfee 'ot and stoo, Nor wavin' banners in the smoke, Or practisin' the bay'net stroke--    We has our little troubles, too!  Here's Trigger Ribb bin seein' red    'N' raisin' Cain because he had, Back in the caverns iv his 'ead,    A 'oller tooth run ravin' mad. Pore Trigger up 'n' down the trench    Was jiggin' like a blithered loan, 'N' every time she give a wrench You orter seen the beggar blench,    You orter 'eard him play a toon.  The sullen shells was pawin' blind,    A-feelin' for us grim as sin, While now 'n' then we'd likely find    A dizzy bomb come limpin' in. But Trigger simply let 'er sizz.    He 'ardly begged to be excused. This was no damn concern of his. He twined a muffler round his phiz,    'N' fearful was the words he used.  Lest we be getting' cock-a-whoop    Ole 'Ans tries out his box of tricks. His bullets all around the coop   Is peckin' like a million chicks. But Trigger when they barks his snout    Don't sniff at it. He won't confess They're on the earth--ignores the clout, 'N' makes the same old sung about    His brimmin' mug of bitterness.  They raided us there in the mud    One day afore the dead sun rose. Me oath, the mess of stuff and blood    Would give a slaughterman the joes! And when the scrap is past and done,    Where's Trigger Ribb? The noble youth Has got his bay'net in a Hun, While down his cheeks the salt tears run.    Sez he to me \"Gorbli'--this tooth!\"  A shell hoist Trigger in a tree.    We found him motherin' his jor. \"If this ache's goin' on,\" sez he,    \"So 'elp me, it'll spoil the war!\" Five collared Trigger on his perch,    They wired his molar to a bough, Then give the anguished one a lurch, 'N' down he pitches. From that birch    His riddled tooth is hangin' now.  This afternoon it's merry 'ell;    Grenades is comin' by the peck; A big gun times us true 'n well,    And, oh! we gets"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16904"],["title","'Hello, Soldier!'

But Trigger's pottin' all the while; He sports a fond 'n' foolish smile-    \"Thank Gord,\" he sez, \"a bit of peace!\"    THE HAPPY GARDENERS.  WE were storemen, clerks and packers on    an ammunition dump Twice the size of Cootamundra, and the goods    we had to hump They were bombs as big as water-butts, and    cartridges in tons, Shells that looked like blessed gasmains, and    a line in traction-guns.  We had struck a warehouse dignity in dealing    with the stocks. It was, \"Sign here, Mr. Eddie!\" \"Clarkson,    forward to the socks!\" Our floor-walker was a major, with a nozzle    like a peach, And a stutter in his Trilbies; and a limping    kind of speech.  We were off at eight to business, we were free    for lunch at one, And we talked of new Spring fashions, and the    brisk trade being done. After five we sought our dugouts lying snug    beneath the hill, Each with hollyhocks before it and geraniums    on the sill.  Singing \"Home, Sweet home,\" we swept,    and scrubbed, and dusted up the place, Then smoked out on the doorstep in the twi-    light's tender grace. After which with spade and rake we sought    our special garden plot, And we 'tended to the cabbage and the shrink-    ing young shallot.  So long lived we unmolested that this seemed    indeed \"the life.\" Set apart from mirk and worry and the inci-    dence of strife; And we trimmed our Kitchen Eden, swapping    vegetable lore, Whi1e the whole demented world beside was    muddled up with war.  There was little talk of Boches and of bloody    battle scenes, But a deal about Bill's spuds and Billy    Carkeek's butter-beans; Porky specialised on onion and he had a sort    of gift For a cabbage plump and tender that it took    two men to lift.  In the pleasant Sabbath morning, when the    sun lit on our \"street,\" And illumed the happy dugout with effulgence    kind and sweet, It was fine to see us forking, raking, picking    off the bugs, Treading flat the snails and woodlice and    demolishing the slugs.  Then one day old Fritz got going. He had    a hint of us, And the shell the blighter posted was as roomy    as a 'bus; He was groping round the dump, and kind of    pecking after it; When he plugged the hill the world heeled up,    the dome of heaven split.  Then, 0 Gott and consternation! Swooped a    shell a and stuck her nose In Carkeek's beans. Those beans came up!    A cry of grief arose! As we watched them--plunk! another shell    cut loose, and everywhere Flew the spuds of Billy Murphy. There were    turnips in the air.  Bill! she tore a quarter-acre from the land-    scape. With it burst Tommy's carrots, and we watched them, and    in whispers prayed and cursed. Then a wail of anguish 'scaped us. Boomed    in Porky's cabbage plot A detestable concussion. Porky's cabbages    were not!  There the Breaking strain was reached, for    Porky fetched an awful cry, And he rushed away and armed himself.    With loathing in his eye, Up and over went the hero. He was savage    Through and through, And he tore across the distance like a mad-    dened kangaroo.  They had left a woeful sight indeed--frail cab-    bages all rent, Turnips mangled, little carrots all in one red    burial blent, Parsnips ruined, lettuce shattered, torn and    wilted beet and bean, And a black and grinning gap where once our    garden flourished green.     .   .   .   .   .   . Five and fifty hours had passed when came a    German in his shirt. On his back he carried Porky black with    blood, and smoke and dirt. \"I sniped six of 'em,\" said Porky, \"an' me    pris'ner here,\" he sez- \"I done in the crooel swine what strafed me    helpless cabba-ges.\"    THE GERM  I TOOK to khaki at a word,    And fashioned dreams of wonder. I rode the great sea like a bird,    Chock full of blood and thunder. I saw myself upon the field    Of battle, framed in glory, Compelling stubborn foes to yield As captives to my sword and shield--    This is another story.  We sat about in sun and sand,    We broke old Cairo's images, Met here and there a swarthy band    In little, friendly scrimmages, And here it is I start to kid    No Moslem born can hit me. The Germ then that had long laid hid Came out of Pharaoh's pyramid,    And covertly he bit me.  For some few days I wore an air    Of pensive introspection, And then I curled down anywhere.    They whispered of infection, And hoist me on two sticks as though    I bore the leper's label, And took me where, all in a row Of tiny beds, two score or so    Were raising second Babel;  But no man talked to any one.    And no bloke knew another. This soldier raved about his gun,    And that one of his mother. They were the victims of the Germ,    The imp that Satan pricks in, First cousin to the Coffin Worm, Whose uncomputed legions squirm    Some foul, atomic Styx in.  The Germ rides with the plunging shell,    Or on the belts that fret you, Or in a speck of dust may well    One thousand years to get you; Well ambushed in a tunic fold    He waits his special mission, And never lad so big and bold But turns to water in his hold    And dribbles to perdition.  Where is war's pomp and circumstance,    The gauds in which we prank it? Germ ends for us our fine romance,    Wrapped in a dingy blanket. We set out braggartly in mirth,    World's bravest men and tallest, To do the mightiest thing on earth, And here we're lying, nothing worth,    Succumbent to the smallest!    JOEY'S JOB.  IN days before the trouble Jo was rated as      a slob. He chose to sit in hourly expectation of a job. He'd loop hisself upon a post, for seldom      friends had he, A gift of patient waitin' his distinctif quality. He'd linger in a doorway, or he'd loiter on the      grass, Edgin' modestly aside to let the fleetin'      moments pass.  Jo' begged a bob from mother, but more often      got a clout, And settled down with cigarettes to smoke the      devil out. The one consistent member of the Never      Trouble Club, He put a satin finish on the frontage of the      pub. His shoulder-blades were pokin' out from      polishin' the pine; But if a job ran at him Joey's footwork was      divine.  Jo strayed in at the cobbler's door, but, scoffed      at as a fool, He found the conversation too exhaustin' as      a rule; Or, canted on the smithy coke, he'd hoist his      feet and yawn, His boots slid up his shinbones, and his pants      displayin' brawn: And if the copper chanced along 'twas beauty-      ful to see Joe wear away and made hisself a fadest      memory.  Then came the universal nark. The Kaiser      let her rip. They cleared the ring. The scrap was for the      whole world's championship. Jo Brown was takin' notice, lurkin' shy be-      neath his hat, And every day he crept to see the drillin' on      the flat. He waited, watchin' from the furze the blokes      in butcher's blue, For the burst of inspiration that would tell him      what to do.  He couldn't lean, he couldn't lie. He yelled      out in the night. Jo understood--he'd all these years been      spoilin' for a fight! Right into things he flung himself. He      took his kit and gun, Mooched gladly in the dust, or roasted gaily      in the sun. \"Gorstruth,\" he said, with shining eyes, \"it      means a frightful war, 'N' now I know this is the thing that Heaven      meant me for.\"  Jo went away a corporal and fought again the      Turk, And like a duck to water Joey cottoned to the      work. If anythin' was doin' it would presently come      out That Joseph Brown from Booragool was there      or thereabout. He got a batch of medals, and a glorious      renown Attached all of a sudden to the name of      Sergeant Brown.  Then people talked of Joey as the dearest      friend they had; They were chummy with his uncles, or ac-      quainted with his dad. Joe goes to France, and presently he figure as      the best Two-handed all-in fighter in the armies of the      West, And men of every age at home and high and      low degree, We gather now, once went to school with      Sergeant Brown, V.C.  Then Hayes and Jo, in Flanders met, and very      proud was Hayes To shake a townsman by the hand, and sing      the hero's praise, \"Oh, yes,\" says Jo, \"I'm doin' well, 'n' yet      I might do more. If I was in a hurry, mate, to finish up this war I'd lay out every Fritz on earth, but, strike me,      what a yob A man would be to work himself out of a      flamnin' job!\"  Now Jo's a swell lieutenant, and he's keepin'      up the pace. Ha \"Record\" says Lieutenant Brown's an      honor to the place. The town gets special mention every time he      scores. We bet If peace don't mess his chances up, he'll be      Field-Marshal yet. Dad, mother and the uncles Brown and all our      people know That Providence began this war to find a grip      for Jo!    THE GIRL I LEFT BEHIND ME.  I SAID: \"I leave my bit of land-    In khaki they've entwined me, I go abroad to lend a hand.\" Said she: \"My love, I understand. I will be true, and though we part A thousand years you hold my heart\"-    The girl I left behind me.  I went away to fight the Huns-    No coward thought could bind me, I sizzled n the tropic suns, I faced the bayonets and the guns. And when in daring deeds I shone One little woman spurred me on-    The girl I left behind me.  Out there, in grim Gallipoli.    Hard going they assigned me, I pricked the Turk up from the sea; I riddled him, he punctured me; And, bleeding in my rags, I said: \"She'll meet me somewhere if I'm dead-    The girl I left behind me.  In France we broke the German's face-    They tried with gas to blind me. In mud we bogged from front to base, And dirt was ours, but not disgrace. They carved me till I couldn't stand. Said I \"Now for the Lodden, and    The girl I left behind me.  I came ashore, and struck the track;    For dust you scarce could find me. The dear girl gave no welcome back- Shed changed her names and"]]]
