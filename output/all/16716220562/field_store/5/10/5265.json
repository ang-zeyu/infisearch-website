But, then, we don't think there's a pin to choose;     If the Guards are handsome, so are the Blues.     It's a narrow choice between Sappers and Gunners.     You sow blue beans, and rear scarlet runners.     Then think of the blue of a mid-day sky,     Of the sea, and the hills, and a Scotchman's eye;     Of peacock's feathers, forget-me-nots,     Worcester china and \"jap\" tea-pots.     The blue that the western sky wears casually,     Sapphire, turquoise, and lapis-lazuli.           What can look smarter     Than the broad blue ribbon of Knights of the Garter?     And, if the subject is not too shocking,     An intellectual lady's stocking.           And who that loves hues             Could fail to mention           The wonderful blues             Of the mountain gentian?\"     But to all that his brothers and sisters said,     He made no reply but--\"I wish I were dead!     I'm all over blue, and I want to be red.\"     And he moped and pined, and took to his bed.     \"That little one looks uncommonly sickly,     Put him back in the sea, and put him back quickly.\"     The voice that spoke was the voice of Fate,     And the lobster was soon in his former state;     Where, as of old, he muttered and mumbled,     And growled and grumbled:     \"Oh dear! what shall I do?     I want to be red, and I'm all over blue.\"      I don't think I ever met with a book     The evil genius of which was a cook;             But it thus befell,     In the tale I have the honour to tell;     For as he was fretting and fuming about,     A fisherman fished my hero out;     And in process of time, he heard a voice,             Which made him rejoice.     The voice was the cook's, and what she said     Was, \"He'll soon come out a beautiful red.\"              He was put in the pot,             The water was very hot;     The less we say about this the better,     It was all fulfilled to the very letter.     He did become a beautiful red,     But then--which he did not expect--he was dead!      Some gentle readers cannot well endure       To see the ill end of a bad beginning;     And hope against hope for a nicer cure       For naughty heroes than to leave off sinning.     And yet persisting in behaving badly,     Do what one will, does commonly end sadly.      But things in general are so much mixed,       That every case must stand upon its merits;     And folks' opinions are so little fixed,       And no one knows the least what he inherits--     I should be glad to shed some parting glory     Upon the hero of this simple story.      It seems to me a mean end to a ballad,     But the truth is, he was made into salad;     It's not how one's hero should end his days,           In a mayonnaise,     But I'm told that he looked exceedingly nice,     With cream-coloured sauce, and pale-green lettuce and ice.      I confess that if he'd been my relation,     This would not afford me any consolation;     For I feel (though one likes to speak well of the dead)     That it must be said,     He need not have died so early lamented,     If he'd been content to live contented.        P.S.--His claws were raised to very high stations;             They keep the earwigs from our carnations.         THE YELLOW FLY.      A TALE WITH A STING IN IT.      [Illustration]                      Ah!             There you are!     I was certain I heard a strange voice from afar.     Mamma calls me a pup, but I'm wiser than she;     One ear cocked and I hear, half an eye and I see;     Wide-awake though I doze, not a thing escapes me.                     Yes!             Let me guess:     It's the stable-boy's hiss as he wisps down Black Bess.     It sounds like a kettle beginning to sing,     Or a bee on a pane, or a moth on the wing,     Or my master's peg-top, just let loose from the string.      [Illustration]                     Well!             Now I smell,     I don't know who you are, and I'm puzzled to tell.     You look like a fly dressed in very gay clothes,     But I blush to have troubled my mid-day repose     For a creature not worth half a twitch of my nose.      [Illustration]                     How now?             Bow, wow, wow!     The insect imagines we're playing, I vow!     If I pat you, I promise you'll find it too hard.     Be off! when a watch-dog like me is on guard,     Big or little, no stranger's allowed in the yard.                     Eh?             \"Come away!\"     My dear little master, is that what you say?     I am greatly obliged for your kindness and cares,     But I really can manage my own small affairs,     And banish intruders who give themselves airs.      [Illustration]                     Snap!             Yap! yap! yap!     You defy me?--you pigmy, you insolent scrap!     What!--this to my teeth, that have worried a score     Of the biggest rats bred in the granary floor!     Come on, and be swallowed! I spare you no more!                     Help!             Yelp! yelp! yelp!     Little master, pray save an unfortunate whelp,     Who began the attack, but is now in retreat,     Having shown all his teeth, just escapes on his feet,     And is trusting to you to make safety complete.      [Illustration]                     Oh!             Let me go!     My poor eye! my poor ear! my poor tail! my poor toe!     Pray excuse my remarks, for I meant no such thing.     Don't trouble to come--oh, the brute's on the wing!     I'd no notion, I'm sure, there were flies that could sting.                     Dear me!             I can't see.     My nose burns, my limbs shake, I'm as ill as can be.     I was never in such an undignified plight.     Mamma told me, and now I suppose she was right;     One should know what one's after before one shows fight.         [Illustration]      CANADA HOME.       Some Homes are where flowers for ever blow,       The sun shining hotly the whole year round;     But our Home glistens with six months of snow,       Where frost without wind heightens every sound.         And Home is Home wherever it is,         When we're all together and nothing amiss.      Yet Willy is old enough to recall       A Home forgotten by Eily and me;     He says that we left it five years since last Fall,       And came sailing, sailing, right over the sea.         But Home is Home wherever it is,         When we're all together and nothing amiss.      Our other Home was for ever green,       A green, green isle in a blue, blue sea,     With sweet flowers such as we never have seen;       And Willy tells all this to Eily and me.         But Home is Home wherever it is,         When we're all together and nothing amiss.      He says, \"What fine fun when we all go back!\"       But Canada Home is very good fun     When Pat's little sled flies along the smooth track,       Or spills in the snowdrift that shines in the sun.         For Home is Home wherever it is,         When we're all together and nothing amiss.      Some day I should dearly love, it is true,       To sail to the old Home over the sea;     But only if Father and Mother went too,       With Willy and Patrick and Eily and me.         For Home is Home wherever it is,         When we're all together and nothing amiss.         THE POET AND THE BROOK.      A TALE OF TRANSFORMATIONS.       A little Brook, that babbled under grass,               Once saw a Poet pass--     A Poet with long hair and saddened eyes,     Who went his weary way with woeful sighs.               And on another time,     This Brook did hear that Poet read his rueful rhyme.             Now in the poem that he read,               This Poet said--     \"Oh! little Brook that babblest under grass!     (_Ah me! Alack! Ah, well-a-day! Alas!_)             Say, are you what you seem?     Or is your life, like other lives, a dream?     What time your babbling mocks my mortal moods,             Fair Naïad of the stream!             And are you, in good sooth,     Could purblind poesy perceive the truth,               A water-sprite,     Who sometimes, for man's dangerous delight,     Puts on a human form and face,     To wear them with a superhuman grace?      \"When this poor Poet turns his bending back,     (_Ah me! Ah, well-a-day! Alas! Alack!_)     Say, shall you rise from out your grassy bed,     With wreathed forget-me-nots about your head,               And sing and play,     And wile some wandering wight out of his way,           To lead him with your witcheries astray?     (_Ah me! Alas! Alack! Ah, well-a-day!_)               Would it be safe for me               That fateful form to see?\"     (_Alas! Alack! Ah, well-a-day! Ah me!_)      So far the Poet read his pleasing strain,             Then it began to rain:             He closed his book.     \"Farewell, fair Nymph!\" he cried, as with a lingering look           His homeward way he took;           And nevermore that Poet saw that Brook.      The Brook passed several days in anxious expectation               Of transformation     Into a lovely nymph bedecked with flowers;     And longed impatiently to prove those powers--     Those dangerous powers--of witchery and wile,     That should all mortal men mysteriously beguile;     For life as running water lost its charm     Before the exciting hope of doing so much harm.               And yet the hope seemed vain;               Despite the Poet's strain,     Though the days came and went, and went and came,     The seasons changed, the Brook remained the same.      The Brook was almost tired     Of vainly hoping to become a Naïad;     When on a certain Summer's day,     Dame Nature came that way,               Busy as usual,               With great and small;     Who, at the water-side     Dipping her clever"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16688"],["title","Hymns, Songs, and Fables, for Young People (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net.

REVISED AND ENLARGED FROM THE LAST EDITION.  BOSTON: WM. CROSBY AND H.P. NICHOLS, 118 WASHINGTON STREET.  1851.  [Illustration]  Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1846, by WM. CROSBY AND H.P. NICHOLS, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the District of Massachusetts.  CAMBRIDGE: STEREOTYPED AND PRINTED BY METCALF AND COMPANY, PRINTERS TO THE UNIVERSITY.     PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.  BY CHARLES FOLLEN.   This little book is dedicated to parents and children. Most of the poems were written with no other hope, than that they would instruct or please some child. The pleasure they have given in a limited circle has tempted the writer to print them. Some have never before appeared in public, but most of them have been already published in different works; some few, without the author's knowledge.  It will be found that these poems are intended for children of different ages and characters. It may be objected to the book, that gay and serious pieces are bound up together; but so it is in human life and human nature, and it is essential to the healthful action of a child's mind that it should be so. The smile that overtakes its tears is as necessary to the child as the sun after a spring shower is to the young plant; and without it a blight will fall upon the opening blossom.  The natural love that all have for their literary offspring, perhaps, first induced the author to bring the stray little family together. This motive was strengthened by the hope that children might love the book, and that she might have the pleasure of seeing it among their treasures, with the corners of the leaves well worn by their little fingers, and perhaps sometimes placed upon the pillow where \"angels hover round.\"  This success, which must secure to her also the approbation of parents, she does aspire after, and most earnestly desire; this, and this alone, will satisfy her; without this, she would be the first to pronounce it an unworthy offering.  CAMBRIDGE, May 19, 1831.     PREFACE  TO THE PRESENT EDITION.   The present edition of Hymns, Songs, and Fables, has been greatly enlarged, by poems either not before printed, or that have had a very limited circulation, and also by a number of translations from the German. If they should have the good fortune to add to the innocent pleasure of the young, and deserve to become associated in their minds with the pure and hallowed recollections of home, and happy early days, my highest ambition with regard to them be entirely gratified.

Often on these pages look,--       Of the love of God they tell;     'Tis indeed a holy book,--       Learn to read and love it well.      Thus you hear the Saviour speak,--       \"Come ye all and learn of me\";     He was gentle, lowly, meek,--       So should all his followers be.      When our Saviour from above,       From his Father did descend,     He took them in his arms of love,       And children knew him for their friend.      All little children Jesus blessed,--       Blessed in innocence they are;     Little children he caressed;       Praise him in your infant prayer.   HYMN.      Praise to God! O let us raise     From our hearts a song of praise!     Of that goodness let us sing     Whence our lives and blessings spring.      Praise to him who made the light,     Praise to him who gave us sight,     Praise to him who formed the ear;     Will he not his children hear?      Praise him for our happy hours,     Praise him for our varied powers,     For these thoughts that rise above,     For these hearts he made for love,      For the voice he placed within,     Bearing witness when we sin;     Praise to him whose tender care     Keeps this watchful guardian there.      Praise his mercy, that did send     Jesus for our guide and friend;     Praise him, every heart and voice,     Him who makes all worlds rejoice.   HYMN FOR A LITTLE BOY.      \"What, mother, makes it seem to me,       When I am all alone,     As if some one could hear and see,       And all my thoughts were known?      \"Sometimes it makes me very glad,       And dance and sing with joy;     Sometimes it makes me very sad,       And frights your little boy.      \"O, tell me, mother, tell me why;       For I have never known     Why 'tis I laugh, or why I cry,       When I am all alone.\"      \"My child, you never are alone;       There is a watchful eye     To which your very thoughts are known;       'Tis God is ever nigh.      \"He made your little heart for joy,       He tunes your happy song;     O, then, my little timid boy,       Fear only doing wrong.      \"For he who makes your heart so glad,       Who bids the good be gay,     With the same love will make it sad,       Whene'er you disobey.      \"He is our Father, and he hears       Your weakest, faintest prayer;     He wipes away an infant's tears,       And children are his care.\"   \"THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH.\"      Almighty Father! I am weak,       But thou wilt strengthen me,     If from my heart I humbly seek       For help and light from thee.      When I am tempted to do wrong,       Then, Father, pity me,     And make my failing virtue strong;       Help me to think of thee!      Let Christian courage guard my youth;       That courage give to me     Which ever speaks and acts the truth,       And puts its trust in thee.   HYMN.      Will God, who made the earth and sea,       The night, and shining day,     Regard a little child like me,       And listen when I pray?      If I am hungry, poor, and cold,       Then will he hear my cry?     And when I shall be sick and old,       O, then will God be nigh?
