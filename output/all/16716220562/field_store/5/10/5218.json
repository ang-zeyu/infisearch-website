Let any man cast his eye over the pages of this portion of the  press--it matters little to which party the newspaper or the journal  may belong--he will be startled to find the characters of those whom  he has most deeply reverenced, whose hearts he knows, whose integrity  and life are above suspicion, held up to scorn and hatred: the organ  of one party is established against the organ of another, and it is  the recognised office of each to point out with microscopic care the  names of those whose views are to be shunned; and in order that these  may be the more shrunk from, the characters of those who hold such  opinions are traduced and vilified. There is no personality too  mean--there is no insinuation too audacious or too false for the  recklessness of these daring slanderers. I do not like to use the  expression, lest it should appear to be merely one of theatrical  vehemence; but I say it in all seriousness, adopting the inspired  language of the Bible, and using it advisedly and with accurate  meaning, the spirit which guides the \"religious press\" of this  country, which dictates those personalities, which prevents  controversialists from seeing what is good in their opponents, which  attributes low motives to account for excellent lives, and teaches  men whom to suspect, and shun, rather than point out where it is  possible to admire and love--is a spirit \"set on fire of hell.\"   Before we conclude, let us get at the root of the matter. \"Man,\" says  the Apostle James, \"was made in the image of God:\" to slander man is  to slander God: to love what is good in man is to love it in God. Love  is the only remedy for slander: no set of rules or restrictions can  stop it; we may denounce, but we shall denounce in vain. The radical  cure of it is Charity--\"out of a pure heart and faith unfeigned,\" to  feel what is great in the human character; to recognise with delight  all high, and generous, and beautiful actions; to find a joy even in  seeing the good qualities of your bitterest opponents, and to admire  those qualities even in those with whom you have least sympathy--be it  either the Romanist or the Unitarian--this is the only spirit which  can heal the love of slander and of calumny. If we would bless God, we  must _first_ learn to bless man, who is made in the image of God.      II.   _Preached May 5, 1850._   THE VICTORY OF FAITH.      \"For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is     the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he     that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the     Son of God?\"--1 John v. 4-5.   There are two words in the system of Christianity which have received  a meaning so new, and so emphatic, as to be in a way peculiar to it,  and to distinguish it from all other systems of morality and religion;  these two words are--the World, and Faith. We find it written in  Scripture that to have the friendship of the world is to be the enemy  of God--- whereupon the question arises--The world?--did not God make  the world? Did He not place us in the world? Are we not to love what  God has made? And yet meeting this distinctly we have the inspired  record, \"Love not the World.\"   The object of the Statesman is, or ought to be, to produce as much  worldly prosperity as possible--but Christianity, that is Christ,  speaks little of this world's prosperity, underrates it--nay, speaks  of it at times as infinitely dangerous.   The legislator prohibits crime--the moralist transgression--the  religionist sin. To these Christianity superadds a new enemy--the  world and the things of the world. \"If any man love the world, the  love of the Father is not in him.\"   The other word used in a peculiar sense is Faith. It is impossible for  any one to have read his Bible ever so negligently, and not to be  aware that the word Faith, or the grace of Faith, forms a large  element in the Christian system. It is said to work miracles, remove  mountains, justify the soul, trample upon impossibilities. Every  apostle, in his way, assigns to faith a primary importance. Jude  tells us to \"build up ourselves in our most holy faith.\" John tells us  that--\"he that believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is the born of  God;\" and Paul tells us that, not by merit nor by works, but by trust  or reliance only, can be formed that state of soul by which man is  reckoned just before God. In these expressions, the apostles only  develope their Master's meaning, when He uses such words as these,  \"All things are possible to him that believeth:\" \"O thou of little  faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?\"   These two words are brought into diametrical opposition in the text,  so that it branches into a two-fold line of thought      I. The Christian's enemy, the World.    II. The victory of Faith.   In endeavouring to understand first what is meant by the world, we  shall feel that the mass of evil which is comprehended under this  expression, cannot be told out in any one sermon; it is an expression  used in various ways, sometimes meaning one thing, sometimes meaning  another;-but we will endeavour to explain its general principles--and  these we will divide into three heads; first, the tyranny of the  present; secondly, the tyranny of the sensual; and lastly, the spirit  of society.   1. The tyranny of the present.   \"Christ,\" says the Apostle Paul, \"hath redeemed us from this present  evil world;\" and again, \"Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this,  present world.\"   Let a stress be laid on the word _present_. Worldliness is the  attractive power of something present, in opposition to something to  come. It is this rule and tyranny of the present that constitutes  Demas a worldly man.   In this respect, worldliness is the spirit of childhood carried on  into manhood. The child lives in the present hour--to-day to him is  everything. The holiday promised at a distant interval is no holiday  at all--it must be either now or never. Natural in the child, and  therefore pardonable, this spirit, when carried on into manhood, is  coarse--is worldliness. The most distinct illustration given us of  this, is the case of Esau. Esau came from the hunting-field worn and  hungry; the only means of procuring the tempting mess of his brother's  pottage was the sacrifice of his father's blessing, which in those  ages carried with it a substantial advantage; but that birthright  could be enjoyed only after _years_--the pottage was _present_, near,  and certain; therefore he sacrificed a future and higher blessing, for  a present and lower pleasure. For this reason Esau is the Bible type  of worldliness: he is called in Scripture a profane, that is, not a  distinctly vicious, but a secular or worldly person--an overgrown  child; impetuous, inconsistent, not without gleams of generosity and  kindliness, but ever accustomed to immediate gratification.   In this worldliness, moreover, is to be remarked the gamester's  desperate play. There is a gambling spirit in human nature. Esau  distinctly expresses this: \"Behold I am at the point to die, and what  shall my birthright profit me?\" He might never live to enjoy his  birthright; but the pottage was before him, present, certain, _there_.   Now, observe the utter powerlessness of mere preaching to cope with  this tyrannical power of the present. Forty thousand pulpits  throughout the land this day, will declaim against the vanity of  riches, the uncertainty of life, the sin of worldliness--against the  gambling spirit of human nature; I ask what _impression_ will be  produced by those forty thousand harangues? In every congregation it  is reducible to a certainty that, before a year has passed, some will  be numbered with the dead. Every man knows this, but he thinks the  chances are that it will not be himself; he feels it a solemn thing  for Humanity generally--but for himself there is more than a chance.  Upon this chance he plays away life.   It is so with the child: you tell him of the consequences of to-day's  idleness--but the sun is shining brightly, and he cannot sacrifice  to-day's pleasure, although he knows the disgrace it will bring  to-morrow. So it is with the intemperate man: he says--\"Sufficient  unto the day is the evil, and the good thereof; let me have my portion  now.\" So that one great secret of the world's victory lies in the  mighty power of saying \"_Now_.\"   2. The tyranny of the sensual.   I call it _tyranny_, because the evidences of the senses are all  powerful, in spite of the protestations of the reason. In vain you try  to persuade the child that _he_ is moving, and not the trees which  seem to flit past the carriage--in vain we remind ourselves that this  apparently solid earth on which we stand, and which seems so  immoveable, is in reality flying through the regions of space with an  inconceivable rapidity--in vain philosophers would persuade us that  the colour which the eye beholds, resides not in the object itself,  but in our own perception; we are victims of the apparent, and the  verdict of the senses is taken instead of the verdict of the reason.   Precisely so is it with the enjoyments of the world. The man who died  yesterday, and whom the world called a successful man--for what did he  live?--He lived for this world--he gained this world. Houses, lands,  name, position in society--all that earth could give of enjoyments--he  had: he was the man of whom the Redeemer said that his thoughts were  occupied in planning how to pull down his barns and build greater. We  hear men complain of the sordid love of gold, but gold is merely a  medium of exchange for other things: gold is land, titles, name,  comfort--all that the world can give. If the world be _all_, it is  _wise_ to live for gold. There may be some little difference in the  degree of degradation in different forms of worldliness; it is  possible that the ambitious man who lives for power is somewhat"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16645"],["title","Sermons Preached at Brighton (#4)"],["body","than he who merely lives for applause, and he again may be a trifle  higher than the mere seeker after gold--but after all, looking closely  at the matter, you will find that, in respect of the objects of their  idolatry, they agree in this, that all belong to the present.  Therefore, says the Apostle, all that is in the world--\"the lust of  the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the  Father, but of the world,\" and are only various forms of one great  tyranny. And then when such a man is at the brink of death, the words  said to the man in our Lord's parable must be said to him. \"Thou fool,  the houses thou hast built, the enjoyments thou hast prepared; and all  those things which have formed thy life for years--when thy soul is  taken from them, what shall they profit thee?\"   3. The spirit of society.   The _World_ has various meanings in Scripture; it does not always mean  the Visible, as opposed to the Invisible; nor the Present, as opposed  to the Future: it sometimes stands for the secular spirit of the  day--the Voice of Society.   Our Saviour says, \"If ye were of the world, the world would love his  own.\" The apostle says, \"Be not conformed to this world;\" and to the  Gentiles he writes, \"In time past ye walked according to the course of  this world, the spirit which now worketh in the children of  disobedience.\" In these verses, a tone, a temper, a spirit is spoken  of. There are two things--the Church and the World--two spirits  pervading different bodies of men, brought before us in these  verses--those called the Spirit-born, and those called the World,  which is to be overcome by the Spirit-born, as in the text,  \"Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world.\"   Let us understand what is meant by the Church of God. When we speak of  the Church we generally mean a society to aid men in their progress  God-wards; but the Church of God is by no means co-extensive in any  age with that organized institution which we _call_ the Church;  sometimes it is nearly co-extensive--that is, nearly all on earth who  are born of God are found within its pale, nearly all who are of the  world are extraneous to it--but sometimes the born of God have been  found distinct from the Institution called the Church, opposed to  it--persecuted by it. The Institution of the Church is a blessed  ordinance of God, organized on earth for the purpose of representing  the Eternal Church and of extending its limits, but still ever  subordinate to it.   The Eternal Church is \"the general assembly and church of the  first-born which are written in heaven;\" the selected spirits of the  most High, who are struggling with the evil of their day; sometimes  alone, like Elijah, and like him, longing that their work was done;  sometimes conscious of their union with each other. God is for ever  raising up a succession of these--His brave, His true, His good.  Apostolical succession, as taught sometimes, means simply this--a  succession of miraculous powers flowing in a certain line. The true  apostolic succession is--not a succession in an hereditary line, or  line marked by visible signs which men can always identify, but a  succession emphatically spiritual.   The Jews looked for an hereditary succession; they thought that  because they were Abraham's seed, the spiritual succession was  preserved; the Redeemer told them that \"God was able of those stones  to raise up children unto Abraham.\" Therefore is this ever a spiritual  succession--in the hands of God alone; and they are here called the  God-born, coming into the world variously qualified; sometimes  baptized with the spirit which makes them, like James and John, the  \"Sons of Thunder,\" sometimes with a milder spirit, as Barnabas, which  makes them \"Sons of Consolation,\" sometimes having their souls  indurated into an adamantine hardness, which makes them living  stones--rocks like Peter, against which the billows of this world dash  themselves in vain, and against which the gates of hell shall not  prevail. But whether as apostles, or visitors of the poor, or parents  of a family, born to do a work on earth, to speak a word, to discharge  a mission which they themselves perhaps do not know till it is  accomplished--these are the Church of God--the children of the Most  High--the noble army of the Spirit-born! Opposed to this stands the  mighty confederacy called the World. But beware of fixing on  individual men in order to stigmatize _them_ as the world. You may not  draw a line and say--\"We are the sons of God, ye are of the world.\"  The world is not so much individual as it is a certain spirit; the  course of this world is \"the spirit which now worketh in the children  of disobedience.\" The world and the Church are annexed as inseparably  as the elements which compose the atmosphere. Take the smallest  portion of this that you will, in a cubic inch the same proportions  are found as in a temple. In the ark there was a Ham; in the small  band of the twelve apostles there was a Judas.   The spirit of the world is for ever altering--impalpable; for ever  eluding, in fresh forms, your attempts to seize it. In the days of  Noah, the spirit of the world was _violence_. In Elijah's day it was  _idolatry_. In the day of Christ it was _power_ concentrated and  condensed in the government of Rome. In ours, perhaps, it is the _love  of money_. It enters in different proportions into different bosoms;  it is found in a different form in contiguous towns; in the  fashionable watering place, and in the commercial city: it is this  thing at Athens, and another in Corinth. This is the spirit of the  world--a thing in my heart and yours: to be struggled against, not so  much in the case of others, as in the silent battle to be done within  our own souls. Pass we on now to consider--    II. The victory of faith.   Faith is a theological expression; we are apt to forget that it has  any other than a theological import; yet it is the commonest principle  of man's daily life, called in that region prudence, enterprise, or  some such name. It is in effect the principle on which alone any human  superiority can be gained. Faith, in religion, is the same principle  as faith in worldly matters, differing only in its object: it rises  through successive stages. When, in reliance upon your promise, your  child gives up the half-hour's idleness of to-day for the holiday of  to-morrow, he lives by faith; a future supersedes the present  pleasure. When he abstains from over-indulgence of the appetite, in  reliance upon your word that the result will be pain and sickness,  sacrificing the present pleasure for fear of future punishment, he  acts on faith: I do not say that this is a high exercise of faith--it  is a very low one--but it _is_ faith.   Once more: the same motive of action may be carried on into manhood;  in our own times two religious principles have been exemplified in the  subjugation of a vice. The habit of intoxication has been broken by an  appeal to the principle of combination, and the principle of belief.  Men were taught to feel that they were not solitary stragglers against  the vice; they were enrolled in a mighty army, identified in  principles and interests. Here was the principle of the  Church--association for reciprocated strength; they were thus taught  the inevitable result of the indulgence of the vice. The missionaries  of temperance went through the country contrasting the wretchedness  and the degradation and the filth of drunkenness with the domestic  comfort, and the health, and the regular employment of those who were  masters of themselves. So far as men believed this, and gave up the  tyranny of the present for the hope of the future--so far they lived  by faith.   Brethren, I do not say that this was a high triumph for the principle  of faith; it was in fact, little more than selfishness; it was a high  future balanced against a low present; only the preference of a future  and higher physical enjoyment to a mean and lower one. Yet still to be  ruled by this influence raises a man in the scale of being: it is a  low virtue, prudence, a form of selfishness; yet prudence _is_ a  virtue. The merchant, who forecasts, saves, denies himself  systematically through years, to amass a fortune, is not a very lofty  being, yet he is higher, as a man, than he who is sunk in mere bodily  gratifications. You would not say that the intemperate man--who has  become temperate in order, merely to gain by that temperance honour  and happiness--is a great man, but you would say he was a higher and a  better man than he who is enslaved by his passions, or than the  gambler who improvidently stakes all upon a moment's throw. The  worldly mother who plans for the advancement of a family, and  sacrifices solid enjoyments for a splendid alliance, is only _worldly_  wise, yet in that manoeuvring and worldly prudence there is the  exercise of a self-control which raises her above the mere giddy  pleasure-hunter of the hour; for want of self-control is the weakness  of our nature--to restrain, to wait, to control present feeling with a  large foresight, is human strength.   Once more, instead of a faith like that of the child, which over-leaps  a few hours, or that of the worldly man, which over-passes years,  there may be a faith which transcends the whole span of life, and,  instead of looking for temporal enjoyments, looks for rewards in a  future beyond the grave, instead of a future limited to time.   This is again a step. The child has sacrificed a day; the man has  sacrificed a little more. Faith has now reached a stage which deserves  to be called religious; not that this however, is very grand; it does  but prefer a happiness hereafter to a happiness enjoyed here--an  eternal well-being instead of a temporal well-being; it is but  prudence on a grand scale--another form of selfishness--an  anticipation of infinite rewards instead of finite, and not the "]]]
