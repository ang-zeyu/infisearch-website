I'm one of the many who fall:     But, as here I lie, it is sweet to feel,       That my honor's without a stain;--     That I only fought for my Country's weal,       And not for glory or gain.      Only a private;--yet He who reads       Through the guises of the heart,     Looks not at the splendour of the deeds,       But the way we do our part;     And when He shall take us by the hand,       And our small service own,     There'll a glorious band of privates stand       As victors around the throne!\"      The breath of the morning is heavy and chill,     And gloomily lower the mists on the hill:     The winds through the beeches are shivering low,     With a plaintive and sad _miserere_ of woe:     A quiet is over the Cottage,--a dread     Clouds the children's sweet faces,--Macpherson is dead!     VII.       'Tis Autumn,--and Nature the forest has hung     With arras more gorgeous than ever was flung     From Gobelin looms,--all so varied, so rare,     As never the princeliest palaces were.     Soft curtains of haze the far mountains enfold,     Whose warp is of purple, whose woof is of gold,     And the sky bends as peacefully, purely above,     As if earth breathed an atmosphere only of love.      But thick as white asters in Autumn, are found     The tents all bestrewing the carpeted ground;     The din of a camp, with its stir and its strife,     Its motley and strange, multitudinous life,     Floats upward along the brown slopes, till it fills     The echoing hollows afar in the hills.      'Tis the twilight of Sabbath,--and sweet through the air,     Swells the blast of the bugle, that summons to prayer:     The signal is answered, and soon in the glen     Sits Colonel Dunbar in the midst of his men.      The Chaplain advances with reverent face,     Where lies a felled oak, he has chosen his place;     On the stump of an ash-tree the Bible he lays,     And they bow on the grass, as he solemnly prays.      Underneath thine open sky,       Father, as we bend the knee,     May we feel thy presence nigh,      --Nothing 'twixt our souls and thee!      We are weary,--cares and woes       Lay their weight on every breast,     And each heart before thee knows,       That it sighs for inward rest.      Thou canst lift this weight away,       Thou canst bid these sighings cease;     Thou canst walk these waves and say       To their restless tossings--\"Peace!\"      We are tempted;--snares abound,--       Sin its treacherous meshes weaves;     And temptations strew us round,       Thicker than the Autumn leaves.      Midst these perils, mark our path,       Thou who art 'the life, the way;'     Rend each fatal wile that hath       Power to lead our souls astray.      Prince of Peace! we follow Thee!       Plant thy banner in our sight;     Let thy shadowy legions be       Guards around our tents to-night.\"      Through the aisles of the forest, far-stretching and dim     As a cloister'd Cathedral, the notes of a hymn     Float tenderly upward,--now soft and now clear,     As if twilight had silenced its breathing to hear;     Now swelling, a lofty, triumphant refrain,--     Now sobbing itself into sadness again.      The Bible is opened, and stillness profound     Broods over the listeners scattered around;     And warning, and comfort, and blessing, and balm,     Distil from the beautiful words of the Psalm.     Then simply and earnestly pleading,--his face     Lit up with persuasive and eloquent grace,     The Chaplain pours forth, from the warmth of his heart,     His words of entreaty and truth, ere they part.      \"I see before me valiant men,       With courage high and true,     Who fight as only heroes fight,       And die, as heroes do.      Your serried ranks have never quailed       Before the battle-shock,     Whose maddest fury beats and breaks       Like foam against the rock.      Ye've borne the deadly brunt of war,       Through storm, and cold, and heat,     Yet never have ye turned your backs       Nor fled before defeat.      Behind you lie your cheerful homes,       And all of sweet or fair,--     The only remnants earth has left       Of Eden-life, are there.      Ye know that many a once bright cheek       Consuming care, makes wan;     Ye know the old, dear happiness       That blest your hearths,--is gone.      Ye see your comrades smitten down,--       The young, the good, the brave,--     Ye feel, the turf ye tread to-day,       May be to-morrow's grave.      Yet not a murmur meets the ear,       Nor discontent has sway,     And not a sullen brow is seen,       Through all the camp to-day.      No Greek, in Greece's palmiest days,       His javelin ever threw,     Impelled by more heroic zeal,       Or nobler aim than you.      No mailed warrior ever bore       Aloft his shining lance,     More proudly through the tales that fire       The page of old romance.      Oh! soldiers!--well ye bear your part;       The world awards its praise:     Be sure,--this grandest tourney o'er,--       'Twill crown you with its bays!      But there's sublimer work than even       To free your native sod;     --Ye may be loyal to your land,       Yet traitors to your God!      No Moslem heaven for him who falls,       A bribed requital doles;     And while ye save your country,--ye,       Alas! may lose your souls!      No glorious deeds can urge their claim,--       No merits, entrance win,--     The pierced hand of Christ alone,       Must freely let you in.      Oh! sirs!--there lurks a fiercer foe,       Than this that treads your soil,     Who springs from unseen ambuscades,       To drag you as his spoil.      He drugs the heedless conscience, till,       No wary watch it keeps,     And parleys with the treacherous heart,       While fast the warder sleeps.      He captive leads the wavering will       With specious words, and fair,     And enters the beleaguered soul,       And rules, a conqueror there.      Will ye who fling defiance forth,       Against a temporal foe,     And rather die, than stoop to wear       The chains that gall you so,--      Will ye succumb beneath a power,       That grasps at full control,     And binds its helpless victims down       In servitude of soul?      Nay,--act like brave men, as ye are,--       Nor let the despot, sin,     Wrest those immortal rights away,       Which Christ has died to win.      For Heaven--best home--true fatherland,       Bear toil, reproach and loss,     Your highest honor,--holiest name,--       The soldiers of the Cross!     VIII.       \"My Douglass! my darling!--there once was a time,     When we to each other confessed the sublime     And perfect sufficiency love could bestow,     On the hearts that have learned its completeness to know;     We felt that we too had a well-spring of joy,     That earthly convulsions could never destroy,--     A mossy, sealed fountain, so cool and so bright,     It could solace the soul, let it thirst as it might.      \"'Tis easy, while happiness strews in our path,     The richest and costliest blessings it hath,     'Tis easy to say that no sorrow, no pain,     Could utterly beggar our spirits again;     'Tis easy to sit in the sunshine, and speak     Of the darkness and storm, with a smile on the cheek!      \"As hungry and cold, and with weariness spent,     You droop in your saddle, or crouch in your tent;     Can you feel that the love so entire, so true,     The love that we dreamed of,--is all things to you?     That come what there may,--desolation or loss,     The prick of the thorn, or the weight of the cross--     You can bear it,--nor feel you are wholly bereft,     While the bosom that beats for you only, is left?     While the birdlings are spared that have made it so blest,     Can you look, undismayed, on the wreck of the nest?      \"There's a love that is tenderer, sweeter than this--     That is fuller of comfort, and blessing, and bliss;     That never can fail us, whatever befall--     Unchanging, unwearied, undying, through all:     We have need of the support--the staff and the rod;--     Beloved! we'll lean on the bosom of God!      \"You guess what I fain would keep hidden:--you know,     Ere now, that the trail of the insolent foe     Leaves ruin behind it, disastrous and dire,     And burns through our Valley, a pathway of fire.     --Our beautiful home,--as I write it, I weep,     Our beautiful home is a smouldering heap!     And blackened, and blasted, and grim, and forlorn,     Its chimneys stand stark in the mists of the morn!      \"I stood in my womanly helplessness, weak--     Though I felt a brave color was kindling my cheek--     And I plead by the sacredest things of their lives--     By the love that they bore to their children,--their wives,     By the homes left behind them, whose joys they had shared,     By the God that should judge them,--that mine should be spared.      \"As well might I plead with the whirlwind to stay     As it crashingly cuts through the forest its way!     I know that my eye flashed a passionate ire,     As they scornfully flung me their answer of--fire!      \"Why harrow your heart with the grief and the pain?     Why paint you the picture that's scorching my brain?     Why speak of the night when I stood on the lawn,     And watched the last flame die away in the dawn?     'Tis over,--that vision of terror,--of woe!     Its horrors I would not recall;--let them go!     I am calm when I think what I suffered them for;     I grudge not the quota _I_ pay to the war!      \"But, Douglass!--deep down in the core of my heart,     There's a throbbing, an aching, that will not depart;     For memory mourns, with a wail of despair,     The loss of her treasures,--the subtle, the rare,     Precious things over which she delighted to pore,     Which nothing,--ah! nothing, can ever restore!      \"The rose-covered porch, where I sat as your"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16480"],["title","Beechenbrook (#5)"],["body","ide--     The hearth, where at twilight I leaned at your side--     The low-cushioned window-seat, where I would lie,     With my head on your knee, and look out on the sky:--     The chamber all holy with love and with prayer,     The motherhood memories clustering there--     The vines that _your_ hand has delighted to train,     The trees that _you_ planted;--Oh! never again     Can love build us up such a bower of bliss;     Oh! never can home be as hallow'd as this!      \"Thank God! there's a dwelling not builded with hands,     Whose pearly foundation, immovable stands;     There struggles, alarms, and disquietudes cease,     And the blissfulest balm of the spirit is--peace!     Small trial 'twill seem when our perils are past,     And we enter the house of our Father at last,--     Light trouble, that here, in the night of our stay,     The blast swept our wilderness lodging away!      \"The children--dear hearts!--it is touching to see     My Beverly's beautiful kindness to me;     So buoyant his mein--so heroic--resigned--     The boy has the soul of his father, I find!     Not a childish complaint or regret have I heard,--     Not even from Archie, a petulant word:     Once only--a tear moistened Sophy's bright cheek:     '_Papa has no home now!_'--'twas all she could speak.      \"A stranger I wander midst strangers; and yet     I never,--no, not for a moment forget     That my heart has a home,--just as real, as true,     And as warm as if Beechenbrook sheltered me too.     God grant that this refuge from sorrow and pain--     This blessedest haven of peace, may remain!     And, then, though disaster, still sharper, befall,     I think I can patiently bear with it all:     For the rarest, most exquisite bliss of my life     Is wrapped in a word, Douglass ... I am your wife!\"     IX.       When fierce and fast-thronging calamities rush     Resistless as destiny o'er us, and crush     The life from the quivering heart till we feel     Like the victim whose body is broke on the wheel--     When we think we have touched the far limit at last,     --One throe, and the point of endurance is passed--     When we shivering hang on the verge of despair--     There still is capacity left us to bear.      The storm of the winter, the smile of the Spring,     No respite, no pause, and no hopefulness bring;     The demon of carnage still breathes his hot breath,     And fiercely goes forward the harvest of death.      Days painfully drag their slow burden along;     And the pulse that is beating so steady and strong,     Stands still, as there comes, from the echoing shore     Of the winding and clear Rappahannock, the roar     Of conflict so fell, that the silvery flood     Runs purple and rapid and ghastly with blood.      --Grand army of martyrs!--though victory waves     Them onward, her march must be over _their_ graves:     They feel it--they know it,--yet steadier each     Close phalanx moves into the desperate breach:     Their step does not falter--their faith does not yield,--     For yonder, supreme o'er the fiercely-fought field,     Erect in his leonine grandeur, they see     The proud and magnificent calmness of LEE!      'Tis morn--but the night has brought Alice no rest:     The roof seems to press like a weight on her breast;     And she wanders forth, wearily lifting her eye,     To seek for relief 'neath the calm of the sky.      The air of the forest is spicy and sweet,     And dreamily babbles a brook at her feet;     Her children are 'round her, and sunshine and flowers,     Try vainly to banish the gloom of the hours.     With a volume she fain her wild thoughts would assuage,     But her vision can trace not a line on the page,     And the poet's dear strains, once so soft to her ear,     Have lost all their mystical power to cheer.      The evening approaches--the pressure--the woe     Grows drearer and heavier,--yet she must go,     And stifle between the dead walls, as she may,     The heart that scarce breathed in the free, open day.      She reaches the dwelling that serves as her home;     A horseman awaits at the entrance;--the foam     Is flecking the sides of his fast-ridden steed,     Who pants, over-worn with exhaustion and speed;     And Alice for support to Beverly clings,     As the soldier delivers the letter he brings.      Her ashy lips move, but the words do not come,     And she stands in her whiteness, bewildered and dumb:     She turns to the letter with hopeless appeal,     But her fingers are helpless to loosen the seal:     She lifts her dim eyes with a look of despair,--     Her hands for a moment are folded in prayer;     The strength she has sought is vouchsafed in her need:     --\"I think I can bear it now, Beverly ... read.\"      The boy, with the resolute nerve of a man,     And a voice which he holds as serene as he can,     Takes quietly from her the letter, and reads:--      \"Dear Madam,--My heart in its sympathy bleeds     For the pain that my tidings must bear you: may God     Most tenderly comfort you, under His rod!      \"This morning, at daybreak, a terrible charge     Was made on the enemy's centre: such large     And fresh reinforcements were held at his back,     He stoutly and stubbornly met the attack.      \"Our cavalry bore themselves splendidly:--far     In front of his line galloped Colonel Dunbar;     Erect in his stirrups,--his sword flashing high,     And the look of a conqueror kindling his eye,     His silvery voice rang aloft through the roar     Of the musketry poured from the opposite shore:     --'Remember the Valley!--remember your wives!     And on to your duty, boys!--on--with your lives!'      \"He turned, and he paused, as he uttered the call--     Then reeled in his seat, and fell,--pierced by a ball.      \"He lives and he breathes yet:--the surgeons declare,     That the balance is trembling 'twixt hope and despair.     In his blanket he lies, on the hospital floor,--     So calm, you might deem all his agony o'er;     And here, as I write, on his face I can see     An expression whose radiance is startling to me.     His faith is sublime:--he relinquishes life,     And craves but one blessing,--_to look on his wife!_\"      The Chaplain's recital is ended:--no word     From Alice's white, breathless lips has been heard;     Till, rousing herself from her passionless woe,     She simply and quietly says--\"I will go.\"      There are moments of anguish so deadly, so deep--     That numbness seems over the senses to creep,     With interposition, whose timely relief,     Is an anodyne-draught to the madness of grief.     Such mercy is meted to Alice;--her eye     That sees as it saw not, is vacant and dry:     The billows' wild fury sweeps over her soul,     And she bends to the rush with a passive control.      Through the dusk of the night--through the glare of the day,     She urges, unconscious, her desolate way:     One image is ever her vision before,     --That blanketed form on the hospital floor!      Her journey is ended; and yonder she sees     The spot where _he_ lies, looming white through the trees:     Her torpor dissolves with a shuddering start,     And a terrible agony clutches her heart.      The Chaplain advances to meet her:--he draws     Her silently onward;--no question--no pause--     Her finger she lays on her lip;--if she spake,     She knows that the spell that upholds her, would break.      She has strength to go forward; they enter the door,--     And there, on the crowded and blood-tainted floor,     Close wrapped in his blanket, lies Douglass:--his brow     Wore never a look so seraphic as now!     She stretches her arms the dear form to enfold,--     God help her!..., she shrieks ..., it is silent and cold!     X.       \"Break, my heart, and ease this pain--     Cease to throb, thou tortured brain;     Let me die,--since he is slain,                      --Slain in battle!      Blessed brow, that loved to rest     Its dear whiteness on my breast--     Gory was the grass it prest,                      --Slain in battle!      Oh! that still and stately form--     Never more will it be warm;     Chilled beneath that iron storm,                      --Slain in battle!      Not a pillow for his head--     Not a hand to smooth his bed--     Not one tender parting said,                      --Slain in battle!      Straightway from that bloody sod,     Where the trampling horsemen trod--     Lifted to the arms of God;                      --Slain in battle!      Not my love to come between,     With its interposing screen--     Naught of earth to intervene;                      --Slain in battle!      Snatched the purple billows o'er,     Through the fiendish rage and roar,     To the far and peaceful shore;                      --Slain in battle!      _Nunc demitte_--thus I pray--     What else left for me to say,     Since my life is reft away?                      --Slain in battle!      Let me die, oh! God!--the dart     Rankles deep within my heart,--     Hope, and joy, and peace, depart;                      --Slain in battle!\"      'Tis thus through her days and her nights of despair,     Her months of bereavement so bitter to bear,     That Alice moans ever. Ah! little they know,     Who look on that brow, still and white as the snow,     Who watch--but in vain--for the sigh or the tear,     That only comes thick when no mortal is near,--     Who whisper--\"How gently she bends to the rod!\"     Because all her heart-break is kept for her God,--     Ah! little _they_ know of the tempests that roll     Their desolate floods through the depths of her soul!      Afar in our sunshiny homes on the shore,     We heed not how wildly the billows may roar;     We smile at our firesides, happy and free,     While the rich-freighted argosy founders at sea!     Though wrapped in the weeds of her widowhood, pale,--     Though life seems all sunless and dim through the veil     That drearily shadows her sorrowful"]]]
