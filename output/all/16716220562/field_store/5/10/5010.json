Another slight variation is furnished by the Kiriri language,[76] which is also one of the numerous South American Indian forms of speech, where we find the words to be     5.  mi biche misa    = one hand.   10.  mikriba misa sai = both hands.   20.  mikriba misa idecho ibi sai = both hands together with the feet.  Illustrations of this kind might be multiplied almost indefinitely; and it is well to note that they may be drawn from all parts of the world. South America is peculiarly rich in native numeral words of this kind; and, as the examples above cited show, it is the field to which one instinctively turns when this subject is under discussion. The Zamuco numerals are, among others, exceedingly interesting, giving us still a new variation in method. They are[77]     1.  tsomara.    2.  gar.    3.  gadiok.    4.  gahagani.    5.  tsuena yimana-ite = ended 1 hand.    6.  tsomara-hi  = 1 on the other.    7.  gari-hi     = 2 on the other.    8.  gadiog-ihi  = 3 on the other.    9.  gahagani-hi = 4 on the other.   10.  tsuena yimana-die = ended both hands.   11.  tsomara yiri-tie  = 1 on the foot.   12.  gar yiritie       = 2 on the foot.   20.  tsuena yiri-die   = ended both feet.  As is here indicated, the form of progression from 5 to 10, which we should expect to be \"hand-1,\" or \"hand-and-1,\" or some kindred expression, signifying that one hand had been completed, is simply \"1 on the other.\" Again, the expressions for 11, 12, etc., are merely \"1 on the foot,\" \"2 on the foot,\" etc., while 20 is \"both feet ended.\"  An equally interesting scale is furnished by the language of the Maipures[78] of the Orinoco, who count     1.  papita.    2.  avanume.    3.  apekiva.    4.  apekipaki.    5.  papitaerri capiti = 1 only hand.    6.  papita yana pauria capiti purena = 1 of the other hand we take.   10.  apanumerri capiti = 2 hands.   11.  papita yana kiti purena = 1 of the toes we take.   20.  papita camonee  = 1 man.   40.  avanume camonee = 2 men.   60.  apekiva camonee = 3 men, etc.  In all the examples thus far given, 20 is expressed either by the equivalent of \"man\" or by some formula introducing the word \"feet.\" Both these modes of expressing what our own ancestors termed a \"score,\" are so common that one hesitates to say which is of the more frequent use. The following scale, from one of the Betoya dialects[79] of South America, is quite remarkable among digital scales, making no use of either \"man\" or \"foot,\" but reckoning solely by fives, or hands, as the numerals indicate.     1.  tey.    2.  cayapa.    3.  toazumba.    4.  cajezea    = 2 with plural termination.    5.  teente     = hand.    6.  teyentetey = hand + 1.    7.  teyente cayapa    = hand + 2.    8.  teyente toazumba  = hand + 3.    9.  teyente caesea    = hand + 4.   10.  caya ente, or caya huena = 2 hands.   11.  caya ente-tey     = 2 hands + 1.   15.  toazumba-ente     = 3 hands.   16.  toazumba-ente-tey = 3 hands + 1.   20.  caesea ente       = 4 hands.  In the last chapter mention was made of the scanty numeral systems of the Australian tribes, but a single scale was alluded to as reaching the comparatively high limit of 20. This system is that belonging to the Pikumbuls,[80] and the count runs thus:     1.  mal.    2.  bular.    3.  guliba.    4.  bularbular = 2-2.    5.  mulanbu.    6.  malmulanbu mummi        = 1 and 5 added on.    7.  bularmulanbu mummi      = 2 and 5 added on.    8.  gulibamulanbu mummi     = 3 and 5 added on.    9.  bularbularmulanbu mummi = 4 and 5 added on.   10.  bularin murra      = belonging to the 2 hands.   11.  maldinna mummi     = 1 of the toes added on (to the 10 fingers).   12.  bular dinna mummi  = 2 of the toes added on.   13.  guliba dinna mummi = 3 of the toes added on.   14.  bular bular dinna mummi = 4 of the toes added on.   15.  mulanba dinna = 5 of the toes added on.   16.  mal dinna mulanbu    = 1 and 5 toes.   17.  bular dinna mulanbu  = 2 and 5 toes.   18.  guliba dinna mulanbu = 3 and 5 toes.   19.  bular bular dinna mulanbu = 4 and 5 toes.   20.  bularin dinna = belonging to the 2 feet.  As has already been stated, there is good ground for believing that this system was originally as limited as those obtained from other Australian tribes, and that its extension from 4, or perhaps from 5 onward, is of comparatively recent date.  A somewhat peculiar numeral nomenclature is found in the language of the Klamath Indians of Oregon. The first ten words in the Klamath scale are:[81]     1.  nash, or nas.    2.  lap   = hand.    3.  ndan.    4.  vunep = hand up.    5.  tunep = hand away.    6.  nadshkshapta = 1 I have bent over.    7.  lapkshapta   = 2 I have bent over.    8.  ndankshapta  = 3 I have bent over.    9.  nadshskeksh  = 1 left over.   10.  taunep       = hand hand?  In describing this system Mr. Gatschet says: \"If the origin of the Klamath numerals is thus correctly traced, their inventors must have counted only the four long fingers without the thumb, and 5 was counted while saying _hand away! hand off!_ The 'four,' or _hand high! hand up!_ intimates that the hand was held up high after counting its four digits; and some term expressing this gesture was, in the case of _nine_, substituted by 'one left over' ... which means to say, 'only one is left until all the fingers are counted.'\" It will be observed that the Klamath introduces not only the ordinary finger manipulation, but a gesture of the entire hand as well. It is a common thing to find something of the kind to indicate the completion of 5 or 10, and in one or two instances it has already been alluded to. Sometimes one or both of the closed fists are held up; sometimes the open hand, with all the fingers extended, is used; and sometimes an entirely independent gesture is introduced. These are, in general, of no special importance; but one custom in vogue among some of the prairie tribes of Indians, to which my attention was called by Dr. J. Owen Dorsey,[82] should be mentioned. It is a gesture which signifies multiplication, and is performed by throwing the hand to the left. Thus, after counting 5, a wave of the hand to the left means 50. As multiplication is rather unusual among savage tribes, this is noteworthy, and would seem to indicate on the part of the Indian a higher degree of intelligence than is ordinarily possessed by uncivilized races.  In the numeral scale as we possess it in English, we find it necessary to retain the name of the last unit of each kind used, in order to describe definitely any numeral employed. Thus, fifteen, one hundred forty-two, six thousand seven hundred twenty-seven, give in full detail the numbers they are intended to describe. In primitive scales this is not always considered necessary; thus, the Zamucos express their teens without using their word for 10 at all. They say simply, 1 on the foot, 2 on the foot, etc. Corresponding abbreviations are often met; so often, indeed, that no further mention of them is needed. They mark one extreme, the extreme of brevity, found in the savage method of building up hand, foot, and finger names for numerals; while the Zuñi scale marks the extreme of prolixity in the formation of such words. A somewhat ruder composition than any yet noticed is shown in the numerals of the Vilelo scale,[83] which are:     1.  agit, or yaagit.    2.  uke.    3.  nipetuei.    4.  yepkatalet.    5.  isig-nisle-yaagit    = hand fingers 1.    6.  isig-teet-yaagit     = hand with 1.    7.  isig-teet-uke        = hand with 2.    8.  isig-teet-nipetuei   = hand with 3.    9.  isig-teet-yepkatalet = hand with 4.   10.  isig-uke-nisle = second hand fingers (lit. hand-two-fingers).   11.  isig-uke-nisle-teet-yaagit = second hand fingers with 1.   20.  isig-ape-nisle-lauel = hand foot fingers all.  In the examples thus far given, it will be noticed that the actual names of individual fingers do not appear. In general, such words as thumb, forefinger, little finger, are not found, but rather the hand-1, 1 on the next, or 1 over and above, which we have already seen, are the type forms for which we are to look. Individual finger names do occur, however, as in the scale of the Hudson's Bay Eskimos,[84] where the three following words are used both as numerals and as finger names:     8.  kittukleemoot   = middle finger.    9.  mikkeelukkamoot = fourth finger.   10.  eerkitkoka      = little finger.  Words of similar origin are found in the original Jiviro scale,[85] where the native numerals are:     1.  ala.    2.  catu.    3.  cala.    4.  encatu.    5.  alacötegladu = 1 hand.    6.  intimutu     = thumb (of second hand).    7.  tannituna    = index finger.    8.  tannituna cabiasu = the finger next the index finger.    9.  bitin ötegla cabiasu = hand next to complete.   10.  catögladu    = 2 hands.  As if to emphasize the rarity of this method of forming numerals, the Jiviros afterward discarded the last five of the above scale, replacing them by words borrowed from the Quichuas, or ancient Peruvians. The same process may have been followed by other tribes, and in this way numerals which were originally digital may have disappeared. But we have no evidence that this has ever happened in any extensive manner. We are, rather, impelled to accept the occasional numerals of this class as exceptions to the general rule, until we have at our disposal further evidence of an exact and critical nature, which would cause us to modify this opinion. An elaborate philological study by Dr. J.H. Trumbull[86] of the numerals used by many of the North American Indian tribes reveals the presence in the languages of these tribes of a few, but only a few, finger names which are used without change as numeral expressions also. Sometimes the finger gives a name not its own to the numeral with which it is associated in counting--as in the Chippeway dialect, which has _nawi-nindj_, middle of the hand, and _nisswi_, 3; and the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1645"],["title","Rhymes a la Mode (#0)"],["body","from the 1885 Kegan Paul, Trench & Co. edition by David Price, email ccx074@pglaf.org                            [Picture: Book cover]                        [Picture: Man at harpsichord]                                   RHYMES A LA MODE                                   BY A.

THE FORTUNATE ISLANDS.   A DREAM IN JUNE.      IN twilight of the longest day       I lingered over Lucian,    Till ere the dawn a dreamy way       My spirit found, untrod of man,    Between the green sky and the grey.     Amid the soft dusk suddenly       More light than air I seemed to sail,    Afloat upon the ocean sky,       While through the faint blue, clear and pale,    I saw the mountain clouds go by:       My barque had thought for helm and sail,    And one mist wreath for canopy.     Like torches on a marble floor       Reflected, so the wild stars shone,    Within the abysmal hyaline,       Till the day widened more and more,    And sank to sunset, and was gone,    And then, as burning beacons shine       On summits of a mountain isle,          A light to folk on sea that fare,       So the sky’s beacons for a while          Burned in these islands of the air.     Then from a starry island set       Where one swift tide of wind there flows,    Came scent of lily and violet,       Narcissus, hyacinth, and rose,    Laurel, and myrtle buds, and vine,    So delicate is the air and fine:    And forests of all fragrant trees       Sloped seaward from the central hill,    And ever clamorous were these     With singing of glad birds; and still       Such music came as in the woods    Most lonely, consecrate to Pan,       The Wind makes, in his many moods,    Upon the pipes some shepherd Man,       Hangs up, in thanks for victory!    On these shall mortals play no more,       But the Wind doth touch them, over and o’er,    And the Wind’s breath in the reeds will sigh.     Between the daylight and the dark       That island lies in silver air,    And suddenly my magic barque       Wheeled, and ran in, and grounded there;    And by me stood the sentinel       Of them who in the island dwell;          All smiling did he bind my hands,          With rushes green and rosy bands,    They have no harsher bonds than these       The people of the pleasant lands    Within the wash of the airy seas!     Then was I to their city led:       Now all of ivory and gold    The great walls were that garlanded    The temples in their shining fold,       (Each fane of beryl built, and each       Girt with its grove of shadowy beech,)    And all about the town, and through,    There flowed a River fed with dew,       As sweet as roses, and as clear          As mountain crystals pure and cold,    And with his waves that water kissed    The gleaming altars of amethyst       That smoke with victims all the year,    And sacred are to the Gods of old.     There sat three Judges by the Gate,       And I was led before the Three,    And they but looked on me, and straight       The rosy bonds fell down from me       Who, being innocent, was free;    And I might wander at my will    About that City on the hill,       Among the happy people clad          In purple weeds of woven air    Hued like the webs that Twilight weaves    At shut of languid summer eves       So light their raiment seemed; and glad    Was every face I looked on there!     There was no heavy heat, no cold,       The dwellers there wax never old,          Nor wither with the waning time,    But each man keeps that age he had          When first he won the fairy clime.    The Night falls never from on high,       Nor ever burns the heat of noon.    But such soft light eternally       Shines, as in silver dawns of June    Before the Sun hath climbed the sky!     Within these pleasant streets and wide,       The souls of Heroes go and come,    Even they that fell on either side       Beneath the walls of Ilium;    And sunlike in that shadowy isle    The"]]]
