And through the silver Northern night       The sunset slowly died away,    And herds of strange deer, lily-white,       Stole forth among the branches grey;    About the coming of the light,       They fled like ghosts before the day!     I know not if the forest green       Still girdles round that castle grey;    I know not if the boughs between       The white deer vanish ere the day;    Above my Love the grass is green,       My heart is colder than the clay!    BALLADE OF HIS OWN COUNTRY.      I SCRIBBLED on a fly-book’s leaves       Among the shining salmon-flies;    A song for summer-time that grieves       I scribbled on a fly-book’s leaves.       Between grey sea and golden sheaves,    Beneath the soft wet Morvern skies,    I scribbled on a fly-book’s leaves       Among the shining salmon-flies.                                TO C. H. ARKCOLL     Let them boast of Arabia, oppressed       By the odour of myrrh on the breeze;    In the isles of the East and the West       That are sweet with the cinnamon trees    Let the sandal-wood perfume the seas;       Give the roses to Rhodes and to Crete,    We are more than content, if you please,       With the smell of bog-myrtle and peat!     Though Dan Virgil enjoyed himself best       With the scent of the limes, when the bees    Hummed low ’round the doves in their nest,       While the vintagers lay at their ease,    Had he sung in our northern degrees,       He’d have sought a securer retreat,    He’d have dwelt, where the heart of us flees,       With the smell of bog-myrtle and peat!     Oh, the broom has a chivalrous crest       And the daffodil’s fair on the leas,    And the soul of the Southron might rest,       And be perfectly happy with these;    But _we_, that were nursed on the knees       Of the hills of the North, we would fleet    Where our hearts might their longing appease       With the smell of bog-myrtle and peat!                                     ENVOY.     Ah Constance, the land of our quest       It is far from the sounds of the street,    Where the Kingdom of Galloway’s blest       With the smell of bog-myrtle and peat!    VILLANELLE             (TO M. JOSEPH BOULMIER, AUTHOR OF “LES VILLANELLES.”)     VILLANELLE, why art thou mute?          Hath the singer ceased to sing?    Hath the Master lost his lute?     Many a pipe and scrannel flute          On the breeze their discords fling;    Villanelle, why art _thou_ mute?     Sound of tumult and dispute,          Noise of war the echoes bring;    Hath the Master lost his lute?     Once he sang of bud and shoot          In the season of the Spring;    Villanelle, why art thou mute?     Fading leaf and falling fruit          Say, “The year is on the wing,    Hath the Master lost his lute?”     Ere the axe lie at the root,          Ere the winter come as king,    Villanelle, why art thou mute?    Hath the Master lost his lute?    TRIOLETS AFTER MOSCHUS.       Αίαῖ ταὶ μαλάχαι μέν ἐπὰν κατὰ κᾱπον ὄλωνται     ὕστερον άυ ζώοντι καὶ εἰς ἔτος ἄλλο φύοντι     άμμες δ’ οι μεγάλοι καὶ χαρτερί οι σοφοὶ ἄνδρες     ὁππότε πρᾱτα θάνωμες άνάχοοι ἔν χθονὶ χοίλα     ‘εύδομες ἔυ μάλα μαχρὸν ἀπέμονα νήγρετον ‘ύπνον.     ALAS, for us no second spring,       Like mallows in the garden-bed,    For these the grave has lost his sting,       Alas, for _us_ no second spring,       Who sleep without awakening,    And, dead, for ever more are dead,       Alas, for us no second spring,          Like mallows in the garden-bed!     Alas, the strong, the wise, the brave       That boast themselves the sons of men!    Once they go down into the grave—       Alas, the strong, the wise, the brave,—       They perish and have none to save,       They are sown, and are not raised again;    Alas, the strong, the wise, the brave,       That boast themselves the sons of men!    BALLADE OF CRICKET.                                 TO T. W. LANG.     THE burden of hard hitting: slog away!    Here shalt thou make a “five” and there a “four,”    And then upon thy bat shalt lean, and say,    That thou art in for an uncommon score.    Yea, the loud ring applauding thee shall roar,    And thou to rival THORNTON shalt aspire,    When lo, the Umpire gives thee “leg before,”—    “This is the end of every man’s desire!”     The burden of much bowling, when the stay    Of all thy team is “collared,” swift or slower,    When “bailers” break not in their wonted way,    And “yorkers” come not off as here-to-fore,    When length balls shoot no more, ah never more,    When all deliveries lose their former fire,    When bats seem broader than the broad barn-door,—    “This is the end of every man’s desire!”     The burden of long fielding, when the clay    Clings to thy shoon in sudden shower’s downpour,    And running still thou stumblest, or the ray    Of blazing suns doth bite and burn thee sore,    And blind thee till, forgetful of thy lore,    Thou dost most mournfully misjudge a “skyer,”    And lose a match the Fates cannot restore,—    “This is the end of every man’s desire!”                                     ENVOY.     Alas, yet liefer on Youth’s hither shore    Would I be some poor Player on scant hire,    Than King among the old, who play no more,—    “_This_ is the end of every man’s desire!”    THE LAST MAYING.       “It is told of the last Lovers which watched May-night in the forest,     before men brought the tidings of the Gospel to this land, that they     beheld no Fairies, nor Dwarfs, nor no such Thing, but the very Venus     herself, who bade them ‘make such cheer as they might, for’ said she,     ‘I shall live no more in these Woods, nor shall ye endure to see     another May time.’”—EDMUND GORLIOT, “Of Phantasies and Omens,” p.     149.  (1573.)     “WHENCE do ye come, with the dew on your hair?    From what far land are the boughs ye bear,       The blossoms and buds upon breasts and tresses,    The light burned white in your faces fair?”     “In a falling fane have we built our house,    With the dying Gods we have held carouse,       And our lips are wan from their wild caresses,    Our hands are filled with their holy boughs.     As we crossed the lawn in the dying day    No fairy led us to meet the May,       But the very Goddess loved by lovers,    In mourning raiment of green and grey.     She was not decked as for glee and game,    She was not veiled with the veil of flame,       The saffron veil of the Bride that covers    The face that is flushed with her joy and shame.     On the laden branches the scent and dew    Mingled and met, and as snow to strew       The woodland rides and the fragrant grasses,    White flowers fell as the night wind blew.     Tears and kisses on lips and eyes    Mingled and met amid laughter and sighs       For grief that abides, and joy that passes,    For pain that tarries and mirth that flies.     It chanced as the dawning grew to grey    Pale and sad on our homeward way,       With weary lips, and palled with pleasure    The Goddess met us, farewell to say.     “Ye have made your choice, and the better part,    Ye chose” she said, “and the wiser art;       In the wild May night drank all the measure,    The perfect pleasure of heart and heart.     “Ye shall walk no more with the May,” she said,    “Shall your love endure though the Gods be dead?       Shall the flitting flocks, mine own, my chosen,    Sing as of old, and be happy and wed?     “Yea, they are glad as of old; but you,    Fair and fleet as the dawn or the dew,       Abide no more, for the springs are frozen,    And fled the Gods that ye loved and knew.     Ye shall never know Summer again like this;    Ye shall play no more with the Fauns, I wis,       No more in the nymphs’ and dryads’ playtime    Shall echo and answer kiss and kiss.     “Though the flowers in your golden hair be bright,    Your golden hair shall be waste and white    On faded brows ere another May time       Bring the spring, but no more delight.”    HOMERIC UNITY.      THE sacred keep of Ilion is rent    By shaft and pit; foiled waters wander slow    Through plains where Simois and Scamander went       To war with Gods and heroes long ago.       Not yet to tired Cassandra, lying low    In rich Mycenæ, do the Fates relent:       The bones of Agamemnon are a show,    And ruined is his royal monument.     The dust and awful treasures of the Dead,       Hath Learning scattered wide, but vainly thee,    Homer, she meteth with her tool of lead,       And strives to rend thy songs; too blind to see    The crown that burns on thine immortal head       Of indivisible supremacy!    IN TINTAGEL.                                       LUI.     AH lady, lady, leave the creeping mist,       And leave the iron castle by the sea!                                      ELLE.     Nay, from the sea there came a ghost that kissed       My lips, and so I cannot come to thee!                                      LUI.     Ah lady, leave the cruel landward wind       That crusts the blighted flowers with bitter foam!                                      ELLE.     Nay, for his arms are cold and strong to bind,       And I must dwell with him and make my home!                                      LUI.     Come, for the Spring is fair in Joyous Guard       And down deep alleys sweet birds sing again.                                      ELLE.     But I must tarry with the winter hard,       And with the bitter memory of pain,    Although the Spring be fair in Joyous Guard,       And in the gardens glad birds sing again!    PISIDICÊ.   The incident is from the Love Stories of Parthenius, who preserved fragments of a lost epic on the expedition of Achilles against Lesbos, an island allied with Troy.     THE daughter of the Lesbian king       Within her bower she watched the war,    Far off she heard the arrows ring,    "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1645"],["title","Rhymes a la Mode (#4)"],["body","   The smitten harness ring afar;    And, fighting from the foremost car,       Saw one that smote where all must flee;    More fair than the Immortals are       He seemed to fair Pisidicê!     She saw, she loved him, and her heart       Before Achilles, Peleus’ son,    Threw all its guarded gates apart,       A maiden fortress lightly won!    And, ere that day of fight was done,       No more of land or faith recked she,    But joyed in her new life begun,—       Her life of love, Pisidicê!     She took a gift into her hand,       As one that had a boon to crave;    She stole across the ruined land       Where lay the dead without a grave,    And to Achilles’ hand she gave       Her gift, the secret postern’s key.    “To-morrow let me be thy slave!”       Moaned to her love Pisidicê.     Ere dawn the Argives’ clarion call       Rang down Methymna’s burning street;    They slew the sleeping warriors all,       They drove the women to the fleet,    Save one, that to Achilles’ feet       Clung, but, in sudden wrath, cried he:    “For her no doom but death is meet,”       And there men stoned Pisidicê.     In havens of that haunted coast,       Amid the myrtles of the shore,    The moon sees many a maiden ghost       Love’s outcast now and evermore.    The silence hears the shades deplore       Their hour of dear-bought love; but _thee_    The waves lull, ’neath thine olives hoar,       To dreamless rest, Pisidicê!    FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST.      RETURNING from what other seas       Dost thou renew thy murmuring,    Weak Tide, and hast thou aught of these       To tell, the shores where float and cling    My love, my hope, my memories?     Say does my lady wake to note       The gold light into silver die?    Or do thy waves make lullaby,       While dreams of hers, like angels, float    Through star-sown spaces of the sky?     Ah, would such angels came to me       That dreams of mine might speak with hers,    Nor wake the slumber of the sea    With words as low as winds that be       Awake among the gossamers!    LOVE THE VAMPIRE.                             Ο ΕΡΩΤΑΣ ’Σ ΤΟΝ ΤΑΦΟ.        THE level sands and grey,       Stretch leagues and leagues away,    Down to the border line of sky and foam,       A spark of sunset burns,       The grey tide-water turns,    Back, like a ghost from her forbidden home!        Here, without pyre or bier,       Light Love was buried here,    Alas, his grave was wide and deep enough,       Thrice, with averted head,       We cast dust on the dead,    And left him to his rest.  An end of Love.        “No stone to roll away,       No seal of snow or clay,    Only soft dust above his wearied eyes,       But though the sudden sound       Of Doom should shake the ground,    And graves give up their ghosts, he will not rise!”        So each to each we said!       Ah, but to either bed    Set far apart in lands of North and South,       Love as a Vampire came       With haggard eyes aflame,    And kissed us with the kisses of his mouth!        Thenceforth in dreams must we       Each other’s shadow see    Wand’ring unsatisfied in empty lands,       Still the desirèd face       Fleets from the vain embrace,    And still the shape evades the longing hands.    BALLADE OF THE BOOK-MAN’S PARADISE.      THERE _is_ a Heaven, or here, or there,—    A Heaven there is, for me and you,    Where bargains meet for purses spare,    Like ours, are not so far and few.    Thuanus’ bees go humming through    The learned groves, ’neath rainless skies,    O’er volumes old and volumes new,    Within that Book-man’s Paradise!     There treasures bound for Longepierre    Keep brilliant their morocco blue,    There Hookes’ _Amanda_ is not rare,    Nor early tracts upon Peru!    Racine is common as Rotrou,    No Shakespeare Quarto search defies,    And Caxtons grow as blossoms grew,    Within that Book-man’s Paradise!     There’s Eve,—not our first mother fair,—    But Clovis Eve, a binder true;    Thither does Bauzonnet repair,    Derome, Le Gascon, Padeloup!    But never come the cropping crew    That dock a volume’s honest size,    Nor they that “letter” backs askew,    Within that Book-man’s Paradise!                                     ENVOY.     Friend, do not Heber and De Thou,    And Scott, and Southey, kind and wise,    _La chasse au bouquin_ still pursue    Within that Book-man’s Paradise?    BALLADE OF A FRIAR.   (Clement Marot’s _Frère Lubin_, though translated by Longfellow and others, has not hitherto been rendered into the original measure, of _ballade à double refrain_.)     SOME ten or twenty times a day,    To bustle to the town with speed,    To dabble in what dirt he may,—    Le Frère Lubin’s the man you need!    But any sober life to lead    Upon an exemplary plan,    Requires a Christian indeed,—    Le Frère Lubin is _not_ the man!     Another’s wealth on his to lay,    With all the craft of guile and greed,    To leave you bare of pence or pay,—    Le Frère Lubin’s the man you need!    But watch him with the closest heed,    And dun him with what force you can,—    He’ll not refund, howe’er you plead,—    Le Frère Lubin is _not_ the man!     An honest girl to lead astray,    With subtle saw and promised meed,    Requires no cunning crone and grey,—    Le Frère Lubin’s the man you need!    He preaches an ascetic creed,    But,—try him with the water can—    A dog will drink, whate’er his breed,—    Le Frère Lubin is _not_ the man!                                     ENVOY.     In good to fail, in ill succeed,    Le Frère Lubin’s the man you need!    In honest works to lead the van,    Le Frère Lubin is _not_ the man!    BALLADE OF NEGLECTED MERIT. {78}      I HAVE scribbled in verse and in prose,    I have painted “arrangements in greens,”    And my name is familiar to those    Who take in the high class magazines;    I compose; I’ve invented machines;    I have written an “Essay on Rhyme”;    For my county I played, in my teens,    But—I am not in “Men of the Time!”     I have lived, as a chief, with the Crows;    I have “interviewed” Princes and Queens;    I have climbed the Caucasian snows;    I abstain, like the ancients, from beans,—    I’ve a guess what Pythagoras means,    When he says that to eat them’s a crime,—    I have lectured upon the Essenes,    But—I am not in “Men of the Time!”     I’ve a fancy as morbid as Poe’s,    I can tell what is meant by “Shebeens,”    I have breasted the river that flows    Through the land of the wild Gadarenes;    I can gossip with Burton on _skenes_,    I can imitate Irving (the Mime),    And my sketches are quainter than Keene’s,    But—I am not in “Men of the Time!”                                     ENVOY.     So the tower of mine eminence leans    Like the Pisan, and mud is its lime;    I’m acquainted with Dukes and with Deans,    But—I am not in “Men of the Time!”    BALLADE OF RAILWAY NOVELS.      LET others praise analysis       And revel in a “cultured” style,    And follow the subjective Miss {80}       From Boston to the banks of Nile,    Rejoice in anti-British bile,       And weep for fickle hero’s woe,    These twain have shortened many a mile,       Miss Braddon and Gaboriau.     These damsels of “Democracy’s,”       How long they stop at every stile!    They smile, and we are told, I wis,       Ten subtle reasons _why_ they smile.    Give _me_ your villains deeply vile,       Give me Lecoq, Jottrat, and Co.,    Great artists of the ruse and wile,       Miss Braddon and Gaboriau!     Oh, novel readers, tell me this,       Can prose that’s polished by the file,    Like great Boisgobey’s mysteries,       Wet days and weary ways beguile,    And man to living reconcile,       Like these whose every trick we know?    The agony how high they pile,       Miss Braddon and Gaboriau!                                     ENVOY.     Ah, friend, how many and many a while       They’ve made the slow time fleetly flow,    And solaced pain and charmed exile,       Miss Braddon and Gaboriau.    THE CLOUD CHORUS.                              (FROM ARISTOPHANES.)                               _Socrates speaks_.     Hither, come hither, ye Clouds renowned, and unveil yourselves here;    Come, though ye dwell on the sacred crests of Olympian snow,    Or whether ye dance with the Nereid choir in the gardens clear,    Or whether your golden urns are dipped in Nile’s overflow,    Or whether you dwell by Mæotis mere    Or the snows of Mimas, arise! appear!    And hearken to us, and accept our gifts ere ye rise and go.                               _The Clouds sing_.     Immortal Clouds from the echoing shore    Of the father of streams, from the sounding sea,    Dewy and fleet, let us rise and soar.    Dewy and gleaming, and fleet are we!    Let us look on the tree-clad mountain crest,       On the sacred earth where the fruits rejoice,    On the waters that murmur east and west       On the tumbling sea with his moaning voice,    For unwearied glitters the Eye of the Air,       And the bright rays gleam;    Then cast we our shadows of mist, and fare    In our deathless shapes to glance everywhere       From the height of the heaven, on the land and air,          And the Ocean stream.     Let us on, ye Maidens that bring the Rain,       Let us gaze on Pallas’ citadel,          In the country of Cecrops, fair and dear          The mystic land of the holy cell,       Where the Rites unspoken securely dwell,          And the gifts of the Gods that know not stain    And a people of mortals that know not fear.    For the temples tall, and the statues fair,    And the feasts of the Gods are holiest there,    The feasts of Immortals, the chaplets of flowers       And the Bromian mirth at the coming of spring,    And the musical voices that fill the hours,       And the dancing feet of the Maids that sing!    BALLADE OF LITERARY FAME.                           “All these for Fourpence.”     OH, where are the endless Romances    Our grandmothers used to adore? "]]]
