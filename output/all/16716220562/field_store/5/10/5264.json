Why should the rough-barked Willow for ever lave         Her feet in my cooling wave;             When the tender and beautiful Beech     Faints with midsummer heat in the meadow just out of my reach?     Could I but rush with unchecked power,     The miller might grind a day's corn in an hour.             And what are the ends     Of life, but to serve one's friends?\"      A day did dawn at last,     When the spirits of the storm and the blast,     Breaking the bands of the winter's frost and snow,     Swept from the mountain source of the stream, and flooded the              valley below.            Dams were broken and weirs came down;            Cottage and mill, country and town,            Shared in the general inundation,            And the following desolation.            Then the Mill Stream rose in its might,            And burst out of bounds to left and to right,     Rushed to the beautiful Beech,            In the meadow far out of reach.     But with such torrents the poor tree died,     Torn up by the roots, and laid on its side.            The cattle swam till they sank,            Trying to find a bank.            Never more shall the broken water-wheel            Grind the corn to make the meal,            To make the children's bread.            The miller was dead.                  When the setting sun     Looked to see what the Mill Stream had done              In its hour         Of unlimited power,     And what was left when that had passed by,     Behold the channel was stony and dry.              In uttermost ruin         The Mill Stream had been its own undoing.     Furthermore it had drowned its friend:              This was the end.         [Illustration]      BOY AND SQUIRREL.       Oh boy, down there, I can't believe that what they say is true!     We squirrels surely cannot have an enemy in you;     We have so much in common, my dear friend, it seems to me     That I can really feel for you, and you can feel for me.      Some human beings might not understand the life we lead;     If we asked Dr. Birch to play, no doubt he'd rather read;     He hates all scrambling restlessness, and chattering, scuffling noise;     If he could catch us we should fare no better than you boys.      Fine ladies, too, whose flounces catch and tear on every stump,     What joy have they in jagged pines, who neither skip nor jump?     Miss Mittens never saw my tree-top home--so unlike hers;     What wonder if her only thought of squirrels is of furs?      But you, dear boy, you know so well the bliss of climbing trees,     Of scrambling up and sliding down, and rocking in the breeze,     Of cracking nuts and chewing cones, and keeping cunning hoards,     And all the games and all the sport and fun a wood affords.      It cannot be that you would make a prisoner of me,     Who hate yourself to be cooped up, who love so to be free;     An extra hour indoors, I know, is punishment to you;     _You_ make _me_ twirl a tiny cage? It never can be true!      Yet I've a wary grandfather, whose tail is white as snow.     He thinks he knows a lot of things we young ones do not know;     He says we're safe with Doctor Birch, because he is so blind,     And that Miss Mittens would not hurt a fly, for she is kind.      But you, dear boy, who know my ways, he bids me fly from you,     He says my life and liberty are lost unless I do;     That you, who fear the Doctor's cane, will fling big sticks at me,     And tear me from my forest home, and from my favourite tree.      The more we think of what he says, the more we're sure it's \"chaff,\"     We sit beneath the shadow of our bushy tails and laugh;     Hey, presto! Friend, come up, and let us hide and seek and play,     If you could spring as well as climb, what fun we'd have to-day!         LITTLE MASTER TO HIS BIG DOG.       Oh, how greedy you look as you stare at my plate,       Your mouth waters so, and your big tail is drumming     Flop! flop! flop! on the carpet, and yet if you'll wait,       When we have quite finished, your dinner is coming.      Yes! I know what you mean, though you don't speak a word;       You say that you wish that I kindly would let you     Take your meals with the family, which is absurd,       And on a tall chair like a gentleman set you.      But how little you think, my dear dog, when you talk;       You've no \"table manners,\" you bolt meat, you gobble;     And how could you eat bones with a knife, spoon, and fork?       You would be in a most inconvenient hobble.      And yet, once on a time it is certainly true,       My own manners wanted no little refining;     For I gobbled, and spilled, and was greedy like you,       And had no idea of good manners when dining.      So that when I consider the tricks _you_ have caught,       To sit or shake paws with the utmost good breeding,     I must own it quite possible you may be taught       The use of a plate, and a nice style of feeding.      Therefore try to learn manners, and eat as I do;       Don't glare at the joint, and as soon as you're able     To behave like the rest, you shall feed with us too,       And dine like a gentleman sitting at table.         [Illustration]      A SWEET LITTLE DEAR       I always _was_ a remarkable child; so old for my age, and such a              sensitive nature!--Mamma often says so.     And I'm the sweetest, little dear in my blue ribbons, and quite a              picture in my Pompadour hat!--Mrs. Brown told her so on              Sunday, and that's how I know.     And I'm a sacred responsibility to my parents--(it was what the              clergyman's wife at the seaside said),     And a solemn charge, and a fair white page, and a tender bud, and              a spotless nature of wax to be moulded;--but the rest of              it has gone out of my head.     There was a lot more, and she left two books as well, and I think she              called me a Privilege, and Mamma said \"Yes,\" and began to cry.     And Nurse came in with luncheon on a tray, and put away the books, and              said she was as weak as a kitten, and worried to              fiddlestrings, as any one with common sense could see with              half an eye.     I was hopping round the room, but I stopped and said, \"My kitten's not              weak, and I don't believe anybody could see with only half an              eye. Could they, Mamma?\"     And Nurse said, \"Go and play, my dear, and let your Mamma rest;\"              but Mamma said, \"No, my love, stay where you are.     Dear Nurse, lift me up, and put a pillow to my back, I know              you mean to be kind;     But she does ask such remarkable questions, and while I've strength              to speak, don't let me check the inquiring mind.     If I should fail to be all a mother ought--oh, how my head throbs when              the dear child jumps!\" and then Nurse said, \"Ugh!     When you're worried into your grave, she'll have no mother at all,              and'll have to tumble up as other folks do.     There's the poor master at his wits' end--a child's not all a grown              person has to think of--and Miss Jane would do well enough if              she'd less of her own way;     But there's more children spoilt with care than the want of it, and              more mothers murdered than there's folks hanged for, and              that's what I say.     Children learns what you teach 'em, and Miss Jane's old enough to have              learned to wait upon you:     And if her mother thought less of her and she thought more of her              mother, it would be better for her too.\"     But Nurse is a nasty cross old thing--I hate her; and I hate the              doctor, for he wanted me to be left behind     When Mamma went to the sea for her health; but I begged and begged              till she promised I should go, for Mamma is always kind.     And she bought me a new wooden spade and a basket, and a red and green              ship with three masts, and a one-and-sixpenny telescope to              look at the sea;     But when I got on to the sands, I thought I'd rather be on the              esplanade, for there was a little girl there who was              looking at me,     Dressed in a navy-blue suit and a sailor hat, with fair hair tied              with ribbons; so I told Mamma,     And she got me a suit, ready-made (but she said it was dreadfully              dear), and a hat to match, in the Pebble Brooch Repository              and Universal Bazaar.     It faded in the sun, and came all to pieces in the wash; but I was              tired of it before.     For the esplanade is very dull, and the little girl with fair hair had              got sand-boots and a shrimping-net and was playing on              the shore.     And when my sand-boots came home, and I'd got a better net than hers,              she went donkey-riding, and I knew it was to tease me,     But Nurse was so cross, and said if they sent a man in a herring-boat              to the moon for what I wanted that nothing would please me.     So I said the seaside was a very disagreeable place, and I wished I              hadn't come,     And I told Mamma so, and begged her to try and get well soon, to take              us all home.     But now we've got home, it's very hot, and I'm afraid of the wasps;              and I'm sure it was cooler at the sea,     And the Smiths won't be back for a fortnight, so I can't even have              Matilda to tea.     I don't care much for my new doll--I think I'm too old for dolls now;              I like books better, though I didn't like the last,     And I've read all I have: I always skip the dull parts, and when you              skip a good deal you get through them so fast.     I like toys if"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16686"],["title","Verses for Children, and Songs for Music (#7)"],["body","y're the best kind, with works; though when I've had              one good game with them, I don't much care to play with              them again.     I feel as if I wanted something new to amuse me, and Mamma says it's              because I've got such an active brain.     Nurse says I don't know what I want, and I know I don't, and that's              just what it is.     It seems so sad a young creature like me should feel unhappy, and not              know what's amiss;     But Nurse never thinks of my feelings, any more than the cruel nurse              in the story about the little girl who was so good,     And if I die early as she did, perhaps then people will be sorry I've              been misunderstood.     I shouldn't like to die early, but I should like people to be sorry              for me, and to praise me when I was dead:     If I could only come to life again when they had missed me very much,              and I'd heard what they said--     Of course that's impossible, I know, but I wish I knew what to              do instead!     It seems such a pity that a sweet little dear like me should              ever be sad.     And Mamma says she buys everything I want, and has taught me              everything I will learn, and reads every book, and takes              every hint she can pick up, and keeps me with her all day,              and worries about me all night, till she's nearly mad;     And if any kind person can think of any better way to make me happy              we shall both of us be glad.         BLUE AND RED:     OR, THE DISCONTENTED LOBSTER.       Permit me, Reader, to make my bow,             And allow     Me to humbly commend to your tender mercies     The hero of these simple verses.     By domicile, of the British Nation;     By birth and family, a Crustacean.     One's hero should have a name that rare is;     And his was _Homarus_, but--_Vulgaris!_     A Lobster, who dwelt with several others,--         His sisters and brothers,--     In a secluded but happy home,     Under the salt sea's foam.             It lay     At the outermost point of a rocky bay.     A sandy, tide-pooly, cliff-bound cove,     With a red-roofed fishing village above,     Of irregular cottages, perched up high     Amid pale yellow poppies next to the sky.     Shells and pebbles, and wrack below,     And shrimpers shrimping all in a row;     Tawny sails and tarry boats,     Dark brown nets and old cork floats;     Nasty smells at the nicest spots,     And blue-jerseyed sailors and--lobster-pots.                \"It is sweet to be     At home in the deep, deep sea.     It is very pleasant to have the power     To take the air on dry land for an hour;     And when the mid-day midsummer sun     Is toasting the fields as brown as a bun,     And the sands are baking, it's very nice     To feel as cool as a strawberry ice     In one's own particular damp sea-cave,     Dipping one's feelers in each green wave.     It is good, for a very rapacious maw,     When storm-tossed morsels come to the claw;     And 'the better to see with' down below,     To wash one's eyes in the ebb and flow     Of the tides that come and the tides that go.\"     So sang the Lobsters, thankful for their mercies,     All but the hero of these simple verses.               Now a hero--       If he's worth the grand old name--     Though temperature may change from boiling-point to zero       Should keep his temper all the same:     Courageous and content in his estate,     And proof against the spiteful blows of Fate.     It, therefore, troubles me to have to say,       That with this Lobster it was never so;     Whate'er the weather or the sort of day,       No matter if the tide were high or low,     Whatever happened he was never pleased,     And not himself alone, but all his kindred teased.              \"Oh! oh!           What a world of woe     We flounder about in, here below!             Oh dear! oh dear!         It is too, too dull, down here!       I haven't the slightest patience       With any of my relations;       I take no interest whatever       In things they call curious and clever.       And, for love of dear truth I state it,       As for my Home--I hate it!     I'm convinced I was formed for a larger sphere,     And am utterly out of my element here.\"     Then his brothers and sisters said,     Each solemnly shaking his and her head,     \"You put your complaints in most beautiful verse,           And yet we are sure,     That, in spite of all you have to endure,     You might go much farther and fare much worse.     We wish you could live in a higher sphere,     But we think you might live happily here.\"     \"I don't live, I only exist,\" he said,     \"Be pleased to look upon me as dead.\"     And he swam to his cave, and took to his bed.     He sulked so long that the sisters cried,     \"Perhaps he has really and truly died.\"     But the brothers went to the cave to peep,     For they said, \"Perhaps he is only asleep.\"     They found him, far too busy to talk,     With a very large piece of bad salt pork.     \"Dear Brother, what luck you have had to-day!     Can you tell us, pray,     Is there any more pork afloat in the bay?\"     But not a word would my hero say,     Except to repeat, with sad persistence,     \"This is not life, it's only existence.\"      One day there came to the fishing village     An individual bent on pillage;     But a robber whom true scientific feeling     May find guilty of picking, but not of stealing.       He picked the yellow poppies on the cliffs;       He picked the feathery seaweeds in the pools;       He picked the odds and ends from nets and skiffs;       He picked the brains of all the country fools.     He dried the poppies for his own herbarium,     And caught the Lobsters for a seaside town aquarium.        \"Tank No. 20\" is deep,       \"Tank No. 20\" is cool,       For clever contrivances always keep         The water fresh in the pool;     And a very fine plate-glass window is free to the public view,     Through which you can stare at the passers-by and the passers-by              stare at you.     Said my hero, \"This is a great variety     From those dull old rocks, where we'd no society.\"      For the primal cause of incidents,       One often hunts about,     When it's only a coincidence       That matters so turned out.     And I do not know the reason       Or the reason I would tell--     But it may have been the season--       Why my hero chose this moment for casting off his shell.       He had hitherto been dressed[1]       (And so had all the rest)     In purplish navy blue from top to toe!       But now his coat was new,       It was of every shade of blue     Between azure and the deepest indigo;     And his sisters kept telling him, till they were tired,     There never was any one so much admired.      My hero was happy at last, you will say?     So he was, dear Reader--two nights and a day;     Then, as he and his relatives lay,     Each at the mouth of his mock     Cave in the face of a miniature rock,     They saw, descending the opposite cliff,     By jerks spasmodic of elbows stiff;     Now hurriedly slipping, now seeming calmer,     With the ease and the grace of a hog in armour,     And as solemn as any ancient palmer,               No less than nine               Exceedingly fine     And full-grown lobsters, all in a line.     But the worst of the matter remains to be said.     These nine big lobsters were all of them _red_.[2]     And when they got safe to the floor of the tank,--     For which they had chiefly good luck to thank,--     They settled their cumbersome coats of mail,     And every lobster tucked his tail     Neatly under him as he sat     In a circle of nine for a cosy chat.     They seemed to be sitting hand in hand,     As shoulder to shoulder they sat in the sand,     And waved their antennæ in calm rotation,     Apparently holding a consultation.     But what were the feelings of Master Blue Shell?     Oh, gentle Reader! how shall I tell?      [Footnote 1: The colours of lobsters vary a good deal in various     localities. _Homarus vulgaris_, the common lobster, is spotted, and, on     the upper part, more or less of a bluish black. I once saw a lobster     that had just got a new shell, and was of every lovely shade of blue     and violet.]      [Footnote 2: _Palurinus vulgaris_, the spiny lobster, has no true     claws, but huge hairy antennæ. These lobsters are red _during their     lifetime_! I have seen them (in the Crystal Palace Aquarium) seated     exactly as here described, with blue lobsters watching them from     niches of the rocky sides of the tank, where they looked like     blue-jerseyed smugglers at the mouths of caves.]      From the moment that those Nine he saw,     He never could bear his blue coat more.     \"Oh, Brothers in misfortune!\" he said,     \"Did you ever see any lobsters so grand,     As those who sit down there in the sand?     Why were we born at all, since not one of us all was born red?\"     \"Dear Brother, indeed, this is quite a whim.\"     (So his brothers and sisters reasoned with him;     And, being exceedingly cultivated,     The case with remarkable fairness stated.)     \"Red is a primary colour, it's true,             But so is Blue;     And we all of us think, dear Brother,     That one is quite as good as the other.     A swaggering soldier's a saucy varlet,     Though he looks uncommonly well in scarlet.     No doubt there's much to be said     For a field of poppies of glowing red;     For fiery rifts in sunset skies,     Roses and blushes and red sunrise;     For a glow on the Alps, and the glow of a forge,     A foxglove bank in a woodland gorge;     Sparks that are struck from red-hot bars,     The sun in a mist, and the red star Mars;     Flowers of countless shades and shapes,     Matadors', judges', and gipsies' capes;     The red-haired king who was killed in the wood,     Robin"]]]
