In a word,\" he cried, fixing his shining eyes upon the face of his perplexed assistant, \"that God's messengers in the far-off ages should have given to His creatures some full statement of the secret of the world, of the secret of the soul, of the meaning of life and death--the explanation of our being here, and to what great end we are destined in the ultimate fullness of things?\"  Dr. Laidlaw sat speechless. These outbursts of mystical enthusiasm he had witnessed before. With any other man he would not have listened to a single sentence, but to Professor Ebor, man of knowledge and profound investigator, he listened with respect, because he regarded this condition as temporary and pathological, and in some sense a reaction from the intense strain of the prolonged mental concentration of many days.  He smiled, with something between sympathy and resignation as he met the other's rapt gaze.  \"But you have said, sir, at other times, that you consider the ultimate secrets to be screened from all possible--\"  \"The _ultimate_ secrets, yes,\" came the unperturbed reply; \"but that there lies buried somewhere an indestructible record of the secret meaning of life, originally known to men in the days of their pristine innocence, I am convinced. And, by this strange vision so often vouchsafed to me, I am equally sure that one day it shall be given to me to announce to a weary world this glorious and terrific message.\"  And he continued at great length and in glowing language to describe the species of vivid dream that had come to him at intervals since earliest childhood, showing in detail how he discovered these very Tablets of the Gods, and proclaimed their splendid contents--whose precise nature was always, however, withheld from him in the vision--to a patient and suffering humanity.  \"The _Scrutator_, sir, well described 'Pilgrim' as the Apostle of Hope,\" said the young doctor gently, when he had finished; \"and now, if that reviewer could hear you speak and realize from what strange depths comes your simple faith--\"  The professor held up his hand, and the smile of a little child broke over his face like sunshine in the morning.  \"Half the good my books do would be instantly destroyed,\" he said sadly; \"they would say that I wrote with my tongue in my cheek. But wait,\" he added significantly; \"wait till I find these Tablets of the Gods! Wait till I hold the solutions of the old world-problems in my hands! Wait till the light of this new revelation breaks upon confused humanity, and it wakes to find its bravest hopes justified! Ah, then, my dear Laidlaw--\"  He broke off suddenly; but the doctor, cleverly guessing the thought in his mind, caught him up immediately.  \"Perhaps this very summer,\" he said, trying hard to make the suggestion keep pace with honesty; \"in your explorations in Assyria--your digging in the remote civilization of what was once Chaldea, you may find--what you dream of--\"  The professor held up his hand, and the smile of a fine old face.  \"Perhaps,\" he murmured softly, \"perhaps!\"  And the young doctor, thanking the gods of science that his leader's aberrations were of so harmless a character, went home strong in the certitude of his knowledge of externals, proud that he was able to refer his visions to self-suggestion, and wondering complaisantly whether in his old age he might not after all suffer himself from visitations of the very kind that afflicted his respected chief.  And as he got into bed and thought again of his master's rugged face, and finely shaped head, and the deep lines traced by years of work and self-discipline, he turned over on his pillow and fell asleep with a sigh that was half of wonder, half of regret.     2   It was in February, nine months later, when Dr. Laidlaw made his way to Charing Cross to meet his chief after his long absence of travel and exploration. The vision about the so-called Tablets of the Gods had meanwhile passed almost entirely from his memory.  There were few people in the train, for the stream of traffic was now running the other way, and he had no difficulty in finding the man he had come to meet. The shock of white hair beneath the low-crowned felt hat was alone enough to distinguish him by easily.  \"Here I am at last!\" exclaimed the professor, somewhat wearily, clasping his friend's hand as he listened to the young doctor's warm greetings and questions. \"Here I am--a little older, and _much_ dirtier than when you last saw me!\" He glanced down laughingly at his travel-stained garments.  \"And _much_ wiser,\" said Laidlaw, with a smile, as he bustled about the platform for porters and gave his chief the latest scientific news.  At last they came down to practical considerations.  \"And your luggage--where is that? You must have tons of it, I suppose?\" said Laidlaw.  \"Hardly anything,\" Professor Ebor answered. \"Nothing, in fact, but what you see.\"  \"Nothing but this hand-bag?\" laughed the other, thinking he was joking.  \"And a small portmanteau in the van,\" was the quiet reply. \"I have no other luggage.\"  \"You have no other luggage?\" repeated Laidlaw, turning sharply to see if he were in earnest.  \"Why should I need more?\" the professor added simply.  Something in the man's face, or voice, or manner--the doctor hardly knew which--suddenly struck him as strange. There was a change in him, a change so profound--so little on the surface, that is--that at first he had not become aware of it. For a moment it was as though an utterly alien personality stood before him in that noisy, bustling throng. Here, in all the homely, friendly turmoil of a Charing Cross crowd, a curious feeling of cold passed over his heart, touching his life with icy finger, so that he actually trembled and felt afraid.  He looked up quickly at his friend, his mind working with startled and unwelcome thoughts.  \"Only this?\" he repeated, indicating the bag. \"But where's all the stuff you went away with? And--have you brought nothing home--no treasures?\"  \"This is all I have,\" the other said briefly. The pale smile that went with the words caused the doctor a second indescribable sensation of uneasiness. Something was very wrong, something was very queer; he wondered now that he had not noticed it sooner.  \"The rest follows, of course, by slow freight,\" he added tactfully, and as naturally as possible. \"But come, sir, you must be tired and in want of food after your long journey. I'll get a taxi at once, and we can see about the other luggage afterwards.\"  It seemed to him he hardly knew quite what he was saying; the change in his friend had come upon him so suddenly and now grew upon him more and more distressingly. Yet he could not make out exactly in what it consisted. A terrible suspicion began to take shape in his mind, troubling him dreadfully.  \"I am neither very tired, nor in need of food, thank you,\" the professor said quietly. \"And this is all I have. There is no luggage to follow. I have brought home nothing--nothing but what you see.\"  His words conveyed finality. They got into a taxi, tipped the porter, who had been staring in amazement at the venerable figure of the scientist, and were conveyed slowly and noisily to the house in the north of London where the laboratory was, the scene of their labours of years.  And the whole way Professor Ebor uttered no word, nor did Dr. Laidlaw find the courage to ask a single question.  It was only late that night, before he took his departure, as the two men were standing before the fire in the study--that study where they had discussed so many problems of vital and absorbing interest--that Dr. Laidlaw at last found strength to come to the point with direct questions. The professor had been giving him a superficial and desultory account of his travels, of his journeys by camel, of his encampments among the mountains and in the desert, and of his explorations among the buried temples, and, deeper, into the waste of the pre-historic sands, when suddenly the doctor came to the desired point with a kind of nervous rush, almost like a frightened boy.  \"And you found--\" he began stammering, looking hard at the other's dreadfully altered face, from which every line of hope and cheerfulness seemed to have been obliterated as a sponge wipes markings from a slate--\"you found--\"  \"I found,\" replied the other, in a solemn voice, and it was the voice of the mystic rather than the man of science--\"I found what I went to seek. The vision never once failed me. It led me straight to the place like a star in the heavens. I found--the Tablets of the Gods.\"  Dr. Laidlaw caught his breath, and steadied himself on the back of a chair. The words fell like particles of ice upon his heart. For the first time the professor had uttered the well-known phrase without the glow of light and wonder in his face that always accompanied it.  \"You have--brought them?\" he faltered.  \"I have brought them home,\" said the other, in a voice with a ring like iron; \"and I have--deciphered them.\"  Profound despair, the bloom of outer darkness, the dead sound of a hopeless soul freezing in the utter cold of space seemed to fill in the pauses between the brief sentences. A silence followed, during which Dr. Laidlaw saw nothing but the white face before him alternately"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16726"],["title","Four Weird Tales (#7)"],["body","and return. And it was like the face of a dead man.  \"They are, alas, indestructible,\" he heard the voice continue, with its even, metallic ring.  \"Indestructible,\" Laidlaw repeated mechanically, hardly knowing what he was saying.  Again a silence of several minutes passed, during which, with a creeping cold about his heart, he stood and stared into the eyes of the man he had known and loved so long--aye, and worshipped, too; the man who had first opened his own eyes when they were blind, and had led him to the gates of knowledge, and no little distance along the difficult path beyond; the man who, in another direction, had passed on the strength of his faith into the hearts of thousands by his books.  \"I may see them?\" he asked at last, in a low voice he hardly recognized as his own. \"You will let me know--their message?\"  Professor Ebor kept his eyes fixedly upon his assistant's face as he answered, with a smile that was more like the grin of death than a living human smile.  \"When I am gone,\" he whispered; \"when I have passed away. Then you shall find them and read the translation I have made. And then, too, in your turn, you must try, with the latest resources of science at your disposal to aid you, to compass their utter destruction.\" He paused a moment, and his face grew pale as the face of a corpse. \"Until that time,\" he added presently, without looking up, \"I must ask you not to refer to the subject again--and to keep my confidence meanwhile--_ab--so--lute--ly_.\"     3   A year passed slowly by, and at the end of it Dr. Laidlaw had found it necessary to sever his working connexion with his friend and one-time leader. Professor Ebor was no longer the same man. The light had gone out of his life; the laboratory was closed; he no longer put pen to paper or applied his mind to a single problem. In the short space of a few months he had passed from a hale and hearty man of late middle life to the condition of old age--a man collapsed and on the edge of dissolution. Death, it was plain, lay waiting for him in the shadows of any day--and he knew it.  To describe faithfully the nature of this profound alteration in his character and temperament is not easy, but Dr. Laidlaw summed it up to himself in three words: _Loss of Hope_. The splendid mental powers remained indeed undimmed, but the incentive to use them--to use them for the help of others--had gone. The character still held to its fine and unselfish habits of years, but the far goal to which they had been the leading strings had faded away. The desire for knowledge--knowledge for its own sake--had died, and the passionate hope which hitherto had animated with tireless energy the heart and brain of this splendidly equipped intellect had suffered total eclipse. The central fires had gone out. Nothing was worth doing, thinking, working for. There _was_ nothing to work for any longer!  The professor's first step was to recall as many of his books as possible; his second to close his laboratory and stop all research. He gave no explanation, he invited no questions. His whole personality crumbled away, so to speak, till his daily life became a mere mechanical process of clothing the body, feeding the body, keeping it in good health so as to avoid physical discomfort, and, above all, doing nothing that could interfere with sleep. The professor did everything he could to lengthen the hours of sleep, and therefore of forgetfulness.  It was all clear enough to Dr. Laidlaw. A weaker man, he knew, would have sought to lose himself in one form or another of sensual indulgence--sleeping-draughts, drink, the first pleasures that came to hand. Self-destruction would have been the method of a little bolder type; and deliberate evil-doing, poisoning with his awful knowledge all he could, the means of still another kind of man. Mark Ebor was none of these. He held himself under fine control, facing silently and without complaint the terrible facts he honestly believed himself to have been unfortunate enough to discover. Even to his intimate friend and assistant, Dr. Laidlaw, he vouchsafed no word of true explanation or lament. He went straight forward to the end, knowing well that the end was not very far away.  And death came very quietly one day to him, as he was sitting in the arm-chair of the study, directly facing the doors of the laboratory--the doors that no longer opened. Dr. Laidlaw, by happy chance, was with him at the time, and just able to reach his side in response to the sudden painful efforts for breath; just in time, too, to catch the murmured words that fell from the pallid lips like a message from the other side of the grave.  \"Read them, if you must; and, if you can--destroy. But\"--his voice sank so low that Dr. Laidlaw only just caught the dying syllables--\"but--never, never--give them to the world.\"  And like a grey bundle of dust loosely gathered up in an old garment the professor sank back into his chair and expired.  But this was only the death of the body. His spirit had died two years before.     4   The estate of the dead man was small and uncomplicated, and Dr. Laidlaw, as sole executor and residuary legatee, had no difficulty in settling it up. A month after the funeral he was sitting alone in his upstairs library, the last sad duties completed, and his mind full of poignant memories and regrets for the loss of a friend he had revered and loved, and to whom his debt was so incalculably great. The last two years, indeed, had been for him terrible. To watch the swift decay of the greatest combination of heart and brain he had ever known, and to realize he was powerless to help, was a source of profound grief to him that would remain to the end of his days.  At the same time an insatiable curiosity possessed him. The study of dementia was, of course, outside his special province as a specialist, but he knew enough of it to understand how small a matter might be the actual cause of how great an illusion, and he had been devoured from the very beginning by a ceaseless and increasing anxiety to know what the professor had found in the sands of \"Chaldea,\" what these precious Tablets of the Gods might be, and particularly--for this was the real cause that had sapped the man's sanity and hope--what the inscription was that he had believed to have deciphered thereon.  The curious feature of it all to his own mind was, that whereas his friend had dreamed of finding a message of glorious hope and comfort, he had apparently found (so far as he had found anything intelligible at all, and not invented the whole thing in his dementia) that the secret of the world, and the meaning of life and death, was of so terrible a nature that it robbed the heart of courage and the soul of hope. What, then, could be the contents of the little brown parcel the professor had bequeathed to him with his pregnant dying sentences?  Actually his hand was trembling as he turned to the writing-table and began slowly to unfasten a small old-fashioned desk on which the small gilt initials \"M.E.\" stood forth as a melancholy memento. He put the key into the lock and half turned it. Then, suddenly, he stopped and looked about him. Was that a sound at the back of the room? It was just as though someone had laughed and then tried to smother the laugh with a cough. A slight shiver ran over him as he stood listening.  \"This is absurd,\" he said aloud; \"too absurd for belief--that I should be so nervous! It's the effect of curiosity unduly prolonged.\" He smiled a little sadly and his eyes wandered to the blue summer sky and the plane trees swaying in the wind below his window. \"It's the reaction,\" he continued. \"The curiosity of two years to be quenched in a single moment! The nervous tension, of course, must be considerable.\"  He turned back to the brown desk and opened it without further delay. His hand was firm now, and he took out the paper parcel that lay inside without a tremor. It was heavy. A moment later there lay on the table before him a couple of weather-worn plaques of grey stone--they looked like stone, although they felt like metal--on which he saw markings of a curious character that might have been the mere tracings of natural forces through the ages, or, equally well, the half-obliterated hieroglyphics cut upon their surface in past centuries by the more or less untutored hand of a common scribe.  He lifted each stone in turn and examined it carefully. It seemed to him that a faint glow of heat passed from the substance into his skin, and he put them down again suddenly, as with a gesture of uneasiness.  \"A very clever, or a very imaginative man,\" he said to himself, \"who could squeeze the secrets of life and death from such broken lines as those!\"  Then he turned to a yellow envelope lying beside them in the desk, with the single word on the outside in the writing of the professor--the word _Translation_.  \"Now,\" he thought, taking it up with a sudden violence to conceal his nervousness, \"now for the great solution. Now to learn the meaning of the worlds, and why mankind was made, and why discipline is worth while, and sacrifice and pain the true law of advancement.\"  There was the shadow of a sneer in his voice, and yet something in him shivered at the same time. He held the envelope as though weighing it in his hand, his mind pondering many things. Then curiosity won the day, and he suddenly tore it open with the gesture of an actor who tears open a letter on the stage, knowing there is no real writing inside at all.  A page of finely written script in the late scientist's handwriting lay before him. He read it through from beginning to end, missing no word, uttering each syllable distinctly under his breath as he read.  The pallor of his face grew ghastly as he neared the end. He began to shake all over as with ague. His breath came heavily in gasps. He still gripped the sheet of paper, however, and deliberately, as by an intense effort of will, read it through a"]]]
