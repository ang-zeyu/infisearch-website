AT fierce Sidero’s word the thralls drew near,       And shore the locks of Tyro,—like ripe corn       They fell in golden harvest,—but forlorn    The maiden shuddered in her pain and fear,       Like some wild mare that cruel grooms in scorn    Hunt in the meadows, and her mane they sheer,    And drive her where, within the waters clear,       She spies her shadow, and her shame doth mourn.     Ah! hard were he and pitiless of heart       Who marking that wild thing made weak and tame,          Broken, and grieving for her glory gone,    Could mock her grief; but scornfully apart       Sidero stood, and watched a wind that came    And tossed the curls like fire that flew and shone!    TO ARTEMIS.                         (_Hippol._, _Eurip._, 73–87.)     FOR thee soft crowns in thine untrampled mead       I wove, my lady, and to thee I bear;    Thither no shepherd drives his flocks to feed,       Nor scythe of steel has ever laboured there;       Nay, through the spring among the blossoms fair    The brown bee comes and goes, and with good heed    Thy maiden, Reverence, sweet streams doth lead       About the grassy close that is her care!     Souls only that are gracious and serene       By gift of God, in human lore unread,    May pluck these holy blooms and grasses green       That now I wreathe for thine immortal head,    I that may walk with thee, thyself unseen,       And by thy whispered voice am comforted.    CRITICISM OF LIFE.                        (_Hippol._, _Eurip._, 252–266.)     LONG life hath taught me many things, and shown       That lukewarm loves for men who die are best,       Weak wine of liking let them mix alone,    Not Love, that stings the soul within the breast;    Happy, who wears his love-bonds lightliest,       Now cherished, now away at random thrown!       Grievous it is for other’s grief to moan,    Hard that my soul for thine should lose her rest!     Wise ruling this of life: but yet again       Perchance too rigid diet is not well;    He lives not best who dreads the coming pain       And shunneth each delight desirable:    _Flee thou extremes_, this word alone is plain,       Of all that God hath given to Man to spell!    AMARYLLIS.                         (_Theocritus_, _Idyll_, iii.)     FAIR Amaryllis, wilt thou never peep       From forth the cave, and call me, and be mine?    Lo, apples ten I bear thee from the steep,       These didst thou long for, and all these are thine.    Ah, would I were a honey-bee to sweep       Through ivy, and the bracken, and woodbine;    To watch thee waken, Love, and watch thee sleep,       Within thy grot below the shadowy pine.    Now know I Love, a cruel god is he,       The wild beast bare him in the wild wood drear;    And truly to the bone he burneth me.       But, black-browed Amaryllis, ne’er a tear,    Nor sigh, nor blush, nor aught have I from thee;       Nay, nor a kiss, a little gift and dear.    THE CANNIBAL ZEUS.                                    A.D. 160      Καὶ ἔθυσε τὸ βρέφος, καὶ ἔσπεισεν ἐπὶ τοῦ βωμοῦ τὸ ‘αῖμχ—έπὶ τούτου     βωμοῦ τῷ Δὺ θύουσιν ἐν ἀποῤῥήτῳ.—_Paus._ viii. 38     NONE elder city doth the Sun behold       Than ancient Lycosura; ’twas begun       Ere Zeus the meat of mortals learned to shun,    And here hath he a grove whose haunted fold    The driven deer seek and huntsmen dread: ’tis told       That whoso fares within that forest dun       Thenceforth shall cast no shadow in the Sun,    Ay, and within the year his life is cold!     Hard by dwelt he {130} who, while the Gods deigned eat    At good men’s tables, gave them dreadful meat,       A child he slew:—his mountain altar green    Here still hath Zeus, with rites untold of me,    Piteous, but as they are let these things be,       And as from the beginning they have been!    INVOCATION OF ISIS.                         (_Apuleius_, _Metamorph. XI_.)     THOU that art sandalled on immortal feet       With leaves of palm, the prize of Victory;    Thou that art crowned with snakes and blossoms sweet,       Queen of the silver dews and shadowy sky,       I pray thee by all names men name thee by!    Demeter, come, and leave the yellow wheat!       Or Aphrodite, let thy lovers sigh!    Or Dian, from thine Asian temple fleet!     Or, yet more dread, divine Persephone       From worlds of wailing spectres, ah, draw near;    Approach, Selene, from thy subject sea;       Come, Artemis, and this night spare the deer:    By all thy names and rites I summon thee;       By all thy rites and names, Our Lady, hear!    THE COMING OF ISIS.      SO Lucius prayed, and sudden, from afar,       Floated the locks of Isis, shone the bright    Crown that is tressed with berry, snake, and star;       She came in deep blue raiment of the night,    Above her robes that now were snowy white,    Now golden as the moons of harvest are,    Now red, now flecked with many a cloudy bay,       Now stained with all the lustre of the light.     Then he who saw her knew her, and he knew       The awful symbols borne in either hand;    The golden urn that laves Demeter’s dew,       The handles wreathed with asps, the mystic wand;    The shaken seistron’s music, tinkling through       The temples of that old Osirian land.     _THE SPINET_.      _MY heart an old Spinet with strings_       _To laughter chiefly turned_, _but some_       _That Fate has practised hard on_, _dumb_,    _They answer not whoever sings_.    _The ghosts of half-forgotten things_       _Will touch the keys with fingers numb_,       _The little mocking spirits come_    _And thrill it with their fairy wings_.     _A jingling harmony it makes_       _My heart_, _my lyre_, _my old Spinet_,    _And now a memory it wakes_,       _And now the music means_ “_forget_,”    _And little heed the player takes_       _Howe’er the thoughtful critic fret_.     NOTES.   Page 3.  _The Fortunate Islands_.  This piece is a rhymed loose version of a passage in the _Vera Historia_ of Lucian.  The humorist was unable to resist the temptation to introduce passages of mockery, which are here omitted.  Part of his description of the Isles of the Blest has a close and singular resemblance to the New Jerusalem of the Apocalypse.  The clear River of Life and the prodigality of gold and of precious stones may especially be noticed.  _Whoso doth taste the Dead Men’s bread_, &.c.  This belief that the living may visit, on occasion, the dwellings of the dead, but can never return to earth if they taste the food of the departed, is expressed in myths of worldwide distribution.  Because she ate the pomegranate seed, Persephone became subject to the spell of Hades.  In Apuleius, Psyche, when she visits the place of souls, is advised to abstain from food. Kohl found the myth among the Ojibbeways, Mr. Codrington among the Solomon Islanders; it occurs in Samoa, in the Finnish Kalewala (where Wainamoinen, in Pohjola, refrains from touching meat or drink), and the belief has left its mark on the mediæval ballad of Thomas of Ercildoune. When he is in Fairy Land, the Fairy Queen supplies him with the bread and wine of earth, and will not suffer him to touch the fruits which grow “in this countrie.”  See also “Wandering Willie” in Redgauntlet.  Page 20.  _As now the hutted Eskimo_.  The Eskimo and the miserable Fuegians are almost the only Socialists who practise what European Anarchists preach.  The Fuegians go so far as to tear up any piece of cloth which one of the tribe may receive, so that each member may have a rag.  The Eskimo are scarcely such consistent walkers, and canoes show a tendency to accumulate in the hands of proprietors.  Formerly no Eskimo was allowed to possess more than one canoe.  Such was the wild justice of the Polar philosophers.  Page 36.  _The latest minstrel_.  “The sound of all others dearest to his ear, the gentle ripple of Tweed over its pebbles, was distinctly audible as we knelt around the bed and his eldest son kissed and closed his eyes.”—Lockhart’s Life of Scott, vii., 394.  Page 45.  _Ronsard’s Grave_.  This version ventures to condense the original which, like most of the works of the Pleiad, is unnecessarily long.  Page 46.  _The snow_, _and wind_, _and hail_.  Ronsard’s rendering of the famous passage in Odyssey, vi., about the dwellings of the Olympians. The vision of a Paradise of learned lovers and poets constantly recurs in the poetry of Joachim du Bellay, and of Ronsard.  Page 50.  _Romance_.  Suggested by a passage in La Faustin, by M. E. de Goncourt, a curious moment of poetry in a repulsive piece of _naturalisme_.  Page 55.  _M. Boulmier_, author of _Les Villanelles_, died shortly after this villanelle was written; he had not published a larger collection on which he had been at work.  Page 61.  _Edmund Gorliot_.  The bibliophile will not easily procure Gorliot’s book, which is not in the catalogues.  Throughout _The Last Maying_ there is reference to the _Pervigilium Veneris_.  Page 105.  _Bird-Gods_.  Apparently Aristophanes preserved, in a burlesque form, the remnants of a genuine myth.  Almost all savage religions have their bird-gods, and it is probable that Aristophanes did not invent, but only used a surviving myth of which there are scarcely any other traces in Greek literature.  Page 134.  _Spinet_.  The accent is on the last foot, even when the word is written _spinnet_.  Compare the remarkable Liberty which Pamela took with the 137th Psalm.     _My Joys and Hopes all overthrown_,    _My Heartstrings almost broke_,    _Unfit my Mind for Melody_,    _Much more to bear a Joke_.    _But yet_, _if from my Innocence_    _I_, _even in Thought_, _should slide_,    _Then_, _let my fingers quite forget_    _The sweet Spinnet to guide_!                                    _Pamela_, _or Virtue Rewarded_, vol. i.,                                                             p. 184., 1785.
