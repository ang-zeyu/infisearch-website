He reported back 'All      right.' On the return of the rope I took my position on the stick      and was soon dangling in mid air. The sensation was strange and      exhilarating. Looking up I could only see the small opening I came      through, and a straggling stream of light poured down that, but on      all sides profound darkness reigned supreme. A spark-like light my      son lit, reminded me of the lost Pleiad. About twenty-five or      thirty feet from the top I caught sight of a scene that made me      call on the men at the windlass to stop.       \"This caused them to think something was going wrong and one called      out to know what was the matter: I heard him say 'He is weakening.'      I assured them everything was right only I wanted to take a view;      so they stopped. Off at a distance of perhaps twenty-five feet was      an opening about ten feet or more wide and twelve feet high. The      light from the opening struck it fairly, owing to the position of      the sun at the time. Through this opening I saw into another room,      large and magnificent. It brought to mind the White City. It was      snowy white, and thickly studded with stalactites and stalagmites      of immense size and in great numbers; some looking like spires of      numerous churches, and many connected as with a lattice-work about      the bottom. For a short time I gazed on that lovely scene, and      examined the chances to reach it, but a great gulf intervened that      we had no means of spanning, and I called to the men to lower me      down. Approaching the bottom one of the walls trended in towards me      and I stepped upon solid ground close to the wall, which half way      up seemed fifty feet away. The opening above now looked like a      small pale moon, and the next man who came dangling down to join us      looked no bigger than a toy soldier. Gradually our eyes became      accustomed to the twilight, and by the time our party was increased      to six men, I could see quite distinctly.       \"The room runs directly into the mountain and is about ninety feet      high, and where we landed it proved to be twenty feet wide. It      extended in both directions, but much the farthest towards the      right hand. The outer room is encrusted in fine white water      formations. It forms a Gothic ceiling from which hang pendant at      all places brilliant and sparkling stalactites; some being of      immense size and length, from ten to twenty-five feet. Others are      not so large but are brilliant. We created a flood of artificial      light with dozens of candles and lamps; and then and not until      then, could we see the slope and contour of the roof. A few bats      were flitting about, disturbed for the first time. To the left, a      vast white pillar extended from floor to roof. It was pure white      and about five feet in diameter all the way up. It was fluted,      fretted, draped and spangled. I never in my life saw anything more      chaste and lovely. I thought of the countless ages it must have      taken to form that monument: of the streams of clear water that had      fallen and left their calcite deposits, while it grew year after      year, age after age, century after century, in this profound      darkness, disturbed by no noises save the rhythmic sound of the      falling drops and the dull flitting of the bats, who alone were the      living witnesses of its construction. To the rear of this great      pillar the room is divided into three galleries, one above another.      With great difficulty and much danger we climbed into each of      these. The floors were all like the pillar of pure white onyx, and      extended back a distance of thirty or more feet. The floor of one      formed the roof of another. They were brilliant with hanging      pendants and the side walls were all veneered with the same white      and crystalline formation. To entirely describe them is impossible.      A day in each would still leave the observer short of words in      which to tell of the wonders.       \"Turning towards the right hand from the entrance we advance two      hundred feet up an incline of dry clay, the room widening gradually      until its width is forty feet, when we reach the top of an      elevation thirty feet above the starting point, where a sudden      steep descent brings us to a halt. A stone cast down strikes water      and the sound of a splash comes back to us. With caution we seek      our way down the hill and stand on the edge of a small lake or      pond. Suddenly my son, who is in the lead, rushes back saying:      'Look out! I put my hand on a snake.' Some of us, being armed with      hickory canes that had been thrown down, concentrated our lights      and advanced. Sure enough, there is a snake a yard long coiled up      on a section of rotten wood. It proves to be a copperhead, the most      quarrelsome and vicious snake in this country; but his nature is      changed so that he makes no effort to fight and is killed with a      blow, and is sent to be hoisted up that we may examine him in      daylight. No others were found, and probably he had fallen in at      the opening, and spent a long, weary time in expiation of his      upper-earth crimes.       \"Examining the lake we find it to be about forty feet wide and the      same long, and it fills the room from wall to wall. We cannot pass      it so must either stop or wade through. We decide to wade, and on      measuring the water find it only two or three feet deep, with a      soft clay bottom, and in many places islands of stalagmite rise      above the surface.       \"On the sides of the lake there are formations in the shape of      sofas and lounges, and they appear to be cushioned, but the      cushions are found to be hard, solid rock. As the lights advance      across the lake new wonders are revealed. Curtains and draperies      hanging from the top almost touch the water and entirely cut off      the view beyond. Passing under a curtain at one of the highest      places, we emerge from the lake, and once more on dry land, advance      up a slope. Here the water formations have taken human shapes of      all sizes and several colors now appear and help to present a chaos      of beauty.       \"Two hundred feet more and the chamber ends in a vast waterfall,      but the water has turned to stone. Above the waterfall is an      opening, but it is twenty-five feet up a smooth wall and we have no      ladder. The journey was at an end. Tired, wet and muddy, we started      on our return trip; recrossed the dark lake, and retraced our steps      to the place under the opening without realizing that we had spent      six hours under ground. While the other members of the party, and      the specimens, were being raised to the surface, the writer sought      to learn the flora and fauna of this new region. The flora is      blank. Even the white mold so common in many caves is absent; and      no fungus grows on the poles, bark and rotten wood that have at      some past time been cast in.       \"In animal life the range is greater. I have mentioned the      ever-present bats, and dozens of them were seen. There were also      small, white eyeless salamanders, small, yellow, speckled      salamanders, with signs of eyes but no sight; also a jet black      salamander, which like the rest, was blind. The bats were of two      species--the common brown bat and the larger light grey or yellow      species. But this was not the time of the year to see many bats in      caves. In the summer season most of them go out and remain until      cool weather, and then return to the caves with their young; so I      was rather surprised to see as many as we did.       \"Down comes the rope for the last time, and taking my place, I soon      feel myself spinning around and slowly rising. As I again pass the      magic city I saw going down, a stronger wish than ever takes      possession of me to go there, and I look for any chance to solve      the problem of how such a journey can be made. 'Thou art so near      and yet so far.'       \"Suddenly I find myself emerging from the ground into a very hot      world, with the evening sun blazing so that the air feels like the      scorching heat of an oven; and my late companions are scattered      about under the trees, no doubt wishing themselves back in the cool      regions below the hot cliffs.       \"My final conclusions in regard to Fairy Cave were that it was      about six hundred feet long by from fifteen to forty feet wide and      from eighty to ninety feet high: that in the upper story there are      rooms that I could not reach, that will amply pay the scientist      and explorer to investigate in the future: that probably we reached      all the accessible parts in the level we traveled: that the      temperature was fifty-six or very near that degree: that small as      it is, it contains the finest formations and grandest scenery I      have ever seen in a cave: and I have examined over one hundred of      various sizes. I believe that for interior beauty its equal is not      to be found in America, and I sincerely believe that the verdict of      future exploration will establish the truth of the assertion, but      as equally good judges differ on such matters, time will be      required for a true and just decision. There are yet many promising      caves to be explored in this region, and if my strength holds out a      few years I hope to see them all.                                                     \"T.

The whole thing started when the clock on the Metropolitan Tower began to run backward. It was not a graceful proceeding. The hands had been moving onward in their customary deliberate fashion, slowly and thoughtfully, but suddenly the people in the offices near the clock's face heard an ominous creaking and groaning. There was a slight, hardly discernible shiver through the tower, and then something gave with a crash. The big hands on the clock began to move backward.  Immediately after the crash all the creaking and groaning ceased, and instead, the usual quiet again hung over everything. One or two of the occupants of the upper offices put their heads out into the halls, but the elevators were running as usual, the lights were burning, and all seemed calm and peaceful. The clerks and stenographers went back to their ledgers and typewriters, the business callers returned to the discussion of their errands, and the ordinary course of business was resumed.  Arthur Chamberlain was dictating a letter to Estelle Woodward, his sole stenographer. When the crash came he paused, listened, and then resumed his task.  It was not a difficult one. Talking to Estelle Woodward was at no time an onerous duty, but it must be admitted that Arthur Chamberlain found it difficult to keep his conversation strictly upon his business.  He was at this time engaged in dictating a letter to his principal creditors, the Gary & Milton Company, explaining that their demand for the immediate payment of the installment then due upon his office furniture was untimely and unjust. A young and budding engineer in New York never has too much money, and when he is young as Arthur Chamberlain was, and as fond of pleasant company, and not too fond of economizing, he is liable to find all demands for payment untimely and he usually considers them unjust as well. Arthur finished dictating the letter and sighed.  \"Miss Woodward,\" he said regretfully, \"I am afraid I shall never make a successful man.\"  Miss Woodward shook her head vaguely. She did not seem to take his remark very seriously, but then, she had learned never to take any of his remarks seriously. She had been puzzled at first by his manner of treating everything with a half-joking pessimism, but now ignored it.  She was interested in her own problems. She had suddenly decided that she was going to be an old maid, and it bothered her. She had discovered that she did not like any one well enough to marry, and she was in her twenty-second year.  She was not a native of New York, and the few young men she had met there she did not care for. She had regretfully decided she was too finicky, too fastidious, but could not seem to help herself. She could not understand their absorption in boxing and baseball and she did not like the way they danced.  She had considered the matter and decided that she would have to reconsider her former opinion of women who did not marry. Heretofore she had thought there must be something the matter with them. Now she believed that she would come to their own estate, and probably for the same reason. She could not fall in love and she wanted to.  She read all the popular novels and thrilled at the love-scenes contained in them, but when any of the young men she knew became in the slightest degree sentimental she found herself bored, and disgusted with herself for being bored. Still, she could not help it, and was struggling to reconcile herself to a life without romance.  She was far too pretty for that, of course, and Arthur Chamberlain often longed to tell her how pretty she really was, but her abstracted air held him at arms' length.  He lay back at ease in his swivel-chair and considered, looking at her with unfeigned pleasure. She did not notice it, for she was so much absorbed in her own thoughts that she rarely noticed anything he said or did when they were not in the line of her duties.  \"Miss Woodward,\" he repeated, \"I said I think I'll never make a successful man. Do you know what that means?\"  She looked at him mutely, polite inquiry in her eyes.  \"It means,\" he said gravely, \"that I'm going broke. Unless something turns up in the next three weeks, or a month at the latest, I'll have to get a job.\"  \"And that means--\" she asked.  \"All this will go to pot,\" he explained with a sweeping gesture. \"I thought I'd better tell you as much in advance as I could.\"  \"You mean you're going to give up your office--and me?\" she asked, a little alarmed.  \"Giving up you will be the harder of the two,\" he said with a smile, \"but that's what it means. You'll have no difficulty finding a new place, with three weeks in which to look for one, but I'm sorry.\"  \"I'm sorry, too, Mr. Chamberlain,\" she said, her brow puckered.  She was not really frightened, because she knew she could get another position, but she became aware of rather more regret than she had expected.  There was silence for a moment.  \"Jove!\" said Arthur, suddenly. \"It's getting dark, isn't it?\"  It was. It was growing dark with unusual rapidity. Arthur went to his window, and looked out.  \"Funny,\" he remarked in a moment or two. \"Things don't look just right, down there, somehow. There are very few people about.\"  He watched in growing amazement. Lights came on in the streets below, but none of the buildings lighted up. It grew darker and darker.  \"It shouldn't be dark at this hour!\" Arthur exclaimed.  Estelle went to the window by his side.  \"It looks awfully queer,\" she agreed. \"It must be an eclipse or something.\"  They heard doors open in the hall outside, and Arthur ran out. The halls were beginning to fill with excited people.  \"What on earth's the matter?\" asked a worried stenographer.  \"Probably an eclipse,\" replied Arthur. \"Only it's odd we didn't read about it in the papers.\"  He glanced along the corridor. No one else seemed better informed than he, and he went back into his office.  Estelle turned from the window as he appeared.  \"The streets are deserted,\" she said in a puzzled tone. \"What's the matter? Did you hear?\"  Arthur shook his head and reached for the telephone.  \"I'll call up and find out,\" he said confidently. He held the receiver to his ear. \"What the--\" he exclaimed. \"Listen to this!\"  A small-sized roar was coming from the receiver. Arthur hung up and turned a blank face upon Estelle.  \"Look!\" she said suddenly, and pointed out of the window.  All the city was now lighted up, and such of the signs as they could see were brilliantly illumined. They watched in silence. The streets once more seemed filled with vehicles. They darted along, their headlamps lighting up the roadway brilliantly. There was, however, something strange even about their motion. Arthur and Estelle watched in growing amazement and perplexity.  \"Are--are you seeing what I am seeing?\" asked Estelle breathlessly. \"_I_ see them _going backward_!\"  Arthur watched, and collapsed into a chair.  \"For the love of Mike!\" he exclaimed softly.     II.   He was roused by another exclamation from Estelle.  \"It's getting light again,\" she said.  Arthur rose and went eagerly to the window. The darkness was becoming less intense, but in a way Arthur could hardly credit.  Far to the west, over beyond the Jersey hills--easily visible from the height at which Arthur's office was located--a faint light appeared in the sky, grew stronger and then took on a reddish tint. That, in turn, grew deeper, and at last the sun appeared, rising unconcernedly _in the west_.  Arthur gasped. The streets below continued to be thronged with people and motor-cars. The sun was traveling with extraordinary rapidity. It rose overhead, and as if by magic the streets were thronged with people. Every one seemed to be running at top-speed. The few teams they saw moved at a breakneck pace--backward! In spite of the suddenly topsyturvy state of affairs there seemed to be no accidents.  Arthur put his hands to his head.  \"Miss Woodward,\" he said pathetically, \"I'm afraid I've gone crazy. Do you see the same things I do?\"  Estelle nodded. Her eyes wide open.  \"What _is_ the matter?\" she asked helplessly.  She turned again to the window. The square was almost empty once more. The motor-cars still traveling about the streets were going so swiftly they were hardly visible. Their speed seemed to increase steadily. Soon it was almost impossible to distinguish them, and only a grayish blur marked their paths along Fifth Avenue and Twenty-Third Street.  It grew dusk, and then rapidly dark. As their office was on the western side of the building they could not see that the sun had sunk in the east, but subconsciously they realized that this must be the case.  In silence they watched the panorama grow black except for the street-lamps, remain thus for a time, and then suddenly spring into brilliantly illuminated activity.  Again this lasted for a little while, and the west once more began to glow. The sun rose somewhat more hastily from the Jersey hills and began to soar overhead, but very soon darkness fell again. With hardly an interval the city became illuminated, and then the west grew red once more.  \"Apparently,\" said Arthur, steadying his voice with a conscious effort, \"there's been a cataclysm somewhere, the direction of the earth's rotation has been reversed, and its speed immensely increased. It seems to take only about five minutes for a rotation now.\"  As he spoke darkness fell for the third time. Estelle turned from the window with a white face.  \"What's going to happen?\" she cried.  \"I don't know,\" answered Arthur. \"The scientist fellows tell us if the earth were to spin fast enough the centrifugal force would throw us all off into space. Perhaps that's what's going to happen.\"  Estelle sank into a chair and stared at him, appalled. There was a sudden explosion behind them. With a start, Estelle jumped to her feet and turned. "]]]
