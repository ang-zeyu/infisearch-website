The Magi of highest rank abstained from every form of living thing as food, and the rest only partook of meat under certain restrictions. Their dress was unpretentious, they wore no jewels, and observed strict fidelity to the marriage vow;* and the virtues with which they were accredited obtained for them, from very early times, unbounded influence over the minds of the common people as well as over those of the nobles: the king himself boasted of being their pupil, and took no serious step in state affairs without consulting Ahura-mazdâ or the other gods by their mediation. The classical writers maintain that the Magi often cloaked monstrous vices under their apparent strictness, and it is possible that this was the case in later days, but even then moral depravity was probably rather the exception than the rule among them:*** the majority of the Magi faithfully observed the rules of honest living and ceremonial purity enjoined on them in the books handed down by their ancestors.       * Clement of Alexandria assures us that they were strictly      celibate, but besides the fact that married Magi are      mentioned several times, celibacy is still considered by      Zoroastrians an inferior state to that of marriage.       ** In the Greek period, a spurious epitaph of Darius, son of      Hystaspes, was quoted, in which the king says of himself, “I      was the pupil of the Magi.”       *** These accusations are nearly all directed against their      incestuous marriages: it seems that the classical writers      took for a refinement of debauchery what really was before      all things a religious practice.  There is reason to believe that the Magi were all-powerful among the Medes, and that the reign of Astyages was virtually the reign of the priestly caste; but all the Iranian states did not submit so patiently to their authority, and the Persians at last proved openly refractory. Their kings, lords of Susa as well as of Pasargadse, wielded all the resources of Elam, and their military power must have equalled, if it did not already surpass, that of their suzerain lords. Their tribes, less devoted to the manner of living of the Assyrians and Chaldćans, had preserved a vigour and power of endurance which the Medes no longer possessed; and they needed but an ambitious and capable leader, to rise rapidly from the rank of subjects to that of rulers of Iran, and to become in a short time masters of Asia. Such a chief they found in Cyrus,* son of Cambyses; but although no more illustrious name than his occurs in the list of the founders of mighty empires, the history of no other has suffered more disfigurement from the imagination of his own subjects or from the rancour of the nations he had conquered.**       * The original form of the name is Kűru, Kűrush, with a long      _o_, which forces us to reject the proposed connection with      the name of the Indian hero Kuru, in which the _u_ is short.      Numerous etymologies of the name Cyrus have been proposed.      The Persians themselves attributed to it the sense of _the      Sun_.       ** We possess two entirely different versions of the history      of the origin of Cyrus, but one, that of Herodotus, has      reached us intact, while that of Ctesias is only known to us      in fragments from extracts made by Nicolas of Damascus, and      by Photius. Spiegel and Duncker thought to recognise in the      tradition followed by Ctesias one of the Persian accounts of      the history of Cyrus, but Bauer refuses to admit this      hypothesis, and prefers to consider it as a romance put      together by the author, according to the taste of his own      times, from facts partly different from those utilised by      Herodotus, and partly borrowed from Herodotus himself: but      it should very probably be regarded as an account of Median      origin, in which the founder of the Persian empire is      portrayed in the most unfavourable light. Or perhaps it may      be regarded as the form of the legend current among the      Pharnaspids who established themselves as satraps of      Dascylium in the time of the Achćmenids, and to whom the      royal house of Cappadocia traced its origin. It is almost      certain that the account given by Herodotus represents a      Median version of the legend, and, considering the important      part played in it by Harpagus, probably that version which      was current among the descendants of that nobleman. The      historian Dinon, as far as we can judge from the extant      fragments of his work, and from the abridgment made by      Trogus Pompeius, adopted the narrative of Ctesias, mingling      with it, however, some details taken from Herodotus and the      romance of Xenophon, the Cyropodia.  The Medes, who could not forgive him for having made them subject to their ancient vassals, took delight in holding him up to scorn, and not being able to deny the fact of his triumph, explained it by the adoption of tortuous and despicable methods. They would not even allow that he was of royal birth, but asserted that he was of ignoble origin, the son of a female goatherd and a certain Atradates,* who, belonging to the savage clan of the Mardians, lived by brigandage. Cyrus himself, according to this account, spent his infancy and early youth in a condition not far short of slavery, employed at first in sweeping out the exterior portions of the palace, performing afterwards the same office in the private apartments, subsequently promoted to the charge of the lamps and torches, and finally admitted to the number of the royal cupbearers who filled the king’s goblet at table.       * According to one of the historians consulted by Strabo,      Cyrus himself, and not his father, was called Atradates.  [Illustration: 039.jpg A ROYAL HUNTING-PARTY IN HUN]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the silver vase in the Museum      of the Hermitage.  When he was at length enrolled in the bodyguard,* he won distinction by his skill in all military exercises, and having risen from rank to rank, received command of an expedition against the Cadusians.       * The tradition reproduced by Dinon narrated that Cyrus had      begun by serving among the Kavasses, the three hundred      staff-bearers who accompanied the sovereign when he appeared      in public, and that he passed next into the royal body-      guard, and that once having attained this rank, he passed      rapidly through all the superior grades of the military      profession.  On the march he fell in with a Persian groom named OEbaras,* who had been cruelly scourged for some misdeed, and was occupied in the transportation of manure in a boat: in obedience to an oracle the two united their fortunes, and together devised a vast scheme for liberating their compatriots from the Median yoke.       * This OEbaras whom Ctesias makes the accomplice of Cyrus,      seems to be an antedated forestallment of theoebaras whom      the tradition followed by Herodotus knows as master of the      horse under Darius, and to whom that king owed his elevation      to the throne.  How Atradates secretly prepared the revolt of the Mardians; how Cyrus left his camp to return to the court at Ecbatana, and obtained from Astyages permission to repair to his native country under pretext of offering sacrifices, but in reality to place himself at the head of the conspirators; how, finally, the indiscretion of a woman revealed the whole plot to a eunuch of the harem, and how he warned Astyages in the middle of his evening banquet by means of a musician or singing-girl, was frequently narrated by the Median bards in their epic poems, and hence the story spread until it reached in later times even as far as the Greeks.*       * According to Ctesias, it was a singing-girl who revealed      the existence of the plot to Astyages; according to Dinon,      it was the bard Angaręs. Windischmann has compared this name      with that of the Vedic guild of singers, the Angira.  Astyages, roused to action by the danger, abandons the pleasures of the chase in which his activity had hitherto found vent, sets out on the track of the rebel, wins a preliminary victory on the Hyrba, and kills the father of Cyrus: some days after, he again overtakes the rebels, at the entrance to the defiles leading to Pasargadse, and for the second time fortune is on the point of declaring in his favour, when the Persian women, bringing back their husbands and sons to the conflict, urge them on to victory. The fame of their triumph having spread abroad, the satraps and provinces successfully declared for the conqueror; Hyrcania, first, followed by the Parthians, the Sakae, and the Bactrians: Astyages was left almost alone, save for a few faithful followers, in the palace at Ecbatana. His daughter Amytis and his son-in-law Spitamas concealed him so successfully on the top of the palace, that he escaped discovery up to the moment when Cyrus was on the point of torturing his grandchildren to force them to reveal his hiding-place: thereupon he gave himself up to his enemies, but was at length, after being subjected to harsh treatment for a time, set at liberty and entrusted with the government of a mountain tribe dwelling to the south-east of the Caspian Sea, that of the Barcanians. Later on he perished through the treachery of OEbaras, and his corpse was left unburied in the desert, but by divine interposition relays of lions were sent to guard it from the attacks of beasts of prey: Cyrus, acquainted with this miraculous circumstance, went in search of the body and gave it a magnificent burial.* Another legend asserted, on the contrary, that Cyrus was closely connected with the royal line of Cyaxares; this tradition was originally circulated among the great Median families who attached themselves to the Achaemenian dynasty.**       * The passage in Herodotus leads Marquart to believe that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17329"],["title","History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 9 (of 12) (#7)"],["body","murder of Astyages formed part of the primitive legend,      but was possibly attributed to Cambysos, son of Cyrus,      rather than to OEbaras, the companion of the conqueror’s      early years.       ** This is the legend as told to Herodotus in Asia Minor,      probably by the members of the family of Harpagus, which the      Greek historian tried to render credible by interpreting the      miraculous incidents in a rationalising manner.  [Illustration: 042.jpg REMAINS OF THE PALACE OF ECBATANA]       Drawn by Boudier, from Coste and Flandin.  According to this legend Astyages had no male heirs, and the sceptre would have naturally descended from him to his daughter Mandanę and her sons. Astyages was much alarmed by a certain dream concerning his daughter: he dreamt that water gushed forth so copiously from her womb as to flood not only Ecbatana, but the whole of Asia, and the interpreters, as much terrified as himself, counselled him not to give Mandanę in marriage to a Persian noble of the race of the Achćmenids, named Cambyses; but a second dream soon troubled the security into which this union had lulled him: he saw issuing from his daughter’s womb a vine whose branches overshadowed Asia, and the interpreters, being once more consulted, predicted that a grandson was about to be born to him whose ambition would cost him his crown. He therefore bade a certain nobleman of his court, named Harpagus--he whose descendants preserved this version of the story of Cyrus--to seize the infant and put it to death as soon as its mother should give it birth; but the man, touched with pity, caused the child to be exposed in the woods by one of the royal shepherds. A bitch gave suck to the tiny creature, who, however, would soon have succumbed to the inclemency of the weather, had not the shepherd’s wife, being lately delivered of a still-born son, persuaded her husband to rescue the infant, whom she nursed with the same tenderness as if he had been her own child. The dog was, as we know, a sacred animal among the Iranians: the incident of the bitch seems, then, to have been regarded by them as an indication of divine intervention, but the Greeks were shocked by the idea, and invented an explanation consonant with their own customs. They supposed that the woman had borne the name of Spakô: Spakô signifying _bitch_ in the language of Media.*       * Herodotus asserts that the child’s foster-mother was      called in Greek _Kynô_, in Median _Spalcô_, which comes to      the same thing, for _spaha_ means _bitch_ in Median. Further      on he asserts that the parents of the child heard of the      name of his nurse with joy, as being of good augury; “and,      in order that the Persians might think that Cyrus had been      preserved alive by divine agency, _they spread abroad the      report that Cyrus had been suckled by a bitch_. And thus      arose the fable commonly accepted.” Trogus Pompeius received      the original story probably through Dinon, and inserted it      in his book.  Cyrus grew to boyhood, and being accepted by Mandanę as her son, returned to the court; his grandfather consented to spare his life, but, to avenge himself on Harpagus, he caused the limbs of the nobleman’s own son to be served up to him at a feast. Thenceforth Harpagus had but one idea, to overthrow the tyrant and transfer the crown to the young prince: his project succeeded, and Cyrus, having overcome Astyages, was proclaimed king by the Medes as well as by the Persians. The real history of Cyrus, as far as we can ascertain it, was less romantic. We gather that Kurush, known to us as Cyrus, succeeded his father Cambyses as ruler of Anshân about 559 or 558 B.C.,* and that he revolted against Astyages in 553 or 552 B.C.,** and defeated him. The Median army thereupon seizing its own leader, delivered him into the hands of the conqueror: Ecbatana was taken and sacked, and the empire fell at one blow, or, more properly speaking, underwent a transformation (550 B.C.). The transformation was, in fact, an internal revolution in which the two peoples of the same race changed places. The name of the Medes lost nothing of the prestige which it enjoyed in foreign lands, but that of the Persians was henceforth united with it, and shared its renown: like Astyages and his predecessors, Cyrus and his successors reigned equally over the two leading branches of the ancient Iranian stock, but whereas the former had been kings of the Medes and Persians, the latter became henceforth kings of the Persians and Medes.***       * The length of Cyrus’ reign is fixed at thirty years by      Ctesias, followed by Dinon and Trogus Pompeius, but at      twenty-nine years by Herodotus, whose computation I here      follow. Hitherto the beginning of his reign has been made to      coincide with the fall of Astyages, which was consequently      placed in 569 or 568 B.C., but the discovery of the _Annals      of Nabonidus_ obliges us to place the taking of Ecbatana in      the sixth year of the Babylonian king, which corresponds to      the year 550 B.C., and consequently to hold that Cyrus      reckoned his twenty-nine years from the moment when he      succeeded his father Cambyses.       ** The inscription on the _Rassam Cylinder of Abu-Habba_,      seems to make the fall of the Median king, who was suzerain      of the Scythians of Harrân, coincide with the third year of      Nabonidus, or the year 553-2 B.C. But it is only the date of      the commencement of hostilities between Cyrus and Astyages      which is here furnished, and this manner of interpreting the      text agrees with the statement of the Median traditions      handed down by the classical authors, that three combats      took place between Astyages and Cyrus before the final      victory of the Persians.       *** This equality of the two peoples is indicated by the      very terms employed by Darius, whom he speaks of them, in      the _Great Inscription of Behistun_. He says, for example,      in connection with the revolt of the false Smerdis, that      “the deception prevailed greatly in the land, in Persia and      Media as well as in the other provinces,” and further on,      that “the whole people rose, and passed over from Cambyses      to him, Persia and Media as well as the other countries.” In      the same way he mentions “the army of Persians and Medes      which was with him,” and one sees that he considered Medes      and Persians to be on exactly the same footing.  The change effected was so natural that their nearest neighbours, the Chaldćans, showed no signs of uneasiness at the outset. They confined themselves to the bare registration of the fact in their annals at the appointed date, without comment, and Nabonidus in no way deviated from the pious routine which it had hitherto pleased him to follow. Under a sovereign so good-natured there was little likelihood of war, at all events with external foes, but insurrections were always breaking out in different parts of his territory, and we read of difficulties in Khumę in the first year of his reign, in Hamath in his second year, and troubles in Plionicia in the third year, which afforded an opportunity for settling the Tyrian question. Tyre had led a far from peaceful existence ever since the day when, from sheer apathy, she had accepted the supremacy of Nebuchadrezzar.*       * All these events are known through the excerpt from      Menander preserved to us by Josephus in his treatise      _Against Apion_.  Baal II. had peacefully reigned there for ten years (574-564), but after his death the people had overthrown the monarchy, and various _suffetes_ had followed one another rapidly--Eknibaal ruled two months, Khelbes ten months, the high priest Abbar three months, the two brothers Mutton and Gerastratus six years, all of them no doubt in the midst of endless disturbances; whereupon a certain Baalezor restored the royal dignity, but only to enjoy it for the space of one year. On his death, the inhabitants begged the Chaldćans to send them, as a successor to the crown, one of those princes whom, according to custom, Baal had not long previously given over as hostages for a guarantee of his loyalty, and Nergal-sharuzur for this purpose selected from their number Mahar-baal, who was probably a son of Ithobaal (558-557).* When, at the end of four years, the death of Mahar-baal left the throne vacant (554-553), the Tyrians petitioned for his brother Hirôm, and Nabonidus, who was then engaged in Syria, came south as far as Phoenicia and installed the prince.**       * The fragment of Menander does not give the Babylonian      king’s name, but a simple chronological calculation proves      him to have been Nergal-sharuzur.       ** _Annals of Nabonidus_, where mention is made of a certain      Nabu-makhdan-uzur--but the reading of the name is uncertain      --who seems to be in revolt against the Chaldćans. Floigl has      very ingeniously harmonised the dates of the Annals with      those obtained from the fragment of Menander, and has thence      concluded that the object of the expedition of the third      year was the enthroning of Hirôm which is mentioned in the      fragment, and during whose fourteenth year Cyrus became King      of Babylon.  This took place at the very moment when Cyrus was preparing his expedition against Astyages; and the Babylonian monarch took advantage of the agitation into which the Medes were thrown by this invasion, to carry into execution a project which he had been planning ever since his accession. Shortly after that event he had had a dream, in which Marduk, the great lord, and Sin, the light of heaven and earth, had appeared on either side of his couch, the former addressing him in the following words: “Nabonidus, King of Babylon, with the horses of thy chariot bring brick, rebuild E-khul-khul, the temple of Harrân, that Sin, the great lord, may take up his abode therein.” Nabonidus had"]]]
