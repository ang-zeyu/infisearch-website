View showing permanent and temporary supports of 9th Ave. Structures, looking Northwest from 31st. St. April 24, 07.]  [Illustration: PLATE XLVII, FIG. 4.--TW 28, P.T. & T.R.R. Co. Terminal Station West. East side of 9th Avenue, North of 32nd St. looking West, showing rock excavation and supports of 9th Avenue structures. Aug. 17, 07.]  Fig. 1, Plate XLVII, shows the elevated railway structure and the street surface prior to the commencement of the work.  The east track is used for north-bound local trains, the west track for south-bound local trains, and the central track for south-bound express trains between 7 and 9.30 A.M. and for north-bound express trains between 2.30 and 7 P.M. It is said that an average of 90,000 passengers are carried over this structure every 24 hours.  _Surface Railway Structure of the New York City Railway Company._--This is an electric surface railway of the ordinary type, the rail and slot being bedded in concrete, with cast-iron yokes every 5 ft. There are manholes every 100 ft., and cleaning-out holes every 15 ft. Power conduits are bedded in the concrete on the east side of the east track.  _Forty-eight-Inch Brick Sewer._--This sewer was in the center of Ninth Avenue, with the invert about 12 ft. below the surface, and manholes about 100 ft. apart, and had to be abandoned in this position to allow the transverse girders to be put in place to carry all structures while the excavation was being done.  _Twenty-four-Inch Cast-Iron Water Main._--This water main was laid under the west elevated railway columns, with its top about 3 ft. below the surface, a space being left for it in the brick foundations, and a large column base casting being used to span it. Valves were installed, one north of 33d Street and one south of 31st Street, prior to excavating near the pipe, so that if it was broken the water could be shut off promptly.  _Street Surface._--It was the original intention to close and excavate the east side of the avenue and to erect there a street-traffic trestle before closing the west side, but, at the contractor's request, both sides were closed, and all vehicular traffic was turned into the center. A light trestle on the west side of the avenue provided for pedestrian traffic.  _Other Sub-surface Structures._--There were various gas mains, water mains, electric conduits, manholes, hydrants, etc., in the avenue, and most of these were cut out temporarily, at the contractor's request, to be replaced subsequently.  _Supports for Elevated Railway Structure._--As stated previously, the central track had to be supported independently.  The overhead girders, known as girders \"B\", were therefore designed as shown on Fig. 1, and put in place as shown on Figs. 2 and 3. The outside tracks were blocked directly on these girders, and the central track was supported by blocking up the transverse girders on I-beams placed between the girders \"B\"; and no blocking was placed between the girders \"B\" and the longitudinal girders carrying the central track. The weight on each column was assumed to be 172,000 lb.  [Illustration: FIG. 1. (Full page image)  DETAILS OF STEEL GIRDERS, ETC. SUPPORTING NINTH AVENUE STRUCTURES]  _Supports for Surface Railway Structure._--A uniform load of 3,000 lb. per lin. ft. of single track, with the weight of a car at 39,000 lb., was assumed. Several feet of earth, between the structure and the rock, were mined out, and the structure was supported on I-beams and posts, and ultimately on the transverse girders by using timber bents under the I-beams, as shown on Fig. 3.  _Water Mains and Sewer._--Cradles were designed for the support of the 48-in. and 24-in. water mains, resting on the transverse girders, and the 48-in. cast-iron sewer on the east side of the avenue was carried on I-beams bracketed to the ends of the transverse girders, as shown on Figs. 1 and 2.  [Illustration: FIG. 2. (Full page image)  METHOD OF SUPPORTING ELEVATED RAILWAY STRUCTURE]  [Illustration: FIG. 3. (Full page image)  METHOD OF SUPPORTING TRACKS OF NEW YORK CITY RAILWAY CO.]  _Girders \"C.\"_--The transverse girders below the street surface, referred to above, were known as girders \"C,\" and they were put in place at first resting on concrete piers on the central core; the weight of all structures was placed on them while the sides of the avenue were being excavated, and the sides of the viaduct were being built. The ends of these girders were then picked up on the sides of the viaduct, and, spanning the central rock core, carried all structures while the core was being excavated and the viaduct completed. New foundations were then placed on the deck of the viaduct to carry all structures.  Fifty-four of these girders were required, each weighing about 19,000 lb. The bents carrying the ends of these girders on the sides of the viaduct are shown on Fig. 2. They were of long-leaf yellow pine. These girders were located so that a cradle could be laid on them east of the elevated railway structure to carry a proposed 48-in. cast-iron water main.  _Girders \"B.\"_--Eighteen of these girders were required, each weighing about 6,000 lb. The timber bents supporting these girders, shown on Fig. 2, were of long-leaf yellow pine.  The total weight, including the elevated railway structure, surface railway structure, pipes, etc., supported during the work, amounted to about 5,000 tons.  _Details of the Work._--The method in general is shown on Figs. 4 and 5. At first the east side of the avenue was closed and excavated down to rock, the earth was mined out under alternate yokes of the surface railway structure, and temporary posts were placed under the yokes to support the structure while the remainder of the earth was being removed. Then needle-beams and posts were placed under each yoke. The concrete forming the track structure was then enclosed with planking to prevent it from cracking and falling. I-beams were then placed under the needle-beams carrying the structures, and these were carried on posts; they were changed alternately until the excavation had been taken out to a depth of about 16 ft. below the surface. In placing these I-beams, heavier blocking was used in the center of the span than at the ends where the bents would come, to prevent the subsidence of the track owing to the sag in the I-beams. As much excavation, to a depth of about 20 ft., was taken out adjoining the elevated railway foundations as could be done with safety. Fig. 2, Plate XLVII, shows this condition of the work. The 48-in. brick sewer was broken, and the sewage was pumped across the excavation.  The overhead girders \"B\" were then put in place, and two of the girders \"C\" were used as temporary shoring girders at each column. These, as shown by Fig. 3, Plate XLVII, were placed parallel to the elevated railway, with blocking between them and the girders \"B.\" Double bents, independent of each other, were placed under the ends of these temporary shoring girders, and these were braced securely to prevent possible dislodgment during the removal of the rock. The weight of the structure was then taken by jacking up the girders near the bents until the column was lifted off the old foundation; blocking was put in between the girders and the bents during the jacking, so that when the jacks were released the base of the column was still clear of the old foundation. One 80-ton jack was used for this purpose, and the general method is shown by Fig. 1, Plate LII.  [Illustration: FIG. 4.

Four sets of these temporary shoring girders were used in this manner, two sets starting at the north end and two sets at about the middle of the work, and these sets were moved south as they were released.  The columns being thus supported on temporary shoring girders, the old foundations were removed and the excavation was taken down to a level about 16 ft. below the surface.  Two sets of three of the girders \"C\" were then put in place under the avenue at each column, each set being placed on four concrete piers 6 ft. square with spaces of 4 ft. between them, so that the outside of the outside pier would be 18 ft. from the center of the avenue and 32 ft. from the house line. This is shown on Fig. 5 and on Fig. 3, Plate XLVII. Four small piers were used, as they could be more easily removed than one continuous pier. The girders \"C\" were set to line and grade, and the piers were built under them, great care being taken to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17302"],["title","Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, vol. LXVIII, Sept. 1910 (#2)"],["body","the concrete well under the girders so as to give a firm bearing.  After these girders \"C\" were in place it was necessary to remove the temporary shoring girders before the bents could be erected on girders \"C\" to support girders \"B,\" being in the same plane; and provision had to be made to support the structure while this was being done. Therefore, double bents were erected directly beneath the columns, as shown by Figs. 2, 4, and 5, and by Fig. 3, Plate XLVII. These were built with their sills resting on the girders \"C,\" and blocking was put in between the sills and the rock to carry the full weight of the structure. Later, when the weight of the structure was carried on the permanent bents, this blocking was knocked out, but the bents were left in to carry the weight of the column itself, which was swinging more or less from the structure above. The weight of the structure was placed on these bents directly beneath the columns by jacking up the temporary girders again, putting blocking between the bents and the base of the columns, and taking out the blocking which had been put in previously under the temporary shoring girders. The 24-in. water main was carried over the excavation on cables from the temporary shoring girders, except when they were being jacked up, at which time posts were placed beneath it.  Anchor-bolts were put in place between the column bases and the bents directly beneath, in order to increase the lateral stiffness, and raker braces were also used. This having been done, the temporary shoring girders were moved south to the next column, where the process was repeated. The timber bents, shown in detail by Fig. 2, were then put in place as shown by Figs. 4 and 5, and by Fig. 3, Plate XLVII. These bents were framed as tightly as possible, using generally a 20-ton jack, and they were erected simultaneously at each pair of columns. The weight was taken on these columns by jacking up directly beneath the column base and taking out the blocking between this base and the bent directly beneath the column. On releasing the jack the weight was transferred to the permanent timber bents, and the east and west columns of each pair were transferred on the same day. One 80-ton jack was used on the easterly columns and two were necessary on the westerly columns, one on each side of the 24-in. water main. The raker braces of these permanent bents were not framed as tightly as the main posts, in order that the main post should carry the entire weight and the raker braces merely steady the structure.  Timber bents were erected on girders \"C\" to carry the I-beams under the surface railway structure, as shown on Fig. 3, and all temporary posts under these I-beams were removed. The bents were framed with a jack, as tightly as possible, and very little settlement of the track occurred.  A cradle was then built under the 24-in. water main and placed on girders \"C,\" and, as a temporary footwalk had been constructed on the west side of the avenue, it will be seen that all structures were thus carried on girders \"C.\"  All structures were put on the girders \"C\" before continuing the excavation on the sides of the avenue because, in case of a slide of rock, there would be less danger than to individual structures. The outside piers, on which the girders \"C\" rested, might even be lost, without affecting the stability of the structure, and posting could readily be done beneath these girders in case of necessity.  A very careful record of levels, taken on the elevated railway columns, was kept, observations being made during each jacking up and at least twice a week during the progress of the work. The columns were usually kept about 1/2 in. high so as to allow for compression in the timber bents.  As a rule, no jacking of the elevated railway structure was done while trains were passing over, and trains were flagged during the operation. There was generally very little delay, as all jacking was done between 10.30 A.M. and 2.30 P.M., when the traffic was lightest, and frequently the jacking was done between trains, causing no delay whatever. Steel clamps were placed, three on the top and three on the bottom of each set of the girders \"C,\" to bind them together and cause them to act as a unit.  All structures then being supported on girders \"C,\" which were carried on four concrete piers resting on the central rock core, the excavation on the sides of the avenue was continued down to sub-grade and the east and west portions of the concrete north abutment were constructed. The central rock core was about 36 ft. wide on the top and 45 ft. wide on the bottom, and at the center of 32d Street it was about 42 ft. high.  It was the original intention to excavate a sufficient width of the sides of the avenue to erect six rows of the permanent steel viaduct, 5 ft. from center to center, and this was done on the south portion of the work. On the north portion, however, the rock was of poor quality, and it was thought best to excavate for only five rows at first, to erect the five rows of permanent steel and put the timber bents in place under the ends of the girders \"C,\" in order to give them some support while the outside concrete piers were being removed and the excavation was being widened out to permit the erection of the sixth row. Additional raker braces were put in these bents temporarily, and were removed when the sixth row of steel had been erected. This is shown on Figs. 4 and 5.

East side of Ninth Ave. looking North from 31st St., showing underpinning of Ninth Ave. Structures. Aug. 10, 08.]  Fig. 4, Plate XLVII, and Fig. 1, Plate XLVIII, show the structures supported on the central rock core and the excavation on the east side to permit of the erection of the permanent viaduct girders. Fig. 1, Plate XLVIII, shows also the easterly portion of the concrete north abutment. Fig. 2, Plate XLVIII, shows five rows of the permanent viaduct girders erected on the east side of the work.  The excavation of the sides of the avenue having been completed, and six rows of permanent viaduct girders erected on both sides, timber bents, as shown on Figs. 2, 4, 5, and 6, were erected on this steel to support the ends of the girders \"C\" and carry the structure while the rock core was being excavated. Fig. 3, Plate XLVIII, shows the method of taking the weight on these bents. Four 80-ton jacks were used, and oak blocks were placed on the top of each jack to transmit pressure to a temporary oak cap under the girders \"C\" independent of the bents; all four of these jacks were operated simultaneously, and the girders \"C\" were lifted off the bents and clear of the concrete piers. Oak filling pieces were then inserted between the bents and the girders \"C,\" so that when the jacks were released the girders \"C\" were clear of the concrete piers. Fig. 3, Plate XLVIII, shows that the girders have been lifted off the piers. Elevations were taken on each set of girders during each operation, and careful observations were made on the elevated railway columns. Where the rock was very close to these bents, the open space between the posts was filled with blocking so that there would be less danger of the bent shifting if struck by blasted materials. Fig. 3, Plate XLVIII, shows one of these bents filled with blocking.  All structures being carried on girders \"C,\" which, in turn, were carried on the sides of the permanent viaduct, the central core was excavated. Fig. 4, Plate XLVIII, and Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4, Plate XLIX, show various views of the work at this stage.  The central portion of the viaduct was then erected, and, using concrete piers and timber bents, all structures were placed on its deck. Fig. 3, Plate XLIX, shows the piers under the elevated railway columns prior to the removal of girders \"C.\"  [Illustration: FIG. 6. (Full page image)  GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT STRUCTURES]  During the latter part of 1908 a 48-in. cast-iron water main was laid by the city on a cradle built by the Railroad Company on girders \"C\" on the east side of the avenue. This is part of the high-pressure system, and the location and elevation of this water main were taken into consideration when the underpinning was designed. This main, and the 48-in. cast-iron sewer bracketed to girders \"C,\" are shown on Fig. 4, Plate XLVIII.  Elevations had been taken on marks on the elevated railway columns between 30th and 34th Streets at the time the original surveys were made, in 1902, and these marks were used to test the level of the structure during the progress of the excavation.  At the extreme south end of the work the procedure was changed. The east side was excavated down to sub-grade, the east portion of the south abutment was constructed, and six rows of the permanent steel viaduct were erected. Very little excavation had been done on the west side of the avenue at the south end of the work, and it would have delayed the completion of the work to have waited for the excavation for and the construction of the west portion of the south abutment and the erection of the steel; therefore, instead of supporting the girders \"C\" on the central rock core, the east ends were taken up on the permanent viaduct girders, and"]]]
