I am modelling a vessel not of fine-spun glass, but of molten gold.\"  \"You make me exceedingly anxious to know what you have in store for us. It seems to me you have reached a point where even you can no longer surpass yourself.\"  Reginald smiled. \"Your praise is too generous, yet it warms like sunshine. I will confess that my conception is unique. It combines with the ripeness of my technique the freshness of a second spring.\"  Ernest was bubbling with anticipated delights. His soul responded to Reginald's touch as a harp to the winds. \"When,\" he cried, \"shall we be privileged to see it?\"  Reginald's eyes were already straying back to his writing table. \"If the gods are propitious,\" he remarked, \"I shall complete it to-night. To-morrow is my reception, and I have half promised to read it then.\"  \"Perhaps I shall be in the position soon to let you see my play.\"  \"Let us hope so,\" Reginald replied absent-mindedly. The egotism of the artist had once more chained him to his work.     X   That night a brilliant crowd had gathered in Reginald Clarke's house. From the studio and the adjoining salon arose a continual murmur of well-tuned voices. On bare white throats jewels shone as if in each a soul were imprisoned, and voluptuously rustled the silk that clung to the fair slim forms of its bearers in an undulating caress. Subtle perfumes emanated from the hair and the hands of syren women, commingling with the soft plump scent of their flesh. Fragrant tapers, burning in precious crystal globules stained with exquisite colours, sprinkled their shimmering light over the fashionable assemblage and lent a false radiance to the faces of the men, while in the hair and the jewels of the women each ray seemed to dance like an imp with its mate.  A seat like a throne, covered with furs of tropic beasts of prey, stood in one corner of the room in the full glare of the light, waiting for the monarch to come. Above were arranged with artistic _raffinement_ weird oriental draperies, resembling a crimson canopy in the total effect. Chattering visitors were standing in groups, or had seated themselves on the divans and curiously-fashioned chairs that were scattered in seeming disorder throughout the salon. There were critics and writers and men of the world. Everybody who was anybody and a little bigger than somebody else was holding court in his own small circle of enthusiastic admirers. The Bohemian element was subdued, but not entirely lacking. The magic of Reginald Clarke's name made stately dames blind to the presence of some individuals whom they would have passed on the street without recognition.  Ernest surveyed this gorgeous assembly with the absent look of a sleep-walker. Not that his sensuous soul was unsusceptible to the atmosphere of culture and corruption that permeated the whole, nor to the dazzling colour effects that tantalised while they delighted the eye. But to-night they shrivelled into insignificance before the splendour of his inner vision. A radiant dreamland palace, his play, had risen from the night of inchoate thought. It was wonderful, it was real, and needed for its completion only the detail of actual construction. And now the characters were hovering in the recesses of his brain, were yearning to leave that many-winded labyrinth to become real beings of paper and ink. He would probably have tarried overlong in this fanciful mansion, had not the reappearance of an unexpected guest broken his reverie.  \"Jack!\" he exclaimed in surprise, \"I thought you a hundred miles away from here.\"  \"That shows that you no longer care for me,\" Jack playfully answered. \"When our friendship was young, you always had a presentiment of my presence.\"  \"Ah, perhaps I had. But tell me, where do you hail from?\"  \"Clarke called me up on the telephone--long-distance, you know. I suppose it was meant as a surprise for you. And you certainly looked surprised--not even pleasantly. I am really head-over-heels at work. But you know how it is. Sometimes a little imp whispers into my ears daring me to do a thing which I know is foolish. But what of it? My legs are strong enough not to permit my follies to overtake me.\"  \"It was certainly good of you to come. In fact, you make me very glad. I feel that I need you to-night--I don't know why. The feeling came suddenly--suddenly as you. I only know I need you. How long can you stay?\"  \"I must leave you to-morrow morning. I have to hustle somewhat. You know my examinations are taking place in a day or two and I've got to cram up a lot of things.\"  \"Still,\" remarked Ernest, \"your visit will repay you for the loss of time. Clarke will read to us to-night his masterpiece.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"I don't know. I only know it's the real thing. It's worth all the wisdom bald-headed professors may administer to you in concentrated doses at five thousand a year.\"  \"Come now,\" Jack could not help saying, \"is your memory giving way? Don't you remember your own days in college--especially the mathematical examinations? You know that your marks came always pretty near the absolute zero.\"  \"Jack,\" cried Ernest in honest indignation, \"not the last time. The last time I didn't flunk.\"  \"No, because your sonnet on Cartesian geometry roused even the math-fiend to compassion. And don't you remember Professor Squeeler, whose heart seemed to leap with delight whenever he could tell you that, in spite of incessant toil on your part, he had again flunked you in physics with fifty-nine and a half per cent.?\"  \"And he wouldn't raise the mark to sixty! God forgive him,--I cannot.\"  Here their exchange of reminiscences was interrupted. There was a stir. The little potentates of conversation hastened to their seats, before their minions had wholly deserted them.  The king was moving to his throne!  Assuredly Reginald Clarke had the bearing of a king. Leisurely he took his seat under the canopy.  A hush fell on the audience; not a fan stirred as he slowly unfolded his manuscript.     XI   The music of Reginald Clarke's intonation captivated every ear. Voluptuously, in measured cadence, it rose and fell; now full and strong like the sound of an organ, now soft and clear like the tinkling of bells. His voice detracted by its very tunefulness from what he said. The powerful spell charmed even Ernest's accustomed ear. The first page gracefully glided from Reginald's hand to the carpet before the boy dimly realised that he was intimately familiar with every word that fell from Reginald's lips. When the second page slipped with seeming carelessness from the reader's hand, a sudden shudder ran through the boy's frame. It was as if an icy hand had gripped his heart. There could be no doubt of it. This was more than mere coincidence. It was plagiarism. He wanted to cry out. But the room swam before his eyes. Surely he must be dreaming. It was a dream. The faces of the audience, the lights, Reginald, Jack--all phantasmagoria of a dream.  Perhaps he had been ill for a long time. Perhaps Clarke was reading the play for him. He did not remember having written it. But he probably had fallen sick after its completion. What strange pranks our memories will play us! But no! He was not dreaming, and he had not been ill.  He could endure the horrible uncertainty no longer. His overstrung nerves must find relaxation in some way or break with a twang. He turned to his friend who was listening with rapt attention.  \"Jack, Jack!\" he whispered.  \"What is it?\"  \"That is my play!\"  \"You mean that you inspired it?\"  \"No, I have written it, or rather, was going to write it.\"  \"Wake up, Ernest! You are mad!\"  \"No, in all seriousness. It is mine. I told you--don't you remember--when we returned from Coney Island--that I was writing a play.\"  \"Ah, but not this play.\"  \"Yes, this play. I conceived it, I practically wrote it.\"  \"The more's the pity that Clarke had preconceived it.\"  \"But it is mine!\"  \"Did you tell him a word about it?\"  \"No, to be sure.\"  \"Did you leave the manuscript in your room?\"  \"I had, in fact, not written a line of it. No, I had not begun the actual writing.\"  \"Why should a man of Clarke's reputation plagiarise your plays, written or unwritten?\"  \"I can see no reason. But--\"  \"Tut, tut.\"  For already this whispered conversation had elicited a look like a stab from a lady before them.  Ernest held fast to the edge of a chair. He must cling to some reality, or else drift rudderless in a dim sea of vague apprehensions.  Or was Jack right?  Was his mind giving way? No! No! No! There must be a monstrous secret somewhere, but what matter? Did anything matter? He had called on his mate like a ship lost in the fog. For the first time he had not responded. He had not understood. The bitterness of tears rose to the boy's eyes.  Above it all, melodiously, ebbed and flowed the rich accents of Reginald Clarke.  Ernest listened to the words of his own play coming from the older man's mouth. The horrible fascination of the scene held him entranced. He saw the creations of his mind pass in review before him, as a man might look upon the face of his double grinning at him from behind a door in the hideous hours of night.  They were all there! The mad king. The subtle-witted courtiers. The sombre-hearted Prince. The Queen-Mother who had loved a jester better than her royal mate, and the fruit of their shameful alliance, the Princess Marigold, a creature woven of sunshine and sin.  Swiftly the action progressed. Shadows of impending death darkened the house of the King. In the horrible agony of the rack the old jester confessed. Stripped of his cap and bells, crowned with a wreath of blood, he looked so pathetically funny that the Princess Marigold could not help laughing between her tears.  The Queen stood there all trembling and pale. Without a complaint she saw her lover die. The executioner's sword smote the old man's head straight from the trunk. It rolled at the feet of the King, who tossed it to Marigold. The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17144"],["title","The House of the Vampire (#5)"],["body"," Princess kissed it and covered the grinning horror with her yellow veil.  The last words died away.  There was no applause. Only silence. All were stricken with the dread that men feel in the house of God or His awful presence in genius.  But the boy lay back in his chair. The cold sweat had gathered on his brow and his temples throbbed. Nature had mercifully clogged his head with blood. The rush of it drowned the crying voice of the nerves, deadening for a while both consciousness and pain.     XII   Somehow the night had passed--somehow in bitterness, in anguish. But it had passed.  Ernest's lips were parched and sleeplessness had left its trace in the black rings under the eyes, when the next morning he confronted Reginald in the studio.  Reginald was sitting at the writing-table in his most characteristic pose, supporting his head with his hand and looking with clear piercing eyes searchingly at the boy.  \"Yes,\" he observed, \"it's a most curious psychical phenomenon.\"  \"You cannot imagine how real it all seemed to me.\"  The boy spoke painfully, dazed, as if struck by a blow.  \"Even now it is as if something has gone from me, some struggling thought that I cannot--cannot remember.\"  Reginald regarded him as a physical experimenter might look upon the subject of a particularly baffling mental disease.  \"You must not think, my boy, that I bear you any malice for your extraordinary delusion. Before Jack went away he gave me an exact account of all that has happened. Divers incidents recurred to him from which it appears that, at various times in the past, you have been on the verge of a nervous collapse.\"  A nervous collapse! What was the use of this term but a euphemism for insanity?  \"Do not despair, dear child,\" Reginald caressingly remarked. \"Your disorder is not hopeless, not incurable. Such crises come to every man who writes. It is the tribute we pay to the Lords of Song. The minnesinger of the past wrote with his heart's blood; but we moderns dip our pen into the sap of our nerves. We analyse life, love art--and the dissecting knife that we use on other men's souls finally turns against ourselves.  \"But what shall a man do? Shall he sacrifice art to hygiene and surrender the one attribute that makes him chiefest of created things? Animals, too, think. Some walk on two legs. But introspection differentiates man from the rest. Shall we yield up the sweet consciousness of self that we derive from the analysis of our emotion, for the contentment of the bull that ruminates in the shade of a tree or the healthful stupidity of a mule?\"  \"Assuredly not.\"  \"But what shall a man do?\"  \"Ah, that I cannot tell. Mathematics offers definite problems that admit of a definite solution. Life states its problems with less exactness and offers for each a different solution. One and one are two to-day and to-morrow. Psychical values, on each manipulation, will yield a different result. Still, your case is quite clear. You have overworked yourself in the past, mentally and emotionally. You have sown unrest, and must not be surprised if neurasthenia is the harvest thereof.\"  \"Do you think--that I should go to some sanitarium?\" the boy falteringly asked.  \"God forbid! Go to the seashore, somewhere where you can sleep and play. Take your body along, but leave your brain behind--at least do not take more of it with you than is necessary. The summer season in Atlantic City has just begun. There, as everywhere in American society, you will be much more welcome if you come without brains.\"  Reginald's half-bantering tone reassured Ernest a little. Timidly he dared approach once more the strange event that had wrought such havoc with his nervous equilibrium.  \"How do you account for my strange obsession--one might almost call it a mania?\"  \"If it could be accounted for it would not be strange.\"  \"Can you suggest no possible explanation?\"  \"Perhaps a stray leaf on my desk a few indications of the plot, a remark--who knows? Perhaps thought-matter is floating in the air. Perhaps--but we had better not talk of it now. It would needlessly excite you.\"  \"You are right,\" answered Ernest gloomily, \"let us not talk of it. But whatever may be said, it is a marvellous play.\"  \"You flatter me. There is nothing in it that you may not be able to do equally well--some day.\"  \"Ah, no,\" the boy replied, looking up to Reginald with admiration. \"You are the master.\"     XIII   Lazily Ernest stretched his limbs on the beach of Atlantic City. The sea, that purger of sick souls, had washed away the fever and the fret of the last few days. The wind was in his hair and the spray was in his breath, while the rays of the sun kissed his bare arms and legs. He rolled over in the glittering sand in the sheer joy of living.  Now and then a wavelet stole far into the beach, as if to caress him, but pined away ere it could reach its goal. It was as if the enamoured sea was stretching out its arms to him. Who knows, perhaps through the clear water some green-eyed nymph, or a young sea-god with the tang of the sea in his hair, was peering amorously at the boy's red mouth. The people of the deep love the red warm blood of human kind. It is always the young that they lure to their watery haunts, never the shrivelled limbs that totter shivering to the grave.  Such fancies came to Ernest as he lay on the shore in his bathing attire, happy, thoughtless,--animal.  The sun and the sea seemed to him two lovers vying for his favor. The sudden change of environment had brought complete relaxation and had quieted his rebellious, assertive soul. He was no longer a solitary unit but one with wind and water, herb and beach and shell. Almost voluptuously his hand toyed with the hot sand that glided caressingly through his fingers and buried his breast and shoulder under its glittering burden.  A summer girl who passed lowered her eyes coquettishly. He watched her without stirring. Even to open his mouth or to smile would have seemed too much exertion.  Thus he lay for hours. When at length noon drew nigh, it cost him a great effort of will to shake off his drowsy mood and exchange his airy costume for the conventional habilaments of the dining-room.  He had taken lodgings in a fashionable hotel. An unusual stroke of good luck, hack-work that paid outrageously well, had made it possible for him to idle for a time without a thought of the unpleasant necessity of making money.  One single article to which he signed his name only with reluctance had brought to him more gear than a series of golden sonnets.  \"Surely,\" he thought, \"the social revolution ought to begin from above. What right has the bricklayer to grumble when he receives for a week's work almost more than I for a song?\"  Thus soliloquising, he reached the dining-room. The scene that unfolded itself before him was typical--the table over-loaded, the women over-dressed.  The luncheon was already in full course when he came. He mumbled an apology and seated himself on the only remaining chair next to a youth who reminded him of a well-dressed dummy. With slight weariness his eyes wandered in all directions for more congenial faces when they were arrested by a lady on the opposite side of the table. She was clad in a silk robe with curiously embroidered net-work that revealed a nervous and delicate throat. The rich effect of the net-work was relieved by the studied simplicity with which her heavy chestnut-colored hair was gathered in a single knot. Her face was turned away from him, but there was something in the carriage of her head that struck him as familiar. When at last she looked him in the face, the glass almost fell from his hand: it was Ethel Brandenbourg. She seemed to notice his embarrassment and smiled. When she opened her lips to speak, he knew by the haunting sweetness of the voice that he was not mistaken.  \"Tell me,\" she said wistfully, \"you have forgotten me? They all have.\"  He hastened to assure her that he had not forgotten her. He recollected now that he had first been introduced to her in Walkham's house some years ago, when a mere college boy, he had been privileged to attend one of that master's famous receptions. She had looked quite resolute and very happy then, not at all like the woman who had stared so strangely at Reginald in the Broadway restaurant.  He regarded this encounter as very fortunate. He knew so much of her personal history that it almost seemed to him as if they had been intimate for years. She, too, felt on familiar ground with him. Neither as much as whispered the name of Reginald Clarke. Yet it was he, and the knowledge of what he was to them, that linked their souls with a common bond.     XIV   It was the third day after their meeting. Hour by hour their intimacy had increased. Ethel was sitting in a large wicker-chair. She restlessly fingered her parasol, mechanically describing magic circles in the sand. Ernest lay at her feet. With his knees clasped between his hands, he gazed into her eyes.  \"Why are you trying so hard to make love to me?\" the woman asked, with the half-amused smile with which the Eve near thirty receives the homage of a boy. There is an element of insincerity in that smile, but it is a weapon of defence against love's artillery.  Sometimes, indeed, the pleading in the boy's eyes and the cry of the blood pierces the woman's smiling superiority. She listens, loves and loses.  Ethel Brandenbourg was listening, but the idea of love had not yet entered into her mind. Her interest in Ernest was due in part to his youth and the trembling in his voice when he spoke of love. But what probably attracted her most powerfully was the fact that he intimately knew the man who still held her woman's heart in the hollow of his hand. It was half in play, therefore, that she had asked him that question.  Why did he make love to her? He did not know. Perhaps it was the irresistible desire to be petted which young poets share with domesticated cats. But what should he"]]]
