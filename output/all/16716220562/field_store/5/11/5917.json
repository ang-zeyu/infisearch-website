He remained under ordinary circumstances invisible to mortal eyes, and he could conceal his identity even from the highest gods, but he occasionally manifested himself in human form. He borrowed in such case from Assyria the symbol of Assur, and the sculptors depict him with the upper part of his body rising above that winged disk which is carved in a hovering attitude on the pediments of Assyrian monuments or stelć.  [Illustration: 012b.jpg HYPOSTYLE OF HALL OF XERXES: DETAIL OF ENTABLATURE]  In later days he was portrayed under the form of a king of imposing stature and majestic mien, who revealed himself from time to time to the princes of Iran.*       * In a passage of Philo of Byblos the god is described as      having the head of a falcon or an eagle, perhaps by      confusion with one of the genii represented on the walls of      the palaces.  [Illustration: 013.jpg AN IRANIAN GENIUS IN FORM OF A WINGED BULL]       Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph.  He was named Ahurô-mazdâo or Ahura-mazdâ, the omniscient lord,* _Spento-mainyus_, the spirit of good, _Mainyus-spenishtô_** the most beneficent of spirits.       * _Ahura_ is derived from _Ahu_ = _Lord_: Mazdâo can be      analysed into the component parts, _maz = great_, and _dâo      = he who knows_. At first the two terms were      interchangeable, and even in the Gâthas the form Mazda Ahura      is employed much more often than the form Ahura Mazda. In      the Achsemenian inscriptions, Auramazdâ is only found as a      single word, except in an inscription of Xerxes, where the      two terms are in one passage separated and declined _Aurahya      mazdâha_. The form Ormuzd, Ormazd, usually employed by      Europeans, is that assumed by the name in modern Persian.       ** These two names are given to him more especially in      connection with his antagonism to Angrômainyus.  Himself uncreated, he is the creator of all things, but he is assisted in the administration of the universe by legions of beings, who are all subject to him.*       * Darius styles Ahura-mazdâ, _mathishta bagânâm_, the      greatest of the gods, and Xerxes invokes the protection of      Ahura-mazdâ along with that of the gods. The classical      writers also mention gods alongside of Ahura-mazdâ as      recognised not only among the Achćmenian Persians, but also      among the Parthians. Darmesteter considers that the earliest      Achćmenids worshipped Ahura-mazdâ alone, “placing the other      gods together in a subordinate and anonymous group: May      Ahura-mazdâ and the other gods protect me.”  [Illustration: 014.jpg AHURA-MAZDÂ BESTOWING THE TOKENS OF ROYALTY ON AN IRANIAN KING]       Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Dieulafoy.  The most powerful among his ministers were originally nature-gods, such as the sun, the moon, the earth, the winds, and the waters. The sunny plains of Persia and Media afforded abundant witnesses of their power, as did the snow-clad peaks, the deep gorges through which rushed roaring torrents, and the mountain ranges of Ararat or Taurus, where the force of the subterranean fires was manifested by so many startling exhibitions of spontaneous conflagration.* The same spiritualising tendency which had already considerably modified the essential concept of Ahura-mazdâ, affected also that of the inferior deities, and tended to tone down in them the grosser traits of their character. It had already placed at their head six genii of a superior order, six ever-active energies, who, after assisting their master at the creation of the universe, now presided under his guidance over the kingdoms and forces of nature.**       * All these inferior deities, heroes, and genii who presided      over Persia, the royal family, and the different parts of      the empire, are often mentioned in the most ancient      classical authors that have come down to us.       ** The six Amesha-spentas, with their several      characteristics, are enumerated in a passage of the _De      Iside_. This exposition of Persian doctrine is usually      attributed to Theopompus, from which we may deduce the      existence of a belief in the Amesha-spentas in the      Achsemenian period. J. Darmesteter affirms, on the contrary,      that “the author describes the Zoro-astrianism of his own      times (the second century A.D.), and quotes Theopompus for a      special doctrine, that of the periods of the world’s life.”       Although this last point is correct, the first part of      Darmesteter’s theory does not seem to me justified by      investigation. The whole passage of Plutarch is a well-      arranged composition of uniform style, which may be regarded      as an exposition of the system described by Theopompus,      probably in the eighth of his Philippics.  [Illustration: 016a.jpg THE MOON-GOD]  [Illustration: 016b.jpg GOD OF THE WIND]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a coin of King Kanishka,      published by Percy Gardner.  These benevolent and immortal beings--_Amesha-spentas_--were, in the order of precedence, Vohu-manô (good thought), Asha-vahista (perfect holiness), Khshathra-vairya (good government), Spenta-armaiti (meek piety), Haurvatât (health), Ameretât (immortality). Each of them had a special domain assigned to him in which to display his energy untrammelled: Vohu-manô had charge of cattle, Asha-vahista of fire, Khshathra-vairya of metals, Spenta-armaiti of the earth, Haurvatât and Ameretât of vegetation and of water. They were represented in human form, either masculine as Vohu-manô and Asha-vahista,* or feminine as Spenta-armaiti, the daughter and spouse of Ahura-mazdâ, who became the mother of the first man, Gayomaretan, and, through Gayomaretan, ancestress of the whole human race.       * The image of Asha-vahista is known to us from coins of the      Indo-Scythian kings of Bactriana. Vohu-manô is described as      a young man.  [Illustration: 017a.jpg ATAR THE GOD OF FIRE]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a coin of King Kanishka,      published by Percy Gardner.

Sometimes Ahura-mazdâ is himself included among the Amesha-spentas, thus bringing their number up to seven; sometimes his place is taken by a certain Sraôsha (obedience to the law), the first who offered sacrifice and recited the prayers of the ritual. Subordinate to these great spirits were the Yazatas, scattered by thousands over creation, presiding over the machinery of nature and maintaining it in working order. Most of them received no special names, but many exercised wide authority, and several were accredited by the people with an influence not less than that of the greater deities themselves. Such Were the regent of the stars--Tishtrya, the bull with golden horns, Sirius, the sparkling one; Mâo, the moon-god; the wind, Vâto; the atmosphere, Vayu, the strongest of the strong, the warrior with golden armour, who gathers the storm and hurls it against the demon; Atar, fire under its principal forms, divine fire, sacred fire, and earthly fire; Vere-thraghna, the author of war and giver of victory; Aurva-taspa, the son of the waters, the lightning born among the clouds; and lastly, the spirit of the dawn, the watchful Mithra, “who, first of the celestial Yazatas, soars above Mount Hara,* before the immortal sun with his swift steeds, who, first in golden splendour, passes over the beautiful mountains and casts his glance benign on the dwellings of the Aryans.” **       * Hara is Haroberezaiti, or Elburz, the mountain over which      the sun rises, “around which many a star revolves, where      there is neither night nor darkness, no wind of cold or      heat, no sickness leading to a thousand kinds of death, nor      infection caused by the Daôvas, and whose summit is never      reached by the clouds.”       ** This is the Mithra whose religion became so powerful in      Alexandrian and Roman times. His sphere of action is defined      in the Bundehesh.  Mithra was a charming youth of beautiful countenance, his head surrounded with a radiant halo. The nymph Anâhita was adored under the form of one of the incarnations of the Babylonian goddess Mylitta, a youthful and slender female, with well-developed breasts and broad hips, sometimes represented clothed in furs and sometimes nude.* Like the foreign goddess to whom she was assimilated, she was the dispenser of fertility and of love; the heroes of antiquity, and even Ahura-mazdâ himself, had vied with one another in their worship of her, and she had lavished her favours freely on all.**       * The popularity of these two deities was already well      established at the period we are dealing with, for Herodotus      mentions Mithra and confuses him with Anâhita.       ** Her name Ardvî-Sűra Anâhita seems to signify _the lofty      and immaculate power_.  The less important Yazatas were hardly to be distinguished from the innumerable multitude of Fravashis. The Fravasliis are the divine types of all intelligent beings. They were originally brought into being by Ahura-mazdâ as a distinct species from the human, but they had allowed themselves to be entangled in matter, and to be fettered in the bodies of men, in order to hasten the final destruction of the demons and the advent of the reign of good.*       * The legend of the descent of the Fravashis to dwell among      men is narrated in the Bundehesh.

The last six days of the year are dedicated to the Fravashis. They leave their heavenly abodes at this time to visit the spots which were their earthly dwelling-places, and they wander through the villages inquiring, “Who wishes to hire us? Who will offer us a sacrifice? Who will make us their own, welcome us, and receive us with plenteous offerings of food and raiment, with a prayer which bestows sanctity on him who offers it?” And if they find a man to hearken to their request, they bless him: “May his house be blessed with herds of oxen and troops of men, a swift horse and a strongly built chariot, a man who knoweth how to pray to God, a chieftain in the council who may ever offer us sacrifices with a hand filled with food and raiment, with a prayer which bestows sanctity on him who offers it!” Ahura-mazdâ created the universe, not by the work of his hands, but by the magic of his word, and he desired to create it entirely free from defects. His creation, however, can only exist by the free play and equilibrium of opposing forces, to which he gives activity: the incompatibility of tendency displayed by these forces, and their alternations of growth and decay, inspired the Iranians with the idea that they were the result of two contradictory principles, the one beneficent and good, the other adverse to everything emanating from the former.*       * Spiegel, who at first considered that the Iranian dualism      was derived from polytheism, and was a preliminary stage in      the development of monotheism, held afterwards that a rigid      monotheism had preceded this dualism. The classical writers,      who knew Zoroastrianism at the height of its glory, never      suggested that the two principles might be derived from a      superior principle, nor that they were subject to such a      principle. The Iranian books themselves nowhere definitely      affirm that there existed a single principle distinct from      the two opposing principles.  In opposition to the god of light, they necessarily formed the idea of a god of darkness, the god of the underworld, who presides over death, Angrô-mainyus. The two opposing principles reigned at first, each in his own domain, as rivals, but not as irreconcilable adversaries: they were considered as in fixed opposition to each other, and as having coexisted for ages without coming into actual conflict, separated as they were by the intervening void. As long as the principle of good was content to remain shut up inactive in his barren glory, the principle of evil slumbered unconscious in a darkness that knew no beginning; but when at last “the spirit who giveth increase”--Spentô-mainyus--determined to manifest himself, the first throes of his vivifying activity roused from inertia the spirit of destruction and of pain, Angrô-mainyus. The heaven was not yet in existence, nor the waters, nor the earth, nor ox, nor fire, nor man, nor demons, nor brute beasts, nor any living thing, when the evil spirit hurled himself upon the light to quench it for ever, but Ahura-mazdâ had already called forth the ministers of his will--Amęsha-spentas, Yazatas, Fravashis--and he recited the prayer of twenty-one words in which all the elements of morality are summed up, the Ahuna-vairya: “The will of the Lord is the rule of good. Let the gifts of Vohu-manô be bestowed on the works accomplished, at this moment, for Mazda. He makes Ahura to reign, he who protects the poor.”  The effect of this prayer was irresistible: “When Ahura had pronounced the first part of the formula, Zânak Mînoî, the spirit of destruction, bowed himself with terror; at the second part he fell upon his knees; and at the third and last he felt himself powerless to hurt the creatures of Ahura-mazdâ.” *       * Theopompus was already aware of this alternation of good      and bad periods. According to the tradition enshrined in the      first chapter of the Bundehesh, it was the result of a sort      of compact agreed upon at the beginning by Ahura-mazdâ and      Angrô-mainyus. Ahura-mazdâ, rearing to be overcome if he      entered upon the struggle immediately, but sure of final      victory if he could gain time, proposed to his adversary a      truce of nine thousand years, at the expiration of which the      battle should begin. As soon as the compact was made, Angrô-      mainyus realised that he had been tricked into taking a      false step, but it was not till after three thousand years      that he decided to break the truce and open the conflict.  The strife, kindled at the beginning of time between the two gods, has gone on ever since with alternations of success and defeat; each in turn has the victory for a regular period of three thousand years; but when these periods are ended, at the expiration of twelve thousand years, evil will be finally and for ever defeated. While awaiting this blessed fulness of time, as Spentô-mainyus shows himself in all that is good and beautiful, in light, virtue, and justice, so Angrô-mainyus is to be perceived in all that is hateful and ugly, in darkness, sin, and crime. Against the six Amesha-spentas he sets in array six spirits of equal power--Akem-manô, evil thought; Andra, the devouring fire, who introduces discontent and sin wherever he penetrates; Sauru, the flaming arrow of death, who inspires bloodthirsty tyrants, who incites men to theft and murder; Nâongaithya, arrogance and pride; Tauru, thirst; and Zairi, hunger.*       * The last five of these spirits are enumerated in the      _Vendidad_, and the first, Akem-manô, is there replaced by      Nasu, the chief spirit of evil.  To the Yazatas he opposed the Daęvas, who never cease to torment mankind, and so through all the ranks of nature he set over against each good and useful creation a counter-creation of rival tendency. “‘Like a fly he crept into’ and infected ‘the whole universe.’ He rendered the world as dark at full noonday as in the darkest night. He covered the soil with vermin, with his creatures of venomous bite and poisonous sting, with serpents, scorpions, and frogs, so that there was not a space as small as a needle’s point but swarmed with his vermin. He smote vegetation, and of a sudden the plants withered.... He attacked the flames, and mingled them with smoke and dimness. The planets, with their thousands of demons, dashed against the vault of heaven and waged war on the stars, and the universe became darkened like a space which the fire blackens with its smoke.” And the conflict grew ever keener over the world and over man, of whom the evil one was jealous, and whom he sought to humiliate.

The children of Angrô-mainyus disguised themselves under those monstrous forms in which the imagination of the Chaldćans had clothed the allies of Mummu-Tiamât, such as lions with bulls’ heads, and the wings and claws of eagles, which the Achćmenian king combats on behalf of his subjects, boldly thrusting them through with his short sword. Aęshma of the blood-stained lance, terrible in wrath, is the most trusted leader of these dread bands,* the chief of twenty other Daęvas of repulsive aspect--Astô-vîdhôtu, the demon of death, who would devote to destruction the estimable Fravashis;** Apaosha, the enemy of Tishtrya the wicked black horse, the bringer of drought, who interferes with the distribution of the fertilising waters; and Bűiti, who essayed to kill Zoroaster at his birth.***       * The name Aęshma means _anger_. He is the Asmodeus, Aęshmo-      daevô, of Rabbinic legends.       ** The name of this demon signifies _He who separates the      bones_.       *** The Greater Bundehesh connects the demon Bűiti with the      Indian Buddha, and J. Darmestefer seems inclined to accept      this interpretation. In this case we must either admit that      the demon Bűiti is of relatively late origin, or that he      has, in the legend of Zoroaster, taken the place of a demon      whose name resembled his own closely enough to admit of the      assimilation.  The female demons, the Bruges, the Incubi (Yâtus), the Succubi (Pairîka), the Peris of our fairy tales, mingled familiarly with mankind before the time of the prophet, and contracted with them fruitful alliances, but Zoroaster broke up their ranks, and prohibited them from becoming incarnate in any form but that of beasts; their hatred, however, is still unquenched, and their power will only be effectually overthrown at the consummation of time. It is a matter of uncertainty whether the Medes already admitted the possibility of a fresh revelation, preparing the latest generations of mankind for the advent of the reign of good. The traditions enshrined in the sacred books of Iran announce the coming of three prophets, sons of Zoroaster --Ukhshyatereta, Ukhshyatnemô, and Saoshyant* --who shall bring about universal salvation.       * The legend ran that they had been conceived in the waters      of the lake Kansu. The name Saoshyant signifies _the useful      one, the saviour_; Ukshyate-reta, _he who malces the good      increase_; Ukshyatnemô, _he who makes prayer increase_.  Saoshyant, assisted by fifteen men and fifteen pure women, who have already lived on earth, and are awaiting their final destiny in a magic slumber, shall offer the final sacrifice, the virtue of which shall bring about the resurrection of the dead. “The sovereign light shall accompany him and his friends, when he shall revivify the world and ransom it from old age and death, from"]]]
