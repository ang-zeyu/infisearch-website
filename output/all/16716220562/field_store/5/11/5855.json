The permanent viaduct girders were put in place from east to west across the avenue, and the girders \"C\" were supported on the deck of the permanent viaduct approximately under the west elevated railway columns before the west portion of the avenue was excavated, the central portion of the south abutment having been constructed before the west portion. This procedure was adopted only at the north girders \"C\" at elevated railway column No. 488, the south set of girders \"C\" being on the rock immediately south of the south abutment.

May 25, 09.]  It was made a practice all through the work to transfer the weight of the structures very positively from one support to another by lifting them bodily by jacks, and putting in filler pieces before releasing the jacks, not trusting to wedging to transfer the loads. In fact, apart from the boxing-in of the surface railway concrete, no wedges whatever were used. This appears to have been a decided advantage, for, with the constant pounding of trains on the elevated railway and the jarring due to heavy trucks on the pavement blocks, it is very likely that wedging would have become loosened and displaced, whereas, with blocking, there was little or no tendency toward displacement due to vibration. Although the vibration of the structure, when a long length was supported on girders \"C\" resting on the permanent viaduct girders on the sides of the avenue, appeared to be considerable, not only vertically but transversely, very careful observation showed that the sag in the girder \"C\" due a live load of three elevated railway trains, one surface railway car, and one heavy truck, amounted to 1/8 in. The sideway vibration did not amount to more than 1/32 in. on either side of the normal position. More vibration was caused by heavy trucks and wagons going over the stone pavement than by the elevated railway trains or surface cars.  No blasting was done near the supports of the elevated railway structure while trains were passing over it, and occasionally trains were stopped during a heavy or uncertain blast. A watchman on the surface, day and night, and at first one and later two flagmen on the elevated railway structure, were on duty at all times, reporting to the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, by whom they were employed. Log mats and timber protection for the girders and the columns of the permanent viaduct were used, as shown by Figs. 1 and 4, Plate XLIX, during the excavation of the rock core, and timber was also used to protect the face of the completed portions of the concrete abutments.  In excavating the sides of the avenue, the rock broke better on the east than on the west side, where large seams developed and some slides occurred.  _Abutments._--As shown on Fig. 7, the face of the north abutment has a batter of 2 in. to the foot, and the face of the south abutment has a variable batter, the base being on a grade and the bridge seat being level, and both maintaining a uniform distance from the center of the Terminal Yard. The back walls of the abutments were not built until the steel had been put in place.  No attempt was made to water-proof these abutments, but, in the rear of the wall, open spaces were left, about 6 ft. from center to center, which were connected with drain pipes at the base of and extending through the wall, for the purpose of carrying off any water that might develop in the rock. These drains were formed by building wooden boxes with the side toward the rock open and the joints in the boxes and against the rock plastered with mortar in advance of the wall. A hose was used to run water through these drains during the placing of the concrete, for the purpose of washing out any grout which might run into them. Each box was washed out at frequent intervals, and there was no clogging of the drains whatever. This method of keeping the drains open was adopted and used successfully for the entire work. The abutments were built of concrete, and the mixture was 1 part of cement, 3 parts of sand, and 6 parts of broken stone.  The concrete was mixed in a No. 3 Ransome mixer, and was placed very wet. No facing mixture or facing diaphragms were used, but the stone was spaded away from the face of the wall as the concrete was laid. Chutes were used inside the form, if the concrete had to drop some distance. Work was continued day and night, without any intermission, from the time of commencement to the time of completion of each section.  The face of the concrete wall was rubbed and finished in a manner similar to that used on the walls between Ninth and Tenth Avenues, as described later.  Fig. 2, Plate LII, shows the east and central portions of the south abutment, completed and carrying the permanent viaduct, and the excavation completed for the west portion.   WORK BETWEEN NINTH AND TENTH AVENUES.  _General Description._--The work involved the excavation of about 5.4 acres, between the west house line of Ninth Avenue and the east house line of Tenth Avenue, to an average depth of about 50 ft., the construction of a stone masonry portal at Tenth Avenue leading to the River Tunnels, and the construction around the site of the concrete retaining and face walls.  The following estimated quantities appear in the contract: Excavation of rock in trenches, 3,400 cu. yd.; excavation of rock in pit, 377,000 cu. yd.; excavation of all materials except rock in trenches, 6,500 cu. yd.; excavation of all materials except rock in pit, 34,000 cu. yd.; concrete, 1:3:6, in retaining walls, 4,580 cu. yd.; concrete, 1:3:6, in face walls, 7,460 cu. yd.; concrete, 1:2:3, with 3/4-in. stone, in face walls, 4,100 cu. yd.; stone masonry in portal, 247 cu. yd., etc., etc.  [Illustration: Fig. 7. (Full page image)  NINTH AVE. ABUTMENTS & KEY PLAN]  As previously stated, the contract price included the placing of all excavated material on scows at Pier 62, North River. Prior to this contract this pier had been used by the New York Contracting Company-Pennsylvania Terminal, for the disposal of excavated material from east of Ninth Avenue. In order to get the material to the pier, the contractor had excavated a cut under Ninth Avenue which came to the grade of 32d Street about midway between Ninth and Tenth Avenues, and a trestle was constructed from this point over Tenth Avenue and thence to the pier. Fig. 2, Plate XLVII, shows the east end of this cut, and Fig. 1, Plate L, shows the trestle, looking east from Tenth Avenue.  A 30-ton steam shovel was brought to the south side of the work, and commenced operating on July 9th, 1906. After working there about a month, the earth had been practically stripped off the rock, and the shovel was moved over to the north side where it excavated both earth and rock until August 10th, 1907.  At three points south of 32d Street and at one point north of 32d Street near Tenth Avenue, cuts were made in the rock to sub-grade, and from these cuts, together with the cuts on the west side of Ninth Avenue, all widening out was done and the excavation was completed. Fig. 1, Plate L, shows the excavation of the three cuts on the south side of 32d Street, the steam shovel operating on the north side of that street, and the material-disposal tracks and trestle. Fig. 3, Plate LII, shows the cuts joined up and the excavation along the south side practically completed.  On the north side of the work, between Stations 182 + 90 and 183 + 65, the rock was low, and provision had to be made for maintaining the yards to the north of the site. Therefore a rubble-masonry retaining wall was built, with the face about 2 ft. north of the face of the proposed concrete wall which was to be put in later. On the same side of the work, between Stations 188 + 24 and 188 + 46, the rock was exceedingly poor, and as a small frame house on the adjoining lot was considered to be in an unsafe condition, a rubble masonry retaining wall was built. As the building adjoining the south side of the work at Tenth Avenue was on an earth foundation, it was necessary to underpin it before the excavation could be done. The building was supported on needles, and rubble masonry was put in from the bottom of the old foundation to the rock. The foundation of 413 West 31st Street, immediately west of the Express Building site, was of very poor masonry, and it was necessary to rebuild it prior to taking out the adjoining excavation.

View from Tenth Avenue looking East, showing progress of concrete walls. Aug. 7, 09.]  Along the north side, between Stations 186 + 50 and 187 + 50, the walls supporting the adjoining back yards were of poor quality and had to be renewed by the contractor before excavation could be done.  The excavated material was loaded by derricks on cars at the top of the excavation, these cars being on tracks having a direct connection with the disposal trestle, as shown by Fig. 1, Plate L. As soon as it could be done, derricks were placed at the bottom of the excavation; tracks were then laid out there, and the excavated material was loaded on cars at the bottom and hoisted by derricks to cars on the disposal trestle. A locomotive was lowered to the bottom of the excavation on August 25th, 1907, and a derrick started operating at the bottom on August 27th, 1907. The commencement of this work by derricks at the bottom is shown by Fig. 3, Plate LII. In general, the disposal tracks were maintained about on the center line of 31st Street until the excavation had been carried as close to them as possible, and on October 16th, 1907, they were shifted to the extreme north side of the work, as shown by Fig. 2, Plate L. A portion of the old trestle was left in place near Tenth Avenue, a derrick was erected thereon, and the tracks were used for cars to receive the excavated material hoisted from sub-grade. The disposal trestle was maintained in this position until such time as it would interfere with the excavation, and then the tracks were abandoned. This was done on November 11th, 1908. Fig. 3, Plate L, shows the finishing of the excavation on the north side of the work. On August 30th, 1908, a cut was made under Ninth Avenue at sub-grade, and cars could then be run from Seventh to Tenth Avenue at sub-grade. On October 24th, 1908, the connection with the disposal trestle east of Ninth Avenue was abandoned, and all excavated material was hoisted from sub-grade at Tenth Avenue by derricks.  As previously stated, the contractor was required to make complete disposal of all excavated material after January 1st, 1909, but was allowed the use of the pier until January 20th, 1909, after which date the materials were hoisted by derricks at Tenth Avenue, loaded on 2-horse trucks, and transported to the 30th Street pier, North River, where it was loaded on scows by two electric derricks. A considerable amount of the rock excavation was broken up and used for back-fill.  _Earth Excavation._--Practically all the earth excavation, amounting to about 57,000 cu, yd., was done with steam shovels. The average quantity of earth excavated by a steam shovel per 10-hour shift was 180 cu. yd. This material was loaded on side-dump cars and taken to the disposal pier where it was dumped through chutes to the decks of scows. Inasmuch as the quantity of earth excavation was small, as compared with the rock, the earth was used principally for the first layer on the scows for padding, so that small stones might be dumped through the chutes without injuring the decks.  _Rock Excavation._--As previously stated, the rock broke better on the south than on the north side, where there were several slides, and considerable excavation had to be taken out beyond the neat line required in the specifications. The worst slide occurred at midnight on July 3d, 1909, at about Station 188 + 50. The last blast, to complete the excavation to sub-grade at this point, had been fired in the afternoon of the same day, and the mucking was practically completed. Great care had been taken in excavating near this point, as it was evident that the rock was not of a very stable character, but, when the excavation had been completed, it was thought that the rock remaining in place would stand. The volume of material brought down by this slide amounted to about 200 cu. yd. The rock on the south side broke very well, and there were no slides of any consequence.  The drill holes were laid out by the blaster, and the general method of drilling for different classes of work was as follows: In breaking down, the holes were started about 8 ft. apart, on a slight batter, so that at the bottom they would be considerably less than 8 ft. apart. They were drilled about 10 ft. deep, and blasting logs were used, as it was necessary to load quite heavily in order to lift the material and start the cut. After the cut had been made, side holes were shot to widen out sufficiently to start another cut.  After a side cut about 20 ft. deep had been made, the side holes were drilled 20 ft. deep, and the holes were loaded and tamped for the full 20-ft. cut. Under the terms of the specifications, the contractor was required to complete the excavation on the sides by drilling broaching holes.  The maximum length of drill steel was about 20 ft., and, where the excavation plane of broaching was more than 20 ft. in depth, the contractor was permitted to start the holes back of the broaching line, in order to allow for setting up the drills on the second lift. A distance of about 8 in. was usually allowed for setting up a drill. The broaching line was painted on the surface of the rock in advance of the drilling, and the batter of the drill was tested with a specially designed hand-level in which the bubble came to a central position when the face of the level was on the required batter. Holes were also drilled in front of this broaching line, and, when the excavation had been taken out to within about 6 ft. in front of it, the holes immediately in front were loaded, and also about every third one of the broaching holes, and, unless the rock was very bad, it usually broke sharply at the broaching line. Occasionally, the broaching holes which were not loaded were filled with sand, which gave rather better results than leaving them open.  In the steam-shovel work on the east side of Ninth Avenue, spring holes were used. They were formed by drilling a 20-ft. hole and exploding at the bottom of it, without tamping, two or three sticks of dynamite, and repeating this process with heavier charges until there had been formed at the bottom of the hole a large cavity which would hold from 100 to 200 lb. of dynamite. Face holes and breast holes were also drilled, and it was possible by this method to drill and break up a cut 20 ft. deep and 15 ft. thick. The only place where spring holes were used on this work was on the east side of Ninth Avenue where the heavy cutting was sometimes extended beyond the east house line.  From the best records obtainable, the average progress in drilling was about 33 lin. ft. per 8-hour shift. The average number of cubic yards of excavation per drill shift was 13.9, and the average amount of drilling per cubic yard of excavation was 2.4 ft.; this covered more than 27,000 drill shifts.  The dynamite was practically all 60%, and the average excavation per pound of dynamite was 2.2 cu. yd. The contractor employed an inspector of batteries and fuses, who, using an instrument for that purpose, tested the wiring of each blast prior to firing, in order to discover any short circuits, and thus prevent the danger of leaving unexploded dynamite in the holes.  The average quantity of excavation per derrick shift of 10 hours, covering 7,400 shifts, 87% of the excavation being rock, was 50 cu. yd., and the average force per shift, including only foreman and laborers, was 13 men. It was found that a derrick operating at the top of a 20-ft. cut would handle about 40 cu. yd. per shift, whereas, if operating at the bottom of the cut, it would handle about 60 cu. yd. per shift. The elevator derricks at Tenth Avenue were very efficient, and each could take care of the material from four derricks at the bottom, hoisting 250 cu. yd. per shift a height of 60 ft.  _Concrete Retaining and Face Walls._--It was essential to have the greatest space possible at the bottom of the excavation, and, inasmuch as the yard was to be left open, it was necessary to provide some facing for the rock on the sides in order to prevent disintegration, due to exposure, and give a finished appearance to the work. Above the rock surface a retaining wall of gravity section was designed, the top being slightly higher than the yards of the adjoining properties. The face wall was designed to be as thin as possible, in order to allow the maximum space for tracks.  The excavation, therefore, was laid out so that the back of the retaining wall would not encroach on the adjoining property, but would practically coincide with the property line at positions of maximum depth.  The batter on the face of the wall was 2 in. per ft., and a bridge seat 3-1/2 ft. wide was formed at an elevation of 22 ft., minimum clearance, above the top of the rail. This bridge seat was made level. The maximum height of the south wall is 49 ft., and of the north wall 65 ft.  The face walls were classed as \"Upper Face Walls,\" extending from the base of the retaining wall to the bridge seat, and as \"Lower Face Walls,\" extending from the bridge seat to the base of the wall. The general design is shown on Fig. 8.  In considering the design of the face wall it was felt that, the wall being so thin, ample provision should be made to prevent any accumulation of water and consequent pressure back of the wall; therefore, no attempt was made to water-proof it, but provision was made to carry off any water which might appear in the rock. Box drains, 2 ft. wide and 6 ft. from center to center, were placed against the rock, so that, there being but 4 ft. between the drains, and the wall having a minimum thickness of 2 ft., any water in the rock would not have to go more than 2 ft. to reach a drain, and would probably pass along the face of the rock to a drain rather than through 2 ft. of concrete.
