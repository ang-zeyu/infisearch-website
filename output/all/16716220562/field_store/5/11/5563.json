Half the parish has some _miff_ against the other half. I believe there never was such a place for little quarrels since the Dutch took Holland. There's a tempest in every old woman's teapot. Widow Seedyweedy won't let her daughters come, because, as she says, you are a temperance man, and said, at the last meeting, that rum made many a widow in Soitgoes, and sent three quarters of the paupers to the almshouse. She declared, the next day, that you were 'personal, and injured her feelings; and 'twas all because you was rich and she was a poor lone widow, with nothing but her God to trust in.'\"  \"Oh, dear me,\" said Uncle Nathan, \"it is a queer world,--a queer world; but after all it's the best we've got. Let us try to make it better still.\"  Aunt Kindly could not sleep much all night for thinking over the details of the plan. Before morning it all lay clear in her mind. Monday afternoon she went round to talk with the neighbors and get all things ready. Most of them liked it; but some thought it was \"queer,\" and wondered \"what our pious fathers would think of keeping Christmas in New England.\" A few had \"religious scruples,\" and would do nothing about it. The head of the Know-nothing lodge said it was \"a Furrin custom, and I want none o' them things; but Ameriky must be ruled by 'Mericans; and we'll have no Disserlutions of the Union, and no Popish ceremonies like a Christmas Tree. If you begin so, you'll have the Pope here next, and the fulfilment of the seventeenth chapter of Revelations.\"  Hon. Jeduthan Stovepipe also opposed it. He was a rich hatter from Boston, and a \"great Democrat;\" who, as he said, had lately \"purchased grounds in Soitgoes, intending to establish a family.\" He \"would not like to have Cinderella Jane and Edith Zuleima mix themselves up with widow Wheeler's children,--whose father was killed on the railroad five or six years before,--for their mother takes in washing. No, Sir,\" said he; \"it will not do. You have no daughters to marry, no sons to provide for. It will do well enough for you to talk about 'equality,' about 'meeting the whole neighborhood,' and that sort of thing; but I intend to establish a family; and I set my face against all promiscuous assemblages of different classes of society. It is bad enough on Sundays, when each man can sit buttoned up in his own pew; but a festival for all sorts and conditions of children,--its is contrary to the genius of our republican institutions.\" His wife thought quite differently; but the poor thing did not dare say her soul was her own in his presence. Aunt Kindly went off with rather a heavy heart, remembering that Jeduthan was the son of a man sent to the State Prison for horse stealing, and born in the almshouse at Bankton Four Corners, and had been bound out as apprentice by the selectmen of the town.  At the next house, Miss Robinson liked it; but hoped she \"would not ask that family o'niggers,--that would make it so vulgar;\" and she took a large pinch of Scotch snuff, and waddled off to finish her ironing. Mrs. Deacon Jackson--she was a second wife, with no children--hoped that \"Sally Bright would not be asked, because her father was in the State Prison for passing counterfeit money; and the example would be bad, not friendly to law and order.\" But as Aunt Kindly went out, she met the old Deacon himself,--one of those dear, good, kind souls, who were born to be deacons of the Christian religion, looking like one of the eight beatitudes; and as you stopped to consider which of that holy family he most resembled, you found he looked like all of them. \"Well!\" said he, \"now ma'am, I like that. That will be a _Christian_ Christmas,--not a Heathen Christmas. Of course you'll ask all the children of 'respectable people;' but I want the _poor ones_, too. Don't let anybody frighten you from asking Sip Tidy's children. I don't know that I like colored folks particularly, but I think God does, or he would not have colored 'em, you know. Then do let us have all of Jo Bright's little ones. When I get into the State Prison, I hope somebody'll look after my family. I know _you_ will. I don't mean to go there; but who knows? 'If everybody had his deserts, who would escape a flogging?' as the old saying is. Here's five dollars towards expenses; and if that ain't enough, I'll make it ten. Elizabeth will help you make the cake, &c. You shall have as many eggs as you want. Hens hain't laid well since Thanksgiving; now they do nothing else.\"  Captain Weldon let one iron cool on the anvil, and his bellows sigh out its last breath in the fire and burn the other iron, while he talked with Aunt Kindly about it. The Captain was a widower, about fifty years old, with his house full of sons and daughters. He liked it. Patty, his oldest daughter, could help. There were two barrels of apples, three or four dollars in money, and more if need be. \"That is what I call the democracy of Christianity,\" said the good man. \"I shall see half the people in the village; they'll be in here to get their horses corked before the time comes, and I'll help the thing along a little. I'll bring the old folks, and we'll sing some of the old tunes; all of us will have a real old-fashioned good time.\" Almira, his daughter, about eighteen years old, ran out to talk with Kindly, and offered to do all sorts of work, if she would only tell her what. \"Perhaps Edward will come, too,\" said Kindly. \"Do you want him?\" asked Almira. \"Oh, certainly; want all the LOVERS,\" replied she,--not looking to see how her face kindled, like a handsome morning in May.  One sour old man, who lived off the road, did not like it. 'Twas a Popish custom; and said, \"I always fast on Christmas.\" His family knew _they_ did, and many a day besides; for he was so covetous that he grudged the water which turned his own mill.  Mr. Toombs, a young minister, who had been settled six or seven years, and loved the commandments of religion much better than the creed of theology, entered into it at once, and promised to come, and not wear his white cravat. His wife, Sally Wilkins that used to be, took to it with all her might.  So all things were made ready. Farmers sent in apples and boiled chestnuts; and there were pies, and cookies, and all manner of creature comforts. The German who worked for the cabinet-maker decorated the hall, just as he had done in Wittenberg often before; for he was an exile from the town where Martin Luther sleeps, and his Katherine, under the same slab. There were branches of Holly with their red berries, Wintergreen and Pine boughs, and Hemlock and Laurel, and such other handsome things as New England can afford even in winter. Besides, Captain Weldon brought a great Orange-tree, which he and Susan had planted the day after their marriage, nearly thirty years before. \"Like Christmas itself,\" as he said,--\"it is a history and a prophecy; full of fruit and flowers, both.\" Roses, and Geraniums, and Chrysanthemums, and Oleanders were there, adding to the beauty.  All the children in the village were there. Sally Bright wore the medal she won the last quarter at the Union School. Sip Tidy's six children were there; and all the girls and boys from the poor-house. The Widow Wheeler and her children thought no more of the railroad accident. Captain Weldon, Deacon Jackson and his wife, and the Minister were there; all the Selectmen, and the Town Clerk, and the Schoolmasters and Schoolma'ams, and the Know-nothing Representative from the South Parish; great, broad-shouldered farmers came in, with Baldwin apples in their cheeks as well as in their cellars at home, and their trim tidy wives. Eight or ten Irish children came also,--Bridget, Rosanna, Patrick, and Michael, and Mr. And Mrs. O'Brien themselves. Aunt Kindly had her piano there, and played and sung.  Didn't they all have a good time? Old Joe Roe, the black fiddler, from Beaver Brook, Mill Village, was over there; and how he did play! how they did dance! Commonly, as the young folks said, he could play only one tune, \"Joe Roe and I;\" for it is true that his sleepy violin did always seem to whine out, \"_Joe Roe and I, Joe Roe and I, Joe Roe and I_.\" But now the old fiddle was wide awake. He cut capers on it; and made it laugh, and cry, and whistle, and snort, and scream. He held it close to his ear, and rolled up the whites of his eyes, and laughed a great, loud, rollicking laugh; and he made his fiddle laugh, too, right out.  The young people had their games. Boston, Puss in the Corner, Stir you must, Hunt the Squirrel round the Woods, Blind Man's Buff, and Jerusalem. Mr. Atkins, who built the hall, and was a strict Orthodox man a Know-nothing, got them to play \"Break the Pope's neck,\" which made a deal of fun. The oldest people sung some of the old New England tunes, in the old New England way. How well they went off! in particular,       \"How beauteous are their feet       Who stand on Zion's Hill;       And bring salvation on their tongues,       And words of peace reveal.\"  But the great triumph of all was the Christmas Tree. How big it was! a large stout Spruce in the upper part of the hall. It bore a gift for every child in the town. Two little girls had the whooping cough, and could not come out; but there were two playthings for them also, given to their brothers to be taken home. St. Nicolas--it was Almira Weldon's lover--distributed the gifts.  Squire Stovepipe came in late, without any of the \"family\" that he was so busy in \"establishing,\" but was so cold that it took him a good while to warm up to the general temperature of the meeting. But he did at length; and talked with the Widow Wheeler, and saw all her well-managed children, and felt ashamed of his meanness only ten days before. Deacon Willberate saw his son Ned dancing with Squire Allen's rosy daughter, Matilda,--for the young people cared more for each other than for all the allusions to slavery in all the prayers and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17006"],["title","Two Christmas Celebrations (#4)"],["body","too, of the whole world,--and it so reminded him of the time when he also danced with _his_ Matilda,--not openly at Christmas celebrations, but by stealth,--that he went straight up to his neighbor; \"Squire Allen,\" said he, \"give me your hand. New Year's is a good day to square just accounts; Christmas is not a bad time to settle needles quarrels. I suppose you and I, both of us, may be wrong. I know I have been for one. Let by-gones be by-gones.\" \"Exactly so,\" said the Squire. \"I am sorry, for my part. Let us wipe out the old score, and chalk up nothing for the future but good feelings. If a prayer parted, perhaps a benediction will unite us; for Katie and Ned look as if they meant we should be more than mere neighbors. Let us begin by becoming friends.\"  Colonel Stone took his youngest daughter, who had a club-foot, up to the Christmas tree for her present, and there met face to face with his enemy's oldest girl, who was just taking the gift for her youngest brother, Robert,--holding him up in her bare arms that he might reach it himself. But she could not raise him quite high enough, and so the Colonel lifted up the little fellow till he clutched the prize; and when he set him down, his hands full of sugar-cake, asked him, \"Whose bright little five-year-old is this? What is your name, blue eyes?\" \"Bobbie Nilkinson,\" was the answer. It went right to the Colonel's heart. \"It is Christmas,\" said he; \"and the dear Jesus himself said, 'Suffer little children to come unto me.' Well, well, he said something to us old folks, too: 'If thy brother trespass against thee,' &c., and 'If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.'\" He walked about awhile, thinking, and then found his neighbor. \"Mr. Wilkinson,\" said he, \"it is bad enough that you and I should quarrel in law, but let us be friends in the gospel. As I looked at your little boy, and held him up in my arms, and found out whose son he was, I felt ashamed that I had ever quarreled with his father. Here is my hand, if you think fit to take it.\" \"With all my heart,\" said Wilkinson. \"I fear I was more to blame than you. But we can't help the past; let us make amends for the future. I hope we shall have many a merry Christmas together in this world and the next. Perhaps Uncle Nathan can settle our land-quarrel better than any jury in Worcester county.\"  Mr. Smith, the Know-nothing representative, was struck with the bright face of one of the little girls who wore a school-medal, and asked her name. \"Bridget O'Brien, your honor,\" was the answer. \"Well, well,\" said he, \"I guess Uncle Nathan is half right; 'it's all prejudice.' I don't like the Irish, _politically_. But after all, the Pope will have to make a pretty long arm to reach round Aunt Kindly, and clear through the Union School-house and spoil Miss Bridget,--a pretty long arm to do all that.\"  So it went on all round the room. \"That is what I call the Christian Sacrament,\" said Deacon Jackson to Captain Weldon. \"Ah, yes,\" replied the blacksmith; \"it is a feast of love. Look there; Colonel Stearns and John Wilkinson have not spoken for years. Now it is all made up. Both have forgotten that little strip of Beaver-gray meadow, which has cost them so much money and hard words and in itself is not worth the lawyer's fees.\"  How the children played! how they all did dance! And of the whole sportive company not one footed the measure so neat as little Hattie Tidy, the black man's daughter. \"What a shame to enslave a race of such persons,\" said Mr. Stovepipe. \"Yet I went in for the Fugitive Slave Bill, and was one of Marshal Tukey's 'fifteen hundred gentlemen of property and standing.' My God forgive me!\" \"Amen,\" said Mr. Broadside, a great, stout, robust farmer; \"I stood by till the Nebraska Bill put slavery into Kansas, then I went right square over to the anti-slavery side. I shall stick there forever. Dr Lord may try and excuse slavery just as much as he likes. I know what all that means. He don't catch old birds with chaff.\"  Uncle Nathan went about the room talking with the men and women; they all knew him, and felt well acquainted with such a good-natured face; while Aunt Kindly, with the nicer tact of a good woman, introduced the right persons to each other, and so promoted happiness among those too awkward to obtain it alone or unhelped. Besides this, she took special care of the boys and girls from the poor-house.  What an appetite the little folks had for the good things! How the old ones helped them dispose of these creature comforts! while such as were half way between, were too busy with other matters to think much of the eatables. Solomon Jenkins and Katie Edmunds had had a falling out. He was the miller at Stony Brook; but the \"course of true love never did run smooth\" with him; he could not coax Katie's to brook into his stream; it would turn off some other way. But that night Katie herself broke down the hindrance, and the two little brooks became one great stream of love, and flowed on together, inseparable; now dimpling, deepening, and whirling away full of beauty towards the great ocean of eternity.  Uncle Nathan and Aunt Kindly, how happy they were, seeing the joy of all the company! they looked like two new Redeemers,--which indeed they were. The minister said,--\"Well, I have been preaching charity and forgiveness and a cheerful happiness all my life, now I see signs of the 'good time coming.' There's forgiveness of injuries,\" pointing to Colonel Stearns and Mr. Wilkinson; \"old enemies reconciled. All my sermons don't seem to accomplish so much as your Christmas Festival, Mr. Robinson,\" said he, addressing Uncle Nathan. \"We only watered the ground,\" said Aunt Kindly, \"where the seed was long since sown by other hands; only it does seem to come up abundantly, and all at once.\" Then the minister told the people a new Christmas story; and before they went home they all joined together and sung this hymn to the good tune of Old Hundred:       \"Jesus shall reign where'er the sun      Does his successive journeys run;      His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,      Till moons shall wax and wane no more.       Blessings abound where'er he reigns;      The prisoner leaps to loose his chains;      The weary find eternal rest,      And all the sons of want are bless'd.\""]]]
