As noted above, we can find self-corresponding points arbitrarily close to _P_, and it appears, then, that we can take a point _D_ as close to _P_ as we wish, and yet the distance between the corresponding points _D’_ and _P’_ approaches _d_ as a limit, and not zero, which contradicts the postulate of continuity.     *50.*  It follows also that two projective pencils which have the same center may have no more than two self-corresponding rays, unless the pencils are identical. For if we cut across them by a line, we obtain two projective point-rows superposed on the same straight line, which may have no more than two self-corresponding points. The same considerations apply to two projective axial pencils which have the same axis.     *51. Projective point-rows having a self-corresponding point in common.* Consider now two projective point-rows lying on different lines in the same plane. Their common point may or may not be a self-corresponding point. If the two point-rows are perspectively related, then their common point is evidently a self-corresponding point. The converse is also true, and we have the very important theorem:     *52.*  _If in two protective point-rows, the point of intersection corresponds to itself, then the point-rows are in perspective position._                                 [Figure 11]                                   FIG. 11   Let the two point-rows be _u_ and _u’_ (Fig. 11). Let _A_ and _A’_, _B_ and _B’_, be corresponding points, and let also the point _M_ of intersection of _u_ and _u’_ correspond to itself. Let _AA’_ and _BB’_ meet in the point _S_. Take _S_ as the center of two pencils, one perspective to _u_ and the other perspective to _u’_. In these two pencils _SA_ coincides with its corresponding ray _SA’_, _SB_ with its corresponding ray _SB’_, and _SM_ with its corresponding ray _SM’_. The two pencils are thus identical, by the preceding theorem, and any ray _SD_ must coincide with its corresponding ray _SD’_. Corresponding points of _u_ and _u’_, therefore, all lie on lines through the point _S_.     *53.*  An entirely similar discussion shows that  _If in two projective pencils the line joining their centers is a self-corresponding ray, then the two pencils are perspectively related._     *54.*  A similar theorem may be stated for two axial pencils of which the axes intersect. Very frequent use will be made of these fundamental theorems.     *55. Point-row of the second order.*  The question naturally arises, What is the locus of points of intersection of corresponding rays of two projective pencils which are not in perspective position? This locus, which will be discussed in detail in subsequent chapters, is easily seen to have at most two points in common with any line in the plane, and on account of this fundamental property will be called a _point-row of the second order_. For any line _u_ in the plane of the two pencils will be cut by them in two projective point-rows which have at most two self-corresponding points. Such a self-corresponding point is clearly a point of intersection of corresponding rays of the two pencils.     *56.*  This locus degenerates in the case of two perspective pencils to a pair of straight lines, one of which is the axis of perspectivity and the other the common ray, any point of which may be considered as the point of intersection of corresponding rays of the two pencils.     *57. Pencils of rays of the second order.*  Similar investigations may be made concerning the system of lines joining corresponding points of two projective point-rows. If we project the point-rows to any point in the plane, we obtain two projective pencils having the same center. At most two pairs of self-corresponding rays may present themselves. Such a ray is clearly a line joining two corresponding points in the two point-rows. The result may be stated as follows: _The system of rays joining corresponding points in two protective point-rows has at most two rays in common with any pencil in the plane._ For that reason the system of rays is called _a pencil of rays of the second order._     *58.*  In the case of two perspective point-rows this system of rays degenerates into two pencils of rays of the first order, one of which has its center at the center of perspectivity of the two point-rows, and the other at the intersection of the two point-rows, any ray through which may be considered as joining two corresponding points of the two point-rows.     *59. Cone of the second order.*  The corresponding theorems in space may easily be obtained by joining the points and lines considered in the plane theorems to a point _S_ in space. Two projective pencils give rise to two projective axial pencils with axes intersecting. Corresponding planes meet in lines which all pass through _S_ and through the points on a point-row of the second order generated by the two pencils of rays. They are thus generating lines of a _cone of the second order_, or _quadric cone_, so called because every plane in space not passing through _S_ cuts it in a point-row of the second order, and every line also cuts it in at most two points. If, again, we project two point-rows to a point _S_ in space, we obtain two pencils of rays with a common center but lying in different planes. Corresponding lines of these pencils determine planes which are the projections to _S_ of the lines which join the corresponding points of the two point-rows. At most two such planes may pass through any ray through _S_. It is called _a pencil of planes of the second order_.     PROBLEMS   *1. * A man _A_ moves along a straight road _u_, and another man _B_ moves along the same road and walks so as always to keep sight of _A_ in a small mirror _M_ at the side of the road. How many times will they come together, _A_ moving always in the same direction along the road?  2. How many times would the two men in the first problem see each other in two mirrors _M_ and _N_ as they walk along the road as before? (The planes of the two mirrors are not necessarily parallel to _u_.)  3. As A moves along _u_, trace the path of B so that the two men may always see each other in the two mirrors.  4. Two boys walk along two paths _u_ and _u’_ each holding a string which they keep stretched tightly between them. They both move at constant but different rates of speed, letting out the string or drawing it in as they walk. How many times will the line of the string pass over any given point in the plane of the paths?  5. Trace the lines of the string when the two boys move at the same rate of speed in the two paths but do not start at the same time from the point where the two paths intersect.  6. A ship is sailing on a straight course and keeps a gun trained on a point on the shore. Show that a line at right angles to the direction of the gun at its muzzle will pass through any point in the plane twice or not at all. (Consider the point-row at infinity cut out by a line through the point on the shore at right angles to the direction of the gun.)  7. Two lines _u_ and _u’_ revolve about two points _U_ and _U’_ respectively in the same plane. They go in the same direction and at the same rate of speed, but one has an angle a the start of the other. Show that they generate a point-row of the second order.  8. Discuss the question given in the last problem when the two lines revolve in opposite directions. Can you recognize the locus?      CHAPTER IV - POINT-ROWS OF THE SECOND ORDER     *60. Point-row of the second order defined.*  We have seen that two fundamental forms in one-to-one correspondence may sometimes generate a form of higher order. Thus, two point-rows (§ 55) generate a system of rays of the second order, and two pencils of rays (§ 57), a system of points of the second order. As a system of points is more familiar to most students of geometry than a system of lines, we study first the point-row of the second order.     *61. Tangent line.*  We have shown in the last chapter (§ 55) that the locus of intersection of corresponding rays of two projective pencils is a point-row of the second order; that is, it has at most two points in common with any line in the plane. It is clear, first of all, that the centers of the pencils are points of the locus; for to the line _SS’_, considered as a ray of _S_, must correspond some ray of _S’_ which meets it in _S’_. _S’_, and by the same argument _S_, is then a point where corresponding rays meet. Any ray through _S_ will meet it in one point besides _S_, namely, the point _P_ where it meets its corresponding ray. Now, by choosing the ray through _S_ sufficiently close to the ray _SS’_, the point _P_ may be made to approach arbitrarily close to _S’_, and the ray _S’P_ may be made to differ in position from the tangent line at _S’_ by as little as we please. We have, then, the important theorem  _The ray at __S’__ which corresponds to the common ray __SS’__ is tangent to the locus at __S’__._  In the same manner the tangent at _S_ may be constructed.     *62. Determination of the locus.*  We now show that _it is possible to assign arbitrarily the position of three points, __A__, __B__, and __C__, on the locus (besides the points __S__ and __S’__); but, these three points being chosen, the locus is completely determined._     *63.*  This statement is equivalent to the following:  _Given three pairs of corresponding rays in two projective pencils, it is possible to find a ray of one which corresponds to any ray of the other._     *64.*  We proceed, then, to the solution of the fundamental  PROBLEM: _Given three pairs of rays, __aa’__, __bb’__, and __cc’__, of two protective pencils, __S__ and __S’__, to find the ray __d’__ of __S’__ which corresponds to any ray __d__ of __S__._                                 ["]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17001"],["title","An Elementary Course in Synthetic Projective Geometry (#7)"],["body","12]                                   FIG. 12   Call _A_ the intersection of _aa’_, _B_ the intersection of _bb’_, and _C_ the intersection of _cc’_ (Fig. 12). Join _AB_ by the line _u_, and _AC_ by the line _u’_. Consider _u_ as a point-row perspective to _S_, and _u’_ as a point-row perspective to _S’_. _u_ and _u’_ are projectively related to each other, since _S_ and _S’_ are, by hypothesis, so related. But their point of intersection _A_ is a self-corresponding point, since _a_ and _a’_ were supposed to be corresponding rays. It follows (§ 52) that _u_ and _u’_ are in perspective position, and that lines through corresponding points all pass through a point _M_, the center of perspectivity, the position of which will be determined by any two such lines. But the intersection of _a_ with _u_ and the intersection of _c’_ with _u’_ are corresponding points on _u_ and _u’_, and the line joining them is clearly _c_ itself. Similarly, _b’_ joins two corresponding points on _u_ and _u’_, and so the center _M_ of perspectivity of _u_ and _u’_ is the intersection of _c_ and _b’_. To find _d’_ in _S’_ corresponding to a given line _d_ of _S_ we note the point _L_ where _d_ meets _u_. Join _L_ to _M_ and get the point _N_ where this line meets _u’_. _L_ and _N_ are corresponding points on _u_ and _u’_, and _d’_ must therefore pass through _N_. The intersection _P_ of _d_ and _d’_ is thus another point on the locus. In the same manner any number of other points may be obtained.     *65.*  The lines _u_ and _u’_ might have been drawn in any direction through _A_ (avoiding, of course, the line _a_ for _u_ and the line _a’_ for _u’_), and the center of perspectivity _M_ would be easily obtainable; but the above construction furnishes a simple and instructive figure. An equally simple one is obtained by taking _a’_ for _u_ and _a_ for _u’_.     *66. Lines joining four points of the locus to a fifth.* Suppose that the points _S_, _S’_, _B_, _C_, and _D_ are fixed, and that four points, _A_, _A__1_, _A__2_, and _A__3_, are taken on the locus at the intersection with it of any four harmonic rays through _B_. These four harmonic rays give four harmonic points, _L_, _L__1_ etc., on the fixed ray _SD_. These, in turn, project through the fixed point _M_ into four harmonic points, _N_, _N__1_ etc., on the fixed line _DS’_. These last four harmonic points give four harmonic rays _CA_, _CA__1_, _CA__2_, _CA__3_. Therefore the four points _A_ which project to _B_ in four harmonic rays also project to _C_ in four harmonic rays. But _C_ may be any point on the locus, and so we have the very important theorem,  _Four points which are on the locus, and which project to a fifth point of the locus in four harmonic rays, project to any point of the locus in four harmonic rays._     *67.*  The theorem may also be stated thus:  _The locus of points from which, four given points are seen along four harmonic rays is a point-row of the second order through them._     *68.*  A further theorem of prime importance also follows:  _Any two points on the locus may be taken as the centers of two projective pencils which will generate the locus._     *69. Pascal’s theorem.*  The points _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_, _S_, and _S’_ may thus be considered as chosen arbitrarily on the locus, and the following remarkable theorem follows at once.  _Given six points, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, on the point-row of the second order, if we call_                     _L the intersection of 12 with 45,_                     _M the intersection of 23 with 56,_                     _N the intersection of 34 with 61,_  _then __L__, __M__, and __N__ are on a straight line._                                 [Figure 13]                                   FIG. 13     *70.*  To get the notation to correspond to the figure, we may take (Fig. 13) _A = 1_, _B = 2_, _S’ = 3_, _D = 4_, _S = 5_, and _C = 6_. If we make _A = 1_, _C=2_, _S=3_, _D = 4_, _S’=5_, and. _B = 6_, the points _L_ and _N_ are interchanged, but the line is left unchanged. It is clear that one point may be named arbitrarily and the other five named in _5! = 120_ different ways, but since, as we have seen, two different assignments of names give the same line, it follows that there cannot be more than 60 different lines _LMN_ obtained in this way from a given set of six points. As a matter of fact, the number obtained in this way is in general _60_. The above theorem, which is of cardinal importance in the theory of the point-row of the second order, is due to Pascal and was discovered by him at the age of sixteen. It is, no doubt, the most important contribution to the theory of these loci since the days of Apollonius. If the six points be called the vertices of a hexagon inscribed in the curve, then the sides 12 and 45 may be appropriately called a pair of opposite sides. Pascal’s theorem, then, may be stated as follows:  _The three pairs of opposite sides of a hexagon inscribed in a point-row of the second order meet in three points on a line._     *71. Harmonic points on a point-row of the second order.* Before proceeding to develop the consequences of this theorem, we note another result of the utmost importance for the higher developments of pure geometry, which follows from the fact that if four points on the locus project to a fifth in four harmonic rays, they will project to any point of the locus in four harmonic rays. It is natural to speak of four such points as four harmonic points on the locus, and to use this notion to define projective correspondence between point-rows of the second order, or between a point-row of the second order and any fundamental form of the first order. Thus, in particular, the point-row of the second order, σ, is said to be _perspectively related_ to the pencil _S_ when every ray on _S_ goes through the point on σ which corresponds to it.     *72. Determination of the locus.*  It is now clear that five points, arbitrarily chosen in the plane, are sufficient to determine a point-row of the second order through them. Two of the points may be taken as centers of two projective pencils, and the three others will determine three pairs of corresponding rays of the pencils, and therefore all pairs. If four points of the locus are given, together with the tangent at one of them, the locus is likewise completely determined. For if the point at which the tangent is given be taken as the center _S_ of one pencil, and any other of the points for _S’_, then, besides the two pairs of corresponding rays determined by the remaining two points, we have one more pair, consisting of the tangent at _S_ and the ray _SS’_. Similarly, the curve is determined by three points and the tangents at two of them.     *73. Circles and conics as point-rows of the second order.* It is not difficult to see that a circle is a point-row of the second order. Indeed, take any point _S_ on the circle and draw four harmonic rays through it. They will cut the circle in four points, which will project to any other point of the curve in four harmonic rays; for, by the theorem concerning the angles inscribed in a circle, the angles involved in the second set of four lines are the same as those in the first set. If, moreover, we project the figure to any point in space, we shall get a cone, standing on a circular base, generated by two projective axial pencils which are the projections of the pencils at _S_ and _S’_. Cut across, now, by any plane, and we get a conic section which is thus exhibited as the locus of intersection of two projective pencils. It thus appears that a conic section is a point-row of the second order. It will later appear that a point-row of the second order is a conic section. In the future, therefore, we shall refer to a point-row of the second order as a conic.                                 [Figure 14]                                   FIG. 14     *74. Conic through five points.*  Pascal’s theorem furnishes an elegant solution of the problem of drawing a conic through five given points. To construct a sixth point on the conic, draw through the point numbered 1 an arbitrary line (Fig. 14), and let the desired point 6 be the second point of intersection of this line with the conic. The point _L = 12-45_ is obtainable at once; also the point _N = 34-61_. But _L_ and _N_ determine Pascal’s line, and the intersection of 23 with 56 must be on this line. Intersect, then, the line _LN_ with 23 and obtain the point _M_. Join _M_ to 5 and intersect with 61 for the desired point 6.                                 [Figure 15]                                   FIG. 15     *75. Tangent to a conic.*  If two points of Pascal’s hexagon approach coincidence, then the line joining them approaches as a limiting position the tangent line at that point. Pascal’s theorem thus affords a ready method of drawing the tangent line to a conic at a given point. If the conic is determined by the points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (Fig. 15), and it is desired to draw the tangent at the point 1, we may call that point 1, 6. The points _L_ and _M_ are obtained as usual, and the intersection of 34 with _LM_ gives _N_. Join _N_ to the point 1 for the desired tangent at that point.     *76. Inscribed quadrangle.*  Two pairs of vertices may coalesce, giving an inscribed quadrangle. Pascal’s theorem gives for this case the very important theorem  _Two pairs of opposite sides of any quadrangle inscribed in a conic meet on a straight line, upon which line also intersect the two pairs of tangents at the opposite vertices._                                 [Figure 16]                                   FIG. 16                                  [Figure 17]                                   FIG. 17   For let the vertices be _A_, _B_, _C_, and _D_, and call the vertex _A_ the point 1, 6; _B_, the point 2; _C_, the point 3, 4; and _D_, the point 5 (Fig. 16). Pascal’s theorem then indicates that _L = AB-CD_, _M = AD-BC_, and _N_, which is the intersection of the"]]]
