But the Normans in France declared Edward had promised that his cousin William, Duke of Normandy (S65), should reign after him.  The Witan, or National Council of England (S81), chose Harold.  That settled the question, for the Council alone had the right to decide who should rule over the English people.  Harold was soon afterward crowned (January 16, 1066).  68. Duke William prepares to invade England (1066).  William, Duke of Normandy, was getting ready for a hunting expedition when the news was brought to him of Harold's accession (S67).  The old chronicler says that the Duke \"stopped short in his preparations; he spoke to no man, and no man dared speak to him.\"  Finally he resolved to appeal to the sword and take the English crown by force.  During the spring and summer of that year, he occupied himself in fitting out a fleet to invade England, and his smiths and armorers were busy making lances, swords, and coats of mail.  The Pope favored the expedition and presented a banner blessed by himself, to be carried in the attack; \"mothers, too, sent their sons for the salvation of their souls.\"  69. The Expedition Sails (1066).  William sailed on his great expedition in the autumn with a fleet of several hundred vesseles and a large number of transports.  The Duke's ship, with the consecrated banner at the masthead, led the fleet.  His army consisted of archers and cavalry.  Its strength has been variously estimated at from 14,000 men up to 60,000.  They were partly his own subjects, and partly hired soldiers, or those who joined for the sake of plunder.  William also carried a large force of smiths and carpenters, with timber ready cut and fitted to set up a wooden castle.  70. William lands at Pevensey.  The next day the fleet anchored at Pevensey, on the south coast of England, under the walls of an old Roman fortress which had stood, a vacant ruin, since the Saxons stormed it nearly six hundred years before.  (See map facing p. 38.)  Tradition says that as William stepped on shore he stumbled and fell flat with his face downward. \"God preserve us!\" cried one of his men; \"this is a bad sign.\"  But the Duke, grasping the pebbles of the beach with both his outstretched hands, exclaimed, \"Thus do I seize the land!\"  71. King Harold in the North.  There was, in fact, no power to prevent him from establishing his camp, for King Harold (S67) was in the north quelling an invasion headed by the King of the Norwegians and his brother Tostig, who hoped to secure the throne for himself.  Harold had just sat down to a victory feast, after the battle of Stamford Bridge, Yorkshire, when news was brought to him of the landing of William.  It was this fatal want of unity in England which made the Norman Conquest possible.  If Harold's own brother, Tostig, had not turned traitorously against him, or if the north country had stood squarely by the south, Duke William might have found his fall on the beach an omen full of disaster.  72. What Duke William did after Landing.  As there was no one to oppose him, William made a fort in a corner of the old Roman wall at Pevensey (S70), and then marched to Hastings, a few miles farther east, where he set up a wooden castle on that hill where the ruins of a later stone castle may still be seen.  Having done this, he pillaged the country in every direction.  73. Harold marches to meet William.  King Harold, having gathered what forced he could, marched to meet William at a place midway between Pevensey and Hastings, about five miles back from the coast.  Harold had the advantage of a stockaded fort he had built; William, that of a body of cavalry and archers, for the English fought on foot with javelins and battle-axes mainly.  The Saxons spent the night in feasting and song, the Normans in prayer and confession; both were eager to fight.  74. The Great Battle of Hastings, 1066.  On the morning of the 14th of October the fight began.  It lasted until dark, with heavy loss on both sides.  At length William's strategy carried the day, and Harold and his brave followers found to their cost that then, as now, it is \"the thinking bayonet\" which conquers.  The English King was slain and every man of his chosen troops with him.  A monk who wrote the history of the period of the Conquest, says that \"the vices of the Saxons had made them effeminate and womanish, wherefore it came to pass that, running against Duke William, they lost themselves and their country with one, and that an easy and light, battle.\"  Doubtless the English had fallen off in many ways from what hey had been generations earlier; but the record at Hastings shows that they had lost neither strength, courage, nor endurance, and a harder battle ws never fought on British soil.  75. Battle Abbey; Harold's Grave; the Beyeu^x Tapestry.  A few years later, the Norman Conqueror built the Abbey of Battle on the spot to commemorate the victory by which he gained his crown.  He directed that the monks of the abbey should chant perpetual prayers over the Norman soldiers who had fallen there.  Here, also, tradition represents him as having buried Harold's body, just after the fight, under a heap of stones by the seashore.  Some months later, it is said that the friends of the English King removed the remains to Waltham, near London, and buried them in the church which he had built and endowed there.  Be that as it may, his grave, wherever it is, is the grave of the old England.  Henceforth a new people (though not a new race, for the Normans originally came from the same Germanic stock as the English did) (S62) will appear in the history of the island.  Several contemporary accounts of the battle exist by both French and English writers, but one of the best histories of it is that which was wrought in colors by a woman's hand.  It represents the scenes of the famous contest on a strip of canvas known as the Bayeux Tapestry (S155), a name derived from the French town where it is still preserved.  76. Close of the Period; what the Saxon Conquest of Britain had accomplished.  The death of King Harold ends the Saxon or English period of history. Before entering upon the reign of William the Conqueror let us consider what that period had accomplished.  We have seen that the Jutes, Saxons, and Angles (SS36, 37) invaded Britain at a critical period.  Its original inhabitants had become cowed and enervated by the despotism and the worn-out civilization forced on them by the Romans (SS30-32).  The newcomers brought that healthy spirit of barbarism, that irrepressible love of personal liberty, which the country sorely needed.  The conquerors were rough, ignorant, cruel; but they were vigorous, fearless, and determined.  These qualities were worth a thousand times more to Britain than the gilded corruption of Rome.  But in the course of time the Saxons or English themselves lost spirit (S36).  Their besetting sin was a stolidity which degenerated into animalism and sluggish content.  77. Fresh Elements contributed by the Danes or Northmen.  Then came the Danes or Northmen (SS52, 63).  They brought with them a new spirit of still more savage independence which found expression in their song, \"I trust my sword, I trust my steed, but most I trust myself at need.\"  They conquered a large part of the island, and in conquering regenerated it.  So strong was their love of independence, that even the lowest classes of farm laborers were quite generally free.  More small independent landholders were found amongh the Danish population than anywhere else; and it is said that the number now existing in the region which they settled in the northeast of England is still much larger than in the south.  (See map facing p. 32.) Finally, the Danes and the English, both of whome sprang from the North Germanic tribes (S36), mingled and becames in all respects one people.  78. Summary: What the Anglo-Saxons accomplished.  Thus Jutes, Saxons, Angles, and Danes, whom together we may call the Anglo-Saxons,[1] laid the corner stone of the English nation.  However much that nation has changed since, it remains, nevertheless, in its solid and fundamental qualities, what those peoples made it.  [1] Anglo-Saxons: Some authorities insist that this phrase means the Saxons of England in distinction from those of the Continent.  It is used here, however, in the sense given by Professor Freeman, as a term describing the people formed in England by the union of the Germanic tribes which had settled in the island.  They gave first the language, simple strong, direct, and plain--the familiar, everyday speech of the fireside and the street, the well-known words of both the newspaper and the Bible.  Next they established the government in its main outlines as it still exists; that is, a king, a legislative body representing the people, and a judicial system embodying the germ, at least, of trial by jury (S89).  Last, and best, they furnished conservative patience, persistent effort, indomitable tenacity of purpose, and cool, determined courage.  These qualities have won glorious victories on both sides of the Atlantic, not only in the conflicts of war, but in the contests of peace, and who can doubt that they are destined to win still greater ones in the future?

As the author of poetry of exquisite quality, where for the last time may be heard the priceless note of the Elizabethan lyricist, whilst at the same moment utterance is being given to thoughts and feelings which reach far forward to Wordsworth and Shelley, Marvell can never be forgotten in his native England.  Lines of Marvell's poetry have secured the final honours, and incurred the peril, of becoming \"familiar quotations\" ready for use on a great variety of occasion. We may, perhaps, have been bidden once or twice too often to remember how the Royal actor      \"Nothing common did, or mean,      Upon that memorable scene,\"  or have been assured to our surprise by some self-satisfied worldling how he always hears at his back,      \"Time's wingèd chariot hurrying near.\"  A true poet can, however, never be defiled by the rough usage of the populace.  As a politician Marvell lives in the old-fashioned vivacious history-books (which if they die out, as they show some signs of doing, will carry with them half the historic sense of the nation) as the hero of an anecdote of an unsuccessful attempt made upon his political virtue by a minister of the Crown, as a rare type of an inflexible patriot, and as the last member of the House of Commons who was content to take wages from, instead of contributing to the support of, his constituents. As the intimate friend and colleague of Milton, Marvell shares some of the indescribable majesty of that throne. A poet, a scholar, a traveller, a diplomat, a famous wit, an active member of Parliament from the Restoration to his death in 1678, the life of Andrew Marvell might _a priori_ be supposed to be one easy to write, at all events after the fashion in which men's lives get written. But it is nothing of the kind, as many can testify. A more elusive, non-recorded character is hardly to be found. We know all about him, but very little of him. His parentage, his places of education, many of his friends and acquaintances, are all known. He wrote nearly four hundred letters to his Hull constituents, carefully preserved by the Corporation, in which he narrates with much particularity the course of public business at Westminster. Notwithstanding these materials, the man Andrew Marvell remains undiscovered. He rarely comes to the surface. Though both an author and a member of Parliament, not a trace of personal vanity is noticeable, and vanity is a quality of great assistance to the biographer. That Marvell was a strong, shrewd, capable man of affairs, with enormous powers of self-repression, his Hull correspondence clearly proves, but what more he was it is hard to say. He rarely spoke during his eighteen years in the House of Commons. It is impossible to doubt that such a man in such a place was, in Mr. Disraeli's phrase, a \"personage.\" Yet when we look for recognition of what we feel sure was the fact, we fail to find it. Bishop Burnet, in his delightful history, supplies us with sketches of the leading Parliamentarians of Marvell's day, yet to Marvell himself he refers but once, and then not by name but as \"the liveliest droll of the age,\" words which mean much but tell little. In Clarendon's _Autobiography_, another book which lets the reader into the very clash and crowd of life, there is no mention of one of the author's most bitter and cruel enemies. With Prince Rupert, Marvell was credited by his contemporaries with a great intimacy; he was a friend of Harrington's; it may be he was a member of the once famous \"Rota\" Club; it is impossible to resist the conviction that wherever he went he made a great impression, that he was a central figure in the lobbies of the House of Commons and a man of much account; yet no record survives either to convince posterity of his social charm or even to convey any exact notion of his personal character.  A somewhat solitary man he would appear to have been, though fond of occasional jollity. He lived alone in lodgings, and was much immersed in business, about a good deal of which we know nothing except that it took him abroad. His death was sudden, and when three years afterwards the first edition of his poems made its appearance, it was prefaced by a certificate signed \"Mary Marvell,\" to the effect that everything in the book was printed \"according to the copies of my late dear husband.\" Until after Marvell's death we never hear of Mrs. Marvell, and with this signed certificate she disappears. In a series of Lives of Poets' Wives it would be hard to make much of Mrs. Andrew Marvell. For different but still cogent reasons it is hard to write a life of her famous husband.  Andrew Marvell was born at Winestead in Holdernesse, on Easter Eve, the 31st of March 1621, in the Rectory House, the elder Marvell, also Andrew, being then the parson of the parish. No fitter birthplace for a garden-poet can be imagined. Roses still riot in Winestead; the fruit-tree roots are as mossy as in the seventeenth century. At the right season you may still      \"Through the hazels thick espy     The hatching throstle's shining eye.\"  Birds, fruits and flowers, woods, gardens, meads, and rivers still make the poet's birthplace lovely.      \"Loveliness, magic, and grace,     They are here--they are set in the world!     They abide! and the finest of souls     Has not been thrilled by them all,     Nor the dullest been dead to them quite.     The poet who sings them may die,     But they are immortal and live,     For they are the life of the world.\"  Holdernesse was not the original home of the Marvells, who would seem to have been mostly Cambridgeshire folk, though the name crops up in other counties. Whether Cambridge \"men\" of a studious turn still take long walks I do not know, but \"some vast amount of years ago\" it was considered a pleasant excursion, either on foot or on a hired steed, from Cambridge to Meldreth, where the Elizabethan manor-house, long known as \"the Marvells',\" agreeably embodied the tradition that here it was that the poet's father was born in 1586. The Church Registers have disappeared. Proof is impossible. That there were Marvells in the neighbourhood is certain. The famous Cambridge antiquary, William Cole, perhaps the greatest of all our collectors, has included among his copies of early wills those of several Marvells and Mervells of Meldreth and Shepreth, belonging to pre-Reformation times, as their pious gifts to the \"High Altar\" and to \"Our Lady's Light\" pleasingly testify. But our Andrew was a determined Protestant.  The poet's father is an interesting figure in our Church history. Educated at Emmanuel College, from whence he proceeded a Master of Arts in 1608, he took Orders; and after serving as curate at Flamborough, was inducted to the living of Winestead in 1614, where he remained till 1624, in which year he went to Hull as master of the Grammar School and lecturer, that is preacher, of Trinity Church. The elder Marvell belonged, from the beginning to the end of his useful and even heroic life, to the Reformed Church of England, or, as his son puts it, \"a conformist to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of England, though I confess none of the most over-run"]]]
