The first time I tried this, under Nicola Tesla's supervision, I'd jerked my hand away and squeezed it between my legs as soon as the current shot through me. Now, though, I could keep squeezing, slowly increasing the voltage and amperage, relaxing into the involuntary tension in my muscles.  I'd gotten so good at it that I'd started using the timer -- I could lean into the current forever without it. I had it set for three hours, but when the current died, it felt like no time at all had passed. I probed around my consciousness for any revelation, but no spirit had come into my body during the exercise. The guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla didn't know if there were any other spirits in the wire, but it stood to reason that if there was one, there had to be more.  I stood, and felt incredibly calm and balanced and centered and I floated past the other kids. It was time for my session with The Amazing Robotron.  \"Chet, how are you fee-ling?\"  \"I'm well, thank you.\" Nicola Tesla spoke well and carefully, and I'd started to ape him.  \"And what would you like to dis-cuss to-day?\"  \"I don't really have anything to talk about, honestly. Everything is fine.\"  \"That is good. Do you have any new ob-ser-va-tions about your friends?\"  \"I'm sorry, no. I haven't been paying much attention lately.\"  \"Why hav-en't you?\"  \"It just doesn't interest me, sorry.\"  \"Why does-n't it in-ter-est you?\"  \"I just don't care about them, to be frank.\"  The Amazing Robotron was absolutely still for a moment. \"Are things well with your par-ents, too?\"  \"The same as always. I think they've found their niches.\" _Find your niche_ was an expression I'd pirated from the guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla. I was very proud of it.  \"In that case, why don't we end this mee-ting?\"  I was surprised. The Amazing Robotron always demanded his full hour. \"I'll see you on Wednesday, then?\"  \"I'm af-raid not, Chet. I will be gone for a few months -- I have to re-turn home. There will be a sub-sti-tute coun-sel-or arri-ving next Monday.\"  My calm center shattered. Sweat sprang out on my palms. \"What? You're leaving? How can you be leaving?\"  \"I'm so-rry, Chet. There is an em-er-gen-cy at home. I'll be back as soon as I can.\"  \"Frick that! How can you go? What'll I do if you don't come back? You're the only one I can talk to!\"  \"I'm so-rry, Chet. I have to go.\"  \"If you gave a shit, you'd stay. You can't just leave me here!\" I knew as I said it that it didn't make any sense, but a picture sprang into my mind, one that I'd been carrying without knowing it for a long time: The Amazing Robotron and me as an adult, walking away from the bat-house, with suitcases, leaving together, forever. I felt a sob hiccough in my throat.  \"I will re-turn, Chet. I did-n't wish to up-set you.\"  \"Frick that! I don't give a shit if you come back, asshole.\"  #  Chet went straight to 87 and plugged in to the apparatus. He didn't set the timer, and he stayed plugged in for nearly two days, when two fighting boys tumbled into him and knocked his hand away. He was centered and numb again, and didn't have any sense of the intervening time. He didn't even have to pee. He wondered if he was trying to commit suicide.  He checked his comm and got the date, noticed with distant surprise that it was two days later, and wandered up to 125.  The guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla shouted a distant \"Come in\" when Chet tapped on the door. He was playing with his ocean again. Chet felt his hair float up off his shoulders. He stopped and watched the coral squirm and dance.  \"I spent nearly two days on the apparatus,\" Chet said.  \"Eh? Very good, very good. You're progressing nicely.\"  \"My counselor has left. He had to go home.\"  \"Yes? Well, there you are.\"  \"What were your parents like?\"  \"Nicola Tesla's father was a bishop, and his mother was an illiterate, though she was a gifted memnist and taught me much about visualization.\"  \"No, I mean _your_ parents. Mister and Missus Ballozos. What were _they_ like?\"  The guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla shut down the ocean and watched the lumps of ore tumble to the sand. \"Why do you want to know about _them_? Are you having some sort of trouble at home?\" he asked impatiently, not looking away from the ocean.  \"No reason,\" Chet said. \"I have to go home now.\"  \"Yes, fine.\"  #  \"The hell have you been, boy?\" Chet's father said, when he came through door. His father was in front of the vid, wearing shorts and a filthy t-shirt, holding the remote in one hand. Chet's mother was sitting at the window, staring out into the clouds.  \"Out. Around. I'm okay, okay?\"  \"It's not okay. You can't just run around like some kind of animal. Sit the hell down and tell me where you've been. Your counselor was here looking for you.\"  \"Robotron? He was here?\"  \"Yes he was here! And I had to tell him I didn't know where my damn kid was! How do you think that makes me look? You know how worried your mother was?\"  Chet's mother didn't stir from her post by the window, but she flinched when Chet's father spoke. Chet swallowed hard.  \"What did he want?\"  \"Never mind that! Sit the hell down and tell me where you've been and what the hell you thought you were doing!\"  Chet sat beside his father and stared at his hands. He knew he could outwait his father. After half an hour, Chet's father turned the vid on. Four long hours later, he switched it off, and went to bed.  Chet's mother finally turned away from the now-dark window. She reached into the pocket of her grimy bathrobe and withdrew an envelope and handed it to Chet, then turned and went to the apt's other room to sleep.  My name was on the outside of the envelope, in rough script, written with awkward exoskeleton manipulators. I broke its seal, and it folded out into a single flat sheet of paper.  DEAR CHET, it began. At the bottom of it was a complex scrawl that I recognized from the front of The Amazing Robotron's exoskeleton. It must be some kind of signature.  DEAR CHET,  I AM SORRY TO HAVE TO LEAVE YOU SO SUDDENLY, AND WITHOUT ANYONE ELSE TO TALK TO. THERE IS AN EMERGENCY AT MY HOME, BUT I WOULDN'T GO IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO HANDLE MY ABSENCE. YOU ARE A VERY PERCEPTIVE AND STRONG YOUNG MAN, AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE IN MY ABSENCE. I WILL BE BACK, YOU KNOW.  YOU WILL BE ALL RIGHT. I PROMISE.  THIS ISN'T EASY FOR ME TO DO, EITHER. IT MAY BE THAT I AM THE ONLY ONE YOU CAN TALK TO HERE AT THE CENTER. IT IS LIKEWISE TRUE THAT YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE I CAN TALK TO.  I WILL MISS YOU, MY FRIEND CHET.  The writing was childish, with many line-outs and corrections. Reading it, I heard it not in The Amazing Robotron's halting mechanical speech, but in my own voice.  I didn't cry. I held the letter tight in my hand, as tight as I ever held the apparatus, and leaned into it, like it was a source of strength.  #  They haven't even started work on the bat-house. There are bugout saucers hovering all around it, with giant foam-solvent tanks mounted under their bellies. A small crowd has gathered.  I take off my jacket and lay it on the strip of grass by the sidewalk across the street from the bat-house. I pull off my soaked t-shirt and feel a rare breeze across my chest, as soothing as a kiss on a fevered forehead. I ball up the shirt, then lay down on my jacket, using the shirt as a pillow.  The bat-house is empty, its eyes staring blind, vertical to infinity. The grotty sculpture out front is gone already, and with it, the sign with the polite, never-used name. It is now just the bat-house.  I check my comm. The dissolving of the bat-house is scheduled for less than an hour from now.  #  The new counselor was no damn good. It wore a different exoskeleton, a motorized gurney on wheels with three buzzing antigrav manipulators that floated constantly around the apt, tasting the air. It called itself \"Tom.\" I didn't call it anything, and I limited my answers to it to monosyllables.  The next time I came on the guy who was Nicola Tesla in his chair, the letter was in my pocket. I took a long swim in the ocean, and then I stripped off my mask and spit out the snorkel, took a deep breath and dove until my ears felt like they were going to burst. I stared at my reflection in the silvered wall of the tank. Through the distortion of the water and the sting of the salt, my body was indistinct and clothed in quicksilver, surrounded by schools of alien, darting fish. I didn't recognize myself, but I didn't take my eyes away until my lungs were ready to burst and I resurfaced.  The guy who thought he was Nicola Tesla was still thrashing away at his straps when I climbed down from the ocean's top. At one side of Old Sparky, there was a timer, like the one on my apparatus, and a knife-switch for timed and untimed sessions.  I stared at him. My life unrolled before me, a life distanced and remote from the world around me, a life trapped in my own deepening battiness. Before I could think about what I was doing, I flipped the switch from \"timed\" to \"untimed.\" I took one last look at the ocean, looked again at Nicola Tesla, my friend and seducer, stuck to his chair until someone switched it off again, and left the 125th floor.  #  I took the apparatus apart in the kiddy workshop, stripped it to a collection of screws and wires and circuit boards, then carefully smashed each component with a hammer until it was in thousands of tiny pieces.  It took me two days to do it right, and not a moment passed when I didn't nearly run upstairs and switch off Tesla's chair.  And not a moment passed when I didn't visualize Tesla's wrath, his betrayal, his anger, when I unbuckled him.  And not a moment passed when I didn't wish I could plug in the apparatus, swim in the ocean, take myself away from the world and the world away from me.  The Amazing Robotron returned at the end of the second day.  \"Chet, I am glad to see you a-gain.\"  I bit my lip and choked on tears"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17138"],["title","Home Again, Home Again (#7)"],["body","relief. \"I need to leave here, Robotron. I can't stay another minute. Please, get me out of here. I'll do anything. I'll run away. Get me out, get me out, get me out!\" I was babbling, sniveling and crying, and I begged all the harder.  \"Why do you want to leave right now?\"  \"I -- I can't take it anymore. I can't _stand_ being here. I'd rather be in prison than in here anymore.\"  \"When I was young, I left the Cen-ter I was rais-ed in to attend coun-sel-ing school. You are near-ly old e-nough to go now. May-be your pa-rents would let you go?\"  I knew he had found the only way out.  I started work on my father. I wheedled and begged and demanded, and he just laughed. For three whole days, I used begging as a way to avoid thinking of Tesla. For three days, my father shook his head.  I cried myself to sleep and wallowed in my guilt every night, and when I woke, I cried more. I stopped leaving the apt. I stopped eating. My mother and I sat all day, staring out the window. I stopped talking.  One morning, after my father had left, I dragged a stool to the window and pressed my face against it. My mother clattered around behind me.  \"Go,\" my mother said.  I gave a squeak and turned around. My mother had folded my clothes in a neat pile and had laid a canvas bag beside it. She had the vid remote in her hand, and on the screen was a waiver for me to go to school. We locked eyes for a moment, and I moved to go to her, but she turned and stormed into the kitchen and started to clean the cupboards, silent again.  I left that day.  #  The saucers lift off to-the-second on-time. The crowd, which has grown, sighs collectively as the saucers disappear over the haze, then a fine mist of solvent rains down on our heads. It's as salty as sea-water, and the bat-house trembles as it begins to melt. Streams of salty water course down its sides.  The top of the building comes into view, the saucers chasing it down as it dissolves, spraying a steady blast of solvent.  I tense as the building's top reaches what I estimate to be 150. My calves bunch and my breath catches in my chest. I feel like I'm drowning, and the building's top crawls downwards, and my feet are sloshing to the ankles in dissolved foam, that runs off into the sewers.  I stay tense until the building's top is far beneath what _must_ be 125, then I exhale in a whoof of air. My head spins, and I brace my hands against my thighs. I'm not looking up when it happens, as a result.  The first sign is when the great tide of green, scummy, plant-stinking water courses down over us, soaking us to the skin, blinding me and sending me reeling in reverie. Did I see hunks of dead, petrified coral crashing around me, or did I imagine it?  A brief second later the building's top emits a bolt of lightning that broke even Tesla's record for man-made lightning, recorded at nearly a kilometer in length. A clap of thunder accompanies it, louder than any sound I have ever heard, and it its wake I am perfectly deaf, submerged in silence.  The finger of lightning crawls through space like a broken-back rattler, and my hair rises from my shoulders. In the presence of so much current, I should be petrified, but it is magnificent. The finger seeks and seeks, then contacts one of the saucers and literally blasts it out of the sky. It plummets in slow-motion, and as it does, the building's top descends even further, and I _swear_ I see the chair falling from the building's edge, and the man strapped inside it had not aged a day in all the lifetimes gone by.  #  Chet's comm died somewhere in the lightning strike, but the emergency crews that took him away and looked in his ears and poked him in the chest and gave him pills take him back to the Royal York in a saucer, bridging the distance in a few minutes, touching down on Front Street. The Royal York's doorman doesn't bat an eye as he gets the door for him.  The elevator ride is fine. He is still wrapped in the silence of his deafness, but it's a comforting, _centering_ silence.  Once Chet is back in his room, he fires up the vid and starts writing a letter to The Amazing Robotron.  --  <!--  <rdf:RDF xmlns=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/\" xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"> <Work rdf:about=\"http://craphound.com/place/Cory_Doctorow_-_Home_Again_Home_Again.txt\" > <dc:title>Home Again, Home Again</dc:title> <dc:date>1999-2-1</dc:date> <dc:description>A science&#45;fiction short story by Cory Doctorow about aliens subjugating humans by putting them into mental institutions, from the short story collection \"A Place So Foreign and Eight More,\" published by Four Walls Eight Windows press in September, 2003 (ISBN: 1568582862)</dc:description> <dc:creator><Agent> <dc:title>Cory Doctorow</dc:title> </Agent></dc:creator> <dc:rights><Agent> <dc:title>Cory Doctorow</dc:title> </Agent></dc:rights> <dc:type rdf:resource=\"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text\" /> <license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/\" /> </Work>  <License rdf:about=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/\"> <permits rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/Reproduction\" /> <permits rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/Distribution\" /> <requires rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/Notice\" /> <requires rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/Attribution\" /> <prohibits rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/CommercialUse\" /> </License>  </rdf:RDF>  -->"]]]
