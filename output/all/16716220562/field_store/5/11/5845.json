In drawing and painting, though I had a certain natural aptitude for both, I never attained much proficiency in either, partly for lack of instruction, partly from want of application, but more especially, I believe, because another, more alluring, more mentally exciting occupation beguiled me.  It was not music, though to music close allied. This new-found joy I long pursued in secret, afraid lest it should be discovered and despised as a folly.  It was not until I lived in Scotland, where poetical taste and business talent thrive side by side, and where, as Mr. Spurgeon said, \"no country in the world produced so many poets,\" that I became courageous, and ventured to avow my dear delight.  It was there that I sought, with some success, publication in various papers and magazines of my attempts at versification, for versification it was that so possessed my fancy.  Of the spacious times of great Elizabeth it has been written, \"the power of action and the gift of song did not exclude each other,\" but in England, in mid-Victorian days, it was looked upon differently, or so at least I believed.  After a time I had the distinction of being included in a new edition of _Recent and Living Scottish Poets_, by Alexander Murdoch, published in 1883.  My inclusion was explained on the ground that, \"His muse first awoke to conscious effort on Scottish soil,\" which, though not quite in accordance with fact, was not so wide of the mark that I felt in the least concerned to criticise the statement.  I was too much enamoured of the honour to question the foundation on which it rested.  Perhaps it was as well deserved as are some others of this world's distinctions!  At any rate it was neither begged nor bought, but came \"Like Dian's kiss, unasked, unsought.\"  In the same year (1883) I also appeared in _Edwards_' Sixth Series of _Modern Scottish Poets_; and in 1885, more legitimately, in William Andrews' book on _Modern Yorkshire Poets_.  My claim for this latter distinction was not, however, any greater, if as great, as my right to inclusion in the collection of _Scottish Poets_.  If I \"lisped in numbers,\" it was not in Yorkshire, for Yorkshire I left for ever before even the first babblings of babyhood began.  However, \"kissing goes by favour,\" and I was happy in the favour I enjoyed.  I may as well say it here: with my poetical productions I was never satisfied any more than with my attempts at drawing.  My verses seemed mere farthing dips compared with the resplendent poetry of our country which I read and loved, but my efforts employed and brightened many an hour in my youth that otherwise would have been tedious and dreary.  Ours was a large family, nine children in all; nothing unusual in those days.  \"A quiver full\" was then a matter of parental pride.  Woman was more satisfied with home life then than now.  The pursuit of pleasure was not so keen.  Our parents and our grandparents were simpler in their tastes, more easily amused, more readily impressed with the wonderful and the strange.  Things that would leave us unmoved were to them matters of moment.  Railways were new and railway travelling was, to most people, an event.  Our fathers talked of their last journey to London, their visit to the Tower, to Westminster Abbey, the Monument, Madame Tussauds; how they mistook the waxwork policeman for a real member of the force; how they shuddered in the _Chamber of Horrors_; how they travelled on the new Underground Railway; and saw the wonders of the Crystal Palace, especially on fireworks night.  They told us of their visit to the _Great Eastern_, what a gigantic ship it was, what a marvel, and described its every feature.  They talked of General Tom Thumb, of Blondin, of Pepper's Ghost, of the Christy Minstrels.  Nowadays, a father will return from London and not even mention the Tubes to his children.  Why should he? They know all about them and are surprised at nothing.  The picture books and the cinemas have familiarised them with every aspect of modern life.  In those days our pleasures and our amusements were fewer, but impressed us more.  I remember how eagerly the coloured pictures of the Christmas numbers of the pictorial papers were looked forward to, talked of, criticised, admired, framed and hung up.  I remember too, the excitements of Saint Valentine's Day, Shrove Tuesday, April Fool's Day, May Day and the Morris (Molly) dancers; and the Fifth of November, Guy Fawkes Day.  I remember also the peripatetic knife grinder and his trundling machine, the muffin man, the pedlar and his wares, the furmity wheat vendor, who trudged along with his welcome cry of \"Frummitty!\" from door to door. Those were pleasant and innocent excitements.  We have other things to engage us now, but I sometimes think all is not _gain_ that the march of progress brings.  Young people then had fewer books to read, but read them thoroughly.  What excitement and discussion attended the monthly instalments of Dickens' novels in _All the Year Round_; how eagerly they were looked for.  Lucky he or she who had heard the great _master_ read himself in public.  His books were read in our homes, often aloud to the family circle by paterfamilias, and moved us to laughter or tears.  I never now see our young people, or their elders either, affected by an author as we were then by the power of Dickens.  He was a new force and his pages kindled in our hearts a vivid feeling for the poor and their wrongs.  Scott's _Waverley Novels_, too, aroused our enthusiasm.  In the early sixties a cheap edition appeared, and cheap editions were rare things then.  It was published, if I remember aright, at two shillings per volume; an event that stirred the country.  My father brought each volume home as it came out.  I remember it well; a pale, creamy-coloured paper cover, good type, good paper.  What treasures they were, and only two shillings!  I was a little child when an important movement for the cheapening of books began.  In 1852 Charles Dickens presided at a meeting of authors and others against the coercive regulations of the Booksellers' Association which maintained their excessive profits. Herbert Spencer and Miss Evans (George Eliot) took a prominent part in this meeting and drafted the resolutions which were passed.  The ultimate effect of this meeting was that the question between the authors and the booksellers was referred to Lord Campbell as arbitrator.  He gave a decision against the booksellers; and there were consequently abolished such of the trade regulations as had interdicted the sale of books at lower rates of profit than those authorised by the Booksellers' Association.  Practically all my school days were spent at Derby.  As I have said, ours was a large family.  I have referred to an only sister, but I had step- sisters and step-brothers too.  My father married twice and the second family was numerous.  His salary was never more than 300 pounds a year, and though a prudent enough man, he was not of the frugal economical sort who makes the most of every shilling.  It may be imagined, then, that all the income was needed for a family that, parents included, but excluding the one servant, numbered eleven.  The consequence was that the education I received could not be described as liberal.  I attended a day school at Derby, connected with the Wesleyans; why I do not know, as we belonged to the Anglican Church; but I believe it was because the school, while cheap as to fees, had the reputation of giving a good, plain education suitable for boys destined for railway work.  It was a good sized school of about a hundred boys.  Not long ago I met one day in London a business man who, it turned out, was at this school with me.  We had not met for fifty years.  \"Well,\" said he, \"I think old Jessie, if he did not teach us a great variety of things, what he did he taught well.\"  My new-found old schoolmate had become the financial manager of a great business house having ramifications throughout the world.  He had attained to position and wealth and, which successful men sometimes are not, was quite unspoiled.  We revived our schooldays with mutual pleasure, and lunched together as befitted the occasion.  \"Jessie\" was the name by which our old schoolmaster was endeared to his boys; a kindly, simple-minded, worthy man, teaching, as well as scholastic subjects, behaviour, morals, truth, loyalty; and these as much by example as by precept, impressing ever upon us the virtue of thoroughness in all we did and of truth in all we said.  Since those days I have seen many youths, educated at much finer and more pretentious schools, who have benefited by modern educational methods, and on whose education much money has been expended, and who, when candidates for clerkships, have, in the simple matters of reading, writing, arithmetic, composition and spelling, shown up very poorly compared to what almost any boy from \"old Jessie's\" unambitious establishment would have done. But, plain and substantial as my schooling was, I have ever felt that I was defrauded of the better part of education--the classics, languages, literature and modern science, which furnish the mind and extend the boundaries of thought.  \"Jessie\" continued his interest in his boys long after they left school. He was proud of those who made their way.  I remember well the warmth of his greeting and the kind look of his mild blue eyes when, after I had gone out into the world, I sometimes revisited him.  But my school life was not all happiness.  In the school there was an almost brutal element of roughness, and fights were frequent; not only in our own, but between ours and neighbouring schools.  Regular pitched battles were fought with sticks and staves and stones.  I shrunk from fighting but could not escape it."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17299"],["title","Fifty Years of Railway Life in England, Scotland and Ireland (#2)"],["body"," in our own playground I was forced to fight.  Every new boy had to do it, sooner or later. Fortunately on the second occasion I came off victor, much to my surprise.  How I managed to beat my opponent I never could understand. Anyhow the victory gave me a better standing in the school, though it did not lessen in the least my hatred of the battles that raged periodically with other schools.  I never had to fight again except as an unwilling participant in our foreign warfare.     CHAPTER III. THE MIDLAND RAILWAY AND \"KING HUDSON\"   In the year 1851 the Midland Railway was 521 miles long; it is now 2,063. Then its capital was 15,800,000, against 130,000,000 pounds to-day.  Then the gross revenue was 1,186,000 and now it has reached 15,960,000 pounds. When I say _now_, I refer to 1913, the year prior to the war, as since then, owing to Government control, non-division of through traffic and curtailment of accounts, the actual receipts earned by individual companies are not published, and, indeed, are not known.  Eighteen hundred and fifty-one was a period of anxiety to the Midland and to railway companies generally.  Financial depression had succeeded a time of wild excitement, and the Midland dividend had fallen from seven to two per cent.!  It was the year of the great Exhibition, which Lord Cholmondeley considered _the_ event of modern times and many over-sanguine people expected it to inaugurate a universal peace.  On the other hand Carlyle uttered fierce denunciations against it.  It certainly excited far more interest than has any exhibition since.  Then, nothing of the kind had ever before been seen.  Railway expectations ran high; immense traffic receipts, sorely needed, ought to have swelled the coffers of the companies.  But no! vast numbers of people certainly travelled to London, but a mad competition, as foolish almost as the preceding _mania_, set in, and passenger fares were again and again reduced, till expected profits disappeared and loss and disappointment were the only result.  The policy of Parliament in encouraging the construction of rival railway routes and in fostering competition in the supposed interest of the public was, even in those early days, bearing fruit--dead sea fruit, as many a luckless holder of railway stock learned to his cost.  Railway shareholders throughout the kingdom were growing angry.  In the case of the Midland--they appointed a committee of inquiry, and the directors assented to the appointment.  This committee was to examine and report upon the general and financial conditions of the company, and was invested with large powers.  About the same time also interviews took place between the Midland and the London and North-Western, with the object of arranging an amalgamation of the two systems.  Some progress was made, but no formal _engagement_ resulted, and so a very desirable union, between an aristocratic bridegroom and a democratic bride, remained unaccomplished.  Mr. Ellis was chairman of the Midland at this time and Mr. George Carr Glyn, afterwards the first Lord Wolverton, occupied a similar position on the Board of the London and North-Western.  Mr. Ellis had succeeded Mr. Hudson--the \"_Railway King_,\" so christened by Sydney Smith.  Mr. Hudson in 1844 was chairman of the first shareholders' meeting of the Midland Railway.  Prior to that date the Midland consisted of three separate railways.  In 1849 Mr. Hudson presided for the last time at a Midland meeting, and in the following year resigned his office of chairman of the company.  The story of the meteoric reign of the \"_Railway King_\" excited much interest when I was young, and it may not be out of place to touch upon some of the incidents of his career.  George Hudson was born in 1800, served his apprenticeship in the cathedral city of York and subsequently became a linendraper there and a man of property.  Many years afterwards he is reported to have said that the happiest days of his life passed while he stood behind his counter using the yardstick, a statement which should perhaps only be accepted under reservation.  He was undoubtedly a man of a bold and adventurous spirit, possessed of an ambition which soared far above the measuring of calicoes or the retailing of ribbons; but perhaps the observation was tinged by the environment of later and less happy days when his star had set, his kingly reign come to an end, and when possibly vain regrets had embittered his existence.  It was, I should imagine, midst the fierceness of the strife and fury of the _mania_ times, when his powerful personality counted for so much, that he reached the zenith of his happiness.  [George Hudson: hudson.jpg]  Whilst conducting in York his linendraper business, a relation died and left him money.  The railway boom had then begun.  He flung his yardstick behind him and entered the railway fray.  The Liverpool and Manchester line and its wonderful success--it paid ten per cent.--greatly impressed the public mind, and the good people of York determined they would have a railway to London.  A committee was appointed to carry out the project.  On this committee Mr. Hudson was placed, and it was mainly owing to his energy and skill that the scheme came to a successful issue.  He was rewarded by being made chairman of the company.  This was his entrance into the railway world where, for a time, he was monarch.  He must have been a man of shrewdness and capacity.  It is recorded that he acquired the land for the York to London railway at an average cost of 1,750 pounds per mile whilst that of the North Midland cost over 5,000 pounds.  On the 1st July, 1840, this linendraper of York had the proud pleasure of seeing the first train from York to London start on its journey.  From this achievement he advanced to others.  He and his friends obtained the lease, for thirty-one years, of a rival line, which turned out a great financial success.  His enterprise and energy were boundless.  It is said that his bold spirit, his capacity for work and his great influence daunted his most determined opponents.  For instance, the North Midland railway, part predecessor of _the_ Midland, was involved in difficulty.  He appeared before the shareholders, offered, if his advice and methods were adopted, to guarantee double the then dividend.  His offer was accepted and he was made chairman, and from that position became chairman, and for a time dictator, of the amalgamated Midland system.  Clearly his business abilities were great; his reforms were bold and drastic, and success attended his efforts.  He soon became the greatest railway authority in England.  For a time the entire railway system in the north was under his control, and the confidence reposed in him was unbounded.  He was the lion of the day: princes, peers and prelates, capitalists and fine ladies sought his society, paid homage to his power, besought his advice and lavished upon him unstinted adulation.  In 1845 the railway mania was at its height.  It is said that during two or three months of that year as much as 100,000 pounds per week were expended in advertisements in connection with railway promotions, railway meetings and railway matters generally.  Scarcely credible this, but so it is seriously stated.  Huge sums were wasted in the promotion and construction of British railways in early days, from which, in their excessive capital cost, they suffer now.  In the _mania_ period railways sprang into existence so quickly that, to use the words of Robert Stephenson, they \"appeared like the realisation of fabled powers or the magician's wand.\"  The _Illustrated London News_ of the day said: \"Railway speculation has become the sole object of the world--cupidity is aroused and roguery shields itself under its name, as a more safe and rapid way of gaining its ends.  Abroad, as well as at home, has it proved the rallying point of all rascality--the honest man is carried away by the current and becomes absorbed in the vortex; the timid, the quiet, the moral are, after some hesitation, caught in the whirlpool and follow those whom they have watched with pity and derision.\"  Powers were granted by Parliament in the year 1845 to construct no less than 2,883 miles of new railway at an expenditure of about 44,000,000 pounds; and in the next year (1846) applications were made to Parliament for authority to raise 389,000,000 pounds for the construction of further lines.  These powers were granted to the extent of 4,790 miles at a cost of about 120,000,000 pounds.  Soon there came a change; disaster followed success; securities fell; dividends diminished or disappeared altogether or, as was in some cases discovered, were paid out of capital, and disappointment and ruin followed.  King Hudson's methods came under a fierce fire of criticism; adulation was succeeded by abuse and he was disgraced and dethroned.  A writer of the day said, \"Mr. Hudson is neither better nor worse than the morality of his time.\"  From affluence he came to want, and in his old age a fund was raised sufficient to purchase him an annuity of 600 pounds a year.  About this time, that most useful Institution the Railway Clearing House received Parliamentary sanction.  The _Railway Clearing System Act_ 1850 gave it statutory recognition.  Its functions have been defined thus: \"To settle and adjust the receipts arising from railway traffic within, or partly within, the United Kingdom, and passing over more than one railway within the United Kingdom, booked or invoiced at throughout rates of fares.\"  The system had then been in existence, in a more or less informal way, for about eight years.  Mr. Allport, on one occasion, said that whilst he was with the Birmingham and Derby railway (before he became general manager of the Midland) the process of settlement of receipts for through traffic was tedious and difficult, and it occurred to him that a system should be adopted similar to that which existed in London and was known "]]]
