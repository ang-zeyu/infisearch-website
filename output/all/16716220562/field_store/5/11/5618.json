Sudatories of the other kind are found near every Indian lodge, and consist of a few willow-rods stuck into the ground, both ends being bent over. The process gone through while sweating is the same in both kinds of lodges, with the only difference as to time. The ceremonies mentioned 4-13. all refer to sweating in the mourners' sweat-lodges. The sudatories of the Oregonians have no analogy with the _estufas_ of the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico, as far as their construction is concerned.  586, 1. lápa spû'klish, two sweat-lodges, stands for two _kinds_ of sweat-lodges.  586, 5. shashámoks=lólatko forms _one_ compound word: one who, or: those who have lost relatives by death; cf. ptísh=lûlsh, pgísh=lûlsh; hishuákga ptísh=lúlatk, male orphan whose father has died. In the same manner, ḵĕlekátko stands here as a participle referring simultaneously to híshuaksh and to snáwedsh wénuitk, and can be rendered by \"_bereaved_\". Shashámoks, distr. form of shá-amoks, is often pronounced sheshámaks. Túmi etc. means, that many others accompany to the sweat-lodge, into which about six persons can crowd themselves, bereaved husbands, wives or parents, because the deceased were related to them.  586, 7. Shiúlakiank etc. For developing steam the natives collect only such stones for heating as are neither too large nor too small; a medium size seeming most appropriate for concentrating the largest amount of heat. The old sweat-lodges are surrounded with large accumulations of stones which, to judge from their blackened exterior, have served the purpose of generating steam; they weigh not over 3 to 5 pounds in the average, and in the vicinity travelers discover many small cairns, not over four feet high, and others lying in ruins. The shrubbery around the sudatory is in many localities tied up with willow wisps and ropes.  586, 11. Spukli-uápka mā'ntch means that the sweating-process is repeated many times during the five days of observance; they sweat at least twice a day.         *       *       *       *       *    A DOG'S REVENGE.

NOTES.  588, 24. This word \"hduze\" means _to take_ or _hold one's own;_ and is most commonly applied to a man's taking a wife, or a woman a husband. Here it may mean either that one who starts in a wicked course consorts with others \"more wicked than himself,\" or that he himself grows in the bad and takes hold of the greater forms of evil--_marries_ himself to the wicked one.  It will be noted from this specimen of Dakota that there are some particles in the language which cannot be represented in a translation. The \"do\" used at the end of phrases or sentences is only for emphasis and to round up a period. It belongs mainly to the language of young men. \"Wo\" and \"po\" are the signs of the imperative.   TRANSLATION.  There was a dog; and there was an old woman who had a pack of dried meat laid away. This the dog knew; and, when he supposed the old woman was asleep, he went there at night. But the old woman was aware of his coming and so kept watch, and, as the dog thrust his head under the tent, she struck him across the face and made a great gash, which swelled greatly.  The next morning a companion dog came and attempted to talk with him. But the dog was sullen and silent. The visitor said: \"Tell me what makes you so heart-sick.\" To which he replied: \"Be still, an old woman has treated me badly.\" \"What did she do to you?\" He answered: \"An old woman had a pack of dried meat; this I saw and went for it; and when it was now far in the night, and I supposed she was asleep, I went there and poked my head under the tent. But she was lying awake and cried out: 'Shoo! what are you doing here?' and struck me on the head and wounded me as you see.\"  Whereupon the other dog said: \"Alas! Alas! she has treated you badly, verily we will eat up her pack of meat. Call an assembly: call _Water-mist_ (i.e., rain); call _Bite-off-silently_; call _Strong-neck_; call _Sharp-knife_.\" So he invited them all. And when they had all arrived, he said: \"Come on! an old woman has treated this friend badly; bestir yourselves; before the night is past, the pack of dried meat which she prizes so much, and on account of which she has thus dealt with our friend, that we will eat all up\".  Then the one who is called _Rain-mist_ caused it to rain, and it rained all the day through until dark; and the tent was all drenched, and the holes of the tent-pins were thoroughly softened. Then _Bite-off-silently_ bit off all the lower tent-fastenings, but he did it so quietly that the old woman knew nothing of it. Then _Strong-neck_ came and seized the pack with his mouth, and carried it far away. Whereupon _Sharp-knife_ came and ripped the pack through the middle; and so, while it was yet night, they ate up the old woman's pack of dried meat.  _Moral_.--A common thief becomes worse and worse by attaching himself to more daring companions.

PART I  PART II     A GREAT EMERGENCY.  CHAPTER I.  RUPERT'S LECTURES—THE OLD YELLOW LEATHER BOOK.   We were very happy—I, Rupert, Henrietta, and Baby Cecil. The only thing we found fault with in our lives was that there were so few events in them.  It was particularly provoking, because we were so well prepared for events—any events. Rupert prepared us. He had found a fat old book in the garret, bound in yellow leather, at the end of which were \"Directions how to act with presence of mind in any emergency;\" and he gave lectures out of this in the kitchen garden.  Rupert was twelve years old. He was the eldest. Then came Henrietta, then I, and last of all Baby Cecil, who was only four. The day I was nine years old, Rupert came into the nursery, holding up his handsome head with the dignified air which became him so well, that I had more than once tried to put it on myself before the nursery looking-glass, and said to me, \"You are quite old enough now, Charlie, to learn what to do whatever happens; so every half-holiday, when I am not playing cricket, I'll teach you presence of mind near the cucumber frame, if you're punctual. I've put up a bench.\"  I thanked him warmly, and the next day he put his head into the nursery at three o'clock in the afternoon, and said—\"The lecture.\"  I jumped up, and so did Henrietta.  \"It's not for girls,\" said Rupert; \"women are not expected to do things when there's danger.\"  \"_We_ take care of _them_\" said I, wondering if my mouth looked like Rupert's when I spoke, and whether my manner impressed Henrietta as much as his impressed me. She sat down again and only said, \"I stayed in all Friday afternoon, and worked in bed on Saturday morning to finish your net.\"  \"Come along,\" said Rupert. \"You know I'm very much obliged to you for the net; it's a splendid one.\"  \"I'll bring a camp-stool if there's not room on the bench,\" said Henrietta cheerfully.  \"People never take camp-stools to lectures,\" said Rupert, and when we got to the cucumber frame we found that the old plank, which he had raised on inverted flower-pots, would have held a much larger audience than he had invited. Opposite to it was a rhubarb-pot, with the round top of a barrel resting on it. On this stood a glass of water. A delightful idea thrilled through me, suggested by an imperfect remembrance of a lecture on chemistry which I had attended.  \"Will there be experiments?\" I whispered.  \"I think not,\" Henrietta replied. \"There are glasses of water at the missionary meetings, and there are no experiments.\"  Meanwhile Rupert had been turning over the leaves of the yellow leather book. To say the truth, I think he was rather nervous; but if we have a virtue among us it is that of courage; and after dropping the book twice, and drinking all the water at a draught, he found his place, and began.  \"_How to act in an emergency_.\"  \"What's an emergency?\" I asked. I was very proud of being taught by Rupert, and anxious to understand everything as we went along.  \"You shouldn't interrupt,\" said Rupert, frowning. I am inclined now to think that he could not answer my question off-hand; for though he looked cross then, after referring to the book he answered me: \"It's a fire, or drowning, or an apoplectic fit, or anything of that sort.\" After which explanation, he hurried on. If what he said next came out of his own head, or whether he had learned it by heart, I never knew.  \"There is no stronger sign of good-breeding than presence of mind in an—\"  \"—apoplectic fit,\" I suggested. I was giving the keenest attention, and Rupert had hesitated, the wind having blown over a leaf too many of the yellow leather book.  \"An _emergency_,\" he shouted, when he had found his place. \"Now we'll have one each time. The one for to-day is—How to act in a case of drowning.\"  To speak the strict truth, I would rather not have thought about drowning. I had my own private horror over a neighbouring mill-dam, and I had once been very much frightened by a spring-tide at the sea; but cowardice is not an indulgence for one of my race, so I screwed up my lips and pricked my ears to learn my duty in the unpleasant emergency of drowning.  \"It doesn't mean being drowned yourself,\" Rupert continued, \"but what to do when another person has been drowned.\"  The emergency was undoubtedly easier, and I gave a cheerful attention as Rupert began to question us.  \"Supposing a man had been drowned in the canal, and was brought ashore, and you were the only people there, what would you do with him?\"  I was completely nonplussed. \"I felt quite sure I could do nothing with him, he would be so heavy; but I felt equally certain that this was not the answer which Rupert expected, so I left the question to Henrietta's readier wit. She knitted her thick eyebrows for some minutes, partly with perplexity, and partly because of the sunshine reflected from the cucumber frame, and then said,  \"We should bury him in a vault; Charlie and I _couldn't_ dig a grave deep enough.\"  I admired Henrietta's foresight, but Rupert was furious.  \"How _silly_ you are!\" he exclaimed, knocking over the top of the rhubarb-pot table and the empty glass in his wrath. \"Of course I don't mean a dead man. I mean what would you do to bring a partly drowned man to life again?\"  \"That wasn't what you _said_,\" cried Henrietta, tossing her head.  \"I let you come to my lecture,\" grumbled Rupert bitterly, as he stooped to set his table right, \"and this is the way you behave!\"  \"I'm very sorry, Rupert dear!\" said Henrietta. \"Indeed, I only mean to do my best, and I do like your lecture so very much!\"  \"So do I,\" I cried, \"very, very much!\" And by a simultaneous impulse Henrietta and I both clapped our hands vehemently. This restored Rupert's self-complacency, and he bowed and continued the lecture. From this we learned that the drowned man should be turned over on his face to let the canal water run out of his mouth and ears, and that his wet clothes should be got off, and he should be made dry and warm as quickly as possible, and placed in a comfortable position, with the head and shoulders slightly raised. All this seemed quite feasible to us. Henrietta had dressed and undressed lots of dolls, and I pictured myself filling a hot-water bottle at the kitchen boiler with an air of responsibility that should scare all lighter-minded folk. But the directions for \"restoring breathing\" troubled our sincere desire to learn; and this even though Henrietta practised for weeks afterwards upon me. I represented the drowned man, and she drew my arms above my head for \"_inspiration_,\" and counted \"one, two;\" and doubled them and drove them back for \"_expiration_;\" but it tickled, and I laughed, and we could not feel at all sure that it would have made the drowned man breathe again.  Meanwhile Rupert went on with the course of lectures, and taught us how to behave in the event of a fire in the house, an epidemic in the neighbourhood, a bite from a mad dog, a chase by a mad bull, broken limbs, runaway horses, a chimney on fire, or a young lady burning to death. The lectures were not only delightful in themselves, but they furnished us with a whole set of new games, for Henrietta and I zealously practised every emergency as far as the nature of things would allow. Covering our faces with wet cloths to keep off the smoke, we crept on our hands and knees to rescue a fancy cripple from an"]]]
