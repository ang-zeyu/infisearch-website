Her curiosity was so great that, without considering how uncivil it was to leave her guests, she went down a little back staircase, with such excessive haste that twice or thrice she came near breaking her neck. Having reached the closet-door, she stood still for some time, thinking of her husband's orders, and considering that unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient; but the temptation was so strong she could not overcome it. She then took the little key, and opened the door, trembling. At first she could not see anything plainly, because the windows were shut. After some moments she began to perceive that several dead women were scattered about the floor. (These were all the wives whom Blue Beard had married and murdered, one after the other, because they did not obey his orders about the closet on the ground floor.) She thought she surely would die for fear, and the key, which she pulled out of the lock, fell out of her hand.  After having somewhat recovered from the shock, she picked up the key, locked the door, and went upstairs into her chamber to compose herself; but she could not rest, so much was she frightened.  Having observed that the key of the closet was stained, she tried two or three times to wipe off the stain, but the stain would not come out. In vain did she wash it, and even rub it with soap and sand. The stain still remained, for the key was a magic key, and she could never make it quite clean; when the stain was gone off from one side, it came again on the other.  Blue Beard returned from his journey that same evening, and said he had received letters upon the road, informing him that the business which called him away was ended to his advantage. His wife did all she could to convince him she was delighted at his speedy return.  Next morning he asked her for the keys, which she gave him, but with such a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened.  \"How is it,\" said he, \"that the key of my closet is not among the rest?\"  \"I must certainly,\" said she, \"have left it upstairs upon the table.\"  \"Do not fail,\" said Blue Beard, \"to bring it to me presently.\"  After having put off doing it several times, she was forced to bring him the key. Blue Beard, having examined it, said to his wife:--  \"How comes this stain upon the key?\"  \"I do not know,\" cried the poor woman, paler than death.  \"You do not know!\" replied Blue Beard. \"I very well know. You wished to go into the cabinet? Very well, madam; you shall go in, and take your place among the ladies you saw there.\"  She threw herself weeping at her husband's feet, and begged his pardon with all the signs of a true repentance for her disobedience. She would have melted a rock, so beautiful and sorrowful was she; but Blue Beard had a heart harder than any stone.  \"You must die, madam,\" said he, \"and that at once.\"  \"Since I must die,\" answered she, looking upon him with her eyes all bathed in tears, \"give me some little time to say my prayers.\"  \"I give you,\" replied Blue Beard, \"half a quarter of an hour, but not one moment more.\"  When she was alone she called out to her sister, and said to her:--  \"Sister Anne,\"--for that was her name,--\"go up, I beg you, to the top of the tower, and look if my brothers are not coming; they promised me they would come to-day, and if you see them, give them a sign to make haste.\"  Her sister Anne went up to the top of the tower, and the poor afflicted wife cried out from time to time:--  \"Anne, sister Anne, do you see any one coming?\"  And sister Anne said:--  \"I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which looks green.\"  In the meanwhile Blue Beard, holding a great sabre in his hand, cried to his wife as loud as he could:--  \"Come down instantly, or I shall come up to you.\"  \"One moment longer, if you please,\" said his wife; and then she cried out very softly, \"Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see anybody coming?\"  And sister Anne answered:--  \"I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which is green.\"  \"Come down quickly,\" cried Blue Beard, \"or I will come up to you.\"  \"I am coming,\" answered his wife; and then she cried, \"Anne, sister Anne, dost thou not see any one coming?\"  \"I see,\" replied sister Anne, \"a great dust, which comes from this side.\"  \"Are they my brothers?\"  \"Alas! no, my sister, I see a flock of sheep.\"  \"Will you not come down?\" cried Blue Beard.  \"One moment longer,\" said his wife, and then she cried out, \"Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see nobody coming?\"  \"I see,\" said she, \"two horsemen, but they are yet a great way off.\"  \"God be praised,\" replied the poor wife, joyfully; \"they are my brothers; I will make them a sign, as well as I can, for them to make haste.\"  Then Blue Beard bawled out so loud that he made the whole house tremble. The distressed wife came down and threw herself at his feet, all in tears, with her hair about her shoulders.  \"All this is of no help to you,\" says Blue Beard: \"you must die;\" then, taking hold of her hair with one hand, and lifting up his sword in the air with the other, he was about to take off her head. The poor lady, turning about to him, and looking at him with dying eyes, desired him to afford her one little moment to her thoughts.  \"No, no,\" said he, \"commend thyself to God,\" and again lifting his arm--  At this moment there was such a loud knocking at the gate that Blue Beard stopped suddenly. The gate was opened, and presently entered two horsemen, who, with sword in hand, ran directly to Blue Beard. He knew them to be his wife's brothers, one a dragoon, the other a musketeer. He ran away immediately, but the two brothers pursued him so closely that they overtook him before he could get to the steps of the porch. There they ran their swords through his body, and left him dead. The poor wife was almost as dead as her husband, and had not strength enough to arise and welcome her brothers.  Blue Beard had no heirs, and so his wife became mistress of all his estate. She made use of one portion of it to marry her sister Anne to a young gentleman who had loved her a long while; another portion to buy captains' commissions for her brothers; and the rest to marry herself to a very worthy gentleman, who made her forget the sorry time she had passed with Blue Beard.     THE FAIRY.   Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters. The elder was so much like her, both in looks and character, that whoever saw the daughter saw the mother. They were both so disagreeable and so proud that there was no living with them. The younger, who was the very picture of her father for sweetness of temper and virtue, was withal one of the most beautiful girls ever seen. As people naturally love their own likeness, this mother doted on her elder daughter, and at the same time had a great aversion for the younger. She made her eat in the kitchen and work continually.  Among other things, this unfortunate child had to go twice a day to draw water more than a mile and a half from the house, and bring home a pitcherful of it. One day, as she was at this fountain, there came to her a poor woman, who begged of her to let her drink.  \"Oh, yes, with all my heart, Goody,\" said this pretty little girl. Rinsing the pitcher at once, she took some of the clearest water from the fountain, and gave it to her, holding up the pitcher all the while, that she might drink the easier.  The good woman having drunk, said to her:--  \"You are so pretty, so good and courteous, that I cannot help giving you a gift.\" For this was a fairy, who had taken the form of a poor country-woman, to see how far the civility and good manners of this pretty girl would go. \"I will give you for gift,\" continued the Fairy, \"that, at every word you speak, there shall come out of your mouth either a flower or a jewel.\"  When this pretty girl returned, her mother scolded at her for staying so long at the fountain.  \"I beg your pardon, mamma,\" said the poor girl, \"for not making more haste.\"  And in speaking these words there came out of her mouth two roses, two pearls, and two large diamonds.  \"What is it I see there?\" said her mother, quite astonished. \"I think pearls and diamonds come out of the girl's mouth! How happens this, my child?\"  This was the first time she had ever called her \"my child.\"  The girl told her frankly all the matter, not without dropping out great numbers of diamonds.  \"Truly,\" cried the mother, \"I must send my own dear child thither. Fanny, look at what comes out of your sister's mouth when she speaks. Would you not be glad, my dear, to have the same gift? You have only to go and draw water out of the fountain, and when a poor woman asks you to let her drink, to give it to her very civilly.\"  [Illustration: \"WITH ALL MY HEART, GOODY.\" p. 75.]  \"I should like to see myself going to the fountain to draw water,\" said this ill-bred minx.  \"I insist you shall go,\" said the mother, \"and that instantly.\"  She went, but grumbled all the way, taking with her the best silver tankard in the house.  She no sooner reached the fountain than she saw coming out of the wood, a magnificently dressed lady, who came up to her, and asked to drink. This was the same fairy who had appeared to her sister, but she had now taken the air and dress of a princess, to see how far this girl's rudeness would go.  \"Am I come hither,\" said the proud, ill-bred girl, \"to serve you with water, pray? I suppose this silver tankard was brought purely for your ladyship, was it? However, you may drink out of it, if you have a fancy.\"  \"You are scarcely polite,\" answered the fairy, without anger. \"Well, then, since you are so disobliging, I give you for gift that at every word you speak there shall come out of your mouth a snake or a toad.\"  So soon as her"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17212"],["title","Michelangelo (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net             [Illustration: MICHELANGELO BUONAROTTI (ATTRIBUTED TO BUGIARDINI)    _Uffizi Gallery, Florence_]                         The Riverside Art Series                                MICHELANGELO                     A COLLECTION OF FIFTEEN PICTURES                      AND A PORTRAIT OF THE MASTER                         WITH INTRODUCTION AND                             INTERPRETATION                                      BY                             ESTELLE M.

PREFACE   In making a collection of prints from the works of Michelangelo, it is impossible to secure any wide variety, either in subject or method of treatment. We are dealing here with a master whose import is always serious, and whose artistic individuality is strongly impressed on all his works, either in sculpture or painting. Our selections represent his best work in both arts. These are arranged, not in chronological order, but in a way which will lead the student from the subjects most familiar and easily understood to those which are more abstract and difficult.

Michelangelo's place in the world of art is altogether unique. His supremacy is acknowledged by all, but is understood by a few only. In the presence of his works none can stand unimpressed, yet few dare to claim any intimate knowledge of his art. The quality so vividly described in the Italian word _terribilità_ is his predominant trait. He is one to awe rather than to attract, to overwhelm rather than to delight. The spectator must needs exclaim with humility, \"Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.\" Yet while Michelangelo can never be a popular artist in the ordinary sense of the word, the powerful influence which he exercises seems constantly increasing. Year by year there are more who, drawn by the strange fascination of his genius, seek to read the meaning of his art.  His subjects are all profoundly serious in intention. Life was no holiday to this strenuous spirit; it was a stern conflict with the powers of darkness in which such heroes as David and Moses were needed. Like the old Hebrew prophets, the artist poured out his soul in a vehement protest against evil, and a stirring call to righteousness.  Considered both as a sculptor and a painter, Michelangelo's one vehicle of expression was the human body. His works are \"form-poems,\" through which he uttered his message to mankind. As he writes in one of his own sonnets,      \"Nor hath God deigned to show himself elsewhere     More clearly than in human forms sublime.\"  In his art, says the critic Symonds, \"a well-shaped hand, or throat, or head, a neck superbly poised on an athletic chest, the sway of the trunk above the hips, the starting of the muscles on the flank, the tendons of the ankle, the outline of the shoulder when the arm is raised, the backward bending of the loins, the curves of a woman's breast, the contours of a body careless in repose or strained for action, were all words pregnant with profoundest meaning, whereby fit utterance might be given to thoughts that raise man near to God.\"  Learning his first lessons in art of the Greeks, he soon possessed himself of the great principles of classic sculpture. Then he boldly struck out his own path; his was a spirit to lead, not to follow. With the subtle Greek sense of line and form, he united an entirely new motif. In contrast to the ideal of repose which was the leading canon of the Greeks, his chosen ideal was one of action. Moreover, he invariably fixed upon some decisive moment in the action he had to represent, a moment which suggests both the one preceding and the one following, and which gives us the whole story in epitome. Thus in the David we see preparation, aim, and action. It was a far cry from the elegant calm of the Greek god to the restless energy of this rugged youth.  Even with seated figures he followed the same principle. Moses and the Duke Giuliano are ready to rise to their feet if need be. In his frescoes we again find the same motif,--Adam rising to his feet in obedience to the Creator's summons, and Christ the Judge sweeping asunder the multitudes.  In his love of action and his passion for the human form lay the elements of his art most easily lending themselves to exaggeration. That the master did indeed permit himself to be carried beyond due limits in these matters is seen by comparing the grandeur of the Sistine ceiling with the mannerisms of the Last Judgment. The interval between was \"the time of his best technical and spiritual creativeness,\" when he produced the statues of the Sacristy of S. Lorenzo.  It was characteristic of Michelangelo's impetuous nature to spend his enthusiasm upon the early stages of his work, and leave it unfinished. This unfinished effect of many of his marbles seems to bring us in closer touch with his methods as a sculptor. Nor is a rough surface here and there inharmonious with the rugged character of his conceptions. Moreover, as a critic[1] has pointed out, the polished and rough portions enhance each other, giving a variety in the light and shadow which is pictorial in effect.  [Footnote 1: See notes on the Life of Michelangelo Buonarotti in the Blashfield-Hopkins edition of Vasari.]  To a man of Michelangelo's austere temperament, intensely masculine in his predilections, the beauty of womanhood was not fully revealed. His sibyls can scarcely be counted as women; they belong to a world of their own, neither human nor divine. It was only in his few Madonnas that we can trace his feminine ideal, an ideal noble and dignified, rather than beautiful. The Madonna of the bas-relief is proud rather than tender, the Virgin of the Pietà is grand rather than lovely. These were works of his youth. Later in life, when he had known the blessing of a good woman's friendship, he developed a new ideal in the gentle and delicate womanhood of the Virgin of the Last Judgment.  Michelangelo has been compared to two great masters of dissimilar arts, Milton and Beethoven. There are striking points of similarity in the men themselves, in stern uprightness of character, in scorn of the low and trivial, in lofty idealism. The art of all three is too far above the common level to be popular; it requires too much thinking to attract the superficial. In poetry, in music, and in sculpture, all three utter the profoundest truths of human experience, expressed in grand and solemn harmonies.     II. ON BOOKS OF REFERENCE.   The original materials for the study of Michelangelo's life and work are the two biographies by his contemporaries, Vasari and Condivi. Vasari's was the first of these (1550), and like the other portions of his \"Lives of the Painters\" contained many inaccuracies. It was to correct these that Condivi published his little book a few years later. This rival effort aroused Vasari's wrath, and after Michelangelo's death he issued an enlarged edition of his own book, unscrupulously incorporating all that was valuable in Condivi's work, and adding thereto many reminiscences of the master's life. The fame of Vasari's monumental work caused Condivi's little book to be entirely forgotten for long years, and it has been one of the tasks of modern scholarship to restore it to its true place. Even now, however, there is no available form of Condivi's biography for American readers, though Vasari's \"Lives\" in Mrs. Foster's translation is found in most libraries. The latest edition of Vasari, published in 1897, contains annotations by Mr. and Mrs. E.H. Blashfield, and A.A. Hopkins, which correct all the statements in the light of recent authorities.  Far more valuable even than the early biographies is the mass of existing documents of the Buonarotti family, including contracts, letters, poems, and memoranda, and containing data for a full and exact biography of the master. Unfortunately, however, this great storehouse of material has been for all these centuries a sealed treasure, given up only little by little, to successive generations of scholars. When Hermann Grimm wrote his celebrated \"Life of Michael Angelo\" (in 1860), the only original material accessible to him was the collection of letters in the British Museum. His volumes are still read with interest and profit, though it is to be regretted that they should be reprinted without any editorial comments to connect formerly received opinions with later conclusions.
