NOTES.  581, 1. Mactciñge, the Rabbit, or Si¢e-makaⁿ (meaning uncertain), is the hero of numerous myths of several tribes. He is the deliverer of mankind from different tyrants. One of his opponents is Ictinike, the maker of this world, according to the Iowas. The Rabbit's grandmother is Mother Earth, who calls mankind her children.  581, 7. a¢ai te aⁿ. The conclusion of this sentence seems odd to the collector, but its translation given with this myth is that furnished by the Indian informant.  581, 12. haⁿ+egaⁿtcĕ-qtci, \"ve--ry early in the morning.\" The prolongation of the first syllable adds to the force of the adverb \"qtci,\" _very_.  582, 3. hebe ihe a¢e-hnaⁿ-biama. The Rabbit tried to obey the Sun; but each time that he attempted it, he was so much afraid of him that he passed by a little to one side. He could not go directly to him.  582, 4. 5. maⁿciaha aia¢a-biama. When the Rabbit rushed forward with bowed head, and cut the bow-string, the Sun's departure was so rapid that \"he had _already_ gone on high.\"   ABBREVIATIONS USED IN THIS MYTH.    cv.    curvilinear.   mv.    moving.   st.    sitting.   sub.   subject.   ob.    object.   TRANSLATION.  Once upon a time the Rabbit dwelt in a lodge with no one but his grandmother. And it was his custom to go hunting very early in the morning. No matter how early in the morning he went, a person with very long feet had been along, leaving a trail. And he (the Rabbit), wished to know him. \"Now,\" thought he, \"I will go in advance of the person.\" Having arisen very early in the morning, he departed. Again it happened that the person had been along, leaving a trail. Then he (the Rabbit) went home. Said he, \"Grandmother, though I arrange for myself to go first, a person anticipates me (every time). Grandmother, I will make a snare and catch him.\" \"Why should you do it?\" said she. \"I hate the person,\" he said. And the Rabbit departed. When he went, the foot-prints had been along again. And he lay waiting for night (to come). And he made a noose of a bow-string, putting it in the place where the foot-prints used to be seen. And he reached there very early in the morning for the purpose of looking at his trap. And it happened that he had caught the Sun. Running very fast, he went homeward to tell it. \"Grandmother, I have caught something or other, but it scares me. Grandmother, I wished to take my bow-string, but I was scared every time,\" said he. He went thither with a knife. And he got very near it. \"You have done wrong; why have you done so? Come hither and untie me,\" said the Sun. The Rabbit, although he went thither, was afraid, and kept on passing partly by him (or, continued going by a little to one side). And making a rush, with his head bent down (and his arm stretched out), he cut the bow-string with the knife. And the Sun had already gone on high. And the Rabbit had the hair between his shoulders scorched yellow, it having been hot upon him (as he stooped to cut the bow-string). (And the Rabbit arrived at home.) \"Itcitci+!! O grandmother, the heat has left nothing of me,\" said he. She said, \"Oh! my grandchild! I think that the heat has left nothing of him for me.\" (From that time the rabbit has had a singed spot on his back, between the shoulders.)         *       *       *       *       *     DETAILS OF A CONJURER'S PRACTICE.

The meaning of the sentence is: they raise their voices to call him out. Conjurers are in the habit of fastening a fox-skin outside of their lodges, as a business sign, and to let it dangle from a rod stuck out in an oblique direction.  583, 3. tchélχa. During the treatment of a patient, who stays in a winter house, the lodge is often shut up at the top, and the people sit in a circle inside in utter darkness.  583, 5. liukiámnank. The women and all who take a part in the chorus usually sit in a circle around the conjurer and his assistant; the suffix -mna indicates close proximity. Nadshā'shak qualifies the verb winóta.  583, 5. tchûtchtníshash. The distributive form of tchû't’na refers to each of the _various_ manipulations performed by the conjurer on the patient.  584, 1. mā'shish, shortened from māshípkash, mā'shipksh, like ḵ'lä'ksh from k’läkápkash.  584, 2. 3. There is a stylistic incongruity in using the distributive form, only in kukuàga (kúe, _frog_), káhaktok, and in nshendshkáne (nshekáni, npshékani, tsékani, tchékĕni, _small_), while inserting the absolute form in wishinkága (wíshink, _garter-snake_) and in ḵáḵo; mû'lkaga is more of a generic term and its distributive form is therefore not in use.  583, 2. káhaktok for ká-akt ak; ká-akt being the transposed distributive form kákat, of kát, which, what (pron. relat.).  584, 4. lgû'm. The application of remedial _drugs_ is very unfrequent in this tribe; and this is one of the reasons why the term \"conjurer\" or \"shaman\" will prove to be a better name for the medicine man than that of \"Indian doctor\".  584, 4. kû'tash etc. The conjurer introduces a louse into the eye to make it eat up the protruding white portion of the sore eye.

NOTES.  585, 1. náyäns hissuáksas: another man than the conjurers of the tribe. The objective case shows that mā'shitk has to be regarded here as the participle of an impersonal verb: mā'sha nûsh, and mā'sha nû, it ails me, I am sick.  585, 2. yá-uks is remedy in general, spiritual as well as material. Here a tamánuash song is meant by it, which, when sung by the conjurer, will furnish him the certainty if his patient is a relapse or not. There are several of these medicine-songs, but all of them (nánuk hû'k shuī'sh) when consulted point out the spider-medicine as the one to apply in this case. The spider's curing-instrument is that small piece of buckskin (ubá-ush) which has to be inserted under the patient's skin. It is called the spider's medicine because the spider-song is sung during its application.  585, 10. gutä'ga. The whole operation is concealed from the eyes of spectators by a skin or blanket stretched over the patient and the hands of the operator.  585, 10. kiatéga. The buckskin piece has an oblong or longitudinal shape in most instances, and it is passed under the skin sideways and very gradually.  585, 11. tánkĕni ak waítash.
