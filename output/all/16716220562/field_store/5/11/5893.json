According to Berossus it was of Chaldaean origin, and comprised eighty-six kings, who bore rule during 34,080 years; the first two, Evechous and Khomasbelos, reigned 2400 and 2700 years, while the later reigns did not exceed the ordinary limits of human life. An attempt was afterwards made to harmonize them with probability: the number of kings was reduced to six, and their combined reigns to 225 years. This attempt arose from a misapprehension of their true character; names and deeds, everything connected with them belongs to myth and fiction only, and is irreducible to history proper. They supplied to priests and poets material for scores of different stories, of which several have come down to us in fragments. Some are short, and serve as preambles to prayers or magical formulas; others are of some length, and may pass for real epics. The gods intervene in them, and along with kings play an important part. It is Nera, for instance, the lord of the plague, who declares war against mankind in order to punish them for having despised the authority of Anu. He makes Babylon to feel his wrath first: “The children of Babel, they were as birds, and the bird-catcher, thou wert he! thou takest them in the net, thou enclosest them, thou decimatest them--hero Nera!”  One after the other he attacks the mother cities of the Euphrates and obliges them to render homage to him--even Uruk, “the dwelling of Anu and Ishtar--the town of the priestesses, of the _almehs_, and the sacred courtesans; “then he turns upon the foreign nations and carries his ravages as far as Phoenicia. In other fragments, the hero Etana makes an attempt to raise himself to heaven, and the eagle, his companion, flies away with him, without, however, being able to bring the enterprise to a successful issue. Nimrod and his exploits are known to us from the Bible.* “He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.” Almost all the characteristics which are attributed by Hebrew tradition to Nimrod we find in G-ilgames, King of Uruk and descendant of the Shamashnapishtim who had witnessed the deluge.**       * Genesis x. 9, 10. Among the Jews and Mussulmans a complete      cycle of legends have developed around Nimrod. He built the      Tower of Babel; he threw Abraham into a fiery furnace, and      he tried to mount to heaven on the back of an eagle. Sayce      and Grivel saw in Nimrod an heroic form of Merodach, the god      of Babylonia: the majority of living Assyriologists prefer      to follow Smith’s example, and identify him with the hero      Gilgames.       ** The name of this hero is composed of three signs, which      Smith provisionally rendered Isdubar--a reading which,      modified into Gishdhubar, Gistubar, is still retained by      many Assyriologists. There have been proposed one after      another the renderings Dhubar, Namrudu, Anamarutu, Numarad,      Namrasit, all of which exhibit in the name of the hero that      of Nimrod. Pinches discovered, in 1890, what appears to be      the true signification of the three signs,Gilgamesh,      Gilgames; Sayce and Oppert have compared this name with that      of Gilgamos, a Babylonian hero, of whom. AElian has preserved      the memory. A. Jeremias continued to reject both the reading      and the identification.  Several copies of a poem, in which an unknown scribe had celebrated his exploits, existed about the middle of the VIIth century before our era in the Royal Library at Nineveh; they had been transcribed by order of Assur-banipal from a more ancient copy, and the fragments of them which have come down to us, in spite of their lacunae, enable us to restore the original text, if not in its entirety, at least in regard to the succession of events. They were divided into twelve episodes corresponding with the twelve divisions of the year, and the ancient Babylonian author was guided in his choice of these divisions by something more than mere chance. Gilgames, at first an ordinary mortal under the patronage of the gods, had himself become a god and son of the goddess Aruru: “he had seen the abyss, he had learned everything that is kept secret and hidden, he had even made known to men what had taken place before the deluge.” The sun, who had protected him in his human condition, had placed him beside himself on the judgment-seat, and delegated to him authority to pronounce decisions from which there was no appeal: he was, as it were, a sun on a small scale, before whom the kings, princes, and great ones of the earth humbly bowed their heads.* The scribes had, therefore, some authority for treating the events of his life after the model of the year, and for expressing them in twelve chants, which answered to the annual course of the sun through the twelve months.       * The identity of Gilgames with the Accadian fire-god, or      rather with the sun, was recognized from the first by H.      Rawlinson, and has been accepted since by almost all      Assyriologists. A tablet brought back by G. Smith, called      attention to by Fr. Delitzsch, and published by Haupt,      contains the remains of a hymn addressed to Gilgames, “the      powerful king, the king of the Spirits of the Earth.”  [Illustration: 057.jpg GILGAMES STRANGLES A LION.]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from an Assyrian bas-relief from      Khorsabad, in the Museum of the Louvre  The whole story is essentially an account of his struggles with Ishtar, and the first pages reveal him as already at issue with the goddess. His portrait, such as the monuments have preserved it for us, is singularly unlike the ordinary type: one would be inclined to regard it as representing an individual of a different race, a survival of some very ancient nation which had held rule on the plains of the Euphrates before the arrival of the Sumerian or Semitic* tribes.       * Smith (The Chaldaean Account of Genesis, p. 194) remarked      the difference between the representations of Gilgames and      the typical Babylonian: he concluded from this that the hero      was of Ethiopian origin. Hommel declares that his features      have neither a Sumerian nor Semitic aspect, and that they      raise an insoluble question in ethnology.  His figure is tall, broad, muscular to an astonishing degree, and expresses at once vigour and activity; his head is massive, bony, almost square, with a somewhat flattened face, a large nose, and prominent cheek-bones, the whole framed by an abundance of hair, and a thick beard symmetrically curled. All the young men of Uruk, the well-protected, were captivated by the prodigious strength and beauty of the hero; the elders of the city betook themselves to Ishtar to complain of the state of neglect to which the young generation had relegated them. “He has no longer a rival in their hearts, but thy subjects are led to battle, and Gilgames does not send one child back to his father. Night and day they cry after him: ‘It is he the shepherd of Uruk, the well-protected, he is its shepherd and master, he the powerful, the perfect and the wise.’”  Even the women did not escape the general enthusiasm: “he leaves not a single virgin to her mother, a single daughter to a warrior, a single wife to her master. Ishtar heard their complaint, the gods heard it, and cried with a loud voice to Aruru: ‘It is thou, Aruru, who hast given him birth; create for him now his fellow, that he may be able to meet him on a day when it pleaseth him, in order that they may fight with each other and Uruk may be delivered.’When Aruru heard them, she created in her heart a man of Anu. Aruru washed her hands, took a bit of clay, cast it upon the earth, kneaded it and created Babani, the warrior, the exalted scion, the man of Ninib, whose whole body is covered with hair, whose tresses are as long as those of a woman; the locks of his hair bristle on his head like those on the corn-god; he is clad in a vestment like that of the god of the fields; he browses with the gazelles, he quenches his thirst with the beasts of the field, he sports with the beasts of the waters.” Frequent representations of Eabani are found upon the monuments; he has the horns of a goat, the legs and tail of a bull.* He possessed not only the strength of a brute, but his intelligence also embraced all things, the past and the future: he would probably have triumphed over Gilgames if Shamash had not succeeded in attaching them to one another by an indissoluble tie of friendship. The difficulty was to draw these two future friends together, and to bring them face to face without their coming to blows; the god sent his courier Saidu, the hunter, to study the habits of the monster, and to find out the necessary means to persuade him to come down peaceably to Uruk. “Saidu, the hunter, proceeded to meet Eabani near the entrance of the watering-place. One day, two days, three days, Eabani met him at the entrance of the watering-place. He perceived Saidu, and his countenance darkened: he entered the enclosure, he became sad, he groaned, he cried with a loud voice, his heart was heavy, his features were distorted, sobs burst from his breast. The hunter saw from a distance that his face was inflamed with anger,” and judging it more prudent not to persevere farther in his enterprise, returned to impart to the god what he had observed.       * Smith was the first, I believe, to compare his form to      that of a satyr or faun; this comparison is rendered more      probable by the fact that the modern inhabitants of Chaldaea      believe in the existence of similar monsters. A. Jeremias      places Eabani alongside Priapus, who is generally a god of      the fields, and a clever soothsayer.

Into such regions, and to their cost, neighbouring peoples come from century to century to settle their quarrels and bring to an issue the questions of supremacy which disturb their little corner of the world. The nations around are eager for the possession of a country thus situated; it is seized upon bit by bit, and in the strife dismembered and trodden underfoot: at best the only course open to its inhabitants is to join forces with one of its invaders, and while helping the intruder to overcome the rest, to secure for themselves a position of permanent servitude. Should some unlooked-for chance relieve them from the presence of their foreign lord, they will probably be quite incapable of profiting by the respite which fortune puts in their way, or of making any effectual attempt to organize themselves in view of future attacks. They tend to become split up into numerous rival communities, of which even the pettiest will aim at autonomy, keeping up a perpetual frontier war for the sake of becoming possessed of or of retaining a glorious sovereignty over a few acres of corn in the plains, or some wooded ravines in the mountains. Year after year there will be scenes of bloody conflict, in which petty armies will fight petty battles on behalf of petty interests, but so fiercely, and with such furious animosity, that the country will suffer from the strife as much as, or even more than, from an invasion. There will be no truce to their struggles until they all fall under the sway of a foreign master, and, except in the interval between two conquests, they will have no national existence, their history being almost entirely merged in that of other nations.  From remote antiquity Syria was in the condition just described, and thus destined to become subject to foreign rule. Chaldæa, Egypt, Assyria, and Persia presided in turn over its destinies, while Macedonia and the empires of the West were only waiting their opportunity to lay hold of it. By its position it formed a kind of meeting-place where most of the military nations of the ancient world were bound sooner or later to come violently into collision. Confined between the sea and the desert, Syria offers the only route of easy access to an army marching northwards from Africa into Asia, and all conquerors, whether attracted to Mesopotamia or to Egypt by the accumulated riches on the banks of the Euphrates or the Nile, were obliged to pass through it in order to reach the object of their cupidity. It might, perhaps, have escaped this fatal consequence of its position, had the formation of the country permitted its tribes to mass themselves together, and oppose a compact body to the invading hosts; but the range of mountains which forms its backbone subdivides it into isolated districts, and by thus restricting each tribe to a narrow existence maintained among them a mutual antagonism. The twin chains, the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon, which divide the country down the centre, are composed of the same kind of calcareous rocks and sandstone, while the same sort of reddish clay has been deposited on their slopes by the glaciers of the same geological period.*       * Drake remarked in the Lebanon several varieties of      limestone, which have been carefully catalogued by Blanche      and Lartet. Above these strata, which belong to the Jurassic      formation, come reddish sandstone, then beds of very hard      yellowish limestone, and finally marl. The name Lebanon, in      Assyrian Libnana, would appear to signify the white      mountain; the Amorites called the Anti-Lebanon Saniru,      Shenir, according to the Assyrian texts and the Hebrew      books.  Arid and bare on the northern side, they sent out towards the south featureless monotonous ridges, furrowed here and there by short narrow valleys, hollowed out in places into basins or funnel-shaped ravines, which are widened year by year by the down-rush of torrents. These ridges, as they proceed southwards, become clothed with verdure and offer a more varied outline, the ravines being more thickly wooded, and the summits less uniform in contour and colouring. Lebanon becomes white and ice-crowned in winter, but none of its peaks rises to the altitude of perpetual snows: the highest of them, Mount Timarun, reaches 10,526 feet, while only three others exceed 9000.* Anti-Lebanon is, speaking generally, 1000 or 1300 feet lower than its neighbour: it becomes higher, however, towards the south, where the triple peak of Mount Hermon rises to a height of 9184 feet. The Orontes and the Litâny drain the intermediate space. The Orontes rising on the west side of the Anti-Lebanon, near the ruins of Baalbek, rushes northwards in such a violent manner, that the dwellers on its banks call it the rebel--Nahr el-Asi.** About a third of the way towards its mouth it enters a depression, which ancient dykes help to transform into a lake; it flows thence, almost parallel to the sea-coast, as far as the 36th degree of latitude. There it meets the last spurs of the Amanos, but, failing to cut its way through them, it turns abruptly to the west, and then to the south, falling into the Mediterranean after having received an increase to its volume from the waters of the Afrîn.       * Bukton-Drake, Unexplored Syria, vol. i. p. 88, attributed      to it an altitude of 9175 English feet; others estimate it      at 10,539 feet. The mountains which exceed 3000 metres are      Dahr el-Kozîb, 3046 metres; Jebel-Mislriyah, 3080 metres;      and Jebel-Makhmal or Makmal, 3040 metres. As a matter of      fact, these heights are not yet determined with the accuracy      desirable.       ** The Egyptians knew it in early times by the name of      Aûnrati, or Araûnti; it is mentioned in Assyrian      inscriptions under the name of Arantû. All are agreed in      acknowledging that this name is not Semitic, and an Aryan      origin is attributed to it, but without convincing proof;      according to Strabo (xvi. ii. § 7, p. 750), it was      originally called Typhon, and was only styled Orontes after      a certain Orontes had built the first bridge across it. The      name of Axios which it sometimes bears appears to have been      given to it by Greek colonists, in memory of a river in      Macedonia. This is probably the origin of the modern name of      Asi, and the meaning, _rebellious river_, which Arab      tradition attaches to the latter term, probably comes from a      popular etymology which likened Axios to Asi, the      identification was all the easier since it justifies the      epithet by the violence of its current.  The Litâny rises a short distance from the Orontes; it flows at first through a wide and fertile plain, which soon contracts, however, and forces it into a channel between the spurs of the"]]]
