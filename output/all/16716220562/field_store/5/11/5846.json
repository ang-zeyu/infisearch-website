It was also said that Mr. Kenneth Morrison, Auditor of the London and Birmingham line, was the first to see and proclaim the necessity for a Clearing House.  Be that as it may, the Railway Clearing House, as a practical entity, came into being in 1842.  In the beginning it only embraced nine companies, and six people were enough to do its work.  The companies were:--     London and Birmingham, Midland Counties, Birmingham and Derby, North    Midland, Leeds and Selby, York and North Midland, Hull and Selby,    Great North of England, Manchester and Leeds.  Not one of these has preserved its original name.  All have been merged in either the London and North-Western, the North-Eastern, the Midland or the Lancashire and Yorkshire.  At the present day the Clearing House consists of practically the whole of the railway companies in the United Kingdom, though some of the small and unimportant lines are outside its sphere.  Ireland has a Railway Clearing House of its own--established in the year 1848--to which practically all Irish railway companies, and they are numerous, belong; and the six principal Irish railways are members of the London Clearing House.  The English house, situated in Seymour Street, Euston Square, is an extensive establishment, and accommodates 2,500 clerks.  As I write, the number under its roof is, by war conditions, reduced to about 900. Serving with His Majesty's Forces are nearly 1,200, and about 400 have been temporarily transferred to the railway companies, to the Government service and to munition factories.  In 1842, when the Clearing House first began, the staff, as I have said, numbered six, and the companies nine.  Fifty-eight railway companies now belong to the House, and the amount of money dealt with by way of division and apportionment in the year before the war was 31,071,910 pounds.  In 1842 it was 193,246 pounds.     CHAPTER IV. FASHIONS AND MANNERS, VICTORIAN DAYS   The boy who is strong and healthy, overflowing with animal spirits, enjoys life in a way that is denied to his slighter-framed, more delicate brother.  Exercise imparts to him a physical exuberance to which the other is a stranger.  But Nature is kind.  If she withholds her gifts in one direction she bestows them in another.  She grants the enjoyment of sedentary pursuits to those to whom she has denied hardier pleasures.  During my schooldays I spent many happy hours alone with book or pen or pencil.  My father was fond of reading, and for a man of his limited means, possessed a good collection of books; a considerable number of the volumes of _Bohn's Standard Library_ as well as _Boswell's Life of Johnson, Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, Butler's Hudibras, Bailey's Festus, Gil Blas, Don Quixote, Pilgrim's Progress, the Arabian Nights, Shakespeare_, most of the poets from _Chaucer_ down; and of novels, _Bulwer Lytton's, Scott's, Dickens_' and _Thackeray's_.  These are the books I best remember, but there were others of classic fame, and I read them all; but not, I fear to much advantage, for though I have read many books it has been without much method, just as fancy led, and study, memory and judgment have been little considered.  Still, unsystematic reading is better than no reading, and, as someone has said, \"a phrase may fructify if it falls on receptive soil.\"  I never in my boyhood or youth, except on short visits to relatives, enjoyed the advantage, by living in the country, of becoming intimate with rural life.  We resided at Derby in a terrace on the outskirt of the town, much to my dislike, for monotonous rows of houses I have ever hated.  One's home should be one's friend and possess some special feature of its own, even in its outward aspect, to love and remember.  As George Eliot says: \"We get the fonder of our houses if they have a physiognomy of their own, as our friends have.\"  In my schooldays, country walks, pursued as far as health and strength allowed, were my greatest pleasure, sometimes taken alone, sometimes with a companion.  The quiet valley of the Trent at Repton, Anchor Church, Knoll Hills, the long bridge at Swarkestone, the charming little country town of Melbourne, the wooded beauties of Duffield and Belper, the ozier beds of Spondon; how often have I trod their fields, their woods, their lanes, their paths; and how pleasantly the memory of it all comes back to me now!  In those days fashions and manners differed greatly from those of to-day. Ladies wore the crinoline (successor to the hoop of earlier times), chignons and other absurdities, but had not ventured upon short skirts or cigarettes.  They were much given to blushing, now a lost art; and to swooning, a thing of the past; the \"vapours\" of the eighteenth century had, happily, vanished for ever; but athletic exercises, such as girls enjoy to-day, were then undreamed of.  Why has the pretty art of blushing gone?  One now never sees a blush to mantle on the cheek of beauty.  Does the blood of feminine youth flow steadier than it did, or has the more unrestrained intercourse of the sexes banished the sweet consciousness that so often brought the crimson to a maiden's face?  The manners of maidens had more of reserve and formality then.  The off-hand style, the nod of the head, the casual \"how d'ye do,\" were unknown.  Woman has not now the same desire to appear always graceful; she adopts a manly gait, talks louder, plays hockey, rides horseback astride, and boldly enters hotel smoking rooms and railway smoking compartments without apology.  When walking with a lady, old or young, in those days, the gentleman would offer his arm and she would take it.  The curtsey was still observed but gradually disappearing.  When about nineteen years of age, I remember being introduced to one of the young beauties of the town, who I had long secretly admired.  She made me a profound and graceful curtsey--feminine homage to my budding manhood.  The first curtsey I remember receiving, except of course in the stately ceremonies of the dance.  For many a day afterwards my cheek glowed with pleasure at the recollection of that sweet obeisance.  She became my sweetheart, temporarily; but a born butterfly, she soon fluttered away, leaving me disconsolate--_for a time_!  Women then wrote a sloping hand, delicate penmanship, to distinguish them from men; crossed and re-crossed their letters, and were greatly addicted to postscripts.  The men?  Well, they wore mutton chop whiskers, or, if Nature was bountiful, affected the Dundreary style, which gave a man great distinction, and, if allied to good looks, made him perfectly irresistible.  They wore \"Champagne Charley\" coats, fancy waistcoats, frilled-fronted shirts, relic of the lace and ruffles of Elizabeth's days; velvet smoking caps, embroidered slippers, elastic-side boots and chimney pot hats.  At eighteen years of age I had my first frock coat and tall hat.  Some of my companions, happy youths! enjoyed this distinction at sixteen or seventeen.  These adornments were of course for Sunday wear; no weekday clothes were worn on Sundays then.  My frock coat was of West of England broadcloth, shiny and smooth.  Sunday attire was incomplete without light kid gloves, lavender or lemon being the favourite shade for a young man with any pretension to style.  Next in importance to my first frock coat ranked my first portmanteau; it was a present, and supplanted the carpet bag which, up to then, to my profound disgust, I had to use on visits to my relatives.  The portmanteau was the sign of youth and progress; old-fashioned people stuck to the carpet bag.  Man's attire has changed for the better; and woman's, with all its abbreviations and shortcomings, is, on the whole, more rational; though in the domain of Fashion her _vagaries_ will last no doubt as long as--woman is woman; and if ever that shall cease to be, the charm of life will be over.  With man the jacket suit, the soft hat, the soft shirt, the turn-down collar, mark the transition from starch and stiffness to ease and comfort; and Time in his course has brought no greater boon than this; except, perhaps, the change that marks our funeral customs.  In those days, hatbands, gloves and scarves were provided by the bereaved family to the relatives and friends who attended the obsequies; and all of kinship close or remote, were invited from far and near.  Hearse and coaches and nodding plumes and mutes added to the expense, and many a family of moderate means suffered terrible privation from the costliness of these burial customs, which, happily, now are fast disappearing.  Beds, in those days, were warmed with copper warming pans, and nightcaps adorned the slumbering heads of both sexes.  Spittoons were part of ordinary household furniture.  To colour a meerschaum was the ambition of smokers, swearing was considered neither low nor vulgar, and snuffing was fashionable.  Many most respectable men chewed tobacco, and to carry one's liquor well was a gentlemanly accomplishment.  Garrotters pursued their calling, deterred only by the cat-o'-nine tails, pickpockets abounded and burglaries were common.  The antimacassar and the family album; in what veneration they were held! The antimacassar, as its name implies, was designed to protect chairs and couches from the disfiguring stains of macassar oil, then liberally used in the adornment of the hair which received much attention.  A parting, of geometrical precision, at the back of the head was often affected by men of dressy habits, who sometimes also wore a carefully arranged curl at the front; and manly locks, if luxuriant enough, were not infrequently permitted to fall in careless profusion over the collar of the coat.  Of the family album I would rather not speak.  It is scarcely yet extinct.  A respectable silence shall accompany its departing days.  Perhaps these things may to some appear mere trivialities; but to recall them awakens many memories, brings back thoughts "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17299"],["title","Fifty Years of Railway Life in England, Scotland and Ireland (#4)"],["body","bygone days--days illumined with the sunshine of Youth and Hope on which it is pleasant to linger.  As someone has finely said: \"We lose a proper sense of the richness of life if we do not look back on the scenes of our youth with imagination and warmth.\"     CHAPTER V. EARLY OFFICE LIFE   In the year 1867, at the age of sixteen, I became a junior clerk in the Midland Railway at Derby, at a salary of 15 pounds a year.  From pre-natal days I was destined for the railway service, as an oyster to its shell.  The possibility of any other vocation for his sons never entered the mind of my father, nor the mind of many another father in the town of Derby.  My railway life began on a drizzling dismal day in the early autumn.  My father took me to the office in which I was to make a start and presented me to the chief clerk.  I was a tall, thin, delicate, shy, sensitive youth, with curly hair, worn rather long, and I am sure I did not look at all a promising specimen for encountering the rough and tumble of railway work.  The chief clerk handed me over to one of his assistants, who without ceremony seated me on a tall stool at a high desk, and put before me, to my great dismay, a huge pile of formidable documents which he called _Way Bills_.  He gave me some instructions, but I was too confused to understand them, and too shy to ask questions.  I only know that I felt very miserable and hopelessly at sea.  Visions of being dismissed as an incompetent rose before me; but soon, to my great relief, it was discovered that the Way Bills were too much for me and that I must begin at more elementary duties.  A few weeks afterwards, when I had found my feet a little, I was promoted from the simple tasks assigned to me in consequence of my first failure and attached to the goods-train-delays clerk, a long-bearded elderly man with a very kind face.  He was quite fatherly to me and took a great deal of trouble in teaching me my work.  With him I soon felt at ease, and was happy in gaining his approbation.  One thing found favour in his eyes; I wrote a good clear hand and at fair speed.  In those days penmanship was a fine art.  No cramped or sprawling writing passed muster.  Typewriting was not dreamed of, and, at Derby, shorthand had not appeared on the scene.  One or two other juniors and myself sedulously practised imitating the penmanship of those senior clerks who wrote fine or singular hands.  At this I was particularly successful and proud of my skill, until one day the chief clerk detained me after closing time, gave me a good rating, and warned me to stop such a dangerous habit which might lead, he said, to the disgrace of forgery.  He spoke so seriously and shook his head so wisely that (to use Theodore Hook's old joke) \"I thought there must be something in it,\" and so, for a long while, I gave up the practice.  Office hours in those days were nominally from nine till six, but for the juniors especially often much longer.  In 1868 or 1869, 1 do not remember which, a welcome change took place; the hours were reduced to from nine till five, and arrangements made for avoiding late hours for the juniors. This early closing was the result of an \"appeal unto Caesar.\"  The clerical staff in all the offices had combined and presented a petition in the highest quarter.  The boon was granted, and I remember the wave of delight that swept over us, and how we enjoyed the long summer evenings. It was in the summer time the change took place.  Combined action amongst railway employees was not common then, not even in the wage-earning class, but Trade Unionism, scarcely yet legalised, was clamouring for recognition.  Strikes sometimes occurred but were not frequent.  In 1867 Mr. James Allport was general manager of the Midland Railway, Mr. Thomas Walklate the goods manager and Mr. William Parker head of the department in which I began my railway life.  Ned Farmer was a notable Midland man at that time; notable for his bucolic appearance, his genial personality, and, most of all, for the well-known songs he wrote.  He was in charge of the company's horses, bought them, fed them, cared for them. He was a big-bodied, big-hearted, ruddy-faced, farmerlike man of fifty or so; and the service was proud of him.  He had a great sense of humour and used to tell many an amusing story.  One morning, he told us, he had been greatly tickled by a letter which he had received from one of his inspectors whose habit it was to conclude every letter and report with the words \"to oblige.\"  The letter ran: \"Dear Sir, I beg to inform you that Horse No. 99 died last night to oblige Yours truly, John Smith.\"  He wrote the fine poem of \"_Little Jim_,\" which everyone knew, and which almost every boy and girl could recite.  His then well-known song, \"_My old Wife's a good old cratur_,\" was very popular and was sung throughout the Midlands.  The publication of his poems and songs was attended with great success.  His Muse was simple, homely, humorous, pathetic and patriotic, and made a strong appeal to the natural feelings of ordinary folk.  Often it was inspired by incidents and experiences in his daily life.  His desk was in the same office as that in which I worked, and I was very proud of the notice he took of me, and grateful for many kindnesses he showed to me.  After spending twelve months or so in Mr. Parker's office, I was removed to another department.  The office to which I was assigned had about thirty clerks, all of whom, except the chief clerk, occupied tall stools at high desks.  I was one of two assistants to a senior clerk.  This senior was middle- aged, and passing rich on eighty pounds a year.  A quiet, steady, respectable married man, well dressed, cheerful, contented, he had by care and economy, out of his modest salary, built for himself a snug little double-breasted villa, in a pleasant outskirt of the town, where he spent his spare hours in his garden and enjoyed a comfortable and happy life.  Except the chief clerk, whose salary was about 160 pounds, I do not believe there was another whose pay exceeded 100 pounds a year.  The real head of the office, or _department_ it was called, was not the chief clerk but one who ranked higher still and was styled _Head of Department_, and he received a salary of about 300 pounds.  Moderate salaries prevailed, but the sovereign was worth much more then than now, while wants were fewer.  Beer was threepence the pint and tobacco threepence the ounce, and beer we drank but never whiskey or wine; and pipes we smoked but not cigars.  This chief clerk was an amiable rather ladylike person, with small hands and feet and well-arranged curly hair.  He was quick and clever and work sat lightly upon him.  Quiet and good natured, when necessity arose he never failed to assert his authority.  We all respected him.  His young wife was pretty and pleasant, which was in his favour too.  The office was by no means altogether composed of steady specimens of clerkdom, but had a large admixture of lively sparks who, though they would never set the Thames on fire, brightened and enlivened our surroundings.  There was one, a literary genius, who had entered the service, I believe by influence, for influence and patronage were in those days not unknown. He wrote in his spare time the pantomime for a Birmingham theatre; and there constantly fluttered from his desk and circulated through the office, little scraps of paper containing quips and puns and jokes in prose or verse, or acrostics from his prolific pen.  One clever acrostic upon the office boy, which has always remained in my memory, I should like for its delicate irony (worthy of Swift himself) to reproduce; but as that promising youth may still be in the service I feel I had better not, as irony sometimes wounds.  For some time we had in the office an Apollo--a very Belvidere.  He was a glory introduced into railway life by I know not what influence and disappeared after a time I know not where or why.  A marvel of manly strength and grace and beauty, thirty years of age or so, and faultlessly dressed.  Said to be aristocratically connected, he was the admiration of all and the darling of the young ladies of Derby.  He lodged in fashionable apartments, smoked expensive cigars, attended all public amusements, was affable and charming, but reticent about himself.  Why he ever came amongst us none ever knew; it was a mystery we never fathomed.  He left as he came, a mystery still.  There was an oldish clerk whom we nicknamed _Gumpots_.  This bore some resemblance to his surname, but there were other reasons which led to the playful designation and which I think justified it.  There was another scribe of quite an elegant sort: a perambulating tailor's dummy; a young man, well under thirty.  He was good-looking, as far as regularity of features and a well-formed figure went, but mentally not much to boast of.  He lounged about the station platform and the town displaying his faultlessly fitting fashionable clothes.  They always looked new, and as his salary was not more than 70 pounds a year, and his parents, with whom he lived, were poor, the story that he was provided gratis by an enterprising tailor in town with these suits, on condition that he exhibited himself constantly in public, and told whenever he could who was his outfitter, received general credence, and I believe was true.  He was never known to hurry, mingled little with men and less with women, but moved along in a stiff tailor-dummy fashion with a sort of self-conscious air which seemed to say, \"Look at my figure and my clothes, how stylish they are!\"  I remember a senior clerk in the office where I first worked to whom there was a general aversion.  He was the only clerk who was really disliked, for all the others, old or young, serious or gay, steady or rackety, had each some pleasant quality.  This unfortunate fellow had none.  He was small, mean, cunning, a sneak and a mischief maker.  He"]]]
