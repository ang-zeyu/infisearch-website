In a letter to Nast he says: \"Heute ging ich so vor mich hin, da fiel mir ein, ich wolle nach vollendeten Universitäts Jahren Einsiedler werden--und der Gedanke gefiel mir so wohl, eine ganze Stunde, glaub' ich, war ich in meiner Fantasie Einsiedler.\"[22] And although he never became a hermit, this is the final disposition which he makes of himself in his \"Hyperion.\"  These habits of thought and feeling, formed in boyhood, could lead to only one result. He became less and less qualified to comprehend and to grapple with the practical problems and difficulties of life, and entered young manhood and the struggle for existence at a tremendous disadvantage.  Another trait of his character which served to intensify his subsequent disappointments, was the strong ambition which early filled his soul. He aspired to high achievements in his chosen field of art. In a letter to Louise Nast, written probably about the beginning of 1790, he makes the confession: \"Der unüberwindliche Trübsinn in mir ist wohl nicht ganz, doch meist--unbefriedigter Ehrgeiz.\"[23] The mere lad of seventeen had scarcely learned to admire Klopstock, when he speaks of his own \"kämpfendes Streben nach Klopstocksgrösse,\" and exclaims: \"Hinan den herrlichen Ehrenpfad! Hinan! im glühenden kühnen Traum, sie zu erreichen!\"[24] It is remarkable to note how this fancy of a dream-life becomes fixed in Hölderlin's mind and reappears in almost every poem. Closely allied to this idea is that of a \"glückliche Trunkenheit,\" and expressions like \"wie ein Göttertraum das Alter schwand,\" \"liebetrunken,\" \"Wie ein Traum entfliehen Ewigkeiten,\" \"siegestrunken,\" \"süsse, kühne Trunkenheit,\" \"trunken dämmert die Seele mir,\" can be found on almost every page of his shorter poems. Hyperion expresses himself on one occasion in the words: \"O ein Gott ist der Mensch, wenn er träumt, ein Bettler, wenn er nachdenkt, und wenn die Begeisterung hin ist, steht er da, wie ein missrathener Sohn, den der Vater aus dem Hause stiess, und betrachtet die ärmlichen Pfennige, die ihm das Mitleid auf den Weg gab,\"[25] which further illustrates the extravagant idealism by which he allowed himself to be carried away, and the etherial and thoroughly unpractical trend of his mind. The flights of fancy of which Hölderlin is capable are well illustrated by another passage in \"Hyperion.\" Referring to Hyperion's conversation with Alabanda, he says: \"Ich war hingerissen von unendlichen Hoffnungen, Götterkräfte trugen wie ein Wölkchen mich fort.\"[26] These facts have a direct bearing upon Hölderlin's Weltschmerz, inasmuch as it was just this unequal and unsuccessful struggle of the idealist with the stern realities of life that brought about the catastrophe which wrought his ruin.  And just as his ideals are vague and abstract, so too are the expressions of his Weltschmerz. It needs no concrete idea to arouse his enthusiasm to its highest pitch. Thus Hyperion exclaims: \"Der Gott in uns, dem die Unendlichkeit zur Bahn sich öffnet, soll stehen und harren, bis der Wurm ihm aus dem Wege geht? Nein! nein! man frägt nicht, ob ihr wollt! ihr wollt ja nie--ihr Knechte und Barbaren! Euch will man auch nicht bessern, denn es ist umsonst! Man will nur dafür sorgen, dass ihr dem Siegeslauf der Menschheit aus dem Wege geht!\"[27] It is in the form of lofty generalities such as these, and seldom with reference to practical details, that Hölderlin's longings find expression.  Entirely consistent with this idealism is the nature of his love, ardent, but etherial, \"übersinnlich.\" This is reflected also in his lyrics, which are statuesque and beautiful, but lacking in passion and sensuous charm. Hölderlin's earliest love-affair, that with Louise Nast, is important for his Weltschmerz only in its bearing upon the development of his general character. This influence was a twofold one: in the first place his sweetheart was herself inclined to a sort of visionary mysticism, and therefore had an unwholesome influence upon the youth, who had already been carried too far in that direction. She too was a lover of solitude and wrote her letters to him in the stillness of the night, when all others were asleep. There can be no doubt that she had at least some share in determining his mental activity, especially his reading. In one of his earliest letters to her he writes: \"Weil Du den Don Carlos liest, will ich ihn auch lesen.\"[28] It was during this time too that that he became so ardent an admirer of Schubart and Ossian. \"Da leg' ich meinen Ossian weg und komme zu Dir,\" he writes in 1788 to his friend Nast. \"Ich habe meine Seele geweidet an den Helden des Barden, habe mit ihm getrauert, wann er trauert über sterbende Mädchen.\"[29] There is not a sensuous note in all Hölderlin's poems or letters to Louise. Typical are the lines which he addresses to her on his departure from Maulbronn:      Lass sie drohen, die Stürme, die Leiden,     Lass trennen--der Trennung Jahre     Sie trennen uns nicht!     Sie trennen uns nicht!     Denn mein bist du! Und über das Grab hinaus     Soll sie dauren, die unzertrennbare Liebe.      O! wenn's einst da ist     Das grosse selige Jenseits,     Wo die Krone dem leidenden Pilger,     Die Palme dem Sieger blinkt,     Dann Freundin--lohnet auch Freundschaft--     Auch Freundschaft der Ewige.[30]  The second bearing which his relations to Louise have upon his Weltschmerz lies in the fact that his love ended in disappointment. This is true not only of this particular episode, not only of all his love-affairs, but it may even be said that disappointment was the fate to which he found himself doomed in all his aspirations. And in the persistency with which this evil angel pursued his footsteps through life may be found one of the chief causes of the early collapse of his faculties. What David Müller[31] and Hermann Fischer[32] have said in their essays in regard to this point--that Hölderlin did not become insane because his life was a succession of unsatisfactory situations and painful disappointments, but because he had not the strength to work himself out of these situations into more favorable ones--states only half the case. True, a stronger mental organization might have overcome these or even greater difficulties; Schiller, Herder, Fichte are examples; but not all of Hölderlin's failures and disappointments were the result of his weakness, and so while it is right to state that a stronger and more robust nature would have conquered in the fight, it is also fair to say that Hölderlin would have had a good chance of winning, had fortune been more kind. For this reason these external influences must be reckoned with as an important cause of his Weltschmerz and subsequently of his insanity.  This suggests an interesting point of comparison--if I may be permitted to anticipate somewhat--with Lenau, the second type selected. Hölderlin earnestly pursued happiness and contentment, but it eluded him at every step. Lenau on the contrary reached a point in his Weltschmerz where he refused to see anything in life but pain, wilfully thrusting from him even such happiness as came within his reach.  We may postpone any detailed reference to Hölderlin's relations with Susette Gontard, which were vastly more important in their influence upon the poet's character and Weltschmerz, until we come to the discussion of his \"Hyperion,\" of which Susette, under the pseudonym of Diotima, forms one of the central figures.  To speak of all the disappointments which fell to Hölderlin's lot would practically require the writing of his biography from the time of his graduation from Tübingen to his return from Bordeaux, almost the entire period of his sane manhood. Unsuccessful in his first position as a tutor, and unable, after having abandoned this, to provide even a meagre living for himself with his pen, his migration to Frankfort to the house of the merchant Gontard at last gave him a hope of better things, but a hope which soon proved vain. Following close upon these disappointments was his failure to carry out a project which he had long cherished, of establishing a literary journal; then came his dismissal from a situation which he had just entered upon in Switzerland. On his return he wrote to Schiller for help and advice, and his failure to receive a reply grieved him deeply. We can only surmise that it was a cruel disappointment, finally, which caused his sudden departure from Bordeaux, and brought him back a mental wreck to his mother's home. Even as early as 1788 Hölderlin complains bitterly in the poem \"Der Lorbeer,\" in which he eulogizes the poets Klopstock and Young and expresses his own ambition to aspire to their greatness:      Schon so manche Früchte schöner Keime     Logen grausam mir ins Angesicht.[33]  As the years passed, this feeling of disappointment and disillusion became more and more intense and bitter. A stanza from one of his more mature poems (1795) \"An die Natur,\" will serve to illustrate the sentiment which pervades almost all his writings:      Tot ist nun, die mich erzog und stillte,     Tot ist nun die jugendliche Welt,     Diese Brust, die einst ein Himmel füllte,     Tot und dürftig wie ein Stoppelfeld;     Ach es singt der Frühling meinen Sorgen     Noch, wie einst, ein freundlich tröstend Lied,     Aber hin ist meines Lebens Morgen,     Meines Herzens Frühling ist verblüht.[34]  In close causal connection with Hölderlin's Weltschmerz is his belief that his life is ruled by an inexorable fate whose plaything he is. \"Wenn hinfort mich das Schicksal ergreift, und von einem Abgrund in den andern mich wirft, und alle Kräfte in mir ertränkt und alle Gedanken,\" Hyperion exclaims.[35] He goes even further, and conceives the idea of a sacrifice to Fate. Thus he makes Alabanda say near the close of \"Hyperion:\" \"A"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17364"],["title","Types of Weltschmerz in German Poetry (#4)"],["body","ch! weil kein Glück ist ohne Opfer, nimm als Opfer mich, o Schicksal an, und lass die Liebenden in ihrer Freude.\"[36] Wilhelm Scherer calls attention to Gervinus' remark that new intellectual tendencies which call for unaccustomed and unusual mental effort often prove disastrous to single individuals, and says: \"Hölderlin war also ein Opfer der Erneuerung des deutschen Lebens--seltsam, wie der Gedanke des Opfers als ein hoher und herrlicher ihn in allen seinen Gedichten viel beschäftigt hat.\"[37] But the poet does not apply this fatalism only to himself, to the individual; he widens its influence to humanity in general. \"Wir sprechen von unserm Herzen, unsern Planen, als wären sie unser,\" says Hyperion, \"und es ist doch eine fremde Gewalt, die uns herumwirft und ins Grab legt, wie es ihr gefällt, und von der wir nicht wissen, von wannen sie kommt, noch wohin sie geht:\"[38] Perhaps nowhere better than in Hyperion's \"Schicksalslied\" does he give poetic expression to this thought. Omitting the first stanza it reads thus:      Schicksallos wie der schlafende       Säugling atmen die Himmlischen;         Keusch bewahrt           In bescheidener Knospe,             Blühet ewig               Ihnen der Geist,                 Und die seligen Augen                   Blicken in stiller                     Ewiger Klarheit.      Doch uns ist gegeben,       Auf keiner Stätte zu ruhn,         Es schwinden, es fallen           Die leidenden Menschen             Blindlings von einer               Stunde zur andern,                 Wie Wasser von Klippe                   Zu Klippe geworfen,                     Jahrlang ins Ungewisse hinab.[39]  The fundamental difference between Hölderlin's \"Anschauung\" and Goethe's is at once apparent when we recall the \"Lied der Parzen\" from \"Iphigenie.\" Hölderlin does not bring the blessed Genii into any relation with mortals, but merely contrasts their free and blissful existence, emphasizing their immunity from Fate, to which suffering humanity is subject. But this humanity is represented by Hölderlin characteristically as helpless, passive--\"schwinden,\" \"fallen,\" \"blindlings von einer Stunde zur andern.\" Whereas the opening lines of Goethe's \"Parzen\" strike the keynote of _conflict_ between the gods and men:      Es fürchte die Götter     Das Menschengeschlecht!     Sie halten die Herrschaft     In ewigen Händen     Und können sie brauchen     Wie's ihnen gefällt.     Der fürchte sie doppelt,     Den je sie erheben!  And those who come to grief at the hands of the gods, are not weak passive creatures, but heaven-scaling Titans. This points to the antipodal difference between the characters of these two poets, and explains in part why Goethe did not succumb to the sickly sentimentalism of which he rid himself in \"Werther.\" The difference between yielding and striving resulted in the difference between an acute case of Weltschmerz in the one and a healthy physical and intellectual manhood in the other.  Thus far it has been almost entirely the personal aspect of Hölderlin's Weltschmerz and its causes that has come under our notice. And since he was a lyric poet, it is perhaps natural that the sorrows which concerned him personally should find most frequent expression in his verse. But notwithstanding the fact that this personal element is very prominent in Hölderlin's writings, Scherer's judgment is correct when he states: \"Die Grundstimmung war eine tiefe Verbitterung gegen die Versunkenheit des Vaterlands.\"[40] The reason is not far to seek, especially when we consider the impossible demands of the poet's extravagant idealism. The conditions in Germany which had called forth the terrible arraignment of petty despotism, crushing militarism, and political rottenness generally, in the works of Lenz, Klinger and Schubart, had not abated. Schubart was one of Hölderlin's earliest favorites, so that the latter was doubtless in this way imbued with sentiments which could only grow stronger under the influence of his more mature observations and experiences. Even in his eighteenth year, in a poem \"An die Demut,\"[41] he gives expression in strong terms to his patriotic feelings, in which his disgust with his faint-hearted, servile compatriots and his defiance of \"Fürstenlaune\" and \"Despotenblut\" are plainly evident. So too in \"Männerjubel,\" 1788:      Es glimmt in uns ein Funke der Göttlichen!     Und diesen Funken soll aus der Männerbrust     Der Hölle Macht uns nicht entreissen!     Hört es, Despotengerichte, hört es![42]  Perhaps nowhere outside of his own Württemberg could he have been more unfavorably situated in this respect. Under Karl Eugen (1744-1793) the country sank into a deplorable condition. Regardless of the rights of individuals and communities alike, he sought in the early part of his reign to replenish his depleted purse by the most shameless measures, in order that he might surround himself with luxury and indulge his autocratic proclivities. Among his most reprehensible violations of constitutional rights, were his bartering of privileges and offices and the selling of troops. These things Hölderlin attacks in one of his youthful poems \"Die Ehrsucht\" (1788):      Um wie Könige zu prahlen, schänden     Kleine Wütriche ihr armes Land;     Und um feile Ordensbänder wenden     Räte sich das Ruder aus der Hand.[43]  Another act of gross injustice which this petty tyrant perpetrated, and which Hölderlin must have felt very painfully, was the incarceration of the poet's countryman Schubart from 1777 to 1787 in the Hohenasperg. But not only from within came tyrannous oppression. Following upon the coalition against France after the Revolution, Württemberg became the scene of bloody conflicts and the ravages of war. Under the regime of Friedrich Eugen (1795-97) the French gained such a foothold in Württemberg that the country had to pay a contribution of four million gulden to get rid of them. These were the conditions under which Hölderlin grew up into young manhood. But deeper than in the mere existence of these conditions themselves lay the cause of the poet's most abject humiliation and grief. It was the stoic indifference, the servile submission with which he charged his compatriots, that called forth his bitterest invectives upon their insensible heads. His own words will serve best to show the intensity of his feelings. In 1788 he writes, in the poem \"Am Tage der Freundschaftsfeier:\"      Da sah er (der Schwärmer) all die Schande     Der weichlichen Teutonssöhne,     Und fluchte dem verderblichen Ausland     Und fluchte den verdorbenen Affen des Auslands,     Und weinte blutige Thränen,     Dass er vielleicht noch lange     Verweilen müsse unter diesem Geschlecht.[44]  Ten years later he treats the Germans to the following ignominious comparison:      Spottet ja nicht des Kinds, wenn es mit Peitsch' und Sporn     Auf dem Rosse von Holz, mutig und gross sich dünkt.     Denn, ihr Deutschen, auch ihr seid     Thatenarm und gedankenvoll.[45]  With his friend Sinclair, who was sent as a delegate, he attended the congress at Rastatt in November, 1798, and here he made observations which no doubt resulted in the bitter characterization of his nation in the closing letters of Hyperion. This convention, whose chief object was the compensation of those German princes who had been dispossessed by the cessions to France on the left bank of the Rhine, afforded a spectacle so humiliating that it would have bowed down in shame a spirit even less proud and sensitive than Hölderlin's. The French emissaries conducted themselves like lords of Germany, while the German princes vied with each other in acts of servility and submission to the arrogant Frenchmen. And it was the apathy of the average German, as Hölderlin conceived it, toward these and other national indignities, that caused him to put such bitter words of contumely into the mouth of Hyperion: \"Barbaren von Alters her, durch Fleiss und Wissenschaft und selbst durch Religion barbarischer geworden, tief unfähig jedes göttlichen Gefühls--beleidigend für jede gut geartete Seele, dumpf und harmonielos, wie die Scherben eines weggeworfenen Gefässes--das, mein Bellarmin! waren meine Tröster.\"[46] In another letter Hyperion explains their incapacity for finer feeling and appreciation when he writes: \"Neide die Leidensfreien nicht, die Götzen von Holz, denen nichts mangelt, weil ihre Seele so arm ist, die nichts fragen nach Regen und Sonnenschein, weil sie nichts haben, was der Pflege bedürfte. Ja, ja, es ist recht sehr leicht, glücklich, ruhig zu sein mit seichtem Herzen und eingeschränktem Geiste.\"[47] Their work he characterizes as \"Stümperarbeit,\" and their virtues as brilliant evils and nothing more. There is nothing sacred, he claims, that has not been desecrated by this nation. But it is chiefly his own experience which he recites, when, in speaking of the sad plight of German poets, of those who still love the beautiful, he says: \"Es ist auch herzzerreissend, wenn man eure Dichter, eure Künstler sieht--die Guten, sie leben in der Welt, wie Fremdlinge im eigenen Hause.\"[48] Still more extravagantly does the poet caricature his own people when he writes: \"Wenn doch einmal diesen Gottverlassnen einer sagte, dass bei ihnen nur so unvollkommen alles ist, weil sie nichts Reines unverdorben, nichts Heiliges unbetastet lassen mit den plumpen Händen--dass bei ihnen eigentlich das Leben schaal und sorgenschwer ist, weil sie den Genius verschmähen--und darum fürchten sie auch den Tod so sehr, und leiden um des Austernlebens willen alle Schmach, weil Höhres sie nicht kennen, als ihr Machwerk, das sie sich gestoppelt.\"[49]  But we should get an extremely unjust and one-sided idea of Hölderlin's attitude toward his country from these quotations alone. The point which they illustrate is his growing estrangement from his own people, which in the very nature of the case must have had an important bearing upon his Weltschmerz. But his feelings in regard to "]]]
