Dieulafoy. For six weeks in November and December there is much rain: after this period there are only occasional showers, occurring at longer and longer intervals until May, when they entirely cease, and the summer sets in, to last until the following November. There are almost six continuous months of depressing and moist heat, which overcomes both men and animals and makes them incapable of any constant effort.* Sometimes a south or east wind suddenly arises, and bearing with it across the fields and canals whirlwinds of sand, burns up in its passage the little verdure which the sun had spared. Swarms of locusts follow in its train, and complete the work of devastation. A sound as of distant rain is at first heard, increasing in intensity as the creatures approach. Soon their thickly concentrated battalions fill the heavens on all sides, flying with slow and uniform motion at a great height. They at length alight, cover everything, devour everything, and, propagating their species, die within a few days: nothing, not a blade of vegetation, remains on the region where they alighted.       * Loftus says that he himself had witnessed in the      neighbourhood of Bagdad during the daytime birds perched on      the palm trees in an exhausted condition, and panting with      open beaks. The inhabitants of Bagdad during the summer pass      their nights on the housetops, and the hours of day in      passages within, expressly constructed to protect them from      the heat.  Notwithstanding these drawbacks, the country was not lacking in resources. The soil was almost as fertile as the loam of Egypt, and, like the latter, rewarded a hundredfold the labour of the inhabitants.* Among the wild herbage which spreads over the country in the spring, and clothes it for a brief season with flowers, it was found that some plants, with a little culture, could be rendered useful to men and beasts. There were ten or twelve different species of pulse to choose from--beans, ‘lentils, chick-peas, vetches, kidney beans, onions, cucumbers, egg-plants, “gombo,” and pumpkins. From the seed of the sesame an oil was expressed which served for food, while the castor-oil plant furnished that required for lighting. The safflower and henna supplied the women with dyes for the stuffs which they manufactured from hemp and flax. Aquatic plants were more numerous than on the banks of the Nile, but they did not occupy such an important place among food-stuffs. The “lily bread” of the Pharaohs would have seemed meagre fare to people accustomed from early times to wheaten bread. Wheat and barley are considered to be indigenous on the plains of the Euphrates; it was supposed to be here that they were first cultivated in Western Asia, and that they spread from hence to Syria, Egypt, and the whole of Europe.** “The soil there is so favourable to the growth of cereals, that it yields usually two hundredfold, and in places of exceptional fertility three hundredfold. The leaves of the wheat and barley have a width of four digits. As for the millet and sesame, which in altitude are as great as trees, I will not state their height, although I know it from experience, being convinced that those who have not lived in Babylonia would regard my statement with incredulity.” Herodotus in his enthusiasm exaggerated the matter, or perhaps, as a general rule, he selected as examples the exceptional instances which had been mentioned to him: at present wheat and barley give a yield to the husbandman of some thirty or forty fold.       * Olivier, who was a physician and naturalist, and had      visited Egypt as well as Mesopotamia, thought that Babylonia      was somewhat less fertile than Egypt. Loftus, who was      neither, and had not visited Egypt, declares, on the      contrary, that the banks of the Euphrates are no less      productive than those of the Nile.       ** Native traditions collected by Berossus confirm this, and      the testimony of Olivier is usually cited as falling in with      that of the Chaldaean writer. Olivier is considered, indeed,      to have discovered wild cereals in Mesopotamia. Pie only      says, however, that on the banks of the Euphrates above Anah      he had met with “wheat, barley, and spelt in a kind of      ravine;” from the context it clearly follows that these were      plants which had reverted to a wild state--instances of      which have been observed several times in Mesopotamia. A. de      Oandolle admitted the Mesopotamian origin of the various      species of wheat and barley.  [Illustration: 030.jpg THE GATHERING OF THE SPATHES OF THE MALE PALM TREE]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a cylinder in the Museum at the      Hague. The original measures almost an inch in height.  “The date palm meets all the other needs of the population; they make from it a kind of bread, wine, vinegar, honey, cakes, and numerous kinds of stuffs; the smiths use the stones of its fruit for charcoal; these same stones, broken and macerated, are given as a fattening food to cattle and sheep.” Such a useful tree was tended with a loving care, the vicissitudes in its growth were observed, and its reproduction was facilitated by the process of shaking the flowers of the male palm over those of the female: the gods themselves had taught this artifice to men, and they were frequently represented with a bunch of flowers in their right hand, in the attitude assumed by a peasant in fertilizing a palm tree. Fruit trees were everywhere mingled with ornamental trees--the fig, apple, almond, walnut, apricot, pistachio, vine, with the plane tree, cypress, tamarisk, and acacia; in the prosperous period of the country the plain of the Euphrates was a great orchard which extended uninterruptedly from the plateau of Mesopotamia to the shores of the Persian Gulf.  The flora would not have been so abundant if the fauna had been sufficient for the supply of a large population. A considerable proportion of the tribes on the Lower Euphrates lived for a long time on fish only. They consumed them either fresh, salted, or smoked: they dried them in the sun, crushed them in a mortar, strained the pulp through linen, and worked it up into a kind of bread or into cakes. The barbel and carp attained a great size in these sluggish waters, and if the Chalaeans, like the Arabs who have succeeded them in these regions, clearly preferred these fish above others, they did not despise at the same time such less delicate species as the eel, murena, silurus, and even that singular gurnard whose habits are an object of wonder to our naturalists. This fish spends its existence usually in the water, but a life in the open air has no terrors for it: it leaps out on the bank, climbs trees without much difficulty, finds a congenial habitat on the banks of mud exposed by the falling tide, and basks there in the sun, prepared to vanish in the ooze in the twinkling of an eye if some approaching bird should catch sight of it. Pelicans, herons, cranes, storks, cormorants, hundreds of varieties of seagulls, ducks, swans, wild geese, secure in the possession of an inexhaustible supply of food, sport and prosper among the reeds. The ostrich, greater bustard, the common and red-legged partridge and quail, find their habitat on the borders of the desert; while the thrush, blackbird, ortolan, pigeon, and turtle-dove abound on every side, in spite of daily onslaughts from eagles, hawks, and other birds of prey.  [Illustration: 032.jpg A WINGED GENIUS HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE SPATHE OF THE MALE DATE-PALM.]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief from Nimrud, in      the British Museum.  [Illustration: 033.jpg THE HEAVILY MANED LION WOUNDED BY AN ARROW AND VOMITING BLOOD.]  Snakes are found here and there, but they are for the most part of innocuous species: three poisonous varieties only are known, and their bite does not produce such terrible consequences as that of the horned viper or Egyptian uraeus. There are two kinds of lion--one without mane, and the other hooded, with a heavy mass of black and tangled hair: the proper signification of the old Chaldaean name was “the great ‘dog,” and they have, indeed, a greater resemblance to large dogs than to the red lions of Africa.* They fly at the approach of man; they betake themselves in the daytime to retreats among the marshes or in the thickets which border the rivers, sallying forth at night, like the jackal, to scour the country. Driven to bay, they turn upon the assailant and fight desperately. The Chaldaean kings, like the Pharaohs, did not shrink from entering into a close conflict with them, and boasted of having rendered a service to their subjects by the destruction of many of these beasts.  * The Sumerian name of the lion is ur-malch “the great dog.” The best description of the first-mentioned species is still that of Olivier, who saw in the house oL the Pasha of Bagdad five of them in captivity; cf. Layard, Nineveh and Babylon, p. 487. Father Scheil tells me the lions have disappeared completely since the last twenty years.

[Illustration: 035.jpg a herd of onagers pursued by dogs and wounded by arrows.]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief in the British      Museum.  The elephant seems to have roamed for some time over the steppes of the middle Euphrates;* there is no indication of its presence after the XIIIth century before our era, and from that time forward it was merely an object of curiosity brought at great expense from distant countries. This is not the only instance of animals which have disappeared in the course of centuries; the rulers of Nineveh were so addicted to the pursuit "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17323"],["title","History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 3 (of 12) (#5)"],["body","the urus that they ended by exterminating it. Several sorts of panthers and smaller felidae had their lairs in the thickets of Mesopotamia. The wild ass and onager roamed in small herds between the Balikh and the Tigris. Attempts were made, it would seem, at a very early period to tame them and make use of them to draw chariots; but this attempt either did not succeed at all, or issued in such uncertain results, that it was given up as soon as other less refractory animals were made the subjects of successful experiment.       * The existence of the elephant in Mesopotamia and Northern      Syria is well established by the Egyptian inscription of      Amenemhabi in the XVth century before our era.  [Illustration: 036.jpg THE CHIEF DOMESTIC ANIMALS OP THE REGIONS OF THE EUPHRATES.]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from an Assyrian bas-relief from      Kouyunjik.  The wild boar, and his relative, the domestic hog, inhabited the morasses. Assyrian sculptors amused themselves sometimes by representing long gaunt sows making their way through the cane-brakes, followed by their interminable offspring. The hog remained here, as in Egypt, in a semi-tamed condition, and the people were possessed of only a small number of domesticated animals besides the dog--namely, the ass, ox, goat, and sheep; the horse and camel were at first unknown, and were introduced at a later period.*  [Illustration: 037.jpg THE SOW AND HER LITTER MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH A BED OF REEDS.]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief from Kouyunjik.       * The horse is denoted in the Assyrian texts by a group of      signs which mean “the ass of the East,” and the camel by      other signs in which the character for “ass” also appears.      The methods of rendering these two names show that the      subjects of them were unknown in the earliest times; the      epoch of their introduction is uncertain. A chariot drawn by      horses appears on the “Stele of the Vultures.” Camels are      mentioned among the booty obtained from the Bedouin of the      desert.  We know nothing of the efforts which the first inhabitants--Sumerians and Semites--had to make in order to control the waters and to bring the land under culture: the most ancient monuments exhibit them as already possessors of the soil, and in a forward state of civilization.* Their chief cities were divided into two groups: one in the south, in the neighbourhood of the sea; the other in a northern direction, in the region where the Euphrates and Tigris are separated from each other by merely a narrow strip of land. The southern group consisted of seven, of which Eridu lay nearest to the coast. This town stood on the left bank of the Euphrates, at a point which is now called Abu-Shahrein. A little to the west, on the opposite bank, but at some distance from the stream, the mound of Mugheir marks the site of Uru, the most important, if not the oldest, of the southern cities. Lagash occupied the site of the modern Telloh to the north of Eridu, not far from the Shatt-el-Hai; Nisin and Mar, Larsam and Uruk, occupied positions at short distances from each other on the marshy ground which extends between the Euphrates and the Shatt-en-Nil. The inscriptions mention here and there other less important places, of which the ruins have not yet been discovered--Zirlab and Shurippak, places of embarkation at the mouth of the Euphrates for the passage of the Persian Gulf; and the island of Dilmun, situated some forty leagues to the south in the centre of the Salt Sea,--“Nar-Marratum.” The northern group comprised Nipur, the “incomparable;” Barsip, on the branch which flows parallel to the Euphrates and falls into the Bahr-i-Nedjif; Babylon, the “gate of the god,” the “residence of life,” the only metropolis of the Euphrates region of which posterity never lost a reminiscence; Kishu, Kuta, Agade;** and lastly the two Sipparas, that of Shamash and that of Anunit. The earliest Chaldaean civilization was confined almost entirely to the two banks of the Lower Euphrates: except at its northern boundary, it did not reach the Tigris, and did not cross this river. Separated from the rest of the world--on the east by the marshes which border the river in its lower course, on the north by the badly watered and sparsely inhabited table-land of Mesopotamia, on the west by the Arabian desert--it was able to develop its civilization, as Egypt had done, in an isolated area, and to follow out its destiny in peace. The only point from which it might anticipate serious danger was on the east, whence the Kashshi and the Elamites, organized into military states, incessantly harassed it year after year by their attacks. The Kashshi were scarcely better than half-civilized mountain hordes, but the Elamites were advanced in civilization, and their capital, Susa, vied with the richest cities of the Euphrates, Uru and Babylon, in antiquity and magnificence.       * For an ideal picture of what may have been the beginnings      of that civilization, see Delitzsch, Die Entstehung des      altesten Schriflssystems, p. 214, et seq. I will not enter      into the question as to whether it did or did not come by      sea to the mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris. The legend of      the fish-god Oannes (Berossus, frag. 1), which seems to      conceal some indication on the subject, is merely a      mythological tradition, from which it would be wrong to      deduce historical conclusions.       ** Agade, or Agane, has been identified with one of the two      towns of which Sippara is made up, more especially with that      which was called Anunit Sippara; the reading Agadi, Agacle,      was especially assumed to lead to its identification with      the Accad of _Genesis x. 10_, and with the Akkad of native      tradition. This opinion has been generally abandoned by      Assyriologists, and Agane has not yet found a site. Was it      only a name for Babylon?  [Illustration: 040.jpg MAP OF CHALDAEA]  There was nothing serious to fear from the Guti, on the branch of the Tigris to the north-east, or from the Shuti to the north of these; they were merely marauding tribes, and, however troublesome they might be to their neighbours in their devastating incursions, they could not compromise the existence of the country, or bring it into subjection. It would appear that the Chaldseans had already begun to encroach upon these tribes and to establish colonies among them--El-Ashshur on the banks of the Tigris, Harran on the furthest point of the Mesopotamian plain, towards the sources of the Balikh. Beyond these were vague and unknown regions--Tidanum, Martu, the sea of the setting sun, the vast territories of Milukhkha and Magan.* Egypt, from the time they were acquainted with its existence, was a semi-fabulous country at the ends of the earth.       * The question concerning Milukhkha and Magan has exercised      Assyriologists for twenty years. The prevailing opinion      appears to be that which identifies Magan with the Sinaitic      Peninsula, and Milukhkha with the country to the north of      Magan as far as the Wady Arish and the Mediterranean; others      maintain, not the theory of Delitzsch, according to whom      Magan and Milukhkha are synonyms for Shumir and Akkad, and      consequently two of the great divisions of Babylonia, but an      analogous hypothesis, in which they are regarded as      districts to the west of the Euphrates, either in Chaldaean      regions or on the margin of the desert, or even in the      desert itself towards the Sinaitic Peninsula. What we know      of the texts induces me, in common with H. Rawlinson, to      place these countries on the shores of the Persian Gulf,      between the mouth of the Euphrates and the Bahrein islands;      possibly the Makse and the Melangitso of classical      historians and geographers were the descendants of the      people of Magan (Makan) and Milukhkha (Melugga), who had      been driven towards the entrance to the Persian Gulf by some      such event as the increase in these regions of the Kashdi      (Chaldaeans). The names, emigrated to the western parts of      Arabia and to the Sinaitic Peninsula in after-times, as the      name of India passed to America in the XVIth century of our      era.  How long did it take to bring this people out of savagery, and to build up so many flourishing cities? The learned did not readily resign themselves to a confession of ignorance on the subject. As they had depicted the primordial chaos, the birth of the gods, and their struggles over the creation, so they related unhesitatingly everything which had happened since the creation of mankind, and they laid claim to being able to calculate the number of centuries which lay between their own day and the origin of things. The tradition to which most credence was attached in the Greek period at Babylon, that which has been preserved for us in the histories of Berossue, asserts that there was a somewhat long interval between the manifestation of Oannes and the foundation of a dynasty. The first king was Aloros of Babylon, a Chaldaean of whom nothing is related except that he was chosen by the divinity himself to be a shepherd of the people. He reigned for ten sari, amounting in all to 36,000 years; for the saros is 3600 years, the ner 600 years, and the soss 60 years.  [Illustration: 041.jpg TWO FISH-LIKE DEITIES OF THE CHALDAEANS.]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from an intaglio in the British Museum.  After the death of Aloros, his son Alaparos ruled for three sari, after which Amillaros, of the city of Pantibibla, reigned thirteen sari. It was under him that there issued from the Bed Sea a second Annedotos, resembling Oannes in his semi-divine shape, half man and half fish. After him Ammenon, also from Pantibibla, a Chaldaean, ruled for a term of twelve sari; under him, they say, the mysterious Oannes appeared. Afterwards Amelagaros of Pantibibla governed for eighteen sari;"]]]
