Where are they and their consents? Oliver Cromwell is a traitor.\"  Lieutenant-Colonel Axtell, who during the trial was in command of a regiment in Westminster and charged by his military superior, Lord Fairfax himself, with the duty of maintaining order, hearing this disturbance, went forward and told Lady Fairfax to hold her tongue, sound advice which she appears to have taken. After the Restoration Axtell was put to his trial as a \"regicide.\" His defence, which was, that as a soldier he obeyed his orders, and was no more guilty than his general, Lord Fairfax, was not listened to, and he was sentenced to death, a fate which he met like the brave man he was.  Although Fairfax did not immediately resign his command after the king's death, from that moment he lost heart in the cause. Lady Fairfax, whose loyalty to Charles may have been quickened by her dislike of Oliver, had great influence with him, and it may well be that his conscience pricked him. The rupture came in June 1650, when Charles's son made his appearance in Scotland and his peace with the Presbyterians, subscribing with inward emotions it would be unkind to attempt to describe the Solemn League and Covenant, and attending services and listening to sermons the length of which, at least, he never forgot. War was plainly imminent between the two countries. The question was, who should begin? Cromwell, who had hurried home from Ireland, Lambert, and Harrison were all keen to strike the first blow. Fairfax felt a scruple, and in those days scruples counted. Was there, he asked, a just cause for an invasion of Scotland? A committee was appointed, consisting of the three warriors above-named with St. John and Whitelock, to confer with the Lord-General and satisfy him of the lawfulness of the undertaking. The six met, and having first prayed--Oliver praying first--they proceeded to a discussion which may be read at length in Whitelock's _Memorials_, vol. iii. p. 207. The substance of their talk was as follows: Fairfax's scruple proved to be that both they and the Scots had joined in the Solemn League and Covenant, and that, therefore, until Scotland assumed the offensive, there was no cause for an invasion. Cromwell's retort, after a preliminary quibble, was practical enough. \"War is inevitable. Is it better to have it in the bowels of another's country or in one's own? In one or other it must be.\" Fairfax's scruple, however, withstood this battery, though it was strongly enforced by Harrison, who, in reply to the Lord-General's question, \"What was the warrant for the assumption that Scotland meant to fall upon England?\" inquired, if Scotland did not mean to invade England, for whose benefit were levies being made and soldiers enlisted.  Fairfax proved immovable. \"Every man,\" said he, \"must stand or fall by his own conscience\"; and as he offered to lay down his command, there was nothing for it but to accept the resignation and appoint his successor. This was speedily done, and on the 28th of June 1650 \"Oliver Cromwell, Esquire,\" was appointed Captain-General and Commander-in-chief of all the forces. On 16th July Cromwell crossed the Tweed, and on the 3rd of September the Lord delivered Leslie into his hands at Dunbar.  It was in these circumstances that Lord Fairfax and his energetic lady and only child went back to their Yorkshire home in the midsummer of 1650, taking Marvell with them to instruct the Lady Mary in the tongues.  Nunappleton House is in the Ainstey of York, a pleasant bit of country bounded by the rivers Ouse, Wharfe, and Nidd. The modern traveller, as his train rushes north, whilst shut up in his corridor-carriage with his rug, his pipe, and his novel, passes at no great distance from the house on the way between Selby and York. The old house, as it was in Marvell's time, is thus described by Captain Markham, who had a print to help him, in his delightful _Life of the Great Lord Fairfax_:--     \"It was a picturesque brick mansion with stone copings and a high    steep roof, and consisted of a centre and two wings at right angles,    forming three sides of a square, facing to the north. The great hall    or gallery occupied the centre between the two wings. It was fifty    yards long, and was adorned with thirty shields in wood, painted with    the arms of the family. In the three rooms there were chimney-pieces    of delicate marble of various colours, and many fine portraits on the    walls. The central part of the house was surrounded by a cupola, and    clustering chimneys rose in the two wings. A noble park with splendid    oak-trees, and containing 300 head of deer, stretched away to the    north, while on the south side were the ruins of the old Nunnery, the    flower-garden, and the low meadows called _ings_ extending to the    banks of the Wharfe. In this flower-garden the General took especial    delight. The flowers were planted in masses, tulips, pinks, and    roses, each in separate beds, which were cut into the shape of forts    with five bastions. General Lambert, whom Fairfax had reared as a    soldier, also loved his flowers, and excelled both in cultivating    them and in painting them from Nature. Lord Fairfax only went to    Denton, the favourite seat of his grandfather, when the floods were    out over the _ings_ at Nunappleton, and he also occasionally resorted    to his house at Bishop Hill in York.\"[31:1]  In this garden the muse of Andrew Marvell blossomed like the cherry-tree.  Lord Fairfax, though furious in war, and badly wounded in many a fierce engagement, was, when otherwise occupied, a man of quiet literary tastes, and a good bit of a collector and _virtuoso_. Some of the rare books and manuscripts he had around him at Nunappleton are now in the Bodleian, the treasures of which he had protected in troubled times. He loved to handle medals and coins, and knew the points of old engravings. He wrote a history of the Christian Church down to our own ill-conducted Reformation, and composed a complete metrical version of the Psalms of David and of the Song of Solomon. These and many other productions, which he characterised as \"The Employment of my Solitude,\" still remain in his own handwriting. Amongst them, Yorkshire men will hear with pleasure, is a \"Treatise on the breeding of the Horse.\"  Of the quality of his wife we have already had a touch. She was one of the four daughters of Lord Vere of Tilbury, who came of a fine fighting family, and whose daughters had a roughish bringing-up, chiefly in the Netherlands. None of the daughters were reckoned beautiful, either in face or figure, and it may well be that Lady Fairfax had something about her of the old campaigner; but of her courage, sincerity, and goodness there can be no question. Her loyalty was no sickly fruit of \"Church Principles,\" for her strong intelligence rejected scornfully the slavish doctrines, alien to our political constitution, of divine right and passive obedience; but a loyalty, none the less, it was, of a very valuable kind. She was fond of argument, and with Lady Fairfax at Nunappleton there was never likely to be any dearth of sensible talk and lively reminiscence. The tragedy of the 30th of January could never be forgotten, and it is possible that Marvell's most famous verses, so nobly descriptive of the demeanour of the king on that memorable occasion, derived their inspiration from discourse at Nunappleton.  Of the Lady Mary, aged twelve, we have no direct testimony. When she grew up and had her portrait painted she stands revealed as a stout young woman with a plain good-natured face. The poor soul needed all the good-nature heaven had bestowed upon her, for she had to bear the misery and disgrace which were the inevitable marriage-portion of the woman whose ill-luck it was to become the wife of George Villiers, second Duke of Buckingham. Somebody seems to have taught her philosophy, for she bore her misfortunes as best became a great lady, living as one who had sorrow but no grievance. The duke died in 1688; she lived on till 1704. She was ever a good friend to another ill-used solitary wife, Catherine of Braganza. Marvell had every reason to be proud of his pupil.  Beside the actual inmates of the great house, the whole countryside swarmed with Fairfaxes. At the Rectory of Bolton Percy was the late Lord-General's uncle, Henry Fairfax, and his two sons, Henry, who succeeded to the title, and the better-known Brian, the biographer of the Duke of Buckingham. At Stenton, four miles off, lived the widow of the gallant Sir William Fairfax, who died, covered with wounds, in 1644 before Montgomery Castle. There were two sons and two daughters at Stenton, whilst Charles Fairfax, another uncle, and the lawyer and genealogist of the family, lived at no great distance with no less than fourteen children. There were also sisters of Lord Fairfax, with families of their own, all settled in the same part of the county.  Such were the agreeable surroundings of our poet for two years, 1650-1652. I must leave it to the imaginations of my readers to fill up the picture, for excepting the poems, which we may safely assume were written at Nunappleton House, and--who can doubt it?--read aloud to its inmates, there is nothing more to be said.  Before considering the Nunappleton poetry, a word must be got in of bibliography. College exercises and complimentary verses excepted, Marvell printed none of his verse under his own name in his lifetime. So far as his themes were political there is no need to wonder at this. Indeed, the wonder is how, despite their anonymity, their author kept his ears; but why the Nunappleton verse should have remained in manuscript for more than thirty years is hard to explain.  Until Pope took his muse to market, poetry, apart from the drama, had no direct commercial value, or one too small to be ranked as a motive for "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17388"],["title","Andrew Marvell (#6)"],["body","publication. None the less, the age loved distinction and appreciated wit, and to be known as a poet whose verses \"numbered good intellects\" was to gain the _entrée_ to the society of men both of intellect and fashion, and also, not infrequently, snug berths in the public service, and secretaryships to foreign missions and embassies. Thus there was always, in addition to natural vanity, a strong motive for a seventeenth-century poet to publish his poems. To-day one would hesitate to recommend a young man who wanted to get on in the world to publish a volume of verse; but the age of \"wit\" and \"parts\" is over.  It was not till 1681--three years after Marvell's death--that the small folio appeared with a fine portrait, still dear to the collector, which contains for the first time what may be called the \"garden-poetry\" of our author, together with some specimens of his political and satirical versification.  Marvell's most famous poem--_The Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland_--is not included in the 1681 volume, and remained in manuscript until 1776, as also did the poem upon Cromwell's death.  The remainder of the political poems, which had made their first appearance as broadsheets, were reprinted after the Revolution in the well-known _Collection of Poems on Affairs of State_.[35:1] These verses were never owned by Marvell, and it is probable that some of them, though attributed to him, are not his at all. We have only tradition to go by. In the case of political satires, squibs, epigrams, rough popular occasional rhymes flung off both in haste and heat to be sold with old ballads in the market-place, we need not seek for better evidence than tradition, which indeed is often the only external evidence we have for the authorship of much more important things.  Now to return to the Nunappleton poetry.  In a poem of 776 lines Marvell tells the story and describes the charms of the house which Lord Fairfax built for himself during the war, and to which, as just narrated, he retired in the summer of 1650. The story is only too familiar a one, being writ large over many a fine property. Appleton House was Church loot. In the time of Henry, \"the majestic lord that burst the bonds of Rome,\" the old house at Nunappleton was a Cistercian nunnery, a religious house. In 1542 the community was suppressed and its property appropriated by the great-grandfather of the Lord-General--one Sir Thomas Fairfax. The religious buildings were pulled down and a new secular house rose in their place. In these bare and sordid facts there is not much room for poetry, but there is a story thrown in. Shortly before 1518 a Yorkshire heiress, bearing the unromantic name of Isabella Thwaites, was living in the Cistercian abbey, under the guardianship of the abbess, the Lady Anna Langton. Property under the care of the Church is always supposed to be in danger, and the Lady Anna was freely credited with the desire to make a nun of her ward, and so keep her broad acres in Wharfedale and her messuages in York for the use of Mother Church. None the less, the young lady was allowed to go about and visit her neighbours, and whilst so doing she fell in love with Sir William Fairfax, or he fell in love with her or with her estates. Thereupon, so the story proceeds, the abbess kept her ward a close prisoner within the nunnery walls. Legal proceedings were taken, but in the end the privacy of the nunnery was invaded, and Miss Thwaites was abducted and married to Sir William Fairfax at the church of Bolton Percy. The lady abbess had to submit to _vis major_, but worse days were in front of her, for she lived on to see the nunnery itself despoiled, and the fair domains she had during a long life preserved and maintained for religious uses handed over to the son of her former ward, Isabella Thwaites.  Our poet begins by referring to the modest dimensions of the house, and the natural charms of its surroundings:--      \"The house was built upon the place,     Only as for a mark of grace,     And for an inn to entertain     Its Lord awhile, but not remain.     Him Bishop's-hill or Denton may,     Or Billborow, better hold than they:     But Nature here hath been so free,     As if she said, 'Leave this to me.'     Art would more neatly have defac'd     What she had laid so sweetly waste     In fragrant gardens, shady woods,     Deep meadows, and transparent floods.\"  And then starts the story:--      \"While, with slow eyes, we these survey,     And on each pleasant footstep stay,     We opportunely may relate     The progress of this house's fate.     A nunnery first gave it birth,     (For virgin buildings oft brought forth)     And all that neighbour-ruin shows     The quarries whence this dwelling rose.     Near to this gloomy cloister's gates,     There dwelt the blooming virgin Thwaites,     Fair beyond measure, and an heir,     Which might deformity make fair;     And oft she spent the summer's suns     Discoursing with the subtle Nuns,     Whence, in these words, one to her weav'd,     As 'twere by chance, thoughts long conceiv'd:     'Within this holy leisure, we     Live innocently, as you see.     These walls restrain the world without,     But hedge our liberty about;     These bars inclose that wilder den     Of those wild creatures, callèd men,     The cloister outward shuts its gates,     And, from us, locks on them the grates.     Here we, in shining armour white,     Like virgin amazons do fight,     And our chaste lamps we hourly trim,     Lest the great Bridegroom find them dim.     Our orient breaths perfumèd are     With incense of incessant prayer;     And holy-water of our tears     Most strangely our complexion clears;     Not tears of grief, but such as those     With which calm pleasure overflows;     Or pity, when we look on you     That live without this happy vow.     How should we grieve that must be seen     Each one a spouse, and each a queen,     And can in heaven hence behold     Our brighter robes and crowns of gold!     When we have prayèd all our beads,     Some one the holy Legend reads,     While all the rest with needles paint     The face and graces of the Saint;     Some of your features, as we sewed,     Through every shrine should be bestowed,     And in one beauty we would take     Enough a thousand Saints to make.     And (for I dare not quench the fire     That me does for your good inspire)     'Twere sacrilege a man to admit     To holy things for heaven fit.     I see the angels in a crown     On you the lilies showering down;     And round about you glory breaks,     That something more than human speaks.     All beauty when at such a height,     Is so already consecrate.     Fairfax I know, and long ere this     Have marked the youth, and what he is;     But can he such a rival seem,     For whom you heaven should disesteem?     Ah, no! and 'twould more honour prove     He your devoto were than Love.     Here live belovèd and obeyed,     Each one your sister, each your maid,     And, if our rule seem strictly penned,     The rule itself to you shall bend.     Our Abbess, too, now far in age,     Doth your succession near presage.     How soft the yoke on us would lie,     Might such fair hands as yours it tie!     Your voice, the sweetest of the choir,     Shall draw heaven nearer, raise us higher,     And your example, if our head,     Will soon us to perfection lead.     Those virtues to us all so dear,     Will straight grow sanctity when here;     And that, once sprung, increase so fast,     Till miracles it work at last.'\"  What reply was given by the heiress to these arguments, and others of a still more seductive hue, the poet does not tell, but turns to the eager lover who asks, What should he do? He hints that a nunnery is no place for a virtuous maid, and that the nuns (unlike himself, I hope) are only thinking of her property. He complains that though the Court has authorised him to use either peace or force, the nuns still stand upon their guard.      \"Ill-counselled women, do you know     Whom you resist or what you do?\"  Using a most remarkable poetic licence, the poet refers to the fact that this barred-out lover is to be the progenitor of the great Lord Fairfax.      \"Is not this he, whose offspring fierce     Shall fight through all the universe;     And with successive valour try     France, Poland, either Germany,     Till one, as long since prophesied,     His horse through conquered Britain ride?\"  The lover determines to take the place by assault. It was not a very heroic enterprise, as Marvell describes it.      \"Some to the breach, against their foes,     Their wooden Saints in vain oppose;     Another bolder, stands at push,     With their old holy-water brush,     While the disjointed Abbess threads     The jingling chain-shot of her beads;     But their loud'st cannon were their lungs,     And sharpest weapons were their tongues.     But waving these aside like flies,     Young Fairfax through the wall does rise.     Then the unfrequented vault appeared,     And superstition, vainly feared;     The relicks false were set to view;     Only the jewels there were true,     And truly bright and holy Thwaites,     That weeping at the altar waits.     But the glad youth away her bears,     And to the Nuns bequeathes her tears,     Who guiltily their prize bemoan,     Like gypsies who a child have stol'n.\"  The poet then goes on to glorify the results of this union and to describe happy days spent at Nunappleton by the descendants of Isabella Thwaites.      \"At the demolishing, this seat     To Fairfax fell, as by escheat;     And what both nuns and founders willed,     'Tis likely better thus fulfilled.     For if the virgin proved not theirs,     The cloister yet remainèd hers;     Though many a nun there made her vow,     'Twas no religious house till now.     From that blest bed the hero came     Whom France and Poland yet does fame;     Who, when retirèd here to peace,     His "]]]
