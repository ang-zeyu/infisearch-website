He chased the last of the gravy on his plate with a hunk of dark rye, skirting the shriveled derma left behind from his kishka. Ever since the bugouts had inducted Earth into their Galactic Federation, promising to end war, crime, and corruption, he'd found himself at loose ends. His adoptive Earth-mother, who'd named him Hershie Abromowicz, had talked him into meeting her at her favorite restaurant in the heart of Toronto's Gaza Strip.  \"Not a super-villain, he says. Listen to him: mister big-stuff. Well, smartypants, if you're not a super-villain, what was that mess on the television last night then?\"  A busboy refilled their water, and Hershie took a long sip, staring off into the middle distance. Lately, he'd taken to avoiding looking at his mother: her infra-red signature was like a landing-strip for a coronary, and she wouldn't let him take her to one of the bugout clinics for nanosurgery.  Mrs. Abromowicz leaned across the table and whacked him upside the head with one hand, her big rings clicking against the temple of his half-rim specs. Had it been anyone else, he would have caught her hand mid-slap, or at least dodged in a superfast blur, quicker than any human eye. But his Mama had let him know what she thought of _that_ sass before his third birthday. Raising super-infants requires strict, _loving_ discipline. \"Hey, wake up! Hey! I'm talking to you! What was that mess on television last night?\"  \"It was a demonstration, Mama. We were protesting. We want to dismantle the machines of war -- it's in the Torah, Mama. Isaiah: they shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Tot would have approved.\"  Mrs. Abromowicz sucked air between her teeth. \"Your father never would have approved of _that_.\"  _That_ was the Action last night. It had been his idea, and he'd tossed it around with the Movement people who'd planned the demo: they'd gone to an army-surplus store and purchased hundreds of decommissioned rifles, their bores filled with lead, their firing pins defanged. He'd flown above and ahead of the demonstration, in his traditional tights and cape, dragging a cargo net full of rifles from his belt. He pulled them out one at a time, and bent them into balloon-animals -- fanciful giraffes, wiener-dogs, bumble-bees, poodles -- and passed them out the crowds lining Yonge Street. It had been a boffo smash hit. And it made great TV.  Hershie Abromowicz, Man from the Stars, took his mother's hands between his own and looked into her eyes. \"Mama, I'm a grown man. I have a job to do. It's like . . . like a calling. The world's still a big place, bugouts or no bugouts, and there's lots of people here who are crazy, wicked, with their fingers on the triggers. I care about this planet, and I can't sit by when it's in danger.\"  \"But why all of a sudden do you have to be off with these _meshuggenahs_? How come you didn't _need_ to be with the crazy people until now?\"  \"Because there's a _chance_ now. The world is ready to rethink itself. Because --\" The waiter saved him by appearing with the cheque. His mother started to open her purse, but he had his debitcard on the table faster than the eye could follow. \"It's on me, Ma.\"  \"Don't be silly. I'll pay.\"  \"I _want_ to. Let me. A son should take his mother out to lunch once in a while.\"  She smiled, for the first time that whole afternoon, and patted his cheek with one manicured hand. \"You're a good boy, Hershie, I know that. I only want that you should be happy, and have what's best for you.\"  #  Hershie, in tights and cape, was chilling in his fortress of solitude when his comm rang. He checked the callerid and winced: Thomas was calling, from Toronto. Hershie's long-distance bills were killing him, ever since the Department of Defense had cut off his freebie account.  Not to mention that talking to Thomas inevitably led to more trouble with his mother.  He got up off of his crystalline recliner and flipped the comm open, floating up a couple of metres. \"Thomas, what's up?\"  \"Supe, didja see the reviews? The critics _love_ us!\"  Hersh held the comm away from his head and sighed the ancient, put-upon Hebraic sigh of his departed stepfather. Thomas Aquino Rusk liked to play at being a sleazy Broadway producer, his \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17030"],["title","Super Man and the Bug Out (#2)"],["body","plays\" the eye-catching demonstrations he and his band of merry shit-disturbers hijacked.  \"Yeah, it made pretty good vid, all right.\" He didn't ask why Thomas was calling. There was only one reason he _ever_ called: he'd had another idea.  \"You'll never guess why I called.\"  \"You've had an idea.\"  \"I've had an idea!\"  \"Really.\"  \"You'll love it.\"  Hershie reached out and stroked the diamond-faceted coffins that his birth parents lay in, hoping for guidance. His warm fingers slicked with melted hoarfrost, and as they skated over the crypt, it sang a pure, high crystal note like a crippled flying saucer plummeting to the earth. \"I'm sure I will, Thomas.\"  As usual, Thomas chose not to hear the sarcasm in his voice. \"Check this out -- DefenseFest 33 is being held in Toronto in March. And the new keynote speaker is the Patron Ik'Spir Pat! The fricken head fricken bugout! His address is 'Galactic History and Military Tactics: a Strategic Overview.'\"  \"And this is a good thing?\"  \"Ohfuckno. It's terrible, terrible, of course. The bugouts are selling us out. Going over to the Other Side. Just awful. But think of the possibilities!\"  \"But think of the possibilities? Oy.\" Despite himself, Hershie was smiling. Thomas always made him smile.  \"You're smiling, aren't you?\"  \"Shut up, Thomas.\"  \"Can you make a meeting at the Belquees for 18h?\"  Hershie checked his comm. It was 1702h. \"I can make it.\"  \"See you there, buddy.\" Thomas rang off.  Hershie folded his comm, wedged it in his belt, and stroked his parents' crypt, once more, for luck.  #  Hershie loved the commute home. Starting at the Arctic Circle, he flew up and up and up above the highest clouds, then flattened out his body and rode the currents home, eeling around the wet frozen cloudmasses, slaloming through thunderheads, his critical faculties switched off, flying at speed on blind instinct alone.  He usually made visual contact with the surface around Barrie, just outside of Toronto, and he wasn't such a goodiegoodie that he didn't feel a thrill of superiority as he flew over the cottage-country commuters stuck in the end-of-weekend traffic, skis and snowmobiles strapped to their roofs.  #  The Belquees had the best Ethiopian food and the worst Ethiopian decor in town. Successive generations of managers had added their own touches -- tiki-lanterns, textured wallpaper, framed photos of Haile Selassie, tribal spears and grass dolls -- and they'd accreted in layers, until the net effect was of an African rummage sale. But man, the food was good.  Downstairs was a banquet room whose decor consisted of material too ugly to be shown upstairs, with a stage and a disco ball. It had been a regular meeting place for Toronto's radicals for more than fifty years, the chairs worn smooth by generations of left-wing buttocks.  Tonight, it was packed. At least fifty people were crammed around the tables, tearing off hunks of tangy rice-pancake and scooping up vegetarian curry with them. Even before he saw Thomas, his super-hearing had already picked his voice out of the din and located it. Hershie made a beeline for Thomas's table, not making eye-contact with the others -- old-guard activists who still saw him as a tool of the war-machine.  Thomas licked his fingers clean and shook his hand. \"Supe! Glad you could make it! Sit, sit.\" There was a general shuffling of coats and chairs as the other people at the table cleared a space for him. Thomas was already pouring him a beer out of one of the pitchers on the table.  \"Geez, how many people did you invite?\"  Tina, a tiny Chinese woman who could rhyme \"Hey hey, ho ho\" and \"One, two, three, four\" with amazing facility said, \"Everyone's here. The Quakers, the commies, a couple of councilors, the vets, anyone we could think of. This is gonna be _huge_.\"  The food hot, and the different curries and salads were a symphony of flavours and textures. \"This is terrific,\" he said.  \"Best Ethiopian outside of Addis Ababa,\" said Thomas.  _Better than Addis Ababa_, Hershie thought, but didn't say it. He'd been in Addis Ababa as the secret weapon behind Canada's third and most ill-fated peacekeeping mission there. There hadn't been a lot of restaurants open then, just block after block of bombed-out buildings, and tribal warlords driving around in tacticals, firing randomly at anything that moved. The ground CO sent him off to scatter bands of marauders while the bullets spanged off his chest. He'd never understood the tactical significance of those actions -- still didn't -- but at the time, he'd been willing to trust those in authority.  \"Good food,\" he said.  #  An hour later, the pretty waitress had cleared away the platters and brought fresh pitchers, and Hershie's tights felt a little tighter. One of the Quakers, an ancient, skinny man with thin grey hair and sharp, clever features stood up and tapped his beer-mug. Gradually, conversation subsided.  \"Thank you,\" he said. \"My name is Stewart Pocock, and I'm here from the Circle of Friends. I'd like us all to take a moment to say a silent thanks for the wonderful food we've all enjoyed.\"  There was a nervous shuffling, and then a general bowing of heads and mostly silence, broken by low whispers.  \"Thomas, I thought _you_ called this meeting,\" Hershie whispered.  \"I did. These guys always do this. Control freaks. Don't worry about it,\" he whispered back.  \"Thank you all. We took the liberty of drawing up an agenda for this meeting.\"  \"They _always_ do this,\" Thomas said.  The Quakers led them in a round of introductions, which came around to Hershie. \"I'm, uh, The Super Man. I guess most of you know that, right?\" Silence. \"I'm really looking forward to working on this with you all.\" A moment of silence followed, before the next table started in on its own introductions.  #  \"Time,\" Louise Pocock said. Blissfully. At last. The agenda had ticks next to INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND, STRATEGY, THE DAY, SUPPORT AND ORGANISING and PUBLICITY. Thomas had hardly spoken a word through the course of the meeting. Even Hershie's alien buttocks were numb from sitting.  \"It's time for the closing circle. Please, everybody, stand up and hold hands.\" Many of the assembled didn't bother to stifle their groans. Awkwardly, around the tables and the knapsacks, they formed a rough circle and took hands. They held it for an long, painful moment, then gratefully let go.  They worked their way upstairs and outside. The wind had picked up, and it blew Hershie's cape out on a crackling vertical behind him, so that it caught many of the others in the face as they cycled or walked away.  \"Supe, let's you and me grab a coffee, huh?\" Thomas said, without any spin on it at all, so that Hershie knew that it wasn't a casual request.  \"Yeah, sure.\"  #  The cafe Thomas chose was in a renovated bank, and there was a private room in the old vault, and they sat down there, away from prying eyes and autograph hounds.  \"So, you pumped?\" Thomas said, after they ordered coffees.  \"After _that_ meeting? Yeah, sure.\"  Thomas laughed, a slightly patronising but friendly laugh. \"That was a _great_ meeting. Look, if those guys had their way, we'd have about a march a month, and we'd walk slowly down a route that we had a permit for, politely asking people to see our point of view. And in between, we'd have a million meetings like this, where we come up with brilliant ideas like, 'Let's hand out fliers next time.'  \"So what we do is, go along with them. Give them enough rope to hang themselves. Let 'em have four or five of those, until everyone who shows up is so bored, they'll do _anything_, as long as its not that.  \"So, these guys want to stage a sit-in in front of the convention centre. Bo-ring! We wait until they're ready to sit down, then we start playing music and turn it into a _dance-in_. Start playing movies on the side of the building. Bring in a hundred secret agents in costume to add to it. They'll never know what hit 'em.\"  Hershie squirmed. These kinds of Machiavellian shenanigans came slowly to him. \"That seems kind of, well, disingenuous, Thomas. Why don't we just hold our own march?\"  \"And split the movement? No, this is much better. These guys do all the postering and phoning, they get a good crowd out, this is their natural role. Our natural role, my son,\" he placed a friendly hand on Hershie's caped shoulder, \"is to see to it that their efforts aren't defeated by their own poverty of imagination. They're the feet of the movement, but we're its _laugh_.\" Thomas pulled out his comm and scribbled on its surface. \"_They're the feet of the movement, but we're its laugh_, that's great, that's one for the memoirs.\"  #  Hershie decided he needed to patrol a little to clear his head. He scooped trash and syringes from Grenadier Pond. He flew silently through High Park, ears cocked for any muggings.  Nothing.  He patrolled the Gardner Expressway next and used his heat vision to melt some black ice.  Feeling useless, he headed for home.  He was most of the way up Yonge Street when he heard the siren. A cop car, driving fast, down Jarvis. He sighed his father's sigh and rolled east, heading into Regent Park, locating the dopplering siren. He touched down lightly on top of one of the ugly, squat tenements, and skipped from roof to roof, until he spotted the cop. He was beefy, with the traditional moustache and the flak vest that they all wore on downtown patrol. He was leaning against the hood of his cruiser, panting, his breath clouding around him.  A kid rolled on the ground, clutching his groin, gasping for breath. His infrared signature throbbed painfully between his legs. Clearly, he'd been kicked in the nuts.  The cop leaned into his cruiser and lowered the volume on his radio, then, without warning, kicked the kid in the small of the back. The kid rolled on the ice, thrashing painfully.  Before Hershie knew what he was doing, he was hovering over the ice, between the cop and the kid. The cateyes embedded in the emblem on "]]]
