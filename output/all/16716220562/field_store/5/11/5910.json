The expedition, coming from the fief of      Arashtua, must have marched northwards: the Idir in this      case must be the Tchami-Kizildjik, and Mount Sabua the chain      of mountains above Serdesht.  Despairing of taking Amika prisoner, Assur-nazir-pal allowed him to lie hidden among the brushwood of Mount Sabua, while he himself called a halt at Parsindu,* and set to work to organise the fruits of his conquest.       * Parsindu, mentioned between Mount Ilaniu and the town of      Zamru, ought to lie somewhere in the valley of Tchami-      Kizildjik, near Murana.  He placed garrisons in the principal towns---at Parsindu, Zamru, and at Arakdi in Lullumê, which one of his predecessors had re-named Tukulti-Ashshur-azbat,* --I have taken the help of Assur. He next imposed on the surrounding country an annual tribute of gold, silver, lead, copper, dyed stuffs, oxen, sheep, and wine. Envoys from neighbouring kings poured in--from Khudun; Khubushkia, and Gilzân, and the whole of Northern Zamua bowed before the splendour of his arms; it now needed only a few raids resolutely directed against Mounts Azîra and Simaki, as far as the Turn at, to achieve the final pacification of the South. While in this neighbourhood, his attention was directed to the old town of Atlîla,** built by Sibir,*** an ancient king of Karduniash, but which had been half ruined by the barbarians. He re-named it Dur-Assur, the fortress of Assur, and built himself within it a palace and storehouses, in which he accumulated large quantities of corn, making the town the strongest bulwark of his power on the Cossæan border.       *The approximate site of Arakdi is indicated in the      itinerary of Assur-nazir-pal itself; the king comes from      Zamru in the neighbourhood of Sulei-manabad, crosses Mount      Lara, which is the northern part of the Azmir-dagh, and      arrives at Arakdi, possibly somewhere in Surtash. In the      course of the preceding campaign, after having laid waste      Bara, he set out from this same town (Arakdi) to subdue      Nishpi, all of which bears out the position I have      indicated. The present town of Baziân would answer fairly      well for the site of a place destined to protect the      Assyrian frontier on this side.       ** Given its position on the Chaldæan frontier, Atlîla is      probably to be identified with the Kerkuk of the present      day.       *** Hommel is inclined to believe that Sibir was the      immediate predecessor of Nabubaliddin, who reigned at      Babylon at the same time as Assur-nazir-pal at Nineveh;      consequently he would be a contemporary of Rammân-nirâri      III. and of Tukulti-ninip II. Peiser and Rost have      identified him with Simmash-shikhu.  [Illustration: 037.jpg THE ZAB BELOW THE PASSES OF ALAN, THE ANCIENT ILANIU]       Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by M. de Morgan.  The two campaigns of B.C. 882 and 881 had cost Assur-nazir-pal great efforts, and their results had been inadequate to the energy expended. His two principal adversaries, Nurrammân and Amika, had eluded him, and still preserved their independence at the eastern extremities of their former states. Most of the mountain tribes had acknowledged the kings supremacy merely provisionally, in order to rid themselves of his presence; they had been vanquished scores of times, but were in no sense subjugated, and the moment pressure was withdrawn, they again took up arms. The districts of Zamua alone, which bordered on the Assyrian plain, and had been occupied by a military force, formed a province, a kind of buffer state between the mountain tribes and the plains of the Zab, protecting the latter from incursions.  Assur-nazir-pal, feeling himself tolerably safe on that side, made no further demands, and withdrew his battalions to the westward part of his northern frontier. He hoped, no doubt, to complete the subjugation of the tribes who still contested the possession of various parts of the Kashiari, and then to push forward his main guard as far as the Euphrates and the Arzania, so as to form around the plain of Amidi a zone of vassals or tutelary subjects like those of Zamua. With this end in view, he crossed the Tigris near its source at the traditional fords, and made his way unmolested in the bend of the Euphrates from the palace of Tilluli, where the accustomed tribute of Kummukh was brought to him, to the fortress of Ishtarâti, and from thence to Kibaki. The town of Matiatê, having closed its gates against him, was at once sacked, and this example so stimulated the loyalty of the Kurkhi chiefs, that they ha*tened to welcome him at the neighbouring military station of Zazabukha. The kings progress continued thence as before, broken by frequent halts at the most favourable points for levying contributions on the inhabitants.1 Assur-nazir-pal encountered no serious difficulty except on the northern slopes of the Kashiari, but there again fortune smiled on him; all the contested positions were soon ceded to him, including even Madara, whose fourfold circuit of walls did not avail to save it from the conqueror.** After a brief respite at Tushkhân, he set out again one evening with his lightest chariots and the pick of his horsemen, crossed the Tigris on rafts, rode all night, and arrived unexpectedly the next morning before Pitura, the chief town of the Dirrabans.*** It was surrounded by a strong double enceinte, through which he broke after forty-eight hours of continuous assault: 800 of its men perished in the breach, and 700 others were impaled before the gates.       * It is difficult to place any of these localities on the      map: they ought all to be found between the ford of the      Tigris, at Diarbeldr and the Euphrates, probably at the foot      of the Mihrab-dagh and the Kirwântchernen-dagh.       ** Madara belonged to a certain Lapturi, son of Tubusi,      mentioned in the campaign of the kings second year. In      comparing the facts given in the two passages, we see it was      situated on the eastern slope of the Kashiari, not far from      Tushkhan on one side, and Ardupa--that is probably Mardin--?      on the other. The position of Ortaveran, or of one of the      tells in its neighbourhood, answers fairly well to these      conditions.       *** According to the details given in the _Annals_, we must      place the town of Bitura (or Pitura) at about 19 miles from      Kurkh, on the other side of the Tigris, in a north-easterly      direction, and consequently the country of Lirrâ would be      between the Hazu-tchaî and the Batman-tchaî. The Matni, with      its passes leading in to Naîri, must in this case be the      mountain group to the north of Mayafarrikîn, known as the      Dordoseh-dagh or the Darkôsh-dagh.  Arbaki, at the extreme limits of Eirkhi, was the next to succumb, after which the Assyrians, having pillaged Dirra, carried the passes of Matni after a bloody combat, spread themselves over Naîri, burning 250 of its towns and villages, and returned with immense booty to Tushkhân. They had been there merely a few days when the newt arrived that the people of Bît-Zamâni, always impatient of the yoke, had murdered their prince Ammibaal, and had proclaimed a certain Burramman in his place. Assur-nazir-pal marched upon Sinabux and repressed the insurrection, reaping a rich harvest of spoil--chariots fully equipped, 600 draught-horses, 130 pounds of silver and as much of gold, 6600 pounds of lead and the same of copper, 19,800 pounds of iron, stuffs, furniture in gold and ivory, 2000 bulls, 500 sheep, the entire harem of Ammibaal, besides a number of maidens of noble family together with their dresses. Burramman was by the kings order flayed alive, and Arteanu his brother chosen as his successor. Sinabu* and the surrounding towns formed part of that network of colonies which in times past Shalmaneser I. had organised as a protection from the incursions of the inhabitants of Naîri; Assur-nazir-pal now used it as a rallying-place for the remaining Assyrian families, to whom he distributed lands and confided the guardianship of the neighbouring strongholds.       * Hommel thinks that Sinabu is very probably the same as the      Kinabu mentioned above; but it appears from Assur-nazir-      pals own account that this Kinabu was in the province of      Khalzidipkha (Khalzilukha) on the Kashiari, whereas Sinabu      was in Bît-Zamâni.  The results of this measure were not long in making themselves felt: Shupria, Ulliba, and Nirbu, besides other districts, paid their dues to the king, and Shura in Khamanu,* which had for some time held out against the general movement, was at length constrained to submit (880 B.C.).       * Shur is mentioned on the return to Nairi, possibly on the      road leading from Amidi and Tushkhân to Nineveh. Hommel      believes that the country of Khamanu was the Amanos in      Cilicia, and he admits, but unwillingly, that Assur-nazir-      pal made a detour beyond the Euphrates. I should look for      Shura, and consequently for Khamanu, in the Tur-Abdin, and      should identify them with Saur, in spite of the difference      of the two initial articulations.  However high we may rate the value of this campaign, it was eclipsed by the following one. The Aramæans on the Khabur and the middle Euphrates had not witnessed without anxiety the revival of Ninevite activity, and had begged for assistance against it from its rival. Two of their principal tribes, the Sukhi and the Laqi, had addressed themselves to the sovereign then reigning at Babylon. He was a restless, ambitious prince, named Nabu-baliddin, who asked nothing better than to excite a hostile feeling against his neighbour, provided he ran no risk by his interference of being drawn into open warfare. He accordingly despatched to the Prince of Sukhi the best of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17327"],["title","History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 7 (of 12) (#7)"],["body","Cossoan troops, commanded by his brother Zabdanu and one of the great officers of the crown, Bel-baliddin. In the spring of 879 B.C., Assur-nazir-pal determined once for all to put an end to these intrigues. He began by inspecting the citadels flanking the line of the Kharmish* and the Khabur,--Tabiti,** Magarisi,*** Shadikanni, Shuru in Bît-Khafupi, and Sirki.****       * The Kharmish has been identified with the Hirmâs, the      river flowing by Nisibis, and now called the Nahr-Jaghjagha.       ** Tabiti is the Thebeta (Thebet) of Roman itineraries and      Syrian writers, situated 33 miles from Nisibis and 52 from      Singara, on the Nahr-Hesawy or one of the neighbouring      wadys.       *** Magarisi ought to be found on the present Nahr-      Jaghjagha, near its confluence with the Nahr-Jerrâhi and its      tributaries; unfortunately, this part of Mesopotamia is      still almost entirely unexplored, and no satisfactory map of      it exists as yet.       **** Sirki is Circesium at the mouth of the Khabur.  Between the embouchures of the Khabur and the Balîkh, the Euphrates winds across a vast table-land, ridged with marly hills; the left bank is dry and sterile, shaded at rare intervals by sparse woods of poplars or groups of palms. The right bank, on the contrary, is seamed with fertile valleys, sufficiently well watered to permit the growth of cereals and the raising of cattle. The river-bed is almost everywhere wide, but strewn with dangerous rocks and sandbanks which render navigation perilous. On nearing the ruins of Halebiyeh, the river narrows as it enters the Arabian hills, and cuts for itself a regular defile of three or four hundred paces in length, which is approached by the pilots with caution.*       * It is at this defile of El-Hammeh, and not at that of      Birejik at the end of the Taurus, that we must place the      _Khinqi sha Purati_--the narrows of the Euphrates--so often      mentioned in the account of this campaign.  Assur-nazir-pal, on leaving Sirki, made his way along the left bank, levying toll on Supri, Naqarabâni, and several other villages in his course. Here and there he called a halt facing some town on the opposite bank, but the boats which could have put him across had been removed, and the fords were too well guarded to permit of his hazarding an attack. One town, however, Khindânu, made him a voluntary offering which, he affected to regard as a tribute, but Kharidi and Anat appeared not even to suspect his presence in their vicinity, and he continued on his way without having obtained from them anything which could be construed into a mark of vassalage.*       * The detailed narrative of the _Annals_ informs us that      Assur-nazir-pal encamped on a mountain between Khindânu and      Bît-Shabaia, and this information enables us to determine on      the map with tolerable certainty the localities mentioned in      this campaign. The mountain in question can be none other      than El-Hammeh, the only one met with on this bank of the      Euphrates between the confluents of the Euphrates and the      Khabur. Khindânu is therefore identical with the ruins of      Tabus, the Dabausa of Ptolemy; hence Supri and Naqabarâni      are situated between this point and Sirki, the former in the      direction of Tayebeh, the latter towards El-Hoseîniyeh. On      the other hand, the ruins of Kabr Abu-Atîsh would correspond      very well to Bît-Shabaia: is the name of Abu-Sbé borne by      the Arabs of that neighbourhood a relic of that of Shabaia.      Kharidi ought in that case to be looked for on the opposite      bank, near Abu-Subân and Aksubi, where Chesney points out      ancient remains. A days march beyond Kabr Abu-Atîsh brings      us to El-Khass, so that the town of Anat would be in the      Isle of Moglah. Shuru must be somewhere near one of the two      Tell-Menakhîrs on this side the Balikh.  [Illustration: 044.jpg THE CAMPAIGNS OF ASSUR-NAZIR-PAL IN MESOPOTAMIA]  At length, on reaching Shuru, Shadadu, the Prince of Sukhi, trusting in his Cossoans, offered him battle; but he was defeated by Assur-nazir-pal, who captured the King of Babylons brother, forced his way into the town after an assault lasting two days, and returned to Assyria laden with spoil. This might almost be considered as a repulse; for no sooner had the king quitted the country than the Aramaeans in their turn crossed the Euphrates and ravaged the plains of the Khabur.* Assur-nazir-pal resolved not to return until he was in a position to carry his arms into the heart of the enemys country. He built a flotilla at Shuru in Bît-Khalupi on which he embarked his troops. Wherever the navigation of the Euphrates proved to be difficult, the boats were drawn up out of the water and dragged along the banks over rollers until they could again be safely launched; thus, partly afloat and partly on land, they passed through the gorge of Halebiyeh, landed at Kharidi, and inflicted a salutary punishment on the cities which had defied the kings wrath on his last expedition. Khindânu, Kharidi, and Kipina were reduced to ruins, and the Sukhi and the Laqi defeated, the Assyrians pursuing them for two days in the Bisuru mountains as far as the frontiers of Bit-Adini.**       * The _Annals_ do not give us either the _limmu_ or the date      of the year for this new expedition. The facts taken      altogether prove that it was a continuation of the preceding      one, and it may therefore be placed in the year B.C. 878.       ** The campaign of B.C. 878 had for its arena that of the      Euphrates which lies between the Khabur and the Balikh; this      time, however, the principal operations took place on the      right bank. If Mount Bisuru is the Jebel-Bishri, the town of      Kipina, which is mentioned between it and Kharidi, ought to      be located between Maidân and Sabkha.  A complete submission was brought about, and its permanency secured by the erection of two strongholds, one of which, Kar-assur-nazir-pal, commanded the left, and the other, Nibarti-assur, the right bank of the Euphrates.*  This last expedition had brought the king into contact with the most important of the numerous Aramaean states congregated in the western region of Mesopotamia. This was Bît-Adini, which lay on both sides of the middle course of the Euphrates.** It included, on the right bank, to the north of Carchemish, between the hills on the Sajur and Arabân-Su, a mountainous but fertile district, dotted over with towns and fortresses, the names of some of which have been preserved--Pakarrukhbuni, Sursunu, Paripa, Dabigu, and Shitamrat.*** Tul-Barsip, the capital, was situated on the left bank, commanding the fords of the modern Birejîk,**** and the whole of the territory between this latter and the Balîkh acknowledged the rule of its princes, whose authority also extended eastwards as far as the basaltic plateau of Tul-Abâ, in the Mesopotamian desert.       * The account in the Annals is confused, and contains      perhaps some errors with regard to the facts. The site of      the two towns is nowhere indicated, but a study of the map      shows that the Assyrians could not become masters of the      country without occupying the passes of the Euphrates; I am      inclined to think that Kar-assur-nazir-pal is El-Halebiyeh,      and Nibarti-assur, Zalebiyeh, the Zenobia of Roman times.       ** Bît-Adini appears to have occupied, on the right bank of      the Euphrates, a part of the cazas of Aîn-Tab, Rum-kaleh,      and Birejîk, that of Suruji, minus the nakhiyeh of Harrân,      the larger part of the cazas of Membîj and of Rakkah, and      part of the caza of Zôr, the cazas being those represented      on the maps of Vital Cuinet.       *** None of these localities can be identified with      certainty, except perhaps Dabigu, a name we may trace in      that of the modern village of Dehbek.       **** Tul-Barsip has been identified with Birejîk.  To the south-east, Bît-Adini bordered upon the country of the Sukhi and the Laqi,* lying to the east of Assyria; other principalities, mainly of Aramoan origin, formed its boundary to the north and north-west--Shugab in the bend of the Euphrates, from Birejîk to Samosata,** Tul-Abnî around Edessa,*** the district of Harrân,**** Bît-Zamani, Izalla in the Tektek-dagh and on the Upper Khabur, and Bît-Bakhiâni in the plain extending from the Khabur to the Kharmish.^       * In his previous campaign Assur-nazir-pal had taken two      towns of Bît-Adini, situated on the right bank of the      Euphrates, at the eastern extremity of Mount Bisuru, near      the frontier of the Lâqi.       ** The country of Shugab is mentioned between Birejîk (Tul-      Barsip) and Bît-Zamani, in one of the campaigns of      Shalmaneser III., which obliges us to place it in the caza      of Rum-kaleh; the name has been read Sumu.       *** Tul-Abnî, which was at first sought for near the sources      of the Tigris, has been placed in the Mesopotamian plain.      The position which it occupies among the other names obliges      us to put it near Bît-Adini and Bît-Zamani: the only      possible site that I can find for it is at Orfah, the Edessa      of classical times.       **** The country of Harrân is nowhere mentioned as belonging      either to Bît-Adini or to Tul-Abnî: we must hence conclude      that at this period it formed a little principality      independent of those two states.       ^ The situation of Bît-Bakhiâni is shown by the position      which it occupies in the account of the campaign, and by the      names associated with it in another passage of the _Annals_.  Bît-Zamani had belonged to Assyria by right of conquest ever since the death of Ammibaal; Izalla and Bît-Bakhiâni had fulfilled their duties as vassals whenever Assur-nazir-pal had appeared in their neighbourhood; Bît-Adini alone had remained independent, though its strength was more apparent than real.
