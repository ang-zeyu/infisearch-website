The door swung open a trifle and the pale face of Borkins appeared around it. His eyes were wide with fright, his mouth hung open.  \"Sir Nigel, sir. I 'eard a dreadful noise--like a pistol shot it was, comin' from this room! Anythink the matter, sir?\"  \"Nothing, you ass!\" broke out Merriton, fretfully, as the butler began to show other parts of his anatomy round the corner of the door. \"Come in, or go out, which ever you please. But for the Lord's sake, do one or the other! There's a beastly draught. The noise you heard was that window which possibly hasn't been opened for a century or two, groaning in pain at being forced into action again! Can't sleep in this beastly room--haven't closed my eyes yet--and when I did get out of that Victorian atrocity over there and take to the sofa by the window, why, the first thing I saw were those flames flickering out across the horizon like signal-fires, or _something_! I've been watching them for the past twenty minutes and they've got on my nerves. I'm goin' out to investigate.\"  Borkins gave a little exclamation of alarm and put one trembling hand over his face. Merriton suddenly registered the fact as being a symptom of the state of nerves which Merriton Towers was likely to reduce one. Then Borkins shambled across the room and laid a timid hand upon Merriton's arm.  \"For Gawd's sake sir--_don't_!\" he murmured in a shaken voice. \"Those lights, sir--if you knew the story! If you values your life at any price at all don't go out, sir, and investigate them. _Don't!_ You're a dead man in the morning if you do.\"  \"What's that?\" Merriton swung round and looked into the weak, rather watery, blue eyes of his butler. \"What the devil do you mean, Borkins, talkin' a lot of rot? What _are_ those flames, anyway? And why in heaven's name shouldn't I go out and investigate 'em if I want to? Who's to stop me?\"  \"I, your lordship--if I ever 'as any influence with 'uman nature!\" returned Borkins, vehemently. \"The story's common knowledge, Sir Nigel, sir. Them there flames is supernatural. Frozen flames the villagers calls 'em, because they don't seem to give out no 'eat. That part of the Fens in unin'abited and there isn't a soul in the whole village as would venture anywhere near it after dark.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Because they never comes back, that's why, sir!\" said Borkins. \"'Tisn't any old wives' tale neither. There's been cases by the score. Only a matter of six months ago one of the boys from the mill, who was somewhat the worse for liquor, said he was a-goin' ter see who it was wot made them flames light up by theirselves, and--he never came back. And that same night another flame was added to the number!\"  \"Whew! Bit of a tall story that, Borkins!\" Nevertheless a cold chill crept over Merriton's bones and he gave a forced, mirthless laugh.  \"As true as the gospel, Sir Nigel!\" said Borkins, solemnly. \"That's what always 'appens. Every time any one ventures that way--well, they're a-soundin' their own death-knell, so to speak, and you kin see the new light appear. But there's never no trace of the person that ventured out across the Fens at evening time. He, or she--a girl tried it once, Lord save 'er!--vanishes off the face of the earth as clean as though they'd never been born. Gawd alone knows what it is that lives there, or what them flames may be, but I tells you it's sheer death to attempt to see for yourself, so long as night lasts. And in the morning--well, it's gone, and there isn't a thing to be seen for the lookin'!\"  \"Merciful powers! What a peculiar thing!\" Despite his mockery of the supernatural, Merriton could not help but feel a sort of awe steal over him, at the tale as told by Borkins in the eeriest hour of the whole twenty-four--that which hangs between darkness and dawn. Should he go or shouldn't he? He was a fool to believe the thing, and yet--He certainly didn't want to die yet awhile, with Antoinette Brellier a mere handful of yards away from him, and all the days his own to cultivate her acquaintance in.  \"You've fairly made my flesh creep with your beastly story!\" he said, in a rather high-pitched voice. \"Might have reserved it until morning--after my _d√©but_ in this haunt of spirits, Borkins. Consider my nerves. India's made a hash of 'em. Get back to bed, man, and don't worry over my investigations. I swear I won't venture out, to-night at any rate. Perhaps to-morrow I may have summoned up enough courage, but I've no fancy for funerals yet awhile. So you can keep your pleasant little reminiscences for another time, and I'll give you my word of honour that I'll do nothing rash!\"  Borkins gave a sigh of relief. He passed his hand over his forehead, and his eyes--rather shifty, rather narrow, pale blue eyes which Merriton had instinctively disliked (he couldn't tell why)--lightened suddenly.  \"Thank Gawd for that, sir!\" he said, solemnly. \"You've relieved my mind on that score. I've always thought--your poor uncle, Sir Joseph Merriton--and those flames there might 'ave been the reason for his disappearance, though of course--\"  \"What's that?\" Merriton turned round and looked at him, his brow furrowed, the whole personality of the man suddenly awake. \"My uncle, Borkins? How long have these--er--lights been seen hereabouts? I don't remember them as a child.\"  \"Oh, mostly always, I believe, sir; though they ain't been much noticed before the last four years,\" replied Borkins. \"I think--yes--come August next. Four years--was the first time my attention was called to 'em.\"  Merriton's laugh held a note of relief.  \"Then you needn't have worried. My uncle has been missing for a little more than _five_ years, and that, therefore, when he did disappear the flames obviously had nothing to do with it!\"  Borkins's wrinkled, parchment-like cheeks went a dull, unhealthy red. He opened his mouth to speak and then drew back again. Merriton gave him a keen glance.  \"Of course, how foolish of me. As you say, sir, impossible!\" he stammered out, bowing backward toward the door. \"I'll be getting back to my bed again, and leave you to finish your rest undisturbed. I'm sorry to 'ave troubled you, I'm sure, sir, only I was afraid something 'ad 'appened.\"  \"That's all right. Good-night,\" returned Merriton curtly, and turned the key in the lock as the door closed. He stood for a moment thinking, his eyes upon the winking, flickering points of light that seemed dimmer in the fast growing light. \"Now why did he make that bloomer about dates, I wonder? Uncle's been gone five years--and Borkins knew it. He was here at the time, and yet why did he suggest that old wives' tale as a possible solution of the disappearance? Borkins, my lad, there's more behind those watery blue eyes of yours than men may read. Hmm! ... Now I wonder why the deuce he lied to me?\"     CHAPTER III  SUNSHINE AND SHADOW   When Merriton shaved himself next morning he laughed at the reflection that the mirror cast back at him. For he looked for all the world as though he had been up all night and his knee was painful and rather stiff, as though he had strained some ligament in it.  \"Beastly place is beginning to make its mark on me already!\" he said, as he lathered his chin. \"My eyes look as though they had been stuck in with burnt cork, and--the devil take my shaky hand! And that railroad business yesterday helps it along. A nice state of affairs for a chap of my age, I must say! Scared as a kid at an old wives' story. Borkins is a fool, and I'm an idiot.... Damn! there's a bit off my chin for a start. I hope to goodness no one takes it into their heads to pay me a visit to-day.\"  His hopes, however, in this direction were not to be realized, for as the afternoon wore itself slowly away in a ramble round the old place, and through the stables--which in their day had been famous--the big, harsh-throated doorbell rang, and Merriton, in the very act of telling Borkins that he was officially \"not in,\" happened to catch a glimpse of something light and fluffy through the stained-glass of the door, and suddenly kept his counsel.  A few seconds later Borkins ushered in two visitors. Merriton, prepared by the convenient glass for the appearance of one was nevertheless not unpleased to see the other. For the names that Borkins rolled off his tongue with much relish were those of \"Miss Brellier and Mr. Brellier, sir.\"  His lady of the thrice blessed wreck! His lady of the dainty accent and glorious eyes.  His face glowed suddenly and he crossed the big room in a couple of strides and in the next second was holding Antoinette's hand rather longer than was necessary, and was looking down into the rouguish greeny-gray eyes that had captivated him only yesterday, when for one terrible, glorious moment he had held her in his arms, while the railroad coach dissolved around them.  \"Are you fit to be about?\" he said, his voice ringing with the very evident pleasure that he felt at this meeting with her, and his eyes wandering to where a strip of pink court plaster upon her forehead showed faintly through the screen of hair that covered it. Then he dropped her hand and turned toward the man who stood a pace or two behind her tiny figure, looking at him with the bluest, youngest eyes he had ever looked into.  \"Mr. Brellier, is it not? Very good of you, sir, to come across in this neighbourly fashion. Won't you sit down?\"  \"Yes,\" said Antoinette, gaily, \"my uncle. I brought him right over by telling him of our adventure.\"  The man was tall and heavily built, with a wealth of black hair thickly streaked with gray, and a trim, well-kept \"imperial\" which gave him the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17180"],["title","The Riddle of the Frozen Flame (#3)"],["body","air that his name carried out so well. His morning suit was extremely well cut, and his whole bearing that of the well-to-do man about town. Merriton registered all this in his mind's eye, and was secretly very glad of it. They were two thoroughbreds--that was easy to see.  And as for Antoinette! Well, he could barely keep his eyes from her. She was lovelier than ever, and clad this afternoon in all the fluffy femininity that every man loves. Anything more intoxicatingly delicious Merriton had never seen outside of his own dreams.  \"It was certainly ripping of you both to come,\" he said nervously, feeling all hands and feet. \"Never saw such a lonely spot in all my life, by George, as this house! It fairly gives you the creeps!\"  \"Indeed?\" Brellier laughed in a deep, full-throated voice. \"For my part the loneliness is what so much appeals to me. When one has spent a busy life travelling to and fro over the world, m'sieur, one can but appreciate the peaceful backwaters which are so often to be found in this very dear, very delightful England of yours. But that is not the mission upon which I come. I have to thank you, sir, for the great kindness and consideration you displayed to my niece yesterday.\"  His English was excellent, and he spoke with the clipped, careful accent of the foreigner, which Merriton found fascinating. He had already succumbed to something of the same thing in Antoinette. He was beginning to enjoy himself very much indeed.  \"There was no need for thanks--none at all.... What is your opinion of the Towers, Miss Brellier?\" he asked suddenly, leaning forward toward her, anxious to change the conversation.  She shrugged her shoulders.  \"That is hardly a fair question to ask!\" she responded, \"when I have been in it but a matter of five minutes or more. But everything to me is enchanting! The architecture, the furnishings, the very atmosphere--\"  \"Brrh! If you could have been here last night!\" He gave a mock shudder and broke it with a laugh. \"Why, a truly haunted house wasn't a patch on it! If this place hasn't got a ghost, well then I'll eat my hat! I could fairly hear 'em, dozens and dozens of them, clinking and clanking all over the place. And if you could see my room! I sleep in a four-poster as big as a suburban villa, and every now and again the furniture gives a comfy little crack or two, like someone practising with a pistol, just to remind me that my great-great-great-grandmother's ghost is sitting in the wardrobe and watching over me with true great-etc.-grandmotherly conscientiousness.... I say, do you ride? There ought to be some rippin' rides round here, if my memory doesn't fail me.\"  She nodded, and the conversation took a turn that Sir Nigel found more than pleasant, and the time passed most agreeably.  Merriton, only anxious to entertain his guests, suddenly exploded the bomb which shattered that afternoon's enjoyment for all three of them.  \"By the way,\" he remarked, \"last night, while I was lying awake I saw a lot of funny flames dancing up and down upon the horizon. Seemed as though they lay in the marshes between your place and mine, Mr. Brellier. Borkins pulled a long story about 'em with all the usual trimmin's. Said they were supernatural and all that. Ever seen 'em yourself? I must say they gave me a bit of a turn. I'm not keen on spirits--except in bottle form (which by the way is a rotten bad pun, Miss Brellier,) but in India one gets chockful of that sort of thing, and there never seems to be any rational explanation. It leaves you feeling funny. What's your opinion of 'em? For seen 'em you must have done, as they seem to be the talk of the whole village from what Borkins says.\"  Antoinette's spoon tinkled in the saucer of the tea-cup she was holding and her face went white. Brellier shifted his eyes. A sort of tension had settled suddenly over the pleasant room.  \"I--well, to tell you the truth, I can't explain 'em myself!\" Brellier said at last, clearing his throat with signs of genuine nervousness. \"They seem to be inexplicable. I have seen them--yes, many, many times. And so has 'Toinette, but the stories afloat about them are rather--unpleasant, and like a wise man I have kept myself free of investigation. I do hope you'll do the same, Sir Nigel. One never knows, and although one cannot always believe the silly things which the villagers prattle about, it is as well to be on the safe side. As you say, these things sometimes lack a rational explanation. I should be sorry to think you were likely to run into any unnecessary danger.\" He bent his head and Merriton could see that his fingers twitched.  \"Borkins actually told me stories of people who had disappeared in a mysterious manner and were never found again,\" he remarked casually.  Brellier shrugged his shoulders. He spread out his hands.  \"Among the uneducated--what would you? But it is so, even since I myself have been in residence at Withersby Hall--something like three and a half years--there have been several mysterious disappearances, Sir Nigel, and all directly traceable to a foolhardy desire to investigate these phenomena. For myself, I leave well enough alone. I trust you are going to do likewise?\"  His eyes searched Merriton's face anxiously. There was a worried furrow between his brows.  Merriton laughed, and at the sound, 'Toinette, who had sat perfectly still during the discussion of the mystery, gave a little cry of alarm and covered her ears with her hands.  \"I beg of you,\" she broke out excitedly, \"please, please do not talk about it! The whole affair frightens me! Uncle will laugh I know, but--I am terrified of those little flames, Sir Nigel, more terrified than I can say! If you speak of them any more, I must go--really! Please, _please_ don't dream of trying to find out what they are, Sir Nigel! It--it would upset me very much indeed if you attempted so foolish a thing!\"  Merriton's first sensation at hearing this was pleasure that he was capable of upsetting her over his own personal welfare. Then the something sinister about the whole story, which seemed to affect every one with whom he came into touch, swept over him. A number of otherwise rational human beings scared out of their wits over some mysterious flames on the edge of the Fens at night time, seemed, in the face of this glorious summer's afternoon, to be little short of ridiculous. He tried to throw the idea off but could not. 'Toinette's pale face kept coming before him; the sudden dropping of her spoon struck an unpleasant chord in his memory. Brellier's attitude merely added fuel to the fire and soon they rose to go, Merriton following them to the door.  \"Don't forget, then, Miss Brellier, that you are booked to me for a ride on Thursday,\" he said, laughingly.  She nodded to him and gave his hand a little squeeze at parting.  \"I shall not forget, Sir Nigel. But--you will promise me,\" her voice dropped a tone or two, \"you will promise me that you will not try and find out what those--those flames are, won't you? I could not sleep if you did.\" And they were gone.  Merriton stood awhile in silence, his brows puckered and his mouth stern. First Borkins, and then Brellier, and now--_her_! All of them begging him almost upon their knees to forego a perfectly harmless little quest of discovery. There seemed to his mind something almost fishy about it all. What then were these \"Frozen Flames\"? What secret did they hide? And what malignant power dwelt behind the screen of their mystery?     CHAPTER IV  AN EVIL GENIUS   Thus, despite the bad beginning at Merriton Towers the weeks that followed were filled with happiness for Merriton. His acquaintance with 'Toinette flourished and that charming young woman grew to mean more and more to the man who had led such a lonely life.  And so one day wove itself into another with the joy of sunlight over both their lives. He took to going regularly to Withersby Hall, and became an expected guest, dropping in at all hours to wile away an hour or two in 'Toinette's company, or else to have a quiet game of billiards with Brellier, or a cigar in company with both of them, in the garden, while the sun was still up. He never mentioned the flames to them again. But he never investigated them either. He had promised 'Toinette that, though he often watched them from his bedroom window, at night, watched them and wondered, and thought a good deal about Borkins and how he had lied to him about his uncle's disappearance upon that first night. Between Borkins and himself there grew up a spirit of distrust which he regretted yet did nothing to counteract. In fact it is to be feared that he did his best at times to irritate the staid old man who had been in the family so long. Borkins _did_ amuse him, and he couldn't help leading him on. Borkins, noting this attitude, drew himself into himself and his face became mask-like in its impassivity.  But if Borkins became a stone image whenever Merriton was about, his effusiveness was over-powering at such times as Mr. Brellier paid a visit to the Towers. He followed both Brellier and his niece wherever they went like a shadow. Jokingly one day, Merriton had made the remark: \"Borkins might be your factotum rather than mine, Mr. Brellier; indeed I've no doubt he would be, if the traditions of the house had not so long lain in his hands.\" He was rewarded for this remark by a sudden tightening of Brellier's lips, and then by an equally sudden smile. They were very good friends these days--Brellier and Merriton, and got on very excellently together.  And then, as the days wore themselves away and turned into months, Merriton woke up to the fact that he could wait no longer before putting his luck to the test so far as 'Toinette was concerned. He had already confided his secret to Brellier, who laughed and patted him on the back and told him that he had known of it a long time and wished him luck. It wasn't long after this he was telling Brellier the good news that 'Toin"]]]
