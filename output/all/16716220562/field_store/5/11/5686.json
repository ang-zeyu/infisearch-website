Each atom of our physical nature is vibrating with unimaginable rapidity. Change is identical with life.\"  \"It sometimes seems,\" said the sculptor, \"as if thoughts evaporated like water.\"  \"Why not, under favorable conditions?\"  \"But where do they go? Surely they cannot perish utterly?\"  \"Yes, that is the question. Or, rather, it is not a question. Nothing is ever lost in the spiritual universe.\"  \"But what,\" inquired Ernest, \"is the particular reason for your reflection?\"  \"It is this,\" the sculptor replied; \"I had a striking motive and lost it.\"  \"Do you remember,\" he continued, speaking to Reginald, \"the Narcissus I was working on the last time when you called at my studio?\"  \"Yes; it was a striking thing and impressed me very much, though I cannot recall it at the moment.\"  \"Well, it was a commission. An eccentric young millionaire had offered me eight thousand dollars for it. I had an absolutely original conception. But I cannot execute it. It's as if a breeze had carried it away.\"  \"That is very regrettable.\"  \"Well, I should say so,\" replied the sculptor.  Ernest smiled. For everybody knew of Walkham's domestic troubles. Having twice figured in the divorce court, he was at present defraying the expenses of three households.  The sculptor had meanwhile seated himself at Reginald's writing-table, unintentionally scanning a typewritten page that was lying before him. Like all artists, something of a madman and something of a child, he at first glanced over its contents distractedly, then with an interest so intense that he was no longer aware of the impropriety of his action.  \"By Jove!\" he cried. \"What is this?\"  \"It's an epic of the French Revolution,\" Reginald replied, not without surprise.  \"But, man, do you know that I have discovered my motive in it?\"  \"What do you mean?\" asked Ernest, looking first at Reginald and then at Walkham, whose sanity he began to doubt.  \"Listen!\"  And the sculptor read, trembling with emotion, a long passage whose measured cadence delighted Ernest's ear, without, however, enlightening his mind as to the purport of Walkham's cryptic remark.  Reginald said nothing, but the gleam in his eye showed that this time, at least, his interest was alert.  Walkham saw the hopelessness of making clear his meaning without an explanation.  \"I forget you haven't a sculptor's mind. I am so constituted that, with me, all impressions are immediately translated into the sense of form. I do not hear music; I see it rise with domes and spires, with painted windows and Arabesques. The scent of the rose is to me tangible. I can almost feel it with my hand. So your prose suggested to me, by its rhythmic flow, something which, at first indefinite, crystallised finally into my lost conception of Narcissus.\"  \"It is extraordinary,\" murmured Reginald. \"I had not dreamed of it.\"  \"So you do not think it rather fantastic?\" remarked Ernest, circumscribing his true meaning.  \"No, it is quite possible. Perhaps his Narcissus was engaging the sub-conscious strata of my mind while I was writing this passage. And surely it would be strange if the undercurrents of our mind were not reflected in our style.\"  \"Do you mean, then, that a subtle psychologist ought to be able to read beneath and between our lines, not only what we express, but also what we leave unexpressed?\"  \"Undoubtedly.\"  \"Even if, while we are writing, we are unconscious of our state of mind? That would open a new field to psychology.\"  \"Only to those that have the key, that can read the hidden symbols. It is to me a matter-of-course that every mind-movement below or above the threshold of consciousness must, of a necessity, leave its imprint faintly or clearly, as the case may be, upon our activities.\"  \"This may explain why books that seem intolerably dull to the majority, delight the hearts of the few,\" Ernest interjected.  \"Yes, to the few that possess the key. I distinctly remember how an uncle of mine once laid down a discussion on higher mathematics and blushed fearfully when his innocent wife looked over his shoulder. The man who had written it was a rou√©.\"  \"Then the seemingly most harmless books may secretly possess the power of scattering in young minds the seed of corruption,\" Walkham remarked.  \"If they happen to understand,\" Clarke observed thoughtfully. \"I can very well conceive of a lecherous text-book of the calculus, or of a reporter's story of a picnic in which burnt, under the surface, undiscoverable, save to the initiate, the tragic passion of Tristram and Iseult.\"     VI   Several weeks had elapsed since the conversation in Reginald Clarke's studio. The spring was now well advanced and had sprinkled the meadows with flowers, and the bookshelves of the reviewers with fiction. The latter Ernest turned to good account, but from the flowers no poem blossomed forth. In writing about other men's books, he almost forgot that the springtide had brought to him no bouquet of song. Only now and then, like a rippling of water, disquietude troubled his soul.  The strange personality of the master of the house had enveloped the lad's thoughts with an impenetrable maze. The day before Jack had come on a flying visit from Harvard, but even he was unable to free Ernest's soul from the obsession of Reginald Clarke.  Ernest was lazily stretching himself on a couch, waving the smoke of his cigarette to Reginald, who was writing at his desk.  \"Your friend Jack is delightful,\" Reginald remarked, looking up from his papers. \"And his ebon-coloured hair contrasts prettily with the gold in yours. I should imagine that you are temperamental antipodes.\"  \"So we are; but friendship bridges the chasm between.\"  \"How long have you known him?\"  \"We have been chums ever since our sophomore year.\"  \"What attracted you in him?\"  \"It is no simple matter to define exactly one's likes and dislikes. Even a tiny protoplasmic animal appears to be highly complex under the microscope. How can we hope to analyse, with any degree of certitude, our souls, especially when, under the influence of feeling, we see as through a glass darkly.\"  \"It is true that personal feeling colours our spectacles and distorts the perspective. Still, we should not shrink from self-analysis. We must learn to see clearly into our own hearts if we would give vitality to our work. Indiscretion is the better part of literature, and it behooves us to hound down each delicate elusive shadow of emotion, and convert it into copy.\"  \"It is because I am so self-analytical that I realise the complexity of my nature, and am at a loss to define my emotions. Conflicting forces sway us hither and thither without neutralising each other. Physicology isn't physics. There were many things to attract me to Jack. He was subtler, more sympathetic, more feminine, perhaps, than the rest of my college-mates.\"  \"That I have noticed. In fact, his lashes are those of a girl. You still care for him very much?\"  \"It isn't a matter of caring. We are two beings that live one life.\"  \"A sort of psychic Siamese twins?\"  \"Almost. Why, the matter is very simple. Our hearts root in the same soil; the same books have nourished us, the same great winds have shaken our being, and the same sunshine called forth the beautiful blossom of friendship.\"  \"He struck me, if you will pardon my saying so, as a rather commonplace companion.\"  \"There is in him a hidden sweetness, and a depth of feeling which only intimate contact reveals. He is now taking his post-graduate course at Harvard, and for well-nigh two months we have not met; yet so many invisible threads of common experience unite us that we could meet after years and still be near each other.\"  \"You are very young,\" Reginald replied.  \"What do you mean?\"  \"Ah--never mind.\"  \"So you do not believe that two hearts may ever beat as one?\"  \"No, that is an auditory delusion. Not even two clocks beat in unison. There is always a discrepancy, infinitesimal, perhaps, but a discrepancy nevertheless.\"  A sharp ring of the bell interrupted the conversation. A moment later a curly head peeped through the door.  \"Hello, Ernest! How are you, old man?\" the intruder cried, with a laugh in his voice. Then, noticing Clarke, he shook hands with the great man unceremoniously, with the nonchalance of the healthy young animal bred in the atmosphere of an American college.  His touch seemed to thrill Clarke, who breathed heavily and then stepped to the window, as if to conceal the flush of vitality on his cheek.  It was a breath of springtide that Jack had brought with him. Youth is a Prince Charming. To shrivelled veins the pressure of his hand imparts a spark of animation, and middle age unfolds its petals in his presence, as a sunflower gazing at late noon once more upon its lord.  \"I have come to take Ernest away from you,\" said Jack. \"He looks a trifle paler than usual, and a day's outing will stir the red corpuscles in his blood.\"  \"I have no doubt that you will take very good care of him,\" Reginald replied.  \"Where shall we go?\" Ernest asked, absent-mindedly.  But he did not hear the answer, for Reginald's scepticisms had more deeply impressed him than he cared to confess to himself.     VII   The two boys had bathed their souls in the sea-breeze, and their eyes in light.  The tide of pleasure-loving humanity jostling against them had carried their feet to the \"Lion Palace.\" From there, seated at table and quenching their thirst with high-balls, they watched the feverish palpitations of the city's life-blood pulsating in the veins of Coney Island, to which they had drifted from Brighton Beach.  Ernest blew thoughtful rings of smoke into the air.  \"Do you notice the ferocious look in the mien of the average frequenter of this island resort?\" he said to Jack, whose eyes, following the impulse of his more robust youth, were examining specimens of feminine flotsam on the waves of the crowd.  \"It is,\" he continued, speaking to himself for want of an"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17144"],["title","The House of the Vampire (#3)"],["body","udience, \"the American who is in for having a 'good time.' And he is going to get it. Like a huntsman, he follows the scent of happiness; but I warrant that always it eludes him. Perhaps his mad race is only the epitome of humanity's vain pursuit of pleasure, the eternal cry that is never answered.\"  But Jack was not listening. There are times in the life of every man when a petticoat is more attractive to him than all the philosophy of the world.  Ernest was a little hurt, and it was not without some silent remonstrance that he acquiesced when Jack invited to their table two creatures that once were women.  \"Why?\"  \"But they are interesting.\"  \"I cannot find so.\"  They both had seen better times--of course. Then money losses came, with work in shop or factory, and the voice of the tempter in the commercial wilderness.  One, a frail nervous little creature, who had instinctively chosen a seat at Ernest's side, kept prattling in his ear, ready to tell the story of her life to any one who was willing to treat her to a drink. Something in her demeanour interested him.  \"And then I had a stroke of luck. The manager of a vaudeville was my friend and decided to give me a trial. He thought I had a voice. They called me Betsy, the Hyacinth Girl. At first it seemed as if people liked to hear me. But I suppose that was because I was new. After a month or two they discharged me.\"  \"And why?\"  \"I suppose I was just used up, that's all.\"  \"Frightful!\"  \"I never had much of a voice--and the tobacco smoke--and the wine--I love wine.\"  She gulped down her glass.  \"And do you like your present occupation?\"  \"Why not? Am I not young? Am I not pretty?\"  This she said not parrotwise, but with a simple coquettishness that was all her own.  On the way to the steamer a few moments later, Ernest asked, half-reproachfully: \"Jack--and you really enjoyed this conversation?\"  \"Didn't you?\"  \"Do you mean this?\"  \"Why, yes; she was--very agreeable.\"  Ernest frowned.  \"We're twenty, Ernest. And then, you see, it's like a course in sociology. Susie--\"  \"Susie, was that her name?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"So she had a name?\"  \"Of course.\"  \"She shouldn't. It should be a number.\"  \"They may not be pillars of society; still, they're human.\"  \"Yes,\" said Ernest, \"that is the most horrible part of it.\"     VIII   The moon was shining brightly.  Swift and sure the prow of the night-boat parted the silvery foam.  The smell of young flesh. Peals of laughter. A breathless pianola. The tripping of dancing-feet. Voices husked with drink and voices soft with love. The shrill accents of vulgarity. Hustling waiters. Shop-girls. Bourgeois couples. Tired families of four and upward. Sleeping children. A boy selling candy. The crying of babies.  The two friends were sitting on the upper deck, muffled in their long rain-coats.  In the distance the Empire City rose radiant from the mist.  \"Say, Ernest, you should spout some poetry as of old. Are your lips stricken mute, or are you still thinking of Coney Island?\"  \"Oh, no, the swift wind has taken it away. I am clean, I am pure. Life has passed me. It has kissed me, but it has left no trace.\"  He looked upon the face of his friend. Their hands met. They felt, with keen enjoyment, the beauty of the night, of their friendship, and of the city beyond.  Then Ernest's lips moved softly, musically, twitching with a strange ascetic passion that trembled in his voice as he began:    _\"Huge steel-ribbed monsters rise into the air      Her Babylonian towers, while on high,      Like gilt-scaled serpents, glide the swift trains by,    Or, underfoot, creep to their secret lair.    A thousand lights are jewels in her hair,      The sea her girdle, and her crown the sky;      Her life-blood throbs, the fevered pulses fly.    Immense, defiant, breathless she stands there.     \"And ever listens in the ceaseless din,      Waiting for him, her lover, who shall come,        Whose singing lips shall boldly claim their own,      And render sonant what in her was dumb,    The splendour, and the madness, and the sin,        Her dreams in iron and her thoughts of stone.\"_  He paused. The boat glided on. For a long time neither spoke a word.  After a while Jack broke the silence: \"And are you dreaming of becoming the lyric mouth of the city, of giving utterance to all its yearnings, its 'dreams in iron and its thoughts of stone'?\"  \"No,\" replied Ernest, simply, \"not yet. It is strange to what impressions the brain will respond. In Clarke's house, in the midst of inspiring things, inspiration failed me. But while I was with that girl an idea came to me--an idea, big, real.\"  \"Will it deal with her?\"  Ernest smiled: \"Oh, no. She personally has nothing to do with it. At least not directly. It was the commotion of blood and--brain. The air--the change. I don't know what.\"  \"What will it be?\" asked Jack, with interest all alert.  \"A play, a wonderful play. And its heroine will be a princess, a little princess, with a yellow veil.\"  \"What of the plot?\"  \"That I shall not tell you to-day. In fact, I shall not breathe a word to any one. It will take you all by surprise--and the public by storm.\"  \"So it will be playable?\"  \"If I am not very much mistaken, you will see it on Broadway within a year. And,\" he added graciously, \"I will let you have two box-seats for the first night.\"  They both chuckled at the thought, and their hearts leaped within them.  \"I hope you will finish it soon,\" Jack observed after a while. \"You haven't done much of late.\"  \"A similar reflection was on my mind when you came yesterday. That accounts for the low spirits in which you found me.\"  \"Ah, indeed,\" Jack replied, measuring Ernest with a look of wonder. \"But now your face is aglow. It seems that the blood rushes to your head swifter at the call of an idea than at the kiss of a girl.\"  \"Thank God!\" Ernest remarked with a sigh of relief. \"Mighty forces within me are fashioning the limpid thought. Passion may grip us by the throat momentarily; upon our backs we may feel the lashes of desire and bathe our souls in flames of many hues; but the joy of activity is the ultimate passion.\"     IX   It seemed, indeed, as if work was to Ernest what the sting of pleasure is to the average human animal. The inter-play of his mental forces gave him the sensuous satisfaction of a woman's embrace. His eyes sparkled. His muscle tightened. The joy of creation was upon him.  Often very material reasons, like stone weights tied to the wings of a bird, stayed the flight of his imagination. Magazines were waiting for his copy, and he was not in the position to let them wait. They supplied his bread and butter.  Between the bread and butter, however, the play was growing scene by scene. In the lone hours of the night he spun upon the loom of his fancy a brilliant weft of swift desire--heavy, perfumed, Oriental--interwoven with bits of gruesome tenderness. The thread of his own life intertwined with the thread of the story. All genuine art is autobiography. It is not, however, necessarily a revelation of the artist's actual self, but of a myriad of potential selves. Ah, our own potential selves! They are sometimes beautiful, often horrible, and always fascinating. They loom to heavens none too high for our reach; they stray to yawning hells beneath our very feet.  The man who encompasses heaven and hell is a perfect man. But there are many heavens and more hells. The artist snatches fire from both. Surely the assassin feels no more intensely the lust of murder than the poet who depicts it in glowing words. The things he writes are as real to him as the things that he lives. But in his realm the poet is supreme. His hands may be red with blood or white with leprosy: he still remains king. Woe to him, however, if he transcends the limits of his kingdom and translates into action the secret of his dreams. The throng that before applauded him will stone his quivering body or nail to the cross his delicate hands and feet.  Sometimes days passed before Ernest could concentrate his mind upon his play. Then the fever seized him again, and he strung pearl on pearl, line on line, without entrusting a word to paper. Even to discuss his work before it had received the final brush-strokes would have seemed indecent to him.  Reginald, too, seemed to be in a turmoil of work. Ernest had little chance to speak to him. And to drop even a hint of his plans between the courses at breakfast would have been desecration.  Sunset followed sunset, night followed night. The stripling April had made room for the lady May. The play was almost completed in Ernest's mind, and he thought, with a little shudder, of the physical travail of the actual writing. He felt that the transcript from brain to paper would demand all his powers. For, of late, his thoughts seemed strangely evanescent; they seemed to run away from him whenever he attempted to seize them.  The day was glad with sunshine, and he decided to take a long walk in the solitude of the Palisades, to steady hand and nerve for the final task.  He told Reginald of his intention, but met with little response. Reginald's face was wan and bore the peculiar pallor of one who had worked late at night.  \"You must be frightfully busy?\" Ernest asked, with genuine concern.  \"So I am,\" Reginald replied. \"I always work in a white heat. I am restless, nervous, feverish, and can find no peace until I have given utterance to all that clamours after birth.\"  \"What is it that is so engaging your mind, the epic of the French Revolution?\"  \"Oh, no. I should never have undertaken that. I haven't done a stroke of work on it for several weeks. In fact, ever since Walkham called, I simply couldn't. It seemed as if a rough hand had in some way destroyed the web of my thought. Poetry in the writing is like red hot glass before the master-blower has fashioned it into birds and trees and strange fantastic shapes. A draught, caused by the opening of a door may distort it. But at present I am engaged"]]]
