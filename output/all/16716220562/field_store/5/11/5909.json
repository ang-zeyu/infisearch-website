He had scarcely left the capital when the news of an untoward event effaced the good impression he had made. The descendants of the colonists, planted in bygone times by Shalmaneser I. on the western slope of the Masios, in the district of Khalzidipkha, had thrown off their allegiance, and their leader, Khulaî, was besieging the royal fortress of Damdamusa.* Assur-nazir-pal marched direct to the sources of the Tigris, and the mere fact of his presence sufficed to prevent any rising in that quarter. He took advantage of the occasion to set up a stele beside those of his father Tukulti-ninip and his ancestor Tiglath-pileser, and then having halted to receive the tribute of Izalla,** he turned southwards, and took up a position on the slopes of the Kashiari.       * The position of Khalzidipkha or Khalzilukha, as well as      that of Kina-bu, its stronghold, is shown approximately by      what follows. Assur-nazir-pal, marching from the sources of      the Supnat towards Tela, could pass either to the east or      west of the Karajah-dagh; as the end of the campaign finds      him at Tushkhân, to the south of the Tigris, and he returns      to Naîri and Kirkhi by the eastern side of the Karajah-dagh,      we are led to conclude that the outgoing march to Tela was      by the western side, through the country situated between      the Karajah-dagh and the Euphrates. On referring to a modern      map, two rather important places will be found in this      locality: the first, Arghana, commanding the road from      Diarbekîr to Khar-put; the other, Severek, on the route from      Diarbekîr to Orfah. Arghana appears to me to correspond to      the royal city of Damdamusa, which would, thus have      protected the approach to the plain on the north-west.      Severek corresponds fairly well to the position which,      according to the Assyrian text, Kinabu must have occupied;      hence the country of Khalzidipkha (Khalzilukha) must be the      district of Severek.       ** Izalla, written also Izala, Azala, paid its tribute in      sheep and oxen, and also produced a wine for which it      continued to be celebrated down to the time of      Nebuchadrezzar II. Lenormant and Finzi place this country-      near to Nisibis, where the Byzantine and Syrian writers      mention a district and a mountain of the same name, and this      conjecture is borne out by the passages of the _Annals of      Assur-nazir-pal_ which place it in the vicinity of Bît-Adini      and Bît-Bakhiâni. It has also been adopted by most of the      historians who have recently studied the question.  At the first news of his approach, Khulai had raised the blockade of Damdamusa and had entrenched himself in Kinabu; the Assyrians, however, carried the place by storm, and six hundred soldiers of the garrison were killed in the attack. The survivors, to the number of three thousand, together with many women and children, were, thrown into the flames. The people of Mariru hastened to the rescue;* the Assyrians took three hundred of them, prisoners and burnt them alive; fifty others were ripped up, but the victors did not stop to reduce their town. The district of Nirbu was next subjected to systematic ravaging, and half of its inhabitants fled into the Mesopotamian desert, while the remainder sought refuge in Tela at the foot of the Ukhira.**       * The site of Mariru is unknown; according to the text of      the Annals, it ought to lie near Severek (Kinabu) to the      south-east, since after having mentioned it, Assur-nazir-pal      speaks of the people of Nirbu whom he engaged in the desert      before marching against Tela.       ** Tila or Tela is the Tela Antoninopolis of the writers of      the Roman period and the present Veranshehr. The district of      Nirbu, of which it was the capital, lay on the southern      slope of the Karajah-dagh at the foot of Mount Urkhira, the      central group of the range. The name Kashiari is applied to      the whole mountain group which separates the basins of the      Tigris and Euphrates to the south and south-west.  The latter place was a strong one, being surrounded by three enclosing walls, and it offered an obstinate resistance. Notwithstanding this, it at length fell, after having lost three thousand of its defenders:--some of its garrison were condemned to the stake, some had their hands, noses, or ears cut off, others were deprived of sight, flayed alive, or impaled amid the smoking ruins. This being deemed insufficient punishment, the conqueror degraded the place from its rank of chief town, transferring this, together with its other privileges, to a neighbouring city, Tushkhân, which had belonged to the Assyrians from the beginning of their conquests.* The king enlarged the place, added to it a strong enclosing wall, and installed within it the survivors of the older colonists who had been dispersed by the war, the majority of whom had taken refuge in Shupria.**       * From this passage we learn that Tushkhân, also called      Tushkha, was situated on the border of Nirbu, while from      another passage in the campaign of the Vth year we find that      it was on the right bank of the Tigris. Following H.      Rawlinson, I place it at Kurkh, near the Tigris, to the east      of Diarbekîr. The existence in that locality of an      inscription of Assur-nazir-pal appears to prove the      correctness of this identification; we are aware, in fact,      of the particular favour in which this prince held Tushkhân,      for he speaks with pride of the buildings with which he      embellished it. Hommel, however, identifies Kurkh with the      town of Matiâtô, of which mention is made further on.       ** Shupria or Shupri, a name which has been read Ruri, had      been brought into submission from the time of Shalmaneser I.      We gather from the passages in which it is mentioned that it      was a hilly country, producing wine, rich in flocks, and      lying at a short distance from Tushkhân; perhaps Mariru,      mentioned on p. 28, was one of its towns. I think we may      safely place it on the north-western slopes of the Kashiari,      in the modern caza of Tchernik, which possesses several      vineyards held in high estimation. Knudtzon, to whom we are      indebted for the reading of this name, places the country      rather further north, within the fork formed by the two      upper branches of the Tigris.  He constructed a palace there, built storehouses for the reception of the grain of the province; and, in short, transformed the town into a stronghold of the first order, capable of serving as a base of operations for his armies. The surrounding princes, in the meanwhile, rallied round him, including Ammibaal of Bît-Zamani, and the rulers of Shupria, Naîri, and Urumi;* the chiefs of Eastern Nirbu alone held aloof, emboldened by the rugged nature of their mountains and the density of their forests. Assur-nazir-pal attacked them on his return journey, dislodged them from the fortress of Ishpilibria where they were entrenched, gained the pass of Buliani, and emerged into the valley of Luqia.**       * The position of Bît-Zamani on the banks of the Euphrates      was determined by Delattre. Urumi was situated on the right      bank of the same river in the neighbourhood of Sumeisat, and      the name has survived in that of Urima, a town in the      vicinity so called even as late as Roman times. Nirdun, with      Madara as its capital, occupied part of the eastern slopes      of the Kashiari towards Ortaveran.       ** Hommel identifies the Luqia with the northern affluent of      the Euphrates called on the ancient monuments Lykos, and he      places the scene of the war in Armenia. The context obliges      us to look for this river to the south of the Tigris, to the      north-east and to the east of the Kashiari. The king coming      from Nirbu, the pass of Buliani, in which he finds the towns      of Kirkhi, must be the valley of Khaneki, in which the road      winds from Mardin to Diarbekir, and the Luqia is probably      the most important stream in this region, the Sheikhân-Su,      which waters Savur, chief town of the caza of Avinch. Ardupa      must have been situated near, or on the actual site of, the      present Mardîn, whose Assyrian name is unknown to us; it was      at all events a military station on the road to Nineveh,      along which the king returned victorious with the spoil.  At Ardupa a brief halt was made to receive the ambassadors of one of the Hittite sovereigns and others from the kings of Khanigalbat, after which he returned to Nineveh, where he spent the winter. As a matter of fact, these were but petty wars, and their immediate results appear at the first glance quite inadequate to account for the contemporary enthusiasm they excited. The sincerity of it can be better understood when we consider the miserable state of the country twenty years previously. Assyria then comprised two territories, one in the plains of the middle, the other in the districts of the upper, Tigris, both of considerable extent, but almost without regular intercommunication. Caravans or isolated messengers might pass with tolerable safety from Assur and Nineveh to Singar, or even to Nisibis; but beyond these places they had to brave the narrow defiles and steep paths in the forests of the Masios, through which it was rash to venture without keeping eye and ear ever on the alert. The mountaineers and their chiefs recognized the nominal suzerainty of Assyria, but refused to act upon this recognition unless constrained by a strong hand; if this control were relaxed they levied contributions on, or massacred, all who came within their reach, and the king himself never travelled from his own city of Nineveh to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17327"],["title","History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 7 (of 12) (#5)"],["body"," own town of Amidi unless accompanied by an army. In less than the short space of three years, Assur-nazir-pal had remedied this evil. By the slaughter of some two hundred men in one place, three hundred in another, two or three thousand in a third, by dint of impaling and flaying refractory sheikhs, burning villages and dismantling strongholds, he forced the marauders of Naîri and Kirkhi to respect his frontiers and desist from pillaging his country. The two divisions of his kingdom, strengthened by the military colonies in Nirbu, were united, and became welded together into a compact whole from the banks of the Lower Zab to the sources of the Khabur and the Supnat.  During the following season the course of events diverted the kings efforts into quite an opposite direction (B.C. 882). Under the name of Zamua there existed a number of small states scattered along the western slope of the Iranian Plateau north of the Cossæans.* Many of them--as, for instance, the Lullumê--had been civilized by the Chaldæans almost from time immemorial; the most southern among them were perpetually oscillating between the respective areas of influence of Babylon and Nineveh, according as one or other of these cities was in the ascendant, but at this particular moment they acknowledged Assyrian sway. Were they excited to rebellion against the latter power by the emissaries of its rival, or did they merely think that Assur-nazir-pal was too fully absorbed in the affairs of Naîri to be able to carry his arms effectively elsewhere? At all events they coalesced under Nurrammân, the sheikh of Dagara, blocked the pass of Babiti which led to their own territory, and there massed their contingents behind the shelter of hastily erected ramparts.**       * According to Hommol and Tiele, Zamua would be the country      extending from the sources of the Radanu to the southern      shores of the lake of Urumiah; Schrader believes it to have      occupied a smaller area, and places it to the east and      south-west of the lesser Zab. Delattre has shown that a      distinction must be made between Zamua on Lake Van and the      well-known Zamua upon the Zab. Zamua, as described by Assur-      nazir-pal, answers approximately to the present sandjak of      Suleimaniyeh in the vilayet of Mossul.       ** Hommol believes that Assur-nazir-pal crossed the Zab near      Altin-keupru, and he is certainly correct: but it appears to      me from a passage in the _Annals_, that instead of taking      the road which leads to Bagdad by Ker-kuk and Tuz-Khurmati,      he marched along that which leads eastwards in the direction      of Suleimaniyeh. The pass of Babiti must have lain between      Gawardis and Bibân, facing the Kissê tchai, which forms the      western branch of the Radanu. Dagara would thus be      represented by the district to the east of Kerkuk at the      foot of the Kara-dagh.  Assur-nazir-pal concentrated his army at Kakzi,* a little to the south of Arbela, and promptly marched against them; he swept all obstacles before him, killed fourteen hundred and sixty men at the first onslaught, put Dagara to fire and sword, and soon defeated Nurrammân, but without effecting his capture.       * Kakzi, sometimes read Kalzi, must have been situated at      Shemamek of Shamamik, near Hazeh, to the south-west of      Erbil, the ancient Arbela, at the spot where Jones noticed      important Assyrian ruins excavated by Layard.  As the campaign threatened to be prolonged, he formed an entrenched camp in a favourable position, and stationed in it some of his troops to guard the booty, while he dispersed the rest to pillage the country on all sides.  [Illustration: 033.jpg THE CAMPAIGNS OF ASSUR-NAZIR-PAL IN ZAMUA]  One expedition led him to the mountain group of Nizir, at the end of the chain known to the people of Lullumê as the Kinipa.* He there reduced to ruins seven towns whose inhabitants had barricaded themselves in urgent haste, collected the few herds of cattle he could find, and driving them back to the camp, set out afresh towards a part of Nizir as yet unsubdued by any conqueror. The stronghold of Larbusa fell before the battering-ram, to be followed shortly by the capture of Bara. Thereupon the chiefs of Zamua, convinced of their helplessness, purchased the kings departure by presents of horses, gold, silver, and corn.** Nurrammân alone remained impregnable in his retreat at Nishpi, and an attempt to oust him resulted solely in the surrender of the fortress of Birutu.*** The campaign, far from having been decisive, had to be continued during the winter in another direction where revolts had taken place,--in Khudun, in Kissirtu, and in the fief of Arashtua,**** all three of which extended over the upper valleys of the lesser Zab, the Radanu, the Turnat, and their affluents.       * Mount Kinipa is a part of Nizir, the Khalkhalân-dagh, if      we may-judge from the direction of the Assyrian campaign.       ** None of these places can be identified with certainty.      The gist of the account leads us to gather that Bara was      situated to the east of Dagara, and formed its frontier; we      shall not be far wrong in looking for all these districts in      the fastnesses of the Kara-dagh, in the caza of      Suleimaniyeh. Mount Nishpi is perhaps the Segirmc-dagh of      the present day.       *** The Assyrian compiler appears to have made use of two      slightly differing accounts of this campaign; he has twice      repeated the same facts without noticing his mistake.       **** The fief of Arashtua, situated beyond the Turnat, is      probably the district of Suleimaniyeh; it is, indeed, at      this place only that the upper course of the Turnat is      sufficiently near to that of the Radanu to make the marches      of Assur-nazir-pal in the direction indicated by the      Assyrian scribe possible. According to the account of the      _Annals_, it seems to me that we must seek for Khudun and      Kissirtu to the south of the fief of Arashtua, in the modern      cazas of Gulanbar or Shehrizôr.  The king once more set out from Kakzi, crossed the Zab and the Eadanu, through the gorges of Babiti, and halting on the ridges of Mount Simaki, peremptorily demanded tribute from Dagara.* This was, however, merely a ruse to deceive the enemy, for taking one evening the lightest of his chariots and the best of his horsemen, he galloped all night without drawing rein, crossed the Turnat at dawn, and pushing straight forward, arrived in the afternoon of the same day before the walls of Ammali, in the very heart of the fief of Arashtua.** The town vainly attempted a defence; the whole population was reduced to slavery or dispersed in the forests, the ramparts were demolished, and the houses reduced to ashes. Khudun with twenty, and Kissirtu with ten of its villages, Bara, Kirtiara, Dur-Lullumê, and Bunisa, offered no further resistance, and the invading host halted within sight of the defiles of Khashmar.***       * The _Annals of Assur-nazir-pal_ go on to mention that      Mount Simaki extended as far as the Turnat, and that it was      close to Mount Azira. This passage, when compared with that      in which the opening of the campaign is described, obliges      us to recognise in Mounts Simaki and Azira two parts of the      Shehrizôr chain, parallel to the Seguirmé-dagh. The fortress      of Mizu, mentioned in the first of these two texts, may      perhaps be the present Gurân-kaleh.       ** Hommel thinks that Ammali is perhaps the present      Suleimaniyeh; it is, at all events, on this side that we      must look for its site.       *** I do not know whether we may trace the name of the      ancient Mount Khashmar-Khashmir in the present Azmir-dagh;      it is at its feet, probably in the valley of Suleimanabad,      that we ought to place the passes of Khashmar.  One kinglet, however, Amika of Zamru, showed no intention of capitulating. Entrenched behind a screen of forests and frowning mountain ridges, he fearlessly awaited the attack. The only access to the remote villages over which he ruled, was by a few rough roads hemmed in between steep cliffs and beds of torrents; difficult and dangerous at ordinary times, they were blocked in war by temporary barricades, and dominated at every turn by some fortress perched at a dizzy height above them. After his return to the camp, where his soldiers were allowed a short respite, Assur-nazir-pal set out against Zamru, though he was careful not to approach it directly and attack it at its most formidable points. Between two peaks of the Lara and Bidirgi ranges he discovered a path which had been deemed impracticable for horses, or even for heavily armed men. By this route, the king, unsuspected by the enemy, made his way through the mountains, and descended so unexpectedly upon Zamru, that Amika had barely time to make his escape, abandoning everything in his alarm--palace, treasures, harem, and even his chariot.* A body of Assyrians pursued him hotly beyond the fords of the Lallu, chasing him as far as Mount Itini; then, retracing their steps to headquarters, they at once set out on a fresh track, crossed the Idir, and proceeded to lay waste the plains of Ilaniu and Suâni.**       * This raid, which started from the same point as the      preceding one, ran eastwards in an opposite direction and      ended at Mount Itini. Leaving the fief of Arashtua in the      neighbourhood of Suleimaniyeh, Assur-nazir-pal crossed the      chain of the Azmir-dagh near Pir-Omar and Gudrun, where we      must place Mounts Lara and Bidirgi, and emerged upon Zamru;      the only-places which appear to correspond to Zamru in that      region are Kandishin and Suleimanabad. Hence the Lallu is      the river which runs by Kandishin and Suleimanabad, and      Itini the mountain which separates this river from the      Tchami-Kizildjik.       ** I think we may recognise the ancient name of Ilaniu in      that of Alan,"]]]
