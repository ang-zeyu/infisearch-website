With some few and comparatively unimportant exceptions, the map of England remains to-day in this respect what those races made it more than a thousand years ago.  8. Climate.  With regard to the climate of England,--its insular form, geographical position, and its exposure to the warm currents of the Gulf Stream give it a temperature generally free from great extremes of heat or cold.  On this account, it is favorable to the full and healthy development of both animal and vegetable life.  Nowhere is greater vigor or longevity found.  Charles II said that he was convinced that there was not a country in the world so far as he knew, where one could spend so much time out of doors comfortably as in England.  9. Industrial Division of England.  From an industrial and historical point of view, the country falls into two divisions.  Let a line be drawn from Hull, on the northeast coast, to Leicester, in the Midlands, and thence to Exmouth, on the southwest coast.  (See map on p. 10.)  On the upper or northwest side of that line will lie the coal and iron which constitute the greater part of the mineral wealth and form the basis of the manufacturing industry of England; here too are all the largest towns except London.  On the lower or southeast side of the line there will be a comparatively level surface of rich agricultural land, and most of the fine old cathedral cities with their historic associations; in a world, the England of the past as contrasted with modern and democratic England, that part which has grown up since the introduction of steam.  10. Eastern and Western Britain compared.  As the southern and eastern coasts of Britain were in most direct communication with the Continent, and were first settled, they continued until modern times to be the wealthiest, most civilized, and progressive part of the island.  Much of the western portion is a rough, wild country.  To it the East Britons retreated, keeping their primitive customs and language, as in Wales and Cornwall.  In all the great movements of religious or political reform, up to the middle of the seventeenth century, we find that the people of the eastern half of the island were usually on the side of a larger measure of liberty; while those of the western half were generally in favor of increasing the power of the King and the Church.  11. Influence of the Island Form on the Roman Invasion  Geologists tell us that Great Britain was once connected with the mainland of western Europe.  It was fortunate for Britain that this connection was severed and that it became an island.  We see an illustration of this advantage in the case of the Roman invasion.  It was easy for the Romans to march great armies into Gaul and take complete possession of that country, but it was with no little difficulty that they sent fleets across the tempestuous waters of the Channel.  This may have been one reason why they never succeeded in permanently establishing their language and their laws in the island of Britain.  It is true that they conquered and held it for several centuries, but they never destroyed its individuality,--they never Latinized it as they did France and Spain.  12. Influence of the Island Form on the Saxon Invasion.  In like manner, when the northern tribes of Europe overran the Roman Empire, they found themselves, in some measure, shut out from Britain by its wall of sea.  The Jutes, Saxons, and Angles could not enter it in countless hordes, but only in small numbers and by occasional attacks.  Because of this, the invaders could only drive back the Britons by slow degrees, and they never entirely crushed them.  Again, the conquerers could not build up a strong, united kinigdom, but they had to content themselves with establishing a number of petty kingdoms which were constantly at war with each other.  Later, the whole of England became subject to a sing sovereign.  But the chief men of the separate kingdoms, which had now become simply shires or counties, retained a certain degree of control over the government. This prevented the royal power from becoming the unchecked will of an arbitrary ruler.  Finally, it may be said that the isolation of England had much to do with the development of the strong individual character of its people.  13. Influence of the Island Form on the Danes and Normans.  In the course of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries the Danes invaded England, but the sea prevented their coming all at once and with overwhelming force.  They got possession of the throne (S63) and permanently established themselves in the northern half of the country.  The English, however, held their own so well that the Danes were eventually compelled to unite with them.  Even when the Normans invaded England and conquered it (SS74, 107), they felt obliged to make many concessions to both the English and the Danes.  The result was that every invasion of the island ended in a compromise, so that no one race ever got complete predominance.  In time all the elements mingled and became one people.  14. Influence of the Channel in Later History.  Furthermore, the immense protective value of the Channel to England may be traced down to our own day.  In the great crisis when Simon de Montfort was fighting (1264) to secure parliamentary representation for the people (S213), King Henry III sought help from France.  The French monarcy got a fleet ready to send to England, but bad weather held it back, and Henry was obliged to concede De Montfort's demands for reform.[1]  [1] W. Stubb's \"Select Charters,\" p. 401  Again, when the Spanish Armada swooped down upn England (1588) a terrible tempest dispersed a part of the enemy's fleet.  Many of the vessels were wrecked (S399) and only a few were left to creep back, crippled and disheartened, to the ports of Spain.  When Queen Elizabeth publicly thanked the leaders of her valiant navy for what they had done to repel the Spanish forces, she also acknowledged how much England owed to the protective power of wind and wave.  The same elements taught Napoleon a lesson which he never forgot.  He had carefully planned an expedition against England (S557), but violent and long-continued storms compelled him to abandon the hazardous undertaking (1804).  The great French commander felt himself invincible on land, but he was obliged to confess that \"a few leagues of salt water\" had completely out-generaled him.  In fact, ever since England organized a regular navy (1512) the encircling arms of the ocean have been her closest and surest friend. They have exempted her from keeping up a large standing army and so preserved her from the danger of military despotism at home.  They too have made her the greatest sea power,[1] and, at the same time, the greatest colonizing power[2] the world has yet seen.  They have also made her the greatest commercial power on the globe.[3]  [1] The English navy far outranks that of any other nation in the number of its warships. [2] The English colonial possessions and \"spheres of influence\" cover an area of more than 11,400,000 square miles.  (See map between pp. 422, 423.) [3] The total commerce of the United Kingdom in 1910 was nearly 912,000,000 pounds and that of the British Empire exceeded 1,990,680,000 pounds.  It is true that the use of steam for vessels of war has diminished the natural protective service of the Channel, since a hostile fleet can now move against England in almost any weather.  Still, the \"silver streak,\" as the English call that waterway, will always remain, in some degree, a defense against sudden invasion, except, of course, from a squadron of military airships.  15. England as a Commercial Center.  In closing this period, the position of England, with respect to facilities for commerce, deserves particular attention.  In the first place the country has many excellent harbors; next, it is situated in the ocean which is the great highway between the two continents having the highest civilization and the most constant intercourse.  Finally, a glance at the maps on pages 185 and 420 will show that geographically England is located at about the center of the land masses of the globe.  It is evident that a large island so placed stands in the favorable position for easy and rapid trade communications with every quarter of the world.  For this reason England has been able to attain, and thus far to maintain, the highest rank among maritime and commercial powers.  It is true that since the opening of the Suez Canal (1869) the trade with the Indies, China, and Japan has considerably changed. Many cargoes of teas, silks, spices, and other Eastern products, which formerly went to London, Liverpool, or Southampton, to be reshipped to different countries of Europe, now pass by other routes direct to the consumer.  Furthermore, it is a question what effect the completion of the Panama Canal will have on English trade in parts of the Pacific. But for the present England retains her supremacy as the great carrier and distributor of the productions of the earth,--a fact which has had a very decided influence on her history, and on her relations with other nations, both in peace and war.

A CIVILIZATION WHICH DID NOT CIVILIZE  16. Europe shortly before Caesar's Invasion of Britain.  Before considering the Roman invasion of Britain let us take a glance at the condition of Europe.  We have seen that the tribes (S2) of Britain, like those of Gaul (France), were not mere savages.  On the contrary, we know that they had taken more than one important step in the path of progress; still the advance should not be overrated, for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17386"],["title","The Leading Facts of English History (#3)"],["body","of the shores of the Mediterranean there was no real civilization.  [1] Reference Books on this Period will be found in the Classified List of Books in the Appendix.  The pronunciation of names will be found in the Index.  The Leading Dates stand unenclosed; all others are in parentheses.  17. Caesar's Campaigns.  Such was the state of Europe when Julius Caesar, who was governor of Gaul, but who aspired to be ruler of the world, set out on his first campaign against the tribes north of the Alps (58 B.C.).  In undertaking the war he had three objects in view: First, he wished to crush the power of those restless hordes that threatened the safety of the Roman Republic.  Next, he sought military fame in the hope that it would make him supreme ruler of that Republic.  Lastly, he wanted money to maintain his army and to bribe the party leaders of Rome to help him carry out his political plans.  To this end he compelled every tribe which he conquered to pay him tribute in cash or slaves.  18. Caesar reaches Boulogne and crosses over to Britain, 55 B.C.  In three years Caesar had subjugated the enemy in a succession of victories, and a great part of Europe lay helpless at his feet.  Late in the summer of 55 B.C. he reached Boulogne on the coast of Gaul. Standing there, he could see the gleaming chalk cliffs of Britain, so vividly described in Shakespeare's \"King Lear.\"[1]  [1] Shakespeare's \"King Lear,\" Act IV, scene vi.  While encamped on the shore he \"resolved,\" he says, \"to pass over into Britain, having had trustworthy information that in all his wars with the Gauls the enemies of the Roman commonwealth had constantly received help from thence.\"[2]  [2] Caesar's \"Gallic War,\" Book IV.  Embarking with a force of between eight and ten thousand men[3] in eighty small vessels, Caesar crossed the Channel and landed not far from Dover, where he overcame the Britons (S2), who made a desperate resistance.  After a stay of a few weeks, during which he did not leave the coast, he returned to Gaul.  [3] Caesar probably sailed about the 25th of August, 55 B.C.  His force consisted of two legions, the 7th and 10th.  A legion varied at different times from 3000 foot and 200 horse soldiers to 6000 foot and 400 horse.  19. Caesar's Second Invasion of Britain.  The next year (54 B.C.), a little earlier in the season, Caesar made a second invasion with a much larger force, and penetrated the country a short distance north of the Thames.  Before the September gales set in, he reembarked for the Continent, never to return.  The total results of his two expeditions were a number of natives carried as hostages to Rome, a long train of captives destined to be sold in the slave markets, and some promises of tribute which the Britons never fulfilled.  Tacitus, the Roman historian, says Caesar \"did not conquer Britain; he only showed it to the Romans.\"  20. The Third Invasion of Britain by the Romans, 43 A.D.  For nearly a hundred years the Romans made no further attempt on Britain, but in 43 A.D. the Emperor Claudius invaded the island. After nine years' fighting, he overcame Caractacus, the leader of the Britons, and carried him in chains to Rome.  The brave chief refused to beg for life or liberty.  \"Can it be possible,\" said he, as he was led through the streets, \"that men who live in such places as these envy us our wretched hovels!\" \"It was the dignity of the man, even in ruins,\" says the Roman historian, \"which saved him.\"  The Emperor, struck with his bearing and his speech, ordered him to be set free.  21. The Romans plant a Colony in Britain, Llyn-din.  Meanwhile the armies of the Empire had established a strong colony at Colchester in the southeast of Britain.  (See map facing p. 14.) There they built a temple and set up the statue of the Emperor Claudius, which the soldiers worshiped, both as a protecting god and as the representative of the Roman Empire.  The army had also conquered other places.  One of these was a little native settlement on a bend in the Thames where the river broadened slightly.  It consisted of a few miserable huts and a row of intrenched cattle pens.  It was called in the British tongue Llyn-din or the Fort-on-the-pool.  This name, which was pronounced with difficulty by Roman lips, eventually became known wherever ships sail, trade reaches, or history is read,--London.  22. Expedition against the Druids.  But in order to complete the conquest of the country, the Roman generals resolved to crush the power of the Druids (S3), since these priests exhorted the Britons to refuse to surrender.  The island of Anglesey, off the northwest coast of Wales, was the stronghold to which the Druids had retreated.  (See map facing p. 14.)  As the Roman soldiers approached to attack them, they beheld the priests and women standing on the shore, with uplifted hands, uttering \"dreadful prayers and imprecations.\"  For a moment the Roman troops hesitated; then they rushed upon the Druids, cut them to pieces, and cast their bodies into their own sacred fires.  From this blow Druidism as an organized faith never recovered, though traces of its religious rites still survive in the use of the mistletoe at Christman and in May-day festivals.  23. Revolt of Boadicea (61).  Still the power of the Latin legions was only partly established, for while the Roman general was absent with his troops at Anglesey, a formidable revolt had broken out in the east.  A British chief, in order to secure half of his property to his family at his death, left it to be equally divided between his daughters and the Emperor.  The governor of the district, under the pretext that Boadicea, the widow of the dead chief, had concealed part of the property, seized the whole of it.  Boadicea protested.  To punish her presumption, the Romans stripped and scourged her, and inflicted still more brutal and infamous treatment on her daughters.  Maddened by these outrages, Boadicea appealed to her countrymen for vengeance.  The enraged Britons fell upon London, and other places held by the Romans, burned them to the ground, and slaughtered many thousand inhabitants.  But in the end Roman forced gained the victory, and Boadicea took her own life rather than fall into the hands of her conqueror.  The \"warrior queen\" died, let us trust, as the poet has represented, animated by the prophecy of the Druid priest that,--          \"Rome shall perish--write that word            In the blood that she has spilt;--          Perish, hopeless and abhorred,            Deep in ruin, as in guilt.\"  [1]  [1] Cowper's \"Boadicea.\"  24. Christianity introduced into Britain.  Perhaps it was not long after this that Christianity made its way to Britain; if so, it crept in so silently that nothing certain can be learned of its advent.  The first church, it is said, was built at Glastonbury, in the southeast of the island.  (See map facing p. 38.) It was a long, shedlike structure of wickerwork.  \"Here,\" says an old writer,[1] \"the converts watched, fasted, preached, and prayed, having high meditations under a low roof and large hearts within narrow walls.\"  [1] Thomas Fuller's \"Church History of Britain.\"  At first no notice was taken of the new religion.  It was the faith of the poor and the obscure, and the Roman generals treated it with contempt; but as it continued to spread, it caused alarm.  The Roman Emperor was not only the head of the state, but the head of religion as well.  He represented the power of God on earth: to him every knee must bow (S21).  But the Christians refused this homage. They put Christ first; for that reason they were dagerous to the state, and were looked--[SECTION MISSING]--rebels, or as men likely to become so.  25.

Agricola builds a Line of Forts (7 [END OF LINE MISSING]  When Agricola, a wise and equitable Roman ruler, became governor of Britain he explored the coast, and first discovered Britain to be an island.  He gradually extended the limits of the government, and, in order to prevent invasion from the north, he built a line of forts (completed by Antoninus) across Scotland, from the mouth of the river Forth to the Clyde.  (See map facing p. 14.)  From this date the power of Rome was finally fixed.  During the three hundred years which followed, the surface of the country underwent a change.  The Romans cut down forests, drained marshes, reclaimed waste land, and bridged rivers.  Furthermore they made the soil so productive that Britain became known in Rome as the most important grain-producing and grain-exporting province in the Empire.  27. Roman Cities; London; York.  Where the Britons had once had a humble village enclosed by a ditch and protected by a stockade, the Romans built the cities of Chester, Lincoln, London, York, and other towns, protected by massive walls and towers of stone.  These places have continued to be centers of population ever since.  London early became the Roman commercial metropolis, while the city of York in the north was made the military and civil capital of the country.  (See map facing p. 14).  "]]]
