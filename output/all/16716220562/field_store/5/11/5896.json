His seal is preserved      in the British Museum.       *** The importance of Harran in the development of the      history of the first Chaldæan empire was pointed out by      Winckler; but the theory according to which this town was      the capital of the kingdom, called by the Chaldæan and      Assyrian scribes the kingdom of the world, is justly      combated by Tiele.  These sovereigns were probably at the outset somewhat obscure personages, without much prestige, being sometimes independent and sometimes subject to the rulers of neighbouring states, among others to those of Agadê. In later times, when Babylon had attained to universal power, and it was desired to furnish her kings with a continuous history, the names of these earlier rulers were sought out, and added to those of such foreign princes as had from time to time enjoyed the sovereignty over them--thus forming an interminable list which for materials and authenticity would well compare with that of the Thinite Pharaohs. This list has come down to us incomplete, and its remains do not permit of our determining the exact order of reigns, or the status of the individuals who composed it. We find in it, in the period immediately subsequent to the Deluge, mention of mythical heroes, followed by names which are still semi-legendary, such as Sargon the Elder; the princes of the series were, however, for the most part real beings, whose memories had been preserved by tradition, or whose monuments were still existing in certain localities. Towards the end of the XXVth century before our era, however, a dynasty rose into power of which all the members come within the range of history.*       * This dynasty, which is known to us in its entirety by the      two lists of G. Smith and by Pinches, was legitimately      composed of only eleven kings, and was known as the      Babylonian dynasty, although Sayce suspects it to be of      Arabian origin. It is composed as follows:--  [Illustration: 039.jpg TABLE]  The dates of this dynasty are not fixed with entire certainty. The first of them, Sumuabîm, has left us some contracts bearing the dates of one or other of the fifteen years of his reign, and documents of public or private interest abound in proportion as we follow down the line of his successors. Sumulaîlu, who reigned after him, was only distantly related to his predecessor; but from Sumulaîlu to Sam-shusatana the kingly power was transmitted from father to son without a break for nine generations, if we may credit the testimony of the official lists.*       * Simulaîlu, also written Samu-la-ilu, whom Mr. Pinches has      found in a contract tablet associated with Pungunila as      king, was not the son of Sumuabîm, since the lists do not      mention him as such; he must, however, have been connected      with some sort of relationship, or by marriage, with his      predecessor, since both are placed in the same dynasty. A      few contracts of Sumulaîlu are given by Meissner. Samsuiluna      calls him my forefather (d-gula-mu), the fifth king before      me.       Hommel believes that the order of the dynasties has been      reversed, and that the first upon the lists we possess was      historically the second; he thus places the Babylonian      dynasty between 2035 and 1731 B.C. His opinion has not been      generally adopted, but every Assyriologist dealing with this      period proposes a different date for the reigns in this      dynasty; to take only one characteristic example, Khammurabi      is placed by Oppert in the year 2394-2339, by Delitzsch-      Murdter in 2287-2232, by Winckler in 2264-2210, and by      Peiser in 2139-2084, and by Carl Niebuhr in 2081-2026.   Contemporary records, however, prove that the course of affairs did not always run so smoothly. They betray the existence of at least one usurper--Immêru--who, even if he did not assume the royal titles, enjoyed the supreme power for several years between the reigns of Zabu and Abilsin. The lives of these rulers closely resembled those of their contemporaries of Southern Chaldæa. They dredged the ancient canals, or constructed new ones; they restored the walls of their fortresses, or built fresh strongholds on the frontier;* they religiously kept the festivals of the divinities belonging to their terrestrial domain, to whom they annually rendered solemn homage.       * Sumulaîlu had built six such large strongholds of brick,      which were repaired by Samsuiluna five generations later. A      contract of Sinmuballit is dated the year in which he built      the great wall of a strong place, the name of which is      unfortunately illegible on the fragment which we possess.  They repaired the temples as a matter of course, and enriched them according to their means; we even know that Zabu, the third in order of the line of sovereigns, occupied himself in building the sanctuary Eulbar of Anunit, in Sippara. There is evidence that they possessed the small neighbouring kingdoms of Kishu, Sippara, and Kuta, and that they had consolidated them into a single state, of which Babylon was the capital. To the south their possessions touched upon those of the kings of Uru, but the frontier was constantly shifting, so that at one time an important city such as Nippur belonged to them, while at another it fell under the dominion of the southern provinces. Perpetual war was waged in the narrow borderland which separated the two rival states, resulting apparently in the balance of power being kept tolerably equal between them under the immediate successors of Sumuabîm* --the obscure Sumulaîlu, Zabum, the usurper Immeru, Abîlsin and Sinmuballit--until the reign of Khammurabi (the son of Sinmuballit), who finally made it incline to his side.** The struggle in which he was engaged, and which, after many vicissitudes, he brought to a successful issue, was the more decisive, since he had to contend against a skilful and energetic adversary who had considerable forces at his disposal. Birnsin*** was, in reality, of Elamite race, and as he held the province of Yamutbal in appanage, he was enabled to muster, in addition to his Chaldæan battalions, the army of foreigners who had conquered the maritime regions at the mouth of the Tigris and the Euphrates.       * None of these facts are as yet historically proved: we      may, however, conjecture with some probability what was the      general state of things, when we remember that the first      kings of Babylon were contemporaries of the last independent      sovereigns of Southern Chaldæa.       ** The name of this prince has been read in several ways--      Hammurabi, Khammurabi, by the earlier Assyriologists,      subsequently Hammuragash, Khammuragash, as being of Elamite      or Cossoan extraction: the reading Khammurabi is at present      the prevailing one. The bilingual list published by Pinches      makes Khammurabi an equivalent of the Semitic names Kimta-      rapashtum. Hence Halévy concluded that Khammurabi was a      series of ideograms, and that Kimtarapashtum was the true      reading of the name; his proposal, partially admitted by      Hommel, furnishes us with a mixed reading of Khammurapaltu,      Amraphel. [Hommel is now convinced of the identity of the      Amraphel of _Gen._ xiv. I with Khammurabi.--Te.] Sayce,      moreover, adopts the reading Khammurabi, and assigns to him      an Arabian origin. The part played by this prince was      pointed out at an early date by Menant. Recent discoveries      have shown the important share which he had in developing      the Chaldæan empire, and have, increased his reputation with      Assyriologists.       *** The name of this king has been the theme of heated      discussions: it was at first pronounced Aradsin, Ardusin, or      Zikarsin; it is now read in several different ways--Rimsin,      or Eriaku, Riaku, Rimagu. Others have made a distinction      between the two forms, and have made out of them the names      of two different kings. They are all variants of the same      name. I have adopted the form Rimsin, which is preferred by      a few Assyriologists. [The tablets recently discovered by      Mr. Pinches, referring to Kudur-lagamar and Tudkhula, which      he has published in a Paper road before the Victoria      Institute, Jan. 20, 1896, have shown that the true reading      is Eri-Aku. The Elamite name Eri-Aku, servant of the moon-      god, was changed by some of his subjects into the      Babylonian Rim-Sin, Have mercy, O Moon-god! just as      Abêsukh, the Hebrew Absihua (the father of welfare) was      transformed into the Babylonian Ebisum (the actor).--Ed.]   It was not the first time that Elam had audaciously interfered in the affairs of her neighbours. In fabulous times, one of her mythical kings--Khumbaba the Ferocious--had oppressed. Uruk, and Gilgames with all his valour was barely able to deliver the town. Sargon the Elder is credited with having subdued Elam; the kings and vicegerents of Lagash, as well as those of Uru and. Larsam, had measured forces with Anshan, but with no decisive issue. From time to time they obtained an advantage, and we find recorded in the annals victories gained by Gudea, Inê-sin, or Bursin, but to be followed only by fresh reverses; at the close of such campaigns, and in order to seal the ensuing peace, à princess of Susa would be sent as a bride to one of the Chaldæan cities, or a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17324"],["title","History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 4 (of 12) (#6)"],["body","lady of royal birth would enter the harem of a king of Anshân. Elam was protected along the course of the Tigris and on the shores of the Nâr-Marratum by a wide marshy region, impassable except at a few fixed and easily defended places. The alluvial plain extending behind the marshes was as rich and fertile as that of Chaldæa. Wheat and barley ordinarily yielded an hundred and at times two hundredfold; the towns were surrounded by a shadeless belt of palms; the almond, fig, acacia, poplar, and willow extended in narrow belts along the rivers edge. The climate closely resembles that of Chaldaja: if the midday heat in summer is more pitiless, it is at least tempered by more frequent east winds. The ground, however, soon begins to rise, ascending gradually towards the north-east. The distant and uniform line of mountain-peaks grows loftier on the approach of the traveller, and the hills begin to appear one behind another, clothed halfway up with thick forests, but bare on their summits, or scantily covered with meagre vegetation. They comprise, in fact, six or seven parallel ranges, resembling natural ramparts piled up between the country of the Tigris and the table-land of Iran. The intervening valleys were formerly lakes, having had for the most part no communication with each other and no outlet into the sea. In the course of centuries they had dried up, leaving a thick deposit of mud in the hollows of their ancient beds, from which sprang luxurious and abundant harvests. The rivers--the Uknu,* the Ididi,** and the Ulaî***--which water this region are, on reaching more level ground, connected by canals, and are constantly shifting their beds in the light soil of the Susian plain: they soon attain a width equal to that of the Euphrates, but after a short time lose half their volume in swamps, and empty themselves at the present day into the Shatt-el-Arab. They flowed formerly into that part of the Persian Gulf which extended as far as Kornah, and the sea thus formed the southern frontier of the kingdom.       * The Uknu is the Kerkhah of the present day, the Choaspes      of the Greeks.       ** The Ididi was at first identified with the ancient      Pasitigris, which scholars then desired to distinguish from      the Eulseos: it is now known to be the arm of the Karun      which runs to Dizful, the Koprates of classical times, which      has sometimes been confounded with the Eulaws.       *** The Ulaî, mentioned in the Hebrew texts (Ban. viii. 2,      16), the Euloos of classical writers, also called      Pasitigris. It is the Karun of the present day, until its      confluence with the Shaûr, and subsequently the Shaûr      itself, which waters the foot of the Susian hills.  From earliest times this country was inhabited by three distinct peoples, whose descendants may still be distinguished at the present day, and although they have dwindled in numbers and become mixed with elements of more recent origin, the resemblance to their forefathers is still very remarkable. There were, in the first place, the short and robust people of well-knit figure, with brown skins, black hair and eyes, who belonged to that negritic race which inhabited a considerable part of Asia in prehistoric times.*       * The connection of the negroid type of Susians with the      negritic races of India and Oceania, has been proved, in the      course of M. Dieulafoys expedition to the Susian plains and      the ancient provinces of Elam.

These prevailed in the lowlands and the valleys, where the warm, damp climate favoured their development; but they also spread into the mountain region, and had pushed their outposts as far as the first slopes of the Iranian table-land. They there contact with white-skinned of medium height, who were probably allied to the nations of Northern and Central Asia--to the Scythians,* for instance, if it is permissible to use a vague term employed by the Ancients.       * This last-mentioned people is, by some authors, for      reasons which, so far, can hardly be considered conclusive,      connected with the so-called Sumerian race, which we find      settled in Chaldæa. They are said to have been the first to      employ horses and chariots in warfare.  [Illustration: 047.jpg NATIVE OF MIXED NEGRITIC RACE FROM SUSIANA]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph furnished by      Marcel Dieulafoy.   Semites of the same stock as those of Chaldæa pushed forward as far as the east bank of the Tigris, and settling mainly among the marshes led a precarious life by fishing and pillaging.* The country of the plain was called Anzân, or Anshân,** and the mountain region Numma, or Ilamma, the high lands: these two names were subsequently used to denote the whole country, and Ilamma has survived in the Hebrew word Elam.*** Susa, the most important and flourishing town in the kingdom, was situated between the Ulaî and the Ididi, some twenty-five or thirty miles from the nearest of the mountain ranges.       * From the earliest times we meet beyond the Tigris with      names like that of Durilu, a fact which proves the existence      of races speaking a Semitic dialect in the countries under      the suzerainty of the King of Elam: in the last days of the      Chaldæan empire they had assumed such importance that the      Hebrews made out Elam to be one of the sons of Shem (_Gen._      x. 22).       ** Anzân, Anshân, and, by assimilation of the nasal with the      sibilant, Ashshân. This name has already been mentioned in      the inscriptions of the kings and vicegerents of Lagash and      in the _Book of Prophecies_ of the ancient Chaldæan      astronomers; it also occurs in the royal preamble of Cyrus      and his ancestors, who like him were styled kings of      Anshân. It had been applied to the whole country of Elam,      and afterwards to Persia. Some are of opinion that it was      the name of a part of Elam, viz. that inhabited by the      Turanian Medes who spoke the second language of the      Achæmenian inscriptions, the eastern half, bounded by the      Tigris and the Persian Gulf, consisting of a flat and swampy      land. These differences of opinion gave rise to a heated      controversy; it is now, however, pretty generally admitted      that Anzân-Anshân was really the plain of Elam, from the      mountains to the sea, and one set of authorities affirms      that the word Anzân may have meant plain in the language      of the country, while others hesitate as yet to pronounce      definitely on this point.       *** The meaning of Nunima, Ilamma, Ilamtu, in the      group of words used to indicate Elam, had been recognised      even by the earliest Assyriologists; the name originally      referred to the hilly country on the north and east of Susa.      To the Hebrews, Elam was one of the sons of Shem (Gen. x.      22). The Greek form of the name is Elymais, and some of the      classical geographers were well enough acquainted with the      meaning of the word to be able to distinguish the region to      which it referred from Susiana proper.  [Illustration: 048.jpg THE TUMULUS OF SUSA, AS IT APPEARED TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE XIXth CENTURY]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after a plate in Chesney.  Its fortress and palace were raised upon the slopes of a mound which overlooked the surrounding country:* at its base, to the eastward, stretched the town, with its houses of sun-dried bricks.**       * Susa, in the language of the country, was called Shushun;      this name was transliterated into Chaldæo-Assyrian, by      Shushan, Shushi.       ** Strabo tells us, on the authority of Polycletus, that the      town had no walls in the time of Alexander, and extended      over a space two hundred stadia in length; in the      VIII century B.C. it was enclosed by walls with bastions,      which are shown on a bas-relief of Assurbanipal, but it was      surrounded by unfortified suburbs.  Further up the course of the Uknu, lay the following cities: Madaktu, the Badaca of classical authors,* rivalling Susa in strength and importance; Naditu,** Til-Khumba,*** Dur-Undash,**** Khaidalu.^--all large walled towns, most of which assumed the title of royal cities. Elam in reality constituted a kind of feudal empire, composed of several tribes--the Habardip, the Khushshi, the Umliyash, the people of Yamutbal and of Yatbur^^--all independent of each other, but often united under the authority of one sovereign, who as a rule chose Susa as the seat of government.       * Madaktu, Mataktu, the Badaka of Diodorus, situated on the      Eulaaos, between Susa and Ecbatana, has been placed by      Rawlinson near the bifurcation of the Kerkhah, either at      Paipul or near Aiwân-i-Kherkah, where there are some rather      important and ancient ruins; Billerbeck prefers to put it at      the mouth of the valley of Zal-fer, on the site at present      occupied by the citadel of Kala-i-Riza.       ** Naditu is identified by Finzi with the village of      Natanzah, near Ispahan; it ought rather to be looked for in      the neighbourhood of Sarna.       *** Til-Khumba, the Mound of Khumba, so named after one of      the principal Elamite gods, was, perhaps, situated among the      ruins of Budbar, towards the confluence of the Ab-i-Kirind      and Kerkhah, or possibly higher up in the mountain, in the      vicinity of Asmanabad.       **** Dur-Undash, Dur-Undasi, has been identified, without      absolutely conclusive reason, with the fortress of Kala-i-      Dis on the Disful-Rud.       ^ Khaidalu, Khidalu, is perhaps the present fortress of Dis-      Malkan.       ^^ The countries of Yatbur and Yamutbal extended into the      plain between the marshes of the Tigris and the mountain;      the town of Durilu was"]]]
