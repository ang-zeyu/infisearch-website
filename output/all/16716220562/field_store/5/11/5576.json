My arms were placed about Aspasia, my head bent and turned and twisted--my upon my breast so that the forefinger touched my chin--I felt I was a personified simper; but I was silent and patient, until the arrangement of my draperies began--then I squirmed anxiously.  \"Take care--take care!\" he cautioned.  \"You will sway the others if you move!\"  But in spite of the risk of my marble makeup I faintly groaned:  \"Oh dear! must it be like that?\"  Regardless of the pins in the corner of his mouth he burst into laughter, and, taking a photograph from the bosom of his Greek shirt, he said:  \"I expected a protest from you, Miss, so I came prepared--don't move your head, but just look at this.\"  He held the picture of a group of statuary up to me.  \"This is you on the right.  It's not so dreadful; now, is it?\"  And I cautiously murmured: \"That if I wasn't any worse than that I wouldn't mind.\"  And so we were all satisfied, and our statue scene was very successful.  Next morning I saw Mr. Booth come running out of the theatre on his way to the telegraph office at the corner, and right in the middle of the walk, staring about him, stood a child--a small roamer of the stony streets, who had evidently got far enough beyond his native ward to arouse misgivings as to his personal safety, and at the very moment he stopped to consider matters Mr. Booth dashed out of the stage-door and added to his bewilderment by capsizing him completely.  \"Oh, good lord!  Baby, are you hurt?\" exclaimed Mr. Booth, pausing instantly to pick up the dirty, tousled small heap and stand it on its bandy legs again.  \"Don't cry, little chap!\"  And the aforesaid little chap not only ceased to cry, but gave him a damp and grimy smile, at which the actor bent towards him quickly, but paused, took out his handkerchief, and first carefully wiping the dirty little nose and mouth, stooped and kissed him heartily, put some change in each freckled paw, and continued his run to the telegraph office.  He knew of no witness to the act.  To kiss a pretty, clean child under the approving eyes of mamma might mean nothing but politeness, but surely it required the prompting of a warm and tender heart to make a young and thoughtless man feel for and caress such a dirty, forlorn bit of babyhood as that.  Of his work I suppose I was too young and too ignorant to judge correctly, but I remember well hearing the older members of the company express their opinions.  Mr. Ellsler, who had been on terms of friendship with the elder Booth, was delighted with the promise of his work.  He greatly admired Edwin's intellectual power, his artistic care; but \"John,\" he cried, \"has more of the old man's power in one performance than Edwin can show in a year.  He has the fire, the dash, the touch of strangeness.  He often produces unstudied effects at night.  I question him: 'Did you rehearse that business to-day, John?' He answers:  'No; I didn't rehearse it, it just came to me in the scene and I couldn't help doing it, but it went all right didn't it?'  Full of impulse just now, like a colt, his heels are in the air nearly as often as his head, but wait a year or two till he gets used to the harness and quiets down a bit, and you will see as great an actor as America can produce!\"  One morning, going on the stage where a group were talking with John Wilkes, I beard him say: \"No; oh, no:  There's but one Hamlet to my mind--that's my brother Edwin.  You see, between ourselves, he is Hamlet--melancholy and all!\"    THE MURDER OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN  That was an awful time, when the dread news came to us.  We were in Columbus, Ohio.  We had been horrified by the great crime at Washington.  My room-mate and I had, from our small earnings, bought some black cotton at a tripled price, as all the black material in the city was not sufficient to meet the demand; and as we tacked it about our one window, a man passing told us the assassin had been discovered, and that he was the actor Booth.  Hattie laughed, so she nearly swallowed the tack that, girl-like, she held between her lips, and I after a laugh, told him it was a poor subject for a jest, and we went in.  There was no store in Columbus then where play-books were sold, and as Mr. Ellsler had a very large and complete stage library, he frequently lent his books to us, and we would hurriedly copy out our lines and return the book for his own use.  On that occasion he was going to study his part first and then leave the play with us as he passed, going home.  We heard his knock.  I was busy pressing a bit of stage finery.  Hattie opened the door, and then I heard her exclaiming: \"Why--why--what!\"  I turned quickly.  Mr. Ellsler was coming slowly into the room.  He is a very dark man, but be was perfectly livid then--his lips even were blanched to the whiteness of his cheeks.  His eyes were dreadful, they were so glassy and seemed so unseeing.  He was devoted to his children, and all I could think of as likely to bring such a look upon his face was disaster to one of them, and I cried, as I drew a chair to him:  \"What is it?  Oh, what has happened to them?\"  He sank down--he wiped his brow--he looked almost stupidly at me; then, very faintly, he said: \"You--haven't--heard--anything?\"  Like a flash Hattie's eyes and mine met.  We thought of the supposed ill-timed jest of the stranger.  My lips moved wordlessly.  Hattie stammered: \"A man--he--lied though--said that Wilkes Booth--but he did lie--didn't he?\" and in the same faint voice Mr. Ellsler answered slowly:  \"No--no! he did not lie--it's true!\"  Down fell our heads, and the waves of shame and sorrow seemed fairly to overwhelm us; and while our sobs filled the little room, Mr. Ellsler rose and laid two playbooks on the table.  Then, while standing there, staring into space, I heard his far, faint voice saying: \"So great--so good a man destroyed, and by the hand of that unhappy boy! my God! my God!\"  He wiped his brow again and slowly left the house, apparently unconscious of our presence.  When we resumed our work--the theatre had closed because of the national calamity--many a painted cheek showed runnels made by bitter tears, and one old actress, with quivering lips, exclaimed:  \"One woe doth tread upon another's heels, so fast they follow!\" but with no thought of quoting, and God knows, the words expressed the situation perfectly.  Mrs. Ellsler, whom I never saw shed a tear for any sickness, sorrow, or trouble of her own, shed tears for the mad boy, who had suddenly become the assassin of God's anointed--the great, the blameless Lincoln.  We crept about, quietly.  Every one winced at the sound of the overture.  It was as if one dead lay within the walls--one who belonged to us.  When the rumours about Booth being the murderer proved to be authentic, the police feared a possible outbreak of mob feeling, and a demonstration against the theatre building, or against the actors individually; but we had been a decent, law-abiding, well-behaved people--liked and respected--so we were not made to suffer for the awful act of one of our number.  Still, when the mass-meeting was held in front of the Capitol, there was much anxiety on the subject, and Mr. Ellsler urged all the company to keep away from it, lest their presence might arouse some ill-feeling.  The crowd was immense, the sun had gloomed over, and the Capitol building, draped in black, loomed up with stern severity and that massive dignity only attained by heavily columned buildings.  The people surged like waves about the speaker's stand, and the policemen glanced anxiously toward the not far away new theatre, and prayed that some bombastic, revengeful ruffian might not crop up from this mixed crowd of excited humanity to stir them to violence.  Three speakers, however, in their addresses had confined themselves to eulogising the great dead.  In life Mr. Lincoln had been abused by many--in death he was worshipped by all; and these speakers found their words of love and sorrow eagerly listened to, and made no harsh allusions to the profession from which the assassin sprang.  And then an unknown man clambered up from the crowd to the portico platform and began to speak, without asking any one's permission.  He had a far-reaching voice--he had fire and go.  \"Here's the fellow to look out for!\" said the policemen; and, sure enough, suddenly the dread word \"theatre\" was tossed into the air, and every one was still in a moment, waiting for--what?  I don't know what they hoped for--I do know what many feared; but this is what he said: \"Yes, look over at our theatre and think of the little body of men and women there, who are to-day sore-hearted and cast down; who feel that they are looked at askant, because one of their number has committed that hideous crime!  Think of what they have to bear of shame and horror, and spare them, too, a little pity!\"  He paused.  It had been a bold thing to do--to appeal for consideration for actors at such a time.  The crowd swayed for a moment to and fro, a curious growling came from it, and then all heads turned toward the theatre.  A faint cheer was given, and afterward there was not the slightest allusion made to us--and verily we were grateful.  That the homely, tender-hearted \"Father Abraham\"--rare combination of courage, justice, and humanity--died at an actor's hand will be a grief, a horror, and a shame to the profession forever; yet I cannot believe that John Wilkes Booth was \"the leader of a band of bloody conspirators.\"  Who shall draw a line and say: here genius ends and madness begins? There was that touch of--strangeness.  In Edwin it was a profound melancholy; in John it was an exaggeration of spirit--almost a wildness.  There was the natural vanity of the actor, too, who craves a dramatic situation in real life.  There was his passionate love and sympathy for the South--why, he was \"easier to be played on than a pipe.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17022"],["title","The First Discovery of Australia and New Guinea (#0)"],["body","First Discovery of Australia and New Guinea  Being The Narrative of Portuguese and Spanish Discoveries in the Australasian Regions, between the Years 1492-1606, with Descriptions of their Old Charts.

Of the many books which have been published on subjects relating to Australia and Australian History, I am not aware of any, since my late friend, Mr. R. H. Major's introduction to his valuable work, \"Early Voyages to Terra Australis,\" which has attempted a systematic investigation into the earliest discoveries of the great Southern Island-Continent, and the first faint indications of knowledge that such a land existed. Mr. Major's work was published in 1859, at a time when the materials for such an enquiry were much smaller than at present. The means of reproducing and distributing copies of the many ancient maps which are scattered among the various libraries of Europe were then very imperfect, and the science of Comparative Cartography, of which the importance is now well recognised, was in its infancy. For these reasons his discussion, useful though it still is, cannot be regarded as abreast of modern opportunities. It is, indeed, after the lapse of more than a third of a century, somewhat out of date. Having, therefore, been led to give close attention during several years to the whole subject, I have thought the time ripe for the present work.  The distance from the great centres and stores of knowledge at which I have been compelled to labour will excuse to the candid critic the errors which will no doubt be discovered; yet I feel some confidence that these will prove to be omissions rather than positive mistakes. No pains have been spared in investigating the full body of documents now available.  Though unable to examine personally some manuscripts of interest and value, I believe I can truly say that I have read every book and examined every map of real importance to the question which has been produced in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Dutch. I have corresponded also largely during the past four years with many of the most eminent members of the Geographical Societies of London, Paris, Madrid, Lisbon, Rome, Amsterdam and Neuchatel. To these gentlemen I am deeply indebted for searches which they have made for me in the libraries and museums within their reach, for much information readily and kindly afforded, and for the interest and sympathy which they had at all times manifested in my labours. My thanks are due also to the gentlemen in charge of the Sydney Free Public Library who kindly enriched their collection with many rare, and very useful volumes of permanent importance which I was unable to procure myself, and who aided my researches by every means in their power.  I cannot hope that in a subject so vast and interesting, I shall be found to have said the last word, yet I trust that my book may prove to be of value, both in itself, and as directing the attention of others to a field which should be mainly explored by residents of Australia. Such as it is, I now send it forth, with the natural solicitude of a parent, and commend it to the indulgence of the reader, and the kindly justice of the critic.  GEORGE COLLINGRIDGE, \"Jave-la-Grande,\" Hornsby Junction, July, 1895.    PUBLISHERS' NOTE.  Ten years ago, Mr. George Collingridge published \"The Discovery of Australia.\"--a large quarto volume, bulky, erudite and expensive. It took its place as a valuable contribution to the literature of the country, and remains the world-accepted authority on the important and interesting subject with which it deals. But it was in nowise suited to the general reader--being designed more for the scholar than for the person who desired to conveniently possess himself of authentic information relating to the earliest annals of Australian discovery.  To meet the requirements of the general reader, and to serve as a text book of Australian History, the present publication has been issued as a handy compendium of the original volume.  From this book, all controversial matter has been omitted as irrelevant to a work intended as a handbook for either scholar or student.  The valuable facsimiles of rare and ancient maps have been retained, many illustrations have been included in the text, and the story of the explorers has been dealt with at greater length by the author, whose patient antiquarian research, his knowledge of European and Oriental Languages, and his opportunities as a member of several Geographical Societies, have given him unusual facilities for the compilation of a work which may confidently be expected to find its way into every scholastic, public and private library in the Commonwealth.  --The Publishers.     INTRODUCTION.  The discovery of a continental island like Australia was not a deed that could be performed in a day. Many years passed away, and many voyages to these shores of ours were undertaken by the leading maritime nations of Europe, before the problematic and mysterious TERRA AUSTRALIS INCOGNITA of the ancients became known, even in a summary way, and its insularity and separation from other lands positively established.  We must not be astonished, therefore, at the strange discrepancies that occur in early charts and narratives, for it took time to realize how different portions of our coast lines, which had been sighted from time to time might be connected, and how the gaps might be filled in by fresh discoveries and approximate surveys.  The question as to who first sighted Australia, and placed on record such discovery, either in the shape of map or narrative, will, in all probability, ever remain a mystery.  However, that such a record was made appears evident when we consider certain early charts, follow carefully the testimony which the evolution of Australian cartography affords, and take cognisance of various descriptive passages to be found in old authors.  These passages will be given here in connection with the old charts, and followed up by the narratives of voyages in search of the \"Great South Land.\"  The numerous maps and illustrations have been carefully selected; they will greatly help the student towards understanding these first pages of the history of Australia.  GEORGE COLLINGRIDGE.    THE FIRST DISCOVERY OF AUSTRALIA AND NEW GUINEA.    CHAPTER I.  IN QUEST OF THE SPICE ISLANDS.  \"And the New South rose with her forehead bare-- Her forehead hare to meet the smiling sun-- Australia in her golden panoply; And far off Empires see her work begun, And her large hope has compassed every sea.\"    --SIR GILBERT PARKER.   What was the relative position of European nations in the arena of maritime discovery at the beginning of the sixteenth century?  Portugal was then mistress of the sea.  Spain, too, indulging in an awakening yawn, was clutching with her outstretched hands at the shadowy treasure-islands of an unfinished dream.  England had not yet launched her "]]]
