No. 6 (in G),          Vivace, Grave, Allegro, Allegro. No. 10 (in A minor),   Vivace, Allegro, Adagio, Allegro.  There are, however, eight sonatas consisting of _three movements_; and as this, a century later, became the normal number, we will give the list:--  Op. 1, No. 7 (in C)            Allegro, Grave, Allegro.                                (Middle movement begins in                                A minor, but ends in C.)  Op. 2, No. 2 (in D minor)      Allemanda (Adagio)                                Corrente (Allegro), Giga                                (Allegro).  Op. 2, No. 6 (in G minor)      Allemanda (Largo), Corrente,                                Giga.  Op. 2, No. 9 (F sharp minor)   Allemanda (Largo).                                Tempo di Sarabanda (Largo).                                Giga (Allegro).  Op. 4, No. 8 (D minor)         Preludio (Grave).                                Allemanda (Allegro).                                Sarabanda (Allegro).  Op. 4, No. 10 (G)              Preludio[3] (Adagio) and Allegro.                                Adagio and Grave (E minor).                                Tempo di Gavotta (Allegro).  Op. 4, No. 11 (C minor)        Preludio (Largo).                                Corrente (Allegro).                                Allemanda (Allegro).  Op. 4, No. 12 (B minor)        Preludio (Largo).                                Allemanda (Presto).                                Giga (Allegro).  It is interesting to note that each of the two sonatas (Op. 1, No. 7, and Op. 4, No. 10), most in keeping with its title of sonata, has the middle movement in a relative key. Op. 1, No. 7, begins with an Allegro in common time; and the short Grave is followed by a light Allegro in six-eight time. The first movement, with its marked return to the principal key, is very interesting in the matter of form. The other sonatas with suite titles have all their movements in the same key. Locatelli in his _XII Sonate_ for flute, published early in the eighteenth century, has in the first: Andante, Adagio, Presto; also Nos. 3, 5, etc. So, too, in Tartini's Sonatas (Op. 1) there are also some in three (No. 3, etc.). But Emanuel Bach commenced with that number, to which, with few and unimportant exceptions, he remained faithful; likewise to the slow movement dividing the two quick ones. The three-movement form used by J.S. Bach for his concertos and sonatas no doubt considerably influenced his son. But already, in 1668, Diderich Becker, in his _Musikalische Frülings-Früchte_, wrote sonatas for violins, etc. and _continuo_, in three movements. (No. 10, Allegro, Adagio, Allegro. Again, Sonata No. 19 opens with a movement in common time, most probably an Allegro; then comes an Adagio, and, lastly, a movement in six-four, most probably quick _tempo_.) These sonatas of Becker _a 3_, _4_ or _5_, with _basso continuo_, are unfortunately only printed in parts. As a connecting link between the Gabrielis and Corelli, and more particularly as a forerunner of Kuhnau, Becker is of immense importance. We are concerned with the clavier sonata, otherwise we should certainly devote more space to this composer. We have been able to trace back sonatas by German composers to Becker (1668), and by Italian composers to Legrenzi (1655); those of Gabrieli and Banchieri, as short pieces, not a group of movements, are not taken into account. Now, of earlier history, we do know that Hans Leo. von Hasler, said to have been born at Nuremberg in 1564, studied first with his father, but afterwards at Venice, and for a whole year under A. Gabrieli. Italian and German art are thus intimately connected; but what each gave to, or received from, the other with regard to the sonata seems impossible to determine. The Becker sonatas appeared at Hamburg, and surely E. Bach must have been acquainted with them. Becker in his preface mentions another Hamburg musician--a certain Johann Schop--who did much for the cause of instrumental music. Schop, it appears, published concertos for various instruments already in the year 1644. And there was still another work of importance published at Amsterdam, very early in the eighteenth century, by the famous violinist and composer G. Torelli, which must have been known to E. Bach. It is entitled \"Six Sonates ou Concerts à 4, 5, e 6 Parties,\" and of these, five have three movements (Allegro, Adagio, and Allegro).  Corelli was the founder of a school of violin composers, of which Geminiani,[4] Locatelli,[5] Veracini,[6] and Tartini[7] were the most distinguished representatives; the first two were actually pupils of the master. In the sonatas of these men there is an advance in two directions: sonata-form[8] is in process of evolution from binary form, _i.e._ the second half of the first section is filled with subject-matter of more definite character; the bars of modulation and development are growing in number and importance; and the principal theme appears as the commencement of a recapitulation. We should like to say that _binary_ is changing into _ternary_ form; unfortunately, however, the latter term is used for a different kind of movement. To speak of a movement in sonata-form, containing three sections (exposition, development, and recapitulation) as in binary form, seems a decided misnomer.  The violinists just mentioned were the last great writers of sonatas in Italy. Emanuel Bach arose during the first half of the eighteenth century, and, henceforth, Germany took the lead; Bach was followed by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. The influence of the Corelli[9] school was felt in Germany and also in England. Sonatas were published by Veracini at Dresden in 1721, and by Tartini and Locatelli at Amsterdam before 1740. Again Veracini was for a time solo violinist to the Elector of Dresden (1720-23); Tartini lived for three years at Prague (1723-26), while Locatelli, during the first half of the eighteenth century, made frequent journeys throughout Germany. Emanuel Bach, the real founder of the modern pianoforte sonata, must have been influenced by their works.  In a history of the development of the sonata generally, those of Corelli would occupy an important place, for in them we find not only fugal and dance forms, but also hints of sonata-form.  Dr. Parry, in his article on \"Sonata\" in Sir G. Grove's _Dictionary of Music and Musicians_, has named the Corrente of Corelli's 5th Sonata in Op. 4 as offering \"nearly a miniature of modern binary form.\" The well-known Giga Allegro of the 9th Sonata (Op. 5), and the Allemanda Allegro of the 10th Concerto in C, also present remarkable foreshadowings.  Handel, however, furnishes a very striking illustration--  In the six \"Sonatas or Trios for two Hoboys with a thorough bass for the harpsichord,\" said to have been composed already in 1696, we find quick movements in binary form. In some, the first section offers both a first and a second subject, while in the second section, after modulation, there is a return to the opening theme, though quite at the close of that section. A brief description of one will make the form clearer. The second Allegro of No. 4 (in F) has two sections. The first, which ends in the dominant key (C), contains forty-six bars. The opening theme begins thus:--  [Music illustration: _a_]  At the twenty-ninth bar, a passage leads to the second theme--  [Music illustration: _b_]  This second theme is, in a measure, evolved from the first. In any case, it is of subordinate character; and it differs slightly as given by first or second oboe, whereas the principal theme appears in exactly the same manner for both instruments.  The second section opens with developments of _b_, and modulation from C major to D minor; _a_ also is developed, the music passing from the last-named key back to the opening one. There is a full close in that key, and then modulation to F. The remaining twenty-two bars give the first section in condensed form: first and second subjects and coda.[10]  It would be interesting to trace the influences acting on the youth Handel at the time when he wrote these sonatas. Most probably they were Johann Philipp Krieger's[11] sonatas for violins and bass; N.A. Strungk's sonatas published at Dresden in 1691; and more especially Agostino Steffani's \"Sonate da Camera\" for two violins, alto, and bass, published in 1683. An opera by the last-named, which appeared at Hanover in 1699, has an \"Air de Ballet,\" which contains the first notes of \"Let the bright Seraphim\"; besides, it is known that Handel culled ideas and \"conveyed\" notes from works of other composers; also, that he turned them to the best account.  In the same year in which Corelli published his Op. 1 (1683), Domenico Scarlatti, the famous harpsichord player, was probably born; in the history of development his name is the principal one of importance between Corelli and Emanuel Bach. In the matter of technique he rendered signal service, but, for the moment, we are concerned with his contribution towards development. Scarlatti does not seem to have ever considered the sonata in the sense of a work consisting of several contrasting movements; all of his are of only one movement. The title \"sonata\" as applied to his pieces is, therefore, misleading. Whether the term was actually used by the composer himself seems doubtful. The first thirty of the sixty Scarlatti sonatas published by Breitkopf & Härtel appeared during the lifetime of the composer at Madrid. They are dedicated to John the Just, King of Portugal, and are merely entitled       _Essercizi per Gravicembalo._  In editions of the eighteenth century the composer's pieces are styled Lessons or Suites. However, twelve published by J."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17074"],["title","The Pianoforte Sonata (#2)"],["body","ohnson, London, are described on the title-page as _Sonatas modernas_.  From the earliest days of instrumental music dance tunes were divided into two sections. The process of evolution is interesting. In the earliest specimens, such as the _Branle_ given in the Orchésographie of Thoinot Arbeau, we find both sections in the same key, and there is only one theme. The movement towards the dominant note in this _Branle_ may be regarded as a latent modulation. In time the first section was developed, and the latent modulation became real; then, after certain intermediate stages, the custom was established of passing from the principal to the dominant key (or, in a minor piece, to the relative major or dominant minor), in which the first section closed. But in Corelli,[12] and even in Scarlatti,[13] we find, occasionally, a return to an earlier stage (_i.e._ a first section ending in the same key in which it commenced). In most of his pieces Scarlatti modulates to the dominant; in minor, to the relative major. Some exceptions deserve mention. In the Breitkopf & Härtel collection, No. 26, in A major, passes to the minor key of the dominant; and No. 11, in C minor, modulates to the minor key of the dominant, but the section closes in the major key of the dominant.  Scarlatti's sonatas consist, then, of one movement in binary form of the early type. Only in a few of these pieces is there a definite second subject; in none, a return to the opening theme. [Music illustration] In No. 26 there is just a return to the first bar (see second section, bar 11), but the previous ten bars show no modulation, and one can scarcely speak of thematic development. After the few bars of development and modulation, in some cases, the second section is found to consist merely of a repetition of some part of the first section, the key being tonic instead of dominant. This is, practically, embryonic sonata-form. The tonic and dominant portions of the first section are becoming differentiated; but the landmark, _i.e._ the return to the opening theme in the second section which divides binary from sonata form, is, in Scarlatti, non-existent. His first sections often consist of a principal theme and passages, also phrases indirectly connected with the opening one; sometimes of a chain of short phrases more or less evolved from the opening thought (see Nos. 1, 21, 29). (These and the numbers which follow refer to the Breitkopf & Härtel edition of sixty Scarlatti sonatas.) The composer often passes through the minor key of the dominant (in the first section) before arriving at the major; sometimes the major is introduced only late in the section (Nos. 7, 17, etc.), or minor remains (No. 26). We meet with a similar proceeding in Beethoven. Minor pieces often pass to the dominant minor, but end in major (_i.e._, first section). In Scarlatti there is, for the most part, no second subject, but frequently (Nos. 5, 7, 9, etc.) a concluding phrase which can, at times, be traced to the opening theme. Sonata 6, in F, shows a second subject of a certain independence. The best examples are to be found in Nos. 24 and 29 (in A and E); in these the character of the second subject differs from that of the first, and it is also in a minor key, which offers still another contrast.  And now a word or two respecting Scarlatti's method of development. He alters figures (Nos. 12 and 54), extends them (Nos. 9 and 54), but often merely repeats passages on the same degrees as those of the first section, or on different ones. He makes use of imitation (Nos. 7 and 36). Sometimes he evolves a phrase from a motive (No. 11). In No. 19 the development assumes a certain importance. It commences, not, as in most cases, with the opening theme or figure of the first section, but with a group of semiquaver notes which appears later in that section. In No. 20 Scarlatti preserves the rhythm, but with total change of notes (No. 20)--  [Music illustration]  The same number gives another interesting specimen of change of rhythm. In No. 48 he picks out an unimportant group of notes, and works it by imitation and sequence. There are some interesting specimens of development in the thirty sonatas printed from manuscripts in the possession of Lord Viscount Fitzwilliam by Robert Birchall. Scarlatti's development bars are seldom many in number.  After modulation and development, the music slides, as it were, into some phrase from the first section,[14] and allowance being made on account of difference of key (there the music was passing, or had passed from tonic; here it is returning to that key), the rest is more or less a repetition of the first section. _More or less_: sometimes the repetition is literal; at other times there is considerable deviation; and shortenings are frequent. With regard to style of writing for the clavier--a few canonic imitations excepted--there is no real polyphony. Most of the sonatas are in only two parts. The composer revels in rapid passages (runs, broken chords, simple and compound), wide leaps, difficult octaves, crossing of hands, and, of course, short shakes innumerable. Domenico Scarlatti was indeed one of the most renowned _virtuosi_ on the clavier. Handel met him at Rome in 1708, and Cardinal Ottoboni persuaded them to compete with each other. We are told that upon the harpsichord the victory was doubtful, but upon the organ, Scarlatti himself confessed the superiority of his rival.[15]  Johann Kuhnau published a sonata for clavier in 1695, and this was followed up by a set of seven sonatas (\"Frische Früchte\") in 1696, and a few years later (1700) by the seven \"Bible\" Sonatas. That he was the first composer who wrote a sonata for the clavier is a point which cannot be overlooked, and in the evolution of the sonata he occupies an interesting position. In the \"Frische Früchte\" there is, as Dr. C.H. Parry truly remarks in his excellent article \"Sonata\" in Sir G. Grove's _Dictionary of Music and Musicians_, an awakening sense of the relation and balance of keys; but in the \"Bible\" Sonatas the form and order of the movements is entirely determined by the Bible stories. As specimens of programme-music they are altogether remarkable, and will, later on, be described in detail; they do not, however, come within the regular line of development. It was, of course, natural that such a new departure should attract the notice of John Sebastian Bach, who was Kuhnau's immediate successor as cantor of St. Thomas' School, Leipzig, and Spitta, in his life of Bach, refers to that composer's _Capriccio sopra la lontananza del suo fratello dilettissimo_, and reminds us that \"Kuhnau as well as so many others had some influence on Bach.\" Of course, among the \"so many others,\" Froberger's name--as we shall see later on from Kuhnau's preface--deserves a prominent place. In addition to what Kuhnau says, Mattheson has recorded that \"Froberger could depict whole histories on the clavier, giving a representation of the persons present and taking part in them, with all their natural characters.\" When writing the Capriccio above named, Spitta believes that Bach was specially influenced by the last of the \"Bible\" Sonatas (we may perhaps add that Spitta tells us that Bach was intimately acquainted with Kuhnau). He indeed says: \"We might doubt the early origin of the Capriccio if its evident 'dependence' on Kuhnau did not solve the mystery.\" Then, again, in a Sonata in D by Bach, published in the Bach Gesellschaft edition, Spitta calls attention to the opening subject in D, and does not hesitate to declare that \"it is constructed on the pattern of a particular part of the story of Jacob's marriage\" (the 3rd of the \"Bible\" Sonatas). His description of the Bach sonata would, doubtless, have attracted more notice but for the fact that copies of the Kuhnau sonatas were extremely rare; they were, we believe, never reprinted since the commencement of the eighteenth century. The first two have now been published by Messrs Novello & Co. The Kuhnau influence on Bach seems, however, to have been of short duration; for, after these juvenile attempts, as Spitta observes, \"he never again returned to this branch of music in the whole course of a long artistic career extending over nearly fifty years.\" The fugue form absorbed nearly the whole attention of that master; and the idea of programme-music remained in abeyance until Beethoven revived it a century later.[16] Emanuel Bach inherited some of his father's genius, and he may instinctively have felt the utter hopelessness of following directly in his footsteps. J.S. Bach had exhausted the possibilities of the fugue form. It was perhaps fortunate for Emanuel Bach that, while still young, he left his father's house. After residing for a few years at Frankfort-on-the-Oder, he entered the service of Frederick the Great; and at the court of that monarch he came, at any rate, directly under Italian influence.  An interesting link between Kuhnau and E. Bach is Mattheson, who published at Hamburg in 1713 a sonata dedicated to the one who can best play it (_derjenigen Persohn gewidmet, die sie am besten spielen wird_). The work itself not being available, the following description of it by J. Faisst (_Caecilia_, vol. 25, p. 157) may prove interesting:--\"It (_i.e._ the sonata) consists of only one movement, which, considering its evidently intentional wealth of technique, might be named a Toccata. But in form this one movement clearly belongs to the sonata order, and, in fact, holds a middle place between the tendencies towards sonata-form (the term taken in the narrower sense of form of one single movement) noticeable in Kuhnau, and the more developed shape which this form has assumed within recent times. We have here three sections. In the opening one, the theme, after its first exposition in the key of G, forms the basis of various passages, and then appears in the key of the dominant, followed again by passages of larger extent and richer contents; "]]]
