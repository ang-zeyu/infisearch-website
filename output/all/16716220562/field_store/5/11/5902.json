Certain episodes of these expeditions had been      engraved on the exterior face of the pylon constructed by      the king for the temple of Amon at Karnak; at the present      time they are concealed by the wall at the lower end of the      Hypostyle Hall. The tribute of the Lotanû was represented on      the tomb of Hûi, at Sheîkh-Abd-el-Qûrneh.  [Illustration: 052b.jpg Amenothes III. Colossal Head in the British Museum]  [Illustration: 052b-text.jpg]  The remembrance of the victories of Thûtmosis III. was still fresh in their memories, and, even had their hands been free, would have made them cautious in dealing with his great-grandson; but they were incessantly engaged in internecine quarrels, and had recourse to Pharaoh merely to enlist his support, or at any rate make sure of his neutrality, and prevent him from joining their adversaries.

Whatever might have been the nature of their private sentiments, they professed to be anxious to maintain, for their mutual interests, the relations with Egypt entered on half a century before, and as the surest method of attaining their object was by a good marriage, they would each seek an Egyptian wife for himself, or would offer Amenôthes a princess of one of their own royal families. The Egyptian king was, however, firm in refusing to bestow a princess of the solar blood even on the most powerful of the foreign kings; his pride rebelled at the thought that she might one day be consigned to a place among the inferior wives or concubines, but he gladly accepted, and even sought for wives for himself, from among the Syrian and Chaldæan princesses. Kallimmasin of Babylon gave Amenôthes first his sister, and when age had deprived this princess of her beauty, then his daughter Irtabi in marriage.*       * Letter from Amenôthes III. to Kallimmasin, concerning a      sister of the latter, who was married to the King of Egypt,      but of whom there are no further records remaining at      Babylon, and also one of his daughters whom Amenôthes had      demanded in marriage; and letters from Kallimmasin,      consenting to bestow his daughter Irtabi on the Pharaoh, and      proposing to give to Amenothes whichever one he might choose      of the daughters of his house.  Sutarna of Mitanni had in the same way given the Pharaoh his daughter Gilukhîpa; indeed, most of the kings of that period had one or two relations in the harem at Thebes. This connexion usually proved a support to Asiatic sovereigns, such alliances being a safeguard against the rivalries of their brothers or cousins. At times, however, they were the means of exposing them to serious dangers. When Sutarna died he was succeeded by his son Dushratta, but a numerous party put forward another prince, named Artassumara, who was probably Gilukhîpas brother, on the mothers side;* a Hittite king of the name of Pirkhi espoused the cause of the pretender, and a civil war broke out.       * Her exact relationship is not explicitly expressed, but is      implied in the facts, for there seems no reason why      Gilukhîpa should have taken the part of one brother rather      than another, unless Artassumara had been nearer to her than      Dushratta; that is to say, her brother on the mothers side      as well as on the fathers.  Dushratta was victorious, and caused his brother to be strangled, but was not without anxiety as to the consequences which might follow this execution should Gilukhîpa desire to avenge the victim, and to this end stir up the anger of the suzerain against him. Dushratta, therefore, wrote a humble epistle, showing that he had received provocation, and that he had found it necessary to strike a decisive blow to save his own life; the tablet was accompanied by various presents to the royal pair, comprising horses, slaves, jewels, and perfumes. Gilukhîpa, however, bore Dushratta no ill-will, and the latters anxieties were allayed. The so-called expeditions of Amenôthes to the Syrian provinces must constantly have been merely visits of inspection, during which amusements, and especially the chase, occupied nearly as important a place as war and politics. Amenôthes III. took to heart that pre-eminently royal duty of ridding the country of wild beasts, and fulfilled it more conscientiously than any of his predecessors. He had killed 112 lions during the first ten years of his reign, and as it was an exploit of which he was remarkably proud, he perpetuated the memory of it in a special inscription, which he caused to be engraved on numbers of large scarabs of fine green enamel. Egypt prospered under his peaceful government, and if the king made no great efforts to extend her frontiers, he spared no pains to enrich the country by developing industry and agriculture, and also endeavoured to perfect the military organisation which had rendered the conquest of the East so easy a matter.  A census, undertaken by his minister Amenôthes, the son of Hâpi, ensured a more correct assessment of the taxes, and a regular scheme of recruiting for the army.  [Illustration: 056.jpg SCARAB OF THE HUNT]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the photograph published in      Mariette.  Whole tribes of slaves were brought into the country by means of the border raids which were always taking place, and their opportune arrival helped to fill up the vacancies which repeated wars had caused among the rural and urban population; such a strong impetus to agriculture was also given by this importation, that when, towards the middle of the reign, the minister Khâmhâîfc presented the tax-gathers at court, he was able to boast that he had stored in the State granaries a larger quantity of corn than had been gathered in for thirty years. The traffic carried on between Asia and the Delta by means of both Egyptian and foreign ships was controlled by customhouses erected at the mouths of the Nile, the coast being protected by cruising vessels against the attacks of pirates. The fortresses of the isthmus and of the Libyan border, having been restored or rebuilt, constituted a check on the turbulence of the nomad tribes, while garrisons posted at intervals at the entrance to the Wadys leading to the desert restrained the plunderers scattered between the Nile and the Red Sea, and between the chain of Oases and the unexplored regions of the Sahara.* Egypt was at once the most powerful as well as the most prosperous kingdom in the world, being able to command more labour and more precious metals for the embellishment of her towns and the construction of her monuments than any other.       All this information is gathered from the inscription on the           statue of Amenôthes, the son of Hâpi.  Public works had been carried on briskly under Thûtmosis III. and his successors. The taste for building, thwarted at first by the necessity of financial reforms, and then by that of defraying the heavy expenses incurred through the expulsion of the Hyksôs and the earlier foreign wars, had free scope as soon as spoil from the Syrian victories began to pour in year by year. While the treasure seized from the enemy provided the money, the majority of the prisoners were used as workmen, so that temples, palaces, and citadels began to rise as if by magic from one end of the valley to the other.*       * For this use of prisoners of war, cf. the picture from the      tomb of Rakhmirî on p. 58 of the present work, in which most      of the earlier Egyptologists believed they recognised the      Hebrews, condemned by Pharaoh to build the cities of Ramses      and Pithom in the Delta.  Nubia, divided into provinces, formed merely an extension of the ancient feudal Egypt--at any rate as far as the neighbourhood of the Tacazzeh--though the Egyptian religion had here assumed a peculiar character.  [Illustration: 058.jpg A GANG Of SYRIAN PRISONERS MAKING BRICK FOR THE TEMPLE OF AMON]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the chromolithograph in Lepsius.  The conquest of Nubia having been almost entirely the work of the Theban dynasties, the Theban triad, Amon, Maût, and Montû, and their immediate followers were paramount in this region, while in the north, in witness of the ancient Elephantinite colonisation, we find Khnûmû of the cataract being worshipped, in connexion with Didûn, father of the indigenous Nubians. The worship of Amon had been the means of introducing that of Eâ and of Horus, and Osiris as lord of the dead, while Phtah, Sokhît, Atûmû, and the Memphite and Heliopolitan gods were worshipped only in isolated parts of the province. A being, however, of less exalted rank shared with the lords of heaven the favour of the people. This was the Pharaoh, who as the son of Amon was foreordained to receive divine honours, sometimes figuring, as at Bohani, as the third member of a triad, at other times as head of the Ennead. Ûsirtasen III. had had his chapels at Semneh and at Kûmmeh, they were restored by Thûtmosis III., who claimed a share of the worship offered in them, and whose son, Amenôthes II., also assumed the symbols and functions of divinity.

Amenôthes I. was venerated in the province of Kari, and Amenôthes III., when founding the fortress Hâît-Khâmmâît* in the neighbourhood of a Nubian village, on a spot now known as Soleb, built a temple there, of which he himself was the protecting genius.**       * The name signifies literally the Citadel of Khâmmâît,       and it is formed, as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17326"],["title","History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 6 (of 12) (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: Spines]  [Illustration: Cover]  HISTORY OF EGYPT CHALDEA, SYRIA, BABYLONIA, AND ASSYRIA  By G.

It continued to extend in the south-western direction from the heroic period of the XVIIIth dynasty onwards, and all the eminence and valleys were gradually appropriated one after the other for burying-places. At the time of which I am speaking, this region formed an actual town, or rather a chain of villages, each of which was grouped round some building constructed by one or other of the Pharaohs as a funerary chapel. Towards the north, opposite Karnak, they clustered at Drah-abul-Neggah around pyramids of the first Theban monarchs, at Qurneh around the mausolæ of Ramses I. and Seti I., and at Sheikh Abd el-Qurneh they lay near the Amenopheum and the Pamonkaniqîmît, or Ramesseum built by Ramses II. Towards the south they diminished in number, tombs and monuments becoming fewer and appearing at wider intervals; the Migdol of Ramses III. formed an isolated suburb, that of Azamît, at Medinet-Habu; the chapel of Isis, constructed by Amenôthes, son of Hapû, formed a rallying-point for the huts of the hamlet of Karka;* and in the far distance, in a wild gorge at the extreme limit of human habitations, the queens of the Ramesside line slept their last sleep.       * The village of Karka or Kaka was identified by Brugsch      with the hamlet of Deîr el-Medineh: the founder of the      temple was none other than Amenôthes, who was minister under      Amenôthes III.  [Illustration: 004.jpg THE THEBAN CEMETERIES]  Each of these temples had around it its enclosing wall of dried brick, and the collection of buildings within this boundary formed the Khîrû, or retreat of some one of the Theban Pharaohs, which, in the official language of the time, was designated the august Khîrû of millions of years.  [Illustration: 005.jpg THE NECROPOLIS OF SHEÎKH AND EL-QURNEH]       Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Beato.  A sort of fortified structure, which was built into one of the corners, served as a place of deposit for the treasure and archives, and could be used as a prison if occasion required.*       * This was the hliatmû, the dungeon, frequently mentioned in      the documents bearing upon the necropolis.  The remaining buildings consisted of storehouses, stables, and houses for the priests and other officials. In some cases the storehouses were constructed on a regular plan which the architect had fitted in with that of the temple. Their ruins at the back and sides of the Ramesseum form a double row of vaults, extending from the foot of the hills to the border of the cultivated lands. Stone recesses on the roof furnished shelter for the watchmen.* The outermost of the village huts stood among the nearest tombs. The population which had been gathered together there was of a peculiar character, and we can gather but a feeble idea of its nature from the surroundings of the cemeteries in our own great cities. Death required, in fact, far more attendants among the ancient Egyptians than with us. The first service was that of mummification, which necessitated numbers of workers for its accomplishment. Some of the workshops of the embalmers have been discovered from time to time at Sheikh Abd el-Qurneh and Deîr el-Baharî, but we are still in ignorance as to their arrangements, and as to the exact nature of the materials which they employed. A considerable superficial space was required, for the manipulations of the embalmers occupied usually from sixty to eighty days, and if we suppose that the average deaths at Thebes amounted to fifteen or twenty in the twenty-four hours, they would have to provide at the same time for the various degrees of saturation of some twelve to fifteen hundred bodies at the least.**       * The discovery of quantities of ostraca in the ruins of      these chambers shows that they served partly for cellars.       ** I have formed my estimate of fifteen to twenty deaths per      day from the mortality of Cairo during the French      occupation. This is given by R. Desgenettes, in the      _Description de lEgypte_, but only approximately, as many      deaths, especially of females, must have been concealed from      the authorities; I have, however, made an average from the      totals, and applied the rate of mortality thus obtained to      ancient Thebes. The same result follows from calculations      based on more recent figures, obtained before the great      hygienic changes introduced into Cairo by Ismail Pacha, i.e.      from August 1, 1858, to July 31, 1859, and from May 24,      1865, to May 16, 1866, and for the two years from April 2,      1869, to March 21, 1870, and from April 2, 1870, to March      21, 1871.  Each of the corpses,moreover, necessitated the employment of at least half a dozen workmen to wash it, cut it open, soak it, dry it, and apply the usual bandages before placing the amulets upon the canonically prescribed places, and using the conventional prayers.  [Illustration: 007.jpg HEAD OF A THEBAN MUMMY]       Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-Bey.  There was fastened to the breast, immediately below the neck, a stone or green porcelain scarab, containing an inscription which was to be efficacious in preventing the heart, his heart which came to him from his mother, his heart from the time he was upon the earth, from rising up and witnessing against the dead man before the tribunal of Osiris.* There were placed on his fingers gold or enamelled rings, as talismans to secure for him the true voice.**       * The manipulations and prayers were prescribed in the Book      of Embalming.       ** The prescribed gold ring was often replaced by one of      blue or green enamel.  The body becomes at last little more than a skeleton, with a covering of yellow skin which accentuates the anatomical, details, but the head, on the other hand, still preserves, where the operations have been properly conducted, its natural form. The cheeks have fallen in slightly, the lips and the fleshy parts of the nose have become thinner and more drawn than during life, but the general expression of the face remains unaltered.  [Illustration: 008.jpg THE MANUFACTURE AND PAINTING OF THE CARTONNAGE]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after Rosellini.  A mask of pitch was placed over the visage to preserve it, above which was adjusted first a piece of linen and then a series of bands impregnated with resin, which increased the size of the head to twofold its ordinary bulk. The trunk and limbs were bound round with a first covering of some pliable soft stuff, warm to the touch. Coarsely powdered natron was scattered here and there over the body as an additional preservative. Packets placed between the legs, the arms and the hips, and in the eviscerated abdomen, contained the heart, spleen, the dried brain, the hair, and the cuttings of the beard and nails. In those days the hair had a special magical virtue: by burning it while uttering certain incantations, one might acquire an almost limitless power over the person to whom it had belonged. The ernbalmers, therefore, took care to place with the mummy such portions of the hair as they had been obliged to cut off, so as to remove them out of the way of the perverse ingenuity of the sorcerers.  [Illustration: 009.jpg WRAPPING OF THE MUMMY, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE MAN OF THE ROLL]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Rosellini.  Over the first covering of the mummy already alluded to, there was sometimes placed a strip of papyrus or a long piece of linen, upon which the scribe had transcribed selections--both text and pictures--from The Book of the going forth by Day: in such cases the roll containing the whole work was placed between the legs. The body was further wrapped in several bandages, then in a second piece of stuff, "]]]
