A motet of Kuhnau's was given at Zittau under his direction. After the death of Titius, Kuhnau resided for a time in the house of J.J. von Hartig, judge at Zittau. In 1682 he went to Leipzig, where D. Scherzer endeavoured to obtain for him the post of organist at St. Thomas'; Kühnel, however, was appointed. The latter died in 1684, and was succeeded by Kuhnau, who in 1700 also became cantor of St. Thomas'. He devoted much of his time to jurisprudence. Among other things, he wrote a curious satire, entitled _Der musikalische Quacksalber_, published in 1700. There remain in manuscript, _Tractatus de tetrachordo_ and _Introductio ad compositionem musicalem_. Kuhnau had many pupils; we know of two who afterwards became distinguished men. The one was Christoph Graupner (1683-1760), who in 1710 became capellmeister at Darmstadt. In 1722, on the death of Kuhnau, Graupner,[39] who had been prize scholar under him, presented his testimonials, was examined, and seemed likely to become cantor as his teacher's successor. Meanwhile, however, John Sebastian Bach offered himself as candidate, and as Dr. Pepusch before Handel at Cannons in 1710, so did Graupner retire before his great rival. Mattheson, in his _Ehren-Pforte_ (p. 410), tells us that \"as a composer for the clavier, Graupner may rank as one of the best of his time.\" He wrote suites and sonatas for clavier. Johann Friedrich Fasch (1688-1758 or 9), the second pupil, soon after leaving Leipzig, where he had enjoyed Kuhnau's instruction from 1701-7, went to Italy, and on his return studied for a short time with Graupner. Fasch then filled various posts, until in 1722 (the very year indeed of Kuhnau's death) he became capellmeister at Anhalt Zerbst, where he remained until his death. His son, Carl Friedrich Christian, was the founder of the Berlin _Singakademie_. In 1756 Emanuel Bach had something to do with Fasch's appointment as clavecinist to Frederick the Great. The father, who was then seventy years of age, and who, like old Sebastian Bach, lived with the fear of God before his eyes, opposed the wish of his son to enter the service of the infidel king. Emanuel, who wished the younger Fasch to come to Berlin, wrote to the father to say \"that in the land over which Frederick the Great ruled, one could believe what one liked; that the king himself was certainly not religious, but on that very account esteemed everyone alike.\" Bach offered to take young Fasch into his house, and to preserve him as much as possible from temptation. With regard to Graupner, it would be interesting to know whether in any of his sonatas (the autographs of which are, we believe, at Darmstadt) he worked at all on Kuhnau's lines. And with regard to Fasch, one would like to know whether he ever conversed with Emanuel Bach about his father, who taught him theory, and about Johann Kuhnau, his father's renowned teacher. It is from such by-paths of history that one sometimes learns more than from statements showing how son descended from sire, and how pupils were directly influenced by their teachers.  But it is as a musician that we are now concerned with Kuhnau, and, in the first place, as the composer of the earliest known sonata for the clavier. In 1695 he published at Leipzig--  \"Sieben Partien aus dem Re, Mi, Fa, oder Terzia minore eines jedweden Toni, benebenst einer _Sonata_ aus dem B. Denen Liebhabern dieses Instrumenten zu gar besondern Vergnügen aufgesetzet.\" That is--  Seven Partitas based on the Re, Mi, Fa, or minor third of each mode, together with a Sonata in B flat, for the especial gratification of lovers of this instrument.  With respect to this sonata, Kuhnau remarks in his preface: \"I have added at the end a Sonata in B flat, which will please amateurs; for why should not such things be attempted on the clavier as well as on other instruments?\" In such modest fashion was ushered into the world the first sonata for clavier, or, at any rate, the earliest with which we are acquainted.[40]  Mattheson, in _Das neu eröffnete Orchester_ (1713), speaks about the _revival_ of clavier sonatas, so that it is not quite certain whether that B flat Sonata was actually the first.[41] During the seventeenth century, sonatas were written for various instruments, with a figured bass for the cembalo.  It will, of course, be interesting to trace the influences acting upon Kuhnau. They were of two kinds: the one, Italian; the other, German. Corelli deserves first mention; and next, the Italian organist and composer, Vincenzo Albrici,[42] capellmeister to the Elector of Saxony from 1664-88, and afterwards organist of St. Thomas', Leipzig, who is known to have encouraged Kuhnau when young, and to have helped him to learn the Italian language. But German influence must also have been strong. Of Froberger special mention will be made later on. There was one man, Diderich Becker, who published sonatas for violins and bass already in 1668, and these, if we mistake not, must have been well known to Kuhnau. Apart from the character of the music, the title of the work, _Musikalische Frülings Früchte_, and the religious style of the preface, remind one of Kuhnau's \"Frische Früchte,\" also of his preface to the \"Bible\" Sonatas. It is curious to find the quaint expression \"unintelligent birds\" used first by Becker, and afterwards by Kuhnau.  Let us describe briefly the above-mentioned B flat Sonata. The first movement is in common time, but the composer gave it no heading. It is generally supposed (Becker, Rimbault, Pauer) to be an Allegro; _moderato_ might well be added, for the stately, Handelian-like (the anachronism must be excused) music will scarcely bear a rapid _tempo_. The movement opens with an eight-bar phrase, closing on the dominant. Then the music, evolved from previous material, passes rapidly through various related keys. After this modulation section there is a cadence to F major, and in this, the dominant key, something like a new subject appears, though it is closely allied to the first. A return is soon made to the principal key, but there is no repetition of the opening theme. After a cadence ending on the tonic (B flat), and two coda-like bars, comes a fugal movement, still in the same key. The vigorous subject, the well-contrasted counterpoint, the interesting episodes, and many attractive details help one to forget the monotony of key so prevalent in the days in which this sonata was written. This, and indeed other fugues of Kuhnau show strong foreshadowings of Handel and Bach; of this matter, however, more anon. The counterpoint to the third entry of the subject is evolved from the opening subject of the sonata. The third movement consists of a fine Adagio in E flat, in the key of the subdominant and in three-four time. Then follows a short Allegro in three-four time, of polyphonic character. At the close of the movement Kuhnau has written the opening chords of the first movement with the words _Da Capo_. A similar indication is to be found in one of the \"Frische Früchte\" Sonatas. This repetition, also the third movement leading directly to the fourth, and the thematic connection mentioned above, would seem to show that the composer regarded the various sections of his sonata as parts of a whole.  In addition, Kuhnau wrote thirteen sonatas. The \"Frische Clavier Früchte,\" or \"Sieben Suonaten von guter Invention u. Manier auf dem Clavier zu spielen,\" were published in 1696, and later editions in 1710 and 1724. In a quaint preface the composer tells us that in naming his \"Fresh Fruits\" \"sonatas,\" he kept in mind all kinds of _inventiones_ and changes (Veränderungen) by which so-called sonatas are superior to mere partitas. Already a century before this preface was written, Praetorius had distinguished between two classes of instrumental music: the one, grave; the other, gay. The composer has also a word to say about the graces or ornaments, the \"sugar which sweetens the fruits.\" In modern reprints of Kuhnau the sugar is sometimes forgotten.[43] These \"Frische Früchte\" were followed by six \"Bible\" Sonatas in 1700. The former, both as regards form and contents, are remarkable. Kuhnau was a man of deeper thought and loftier conception than Emanuel Bach, but he was fettered by fugal forms,[44] and was fighting against them much in the same spirit in which Beethoven, a century later, fought against sonata-form, in the most general sense of that term. Beethoven was not only the more gifted, but he profited by the experiments of his predecessors, and he enjoyed the advantage of a vastly improved technique; Haydn, Mozart, Clementi, and others were the stepping-stones by which he rose to higher things. Kuhnau's attempts at sonata writing were bold, often rugged; and his experiments in programme-music, extraordinary. The latter were soon forgotten, while the clever, clear-formed sonatas of Emanuel Bach served as a gratification to the age in which he lived, and as guides to the composers who followed him. The \"Frische Früchte,\" standing between Corelli and Emanuel Bach, are of interest. The fugal element is still strong; and we find, not so much the smooth style of Corelli as the vigorous style of Froberger and other composers of North Germany. In character of subject-matter and in form there is decided advance as compared with the B flat Sonata. Kuhnau still seems rather limited in figures, and therefore repeats himself;[45] then again his movements do not always show gradation of interest. Their order and number are, indeed, perplexing, and not always satisfactory. The 2nd Sonata, in D, for instance, commences with a fine Allegro, followed first by a short Adagio, commencing in the relative minor, and intermixed with short presto passages, and then by a lively movement in six-eight time. These three would form an admirable sonata, yet the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17074"],["title","The Pianoforte Sonata (#6)"],["body","does not end here. There is still another short Adagio, and a concluding movement; and in spite of some fine passages, these appendages form a decided anti-climax. Similar instances are to be found in the other sonatas.  Now for a few words concerning their form. Some of the opening movements (for instance, those of Nos. 1, 2) are practically based on fugue-form, with which, by the way, sonata-form is allied.  The first movement of No. 4, in C minor, is of interest, both in its resemblances to, and differences from, modern sonata-form. It has _four_ sections:--       _a._ Eleven bars, beginning and ending in C minor, and      containing a characteristic theme.       _b._ Eleven bars, beginning in E flat (_i.e._ relative major      of opening key) and closing in G minor (_i.e._ key of minor      dominant). It contains a theme rhythmically allied to the      principal theme. _This section is repeated._       _c._ Nine-and-a-half bars, opening in C minor, and passing      to, and closing in E flat. It contains imitative passages      evolved from the principal theme.       _d._ Exact repetition of first section, only with a close on      the major chord.  The last movement of the 6th Sonata, in B flat, offers a still more striking resemblance to sonata-form; the various sections are better balanced; the middle or development section (with its close strettos) is particularly noticeable; also the recapitulation, which is not literal, as in the above example. The slow movements--occasionally very short--follow no particular plan. The fugal element is always more or less present, but some of the other movements have somewhat of a suite character; No. 6, indeed, opens with a _Ciaccona_. There is a certain formality about Kuhnau's music, and, for reasons already mentioned, he is occasionally monotonous. But there is an independent spirit running through his sonatas, and a desire to escape from the trammels of tradition which are quite refreshing. And there is a nobility in the style and skill in the workmanship which remind us of the great Bach. There are, indeed, resemblances to Bach, also to Handel. Scheibe, in his _Critischer Musikus_, mentions Kuhnau, in conjunction with Keiser, Telemann, and Handel, as one of the greatest composers of the eighteenth century. The mention of Kuhnau together with Handel deserves note. The constant discoveries which are being made of Handel's indebtedness to other composers suggest the thought that perhaps Kuhnau was also laid under contribution. No one, we think, can hear the \"Bible\" Sonatas without coming to the conclusion that Handel was acquainted with the works of his illustrious predecessor. We will just place side by side three passages from the \"Bible\" Sonatas of Kuhnau with three from a harpsichord suite of Handel--  [Music illustration: \"Bible\" Sonata, No. 2. KUHNAU.]  [Music illustration: Collection I., Suite 7, Ouverture. HANDEL.]  [Music illustration: \"Bible\" Sonata, No. 6. KUHNAU.]  [Music illustration: Collection I., Suite 7, Passacaille. HANDEL.]  [Music illustration: \"Bible\" Sonata, No. 6. KUHNAU.]  [Music illustration: Collection I., Suite 7, Passacaille. HANDEL.]  It should be noticed that the three Handel quotations are all from the same suite. We do not mean to infer that the above passages from Handel are plagiarisms, but merely that the Kuhnau music was, unconsciously, in his mind when he wrote them.  C.F. Becker, in his _Hausmusik in Deutschland_, has suggested that these sonatas were known also to Mozart, and begs us to look on this picture, the opening of a Vivace movement in Kuhnau's 6th Sonata:--  [Music illustration]  and on this, from _The Magic Flute_:--  [Music illustration]  Faisst, however, justly observes that though the harmonic basis is the same in both, with Kuhnau the under-part is melody, whereas with Mozart it is the reverse. He also accuses Becker--and justly, as readers may see by turning to the passage in the _Zauberflöte_--of not having represented the passage quite honestly. Reminiscence hunters need to be very careful.  In these sonatas, as compared with the one in B flat, the thematic material is of greater importance; and so, too, in the slow movements the writing is simpler and more melodious.  The rapid rate at which they were composed deserves mention. Kuhnau seems to have had the ready pen of a Schubert. In the preface to these \"Frische Früchte\" he says: \"I wrote these seven sonatas straight off, though attending at the same time to my duties (he was _juris practicus_, also organist of St. Thomas'), so that each day one was completed. Thus, this work, which I commenced on the Monday of one week, was brought to an end by the Monday of the following week.\"  Kuhnau's second (and, so far as we know, last) set of sonatas bears the following title:--  Musikalische Vorstellung Einiger Biblischer Historien In 6 Sonaten Auf dem Klavier zu spielen Allen Liebhabern zum Vergnügen Verfüget von Johann Kuhnauen.  That is--  Musical Representation of some Bible Stories In 6 Sonatas To be performed on the Clavier For the gratification of amateurs Arranged by Johann Kuhnau.  Kuhnau was not the originator of programme-music. In the so-called _Queen Elizabeth Virginal Book_,[46] in the Fitzwilliam Library, there is a Fantasia by John Munday, who died 1630, in which there is given a description of weather both fair and foul. Again, Froberger, who died in 1667, is said to have been able, _on the clavier_, to describe incidents, ideas, and feelings; there is, indeed, in existence a battle-piece of his. And then Buxtehude (_d._ 1707) wrote a set of seven Suites for clavier, in which he is said to have represented the nature and characteristics of the planets; these are, unfortunately, lost. With Froberger's music, at any rate, Kuhnau was familiar. In a long preface to these Bible stories, the composer refers to the subject of programme-music. He reminds us how from ancient times musicians have tried to rival the masters of rhetoric, sculpture, and painting in terms of their own art. And he expressly refers to programme pieces, and even to sonatas by the \"distinguished Froberger[47] and other excellent composers.\" The essence of his long, elaborate, and, at times, somewhat confused argument (it must be remembered that he was discussing a very difficult subject; and, also, that he was the first to write about it) is as follows:--He believes music capable by itself of producing wonderful effects, but in special cases, requiring the assistance of words. Music, he tells us, can express sadness or joy; for that no words are necessary. When, however, some individual--as in his sonatas--is referred to, words become essential, _i.e._ if one is to distinguish between the lamentation of a sad Hezekiah, a weeping Peter, or a mourning Jeremiah. In other language, words are necessary to render the emotion definite. Kuhnau gives a quaint illustration of the absolute necessity of words in certain cases; and that illustration is of particular interest, inasmuch as it points to still earlier, and possibly, clavier sonatas. \"I remember,\" says our author, \"hearing a few years ago a sonata composed by a celebrated Chur-Fürst capellmeister, to which he had given the title, 'La Medica.' After--so far as I can recall--describing the whines of the patient and of his relations, the running of the latter to the doctor, the pouring forth of their sorrow, there came, finally, a Gigue, under which stood the words, 'The patient is progressing favourably, but has not quite recovered his health.' At this some mocked, and were of opinion that, had it been in his power, the author might well have depicted the joy at a perfect recovery. So far, however, as I could judge, there was good reason for adding words to the music. The sonata commenced in D minor; in the Gigue there was constant modulation towards G minor. At the final close, in D, the ear was not satisfied, and expected the closing cadence in G.\" In this wise was the partial recovery expressed in tones, and explained in words.  Except for the unmistakable seriousness of the author, this description might be taken as a joke, just as in one of the \"Bible\" Sonatas the deceit of Jacob is expressed by a deceptive cadence; but such extreme examples serve to emphasise the author's declaration that, at times, words are indispensable. Before noticing the sonatas themselves, one more quotation in reference to the same subject must be made from this interesting preface. The humblest scholar, Kuhnau tells us, knows the rule forbidding consecutive perfect consonances, and he speaks of certain strict _censores_ who expose the clumsiness of _musical poets_ who have refused to be bound by that rule. \"But,\" says Kuhnau, in lawyer-like language: \"_Cessante ratione prohibitionis cessat ipsa prohibitio_.\" The term _musical poets_ (the italics are ours) is a remarkable one; Kuhnau himself, of course, was one of them.  Philipp Spitta, in his _Life of J.S. Bach_, devotes one short paragraph to the Bible stories, and gives one or two brief quotations from the second; but they certainly deserve a longer notice.  The 1st Sonata is entitled \"The Fight between David and Goliath.\" It opens with a bold section, intended, as we learn from a superscription, to represent _the bravado of Goliath_. The giant's characteristic theme, on which the whole section is built, is as follows:--  [Music illustration]  Then follows a section in A minor. A Chorale represents the prayer to God of the terrified Israelites, while the palpitating quaver accompaniment stands for the terror which seized them at sight of the giant; the harmonies are very striking. This Chorale setting should be compared with one by Bach (Spitta's _Life of Bach_, English edition, vol. i. p. 216), said to owe its existence to the influence of Georg Böhm, organist at Lüneburg at the commencement of the eighteenth century. Next comes a little pastoral movement (C major, three-four time) expressive "]]]
