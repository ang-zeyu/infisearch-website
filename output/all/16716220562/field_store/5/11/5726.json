You have taken your time, _mes enfants_, in settling this greatest of all questions, but perhaps you have been wise.... I am very happy for you, my 'Toinette, for I feel that your future is in the keeping of a good and true man. There are all too few in the world, believe me!...  \"'Toinette, a friend awaits you in the drawing-room. Someone, I fear me, who will be none too pleased to hear this news, but that's as may be. Dacre Wynne is there, 'Toinette.\"  At the name a chill came over Merriton.  _Dacre Wynne!_ And here! Impossible, and yet the name was too uncommon for it to be a different person from the man who always seemed somehow to turn up wherever he, Merriton, might chance to be. Sort of a fateful affinity. Good friends and all that, but somehow the things he always wanted, Dacre Wynne had invariably come by just beforehand. There was much more than friendly rivalry in their acquaintanceship. And once, as mere youngsters of seventeen and eighteen, there had been a girl, _his_ girl, until Dacre came and took her with that masterful way of his. There was something brutally over-powering about Dacre, hard as granite, forceful, magnetic. To Nigel's young, clean, wholesome mind, little given to morbid imaginings as it was, it had almost seemed as if their two spirits were in some stifling stranglehold together, wrapt about and intertwined by a hand operating by means of some unknown medium. And now to find him here in his hour of happiness. Was this close, uncomfortable companionship of the spirit to be forced on him again? If Wynne were present he felt he would be powerless to avoid it.  \"Do you know Dacre Wynne?\" he asked, his voice betraying an emotion that was almost fear.  'Toinette Brellier glanced at her uncle, hesitated, and then murmured: \"Yes--I--do. I didn't know you did, Nigel. He never spoke of you. I--he--you see he wants me, too, Nigel, and I am almost afraid to tell him--about us. But I--I have to see him. Shall I tell him?\"  \"Of course. Poor chap, I am sorry for him. Yes, I know him, 'Toinette. But I cannot say we are friends. You see, I--Oh, well, it doesn't matter.\"  But how much Dacre Wynne was to matter to him, and to 'Toinette, and to the public, and to far away Scotland Yard, and to the man of mystery, Hamilton Cleek, not they--nor any one else--could possibly tell.  They went into the long, cool drawing room together, and came upon Dacre Wynne, clad in riding things, and looking, just as Nigel remembered he always looked, very bronzed and big and handsome in a heavy way. His back was toward them and his eyes were upon a photo of 'Toinette that stood on a carved secr√©taire. He wheeled at the sound of their footsteps and came forward, his face lighting with pleasure, his hand outstretched. Then he saw Merriton behind 'Toinette's tiny figure, and for a moment some of the pleasure went out of his eyes.  \"Hello,\" he said. \"However did you get to this part of the world? You always turn up like a bad penny.... What a time you've been 'Toinette!\"  Merriton greeted him pleasantly, and 'Toinette's radiant eyes smiled up into his bronzed face.  \"Have I?\" she said, with a little embarrassed laugh. \"Well, I have been out riding--with Nigel.\"  \"Oh, Nigel lives round here, does he?\" said Wynne, with a sarcastic laugh. \"Like it, old man?\"  \"Oh, I like it well enough,\" retorted Merriton. \"At any rate I'll be obliged to get used to it. I've said good-bye to India for keeps, Wynne. I'm settled here for good.\"  Wynne swung upon his heel at the tone of Merriton's voice, and his eyes narrowed. He stood almost a head taller than Nigel--who was by no means short--and was big and broad and heavy-chested. Merriton always felt at a disadvantage.  \"So? You are going to settle down to it altogether, then?\" said Wynne, with an odd note in his deep, booming voice. 'Toinette sent a quick, rather scared look into her lover's face. He smiled back as though to reassure her.  \"Yes,\" he said, a trifle defiantly. \"You see, Wynne, I've come into a place near here. I'm--I'm hoping to get married soon. 'Toinette and I, you know. She's done me the honour to promise to be my wife. Congratulate me, won't you?\"  It was like a blow full in the face to the other man. For a moment all the colour drained out of his bronzed cheeks and he went as white as death.  \"I--I--certainly congratulate you, with all my heart,\" he said, speaking in a strange, husky voice. \"Believe me, you're a luckier chap, Merriton, than you know. Quite the luckiest chap in the world.\"  He took out his handkerchief suddenly and blew his nose, and then wiped his forehead, which, Merriton noted, was damp with perspiration. Then he felt in his pockets and produced a cigarette.  \"I may smoke, 'Toinette? Thanks. I've had a long ride, and a hard one.... And so you two are going to get married, are you?\"  'Toinette's face, too, was rather pale. She smiled nervously, and instinctively her hand crept out and touched Merriton's sleeve. She could feel him stiffen suddenly, and saw how proudly he threw back his head.  \"Yes,\" said 'Toinette. \"We're going to be married, Dacre. And I am--oh, so happy! I know you cannot help being pleased--with that. And uncle, too. He seems delighted.\"  Wynne measured her with his eyes for a moment. Then he looked quickly away.  \"Well, Merriton, you've got your own back for little Rosie Deverill, haven't you? Remember how heart-broken you were at sixteen, when she turned her rather wayward affections to me? Now--the tables have turned. Well, I wish you luck. Think I'll be getting along. I've a good deal of work to do this evening, and I'll be shipping for Cairo, I hope, next week. That's what I came to see you about 'Toinette, but I'm afraid I am a little--late.\"  \"Cairo, Mr. Wynne?\" Brellier had entered the room and his voice held a note of surprise. \"We shall miss you--\"  \"Oh, you'll get on all right without me, my friend,\" returned Wynne with a grim smile, and a look that included all three of them in its mock amusement. \"I'm not quite so much wanted as I thought. Well, Nigel, I suppose you'll be giving a dinner, the proper 'stag' party, before you become a Benedict. Sorry I can't be here to join in the revels.\"  He put out his hand, Nigel took it, and wrung it with a heartiness and friendship that he had never before felt; but after all he had conquered! It was he Antoinette was going to marry. His heart was brimming over with pity for the man.  \"Look here,\" he said. \"Come and dine with me at the Towers before you go, Wynne, old man. We'll have a real bachelor party as you say. All the other chaps and you, just to give you a sort of send off. What about Tuesday? I won't have you say no.\"  For a moment a look of friendship came into Wynne's eyes. He gazed into Merriton's, and then returned the hand-grasp frankly. It was almost as though he understood this mute apology of Nigel's, and took it at its proper value.  \"Thanks, old boy. Very decent of you, I'm sure. Yes, I'd like to have a peep at the other chaps before I sail. Just for old times' sake. I've nothing special doing Tuesday that I can't put off. And so--I'll come. So long.\"  \"Good-bye,\" said Merriton, rather relieved at Wynne's attitude--and yet, in spite of himself, distrusting it.  \"Good-bye, 'Toinette.... It's really good-bye _this_ time. And I wish you all the happiness you deserve.\"  \"Thank you.\"  He looked into her eyes a moment, and then with a sudden sigh turned quickly away and went out of the room. Brellier strode after him and wrung his hand while the two that were left clung to each other in silence. It was as though an unseen, sinister presence had suddenly gone from the room. The tension was lifted, and they could breathe naturally again.  Standing together they heard the front door slam.     CHAPTER V  THE SPECTRE AT THE FEAST   Merriton, clad in his evening clothes and looking exceedingly handsome, stood by the smoking room door, with Tony West, short and thickset, wearing a suit that fitted badly and a collar which looked sizes too large for him (Merriton had long given up hope of making him visit a decent tailor) and waited for the sound of motor wheels which would announce the arrival of further guests.  It was the memorable Tuesday dinner, given in the first place for Dacre Wynne, as a sort of send off before he left for Cairo. In the second Merriton intended to break it gently to the other chaps that he was shortly to become a Benedict.  Lester Stark and Tony West, very loyal and proven friends of Nigel Merriton, had arrived the evening before. Dacre Wynne was coming down by the seven o'clock train, Dicky Fordyce, Reginald Lefroy--both fellow officers of Merriton's regiment, and home on leave from India--and mild old Dr. Bartholomew, whom everyone respected and few did not love, and who was in attendance at most of the bachelor spreads in London and out of it, as being a dry old body with a wit as fine as a rapier-thrust, and a fund of delicate, subtle humour, made up the little party.  The solemn front door bell of Merriton Towers clanged, and Borkins, very pompous and elegant, flung wide the door. Merriton saw Wynne's big, broad-shouldered figure swathed in the black evening cloak which he affected upon such occasions, and which became him mightily, and with an opera hat set at the correct angle upon his closely-clipped dark hair, step into the lighted hallway, and begin taking off his gloves.  Tony West's raspy voice chimed out a welcome, as Merriton went forward, his hand outstretched.  \"Hello, old man!\" said Tony. \"How goes it? Lookin' a bit white about the gills, aren't you, eh?... Whew! Merriton, old chap, that's my ribs, if you don't mind. I've no penchant for your bayonet-like elbow to go prodding into 'em!\"  Merriton raised an eyebrow, frowned heavily, and by every other method under the sun tried to make it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17180"],["title","The Riddle of the Frozen Flame (#5)"],["body"," to West that the topic was taboo. Wherefore West raised _his_ eyebrows, began to make a hasty exclamation, thought better of it, and then clapping his hand over his mouth broke into whistling the latest jazz tune, as though he had completely extricated both feet from the unfortunate mire he had planted them in--but with very little success.  Wynne was a frowning Hercules as he entered the pleasant smoke-filled room. Merriton's arm lay upon his sleeve, and he endured because he had to--that was all.  \"Hello!\" he said, to Lester Stark's rather half-hearted greeting--Lester Stark never had liked Dacre Wynne and they both knew it. \"You here as well? Merriton's giving me a send-off and no mistake. Gad! you chaps will be envying me this time next week, I'll swear! Out on the briny for a decently long trip; plenty of pretty women--on which I'm bankin' of course\"--he gave Merriton a sudden, searching look, \"and not a care in the world. And the white lights of Cairo starin' at me across the water. Some picture, isn't it?\"  \"You may keep it!\" said Tony West with a shudder. \"When you've smelled Cairo, Wynne, old boy, you'll come skulkin' home with your tail between your legs. A 'rose by any other name would smell as sweet,' but Cairo--parts of it mind you--well, Cairo's the stinkin'st rose I ever put my nose into, that's all!\"  \"There are some things which offend the nostrils more than--odours!\" threw back Wynne with a black look in Nigel's direction, and with a sort of slur in his voice that showed he had been drinking more than was good for him that night. \"I think I can endure the smells of Cairo after--other things. Eh, Nigel?\" He forced a laugh which was mirthless and unpleasant, and Merriton, with a quick glance into his friends' faces, saw that they too had seen. Wynne was in one of his \"devil\" humours, and all the fun and joking and merriment in the world would never get him out of it. His pity for the man suddenly died a natural death. The very evident fact that Wynne had been drinking rather heavily merely added a further distaste to it all. He wished heartily that he had never ventured upon this act of unwanted friendliness and given a dinner in his honour. Wynne was going to be the spectre at the feast, and it looked like being a poor sort of show after all.  \"Come, buck up, old chap!\" broke out Tony West, the irrepressible. \"Try to look a little less like a soured lemon, if you can! Or we'll begin to think that you've been and gone and done something you're sorry for, and are trying to work it off on us instead.\"  \"Hello, here's Doctor Johnson,\" as the venerable Bartholomew entered the room. \"How goes it to-night, sir? A fine night, what? Behold the king of the feast, his serene and mighty--oh extremely mighty!--highness Prince Dacre Wynne, world explorer and soon to be lord-high-sniffer of Cairo's smells! Don't envy him the task, do you?\"  He bowed with a flourish to the doctor who chuckled and his keen eyes, fringed with snow-white lashes, danced. He wore a rather long, extremely untidy beard, and his shirt-front as always was crumpled and worn. Anything more unlike a doctor it would be hard to imagine. But he was a clever one, nevertheless.  \"Well, my talkative young parrot,\" he greeted West affectionately, \"and how are you?... And who's party is this, anyhow? Yours or Merriton's? You seem to be putting yourself rather more to the fore than usual.\"  \"Well, I'll soon be goin' aft,\" retorted West with a wide grin. \"When old Nigel gets his innings. He's as chockful of news as an egg is of meat.\" West was one of the chosen few who had already heard of Nigel's engagement, and he was rather like a gossipy old woman--but his friends forgave it in him.  Merriton gave him a shove, and he fell back upon Wynne, emitting a portentous groan.  \"What the devil--?\" began that gentleman, in a testy voice.  Tony grinned.  \"Nigel was ever thus!\" he murmured, with uplifted eyes.  \"Shut up!\" thundered Stark, clapping a hand over West's mouth, and he subsided as the doorbell rang again, and Borkins ushered in Fordyce and Lefroy, two slim-hipped, dapper young gentlemen with the stamp of the army all over them. The party thus complete, Borkins gravely withdrew, and some fifteen minutes later the great gong in the hallway clanged out its summons. They streamed into the dining room, Doctor Bartholomew upon Tony West's fat little arm; Fordyce and Lefroy, side by side, hands in pockets and closely cropped heads nodding vigorously; Merriton and Lester Stark sauntering one slightly behind the other, and exchanging pleasantries as they went; and just in front of them, Dacre Wynne, solitary, huge, sinister, and overbearing.  Wynne sat in the seat of honour on Merriton's right. The rest sorted themselves out as they wished, and made a good deal of noise and fun about it, too. Down the length of the long, exquisitely decorated table Merriton looked at his guests and thought it wasn't going to be so dismal after all.  Champagne ran like water and spirits ran high. They joyfully toasted Wynne, and later on the news that Merriton imparted to them. In vain Dacre Wynne's low spirits were apparent. He must get over his grouch, that was all. Then once again the spirit of evil descended upon the gathering and it was Stark who precipitated its flight. \"By the way, Nigel,\" he asked suddenly, \"isn't there some ghost story or other pertaining to your district? Give us a recital of it, old boy. Walnuts and wine and ghost stories, you know, are just the right sort of thing after a dinner like this. Tony, switch off the lights. This old house of yours is the very place for ghosts. Now let us have it.\"  \"Hold on,\" Nigel remonstrated. \"Give me a chance to digest my dinner, and--dash it all, the thing's so deuced uncanny that it doesn't bear too much laughing at either!\"  \"Come along!\" Six voices echoed the cry. \"We're waiting, Nigel.\"  So Merriton had forthwith to oblige them. He, too, had had enough to drink--though drinking too heavily was not one of his vices--and his flushed face showed the excitement that burned within him.  \"Come over here by the window and see the thing for yourselves, and then you shall hear the story,\" he began enigmatically.  Nigel pushed back the heavy curtain and there, in the darkness without--it was getting on toward ten o'clock--gleamed and danced and flickered the little flames that had so often puzzled him, and filled his soul with a strange sort of supernatural fear. Against the blackness beyond they hung like a chain of diamonds irregularly strung, flickering incessantly.  Every man there, save one, and that one stood apart from the others like some giant bull who deigns not to run with the herd--gave an involuntary exclamation.  \"What a deuced pretty sight!\" remarked Fordyce, in his pleasant drawl. \"What is it? Some sort of fair or other? Didn't know you had such things in these parts.\"  \"We don't.\" It was Merriton who spoke, rather curtly, for the remark sounded inane to his ears.  \"It is no fair you ass, it's--God knows what! That's the point of the whole affair. What _are_ those flames, and where do they come from? That part of the Fens is uninhabited, a boggy, marshy, ghostly spot which no one in the whole countryside will cross at night. The story goes that those who do--well they never come back.\"  \"Oh, go easy, Nigel!\" struck in Tony West with a whistle of pretended astonishment. \"Champagne no doubt, but--\"  \"It's the truth according to the villagers, anyhow!\" returned Merriton, soberly. \"That is how the story goes, my lad, and you chaps asked me for it. Those Frozen Flames--it's the villagers' name, not mine--they say are supernatural phenomena, and any one, as I said before, crossing the place near them at night disappears clean off the face of the earth. Then a new flame appears, the soul of the johnny who has 'gone out'.\"  \"Any proof?\" inquired Doctor Bartholomew suddenly, stroking his beard, and arching his bushy eyebrows, as if trying to sympathize with his host's obvious half belief in the story.  Nigel wheeled and faced him in the dim light. The pupils of his eyes were a trifle dilated.  \"Yes, so I understand. Short time back a chap went out--fellow called Myers--Will Myers. He was a bit drunk, I think, and thought he'd have a shot at makin' the village busybodies sit up and give 'em something to talk about. Anyhow, he went.\"  \"And he came back?\" Unconsciously a little note of anxiety had crept into Tony West's voice.  \"No, on the contrary, he did _not_ come back. They searched for his body all over the marshes next day, but it had disappeared absolutely, and the chap who told me said he saw another light come out the next night, and join the rest of 'em.... There, there's your story, Lester, make what you like of it. I've done my bit and told it anyway.\"  For a moment there was silence. Then Stark shook himself.  \"Gad, what an uncanny story! Turn up the lights someone, and dispel this gloom that seems to have settled on everyone! What do you make of it?\"  Suddenly Wynne's great, bulky figure swung free from the shadows. There were red glints in his eyes and a sneer curled his heavy lips. He sucked his cigar and threw his head back.  \"What I make of it is a whole lot of old women's damn silly nonsense!\" he announced in a loud voice. \"And how a sensible, decent thinkin' man can give credence to the thing for one second beats me completely! Nigel's head was always full of imaginations (of a sort) but how you other chaps can listen to the thing--Well, all I can say is you're the rottenest lot of idiots I've ever come across!\"  Merriton shut his lips tightly for a moment, and tried hard to remember that this man was a guest in his house. It was so obvious that Wynne was trying for a row, Doctor Bartholomew turned round and lifted a protesting hand.  \"Don't you think your language is a trifle--er--overstrong, Wynne?\" he said, in that quiet voice of his which made all men listen and wonder why they did it.
