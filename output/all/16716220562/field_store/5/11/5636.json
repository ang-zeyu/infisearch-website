We shall find to our joy that this obscure-sounding Dithyramb, though before Aristotle's time it had taken literary form, was in origin a festival closely akin to those we have just been discussing. The Dithyramb was, to begin with, a spring ritual; and when Aristotle tells us tragedy arose out of the Dithyramb, he gives us, though perhaps half unconsciously, a clear instance of a splendid art that arose from the simplest of rites; he plants our theory of the connection of art with ritual firmly with its feet on historical ground.         *       *       *       *       *  When we use the word \"dithyrambic\" we certainly do not ordinarily think of spring. We say a style is \"dithyrambic\" when it is unmeasured, too ornate, impassioned, flowery. The Greeks themselves had forgotten that the word _Dithyramb_ meant a leaping, inspired dance. But they had not forgotten on what occasion that dance was danced. Pindar wrote a Dithyramb for the Dionysiac festival at Athens, and his song is full of springtime and flowers. He bids all the gods come to Athens to dance flower-crowned.       \"Look upon the dance, Olympians; send us the grace of Victory, ye      gods who come to the heart of our city, where many feet are      treading and incense steams: in sacred Athens come to the holy      centre-stone. Take your portion of garlands pansy-twined, libations      poured from the culling of spring....       \"Come hither to the god with ivy bound. Bromios we mortals name      Him, and Him of the mighty Voice.... The clear signs of his      Fulfilment are not hidden, whensoever the chamber of the      purple-robed Hours is opened, and nectarous flowers lead in the      fragrant spring. Then, then, are flung over the immortal Earth,      lovely petals of pansies, and roses are amid our hair; and voices      of song are loud among the pipes, the dancing-floors are loud with      the calling of crowned Semele.\"  Bromios, \"He of the loud cry,\" is a title of Dionysos. Semele is his mother, the Earth; we keep her name in Nova _Zembla_, \"New Earth.\" The song might have been sung at a \"Carrying-in of Summer.\" The Horæ, the Seasons, a chorus of maidens, lead in the figure of Spring, the Queen of the May, and they call to Mother Earth to wake, to rise up from the earth, flower-crowned.  You may _bring back_ the life of the Spring in the form of a tree or a maiden, or you may summon her to rise from the sleeping Earth. In Greek mythology we are most familiar with the Rising-up form. Persephone, the daughter of Demeter, is carried below the Earth, and rises up again year by year. On Greek vase-paintings[20] the scene occurs again and again. A mound of earth is represented, sometimes surmounted by a tree; out of the mound a woman's figure rises; and all about the mound are figures of dancing dæmons waiting to welcome her.  All this is not mere late poetry and art. It is the primitive art and poetry that come straight out of ritual, out of actual \"things done,\" _dromena_. In the village of Megara, near Athens, the very place where to-day on Easter Tuesday the hills are covered with throngs of dancing men, and specially women, Pausanias[21] saw near the City Hearth a rock called \"_Anaklethra_, 'Place of Calling-up,' because, if any one will believe it, when she was wandering in search of her daughter, Demeter called her up there\"; and he adds: \"The women to this day perform rites analogous to the story told.\"  These rites of \"Calling up\" must have been spring rites, in which, in some pantomimic dance, the uprising of the Earth Spirit was enacted.  Another festival of Uprising is perhaps more primitive and instructive, because it is near akin to the \"Carrying out of Winter,\" and also because it shows clearly the close connection of these rites with the food-supply. Plutarch[22] tells us of a festival held every nine years at Delphi. It was called from the name of the puppet used _Charila_, a word which originally meant Spring-Maiden, and is connected with the Russian word _yaro_, \"Spring,\" and is also akin to the Greek _Charis_, \"grace,\" in the sense of increase, \"Give us all _grace_.\" The rites of _Charila_, the Gracious One, the Spring-Maiden, were as follows:       \"The king presided and made a distribution in public of grain and      pulse to all, both citizens and strangers. And the child-image of      _Charila_ is brought in. When they had all received their share,      the king struck the image with his sandal, the leader of the      Thyiades lifted the image and took it away to a precipitous place,      and there tied a rope round the neck of the image and buried it.\"  Mr. Calderon has shown that very similar rites go on to-day in Bulgaria in honour of _Yarilo_, the Spring God.  The image is beaten, insulted, let down into some cleft or cave. It is clearly a \"Carrying out the Death,\" though we do not know the exact date at which it was celebrated. It had its sequel in another festival at Delphi called _Herois_, or the \"Heroine.\" Plutarch[23] says it was too mystical and secret to describe, but he lets us know the main gist.       \"Most of the ceremonies of the _Herois_ have a mystical reason      which is known to the Thyiades, but from the rites that are done in      public, one may conjecture it to be a 'Bringing up of Semele.'\"  Some one or something, a real woman, or more likely the buried puppet _Charila_, the Spring-Maiden, was brought up from the ground to enact and magically induce the coming of Spring.         *       *       *       *       *  These ceremonies of beating, driving out, burying, have all, with the Greeks, as with the savage and the modern peasant, but one real object: to get rid of the season that is bad for food, to bring in and revive the new supply. This comes out very clearly in a ceremony that went on down to Plutarch's time, and he tells us[24] it was \"ancestral.\" It was called \"the Driving out of Ox-hunger.\" By Ox-hunger was meant any great ravenous hunger, and the very intensity and monstrosity of the word takes us back to days when famine was a grim reality. When Plutarch was _archon_ he had, as chief official, to perform the ceremony at the Prytaneion, or Common Hearth. A slave was taken, beaten with rods of a magical plant, and driven out of doors to the words: \"Out with Ox-hunger! In with Wealth and Health!\" Here we see the actual sensation, or emotion, of ravenous hunger gets a name, and thereby a personality, though a less completely abstracted one than Death or Summer. We do not know that the ceremony of Driving out Ox-hunger was performed in the spring, it is only instanced here because, more plainly even than the Charila, when the king distributes pulse and peas, it shows the relation of ancient mimic ritual to food-supply.  If we keep clearly in mind the _object_ rather than the exact _date_ of the Spring Song we shall avoid many difficulties. A Dithyramb was sung at Delphi through the winter months, which at first seems odd. But we must remember that among agricultural peoples the performance of magical ceremonies to promote fertility and the food supply may begin at any moment after the earth is ploughed and the seed sown. The sowing of the seed is its death and burial; \"that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die.\" When the death and burial are once accomplished the hope of resurrection and new birth begins, and with the hope the magical ceremonies that may help to fulfil that hope. The Sun is new-born in midwinter, at the solstice, and our \"New\" year follows, yet it is in the spring that, to this day, we keep our great resurrection festival.         *       *       *       *       *  We return to our argument, holding steadily in our minds this connection. The Dithyramb is a Spring Song at a Spring Festival, and the importance of the Spring Festival is that it magically promotes the food-supply.         *       *       *       *       *  Do we know any more about the Dithyramb? Happily yes, and the next point is as curious as significant.  Pindar, in one of his Odes, asks a strange question:      \"Whence did appear the Graces of Dionysos,     With the Bull-driving Dithyramb?\"  Scholars have broken their own heads and one another's to find a meaning and an answer to the odd query. It is only quite lately that they have come at all to see that the Dithyramb was a Spring Song, a primitive rite. Formerly it was considered to be a rather elaborate form of lyric poetry invented comparatively late. But, even allowing it is the Spring Song, are we much further? Why should the Dithyramb be bull-driving? How can driving a Bull help the spring to come? And, above all, what are the \"slender-ankled\" Graces doing, helping to drive the great unwieldy Bull?  The difficulty about the Graces, or Charites, as the Greeks called them, is soon settled. They are the Seasons, or \"Hours,\" and the chief Season, or Hour, was Spring herself. They are called Charites, or Graces, because they are, in the words of the Collect, the \"Givers of all grace,\" that is, of all increase physical and spiritual. But why do they want to come driving in a Bull? It is easy to see why the Givers of all grace lead the Dithyramb, the Spring Song; their coming, with their \"fruits in due season\" is the very gist of the Dithyramb; but why is the Dithyramb \"bull-driving\"? Is this a mere \"poetical\" epithet? If it is, it is not particularly poetical.  But Pindar is not, we now know, merely being \"poetical,\" which amounts, according to some scholars, to meaning anything or nothing. He is describing, alluding to, an actual rite or _dromenon_ in which a Bull is summoned and driven to come in spring. About that we must be clear. Plutarch, the first anthropologist, wrote a little treatise called _Greek Questions_, in which he tells us all the strange out-of-the-way rites and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17089"],["title","The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: Mrs. Tittlemouse & Bees]     THE TALE OF MRS.

Printed and bound in Great Britain by William Clowes Limited, Beccles and London    NELLIE'S LITTLE BOOK  [Illustration: Mrs. Tittlemouse at the Door]  Once upon a time there was a wood-mouse, and her name was Mrs. Tittlemouse.  She lived in a bank under a hedge.  Such a funny house! There were yards and yards of sandy passages, leading to storerooms and nut-cellars and seed-cellars, all amongst the roots of the hedge.  [Illustration: In the pantry]  [Illustration: In bed]  There was a kitchen, a parlour, a pantry, and a larder.  Also, there was Mrs. Tittlemouse's bedroom, where she slept in a little box bed!  Mrs. Tittlemouse was a most terribly tidy particular little mouse, always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors.  Sometimes a beetle lost its way in the passages.  \"Shuh! shuh! little dirty feet!\" said Mrs. Tittlemouse, clattering her dust-pan.  [Illustration: Shooing a beetle]  [Illustration: A ladybird]  And one day a little old woman ran up and down in a red spotty cloak.  \"Your house is on fire, Mother Ladybird! Fly away home to your children!\"  Another day, a big fat spider came in to shelter from the rain.  \"Beg pardon, is this not Miss Muffet's?\"  \"Go away, you bold bad spider! Leaving ends of cobweb all over my nice clean house!\"  [Illustration: Spider]  [Illustration: Out the window]  She bundled the spider out at a window.  He let himself down the hedge with a long thin bit of string.  Mrs. Tittlemouse went on her way to a distant storeroom, to fetch cherry-stones and thistle-down seed for dinner.  All along the passage she sniffed, and looked at the floor.  \"I smell a smell of honey; is it the cowslips outside, in the hedge? I am sure I can see the marks of little dirty feet.\"  [Illustration: Marks of little feet]  [Illustration: Babbitty Bumble]  Suddenly round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble--\"Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!\" said the bumble bee.  Mrs. Tittlemouse looked at her severely. She wished that she had a broom.  \"Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I should be glad to buy some beeswax. But what are you doing down here? Why do you always come in at a window, and say Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz?\" Mrs. Tittlemouse began to get cross.  \"Zizz, Wizz, Wizzz!\" replied Babbitty Bumble in a peevish squeak. She sidled down a passage, and disappeared into a storeroom which had been used for acorns.  Mrs. Tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before Christmas; the storeroom ought to have been empty.  But it was full of untidy dry moss.  [Illustration: Full of moss]  [Illustration: Bees nest]  Mrs. Tittlemouse began to pull out the moss. Three or four other bees put their heads out, and buzzed fiercely.  \"I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion!\" said Mrs. Tittlemouse. \"I will have them turned out--\" \"Buzz! Buzz! Buzzz!\"--\"I wonder who would help me?\" \"Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!\"  --\"I will not have Mr. Jackson; he never wipes his feet.\"  Mrs. Tittlemouse decided to leave the bees till after dinner.  When she got back to the parlour, she heard some one coughing in a fat voice; and there sat Mr. Jackson himself!  He was sitting all over a small rocking-chair, twiddling his thumbs and smiling, with his feet on the fender.  He lived in a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch.  [Illustration: Mr. Jackson]  [Illustration: Sitting and dripping]  \"How do you do, Mr. Jackson? Deary me, you have got very wet!\"  \"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! I'll sit awhile and dry myself,\" said Mr. Jackson.  He sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails. Mrs. Tittlemouse went round with a mop.  He sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some dinner?  First she offered him cherry-stones. \"Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! No teeth, no teeth, no teeth!\" said Mr. Jackson.  He opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide; he certainly had not a tooth in his head.  [Illustration: Feeding Mr. Jackson]  [Illustration: Thistledown]  Then she offered him thistle-down seed--\"Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Pouff, pouff, puff!\" said Mr. Jackson. He blew the thistle-down all over the room.  \"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! Now what I really--_really_ should like--would be a little dish of honey!\"  \"I am afraid I have not got any, Mr. Jackson,\" said Mrs. Tittlemouse.  \"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!\" said the smiling Mr. Jackson, \"I can _smell_ it; that is why I came to call.\"  Mr. Jackson rose ponderously from the table, and began to look into the cupboards.  Mrs. Tittlemouse followed him with a dish-cloth, to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlour floor.  [Illustration: Wiping up footmarks]  [Illustration: Walking down the passage]  When he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards, he began to walk down the passage.  \"Indeed, indeed, you will stick fast, Mr. Jackson!\"  \"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!\"  First he squeezed into the pantry.  \"Tiddly, widdly, widdly? no honey? no honey, Mrs. Tittlemouse?\"  There were three creepy-crawly people hiding in the plate-rack. Two of them got away; but the littlest one he caught.  [Illustration: Creepy-crawly people]  [Illustration: Butterfly tasting the sugar]  Then he squeezed into the larder. Miss Butterfly was tasting the sugar; but she flew away out of the window.  \"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse; you seem to have plenty of visitors!\"  \"And without any invitation!\" said Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse.  They went along the sandy passage--\"Tiddly widdly--\" \"Buzz! Wizz! Wizz!\"  He met Babbitty round a corner, and snapped her up, and put her down again.  \"I do not like bumble bees. They are all over bristles,\" said Mr. Jackson, wiping his mouth with his coat-sleeve.  \"Get out, you nasty old toad!\" shrieked Babbitty Bumble.  \"I shall go distracted!\" scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse.  [Illustration: Confronting the Bee]  [Illustration: Shut into the nut-cellar]  She shut herself up in the nut-cellar while Mr. Jackson pulled out the bees-nest. He seemed to have no objection to stings.  When Mrs. Tittlemouse ventured to come out--everybody had gone away.  But the untidiness was something dreadful--\"Never did I see such a mess--smears of honey; and moss, and thistledown--and marks of big and little dirty feet--all over my nice clean house!\"  She gathered up the moss and the remains of the beeswax.  Then she went out and fetched some twigs, to partly close up the front door.  \"I will make it too small for Mr. Jackson!\"  [Illustration: Closing up the front door]  [Illustration: Too tired]  She fetched soft soap, and flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from the storeroom. But she was too tired to do any more. First she fell asleep in her chair, and then she went to bed.  \"Will it ever be tidy again?\" said poor Mrs. Tittlemouse.  Next morning she got up very early and began a spring cleaning which lasted a fortnight.  She swept, and scrubbed, and dusted; and she rubbed up the furniture with beeswax, and polished her little tin spoons.  [Illustration: Polishing]  When it was all beautifully neat and clean, she gave a party to five other little mice, without Mr. Jackson.  He smelt the party and came up the bank, but he could not squeeze in at the door.  [Illustration: The party]  [Illustration: Honey-dew through the window]  So they handed him out acorn-cupfuls of honey-dew through the window, and he was not at all offended.  He sat outside in the sun, and said--\"Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Your very good health, Mrs. Tittlemouse!\"   THE END         *       *       *       *       *  Transcriber's Note: Punctuation normalized and captions added to illustrations."]]]
