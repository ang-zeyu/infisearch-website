Few men live on the plane of their highest efficiency. Few search the recesses of the well-springs of power. The lives of most of us are passed among the shallows of the mind without thought of the possibilities that lurk within the deeper pools.  [Sidenote: _How the Mind Accumulates Energy_]  This accumulation of potential subconscious reserve energy is a result of the evolution of man and the growing complexity of his life.  No man could, if he would, respond to all the impulses to muscular action aroused in him by sense-impressions. It would be still less possible for him to respond to every impulse to muscular action awakened from the past with the remembered thought with which it is associated.  Desire, interest, attention and the selective will must pick and choose among these multitudinous tendencies to action.  Here, then, is another fact that has immediate bearing upon your ability to carry out any ambition you may have. Your every action is the net result of selection among a number of impulses and inhibitory forces or tendencies.  [Sidenote: _The Threshold of Inhibition_]  As a general thing, consciousness is made up of a number of conflicting ideas, each with its associated feeling and its impulse to action. Just what you do in any particular case depends upon what mental picture is strongest, is most vivid in consciousness, and thus able to overcome all contrary tendencies.  As life becomes more and more complex, the number and variety of our sensory experiences increase correspondingly. And so it comes about, that _we have untold millions of sensory experiences, carrying with them the impulses to muscular response, none of which, on account of the multiplicity of conflicting ideas, is ever allowed to find release and actually take form in muscular activity_.  [Sidenote: _Hidden Strength_]  The consequence is that only an exceedingly small proportion of the mental energy that is developed within us is ever actually displayed. _The rest is somehow and somewhere locked up behind the inhibitory threshold._ It is stored away in _subconsciousness_ with the sensory experiences of the past with which it is associated.  [Sidenote: _Giving a Man Scope_]  Quoting Mr. Waldo P. Warren: \"Much of the strength within men is hidden, awaiting an occasion to reveal it. The head of a department in a great manufacturing concern severed his connection with the firm, his work falling upon a young man of twenty-five years. The young man rose to the occasion, and in a very short time was conceded to be the stronger executive of the two. He had been with the concern for several years, and was regarded as a bright fellow, but his marked success was a surprise to all who knew him--even to himself.  \"The fact is, the young man had that ability all the time and didn't know it; and his employers didn't know it. He might have been doing greater things all along if there had been the occasion to reveal his strength.  \"Do you employers and superior officers in business realize how much of this hidden strength there is in your men? Perhaps a word from you, giving certain men more scope, would liberate that ability for the development of both your business and your men.  \"Do you workers know your own strength? Are you working up to your capacity? Or are you accepting the limits which the circumstances place about you?\"     CHAPTER III  THE INITIATIVE ENERGY OF SUCCESS   [Sidenote: _Sources of Persistence_]  In such instances as we have recounted, men have found that persistent effort along certain lines has had the effect of making presently available what would otherwise be simply unused storage batteries of reserve power. What was the source and inspiration for this persistent effort?  You will say that it was ambition or patriotism or some similar semi-emotional influence. And so it was. But what is ambition, what is patriotism, _what is any desire but a picturing to the mind's eye of the things desired, an awakening of a mental image_ of the result to be attained, the reward that is to follow certain efforts? And these mental pictures coming into consciousness have brought with them their associated emotions and their associated impulses to muscular action, impulses appropriate to the picture _and automatically tending to work its realization_.  These impulses constitute the whole of man's achieving power. They are the Initiative Energy of all Success.  [Sidenote: _Importance of the Mental Setting_]  When you are afflicted with doubt and fear, timidity and lack of confidence, this means that your mental inhibitions are too numerous, too high or too strong. Remove them and access is had to the latent energy of accumulated and creative thought complexes. You will then become buoyant, cheerful, overflowing with enthusiasm, and ready for a fresh, definite, active part in life.  _Ideas, then, when latent, may be considered as possessing an energizing influence_.  The same idea does not necessarily have the same effect upon the same persons at different times. What its effect may be at any time or with any individual depends upon the make-up of the consciousness in which it finds itself.  [Sidenote: _Ideas All Men Respond to_]  The setting of consciousness may be entirely different upon the present appearance of the particular idea from what it was on the occasion when this same idea last appeared. Yesterday there may have been present no conflicting tendencies, and this particular idea may therefore have been allowed free and joyous expression. Today other thoughts may be in the ascendency so that we look upon the idea of yesterday with a feeling of revulsion.  The thought that aroused new energy in you yesterday may then sicken you at your task today. The thought that stirs the soul of a vigorous man may shock the sensibilities of a delicate woman.  [Sidenote: _How to Exalt the Personality_]  Yet there are some ideas to which all men in varying degrees seem alike to respond. How often in battle have the failing spirits of an army been revived by the appearance of the leader shouting his battle-cry and waving his shining sword! How often have men been roused to heights of heroic achievement by the strains of martial music! How often have troops spent with exhaustion responded to the call of such simple phrases as \"The Flag,\" \"Our Country,\" \"Liberty,\" or such songs as \"The Marseillaise,\" \"God Save the King,\" \"Dixie\"! These phrases are but the signs of ideas, yet the sounding of these phrases has summoned these ideas into consciousness, and the summoning of these ideas into consciousness has placed undreamed-of and immeasurable foot-pounds of energy on the hair-trigger of action.  [Sidenote: _\"Good Starters\" and \"Strong Finishers\"_]  And so it is with you. Down deep in the inmost chambers of your soul are untouched stores of energy that properly applied will exalt your personality and illumine your career.  But to find and claim these hidden riches you must persevere. You must endure.  In a Marathon race it is endurance that wins. The graceful sprinter who is off with a leap at the bark of the pistol soon falls by the wayside.  Life is a Marathon in which persistence triumphs.  There are many \"good starters,\" but few \"strong finishers.\" That is why the failures so outnumber the successes.  [Sidenote: _Steps in Self-Development_]  The man who travels fastest does more than he is told to do. To merely comply with a fixed routine is to fall short of one's duty. The progressive man adds to the work of today his preparation for the work of tomorrow. He delights in attempting more and more difficult tasks, because in every task he sets himself he sees a step forward in the development of his own abilities. He loves his work more than he loves his pay, and he delves deeper than the exigencies of the moment require, because he craves the power to do more.  Most men start with enthusiasm. No hours are too long, no task too difficult. But soon they tire. And lacking will-power to persist, they succumb to the lure of distracting interests. They become disheartened and indifferent. And so they fail.  [Sidenote: _Saving a Thousand a Year_]  A young man married. He was proprietor of a flourishing \"general\" store in Princeton, Indiana. He and his bride forthwith resolved that they could and would lay aside out of their income a thousand dollars a year for ten years, by which time they would have ten thousand dollars and accumulated interest and could go into business in a big city. At the end of the first year, when they took stock of their savings, they decided that thereafter, instead of trying to save a thousand dollars a year for ten years, they would undertake to save ten dollars a year for a thousand years and would be more apt to succeed. Today they are just where they began.  You all know such men--men who are always starting and never finishing.  [Sidenote: _Looking for a \"Soft Snap\"_]  Ninety-five per cent of the men who go into business are \"quitters.\" The very first disappointment sends them scurrying to cover. They begin to look for a \"soft snap\" away from the firing line. Is it any wonder that so few reach any great success?  That there is an enormous lack of appropriation of energy in most men's lives is an undoubted fact. Just where this energy is stored, and just what its eternal significance may be, is immaterial to our purpose.  It may be that this reserve is Nature's safeguard against our extravagance.  It may be, as some philosophers contend, that the subconscious, with its vast stores of energy, is a higher, more spiritual phase of man.  [Sidenote: _Drawing Power from on High_]  It may be that the subconscious is for each one of us his individual segment of the Divine Essence--tha"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17334"],["title","Initiative Psychic Energy (#3)"],["body","it marks our \"at-one-ment\" with God.  It may be that to evoke these latent energies is to call upon those resources of our being which are the embodiment within us of the spirit of the Creator of all things.  It may be that this Divine Essence, if adequately aroused, may exert an absolute transcendence over material things and lift humanity to a God-like plane.  \"What we call man,\" wrote Emerson, \"the eating, drinking, planting, counting man, does not, as we know him, represent himself, but misrepresents himself. Him we do not respect; but the real soul whose organ he is, would he let it appear through his action, would make our knees bend.\" \"I said, ye are gods,\" quoth the Psalmist. \"Be ye perfect, even as your Father,\" was the injunction of the Master.  Whatever the eternal significance of your latent energy may be, the fact remains that it is yours, and yours to use.  If you are to succeed, if you are to do big things, you must be a man of \"doggedness.\" You must keep your eyes trained everlastingly upon the vision of the thing you want. You must stay in the race until you get your \"second wind.\" You must be master of yourself and draw freely on your stored-up powers.  [Sidenote: _The Man Who Lasts_]  Do as we shall tell you in this _Course_ and you will become a master man, the kind of man who \"lasts,\" the kind of man who works his imagination overtime, the kind of man who can strain his energies to the utmost and then, finding himself still a failure, can rise \"like the glow of the sun\" to do bolder and bigger things--the kind of man who wins.     CHAPTER IV  HOW TO AVOID WASTES THAT DRAIN THE ENERGY OF SUCCESS   [Sidenote: _Speeding the Bullet Without Aiming_]  We have shown you that you have within you the potentialities of success in the form of latent mental energy. We have shown you that your ability to achieve depends upon your ability to utilize to the full your underground mental resources.  But success demands that you do more than merely use all your mental energies. You must use them intelligently.  [Sidenote: _Why Most Men Fail_]  Most men fail because they speed the bullet without aiming. They fire at random, and so bag no game.  Your pent-up mental energy is the powder in the cartridge. Its usefulness depends upon the man behind the gun.  _To succeed in business you must intelligently control and direct_ (1) _your own mental energies_, (2) _the mental energies of others._  The course of the average man through life is an aimless zigzag. It has neither direction nor purpose. It represents wasted energy capriciously expended.  Mental energy is like water: it has a tendency to scatter. It is diffusive. It seeks release in a thousand different directions at the same time.  As a boy, first learning to write, you were unable to prevent the simultaneous squirming of tongue and legs, all ludicrously irrelevant to your purpose of writing. So now, as a business man, unless you have learned the secret of self-mastery, you are unable to concentrate your efforts, your attention is easily distracted, you exhaust yourself in displays of passion, you are forever doing things during business hours that have no relation to your business, you are forever doing things in connection with your business that do not contribute to its progress, you expend just as much energy as the accomplished executive or the successful \"hustler,\" but you fritter it away in unprofitable activities.  [Sidenote: _The Successful Promoter_]  To correct this is to gain mastery and power.  Concentrate your mental energies on one thing at a time. Stop spreading them around. The promoter may have a dozen big enterprises under way at once, but he takes them up one at a time. He transfers his whole mind and thought from one to the next. You cannot of course be eternally doing the same thing; but make no mistake about it, the only way to succeed at anything is to consciously control your mental energies. You may throw them now into this attack, now into another; but you must always have a tight grip on yourself, or you cannot succeed.  [Sidenote: _The Human Dynamo_]  You will often hear some \"live-wire\" business man spoken of as a \"human dynamo.\" He has the faculty of turning out a stupendous amount of work in a comparatively short time. How he can carry in his mind the details of so many large projects, how he can accomplish so much in actual, tangible results in many directions, how he can pull the strings of so many enterprises without getting lost in the maze of detail, is the marvel of his associates. And yet this man is never \"hurried, nor flurried, nor worried.\" But every word and every act is straight to the point and productive of results worth while.  [Sidenote: _Cool Brains and Hot Boxes_]  \"A cool brain is the reverse of a hot box. It carries the business of the day along with a steady drive, and is invariably the mark of the big man. The man who dispatches his work quietly, promptly and efficiently, with no trace of fuss and flurry, is a big man. It is not the hurrying, clattering and chattering individual who turns off the most work. He may imagine he is getting over a lot of track, but he wastes far more than the necessary amount of steam in doing it. The fable of the hare and the tortoise would not be a bad primer for a number of us, and the lesson relearned would not only be beneficial in a business-producing way, but it would help us in the full enjoyment of our work.\"  [Sidenote: _Marvelous Increased Efficiency Handling \"Pig\"_]  Progress in mental efficiency must result from the application of knowledge of the mental machine. Just as we watch the steam-engine and the electric motor to see that they are not \"overloaded,\" so we must watch the mental machine, that no more power be turned on than can be profitably employed.  This principle has already been applied to physical labor by Mr. Frederick W. Taylor in his ground-breaking studies in \"scientific management.\" Mr. Taylor's celebrated experiments in the handling of pig-iron, by which the quantity handled in a day by one man was increased from twelve and one-half tons to forty-seven and one-half tons, \"showed that a man engaged in such extremely heavy work could only be under load forty-three per cent of the working day, and must be entirely free from load for fifty-seven per cent, to attain the maximum efficiency.\"  [Sidenote: _\"Overloaded\" Human Engines_]  There is no reason why efficiency in mental effort should not be gauged just as accurately as in muscular activity. If there are times when your wits are not as keen, when you have not the same grasp of fundamentals, as at other times, it is because you are mentally \"overloaded.\" It may be the result of a great variety of causes. It may be from too many hours of continuous mental effort. But the probabilities are that it is the result of vexation, worry, dissipation, or allowing the mind to be burdened with the strain of vicious, or at least irrelevant and distracting, impulses and desires. And so efficiency is lost.  [Sidenote: _Scientific Management of Self_]  The \"human dynamo\" is a man who long ago learned the lesson of scientific management of his own mental forces. He does one thing at a time, and does it the best he knows how. He directs the whole power of his mentality to the one problem and solves it with accuracy and dispatch. There is no more of a \"load\" on his \"gray matter\" than there is on that of the fretting, fuming, finger-biting fritterer, but every pound of steam is spent in useful work.  Look at the victim of St. Vitus' dance. There you have an illustration of wasted energy. And it is mental energy, for every muscular movement represents the release of thought power. The mental lives of most men are equally aimless. They are lives of ceaseless activity producing nothing.  [Sidenote: _Psychological Causes of Waste_]  Sometimes it happens that a man is not working to advantage because of some defect in his physical make-up. He may have defective vision or some peculiarity of hearing that renders him unable to respond as quickly as he should to the demands made upon him. If these defects are ascertained, it is usually a simple matter to correct the defects by mechanical means or readjust the relative duties of different persons so that the defects will be minimized.  [Sidenote: _Tests for Sensory Defects_]  Where large numbers of people are employed, it is comparatively easy to use tests for discovering defects of sight or hearing by simple apparatus without requiring the services of a high-priced expert. By adopting these test methods any manager of a large industrial establishment can satisfy himself whether his employees are up to certain normal standards. He can even apply the tests to himself.  Optical tests can be conducted by securing an ordinary letter chart such as is used by oculists and opticians. Seat the subject twenty feet away. If he can read all the lines of letters from the largest down to the smallest his eyesight is practically perfect. In a large percentage of cases the smaller lines of type are blurred and invisible. To detect the cause and degree of defects of the eyes it is necessary to try out the eyes by using a trial spectacle frame and inserting detached lenses before the right eye and the left eye alternately. One of the most common forms of defective vision is astigmatism. A chart has been designed with a series of circles and straight lines radiating from the center. If the subject is astigmatic he will see some of the straight lines distinctly while others will be blurred. For instance, one or two of the vertical lines may appear very black and strong while all others will look like a hazy network. This defect, due to unevenness of the spherical surface of the eyeball, is easily corrected with properly ground glasses.  Defects in hearing can be easily determined by means of an \"acoumeter.\" This little instrument measures the acuteness of the hearing very accurately by"]]]
