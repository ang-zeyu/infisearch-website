The water thence makes its way between two cliffs of perpendicular rock, the ravine being in several places so narrow that the branches of the trees on the opposite sides interlace, and an active man could readily leap across it. Near Yakhmur some detached rocks appear to have been arrested in their fall, and, leaning like flying buttresses against the mountain face, constitute a natural bridge over the torrent. The basins of the two rivers lie in one valley, extending eighty leagues in length, divided by an almost imperceptible watershed into two beds of unequal slope. The central part of the valley is given up to marshes. It is only towards the south that we find cornfields, vineyards, plantations of mulberry and olive trees, spread out over the plain, or disposed in terraces on the hillsides. Towards the north, the alluvial deposits of, the Orontes have gradually formed a black and fertile soil, upon which grow luxuriant crops of cereals and other produce. Cole-Syria, after having generously nourished the Oriental empires which had preyed upon her, became one of the granaries of the Roman world, under the capable rule of the Cæsars.  Syria is surrounded on all sides by countries of varying aspect and soil. That to the north, flanked by the Amanos, is a gloomy mountainous region, with its greatest elevation on the seaboard: it slopes gradually towards the interior, spreading out into chalky table-lands, dotted over with bare and rounded hills, and seamed with tortuous valleys which open out to the Euphrates, the Orontes, or the desert. Vast, slightly undulating plains succeed the table-lands: the soil is dry and stony, the streams are few in number and contain but little water. The Sajur flows into the Euphrates, the Afrîn and the Karasu when united yield their tribute to the Orontes, while the others for the most part pour their waters into enclosed basins. The Khalus of the Greeks sluggishly pursues its course southward, and after reluctantly leaving the gardens of Aleppo, finally loses itself on the borders of the desert in a small salt lake full of islets: about halfway between the Khalus and the Euphrates a second salt lake receives the Nahr ed-Dahab, the golden river. The climate is mild, and the temperature tolerably uniform. The sea-breeze which rises every afternoon tempers the summer heat: the cold in winter is never piercing, except when the south wind blows which comes from the mountains, and the snow rarely lies on the ground for more than twenty-four hours. It seldom rains during the autumn and winter months, but frequent showers fall in the early days of spring. Vegetation then awakes again, and the soil lends itself to cultivation in the hollows of the valleys and on the table-lands wherever irrigation is possible. The ancients dotted these now all but desert spaces with wells and cisterns; they intersected them with canals, and covered them with farms and villages, with fortresses and populous cities. Primæval forests clothed the slopes of the Amanos, and pinewood from this region was famous both at Babylon and in the towns of Lower Chaldæa. The plains produced barley and wheat in enormous quantities, the vine throve there, the gardens teemed with flowers and fruit, and pistachio and olive trees grew on every slope. The desert was always threatening to invade the plain, and gained rapidly upon it whenever a prolonged war disturbed cultivation, or when the negligence of the inhabitants slackened the work of defence: beyond the lakes and salt marshes it had obtained a secure hold. At the present time the greater part of the country between the Orontes and the Euphrates is nothing but a rocky table-land, ridged with low hills and dotted over with some impoverished oases, excepting at the foot of Anti-Lebanon, where two rivers, fed by innumerable streams, have served to create a garden of marvellous beauty. The Barada, dashing from cascade to cascade, flows for some distance through gorges before emerging on the plain: scarcely has it reached level ground than it widens out, divides, and forms around Damascus a miniature delta, into which a thousand interlacing channels carry refreshment and fertility. Below the town these streams rejoin the river, which, after having flowed merrily along for a days journey, is swallowed up in a kind of elongated chasm from whence it never again emerges. At the melting of the snows a regular lake is formed here, whose blue waters are surrounded by wide grassy margins like a sapphire set in emeralds. This lake dries up almost completely in summer, and is converted into swampy meadows, filled with gigantic rushes, among which the birds build their nests, and multiply as unmolested as in the marshes of Chaldæa. The Awaj, unfed by any tributary, fills a second deeper though smaller basin, while to the south two other lesser depressions receive the waters of the Anti-Lebanon and the Hauran. Syria is protected from the encroachments of the desert by a continuous barrier of pools and beds of reeds: towards the east the space reclaimed resembles a verdant promontory thrust boldly out into an ocean of sand. The extent of the cultivated area is limited on the west by the narrow strip of rock and clay which forms the littoral. From the mouth of the Litâny to that of the Orontes, the coast presents a rugged, precipitous, and inhospitable appearance. There are no ports, and merely a few ill-protected harbours, or narrow beaches lying under formidable headlands. One river, the Nahr el-Kebir, which elsewhere would not attract the travellers attention, is here noticeable as being the only stream whose waters flow constantly and with tolerable regularity; the others, the Leon, the Adonis,* and the Nahr el-Kelb,* can scarcely even be called torrents, being precipitated as it were in one leap from the Lebanon to the Mediterranean. Olives, vines, and corn cover the maritime plain, while in ancient times the heights were clothed with impenetrable forests of oak, pine, larch, cypress, spruce, and cedar. The mountain range drops in altitude towards the centre of the country and becomes merely a line of low hills, connecting Gebel Ansarieh with the Lebanon proper; beyond the latter it continues without interruption, till at length, above the narrow Phoenician coast road, it rises in the form of an almost insurmountable wall. Near to the termination of Coele-Syria, but separated from it by a range of hills, there opens out on the western slopes of Hermon a valley unlike any other in the world. At this point the surface of the earth has been rent in prehistoric times by volcanic action, leaving a chasm which has never since closed up. A river, unique in character--the Jordan--flows down this gigantic crevasse, fertilizing the valley formed by it from end to end.***       * The Adonis of classical authors is now Nahr-Ibrahim. We      have as yet no direct evidence as to the Phoenician name of      this river; it was probably identical with that of the      divinity worshipped on its banks. The fact of a river      bearing the name of a god is not surprising: the Belos, in      the neighbourhood of Acre, affords us a parallel case to the      Adonis.       ** The present Nahr el-Kelb is the Lykos of classical      authors. The Due de Luynes thought he recognized a      corruption of the Phoenician name in that of Alcobile, which      is mentioned hereabouts in the Itinerary of the pilgrim of      Bordeaux. The order of the Itinerary does not favour this      identification, and Alcobile is probably Jebail: it is none      the less probable that the original name of the Nahr el Kelb      contained from earliest times the Phoenician equivalent of      the Arab word _kelb_, dog.       *** The Jordan is mentioned in the Egyptian texts under the      name of Yorduna: the name appears to mean _the descender,      the down-flowing._  Its principal source is at Tell el-Qadi, where it rises out of a basaltic mound whose summit is crowned by the ruins of Laish.*       * This source is mentioned by Josephus as being that of the      Little Jordan.  [Illustration: 014.jpg THE MOST NORTHERN SOURCE OF THE JORDAN, THE NAIIR-EL-HASBANY]       Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by the Duc de Luynes.  The water collects in an oval rocky basin hidden by bushes, and flows down among the brushwood to join the Nahr el-Hasbany, which brings the waters of the upper torrents to swell its stream; a little lower down it mingles with the Banias branch, and winds for some time amidst desolate marshy meadows before disappearing in the thick beds of rushes bordering Lake Huleh.*       * Lake Huleh is called the Waters of Merom, Mê-Merom, in the      Book of Joshua, xi. 5, 7; and Lake Sammochonitis in      Josephus. The name of Ulatha, which was given to the      surrounding country, shows that the modern word Huleh is      derived from an ancient form, of which unfortunately the      original has not come down to us.  [Illustration 014b.jpg LAKE OF GENESARATH]  At this point the Jordan reaches the level of the Mediterranean, but instead of maintaining it, the river makes a sudden drop on leaving the lake, cutting for itself a deeply grooved channel. It has a fall of some 300 feet before reaching the Lake of Grenesareth, where it is only momentarily arrested, as if to gather fresh strength for its headlong career southwards.  [Illustration: 017.jpg ONE OF THE REACHES OF THE JORDAN]       Drawn by Boudier, from several photographs brought back by      Lortet.  Here and there it makes furious assaults on its right and left banks, as if to escape from its bed, but the rocky escarpments which hem it in present an insurmountable barrier to it; from rapid to rapid it descends with such capricious windings that it covers a course of more than 62 miles before reaching, the Dead Sea, nearly 1300 feet below the level of the Mediterranean.*       * The exact figures are: the Lake of Hûleh 7"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17324"],["title","History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 4 (of 12) (#2)"],["body","above the      Mediterranean; the Lake of Genesareth 68245 feet, and the      Dead Sea 1292 feet below the sea-level; to the south of      the Dead Sea, towards the water-parting of the Akabah, the      ground is over 720 feet higher than the level of the Red      Sea.

Nothing could offer more striking contrasts than the country on either bank. On the east, the ground rises abruptly to a height of about 3000 feet, resembling a natural rampart flanked with towers and bastions: behind this extends an immense table-land, slightly undulating and intersected in all directions by the affluents of the Jordan and the Dead Sea--the Yarmuk,* the Jabbok,** and the Arnon.***       * The Yarmuk does not occur in the Bible, but we meet with      its name in the Talmud, and the Greeks adopted it under the      form Hieromax.       ** _Gen._ xxxii. 22; Numb, xxi. 24.

[Shephelah = low country, plain (Josh. xi. 16).      With the article it means the plain along the Mediterranean      from Joppa to Gaza.--Te.]  The whole of this district forms a little world in itself, whose inhabitants, half shepherds, half bandits, live a life of isolation, with no ambition to take part in general history. West of the Jordan, a confused mass of hills rises into sight, their sparsely covered slopes affording an impoverished soil for the cultivation of corn, vines, and olives. One ridge--Mount Carmel--detached from the principal chain near the southern end of the Lake of Genesareth, runs obliquely to the north-west, and finally projects into the sea. North of this range extends Galilee, abounding in refreshing streams and fertile fields; while to the south, the country falls naturally into three parallel zones--the littoral, composed alternately of dunes and marshes--an expanse of plain, a Shephelah, dotted about with woods and watered by intermittent rivers,--and finally the mountains. The region of dunes is not necessarily barren, and the towns situated in it--Gaza, Jaffa, Ashdod, and Ascalon--are surrounded by flourishing orchards and gardens. The plain yields plentiful harvests every year, the ground needing no manure and very little labour. The higher ground and the hill-tops are sometimes covered with verdure, but as they advance southwards, they become denuded and burnt by the sun. The valleys, too, are watered only by springs, which are dried up for the most part during the summer, and the soil, parched by the continuous heat, can scarcely be distinguished from the desert. In fact, till the Sinaitic Peninsula and the frontiers of Egypt are reached, the eye merely encounters desolate and almost uninhabited solitudes, devastated by winter torrents, and overshadowed by the volcanic summits of Mount Seir. The spring rains, however, cause an early crop of vegetation to spring up, which for a few weeks furnishes the flocks of the nomad tribes with food.  We may summarise the physical characteristics of Syria by saying that Nature has divided the country into five or six regions of unequal area, isolated by rivers and mountains, each one of which, however, is admirably suited to become the seat of a separate independent state. In the north, we have the country of the two rivers--the Naharaim--extending from the Orontes to the Euphrates and the Balikh, or even as far as the Khabur:* in the centre, between the two ranges of the Lebanon, lie Coele-Syria and its two unequal neighbours, Aram of Damascus and Phoenicia; while to the south is the varied collection of provinces bordering the valley of the Jordan.       * The Naharaim of the Egyptians was first identified with      Mesopotamia; it was located between the Orontes and the      Balikh or the Euphrates by Maspero. This opinion is now      adopted by the majority of Egyptologists, with slight      differences in detail. Ed. Meyer has accurately compared the      Egyptian Naharaim with the Parapotamia of the administration      of the Seleucidæ.  It is impossible at the present day to assert, with any approach to accuracy, what peoples inhabited these different regions towards the fourth millennium before our era. Wherever excavations are made, relics are brought to light of a very ancient semi-civilization, in which we find stone weapons and implements, besides pottery, often elegant in contour, but for the most part coarse in texture and execution. These remains, however, are not accompanied by any monument of definite characteristics, and they yield no information with regard to the origin or affinities of the tribes who fashioned them.* The study of the geographical nomenclature in use about the XVIth century B.C. reveals the existence, at all events at that period, of several peoples and several languages. The mountains, rivers, towns, and fortresses in Palestine and Coele-Syria are designated by words of Semitic origin: it is easy to detect, even in the hieroglyphic disguise which they bear on the Egyptian geographical lists, names familiar to us in Hebrew or Assyrian.       * Researches with regard to the primitive inhabitants of      Syria and their remains have not as yet been prosecuted to      any extent. The caves noticed by Hedenborg at Ant-Elias,      near Tripoli, and by Botta at Nahr el-Kelb, and at Adlun by      the Duc de Luynes, have been successively explored by      Lartet, Tristram, Lortet, and Dawson. The grottoes of      Palestine proper, at Bethzur, at Gilgal near Jericho, and at      Tibneh, have been the subject of keen controversy ever since      their discovery. The Abbé Richard desired to identify the      flints of Gilgal and Tibneh with the stone knives used by      Joshua for the circumcision of the Israelites after the      passage of the Jordan (_Josh._ v- 2-9), some of which might      have been buried in that heros tomb.  But once across the Orontes, other forms present themselves which reveal no affinities to these languages, but are apparently connected with one or other of the dialects of Asia Minor.* The tenacity with which the place-names, once given, cling to the soil, leads us to believe that a certain number at least of those we know in Syria were in use there long before they were noted down by the Egyptians, and that they must have been heirlooms from very early peoples. As they take a Semitic or non-Semitic form according to their geographical position, we may conclude that the centre and south were colonized by Semites, and the north by the immigrant tribes from beyond the Taurus. Facts are not wanting to support this conclusion, and they prove that it is not so entirely arbitrary as we might be inclined to believe. The Asiatic visitors who, under a king of the XIIth dynasty, came to offer gifts to Khnûmhotpû, the Lord of Beni-Hasan, are completely Semitic in type, and closely resemble the Bedouins of the present day. Their chief--Abisha--bears a Semitic name,** as too does the Sheikh Ammianshi, with whom Sinûhit took refuge.***       * The non-Semitic origin of the names of a number of towns      in Northern Syria preserved in the Egyptian lists, is      admitted by the majority of scholars who have studied the      question.       ** His name has been shown to be cognate with the Hebrew      Abishai (1 Sam. xxvi. 6-9; 2 Sam. ii. 18, 24; xxi. 17) and      with the Chaldæo-Assyrian Abeshukh.       *** The name Ammianshi at once recalls those of Ammisatana,      Ammiza-dugga, and perhaps Ammurabi, or Khammurabi, of one of      the Babylonian dynasties; it contains, with the element      Ammi, a final _anshi_. Chabas connects it with two Hebrew      words _Am-nesh_, which he does not translate.  Ammianshi himself reigned over the province of Kadimâ, a word which in Semitic denotes the East. Finally, the only one of their gods known to us, Hadad, was a Semite deity, who presided over the atmosphere, and whom we find later on ruling over the destinies of Damascus. Peoples of Semitic speech and religion must, indeed, have already occupied the greater part of that region on the shores of the Mediterranean which we find still in their possession many centuries later, at the time of the Egyptian conquest.

When, however, the lords of the sands grew too insolent, the Pharaoh sent a column of light troops against them, and inflicted on them such a severe punishment, that the remembrance of it kept them within bounds for years. Offenders banished from Egypt sought refuge with the turbulent kinglets, who were in a perpetual state of unrest between Sinai and the Dead Sea. Egyptian sailors used to set out to traffic along the seaboard, taking to piracy when hard pressed; Egyptian merchants were accustomed to penetrate by easy stages into the interior. The accounts they gave of their journeys were not reassuring. The traveller had first to face the solitudes which confronted him before reaching the Isthmus, and then to avoid as best he might the attacks of the pillaging tribes who inhabited it.
