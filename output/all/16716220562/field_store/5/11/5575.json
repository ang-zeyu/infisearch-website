In my unhappiness I went to ask counsel and advice of Mr. Caldwell, the manager of the chief New Orleans theatre, He at once said to me, \"You ought to be an actress, and not a singer.\" He advised me to study some parts, and presented me to Mr. Barton, the tragedian of the theatre, whom he asked to hear me, and to take an interest in me.  He was very kind, as indeed they both were; and Mr. Barton, after a short time, was sufficiently impressed with my powers to propose to Mr. Caldwell that I should act Lady Macbeth to his Macbeth, on the occasion of his (Barton's) benefit.  Upon this is was decided that I should give up singing and take to acting.  My contract with Mr. Maeder was annulled, it being the end of the season.  So enraptured was I with the idea of acting this part, and so fearful of anything preventing me, that I did not tell the manager I had no dresses, until it was too late for me to be prevented from acting it; and the day before the performance, after rehearsal, I told him.  He immediately sat down and wrote a note of introduction for me to the tragedienne of the French Theatre, which then employed some of the best among French artists for its company.  This note was to ask her to help me to costumes for the role of Lady Macbeth, I was a tall, thin, lanky girl at that time, about five feet six inches in height.  The Frenchwoman, Madame Closel, was a short, fat person of not more than four feet ten inches, her waist full twice the size of mine, with a very large bust; but her shape did not prevent her being a very great actress.  The ludicrousness of her clothes being made to fit me struck her at once. She roared with laughter; but she was very good-natured, saw my distress, and set to work to see to how she could help it.  By dint of piecing out the skirt of one dress it was made to answer for an underskirt, and then another dress was taken in in every direction to do duty as an overdress, and so make up the costume.  And thus I essayed for the first time the part of Lady Macbeth, fortunately to the satisfaction of the audience, the manager, and all the members of the company.    TO A YOUNG ACTRESS [PART OF A LETTER]  ...  I should advise you to get to work; all ideal study of acting, without the trial or opportunity of trying our efforts and conceivings upon others, is, in my mind, lost time.  Study while you act.  Your conception of character can be formed while you read your part, and only practice can tell you whether you are right.  You would, after a year of study in your own room, come out unbenefited, save in as far as self-communion ever must make us better and stronger; but this is not what you want just now.  Action is needed.  Your vitality must in some measure work itself off.  You must suffer, labour, and wait, before you will be able to grasp the true and the beautiful.  You dream of it now; the intensity of life that is in you, the spirit of poetry which makes itself heard by you in indistinct language, needs work to relieve itself and be made clear.  I feel diffident about giving advice to you, for you know your own nature better than any one else can, but I should say to you, get to work in the best way you can.  All your country work will be wretched; you will faint by the way; but you must rouse your great strength and struggle on, bearing patiently your cross on the way to your crown!  God bless you and prosper your undertakings.  I know the country theatres well enough to know how utterly alone you will be in such companies; but keep up a good heart; we have only to do well what is given us to do, to find heaven.  I think if you have to wait for a while it will do you no harm.  You seem to me quite frantic for immediate work; but teach yourself quiet and repose in the time you are waiting.  With half your strength I could bear to wait and labour with myself to conquer fretting.  The greatest power in the world is shown in conquest over self.  More life will be worked out of you by fretting than all the stage-playing in the world.  God bless you, my poor child.  You have indeed troubles enough; but you have a strong and earnest spirit, and you have the true religion of labour in your heart.  Therefore I have no fears for you, let what will come.  Let me hear from you at your leisure, and be sure you have no warmer friend than I am and wish to be,...  I was exceedingly pleased to hear such an account of your first appearance.  You were quite right in all that was done, and I am rejoiced at your success.  Go on; persevere.  You will be sure to do what is right, for your heart is in the right place, your head is sound, your reading has been good.  Your mind is so much better and stronger than any other person's whom I have known enter the profession, that your career is plain before you.  But I will advise you to remain in your own native town for a season, or at least the winter.  You say you are afraid of remaining among people who know you.  Don't have this feeling at all.  You will have to be more particular in what you do, and the very feeling that you cannot be indifferent to your audience will make you take more pains. Beside this, you will be at home, which is much better for a time; for then at first you do not have to contend with a strange home as well as with a strange profession.  I could talk to you a volume upon this matter, but it is difficult to write.  At all events I hope you will take my counsel and remain at home this winter.  It is the most wretched thing imaginable to go from home a novice into such a theatre as any of those in the principal towns.  Only go on and work hard, and you will be sure to make a good position.  With regard to your faults, what shall I say?  Why, that you will try hard to overcome them.  I don't think they would be perceived save by those who perhaps imagine that your attachment for me has induced you to join the profession.  I have no mannerisms, I hope; therefore any imitation of me can only be in the earnest desire to do what you can do, as well as you can.  Write to me often; ask of me what you will; my counsel is worth little, but you shall command it if you need it.    TO A YOUNG MOTHER  [FROM A LETTER]  ...  All that you say about your finding your own best expression in and through the little life which is confided to you is good and true, and I am so happy to see how you feel on the subject.  I think a mother who devotes herself to her child, in watching its culture and keeping it from baleful influences, is educating and cultivating herself at the same time.  No artist work is so high, so noble, so grand, so enduring, so important for all time, as the making of character in a child, You have your own work to do, the largest possible expression.  No statue, no painting, no acting, can reach it, and it embodies each and all the arts, Clay of God's fashioning is given into your hands to mould to perfectness.  Is this not something grand to think of?  No matter about yourself--only make yourself worthy of God's sacred trust, and you will be doing His work--and that is all that human beings ought to care to live for.  Am I right?    EARLY GRIEFS.  ART HER ONLY SPOUSE  [FROM A LETTER TO A FRIEND]  There was a time, in my life of girlhood, when I thought I had been called upon to bear the very hardest thing that can come to a Woman. A very short time served to show me, in the harder battle of life Which was before me, that this had been but a spring storm, which was simply to help me to a clearer, better, richer, and more productive summer.  If I had been spared this early trial, I should never have been so earnest and faithful in my art; I should have still been casting about for the \"counterpart,\" and not given my entire self to my work, wherein and alone I have reached any excellence I have ever attained, and through which alone I have received my reward.  God helped me in my art isolation, and rewarded me for recognising him and helping myself.  This passed on; and this happened at a period in my life when most women (or children, rather) are looking to but one end in life--an end no doubt wisest and best for the largest number, but which would not have been wisest and best for my work, and so for God's work, for I know he does not fail to set me his work to do, and helps me to do it, and helps others to help me.  (Do you see this tracing back, and then forward, to an eternity of good, and do you see how better and better one can become in recognising one's self as a minister of the Almighty to faithfully carry out our part of His great plan according to our strength and ability?)  0 believe we cannot live one moment for ourselves, one moment of selfish repining, and not be failing him at that moment, hiding the God-spark in us, letting the flesh conquer the spirit, the evil dominate the good.  Then after this first spring storm and hurricane of young disappointment came a lull--during which I actively pursued what became a passion,--my art.  Then I lost my younger brother, upon whom I had begun to build most hopefully, as I had reason.  He was by far the cleverest of my mother's children.  He had been born into greater poverty than the others; he received his young impressions through a different atmosphere; he was keener, more artistic, more impulsive, more generous, more full of genius.  I lost him by a cruel accident, and again the world seem to liquefy beneath my feet, and the waters went over my soul.  It became necessary that I should suffer bodily to cure my heart-bleed.  I placed myself professionally where I found and knew all my mortifications in my profession, which seemed for the time to strew ashes over the loss of my child-brother (for he was my child, and loved me best in all the world), thus conquering my art, which, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1702"],["title","Little Masterpieces of Autobiography: Actors (#7)"],["body","knows, has never failed me--never failed to bring me rich reward--never failed to bring me comfort.  I conquered my grief and myself.  Labour saved me then and always, and so I proved the eternal goodness of God.  I digress too much; but you will see how, in looking back to my own early disappointments, I can recognise all the good which came out of them, and can ask you to lay away all repinings with our darling, and hope (as we must) in God's wisdom and goodness, and ask him to help us to a clearer vision and truer knowledge of his dealings with us; to teach us to believe that we are lifted up to him better through our losses than our gains.  May it not be that heaven is nearer, the passage from earth less hard, and life less seductive to us, in consequence of the painless passing of this cherub to its true home, lent us but for a moment, to show how pure must be our lives to fit us for such companionship?  And thus, although in one sense it would be well for us to put away the sadness of this thought if it would be likely to enervate us, in another sense, if we consider it rightly, if we look upon it worthily, we have an angel in God's house to help us to higher and purer thinkings, to nobler aspirations, to more sublime sacrifices than we have ever known before.    FAREWELL TO NEW YORK  [In 1874 Miss Cushman bade farewell to New York at Booth's Theatre, after a performance as Lady Macbeth.  William Cullen Bryant presented an ode in her honour.  In the course of her response Miss Cushman said:]  Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks, but I thank you. Gentlemen, the heart has no speech; its only language is a tear or a pressure of the hand, and words very feebly convey or interpret its emotions.  Yet I would beg you to believe that in the three little words I now speak, 'I thank you,' there are heart depths which I should fail to express better, though I should use a thousand other words.  I thank you, gentlemen, for the great honour you have offered me.  I thank you, not only for myself, but for my whole profession, to which, through and by me, you have paid this very grateful compliment. If the few words I am about to say savour of egotism or vainglory, you will, I am sure, pardon me, inasmuch as I am here only to speak of myself.  You would seem to compliment me upon an honourable life.  As I look back upon that life, it seems to me that it would have been impossible for me to have led any other.  In this I have, perhaps, been mercifully helped more than are many of my more beautiful sisters in art.  I was, by a press of circumstances, thrown at an early age into a profession for which I had received no special education or training; but I had already, though so young, been brought face to face with necessity.  I found life sadly real and intensely earnest, and in my ignorance of other ways of study, I resolved to take therefrom my text and my watchword.  To be thoroughly in earnest, intensely in earnest in all my thoughts and in all my actions, whether in my profession or out of it, became my one single idea.  And I honestly believe herein lies the secret of my success in life.  I do not believe that any great success in any art can he achieved without it....    CLARA MORRIS  [Clara Morris, Mrs. Frederick C. Harriott, is a native of Toronto, Canada.  Her remarkable powers as an emotional actress, early in evidence, gave her for years the foremost place at Daly's Theatre, and the Union Square Theatre, New York.  Among the parts in which she achieved distinction were Camille, Alixe, Miss Multon, Corn in \"Article 47,\" and Mercy Merrick in \"The New Magdalen.\"  Since her retirement from the stage Clara Morris has proved herself to be a capital writer, shedding the light of experience on the difficulties of dramatic success.  One of her books, \"Life on the Stage,\" copyright, 1901, by Clara Morris Harriott and the S. S. McClure Company, New York, by permission, has furnished this episode.--Ed.]    SOME RECOLLECTIONS OF JOHN WILKES BOOTH  In glancing back over two crowded and busy seasons, one figure stands out with clearness and beauty.  In his case only (so far as my personal knowledge goes), there was nothing derogatory to dignity or to manhood in being called beautiful, for he was that bud of splendid promise blasted to the core, before its full triumphant blooming--known to the world as a madman and an assassin, but to the profession as \"that unhappy boy\"--John Wilkes Booth.  He was so young, so bright, so gay--so kind.  I could not have known him well; of course, too--there are two or three different people in every man's skin; yet when we remember that stars are not generally in the habit of showing their brightest, their best side to the company at rehearsal, we cannot help feeling both respect and liking for the one who does.  There are not many men who can receive a gash over the eye in a scene at night, without at least a momentary outburst of temper; but when the combat between Richard and Richmond was being rehearsed, Mr. Booth had again and again urged Mr. McCollom (that six-foot tall and handsome leading-man, who entrusted me with the care of his watch during such encounters) to come on hard! to come on hot! hot, old fellow! harder-faster!   He'd take the chance of a blow--if only they could make a hot fight of it!  And Mr. McCollom, who was a cold man, at night became nervous in his effort to act like a fiery one--he forgot he had struck the full number of head blows, and when Booth was pantingly expecting  a thrust, McCollom, wielding his sword with both hands, brought it down with awful force fair across Booth's forehead; a cry of horror rose, for in one moment his face was masked in blood, one eyebrow was cleanly cut through--there came simultaneously one deep groan from Richard and the exclamation:  \"Oh, good God! good God!\" from Richmond, who stood shaking like a leaf and staring at his work.  Then Booth, flinging the blood from his eyes with his left hand, said as genially as man could speak: \" That's all right, old man! never mind me--only come on hard, for God's sake, and save the fight!\"  Which be resumed at once, and though he was perceptibly weakened, it required the sharp order of Mr. Ellsler, to \"ring the first curtain bell,\" to force him to bring the fight to a close a single blow shorter than usual.  Then there was a running to and fro, with ice and vinegar-paper and raw steak and raw oysters.  When the doctor had placed a few stitches where they were most required, he laughingly declared there was provision enough in the room to start a restaurant. Mr. McCollom came to try to apologise--to explain, but Booth would have none of it; be held out his hand, crying:  \"Why, old fellow, you look as if you had lost the blood.  Don't worry--now if my eye had gone, that would have been bad!\"  And so with light words he tried to set the unfortunate man at ease, and though he must have suffered much mortification as well as pain from the eye--that in spite of all endeavours would blacken--he never made a sign.  He was, like his great elder brother, rather lacking in height, but his head and throat, and the manner of their rising from his shoulders, were truly beautiful, His colouring was unusual--the ivory pallor of his skin, the inky blackness of his densely thick hair, the heavy lids of his glowing eyes were all Oriental, and they gave a touch of mystery to his face when it fell into gravity--but there was generally a flash of white teeth behind his silky moustache, and a laugh in his eyes.  I played the Player-Queen to my great joy, and in the \"Marble Heart\" I was one of the group of three statues in the first act.  We were supposed to represent Lais, Aspasia, and Phryne, and when we read the cast I glanced at the other girls (we were not strikingly handsome) and remarked, gravely:  \"Well, it's a comfort to know that we look so like the three beautiful Grecians.\"  A laugh at our backs brought us around suddenly to face Mr. Booth, who said to me:  \"You satirical little wretch, how do you come to know these Grecian ladies?  Perhaps you have the advantage of them in being all beautiful within?\"  \"I wish it would strike outward then,\" I answered.  \"You know it's always best to have things come to the surface!\"  \"I know some very precious things are hidden from common sight; and I know, too, you caught my meaning in the first place.  Good night!\" and he left us.  We had been told to descend to the stage at night with our white robes hanging free and straight, that Mr. Booth himself might drape them as we stood upon the pedestal.  It really is a charming picture--that of the statues in the first act.  Against a backing of black velvet the three white figures, carefully posed, strongly lighted, stand out so marble-like that when they slowly turn their faces and point to their chosen master, the effect is uncanny enough to chill the looker-on.  Well, with white wigs, white tights, and white robes, and half strangled with the powder we had inhaled in our efforts to make our lips stay white, we cautiously descended the stairs  we dared not talk, we dared not blink our eyes, for fear of disturbing the coat of powder-we were lifted to the pedestal and took our places as we expected to stand.  Then Mr. Booth came--such a picture in his Greek garments as made even the men exclaim at him--and began to pose us. It happened one of us had very good limbs, one medium good, and the third had, apparently, walked on broom-sticks.  When Mr. Booth slightly raised the drapery of No. 3 his features gave a twist as though he had suddenly tasted lemon-juice, but quick as a flash he said:  \"I believe I'11 advance you to the centre for the stately and wise Aspasia\"--the central figure wore her draperies hanging straight to her feet, hence the \"advance\" and consequent concealment of the unlovely limbs.  It was quickly and kindly done, for the girl was not only spared mortification, but in the word \"advance\""]]]
