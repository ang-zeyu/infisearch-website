Every full conviction, every strong wish of his own he ascribed to divine suggestion. This put him in a position of extreme peril. It was clear that an enthusiastic, imaginative, self-reliant nature like his might thus be borne on to any extent of fanaticism.  [Sidenote: Revolt; a third Samaj. \"New Dispensation.\"] A great revolt from Mr. Sen's authority now took place, and the Sadharan Samaj was organized in May, 1878. An appeal had been made to the members generally, and no fewer than twenty-one provincial Samajes, with more than four hundred members, male and female, joined the new society. This number amounted to about two thirds of the whole body. Keshub and his friends denounced the rebels in very bitter language; and yet, in one point of view, their secession was a relief. Men of abilities equal, and education superior, to his own had hitherto acted as a drag on his movements; he was now delivered from their interference and could deal with the admiring and submissive remnant as he pleased. Ideas that had been working in his mind now attained rapid development. Within two years the flag of the \"New Dispensation\" was raised; and of that dispensation Mr. Sen was the undoubted head. Very daring was the language Mr. Sen used in a public lecture regarding this new creation. He claimed equality for it with the Jewish and Christian dispensations, and for himself \"singular\" authority and a divine commission.  [Sidenote: Its creed.] In the Creed of the New Dispensation the name of Christ does not occur. The articles were as follows:       _a._ One God, one Scripture, one Church. _b._ Eternal progress of      the soul. _c._ Communion of prophets and saints. _d._ Fatherhood      and motherhood of God. _e._ Brotherhood of man and sisterhood of      woman. _f._ Harmony of knowledge and holiness, love and work, yoga      and asceticism in their highest development. _g._ Loyalty to      sovereign.  [Sidenote: Omission of Christ's name.] The omission of Christ's name is the more remarkable because Mr. Sen spoke much of him in his public lectures. He had said in May, 1879, \"None but Jesus, none but Jesus, none but Jesus ever deserved this precious diadem, India; and Jesus shall have it.\" But he clearly indicated that the Christ he sought was an Indian Christ; one who was \"a Hindu in faith,\" and who would help the Hindus to \"realize their national idea of a yogi\" (ascetic).  [Sidenote: \"Motherhood of God.\"] Let it be noted that, from the beginning of his career, Mr. Sen had spoken earnestly of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man--though, these great conceptions are not of Hindu origin. It is difficult to see why, in later days, he insisted so much on the \"motherhood of God.\" Perhaps it was a repetition--he probably would have called it an exaltation--of the old Hindu idea, prevalent especially among the worshipers of Siva, that there is a female counterpart--a Sakti--of every divinity. Or, possibly, it may have been to conciliate the worshipers of Durga and Kali, those great goddesses of Bengal.  [Sidenote: Public proclamation said to be from God.] A public proclamation was soon issued, purporting to be from God himself, as India's mother. The whole thing was very startling; many, even of Keshub's friends, declared it blasphemous. Next, in the \"Flag Ceremony,\" the flag or banner of the New Dispensation received a homage scarcely distinguishable from worship. Then--as if in strict imitation of the ancient adoration of Agni, or Fire--a pile of wood was lighted, clarified butter poured on it, and prayers addressed to it, ending thus--\"O, brilliant Fire! in thee we behold our resplendent Lord.\" This was, at least, symbolism run wild; and every one, except those who were prepared to follow their leader to all lengths, saw that in a land like India, wedded to idolatry, it was fearfully perilous.  [Sidenote: \"Apostolic Durbar.\"] In March, 1881, Mr. Sen and his friends introduced celebrations which, to Christian minds, seemed a distressing caricature of the Christian sacraments. Other institutions followed; an Apostolic Durbar (Court of Apostles), for instance, was established. There was no end to Mr. Sen's inventiveness.  In a public lecture delivered in January, 1883, on \"Asia's message to Europe,\" he elaborately expounded the idea that all the great religions are of Asiatic origin, and that all of them are true, and that the one thing required to constitute the faith of the future--the religion of humanity--is the blending of all these varied Oriental systems into one.  [Sidenote: Inconsistencies between Mr. Sen's public and private utterances. Mr. Sen's policy of reserve.] It was not easy to reconcile Mr. Sen's public utterances with his private ones--though far be it from us to tax him with insincerity. Thus, in an interview extending over two hours, which the writer and two missionary friends had with him a week or so before the lecture now referred to, he said he accepted as true and vital all the leading doctrines of the Christian faith, with the exception of the resurrection of Christ. But another fundamental difference remained--he avowedly dissented from the orthodox creed in rejecting the miraculous element in Scripture. At an interview I had with him some time before he earnestly disclaimed all intention to put Christ on a level with Buddha or Mohammed. \"I am educating my friends,\" he said, \"to understand and approve of Christianity; I have not yet said my last word about Christ.\" It is a solemn question, Had he said it when his career was ended? If so, it was far from a satisfactory word. His policy of reserve and adaptation had probably kept him from uttering all that was in his heart; but it was a sorely mistaken policy. Had he temporized less he would have accomplished more.  Since the death of Mr. Sen there has been a violent dispute between his family and the \"Apostolic Durbar,\" on one side, and one of his ablest followers, on the other; and the New Dispensation will probably split in two, if it does not perish altogether.  [Sidenote: The Sadharan Samaj.] In the meantime, the Sadharan Samaj, which broke off from Keshub's party in 1878, has been going on with no small vigor. Vagaries, either in doctrine or rites, have been carefully shunned; its partisans profess a pure Theistic creed and labor diligently in the cause of social reform. Their position is nearly that of Unitarian Christianity, and we fear they are not at present approximating to the full belief of the Church Catholic.  [Sidenote: Movements in western India. Tenets of the Prarthana Sabha.] Very similar in character to the Brahmo Somaj is the Prarthana Somaj in western India. As far back as 1850, or a little earlier, there was formed a society called the Prarthana Sabha (Prayer-meeting). Its leading tenets were as follows:       1. I believe in one God. 2. I renounce idol-worship. 3. I will do      my best to lead a moral life. 4. If I commit any sin through the      weakness of my moral nature I will repent of it and ask the pardon      of God.  The society, after some time, began to languish; but in 1867 it was revived under the name of Prarthana Somaj. Its chief branches are in Bombay, Poona, Ahmedabad, and Surat.  [Sidenote: Arya Samaj.] An interesting movement called the Arya Samaj was commenced a few years ago by a Pandit--Dayanand Sarasvati. He received the Vedas as fully inspired, but maintained that they taught monotheism--Agni, Indra, and all the rest being merely different names of God. It was a desperate effort to save the reputation of the ancient books; but, as all Sanskrit scholars saw at a glance, the whole idea was a delusion. The Pandit is now dead; and the Arya Samaj may not long survive him.  At the time we write we hear of an attempt to defend idolatry and caste made by men of considerable education.  [Sidenote: Theosophists.] The so-called \"Theosophists\" have, for several years, been active in India. Of existing religions, Buddhism is their natural ally. They are atheists. A combination which they formed with the Arya Samaj speedily came to an end.  Lastly, the followers of Mr. Bradlaugh are diligent in supplying their books to Indian students.  Poor India! No wonder if her mind is bewildered as she listens to such a Babel of voices. The state of things in India now strikingly resembles that which existed in the Roman Empire at the rise of Christianity; when East and West were brought into the closest contact, and a great conflict of systems of thought took place in consequence.  But even as one hostile form of gnostic belief rose after another, and rose only to fall--and as the greatest and best-disciplined foe of early Christianity--the later Platonism--gave way before the steady, irresistible march of gospel truth, so--we have every reason to hope--it will be yet again. The Christian feels his heart swell in his breast as he thinks what, in all human probability, India will be a century, or even half a century, hence. O what a new life to that fairest of Eastern lands when she casts herself in sorrow and supplication at the feet of the living God, and then rises to proclaim to a listening world      \"Her deep repentance and her new-found joy!\"  May God hasten the advent of that happy day!     THE RISE AND DECLINE OF ISLAM.     OUTLINE OF THE ESSAY.   The progress of Islam was slow until Mohammed cast aside the precepts of toleration and adopted an aggressive, militant policy. Then it became rapid. The motives which animated the armies of Islam were mixed--material and spiritual. Without the truths contained in the system success would have been impossible, but neither without the sword would the religion have been planted in Arabia, nor beyond. The alternatives offered to conquered peoples were Islam, the sword, or tribute. The drawbacks and attractions of the system are examined. The former were not such as to deter men of the world from"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16997"],["title","A Journey through the Kingdom of Oude, Volumes I & II (#0)"],["body","JOURNEY  THROUGH THE  KINGDOM OF OUDE,  IN 1849--1850;   BY DIRECTION OF THE RIGHT HON.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH of MAJOR-GENERAL SIR W. H. SLEEMAN. K.C.B.       _______________________   This distinguished officer, whose career in India extended over a period of forty years, and whose services were highly appreciated by three Governors-General--Viscount Hardinge, the Earl of Ellenborough, and the Marquess of Dalhousie--evinced by their appointing him to the most difficult and delicate duties--was the son of Philip and Mary Sleeman, and was born at Stratton, Cornwall, 8th August, 1788. In early years he evinced a predilection for the military profession; and at the age of twenty-one (October, 1809), through the good offices of the late Lord De Dunstanville, he was appointed an Infantry Cadet in the Bengal army. Thither he proceeded as soon as possible, and was promoted successively to the rank of Ensign, 23rd September, 1810; Lieutenant, 16th December, 1814; Brevet-Captain, 24th April, 1824; Captain, 23rd September, 1826; Major, 1st February, 1837; Lieutenant-Colonel, 26th May, 1843; Colonel, 24th November, 1853; and obtained the rank of Major-General 28th November, 1854.  Early in his career he served in the Nepaulese war. The value of his talents soon became known, and in 1816, when it was considered necessary to investigate a claim to property as prize-money arising out of that war, Lieutenant Sleeman was selected to inquire into it. The report was accordingly made by him in February 1817, which was designated by the Government as \"able, impartial, and satisfactory.\"  In 1820 he was appointed junior Assistant to the Agent of the Governor-General at Saugur, and remained in the Civil Department in the Saugur and Nerbudda territories, with the exception of absence on sick certificate, for nearly a quarter of a century. Here he manifested that, if he had been efficient in an inferior position, he was also an able administrator in a superior post. He distinguished himself so much by his activity in the suppression of the horrible practice of Thuggism, then so prevalent, that, in 1835, he was employed exclusively in the Thuggee Department; his appointment in the Saugur and Nerbudda districts being kept open, and his promotion going on. The very valuable Papers upon Thuggism submitted to the Governor-General were chiefly drawn up by Sir William Sleeman, and the department specially commissioned"]]]
