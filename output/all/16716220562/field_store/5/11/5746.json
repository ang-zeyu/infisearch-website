Then was hee, with all convenient speed, by      commandement, convaied againe to the torment of the bootes,      wherein he continued a long time, and did abide so many      blowes in them, that the legges were crusht and beaten      together as small as might bee, and the bones and flesh so      bruised that the blood and marrow spouted forth in great      abundance, whereby they were made unserviceable for ever;      and notwithstanding all those grievous paines and cruell      torments, hee would not confess anie thing; so deeply had      the devill entered into his heart, that hee utterly denied      all that which he had before avouched, and would saie      nothing thereunto but this, that what he had done and sayde      before, was onely done and sayde for fear of paynes which he      had endured. After this horrible treatment the wretched man      was strangled and burnt.  The following list gives a few--and only a few--of the direful results to which this widespread superstition led. The instances are chiefly taken from Dr. Réville's _History of the Devil_, and Haydn's well-known _Dictionary of Dates_:--       At Toulouse a noble lady, fifty-six years of age, named      Angela de Labarète, was the first who was burnt as a      sorceress, in which special quality she formed part of the      great _auto-da-fé_ which took place in that city in the year      1275; at Carcasonne, from 1320 to 1350, more than four      hundred executions for witchcraft are on record; in 1309      many Templars were burnt at Paris for witchcraft; Joan of      Arc was burnt as a witch at Rouen, May 30th, 1431; in 1484      Pope Innocent VIII. issued a bull against witchcraft,      causing persecutions to break out in all parts of      Christendom; during three months of the year 1515, about      five hundred witches were burnt at Geneva; in 1524 many      persons were burnt for the same crime in the Diocese of      Como; about the year 1520 a great number suffered in France,      and one sorcercer confessed to having 1,200 associates; from      1580 to 1595--a period of fifteen years--about nine hundred      witches were burnt in Lorraine; between 1627 and 1629, no      fewer than one hundred and fifty-seven persons, old and      young, and of all ranks, were burnt at Wurtzburg, in      Bavaria; in 1634 a clerk named Urbain Grandier, who was      parish priest at Loudon, was burnt on a charge of having      bewitched a whole convent of Ursuline nuns; in 1654 twenty      poor women were put to death as witches in Brittany; in      1648-9 serious disturbances on account of witchcraft took      place in Massachusetts; and in 1683 dreadful persecutions      raged in Pennsylvania from the same cause; in 1692, at      Salem, in New England, nineteen persons were hanged by the      Puritans for witchcraft, and eight more were condemned,      while fifty others confessed themselves to be witches, and      were pardoned; in 1657 the witch-judge Nicholas Remy boasted      of having burnt nine hundred persons in fifteen years; in      one German principality alone, at least two hundred and      forty-two persons were burnt between 1646 and 1651,      including many children from one to six years of age; in      1749 Maria Renata was burnt at Wurtzburg for witchcraft; on      January 17th, 1775, nine old women were burnt at Kalish, in      Poland, on a charge of having bewitched and rendered      unfruitful the lands belonging to the palatinate; at      Landshut, in Bavaria, in 1756, a young girl of thirteen      years was convicted of impure intercourse with the Devil and      put to death. There were also executions for sorcery at      Seville, in Spain, in 1781, and at Glarus, in Switzerland,      in 1783; while even as late as December 15th, 1802, five      women were condemned to death for sorcery at Patna, in the      Bengal Presidency, by the Brahmins, and were all executed.       IN ENGLAND the record of Witchcraft is also a      melancholy chapter. A statute was enacted declaring all      witchcraft and sorcery to be felony without benefit of      clergy, 33 Henry VIII. 1541; and again 5 Elizabeth, 1562,      and 1 James I. 1603. The 73rd Canon of the Church, 1603,      prohibits the Clergy from casting out devils. Barrington      estimates the judicial murders for witchcraft in England,      during two hundred years, at 30,000; Matthew Hopkins, the      \"witch-finder,\" caused the judicial murder of about one      hundred persons in Essex, Norfolk, and Suffolk, 1645-7; Sir      Matthew Hale burnt two persons for witchcraft in 1664; about      1676 seventeen or eighteen persons were burnt as witches at      St. Osyths, in Essex; in 1705 two pretended witches were      executed at Northampton, and five others seven years      afterwards; in 1716, a Mrs. Hicks, and her daughter, a      little girl of nine years old, are said to have been hanged      as witches at Huntingdon, but of this there seems to be some      doubt. The last really authentic trial in England for      witchcraft took place in 1712, when the jury convicted an      old woman named Jane Wenham, of Walkerne, a little village      in the north of Hertfordshire, and she was sentenced to be      hanged. The judge, however, quietly procured a reprieve for      her, and a kind-hearted gentleman in the neighbourhood gave      her a cottage to live in, where she ended her days in peace.      With regard to the mobbing of reputed sorcerers, it is      recorded that in the year 1628, Dr. Lamb, a so-called      wizard, who had been under the protection of the Duke of      Buckingham, was torn to pieces by a London mob. While even      as late as April 22nd, 1751, a wild and tossing rabble of      about 5,000 persons beset and broke into the work-house at      Tring, in Hertfordshire, where seizing Luke Osborne and his      wife, two inoffensive old people suspected of witchcraft,      they ducked them in a pond till the old woman died. After      which, her corpse was put to bed to her husband by the mob,      of whom only one person--a chimney-sweeper named Colley, who      was the ringleader--was brought to trial and hanged for the      detestable outrage.       The laws against witchcraft in England had lain dormant for      many years, when an ignorant person attempted to revive them      by filing a bill against a poor old woman in Surrey, accused      as a witch; this led to the repeal of the laws by the      statute 10 George II. 1736. Credulity in witchcraft,      however, still lingers in some of the country districts of      the United Kingdom. On September 4th, 1863, a poor old      paralysed Frenchman died in consequence of having been      ducked as a wizard at Castle Hedingham, in Essex, and      similar cases have since occurred; while on September 17th,      1875,--only ten years ago--an old woman named Ann Turner,      was killed as a witch, by a half-insane man, at Long      Compton, Warwickshire.       IN SCOTLAND, thousands of persons were burnt for      witchcraft within a period of about a hundred years, in the      fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Among the victims were      persons of the highest rank, while all orders of the state      concurred. James I. even caused a whole assize to be      prosecuted because of an acquittal; the king published his      work on _Dæmonologie_, in Edinburgh, in 1597; the last      sufferer for witchcraft in Scotland was at Dornoch, in 1722.     CONFESSIONS OF WITCHES UNDER TORTURE.   _LE 4 JUILLET 1617._  Devant AMICE DE CARTERET, Ecuyer, Baillif, présents, etc.  SENTENCE DE MORT.  _Collette Du Mont_, veuve de _Jean Becquet_, _Marie_, sa fille, femme de _Pierre Massy_, _Isbel Bequet_, femme de _Jean Le Moygne_, etant par la coutume renommée et bruit des gens de longue main du bruit de damnable art de Sorcellerie, et icelles sur ce saisies et apprehendées par les Officiers de Sa Majesté, apres s'etre volontairement sumis et sur l'enquete generale du pays, et apres avoir été plusieurs fois conduites en Justice, ouïes, examinées et confrontées sur un grand nombre de depositions faites et produites à l'encontre d'elles par les dits Officiers, par lesquels est clair et evident qu'auraient, par longeur d'années, le susdit diabolique art de Sorcellerie, par avoir non seulement jété leur sort sur des choses insensible, mais aussi tenu en langueur par maladies etranges plusieurs personnes et betes, et aussi cruellement meurti grand nombre d'hommes, femmes, et enfans, et fait mourir plusieurs animaux, recordés aux informations sur ce faites, s'ensuit qu'elles sont plainement convaincues et atteintes d'etre Sorcieres. Pour reparation duquel crime a eté dit par la Cour que lesdites femmes seront presentement conduites la halte au col au lieu de supplice accoutumé, et par l'Officier criminel attachées à un poteau, pendues, etranglées, osciées, et brulées, jusqu'à ce que leur chairs et ossements soient reduits en cendres, et leurs cendres eparcées; et sont tous les biens, meubles, et heritages, si aucun en ont acquit, à Sa Majesté.

In expiation of which crime it has been ordered by the Court that the said women shall be presently conducted, with halters about their necks, to the usual place of punishment, and shall there be fastened by the Executioner to a gallows, and be hanged, strangled, killed, and burnt, until their flesh and bones are reduced to ashes, and the ashes shall be scattered; and all their goods, chattels, and estates, if any such exist, shall be forfeited to His Majesty. In order to make them disclose their accomplices, they shall be put to the question before the Court, previous to being executed.   Sentence de mort ayant esté prononcée à l'encontre de _Collette Du Mont_, veuve de _Jean Becquet_, _Marie_, sa fille, femme de _Pierre Massy_, et _Isbel Becquet_, femme de _Jean Le Moygne_, auroyent icelles confessé comme suit:--  CONFESSION DE COLLETTE DU MONT.  Premier, la diste _Collette_ immediatement appres la dyte sentence donnée, et avant que de sortir de l'auditoire, a librement recognu qu'elle estoit Sorciere; toutesfois ne voulant particularizer les crimes qu'auroit commis a esté conduite avec les autres en la Maison de la Question, et la dite question luy estant applicquée, a confessé qu'elle estoit encore jeune lors que le Diable en forme de chat: s'aparut à elle: en la Paroisse de Torteval: lors qu'elle retournoit de son bestiall, estant encore jour, et qu'il print occasion de la seduire, par l'inciter à se venger d'un de ses voisins avec lequell elle estoit pour lors en querelle pour quelque domage qu'elle auroit receu par les bestes d'yceluy; que depuis lors qu'elle avoit eu querelle avec quelcun, ill se representoit à elle en la susdite forme: et quelquefois en forme de chien: l'induisant à se venger de ceux contre lesquels elle estoit faschée: la persuadant de faire mourir des personnes et bestes.  Que le Diable l'estant venue querir pour aller au Sabat, l'appelloit sans qu'on s'en apperceust: et luy bailloit ung certain onguent noir, duquel (appres s'etre despouillée) elle se frotoit le dos, ventre et estomac: et s'estant revestuë, sortoit hors son huis, lors estoit incontinent emportée par l'air d'une grande vitesse: et se trouvoit a l'instant au lieu du Sabat, qui estoit quelquefois pres le cimetiere de la paroisse: et quelques autres fois pres le rivage de la mer, aux environs du Chateau de Rocquaine: là où estant arivée s'y rencontroit souvent quinze ou saize Sorciers et Sorcieres avec les Diables, qu'y estoient là en forme de chiens, chats, et lievres: lesquels Sorciers et Sorcieres elle n'a peu recognoistre, parce qu'ils estoyent tous noircis et deffigurés: bien est vray avoir ouy le Diable les evocquer par leur noms, et se souvaient entre autres de la _Fallaise_, et de la _Hardie_; dit confesse qu'a l'entrée du Sabath: le Diable les voulant esvosquer commencoit par elle quelquefois. Que sa fille _Marie_, femme de _Massy_, à present condamnée pour pareill crime, est Sorciere: et qu'elle la menée par deux fois au Sabath avec elle: ne scait par où le Diable la merchée: qu'au Sabath appres avoir adoré le Diable, lequell se tenoit debout sur ses pieds de derriere, ils avoient copulation avec luy en forme de chien; puis dansoyent dos a dos. Et appres avoir dansé, beuvoyent du vin (ne scait de quelle couleur), que le Diable versoit hors d'un pot en ung gobelet d'argent ou d'estrain; lequell vin ne luy sembloit sy bon que celuy qu'on boit ordinarement; mangeoist aussy du pain blanc quj leur presentoit--n'a jamais veu de sell au Sabath.  Confesse que le Diable luy avoit donné charge d'appeler en passant _Isebell le Moygne_: lors quelle viendroit au Sabath, ce qu'elle a fait diverses fois. Qu'au partir du Sabath le Diable l'incitoit à perpetrer plusieurs maux: et pour cest effect luy bailloit certaines pouldres noires, qu'il lui commandoit de ietter sur telles personnes et bestes qu'elle voudroit; avec laquelle pouldre elle a perpetré plusieurs maux desquels ne se souvient: entres autres en ietta sur _Mes. Dolbell_, ministre de la paroisse: et fut occasion de sa mort par ce moyen. Par ceste mesme pouldre ensorcela la femme de _Jean Maugues_: toutesfois nie qu'elle soit morte par son sort: qu'elle toucha par le costé, et ietta de ceste pouldre sur la femme defuncte de _Mr Perchard_, successeur ministre du dit _Dolbell_, en ycelle paroisse, ycelle estant pour lors enceinte, tellement qu'elle la fist mourir et son fruit--ne scait quelle occasion luy fut donnée par la dite femme.  Que sur le refus que la femme de _Collas Tottevin_ luy fist de luy donner du laict: elle fist assecher sa vache, en iettant sur ycelle de ceste pouldre: laquelle vache elle regarit par appres en luy faisant manger du son, et de l'herbe terrestre que le Diable lui bailla.   Sentence of Death having been pronounced against _Collette Du Mont_, widow of _Jean Becquet_; _Marie_, her daughter, wife of _Pierre Massy_; and _Isabel Becquet_, wife of _Jean Le Moygne_; the same have confessed as follows:--  CONFESSION OF COLLETTE DU MONT.  First, the said _Collette_ immediately after the said sentence was pronounced, and before leaving the Court, freely admitted that she was a Witch; at the same time, not wishing to specify the crimes which she had committed, she was taken, along with the others, to the Torture Chamber, and the said question being applied to her, she confessed that she was quite young when the Devil, in the form of a cat: appeared to her: in the Parish of Torteval: as she was returning from her cattle, it being still daylight, and that he took occasion to lead her astray by inciting her to avenge herself on one of her neighbours, with whom she was then at enmity, on account of some damage which she had suffered through the cattle of the latter; that since then when she had a quarrel with anyone, he appeared to her in the aforesaid form: and sometimes in the form of a dog: inducing her to take vengence upon those who had angered her: persuading her to cause the death of persons and cattle.  That the Devil having come to fetch her that she might go to the Sabbath, called for her without anyone perceiving it: and gave her a certain black ointment with which (after having stripped herself), she rubbed her back, belly and stomach: and then having again put on her clothes, she went out of her door, when she was immediately carried through the air at a great speed: and she found herself in an instant at the place of the Sabbath, which was sometimes near the parochial burial-ground: and at other times near the seashore in the neighbourhood of Rocquaine Castle: where, upon arrival, she met often fifteen or sixteen Wizards and Witches with the Devils who were there in the form of dogs, cats, and hares: which Wizards and Witches she was unable to recognise, because they were all blackened and disfigured: it was true, however, that she had heard the Devil summon them by their names, and she remembered among others those of _Fallaise_ and _Hardie_; confessed that on entering the Sabbath: the Devil wishing to summon them commenced with her sometimes. Admitted that her daughter _Marie_, wife of _Massy_, now condemned for a similar crime, was a Witch: and that she took her twice to the Sabbath with her: at the Sabbath, after having worshipped the Devil, who used to stand up on his hind legs, they had connection with him under the form of a dog; then they danced back to back. And after having danced, they drank wine (she did not know what colour it was), which the Devil poured out of a jug into a silver or pewter goblet; which wine did not seem to her so good as that which was usually drunk; they also ate white bread which he presented to them--she had never seen any salt at the Sabbath.  Confessed that the Devil had charged her to call, as she passed, for _Isabel le Moygne_: when she came to the Sabbath, which she had done several times. On leaving the Sabbath the Devil incited her to commit various evil deeds: and to that effect he gave her certain black powders, which he ordered her to throw upon such persons and cattle as she wished; with this powder she perpetrated several wicked acts which she did not remember: among others she threw some upon _Mr Dolbell_, parish minister: and was the occasion of his death by these means. With this same powder she bewitched the wife of _Jean Maugues_: but denied that the woman's death was caused by it: she also touched on the side, and threw some of this powder over the deceased wife of _Mr Perchard_, the minister who succeeded the said _Dolbell_ in the parish, she being _enceinte_ at the time, and so caused the death of her and her infant--she did not know that the deceased woman had given her any cause for doing so.  Upon the refusal of the wife of _Collas Tottevin_ to give her some milk: she caused her cow to dry up, by throwing upon it some of this powder: which cow she afterwards cured again by making it eat some bran, and"]]]
