The King of Babylon, taking advantage of the fashion which prompted the Egyptians to acquire objects of Chaldæan goldsmiths and cabinet-makers art, caused ingots of gold to be sent to him by the Pharaoh, which he returned worked up into vases, ornaments, household utensils, and plated chariots. He further fixed the value of all such objects, and took a considerable commission for having acted as intermediary in the transaction.* In Alasia, which was the land of metals, the king appears to have held a monopoly of the bronze. Whether he smelted it in the country, or received it from more distant regions ready prepared, we cannot say, but he claimed and retained for himself the payment for all that the Pharaoh deigned to order of him.**       * Letter of Burnaburiash to Amenôthes IV.       ** Letter from the King of Alasia to Amenôthes III., where,      whilst pretending to have nothing else in view than making a      present to his royal brother, he proposes to make an      exchange of some bronze for the products of Egypt,      especially for gold.  From such instances we can well understand the jealous, watch which these sovereigns exercised, lest any individual connected with corporations of workmen should leave the kingdom and establish himself in another country without special permission. Any emigrant who opened a workshop and initiated his new compatriots in the technique or professional secrets of his craft, was regarded by the authorities as the most dangerous of all evil-doers. By thus introducing his trade into a rival state, he deprived his own people of a good customer, and thus rendered himself liable to the penalties inflicted on those who were guilty of treason. His savings were confiscated, his house razed to the ground, and his whole family--parents, wives, and children--treated as partakers in his crime. As for himself, if justice succeeded in overtaking him, he was punished with death, or at least with mutilation, such as the loss of eyes and ears, or amputation of the feet. This severity did not prevent the frequent occurrence of such cases, and it was found necessary to deal with them by the insertion of a special extradition clause in treaties of peace and other alliances. The two contracting parties decided against conceding the right of habitation to skilled workmen who should take refuge with either party on the territory of the other, and they agreed to seize such workmen forthwith, and mutually restore them, but under the express condition that neither they nor any of their belongings should incur any penalty for the desertion of their country. It would be curious to know if all the arrangements agreed to by the kings of those times were sanctioned, as in the above instance, by properly drawn up agreements. Certain expressions occur in their correspondence which seem to prove that this was the case, and that the relations between them, of which we can catch traces, resulted not merely from a state of things which, according to their ideas, did not necessitate any diplomatic sanction, but from conventions agreed to after some war, or entered on without any previous struggle, when there was no question at issue between the two states.*       * The treaty of Ramses II. with the King of the Khâti, the      only one which has come down to us, was a renewal of other      treaties effected one after the other between the fathers      and grandfathers of the two contracting sovereigns. Some of      the Tel el-Amarna letters probably refer to treaties of this      kind; e.g. that of Burnaburiash of Babylon, who says that      since the time of Karaîndash there had been an exchange of      ambassadors and friendship between the sovereigns of Chaldoa      and of Egypt, and also that of Dushratta of Mitanni, who      reminds Queen Tîi of the secret negotiations which had taken      place between him and Amenôthes III.  When once the Syrian conquest had been effected, Egypt gave permanency to its results by means of a series of international decrees, which officially established the constitution of her empire, and brought about her concerted action with the Asiatic powers.

She already occupied an important position among them, when Thûtmosis III. died, on the last day of Phamenoth, in the IVth year of his reign.* He was buried, probably, at Deîr el-Baharî, in the family tomb wherein the most illustrious members of his house had been laid to rest since the time of Thûtmosis I. His mummy was not securely hidden away, for towards the close of the XXth dynasty it was torn out of the coffin by robbers, who stripped it and rifled it of the jewels with which it was covered, injuring it in their haste to carry away the spoil. It was subsequently re-interred, and has remained undisturbed until the present day; but before re-burial some renovation of the wrappings was necessary, and as portions of the body had become loose, the restorers, in order to give the mummy the necessary firmness, compressed it between four oar-shaped slips of wood, painted white, and placed, three inside the wrappings and one outside, under the bands which confined the winding-sheet.       * Dr. Mahler has, with great precision, fixed the date of      the accession of Thûtmosis III, as the 20th of March, 1503,      and that of his death as the 14th of February, 1449 b.c. I      do not think that the data furnished to Dr. Mahler by      Brugsch will admit of such exact conclusions being drawn      from them, and I should fix the fifty-four years of the      reign of Thûtmosis III. in a less decided manner, between      1550 and 1490 b.c., allowing, as I have said before, for an      error of half a century more or less in the dates which go      back to the time of the second Theban empire.  [Illustration: 041.jpg HEAD OF THE MUMMY OF THÛTMOSIS III.]       Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph lent by M. Grébaut,      taken by Emil Brugsch-Bey.  Happily the face, which had been plastered over with pitch at the time of embalming, did not suffer at all from this rough treatment, and appeared intact when the protecting mask was removed. Its appearance does not answer to our ideal of the conqueror. His statues, though not representing him as a type of manly beauty, yet give him refined, intelligent features, but a comparison with the mummy shows that the artists have idealised their model. The forehead is abnormally low, the eyes deeply sunk, the jaw heavy, the lips thick, and the cheek-bones extremely prominent; the whole recalling the physiognomy of Thûtmosis II., though with a greater show of energy. Thûtmosis III. is a fellah of the old stock, squat, thickset, vulgar in character and expression, but not lacking in firmness and vigour.* Amenôthes II., who succeeded him, must have closely resembled him, if we may trust his official portraits. He was the son of a princess of the blood, Hâtshopsîtû II., daughter of the great Hâtshopsîtû,** and consequently he came into his inheritance with stronger claims to it than any other Pharaoh since the time of Amenôthes I. Possibly his father may have associated him with himself on the throne as soon as the young prince attained his majority;*** at any rate, his accession aroused no appreciable opposition in the country, and if any difficulties were made, they must have come from outside.       * The restored remains allow us to estimate the height at      about 5 ft. 3 in.       ** His parentage is proved by the pictures preserved in the      tomb of his foster-father, where he is represented in      company with the _royal mother_, Marîtrî. Hâtshopsîtû.       *** It is thus that Wiedemann explains his presence by the      side of Thûtmosis III. on certain bas-reliefs in the temple      of Amada.  It is always a dangerous moment in the existence of a newly formed empire when its founder having passed away, and the conquered people not having yet become accustomed to a subject condition, they are called upon to submit to a successor of whom they know little or nothing. It is always problematical whether the new sovereign will display as great activity and be as successful as the old one; whether he will be capable of turning to good account the armies which his predecessor commanded with such skill, and led so bravely against the enemy; whether, again, he will have sufficient tact to estimate correctly the burden of taxation which each province is capable of bearing, and to lighten it when there is a risk of its becoming too heavy. If he does not show from the first that it is his purpose to maintain his patrimony intact at all costs, or if his officers, no longer controlled by a strong hand, betray any indecision in command, his subjects will become unruly, and the change of monarch will soon furnish a pretext for widespread rebellion. The beginning of the reign of Amenôthes II. was marked by a revolt of the Libyans inhabiting the Theban Oasis, but this rising was soon put down by that Amenemhabî who had so distinguished himself under Thûtmosis.* Soon after, fresh troubles broke out in different parts of Syria, in Galilee, in the country of the Amurru, and among the peoples of Naharaim. The kings prompt action, however, prevented their resulting in a general war.** He marched in person against the malcontents, reduced the town of Shamshiaduma, fell upon the Lamnaniu, and attacked their chief, slaying him with his own hand, and carrying off numbers of captives.       * Brugsch and Wiedemann place this expedition at the time      when Amenôthes IL was either hereditary prince or associated      with his father the inscription of Amenemhabî places it      explicitly after the death of Thûtmosis III., and this      evidence outweighs every other consideration until further      discoveries are made.

The date of this monument is almost      certainly the year II.; there is strong evidence in favour      of this, if it is compared with the inscription of Amada,      where Amenôthes II. relates that in the year III. he      sacrificed the prisoners whom he had taken in the country of      Tikhisa.  [Illustration: 044.jpg AMENÔTHES II., FROM THE STATUE AT TURIN]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin.  He crossed the Orontes on the 26th of Pachons, in the year II., and seeing some mounted troops in the distance, rushed upon them and overthrew them; they proved to be the advanced guard of the enemys force, which he encountered shortly afterwards and routed, collecting in the pursuit considerable booty. He finally reached Naharaim, where he experienced in the main but a feeble resistance. Nîi surrendered without resistance on the 10th of Epiphi, and its inhabitants, both men and women, with censers in their hands, assembled on the walls and prostrated themselves before the conqueror. At Akaîti, where the partisans of the Egyptian government had suffered persecution from a considerable section of the natives, order was at once reestablished as soon as the kings approach was made known. No doubt the rapidity of his marches and the vigour of his attacks, while putting an end to the hostile attitude of the smaller vassal states, were effectual in inducing the sovereigns of Alasia, of Mitanni,* and of the Hittites to renew with Amenôthes the friendly relations which they had established with his father.**       * Amenôthes II. mentions tribute from Mitanni on one of the      columns which he decorated at Karnak, in the Hall of the      Caryatides, close to the pillars finished by his      predecessors.       ** The cartouches on the pedestal of the throne of Amenôthes      IL, in the tomb of one of his officers at Sheîkh-Abd-el-      Qûrneh, represent--together with the inhabitants of the      Oasis, Libya, and Kush--the Kefatiû, the people of Naharaim,      and the Upper Lotanû, that is to say, the entire dominion of      Thûtmosis III., besides the people of Manûs, probably      Mallos, in the Cilician plain.  This one campaign, which lasted three or four months, secured a lasting peace in the north, but in the south a disturbance again broke out among the Barbarians of the Upper Nile. Amenôthes suppressed it, and, in order to prevent a repetition of it, was guilty of an act of cruel severity quite in accordance with the manners of the time. He had taken prisoner seven chiefs in the country of Tikhisa, and had brought them, chained, in triumph to Thebes, on the forecastle of his ship. He sacrificed six of them himself before Amon, and exposed their heads and hands on the façade of the temple of Karnak; the seventh was subjected to a similar fate at Napata at the beginning of his third year, and thenceforth the sheîkhs of Kush thought twice before defying the authority of the Pharaoh.*       * In an inscription in the temple of Amada, it is there said      that the king offered this sacrifice on his return from his      first expedition into Asia, and for this reason I have      connected the facts thus related with those known to us      through the stele of Karnak.  Amenôthesreign was a short one, lasting ten years at most, and the end of it seems to have been darkened by the open or secret rivalries which the question of the succession usually stirred up among the kings sons. The king had daughters only by his marriage with one of his full sisters, who like himself possessed all the rights of sovereignty; those of his sons who did not die young were the children of princesses of inferior rank or of concubines, and it was a subject of anxiety among these princes which of them would be chosen to inherit the crown and be united in marriage with the kings heiresses, Khûît and Mûtemûaû.  [Illustration: 046.jpg THE GREAT SPHINX AND THE CHAPEL OF THUTMOSIS IV.]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the photograph taken in 1887 by      Émil Brugsch-Bey  [Illustration: 047.jpg THE SIMOOM. SPHINX AND PYRAMIDS AT GIZEH]  One of his sons, named Thûtmosis, who resided at the White Wall, was in the habit of betaking himself frequently to the Libyan desert to practise with the javelin, or to pursue the hunt of lions and gazelles in his chariot. On these occasions it was his pleasure to preserve the strictest incognito, and he was accompanied by two discreet servants only. One day, when chance had brought him into the neighbourhood of the Great Pyramid, he lay down for his accustomed siesta in the shade cast by the Sphinx, the miraculous image of Khopri the most powerful, the god to whom all men in Memphis and the neighbouring towns raised adoring hands filled with offerings. The gigantic statue was at that time more than half buried, and its head alone was seen above the sand. As soon as the prince was asleep it spoke gently to him, as a father to his son: Behold me, gaze on me, O my son Thûtmosis, for I, thy father Harmakhis-Khopri-Tûmû, grant thee sovereignty over the two countries, in both the South and the North, and thou shalt wear both the white and the red crown on the throne of Sibû, the sovereign, possessing the earth in its length and breadth; the flashing eye of the lord of all shall cause to rain on thee the possessions of Egypt, vast tribute from all foreign countries, and a long life for, many years as one chosen by the Sun, for my countenance is thine, my heart is thine, no other than thyself is mine! Nor am I covered by the sand of the mountain on which I rest, and have given thee this prize that thou mayest do for me what my heart desires, for I know that thou art my son, my defender; draw nigh, I am with thee, I am thy well-beloved father. The prince understood that the god promised him the kingdom on condition of his swearing to clear the sand from the statue. He was, in fact, chosen to be the husband of the queens, and immediately after his accession he fulfilled his oath; he removed the sand, built a chapel between the paws, and erected against the breast of the statue a stele of red granite, on which he related his adventure. His reign was as short as that of Amenôthes, and his campaigns both in Asia and Ethiopia were unimportant.*       * The latest date of his reign at present known is that of      the year VII., on the rocks of Konosso, and on a stele of      Sarbût el-Khâdîm. There is an allusion to his wars against      the Ethiopians in an inscription of Amada, and to his      campaigns against the peoples of the North and South on the      stele of Nofirhaît.  [Illustration: 050.jpg THE STELE OF THE SPHINX OF GIZER]       Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Émil Brugsch-Bey.  He had succeeded to an empire so firmly established from Naharaim to Kari,* that, apparently, no rebellion could disturb its peace. One of the two heiress-princesses, Kûît, the daughter, sister, and wife of a king, had no living male offspring, but her companion Mûtemûaû had at least one son, named Amenôthes. In his case, again, the noble birth of the mother atoned for the defects of the paternal origin. Moreover, according to tradition, Amon-Ka himself had intervened to renew the blood of his descendants: he appeared in the person of Thûtmosis IV., and under this guise became the father of the heir of the Pharaohs.**       * The peoples of Naharaim and of Northern Syria are      represented bringing him tribute, in a tomb at Sheîkh-Abd-      el-Qûrneh. The inscription published by Mariette, speaks of      the first expedition of Thûtmosis IV. to the land of      [Naharai]na, and of the gifts which he lavished on this      occasion on the temple of Anion.       ** It was at first thought that Mûtemûaû was an Ethiopian,      afterwards that she was a Syrian, who had changed her name      on arriving at the court of her husband. The manner in which      she is represented at Luxor, and in all the texts where she      figures, proves not only that she was of Egyptian race, but      that she was the daughter of Amenôthes II., and born of the      marriage of that prince with one of his sisters, who was      herself an hereditary princess.  Like Queen Ahmasis in the bas-reliefs of Deîr el-Baharî, Mûtemûaû is shown on those of Luxor in the arms of her divine lover, and subsequently greeted by him with the title of mother; in another bas-relief we see the queen led to her couch by the goddesses who preside over the birth of children; her son Amenôthes, on coming into the world with his double, is placed in the hands of the two Niles, to receive the nourishment and the education meet for the children of the gods. He profited fully by them, for he remained in power forty years, and his reign was one of the most prosperous ever witnessed by Egypt during the Theban dynasties.  [Illustration: 052.jpg QUEEN MUTEMÛAU.]       Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Daniel Héron.  Amenôthes III. had spent but little of his time in war. He had undertaken the usual raids in the South against the negroes and the tribes of the Upper Nile. In his fifth year, a general defection of the sheikhs obliged him to invade the province of Abhaît, near Semneh, which he devastated at the head of the troops collected by Mari-ifi mosû, the Prince of Kûsh; the punishment was salutary, the booty considerable, and a lengthy peace was re-established. The object of his rare expeditions into Naharaim was not so much to add new provinces to his empire, as to prevent disturbances in the old ones. The kings of Alasia, of the Khâti, of Mitanni, of Singar,* of Assyria, and of Babylon did not dare to provoke so powerful a neighbour.**       * Amenôthes entitles himself on a scarabæus he who takes      prisoner the country of Singar; no other document has yet      been discovered to show whether this is hyperbole, or "]]]
