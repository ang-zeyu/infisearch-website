Blavatsky (#2)"],["body","Magic and other secret Sciences as the glorious Sun does from a rush-light, as the immutable and immortal Spirit of Man--the reflection of the absolute, causeless, and unknowable all,--differs from the mortal clay--the human body.  In our highly civilized West, where modern languages have been formed, and words coined, in the wake of ideas and thoughts--as happened with every tongue--the more the latter became materialized in the cold atmosphere of Western selfishness and its incessant chase after the goods of this world, the less was there any need felt for the production of new terms to express that which was tacitly regarded as obsolete and exploded \"superstition.\" Such words could answer only to ideas which a cultured man was scarcely supposed to harbor in his mind. \"Magic,\" a synonym for jugglery; \"Sorcery,\" an equivalent for crass ignorance; and \"Occultism,\" the sorry relic of crack-brained, medieval Fire-philosophers, of the Jacob Boehmes and the St. Martins, are expressions believed more than amply sufficient to cover the whole field of \"thimble-rigging.\" They are terms of contempt, and used generally only in reference to the dross and residues of the Dark Ages and its preceding aeons of paganism. Therefore have we no terms in the English tongue to define and shade the difference between such abnormal powers, or the sciences that lead to the acquisition of them, with the nicety possible in the Eastern languages--pre-eminently the Sanskrit. What do the words \"miracle\" and \"enchantment\" (words identical in meaning after all, as both express the idea of producing wonderful things by _breaking the laws of nature_ [!!] as explained by the accepted authorities) convey to the minds of those who hear, or who pronounce them? A Christian--_breaking_ \"of the laws of nature,\" notwithstanding--while believing firmly in the _miracles_, because said to have been produced by God through Moses, will either scout the enchantments performed by Pharoah's magicians, or attribute them to the devil. It is the latter whom our pious enemies connect with Occultism, while their impious foes, the infidels, laugh at Moses, Magicians, and Occultists, and would blush to give one serious thought to such \"superstitions.\" This, because there is no term in existence to show the difference; no words to express the lights and shadows and draw the line of demarcation between the sublime and the true, the absurd and the ridiculous. The latter are the theological interpretations which teach the \"breaking of the laws of Nature\" by man, God, or devil; the former--the _scientific_ \"miracles\" and enchantments of Moses and the Magicians _in accordance with natural laws_, both having been learned in all the Wisdom of the Sanctuaries, which were the \"Royal Societies\" of those days--and in true OCCULTISM. This last word is certainly misleading, translated as it stands from the compound word _Guptâ-Vidyâ_, \"Secret Knowledge.\" But the knowledge of what? Some of the Sanskrit terms may help us.  There are four (out of the many other) names of the various kinds of Esoteric Knowledge or Sciences given, even in the exoteric Purânas. There is (1) _Yajña-Vidyâ_,[C] knowledge of the occult powers awakened in Nature by the performance of certain religious ceremonies and rites. (2) _Mahâ-Vidyâ_, the \"great knowledge,\" the magic of the Kabalists and of the _Tântrika_ worship, often Sorcery of the worst description. (3) _Guhyâ-Vidyâ_, knowledge of the mystic powers residing in Sound (Ether), hence in the _Mantras_ (chanted prayers or incantations) and depending on the rhythm and melody used; in other words a magical performance based on Knowledge of the Forces of Nature and their correlation; and (4) Âtma-Vidyâ, a term which is translated simply \"Knowledge of the Soul,\" _true Wisdom_ by the Orientalists, but which means far more.  This last is the only kind of Occultism that any Theosophist who admires _Light on the Path_, and who would be wise and unselfish, ought to strive after. All the rest is some branch of the \"Occult Sciences,\" i.e., arts based on the knowledge of the ultimate essence of all things in the Kingdom of Nature--such as minerals, plants, and animals--hence of things pertaining to the realm of _material_ Nature, however invisible that essence may be, and howsoever much it has hitherto eluded the grasp of Science. Alchemy, Astrology, Occult Physiology, Chiromancy exist in Nature, and the _exact_ Sciences--perhaps so called because they are found in this age of paradoxical philosophies the reverse--have already discovered not a few of the secrets of the above _arts_. But clairvoyance, symbolized in India as the \"Eye of Siva,\" called in Japan, \"Infinite Vision,\" is _not_ Hypnotism, the illegitimate son of Mesmerism, and is not to be acquired by such arts. All the others may be mastered and results obtained, whether good, bad, or indifferent; but _Âtma-Vidyâ_ sets small value on them. It includes them all, and may even use them occasionally, but it does so after purifying them of their dross, for beneficent purposes, and taking care to deprive them of every element of selfish motive. Let us explain: Any man or woman can set himself or herself to study one or all of the above specified \"Occult Arts\" without any great previous preparation, and even without adopting any too restraining mode of life. One could even dispense with any lofty standard of morality. In the last case, of course, ten to one the student would blossom into a very decent kind of sorcerer, and tumble down headlong into black magic. But what can this matter? The _Voodoos_ and the _Dugpas_ eat, drink and are merry over hecatombs of victims of their infernal arts. And so do the amiable gentlemen vivisectionists and the _diploma-ed_ \"Hypnotizers\" of the Faculties of Medicine; the only difference between the two classes being that the Voodoos and the Dugpas are _conscious_, and the Charcot-Richet crew _unconscious_ Sorcerers. Thus, since both have to reap the fruits of their labors and achievements in the black art, the Western practitioners should not have the punishment and reputation without the profits and enjoyments they may get therefrom. For we say it again, _hypnotism_ and _vivisection_ as practised in such schools, are _Sorcery_ pure and simple, _minus_ a knowledge that the Voodoos and Dugpas enjoy, and which no Charcot-Richet can procure for himself in fifty years of hard study and experimental observation. Let then those who will dabble in magic, whether they understand its nature or not, but who find the rules imposed upon students too hard, and who, therefore, lay Âtma-Vidyâ or Occultism aside--go without it. Let them become magicians by all means, even though they do become _Voodoos_ and _Dugpas_ for the next ten incarnations.  But the interest of our readers will probably center on those who are invincibly attracted towards the \"Occult,\" yet who neither realize the true nature of what they aspire towards, nor have they become passion-proof, far less truly unselfish.  How about these unfortunates, we shall be asked, who are thus rent in twain by conflicting forces? For it has been said too often to need repetition, and the fact itself is patent to any observer, that when once the desire for Occultism has really awakened in a man's heart, there remains for him no hope of peace, no place of rest and comfort in all the world. He is driven out into the wild and desolate spaces of life by an ever-gnawing unrest he cannot quell. His heart is too full of passion and selfish desire to permit him to pass the Golden Gate; he cannot find rest or peace in ordinary life. Must he then inevitably fall into sorcery and black magic, and through many incarnations heap up for himself a terrible Karma? Is there no other road for him?  Indeed there is, we answer. Let him aspire to no higher than he feels able to accomplish. Let him not take a burden upon himself too heavy for him to carry. Without ever becoming a \"Mahâtmâ,\" a Buddha, or a Great Saint, let him study the philosophy and the \"Science of Soul,\" and he can become one of the modest benefactors of humanity, without any \"superhuman\" powers. _Siddhis_ (or the Arhat powers) are only for those who are able to \"lead the life,\" to comply with the terrible sacrifices required for such a training, and to comply with them _to the very letter_. Let them know at once and remember always, that _true Occultism or Theosophy_ is the \"Great Renunciation of SELF,\" unconditionally and absolutely, in thought as in action. It is ALTRUISM, and it throws him who practises it out of calculation of the ranks of the living altogether. \"Not for himself, but for the world, he lives,\" as soon as he has pledged himself to the work. Much is forgiven during the first years of probation. But, no sooner is he \"accepted\" than his personality must disappear, and he has to become _a mere beneficent force in Nature_. There are two poles for him after that, two paths, and no midward place of rest. He has either to ascend laboriously, step by step, often through numerous incarnations and _no Devachanic break_, the golden ladder leading to Mahâtmâship (the _Arhat_ or _Bodhisattva_ condition), or--he will let himself slide down the ladder at the first false step, and roll down into _Dugpa-ship_....  All this is either unknown or left out of sight altogether. Indeed, one who is able to follow the silent evolution of the preliminary aspirations of the candidates, often finds strange ideas quietly taking possession of their minds. There are those whose reasoning powers have been so distorted by foreign influences that they imagine that animal passions can be so sublimated and elevated that their fury, force, and fire can, so to speak, be turned inwards; that they can be stored and shut up in one's breast, until their energy is, not expanded, but turned toward higher and more holy purposes; namely, _until their collective and unexpanded strength enables their possessor to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17009"],["title","Studies in Occultism; A Series of Reprints from the Writings of H. P. Blavatsky (#3)"],["body","the true Sanctuary of the Soul_ and stand therein in the presence of the _Master_--the Higher Self! For this purpose they will not struggle with their passions nor slay them. They will simply, by a strong effort of will put down the fierce flames and keep them at bay within their natures, allowing the fire to smolder under a thin layer of ashes. They submit joyfully to the torture of the Spartan boy who allowed the fox to devour his entrails rather than part with it. Oh, poor, blind visionaries!  As well hope that a band of drunken chimney-sweeps, hot and greasy from their work, may be shut up in a Sanctuary hung with pure white linen, and that instead of soiling and turning it by their presence into a heap of dirty shreds, they will become masters in and of the sacred recess, and finally emerge from it as immaculate as that recess. Why not imagine that a dozen of skunks imprisoned in the pure atmosphere of a _Dgon-pa_ (a monastery) can issue out of it impregnated with all the perfumes of the incenses used?... Strange aberration of the human mind. Can it be so? Let us argue.  The \"Master\" in the Sanctuary of our souls is \"the Higher Self\"--the divine spirit whose consciousness is based upon and derived solely (at any rate during the mortal life of the man in whom it is captive) from the Mind, which we have agreed to call the _Human Soul_ (the \"Spiritual Soul\" being the vehicle of the Spirit). In its turn the former (the _personal_ or human soul) is a compound in its highest form, of spiritual aspirations, volitions and divine love; and in its lower aspect, of animal desires and terrestrial passions imparted to it by its associations with its vehicle, the seat of all these. It thus stands as a link and a medium between the animal nature of man which its higher reason seeks to subdue, and his divine spiritual nature to which it gravitates, whenever it has the upper hand in its struggle with the _inner animal_. The latter is the instinctual \"animal Soul\" and is the hotbed of those passions, which, as just shown, are lulled instead of being killed, and locked up in their breasts by some imprudent enthusiasts. Do they still hope to turn thereby the muddy stream of the animal sewer into the crystalline waters of life? And where, on what neutral ground can they be imprisoned so as not to affect man? The fierce passions of love and lust are still alive and they are allowed to still remain in the place of their birth--_that same animal soul_; for both the higher and the lower portions of the \"Human Soul\" or Mind reject such inmates, though they cannot avoid being tainted with them as neighbors. The \"Higher Self\" or Spirit is as unable to assimilate such feelings as water to get mixed with oil or unclean liquid tallow. It is thus the mind alone--the sole link and medium between the man of earth and the Higher Self--that is the only sufferer, and which is in the incessant danger of being dragged down by those passions that may be reawakened at any moment, and perish in the abyss of matter. And how can it ever attune itself to the divine harmony of the highest Principle, when that harmony is destroyed by the mere presence, within the Sanctuary in preparation, of such animal passions? How can harmony prevail and conquer, when the soul is stained and distracted with the turmoil of passions and the terrestrial desires of the bodily senses, or even of the \"Astral man\"?  For this \"Astral\"--the shadowy \"double\" (in the animal as in man)--is not the companion of the _divine Ego_ but of the _earthly body_. It is the link between the personal Self, the lower consciousness of _Manas_ and the Body, and is the vehicle of _transitory_, _not of immortal life_. Like the shadow projected by man, it follows his movements and impulses slavishly and mechanically, and leans therefore to matter without ever ascending to Spirit. It is only when the power of the passions is dead altogether, and when they have been crushed and annihilated in the retort of an unflinching will; when not only all the lusts and longings of the flesh are dead, but also the recognition of the personal Self is killed out and the \"astral\" has been reduced in consequence to a cipher, that the Union with the \"Higher Self\" can take place. Then when the \"astral\" reflects only the conquered man, the still living, but no more the longing, selfish personality, then the brilliant _Augoeides_, the divine Self, can vibrate in conscious harmony with both the poles of the human Entity--the man of matter purified, and the ever pure Spiritual Soul--and stand in the presence of the Master Self, the Christos of the mystic Gnostics, blended, merged into, and one with IT for ever.[D]  How then can it be thought possible for a man to enter the \"strait gate\" of occultism when his daily and hourly thoughts are bound up with worldly things, desires of possession and power, with lust, ambition and duties, which, however honorable, are still of the earth earthy? Even the love for wife and family--the purest as the most unselfish of human affections--is a barrier to _real_ occultism. For whether we take as an example the holy love of a mother for her child, or that of a husband for his wife, even in these feelings, when analysed to the very bottom, and thoroughly sifted, there is still _selfishness_ in the first, and an _égoisme à deux_ in the second instance. What mother would not sacrifice without a moment's hesitation hundreds and thousands of lives for that of the child of her heart? and what lover or true husband would not break the happiness of every other man and woman around him to satisfy the desire of one whom he loves? This is but natural, we shall be told. Quite so; in the light of the code of human affections; less so, in that of divine universal love. For, while the heart is full of thoughts for a little group of _selves_, near and dear to us, how shall the rest of mankind fare in our souls? What percentage of love and care will there remain to bestow on the \"great orphan\"? And how shall the \"still small voice\" make itself heard in a soul entirely occupied with its own privileged tenants? What room is there left for the needs of Humanity _en bloc_ to impress themselves upon, or even receive a speedy response? And yet, he who would profit by the wisdom of the universal mind, has to reach it through _the whole of Humanity_ without distinction of race, complexion, religion or social status. It is _altruism_, not _ego-ism_ even in its most legal and noble conception, that can lead the unit to merge its little Self in the Universal Selves. It is to _these_ needs and to this work that the true disciple of true Occultism has to devote himself, if he would obtain _theo_-sophy, divine Wisdom and Knowledge.  The aspirant has to choose absolutely between the life of the world and the life of Occultism. It is useless and vain to endeavor to unite the two, for no one can serve two masters and satisfy both. No one can serve his body and the higher Soul, and do his family duty and his universal duty, without depriving either one or the other of its rights; for he will either lend his ear to the \"still small voice\" and fail to hear the cries of his little ones, or, he will listen but to the wants of the latter and remain deaf to the voice of Humanity. It would be a ceaseless, a maddening struggle for almost any married man, who would pursue true practical Occultism, instead of its _theoretical_ philosophy. For he would find himself ever hesitating between the voice of the impersonal divine love of Humanity, and that of the personal, terrestrial love. And this could only lead him to fail in one or the other, or perhaps in both his duties. Worse than this; for, _whoever indulges, after having pledged himself to_ OCCULTISM, _in the gratification of a terrestrial love or lust_, must feel an almost immediate result; that of being irresistibly dragged from the impersonal divine state down to the lower plane of matter. Sensual, or even mental self-gratification, involves the immediate loss of the powers of spiritual discernment; the voice of the MASTER can no longer be distinguished from that of one's passions or _even that of a Dugpa_; the right from wrong; sound morality from mere casuistry. The Dead Sea fruit assumes the most glorious mystic appearance, only to turn to ashes on the lips, and to gall in the heart, resulting in:--      Depth ever deepening, darkness darkening still;     Folly for wisdom, guilt for innocence;     Anguish for rapture, and for hope despair.  And once being mistaken and having acted on their mistakes, most men shrink from realizing their error, and thus descend deeper and deeper into the mire. And, although it is the intention that decides primarily whether _white_ or _black_ magic is exercised, yet the results even of involuntary, unconscious sorcery cannot fail to be productive of bad Karma. Enough has been said to show that _sorcery is any kind of evil influence exercised upon other persons, who suffer, or make other persons suffer, in consequence_. Karma is a heavy stone splashed in the quiet waters of Life; and it must produce ever widening circles of ripples, carried wider and wider, almost _ad infinitum_. Such causes produced have to call forth effects, and these are evidenced in the just laws of Retribution.  Much of this may be avoided if people will only abstain from rushing into practices neither the nature nor importance of which they understand. No one is expected to carry a burden beyond his strength and powers. There are \"natural-born magicians\"; Mystics and Occultists by birth, and by right of direct inheritance from a series of incarnations and aeons of suffering and failures. These are passion-proof, so to say. No fires of earthly origin can fan into a flame any of their senses or desires; no human voice can find response in their souls, except the great cry of Humanity. These only may be certain of success. But they can be met only far and wide, and "]]]
