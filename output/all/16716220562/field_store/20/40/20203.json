The enjoyment of a _free and independent people_ can be      accomplished only through this principle: produce what you      consume. Draw from the native elements the necessaries of      life; permit no vitiated taste to lead you into expensive      luxuries, which can only be obtained by involving yourselves      in debt. Let home industry produce every article of home      consumption.\" . .  This Legislature, besides passing a code of laws for the government of the Territory, sent some twenty memorials to Congress, most of them calling for appropriations of public money, and divided up the canyons, ferries, pasture-lands, woodlands, water privileges, and, in fact, all the most valuable portion of the public domain, among prominent \"saints,\" giving always to Brigham the \"lion's\" share. To this he was entitled by his recognized appellation of \"the Lion of the Lord.\"  To this day he holds, by virtue of an Act of the Legislature, the most valuable canyon, near Salt Lake, called City Creek, or Brigham's Canyon,--having taken actual possession of the same, by fencing in the mouth of the canyon completely, and thus preventing all ingress or egress, except upon the payment of toll. General Connor, upon his arrival in Utah, in the fall of 1862, was justly indignant to find himself fenced out from one of the national thoroughfares, but thought it prudent not to add to the causes of irritation by interfering.  During this session Brigham issued eight proclamations. The following is the most celebrated of these _State Papers_:--        \"TERRITORY OF UTAH.       \"_A Proclamation for a Day of Praise and Thanksgiving._       \"It having pleased the Father of all good to make known his      mind and will to the children of men in these last days, and      through the administration of his angels to restore the holy      priesthood unto the sons of Adam, by which the gospel of his      Son has been proclaimed, and the ordinances of life and      salvation are administered; and through which medium the Holy      Ghost has been communicated to believing, willing, and honest      minds; causing faith, wisdom, and intelligence to spring up in      the hearts of men, and influencing them to flow together, from      the four quarters of the earth, to a land of peace and health,      rich in mineral and vegetable resources, reserved of old in      the councils of eternity for the purposes to which it is now      appropriated; a land choice above all other lands; far removed      from the strife, contentions, divisions, moral and physical      commotions, that are disturbing the peace of the nations and      kingdoms of the earth,--       \"I, Brigham Young, Governor of the Territory aforesaid, in      response to the time-honored custom of our fathers at Plymouth      Rock, by the governors of the several States and Territories,      and with a heart filled with humiliation and gratitude to the      Fountain of all good, for his multiplied munificence to his      children, have felt desirous to, and do, _proclaim_ Thursday,      the 1st day of January, eighteen hundred and fifty-two, a _Day      of Praise and Thanksgiving_, for the citizens of this our      peaceful Territory, in honor of the God of Abraham, who has      preserved his children amid all the vicissitudes they have      been called to pass; for his tender mercies in preserving the      nation undivided in which we live; for causing the gospel of      his kingdom to spread and take root upon the earth, beyond the      power of men and demons to destroy; and that he has promised      a day of universal joy and rejoicing to all the inhabitants      who shall remain when the earth shall have been purified by      fire, and rest in peace.       \"And I recommend to all good citizens of Utah, that they      abstain from everything which is calculated to mar or grieve      the Spirit of their Heavenly Father on that day; that they      rise early in the morning of the first day of the new year,      _and wash their bodies with pure water_; that all men attend      to their flocks and herds with carefulness, and see that no      creature in their charge is hungry, thirsty, or cold; while      the women are preparing the best of food for their households,      and their children ready to receive it in cleanliness and      cheerfulness; then let the head of each family with his      family, bow down upon his knees before the God of Israel, and      acknowledge all his sins, and the sins of his household; call      upon the Father, in the name of Jesus, for every blessing that      he desires for himself, his kindred, the Israel of God, the      universe of man; praying with full purpose of heart and united      faith that the union of the United States may be preserved      inviolate, against all the devices of wicked men, until truth      shall reign triumphant, and the glory of Jehovah shall fill      the earth. Then, in the name of Jesus, ask the Father to bless      your food; and when you have filled the plates of your      household, partake with them with rejoicing and thanksgiving;      and if you feel to make merry in your hearts, sing a song of      thanksgiving; and lift up your hearts continually, in peace      and acknowledgment of the unbounded mercies you are      momentarily receiving.       \"I also request of all good and peaceful citizens, that they      abstain from all evil thinking, speaking, and acting, on that      day; that no one be offended by his neighbor; that all jars      and discords cease; that neighborhood broils may be unknown;      that tattlers and strife may not be remembered; that evil      surmising may be forgotten; that all may learn the truth, and      have no need of priests to teach them; that all may be well,      and have no need of doctors; that all may cease their      quarrels, and starve the lawyers; that all may do as they      would be done unto, so that perfect love, which casteth out      all fear, may reign triumphant, and there shall be nothing to      disturb the quiet of an infant in all the Territory of Utah;      that there be no contention in the land; and that the same      peace may extend its influence to the utmost bounds of the      everlasting hills, and from thence to the habitation of every      man and beast, to the ends of the earth; till the leopard      shall lie down with the kid, the lion shall eat straw like the      ox, and the babe shall lay his hand upon the cockatrice's den,      and find peace to its soul.       \"I further request, that when the day has been spent in doing      good, in dealing your bread, your butter, your beef and your      pork, your turkeys, your molasses, and the choicest of all the      products of the valleys of the mountains, at your command, to      the poor; that you end the day in the same order, and on the      same principle that you commenced it; that you eat your supper      with singleness of heart, as unto the Lord, after praise and      thanksgiving, and songs of rejoicing; remembering that you      cannot be filled with the Holy Spirit, and be preparing for      celestial glory, while the meanest menial under your charge or      control is in want of the smallest thing which God has given      you power to supply; remembering that it is dependent on you      for its comforts, as you are dependent on your God for your      constant support.       \"Retire to your beds early, that you may be refreshed, and      rise early again, and so continue, until times and seasons are      changed; or finally, I say unto you, let the same process be      continued from day to day, until you arrive unto one of the      days of Kolob, [where a day is 1000 of our years,] the planet      nearest to the habitation of the Eternal Father; and if you do      not find peace and rest to your souls by that time, in the      practice of these things, and no one else shall present      himself to offer you better counsel, _I will be there_, and      knowing more, will tell you what you ought to do next.       [SEAL.]       \"Done at the Executive Office, Great Salt Lake      City. In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my      hand and caused the seal of the Territory to be      affixed, this 19th day of December, A. D. 1851, and      of the Independence of the United States the      seventy-sixth.       \"By the Governor,           BRIGHAM YOUNG.       \"W. RICHARDS, _Sec. pro tem., appointed by the Governor_.\"  Amidst the verbosity of this singular document will be seen expressions of attachment to the Federal Union. The sincerity of these professions must be judged of in the light of his contemporaneous acts. The officers appointed by the General Government were then in the States, or at Washington, representing truly the condition of things in Utah, and the conduct of Brigham and his associates, which effectually obliged them to leave the Territory, by rendering their presence in Utah not only useless but dangerous. It is for our readers to say how much weight is to be given to that portion of the fulmination of the Prophet put forth under such circumstances.  At this first session of the Legislature, Brigham proceeded to give, in his Message, his views in relation to African slavery, fully indorsing it, and prescribing regulations for its establishment in the Territory. His views upon this subject may be gathered from the following extract:--       \"Thus while servitude may and should exist, and that too upon      those who are naturally designed to occupy the position of      servant of servants, yet we should not fall into the other      extreme, and make them as beasts of the field, regarding not      the humanity that is in the colored race; nor elevating them,      as some seem disposed, to an equality with those whom"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44414"],["title","The Mormon Prophet and His Harem (#5)"],["body","and nature's God has indicated to be their masters, their      superiors.\"  In accordance with the foregoing suggestions, the Legislature passed a law regulating slavery in the Territory, and it has existed in full force and effect to the present time. There are now a considerable number of African slaves in the Territory, and a large number of Indians, \"held to service.\"  During the same session, the Legislature memorialized the President, setting forth that the federal officers had abandoned the Territory; reciting the formation of the provisional government of Deseret, and complaining that \"all the authorities of the Territory, including the governor and both houses of the Assembly, and marshal, had been set at naught as exercising their functions illegally and unconstitutionally.\"  The causes which led to this petition were as follows:--  When the Territory was organized, in the winter of 1850-51, the following named officers were appointed:--Brigham Young, Governor; Lemuel C. Brandenburg, Chief Justice; Perry E. Brochus and Zerubbabel Snow, Associate Justices; Seth M. Blair, Attorney General, and B. D. Harris, Secretary. These officers did not arrive in Utah until July, 1851. Previous to their arrival, Brigham Young had issued a proclamation ordering an election for delegate to Congress and members of the Legislature, and providing for taking the census.  The Secretary considered that Young had exceeded his authority, and on this ground refused to pay over the moneys in his hands for the expenses of the Legislature.  The Supreme Court being then in session, Harris applied to the court for an injunction to stay the proceedings of the Legislature, which the court granted. This order, however, was nugatory, as the court had no power to enforce its judgments. This, of course, enraged the Mormons; and the Governor instructed Blair, the District Attorney, who was a Mormon, to sue out a writ of injunction upon the Secretary, to prevent him from taking the money out of the Territory. The court decided against the injunction, thus again sustaining the Secretary.  Again, Congress had appropriated $20,000 for the erection of suitable buildings at the capital of the Territory. Brigham and his tools, the members of the Legislature, attempted to appropriate this money, and in exchange, palm off upon the government, for $20,000, a building which never cost over $8,000.  These circumstances engendered much feeling between the Mormons and the gentile officers; and this was in nowise lessened by an incident which occurred about this time.  Hon. Perry E. Brochus, one of the Supreme Judges, in some remarks made in a Mormon assembly, commented rather severely upon the peculiar institution. He commenced by addressing the women upon the subject of spiritual wife-ism; pointing out to them its wickedness and the unhappy results that must follow to them and to their children, if the practice should be persisted in. He said it was against the laws of man and God. This was undoubtedly the first time, at Salt Lake, that a gentile had ever spoken in public against Mormon institutions.  The women were excited; the most of them were in tears, before he had spoken many minutes. The men were astonished and enraged, and one word of encouragement from their leader would have brought on a collision. Brigham, with his usual shrewdness, saw this, and was equal to the occasion. When the Judge sat down, he rose, and by one of those strong, nervous appeals, for which he is so famous among his brethren, restored the equilibrium of the audience. Those who, but a moment before, were bathed in tears, now responded to his broad sarcasm and keen wit, in screams of laughter; and having fully restored the spirits of the audience, he turned to the Judge, and administered the following rebuke: \"I will kick you,\" he said, \"or any other gentile Judge from this stand, if you or they again attempt to interfere with the affairs of our Zion.\"  The Judge saw that he was beaten, and finding his life threatened and in danger, soon after left the Territory.  After his departure, Brigham preached the following sermon:--       \"I am at the defiance of the rulers of the greatest nations on      the earth, with the United States all put together, to produce      a more loyal people than the Latter Day Saints. Have they, as      a people, broken any law? No, they have not. Have the United      States? Yes. They have trampled the Constitution under their      feet with impunity, and ridden recklessly over all law, to      persecute and drive this people. Admit, for argument's sake,      that the Mormon elders have more wives than one, yet our      enemies never have proved it. If I had forty wives in the      United States, they did not know it, and could not      substantiate it; neither did I ask any lawyer, judge, or      magistrate for them. I live above law, and so do this people.      Do the laws of the United States require us to crouch and bow      down to the miserable wretches who violate them? No!       \"I defy the world to prove that we have infringed upon that      law. You may circumscribe the whole earth, and pass through      every Christian nation, so called, and what do you find? If      you tell them a 'Mormon' has two wives, they are shocked, and      call it dreadful blasphemy. If you whisper such a thing in the      ears of a gentile, who takes a fresh woman every night, he is      thunderstruck with the enormity of the crime. . . . .       \"Now, let me tell you the great, killing story. 'Governor      Young has sixteen wives and fourteen babies.' Now, they did      not see that sight, but the circumstance was as follows: I      took some of my neighbors into the large carriage, and rode      down to Father Chase's to eat watermelons. When driving out of      the gate, in the evening, Brother Babbitt walks up, and I      invited him into the carriage, and he rode up into the city      with me, and I suppose he told the United States officers.      That, I believe, is the way the story of the sixteen wives and      fourteen children first came into circulation.       \"But this does not begin to be the extent of my possessions,      for I am enlarging on the right hand and on the left; and      shall soon be able, Abraham-like, to muster the strength of my      house, and _take my rights_, asking no favors of judges or      secretaries.\"  At another time he used the following language:--       \"When the officers returned from this Territory to the States,      did we send them away? We did not. I will tell you what I did,      and what I will do again. I did chastise the poor, mean      ruffian,--the poor, miserable creature who came here by the      name of Brochus,--when he arose before this people, to preach      to them, and tell them of meanness which he supposed they were      guilty of, and traduce their characters.       \"It is true, as it is said in the report of these officers, if      I had crooked my little finger he would have been used up. But      I did not bend it. If I had, the sisters alone felt indignant      enough to have chopped him in pieces. I did not do it,      however, but suffered him to fill up the measure of his shame      and iniquity, until his cup is running over.       \"I have no fears whatever of Franklin Pierce excusing me from      office, and saying that another man shall be the Governor of      this Territory. At the beginning of our settlements, when we      sent Almon W. Babbitt to Washington with our constitution for      a State government, and to ask leave to adopt it, he requested      that I should not sign my name to it as Governor; 'for,' said      he, 'if you do, it will thwart all our plans.' I said, 'My      name will go as it is in that document, and stay there, from      this time henceforth and forever. Now,' I continued, 'if you      do not believe it, you may go to Washington, and give those      papers to Dr. Bernheisel, and operate against him, and against      our getting a State government, and you cannot hinder it.'       \"I will be Governor still, after you have done everything you      possibly can to prevent it. We have got a Territorial      Government, and I am and will be Governor, and no power can      hinder it, until the Lord Almighty says, 'Brigham, you need      not be Governor any longer;' and then I am willing to yield to      another Governor.\"  This \"sermon\" was preached at Great Salt Lake City, June 19, 1853, and is published in the \"Journal of Discourses,\" vol. i. p. 188.  Brigham had appointed his second counsellor, Willard Richards, to fill the vacancy occasioned by the departure of Secretary Harris. So the saints had fairly succeeded in ridding themselves of the obnoxious officials,--the remaining Judge, and the District Attorney, being Mormons in good standing.  The Hon. Z. Snow then proceeded to hold his court, unmolested by gentile law or judges. He tried and convicted several Spaniards of buying Indian children for slaves, took the children from the Spaniards, and turned them over to the \"brethren.\"  The Indians now began to be hostile, and the brethren were obliged to cease pursuing the gentiles, and prepare to defend themselves against the \"Lamanites.\" During the years 1852-53-54, more or less disturbances prevailed.  In October, 1852, Judge Shaver arrived, as successor to Judge Brochus; and Lazarus H. Reed, of New York, was appointed Chief Justice, to succeed Judge Brandenburg. Judge Reed arrived in the Territory in June, 1853. Of these, Brigham said,--       \"One of our judges, Judge Shaver, has been here during the      winter, and, as far as he is known, he is a straightforward,      judicious, upright man, and a good adjudicator in the law. He      and Judge Reed, who has lately arrived, I believe will do the      best they can, and all is right.\"  Judge Snow continued to hold his office until succeeded by Judge Stiles, in the fall of 1854.
