Why, O Jolly One, did you fall into my hole? I wanted to catch your mother or one of your uncles.”  “Guk-uk-uk-uk!” laughed Keo. “You must let me go, after all, black man; for I am of no use to you!”  “That I will not do,” declared Gouie; “unless,” he added, as an afterthought, “you will make a bargain with me.”  “Let me hear about the bargain, black one, for I am hungry,” said Keo.  “I will let your go if you swear by the tusks of your grandfather that you will return to me in a year and a day and become my prisoner again.”  The youthful hippopotamus paused to think, for he knew it was a solemn thing to swear by the tusks of his grandfather; but he was exceedingly hungry, and a year and a day seemed a long time off; so he said, with another careless laugh:  “Very well; if you will now let me go I swear by the tusks of my grandfather to return to you in a year and a day and become your prisoner.”  Gouie was much pleased, for he knew that in a year and a day Keo would be almost full grown. So he began digging away one end of the pit and filling it up with the earth until he had made an incline which would allow the hippopotamus to climb out.  Keo was so pleased when he found himself upon the surface of the earth again that he indulged in a merry fit of laughter, after which he said:  “Good-by, Gouie; in a year and a day you will see me again.”  Then he waddled away toward the river to see his mother and get his breakfast, and Gouie returned to his village.  During the months that followed, as the black man lay in his hut or hunted in the forest, he heard at times the faraway “Guk-uk-uk-uk!” of the laughing hippopotamus. But he only smiled to himself and thought: “A year and a day will soon pass away!”  Now when Keo returned to his mother safe and well every member of his tribe was filled with joy, for the Jolly One was a general favorite. But when he told them that in a year and a day he must again become the slave of the black man, they began to wail and weep, and so many were their tears that the river rose several inches.  Of course Keo only laughed at their sorrow; but a great meeting of the tribe was called and the matter discussed seriously.  “Having sworn by the tusks of his grandfather,” said Uncle Nikki, “he must keep his promise. But it is our duty to try in some way to rescue him from death or a life of slavery.”  To this all agreed, but no one could think of any method of saving Keo from his fate. So months passed away, during which all the royal hippopotamuses were sad and gloomy except the Jolly One himself.  Finally but a week of freedom remained to Keo, and his mother, the queen, became so nervous and worried that another meeting of the tribe was called. By this time the laughing hippopotamus had grown to enormous size, and measured nearly fifteen feet long and six feet high, while his sharp tusks were whiter and harder than those of an elephant.  “Unless something is done to save my child,” said the mother, “I shall die of grief.”  Then some of her relations began to make foolish suggestions; but presently Uncle Nep, a wise and very big hippopotamus, said:  “We must go to Glinkomok and implore his aid.”  Then all were silent, for it was a bold thing to face the mighty Glinkomok. But the mother’s love was equal to any heroism.  “I will myself go to him, if Uncle Nep will accompany me,” she said, quickly.  Uncle Nep thoughtfully patted the soft mud with his fore foot and wagged his short tail leisurely from side to side.  “We have always been obedient to Glinkomok, and shown him great respect,” said he. “Therefore I fear no danger in facing him. I will go with you.”  All the others snorted approval, being very glad they were not called upon to go themselves.  So the queen and Uncle Nep, with Keo swimming between them, set out upon their journey. They swam up the river all that day and all the next, until they came at sundown to a high, rocky wall, beneath which was the cave where the mighty Glinkomok dwelt.  This fearful creature was part beast, part man, part fowl and part fish. It had lived since the world began. Through years of wisdom it had become part sorcerer, part wizard, part magician and part fairy. Mankind knew it not, but the ancient beasts knew and feared it.  The three hippopotamuses paused before the cave, with their front feet upon the bank and their bodies in the water, and called in chorus a greeting to Glinkomok. Instantly thereafter the mouth of the cave darkened and the creature glided silently toward them.  The hippopotamuses were afraid to look upon it, and bowed their heads between their legs.  “We come, O Glinkomok, to implore your mercy and friendly assistance!” began Uncle Nep; and then he told the story of Keo’s capture, and how he had promised to return to the black man.  “He must keep his promise,” said the creature, in a voice that sounded like a sigh.  The mother hippopotamus groaned aloud.  “But I will prepare him to overcome the black man, and to regain his liberty,” continued Glinkomok.  Keo laughed.  “Lift your right paw,” commanded Glinkomok. Keo obeyed, and the creature touched it with its long, hairy tongue. Then it held four skinny hands over Keo’s bowed head and mumbled some words in a language unknown to man or beast or fowl or fish. After this it spoke again in hippopotamese:  “Your skin has now become so tough that no man can hurt you. Your strength is greater than that of ten elephants. Your foot is so swift that you can distance the wind. Your wit is sharper than the bulthorn. Let the man fear, but drive fear from your own breast forever; for of all your race you are the mightiest!”  Then the terrible Glinkomok leaned over, and Keo felt its fiery breath scorch him as it whispered some further instructions in his ear. The next moment it glided back into its cave, followed by the loud thanks of the three hippopotamuses, who slid into the water and immediately began their journey home.  The mother’s heart was full of joy; Uncle Nep shivered once or twice as he remembered a glimpse he had caught of Glinkomok; but Keo was as jolly as possible, and, not content to swim with his dignified elders, he dived under their bodies, raced all around them and laughed merrily every inch of the way home.  Then all the tribe held high jinks and praised the mighty Glinkomok for befriending their queen’s son. And when the day came for the Jolly One to give himself up to the black man they all kissed him good-by without a single fear for his safety.  Keo went away in good spirits, and they could hear his laughing “guk-uk-uk-uk!” long after he was lost in sight in the jungle.  Gouie had counted the days and knew when to expect Keo; but he was astonished at the monstrous size to which his captive had grown, and congratulated himself on the wise bargain he had made. And Keo was so fat that Gouie determined to eat him—that is, all of him he possibly could, and the remainder of the carcass he would trade off to his fellow villagers.  So he took a knife and tried to stick it into the hippopotamus, but the skin was so tough the knife was blunted against it. Then he tried other means; but Keo remained unhurt.  And now indeed the Jolly One laughed his most gleeful laugh, till all the forest echoed the “guk-uk-uk-uk-uk!” And Gouie decided not to kill him, since that was impossible, but to use him for a beast of burden. He mounted upon Keo’s back and commanded him to march. So Keo trotted briskly through the village, his little eyes twinkling with merriment.  The other blacks were delighted with Gouie’s captive, and begged permission to ride upon the Jolly One’s back. So Gouie bargained with them for bracelets and shell necklaces and little gold ornaments, until he had acquired quite a heap of trinkets. Then a dozen black men climbed upon Keo’s back to enjoy a ride, and the one nearest his nose cried out:  “Run, Mud-dog—run!”  And Keo ran. Swift as the wind he strode, away from the village, through the forest and straight up the river bank. The black men howled with fear; the Jolly One roared with laughter; and on, on, on they rushed!  Then before them, on the opposite side of the river, appeared the black mouth of Glinkomok’s cave. Keo dashed into the water, dived to the bottom and left the black people struggling to swim out. But Glinkomok had heard the laughter of Keo and knew what to do. When the Jolly One rose to the surface and blew the water from his throat there was no black man to be seen.  Keo returned alone to the village, and Gouie asked, with surprise:  “Where are my brothers:”  “I do not know,” answered Keo. “I took them far away, and they remained where I left them.”  Gouie would have asked more questions then, but another crowd of black men impatiently waited to ride on the back of the laughing hippopotamus. So they paid the price and climbed to their seats, after which the foremost said:  “Run, mud-wallower—run!”  And Keo ran as before and carried them to the mouth of Glinkomok’s cave, and returned alone.  But now Gouie became anxious to know the fate of his fellows, for he was the only black man left in his village. So he mounted the hippopotamus and cried:  “Run, river-hog—run!”  Keo laughed his jolly “guk-uk-uk-uk!” and ran with the speed of the wind. But this time he made straight for the river bank where his own tribe lived, and when he reached it he waded into the river, dived to the bottom and left Gouie floating in the middle of the stream.  The black man began swimming toward the right bank, but there he saw Uncle Nep and half the royal tribe waiting to stamp him into the soft mud. So he turned toward the left bank, and there stood the queen mother and Uncle Nikki, red-eyed and angry, waiting to tear him with their tusks.  Then Gouie uttered loud screams of terror, and, spying the Jolly One, who swam near him, he cried:  “Save me, Keo! Save me, and I will release you from slavery!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4358"],["title","The Sea Fairies (#0)"],["body","JUDITH OF RANDOLPH MASSACHUSETTS     THE SEA FAIRIES  BY L. FRANK BAUM  AUTHOR OF THE EMERALD CITY OF OZ, DOROTHY AND THE WIZARD IN OZ, OZMA OF OZ, THE ROAD TO OZ, THE LAND OF OZ, ETC.   ILLUSTRATED BY JOHN R. NEILL      THE oceans are big and broad. I believe two-thirds of the earth's surface is covered with water. What people inhabit this water has always been a subject of curiosity to the inhabitants of the land. Strange creatures come from the seas at times, and perhaps in the ocean depths are many, more strange than mortal eye has ever gazed upon.  This story is fanciful. In it the sea people talk and act much as we do, and the mermaids especially are not unlike the fairies with whom we have learned to be familiar. Yet they are real sea people, for all that, and with the exception of Zog the Magician they are all supposed to exist in the ocean's depths.  I am told that some very learned people deny that mermaids or sea-serpents have ever inhabited the oceans, but it would be very difficult for them to prove such an assertion unless they had lived under the water as Trot and Cap'n Bill did in this story.  I hope my readers who have so long followed Dorothy's adventures in the Land of Oz will be interested in Trot's equally strange experiences. The ocean has always appealed to me as a veritable wonderland, and this story has been suggested to me many times by my young correspondents in their letters. Indeed, a good many children have implored me to \"write something about the mermaids,\" and I have willingly granted the request.  Hollywood, 1911.  L. FRANK BAUM.

They were seated on a bench built around a giant acacia tree that grew just at the edge of the bluff. Below them rolled the blue waves of the great Pacific. A little way behind them was the house, a neat frame cottage painted white and surrounded by huge eucalyptus and pepper trees. Still farther behind that--a quarter of a mile distant but built upon a bend of the coast--was the village, overlooking a pretty bay.  Cap'n Bill and Trot came often to this tree to sit and watch the ocean below them. The sailor man had one \"meat leg\" and one \"hickory leg,\" and he often said the wooden one was the best of the two. Once Cap'n Bill had commanded and owned the \"Anemone,\" a trading schooner that plied along the coast; and in those days Charlie Griffiths, who was Trot's father, had been the Captain's mate. But ever since Cap'n Bill's accident, when he lost his leg, Charlie Griffiths had been the captain of the little schooner while his old master lived peacefully ashore with the Griffiths family.  This was about the time Trot was born, and the old sailor became very fond of the baby girl. Her real name was Mayre, but when she grew big enough to walk, she took so many busy little steps every day that both her mother and Cap'n Bill nicknamed her \"Trot,\" and so she was thereafter mostly called.  It was the old sailor who taught the child to love the sea, to love it almost as much as he and her father did, and these two, who represented the \"beginning and the end of life,\" became firm friends and constant companions.  \"Why hasn't anybody seen a mermaid and lived?\" asked Trot again.  \"'Cause mermaids is fairies, an' ain't meant to be seen by us mortal folk,\" replied Cap'n Bill.  \"But if anyone happens to see 'em, what then, Cap'n?\"  \"Then,\" he answered, slowly wagging his head, \"the mermaids give 'em a smile an' a wink, an' they dive into the water an' gets drownded.\"  \"S'pose they knew how to swim, Cap'n Bill?\"  \"That don't make any diff'rence, Trot. The mermaids live deep down, an' the poor mortals never come up again.\"  The little girl was thoughtful for a moment. \"But why do folks dive in the water when the mermaids smile an' wink?\" she asked.  \"Mermaids,\" he said gravely, \"is the most beautiful creatures in the world--or the water, either. You know what they're like, Trot, they's got a lovely lady's form down to the waist, an' then the other half of 'em's a fish, with green an' purple an' pink scales all down it.\"  \"Have they got arms, Cap'n Bill?\"  \"'Course, Trot; arms like any other lady. An' pretty faces that smile an' look mighty sweet an' fetchin'. Their hair is long an' soft an' silky, an' floats all around 'em in the water. When they comes up atop the waves, they wring the water out'n their hair and sing songs that go right to your heart. If anybody is unlucky enough to be 'round jes' then, the beauty o' them mermaids an' their sweet songs charm 'em like magic; so's they plunge into the waves to get to the mermaids. But the mermaids haven't any hearts, Trot, no more'n a fish has; so they laughs when the poor people drown an' don't care a fig. That's why I says, an' I says it true, that nobody never sawr a mermaid an' lived to tell the tale.\"  \"Nobody?\" asked Trot.  \"Nobody a tall.\"  \"Then how do you know, Cap'n Bill?\" asked the little girl, looking up into his face with big, round eyes.  Cap'n Bill coughed. Then he tried to sneeze, to gain time. Then he took out his red cotton handkerchief and wiped his bald head with it, rubbing hard so as to make him think clearer. \"Look, Trot; ain't that a brig out there?\" he inquired, pointing to a sail far out in the sea.  \"How does anybody know about mermaids if those who have seen them never lived to tell about them?\" she asked again.  \"Know what about 'em, Trot?\"  \"About their green and pink scales and pretty songs and wet hair.\"  \"They don't know, I guess. But mermaids jes' natcherly has to be like that, or they wouldn't be mermaids.\"  She thought this over. \"Somebody MUST have lived, Cap'n Bill,\" she declared positively. \"Other fairies have been seen by mortals; why not mermaids?\"  \"P'raps they have, Trot, p'raps they have,\" he answered musingly. \"I'm tellin' you as it was told to me, but I never stopped to inquire into the matter so close before. Seems like folks wouldn't know so much about mermaids if they hadn't seen 'em; an' yet accordin' to all accounts the victim is bound to get drownded.\"  \"P'raps,\" suggested Trot softly, \"someone found a fotygraph of one of 'em.\"  \"That might o' been, Trot, that might o' been,\" answered Cap'n Bill.  A nice man was Cap'n Bill, and Trot knew he always liked to explain everything so she could fully understand it. The aged sailor was not a very tall man, and some people might have called him chubby, or even fat. He wore a blue sailor shirt with white anchors worked on the corners of the broad, square collar, and his blue trousers were very wide at the bottom. He always wore one trouser leg over his wooden limb and sometimes it would flutter in the wind like a flag because it was so wide and the wooden leg so slender. His rough kersey coat was a pea-jacket and came down to his waistline. In the big pockets of his jacket he kept a wonderful jackknife, and his pipe and tobacco, and many bits of string, and matches and keys and lots of other things. Whenever Cap'n Bill thrust a chubby hand into one of his pockets, Trot watched him with breathless interest, for she never knew what he was going to pull out.  The old sailor's face was brown as a berry. He had a fringe of hair around the back of his head and a fringe of whisker around the edge of his face, running from ear to ear and underneath his chin. His eyes were light blue and kind in expression. His nose was big and broad, and his few teeth were not strong enough to crack nuts with.  Trot liked Cap'n Bill and had a great deal of confidence in his wisdom, and a great admiration for his ability to make tops and whistles and toys with that marvelous jackknife of his. In the village were many boys and girls of her own age, but she never had as much fun playing with them as she had wandering by the sea accompanied by the old sailor and listening to his fascinating stories.  She knew all about the Flying Dutchman, and Davy Jones' Locker, and Captain Kidd, and how to harpoon a whale or dodge an iceberg or lasso a seal. Cap'n Bill had been everywhere in the world, almost, on his many voyages. He had been wrecked on desert islands like Robinson Crusoe and been attacked by cannibals, and had a host of other exciting adventures. So he was a delightful comrade for the little girl, and whatever Cap'n Bill knew Trot was sure to know in time.  \"How do the mermaids live?\" she asked. \"Are they in caves, or just in the water like fishes, or how?\"  \"Can't say, Trot,\" he replied. \"I've asked divers about that, but none of 'em ever run acrost a mermaid's nest yet, as I've heard of.\"  \"If they're fairies,\" she said, \"their homes must be very pretty.\"  \"Mebbe so, Trot, but damp. They are sure to be damp, you know.\"  \"I'd like to see a mermaid, Cap'n Bill,\" said the child earnestly.  \"What, an' git drownded?\" he exclaimed.  \"No, and live to tell the tale. If they're beautiful, and laughing, and sweet, there can't be much harm in them, I'm sure.\"  \"Mermaids is mermaids,\" remarked Cap'n Bill in his most solemn voice. \"It wouldn't do us any good to mix up with 'em, Trot.\"  \"May-re! May-re!\" called a voice from the house.  \"Yes, Mamma!\"  \"You an' Cap'n Bill come in to supper.\""]]]
