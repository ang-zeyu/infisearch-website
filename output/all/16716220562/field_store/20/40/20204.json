He was a Southerner by birth, agreed very well with the Mormons, gave suppers, and drank with them, and was considered a \"hail-fellow well met.\" There was, however, some difficulty between the Judge and the Prophet, the nature of which was not distinctly known. The difficulty increased, and one morning the Judge was found dead in his bed. The heads of the church took great pains to have the affair investigated, and came to the conclusion that the Judge had died of some \"disease of the head.\" He was followed to the grave by a large concourse of people, and preceded by a band of music.  Less regard would be paid to these invidious reports, were it not for the fact that Brigham Young's connection with the violent death of divers other persons is too notorious to be denied. To say nothing of the Mountain Meadow massacre, in which he is distinctly implicated by evidence of an overwhelming character, there are other cases in which his agency in causing in some way the death of the party, is scarcely denied by himself.  For instance, the death of Almon W. Babbitt, at the hands of \"Indians,\" on the Plains. In the summer of 1862, Brigham was referring to this affair, in a tea-table conversation, at which Judge Waite and the writer of this were present. On that occasion, after making some remarks to impress upon the minds of those present the necessity of maintaining friendly relations between the federal officers and the authorities of the church, he used language substantially as follows:--       \"There is no need of any difficulty, and there need be none,      if the officers do their duty, and mind their own affairs. If      they do not, if they undertake to interfere in affairs that do      not concern them, I will not be far off. _There was Almon W.      Babbitt. He undertook to quarrel with me, but soon afterwards      was killed by Indians._ He lived like a fool, and died like a      fool.\"  People determined to believe only that Brigham Young is a good citizen, and that he and his people are mostly in the right in their difficulties with the federal officers, will doubtless be able to put an innocent construction upon the foregoing language. But to the minds of those who heard it, and who were most interested in its meaning, it never had but one signification, and went far to disclose the dark and damning character of the man.  But to return to our narrative. Judge Reed seems to have been more fortunate in his intercourse with these people. The Mormons wished to eradicate from his mind all unfavorable impressions created by the sudden departure of his predecessors. They therefore treated him with marked consideration. They hoped, through his influence, to reinstate themselves with the authorities at Washington, and they partially succeeded. The Judge formed quite a favorable opinion of the Mormons, though not indorsing the administration of Brigham Young. He remained in the valley about a year, and then went to the States, intending to return, but died suddenly, while at his home, in Bath, Steuben County, New York.     CHAPTER III.  POLITICAL HISTORY CONTINUED.       Col. Steptoe and Brigham Young.--Brigham reappointed Governor.      --John F. Kinney.--Western Utah, or Nevada.--Letter of Hon.      James M. Crane.--Judge Stiles and the Records.--W. W. Drummond.   In 1854 Col. Steptoe, with about 300 men, came to Salt Lake. His command was intended for California and Oregon, but spent the winter of 1854-55 at Salt Lake City.  About this time John F. Kinney, of Iowa, was appointed Chief Justice, to succeed Reed, and George P. Stiles, Associate Justice; Joseph Hollman, also of Iowa, Attorney-General, and Almon W. Babbitt, Secretary. In the spring of 1855, W. W. Drummond, of Illinois, was appointed Associate Justice.  During the winter of 1854-55, news reached Salt Lake that President Pierce had commissioned Col. Steptoe as Governor of Utah. This alarmed the saints exceedingly. The Lion of the Lord was roused. Something must be done.  Col. Steptoe had the appointment under consideration for several weeks, and finally _refused to accept it_, and joined with Chief Justice Kinney and others in recommending the continuance in office of Governor Young.  The question naturally arises, Why did Col. Steptoe refuse to accept the appointment, and recommend Brigham Young? Mormons would tell you, in confidence, that Brigham \"put a hook in his nose,\" and he was compelled to do as he did. The Prophet of the Lord had said he would be Governor, and no power but the Lord Almighty could hinder it.  Daring and unscrupulous as a brigand, having the means at his command, and the ingenuity to use them, why should he not outwit the government and deceive the people of the United States? He was determined not to relinquish, without an effort to retain them, the power and emoluments of his position. The following narrative of the manner in which he accomplished his purposes, has been furnished by a Mormon who was residing in Salt Lake City at the time, and the employment of similar appliances on more than one occasion afterward, gives the coloring of truth to the story.  There were in Salt Lake City, at that time, two beautiful and fascinating women, one of whom was by marriage nearly related to the Prophet; the other was an actress in the church theatre. Their husbands were both \"on a mission.\" These ladies were a great deal in the society of Col. Steptoe and his officers. Much attention was paid to the military officers, and it would be but natural that these men should be both pleased and flattered by the attention of sisters occupying so high a place in the hierarchy. According to report, however, the character of these women was not such as their exalted position in the church would seem to require.  One evening Brigham called \"the girls\" to him, and explained that he had a plan in which he needed their assistance. They at once consented to do anything he might desire. The plan was soon agreed upon. He placed his Danites at a convenient distance around the Colonel's office, and calmly awaited developments. In a short time one of the \"police\" came to the Prophet, and signified that it was time for him to appear on the field. He went immediately down to the Colonel's office, which was on Main Street, and knocked for admittance. For some time no one responded, but the knocking continuing violently, Col. Steptoe asked who was there. \"Brigham Young,\" said the angry Prophet; \"and I want to come in, and I will come in.\" At this Steptoe opened the door, and Brigham entered the front office. He seemed excited, and without being seated, asked if Mary and Mrs. ---- were there; adding,--\"I want the girls.\" Steptoe denied their presence; but could a prophet be deceived? \"I know better,\" said he; \"I know they are here;\" at the same time walking into the back office. There, on the sofa, sat two young gentlemen dressed in the highest style, but wearing their hats. Brigham advanced, lifted the hats of the fancy gentlemen, and the ladies he was seeking sat before him. Of course, the righteous indignation of the Prophet knew no bounds. He threatened Steptoe with exposure and prosecution, and told him his life would not be safe if the friends of the ladies came to hear of the affair. He censured the girls, and told them to go home, and finally calmed down, and left the office.  Steptoe was greatly alarmed, and, as a compromise, offered to recommend Brigham for the appointment which had just been tendered to himself. With ill-concealed satisfaction on the part of Brigham and his friends, the proposition was accepted, and \"the matter arranged.\"  Soon after, a petition was sent to the President, dated December 30, 1854, and asking for the reappointment of Young as Governor. This was signed by Col. Steptoe and most of his officers, and by all the federal officers then in Utah.  This array of gentile names was not to be disregarded, and Brigham Young was reappointed Governor of Utah.  In 1854 John F. Kinney was appointed, by Franklin Pierce, Chief Justice of Utah, and came to the valley with his family and a large stock of goods the same year. He was known in Iowa as a \"Jack Mormon,\" and subsequent events have proven that he was such. He sold goods and kept a boarding-house; and at once entered into favor with the Mormon administration. He was pecuniarily interested in keeping the good-will of his trading customers; and this fact, together with his undoubted sympathy with the church, will satisfactorily account for the course pursued by him in the complicated condition of the Territory.  It is not our purpose to detract from the merits of any one. We desire to do justice to all. But the impartial truth of history requires us to say that the uniform course of Judge Kinney has been to aid and abet Brigham Young in his ambitious schemes, with but little regard to the advancement of the interests of the whole country, or the requirements of indiscriminate justice.  As to his merits as a jurist, the writer of these pages cannot undertake to decide. But it would seem, to one uninitiated, that a Judge cannot be very profound who will try, convict, and sentence men not within the jurisdiction of his court, and even men not in the land of the living. This was done by Judge Kinney, in the case of the Morrisites,--dissenters or apostates from the Mormon Church.  In the spring of 1863 a large number of these men were tried, convicted, and fined $100 each. Many of them were out of the Territory at the time, and one was dead. This statement is fully substantiated by affidavits which were taken at the time. Over ninety were tried and convicted, about twenty of whom were out of the Territory, and one had died before the trial commenced.  When the cases were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44414"],["title","The Mormon Prophet and His Harem (#7)"],["body","on for trial, it was stated that some of the accused were absent. The Judge remarked, it made no difference; he was gratified that so many had made their appearance, and directed the trial to proceed. All were found guilty, and sentenced to pay a fine of $100 each, except a few of the leaders, who were sentenced to the penitentiary,--one of them for fifteen years.  These men were accused of resisting the Mormon officers who came to arrest them. Robert T. Burton, the sheriff of Salt Lake County, who was the principal one thus \"resisted,\" had shot Morris, their Prophet, in cold blood, after he and his party had surrendered; and yet, while the Morrisites were so severely punished, Burton went scot free. The grand jury of Salt Lake County would not even find a bill of indictment against him. Burton stands high in the community, and was afterwards appointed Collector of Internal Revenue.  But this is not all. Not only were all of the accused tried and convicted, but the bonds of those absent were declared _by the clerk_ to be forfeited, and execution was issued against those resident in Utah, to collect the penalty of the bonds. At the same time, _the records showed no judgments against the delinquents_. One of these Morrisites, named Abraham Taylor, found his property, worth $2500, suddenly levied upon, under one of these executions. There being no gentile lawyer at Salt Lake, he applied to Judge Waite, who investigated the matter, and found there was no judgment of record. He then advised Mr. Taylor to apply to Judge Kinney for an injunction against the officer. This was done; but the application was refused by Judge K. _on the ground that if there was no judgment he could render one, as the court had not permanently adjourned, but only to meet on his own motion_. This response to the application of a suitor is a sufficient indication of the ability of Judge Kinney, and of his desire to administer impartial justice.  The result of the whole matter was, that the homestead of Mr. Taylor was sold under the execution, _to the clerk of Judge Kinney's court, for $200_; the family of Taylor impoverished, and literally turned into the street. After remaining out of doors, in front of the house, for a day or two, they took refuge at the camp of Gen. Connor.  In his personal appearance Judge Kinney is pompous and conceited. He is of the medium size, rather stout, with dark complexion. Brusque and ready in conversation, and never declining to drink when invited, he is well adapted to the country in which he resides, and is immensely popular in the community in which he was placed \"to administer the law,\" and which he now represents in Congress. He is an open apologist and advocate of polygamy.  Mrs. Kinney is a sister of Judge Hall, of Iowa, and an accomplished lady. She was utterly disgusted with Mormon society, and returned, with her daughters, to the States.  Judge Kinney remained in Utah until 1856. In 1860 he was reappointed. Thus he was absent from the Territory during all the exciting scenes of 1857-8 and 9, and returned after something like harmony had been restored in the affairs of the Territory. He managed, however, by having his leave of absence extended from time to time, to retain the office and its emoluments until 1858. Since 1860 he has been back and forth, spending about half his time in either portion of the country, but retaining his position as Chief Justice, until elected to Congress in 1863.  Judge Stiles, who was appointed to succeed Snow, was assigned to the third, or Carson District. He immediately proceeded to his district, and held a term of court.  The present Territory of Nevada was included mostly in the third judicial district, and much difficulty occurred between Mormons and the miners in that section.  A full account of the proceedings which go to make up the history of this part of Utah, will be found in a letter from the Hon. James M. Crane to Hon. William Smith, published in 1859.  This letter is so complete and truthful in its statements, and presents such a correct view of the character and tendencies of Mormonism, that we insert it, nearly entire:--       \"WASHINGTON, January 17, 1859.       \"DEAR SIR,--       \"As you may need some facts not reported at length in the      memorial and other documents, relating to the proposed      Territory of Nevada, I herewith submit them.       \"The Mormons and Anti-Mormons began the settlement of Western      Utah in the latter part of 1854. The former, however,      succeeded, in 1855, in obtaining a numerical majority; and the      Legislature of Utah, on being informed of this fact, organized      the whole western part of the Territory, under the name of      Carson County, and Governor Young appointed Orson Hyde, the      President of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles, its Probate Judge.      Soon after the Judge arrived, adventurers from California, as      well as from the Atlantic States, settled in Carson and other      valleys on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, for the      purpose of mining, farming, and raising stock. As they      increased very fast, the Mormons became alarmed, and      determined to expel them.       \"They therefore ordered them to leave the country. Of course      the Christians, or Anti-Mormons refused to do so. The Mormons      then assembled their forces, and attempted to expel them, _vi      et armis_. The Anti-Mormons also organized, and fortified      themselves, with a view of defending their lives and property      against their assailants.       \"For two weeks their armies camped nearly in sight of each      other, without coming to a direct battle.       \"By this time, news had reached the miners in California of      this state of affairs, and a large number had determined to      cross the mountains, and afford protection to the      Anti-Mormons. On hearing this, the Mormons became satisfied      that, unless they retraced their steps, they would be driven      themselves from the country, instead of the Anti-Mormons. They      therefore proposed a truce, and agreed that all should enjoy a      common heritage in that part of the Territory.       \"The Mormons now became satisfied that the Christians not only      could, but would occupy these fertile valleys, on the ground      that they were the common property of the United States. When      the Legislature of Utah heard of this affair, that body, in      violation of every constitutional right, repealed the county      organization, recalled the Probate Judge, and removed all the      county and court records to Salt Lake City, where they have      ever since remained. Amongst these records were several      indictments against certain persons for high crimes and      misdemeanors. By this flagrant violation of all sacred,      individual, collective, and constitutional rights, the people      of Western Utah were not only denied all legal protection to      life and property, but they were disfranchised. They have ever      been unrepresented in the Legislature and in Congress. The      history of our country presents no such a record of open      defiance of law, and such cruelties to men under the form of      laws.       \"For years the Anti-Mormons have been applying, both to the      Territorial Legislature and to Congress, for protection,      without success.       \"Their situation has ever been, and still is, peculiarly      unsafe and annoying. Recently a Probate Judge was      surreptitiously appointed for Carson Valley, with a view of      reorganizing the county of Carson, and thus extend over the      people there the Mormon statutes of the Territory.       \"The Judge, soon after he received his commission, undertook      to force on an election of county officers. Enough of the      Anti-Mormons, however, turned out, to defeat his purpose, by      the election of an opposite ticket, who, on being elected,      refused to qualify, because they were required to obey the      Mormon statutes. The Judge has been notified that if he      undertakes to enforce the Mormon statutes he will be      resisted,--peaceably if they can, forcibly if they must.       \"They will not introduce, nor permit others to introduce among      them, the vices of that wicked, perverse, and adulterous      generation, who have so long wielded the sceptre of authority      in the Great Basin. They will not allow, with impunity, their      wives and daughters to be kidnapped, dishonored, and defiled;      nor submit to laws made by such a people, nor allow themselves      to be ruled by men who practise and uphold vices and crimes so      revolting to the moral sense of the world; and if the Mormons      persist in their present course, blood will flow.       \"The only loyal people of Utah are oppressed, annoyed, and      scandalized, by a government intended by Congress to secure      them in their rights, and to protect them in their property;      and while the present Territorial organization exists, the      Mormons, who have control of the Legislature, will never 'let      up on the gentiles.'       \"The only remedy for this unnatural war, now raging between      the Mormons and the Anti-Mormons in Utah, is to be found in      the immediate separation of these people under two distinct      governmental organizations. One thing is inevitable,--the      Mormons and Anti-Mormons will never, and can never live      together in peace, under one government. The conflicts which      took place between them in Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa,      and which are now going on in Utah, ought to convince any      intelligent man of the justice and truth of this declaration.      Indeed, the Mormons themselves acknowledge it; and so long as      they adhere to their belief,--a belief founded upon their own      scriptures,--that an absolute theocracy is the only government      under which they can and should live, they never will be loyal      to our"]]]
