She was the craziest thing, this Polly Bragg. She went every night to see them because they were like a \"bit of home,\" she said. Mrs. Motherwell would tell you just what a ridiculous creature she was!  \"I never see the beat o' that girl,\" Mrs. Motherwell would say. \"Them eyes of hers were always red with homesickness, and there was no reason for it in the world, her gettin' more wages than she ever got before, and more'n she was earnin', as I often told her. Land! the way that girl would sing when she had got a letter from home, the queerest songs ye ever heard:     Down by the biller there grew a green willer,    Weeping all night with the bank for a piller.  Well, I had to stop her at last,\" Mrs. Motherwell would tell you with an apologetic swallow, which showed that even generous people have to be firm sometimes in the discharge of unpleasant duties.  \"And, mind you,\" Mrs. Motherwell would go on, with a grieved air, \"just as the busy time came on didn't she up and take the fever--you never can depend on them English girls--and when the doctor was outside there in the buggy waitin' for her--he took her to the hospital--I declare if we didn't find her blubberin' over them poppies, and not a flower on them no mor'n nothing.\"  Sam Motherwell and his wife were nominally Presbyterians. At the time that the Millford Presbyterian Church was built Sam had given twenty-five dollars toward it, the money having been secured in some strange way by the wiles of Purvis Thomas, the collector. Everybody was surprised at Sam's prodigality. The next year, a new collector--for Purvis Thomas had gone away--called on Mr. Motherwell.  The grain was just beginning to show a slight tinge of gold. It was one of those cloudless sunshiny days in the beginning of August, when a faint blue haze lies on the Tiger Hills, and the joy of being alive swells in the breast of every living thing. The creek, swollen with the July rain, ran full in its narrow channel, sparkling and swirling over its gravelly bed, and on the green meadow below the house a herd of shorthorns contentedly cropped the tender after-grass.  In the farmyard a gigantic turkey-gobbler marched majestically with arched neck and spreading wings, feeling himself very much the king of the castle; good-natured ducks puddled contentedly in a trough of dirty water; pigeons, white winged and graceful, circled and wheeled in the sunshine; querulous-voiced hens strutted and scratched, and gossiped openly of mysterious nests hidden away.  Sam stood leaning on a pitchfork in front of the barn door. He was a stout man of about fifty years of age, with an ox-like face. His countenance showed the sullen stolidity of a man who spoke little but listened always, of a man who indulged in suspicious thoughts. He knew everything about his neighbours, good and bad. He might forget the good, but never the evil. The tragedies, the sins, the misdeeds of thirty years ago were as fresh in his memory as the scandal of yesterday. No man had ever been tempted beyond his strength but Sam Motherwell knew the manner of his undoing. He extended no mercy to the fallen; he suggested no excuse for the erring.  The collector made known his errand. Sam became animated at once.  \"What?\" he cried angrily, \"ain't that blamed thing paying yet? I've a good notion to pull my money out of it and be done with it. What do you take me for anyway?\"  The collector ventured to call his attention to his prosperous surroundings, and evident wealth.  \"That's like you town fellows,\" he said indignantly. \"You never think of the hired help and twine bills, and what it costs to run a place like this. I pay every time I go, anyway. There ain't a time that I let the plate go by me, when I'm there. By gosh! you seem to think I've money to burn.\"  The collector departed empty-handed.  The next time Sam went to Millford he was considerably surprised to have the young minister, the Reverend Hugh Grantley, stop him on the street and hand him twenty-five dollars.  \"I understand, sir, that you wish to withdraw the money that you invested in the Lord's work,\" he said as he handed the money to Sam, whose fingers mechanically closed over the bills as he stared at the young man.  The Rev. Hugh Grantley was a typical Scotchman, tall and broad shouldered, with an eye like cold steel. Not many people had contradicted the Rev. Hugh Grantley, at least to his face. His voice could be as sweet as the ripple of a mountain stream, or vibrate with the thunder of the surf that beats upon his own granite cliffs.  \"The Lord sends you seed-time and harvest,\" he said, fixing his level gray eye on the other man, who somehow avoided his gaze, \"has given you health of body and mind, sends you rain from heaven, makes his sun to shine upon you, increases your riches from year to year. You have given Him twenty-five dollars in return and you regret it. Is that so?\"  \"I don't know that I just said that,\" the other man stammered. \"I don't see no need of these fine churches and paid preachers. It isn't them as goes to church most that is the best.\"  \"Oh, I see,\" the young man said, \"you would prefer to give your money for the relief of the poor, for hospitals or children's homes, or something like that. Is that so?\"  \"I don't know as there's any reason for me givin' up the money I work hard for.\" Sam was touched on a vital spot.  \"Well, I'll tell you the reason,\" the minister said; his voice was no louder, but it fell with a sledge-hammer emphasis. He moved a step nearer his companion, and some way caught and held his wavering vision. \"God owns one-tenth of all that stuff you call your own. You have cheated Him out of His part all these years, and He has carried you over from year to year, hoping that you will pay up without harsh proceedings. You are a rich man in this world's goods, but your soul is lean and hungry and naked. Selfishness and greed have blinded your eyes. If you could see what a contemptible, good-for-nothing creature you are in God's sight, you would call on the hills to fall on you. Why, man, I'd rather take my chances with the gambler, the felon, the drunkard, than with you. They may have fallen in a moment of strong temptation; but you are a respectable man merely because it costs money to be otherwise. The Lord can do without your money. Do not think for a minute that God's work will not go on. 'He shall have dominion from sea to sea,' but what of you? You shall lie down and die like the dog. You shall go out into outer darkness. The world will not be one bit better because you have passed through it.\"  Sam was incoherent with rage. \"See here,\" he sputtered, \"what do you know about it? I pay my debts. Everybody knows that.\"  \"Hold on, hold on,\" the young man said gently, \"you pay the debts that the law compels you to pay. You have to pay your hired help and your threshing bills, and all that, because you would be 'sued' if you didn't. There is one debt that is left to a man's honour, the debt he owes to God, and to the poor and the needy. Do you pay that debt?\"  \"Well, you'll never get a cent out of me anyway. You have a mighty poor way of asking for money--maybe if you had taken me the right way you might have got some.\"  \"Excuse me, Mr. Motherwell,\" the young man replied with unaffected good humour, \"I did not ask you for money at all. I gave you back what you did give. No member of our congregation will ask you for any, though there may come a time when you will ask us to take it.\"  Sam Motherwell broke into a scornful laugh, and, turning away, went angrily down the street. The fact that the minister had given him back his money was a severe shock to some of his deep-rooted opinions. He had always regarded churches as greedy institutions, looking and begging for money from everyone; ministers as parasites on society, living without honest labour, preying on the working man. Sam's favourite story was the old one about the woman whose child got a coin stuck in its throat. She did not send for the doctor, but for the minister! Sam had always seen considerable truth in this story and had told it to every minister he had met.  He told himself now that he was glad to get back the money, twenty-five dollars was not picked up every day. But he was not glad. The very touch of the bills was distasteful to him!  He did not tell his wife of the occurrence. Nor did he put the money in the black bag, where their money was always kept in the bureau drawer, safe under lock and key. He could not do that without telling his wife where it came from. So he shoved it carelessly into the pocket of the light overcoat that he was wearing. Sam Motherwell was not a careless man about money, but the possession of this particular twenty-five dollars gave him no pleasure.    CHAPTER VIII  THE OTHER DOCTOR  The young minister went down the street with a thoughtful face.  \"I wonder if I did right,\" he was thinking. \"It is a hard thing to talk that way to a human being, and yet it seems to be the only thing to do. Oh, what it would mean for God's work if all these rich farmers were saved from their insatiable greed.\"  He turned into Dr. Clay's office.  \"Oh, Clay!\" he burst out when he had answered the young man's friendly greeting, \"it is an awful thing to lay open a mean man's meanness, and tell him the plain truth about himself.\"  \"It is, indeed,\" the young doctor answered, \"but perhaps it is heroic treatment your man needed, for I would infer that you have been reading the law to someone. Who was it?\"  \"Sam Motherwell,\" the minister answered.  \"Well, you had a good subject,\" the doctor said gravely. \"For aggravated greed, and fatty degeneration of the conscience, Mr. Motherwell is certainly a wonder. When that poor English girl took the fever out here, it was hard to convince Sam that she was really sick. 'Look at them red cheeks of hers,' he said to me, 'and her ears ain't cold,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4376"],["title","Sowing Seeds in Danny (#8)"],["body","her eyes is bright as ever. She's just lookin' for a rest, I think, if you wuz to ask me.'\"  \"How did you convince him?\"  \"I told him the girl would have to have a trained nurse, and would be sick probably six weeks, and then they couldn't get the poor girl off their hands quick enough. 'I don't want that girl dyin' round here,' Sam said.\"  \"Is Mrs. Motherwell as close as he is?\" the minister asked after a pause.  \"Some say worse,\" the doctor replied, \"but I don't believe it. She can't be.\"  The minister's face was troubled. \"I wish I knew what to do for them,\" he said sadly.  \"I'll tell you something you can do for me,\" the doctor said sitting up straight, \"or at least something you may try to do.\"  \"What is it?\" the minister asked.  \"Devise some method, suggest some course of treatment, whereby my tried and trusty horse Pleurisy will cease to look so much like a saw-horse. I'm afraid the Humane Society will get after me.\"  The minister laughed.  Everybody knew Dr. Clay's horse; there was no danger of mistaking him for any other. He was tall and lean and gaunt. The doctor had bought him believing him to be in poor condition, which good food and good care would remedy. But as the months went by, in spite of all the doctor could do, Pleurisy remained the same, eating everything the doctor brought him, and looking for more, but showing no improvement.  \"I've tried everything except egg-nog,\" the doctor went on, \"and pink pills, and I would like to turn over the responsibility to someone else. I think perhaps his trouble must be mental--some gnawing sorrow that keeps him awake at night. I don't mind driving Pleurisy where people know me and know that I do feed him occasionally, but it is disconcerting when I meet strangers to have kind-looking old ladies shake their heads at me. I know what they're thinking, and I believe Pleurisy really enjoys it, and then when I drive past a farmhouse to see the whole family run out and hold their sides is not a pleasure. Talk about scattering sunshine! Pleurisy leaves a trail of merriment wherever he goes.\"  \"What difference does it make what people think when your conscience is clear. You do feed your horse, you feed him well, so what's the odds,\" inquired the Rev. Hugh Grantley, son of granite, child of the heather, looking with lifted brows at his friend.  \"Oh, there you go!\" the doctor said smiling. \"That's the shorter catechism coming out in you--that Scotch complacency is the thing I wish I had, but I can't help feeling like a rogue, a cheat, an oppressor of the helpless, when I look at Pleurisy.\"  \"Horace,\" the minister said kindly, with his level gray eyes fixed thoughtfully on his friend's handsome face, \"a man in either your calling or mine has no right to ask himself how he feels. Don't feel your own pulse too much. It is disquieting. It is for us to go on, never faltering and never looking behind.\"  \"In other words, to make good, and never mind the fans,\" the doctor smiled. Then he became serious. \"But Grantley, I am not always so sure I am right as you are. You see a sinner is always a sinner and in danger of damnation, for which there is but one cure, but a sick man may have quinsy or he may have diphtheria, and the treatment is different. But oh! Grantley, I wish I had that Scotch-gray confidence in myself that you have. If you were a doctor you would tell a man he had typhoid, and he'd proceed to have it, even if he had only set out to have an ingrowing toe-nail. But my patients have a decided will of their own. There's young Ab Cowan--they sent for me last night to go out to see him. He has a bad attack of quinsy, but it is the strangest case I ever saw.\"  The gaiety had died out of the young man's face, and he looked perplexed and anxious.  \"I do wish the old doctor and I were on speaking terms,\" he concluded.  \"And are you not?\" the minister asked in surprise. \"Miss Barner told me that you had been very kind--and I thought--\" There was a flush on the minister's face, and he hesitated.  \"Oh, Miss Barner and I are the best of friends,\" the doctor said. \"I say, Grantley, hasn't that little girl had one lonely life, and isn't she the brave little soul!\"  The minister was silent, all but his eyes.  The doctor went on:  \"'Who hath sorrow, who hath woe, who hath redness of eyes?' Solomon, wasn't it, who said it was 'they who tarry long at the wine'? I think he should have added 'those who wait at home.' Don't you think she is a remarkably beautiful girl, Grantley?\" he asked abruptly.  \"I do, indeed,\" the minister answered, giving his friend a searching glance. \"But how about the doctor, why will he not speak to you?\" He was glad of a chance to change the subject.  \"I suppose the old man's pride is hurt every time he sees me. He evidently thinks he is all the medical aid they need around here. But I do wish he would come with me to see this young Cowan; it's the most puzzling case I've ever met. There are times, Grantley, when I think I should be following the plough.\"  The minister looked at him thoughtfully.  \"A man can only do his best, Horace,\" he said kindly.    CHAPTER IX  THE LIVE WIRE  \"Who is this young gentleman or lady?\" Dr. Clay asked of Pearlie Watson one day when he met her wheeling a baby carriage with an abnormally fat baby in it.  \"This is the Czar of all the Rooshia,\" Pearl answered gravely, \"and I'm his body-guard.\"  The doctor's face showed no surprise as he stepped back to get a better look at the czar, who began to squirm at the delay.  \"See the green plush on his kerridge,\" Pearl said proudly, \"and every stitch he has on is hand-made, and was did for him, too, and he's fed every three hours, rain or shine, hit or miss.\"  \"Think of that!\" the doctor exclaimed with emphasis, \"and yet some people tell us that the Czar has a hard time of it.\"  Pearl drew a step nearer, moving the carriage up and down rapidly to appease the wrath of the czar, who was expressing his disapproval in a very lumpy cry.  \"I'm just 'tendin', you know, about him bein' the czar,\" she said confidentially. \"You see, I mind him every day, and that's the way I play. Maudie Ducker said one day I never had no time to play cos we wuz so pore, and that started me. It's a lovely game.\"  The doctor nodded. He knew something of \"'tendin' games\" too.  \"I have to taste everything he eats, for fear of Paris green,\" Pearl went on, speaking now in the loud official tone of the body-guard. \"I have to stand between him and the howlin' mob thirstin' for his gore.\"  \"He seems to howl more than the mob,\" the doctor said smiling.  \"He's afraid we're plottin',\" Pearl whispered. \"Can't trust no one. He ain't howlin'. That's his natcheral voice when he's talkin' Rooshan. He don't know one English word, only 'Goo!' But he'll say that every time. See now. How is a precious luvvy-duvvy? See the pitty man, pull um baby toofin!\"  At which the czar, secure in his toothlessness, rippled his fat face into dimples, and triumphantly brought forth a whole succession of \"goos.\"  \"Ain't he a peach?\" Pearlie said with pride. \"Some kids won't show off worth a cent when ye want them to, but he'll say 'goo' if you even nudge him. His mother thinks 'goo' is awful childish, and she is at him all the time to say 'Daddy-dinger,' but he never lets on he hears her. Say, doctor\"--Pearlie's face was troubled--\"what do you think of his looks? Just between ourselves. Hasn't he a fine little nub of a nose? Do you see anything about him to make his mother cry?\"  The doctor looked critically at the czar, who returned his gaze with stolid indifference.  \"I never saw a more perfect nub on any nose,\" he answered honestly. \"He's a fine big boy, and his mother should be proud of him.\"  \"There now, what did I tell you!\" Pearlie cried delightedly, nodding her head at an imaginary audience.  \"That's what I always say to his mother, but she's so tuk up with pictures of pretty kids with big eyes and curly hair, she don't seem to be able to get used to him. She never says his nose is a pug, but she says it's 'different,' and his voice is not what she wanted. He cries lumpy, I know, but his goos are all right. The kid in the book she is readin' could say 'Daddy-dinger' before he was as old as the czar is, and it's awful hard on her. You see, he can't pat-a-cake, or this-little-pig-went-to-market, or wave a bye-bye or nothin'. I never told her what Danny could do when he was this age. But I am workin' hard to get him to say 'Daddy-dinger.' She has her heart set on that. Well, I must go on now.\"  The doctor lifted his hat, and the imperial carriage moved on.  She had gone a short distance when she remembered something:  \"I'll let you know when he says it, doc!\" she shouted.  \"All right, don't forget,\" he smiled back.  When Pearlie turned the next corner she met Maudie Ducker. Maudie Ducker had on a new plaid dress with velvet trimming, and Maudie knew it.  \"Is that your Sunday dress,\" she asked Pearl, looking critically at Pearlie's faded little brown winsey.  \"My, no!\" Pearlie answered cheerfully. \"This is just my morning dress. I wear my blue satting in the afternoon, and on Sundays, my purple velvet with the watter-plait, and basque-yoke of tartaric plaid, garnished with lace. Yours is a nice little plain dress. That stuff fades though; ma lined a quilt for the boys' bed with it and it faded gray.\"  Maudie Ducker was a \"perfect little lady.\" Her mother often said so; Maudie could not bear to sit near a child in school who had on a dirty pinafore or ragged clothes, and the number of days that she could wear a pinafore without its showing one trace of stain was simply wonderful! Maudie had two dolls which she never played with. They were propped up against the legs of the parlour table. Maudie could play the \"Java March\" and \"Mary's Pet Waltz\" on the piano. She always spoke in a hushed vox tremulo, and never played any rough games. She could not bear to touch a baby, because it might put a sticky little finger on her pinafore. All of"]]]
