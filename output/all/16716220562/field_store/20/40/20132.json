IT’S FORTH ACROSS THE ROARING FOAM      IT’S forth across the roaring foam, and on towards the west,    It’s many a lonely league from home, o’er many a mountain crest,    From where the dogs of Scotland call the sheep around the fold,    To where the flags are flying beside the Gates of Gold.     Where all the deep-sea galleons ride that come to bring the corn,    Where falls the fog at eventide and blows the breeze at morn;    It’s there that I was sick and sad, alone and poor and cold,    In yon distressful city beside the Gates of Gold.     I slept as one that nothing knows; but far along my way,    Before the morning God rose and planned the coming day;    Afar before me forth he went, as through the sands of old,    And chose the friends to help me beside the Gates of Gold.     I have been near, I have been far, my back’s been at the wall,    Yet aye and ever shone the star to guide me through it all:    The love of God, the help of man, they both shall make me bold    Against the gates of darkness as beside the Gates of Gold.     AN ENGLISH BREEZE      UP with the sun, the breeze arose,    Across the talking corn she goes,    And smooth she rustles far and wide    Through all the voiceful countryside.     Through all the land her tale she tells;    She spins, she tosses, she compels    The kites, the clouds, the windmill sails    And all the trees in all the dales.     God calls us, and the day prepares    With nimble, gay and gracious airs:    And from Penzance to Maidenhead    The roads last night He watered.     God calls us from inglorious ease,    Forth and to travel with the breeze    While, swift and singing, smooth and strong    She gallops by the fields along.     AS IN THEIR FLIGHT THE BIRDS OF SONG      AS in their flight the birds of song    Halt here and there in sweet and sunny dales,    But halt not overlong;    The time one rural song to sing    They pause; then following bounteous gales    Steer forward on the wing:    Sun-servers they, from first to last,    Upon the sun they wait    To ride the sailing blast.     So he awhile in our contested state,    Awhile abode, not longer, for his Sun—    Mother we say, no tenderer name we know—    With whose diviner glow    His early days had shone,    Now to withdraw her radiance had begun.    Or lest a wrong I say, not she withdrew,    But the loud stream of men day after day    And great dust columns of the common way    Between them grew and grew:    And he and she for evermore might yearn,    But to the spring the rivulets not return    Nor to the bosom comes the child again.     And he (O may we fancy so!),    He, feeling time forever flow    And flowing bear him forth and far away    From that dear ingle where his life began    And all his treasure lay—    He, waxing into man,    And ever farther, ever closer wound    In this obstreperous world’s ignoble round,    From that poor prospect turned his face away.     THE PIPER      AGAIN I hear you piping, for I know the tune so well,—       You rouse the heart to wander and be free,    Tho’ where you learned your music, not the God of song can tell,       For you pipe the open highway and the sea.    O piper, lightly footing, lightly piping on your way,       Tho’ your music thrills and pierces far and near,    I tell you you had better pipe to someone else to-day,       For you cannot pipe my fancy from my dear.     You sound the note of travel through the hamlet and the town;       You would lure the holy angels from on high;    And not a man can hear you, but he throws the hammer down       And is off to see the countries ere he die.    But now no more I wander, now unchanging here I stay;       By my love, you find me safely sitting here:    And pipe you ne’er so sweetly, till you pipe the hills away,       You can never pipe my fancy from my dear.     TO MRS. MACMARLAND      IN Schnee der Alpen—so it runs       To those divine accords—and here    We dwell in Alpine snows and suns,       A motley crew, for half the year:    A motley crew, we dwell to taste—       A shivering band in hope and fear—    That sun upon the snowy waste,       That Alpine ether cold and clear.     Up from the laboured plains, and up       From low sea-levels, we arise    To drink of that diviner cup       The rarer air, the clearer skies;    For, as the great, old, godly King       From mankind’s turbid valley cries,    So all we mountain-lovers sing:       I to the hills will lift mine eyes.     The bells that ring, the peaks that climb,       The frozen snow’s unbroken curd    Might yet revindicate in rhyme       The pauseless stream, the absent bird.    In vain—for to the deeps of life       You, lady, you my heart have stirred;    And since you say you love my life,       Be sure I love you for the word.     Of kindness, here I nothing say—       Such loveless kindnesses there are    In that grimacing, common way,       That old, unhonoured social war.    Love but my dog and love my love,       Adore with me a common star—    I value not the rest above       The ashes of a bad cigar.     TO MISS CORNISH      THEY tell me, lady, that to-day       On that unknown Australian strand—    Some time ago, so far away—       Another lady joined the band.    She joined the company of those       Lovelily dowered, nobly planned,    Who, smiling, still forgive their foes       And keep their friends in close command.     She, lady, as I learn, was one       Among the many rarely good;    And destined still to be a sun       Through every dark and rainy mood:—    She, as they told me, far had come,       By sea and land, o’er many a rood:—    Admired by all, beloved by some,       She was yourself, I understood.     But, compliment apart and free       From all constraint of verses, may    Goodness and honour, grace and glee,       Attend you ever on your way—    Up to the measure of your will,       Beyond all power of mine to say—    As she and I desire you still,       Miss Cornish, on your natal day.     TALES OF ARABIA      YES, friend, I own these tales of Arabia    Smile not, as smiled their flawless originals,       Age-old but yet untamed, for ages       Pass and the magic is undiminished.     Thus, friend, the tales of the old Camaralzaman,    Ayoub, the Slave of Love, or the Calendars,       Blind-eyed and ill-starred royal scions,       Charm us in age as they charmed in childhood.     Fair ones, beyond all numerability,    Beam from the palace, beam on humanity,       Bright-eyed, in truth, yet soul-less houris       Offering pleasure and only pleasure.     Thus they, the venal Muses Arabian,    Unlike, indeed, the nobler divinities,       Greek Gods or old time-honoured muses,       Easily proffer unloved caresses.     Lost, lost, the man who mindeth the minstrelsy;    Since still, in sandy, glittering pleasances,       Cold, stony fruits, gem-like but quite in-       Edible, flatter and wholly starve him.     BEHOLD, AS GOBLINS DARK OF MIEN      BEHOLD, as goblins dark of mien       And portly tyrants dyed with crime    Change, in the transformation scene,       At Christmas, in the pantomime,     Instanter, at the prompter’s cough,       The fairy bonnets them, and they    Throw their abhorred carbuncles off       And blossom like the flowers in May.     —So mankind, to angelic eyes,       So, through the scenes of life below,    In life’s ironical disguise,       A travesty of man, ye go:     But fear not: ere the curtain fall,       Death in the transformation scene    Steps forward from her pedestal,       Apparent, as the fairy Queen;     And coming, frees you in a trice       From all your lendings—lust of fame,    Ungainly virtue, ugly vice,       Terror and tyranny and shame.     So each, at last himself, for good       In that dear country lays him down,    At last beloved and understood       And pure in feature and renown.     STILL I LOVE TO RHYME      STILL I love to rhyme, and still more, rhyming, to wander       Far from the commoner way;    Old-time trills and falls by the brook-side still do I ponder,       Dreaming to-morrow to-day.     Come here, come, revive me, Sun-God, teach me, Apollo,       Measures descanted before;    Since I ancient verses, I emulous follow,       Prints in the marbles of yore.     Still strange, strange, they sound in old-young raiment invested,       Songs for the brain to forget—    Young song-birds elate to grave old temples benested       Piping and chirruping yet.     Thoughts?  No thought has yet unskilled attempted to flutter       Trammelled so vilely in verse;    He who writes but aims at fame and his bread and his butter,       Won with a groan and a curse.     LONG TIME I LAY IN LITTLE EASE      LONG time I lay in little ease       Where, placed by the Turanian,    Marseilles, the many-masted, sees       The blue Mediterranean.     Now songful in the hour of sport,       Now riotous for wages,    She camps around her ancient port,       As ancient of the ages.     Algerian airs through all the place       Unconquerably sally;    Incomparable women pace       The shadows of the alley.     And high o’er dark and graving yard       And where the sky is paler,    The golden virgin of the guard       Shines, beckoning the sailor.     She hears the city roar on high,       Thief, prostitute, and banker;    She sees the masted vessels lie       Immovably at anchor.     She sees the snowy islets dot       The sea’s immortal azure,    And If, that castellated spot,       Tower, turret, and embrasure.     FLOWER GOD, GOD OF THE SPRING      FLOWER god, god of the spring, beautiful, bountiful,    Cold-dyed shield in the sky, lover of versicles,       Here I wander in April       Cold, grey-headed; and still to my    Heart, Spring comes with a bound, Spring the deliverer,    Spring, song-leader in woods, chorally resonant;       Spring, flower-planter in meadows,       Child-conductor in willowy    Fields deep dotted with bloom, daisies and crocuses: "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/441"],["title","New Poems, and Variant Readings (#7)"],["body","   Here that child from his heart drinks of eternity:       O child, happy are children!       She still smiles on their innocence,    She, dear mother in God, fostering violets,    Fills earth full of her scents, voices and violins:       Thus one cunning in music       Wakes old chords in the memory:    Thus fair earth in the Spring leads her performances.    One more touch of the bow, smell of the virginal       Green—one more, and my bosom       Feels new life with an ecstasy.     COME, MY BELOVED, HEAR FROM ME      COME, my beloved, hear from me    Tales of the woods or open sea.    Let our aspiring fancy rise    A wren’s flight higher toward the skies;    Or far from cities, brown and bare,    Play at the least in open air.    In all the tales men hear us tell    Still let the unfathomed ocean swell,    Or shallower forest sound abroad    Below the lonely stars of God;    In all, let something still be done,    Still in a corner shine the sun,    Slim-ankled maids be fleet of foot,    Nor man disown the rural flute.    Still let the hero from the start    In honest sweat and beats of heart    Push on along the untrodden road    For some inviolate abode.    Still, O beloved, let me hear    The great bell beating far and near—    The odd, unknown, enchanted gong    That on the road hales men along,    That from the mountain calls afar,    That lures a vessel from a star,    And with a still, aerial sound    Makes all the earth enchanted ground.    Love, and the love of life and act    Dance, live and sing through all our furrowed tract;    Till the great God enamoured gives    To him who reads, to him who lives,    That rare and fair romantic strain    That whoso hears must hear again.     SINCE YEARS AGO FOR EVERMORE      SINCE years ago for evermore    My cedar ship I drew to shore;    And to the road and riverbed    And the green, nodding reeds, I said    Mine ignorant and last farewell:    Now with content at home I dwell,    And now divide my sluggish life    Betwixt my verses and my wife:    In vain; for when the lamp is lit    And by the laughing fire I sit,    Still with the tattered atlas spread    Interminable roads I tread.     ENVOY FOR “A CHILD’S GARDEN OF VERSES”      WHETHER upon the garden seat    You lounge with your uplifted feet    Under the May’s whole Heaven of blue;    Or whether on the sofa you,    No grown up person being by,    Do some soft corner occupy;    Take you this volume in your hands    And enter into other lands,    For lo! (as children feign) suppose    You, hunting in the garden rows,    Or in the lumbered attic, or    The cellar—a nail-studded door    And dark, descending stairway found    That led to kingdoms underground:    There standing, you should hear with ease    Strange birds a-singing, or the trees    Swing in big robber woods, or bells    On many fairy citadels:     There passing through (a step or so—    Neither mamma nor nurse need know!)    From your nice nurseries you would pass,    Like Alice through the Looking-Glass    Or Gerda following Little Ray,    To wondrous countries far away.    Well, and just so this volume can    Transport each little maid or man    Presto from where they live away    Where other children used to play.    As from the house your mother sees    You playing round the garden trees,    So you may see if you but look    Through the windows of this book    Another child far, far away    And in another garden play.    But do not think you can at all,    By knocking on the window, call    That child to hear you.  He intent    Is still on his play-business bent.    He does not hear, he will not look,    Nor yet be lured out of this book.    For long ago, the truth to say,    He has grown up and gone away;    And it is but a child of air    That lingers in the garden there.     FOR RICHMOND’S GARDEN WALL      WHEN Thomas set this tablet here,    Time laughed at the vain chanticleer;    And ere the moss had dimmed the stone,    Time had defaced that garrison.    Now I in turn keep watch and ward    In my red house, in my walled yard    Of sunflowers, sitting here at ease    With friends and my bright canvases.    But hark, and you may hear quite plain    Time’s chuckled laughter in the lane.     HAIL, GUEST, AND ENTER FREELY!      HAIL, guest, and enter freely!  All you see    Is, for your momentary visit, yours; and we    Who welcome you are but the guests of God,    And know not our departure.     LO, NOW, MY GUEST      LO, now, my guest, if aught amiss were said,    Forgive it and dismiss it from your head.    For me, for you, for all, to close the date,    Pass now the ev’ning sponge across the slate;    And to that spirit of forgiveness keep    Which is the parent and the child of sleep.     SO LIVE, SO LOVE, SO USE THAT FRAGILE HOUR      SO live, so love, so use that fragile hour,    That when the dark hand of the shining power    Shall one from other, wife or husband, take,    The poor survivor may not weep and wake.     AD SE IPSUM      DEAR sir, good-morrow!  Five years back,    When you first girded for this arduous track,    And under various whimsical pretexts    Endowed another with your damned defects,    Could you have dreamed in your despondent vein    That the kind God would make your path so plain?    Non nobis, domine!  O, may He still    Support my stumbling footsteps on the hill!     BEFORE THIS LITTLE GIFT WAS COME      BEFORE this little gift was come    The little owner had made haste for home;    And from the door of where the eternal dwell,    Looked back on human things and smiled farewell.    O may this grief remain the only one!    O may our house be still a garrison    Of smiling children, and for evermore    The tune of little feet be heard along the floor!     GO, LITTLE BOOK—THE ANCIENT PHRASE      GO, little book—the ancient phrase    And still the daintiest—go your ways,    My Otto, over sea and land,    Till you shall come to Nelly’s hand.     How shall I your Nelly know?    By her blue eyes and her black brow,    By her fierce and slender look,    And by her goodness, little book!     What shall I say when I come there?    You shall speak her soft and fair:    See—you shall say—the love they send    To greet their unforgotten friend!     Giant Adulpho you shall sing    The next, and then the cradled king:    And the four corners of the roof    Then kindly bless; and to your perch aloof,    Where Balzac all in yellow dressed    And the dear Webster of the west    Encircle the prepotent throne    Of Shakespeare and of Calderon,    Shall climb an upstart.     There with these    You shall give ear to breaking seas    And windmills turning in the breeze,    A distant undetermined din    Without; and you shall hear within    The blazing and the bickering logs,    The crowing child, the yawning dogs,    And ever agile, high and low,    Our Nelly going to and fro.     There shall you all silent sit,    Till, when perchance the lamp is lit    And the day’s labour done, she takes    Poor Otto down, and, warming for our sakes,    Perchance beholds, alive and near,    Our distant faces reappear.     MY LOVE WAS WARM      MY love was warm; for that I crossed       The mountains and the sea,    Nor counted that endeavour lost       That gave my love to me.     If that indeed were love at all,       As still, my love, I trow,    By what dear name am I to call       The bond that holds me now     DEDICATORY POEM FOR “UNDERWOODS”      TO her, for I must still regard her    As feminine in her degree,    Who has been my unkind bombarder    Year after year, in grief and glee,    Year after year, with oaken tree;    And yet betweenwhiles my laudator    In terms astonishing to me—    To the Right Reverend The Spectator    I here, a humble dedicator,    Bring the last apples from my tree.     In tones of love, in tones of warning,    She hailed me through my brief career;    And kiss and buffet, night and morning,    Told me my grandmamma was near;    Whether she praised me high and clear    Through her unrivalled circulation,    Or, sanctimonious insincere,    She damned me with a misquotation—    A chequered but a sweet relation,    Say, was it not, my granny dear?     Believe me, granny, altogether    Yours, though perhaps to your surprise.    Oft have you spruced my wounded feather,    Oft brought a light into my eyes—    For notice still the writer cries.    In any civil age or nation,    The book that is not talked of dies.    So that shall be my termination:    Whether in praise or execration,    Still, if you love me, criticise!     FAREWELL      FAREWELL, and when forth    I through the Golden Gates to Golden Isles    Steer without smiling, through the sea of smiles,    Isle upon isle, in the seas of the south,    Isle upon island, sea upon sea,    Why should I sail, why should the breeze?    I have been young, and I have counted friends.    A hopeless sail I spread, too late, too late.    Why should I from isle to isle    Sail, a hopeless sailor?     THE FAR-FARERS      THE broad sun,       The bright day:    White sails       On the blue bay:    The far-farers       Draw away.     Light the fires       And close the door.    To the old homes,       To the loved shore,    The far-farers       Return no more.     COME, MY LITTLE CHILDREN, HERE ARE SONGS FOR YOU      COME, my little children, here are songs for you;    Some are short and some are long, and all, all are new.    You must learn to sing them very small and clear,    Very true to time and tune and pleasing to the ear.     Mark the note that rises, mark the notes that fall,    Mark the time when broken, and the swing of it all.    So when night is come, and you have gone to bed,    All the songs you love to sing shall echo in your head.     HOME FROM THE DAISIED MEADOWS      HOME from the daisied meadows, where you linger yet—    Home, golden-headed playmate, ere the sun is set;    For the dews are falling fast    And the night has come at last."]]]
