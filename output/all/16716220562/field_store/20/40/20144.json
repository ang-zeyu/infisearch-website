So I piled at least twenty chosen volumes on the table at the head of my bed, and I daresay it was nigh daylight when I fell asleep.  I began my entertainment with several pages from Keightley's \"Fairy Mythology,\" and followed it up with random bits from Crofton Croker's \"Traditions of the South of Ireland,\" Mrs. Carey's \"Legends of the French Provinces,\" Andrew Lang's Green, Blue and Red fairy books, Laboulaye's \"Last Fairy Tales,\" Hauff's \"The Inn in the Spessart,\" Julia Goddard's \"Golden Weathercock,\" Frere's \"Eastern Fairy Legends,\"  Asbjornsen's \"Folk Tales,\" Susan Pindar's \"Midsummer Fays,\" Nisbit Bain's \"Cossack Fairy Tales,\" etc., etc.  I fell asleep with a copy of Villamaria's fairy stories in my hands, and I had a delightful dream wherein, under the protection and guidance of my fairy godmother, I undertook the rescue of a beautiful princess who had been enchanted by a cruel witch and was kept in prison by the witch's son, a hideous ogre with seven heads, whose companions were four equally hideous dragons.  This undertaking in which I was engaged involved a period of five years, but time is of precious little consideration to one when he is dreaming of exploits achieved in behalf of a beautiful princess.  My fairy godmother (she wore a mob-cap and was hunchbacked) took good care of me, and conducted me safely through all my encounters with demons, giants, dragons, witches, serpents, hippogriffins, ogres, etc.; and I had just rescued the princess and broken the spell which bound her, and we were about to \"live in peace to the end of our lives,\" when I awoke to find it was all a dream, and that the gas-light over my bed had been blazing away during the entire period of my five-year war for the delectable maiden.  This incident gives me an opportunity to say that observation has convinced me that all good and true book-lovers practise the pleasing and improving avocation of reading in bed.  Indeed, I fully believe with Judge Methuen that no book can be appreciated until it has been slept with and dreamed over.  You recall, perhaps, that eloquent passage in his noble defence of the poet Archias, wherein Cicero (not Kikero) refers to his own pursuit of literary studies:  \"Haec studia adolescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectant; secundas res ornant, adversis perfugium ac solatium praebent; delectant domi, non impediunt foris; PERNOCTANT nobiscum, peregrinantur, rusticantur!\"  By the gods! you spoke tally, friend Cicero; for it is indeed so, that these pursuits nourish our earlier and delight our later years, dignifying the minor details of life and affording a perennial refuge and solace; at home they please us and in no vocation elsewhere do they embarrass us; they are with  us by night, they go with us upon our travels, and even upon our retirement into the country do they accompany us!  I have italicized pernoctant because it is that word which demonstrates beyond all possibility of doubt that Cicero made a practice of reading in bed.  Why, I can almost see him now, propped up in his couch, unrolling scroll after scroll of his favorite literature, and enjoying it mightily, too, which enjoyment is interrupted now and then by the occasion which the noble reader takes to mutter maledictions upon the slave who has let the lamp run low of oil or has neglected to trim the wick.  \"Peregrinantur?\"  Indeed, they do share our peregrinations, these literary pursuits do.  If Thomas Hearne (of blessed memory!) were alive to-day he would tell us that he used always to take a book along with him whenever he went walking, and was wont to read it as he strolled along.  On several occasions (as he tells us in his diary) he became so absorbed in his reading that he missed his way and darkness came upon him before he knew it.  I have always wondered why book-lovers have not had more to say of Hearne, for assuredly he was as glorious a collector as ever felt the divine fire glow within him.  His character is exemplified in this prayer, which is preserved among other papers of his in the Bodleian Library:  \"O most gracious and merciful Lord God, wonderful is Thy providence.  I return all possible thanks to Thee for the care Thou hast always taken of me.  I continually meet with most signal instances of this Thy providence, and one act yesterday, when I unexpectedly met with three old MSS., for which, in a particular manner, I return my thanks, beseeching Thee to continue the same protection to me, a poor, helpless sinner,\" etc.  Another prayer of Hearne's, illustrative of his faith in dependence upon Divine counsel, was made at the time Hearne was importuned by Dr. Bray, commissary to my Lord Bishop of London, \"to go to Mary-Land\" in the character of a missionary.  \"O Lord God, Heavenly Father, look down upon me with pity,\" cries this pious soul,  \"and be pleased to be my guide, now I am importuned to leave the place where I have been educated in the university.  And of Thy great goodness I humbly desire Thee to signify to me what is most proper for me to do in this affair.\"  Another famous man who made a practice of reading books as he walked the highways was Dr. Johnson, and it is recorded that he presented a curious spectacle indeed, for his shortsightedness compelled him to hold the volume close to his nose, and he shuffled along, rather than walked, stepping high over shadows and stumbling over sticks and stones.  But, perhaps, the most interesting story illustrative of the practice of carrying one's reading around with one is that which is told of Professor Porson, the Greek scholar.  This human monument of learning happened to be travelling in the same coach with a coxcomb who sought to air his pretended learning by quotations from the ancients.  At last old Porson asked:  \"Pri'thee, sir, whence comes that quotation?\"  \"From Sophocles,\" quoth the vain fellow.  \"Be so kind as to find it for me?\" asked Porson, producing a copy of Sophocles from his pocket.  Then the coxcomb, not at all abashed, said that he meant not Sophocles, but Euripides.  Whereupon Porson drew from another pocket a copy of Euripides and challenged the upstart to find the quotation in question. Full of confusion, the fellow thrust his head out of the window of the coach and cried to the driver:  \"In heaven's name, put me down at once; for there is an old gentleman in here that hath the Bodleian Library in his pocket!\"  Porson himself was a veritable slave to the habit of reading in bed. He would lie down with his books piled around him, then light his pipe and start in upon some favorite volume.  A jug of liquor was invariably at hand, for Porson was a famous drinker. It is related that on one occasion he fell into a boosy slumber, his pipe dropped out of his mouth and set fire to the bed-clothes. But for the arrival of succor the  tipsy scholar would surely have been cremated.  Another very slovenly fellow was De Quincey, and he was devoted to reading in bed.  But De Quincey was a very vandal when it came to the care and use of books.  He never returned volumes he borrowed, and he never hesitated to mutilate a rare book in order to save himself the labor and trouble of writing out a quotation.  But perhaps the person who did most to bring reading in bed into evil repute was Mrs. Charles Elstob, ward and sister of the Canon of Canterbury (circa 1700).  In his \"Dissertation on Letter-Founders,\" Rowe Mores describes this woman as the \"indefessa comes\" of her brother's studies, a female student in Oxford.  She was, says Mores, a northern lady of an ancient family and a genteel fortune, \"but she pursued too much the drug called learning, and in that pursuit failed of being careful of any one thing necessary.  In her latter years she was tutoress in the family of the Duke of Portland, where we visited her in her sleeping-room at Bulstrode, surrounded  with books and dirtiness, the usual appendages of folk of learning!\"  There is another word which Cicero uses--for I have still somewhat more to say of that passage from the oration \"pro Archia poeta\"--the word \"rusticantur,\" which indicates that civilization twenty centuries ago made a practice of taking books out into the country for summer reading.  \"These literary pursuits rusticate with us,\" says Cicero, and thus he presents to us a pen-picture of the Roman patrician stretched upon the cool grass under the trees, perusing the latest popular romance, while, forsooth, in yonder hammock his dignified spouse swings slowly to and fro, conning the pages and the colored plates of the current fashion journal.  Surely in the telltale word \"rusticantur\" you and I and the rest of human nature find a worthy precedent and much encouragement for our practice of loading up with plenty of good reading before we start for the scene of our annual summering.  As for myself, I never go away from home that I do not take a trunkful of books with  me, for experience has taught me that there is no companionship better than that of these friends, who, however much all things else may vary, always give the same response to my demand upon their solace and their cheer.  My sister, Miss Susan, has often inveighed against this practice of mine, and it was only yesterday that she informed me that I was the most exasperating man in the world.  However, as Miss Susan's experience with men during the sixty-seven hot summers and sixty-eight hard winters of her life has been somewhat limited, I think I should bear her criticism without a murmur.  Miss Susan is really one of the kindest creatures in all the world."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/443"],["title","The Love Affairs of a Bibliomaniac (#4)"],["body"," is her misfortune that she has had all her life an insane passion for collecting crockery, old pewter, old brass, old glass, old furniture and other trumpery of that character; a passion with which I have little sympathy.  I do not know that Miss Susan is prouder of her collection of all this folderol than she is of the fact that she is a spinster.  This latter peculiarity asserts itself upon  every occasion possible. I recall an unpleasant scene in the omnibus last winter, when the obsequious conductor, taking advantage of my sister's white hair and furrowed cheeks, addressed that estimable lady as \"Madam.\"  I'd have you know that my sister gave the fellow to understand very shortly and in very vigorous English (emphasized with her blue silk umbrella) that she was Miss Susan, and that she did not intend to be Madamed by anybody, under any condition.    IV  THE MANIA OF COLLECTING SEIZES ME  Captivity Waite never approved of my fondness for fairy literature. She shared the enthusiasm which I expressed whenever \"Robinson Crusoe\" was mentioned; there was just enough seriousness in De Foe's romance, just enough piety to appeal for sympathy to one of Captivity Waite's religious turn of mind. When it came to fiction involving witches, ogres, and flubdubs, that was too much for Captivity, and the spirit of the little Puritan revolted.  Yet I have the documentary evidence to prove that Captivity's ancestors (both paternal and maternal) were, in the palmy colonial times, as abject slaves to superstition as could well be imagined.  The Waites of Salem were famous persecutors of witches, and  Sinai Higginbotham (Captivity's great-great-grandfather on her mother's side of the family) was Cotton Mather's boon companion, and rode around the gallows with that zealous theologian on that memorable occasion when five young women were hanged at Danvers upon the charge of having tormented little children with their damnable arts of witchcraft.  Human thought is like a monstrous pendulum: it keeps swinging from one extreme to the other. Within the compass of five generations we find the Puritan first an uncompromising believer in demonology and magic, and then a scoffer at everything involving the play of fancy.  I felt harshly toward Captivity Waite for a time, but I harbor her no ill-will now; on the contrary, I recall with very tender feelings the distant time when our sympathies were the same and when we journeyed the pathway of early youth in a companionship sanctified by the innocence and the loyalty and the truth of childhood.  Indeed, I am not sure that that early friendship did not make a lasting impression upon my life; I have thought of Captivity Waite a great  many times, and I have not unfrequently wondered what might have been but for that book of fairy tales which my Uncle Cephas sent me.  She was a very pretty child, and she lost none of her comeliness and none of her sweetness of character as she approached maturity.  I was impressed with this upon my return from college. She, too, had pursued those studies deemed necessary to the acquirement of a good education; she had taken a four years' course at South Holyoke and had finished at Mrs. Willard's seminary at Troy.  \"You will now,\" said her father, and he voiced the New England sentiment regarding young womanhood; \"you will now return to the quiet of your home and under the direction of your mother study the performance of those weightier duties which qualify your sex for a realization of the solemn responsibilities of human life.\"  Three or four years ago a fine-looking young fellow walked in upon me with a letter of introduction from his mother.  He was Captivity Waite's son!  Captivity is a widow now, and she is still living in her native State, within twenty miles of the spot where she was born. Colonel Parker, her husband, left her a good property when he died, and she is famous for her charities. She has founded a village library, and she has written me on several occasions for advice upon proposed purchases of books.  I don't mind telling you that I had a good deal of malicious pleasure in sending her not long ago a reminder of old times in these words: \"My valued friend,\" I wrote, \"I see by the catalogue recently published that your village library contains, among other volumes representing the modern school of fiction, eleven copies of 'Trilby' and six copies of 'The Heavenly Twins.' I also note an absence of certain works whose influence upon my earlier life was such that I make bold to send copies of the same to your care in the hope that you will kindly present them to the library with my most cordial compliments.  These are a copy each of the 'New England Primer' and Grimm's 'Household Stories.'\"  At the age of twenty-three, having been graduated from college and having read the poems of Villon, the confessions of Rousseau, and Boswell's life of Johnson, I was convinced that I had comprehended the sum of human wisdom and knew all there was worth knowing.  If at the present time--for I am seventy-two--I knew as much as I thought I knew at twenty-three I should undoubtedly be a prodigy of learning and wisdom.  I started out to be a philosopher.  My grandmother's death during my second year at college possessed me of a considerable sum of money and severed every tie and sentimental obligation which had previously held me to my grandmother's wish that I become a minister of the gospel. When I became convinced that I knew everything I conceived a desire to see something, for I had traveled none and I had met but few people.  Upon the advice of my Uncle Cephas, I made a journey to Europe, and devoted two years to seeing sights and to acquainting myself with the people and the customs abroad.  Nine months of this time I spent in Paris, which was then an irregular and unkempt city, but withal quite as evil as at present.  I took apartments in the Latin  Quarter, and, being of a generous nature, I devoted a large share of my income to the support of certain artists and students whose talents and time were expended almost exclusively in the pursuit of pleasure.  While thus serving as a visible means of support to this horde of parasites, I fell in with the man who has since then been my intimate friend.  Judge Methuen was a visitor in Paris, and we became boon companions.  It was he who rescued me from the parasites and revived the flames of honorable ambition, which had well-nigh been extinguished by the wretched influence of Villon and Rousseau.  The Judge was a year my senior, and a wealthy father provided him with the means for gratifying his wholesome and refined tastes.  We two went together to London, and it was during our sojourn in that capital that I began my career as a collector of books.  It is simply justice to my benefactor to say that to my dear friend Methuen I am indebted for the inspiration which started me upon a course so full of sweet surprises and precious rewards.  There are very many kinds of book collectors, but I think all may be grouped in  three classes, viz.:  Those who collect from vanity; those who collect for the benefits of learning; those who collect through a veneration and love for books.  It is not unfrequent that men who begin to collect books merely to gratify their personal vanity find themselves presently so much in love with the pursuit that they become collectors in the better sense.  Just as a man who takes pleasure in the conquest of feminine hearts invariably finds himself at last ensnared by the very passion which he has been using simply for the gratification of his vanity, I am inclined to think that the element of vanity enters, to a degree, into every phase of book collecting; vanity is, I take it, one of the essentials to a well-balanced character--not a prodigious vanity, but a prudent, well-governed one.  But for vanity there would be no competition in the world; without competition there would be no progress.  In these later days I often hear this man or that sneered at because, forsooth, he collects books without knowing what the books are about. But for my part, I say that that  man bids fair to be all right; he has made a proper start in the right direction, and the likelihood is that, other things being equal, he will eventually become a lover, as well as a buyer, of books. Indeed, I care not what the beginning is, so long as it be a beginning.  There are different ways of reaching the goal. Some folk go horseback via the royal road, but very many others are compelled to adopt the more tedious processes, involving rocky pathways and torn shoon and sore feet.  So subtile and so infectious is this grand passion that one is hardly aware of its presence before it has complete possession of him; and I have known instances of men who, after having associated one evening with Judge Methuen and me, have waked up the next morning filled with the incurable enthusiasm of bibliomania.  But the development of the passion is not always marked by exhibitions of violence; sometimes, like the measles, it is slow and obstinate about \"coming out,\" and in such cases applications should be resorted to for the purpose of diverting the malady from the vitals; otherwise serious results may ensue.  Indeed, my learned friend Dr. O'Rell has met with several cases (as he informs me) in which suppressed bibliomania has resulted fatally.  Many of these cases have been reported in that excellent publication, the \"Journal of the American Medical Association,\" which periodical, by the way, is edited by ex-Surgeon-General Hamilton, a famous collector of the literature of ornament and dress.  To make short of a long story, the medical faculty is nearly a unit upon the proposition that wherever suppressed bibliomania is suspected immediate steps should be taken to bring out the disease.  It is true that an Ohio physician, named Woodbury, has written much in defence of the theory that bibliomania can be aborted; but a very large"]]]
