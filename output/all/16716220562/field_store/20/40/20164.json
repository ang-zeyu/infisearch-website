He walked in trepidation, speechless, and when interrogated on the height his eyes flew across the angry visages with dismal uncertainty.  Agostino perceived that he had undoubtedly not expected to come among them, and forthwith began to excite Giulio and Marco to the worst suspicions, in order to indulge his royal poetic soul with a study of a timorous wretch pushed to anticipations of extremity.  \"The execution of a spy,\" he preluded, \"is the signal for the ringing of joy-bells on this earth; not only because he is one of a pestiferous excess, in point of numbers, but that he is no true son of earth.  He escaped out of hell's doors on a windy day, and all that we do is to puff out a bad light, and send him back.  Look at this fellow in whom conscience is operating so that he appears like a corked volcano!  You can see that he takes Austrian money; his skin has got to be the exact colour of Munz.  He has the greenish-yellow eyes of those elective, thrice-abhorred vampyres who feed on patriot-blood.  He is condemned without trial by his villanous countenance, like an ungrammatical preface to a book.  His tongue refuses to confess, but nature is stronger:-- observe his knees.  Now this is guilt.  It is execrable guilt.  He is a nasty object.  Nature has in her wisdom shortened his stature to indicate that it is left to us to shorten the growth of his offending years.  Now, you dangling soul! answer me:--what name hailed you when on earth?\"  The fan, with no clearly serviceable tongue, articulated, \"Luigi.\"  \"Luigi!  the name Christian and distinctive.  The name historic:-Luigi Porco?\"  \"Luigi Saracco, signore.\"  \"Saracco: Saracco: very possibly a strip of the posterity of cut-throat Moors.  To judge by your face, a Moor undoubtedly: glib, slippery! with a body that slides and a soul that jumps.  Taken altogether, more serpent than eagle.  I misdoubt that little quick cornering eye of yours.  Do you ever remember to have blushed?\"  \"No, signore,\" said Luigi.  \"You spy upon the signorina, do you?\"  \"You have Beppo's word for that,\" interposed Marco Sana, growling.  \"And you are found spying on the mountain this particular day!  Luigi Saracco, you are a fellow of a tremendous composition.  A goose walking into a den of foxes is alone to be compared to you,--if ever such goose was!  How many of us did you count, now, when you were, say, a quarter of a mile below?\"  Marco interposed again: \"He has already seen enough up here to make a rope of florins.\"  \"The fellow's eye takes likenesses,\" said Giulio.  Agostino's question was repeated by Corte, and so sternly that Luigi, beholding kindness upon no other face save Vittoria's, watched her, and muttering \"Six,\" blinked his keen black eyes piteously to get her sign of assent to his hesitated naming of that number.  Her mouth and the turn of her head were expressive to him, and he cried \"Seven.\"  \"So; first six, and next seven,\" said Corte.  \"Six, I meant, without the signorina,\" Luigi explained.  \"You saw six of us without the signorina!  You see we are six here, including the signorina.  Where is the seventh?\"  Luigi tried to penetrate Vittoria's eyes for a proper response; but she understood the grave necessity for getting the full extent of his observations out of him, and she looked as remorseless as the men.  He feigned stupidity and sullenness, rage and cunning, in quick succession.  \"Who was the seventh?\" said Carlo.  \"Was it the king?\" Luigi asked.  This was by just a little too clever; and its cleverness, being seen, magnified the intended evasion so as to make it appear to them that Luigi knew well the name of the seventh.  Marco thumped a hand on his shoulder, shouting--  \"Here; speak out!  You saw seven of us.  Where has the seventh one gone?\"  Luigi's wits made a dash at honesty.  \"Down Orta, signore.\"  \"And down Orta, I think, you will go; deeper down than you may like.\"  Corte now requested Vittoria to stand aside.  He motioned to her with his hand to stand farther, and still farther off; and finally told Carlo to escort her to Baveno.  She now began to think that the man Luigi was in some perceptible danger, nor did Ammiani disperse the idea.  \"If he is a spy, and if he has seen the Chief, we shall have to detain him for at least four-and-twenty hours,\" he said, \"or do worse.\"  \"But, Signor Carlo,\"--Vittoria made appeal to his humanity,--\"do they mean, if they decide that he is guilty, to hurt him?\"  \"Tell me, signorina, what punishment do you imagine a spy deserves?\"  \"To be called one!\"  Carlo smiled at her lofty method of dealing with the animal.  \"Then you presume him to have a conscience?\"  \"I am sure, Signor Carlo, that I could make him loathe to be called a spy.\"  They were slowly pacing from the group, and were on the edge of the descent, when the signorina's name was shrieked by Luigi.  The man came running to her for protection, Beppo and the rest at his heels.  She allowed him to grasp her hand.  \"After all, he is my spy; he does belong to me,\" she said, still speaking on to Carlo.  \"I must beg your permission, Colonel Corte and Signor Marco, to try an experiment.  The Signor Carlo will not believe that a spy can be ashamed of his name.--Luigi!\"  \"Signorina!\"--he shook his body over her hand with a most plaintive utterance.  \"You are my countryman, Luigi?\"  \"Yes, signorina.\"  \"You are an Italian?\"  \"Certainly, signorina!\"  \"A spy!\"  Vittoria had not always to lift her voice in music for it to sway the hearts of men.  She spoke the word very simply in a mellow soft tone. Luigi's blood shot purple.  He thrust his fists against his ears.  \"See, Signor Carlo,\" she said; \"I was right.  Luigi, you will be a spy no more?\"  Carlo Ammiani happened to be rolling a cigarette-paper.  She put out her fingers for it, and then reached it to Luigi, who accepted it with singular contortions of his frame, declaring that he would confess everything to her.  \"Yes, signorina, it is true; I am a spy on you.  I know the houses you visit.  I know you eat too much chocolate for your voice.  I know you are the friend of the Signora Laura, the widow of Giacomo Piaveni, shot--shot on Annunciation Day.  The Virgin bless him! I know the turning of every street from your house near the Duomo to the signora's.  You go nowhere else, except to the maestro's.  And it's something to spy upon you.  But think of your Beppo who spies upon me! And your little mother, the lady most excellent, is down in Baveno, and she is always near you when you make an expedition.  Signorina, I know you would not pay your Beppo for spying upon me.  Why does he do it?  I do not sing 'Italia, Italia shall be free!'  I have heard you when I was under the maestro's windows; and once you sang it to the Signor Agostino Balderini.  \"Indeed, signorina, I am a sort of guardian of your voice.  It is not gold of the Tedeschi I get from the Signor Antonio Pericles.\"  At the mention of this name, Agostino and Vittoria laughed out.  \"You are in the pay of the Signor Antonio-Pericles,\" said Agostino.  \"Without being in our pay, you have done us the service to come up here among us!  Bravo!  In return for your disinterestedness, we kick you down, either upon Baveno or upon Stresa, or across the lake, if you prefer it.--The man is harmless.  He is hired by a particular worshipper of the signorina's voice, who affects to have first discovered it when she was in England, and is a connoisseur, a millionaire, a Greek, a rich scoundrel, with one indubitable passion, for which I praise him.  We will let his paid eavesdropper depart, I think.  He is harmless.\"  Neither Ugo nor Marco was disposed to allow any description of spy to escape unscotched.  Vittoria saw that Luigi's looks were against him, and whispered: \"Why do you show such cunning eyes, Luigi?\"  He replied: \"Signorina, take me out of their hearing, and I will tell you everything.\"  She walked aside.  He seemed immediately to be inspired with confidence, and stretched his fingers in the form of a grasshopper, at which sight they cried: \"He knows Barto Rizzo--this rascal!\"  They plied him with signs and countersigns, and speedily let him go.  There ensued a sharp snapping of altercation between Luigi and Beppo.  Vittoria had to order Beppo to stand back.  \"It is a poor dog, not of a good breed, signorina,\" Luigi said, casting a tolerant glance over his shoulder.  \"Faithful, but a poor nose.  Ah! you gave me this cigarette.  Not the Virgin could have touched my marrow as you did.  That's to be remembered by-and-by.  Now, you are going to sing on the night of the fifteenth of September.  Change that night.  The Signor Antonio-Pericles watches you, and he is a friend of the Government, and the Government is snoring for you to think it asleep. The Signor Antonio-Pericles pacifies the Tedeschi, but he will know all that you are doing, and how easy it will be, and how simple, for you to let me know what you think he ought to know, and just enough to keep him comfortable!  So we work like a machine, signorina.  Only, not through that Beppo, for he is vain of his legs, and his looks, and his service, and because he has carried a gun and heard it go off.  Yes; I am a spy. But I am honest.  I, too, have visited England.  One can be honest and a spy.  Signorina, I have two arms, but only one heart.  If you will be gracious and consider!  Say, here are two hands.  One hand does this thing, one hand does that thing, and that thing wipes out this thing.  It amounts to clear reasoning!  Here are two eyes.  Were they meant to see nothing but one side!  Here is a tongue with a line down the middle almost to the tip of it--which is for service.  That Beppo couldn't deal double, if he would; for he is imperfectly designed--a mere dog's pattern!  But, only one heart, signorina--mind that.  I will never forget the cigarette.  I shall smoke it before I leave the mountain, and think-- oh!\"  Having illustrated the philosophy "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4435"],["title","Vittoria — Volume 1 (#8)"],["body","his system, Luigi continued: \"I am going to tell you everything.  Pray, do not look on Beppo!  This is important.  The Signor Antonio-Pericles sent me to spy on you, because he expects some people to come up the mountain, and you know them; and one is an Austrian officer, and he is an Englishman by birth, and he is coming to meet some English friends who enter Italy from Switzerland over the Moro, and easily up here on mules or donkeys from Pella.  The Signor Antonio-Pericles has gold ears for everything that concerns the signorina.  \"A patriot is she!\" he says; and he is jealous of your English friends.  He thinks they will distract you from your studies; and perhaps\"--Luigi nodded sagaciously before he permitted himself to say-- \"perhaps he is jealous in another way.  I have heard him speak like a sonnet of the signorina's beauty.  The Signor Antonio-Pericles thinks that you have come here to-day to meet them.  When he heard that you were going to leave Milan for Baveno, he was mad, and with two fists up, against all English persons.  The Englishman who is an Austrian officer is quartered at Verona, and the Signor Antonio-Pericles said that the Englishman should not meet you yet, if he could help it.\"  Victoria stood brooding.  \"Who can it be,--who is an Englishman, and an Austrian officer, and knows me?\"  \"Signorina, I don't know names.  Behold, that Beppo is approaching like the snow!  What I entreat is, that the signorina will wait a little for the English party, if they come, so that I may have something to tell my patron.  To invent upon nothing is most unpleasant, and the Signor Antonio can soon perceive whether one swims with corks.  Signorina, I can dance on one rope--I am a man.  I am not a midge--I cannot dance upon nothing.\"  The days of Vittoria's youth had been passed in England.  It was not unknown to her that old English friends were on the way to Italy; the recollection of a quiet and a buried time put a veil across her features. She was perplexed by the mention of the Austrian officer by Luigi, as one may be who divines the truth too surely, but will not accept it for its loathsomeness.  There were Englishmen in the army of Austria.  Could one of them be this one whom she had cared for when she was a girl?  It seemed hatefully cruel to him to believe it.  She spoke to Agostino, begging him to remain with her on the height awhile to see whether the Signor Antonio-Pericles was right; to see whether Luigi was a truth- teller; to see whether these English persons were really coming. \"Because,\" she said, \"if they do come, it will at once dissolve any suspicions you may have of this Luigi.  And I always long so much to know if the Signor Antonio is correct.  I have never yet known him to be wrong.\"  \"And you want to see these English,\" said Agostino.  He frowned.  \"Only to hear them.  They shall not recognize me.  I have now another name; and I am changed.  My hat is enough to hide me.  Let me hear them talk a little.  You and the Signor Carlo will stay with me, and when they come, if they do come, I will remain no longer than just sufficient to make sure.  I would refuse to know any of them before the night of the fifteenth; I want my strength too much.  I shall have to hear a misery from them; I know it, I feel it; it turns my blood.  But let me hear their voices!  England is half my country, though I am so willing to forget her and give all my life to Italy.  Stay with me, dear friend, my best father! humour me, for you know that I am always charming when I am humoured.\"  Agostino pressed his finger on a dimple in her cheeks.  \"You can afford to make such a confession as that to a greybeard.  The day is your own. Bear in mind that you are so situated that it will be prudent for you to have no fresh relations, either with foreigners or others, until your work is done,--in which, my dear child, may God bless you!\"  \"I pray to him with all my might,\" Vittoria said in reply.  After a consultation with Agostino, Ugo Corte and Marco and Giulio bade their adieux to her.  The task of keeping Luigi from their clutches was difficult; but Agostino helped her in that also.  To assure them, after his fashion, of the harmlessness of Luigi, he seconded him in a contest of wit against Beppo, and the little fellow, now that he had shaken off his fears, displayed a quickness of retort and a liveliness \"unknown to professional spies and impossible to the race,\" said Agostino; \"so absolutely is the mind of man blunted by Austrian gold.  We know that for a fact.  Beppo is no match for him.  Beppo is sententious; ponderously illustrative; he can't turn; he is long-winded; he, I am afraid, my Carlo, studies the journals.  He has got your journalistic style, wherein words of six syllables form the relief to words of eight, and hardly one dares to stand by itself.  They are like huge boulders across a brook. The meaning, do you, see, would run of itself, but you give us these impedimenting big stones to help us over it, while we profess to understand you by implication.  For my part, I own, that to me, your parliamentary, illegitimate academic, modern crocodile phraseology, which is formidable in the jaws, impenetrable on the back, can't circumvent a corner, and is enabled to enter a common understanding solely by having a special highway prepared for it,--in short, the writing in your journals is too much for me.  Beppo here is an example that the style is useless for controversy.  This Luigi baffles him at every step.\"  \"Some,\" rejoined Carlo, \"say that Beppo has had the virtue to make you his study.\"  Agostino threw himself on his back and closed his eyes.  \"That, then, is more than you have done, signor Tuquoque.  Look on the Bernina yonder, and fancy you behold a rout of phantom Goths; a sleepy rout, new risen, with the blood of old battles on their shroud-shirts, and a North-east wind blowing them upon our fat land.  Or take a turn at the other side toward Orta, and look out for another invasion, by no means so picturesque, but preferable.  Tourists!  Do you hear them?\"  Carlo Ammiani had descried the advanced troop of a procession of gravely- heated climbers ladies upon donkeys, and pedestrian guards stalking beside them, with courier, and lacqueys, and baskets of provisions, all bearing the stamp of pilgrims from the great Western Island.     CHAPTER VI  A mountain ascended by these children of the forcible Isle, is a mountain to be captured, and colonized, and absolutely occupied for a term; so that Vittoria soon found herself and her small body of adherents observed, and even exclaimed against, as a sort of intruding aborigines, whose presence entirely dispelled the sense of romantic dominion which a mighty eminence should give, and which Britons expect when they have expended a portion of their energies.  The exclamations were not complimentary; nevertheless, Vittoria listened with pleased ears, as one listens by a brookside near an old home, hearing a music of memory rather than common words.  They talked of heat, of appetite, of chill, of thirst, of the splendour of the prospect, of the anticipations of good hotel accommodation below, of the sadness superinduced by the reflection that in these days people were found everywhere, and poetry was thwarted; again of heat, again of thirst, of beauty, and of chill.  There was the enunciation of matronly advice; there was the outcry of girlish insubordination; there were sighings for English ale, and namings of the visible ranges of peaks, and indicatings of geographical fingers to show where Switzerland and Piedmont met, and Austria held her grasp on Lombardy; and \"to this point we go to-night; yonder to-morrow; farther the next day,\" was uttered, soberly or with excitement, as befitted the age of the speaker.  Among these tourists there was one very fair English lady, with long auburn curls of the traditionally English pattern, and the science of Paris displayed in her bonnet and dress; which, if not as graceful as severe admirers of the antique in statuary or of the mediaeval in drapery demand, pleads prettily to be thought so, and commonly succeeds in its object, when assisted by an artistic feminine manner.  Vittoria heard her answer to the name of Mrs. Sedley.  She had once known her as a Miss Adela Pole.  Amidst the cluster of assiduous gentlemen surrounding this lady it was difficult for Vittoria's stolen glances to discern her husband; and the moment she did discern him she became as indifferent to him as was his young wife, by every manifestation of her sentiments. Mrs. Sedley informed her lord that it was not expected of him to care, or to pretend to care, for such scenes as the Motterone exhibited; and having dismissed him to the shade of an umbrella near the provision baskets, she took her station within a few steps of Vittoria, and allowed her attendant gentlemen to talk while she remained plunged in a meditative rapture at the prospect.  The talk indicated a settled scheme for certain members of the party to reach Milan from the Como road.  Mrs. Sedley was asked if she expected her brother to join her here or in Milan.  \"Here, if a man's promises mean anything,\" she replied languidly.  She was told that some one waved a handkerchief to them from below.  \"Is he alone?\" she said; and directing an operaglass upon the slope of the mountain, pursued, as in a dreamy disregard of circumstances: \"That is Captain Gambier.  My brother Wilfrid has not kept his appointment. Perhaps he could not get leave from the General; perhaps he is married; he is engaged to an Austrian Countess, I have heard.  Captain Gambier did me the favour to go round to a place called Stresa to meet him.  He has undertaken the journey for nothing.  It is the way with all journeys though this\" (the lady had softly reverted to her rapture) \"this is too exquisite!  Nature at least does not deceive.\"  Vittoria listened to a bubbling of meaningless chatter, until Captain Gambier had"]]]
