Nor shall I dream of persuading you that Angelo did right in defending her from that man.\"  \"I maintain that there are laws applicable to all human creatures,\" said the duchess.  \"You astonish me when you speak compassionately of such a criminal.\"  \"No; not of such a criminal, of such an unfortunate youth, and my countryman, when every hand is turned against him, and all tongues are reviling him.  But let Angelo pass; I pray to heaven he may escape.  All who are worth anything in our country are strained in every fibre, and it's my trick to be half in love with anyone of them when he is persecuted.  I fancy he is worth more than the others, and is simply luckless.  You must make allowances for us, Amalia--pity captive Judah!\"  \"I think, my Laura, you will never be satisfied till I have ceased to be Babylonian,\" said the duchess, smiling and fondling Vittoria, to whom she said, \"Am I not a complaisant German?\"  Vittoria replied gently, \"If they were like you!\"  \"Yes, if they were like the duchess,\" said Laura, \"nothing would be left for us then but to hate ourselves.  Fortunately, we deal with brutes.\"  She was quite pitiless in prompting Vittoria to hasten down, and marvelled at the evident reluctance in doing this slight duty, of one whose courage she had recently seen rise so high.  Vittoria was equally amazed by her want of sympathy, which was positive coldness, and her disregard for the sentiments of her hostess.  She dressed hesitatingly, responding with forlorn eyes to Laura's imperious \"Come.\"  When at last she was ready to descend, Laura took her dawn, full of battle.  The duchess had gone in advance to keep the peace.  The ladies of the Lenkenstein family were standing at one window of the morning room conversing.  Apart from them, Merthyr Powys and Wilfrid were examining one of the cumbrous antique arms ranged along the wall.  The former of these old English friends stepped up to Vittoria quickly and kissed her forehead.  Wilfrid hung behind him; he made a poor show of indifference, stammered English and reddened; remembering that he was under observation he recovered wonderfully, and asked, like a patron, \"How is the voice?\" which would have been foolish enough to Vittoria's more attentive hearing.  She thanked him for the service he had rendered her at La Scala.  Countess Lena, who looked hard at both, saw nothing to waken one jealous throb.  \"Bianca, you expressed a wish to give a salute to my eldest daughter,\" said Laura.  The Countess of Lenkenstein turned her head.  \"Have I done so?\"  \"It is my duty to introduce her,\" interposed the duchess, and conducted the ceremony with a show of its embracing these ladies, neither one of whom changed her cold gaze.  Careful that no pause should follow, she commenced chatting to the ladies and gentlemen alternately, keeping Vittoria under her peculiar charge. Merthyr alone seconded her efforts to weave the web of converse, which is an armistice if not a treaty on these occasions.  \"Have you any fresh caricatures from Vienna?\" Laura continued to address her sister.  \"None have reached me,\" said the neutral countess.  \"Have they finished laughing?\"  \"I cannot tell.\"  \"At any rate, we sing still,\" Laura smiled to Vittoria.  \"You shall hear us after breakfast.  I regret excessively that you were not in Milan on the Fifteenth.  We will make amends to you as much as possible.  You shall hear us after breakfast.  You will sing to please my sister, Sandra mia, will you not?\"  Vittoria shook her head.  Like those who have become passive, she read faces--the duchess's imploring looks thrown from time to time to the Lenkenstein ladies, Wilfrid's oppressed forehead, the resolute neutrality of the countess--and she was not only incapable of seconding Laura's aggressive war, but shrank from the involvement and sickened at the indelicacy.  Anna's eyes were fixed on her and filled her with dread lest she should be resolving to demand a private interview.  \"You refuse to sing?\" said Laura; and under her breath, \"When I bid you not, you insist!\"  \"Can she possibly sing before she grows accustomed to the air of the place?\" said the duchess.  Merthyr gravely prescribed a week's diet on grapes antecedent to the issuing of a note.  \"Have you never heard what a sustained grape-diet will do for the bullfinches?\"  \"Never,\" exclaimed the duchess.  \"Is that the secret of their German education?\"  \"Apparently, for we cannot raise them to the same pitch of perfection in England.\"  \"I will try it upon mine.  Every morning they shall have two big bunches.\"  \"Fresh plucked, and with the first sunlight on them.  Be careful of the rules.\"  Wilfrid remarked, \"To make them exhibit the results, you withdraw the benefit suddenly, of course?\"  \"We imitate the general run of Fortune's gifts as much as we can,\" said Merthyr.  \"That is the training for little shrill parrots: we have none in Italy,\" Laura sighed, mock dolefully; \"I fear the system would fail among us.\"  \"It certainly would not build Como villas,\" said Lena.  Laura cast sharp eyes on her pretty face.  \"It is adapted for caged voices that are required to chirrup to tickle the ears of boors.\"  Anna said to the duchess: \"I hope your little birds are all well this morning.\"  \"Come to them presently with me and let our ears be tickled,\" the duchess laughed in answer; and the spiked dialogue broke, not to revive.  The duchess had observed the constant direction of Anna's eyes upon Vittoria during the repast, and looked an interrogation at Anna, who replied to it firmly.  \"I must be present,\" the duchess whispered.  She drew Vittoria away by the hand, telling Merthyr Powys that it was unkind to him, but that he should be permitted to claim his fair friend from noon to the dinner-bell.  Laura and Bianca were discussing the same subject as the one for which Anna desired an interview with Vittoria.  It was to know the conditions and cause of the duel between Angelo Guidascarpi and Captain Weisspriess, and whither Angelo had fled.  \"In other words, you cry for vengeance under the name of justice,\" Laura phrased it, and put up a prayer for Angelo's escape.  The countess rebuked her.  \"It is men like Angelo who are a scandal to Italy.\"  \"Proclaimed so; but by what title are they judged?\"  Laura retorted. \"I have heard that his duel with Count Paul was fair, and that the grounds for it were just.  Deplore it; but to condemn an Italian gentleman without hearing his personal vindication, is infamous; nay, it is Austrian.  I know next to nothing of the story.  Countess Ammiani has assured me that the brothers have a clear defence--not from your Vienna point of view: Italy and Vienna are different sides of the shield.\"  Vittoria spoke most humbly before Anna; her sole irritating remark was, that even if she were aware of the direction of Angelo's flight, she would not betray him.  The duchess did her utmost to induce her to see that he was a criminal, outlawed from common charity.  \"These Italians are really like the Jews,\" she said to Anna; \"they appear to me to hold together by a bond of race: you cannot get them to understand that any act can be infamous when one of their blood is guilty of it.\"  Anna thought gloomily: \"Then, why do you ally yourself to them?\"  The duchess, with Anna, Lena, and Wilfrid, drove to the Ultenthal. Vittoria and Merthyr had a long afternoon of companionship.  She had been shyer in meeting him than in meeting Wilfrid, whom she had once loved. The tie between herself and Wilfrid was broken; but Merthyr had remained true to his passionless affection, which ennobled him to her so that her heart fluttered, though she was heavily depressed.  He relieved her by letting her perceive that Carlo Ammiani's merits were not unknown to him. Merthyr smiled at Carlo for abjuring his patrician birth.  He said: \"Count Ammiani will be cured in time of those little roughnesses of his adopted Republicanism.  You must help to cure him.  Women are never so foolish as men in these things.\"  When Merthyr had spoken thus, she felt that she might dare to press his hand.  Sharing friendship with this steadfast nature and brotherly gentleman; who was in the ripe manhood of his years; who loved Italy and never despaired; who gave great affection, and took uncomplainingly the possible return for it;--seemed like entering on a great plain open to boundless heaven.  She thought that friendship was sweeter than love. Merthyr soon left the castle to meet his sister at Coire.  Laura and Vittoria drove some distance up the Vintschgau, on the way to the Engadine, with him.  He affected not to be downcast by the failure of the last attempt at a rising in Milan.  \"Keep true to your Art; and don't let it be subservient to anything,\" he said, and his final injunction to her was that she should get a German master and practise rigidly.  Vittoria could only look at Laura in reply.  \"He is for us, but not of us,\" said Laura, as she kissed her fingers to him.  \"If he had told me to weep and pray,\" Vittoria murmured, \"I think I should by-and-by lift up my head.\"  \"By-and-by!  By-and-by I think I see a convent for me,\" said Laura.  Their faces drooped.  Vittoria cried: \"Ah! did he mean that my singing at La Scala was below the mark?\"  At this, Laura's laughter came out in a volume.  \"And that excellent Father Bernardus thinks he is gaining a convert!\" she said.  Vittoria's depression was real, though her strong vitality appeared to mock it.  Letters from Milan, enclosed to the duchess, spoke of Carlo Ammiani's imprisonment as a matter that might be indefinitely prolonged. His mother had been subjected to an examination; she had not hesitated to confess that she had received her nephew in her"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4439"],["title","Vittoria â€” Volume 5 (#6)"],["body","use, but it could not be established against her that it was not Carlo whom she had passed off to the sbirri as her son.  Countess Ammiani wrote to Laura, telling her she scarcely hoped that Carlo would obtain his liberty save upon the arrest of Angelo:--\"Therefore, what I most desire, I dare not pray for!\" That line of intense tragic grief haunted Vittoria like a veiled head thrusting itself across the sunlight.  Countess Ammiani added that she must give her son what news she could gather;--\"Concerning you,\" said Laura, interpreting the sentence: \"Bitter days do this good, they make a proud woman abjure the traditions of her caste.\"  A guarded answer was addressed, according to the countess's directions, to Sarpo the bookseller, in Milan.  For purposes of such a nature, Barto Rizzo turned the uneasy craven to account.  It happened that one of the maids at Sonnenberg was about to marry a peasant, of Meran, part proprietor of a vineyard, and the nuptials were to be celebrated at the castle.  Among those who thronged the courtyard on the afternoon of the ceremony, Vittoria beheld her faithful Beppo, who related the story of his pursuit of her, and the perfidy of Luigi;--a story so lengthy, that his voluble tongue running at full speed could barely give the outlines of it.  He informed her, likewise, that he had been sent for, while lying in Trent, by Captain Weisspriess, whom he had seen at an inn of the Ultenthal, weak but improving.  Beppo was the captain's propitiatory offering to Vittoria.  Meanwhile the ladies sat on a terrace, overlooking the court, where a stout fellow in broad green braces and blue breeches lay half across a wooden table, thrumming a zither, which set the groups in motion.  The zither is a melancholy little instrument; in range of expression it is to the harp what the winchat is to the thrush; or to the violin, what that bird is to the nightingale; yet few instruments are so exciting: here and there along these mountain valleys you may hear a Tyrolese maid set her voice to its plaintive thin tones; but when the strings are swept madly there is mad dancing; it catches at the nerves.  \"Andreas!  Andreas!\" the dancers shouted to encourage the player.  Some danced with vine-poles; partners broke and wandered at will, taking fresh partners, and occasionally huddling in confusion, when the poles were levelled and tilted at them, and they dispersed.  Beppo, dancing mightily to recover the use of his legs, met his acquaintance Jacob Baumwalder Feckelwitz, and the pair devoted themselves to a rivalry of capers; jump, stamp, shuffle, leg aloft, arms in air, yell and shriek: all took hands around them and streamed, tramping the measure, and the vine-poles guarded the ring. Then Andreas raised the song: \"Our Lady is gracious,\" and immediately the whole assemblage were singing praise to the Lady of the castle. Following which, wine being brought to Andreas, he drank to his lady, to his lady's guests, to the bride, to the, bridegroom, to everybody. He was now ready to improvize, and dashed thumb and finger on the zither, tossing up his face, swarthy-flushed: \"There was a steinbock with a beard.\"  Half-a-dozen voices repeated it, as to proclaim the theme.  Alas! a beard indeed, for there is no end to this animal.  I know him;\" said the duchess dolefully.                \"There was a steinbock with a beard;                Of no gun was he afeard                Piff-paff left of him: piff-paff right of him                Piff-paff everywhere, where you get a sight of him.\"  The steinbock led through the whole course of a mountaineer's emotions and experiences, with piff-paff continually left of him and right of him and nothing hitting him.  The mountaineer is perplexed; an able man, a dead shot, who must undo the puzzle or lose faith in his skill, is a tremendous pursuer, and the mountaineer follows the steinbock ever.  A 'sennderin' at a 'sennhutchen' tells him that she admitted the steinbock last night, and her curled hair frizzled under the steinbock's eyes.  The case is only too clear: my goodness! the steinbock is the----.  \"Der Teu .  .  .  !\" said Andreas, with a comic stop of horror, the rhyme falling cleverly to \"ai.\"  Henceforth the mountaineer becomes transformed into a champion of humanity, hunting the wicked bearded steinbock in all corners; especially through the cabinet of those dark men who decree the taxes detested in Tyrol.  The song had as yet but fairly commenced, when a break in the 'piff-paff' chorus warned Andreas that he was losing influence, women and men were handing on a paper and bending their heads over it; their responses hushed altogether, or were ludicrously inefficient.  \"I really believe the poor brute has come to a Christian finish--this Ahasuerus of steinbocks!\" said the duchess.  The transition to silence was so extraordinary and abrupt, that she called to her chasseur to know the meaning of it.  Feckelwitz fetched the paper and handed it up.  It exhibited a cross done in blood under the word 'Meran,' and bearing that day's date.  One glance at it told Laura what it meant.  The bride in the court below was shedding tears: the bridegroom was lighting his pipe and consoling her; women were chattering, men shrugging.  Some said they had seen an old grey-haired hag (hexe) stand at the gates and fling down a piece of paper.  A little boy whose imagination was alive with the tale of the steinbock, declared that her face was awful, and that she had only the, use of one foot.  A man patted him on the shoulder, and gave him a gulp of wine, saying with his shrewdest air: \"One may laugh at the devil once too often, though!\" and that sentiment was echoed; the women suggested in addition the possibility of the bride Lisa having something on her conscience, seeing that she had lived in a castle two years and more.  The potential persuasions of Father Bernardus were required to get the bride to go away to her husband's roof that evening: when she did make her departure, the superstitious peasantry were not a merry party that followed at her heels.  At the break-up of the festivities Wilfrid received an intimation that his sister had arrived in Meran from Bormio.  He went down to see her, and returned at a late hour.  The ladies had gone to rest.  He wrote a few underlined words, entreating Vittoria to grant an immediate interview in the library of the castle.  The missive was entrusted to Aennchen. Vittoria came in alarm.  \"My sister is perfectly well,\" said Wilfrid.  \"She has heard that Captain Gambier has been arrested in the mountains; she had some fears concerning you, which I quieted.  What I have to tell you, does not relate to her. The man Angelo Guidascarpi is in Meran.  I wish you to let the signora know that if he is not carried out of the city before sunset to-morrow, I must positively inform the superior officer of the district of his presence there.\"  This was their first private interview.  Vittoria (for she knew him) had acceded to it, much fearing that it would lead to her having to put on her sex's armour.  To collect her wits, she asked tremblingly how Wilfrid had chanced to see Angelo.  An old Italian woman, he said, had accosted him at the foot of the mountain, and hearing that he was truly an Englishman--\"I am out of my uniform,\" Wilfrid remarked with intentional bitterness--had conducted him to the house of an Italian in the city, where Angelo Guidascarpi was lying.  \"Ill?\" said Vittoria.  \"Just recovering.  After that duel, or whatever it may be called with Weisspriess, he lay all night out on the mountains.  He managed to get the help of a couple of fellows, who led him at dusk into Meran, saw an Italian name over a shop, and--I will say for them that the rascals hold together.  There he is, at all events.\"  \"Would you denounce a sick man, Wilfrid?\"  \"I certainly cannot forget my duty upon every point\"  \"You are changed!\"  \"Changed!  Am I the only one who is changed?\"  \"He must have supposed that it would be Merthyr.  I remember speaking of Merthyr to him as our unchangeable friend.  I told him Merthyr would be here.\"  \"Instead of Merthyr, he had the misfortune to see your changeable friend, if you will have it so.\"  \"But how can it be your duty to denounce him, Wilfrid.  You have quitted that army.\"  \"Have I?  I have forfeited my rank, perhaps.\"  \"And Angelo is not guilty of a military offence.\"  \"He has slain one of a family that I am bound to respect.\"  \"Certainly, certainly,\" said Vittoria hurriedly.  Her forehead showed distress of mind; she wanted Laura's counsel.  \"Wilfrid, do you know the whole story?\"  \"I know that he inveigled Count Paul to his house and slew him; either he or his brother, or both.\"  \"I have been with him for days, Wilfrid.  I believe that he would do no dishonourable thing.  He is related----\".  \"He is the cousin of Count Ammiani.\"  \"Ah! would you plunge us in misery?\"  \"How?\"  \"Count Ammiani is my lover.\"  She uttered it unblushingly, and with tender eyes fixed on him.  \"Your lover!\" he exclaimed, with vile emphasis.  \"He will be my husband,\" she murmured, while the mounting hot colour burned at her temples.  \"Changed--who is changed?\"  he said, in a vehement underneath.  \"For that reason I am to be false to her who does me the honour to care for me!\"  \"I would not have you false to her in thought or deed.\"  \"You ask me to spare this man on account of his relationship to your lover, and though he has murdered the brother of the lady whom I esteem. What on earth is the meaning of the petition?  Really, you amaze me.\"  \"I appeal to your generosity, Wilfrid, I am Emilia.\"  \"Are you?\"  She gave him her hand.  He took it, and felt at once the limit of all that he might claim.  Dropping the hand, he said:  \"Will nothing less than my ruin satisfy you?  Since that night at La Scala, I am in disgrace with my uncle; I expect at any moment to hear that I am cashiered from the army, if not a prisoner.  What is it that you ask of me now?  To"]]]
