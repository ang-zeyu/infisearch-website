God save the King!   From all ill thought and deed,   From heartless service and from selfish sway,   From treason, and the vain imagining   Of evil counsellors, and the noisome breed   Of flatterers who eat the soul away,   God save the King!    From loss and pain and tears   Such as her many years   Brought her; from battle and strife,   And the inmost hurt of life,   The wounds that no crown can heal,   No ermine robes conceal,   God save the King!    God, by our memories of his Mother's face,   By the love that makes our heart her dwelling-place,   Grant to our sorrow this desired grace:   God save the King!        *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    The Queen is dead. God save the King.   This is no hour when joy has leave to sing;   Only, amid our tears, we are bold to pray,   More boldly, in that we pray sorrowing,   In this most sorrowful day.   God, who wast of a mortal Mother born,   Who driest the tears with which Thy children mourn,   God, save the King!    Look down on him whose crown is wet with tears   In which its splendour fades and disappears--   His tears, our tears, tears out of all her lands.   The Queen is dead.   God! strengthen the King's hands!   God, save the King!     TRUE LOVE AND NEW LOVE.    OVER the meadow and down the lane   To the gate by the twisted thorn:   Your feet should know each turn of the way   You trod so many many a day,   Before the old love was put out of its pain,   Before the new love was born.    Kiss her, hold her and fold her close,   Tell her the old true tale:   You ought to know each turn of the phrase,--   You learned them all in the poor old days   Before the birth of the new red rose,   Before the old rose grew pale.    And do not fear I shall creep to-night   To make a third at your tryst:   My ghost, if it walked, would only wait   To scare the others away from the gate   Where you teach your new love the old delight,   With the lips that your old love kissed.     DEATH.    NEVER again:   No child shall stir the inmost heart of her   And teach her heaven by that first faint stir;   No little lips shall lie against her breast   Save the cold lips that now lie there at rest;   No little voice shall rouse her from her sleep   And bid her wake to pain:   Her sleep is calm and deep,   Call not! refrain.    Close in her arm   As though even death drew back before the face   Of Motherhood in this white stilly place,   The gathered bud lies waxen white and cold,   As ever a flower your winter gardens hold.   She bore the pain, she never wore the crown,   She worked the bitter charm,   But all she won thereby is here laid down   Renounced--for good or harm.    Dream? Feed your soul   With dreams, while we must starve our hearts on clay,   Dream of a glorious white-winged sun-crowned day   When you shall see her once more face to face   Beside Christ's Mother in the blessed place!   But while you dream, they carry her from here,   The black bells toll and toll.   Oh God! if only she cannot see or hear,   Not hear those ghoul-like bells that crowd so near,   Not see that cold clay hole.     IN MEMORY OF    SARETTA DEAKIN.    _Who Died on October 25th_, 1899.    THERE was a day,   A horrible Autumn day,   When from her home, the home she made for ours   And that day made a nightmare of white flowers   And folk in black who whispered pityingly,   They carried her away;   And left our hearts all cold   And empty, yet with such a store to hold   Of sodden grief the slow drops still ooze out,   And, falling on all fair things, they wither these.   Tears came with time--but not with time went by.    And still we wander desolate about   The poor changed house, the garden and the croft,   Warm kitchen, sunny parlour, with the soft   Intolerable pervading memories   Of her whose face and voice made melodies,   Sweet unforgotten songs of mother-love--   Dear songs of all the little joys that were.   We see the sun, and have no joy thereof,   Because she gathered in her dying hands   And carried with her to the fair far lands   The flower of all our joy, because she went   Out of the garden where her days were spent,   And took the very sun away with her.    The cross stands at her head.   Over her breast, that loving mother-breast,   Close buds of pansies purple and white are pressed.   It seems a place for rest,   For happy folded sleep; but ah, not there,   Not there, not there, our hardest tears are shed,   But in the house made empty for her sake.   Here, in the night intolerable, wake   The hungry passionate pains of Love still strong   To fight with death the bitter slow night long.   Then the rich price that poor Love has to pay   Is paid, slow drop by drop, till the new day   With thin cold fingers pushes back night's wings,   And drags us out to common cruel things   That sting, and barb their stings with memory.   O Love--and is the price too hard to give?   Thine is the splendour of all things that live,   And this thy pain the price of life to thee--   The sacrament that binds to the beloved,   The chain that holds though mountains be removed,   The portent of thine immortality.    So, in the house of pain imprisoned, we   Endure our bondage, and work out our time,   Nor seek from out our dungeon walls to climb--   Bondsmen, who would not, if we could, be free.   Thank God, our hands still hold Love's cord--and she--   Do not her hands still clasp the cord we hold,   Drawing us near, coiling bright fold on fold,   Till the far day when it shall draw us near   To the sight of her--her living hands, her dear   Tired face, grown weary of watching for our face?   And we shall hold her, in the happy place,   And hear her voice, the old same voice we knew--   \"Ah! children, I am tired of wanting you!\"    Or, in some world more beautiful and dear   Than any she ever even dreamed of here,   Where time is changed, does she await the day   She longed for, and so little a while away,   When all the love we watered with our tears   Shall bloom, transplanted by the kindly years?   Dreaming through her new garden does she go,   Remembering the old garden, long ago,   Tending new flowers more fair than those that grow   In this sad garden where such sad flowers blow;   And, fondly touching bud and leaf and shoot,   Training her flowers to perfect branch and root,   Does she sometimes entreat some darling flower   To wait a little for its opening hour?   Can you not hear her voice: \"Ah, not to-day,   While my dear flowers, my own, are far away.   Be patient, bud! to-morrow soon will come:   Ah! blossom when my little girl comes home!\"    But now. But here.   The empty house, the always empty place--   The black remembrance that no night blots out,   The memories, white, unbearable, and dear   That no white sunlight makes less cruel and clear?   The resistless riotous rout   Of cruel conquering thoughts, the night, the day?   Love is immortal: this the price to pay.   Worse than all pain it would be to forget--   On Love's brave brow the crown of thorns is set.   Love is no niggard: though the price be high   Into God's market Love goes forth to buy   With royal meed God's greatest gifts and gain,   Love offers up his whole rich store of pain,   And buys of God Love's immortality.     FOR DOROTHY, 18th August, 1900.    A PARTING.    I WILL not wake you, dear; no tears shall creep   To chill the still bed where you lie asleep;   No cry, no word, shall break the sanctity   Of the great silence where God lets you lie.   I will not tease your grave with flower or stone;   You are tired, my heart; you shall be left alone.   And even the kisses that my lips must lay   Upon the mould of the triumphant clay   Shall be so soft--like those a mother lays   Upon her sleeping baby's little face--   You will not feel my kisses, will not hear;   You are tired: sleep on, I will not wake you, dear!   But when the good day comes, you will hear me cry,   \"Ah, make a little place where I can lie!\"   And half awakened, you will feel me creep   Into the folds of your familiar sleep,   And draw them round us, with a tender moan,   \"How could you let me sleep so long alone?\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45135"],["title","The Thick of the Fray at Zeebrugge, April 1918 (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: cover art]  The Thick of the Fray at Zeebrugge    BY PERCY F.

For the twentieth time in the last two hours he had consulted his wristlet watch and compared it with the smoke-begrimed station clock. \"A proper lash-up if she doesn't.\"  It was 1.40 a.m. on a certain Monday in March of the year of grace 1918. Seton, warned by telegram to rejoin his ship, H.M. Torpedo-boat Destroyer _Bolero_, had been handicapped by reason of the Sunday train service. Due to report at Rosyth at 10 a.m. he found himself at midnight held up at Leeds with the unpleasant prospect of having to wait until 1.50 a.m. before the mail train took him on to Edinburgh.  Seton had been spending part of a well-earned spell of leave at his parents' house in the Peak District. An urgent message demanded his recall before half the period of leave had expired, which was no unusual occurrence in war-time. What was exasperating was the fact that the wire had been delivered at 6 p.m. on Sunday, and even by rushing off and catching the first available train Alec found, on perusing the time-table and consulting various railway officials, that it would be impossible to arrive at Edinburgh before twenty minutes minutes to eight on Monday morning. That left, only a little more than two hours to continue his journey to Inverkeithing and then on to Rosyth. Even then he had no idea where the _Bolero_ was lying, whether she was alongside the jetty or on moorings out on the Forth. To say the least it was \"cutting things a bit fine\", but it was a point of honour that, if humanly possible, Seton should report himself on board at the hour specified.  \"An' we were going into dock for eighteen days for refit,\" mused the Sub. \"Wonder what's butted in to upset things? Some stunt over the other side, or only another sea-trip out and home again, without catching sight of a measly Hun. By Jove, I'm hungry. I'm experiencing an unpleasant feeling in a certain sector of the front.\"  Vainly he regretted that on his hasty departure he had omitted to provide himself with refreshment. Counting on finding a restaurant-car he had been disappointed; while, on arriving at Leeds, he found it impossible at that hour to get a meal at an hotel. The sight of half a dozen Tommies in full field-kit emerging from a Y.M.C.A. refreshment-room, and dilating upon the excellence of the hot coffee and cakes, filled him with envious desires, which, however, did little to satisfy the cravings of the inner man.  \"Ah, I've no belt to tighten,\" he soliloquized grimly. \"Six or seven more hours to go, and not a chance of a snack. Hallo, what's this? Out of tobacco, too, by Jove.\" Very ruefully Alec surveyed his worn and trusted pouch. Only a pinch of dried dust remained.  \"The last straw,\" he muttered. \"Must grin and bear it, I suppose. I'd rather be keeping middle watch somewhere in the North Sea.\"  A truck, propelled by an undersized man, came into view. The truck was surmounted by a green box with glass panels and brass rails. From a small funnel steam was issuing. Already half a dozen belated passengers were crowding round the new arrival.  \"A perambulating coffee-stall,\" declared Alec. \"My luck's turned.\"  Two minutes later he was sampling the wares of the itinerant vendor. The result was not only disappointing but repugnant, for the beverage, termed coffee by the man presiding over the stall, bore a strong resemblance to greasy water, while the cake was more like sawdust than war-bread at its worst.  Disgustedly Alec left his purchase practically untouched, and resumed his tedious beat up and down the draughty platform, until the long-expected night mail train pulled up at the station.  Through the steam-laden atmosphere Alec made his way, trying to find an unoccupied compartment. Foiled in this direction he edged along the corridor until he almost cannoned into a uniformed attendant.  \"All sleeping compartments engaged, sir,\" replied the man; \"but I'll find you a smoker with only one other passenger. This way, sir.\"  He threw open the blind-drawn sliding door, and switched on one of the four electric lights. One of the seats was unoccupied. On the other was stretched a somnolent figure almost completely enveloped in a large fawn rug, bedizened with the Railway Company's monogram. The sleeper's face was turned towards the partition. On the rack overhead were two weather-beaten portmanteaux, and a naval cap with a tarnished R.N.V.R. badge.  Alec slipped half-a-crown into the attendant's hand.  \"No thanks,\" he replied in answer to the man's inquiry; \"I'll be quite comfortable in the circs. Sorry there isn't a tobacco-stall on the train.\"  He stowed his gear to his satisfaction, patted his empty tobacco-pouch to make sure for the fifth time that it was empty, and then contemplated his soundly-sleeping companion.  \"Since it seems that I've a mouldy messmate,\" he soliloquized, \"the best that I can do is to follow his example and turn in.\"  Switching off the solitary light Alec stretched himself upon the seat, using his great-coat as a pillow. He was asleep before the train left Leeds.  Beyond a slight return to wakefulness as the train pulled up at Carlisle, Alec slept soundly until the first gleam of dawn began to steal through the carriage windows.  He glanced at his wristlet watch. It was half-past five. Sitting up he stretched his cramped limbs.  \"By Jove, I am hungry,\" he muttered. \"Won't I make up for it when I get aboard.\"  Almost the next moment all sense of physical discomfort vanished, as he caught sight of the wonderful vista that met his view. The train was climbing the steep ascent of the hills of Roxburgh. Snow lay deep upon the ground, while the peaks were only partly visible in the grey morning mists. Alec had seen many varieties of scenery in widely different parts of the world, but, as an admirer of nature, he was never tired of \"viewing the land\".  \"Magnificent!\" he murmured enthusiastically. \"It's worth a night in the train. I've seen the Peak of Teneriffe at sunrise, but our country takes a lot of beating.\"  A swirling cloud of steam beat against the window pane, momentarily obscuring the outlook. Before it cleared Alec was astonished to hear his name shouted in boisterous tones.  \"Alec Seton, by all the powers! What, in the name of all that's wonderful, brings you here?\"  Seton's \"mouldy messmate\" was sitting up and rubbing his eyes--a bronzed, shock-headed youth, who looked, despite his uniform, little more than a schoolboy. His features expanded into a broad grin of whole-hearted delight as he extended a large, horny hand.  For a brief instant Alec was at a loss to recognize his fellow-traveller, then--  \"Branscombe, my festive buccaneer.\"  Guy Branscombe, Sub-lieutenant, R.N.V.R., was one of those war-time productions whose existence, as members of the \"band of brothers\" under the White Ensign, has been amply justified. He had been a candidate for Osborne, but had failed to satisfy the examiners. Now, taking advantage of his undoubted skill as an amateur yachtsman, he was doing good service both in deep-sea and coastal navigation. These two branches are widely distinct. Generally speaking, officers of the \"pukka\" navy are indifferent navigators in coastal waters. Inside the \"five fathom line\" they often lack the confidence that the skilled amateur possesses. Thus the Admiralty soon found the need to accept the offers of British yachtsmen to take command of"]]]
