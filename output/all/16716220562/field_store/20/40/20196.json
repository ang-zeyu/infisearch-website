These red spectres are born of earthquake, and are more given to shaking thrones than are hostile cannonshot.  Earthquakes are dreadfuller than common maladies to all of us.  Fortune may help him, but he has not the look of one who commands her.  The face is not aquiline.  There's a light over him like the ray of a sickly star.\"  \"For that reason!\"  Vittoria burst out.  \"Oh, for that reason we pity men, assuredly, my Sandra, but not kings. Luckless kings are not generous men, and ungenerous men are mischievous kings.\"  \"But if you find him chivalrous and devoted; if he proves his noble intentions, why not support him?\"  \"Dandle a puppet, by all means,\" said Laura.  Her intellect, not her heart, was harsh to the king; and her heart was not mistress of her intellect in this respect, because she beheld riding forth at the head of Italy one whose spirit was too much after the pattern of her supple, springing, cowering, impressionable sex, alternately ardent and abject, chivalrous and treacherous, and not to be confided in firmly when standing at the head of a great cause.  Aware that she was reading him very strictly by the letters of his past deeds, which were not plain history to Vittoria, she declared that she did not countenance suspicion in dealing with the king, and that it would be a delight to her to hear of his gallant bearing on the battle-field. \"Or to witness it, my Sandra, if that were possible;--we two!  For, should he prove to be no General, he has the courage of his family.\"  Vittoria took fire at this.  \"What hinders our following the army?\"  \"The less baggage the better, my dear.\"  \"But the king said that my singing--I have no right to think it myself.\" Vittoria concluded her sentence with a comical intention of humility.  \"It was a pretty compliment,\" said Laura.  \"You replied that singing is a poor thing in time of war, and I agree with you.  We might serve as hospital nurses.\"  \"Why do we not determine?\"  \"We are only considering possibilities.\"  \"Consider the impossibility of our remaining quiet.\"  \"Fire that goes to flame is a waste of heat, my Sandra.\"  The signora, however, was not so discreet as her speech.  On all sides there was uproar and movement.  High-born Italian ladies were offering their hands for any serviceable work.  Laura and Vittoria were not alone in the desire which was growing to be resolution to share the hardships of the soldiers, to cherish and encourage them, and by seeing, to have the supreme joy of feeling the blows struck at the common enemy.  The opera closed when the king marched.  Carlo Ammiani's letter was handed to Vittoria at the fall of the curtain on the last night.  Three paths were open to her: either that she should obey her lover, or earn an immense sum of money from Antonio-Pericles by accepting an immediate engagement in London, or go to the war.  To sit in submissive obedience seemed unreasonable; to fly from Italy impossible.  Yet the latter alternative appealed strongly to her sense of duty, and as it thereby threw her lover's commands into the background, she left it to her heart to struggle with Carlo, and thought over the two final propositions.  The idea of being apart from Italy while the living country streamed forth to battle struck her inflamed spirit like the shock of a pause in martial music.  Laura pretended to take no part in Vittoria's decision, but when it was reached, she showed her a travelling-carriage stocked with lint and linen, wine in jars, chocolate, cases of brandy, tea, coffee, needles, thread, twine, scissors, knives; saying, as she displayed them, \"there, my dear, all my money has gone in that equipment, so you must pay on the road.\"  \"This doesn't leave me a choice, then,\" said Victoria, joining her humour.  \"Ah, but think over it,\" Laura suggested.  \"No!  not think at all,\" cried Vittoria.  \"You do not fear Carlo's anger?\"  \"If I think, I am weak as water.  Let us go.\"  Countess d'Isorella wrote to Carlo: \"Your Vittoria is away after the king to Pavia.  They tell me she stood up in her carriage on the Ponte del Po -'Viva il Re d'Italia!' waving the cross of Savoy.  As I have previously assured you, no woman is Republican.  The demonstration was a mistake. Public characters should not let their personal preferences betrumpeted: a diplomatic truism:--but I must add, least of all a cantatrice for a king.  The famous Greek amateur--the prop of failing finances--is after her to arrest her for breach of engagement.  You wished to discover an independent mind in a woman, my Carlo; did you not?  One would suppose her your wife--or widow.  She looked a superb thing the last night she sang.  She is not, in my opinion, wanting in height.  If, behind all that innocence and candour, she has any trained artfulness, she will beat us all.  Heaven bless your arms!\"  The demonstration mentioned by the countess had not occurred.  Vittoria's letter to her lover missed him.  She wrote from Pavia, after she had taken her decisive step.  Carlo Ammiani went into the business of the war with the belief that his betrothed had despised his prayer to her.  He was under Colonel Corte, operating on the sub-Alpine range of hills along the line of the Chiese South-eastward.  Here the volunteers, formed of the best blood of Milan, the gay and brave young men, after marching in the pride of their strength to hold the Alpine passes and bar Austria from Italy while the fight went on below, were struck by a sudden paralysis.  They hung aloft there like an arm cleft from the body. Weapons, clothes, provisions, money, the implements of war, were withheld from them.  The Piedmontese officers despatched to watch their proceedings laughed at them like exasperating senior scholars examining the accomplishments of a lower form.  It was manifest that Count Medole and the Government of Milan worked everywhere to conquer the people for the king before the king had done a stroke to conquer the Austrians for the people; while, in order to reduce them to the condition of Piedmontese soldiery, the flame of their patriotic enthusiasm was systematically damped, and instead of apprentices in war, who possessed at any rate the elementary stuff of soldiers, miserable dummies were drafted into the royal service.  The Tuscans and the Romans had good reason to complain on behalf of their princes, as had the Venetians and the Lombards for the cause of their Republic.  Neither Tuscans, Romans, Venetians, nor Lombards were offering up their lives simply to obtain a change of rulers; though all Italy was ready to bow in allegiance to a king of proved kingly quality.  Early in the campaign the cry of treason was muttered, and on all sides such became the temper of the Alpine volunteers, that Angelo and Rinaldo Guidascarpi were forced to join their cousin under Corte, by the dispersion of their band, amounting to something more than eighteen hundred fighting lads, whom a Piedmontese superior officer summoned peremptorily to shout for the king.  They thundered as one voice for the Italian Republic, and instantly broke up and disbanded.  This was the folly of the young: Carlo Ammiani confessed that it was no better; but he knew that a breath of generous confidence from the self-appointed champion of the national cause would have subdued his impatience at royalty and given heart and cheer to his sickening comrades.  He began to frown angrily when he thought of Vittoria.  \"Where is she now?--where now?\"  he asked himself in the season of his most violent wrath at the king.  Her conduct grew inseparable in his mind from the king's deeds.  The sufferings, the fierce irony, the very deaths of the men surrounding him in aims, rose up in accusation against the woman he loved.     CHAPTER XXXI  EPISODES OF THE REVOLT AND THE WAR  THE TREACHERY OF PERICLES--THE WHITE UMBRELLA--THE DEATH OF RINALDO GUIDASCARPI  The king crossed the Mincio.  The Marshal, threatened on his left flank, drew in his line from the farther Veronese heights upon a narrowed battle front before Verona.  Here they manoeuvred, and the opening successes fell to the king.  Holding Peschiera begirt, with one sharp passage of arms he cleared the right bank of the Adige and stood on the semicircle of hills, master of the main artery into Tyrol.  The village of Pastrengo has given its name to the day.  It was a day of intense heat coming after heavy rains.  The arid soil steamed; the white powder-smoke curled in long horizontal columns across the hazy ring of the fight.  Seen from a distance it was like a huge downy ball, kicked this way and that between the cypresses by invisible giants.  A pair of eager-eyed women gazing on a battle-field for the first time could but ask themselves in bewilderment whether the fate of countries were verily settled in such a fashion.  Far in the rear, Vittoria and Laura heard the cannon-shots; a sullen dull sound, as of a mallet striking upon rotten timber.  They drove at speed.  The great thumps became varied by musketry volleys, that were like blocks of rockboulder tumbled in the roll of a mountain torrent.  These, then, were the voices of Italy and Austria speaking the devilish tongue of the final alternative.  Cannon, rockets, musketry, and now the run of drums, now the ring of bugles, now the tramp of horses, and the field was like a landslip.  A joyful bright black death-wine seemed to pour from the bugles all about.  The women strained their senses to hear and see; they could realize nothing of a reality so absolute; their feelings were shattered, and crowded over them in patches;--horror, glory, panic, hope, shifted lights within their bosoms. The fascination and repulsion of the image of Force divided them.  They feared; they were prostrate; they sprang in praise.  The image of Force was god and devil to their souls.  They strove to understand why the field was marked with blocks of men who made a plume of vapour here, and hurried thither.

ANNA OF LENKENSTEIN    CHAPTER XXXIII  EPISODES OF THE REVOLT AND THE WAR  COUNT KARL LENKENSTEIN--THE STORY OF THE GUIDASCARPI--THE VICTORY OF THE VOLUNTEERS  The smoke of a pistol-shot thinned away while there was yet silence.  \"It is a saving of six charges of Austrian ammunition,\" said Pericles.  Vittoria stared at the scene, losing faith in her eyesight.  She could in fact see no distinct thing beyond what appeared as an illuminated copper medallion, held at a great distance from her, with a dead man and a towering female figure stamped on it.  The events following were like a rush of water on her senses.  There was fighting up the street of the village, and a struggle in the space where Rinaldo had fallen; successive yellowish shots under the rising moonlight, cries from Italian lips, quick words of command from German in Italian, and one sturdy bull's roar of a voice that called across the tumult to the Austro-Italian soldiery, \"Venite fratelli!--come, brothers, come under our banner!\"  She heard \"Rinaldo!\"  called.  This was a second attack of the volunteers for the rescue of their captured comrades.  They fought more desperately than on the hill outside the village: they fought with steel.  Shot enfiladed them; yet they bore forward in a scattered body up to that spot where Rinaldo lay, shouting for him.  There they turned,--they fled.  Then there was a perfect stillness, succeeding the strife as quickly, Vittoria thought, as a breath yielded succeeds a breath taken.  She accused the heavens of injustice.  Pericles, prostrate on the floor, moaned that he was wounded.  She said, \"Bleed to death!\"  \"It is my soul, it is my soul is wounded for you, Sandra.\"  \"Dreadful craven man!\" she muttered.  \"When my soul is shaking for your safety, Sandra Belloni!\" Pericles turned his ear up.  \"For myself--not; it is for you, for you.\"  Assured of the cessation of arms by delicious silence he jumped to his feet.  \"Ah! brutes to fight.  It is 'immonde;' it is unnatural!\"  He tapped his finger on the walls for marks of shot, and discovered a shot-hole in the wood-work, that had passed an arm's length above her head, into which he thrust his finger in an intense speculative meditation, shifting eyes from it to her, and throwing them aloft.  He was summoned to the presence of Count Karl, with whom he found Captain Weisspriess, Wilfrid, and officers of jagers and the Italian battalion. Barto Rizzo's wife was in a corner of the room.  Weisspriess met him with a very civil greeting, and introduced him to Count Karl, who begged him to thank Vittoria for the aid she had afforded to General Schoneck's emissary in crossing the Piedmontese lines.  He spoke in Italian.  He agreed to conduct Pericles to a point on the route of his march, where Pericles and his precious prima donna--\"our very good friend,\" he said, jovially--could escape the risk of unpleasant mishaps, and arrive at Trent and cities of peace by easy stages.  He was marching for the neighbourhood of Vicenza.  A little before dawn Vittoria came down to the carriage.  Count Karl stood at the door to hand her in.  He was young and handsome, with a soft flowing blonde moustache and pleasant eyes, a contrast to his brother Count Lenkenstein.  He repeated his thanks to her, which Pericles had not delivered; he informed her that she was by no means a prisoner, and was simply under the guardianship of friends--\"though perhaps, signorina, you will not esteem this gentleman to be one of your friends.\"  He pointed to Weisspriess.  The officer bowed, but kept aloof.  Vittoria perceived a singular change in him: he had become pale and sedate.  \"Poor fellow!  he has had his dose,\" Count Karl said.  \"He is, I beg to assure you, one of your most vehement admirers.\"  A piece of her property that flushed her with recollections, yet made her grateful, was presently handed to her, though not in her old enemy's presence, by a soldier.  It was the silver-hilted dagger, Carlo's precious gift, of which Weisspriess had taken possession in the mountain- pass over the vale of Meran, when he fought the duel with Angelo. Whether intended as a peace-offering, or as a simple restitution, it helped Vittoria to believe that Weisspriess was no longer the man he had been.  The march was ready, but Barto Rizzo's wife refused to move a foot.  The officers consulted.  She, was brought before them.  The soldiers swore with jesting oaths that she had been carefully searched for weapons, and only wanted a whipping.  \"She must have it,\" said Weisspriess.  Vittoria entreated that she might have a place beside her in the carriage.  \"It is more than I would have asked of you; but if you are not afraid of her,\" said Count Karl, with an apologetic shrug.  Her heart beat fast when she found herself alone with the terrible woman.  Till then she had never seen a tragic face.  Compared with this tawny colourlessness, this evil brow, this shut mouth, Laura, even on the battle-field, looked harmless.  It was like the face of a dead savage. The eyeballs were full on Vittoria, as if they dashed at an obstacle, not embraced an image.  In proportion as they seemed to widen about her, Vittoria shrank.  The whole woman was blood to her gaze.  When she was capable of speaking, she said entreatingly:  \"I knew his brother.\"  Not a sign of life was given in reply.  Companionship with this ghost of broad daylight made the flattering Tyrolese feathers at both windows a welcome sight.  Precautions had been taken to bind the woman's arms.  Vittoria offered to loosen the cords, but she dared not touch her without a mark of assent.  \"I know Angelo Guidascarpi, Rinaldo's brother,\" she spoke again.  The woman's nostrils bent inward, as when the breath we draw is keen as a sword to the heart.  Vittoria was compelled to look away from her.  At the mid-day halt Count Karl deigned to justify to her his intended execution of Rinaldo--the accomplice in the slaying of his brother Count Paula.  He was evidently eager to obtain her good opinion of the Austrian military.  \"But for this miserable spirit of hatred against us,\" he said, \"I should have espoused an Italian lady;\" and he asked, \"Why not?  For that matter, in all but blood we Lenkensteins are half Italian, except when Italy menaces the empire.  Can you blame us for then drawing the sword in earnest?\"  He proffered his version of the death of Count Paul.  She kept her own silent in her bosom.  Clelia Guidascarpi, according to his statement, had first been slain by her brothers.  Vittoria believed that Clelia had voluntarily submitted to death and died by her own hand.  She was betrothed to an Italian nobleman of Bologna, the friend of the brothers.  They had arranged the marriage; she accepted the betrothal.  \"She loved my brother, poor thing!\"  said Count Karl.  \"She concealed it, and naturally.  How could she take a couple of wolves into her confidence?  If she had told the pair of ruffians that she was plighted to an Austrian, they would have quieted her at an earlier period.  A woman! a girl--signorina!  The intolerable cowardice amazes me.  It amazes me that you or anyone can uphold the character of such brutes.  And when she was dead they lured my brother to the house and slew him; fell upon him with daggers, stretched him at the foot of her coffin, and then--what then?--ran! ran for their lives.  One has gone to his account.  We shall come across the other.  He is among that volunteer party which attacked us yesterday.  The body was carried off by them; it is sufficient testimony that Angelo Guidascarpi is in the neighbourhood.  I should be hunting him now but that I am under orders to march South-east.\"  The story, as Vittoria knew it, had a different, though yet a dreadful, colour.  \"I could have hanged Rinaldo,\" Count Karl said further.  \"I suppose the rascals feared I should use my right, and that is why they sent their mad baggage of a woman to spare any damage to the family pride.  If I had been a man to enjoy vengeance, the rope would have swung for him.  In spite of provocation, I shall simply shoot the other; I pledge my word to it.  They shall be paid in coin.  I demand no interest.\"  Weisspriess prudently avoided her.  Wilfrid held aloof.  She sat in garden shade till the bugle sounded.  Tyrolese and Italian soldiers were gibing at her haggard companion when she entered the carriage.  Fronting this dumb creature once more, Vittoria thought of the story of the brothers.  She felt herself reading it from the very page.  The woman looked that evil star incarnate which Laura said they were born under.  This is in brief the story of the Guidascarpi.  They were the offspring of a Bolognese noble house, neither wealthy nor poor.  In her early womanhood, Clelia was left to the care of her brothers.  She declined the guardianship of Countess Ammiani because of her love for them; and the three, with their passion of hatred to the Austrians inherited from father and mother, schemed in concert to throw off the Austrian yoke.  Clelia had soft features of no great mark; by her colouring she was beautiful, being dark along the eyebrows, with dark eyes, and a surpassing richness of Venetian hair.  Bologna and Venice were married in her aspect.  Her brothers conceived her to possess such force of mind that they held no secrets from her.  They did not know that the heart of their sister was struggling with an image of Power when she uttered hatred of it.  She was in truth a woman of a soft heart, with a most impressionable"]]]
