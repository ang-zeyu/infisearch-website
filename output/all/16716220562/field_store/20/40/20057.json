In taking military possession of Texas after annexation, the army of occupation, under General Taylor, was directed to occupy the disputed territory.  The army did not stop at the Nueces and offer to negotiate for a settlement of the boundary question, but went beyond, apparently in order to force Mexico to initiate war.  It is to the credit of the American nation, however, that after conquering Mexico, and while practically holding the country in our possession, so that we could have retained the whole of it, or made any terms we chose, we paid a round sum for the additional territory taken; more than it was worth, or was likely to be, to Mexico.  To us it was an empire and of incalculable value; but it might have been obtained by other means.  The Southern rebellion was largely the outgrowth of the Mexican war.  Nations, like individuals, are punished for their transgressions.  We got our punishment in the most sanguinary and expensive war of modern times.  The 4th infantry went into camp at Salubrity in the month of May, 1844, with instructions, as I have said, to await further orders.  At first, officers and men occupied ordinary tents.  As the summer heat increased these were covered by sheds to break the rays of the sun.  The summer was whiled away in social enjoyments among the officers, in visiting those stationed at, and near, Fort Jessup, twenty-five miles away, visiting the planters on the Red River, and the citizens of Natchitoches and Grand Ecore.  There was much pleasant intercourse between the inhabitants and the officers of the army.  I retain very agreeable recollections of my stay at Camp Salubrity, and of the acquaintances made there, and no doubt my feeling is shared by the few officers living who were there at the time.  I can call to mind only two officers of the 4th infantry, besides myself, who were at Camp Salubrity with the regiment, who are now alive.  With a war in prospect, and belonging to a regiment that had an unusual number of officers detailed on special duty away from the regiment, my hopes of being ordered to West Point as instructor vanished.  At the time of which I now write, officers in the quartermaster's, commissary's and adjutant--general's departments were appointed from the line of the army, and did not vacate their regimental commissions until their regimental and staff commissions were for the same grades.  Generally lieutenants were appointed to captaincies to fill vacancies in the staff corps.  If they should reach a captaincy in the line before they arrived at a majority in the staff, they would elect which commission they would retain.  In the 4th infantry, in 1844, at least six line officers were on duty in the staff, and therefore permanently detached from the regiment.  Under these circumstances I gave up everything like a special course of reading, and only read thereafter for my own amusement, and not very much for that, until the war was over.  I kept a horse and rode, and staid out of doors most of the time by day, and entirely recovered from the cough which I had carried from West Point, and from all indications of consumption.  I have often thought that my life was saved, and my health restored, by exercise and exposure, enforced by an administrative act, and a war, both of which I disapproved.  As summer wore away, and cool days and colder nights came upon us, the tents. We were occupying ceased to afford comfortable quarters; and \"further orders\" not reaching us, we began to look about to remedy the hardship.  Men were put to work getting out timber to build huts, and in a very short time all were comfortably housed--privates as well as officers.  The outlay by the government in accomplishing this was nothing, or nearly nothing.  The winter was spent more agreeably than the summer had been.  There were occasional parties given by the planters along the \"coast\"--as the bottom lands on the Red River were called.  The climate was delightful.  Near the close of the short session of Congress of 1844-5, the bill for the annexation of Texas to the United States was passed.  It reached President Tyler on the 1st of March, 1845, and promptly received his approval.  When the news reached us we began to look again for \"further orders.\"  They did not arrive promptly, and on the 1st of May following I asked and obtained a leave of absence for twenty days, for the purpose of visiting--St. Louis.  The object of this visit has been before stated.  Early in July the long expected orders were received, but they only took the regiment to New Orleans Barracks.  We reached there before the middle of the month, and again waited weeks for still further orders. The yellow fever was raging in New Orleans during the time we remained there, and the streets of the city had the appearance of a continuous well-observed Sunday.  I recollect but one occasion when this observance seemed to be broken by the inhabitants.  One morning about daylight I happened to be awake, and, hearing the discharge of a rifle not far off, I looked out to ascertain where the sound came from.  I observed a couple of clusters of men near by, and learned afterwards that \"it was nothing; only a couple of gentlemen deciding a difference of opinion with rifles, at twenty paces.\"  I do not remember if either was killed, or even hurt, but no doubt the question of difference was settled satisfactorily, and \"honorably,\" in the estimation of the parties engaged.  I do not believe I ever would have the courage to fight a duel.  If any man should wrong me to the extent of my being willing to kill him, I would not be willing to give him the choice of weapons with which it should be done, and of the time, place and distance separating us, when I executed him.  If I should do another such a wrong as to justify him in killing me, I would make any reasonable atonement within my power, if convinced of the wrong done.  I place my opposition to duelling on higher grounds than here stated.  No doubt a majority of the duels fought have been for want of moral courage on the part of those engaged to decline.  At Camp Salubrity, and when we went to New Orleans Barracks, the 4th infantry was commanded by Colonel Vose, then an old gentleman who had not commanded on drill for a number of years.  He was not a man to discover infirmity in the presence of danger.  It now appeared that war was imminent, and he felt that it was his duty to brush up his tactics. Accordingly, when we got settled down at our new post, he took command of the regiment at a battalion drill.  Only two or three evolutions had been gone through when he dismissed the battalion, and, turning to go to his own quarters, dropped dead.  He had not been complaining of ill health, but no doubt died of heart disease.  He was a most estimable man, of exemplary habits, and by no means the author of his own disease.    CHAPTER IV.  CORPUS CHRISTI--MEXICAN SMUGGLING--SPANISH RULE IN MEXICO--SUPPLYING TRANSPORTATION.  Early in September the regiment left New Orleans for Corpus Christi, now in Texas.  Ocean steamers were not then common, and the passage was made in sailing vessels.  At that time there was not more than three feet of water in the channel at the outlet of Corpus Christi Bay; the debarkation, therefore, had to take place by small steamers, and at an island in the channel called Shell Island, the ships anchoring some miles out from shore. This made the work slow, and as the army was only supplied with one or two steamers, it took a number of days to effect the landing of a single regiment with its stores, camp and garrison equipage, etc.  There happened to be pleasant weather while this was going on, but the land-swell was so great that when the ship and steamer were on opposite sides of the same wave they would be at considerable distance apart.  The men and baggage were let down to a point higher than the lower deck of the steamer, and when ship and steamer got into the trough between the waves, and were close together, the load would be drawn over the steamer and rapidly run down until it rested on the deck.  After I had gone ashore, and had been on guard several days at Shell Island, quite six miles from the ship, I had occasion for some reason or other to return on board.  While on the Suviah--I think that was the name of our vessel--I heard a tremendous racket at the other end of the ship, and much and excited sailor language, such as \"damn your eyes,\" etc.  In a moment or two the captain, who was an excitable little man, dying with consumption, and not weighing much over a hundred pounds, came running out, carrying a sabre nearly as large and as heavy as he was, and crying, that his men had mutinied.  It was necessary to sustain the captain without question, and in a few minutes all the sailors charged with mutiny were in irons.  I rather felt for a time a wish that I had not gone aboard just then.  As the men charged with mutiny submitted to being placed in irons without resistance, I always doubted if they knew that they had mutinied until they were told.  By the time I was ready to leave the ship again I thought I had learned enough of the working of the double and single pulley, by which passengers were let down from the upper deck of the ship to the steamer below, and determined to let myself down without assistance.  Without saying anything of my intentions to any one, I mounted the railing, and taking hold of the centre rope, just below the upper block, I put one foot on the hook below the lower block, and stepped off just as I did so some one called out \"hold on.\"  It was too late.  I tried to \"hold on\" with all my might, but my heels went up, and my head went down so rapidly that my hold broke, and I plunged head foremost into the water, some twenty-five feet below, with such velocity that it seemed to me I never would stop.  When I came to the surface again, being a fair swimmer, and not having lost my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4367"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Complete (#7)"],["body","of mind, I swam around until a bucket was let down for me, and I was drawn up without a scratch or injury. I do not believe there was a man on board who sympathized with me in the least when they found me uninjured.  I rather enjoyed the joke myself. The captain of the Suviah died of his disease a few months later, and I believe before the mutineers were tried.  I hope they got clear, because, as before stated, I always thought the mutiny was all in the brain of a very weak and sick man.  After reaching shore, or Shell Island, the labor of getting to Corpus Christi was slow and tedious.  There was, if my memory serves me, but one small steamer to transport troops and baggage when the 4th infantry arrived.  Others were procured later.  The distance from Shell Island to Corpus Christi was some sixteen or eighteen miles.  The channel to the bay was so shallow that the steamer, small as it was, had to be dragged over the bottom when loaded.  Not more than one trip a day could be effected.  Later this was remedied, by deepening the channel and increasing the number of vessels suitable to its navigation.  Corpus Christi is near the head of the bay of the same name, formed by the entrance of the Nueces River into tide-water, and is on the west bank of that bay.  At the time of its first occupancy by United States troops there was a small Mexican hamlet there, containing probably less than one hundred souls. There was, in addition, a small American trading post, at which goods were sold to Mexican smugglers.  All goods were put up in compact packages of about one hundred pounds each, suitable for loading on pack mules.  Two of these packages made a load for an ordinary Mexican mule, and three for the larger ones.  The bulk of the trade was in leaf tobacco, and domestic cotton-cloths and calicoes.  The Mexicans had, before the arrival of the army, but little to offer in exchange except silver.  The trade in tobacco was enormous, considering the population to be supplied.  Almost every Mexican above the age of ten years, and many much younger, smoked the cigarette.  Nearly every Mexican carried a pouch of leaf tobacco, powdered by rolling in the hands, and a roll of corn husks to make wrappers.  The cigarettes were made by the smokers as they used them.  Up to the time of which I write, and for years afterwards--I think until the administration of President Juarez--the cultivation, manufacture and sale of tobacco constituted a government monopoly, and paid the bulk of the revenue collected from internal sources.  The price was enormously high, and made successful smuggling very profitable.  The difficulty of obtaining tobacco is probably the reason why everybody, male and female, used it at that time.  I know from my own experience that when I was at West Point, the fact that tobacco, in every form, was prohibited, and the mere possession of the weed severely punished, made the majority of the cadets, myself included, try to acquire the habit of using it.  I failed utterly at the time and for many years afterward; but the majority accomplished the object of their youthful ambition.  Under Spanish rule Mexico was prohibited from producing anything that the mother-country could supply.  This rule excluded the cultivation of the grape, olive and many other articles to which the soil and climate were well adapted.  The country was governed for \"revenue only;\" and tobacco, which cannot be raised in Spain, but is indigenous to Mexico, offered a fine instrumentality for securing this prime object of government.  The native population had been in the habit of using \"the weed\" from a period, back of any recorded history of this continent. Bad habits--if not restrained by law or public opinion--spread more rapidly and universally than good ones, and the Spanish colonists adopted the use of tobacco almost as generally as the natives.  Spain, therefore, in order to secure the largest revenue from this source, prohibited the cultivation, except in specified localities--and in these places farmed out the privilege at a very high price.  The tobacco when raised could only be sold to the government, and the price to the consumer was limited only by the avarice of the authorities, and the capacity of the people to pay.  All laws for the government of the country were enacted in Spain, and the officers for their execution were appointed by the Crown, and sent out to the New El Dorado.  The Mexicans had been brought up ignorant of how to legislate or how to rule. When they gained their independence, after many years of war, it was the most natural thing in the world that they should adopt as their own the laws then in existence.  The only change was, that Mexico became her own executor of the laws and the recipient of the revenues.  The tobacco tax, yielding so large a revenue under the law as it stood, was one of the last, if not the very last, of the obnoxious imposts to be repealed.  Now, the citizens are allowed to cultivate any crops the soil will yield.  Tobacco is cheap, and every quality can be produced. Its use is by no means so general as when I first visited the country.  Gradually the \"Army of Occupation\" assembled at Corpus Christi.  When it was all together it consisted of seven companies of the 2d regiment of dragoons, four companies of light artillery, five regiments of infantry --the 3d, 4th, 5th, 7th and 8th--and one regiment of artillery acting as infantry--not more than three thousand men in all.  General Zachary Taylor commanded the whole.  There were troops enough in one body to establish a drill and discipline sufficient to fit men and officers for all they were capable of in case of battle.  The rank and file were composed of men who had enlisted in time of peace, to serve for seven dollars a month, and were necessarily inferior as material to the average volunteers enlisted later in the war expressly to fight, and also to the volunteers in the war for the preservation of the Union. The men engaged in the Mexican war were brave, and the officers of the regular army, from highest to lowest, were educated in their profession. A more efficient army for its number and armament, I do not believe ever fought a battle than the one commanded by General Taylor in his first two engagements on Mexican--or Texan soil.  The presence of United States troops on the edge of the disputed territory furthest from the Mexican settlements, was not sufficient to provoke hostilities.  We were sent to provoke a fight, but it was essential that Mexico should commence it.  It was very doubtful whether Congress would declare war; but if Mexico should attack our troops, the Executive could announce, \"Whereas, war exists by the acts of, etc.,\" and prosecute the contest with vigor.  Once initiated there were but few public men who would have the courage to oppose it.  Experience proves that the man who obstructs a war in which his nation is engaged, no matter whether right or wrong, occupies no enviable place in life or history.  Better for him, individually, to advocate \"war, pestilence, and famine,\" than to act as obstructionist to a war already begun.  The history of the defeated rebel will be honorable hereafter, compared with that of the Northern man who aided him by conspiring against his government while protected by it.  The most favorable posthumous history the stay-at-home traitor can hope for is--oblivion.  Mexico showing no willingness to come to the Nueces to drive the invaders from her soil, it became necessary for the \"invaders\" to approach to within a convenient distance to be struck. Accordingly, preparations were begun for moving the army to the Rio Grande, to a point near Matamoras.  It was desirable to occupy a position near the largest centre of population possible to reach, without absolutely invading territory to which we set up no claim whatever.  The distance from Corpus Christi to Matamoras is about one hundred and fifty miles.  The country does not abound in fresh water, and the length of the marches had to be regulated by the distance between water supplies.  Besides the streams, there were occasional pools, filled during the rainy season, some probably made by the traders, who travelled constantly between Corpus Christi and the Rio Grande, and some by the buffalo. There was not at that time a single habitation, cultivated field, or herd of domestic animals, between Corpus Christi and Matamoras.  It was necessary, therefore, to have a wagon train sufficiently large to transport the camp and garrison equipage, officers' baggage, rations for the army, and part rations of grain for the artillery horses and all the animals taken from the north, where they had been accustomed to having their forage furnished them.  The army was but indifferently supplied with transportation.  Wagons and harness could easily be supplied from the north but mules and horses could not so readily be brought.  The American traders and Mexican smugglers came to the relief.  Contracts were made for mules at from eight to eleven dollars each.  The smugglers furnished the animals, and took their pay in goods of the description before mentioned.  I doubt whether the Mexicans received in value from the traders five dollars per head for the animals they furnished, and still more, whether they paid anything but their own time in procuring them.  Such is trade; such is war.  The government paid in hard cash to the contractor the stipulated price.  Between the Rio Grande and the Nueces there was at that time a large band of wild horses feeding; as numerous, probably, as the band of buffalo roaming further north was before its rapid extermination commenced.  The Mexicans used to capture these in large numbers and bring them into the American settlements and sell them.  A picked animal could be purchased at from eight to twelve dollars, but taken at wholesale, they could be bought for thirty-six dollars a dozen.  Some of these were purchased for the"]]]
