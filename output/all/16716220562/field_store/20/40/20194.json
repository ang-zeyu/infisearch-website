Romara, with Angelo and his Swiss and the ranks of the barricade, poured over and pierced the streaming mass, steel for steel.  \"Ammiani!  Ammiani!\" Romara cried; a roar from the other side, \"Barto! Barto! the Great Cat!\"  met the cry.  The Austrians struck up a cheer under the iron derision of the bells; it was ludicrous, it was as if a door had slammed on their mouths, ringing tremendous echoes in a vaulted roof.  They stood sweeping fire in two oblong lines; a show of military array was preserved like a tattered robe, till Romara drove at their centre and left the retreat clear across the barricade.  Then the whitecoats were seen flowing over, the motley surging hosts from the city in pursuit--foam of a storm-torrent hurled forward by the black tumult of precipitous waters.  Angelo fell on his brother's neck; Romara clasped Carlo Ammiani.  These two were being marched from the prison to the citadel when Barto Rizzo, who had prepared to storm the building, assailed the troops.  To him mainly they were indebted for their rescue.  Even in that ecstasy of meeting, the young men smiled at the preternatural transport on his features as he bounded by them, mad for slaughter, and mounting a small brass gun on the barricade, sent the charges of shot into the rear of the enemy.  He kissed the black lip of his little thunderer in, a rapture of passion; called it his wife, his naked wife; the best of mistresses, who spoke only when he charged her to speak; raved that she was fair, and liked hugging; that she was true, and the handsomest daughter of Italy; that she would be the mother of big ones--none better than herself, though they were mountains of sulphur big enough to make one gulp of an army.  His wife in the flesh stood at his feet with a hand-grenade and a rifle, daggers and pistols in her belt.  Her face was black with powder-smoke as the muzzle of the gun.  She looked at Rinaldo once, and Rinaldo at her; both dropped their eyes, for their joy at seeing one another alive was mighty.  Dead Austrians were gathered in a heap.  Dead and wounded Milanese were taken into the houses.  Wine was brought forth by ladies and household women.  An old crutched beggar, who had performed a deed of singular intrepidity in himself kindling a fire at the door of one of the principal buildings besieged by the people, and who showed perforated rags with a comical ejaculation of thanks to the Austrians for knowing how to hit a scarecrow and make a beggar holy, was the object of particular attention.  Barto seated him on his gun, saying that his mistress and beauty was honoured; ladies were proud in waiting on the fine frowzy old man.  It chanced during that morning that Wilfrid Pierson had attached himself to Lieutenant Jenna's regiment as a volunteer.  He had no arms, nothing but a huge white umbrella, under which he walked dry in the heavy rain, and passed through the fire like an impassive spectator of queer events.  Angelo's Swiss had captured them, and the mob were maltreating them because they declined to shout for this valorous ancient beggarman.  \"No doubt he's a capital fellow,\" said Jenna; \"but 'Viva Scottocorni' is not my language;\" and the spirited little subaltern repeated his \"Excuse me,\" with very good temper, while one knocked off his shako, another tugged at his coat-skirts.  Wilfrid sang out to the Guidascarpi, and the brothers sprang to him and set them free; but the mob, like any other wild beast gorged with blood, wanted play, and urged Barto to insist that these victims should shout the viva in exaltation of their hero.  \"Is there a finer voice than mine?\" said Barto, and he roared the 'viva' like a melodious bull.  Yet Wilfrid saw that he had been recognized.  In the hour of triumph Barto Rizzo had no lust for petty vengeance.  The magnanimous devil plumped his gorge contentedly on victory.  His ardour blazed from his swarthy crimson features like a blown fire, when scouts came running down with word that all about the Porta Camosina, Madonna del Carmine, and the Gardens, the Austrians were reaping the white flag of the inhabitants of that district.  Thitherward his cry of \"Down with the Tedeschi!\" led the boiling tide.  Rinaldo drew Wilfrid and Jenna to an open doorway, counselling the latter to strip the gold from his coat and speak his Italian in monosyllables.  A woman of the house gave her promise to shelter and to pass them forward.  Romara, Ammiani, and the Guidascarpi, went straight to the Casa Gonfalonieri, where they hoped to see stray members of the Council of War, and hear a correction of certain unpleasant rumours concerning the dealings of the Provisional Government with Charles Albert.  The first crack of a division between the patriot force and the aristocracy commenced this day; the day following it was a breach.  A little before dusk the bells of the city ceased their hammering, and when they ceased, all noises of men and musketry seemed childish.  The woman who had promised to lead Wilfrid and Jenna to the citadel, feared no longer either for herself or them, and passed them on up the Corso Francesco past the Contrada del Monte.  Jenna pointed out the Duchess of Graatli's house, saying, \"By the way, the Lenkensteins are here; they left Venice last week.  Of course you know, or don't you?--and there they must stop, I suppose.\"  Wilfrid nodded an immediate good-bye to him, and crossed to the house-door.  His eccentric fashion of acting had given him fame in the army, but Jenna stormed at it now, and begged him to come on and present himself to General Schoneck, if not to General Pierson. Wilfrid refused even to look behind him.  In fact, it was a part of the gallant fellow's coxcombry (or nationality) to play the Englishman.  He remained fixed by the housedoor till midnight, when a body of men in the garb of citizens, volubly and violently Italian in their talk, struck thrice at the door.  Wilfrid perceived Count Lenkenstein among them. The ladies Bianca, Anna, and Lena issued mantled and hooded between the lights of two barricade watchfires.  Wilfrid stepped after them.  They had the password, for the barricades were crossed.  The captain of the head-barricade in the Corso demurred, requiring a counter-sign. Straightway he was cut down.  He blew an alarm-call, when up sprang a hundred torches.  The band of Germans dashed at the barricade as at the tusks of a boar.  They were picked men, most of them officers, but a scanty number in the thick of an armed populace.  Wilfrid saw the lighted passage into the great house, and thither, throwing out his arms, he bore the affrighted group of ladies, as a careful shepherd might do. Returning to Count Lenkenstein's side, \"Where are they?\"  the count said, in mortal dread.  \"Safe,\" Wilfrid replied.  The count frowned at him inquisitively.  \"Cut your way through, and on!\" he cried to three or four who hung near him; and these went to the slaughter.  \"Why do you stand by me, sir?\" said the count.  Interior barricades were pouring their combatants to the spot; Count Lenkenstein was plunged upon the door-steps.  Wilfrid gained half-a-minute's parley by shouting in his foreign accent, \"Would you hurt an Englishman?\"  Some one took him by the arm, and helping to raise the count, hurried them both into the house.  \"You must make excuses for popular fury in times like these,\" the stranger observed.  The Austrian nobleman asked him stiffly for his name.  The name of Count Ammiani was given.  \"I think you know it,\" Carlo added.  \"You escaped from your lawful imprisonment this day, did you not?--you and your cousin, the assassin.  I talk of law!  I might as justly talk of honour.  Who lives here?\"  Carlo contained himself to answer, \"The present occupant is, I believe, if I have hit the house I was seeking, the Countess d'Isorella.\"  \"My family were placed here, sir?\" Count Lenkenstein inquired of Wilfrid. But Wilfrid's attention was frozen by the sight of Vittoria's lover.  A wifely call of \"Adalbert\" from above quieted the count's anxiety.  \"Countess d'Isorella,\" he said.  \"I know that woman.  She belongs to the secret cabinet of Carlo Alberto--a woman with three edges.  Did she not visit you in prison two weeks ago?  I speak to you, Count Ammiani.  She applied to the Archduke and the Marshal for permission to visit you.  It was accorded.  To the devil with our days of benignity!  She was from Turin.  The shuffle has made her my hostess for the nonce.  I will go to her.  You, sir,\" the count turned to Wilfrid--\"you will stay below.  Are you in the pay of the insurgents?\"  Wilfrid, the weakest of human beings where women were involved with him, did one of the hardest things which can task a young man's fortitude: he looked his superior in the face, and neither blenched, nor frowned, nor spoke.  Ammiani spoke for him.  \"There is no pay given in our ranks.\"  \"The licence to rob is supposed to be an equivalent,\" said the count.  Countess d'Isorella herself came downstairs, with profuse apologies for the absence of all her male domestics, and many delicate dimples about her mouth in uttering them.  Her look at Ammiani struck Wilfrid as having a peculiar burden either of meaning or of passion in it.  The count grimaced angrily when he heard that his sister Lena was not yet able to bear the fatigue of a walk to the citadel.  \"I fear you must all be my guests, for an hour at least,\" said the countess.  Wilfrid was left pacing the hall.  He thought he had never beheld so splendid a person, or one so subjugatingly gracious.  Her speech and manner poured oil on the uncivil Austrian nobleman.  What perchance had stricken Lena?  He guessed; and guessed it rightly.  A folded scrap of paper signed by the Countess of Lenkenstein was brought to him.  It said:--\"Are you making common cause with the rebels?  Reply.  One asks who should be told.\"  He wrote:--\"I am an outcast of the army.  I fight"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4440"],["title","Vittoria — Volume 6 (#5)"],["body"," a volunteer with the K. K.  troops.  Could I abandon them in their peril?\"  The touch of sentiment he appended for Lena's comfort.  He was too strongly impressed by the new vision of beauty in the house for his imagination to be flushed by the romantic posture of his devotion to a trailing flag.  No other message was delivered.  Ammiani presently descended and obtained a guard from the barricade; word was sent on to the barricades in advance toward the citadel.  Wilfrid stood aside as Count Lenkenstein led the ladies to the door, bearing Lena on his arm.  She passed her lover veiled.  The count said, \"You follow.\"  He used the menial second person plural of German, and repeated it peremptorily.  \"I follow no civilian,\" said Wilfrid.  \"Remember, sir, that if you are seen with arms in your hands, and are not in the ranks, you run the chances of being hanged.\"  Lena broke loose from her brother; in spite of Anna's sharp remonstrance and the count's vexed stamp of the foot, she implored her lover:--\"Come with us; pardon us; protect me--me!  You shall not be treated harshly. They shall not Oh! be near me.  I have been ill; I shrink from danger. Be near me!\"  Such humble pleading permitted Wilfrid's sore spirit to succumb with the requisite show of chivalrous dignity.  He bowed, and gravely opened his enormous umbrella, which he held up over the heads of the ladies, while Ammiani led the way.  All was quiet near the citadel.  A fog of plashing rain hung in red gloom about the many watchfires of the insurgents, but the Austrian head-quarters lay sombre and still.  Close at the gates, Ammiani saluted the ladies.  Wilfrid did the same, and heard Lena's call to him unmoved.  \"May I dare to hint to you that it would be better for you to join your party?\"  said Ammiani.  Wilfrid walked on.  After appearing to weigh the matter, he answered, \"The umbrella will be of no further service to them to-night.\"  Ammiani laughed, and begged to be forgiven; but he could have done nothing more flattering.  Sore at all points, tricked and ruined, irascible under the sense of his injuries, hating everybody and not honouring himself, Wilfrid was fast growing to be an eccentric by profession.  To appear cool and careless was the great effort of his mind.  \"We were introduced one day in the Piazza d'Armi,\" said Ammiani. \"I would have found means to convey my apologies to you for my behaviour on that occasion, but I have been at the mercy of my enemies.  Lieutenant Pierson, will you pardon me?  I have learnt how dear you and your family should be to me.  Pray, accept my excuses and my counsel.  The Countess Lena was my friend when I was a boy.  She is in deep distress.\"  \"I thank you, Count Ammiani, for your extremely disinterested advice,\" said Wilfrid; but the Italian was not cut to the quick by his irony; and he added: \"I have hoisted, you perceive, the white umbrella instead of wearing the white coat.  It is almost as good as an hotel in these times; it gives as much shelter and nearly as much provision, and, I may say, better attendance.  Good-night.  You will be at it again about daylight, I suppose?\"  \"Possibly a little before,\" said Ammiani, cooled by the false ring of this kind of speech.  \"It's useless to expect that your infernal bells will not burst out like all the lunatics on earth?\"  \"Quite useless, I fear.  Good-night.\"  Ammiani charged one of the men at an outer barricade to follow the white umbrella and pass it on.  He returned to the Countess d'Isorella, who was awaiting him, and alone.  This glorious head had aroused his first boyish passion.  Scandal was busy concerning the two, when Violetta d'Asola, the youthfullest widow in Lombardy and the loveliest woman, gave her hand to Count d'Isorella, who took it without question of the boy Ammiani.  Carlo's mother assisted in that arrangement; a maternal plot, for which he could thank her only after he had seen Vittoria, and then had heard the buzz of whispers at Violetta's name.  Countess d'Isorella proved her friendship to have survived the old passion, by travelling expressly from Turin to obtain leave to visit him in prison.  It was a marvellous face to look upon between prison walls.  Rescued while the soldiers were marching him to the citadel that day, he was called by pure duty to pay his respects to the countess as soon as he had heard from his mother that she was in the city.  Nor was his mother sorry that he should go.  She had patiently submitted to the fact of his betrothal to Vittoria, which was his safeguard in similar perils; and she rather hoped for Violetta to wean him from his extreme republicanism.  By arguments?  By influence, perhaps.  Carlo's republicanism was preternatural in her sight, and she presumed that Violetta would talk to him discreetly and persuasively of the noble designs of the king.  Violetta d'Isorella received him with a gracious lifting of her fingers to his lips; congratulating him on his escape, and on the good fortune of the day.  She laughed at the Lenkensteins and the singular Englishman; sat down to a little supper-tray, and pouted humorously as she asked him to feed on confects and wine; the huge appetites of the insurgents had devoured all her meat and bread.  \"Why are you here?\"  he said.  She did well in replying boldly, \"For the king.\"  \"Would you tell another that it is for the king?\"  \"Would I speak to another as I speak to you?\"  Ammiani inclined his head.  They spoke of the prospects of the insurrection, of the expected outbreak in Venice, the eruption of Paris and Vienna, and the new life of Italy; touching on Carlo Alberto to explode the truce in a laughing dissension. At last she said seriously, \"I am a born Venetian, you know; I am not Piedmontese.  Let me be sure that the king betrays the country, and I will prefer many heads to one.  Excuse me if I am more womanly just at present.  The king has sent his accredited messenger Tartini to the Provisional Government, requesting it to accept his authority.  Why not? why not?  on both sides.  Count Medole gives his adhesion to the king, but you have a Council of War that rejects the king's overtures--a revolt within a revolt.  \"It is deplorable.  You must have an army.  The Piedmontese once over the Ticino, how can you act in opposition to it?  You must learn to take a master.  The king is only, or he appears, tricksy because you compel him to wind and counterplot.  I swear to you, Italy is his foremost thought. The Star of Italy sits on the Cross of Savoy.\"  Ammiani kept his eyelids modestly down.  \"Ten thousand to plead for him, such as you!\" he said.  \"But there is only one!\"  \"If you had been headstrong once upon a time, and I had been weak, you see, my Carlo, you would have been a domestic tyrant, I a rebel.  You will not admit the existence of a virtue in an opposite opinion.  Wise was your mother when she said 'No' to a wilful boy!\"  Violetta lit her cigarette and puffed the smoke lightly.  \"I told you in that horrid dungeon, my Carlo Amaranto--I call you by the old name--the old name is sweet!--I told you that your Vittoria is enamoured of the king.  She blushes like a battle-flag for the king. I have heard her 'Viva il Re!' It was musical.\"  \"So I should have thought.\"  \"Ay, but my amaranto-innamorato, does it not foretell strife?  Would you ever--ever take a heart with a king's head stamped on it into your arms?\"  \"Give me the chance!\"  He was guilty of this ardent piece of innocence though Violetta had pitched her voice in the key significant of a secret thing belonging to two memories that had not always flowed dividedly.  \"Like a common coin?\" she resumed.  \"A heart with a king's head stamped on it like a common coin.\"  He recollected the sentence.  He had once, during the heat of his grief for Giacomo Piaveni, cast it in her teeth.  Violetta repeated it, as to herself, tonelessly; a method of making an old unkindness strike back on its author with effect.  \"Did we part good friends?  I forget,\" she broke the silence.  \"We meet, and we will be the best of friends,\" said Ammiani.  \"Tell your mother I am not three years older than her son,--I am thirty. Who will make me young again?  Tell her, my Carlo, that the genius for intrigue, of which she accuses me, develops at a surprising rate.  As regards my beauty,\" the countess put a tooth of pearl on her soft under lip.  Ammiani assured her that he would find words of his own for her beauty.  \"I hear the eulogy, I know the sonnet,\" said Violetta, smiling, and described the points of a brunette: the thick black banded hair, the full brown eyes, the plastic brows couching over them;--it was Vittoria's face: Violetta was a flower of colour, fair, with but one shade of dark tinting on her brown eye-brows and eye-lashes, as you may see a strip of night-cloud cross the forehead of morning.  She was yellow-haired, almost purple-eyed, so rich was the blue of the pupils.  Vittoria could be sallow in despondency; but this Violetta never failed in plumpness and freshness.  The pencil which had given her aspect the one touch of discord, endowed it with a subtle harmony, like mystery; and Ammiani remembered his having stood once on the Lido of Venice, and eyed the dawn across the Adriatic, and dreamed that Violetta was born of the loveliness and held in her bosom the hopes of morning.  He dreamed of it now, feeling the smooth roll of a torrent.  A cry of \"Arms!\" rang down the length of the Corso.  He started to his feet thankfully.  \"Take me to your mother,\" she said.  \"I loathe to hear firing and be alone.\"  Ammiani threw up the window.  There was a stir of lamps and torches below, and the low sky hung red.  Violetta stood quickly thick-shod and hooded.  \"Your mother will admit my companionship, Carlo?\"  \"She desires to thank you.\"  \"She has no longer any fear of me?\"  \"You will find her of one mind with you.\"  \"Concerning the king!\"  \"I would say, on most subjects.\"  \"But that you do not know my mind!  You are modest."]]]
