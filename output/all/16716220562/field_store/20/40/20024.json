But now, if they happens to fancy these green scales, it's all up with ol' Bill.\"  \"Never fear,\" said Merla, \"I'll take care of you on our journey, and in our palaces you will find no sharks at all.\"  \"Can't they get in?\" he asked anxiously.  \"No. The palaces of the mermaids are inhabited only by themselves.\"  \"Is there anything else to be afraid of in the sea?\" asked the little girl after they had swum quite a while in silence.  \"One or two things, my dear,\" answered Princess Clia. \"Of course, we mermaids have great powers, being fairies; yet among the sea people is one nearly as powerful as we are, and that is the devilfish.\"  \"I know,\" said Trot. \"I've seen 'em.\"  \"You have seen the smaller ones, I suppose, which sometimes rise to the surface or go near the shore, and are often caught by fishermen,\" said Clia, \"but they are only second cousins of the terrible deep-sea devilfish to which I refer.\"  \"Those ones are bad enough, though,\" declared Cap'n Bill. \"If you know any worse ones, I don't want a interduction to 'em.\"  \"The monster devilfish inhabit caves in the rugged, mountainous regions of the ocean,\" resumed the Princess, \"and they are evil spirits who delight in injuring all who meet them. None lives near our palaces, so there is little danger of your meeting any while you are our guests.\"  \"I hope we won't,\" said Trot.  \"None for me,\" added Cap'n Bill. \"Devils of any sort ought to be give a wide berth, an' devilfish is worser ner sea serpents.\"  \"Oh, do you know the sea serpents?\" asked Merla as if surprised.  \"Not much I don't,\" answered the sailor, \"but I've heard tell of folks as has seen 'em.\"  \"Did they ever live to tell the tale?\" asked Trot.  \"Sometimes,\" he replied. \"They're jes' ORful creatures, mate.\"  \"How easy it is to be mistaken,\" said Princess Clia softly. \"We know the sea serpents very well, and we like them.\"  \"You do!\" exclaimed Trot.  \"Yes, dear. There are only three of them in all the world, and not only are they harmless, but quite bashful and shy. They are kind-hearted, too, and although not beautiful in appearance, they do many kind deeds and are generally beloved.\"  \"Where do they live?\" asked the child.  \"The oldest one, who is king of this ocean, lives quite near us,\" said Clia. \"His name is Anko.\"  \"How old is he?\" inquired Cap'n Bill curiously.  \"No one knows. He was here before the ocean came, and he stayed here because he learned to like the water better than the land as a habitation. Perhaps King Anko is ten thousand years old, perhaps twenty thousand. We often lose track of the centuries down here in the sea.\"  \"That's pretty old, isn't it?\" said Trot. \"Older than Cap'n Bill, I guess.\"  \"Summat,\" chuckled the sailor man, \"summat older, mate, but not much. P'raps the sea serpent ain't got gray whiskers.\"  \"Oh yes he has,\" responded Merla with a laugh. \"And so have his two brothers, Unko and Inko. They each have an ocean of their own, you know; and once every hundred years they come here to visit their brother Anko. So we've seen all three many times.\"  \"Why, how old are mermaids, then?\" asked Trot, looking around at the beautiful creatures wonderingly.  \"We are like all ladies of uncertain age,\" rejoined the Princess with a smile. \"We don't care to tell.\"  \"Older than Cap'n Bill?\"  \"Yes, dear,\" said Clia.  \"But we haven't any gray whiskers,\" added Merla merrily, \"and our hearts are ever young.\"  Trot was thoughtful. It made her feel solemn to be in the company of such old people. The band of mermaids seemed to all appearances young and fresh and not a bit as if they'd been soaked in water for hundreds of years. The girl began to take more notice of the sea maidens following after her. More than a dozen were in the group; all were lovely in appearance and clothed in the same gauzy robes as Merla and the Princess. These attendants did not join in the conversation but darted here and there in sportive play, and often Trot heard the tinkling chorus of their laughter. Whatever doubts might have arisen in the child's mind through the ignorant tales of her sailor friend, she now found the mermaids to be light-hearted, joyous and gay, and from the first she had not been in the least afraid of her new companions.  \"How much farther do we have to go?\" asked Cap'n Bill presently.  \"Are you getting tired?\" Merla inquired.  \"No,\" said he, \"but I'm sorter anxious to see what your palaces look like. Inside the water ain't as interestin' as the top of it. It's fine swimmin', I'll agree, an' I like it, but there ain't nuthin' special to see that I can make out.\"  \"That is true, sir,\" replied the Princess. \"We have purposely led you through the mid-water hoping you would see nothing to alarm you until you get more accustomed to our ocean life. Moreover, we are able to travel more swiftly here. How far do you think we have already come, Cap'n?\"  \"Oh, 'bout two mile,\" he answered.  \"Well, we are now hundreds of miles from the cave where we started,\" she told him.  \"You don't mean it!\" he exclaimed in wonder.  \"Then there's magic in it,\" announced Trot soberly.  \"True, my dear. To avoid tiring you and to save time, we have used a little of our fairy power,\" said Clia. \"The result is that we are nearing our home. Let us go downward a bit, now, for you must know that the mermaid palaces are at the very bottom of the ocean, and in its deepest part.\"     CHAPTER 4  THE PALACE OF QUEEN AQUAREINE   Trot was surprised to find it was not at all dark or gloomy as they descended farther into the deep sea. Things were not quite so clear to her eyes as they had been in the bright sunshine above the ocean's surface, but every object was distinct nevertheless, as if she saw through a pane of green-tainted glass. The water was very clear except for this green shading, and the little girl had never before felt so light and buoyant as she did now. It was no effort at all to dart through the water, which seemed to support her on all sides.  \"I don't believe I weigh anything at all,\" she said to Cap'n Bill.  \"No more do I, Trot,\" said he. \"But that's nat'ral, seein' as we're under water so far. What bothers me most is how we manage to breathe, havin' no gills like fishes have.\"  \"Are you sure we haven't any gills?\" she asked, lifting her free hand to feel her throat.  \"Sure. Ner the mermaids haven't any, either,\" declared Cap'n Bill.  \"Then,\" said Trot, \"we're breathing by magic.\"  The mermaids laughed at this shrewd remark, and the Princess said, \"You have guessed correctly, my dear. Go a little slower, now, for the palaces are in sight.\"  \"Where?\" asked Trot eagerly.  \"Just before you.\"  \"In that grove of trees?\" inquired the girl. And really, it seemed to her that they were approaching a beautiful grove. The bottom of the sea was covered with white sand, in which grew many varieties of sea shrubs with branches like those of trees. Not all of them were green, however, for the branches and leaves were of a variety of gorgeous colors. Some were purple, shading down to a light lavender; and there were reds all the way from a delicate rose-pink to vivid shades of scarlet. Orange, yellow and blue shades were there, too, mingling with the sea-greens in a most charming manner. Altogether, Trot found the brilliant coloring somewhat bewildering.  These sea shrubs, which in size were quite as big and tall as the trees on earth, were set so close together that their branches entwined; but there were several avenues leading into the groves, and at the entrance to each avenue the girl noticed several large fishes with long spikes growing upon their noses.  \"Those are swordfishes,\" remarked the Princess as she led the band past one of these avenues.  \"Are they dang'rous?\" asked Trot.  \"Not to us,\" was the reply. \"The swordfishes are among our most valued and faithful servants, guarding the entrances to the gardens which surround our palaces. If any creatures try to enter uninvited, these guards fight them and drive them away. Their swords are sharp and strong, and they are fierce fighters, I assure you.\"  \"I've known 'em to attack ships, an' stick their swords right through the wood,\" said Cap'n Bill.  \"Those belonged to the wandering tribes of swordfishes,\" explained the Princess. \"These, who are our servants, are too sensible and intelligent to attack ships.\"  The band now headed into a broad passage through the \"gardens,\" as the mermaids called these gorgeous groves, and the great swordfishes guarding the entrance made way for them to pass, afterward resuming their posts with watchful eyes. As they slowly swam along the avenue, Trot noticed that some of the bushes seemed to have fruits growing upon them, but what these fruits might be neither she nor Cap'n Bill could guess.  The way wound here and there for some distance, till finally they came to a more open space all carpeted with sea flowers of exquisite colorings. Although Trot did not know it, these flowers resembled the rare orchids of earth in their fanciful shapes and marvelous hues. The child did not examine them very closely, for across the carpet of flowers loomed the magnificent and extensive palaces of the mermaids.  These palaces were built of coral; white, pink and yellow being used, and the colors arranged in graceful designs. The front of the main palace, which now faced them, had circular ends connecting the straight wall, not unlike the architecture we are all familiar with; yet there seemed to be no windows to the building, although a series of archways served as doors.  Arriving at one of the central archways, the band of sea maidens separated. Princess Clia and Merla leading Trot and Cap'n Bill into the palace, while the other mermaids swam swiftly away to their own quarters.  \"Welcome!\" said Clia in her sweet voice. \"Here you are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4358"],["title","The Sea Fairies (#4)"],["body","only by friends and are in perfect safety. Please accept our hospitality as freely as you desire, for we consider you honored guests. I hope you will like our home,\" she added a little shyly.  \"We are sure to, dear Princess,\" Trot hastened to say.  Then Clia escorted them through the archway and into a lofty hall. It was not a mere grotto, but had smoothly built walls of pink coral inlaid with white. Trot at first thought there was no roof, for looking upward she could see the water all above them. But the princess, reading her thought, said with a smile, \"Yes, there is a roof, or we would be unable to keep all the sea people out of our palace. But the roof is made of glass to admit the light.\"  \"Glass!\" cried the astonished child. \"Then it must be an awful big pane of glass.\"  \"It is,\" agreed Clia. \"Our roofs are considered quite wonderful, and we owe them to the fairy powers of our queen. Of course, you understand there is no natural way to make glass under water.\"  \"No indeed,\" said Cap'n Bill. And then he asked, \"Does your queen live here?\"  \"Yes. She is waiting now, in her throne room, to welcome you. Shall we go in?\"  \"I'd just as soon,\" replied Trot rather timidly, but she boldly followed the princess, who glided through another arch into another small room where several mermaids were reclining upon couches of coral. They were beautifully dressed and wore many sparkling jewels.  \"Her Majesty is awaiting the strangers, Princess Clia,\" announced one of these. \"You are asked to enter at once.\"  \"Come, then,\" said Clia, and once more taking Trot's hand, she led the girl through still another arch, while Merla followed just behind them, escorting Cap'n Bill. They now entered an apartment so gorgeous that the child fairly gasped with astonishment. The queen's throne room was indeed the grandest and most beautiful chamber in all the ocean palaces. Its coral walls were thickly inlaid with mother-of-pearl, exquisitely shaded and made into borders and floral decorations. In the corners were cabinets, upon the shelves of which many curious shells were arranged, all beautifully polished. The floor glittered with gems arranged in patterns of flowers, like a brilliant carpet.  Near the center of the room was a raised platform of mother-of-pearl upon which stood a couch thickly studded with diamonds, rubies, emeralds and pearls. Here reclined Queen Aquareine, a being so lovely that Trot gazed upon her spellbound and Cap'n Bill took off his sailor cap and held it in his hands.  All about the room were grouped other mother-of-pearl couches, not raised like that of the queen, and upon each of these reclined a pretty mermaid. They could not sit down as we do, Trot readily understood, because of their tails; but they rested very gracefully upon the couches with their trailing gauzy robes arranged in fleecy folds.  When Clia and Merla escorted the strangers down the length of the great room toward the royal throne, they met with pleasant looks and smiles on every side, for the sea maidens were too polite to indulge in curious stares. They paused just before the throne, and the queen raised her head upon one elbow to observe them. \"Welcome, Mayre,\" she said, \"and welcome, Cap'n Bill. I trust you are pleased with your glimpse of the life beneath the surface of our sea.\"  \"I am,\" answered Trot, looking admiringly at the beautiful face of the queen.  \"It's all mighty cur'ous an' strange-like,\" said the sailor slowly. \"I'd no idee you mermaids were like this, at all!\"  \"Allow me to explain that it was to correct your wrong ideas about us that led me to invite you to visit us,\" replied the Queen. \"We usually pay little heed to the earth people, for we are content in our own dominions; but, of course, we know all that goes on upon your earth. So when Princess Clia chanced to overhear your absurd statements concerning us, we were greatly amused and decided to let you see with your own eyes just what we are like.\"  \"I'm glad you did,\" answered Cap'n Bill, dropping his eyes in some confusion as he remembered his former description of the mermaids.  \"Now that you are here,\" continued the Queen in a cordial, friendly tone, \"you may as well remain with us a few days and see the wonderful sights of our ocean.\"  \"I'm much obliged to you, ma'am,\" said Trot, \"and I'd like to stay ever so much, but mother worries jus' dreadfully if we don't get home in time.\"  \"I'll arrange all that,\" said Aquareine with a smile.  \"How?\" asked the girl.  \"I will make your mother forget the passage of time so she will not realize how long you are away. Then she cannot worry.\"  \"Can you do that?\" inquired Trot.  \"Very easily. I will send your mother into a deep sleep that will last until you are ready to return home. Just at present she is seated in her chair by the front window, engaged in knitting.\" The queen paused to raise an arm and wave it slowly to and fro. Then she added, \"Now your good mother is asleep, little Mayre, and instead of worries I promise her pleasant dreams.\"  \"Won't someone rob the house while she's asleep?\" asked the child anxiously.  \"No, dear. My charm will protect the house from any intrusion.\"  \"That's fine!\" exclaimed Trot in delight.  \"It's jes' won-erful!\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I wish I knew it was so. Trot's mother has a awful sharp tongue when she's worried.\"  \"You may see for yourselves,\" declared the Queen, and waved her hand again. At once they saw before them the room in the cottage, with Mayre's mother asleep by the window. Her knitting was in her lap, and the cat lay curled up beside her chair. It was all so natural that Trot thought she could hear the clock over the fireplace tick. After a moment the scene faded away, when the queen asked with another smile, \"Are you satisfied?\"  \"Oh yes!\" cried Trot. \"But how could you do it?\"  \"It is a form of mirage,\" was the reply. \"We are able to bring any earth scene before us whenever we wish. Sometimes these scenes are reflected above the water so that mortals also observe them.\"  \"I've seen 'em,\" said Cap'n Bill, nodding. \"I've seen mirages, but I never knowed what caused 'em afore now.\"  \"Whenever you see anything you do not understand and wish to ask questions, I will be very glad to answer them,\" said the Queen.  \"One thing that bothers me,\" said Trot, \"is why we don't get wet, being in the ocean with water all around us.\"  \"That is because no water really touches you,\" explained the Queen. \"Your bodies have been made just like those of the mermaids in order that you may fully enjoy your visit to us. One of our peculiar qualities is that water is never permitted to quite touch our bodies, or our gowns. Always there remains a very small space, hardly a hair's breadth, between us and the water, which is the reason we are always warm and dry.\"  \"I see,\" said Trot. \"That's why you don't get soggy or withered.\"  \"Exactly,\" laughed the Queen, and the other mermaids joined in her merriment.  \"I s'pose that's how we can breathe without gills,\" remarked Cap'n Bill thoughtfully.  \"Yes. The air space is constantly replenished from the water, which contains air, and this enables us to breathe as freely as you do upon the earth.\"  \"But we have fins,\" said Trot, looking at the fin that stood upright on Cap'n Bill's back.  \"Yes. They allow us to guide ourselves as we swim, and so are very useful,\" replied the Queen.  \"They make us more finished,\" said Cap'n Bill with a chuckle. Then, suddenly becoming grave, he added, \"How about my rheumatics, ma'am? Ain't I likely to get stiffened up with all this dampness?\"  \"No indeed,\" Aquareine answered. \"There is no such thing as rheumatism in all our dominions. I promise no evil result shall follow this visit to us, so please be as happy and contented as possible.\"     CHAPTER 5  THE SEA-SERPENT   Just then Trot happened to look up at the glass roof and saw a startling sight. A big head with a face surrounded by stubby gray whiskers was poised just over them, and the head was connected with a long, curved body that looked much like a sewer pipe.  \"Oh, there is King Anko,\" said the Queen, following the child's gaze. \"Open a door and let him in, Clia, for I suppose our old friend is anxious to see the earth people.\"  \"Won't he hurt us?\" asked the little girl with a shiver of fear.  \"Who, Anko? Oh no, my dear! We are very fond of the sea serpent, who is king of this ocean, although he does not rule the mermaids. Old Anko is a very agreeable fellow, as you will soon discover.\"  \"Can he talk?\" asked Trot.  \"Yes indeed.\"  \"And can we understand what he says?\"  \"Perfectly,\" replied the Queen. \"I have given you power, while you remain here, to understand the language of every inhabitant of the sea.\"  \"That's nice,\" said Trot gratefully.  The Princess Clia swam slowly to one of the walls of the throne room where, at a wave of her hand, a round hole appeared in the coral. The sea serpent at once observed this opening and the head left the roof of glass only to reappear presently at the round hole. Through this he slowly crawled until his head was just beneath the throne of Queen Aquareine, who said to him:  \"Good morning, your Majesty. I hope you are quite well?\"  \"Quite well, thank your Majesty,\" answered Anko; and then he turned to the strangers. \"I suppose these are the earth folks you were expecting?\"  \"Yes,\" returned the Queen. \"The girl is named Mayre and the man Cap'n Bill.\"  While the sea serpent looked at the visitors, they ventured to look at him. He certainly was a queer creature, yet Trot decided he was not at all frightful. His head was round as a ball, but his ears were sharp-pointed and had tassels at the ends of them. His nose was flat, and his mouth very wide indeed, but his eyes were blue and gentle in expression. The white, stubby hairs that surrounded his face were not thick like a beard, but scattered and scraggly. From the head, the long, brown body of the sea serpent extended to the hole in the coral wall, which was just big enough to"]]]
