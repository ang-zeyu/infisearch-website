As leaf   Shakes in the wind the shepherd shook,   And veiled his eyes before that look,   And prayed, and thought upon his home,   Nor spoke, nor moved, till the old man,   In voice like waterfall, began:   \"Shepherd, how names himself thy king?\"   \"Ma-anda,\" answered, shuddering,   The shepherd. \"Good, thou speakest well.   And now, my son, I bid thee tell   Thy first king's name.\" \"It was Kintu.\"   \"'Tis rightly said, thou answerest true.   Hark! To Ma-anda, Kintu's son,   Hasten, and bid him, fearing naught,   Come hither, taking thee for guide;   Thou and he, not another one,   Not even a dog may run beside!   Long has Ma-anda Kintu sought   With spell and conjuration dim,   Now Kintu has a word for him.   Go, do thy errand, haste thee hence,   Kintu insures thy recompense.\"   All night the shepherd ran, star-led,   All the hot day he hastened straight,   Nor stopped for sleep, nor stopped for bread,   Until he reached the city gate,   And saw red rays of evening fall   On the leaf-hutted capital.   He sought the king, his tale he told.   Ma-anda faltered not, nor stayed.   He seized his spear, he left the tent:   Shook off the brown arms of his queens,   Who clasped his knees with wailing screams;   On pain of instant death forbade   That man should spy or follow him;   And down the pathway, arching dim,   Fearless and light of heart and bold   Followed the shepherd where he went.    But one there was who loved his king   Too well to suffer such strange thing,--   The chieftain of the host was he,   Next to the monarch in degree;   And, fearing wile or stratagem   Menaced the king, he followed them   With noiseless tread and out of sight.   So on they fared the forest through,   From evening shades to dawning light,   From damning to the dusk and dew,--   The unseen follower and the two.   Ofttimes the king turned back to scan   The path, but never saw he man.   At last the forest-guarded space   They reached, where, ranged in order, sat,   Each couched upon his braided mat,   The white-robed warriors, face to face   With their majestic chief. The king,   Albeit unused to fear or awe,   Bowed down in homage, wondering,   And bent his eyes, as fearing to be   Blinded by rays of deity.   Then asked the mighty voice and calm,   \"Art thou Ma-anda called?\" \"I am.\"   \"And art thou king?\" \"The king am I,\"   The bold Ma-anda made reply.   \"Tis rightly spoken; but, my son,   Why hast thou my command forgot,   That no man with thee to this spot   Should come, except thy guide alone?\"   \"No man has come,\" Ma-anda said.    \"Alone we journeyed, he and I;   And often have I turned my head,   And never living thing could spy.   None is there, on my faith as king.\"   \"A king's word is a weighty thing,\"   The old man answered. \"Let it be,--   But still a man HAS followed thee!   Now answer, Ma-anda, one more thing:   Who, first of all thy line, was king?\"   \"Kintu the god.\" \"'Tis well, my son,   All creatures Kintu loved,--not one   Too pitiful or weak or small;   He knew them and he loved them all;   And never did a living thing,   Or bird in air or fish in lake,   Endure a pang for Kintu's sake.   Then rose his sons, of differing mind,   Who gorged on cruel feasts each day,   And bathed in blood, and joyed to slay,   And laughed at pain and suffering.   Then Kintu sadly went his way.   The gods long-suffering are and kind,   Often they pardon, long they wait;   But men are evil, men are blind.   After much tarriance, much debate,   The good gods leave them to their fate;   So Kintu went where none may find.    Each king in turn has sought since then,   From Chora down, the first in line,   To win lost Kintu back to men.   Vain was his search, and vain were thine,   Save that the gods have special grace   To thee, Ma-anda. Face to face   With Kintu thou shall stand, and he   Shall speak the word of power to thee;   Clasped to his bosom, thou shall share   His knowledge of the earth, the air,   And deep things, secret things, shall learn.   But stay,\"--the old man's voice grew stern,--   \"Before I further speak, declare   Who is that man in ambush there!\"   \"There is no man,--no man I see.\"   \"Deny no longer, it is vain.   Within the shadow of the tree   He lurketh; lo, behold him plain!\"   And the king saw;--for at the word   From covert stole the hidden spy,   And sought his monarch's side. One cry,   A lion's roar, Ma-anda gave,   Then seized his spear, and poised and drave.   Like lightning bolt it hissed and whirred,   A flash across the midnight blue.   A single groan, a jet of red,   And, pierced and stricken through and through,   Upon the ground the chief fell dead;   But still with love no death could chase,   His eyes sought out his master's face.    Blent with Ma-anda's a wild cry   Of many voices rose on high,   A shriek of anguish and despair.   Which shook and filled the startled air;   And when the king, his wrath still hot,   Turned him, the little grassy plain   All lonely in the moonlight lay:   The chiefs had vanished all away   As melted into thin, blue wind;   Gone was the old man. Stunned and blind,   For a long moment stood the king;   He tried to wake; he rubbed his eyes,   As though some fearful dream to end.   It was no dream, this fearful thing:   There was the forest, there the skies,   The shepherd--and his murdered friend.   With feverish haste, bewildered, mazed,   This way and that he vainly sped,   Beating the air like one half crazed;   With prayers and cries unnumbered,   Searching, imploring,--vain, all vain.   Only the echoing woods replied,   With mocking booms their long aisles through,   \"Come back, Kintu, Kintu, Kintu!\"   And pitiless to all his pain   The unanswering gods his suit denied.   At last, as dawning slowly crept   To day, the king sank down and wept   A space; then, lifting as they could   The lifeless burden, once a man,   He and the shepherd-guide began   Their grievous journey through the wood,   The long and hard and dreary way,   Trodden so lightly yesterday;   And the third day, at evening's fall,   Gained the leaf-hutted capital.   There burial rites were duly paid:    Like bridegroom decked for banqueting,   The chief adorned his funeral-pyre;   Rare gums and spices fed the fire,   Perfumes and every precious thing;   And songs were sung, and prayers were prayed,   And priests danced jubilant all day.   But prone the king Ma-anda lay,   With ashes on his royal crest,   And groaned, and beat upon his breast,   And called on Kintu loud and wild:   \"Father, come back, forgive thy child!\"   Bitter the cry, but vain, all vain;   The grieved god came not again.     EASTER.    When dawns on earth the Easter sun     The dear saints feel an answering thrill.     With whitest flowers their hands they fill;   And, singing all in unison,    Unto the battlements they press--     The very marge of heaven--how near!     And bend, and look upon us here   With eyes that rain down tenderness.    Their roses, brimmed with fragrant dew,     Their lilies fair they raise on high;     \"Rejoice! The Lord is risen!\" they cry;   \"Christ is arisen; we prove it true!    \"Rejoice, and dry those faithless tears     With which your Easter flowers are stained;     Share in our bliss, who have attained   The rapture of the eternal years;    \"Have proved the promise which endures,     The Love that deigned, the Love that died;     Have reached our haven by His side--   Are Christ's, but none the less are yours;    \"Yours with a nearness never known     While parted by the veils of sense;     Infinite knowledge, joy intense,   A love which is not love alone,    \"But faith perfected, vision free,     And patience limitless and wise--     Beloved, the Lord is risen, arise!   And dare to be as glad as we!\"    We do rejoice, we do give thanks,     O blessed ones, for all your gain,     As dimly through these mists of pain   We catch the gleaming of your ranks.    We will arise, with zeal increased,     Blending, the while we strive and grope,     Our paler festival of Hope   With your Fruition's perfect feast.    Bend low beloved, against the blue;     Lift higher still the lilies fair,     Till, following where our treasures are,   We come to join the feast with you.     BIND-WEED.    In the deep shadow of the porch     A slender bind-weed springs,   And climbs, like airy acrobat,     The trellises, and swings   And dances in the golden sun     In fairy loops and rings.    Its cup-shaped blossoms, brimmed with dew,     Like pearly chalices,   Hold cooling fountains, to refresh     The butterflies and bees;   And humming-birds on vibrant wings     Hover, to drink at ease.    And up and down the garden-bed,     Mid box and thyme and yew,   And spikes of purple lavender,     And spikes of larkspur blue,   The bind-weed tendrils win their way,     And find a passage through.    With touches coaxing, delicate,     And arts that never tire,   They tie the rose-trees each to each,     The lilac to the brier,   Making for graceless things a grace,     With steady, sweet desire.    Till near and far the garden growths.     The sweet, the frail, the rude,   Draw close, as if with one consent,     And find each other good,   Held by the bind-weed's pliant loops,     In a dear brotherhood.    Like one fair sister, slender, arch,     A flower in bloom and poise,   Gentle and merry and beloved,     Making no stir or noise,   But swaying, linking, blessing all     A family of boys.     APRIL.    Hark! upon the east-wind, piping, creeping,     Comes a voice all clamorous with despair;   It is April, crying sore and weeping,     O'er the chilly earth, so brown and bare.    \"When "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45619"],["title","History of the Prophet Joseph, (#0)"],["body","http://mormontextsproject.org/ for a complete list of Mormon texts available on Project Gutenberg, to help proofread similar books, or to report typos.

IMPROVEMENT ERA: Salt Lake City, Utah, 1902.    INTRODUCTION.  This history of the Prophet Joseph Smith, originally entitled, \"The History of Mother Smith, by Herself,\" was written at the dictation of Lucy Smith, mother of the Prophet, by Mrs. Martha Jane Knowlton Coray who acted as her amanuensis. It was taken from the words of Mother Smith and dictated from memory mostly, but she also made use of such historical memoranda of the events related as were within her reach. Of the original manuscript one copy was taken which was left with Lucy Smith, while the original was retained by the writer. This original, Mrs. Coray held in her possession until her arrival in Utah, when she subsequently deposited a copy of it with President Brigham Young.  Lucy Smith died near Nauvoo, May 5, 1855; but years prior to this date, some of her effects were left in the hands of her son, William Smith, among them being the manuscript copy of this history. From William (who was the last surviving brother of the Prophet, and whose death occurred at Osterdock, Clayton county, Iowa, November 13, 1893,) the document fell (surreptitiously it is declared by George A. Smith) into the hands of Isaac Sheen, who was at one time a member of the Church, in Michigan. When, in September, 1852, Apostle Orson Pratt went on a mission to England, he called on Mr. Sheen on his way East, and, being shown the manuscript copy, he purchased it for a certain sum of money, took it to Liverpool with him, where, without revision and without the consent or knowledge of President Young or any of the Twelve, it was published under his direction, in 1853. It was afterwards discovered that the book contained errors, occasioned by its not being carefully compared with historical data. Some of the statements in the preface written by Elder Pratt were also in error; one especially that the book was mostly written in the lifetime of the Prophet, and that he had read it with approval, was incorrect, since it was written in 1845, the year following his martyrdom. For these reasons, and others mostly of a financial character, it was disapproved by President Young, on August 23, 1865, and the edition was suppressed or destroyed. While some statements contained in the work were considered somewhat overdrawn,--a circumstance easily accounted for when we remember the age of Mother Smith, the losses she had sustained in the death of a husband and four sons, and the consequent lapses of her memory,--its many merits were fully recognized by the authorities, many of whom were greatly disappointed at the necessity of issuing the order to temporarily suppress its further circulation.  Subsequently, a committee of revision was appointed by President Young, consisting of President George A. Smith and Judge Elias Smith, cousins of the Prophet, men personally familiar with the family, and thoroughly conversant with Church history. They were instructed carefully to revise and correct the original work throughout, which they did, reporting their labors to President Brigham Young, to his entire satisfaction. The revised and only authentic copy thus prepared and reported upon was retained by President George A. Smith, and shortly after his death, September 1, 1875, it was committed into my keeping, where it has remained until now.  Recently the question of printing the work as a serial in the Improvement Era came up for consideration, and there was a unanimous sentiment among the members of the General Board of Y. M. M. I. A. favorable to its publication. The subject was accordingly submitted and explained to President Lorenzo Snow, who gave his sanction, and his hearty approval of the enterprise.  By the presentation of this work to the public, a worthy record is preserved, and the testimony of a noble and faithful woman--a mother indeed, and heroine in Israel--is perpetuated. The book, besides giving an extended account of the progenitors of the Prophet, and the Smith and Mack families, contains much interesting and valuable information, found in no other publication, relating to the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who, through the will of God, was the chosen instrument to perform the foundation labor for the \"marvelous work and a wonder\" which God has established as his Church, in the last days.  Believing that both old and young will be pleased as well as benefitted by the perusal of its pages, and praying that it may inspire them with renewed zeal, and create in them additional faith in the great work of the Lord, I commend to the reader this History of the Prophet Joseph.
